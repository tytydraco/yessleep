-There was this girl in my Dreams... I had just recently woke up, time check 9:15 Am. I remember her so vividly, but also can't remember her that much. I can remember her body, her long black hair, but not her face. It would seem like that every time I try so hard to remember, I can't. I'm only gonna base it on what I can remember, so it might not be as detailed since it WAS just a dream afterall. I didn't want to write this at first, but I couldn't stop thinking about it the moment I woke up from my sleep. 

It was in a school day, I can't remember what's the context on what's happening, so I'll try my best to write it out. From what I could recall, we were in school, I was sitting in the floor with a couple of my friends and she was sat next to me. She told me "I like you, the people from where I lived doesn't want to be near me," or atleast,I think those were the lines she said, I can't remember. I want to remember, need to remember. She leaned down her head and rested it on my thigh. That's all I could remember from that moment, I know there was more context to that moment, I know there was something wrong, but I can't fucking remember. It's been on the back of my brain, and I'm going crazy thinking about it even more. 

Time check:9:36AM. 
From what I could remember, she wasn't even wearing the typical school uniform. Well, she did, for a brief moment in my dream atleast. She had long black hair, she has this mischievous, cheeky smile. She wore a kimono, and a long black haori..? The haori was black and the inside was gray, I think? It was only for a short moment until she suddenly wore the uniform of my school.

Further more on what I could recall, I didn't like her, more like she was forcing me to like her. Seeing that I'm the type to be a pushover at times, I didn't do much to stop her as she forced me to be with her in that dream. And no, we didn't do anything sexual. We were walking down the school hallway, my friends teasing me. The whole time, she was silent as she was gaining more speed each time she walks. Eventually, my friends and I departed and now they were gone. I continued walking in the same direction as her, but the whole time, she was silent, she never once looked at me. As we were reaching some sort of tunnel..?â€” she quickly turned around and faced me for a brief moment, and ran away quickly before I could even say something. She wasn't looking at me, she was looking at the ground when she faced me and ran away. I looked where she was running to, as she ran to a corner and disappeared from sight. I couldn't stop her, so in the end I ended up just walking in the direction she showed me earlier. That's where my dream was cut-off then. 

I also could remember us playing some sort of game before we departed. She ranked number 10 globally too. I tried searching up her ID in the same dream but nothing came up, I tried and tried, but nothin. Until suddenly, I just woke up. 

Everything in that dream was just a jumbled mess, even I don't understand what's going on, or what's the context. I'll probably try remembering it harder, if that's even possible.  Time:10:02AM
