Morning came, so did another call.  I jittered at the kitchen table as I waited for Mom to pick up.  With a click, my Mom’s voice eased some of my anxiety, “Hello, sweetie, so nice of you to call so soon!”

My heart fell into my chest at the thought of ruining her joy with the questions to come.  With a sigh, I responded, “Hi! Yes, well, I hate to call for depressing reasons, but I have more…um… questions about Dan…if you don’t mind?”

A crippling pause on the line.  “Of course, honey,” She finally replied, “I’m sure it's awful having forgotten things about your sweet little brother… How can I help?”

“Well, I remembered some of his worst episodes of night terrors, but the actual details of them are still a blur.  I was hoping you would remember. Do you recall what it was he would see during those, uh, occurrences?”  

A contemplative breath was taken, “Well,”  She began, “Sometimes, it would just be shadows that scared him.  You know, figures in the corner, or something peeking from out of the closet.  But his worst one was something that got right up to him.”  A restraining sigh paused her story before continuing, “Oh, I remember he was really rattled by that one.  He was shaking in my arms the whole night, crying about a giant with eyes all over him.  That was the worst one…the worst one.  He only had that particular nightmare about four times, though, before the accident…”

I digested that statement, cold sweat coating my palms, “Were all pretty close to when the accident happened?”

Another thoughtful pause, “Yes, I believe all four episodes happened about a month before the accident.  Why do you want to know all this?  Are you still getting awful sleep?”

Concern dripped through the phone.  I tried to stamp it out, “No, no, I have been doing better.  I was just curious if this was all, like, a genetic thing or something me and Dan maybe watched when we were little and stuck with us.  Like a scary movie monster or something.  Just jumpstarting my memories since they are still pretty foggy lately.”  Not a total lie, I was hoping for some easy explanation for all this.  

With notable relief in her voice, Mom replied, “Ok, as long as you're sleeping, and no, I don’t remember you two watching a movie that would scar you like that! Unless you snuck downstairs one night WITH Dan.”  

I smiled as memories of doing just that reemerged.  Warm, happy memories of staying up late into the night with Dan during summer vacation, watching all sorts of shit we definitely were too young to see.  But still, no recollection of a horror movie traumatizing us.  The worst-case scenario remained prominent.  I ended the call with pleasantries to further ease the concern I caused Mom, before frantically searching online for any way to snap out of sleep paralysis by force.  Ice coursed through my blood as I watched the day burn away, the daunting, inevitable blotching my mind.   

A new fear arose from my conversation, fuel to the already unstable fire.  The number of episodes Dan had before he died.  Four, four times he saw this thing.  And then, the accident.  Something had latched onto his brain, something that was much more patient with him.  I couldn’t believe it was a coincidence, no matter how much I tried.  

Three times I had already seen it.  What would happen after a fourth visit?  The implications were suffocating me.  Sunset was approaching.  Another pot of coffee brewed as I stared out my window at the dimming daylight.  The stockpile of existential horrors lay like bloated corpses on my mind.  I would remain awake, no matter my exhaustion, that much I knew.  I planned out my night of activities to avoid any leisure that could lead to a mishap like last time—puzzles, video games, anything that required my stimulated attention.  Of course, these were to be supplements when searching for an answer to my predicament grew too frustrating.  

All lights remained on, TV blaring in the background, as I tried to concoct any ideas on how to shake this nightmare off my trail.  What could I do if I couldnt move or speak?  After a lengthy internal spiral, I came to the simple conclusion that was staring me in the face the whole time.  I would not sleep ever again.  

It was deep into the early morning when this revelation occurred.  A digital clock glowed its haunting red hue onto my nightstand; the time was 3:21 AM.  Another cup of coffee to celebrate my enlightenment was in order.  With a flourish, I giddily poured the stale drink into my stained mug.  Whether it was the lack of sleep mixed with copious amounts of caffeine or the strain of mental turmoil finally breaking me, I will never know.  All I knew was that I was shaking with tremors of laughter on my couch upon this plan’s discovery.  The relief fueled this avalanche of chaotic joy.  The rest of the night, like a coked-up child, I pointed and laughed at whatever mindless sitcom happened to be playing on the TV.  Cup after cup of coffee, I quaked with giggles through the night; the jitters were part of the fun, I suppose.  

Then the sun began to rise, which was when I took a long, hard look at myself.  Exhaustion was setting in, along with the embarrassment of my behavior.  Another pot brewed on the kitchen counter as I stared at my phone.  The word, *Monday*, was staring at me.  I had two more days off to ‘enjoy’ before I returned to a job I had little to no recollection of.  With a plan of such childish proportions that, if I followed through with it, it would debilitate any capacity I had to re-learn my job’s role.  

Another stressor.  Another life-threatening responsibility I had little understanding of clawed its way onto the pile of dread in the pit of my stomach.  Nevertheless, I would go through with my plan.  I was dead-set on never sleeping again.  Simple as that.  I knew I would need something much stronger than coffee at some point, but I would cross that bridge when I got there.  

All day, I exerted as little energy as possible, all while trying to remain somewhat active to ensure a drowsy fit would not sabotage me.  Walks, gaming, puzzles, calling what friends and family I could recall.  I gave my Mom a break from me; I had already upset her twice.  With that, another day came and went.  The moon mocked me through my open window as I stared at the horizon.  

I lasted the next day, and then the next.  Seventy-two hours of no sleep does things to the body.  I could barely stand up without almost blacking out.  My body felt both like a corpse my soul was chained to, and a third-person out-of-body observer of my own self.  I couldn’t leave the house; my vision was a wavy blur of unfocused stimuli.  No way I could drive.  Work was tomorrow.  Hoping for the best, I sifted through my contacts, hoping to find someone clearly labeled “boss”.  

Thank God, I found him, *Jim (boss man)*, was buried in my contacts.  With a sobering sigh, I called.  As soon as he answered, and after we got through the courtesy talk of “how are you doing?” and “feeling rested, I hope”, I delved into the script I had lucidly concocted in my sleep-deprived soup brain.  “Yeah, so uh,” I began, “I hate to say but I am still pretty rough right now and even just remembering where I sleep has been an issue,” I embellished my condition for a few more lines, before ending with the question I was obviously building up to, “Would it possible to get the next two days for me as well? I think having the long weekend will be enough for me to really gather myself.”

A long pause rattled any confidence I had in my rushed script.  After a sigh I definitely was not supposed to hear, Jim concluded the call with, “Yeah, yeah, we can handle things here while you're out.  Take the time you need.  Just be sure you are ready to go on Monday, first thing.”  

Thanking him, before I could end the call, he cut me off, saying, “By the way, get some sleep.  You sound either drunk or exhausted, and I don’t wanna assume the worst,”  and hung up.  

I couldnt even be mad at him.  I got the time off, but eventually, I would have to drag my barely conscious corpse to work.  And clearly, I was already deteriorating in ways I hadn’t noticed.  Another night to come, and this erosion would only get worse.  

I expected it to be like a learning curve for my body.  That one of these days I would adapt and suddenly feel alive and energized again.  After another day, now a total of five, this assumption desimated.  Time lulls, days are hazes of barely noticed stimulation.  If it wasn't for my phone, I wouldn't know what day it was.  Eventually, it was Saturday, apparently.  I stood against the wall, propping myself upright, staring out the window at the rising sun.  

I turned toward the kitchen table, reached out for my coffee mug.  That simple, sudden movement was all it took.  My head swam, my vision melted as I felt my legs give out.  With a desperate flail, I managed to push off the wall, ensuring I would not cave my head into the table corner.  Loose noodle arms extended, I braced with impact.  A wet pop was the last thing I heard before completely blacking out.
