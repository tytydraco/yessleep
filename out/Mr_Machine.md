There was this TV show I used to watch called “Mr. Machine”. It aired on a local station that mostly consisted of boring “adult” shows and news, so my young self always liked when it played. My family lived in a small rural town that had little to no media assess. Those were different times; I’m old now – much too old to be posting online, I guess - and still can’t really fathom how quickly technology improved over the years. When my nephew showed me the internet for the first time, I was amazed. Confused, yes, but amazed nonetheless.

I could look up everything that I was always curious about – all the world’s secrets seemed to open and reveal themselves before me. I could see my old town again – a decayed silent and empty place once thriving with life. “Ghost town” read one website’s description. “Top 15 creepiest abandoned places in the U.S.” read another article featuring a photo of an old barn that I used to play in with other kids.

It’s funny to me, how the past seems to creep people out nowadays.

Soon enough - after my nephew explained to me how downloading torrents worked - I managed to attain a big collection of all my favorite shows from the past. There was only one that I couldn’t find: “Mr. Machine”.

I searched far and wide, almost getting my PC infested with a virus in the process, but I still couldn’t find even a short clip, or a single frame from the show.

But I remembered it very vividly.

The titular host of the show – Mr. Machine – was a jolly magician wearing a black top hat, a red cape with a pattern of blue stars and crescent moons, a white suit, purple tie and checkered black-and-white pants; every episode revolved around him helping some kids with any trouble and problems they encountered. He carried a red box he would call his “machine” and always used it to make something appear, disappear, change size etc. A typical kids show; each episode contained some sort of a moralizing message.

I still really wanted to see it, so I made an account on a forum dedicated to finding old, obscure and local shows and posted my request there.

In about two hours, someone responded - they were going by the nickname of “garageboxtv44”. This “garagebox” fellow sent me a download link with the following message attached:

“Hi. I’m sending you the 4 episodes I managed to tape off TV back in the day. I guess we both lived in the same area. Yeah, very obscure – very weird. Just see it for yourself, man. I never want to see it again. I guess you will have the same reaction as I did, lol. Cheers.”

“Weird. What was supposed to be so “very weird” about it?” I thought.

I didn’t remember anything unnerving to be in that show, and yet this guy certainly seemed to be reacting weirdly to it.

After downloading the archive I was greeted with four MP4 files each titled “mrmachine1” and so on. Each file seemed to lack any thumbnail, even though they were video files. I though nothing of it and - anxious to hear that familiar theme song again – played the first one.

The footage was blurry, evidently ripped off of a worn-out VHS tape, but still clear enough to present the titular Mr. Machine in all his whimsical glory. There was no intro however, but I thought that maybe the other episodes have it. And so, I leaned back in my chair and watched on, with a satisfied and amused grin on my face.

“Mr. Machine! There is something wrong with my kitty cat!” yelped out a small boy as he ran up to Mr. Machine and pulled his cape. “Please! Will you help him?!”

“Of course, little Tommy!” was the enthusiastic response.

Soon, after arriving at the little boy’s home, the magician pulled out his machine and asked the boy to show him his kitty.

“Gee! I dunno, Mr. Machine! He is in a really bad shape!”

“Oh, come on now, Tommy! There is NOTHING my machine wouldn’t fix in an instant! Remember – magic does wonders!”

The boy reluctantly opened the door to his room.

I noticed that something was off as soon as they both arrived at that place. The house was a real one – It wasn’t a cheap set – and I could see how shoddy and old it was. The paint was coming off the wall in a few places and the furniture looked ancient. I thought that maybe they couldn’t afford a better location due to the small budget, but my worries increased as the camera focused on the “cat”.

It wasn’t an ordinary house cat, not even an animal. It was a man wearing a anthropomorphic cat costume – a very badly made cat costume. Its plastic eyes were bulging out expressionless as the magician came up to it.

“What’s wrong with you my little kitty?” he asked.

The “cat” wasn’t little at all. In fact, I think that the actor inside was taller than Mr. Machine.

“Meow!” he yelped. “I’m very cold! I think I’m sick, Mr. Machine! Meow!”

There was something about his voice that made me very uneasy. I don’t know how to describe it, but it sounded forced and unpleasant.

“Don’t worry my little feline friend! My machine knows how to make medicine! Look and see!”

With that jolly cry, the machine moved about and opened its lid revealing a small bottle filled with pills inside. After taking it out of the machine, the magician produced one of the small pills and gave it to the “cat”. After pretending to swallow the pill, the actor in the costume rubbed his furry belly and expressed his relief.

“Remember, kids!” said Mr. Machine, turning to face the camera. “Cats and other pets must be taken care of! If your kitty, or doggy seems--”

The footage abruptly stopped there, leaving a black screen for about a minute before the entire video file stopped playing.

“Weird.” I thought. “Must be a very early episode. I didn’t remember it being so shoddy.”

With some weird mixture of anxiety, disappointment and curiosity, I played the second file.

The second episode was different and was way more professional-looking. This time Mr. Machine’s theme song played in full making me feel that feeling of nostalgic happiness that I didn’t watching the first episode.

When it finished, the show proper began – Mr. Machine was helping some kids with their homework and gave a rather cheesy short speech on learning and being a good student at school. One of the kids was strangely familiar to me, but I brushed it off as my memory getting bad due to my old age.

Another scene followed: two boys sat at a table arguing over a borrowed comic book while Mr. Machine put his box between them. The magician tapped the lid, and the machine produced a miniature stage where a puppet cat and a small comic book appeared. The puppet cat was shoved by a little faceless wooden figure that came suddenly out of the bottom of the stage, tumbled, and the comic was “burned” in slow, paper cut-out flames while a cheesy sad song played in the background.

The whole puppet show seemed very confusing to me, and I wondered how could any small kid even begin to understand its message. I remembered having a similar conflict with one of my friends back in the day. One way or another, we got into a heated argument – something to do with my comic book collection that I was very proud of – and then, something happened.

When I tried to remember more, I was taken aback by how suddenly Mr. Machine came up to the camera. His eyes seemed very focused – tense even.

Mr. Machine wagged a finger and lectured about respect and temper, about how small cruelties grow if you don’t stop them. I watched the scene and my stomach dropped as the taller boy in the sketch reminded me of someone – the large ears, the same crooked front teeth when he laughed, the exact cowlick he always complained about.

“Jacob?” I thought. “Jacob, oh my God! I remember now!” I blurted out loud.

Jacob was the kid I used to be friends with. We both met almost every day and were best buddies. We watched Mr. Machine together and always played pretending to have our own magical machines. We were so close together, almost like brothers. I could now remember that warm feeling of fun we both shared. He had this cute little cat we loved to play with. I sighed as I recollected how happy we both were when it meowed running around the yard.

Now, I remembered how that friendship suddenly disappeared from my life. I couldn’t remember exactly how it started, but we both began to hate each other over that year.

“Oh, right!” I thought. “It was Jacob who didn’t want to give back my comic book that one time!”

I couldn’t believe just how similar the actor playing one of the kids was similar to him. It was so eerie. The cat in this episode and the one before – that also made me think of him.

The episode ended normally and I stared at the screen worried. I decided to continue watching, as I hoped to regain some more lost memories.

The third episode was winter themed and its main lesson was about safety during the winter break.

“Now, kids, look out!” Mr. Machine exclaimed. “Water is dangerous enough on its own, but especially during winter! You can get VERY COLD if you fall into it!”

Something about that sentence and how Mr. Machine pronounced it made my heart start up.

“What?” I mumbled to myself. “Cold water… what was it?”

On the screen the show cut to a staged dramatization: a frozen pond with a thin, cracked sheen of ice and a shaggy cat puppet. Two children teased the poor cat until one of them pushed it; the puppet teetered, slid, and plunged through a jagged hole into black water where it bobbed and disappeared. Mr. Machine knelt, solemn, and spoke about consequences - how a careless shove can mean life or death. The scene was clumsy and theatrical, but it unlocked something inside me like; a picture of a real cold river came rushing back and smacked me in the face.

I now remembered why I stopped talking to Jacob after that winter break. All the bad memories were terrible enough, but then, something about Jacob’s cat made we cringe with discomfort. I didn’t remember the details, only that after I got so angry at him his pet cat was running around in the snow trying to play with me. I remembered the burning anger as I saw it.

I was so devastated by all the emotions now flooding in.

I dreaded to play the final file. After much thinking I decided to get it over with and clicked on “mrmachine4” – the final episode.

Episode, right... I wasn’t even an episode.

It was just Mr. Machine’s head and upper body on a black background looking at the camera. His face emotionless and cold – almost sculpted and unreal but still distinctively alive, fleshy and moving ever so slightly.

“Hello there ----” here he said my full name.

I jumped up in my seat and screamed out loud. I wanted to move, but fear made me still as a rock.

“No use of screaming now.” he continued “All the kids that did something VERY BAD have to pay for it in eventually, don’t they?” he tilted his head looking right at me.

He followed my gaze and movements – I thought I was going insane.

“No… How?” I mumbled.

“So!” he responded, clasping his hands. “You really don’t understand the lessons I’ve showed you just now? You are a really slow learner! Mrs. Kowalsky was right about you being a ‘stupid little brat’ after all!”

“Mrs. Kowalsky…” I mumbled. She was my elementary school teacher.

Somehow, he knew all about my life in all details of it. He knew my grades, my favorite singers, the date of my wedding, the date I’ve lost my virginity and every other significant moment of my long life.

He looked at me like a demon, like a ever-knowing deity. Judging.

“Now, let us go back to that cold winter of 1964, shall we?”

I looked on with dread as images of me and Jacob flashed on the screen. We both were fighting, both hated each other after all those years of friendship.

I didn’t even try to rationalize it anymore - I just sat an watched.

The footage dissolved into a shaky home-movie style clip - grainy, handheld, the kind of old film stock that made human faces look like ghosts. There I was, smaller, meaner, cheeks raw from cold and anger, hands clasped tightly into fists. Jacob stood opposite me, eyes wide, hands held out in pure fear. Besides us was the cold, deep dark river. Suddenly, Jacob's cry filled the speakers and my throat bruised with the memory.

I remembered how much I hated him when, to make me even more angry, he burned my precious small collection of comic books in the kitchen stove. I remembered how I wanted to hurt him – hurt him so much. Then, the final flash of memory – winter; final days of winter break and me, deranged with hate and malice, taking his beloved kitty and throwing it into the river to drown.

“Tsk, tsk. You were so ruthless for such a small kid.” whispered Mr. Machine – his voice resonating inside of my head and reverberating with all severity.

Guts turned inside my body as I realized what he was talking about. As unbelievable as it was, Mr. Machine was speaking to me.

“Isn’t that what you did?” he asked, still looking straight at me, piercing me with pure condescending hate. “You killed Jacob Stanley’s cat, didn’t you?”

I was breathing heavily and sweating like a madman. I remembered it now – all the fights we both had, all the bruises that he gave me and that I gave him – all the malice in his eyes as he burned my comic books. I remembered it – the look of fear in the eyes of that kitty, as I plunged it into the cold waters that terrible winter all those years ago. I remembered it all now.

I sunk back into my chair weeping and pleading Mr. Machine to spare me. I cried like a little child again, and again felt like a helpless little kid. The feeling of guilt and all the returning memories came flooding back and my heart hurt badly.

“You like cold water, boy?” he asked, with a horrible grin on his face. “My machine will make you feel like that poor kitty you destroyed!” He opened the machine’s lid and revealed a torrent of icy waters. I screamed out loud, as I moved towards the bathroom door against my own will. I watched as my hands turned the cold water on and as the bathtub filled up to the brim. I watched as I jumped right into it and begun sinking.

Deep, cold.

Deep underwater, as the lights faded away and the cold overtook me.
