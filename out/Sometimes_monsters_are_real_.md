Sometimes reality breaks open just enough to let in some terrible things that lurk beyond the light provided by this plane of existence. Things that spend eternity hunting and rutting in the darkness beyond suddenly free to creep into the sunshine and normality of the sane world we take for granted. Like a violent rape, they tear their way into our dimension to do dark and bloody deeds under the light of our sun. I'd like to tell you how I know that. I'd also like to tell you how the knowledge of such things has been passed down through my familial DNA like some strange disease, to be activated randomly like some recessive gene at some later point in time, bringing terrible symptoms with it. 

I first reckoned with what I call the Awareness Curse that plagues my family like a hidden and lurking prion disease as a young boy.

 When that black and ancient alter universe gave screaming birth to one of its incomprehensible horrors. 


My grandfather served in the Navy during the war in Korea. He never talked about it. I asked him once, when I was little, what it was like. He made me promise to never join the military and go to war. He told me he didn't like talking about it and told me that war is terrible and unnecessary.

I really took him seriously, as I respected him so very much. He was an honorable man. He acted as my stand in father while my biological father lived his best life somewhere with drugs and partying. 

He never drank, as alcoholism nearly killed him decades prior. When he came home from the war, he struggled to get back to civilian life. He turned to drink as a coping mechanism. It nearly ended his life in a single vehicle crash. It almost ended his marriage too. He had long since promised my grandmother that he'd never drink again. He had a limp from the accident that acted as a daily reminder of the dangers of drinking. 

My mother also abandoned me. She was still a teenager when I was born. Feeling robbed of her high school years, she felt entitled to make up for her loss of time by leaving me with her parents to go live her best life like my father. She did drugs and drank and broke her parents' hearts. She tried her best to ignore me and responsibility in general.

All the while, my grandparents took up the mantle of parenthood in their places. They were good at it. Even though we never had much money, I never wanted for much. My childhood, during their time as my parents, was rich and full of love.
What I lacked in financial advantage was more than made up for with kindness, patience, and unconditional love.

My summer days were the best. Walks with my grandmother down the long, dusty lane they built their house beside.

 We'd collect discarded cans from drivers doing  some late night rendezvous down at the end of that dirt road. It ended on a hill after about two miles into the woods and the hill gave a scenic view of the woods and farms further on. It became a local "Lover's Lane" for young couples feeling amorous, much to my grandparents dismay. 
Me and Mummum would walk that lane  collecting the cans they'd toss from their cars and make a weekly trip to the recycling yard in her beat up little Dodge Omni, then collect the few bucks our bags of cans awarded us. She'd then let me use that money to pick out movies at the video store( $5 for a new release, or five old movies for the same price!). Or she'd take me to the DAV thrift store, where those couple bucks would get me my pick of a ton of secondhand toys. Or trips to the library, where I could pick out books that she'd later read to me before bed. That jump-started my lifelong passion of reading.
All that while my grandfather worked long hours at the steel mill in Baltimore, an hour commute away.

When he got home, I was always impatiently waiting at the driveway by the garage. He'd come ambling out of his Warlock truck, usually with a pocket full of Worther's hard candy, and scoop me up in his big, tattooed arms, and swing me around as I laughed. It ended in a big hug, and I will never forget the smell of his aftershave. That ancient Old Spice that came in a little porcelain bottle with the stopper on top. Sometimes he'd rub his stubbly cheek onto mine, and yell, "I got a sandpaper face, Bubba!" 

Everything about him signified strength to me. His rugged biceps, rippling with muscle. The faded Navy tattoos, including the obligatory anchor. His manly chest hair, so coarse against my face when I hugged him, and the way the crucifix he wore on a little chain sometimes got lost in the thicket of salt and pepper hairs. He was so strong, so alive, like he'd always been and always would be.
Even his sparse, thinning hair on his head seemed full of vitality, as if it'd always be there too. The thick goopy stuff he scooped out of the little can to slick it back in that old style just seemed to make him so cool to young me. Like James Dean, his hair. But thinner. Like an elder Dean, with more life experience and grown even tougher.

If he wasn't too tired, we'd grab our walking sticks; which he'd shown me how to cut, whittle and carve designs on, and take a little hike in the woods behind his house. Or he'd spend some time pushing me up and down the little hills in the front yard on my Big Wheel. Or we'd get some buckets and scoop minnows out of the "crick" out back. Sometimes we would snatch frogs from the pond in the large field on the west side of the property. Or he'd show me how to impale wriggling blood worms onto sharp hooks and fish some sunnys from that pond. Each activity made me love him more. Every lesson he taught me added to the respect I held for him in my heart.

It was during one of those pond fishing trips that I asked about the war. We had been laughing and talking about his old war buddy, a crazy old Italian guy named Johnny Courso, who always "lied like a rug", and how he'd been convinced mermaids were real by the tall tales sailors would tell him over drinks on shore leave R and R. How he'd always start telling lies about mermaids once he'd had a beer or two.

Talking about Johnny, I remembered that my grandfather had met him in the war. I started to wonder how someone so loud and full of shit like Johnny could become friends with someone as no-nonsense and comparatively reserved as my Pop. I tried to imagine what kind of circumstances would lead to these polar opposites becoming so close. So I asked about the war. In my naive, eight year old way.

"Why did you guys be friends? What happened in the war, Pop?"

I watched the smile fade from his eyes. As The Look washed all the emotion from his usually smiley, expressive eyes. The Look that came on like stormclouds as he hurriedly changed channels when a war movie was on TV. The Look that robbed the room of energy when someone mentioned his time in the service. Something about The Look that made me a little afraid of him.

With all the power of wisdom of adulthood and hindsight and my own life experience since, I know exactly what that look is now. Shellshock. PTSD. Trauma, carrying an unwilling mind back through the years to a time that is always waiting in the dark for a flash of memory to light it up in the consciousness like the spark that starts the forest fire.

I'll never forget what he said after a seeming eternity of silence while The Look paralyzed his face and our conversation.

"Bubba, I love you so very much. I want you to make Pop Pop a promise. I want you to promise me that you'll never join up. The military is no place for decent boys. I wished I never joined up. I want you to remember that. My time in the military broke a piece of me forever, and that piece can't be fixed. You promise me, Mark."

The seriousness was immediately apparent to me, little boy or not. He only ever called me by my name when the situation was serious. 

The last time he'd called me Mark was when we'd taken his little fishing boat out off the coast of Ocean City. When the stormclouds unleashed great, terrifying waterspouts, lightning, and drenching rain all at once. When the waves started breaking over the bow of our boat as we were still a few miles from shore. When he handed me the bucket and said, " You need to bail out the water lickety split, Mark. Fast as ya can. Keep going and don't stop." That's the first time I reckoned with the idea of my own mortality. It wasn't even Mother Nature's fury that put the fear in me. It was the deadly seriousness in his voice. And his choice of discarding my nicknames in the moment.

I looked into his blue eyes, that day by the pond, and saw them transform. Like a clear summer sky suddenly hidden behind roiling stromclouds, there was a strange, flat light reminiscent of cold steel there. The weight of the thoughts on those eyes just then cutting through the middle of our good day like a lightning strike.

"I promise Poppy. I will never do that." My little kid voice squeaked out the last few words as I felt like I might cry. I knew then never to ask about the war or his time in it ever again. Funny though, I don't remember what the rest of that day was like. 

I picked up pieces of his war experiences through snatches of conversations I listened to over the years. Adults forget sometimes that kids are around, especially back in the eighties. So, sometimes at family gatherings and the like, I would overhear little tidbits of this or that. 

How my grandfather had a brother who came home from the war in a coffin with an American flag draped over it. How he'd lost more friends to shark attacks than to Korean bullets and bayonets. How he came home a different man than the funny, outgoing boy that left home eight years earlier. How afraid he'd been of the water for a decade after. That it took great courage to buy that little boat and brave the Chesapeake Bay with his friend Johnny just to go fishing and reclaim part of his life that he'd always enjoyed before.

I wouldn't get anything resembling the whole story until the cancer had spread from his liver to the rest of his guts and he lay delirious from pain and morphine in the hospital bed as he lay dying.

Before that, the only time he came close to telling me anything was when I'd screamed myself awake from the nightmares that plagued me after the beast chased me and my cousin.

I was ten that summer. I felt almost grown up at the time. I had learned to ride a dirtbike my uncle brought to my grandparents house that summer. It made me feel like a badass as I tore through the trails me and Pop had made through the woods behind his house. Suddenly I was James Dean, the woods were my mean streets and the way the wind made my hair lay flat against my head was like Pop's style too. 

I got my first real gun that summer. No more Red Ryder BB gun for me. I got an awesome 22 rifle that year. Woe to my enemies now! Bottles and cans stood no chance anymore. The promise of squirrel hunting trips coming soon meant I was almost totally grown up.

While my eight year old cousin Mandy still dragged around her Kid Sister doll, I would be a mighty hunter with Pop real soon.

That's why I was so happy that day in late August, as me and Mandy played down by the crick. The weather was perfect too. The grueling heatwave had broken after a violent summer storm the day before and the crick was still a little swollen and cloudy with the stirred up muck.

Mandy was splashing and laughing with me as we pierced the surface of the crick with plastic cups, trying to snatch crawdads from the muddy waters. We had an aquarium in the basement that we were slowly adding to, and crayfish were all that was missing still. 

Everything was perfectly grand and normal right up until it wasn't.

I'll always remember the way things changed so fast. Like a cloud covering the sun. Like a clap of thunder in a clear sky. Suddenly, the speed and volume of the world slowed down.

As I stood on the bank of the creek, time seemed to slow to a crawl. I had time to admire the flickering rainbows that formed between the droplets of water falling from the cup that Mandy held, hovering just above the surface of the water. Seeing the drops causing ripples that slowly spread as concentric rings as the drops fell through air suddenly thick as syrup. The way sounds were first muffled and then distorted, like a record player that had just been blaring music spinning ever slower as the cord was quickly unplugged. As if the bubble of reality around us had mysteriously popped, a dam of The Real World breaking, allowing the flood of a universe composed of nonsense physics to spill through. 

As my mind reeled from the senselessness of the sudden and inexplicable slowdown of time around us, a new, disturbing sound shuddered it's way into my ears. An alien sound, foreign to my experience, something primal and dark and almost...hungry. 

At first, my brain tried to identify it as a pig. It was a low frequency grunting. Almost as if a great prehistoric boar had materialized in that patch of Maryland woods. As the grunting continued, my brain interpreted it as the weird chuffling grunt of a big bear exhaling sharply. It wasn't any of that though. It was the sound of something not of this Earth. Something no living creature makes. 

As long as eternity, yet as quickly as a synapse firing, the speed of the world flickered back to normal. I think it was the electric sizzle of adrenaline shooting from my lizard brain down my spine that broke whatever spell I had fallen under. 
Mandy went from a living statue to something again displaying animal motion. 

The cup fell from her hand approaching the normal speed of gravity at the same time her face started to exhibit the first signs of worry. In that same instant, as something deep in my genetic memory and instinct screamed at me to DO SOMETHING! DANGER! DANGER!, I sprinted the few feet separating me from her and grabbed her wrist. I managed to croak out, "RUN MANDY!" as the terror soup of chemicals flooded my conscious mind.

In that instant, I couldn't have told you what was wrong, just that something DEFINITELY was. I knew we were suddenly in a fight or flight struggle for survival. Something about that terrifying sound alerted that ancient instinct that kept my ancestors alive long enough to pass on their genes down to me.

Mandy seemed as afraid as me, and ran along slightly behind as I nearly dragged her as we ran as fast as our little legs could go. As we ran full tilt boogey in the direction of the house, I kept involuntarily snatching backwards glances to the creek, then the wood line on the opposite bank, and the bushes lining that side of the creek. Some deep old part of my mind knew where the threat was from that terrifying sound alone. It kept shifting my attention that way, like a prey animal fixating on the yet unseen predator.

We probably made it twenty yards into our flight to the safety of the basement door at the back of the house a hundred yards away when I got my first glimpse of the horrible thing making that horrible sound.

"What rough beast, it's hour come round at last, sloughs off to Bethlehem to be born." That phrase shuddered it's way up from my subconscious mind at the sight of that creature . That phrase came, unbidden, into my thoughts from some unknown memory in my little boy brain. 

It was about a one and a half times the size of a bear cub. It had the black, silver tipped hair of a dog/wolf hybrid. The hairs were standing up all over, and shook with the motion of the rippling muscles beneath it. Its overall shape wasn't too dissimilar from a groundhog, except where groundhogs were fat and soft looking, it was hard with muscle and threat.

As it ripped through the dense brush and flew into the creek, it's lower half of fur clung day to itself like an otters fur would. On all fours, it's limbs bent at the elbows, and stuck from its sides as an apes would, and although it's fur was thick, it was easy to see the strength in those limbs.

I'll never be able to forget the strange way it moved. With blinding speed, those limbs bent at the elbows in side to side motions, propelling it forward in a diagonal trajectory. Something very crablike how it scurried a few feet left, then right, but always heading in our direction. I've never seen anything move like that, before or since.

As that terrifying sound left it's terrifying mouth, foamy saliva was blown outward before curving backwards with the speed it was moving. As I ran and kept glancing back, the most standout features were it's alien movement and it's shiny, needle-like teeth. That mouth was all canines and thick white spittle and red lolling tongue. The phrase, "Blood red, it's tongue is blood red," kept speeding through my head. 

As my head whipped from it, back to the view in front of me, I frantically searched for somewhere closer to us than the basement door that could provide safety from the thing. Although by that point we were both screaming and shouting in fear, I knew nobody would hear us. My grandfather was working still that day, and my grandma had just walked some garden vegetables to our neighbors down the road.

As fast as our little legs carried us, I knew it would catch us before we made it into the house through the basement door. I overcame near total panic to survey the yard in front of us for anything that could hide or shelter us. 

Luckily for us that day, my Pop was a bit of a junk hoarder. The backyard was littered with random things. Old cars my uncle had brought over to work on before abandoning. Piles of lumber for construction projects unfinished or unstarted. Random appliances in random states of dissembly, the pieces flung around them in weird orbits. Nothing big enough or strong enough to hide in. Then I saw the old, rusty 1950s era HVAC unit sitting like a junkyard monolith, and the smaller, newer but still broken AC unit leaned against it.

I barely remember how I got Mandy up on top of the littleAC unit before pushing her butt to get her onto the giant old HVAC thing. I'll never forget the sight of the claws swiping the air where my foot had just been as I stepped up onto the top myself though. Or the squealing sound as those claws scrabbled against the metal of the AC unit in its attempt to climb after us.

Something primal took over my mind then, as I kicked at the claws, which were like curved black talons, the size of a grizzlies, and totally out of proportion with the size of the things body. How black and chitinous and gleaming, with what looked all the world like dried blood staining their polished finish. I don't recall finding and grabbing the broken handle to a shovel, just becoming aware of it in my hands as I stared into it's dark, shark-like beady eyes, which rolled around in the sockets, occasionally showing flecks of white as they darted between me and Mandy. All my attention was focused on it's grabbing claws, the play of muscles shaking it's dark pelt, and it's teeth frothing with saliva. And that terrifying grunting sound it kept making. 

I began hitting it with that wooden length of shovel handle. Wet, meaty smacks echoed from the metal we stood on and the trees around us. I remember the foamy saliva gradually turning from bone white to crimson as my repeated strikes started it's gums bleeding.

And then it was gone.

I don't mean it suddenly ran off. I mean it was gone. Poof. Vanished in an instant. A little popping sound and then nothing. No more grunts, no more metal squeal as it's claws rakes the metal, struggling for purchase. Years later, reading a sci-fi book makes me think that popping sound was air filling the void once occupied by an otherworldly creature.

We stood up there, shaking with fear and spent adrenaline, for a few moments, until Mandy finally spoke.

"What was that? What was that bad thing?"

I couldn't find the words. I thought about what we just witnessed. It wasn't like anything I had ever seen before, and I saw a lot of nature's creations. Aside from playing outside and hiking and going all over on vacation, I loved animal documentaries. And I had never seen anything even close to that crazy ass thing. But I didn't need to tell her that and make her more scared.

"I think it was a dog with rabies. We're ok, it didn't bite us." And then I just hugged her until she had the courage to climb down. I didn't know it then, but that's how she would always remember that day. A rabid dog had tried to get us but I saved her with a broken shovel. 

That day continued to play itself out in my nightmares for a few more nights but Mandy had already put it behind her. She always was luckier than me like that.

Later, as I screamed myself awake, it was Pop's turn to come settle me down and get me back to sleep.

"I know I told you that it was probably a rabid groundhog. I know you didn't believe me. I was just trying to calm down your grandmother. But I believe you Bub. I really do. But it can't hurt you. It's gone, back to wherever it came from. You did real good, you saved your cousin. I'm real proud of how good you did. That was smart climbing up that old junk. I'm real real proud of you boy."

I couldn't believe what I was hearing, what he'd just whispered to me, while I lay in that bed damp with my nightmare sweat. My science-trusting, no- mermaids-exist Pop was telling me he believed my impossible story. I loved him with my whole heart just then. 

"I wasn't much older than you, back then, in the war...", he started. He paused and I could tell he was really thinking about just what he wanted to say, " When you're old enough to understand it, I will tell you all I know about these things. I don't know much, but I will tell you all I know. When you're older. You deserve to know. You might need to know. For now, Mark, you just get on back to sleep. You're always safe here. Nothing bad will happen to you here. I love you. Get some sleep." He kissed my forehead and turned out my light and shut the door and I was able to get back to sleep safe in the knowledge that he wouldn't let anybody or anything hurt me. 

The next morning, all I could think about was what he had ALMOST told me. So thinking, my mind quit replaying that narrow escape from that terrible beast, and my nightmares finally ended.

I loved that man with a fierce clarity and purity that I now only hold for my own children. 

I thought about how we used to watch our favorite show together. He and I, and even my grandma, LOVED Unsolved Mysteries. My grandma, just because she thought Robert Stack was cute (eww gross yuck). But we would watch it religiously every Wednesday evening. My grandma was big into the finding a lost family member segments, which I thought were so boring. 

Me and Pop, though, we liked the weird episodes. The UFO ones. The Bigfoot one. The strange disappearances. The weirder the better. I always found it odd that Pop likes those episodes. He was usually the one correcting my grandma's superstitious beliefs, like when she said," When it rains while the sun's out, the Devil's beating his wife," Pop would always correct her and say that the clouds just weren't blocking the sunlight. She'd swear that when you could see the silvery underside of leaves on trees, it guaranteed a storm was coming. Pop just said it was that storms were when it was windiest. 

One time, my grandma told me a story about the ghost of Black Aggie, a ghost who people saw crying while sitting on her tombstone in Baltimore. Pop just said shes full of shit. 

I asked him once why he liked the stranger episodes and he told me this, "Mark, sometimes weird shit happens. It's like there are holes in reality, and sometimes weird shit comes through." It clashed so hard with the rest of his character that I never forgot it. I wouldn't understand where that came from til decades later. By then, he was on hospice, and bedridden.

As he lay dying, reduced to a shade of what he'd been, pieces of my heart withered and died too.
Watching those strong, powerful hands transformed into something weak and shaking as he tried to lift silverware to his mouth, that child still inside me deep down recoiled in shock and sadness. My melancholy filled that hospital room, turning the air redolent with death into something colder and less harsh. As he lay dying, he had something he needed to tell me. I could see the strain as he spoke through the fog of pain and medication.

"I signed up at seventeen Mark. My daddy died the summer before, and Momma was about to lose the house. I watched my brother, in his Navy uniform, kiss her goodbye so he could send enough home to keep a roof over us and I couldn't be more proud. I wanted Momma to feel that proud of me too. My grades were shit, she knew it too, so I figured it was the best thing I could do. My sister Rosemary was too young to work, so I figured I would step up. So I snuck off and did it. That's when it was easy to lie and fake your records. And the recruiters just looked the other way because Uncle Sam needed a constant supply of dummies to pack in their ships and send over there to that terrible place. 

That's how I met ol Johnny Corso. We were placed on the same refueling boat, and his bullshitting and joking helped me through the loneliness of being away from home for the first time in my life. He always had a story or a lie for every occasion and it usually served to get our group's mind off the horrors at hand.

When we were all struck sad after young Billy from Alabama got throwed overboard during a bad swell, he was there to get us laughing with his tales of that Okinawa whorehouse. When that kid from Kentucky lost an arm when our refueling tug clapped against that frigate, he was making him laugh as soon as the morphine kicked in with his stories of GIs getting The Clap from mermaids in Honolulu. When we started getting scared seeing those lights out in the deep waters of the middle of the Pacific, he made me cry laughing saying it was the Polish submariners opening the windows of their subs to let in a breeze down there. 

Those lights are what I want to tell ya about Mark. And what else happened out there in the middle of the ocean, where nobody has any business being. 

I saw some horrible things during that war. But what we went through out on that water filled with killer waves and deep sea monsters was the most scared I ever been. I'm dying, I can feel the cancer chewing me up, but I'm not afraid to die. I'll be with my Momma and your grandma soon. It's the thought of going back to that patch of ocean that scares me. And what is under there.

Me and Johnny were in our bunks in the belly of our ship when were heard a knocking sound. Sometimes guys would rap on their steel walls with a wrench if the watchmen came round, so's you had a chance to stash the hooch or cards or whatever. I knew that sound well by this time. It wasn't that. Because THIS knocking came from the outer hull. Not an interior wall. It came from the outer hull, which, where we were, was about twenty feet below the surface. Unless a frogman got suited up, in the middle of the night, and let himself down there in the dark, shark infested waters to fuck with us, I had no idea what could be doing it.

That sound made me very scared. Until Johnny told me to get nekked cuz the gorgeous mermaids were just trying to invite us out on a date. But our laughing stopped once that knocking started again. 

Since we couldn't sleep, we made our way onto the deck, trying to see if the anchor chain was on our side of the ship, seeing if it was maybe hitting the hull with the rhythm of the waves. But the anchor was up on deck. That's when we got really scared. Especially once we realized that we had a crewman missing. We ran out ship in circles, looking for him, but he was gone. 

The very next night, another man vanished over the side. That night, the seas were as calm as can be. Flat like glass, lit with a full moon. After running circles, manning the searchlights til damn near dawn, we gave up the ghost. Two men down in two nights, without a sound.

Except for that knocking.

The next night, in the mess, I was in a lively discussion about weird shit. Johnny had just done told us all about seeing Foo Fighters lighting up the night and doing flybys of airmen, when someone spoke up about those underwater lights. 

He was saying how, sometimes in the deepest water, the black ocean would suddenly spring to life, as bright, dazzling light would shine up from the depths. Not like bioluminescent fish, but like the sun got lost and went for a deep swim. Spheres made of bright light would dart up from the darkest depths and swim around under the surface. Sometimes they'd dance in the wakes of ships like dolphins. Sometimes, they'd shoot straight up outta the water and streak off into the sky.

All bullshit, that's what I thought then. Until I saw it for myself that next night. The ocean's surface again flat as glass. The moon still full and bright, hardly a cloud up there. About two hundred yards off the bow, I saw a ball of light, seemingly swimming towards our boat. Me and Johnny were up there smoking on one of the lifeboats, just watching out, when we saw it. 

We watched that light swim closer and closer, until we could see it just under our wake, seemingly rising to the surface. I about shit myself when I saw the man-shaped silhouette inside the light.

It looked like the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Not the actor wearing a suit either. Like something man shaped that has chosen to go back in the ocean and had evolved to stay there. With glowing white skin. I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing. And that's when I realized that all the sounds around us had stopped. No waves slapping the steel hull. No motor noise. No yapping Johnny. 

As that thing climbed up the slick, smooth hull with webbed hands, my cigarette fell from my mouth and Johnny clutched onto me like a life preserver. As it's scaly leg swung over the deck, we backpedalled as far as we could till we hit the wall behind us. 

I screamed as the thing grabbed a boy named Luke who had been drinking near the chain railing. No sound came out of my mouth. Or Luke's, even though I could SEE him screaming. I knew right then what that knocking sound had been and I pissed myself.

When they splashed into the water, all the sounds around us got their volume back.

I spent two more terrified weeks on that boat. Me and Johnny spent the next leave in a hospital in Spain, after a deck fire burnt us pretty good. Then we were out of the Navy and flown home. 

It took a long time to go out on the water again. But I would be god-damned if I let fear ruin fishing for me OR you Bubba. Don't you let the fear win either. Sometimes, the reality around us just cracks. Sometimes things slither on through. They don't make no sense, and worrying about them don't help nothing. There ain't no explaining these things. Best to move on. Or it'll just drive you crazy.

That's what you did when you were little. You saw one of those things, and you moved on. It takes a while. It's hard, especially at night when it's quiet and you're alone. But you can. You're mind is stronger than you think."

The nurse came in, to change his bedpan, and that was the end of the story. 

Once she left, he told me he loves me, but he's tired, and could I let him sleep some.

He died two nights later, and I want to believe he's with his Momma and my Mumum. I want to, but I just can't. What universe produces those terrible things can't really be capable of producing a Heaven too, can it? I hope so. I can almost make myself believe it during a great summer day, playing with my kids. But, at night? I know it's not possible.
