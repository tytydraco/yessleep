I live in a big house, not something fancy or expensive, but because it is still too much trouble going to all the places to see if everything is alright. 

And this became ten times worse if I had to check the front yard or the back yard every time. So to save time and energy I just had to get dogs. Not just pet dogs, but actual guard dogs. The big and scary ones that no one dares to challenge. 

In my small town, there aren't that many shelters and even fewer that have big dogs. So getting them was very difficult and unfortunately, at the time now I think if I had any bigger or meaner... I don't want to think about it. In the end, I got two Golden Retrievers.

Not the most fretting dog, but is the training that makes the personality, not the breed. At least that was what I thought. Not even one week after I got them, my house was invaded. They got everything thing, except those stupid dogs that did nothing, but stare at me with their goofy smile like everything was fine.

Then I got online to find a good dog trainer. For the three months after I got trainer after trainer and they did nothing. My dogs were just as stupid and useless as ever, if not even worse.

Then I head to the internet one last time and come across a suspicious website. It was " From pet to killer", now offline of course. I was desperate so even this shady website was appealing and in the worst case, it would be just a scam or at else. After some time I made contact with one guy and he promised me "They will protect their territory in one month or your money back". We exchanged info and he said he would take a day to come.

After a long waiting, he finally got to my home and he said.

"This will take the whole day and I need to be with them alone. So you may as well enjoy your day."

Now I thought this was strange just like anyone who come across my telling. But I had to work and the worst he could do was rob my dogs, and then I would have an excuse for getting new and better dogs.

After that long day of work when I arrived home, they were still as dumb and naive as ever. I just said mentally "another one that can't do shit." But I found a letter in one of their leashes ( they don't have names, I just didn't give a crap about them.) It was written.

" Just give Baal and Lucy here a chance."

"So you have names now... Whatever..."

In the middle of that night, I had a strange dream about being hunted down by two big golden figures, with sharp and long teeth. It felt like I was being reaped apart with every second the pain was getting worse and worse.

I got up at the usual time and when I was checking the house, I found a small mouse dead. It was weird, no animals come to my home, and even fewer to die on. Then I look at Baal and Lucy. ( they now have names, might as well use them.)

"I don't think you guys could protect the house even from a small rodent-like this one."

I went to my job next without giving it any more thought. I really should have. The next few days were the same as usual, until one day I had a weird dream just like the other one, but the golden figures were even bigger and meaner, their eyes were burning with passion and hostility. Just like predators hunting. They toss me from side to side like I was a toy. Every second was very painful, but not enough to wake me up.

I woke up in a pond of my own sweat, I was dirty and completely out of my mind. It took me a few seconds to regain my normal and calm self. Then I proceed with my normal routine, everything was fine and in a moment it was like time frozen in place. I looked at the front yard and... There it was just a rat in my yard... Dead... But it was different... It had bite marks. Oblivious to my previous feeling I for the first time congratulate both Baal and Lucy. This was an error and just made me fear for my life now.

Some time passed by until one day I come home to the greeting of a dead possum. It wouldn't be possible to know it was a possum if it wasn't for the little piece of jaw bone it was left behind and my knowledge of biology. At that moment I actually felt fear. I reluctantly look at Baal just to check if it was them. And there it was small amounts of blood and possum fur. And the worst part... It wasn't like they were wasting it... It was like it was there to show me what they have done.


This time I didn't celebrate them protecting my house. I just ran inside and wait for my unease to cease. This was the only right move I have pulled so far. 

Every day that passed forward I felt more and more nervous about what both Baal and Lucy could do. I made the decision of the next time they kill something to call a friend that knows about dogs to help me out and the next night to my decision I had another dream.

This time the figures were clear to see... They were dogs... Golden Retrievers to be precise made me realize what is happening, I wasn't dreaming I was hearing the animal crying for help and I was materializing in my subconscious and this time it was way...WAY worse. Baal and Lucy weren't just hunting me, or the animals in this case, they were actually torturing the animal.

I woke up crying that day, which isn't normal. I am not the type to have empathy, but that felt so real and so excruciating. I immediately contact my friend and called sick to work.

After two hours with panic in my eyes, I hear her coming. It was a relief really, but a feeling was telling me this wasn't right. I then before greeting her would check both Baal and Lucy and they weren't growling or barking. They weren't moving, they were standing still and waiting for something to happen. Just then I realize and immediately scream to stop.

"DON'T COME NEAR!"

She put a step back just at the right moment so Baal couldn't catch her leg. Then she scolded me.

"What- What the fuck was that! WHY THE HELL DID YOU TEACH THAT!"

"That is the thing I didn't."

After that, I don't know how but I made Baal and Lucy quiet and convinced my friend to come inside. We proceed to talk and she explained to me that she never had seen something like this even in her long year in the shelter.

" We did have aggressive dogs, but nothing so extreme. It is like they were possessed by something."

Then it clicked. I rapidly sent her away and made sure that Baal and Lucy would touch her. Before I could go check on the guy who trained them I saw what was keeping me awake that night, it was a stray cat. 

Now I know they are aiming for bigger things. I had to check if the guy was near or if any information on him at all would help a lot. And just my luck, everything is gone. The Contact, his number, and the site. Fuck even my own memories of the guy are as cold as hell.

My friend come here two days ago and if it wasn't because I had to restock food I think this would even be posted. Ever since she was here I haven't slept or gone to work all because I am fearing they will come for me next, but I had to get food and a lot! So in my one out of the house, Baal and Lucy made the worst thing possible. 

When I was just getting back I saw a guy calling for his dog. I know that guy is from my neighborhood and I know he had Rottweiler almost the size of a wolf, Rottweiler was almost two times the size of Baal and Lucy. But as there's a saying in Brazil "I'm small, but not half. You're big, but not two." In my case, they were actually small and two. I knew, for whatever reason, that his Rottweiler wasn't coming back, but I checked nonetheless and there they were chewing on some dogs' bones. I am just glad I didn't hear the Rottweiler's screams.

I rushed inside feeling safe. Or at least safer than being outside. But the guy from earlier called the cops and they decided to come near my house. That was when I made my worst decision. 

"DON'T COME HERE! YOU WILL BE KILLED!"

Yeah. I scream to cops that they would be killed if they come near... I'm a fucking genius. They obviously come and the moment the first one put their feet in the front yard Lucy ripped their leg. The other cop could have just killed my dogs and made my life easier forever. But just as terrified as I was by the first cop's screams, this other cop couldn't do anything but froze and scream.

Now I'm in the middle of my living room in fetal position writing this with fear of ever taking a step outside.
