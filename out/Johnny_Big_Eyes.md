*I have to let him in.*

I’ve always been cautious, slow to trust—a trait I inherited from my mother. This wariness has left me isolated and has kept me from truly living. For six, maybe seven years, I’ve lived alone on what used to be my parents’ property. It’s hard to keep track; time blurs when your life is confined to isolation. My days consisted of working nine to five in my home office, staring at spreadsheets, scanning documents, and firing off emails. The replies came in, but it was impossible to discern if they’re from real people or just machines. Everything felt cold, mechanical, and disconnected. Besides the occasional delivery driver, no one ever came to my door.

That’s why I remember the first time he knocked.

I recall exactly what I was wearing—only because of how his eyes slowly dragged over me when I opened the door.

“Hello! My name is Johnny Big Eyes.”

He towered over my 5'5" frame, at least a foot taller, standing perfectly straight in his tailored black suit. But it was his eyes—large, unsettlingly large, like something you’d see on a porcelain doll—that held me captive. Oddly, I found them beautiful.

“That’s a lovely dress,” he said, his movements deliberate, almost rehearsed. His hand rose to his chest before extending toward me, a gesture like a man at some formal ball, introducing himself with a flourish.

“Did you say… Johnny Big Eyes?”

He broke into a laugh—a deep, booming sound that vibrated through the air. His head tipped back, yet the rest of him remained eerily still. It was a strange laugh, like a bizarre mix between Santa Claus and a WWE wrestler, the kind of laugh that forced a smile out of me, despite the unease that curled in my gut.

Then, as abruptly as it had begun, the laughter stopped. His head snapped back down to meet my gaze, and he raised a long, strong finger to his eyelid, pointing at the very thing that made his name so unforgettable.

“Some names just stick.”

Without changing the position of his hand, he moved his finger from his face and pointed it toward me, clearly waiting for my name in return.

“I… I’m Jen.”

“Jen! What a lovely name for such a lovely evening!” His head tilted in a strange, almost cartoonish way as he leaned closer. “May I come inside?”

I froze. It was so forward, so bold, and I wasn’t used to that.

“It’s getting late… I… I… no, sorry, not tonight.”

For a split second, his face twisted into a deep frown, his brow furrowed sharply, drawing attention to those unnaturally large, pale blue eyes. But just as quickly, the expression vanished, replaced by that same warm, almost innocent look he had when I first opened the door.

“Not tonight,” he said back to himself.

Without breaking eye contact, he bowed—one arm across his chest, the other behind his back—then turned on his heel. His limbs moved stiffly, joints barely bending, as he walked away with unnervingly long, rigid strides.

“What the fuck?” I whispered to myself in a soft soliloquy as I shut and locked my door.

About a week later, I heard another knock. My front door has tall, narrow windows on either side—clouded glass, opaque enough to obscure details but transparent enough to let the light in. From the shadow that stretched across that fogged glass, I knew instantly—it was him.

Johnny Big Eyes.

"Good evening, Jen!" His voice carried through the door in a cheerful, neighborly tone. I watched his gangly arms wave slowly through the glass.

"Oh, it’s a beautiful night! Not a cloud in the sky!"

I stood five feet back from my locked door, heart racing; the last rays of the setting sun streamed through the windows, casting long, distorted shadows on the floor. His silhouette stretched with the light, unnaturally elongated and warped.

"I know you’re there, Jen." His voice softened, but the way it cut through the door sent a shiver down my spine.

"I know how lonely you are."

I felt my skin go cold as I took an unsteady step backward.

"Just let me in, Jen. I can change everything. For the better." His voice lowered, dripping with something darker. "You miss your mom, don’t you? Your dad? No one to grieve with…"

His words sharpened, a bitter edge seeping into every syllable. "Just so fucking lonely."

His anger seethed through the walls. I couldn’t see him, but in my mind, I imagined his pale blue eyes, wide and furious. My feet felt rooted to the floor, my eyes locked onto the door, waiting for whatever would come next.

Then—BANG.

A single, violent slam of his fist rang against the door. The sound made me jump, and a startled yelp escaped my throat. But just like that—he was gone.

After that, I called the police. I simply told them that a large man had been coming to my door, tormenting me. About an hour later, two deputies arrived—slower than I would’ve liked, but that’s life when you live in the middle of nowhere. My house sits deep in the forest, a good 30-minute drive through winding, wooded roads before you even reach the dirt driveway that stretches for a kilometer up to my property.

The deputies—one a short, stocky man with a thick mustache, the other lanky and bald, wearing a uniform clearly a size too large—went through what I assumed was their standard routine. They asked if I was okay, did a sweep of the area around my house, checked all the locks. Other than a trail of large dress shoe prints leading from the forest, across my porch, and back into the woods, they didn’t find anything.

“If he comes back, call 911,” the mustached one said casually. “Stay on the line until either he leaves, or we arrive.”

And just like that, I was alone again.

Three days later, I finished my work as night fully settled in; the sky illuminated only by a sliver of crescent moon. I went about my usual routine—saved my work documents, threw a frozen meal into the microwave, and changed into my comfy clothes. The house felt unnervingly still. I sat down in my living room, where a small loveseat faced the TV, flanked by two large square windows. Beyond them, the faint outline of the tree line loomed in the darkness.

I turned on the TV, then walked over to flip the light switch by the entrance of the room. The moment I hit the switch, the TV flickered off, and the room was swallowed by darkness.

Then I saw him—a lanky silhouette at the edge of the trees, barely illuminated by the faint moonlight. His shoulders heaved up and down in a strange, almost childlike excitement, his body swaying with each heavy breath.

My heart raced. I edged closer to the window, my fingers fumbling to dial 911, but all I received was static in response.

I looked up from my phone, and that’s when he started sprinting—full speed—toward my window.

A scream caught in my throat as I dropped to the floor and pressed my back against the wall beneath the window. My mind raced, expecting to hear the crash of glass and to feel his long limbs pull me into the night; but there was only silence.

Then, a soft, almost polite *tap tap tap* echoed against the window right above me.

"Jen. You know that I know you're there."

I sat silently, my back pressed against the wall, knees drawn tightly to my chest. Each shallow breath trembled with fear. His voice, soft and sincere, seemed to slip through the window, as if the glass between us didn’t exist.

"We are the same, you know," he said, almost tenderly. "Well, your eyes might be a bit smaller than mine." He let out that strange, unsettling chuckle. "But nonetheless, we are the same."

"We aren't the same," I whispered, my voice barely audible, shaky.

"Oh, but we are, Jen." His voice dropped lower, more intimate, wrapping itself around me. "Before I showed up on your doorstep, who was the last person you saw? What was the last real conversation you had? When was the last time you heard someone else say your name?"

I swallowed hard, trying to steady my breathing. "The deputies, they—"

"They were here because of me." His voice sliced through my words. "You would've never called them if it wasn’t for me. You've shut yourself away for so long. So afraid, so lonely… just like me."

I clenched my hands into fists, nails digging painfully into my palms.

"You’re the first person I’ve talked to in a long, long time, Jen. That dress, the way you stared into my eyes…" His voice deepened, almost intoxicating. "You aren’t scared of me. You love me."

The words hung in the air, clinging to me, trying to take root. *No*, I thought. *This isn’t real. This can’t be real*. But deep down, a part of me felt a crack—the loneliness, the isolation—it was all so familiar, too familiar. His voice made it all feel inevitable; he had been the only excitement in my life for so many years.

"You need me," he whispered. "Just as much as I need you."

My knees loosened slightly from my chest as I stared at the dark floor beneath me. I imagined how I would start my routine like normal the next morning, and then the next, and then the next, and then the next.

"Let me in. Let me in right now. If not, I’ll leave forever. You’ll never see my big eyes again." His voice softened, almost pleading. "But you can let me in, Jen. I can change your life."

I stood up slowly and turned toward the window. He was there, waiting, his face shrouded in shadow, but his eyes—they cut through the darkness, locking onto mine. From his crouched position outside, he rose with an unnatural fluidity, his gaze never wavering.

I clenched my fists and swallowed my fear. Any change had to be better than none.

"Come inside, Johnny."
