We were just a stupid group of friends. Tom, Ezekiel, Sarah, and me, Ethan—always getting ourselves into trouble in our little town on the outskirts of Serbia. It was freezing most of the time, the kind of cold that made your breath hang in the air, but we didn’t care. 

We were young and dumb, ignoring the warnings of kidnappings from our school, convinced it could never happen to us.

One day, as we walked home, Tom, with his usual reckless grin, suggested we check out an old abandoned house at the edge of town. The place was infamous—it had once been home to a man who was discovered to be a serial killer. The guy had been dead for years, but the rumors about him still spread like wildfire. I didn’t want to go. Something about it felt... wrong. But the dares started, and I caved, like I always did.

The house was worse than I imagined. The windows were boarded up, but inside, it looked like the remnants of a forgotten past. Old, broken furniture, faded wallpaper peeling off the walls—there was something eerie about how untouched it seemed. Each room carried an unsettling silence, like the house had been waiting for us. 

It didn’t take long for us to get bored, though. That’s when Tom suggested we check out the basement. My stomach twisted, but I followed them. The stairs creaked beneath our feet as we descended into the pitch-black basement. Our flashlights cut through the darkness, revealing strange things: books scattered on the floor, and markings that looked like remnants of some black magic rituals. I remember thinking that maybe the stories were true—that the killer wasn’t just a murderer but something worse.

We debated what to do next when, suddenly, Tom collapsed. One moment he was standing, the next, he hit the floor like a sack of bricks. I barely had time to react before Ezekiel fell too. Sarah let out a rasping cough, collapsing next, her eyes wide with fear. Panic surged through me, but I couldn’t move. My vision blurred, and I was the last to hit the ground.

When I finally woke up, there was a light, harsh and flickering, shining down on me. My body ached, and when I tried to move, I realized my wrists were chained. As my eyes adjusted, I saw the others—Tom, Ezekiel, and Sarah—chained beside me. We were all awake now, disoriented and terrified.

"I’m so hungry," Tom whimpered. Ezekiel groaned in agreement.

"Where are we?" I asked, my voice shaking. 

No one answered. Instead, the sound of footsteps echoed from above. The basement door swung open, and down came a figure. My blood ran cold. It was him—the man who was supposed to be dead, the serial killer. His skin was pale, his eyes sunken and lifeless, but he was very much alive.

"Good morning, children..." His voice was a gravelly whisper that sent chills through me.

Tom screamed, "You’re supposed to be dead!"

"You’re not real!" Sarah cried, her voice breaking.

The old man just smiled, a twisted grin spreading across his face. "Death fears me. The devil is my servant."

What followed was worse than any nightmare I could’ve imagined. He spoke of his rituals, the sacrifices, the murders he’d committed in the name of something darker than death itself. His words were graphic, horrific—a sick confession of years of torment and bloodshed. When I begged for him to let us go, he just smiled again.

"You must be hungry," he said, tossing a knife onto the floor in front of us. "Feed yourselves." 

With that, he left, locking the door behind him with a sharp, ominous click.

Days passed. Maybe weeks. The hunger gnawed at us like a beast inside. There was a window in the basement, but it was boarded shut, and though our chains weren’t connected to anything, we couldn’t escape the room. Ezekiel was the first to break. He collapsed, gasping for breath, and within minutes, he was dead.

We were starving. Tom looked at Ezekiel’s lifeless body and suggested something I’ll never forget. "We have to survive," he said, holding the knife. "We have to eat."

I screamed at him, horrified, but he didn’t listen. He carved into Ezekiel’s flesh and started drinking his blood, the metallic scent filling the room. Sarah and I retched, vomiting in the corner, but eventually, we couldn’t fight it anymore. Tom offered us pieces of Ezekiel, and though I swore I wouldn’t... I did.

I don’t know how long we lasted like that. Days blended into weeks. The room was a mess of blood and rot. One day, I woke to find Tom unconscious and Sarah unchained. She stood up, her eyes vacant, and told me she was going to find help. She made it halfway up the stairs when something—an unseen force—threw her back down. Her neck snapped with a sickening crack.

*I screamed for Tom, but he didn’t wake up.* 

I was alone now, hungry, terrified, losing my mind. It must’ve been months since we disappeared. I didn’t want to die, but the hunger was unbearable. I picked up the bloody knife and dug into my friends. I didn’t want to, but I had to survive.

The old man returned, watching with sick satisfaction. "You’ve done well," he said. "Now, you’re ready."

But I wasn’t. Not for him. I stabbed him as he turned, plunging the knife into his back, and ran. My heart pounded in my chest as I reached the stairs. When I grabbed the door handle, I expected it to be locked. But it wasn’t. It opened easily. 

The realization hit me like a sledgehammer: we were never trapped. The door was never locked. We could’ve left at any time. We were too blind, too scared, too stupid to try. 

I ran, faster than I ever had, all the way home. When I finally found my parents, they didn’t believe me. No one did. *They told me that I had been missing for five years*. Five years of my life gone, and the police found nothing when they searched the house.

Now, I’m here, in a psychiatric hospital, writing this down. No one believes me, but I know the truth. He’s still out there.  *It’s only a matter of time before he finds me again.....*
