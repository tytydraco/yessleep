If you knew how much it pains me that I'm having to write this...

I wouldn't do it at all if I wasn't already convinced you'd never hear about it otherwise. Trust me, some shit's better left forgotten. People aren't, though. *Especially* not these people.

It was around Black Friday back in 2001 that I heard about it during lunch at school. "Christmas City", this year's end-of-semester big show. For whatever reason, Willow Wood high had this thing about having to show off the theater kids' performances with the same damn show. Seriously, every year, it was always the same goddamn show.

I tried at one time to ask if we could maybe, just maybe, do a show of, oh, I don't know, maybe the Christmas Carol or something. Of course, that was quickly shot down with the classic *"It's tradition, Joshua. You're REALLY gonna break TRADITION?!"*

Yeah, in case you couldn't tell, staff at my school were the cheeky, preppy types. Everyone's special in their eyes and every thing that happens must have a cosmic purpose. "Hippies" basically, although I'm pretty sure only the janitor and my art teacher, Mrs. Crowler, were actual druggies. In any case, yeah, annoying as all hell, as you can imagine, I'm sure. I was never really sure, but I think the story goes as to why they'd always insist on this particular play every year was because of the little urban legend, one of many here in Weeping Willow N.C., about this kid named Thomas.

Thomas was a peasant boy here in the late 20th century and was never able to celebrate Christmas. Poor son of a bitch was an orphan and a runaway from an abusive adoption home. He lived, as the story goes, under streetlamps, park benches, and supposedly spent a few nights in the dumpsters. As you can imagine, he didn't get much to eat every night, nor was he ever protected from the elements, having nothing on him but the raggedy clothes on his back. You can probably guess where this all ends for poor little Tommy-boy, can't you?

One Christmas Eve night, just before succumbing to his fate, though, he met this stranger in black, who made him a deal. "Give thy soul to me", he was said to have said to Thomas, "And I'll make sure no one ever forgets thee." Given how long he'd lived on the streets by that point, watching everybody else merrily walk by without paying him any kind of attention or care, Thomas happily takes the stranger up on his offer. They shake hands, Thomas dies on the spot, right there in the middle of the downtown sidewalk, and it was said from a few passersby that the screams of at least 1,000 children echoed all throughout the street that night.

Now, I'll say right now that at least half of that story was true. Kind of like the tale of the *Flying Dutchman*, there really was a kid in this town by the name of Thomas Thatcher who ran away from home, and lived on the run until he died at the age of 7 on the street on Christmas Eve, 1898. There's even the newspaper article in our museum of Thomas's body being found that night. But that's where concrete fact ended, and speculative fiction began.

Again, I never understood where this whole business of "tradition" began with this story. I mean, sure, it was tragic what happened to the poor kid, don't get me wrong, but why was it so important that it warranted constant commemoration like that? What made Thomas Thatcher's story so important that we needed to memorialize it on a stage every year?Well... I found out, and GOD how I wish I could take it all back. Just go back to living blind, you know? "Ignorance is bliss", right?

So, yeah, I heard they were announcing auditions for the show for the next week for all the theater kids. My first reaction to this was *"Oh dear God, why?"*

If you're thinking to yourself "Well why don't I just NOT sign up for auditions", then you clearly, yet understandably, don't get how it works at Willow Wood High. If there's a play or performance, and you're in either elective: Band, Chorus, and/or Theater, then you have no choice but to audition, lest you risk tanking your grade. And if you're wondering why I wouldn't just willingly take that "L" and cut my losses, then again, you clearly, yet understandably, don't understand how it works in my house. I bring home anything less than a high, maybe a mid B (The "Mid" being only if they felt generous), then I lost all privileges for at least the next month or so.

"They're still doing this, man," my buddy, Vern, exclaimed, gawking at the audition poster."Yeah," I sighed, trying to use the taste of the half-baked psuedo-pizza they slapped on my tray to drown out the thoughts of getting onstage again for this."Damn man. I'm telling you, they're trying to start a new trend on TV with this shit."

"Yeah, well, they keep it up, they might. Hell, I know at least half of them'll be filming it. Who knows?" I remember grinning then, the thought of something happening, something funny, and the footage making onto America's Funniest Home Videos.Something else I'll say right now, when people tell you to "Not let the intrusive thoughts win", FUCKING LISTEN TO THEM!

Anyway, so the bell rang, signaling the end of lunch, and me and Vern split. He headed back to Third Period English, while I reported to the theater room for auditions. It was about the same way you'd always expect this sort of thing to go; they hand you a couple of sample scripts, tell you to recite them in a certain way, then pass you along. That's the one good thing about audition days, they're the shortest days in that class, and the rest of the time was yours to fuck away however you saw fit until the next class. I remember actually trying to act horribly, hoping maybe they'd cut me out of the program. Of course, when the lines you get are, at most, 10 words, and there's only about three or four of these, I guess it takes an extra talent in of itself to act so badly they don't bother with you, doesn't it?Either that, or its own "Christmas Miracle", or whatever. Whatever the case, I had neither "extra skill" enough or dumb luck on my side and yeah, I found out at dismissal that day that I was picked to be, who else, but poor little Thomas himself.

Great, a play I didn't wanna fuckin' be in, one that, as far as I knew, had no point whatsoever, and I had to be the leading man.

Like I said, no luck or "special skill" here.

They passed me a copy of all my lines and stage directions, telling me to practice them as much as possible that night, and that rehearsals would begin that following morning. I took one brief glance at the paper, and realizing that I had maybe 30 lines total-- most of which, by the way, were literally only two words-- I figured I wouldn't sweat the performance that much, you know? Sure, as the lead, most of the attention would be on me, but then again, with so little needed from my character, its not something I would've been too worried about getting screwed royally. The only line(s), I figured, that really needed to be commemorated to heart, was the ending monologue, which was, more or less, Thomas's curses to God and the world for his ill-fated existence-- standard evil ghost type of shit, you know?

It was a long one, too, spanning at least a page and a half. Not only that, but making things that much more complicated was the fact that it was spliced up here and there with various stage directions and prompts, which I was also expected to have memorized. Now, I have to say, if I hadn't been passionate about being an A-list actor one day at the time, I'd have easily brushed all of this shit off and not even bothered trying to memorize any of it or anything. But *no*, I had to commit, didn't I?

I spent the rest of that night practicing that monologue, all the way until it hit about 10:45 that night. With barely any breath left, and my head feeling like it was going to explode if I even thought about trying to recite any of it even one last time, I finally called it a night. Here's the thing, despite this, I wasn't tired. Aching, sore, maybe, but not tired.I had no energy, either. I didn't even want to hop on the PS2 and fuck around with Tony Hawk till I fell asleep like I normally would on a week night. I was wide awake, yet bone-tired at the same time. Ain't that a bitch?

Thing was, my mind couldn't get off of one thing: "Christmas City". More specifically, I couldn't get my mind off of the whole "Curse of Thomas Thatcher" thing. That's when my dumb ass had the brilliant idea to do like all bored, insomniac teenagers did, and try and find a ghost story to occupy my mind enough to maybe shut it down.

It took forever-- keep in mind, this was still in the days of dial-up. No Ethernet or WLAN cables yet-- but I did manage to search for any articles here in Weeping Willow pertaining to Thomas and/or his supposed "curse". Obviously, there weren't many, given that online forums weren't as populated or frequented back then as they are now. In fact, in this case, I only found two; one, if you account for the fact that, when I attempted to access it via the browser, it redirected me to an "Error 404" page.

On the flip side of this argument, though, the other one I found, not only worked, but also contained the most in-depth analysis of the life of Thomas Thatcher. I read that Thomas was a small boy who'd immigrated back to the U.S. after the civil war. According to the article, his mother was something of a wise woman or witch here in town, and his father enlisted in the Union army. He never made it home alive.Reading about his mother caught my attention. What if, perhaps, there was a way I could see for myself, just to see, if this kid really was a product of "Paranormal phenomenon"? I found and decided to google search the entire thing. Like I said earlier, early as times were, information like this was sparse at best. This meant that trying to search for any real answers, was a fruitless effort.Next on the list of research topics was "Is the curse of Thomas Thatcher real?"

Aside from a few posts, across multiple chat boards, all of which were quickly devolved into drawn-out debates concerning the whole debacle; one side saying it's true, and about a thousand-plus others saying it isn't. The one of these that stood out to me, though, was the one listed "Christmas City' murder".

Not wasting a single second, I clicked the post and began skimming though. It was a short post, only a couple of paragraphs long, more or less detailing how two kids who performed this play were found dead, emaciated and dehydrated, mysteriously. No perp was ever caught, nor were there any real eyewitness testimonies, given the bizarre nature of their deaths.The comments section tried asking for further details, but the author never got back to them on it. Rereading the post again, I was pretty sure they weren't speaking from any personal experience when they wrote it, but rather, were simply trying to post about something they found, maybe in the papers or a magazine or something. Of course, that led me to wondering just what paper or article were they reading this shit from?

Sadly, that's where my search for the night was forced to end, with fatigue finally catching up to me, finally making me tired physically, as well as mentally. I figured I could hit up the corner store on my walk back from the bus stop on the way home the next day and ask Mr. Randall there if he could tell me anything about it.  Mr. Randall was always one to regale customers, especially younger ones like me and my friends whenever we'd stop in, with old stories about Ol' Willow here.

I stopped in, grabbed a couple of honey buns,a coke, and went to pay when I asked him about it all. I remember his first reaction being cocking his eyebrows at me. "Thomas Thatcher, huh," he asked, "The hell you wantin' to know about him for?"

"Well, we keep performing his story for Christmas every year, but... Well, I want to know how come everyone's so afraid to quit."

He looked me up and down several good times before taking a deep breath. I shrank down a little, like a kid who'd just asked his dad to play with the rifle he'd found in the gun cabinet by mistake. "To keep it simple, son," he began, pausing for a moment to stare at me again, making sure that I was paying him the utmost attention. "Ol' Tommy-boy was a poor son of a gun who ran away from home, and died trying to stay away."

"I know that, but what about the curse?"

"Curse?" His eyes tripled in size, his eyebrows shifting.

"Well, I thought I'd read somewhere--"

"Online?" he asked, annoyed-sounding. I continued.

"That the reason everyone does that stupid play is because bad things have happened whenever they didn't."

Mr. Randall sighed. "Let me tell you somethin' sport, I've seen many things here in this town. I've done seen and "read about'", He used air quotes when he said this, "a slew of different "curses", hexes, whatever you wanna call 'em. Not once, though, have any of them been connected to Thomas Thatcher."

"Well what about his mother?"

"What about her?"

"Is it true she was a witch, here in Ol' Willow?"

"Hell, son, I don't know. Like I said, seen and read about all sorts of crazy things happenin' in this little town. I will say, though, that if you're looking for a witch, this town used to be full of 'em back in that time."

"Really? Like *actual,* evil witches?"

"I said witches." He pointed his index finger at me, narrowing his eyes, "*You* said evil."

I gulped, hanging my head down low, and said "Right, sorry about that."

His body relaxed a bit after that and I looked back up at him. "But yes," he continued in his normal, friendlier tone, "There were *"actual witches"* in this town back in the day. A whole coven, in fact. Got pretty popular, too."

"But you don't know if Thomas Thatcher was a part of it?"

"Probably was." He laughed and added "Shit, if I was him and *I* needed money like that, then yeah, I'd probably start looking into witchcraft myself, you know?"

I shrugged. Grabbing my stuff and handing him a $20 bill, I told him thanks and went on my way back home. That time was spent figuring out how I was going to prioritize my time in figuring out what Mr. Randall told me, and how long I needed to practice my lines for the play for.

I decided on practicing the lines for about thirty to thirty-five minutes, then spending the rest of the time searching online for articles about the coven that used to roam my town. Turned out, I ended up mastering the whole monologue after about only ten of those thirty minutes, but kept with it to *really* get into the character, you know?

Oddly, though, I found that the more I went and repeated the lines, the more I... I...

Well, I don't know, I guess *bonded* with the part.

I know, that makes no sense. Let me break it down like this. You know how when you used to play with a baby doll when you were little? You'd feed it, sing to it, maybe even change it, depending on the type of doll, and you'd know it was just that: a doll. But the longer you play with it, the longer you do all the things I mentioned with it, you can't help but start thinking of the doll as more than just a doll, like it *might* just be an actual infant?

That's a lot of what I'd started feeling when I practiced that script that night. Each time I repeated the lines, I noticed myself actually feeling lost, lonely, broken inside, similar to how Thomas Thatcher was said to have felt all those years ago. I think it was when my eyes started welling with tears and a hole had seemingly been opened up in my stomach, that I finally called it wraps on that for the night.

After that, I began my internet search for "Coven in Weeping Willow". Immediately popping up was a picture of a group of women, standing in a circle in the woods. They all wore red, and the circle they stood around was the same color. At first, I though this couldn't be it, though. I'd heard of them before, the "Sisters of the Red Circle", up in Grenview Pines.

I kept scrolling for about ten minutes and found nothing, so I decided then to search for Thomas's mother. Turns out her name was Maria. Her last name, if she had one on record anywhere, wasn't mentioned anywhere online, but it was said she was something of an outcast when she was outed as being a witch. That, in fact, was why Thomas was taken from her and put into a foster family. Apparently witchcraft was seen as child abuse back then.

Supposedly, it came from a disgruntled client of her's when she failed to relieve her of some illness with her charm and herbs. They turned her over to the police, who broke down her door, dragged her out of the house, took Thomas away, and exiled her, threatening her under pain of death to never return. It was said that when they found her, she was in the act of "communing with spirits", as they termed it in the article. It made no mention, though, of any sort of curses or spells cast upon the town when they threw her out, but instead mentions that certain eyewitnesses have said they still saw her occasionally, roaming the wooded areas just outside of the town's borders.

Contradictory, too, to what I'd mentioned earlier, when I got a look at one of the "Supposed sightings of Maria the witch", It showed her wearing a red cloak, just like the Red Circle photo. That got me wondering then, what was she doing with them, and how come Mr. Randall didn't mention that? Then again, he didn't know that Maria *was* a witch (apparently... Not entirely buying that, to be honest), nor has he ever spoken about Grenview Pines, so maybe he *wouldn't* know, would he?

I figured the next best place to look was the Sisters of the Red Circle themselves. Not a whole lot was found on them, though, aside from newspaper headlines detailing their ritualistic murders. Nothing about their practices, rituals, nothing. In fact, at least 3/4 of the articles present were, more or less, just a bunch of online threads, debating on whether or not the Sisters were even real, just like with the "Curse of Thomas Thatcher" search.

My eyes, by that point, were starting to hurt from staying open for so long, staring at my computer screen, so I decided to pack it all in for the night, but not before bookmarking a particular article on Google, depicting yet another photo of Maria. I went to sleep then, and let me tell you, it was anything but peaceful. It started off well enough, but gradually began to shift.

At first, I wasn't experiencing anything, which is usual for me. I never was much of a dreamer. Then, I remember hearing at least three or four voices all screaming out at me. When I say screaming, I don't really mean "screaming", if you know what I mean. It was less screams of agony, and more of like a choralization of some sort. It made me think at the time that I was in the middle of a court of angels, all singing to me.

Thing was, it wasn't exactly singing, either. It was so weird, but I swore I could hear them all crying, drawing out their sobs to make the unified choral sound I described. There were no words, no verses, nothing. Eventually, I began to make out the shapes of figures in white, materializing out of the void around me.

They all formed around me, surrounding me from all sides. At my left, my right, above, and even below me, they all appeared, their hymns escalating in a steady crescendo. I couldn't make out any of their features, if they had any at all that could've been made out. They were, more or less, large white blobs, singing at me.

I remember not being able to move. Stranger than this, I wasn't at all put off by this either. It was like all life had basically left me. I was a husk, a bag of bones and muscles, bound in a sack of flesh, devoid of personality or humanity at all. As more and more of them appeared, they started converging on me. Their hymn grew louder and louder with each inch they gained.

In an odd sort of way-- and this was even true for a time after I'd eventually woken up-- I grew very quickly to find the tune comforting. Obviously not something I'd listen to by choice on a regular basis, but not something I'd entirely be put off by either, at least not immediately. In fact, the longer and longer I listened to it, the more and more I found myself sort of bonding with it. Just like how I described earlier, I started feeling some sort of connection with the tune.

It wasn't a happy one, of course. It dripped with grief, sorrow, regret, and a few others I can't really describe right now. All the same, like the music it was, I found it touching me in ways I never really imagined. Once they had me surrounded, the chorus collectively rang out a high note that, normally, should've and would've broke my eardrums completely. That's when I remember waking up.

I felt completely disoriented, like I'd been spun around in my bed while I was sleeping. I couldn't tell if I was going to throw up or not. Because of that, against Ma's wishes and myriad of pleas, I ended up skipping breakfast and shambling out to the bus stop. The whole bus ride was spent in a daze. I thought about trying to open a window, mostly in the event my queasy stomach decided to turn itself over and I needed somewhere to blow chunks, but then something even freakier happened.

For whatever reason, the thought of me opening the window also elicited the thought of jumping out of it as well.

That stopped me dead in my tracks. I remember staring at the window for a good five or so minutes, at least. Why *this,* of all things, was coming to me as an even halfway serious thought, I didn't know, but it did, it scared the hell out of me. Look, I'm not at all suicidal, even now, after what all had happened with all of this, and I never have been and never will be. But right then, dizzy and nauseous, feeling like I was completely empty, the thought of *that* sounded more and more appealing by the second. It's worth mentioning, too, that while this was happening, in the back of my mind, I thought I could hear the chorus from the dream the night before, this time with the distinct sound of a little boy sobbing, accentuating itself among the hymns.

Once we got to school, I remember spending the first three or four out of the ten minutes we have before the bell rings, in the bathroom, hunched over the commode. I tried to throw up, but all I got were dry-heaves. Once the bell rang, I trudged as fast as I could to my first period class. I'll say right now that I was grateful as all hell that there were no upcoming exams for at least another couple of weeks, because if there *was* anything important being discussed that day, I wouldn't have known. I couldn't keep my head up, my eyes open, for more than about four or five seconds before drifting off to sleep again, and after about the tenth time of this happening, I finally gave up and just stayed asleep.

I managed to wake up when the bell for second period rang, where I trudged my way there and, more or less, repeated the same story there as with the previous class. It was here, though, that I wasn't allowed by the teacher to slide with snoozing during class, and so I was forced to explain what was going on, the best way I knew I could. They told me to go down to the nurse's office and handed me a hall pass.

The nurse took my temperature, tested my reflexes-- you know, all the usual shit-- and determined that, aside from the high temperature and moderately slow reflexes, I was fine. Her diagnosis was insomnia, and you know, I'd have agreed with her-- except that I *was* asleep. Not only that, but last night was the first night in at least a year that I'd even stayed up late. Normally, my ass is in bed by 10:00, 10:45 at the *absolute* latest. I told her this, and she replied that there weren't any other real explanations she could come up with.

She asked me what I'd eaten last, to which I told her about the honey buns I'd picked up from the corner store. She asked me if I'd just started feeling bad that morning, to which I replied that I had. In the end, I was given an ice pack to hold against my head and told to try and make it through the rest of the day, and if I couldn't, they'd call my parents to come get me. By that time, it was lunch, and I figured maybe something on my stomach might just be what I need.

Well, despite it being deluxe pizza day, I couldn't stomach any of it. For some reason, looking at food made my stomach feel both empty and queasy at the same time. I remember looking at it and feeling like I hadn't eaten in over five days. I felt like this was the last chance I might have at eating.

All of a sudden, the lines to the monologue began playing back to me. They began sounding less and less like my own voice, though, and more and more like the voice of a little boy whom I'd never met before. In this, I started to feel dizzy again. When I tried stumbling into the bathroom, feeling my stomach twisting itself into at least seven different knots, screaming at me as it did so, it was all I could do to even stay upright and not tumble down face first onto the floor of the cafeteria.

The lines began looping in my brain. Each step I took seemed to do so in accordance to the rhythm being set by the recitals. In the midst of all this, too, each time the lines looped, a heaviness in my heart weighed down more and more. It felt each time like someone was dragging down on my heart from my stomach.

Imagine if sadness itself, if there was a personification of sorrow, if it could make a sound. That's what this was: pure, unfiltered anguish and misery. The voice, whom I could only guess was supposed to be that of Thomas Thatcher himself--although how I could be hearing his *actual* voice, if I indeed was, was anyone's guess-- sounded monotone, with an underlying sort of somber tone behind it all. It's confusing, I know, but if you can remotely imagine all of that, then you have at least a clue as to the state of my mind at the time.

I made it all the way to the Boy's bathroom before I ended up crumpling to my knees, right there in front of the door. I clutched my stomach. Both it and the voices in my mind were screaming at me all at once. The recitals were now deafening and I could feel tears burning in my eyes.

My heartbeat was echoing inside my ears and I couldn't concentrate on anything happening in the world around me. I could feel myself slipping unconscious more and more by the second. By the time darkness had engulfed me fully, I was writhing on my back, just outside the bathroom door. Everything went black then, and I was out cold. No sounds, no voices, no nothing.

I was shaken awake a few minutes later (it felt longer than a "few minutes", but the bell didn't ring for about another five minutes after I woke up, so... yeah), by the assistant principal, who went and escorted me to the office, calling my parents. When they arrived, I filled them in on the situation and they resolved to take me to the doctor's office.

On the ride there, I heard, faintly, Thomas's voice continue echoing in my head. I wasn't sure why, but the longer this went on for, the more and more detached from reality as a whole I became. I remember essentially going numb all throughout my body. I was a statue, strapped in the back of the car, or at least I thought I was. When I looked up at the rear view mirror, I found Dad's eyes frowning at me.

"The hell're you going on with back there?" he asked me. For a second, I couldn't answer him. The numbness seemed to affect my speech and my thinking, because I remember my mind being little more than a blank, white cloud. It wasn't until my mom looked back at me with a worried expression plastered all over her face that I snapped out of whatever spell I was apparently under, and asked him what he was talking about.

"You was mutterin' somethin' back there," he told me, "What's up?"

"I... I don't..." I was at a loss. What the hell was he talking about?

"I heard you, too," Ma chimed in.

"I don't know what you're talking about, honest." They both continued giving me the "cut the bullshit" stare for about another thirty seconds before we ended up pulling up to the doctor's office, effectively ending the discussion right there. It was relatively quick, only about ten minutes, before the doctor came to see me.

I explained to him everything that'd happened at school, as well as the basic shit like what the school nurse had asked me before: what I'd eaten, was I hydrating, sleeping, etc. He took my temperature and blood pressure and tested my reflexes. All of it checked out, again, aside from a slightly higher than normal temperature and extremely slow reflexes. He asked me if I'd been taking any sort of meds or using any hard drugs, both of which I answered "Hell no" to with a chuckle. I've never been a druggie.

He asked me a few other questions, too, like if I'd been making friends okay at school, how my grades were looking, all in a monotonous, yet still friendly enough voice. I replied that I was to both. When I told him about my sleep schedule, the same I'd mentioned earlier, he asked me if I'd pulled any all-nighters lately.

I told him about how late I'd stayed up the night before, which was still only about 12:30 a.m. He looked at his computer, clacking away for a moment before getting up, announcing that he was going to "look a few things over", as he put it, and that he'd be right back shortly. About 20 minutes rolled by then in silence.

Well, sort of "silent".

Silent for the rest of the world, that is. For me, though, it was anything but. The speech came back, and this time, even Mom and Dad shaking me, shouting for me, which I couldn't even really hear over the sounds of the voices, couldn't bring me back to reality this time. I couldn't even bring myself to *force* myself back into conscious thinking. Whatever this was, had complete mastery over my senses.

Something I feel like I should clarify real quick, these voices, they didn't sound like what you might be expecting. I know I said earlier that they sounded like a chorus, and they still did here, but there was also a sense that someone was speaking. A little boy, speaking in front of a crowd of some kind.

Trust me, I get it. I'm honestly surprised if you've made it this far without calling me a quack. I'm telling you, though, I'm doing the best I can here.

Well, anyway, right up to the point where I was somehow snapped back to reality by a light being shined in my eyes by the doctor, who'd returned, bringing a physician with them. I remember being disoriented at first, like I was just waking up from a really long nap.

"Joshua", said the doctor, "I'd like you to meet Dr. Tritt. He's our physician, and he's going to take a look at you with me for a moment, alright?"

"O-Okay..." I answered, again, barely conscious. Dr. Tritt slipped two gloves on and had me open my mouth and he shined the light. He looked for barely two seconds before he stopped and had me lean my head to one side. Then he took about ten minutes, looking, poking, prodding, and digging around in both of my ears. It didn't hurt, not really, but I'll say that it felt a little violating in a way.

He stopped at one point, I remember, and waved over the doctor and I could hear the both of them whispering something back and forth to one another. Couldn't tell you what, but it was something. While this was happening, the voice of the little boy continued echoing in the back of my head, sobbing about something. Like the two in front of me, I could tell he, too, was trying to say *something*, but not *what*.

Finally, I was allowed to straighten my head back up. "Well," said Dr. Tritt, "There's no signs of infection, though I did find something interesting while I was looking around in there." He turned and slipped his gloves off, throwing them away. He looked back at me, narrowing his eyes, and said "You've got some sort of growth there, deep in the canal of your ears."

My eyes stitched themselves wide open.

"What are you talking about?!"

"Well..." He turned and pulled down a diagram of an ear canal. He pointed to the cochlea and said to me "You see that, right there?"

I nodded my head.

"Well, that's where everything your mind interprets as whatever sound you're hearing at the time, as sound."

"Okay..."

"But when I looked in your right ear, I found a small little growth or something here..." He pointed then to the canal itself.

"What is it?" I asked, knowing good and damn well that, if he knew, he'd have probably told me by now, rather than continue calling it some weird-ass shit like "little growth". He smiled and told me he wasn't sure yet and that he'd not seen anything like it before.

"It's not likely cancer," he mentioned, "so you don't need to worry about that. I would say that it is likely having some sort of effect on your hearing, though."

"Is it something harmful?" asked Ma.

"Not sure yet," he told her. "About the only real way to tell is to run an MRI, see up close and personal."

She and Dad looked at each other for a moment. Ma's face was worried sick, while Dad's was more confused than anything. They turned back eventually and nodded. "We'll do it."

"Excellent." He turned to the doctor then and told him to go ahead and schedule the MRI for the following Monday at 7:00 A.M. Then they both turned and left the room once again. I looked at Ma and Dad, blank and cold, and they looked at me, anxious, afraid of me almost.

It was a weird feeling, but it was almost like I knew they were afraid of me. I knew it, and I was *proud* of it.

I didn't get it then, and I still don't entirely now, but then and now, it scared me a little.

The doctor came back again about twenty minutes later and told us we were good to go, telling us that the appointment at the hospital had been set for the next morning. We left the room and went home after that. Strangely, *that* was when all of the noise stopped.

The entire car ride, I couldn't hear anything except the world around me. That is to say, there still wasn't much to hear there, either. Neither Ma nor Dad felt much for words on the trip home, to me or each other. Occasionally, I caught Ma stealing worried glances back at me through the rear-view mirror. Her eyes each time looked closer and closer to wanting to break into tears.

When we got home, I immediately hopped out and went inside. My mind was on autopilot. One track, one goal in mind, and that was to simply go and bunker myself into my room. I couldn't have told you why exactly; maybe it was stress, exhaustion, confusion, or a mix of the three, and many more, but I wanted nothing more than to lock myself away and pass out.

I didn't even make it to my bed, in fact, before I passed out. It didn't even feel like I had. Just before my face would've met the bed, I wasn't even standing in my room anymore.
