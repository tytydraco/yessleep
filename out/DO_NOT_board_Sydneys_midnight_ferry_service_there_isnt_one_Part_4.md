Do you fear the water? I do. Of all the phobias which exist, I imagine this one is among the most common a lot of us share. I invite you to imagine just how it felt for me in that moment. Picture yourself in a deep, yet relatively safe body of water. Maybe a diving pool. You look down to see your legs dangling above the bottom of the pool, 16 feet down. Not scared yet? Okay… now imagine the complex is empty, it’s night time. You watch as the lights are all switched off one by one, and suddenly you are alone. All you can hear is the gentle swish of the water, and perhaps now there are subtle thoughts nagging at the back of your mind. Is the bottom still there? Which way is out? What’s underneath me?

Now, take away the swimming complex, you’re not there anymore. No, now you’re floating in a lake. It’s not huge, you can see the shoreline, and it’s only around 20 feet deep. You know this lake well, you swim here often. Yet still, it is night time, there is no one else around you, and while the human part of your brain knows that there are no dangers in this lake, those primal fears that still dwell deep within your DNA makeup don’t know that. What was that splash of water behind you? A small wave? Or something moving? But no… you know this lake. You know that you are safe.

Now imagine you have no such comforts. You are kilometres off shore, floating in the rough seas of the South Pacific. There is over 13 thousand feet of dark waters underneath you, it is the middle of the night, and you know without a shred of doubt that there are things swimming around underneath you. It is impossible to accurately describe the fear that one feels in that situation. So like I said, I invite you to attempt to imagine it.

For the first few minutes on end I was practically hyperventilating. Waves were rising up, smacking me across the face, and I was struggling to tread water and keep myself afloat, such was my state of panic. I remember the pain in my neck as I snapped my head around every which way, frantically looking for any sign of hope, only to see an endless dark horizon in every direction. I recall the moment I managed to somewhat calm my panicked mind, the dizziness subsiding, and my breath returning to something that resembled normal. That, of course, was the moment the true fear set in. That fight or flight mode tends to keep you distracted enough that you don’t need to focus on the reality of the terrible situation you are in. It was when I calmed a little, began breathing steadily and treading water naturally, that it all hit me at once.

I felt so small. Quite literally, a drop in the ocean. I tried so hard to stay focussed, but all I could think about as I flailed there in the ocean was how quick and easy it would be for a great white shark to swim by and sink its teeth into my abdomen. I wouldn’t even know it was coming. It was so dark, and the sounds of the wind and the waves would drown anything out. I would just be floating there whole one minute, then I would be a bleeding corpse the next. I thought about how pointless a death that would be. It’s strange, but these are the things you think about when you are facing such a reality. Sharks don’t even like the taste of humans. I wouldn’t even be a satisfying meal for a hungry predator. I would just waste away out there, slowly disintegrating for nothing.

And then it happened. Shocking me out of my morbid thoughts, as though only to confirm them, a slight tickle on the bottom of my foot. I snapped backwards quickly, though I did not look down. I continued treading water, hoping, praying that whatever had just touched me had been a stray piece of seaweed or something harmless like that. I imagined my legs dangling down there. I imagined a mouth opening up as a tiger shark raced up from the depths, ready to close its jaws around my feet. I shook my head, trying to shake those awful thoughts from my mind… And there it was again. But not just a tickle this time, no, I felt something grasp around my ankle. I pushed myself backward again, and took a few backstrokes away from where I was. What the hell was that?! Something had just grabbed me! No shark can do that.

I was quickly returning now to my panicked state, my primal brain screaming at me to get out of the water, but of course that not being an option. I told myself I had to keep calm, and did so the best I could. I forced myself to breathe to a rhythm, and I forced myself to keep treading water slowly, to not thrash about, to conserve energy. Yet, every few minutes or so, I would feel it again. That feeling of something slippery and slimy poking, grabbing and prodding at my feet and legs. For those arduous hours that I was out there in the blackness of the ocean, this thing’s behaviour continued. Every so often I would just start swimming. I don’t know how far I got, the tide was strong and I could feel currents pulling me back the way I came. But, no matter how far I thought I swam, this thing pursued me. At one point, I felt the distinct sensation of some kind of tentacle wrapping around my thigh. I could feel it squeezing tighter, almost to the point that I could not kick that leg any further, and I almost resigned myself to drowning in that moment. I don’t know what it was, and I still don’t know why it let go. But that would be the last I felt of it.

Minutes later, after what I can only estimate was around 3 hours stranded in the middle of the ocean alone, I heard a sound that I never imagined could bring me such comfort.

***Bwooom! Bwooom!***

I looked around, and there it was, its bright spotlight shining straight on me. I was not ignorant to the fact that I was about to be going from the fire back into the frying pan, I was just grateful I was going to be out of the former. The ferry’s engined slowed to a crawl, as it began spinning around, turning to face the Portside of the ship toward me. On deck stood two pale figures. I must impress, these figures, while humanoid, were clearly not human beings. For one thing, they were naked, yet featureless. Their faces blank slates. I mean, they did have faces, they were just devoid of any emotion or intent. I did wonder for a moment what these things’ intentions were, did they mean me harm? Were they here to finish me off? Were they here to simply taunt me as I continued flailing helplessly in the water until I inevitably drowned?

Thankfully, none of these theories were true, as a second later I watched them hurl a life ring out to me. The way they moved was bizarre. Every motion was in parallel unison with each other. Both arms swung out like a perfect mirror image as they threw the floatation device out to me. Then, after I grabbed on, they once again, in perfect unison, began reeling me in. When I reached the side of the ferry, they continued their bizarre synchronised routine, reaching down and tossing over a rope ladder, which I proceeded to climb up, dragging myself onto the deck of the ferry. Exhausted, I lay there for a few moments, thankful to be out of the water, yet painfully aware I had only prolonged the misery of my foreseeable destiny. After a minute or so laying there and catching my breath, I rolled over, reached out for the railing and pulled myself back up to my feet. I stood up to face these… things. They stared at me, still standing side by side, a side by side reflection of eachother almost perfectly. The difference now, is that one did indeed have an expression on its face, and not a pleasant one. It stared at me with a scowl on its face. I didn’t feel like I was in any immediate danger from these things though. More than anything, he looked pissed off. I was just about to open my mouth and thank them, when out of nowhere, he slapped me!

Seriously! I shit you not. This… thing, without a single change in expression, with zero hesitation, lifted its hand and slapped me across the face! I could only stare at this asshole, a look of absolute bewilderment on my face, as they both turned and walked away. Once again, they moved in perfect synch with one another. I watched them round the corner out to the rear deck, and that was the last I ever saw of them. Jesus… just when I thought this ferry could get no weirder! I lifted a hand to my face, rubbing it slightly. My God that hurt!

I wouldn’t have too long to dwell on it though, as in that moment my eyes were drawn to an almighty crash from the ocean behind me. Water from whatever had been responsible for this disturbance splashed all over me, drenching the deck. I staggered back a little, as the ferry itself creaked and groaned as it swung to one side, before crashing back down again. I rubbed the salty water from my eyes, my vision blurry, as I heard the ferry’s engines roaring back to life. We began to pick up pace now, as I stumbled my way over to the railing, leaning over and glancing out into the ocean. There was no mistaking it this time, there was something massive beneath those waves. It moved with purpose, its form swaggering from side to side as it drifted through the water. Whatever it was, it did not seem capable of immense speed. It quickly fell behind the more the ferry picked up pace, powering away into the night.

I thought of a couple of things in that moment. My first thoughts, of course, being the hours I had spent floating in those waters, with that thing poking and prodding at me. Had it been this giant which was taunting me all that time? And if so, why did it not pull me down into the depths with it? The second thought that crossed my mind were the ferry’s seemingly random trips out to sea. Could it be the case that whatever this thing was, was hunting us? Were these back and forths out into deeper waters not random at all, and simply the Captain trying to stay one step ahead of this monster? I did not know. All I knew in that moment was that I was glad I was not down there with it. Taking one last glance out to sea and noting the sun just beginning to peak its head over the distant horizon, I slid open the door to the cabin and stepped on back inside. It didn’t take long then for the physical exhaustion to catch up with me. Adrenaline had worn off, my fight or flight response could keep my physical limitations from giving out no longer. My legs turned to jelly, and I collapsed right there where I stood…

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I awoke a few hours later to a gentle hand shaking me. Honestly, I was tempted to just ignore whatever the hell it was and continue sleeping, perhaps forever, such was the stink of death on me at this point.

*“Sir… it’s almost closing time!”*

Café Guy’s voice was both a soothing presence and a harrowing reminder that I had once again awoken to yet another day of this nautical nightmare. I slowly sat up, stretching a little and rubbing my eyes before letting out a monstrous yawn. I noticed the ferry was idle once again, and I wondered where we might be. I was about to speak up in response when I was cut off by the obnoxiously loud P.A. system.

*“Attention passengers! We will be making our departure momentarily. The café service will close soon. A reminder to all, please remain inside the vessel and seated. If you need to stretch your legs or get some fresh air, please keep well away from the water. I repeat, no matter what you see, STAY AWAY FROM THE WATER!”*

Right… that was clearly directed at me, I thought. Apparently I had broken yet another weird rule. What the hell was I meant to do? There was a giant freaking cargo ship about to smash into us! Was I supposed to just stand there and die? Then again, that clearly had been some kind of hallucination. Or was it? I quite literally felt it roar past above me when I was down there…

*“Sir… I must insist that we move things along.”*

I glanced up, realising Café Guy was holding out a hand to me. I grabbed hold and he helped me up off the floor. My clothes were still all damp, and I stunk like a wet dog.

*“Ah… thanks mate.”* I said, as I struggled to find my footing, my body still very weak.

“Come on… let’s fix you something to eat,” Café Guy spoke warmly, smiling that trademark smile. He really did have something of a calming effect among all this madness. I followed him over to the café counter, and without even asking, he began cooking up a variety of different pastries, fresh sandwiches and salads. I didn’t care what he was making for me, I was ravenous enough to eat absolutely anything by this stage. My energy levels were near on non-existent, so my legs could attest to as I fell backwards into a row of seats. Café Guy noticed this, glancing over at me with a sombre look of concern on his face. Before long, he finished up what he was doing and packed all his creations into a bag for me, bringing it over along with a steaming hot cup of coffee. I was grateful for his presence on this otherwise awful ferry. It was nice to know I had a friend, despite everything else.

*“Here you are Sir,”* he said, handing me the food and the coffee. I didn’t even wait, grabbing out one of the beef and potato pies and taking a voracious chomp into its hearty goodness. I realised part way through my shameless display that Café Guy was staring at me. He wasn’t annoyed or anything, no, for the first time he actually looked like he was trying to hold back laughter.

*“Oh my God… I’m sorry! Geez… thanks mate. I appreciate it! It’s um… it’s really good!”* I stammered out, laughing a little myself as I did so and taking a sip of my coffee in an attempt to bridge myself back into a state of civility. Café Guy chuckled softly and shook his head a little, but after a moment that spark of happiness left his face. He suddenly looked sombre again, and he just stared for a moment before speaking up again.

*“You need to be more careful young man. You’re lucky we found you all the way out there! I’m sure you know this by now, but there are more to these waters we sail than meets the eye.”*

Finishing up my mouthful of pie, I nodded my head in response. *“Yeah… I sure do. I saw something down there early this morning, after they pulled me out of the water. It was huge. I’m pretty sure whatever it was had been trying to grab me when I was in the ocean too…”* I said, turning to face him now.

Café Guy slowly shook his head, before looking me in the eyes as he spoke again. *“If one of those wanted to take you, you’d be gone.”*

I froze upon hearing those words. So many things running through my brain all at once. There was more than one? What were they? What was their purpose? And… “*if* it wanted to take me”…? Is that the only reason I’m still breathing? Because this thing was in a good mood? The weight I felt in that moment was crushing, thinking back to my helpless self floating in that water. I shuddered at the thought of it.

Café Guy noticed this, and placed a hand gently on my shoulder. He spoke once more in that calming tone of his. *“Don’t you dwell on it sir. Things have a way of working out in the end,”* he said, before taking a glance down at his watch. He stood up, walking back over to the café and crouching down. He pulled out his set of keys and opened up a small locker beneath the counter. He pulled out a neatly packed bag, before locking back up, standing up and walking back over to me.

*“I have a feeling you need these more than me,”* he said, looking down at my still damp clothes. *“They’re clean and freshly washed, they should fit you. No need to give them back. I shan’t be needing them.”*

I glanced back at him, smiling a little myself now. *“Thanks mate… I appreciate you. I mean, I still don’t know what your deal is here, but you’ve been kind to me, and if by some miracle I make it back to the real world, I won’t forget it,”* I said to him, before reaching out my hand to shake his. He accepted my gesture, firmly shaking my hand, before turning and walking away.

So there I was again. Just me and the ferry, and the ever increasing number of strange passengers boarding it. I had given up hope of trying to get off this thing. If what I experienced in the sea was any indication of what the world outside had become, it seemed that I was safer in here than I was out there. For now though, I just wanted to get comfortable. Placing my bag of food down on my row of seats, I took the clothes Café Guy had given me and made my way downstairs to the bathroom to get changed. As I stepped down off the final step, I scanned the lower level of the ferry, noticing that both sides had now almost filled up. There must have been some more… “stops”, in the time that I was floating out there. Looking around the crowd, I noticed that some of the passengers we were picking up were looking less and less human. In the beginning, when I first noticed this shift in appearance, it was just subtleties. Like I said, the kind of human-LIKE appearance you get from an AI image generator. But now, this was even more pronounced. Some of the figures seated in the back right hand rows had these thick, rubbery looking heads sporting blank, almost faceless expressions as they turned their gaze toward me. Others were very unnaturally tall and thin, looking like they had been placed between two giant vice clamps and forcibly stretched out. Then some among the crowd had almost no human appearance what so ever, humanoid in shape being as close as they got. Many of them looked to have been pulled straight from the sea just as I was, their bodies covered in seaweed with clams and barnacles still hanging off soggy flaps of skin.

I quickly looked away from these humanoid “nothing-people”, as I had come to refer to them, as I noticed almost all of them were staring at me now. They were making me feel uneasy, and I didn’t like it. The fact that they just sat there and stared was in some ways worse than if they had been doing anything outright malicious. I slipped my way past the back row of seats, shivering as my arm brushed against the scraggly mess of dank, wet hair belonging to one of the passengers. I quickened my pace, rounding the corner and shutting myself inside the bathroom to change. Opening up the bag, I found a set of blue jeans and a white polo shirt. Very casual, I thought. Thanks Café Guy! I quickly changed into the dry clothes, stepped out and chucked my now surely ruined set into the trash. I sighed as I glanced out over the deck. We were back in Sydney Harbour once again, a sight I once cherished every time I laid eyes on it, but now? A landscape of pure dread. There was no one out there now. I don’t mean like the first couple of times where I could at least see shadows of people in the distance. This time there was just… no one.

I woefully turned my gaze away from this depressing landscape and made my way back upstairs to my row of seats. The upper floor was now my one and only safe haven away from the nothing-people. Even the group of convicts that had tried to attack me last night had now made their way down the stairs to join the rest of them, neatly sat in rows, all facing straight ahead, aside from their dopey stares toward me whenever I would show myself around them. It seemed the only time they ever broke from this trance was to herd themselves up the stairs and get their morning meals. Sitting down in my little corner, I grabbed out a sandwich and started munching away as the ferry made its way through the harbour once again. I wasn’t even all that shocked anymore, as I glanced out at the rotting scenery around me. Once again, same as yesterday, the ferry started pulling in to various ports, and again, they looked absolutely nothing like I had once known them to. The Maritime Museum wharf, which proudly houses the HMAS Vampire, now featured only the decaying hull of a ship half sunken in the harbour. As we began to sail out of the harbour and back toward the Parramatta River, I dared not look as we passed by Goat Island, seeing enough merely out of the corners of my vision to deter me from directly looking at whatever horrors were stomping their way across the shores. They were massive, whatever the hell they were, and I shifted away from the window and into one of the centre rows of seats, afraid that they might reach out for me.

Onwards we sailed, up and down the river and around and about the harbour, continuing this now monotonous routine of pulling into random stops, some I didn’t even know existed, and picking up more travellers. I stayed put right where I was, but every time a new group of them would board, my eyes stayed locked on the stairwell ahead of me, silently praying that none of them would make their way up here again. It must have been nearing about 4pm that day when it happened. I was out on deck getting some fresh air, just watching out over the water ahead, when I noticed the ferry was picking up speed. It was moving unusually fast, and this frightened me, but not near as much as what came next. I gripped the rail tight as the ferry began to turn, our heading now directed straight into the bank of the river. I thought this must be a mistake. I was sure that at any moment we would adjust our course back out into open space. But we didn’t, we only picked up speed. We were about 20 metres from the shoreline now, and I was just about to jump off the side again when I remembered the words from earlier…

*“Please keep well away from the water. I repeat, no matter what you see, STAY AWAY FROM THE WATER!”*

Now mere moments away from smashing into the shoreline, I grabbed the railing as tight as I possibly could, bracing for the oncoming impact… and then suddenly, my grip loosened, as my eyes met the impossible sight ahead of me. With an unearthly groan, the land itself began to morph before my very eyes. Within seconds, a new passage of water had opened up, a mass of twisted mangroves forming a tunnel around it. At speed, we blasted through the opening, as a crash of thunder erupted from the sky, much like when we had entered Botany Bay, and I cringed in terror, once again fearing I may be struck down by lightning.

But all was quiet, and the ferry began to slow its pace now. As I rose back up to my feet, I looked around in astonishment at the surroundings we now found ourselves within. We were trekking through a mangrove ridden swampland, the buzz of mosquitos and the stink off the muddy riverbank thick in the air. I was well travelled, and there was only one place in this country I had witnessed this kind of scenery. A soft clunk against the hull of the ferry, and the swish of a thick, reptilian tail disappearing beneath the water confirmed what I was thinking. We were not in Sydney anymore, we were traversing through a northern mangrove river.

My head began to spin. I’m not sure why, surely I should be used to this madness by now, but somehow this damned ferry managed to up the stakes yet again. I stumbled backward, turning around to go back inside, when I was met with the sight of yet another crocodile. This one, its head slightly elevated out of the water, as they tend to do before they jump, its jaws open slightly. I kept my eyes locked on it, ready to throw myself backward should it make a move, but not wanting to be the one to move first and startle it into striking. The ferry gurgled along through this murky hellscape, as the world around me became progressively weirder. Dark mists were now rising up out of the water, and more creatures began swimming around, circling the vessel. The more I got a good look at them, the more I realised how wrong I had been. They were not crocodiles. Too big. Even the most monstrous of crocs ever seen in Australia capped out at around eight and a half metres. These things circling the boat were at least twice that, looking more like the ancient Sarcosuchus than a modern day crocodilian. I took another couple of steps back, and suddenly, the P.A. system crackled to life again…

*“Attention… for your own safety, remain inside the ferry. Stay away from the water, and do not look outside.”*

They didn’t need to tell me twice. I quickly, yet quietly, made my way back inside and took my seat again, this time, keeping my eyes front. For hours we sailed through this natural maze, until I finally felt the ferry begin to swing in to a stop. Once again, the P.A. system exploded with static…

*“Attention! Remain inside the vessel! Keep your eyes closed! I repeat! KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED!”*

Catching sight of the long, twisted jetty winding out from within the dark mangroves ahead, and the barest glimpse of the tall, stretched out nothing-people lined up along it, I did exactly what the P.A. voice instructed. I squeezed my eyes shut tightly and did everything I could to turn my focus away from what was outside. A screeching sound rang out as the ferry swung in to dock, followed by the regular clangs out on deck as Ramp Guy hurled the now busted up metal foot bridge out onto the pier for these awful things to board the ship.

I could hear quiet whispers, along with the soft buzz of insects and the lapping of the water against the shoreline. I then heard the tapping of what sounded like sharp, pointed feet, clicking their way across the ramp. And finally, I heard the sound of the ramp being pulled back in and the gates latching shut. The ferry then floated there for a few minutes, as I listened to the new arrivals getting seated downstairs, their whispers now fading away as they no doubt joined the rest of the mindless drones in their ever present state of nothingness. Once I could hear them no more, and was satisfied that they were of no threat to me, I opened my eyes…

*“Please don’t be real,”* I thought, as I immediately shut my eyes once again.

Something… was looking straight at me. Through the window. Right next to my head. The window which was only half closed, leaving no barrier between us. I dared not continue to look, but what I saw was enough. It was clung to the windowsill, its face half pressed against the glass. The rest of its body hung limp across the deck of the ferry, its legs dangling out over the side. I pressed my eyes shut as tightly as I could, as I felt its breath on my neck, and heard it whispering between breaths.

*“Can you help me?”* It said, between ragged breaths.

I slid myself over to the farthest seat in the row I was in, but even then I could still feel its breath, and I could now feel its hand, sliding up against me, as if it were desperately trying to grab onto me.

*“Please… help me…”* It spoke again.

I once again felt a slimy hand uselessly attempting to grasp at my arm. I was crying silent tears now. I wanted to get up and run, but I did not know what else was around me. Perhaps I would be running straight into another of its kind.

*“Help… me…”* It spoke just one more time, as the ferry began to pull away from the jetty, and I heard it slide off the deck, and plop into the water. Its fate from that point? I do not know. Not once did I open my eyes again as the ferry continued sailing through this otherworldly land. Every so often, I would hear the ferry pick up pace, followed by that familiar crash of thunder again, before slowing down and continuing to make more stops. All the while, I could hear things boarding the vessel. Some would speak in tongues I could not possibly understand. Others spoke in languages I recognised, but did not know. Spanish, Mandarin, a variety of Asian and European languages as well as many others. I would hear the odd American or British accent, and in amongst it all I would also hear terrifying voices. Mixtures of groans, clicks and gurgles. All manner of specimens were being herded onto this ferry. But for what? I had no idea, nor did I really want to know anything about what was happening around me.

It wasn’t until we were back in Sydney Harbour that I opened my eyes again, and how I wish I had not. The ferry picked up pace, roaring through yet another of these portal things, and once we were through, I heard the familiar sounds of the harbour once more, feeling comfortable enough to look outside. First glance was not enough, I had to be certain of what I was seeing. I closed my eyes, shook my head, and looked again.

As the ferry slowly sailed down the harbour, a terrible sight lay before me. Sydney was no more. I mean, it was there, kind of. The beautiful cityscape I had gazed upon so many times, was now an apocalyptic wasteland. The Sydney Tower, once standing proudly high above the city, had been snapped off midway up. The buildings were in ruins. The Sydney Harbour Bridge lay in shambles, broken off in the centre, and each side hanging downward. I watched in horror as hordes of these nothing-people wandered across the decaying bridge from both ends, toppling into the harbour as they reached the tipping point in the centre. The Opera House, once a proud symbol of our beautiful city now lay in pieces, its iconic sails scattered all over.

I turned away from this nightmare, forcing my eyes to look at anything else, but what I saw inside was no better. The ferry was almost full now. Many more nothing-people had entered the vessel during our ventures down that river, and wherever the hell else we had been. All over the world, by the sounds of things. The upper floor was no longer my safe haven away from them, as it too was now almost full, the entire opposite side now filled with figures taking all manner of forms. All of them, staring squarely at me.

I looked away from them, feeling uneasy, yet relatively assured that if the previous days were any indication, once they were boarded and seated, they meant me no harm.

The ferry continued to sail up and down the harbour, and a few more stops and pickups were made, all the while I tried my best to relax, to sit back and not draw any attention to myself. And I managed to do just that. Even as my own side of the ferry began to fill up with boarding travellers, I somehow managed to keep my head. That was until the end of the day.

It was around 7pm that night, when the ferry went down. No… I don’t mean it powered down for the night. I mean it dropped ***straight down!***

Any composure I had managed to maintain went out the window, as I tucked myself down in my seat, preparing for the rush of cold water to pour in through the open doors and windows, trapping us all in this underwater coffin. But… it didn’t.

I was instead suddenly surrounded by utter silence, save for a dull wind, audible, yet I could feel nothing on my skin through the windows. I slowly raised my head and opened my eyes, noticing the pitched black night sky outside. Had I imagined what just happened? I could have sworn to God this ferry had just dropped straight down underneath the water. I saw it. I felt it happen! But alas, there was the night sky, right there. I could not hear the typical sounds of the harbour anymore, and I wondered if we were even still in Sydney.

I got up from my seat, intending to take a look outside at what was going on. Slowly I slid open the door to the Starboard side deck, and I very carefully stepped out, painfully aware of the many hidden threats that may lie waiting out there. What met my eyes this time, however, was so much worse than anything I had yet seen on this journey.

As I gazed over the side of that ferry, seeing no water at all beneath us, and observing the green and blue ball suspended in vast, black nothingness, slowly disappearing into the darkness we were now floating off into, I realised with a dizzying horror…

Not only were we not in Sydney Harbour anymore… we were not even on ***Earth*** anymore…
