I've always been an artist, even as a kid. My notebooks were filled with sketches of monsters—twisted creatures with too many eyes, beasts with gaping maws, things that slithered in the dark. But one figure kept reappearing in my drawings.

The Watcher.

A tall, faceless man with elongated limbs and fingers that tapered into sharp points. He lurked in the background of my sketches, half-hidden behind trees, peering around doorways. Always watching. My mother used to laugh it off as an overactive imagination, but I knew better. I didn’t imagine The Watcher. I saw him. In my dreams. In the dark corners of my childhood bedroom when I woke up screaming.

I’m telling you this because I found one of those old drawings today. In my new house.

I moved into this creaky Victorian last week, charmed by its original hardwood floors and stained-glass windows. The previous owners left some boxes in the attic, and I was sorting through them when I found the yellowed paper. My breath caught the moment I unfolded it.

It was one of my Watcher drawings. Unmistakably in my childhood handwriting, with those jagged, uneven lines I used to make. But what made my hands shake was the date in the corner:

**March 25, 2025. Today.**

That’s impossible. I must have written the wrong date as a kid. That’s what I told myself as I turned the paper over and saw the words scrawled on the back in my own childish hand:

**"DON’T LET HIM IN."**

The moment I read it, the pounding started downstairs.

Three heavy, deliberate knocks on the front door rattled the glass panes. My phone screen lit up. 3:12 PM exactly. A voice, low and guttural, called through the door.

*"Let me in."*

I crept to the attic window, my breath shallow, and looked down at the porch.

No one was there.

Then, the knocking came again. Louder. More insistent. Like something desperate. I saw it then—the shadow stretching beneath the attic door, impossibly long, the fingers twitching unnaturally, hooked like claws.

I ran. Down the attic stairs, into the hallway. My pulse pounded in my ears as I reached the front door, my hand hovering over the lock. The knocking stopped. The silence was worse.

Then I felt it. Breath. Right on my neck. A whisper, thick and wet, like something speaking through broken teeth.

*"Too late."*

I spun around. The hallway was empty. But the walls seemed closer. The air thick, pressing against me like invisible hands. My vision blurred at the edges, my skin crawled with the sensation of being watched. My phone buzzed in my hand.

A message. No number.

A photo.

**Of me. Standing exactly where I was. Looking at my phone. Right now.**

The picture wasn’t taken from inside the house. The angle was wrong. It was from outside. Through the front window.

I ran.

I don’t remember grabbing my keys. I barely remember getting in my car. But I remember the last thing I saw as I sped away. Through the rearview mirror. The upstairs window. A figure. Tall. Faceless. Watching me leave. The Watcher. Just like in my childhood drawings.

I drove for miles before I stopped at a gas station, my hands still trembling. The place was nearly empty, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. I needed a moment, some kind of explanation. Maybe I was losing my mind. Maybe it was stress from moving, from lack of sleep.

Then my phone buzzed again.

Another message.

Another photo.

This time, the picture was taken from inside my car.

It showed me sitting in the driver’s seat, my eyes wide with fear. But the worst part—the thing that made my stomach lurch—was the faint reflection in the backseat window.

A shape.

A tall, faceless figure.

I spun around so fast my neck cracked, but the backseat was empty.

I threw my phone onto the passenger seat and gripped the steering wheel until my knuckles turned white. I needed to think. If I could just go somewhere crowded, somewhere with people, I’d be okay. I just had to keep moving.

I peeled out of the gas station parking lot and onto the road, my heart hammering. My mind raced through every possible explanation, every logical reason for what was happening. But deep down, I already knew the truth.

I knew because I remembered something from when I was a kid. Something I had forgotten until now.

I had seen The Watcher before. Not just in dreams. Not just in drawings.

The night I stopped drawing him was the night my mother found me sleepwalking, standing at the front door, my hand on the lock.

She asked me what I was doing.

I told her, in a voice that wasn’t mine:

*"Letting him in."*

My phone buzzed one last time.

A final message.

**"You already did."**

**\[Update: My phone just buzzed again. There's a new drawing in my photos. It shows me sitting in this car. And something is standing behind me.\]**
