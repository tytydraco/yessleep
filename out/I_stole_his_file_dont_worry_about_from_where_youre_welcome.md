{REDACTED} COUNTY - The remains of 9-year-old Jason {REDACTED} were found at Camp Durkin last week, putting the summer spot on lockdown for the rest of the month. According to the police, the body was identified by the dental records after being pulled from a hollowed-out elm tree. Police say the remains were in a state that “won’t ever leave any of us on the force.”

“I’ve never seen a body found like this,” Police Chief {REDACTED} said. “Not once in fifty years. If he didn’t have his teeth we’d have no idea who this was.”

The remains were discovered by three male campers out past curfew. Head Councillor Kenneth {REDACTED} says he found the body not long after when approached by the three campers. 

“You’d think someone threw him up and put him there,” {REDACTED} said. “It's hideous.”

Police are opening a homicide investigation. The Starr reached out to the {REDACTED} family for comment. They have issued the following statement:

*Finding Jason is closure for our wounds and the tearing of new ones. At this extremely difficult time, we only ask that the press, the police, and the community be patient. Thank you, to everyone, who helped look for our boy; and may the families of the boys who found him get what help they need to cope.*

This find is the fourth in a list of tragedies to hit the popular summer camp. The camp’s owners could not be reached for comment.

{REDACTED} COUNTY - It’s another gruesome find for a beloved summer camp, turning it into the site of a mass murder investigation.  The search for a missing camper led to the discovery of more human remains, and the arrest of a local scoutmaster. 

According to Chief  {REDACTED},  Kenneth {REDACTED} is accused of child endangerment and the murder of two campers. Police made the arrest early Tuesday morning, after a 9 - 1 -1 call not only from him but from his alleged victim earlier that morning.

In the first 9 - 1 - 1 call, the dispatcher (who wished to remain anonymous) says the caller was “obviously a child, very scared, and they said their scoutmaster was gonna kill them.” The dispatcher also says the child was told to run, and that “the kid had already heard multiple gunshots”. Before the dispatcher could ascertain the location of the victim, the call hung up.

“They screamed; and just suddenly stopped,” the dispatcher said. “I heard gunshots. I heard gunshots before, I think, then someone stepped on the phone.”

Police believe the call to be from the male victim (12). The victim, a camper for the summer, was found dead by Lake {REDACTED} in a large elm tree.  Police also say that the tree contained the bodies of two other victims, both female (13 and 10). Two holes were later discovered by detectives much closer to the campgrounds. Prosecutors believe {REDACTED} attempted to hide the first two victims in the ground before digging them up and hiding them in the tree instead. 

The Coroner’s office released the following statement:

*The bodies were in a state of partial decomposition. There are injuries consistent with buckshot on both female victims, but the damage on the male suggests an acidic substance came into contact with the victim’s skin, organs, and bones, before death. It is inconclusive at this time what weapon could have caused the damage*

According to the state’s attorney, the scoutmaster was arrested in his cabin after a hunting rifle was found, hidden, under a mattress. Police could not confirm if an “acidic substance” was found as well. {REDACTED} is set to be arraigned this Friday.

{REDACTED} COUNTY - A scoutmaster plead not guilty to four counts of first degree murder, but accepted a plea *deal* for three charges of child endangerment.

Kenneth {REDACTED} was arraigned on Friday, accused of killing campers Timothy {REDACTED}, Andrea {REDACTED}, Rosalie {REDACTED}, and Jason {REDACTED}. 

Camp Durkin has been closed since Sunday as police begin what they’ve called “the most gruesome serial killer case” they’ve seen to date. Families of surviving campers have been interviewed, along with the camp staff.

The Starr interviewed a man, who wished to remain anonymous, who used to attend the camp in childhood. He says this *isn’t* as new as many believe.

“Councilor {REDACTED} would round up the ‘trouble making’ kids - maybe the ones there on some kind of community service -  three or four times a week and take them miles away to where the local hunters go. The kids would always come back white as sheets and never cause a problem again. I started causing grief because I wanted to see what it was. My group had their shoes taken off and got told to run, as fast as we could, and that we could go only back to camp if we survived by sunlight.

The surviving camper also says the staff were aware but does not remember any investigations. Police do confirm an investigation was conducted into Camp Durkin for missing children ten years ago, but that the case went cold due to lack of evidence.

S1: Ken … dammit, Ken.

S2: You didn’t have to talk to the papers.

S1: How did . . . Doesn’t matter. It was the right thing to do.I turned a blind eye to this whole thing long enough and I wanted to put an end to it. \[SILENCE\] One of us had to. Since you don’t keep your promises.

S2: I didn’t kill those kids, Des.

S1: Gooddammit, Ken, STOP. Everyone knows what you did, and its our fault for letting it go last time, but NOT this time! Just tell them the truth and let this shit be done already.

S2: I *did* tell them the truth and they don’t believe me.

S1: What, that they ‘wandered off’?

S2: \[SILENCE\] you know what? Fuck it. You won’t believe me either, but maybe everyone will finally listen if you start talking.

S1: About what, Ken? How sick you are?

S2: Just listen and then you can let go of me altogether, okay? Aren’t you violating the restraining order by being here anyway? \[SILENCE\] Thought so. Just listen. I did take those kids back into the hunting place, alright? I had to. These aren’t the angels everyone thinks they are.

S1: Timothy’s only nine -

S2: And torturing squirrels, but, hey, this town is good at turning a blind eye. Now. shut up and listen. I knew what each of those kids was doing and just wanted to put the fear of God in them. I . . . I shot two of them by mistake, buried them, and was gonna come back with stuff to fix them when I heard that Tim kid screaming. And then he just stopped, just \[WHISTLING NOISE\] gone. I followed where I heard it and . . . \[SILENCE\]

S1: And what?

S2:  Something moved. 

S1: And?

S2: And then it *didn’t*. Shit, I don’t fucking know, okay?  It just stopped. All I could see was the trees but, fuck, I know I saw something.

S1: That’s bullshit, Ken.

S2: You think I don’t know that? It’s the truth.

S1: You’ve never been good for that, even when we were married. Why should I believe you now?

S2: I told you I killed two of them. I told Carl I killed them. I *told them* where the gun was. Why would I lie about the others *now*?

S1: \[PAUSE\] What did you see?

S2: I have no fucking clue. It was long, thin, too many arms I think.

S1:\[SNORT\] A monster?

{REDACTED} COUNTY -  A man accused of the murder of several campers is now on - the - run, according to authorities. Former Scoutmaster Kenneth {REDACTED} escaped police custody Monday morning during a prisoner transfer, according to State’s Attorney {REDACTED}.

“{REDACTED} was being transferred to produce a bite impression for the investigation into a suspected fifth body found at the lake,” says Attorney {REDACTED}. “There will be an internal investigation after {REDACTED} is located.”

This comes after human remains were found by lake {REDACTED} Saturday afternoon. The remains, found by deputy {REDACTED}, were identified as the bones of Norman {REDACTED}, missing since July 19XX.  The State’s Attorney says that {REDACTED} agreed to submit a dental impression upon hearing that teeth marks were found on the bones.

“It could have been a bear, it could have been a stray lion from the mountains,” State’s Attorney {REDACTED} says. “We told him this could stop him from being arraigned on new charges and he agreed. In that transfer, it is believed he escaped. We are still investigating.”

A sheriff deputy, who wished to remain anonymous, says a deputy dropped the cuffs while preparing {REDACTED} for transport, and did not reach for them right away. “It’s like he was waiting for him,” the deputy said. “I think he bribed him, or, plead his case. I don’t know. I think they were friends. He just said he believed him.”

The sheriff's department did not respond to our calls.  Kenneth {REDACTED} is unarmed but considered dangerous. Police have advised caution, do not approach {REDACTED} and you are instead advised to call nine - one - one if you see him.

{REDACTED} COUNTY - New remains found by lake {REDACTED} have been identified as missing county inmate, Kenneth {REDACTED}.  Dental records confirm the skull to be {REDACTED}’s, but a femur also located is believed to be a child’s.  

“It’s the damndest thing,” says Police Chief {REDACTED}. “Whoever killed him must have put him with his victims.”

Both were discovered when a rotted tree near Lake {REDACTED} was pulled down as part of park district maintenance. The tree was also found with a handmade knife stuck in the root, and a disposable camera was also found inside.

“We developed the one picture,” Chief {REDACTED} said. There’s a tree with a leg sticking out. Might have been his last victim.”

It’s believed {REDACTED} called EMS once more, and the operator was let go shortly after for hanging up on his call. The operator, Desiree {REDACTED} was married to the suspect but divorced, according to her, over the death of their daughter.

“He killed her,” she said. “With a pistol. On a hike. He was a sick man that had us all scared {REDACTED} and I’m glad he’s dead.”

On the subject of {REDACTED}’s final call, Desiree goes quiet.

“I hung up because I heard something,” she says. “It sounded like . . . like ‘Feed’. Scared the {REDACTED} out of me. And no one believes me.”

REDACTED} was charged with the murder of four children at Camp {REDACTED} but was never convicted, taking a plea deal on child endangerment instead. The families of the victims are filing a wrongful death lawsuit against the camp, expected to be reviewed in court by Monday.
