I am a 25-year-old man and one year, after a breakup, I have decided to be a better version of myself starting by quitting smoking. In the beginning, it was hard, I was living alone in a 20m2 apartment and had nothing but myself to stay focused and try not to touch another cigarette. The hardest part was sleeping, for maybe 3 weeks I woke up several times at night sweating and couldn't even close my eyes because of nightmares. But one day my life changed by crossing paths with the most beautiful woman I've ever met, her name was Éléonore and she had curly blond hair with a wonderful smile that made me fall in love instantly. we quickly started dating, and the feeling between us was something I had never experienced, she just got out of a toxic relationship so we shared what we lived. We were quickly in love with each other
  

  
Everything was perfect, I had never felt that before, it was just happiness. So after a few month we decided to move out together into a bigger apartment. and then our love began to grow bigger and bigger week after week, month after month years after years, I met her family, she met mine, we went on vacations visiting different countries, I even bought the ring to propose to her (too nervous about it I hide it and took my time ). Everything couldn't be more perfect, we finally found happiness in this world.
  

  
Then one day, ( approximately 5 years after we first met ) I remember feeling dizzy all day long didn't know why but we were at her parents' house on the porch talking with her, her mother, and mine, I fainted, I fell straight up on the floor all I saw was my eyes closing looking at them while falling.
  

Few hours later I woke up, but it was not that kind of wake-up like you got a big nap, no, more like an after-surgery wake-up, head-turning around I was kind of screaming but not much. Then I hardly opened my eyes, I couldn't believe what was happening, and it took me several minutes to realize it. Everything disappeared, I was alone in my 20m2 apartment 5 years ago, where was she ? Who has taken the love of my life ?
  

  
I thought " Was that a dream ? " but it was too real to be a dream " Is this reality ? " yeah I can slap myself every time I want nothing has changed and nothing will.
  

  
To this day I don't know what happened, probably a dream or a vicious nightmare I don't know.
  
( never touch a cigarette again for sure ) 
  
Sadly it happens last year and like a person you haven’t seen in years I can't even remember her face now.. but all I see is her smile and her curly blond hair that I will never forget. I’ll remember you.. love you Éléonore.
