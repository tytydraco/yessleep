I’ve been a Pararescue Jumper for fifteen years, stationed out of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. We train for the worst—whiteouts, avalanches, mechanical failures in the middle of nowhere. But some calls stick with you, not because of the weather or the terrain, but because of what waits out there. This one happened in the winter of 2005, up in the Brooks Range.

We got the alert around 0200: an Army Black Hawk out of Wainwright had gone down during a night training flight. Mechanical failure, no mayday after the initial call. Four crew on board. The beacon pinged deep in a valley near the Arrigetch Peaks—remote, rugged country that even locals avoid in winter. Command decided on a single PJ insertion. Terrain too tight for a full team hoist, and the weather window was narrow. Just me.

I jumped from the Pave Hawk at 1,500 feet, static line, into a howling wind. Landed in waist-deep powder on a frozen riverbed. The chopper located the crash site by IR: the Black Hawk had clipped a ridge, tumbled, and wedged upside-down against a granite wall. Tail boom sheared off, rotors scattered like broken teeth. Still smoldering.

No bodies in the cockpit. Seats empty, harnesses unbuckled. One set of tracks leading away—deep, staggered, like someone injured but moving fast. Had to be one of the crew, maybe the pilot. Survival instinct kicking in.

I followed them. The prints climbed out of the valley, straight up a slope that should’ve been impossible in flight boots with possible broken bones. Snow was fresh, no wind yet to cover them. After an hour, the tracks didn’t waver, didn’t pause. No blood drops, no drag marks. Just purposeful, like he knew exactly where he was headed.

I’d heard the stories during cultural briefs with Yup’ik and Iñupiat liaisons. The Tornit. Old ones—the first people here before the Inuit. Giants, taller than any man, covered in thick hair, stronger than bears. They lived alongside the ancestors once, shared hunting grounds, but something broke the peace. A Tornit damaged a kayak, or worse. The Inuit fought back, drove them off. Now they hide in the mountains, the deep valleys. Vengeful. They don’t kill quick—they take you. Hunters go missing up north, traps smashed, bodies found torn apart or never found at all. And the smell… rotten meat, wet fur, something ancient.

I told myself it was bullshit. Focus on the mission.

The tracks led into a narrow gorge I didn’t remember from the maps. Walls closed in, blocking the wind. Everything went dead quiet. My breath echoed. Then I smelled it—faint at first, then thick, choking. Like a carcass left too long in the sun, mixed with musk.

The prints ended at a cave mouth, half-hidden by overhang. Big enough for a bear den, but the edges were worn smooth, like used for centuries. Inside, my headlamp caught movement.

He was there—the pilot, Captain Reyes. Standing in the center, flight suit ripped, but no visible injuries. Back to me, motionless.

“Captain Reyes, PJ Staff Sergeant Campbell. I’m here to get you out.”

No response.

I stepped closer, carbine low. “Sir, turn around. We’ve got exfil inbound.”

He turned slowly.

His face was wrong. Eyes too wide, skin pale and stretched. Mouth hanging open, breath steaming in the cold. Then he grinned—too many teeth, too sharp.

A low rumble filled the cave, not from him. From deeper in.

The air dropped twenty degrees in seconds. Frost crawled over the walls. Behind Reyes, something shifted in the shadows. Huge. Ten feet, maybe more. Shaggy hair matted with ice, arms hanging low, knuckles dragging. It stepped into the light—face almost human, but flattened, eyes small and black. It stank of death and wilderness.

Reyes—or what was left of him—tilted his head and made a sound. Not words. A grunt, deep, animal.

The thing reached out one massive hand and rested it on Reyes’ shoulder. Gentle, almost. Reyes didn’t flinch.

I backed up. “Stay where you are.”

It looked at me then. No anger. Just… hunger. Ancient.

I ran.

The gorge seemed longer going out. Footsteps behind—slow, heavy, shaking snow from the walls. That smell followed, thicker. I didn’t look back until I hit the riverbed. The tracks were gone. Cave mouth too, like the rock had sealed over.

Exfil picked me up an hour later. Official report: crew deceased on impact, remains unrecoverable due to structural instability and avalanche hazard.

I still fly missions up north. Sometimes, in the quiet between rotor thumps, I smell it on the wind. And I wonder if the Tornit are still waiting. For the next machine to fall from the sky.

They remember us. And they don’t forgive.
