My wife and I got married last fall. It was great to have everyone together, but talking to my friends from college brought up something I had completely pushed out of my memory. My wife was enthralled with the stories, naturally. I can’t blame her. And as the stories were being told, as I jumped in with details or confirmed what they were saying, I felt bad that I had never told her any of this. Later that night, I helped her out of her dress with a million buttons and ties and I told her everything about it. I didn’t keep it a secret on purpose. I had pushed it out of my mind and hadn’t had any issues since I moved out of my college apartment, so it never came up. She wasn’t upset, she was just curious. It was important to share any potential health problems with my now wife. 

The short of the story is that I went through a bout of sleep problems that started with sleep talking and ramped all the way up to dreaming while awake and sleep paralysis. Going over the details of it all brought it to the forefront of my mind and today my wife brought it up again and I’ve started to wonder the same things as I did when it was actually happening. Can sleep problems just stop on their own?

During my junior year in college, I moved off campus to a small studio apartment. I had wanted roommates but thought the price of the studio was worth it for the privacy. I had a roommate in the dorms for the past couple years, so the privacy would be nice. 

It was normal for months. I was happy to have my own space. The fall semester wasn’t too packed with classes and they were relatively easy, so I spent a lot of time out of the apartment with friends. If I was at the apartment, I’d be playing video games and listening to music or catching up on classic movies I hadn’t seen. 

It’s hard to say when it started because I lived alone. I can’t watch myself while I sleep. It was only a couple of times a month, but I’d find myself in different states of dress than I had fallen asleep in. Sometimes it was that my retainer was out of my mouth, just on my nightstand, or that my socks were off and thrown on the ground next to the bed. This wasn’t something I really remembered doing, but I know as a child I would find the stuffed animal I was sleeping with on the ground or my pillow thrown to the foot of the bed. In the middle of the night, in a half-asleep attempt at getting comfortable, your body is willing to just take over and do whatever it needs to without logging it as a memory. 

It took a good ten separate times before I admitted that food really was going missing. I’d noticed one slice of pizza out of six, a soda can, or a bag of chips go missing. All foods that were relatively easy to eat that I could’ve eaten while asleep. At first I thought I had forgotten how many of something I had, but it kept happening to the point that it was a concern either way. I started to write how much of each food I had in the house and sure enough, by morning, the food amounts wouldn’t match up. 

I told my friends about it and they all laughed, saying I must be eating in my sleep. I had been trying to eat healthier and work out more, so they said that Asleep Me was mad about it. I looked into sleep disorders and ended up watching a movie from this guy who sleep walks and would find himself outside of his house or on the roof. As long as I stayed in my apartment, it was fine. The worst I would do is eat a ton of food. I ended up putting a baby latch on the fridge and that seemed to help, but it never completely stopped. 

By the spring semester, I had a girlfriend. We would text late into the night and I’d fall asleep with the phone next to me in bed. I’d wake up now and again to texts I sent in the middle of the night and had no memory of. Some of them were complete nonsense, like what I’d expect to send if I was texting while sleeping, but others were just short words or phrases that autocorrect probably caught. I remember some: “come”, “so pretty”, “eat”, “watching”, “love you”. They weren’t terribly odd, at least from my end. I’m sure a text at 2am that said “watching” was terrifying for her. I told her about my sleep eating and we laughed it off. Then, I’d wake up to responses from her to my weird texts and they made me laugh. 

When she’d stay over, she said she never saw any of the weird behaviors I claimed to do, but I would only do them maybe once a week. I tried to insist that sleeping next to her made me so comfortable I didn’t want to do any of my mid-sleep activities. I actually wondered that when I first moved in with my now wife, too. I thought maybe my sleep problems just went away with someone else in bed with me, but that didn’t explain the alone years after college where I didn’t have any issues either. I digress. My college girlfriend did tell me that I moved a lot in my sleep, just regular tossing and turning. I also mumbled or occasionally got the whole word out, but nothing as crazy as she had been expecting. 

As with everything, as time went on, my sleep issues got worse. At first, I’d wake up laying backwards in my bed, with my feet on my pillows. That was certainly odd, but if I had gotten up to eat something, or try to eat something, I could see myself just collapsing back into bed. Over the months, I got further from bed. Once, I was sitting against the fridge. Another time I was in the bathtub. The scariest was when I woke up outside, forty feet away from my apartment door with the door shut. Thankfully, it was unlocked. 

As a college kid, I certainly wasn’t going to go to the doctor, but I did look up sleep disorders online. It prompted me for other sleep issues and I said that I was tired all the time. Looking back, that was probably just a normal college thing. I stayed up late, slept inconsistent hours, and was stressed about exams. The internet suggested I had somnambulism, which is the fancy term for sleepwalking. Being up so much during the night can cause you to be tired during the day. From what I read, there doesn’t seem to be a lot you can do to stop it other than just preventing yourself from doing bad things, like going outside. I started to barricade the door every night. In theory, anything I did while awake, Asleep Me could do, but the sleeping stupor kind of made Asleep Me an idiot. I found it unlikely he’d be able to move the barricade.

With the fridge childlocked and the door barricaded, nothing extreme really happened. Lights would be on when I left them off or the tv that I left on would be on a different channel, which was odd because it was always something I didn’t watch, as if Asleep Me had different tv preferences. Things would also be in different places than I left them: everything inside my wallet thrown around the apartment, bar of soap in the toilet bowl, boxes of cereal and crackers surrounding me in bed. Pantry foods would still go missing at regular intervals. I’d wake up in odd positions. The usual for me.

At this point, as things got comedically advanced, I set up a camera. I bought some cheap old thing online. It just needed to record. But I tried to do this several times and every single time, the camera would stop recording only minutes after I fell asleep. My body didn’t move, so it’s not like I was turning it off. Piece of crap, camera. I kept it, still have it around somewhere. I should try recording my sleep again, just to see. 

Once or twice while my girlfriend was staying over, she’d complain in the morning that she woke up because I had been touching her but when she’d roll over to hassle me, I’d be fully asleep. We laughed at it and I apologized but she said she wasn’t upset at me, only a little upset at Asleep Me. 

It was funny how quickly we created an entire persona for the version of me that sleep walked (slept walked?). My friends, my girlfriend, and I would refer to him randomly and had a weird amount of inside jokes for a person that didn’t exist. It just became a part of my life. I go to college, I work as a waiter, I like playing ARPGs, and while I’m asleep, my body goes around and does whatever it wants. 

It was mid-summer when I told my mom about my sleep and she suggested I find a sleep specialist but I wasn’t concerned. As far as I could find, nothing would fix my issues. I know she was worried about me hurting myself while I’m asleep, but I hadn’t done anything yet and was sure I had peaked at walking outside, which I now prevented. 

I was wrong. Weird symptoms started around then. I’d be laying in bed, almost asleep, and hear sounds, like my dreams were creeping in while I was still awake. I couldn’t make them all out, but it would be a voice now and again or mostly walking around or thuds. I’d be too tired to care and I’d fall asleep shortly after. Sure enough, the internet comforted me by saying this is a common symptom of narcolepsy - dreaming while awake. 

That led me down a rabbit hole. Everyone (myself included) thinks narcolepsy is the whole falling asleep randomly thing, but apparently that’s only about half of the people with narcolepsy. The main symptoms are falling asleep quickly, being tired all the time, falling asleep in unusual places or times, dreaming while awake, and dreaming immediately after falling asleep. I hit most of those symptoms. A lot of people also describe having sleep paralysis, which I had had as a kid. It was always terrifying, even though I didn’t really see much, just the feeling of being frozen was enough to scare me as a kid. 

I stayed over at my girlfriend’s house a few times and I’d feel about the same, sometimes hearing things right as I was falling asleep, but she always reported that I didn’t do anything during my sleep either. Back in my apartment, every couple of days, I’d wake up with something weird happening - food missing, the tv on or off, in different states of dress than when I fell asleep, or I’d wake somewhere other than my bed. I passed it off as the likelihood of it happening on one of the few times I stayed with her (or her with me) being pretty low, so it wasn’t odd she didn’t see any of it. 

My spring semester of my senior year was my most stressful, so I found myself staying up later than normal, sometimes staying up all night. The next morning, I’d end up sleeping in. It was during this, especially when I didn’t sleep the night before, that I’d get sleep paralysis. It only happened maybe four times during the semester, but it had probably only happened that many times before in my entire life. Every time was about the same. It always was when I was still in bed, I’d open my eyes and see a shadow, maybe a person, in the corner of my room and I’d be frozen. I didn’t quite feel like I did when it happened when I was a kid. As a kid, it felt like a weight was on me and I couldn’t really feel my body. This felt like fear, but I still couldn’t move. I just locked eyes with whatever the thing was, then I’d blink and blink, trying to wake myself, and the shadow would be gone in the midst of a blink. It freaked me out, but I figured that in the grand scheme of sleep paralysis, a shadow man in the corner wasn’t too bad. 

That was the worst my sleep problems ever got. I promised myself I’d go to a sleep doctor once I got my grown-up job, but I never did because the problems went away. It wasn’t something I really critically thought about. The issues would happen once, maybe twice a week, but sometimes I’d go weeks without issue. When I moved out and got a job, it took me years to realize I wasn’t having any issues anymore. One day I just thought ‘hmm how long has it been since I’ve woken up somewhere weird or eaten in the middle of the night?’ and I couldn’t think of a single instance since moving out of my studio apartment. I didn’t dwell on it further, figured I’d go to a doctor if symptoms ever appeared again, but they didn’t. 

It was this morning that my wife brought it up again. It’s been almost a year since she first heard about my sleep issues and we haven’t talked about it again, but she said she saw a video on Instagram that made her think of it. It was someone talking about undiagnosed sleep problems and how a bunch of people suffer from things but never treat them. 

“Have I ever done anything weird in the middle of the night?” I asked. She thought about it for a while but agreed I hadn’t. We’ve lived together for five years now, so surely if I was, she’d have seen something. 

It was at this discussion that I thought through everything I wrote above again for the first time in a while. Even when I told her last year, I gave her the quick version, I didn’t think over every instance like I did today. I grew kind of concerned and texted a friend, my wife’s brother actually. He’s a doctor, so I sent a quick text of ‘hey, can someone with sleepwalking problems get over it?’. He said that yes, a lot of people have bouts of sleepwalking when they’re young or during stressful times in their life. Okay, cool. I was stressed during school. ‘What about narcolepsy?’ I asked. That took him a minute to respond to, but he eventually said no. I looked into it, not that I don’t trust him, but surely there had to be a case or two out there, but the internet agreed with him. ‘Sleep paralysis?’ I asked. Again, kids have it and then it can stop in adulthood. But rarely does it stop in adulthood once it starts. The only instances of sleep paralysis I had were as a kid and in that apartment. I didn’t have it before and I haven’t had it after. 

I just keep thinking everything over. What else could the cause have been if not sleep issues? I had to be eating my own food, although I never left a mess, my teeth always felt clean in the morning, I never found crumbs or the wrappers anywhere in the house, including the trash. I never gained weight despite the supposed large amount of food I consumed some nights. I had to be walking around in my sleep and undressing myself. I remember the time I was outside thinking that it was weird how clean I was. My socks weren’t dirty or wet at all, almost as if I had just been plopped down right on the ground. I don’t like thinking back on the sleep paralysis moments. When I think of them too long, I start to wonder if I really could move. If I *did* move. My body didn’t feel like it did when I was a kid, like a force was holding me down, it was more like that full body shiver when your brain is in fight or flight mode and trying to pick which is best. I swear once I started to sit up, but if I started to sit up, then the shadow couldn’t have been a part of sleep paralysis . . .

I do remember my girlfriend at the time saying the apartment creeped her out, like she always felt like someone was there with us. I joked it was a ghost and she would laugh but she genuinely refused to come over a lot. I didn't believe in ghosts but knew it would make her laugh and maybe make her feel better. I want to look up the apartment complex, see if anything has happened there. I had an attic that I never went in. I didn’t have enough stuff to warrant it. I came home once or twice to the door to it open. It was just a piece of wood that you’d slide out of the way. I thought it was maintenance (or maybe the ghost), but now I’m not sure. 

It’s been years and yet I’m getting chills just thinking about it all. Has anyone else had sleep problems that just go away? Please tell me this was all just sleep paralysis and narcolepsy. I don’t want it to be anything else.
