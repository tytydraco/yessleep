I Charlotte (23F)  moved into my new apartment roughly 5 months ago. At first I was loving it, having my own space and some independence. But now I wish I had stayed home.

Initially I moved out of my parents home as I was offered a new job in a new city.  This meant I had to leave friends, family and my girlfriend Rachel (29F) behind. Making friends in a new city isn’t as easy as it seems. But then I met Samantha (20F). She was different. I met at a pilates class, we got on instantly. Her welcoming homely personality drew me in. To this day I’ve never mentioned her to my girlfriend (it just never came up in conversations).

It all began when I invited her round for a few drinks. I felt as if I could trust her with everything but I was wrong. Whenever her and I were out in public together, people would share strange and confused glares amongst themselves. To this day I’ll never know why. 

Sammy (Samantha) was always cold to touch and it felt as though we were the only people in each others worlds. We shared everything, she was my everything and I was hers. It felt wrong, our connection was not like mine and Rachel’s. So I ended things with Rachel, so that I could be with Samantha.

A few weeks go by and at a work night out I began chatting to a group of colleague’s who were all local to the area. So I introduced them to Sammy. There faces dropped. “Nobody is there” they said with pure confusion. She was though, she was ALWAYS there. 

I began to worry people were not fond on my Sammy. So I stopped seeing her, I blanked her whenever she was around but her presence was always there. 

Ive not spoken to her in a month until a couple of days ago. I came home from work and she was sitting on the sofa in my living room. “What are you doing here” I asked her in a sheepish voice. “Why are you ignoring me Charlotte” she whispers with her back facing me. I felt cold blood rushing through my veins, this wasn’t the voice of the Sammy I knew. It was deeper and colder. She slowly turned to face me, her skin was as pale as chalk and her hair was matted. Her appearance was startling, I always knew her to be someone who took great care of themself.

I had a lump in my throat and couldn’t bring myself to speak to her. She wasn’t Sammy. As she moved closer I tried moving back but my whole body froze. She put her cold hand on my shoulder and moved towards me and whispered into my ear “Join me on the couch for a chat”. I told her “Please step away and get out of my home before I call the police”. She threw me a chilling glare and repeated herself. “Join me on the couch for a chat”. I joined her and she stood up to get us a glass of wine. The wine was thicker and redder than usual. 

While Sammy was fetching our wine from the kitchen, I quickly pulled out my blackberry phone and speed dialled 999. The police arrived within minutes. They searched my whole home and checked all mine and my neighbours security footage but there was no sign of anyone there. There was no sign of Sammy ever being there.

But she was. She was standing beside me the whole time, holding a smashed wine glass to my neck.
