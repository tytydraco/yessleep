I am 21 and after living through several important benchmarks of life, and flying out of some of them with "flying colours", I sit and reflect a lot on if it is really me who achieved everything? Did securing a top 10 rank in a big exam was really something to do with my intelligence or was it because my parents could afford sending me to a good school? Was studying at the "best college in the country" a thing i should feel proud about, or is it just a reflection of the fact that I could do it because I was fateful i got that option. Was getting my first big internship through my father's friend's friend really something I should've ever been happy about? Am I still a fool to believe that my resume and interview rounds really did something or the mere referral was all it was.

Upon reflecting this for the first time I found myself with a newer, better drive and I wanted to achieve something I could call really my own. I wanted to get the best jobs out there and get into the best universities in the world for my master's. I did do both of these things eventually, but the doubt is still there. I never felt like getting those job offers had anything to do with my merit but only because companies have a way of identifying privalege, I am far far beyond placing classist generalisations but why did many different people from my class with better grades and subject matter knowledge, with a relatively humble upbringing could only afford to get an offer they were not distinctly interested in and that paid like shit. This is not just an instance that I personally faced, if you look at the job offers students got at my university, the fanciest people got the best offers, i do not think this is a coincidence? Secondly, i got into a coveted master's program in a brilliant university, but again, that's not me right? it's just because i had an option to pursue that, it's as simple as that. 

My friends call it- imposter syndrome but I don't think it's that, it's way beyond. I think i just know the reality. Sometimes, I try to console myself into thinking your family's support and your hardwork goes hand in hand, but I just simply fail to see merit in any of my "achievements". I think I am not even an imposter anymore, I am just a person who hasn't witnessed what real hardwork is? What am I really capable of? 

But, you know what makes it worse? How much of a privilege my above message might reek of, it has not really even been like that. I am not ultra rich, just upper middle class at best, my family had to make big sacrifices for everything they have been able to provide me, my parents had to let go off of many of their interests to let me soar high in the direction i want to go in. As I am growing up, this realisation is hitting harder than ever. Till a few years back I thought I am the shining star of the family, but now I always feel like I am a burden on the chest, that my family has to help grow. A spoilt child who cannot survive a day in the real world.
