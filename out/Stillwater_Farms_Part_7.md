The exit to the tunnels was smaller than I expected.

Just a square hatch cut into the earth, framed in warped wood, the metal handle eaten with rust. Someone had thrown boards and an old tarp over it, then a layer of dead grass, like the whole thing was embarrassed of itself.

Nick shoved it up from below with his shoulder. The night air hit my face: cold, clean, so sharp it made my teeth ache. I hadn’t realized how long it had been since I felt fresh air.

We crawled out into the yard like something the ground was spitting back up.

The farmhouse loomed ahead, black against the sky, windows orange with lamplight.

Nick slammed the hatch shut with both hands. The sound was too loud in the quiet field.

I wedged a rusted rake through the handles, sealing it the only way we could.

Somewhere below, something thudded against the hatch once. Just once.

The wood jumped under my hands.

We froze.

Nothing else came. The night went back to crickets and distant frogs, the normal sounds of a place that had no idea what pulsed underneath it.

Nick let out a breath that shuddered at the end.

“We get El,” he said. “Then we run.”

My legs shook when I straightened. Hunger and exhaustion and whatever the hell that water carried all braided together in my veins. But I nodded.

“We get El,” I echoed. “Then we run.”

We headed for the house.

The grass tugged at my ankles, wet and cold, like the field was trying to hold on. The porch steps creaked under our weight, familiar in a way that made me sick. We’d arrived here once with bags and jokes and Hailey alive.

Nick tried the back door.

It was unlocked.

The kitchen smelled like it always had: coffee gone stale, old grease, dish soap. The overhead light hummed. For a second, if you didn’t look too closely, it could’ve been any farmhouse in any nowhere town.

Silas sat in one of the kitchen chairs, knife resting flat across his knees.

He grinned when he saw us. He’d been waiting. 

“Well, shit,” he said. “Rats learned to climb.”

Nick stepped in front of me before I could think.

“Move,” he told me, without looking back.

Silas stood, rolling his shoulders, the knife spinning easily in his hand now. “Mae said you boys had spirit. Guess she was right.”

I tried to angle past them.

Silas shifted to block me.

“Ah-ah,” he said. “Nobody goes near the gir—”

Nick charged into him.

It wasn’t pretty. It wasn’t clean. It was just a straight, exhausted, rage-weighted tackle that caught Silas in the gut and drove him into the counter. The knife clattered to the floor, skidding under the kitchen table.

They both dove for it.

“Go!” Nick shouted, fingers locked in Silas’s shirt.

I didn’t argue.

The hallway felt narrower than I remembered. Every family photo on the wall seemed to watch as I ran past them.

Elenor’s door sat near the end, the wood scarred with tiny scratches near the handle.

Mae was already there.

She stood in front of the door like she’d been expecting me, hands folded at her waist, gray hair braided neat, expression as calm as if she were waiting for the kettle to boil.

“Alex,” she said. “Dear, you’re gonna want to slow down and think about—”

I didn’t slow down.

My fist connected with her jaw.

There was a sharp, ugly crack, like a branch snapping under too much weight. Mae’s head snapped sideways. Her body followed in a boneless sort of way, skirts flaring as she hit the floor. She crumpled against the wall, breath knocked clean out of her, eyes rolling up for a second before she blinked hard, trying to make the world focus.

I stepped over her.

Her hand twitched toward my ankle, then fell back, useless.

I shoved Elenor’s door open.

Her room was exactly as I’d last seen it.

The bed was made, white linens smoothed flat. A mug of tea steamed on the nightstand, curling its breath into the air. There was a book open in her hands. She sat cross-legged on the mattress, back straight, hair brushed until it shone.

She looked up.

“Alex—” she gasped. “How—what are you doing here?”

I must’ve looked like something that had crawled out of a grave. I could feel the grit on my skin, the tunnel water soaked into my clothes, the stink of the heart still clinging to my hair. My chest heaved. My hands shook.

“I told you,” I said, breath coming in ragged pieces. “I told you I’d get us out.”

“Alex, I—”

I didn’t let her finish.

I crossed the room in three steps, grabbed her by the waist, and hauled her off the bed. The book fell from her hands and hit the floor face-down. Tea sloshed over the rim of the mug, staining the white wood of the nightstand.

She made a small sound of protest—more surprise than resistance—but she didn’t fight me. Her fingers curled in my shirt instead, holding on.

“We’re leaving,” I said. “Now.”

We didn’t get far.

Ruth and Jonah stood at the end of the hall.

Ruth’s apron was spotless, her hands lifted in a slow, careful gesture, like she was approaching a spooked horse. Jonah’s face had gone white, his eyes darting between us and Mae on the ground.

“Alex,” Ruth said, voice soft and level. “Baby, put her down. You’re scaring her.”

“C’mon man,” Jonah added, “let’s all just take a breath.”

I shifted, putting my body fully between them and Elenor. She ended up pressed into the corner where the walls met, my arm across her stomach, holding her in place behind me.

Nobody moved.

The house creaked somewhere. The kettle hissed in the kitchen, unattended.

Ruth took two small steps forward. “You don’t want to do this. You know you don’t.”

“Back up,” I said.

My voice sounded strange. Thin. Stretched.

Jonah tried for a reassuring smile and got halfway there before it broke. “There’s no world where you get out that door alive if you keep this up. Move away from El, and we’ll talk about—”

“Don’t call her El, you piece of shi—”

A shout split the house.

Nick.

It came from the kitchen: a raw, wordless yell, followed by the crash of bodies hitting furniture.

The sound traveled down the hallway like a physical thing.

Nick barrelled into the hallway a second later.

Ruth turned just in time to take his shoulder full-force. Nick drove her into the wall, a blade leading. The knife slid into the side of her neck with a wet, ugly sound.

He was bleeding from a cut along his cheekbone, shirt torn, one sleeve hanging by a thread. His hair was slick with sweat and Stillwater and someone else’s blood.

He held Silas’s knife.

Jonah screamed.

He yanked Nick off her like he weighed nothing, throwing him hard enough that Nick hit the opposite wall and slid down in a smear of blood. But Jonah didn’t chase him.

He dropped to his knees beside Ruth, hands scrambling uselessly at the wound in her throat as dark, viscous red poured between his fingers.

“Ruth—Ruthie—no, no, no—” he babbled, his voice breaking. He tore at his belt for a battered flask, hands shaking so hard he almost dropped it.

He uncapped it with his teeth and poured Stillwater into her mouth.

She gagged and gurgled, trying to swallow.

Jonah looked up at us, eyes blazing with terror and fury.

“You boys have no idea what you’re doing,” he said.

Nick staggered to his feet, clutching his shoulder, knife still in his grip. His eyes found mine. Found Elenor. Found the hall beyond.

“Let's go,” he rasped.

We went.

The living room closed in around us, swallowing us forward.

Furniture flashed by.

The front door waited ahead—freedom hanging by its hinges.

We hit the entryway at a dead sprint, holding Eleanor between us.

Then we froze.

The door wasn’t escape.

It was a dead end.

It was Harlan.

He stood between us and the door like he’d been carved from the frame itself: shoulders squared, hands loose at his sides, boots planted in the hardwood. A wall with a pulse.

Nick and I skidded to a stop so fast Elenor stumbled between us. Her breath hitched against my arm.

The house felt smaller than it ever had, shrinking around the four of us like lungs exhaling.

Harlan’s eyes never left me.

He didn’t say a word.

Nick tried to push past him: quick, desperate, the ghost of a stab behind the motion.

Harlan caught him by the shoulder and shoved him back—not cruelly. Not even angrily. Just firmly. With the certainty of someone who knew exactly how this was going to end.

I lunged next, but he swept his arm in front of me like he was brushing dust from a table. Not aggressive. Not defensive.

Just immovable.

Behind us, footsteps gathered. The house filled.

Abel appeared first, as if he’d simply stepped out from behind a curtain. He clasped his hands behind his back, beard neatly combed, eyes gentle in a way that made my skin crawl.

Mae limped in next, one hand pressed to her jaw, glaring daggers through the pain. She kept her distance from me.

Jonah followed, Ruth slumped across his shoulders. She was barely conscious. Stillwater mixed with blood ran from her neck and down onto his back.

Silas was nowhere.

Abel surveyed the room like a pastor about to begin a sermon.

“Boys,” he said softly, “there’s no need for all this noise. Nobody wants to hurt you.”

Nick barked a humorless laugh. His shirt was torn, blood splashed down his front. “You’ve done nothing *but* hurt us.”

Abel sighed, like he was disappointed in a child. “You misunderstand. We preserve. We keep what the land chooses. And it seems…” His gaze slid to Elenor. “It seems the land chose her.”

Elenor’s fingers dug into my shirt. She still hadn’t said a word.

Abel lifted a hand.

The room stilled.

“You can’t win,” he continued. “Let her go. Come away from the door, and we’ll settle this without any more loss. We’re a family. We take care of our own.”

Nick’s jaw clenched. “We’re not your fucking family.”

Abel offered a small, patient smile. “All who partake in Stillwater become part of the root. You drank from it, did you not?”

A noise split the air before I could answer.

A raw, animal scream.

High. Sharp. Familiar.

It came from outside.

Something hit the window beside the door: glass shattered, curtains whipped inward. The grandfather crashed through in a shower of shards and splintered wood.

He landed on top of me before I could move.

His weight drove the air from my lungs. His hands slammed down on either side of my head, thick nails biting into the floorboards. His face hovered inches from mine: skin stretched thin, veins like roots pulsing under it, mouth hanging open wider than any human jaw should allow.

The sound he made wasn’t speech. It was hunger.

His breath—wet, rattling—hit my face.

His hand rose, claws ready to plunge straight into my chest.

“Ezekiel!” Abel’s voice cracked like a whip.

Everything froze.

Ezekiel halted, jaws suspended mid-snarl, pupils blown wide as if he were listening to a command delivered through bone.

That moment of stillness was all Nick needed.

He lunged behind Mae, one arm clamping around her throat, the other yanking Silas’s knife up to her temple. She gasped, body going rigid against him.

Nick’s voice shook with exhaustion and fury.

“This one matters to you, right?”

Ezekiel lowered his claws an inch.

Nick pressed the blade harder. Mae whimpered.

“What happens if I destroy her brain, huh? Stillwater fix that?!?”

Abel lifted both hands.

“Son… son, listen to me. Put the knife down. You don’t want to do something you can’t take back.”

Nick’s grip trembled.

Abel stepped closer.

“You let her go,” he said gently, “and I swear—on the land, on the root, on my blood—your brother walks out that door alive.”  
  
“Bullshit.”

“Nicholas. Listen. Put the knife down, and your brother lives. You will both walk out of here.” Abel’s tone never wavered. “But if you kill her, Ezekiel will rip your brother apart. Right here. Right now.”

“Nick—don’t,” I rasped.

Nick looked at me.

And something in him cracked.

He was so tired.

So broken.

His heart didn’t have anything left to burn.

He loosened the knife.

Mae inhaled sharply.

Abel nodded, relieved.

“There you go. There you—”

A wet sound cut him off.

Nick stiffened.

A thin shard of glass jutted from the side of his neck.

Blood pooled at his collarbone, spilling down in a steady line.

He swayed once, twice—then collapsed. The knife skittered out of his hand.

Behind him stood Eleanor, eyes huge and wet, bloodied hands shaking so badly she could barely keep one over her mouth. The other clutched her belly.

Nick’s head dropped beside mine on the floor. His eyes were open, but he was already gone from them.

“Thank you, dear,” Mae said softly, her hand shaking as she wiped the blood from her temple. “He would have killed me,” she folded Elenor into her arms, “I’m sure of it.”

My breath fell apart in my chest. The world went thin and sharp around the edges.

“Nick…” I whimpered. 

Elenor left Mae and stepped forward, crying openly now.

“Alex,” she said, voice breaking, “I’m pregnant.”

I didn’t look up.

“Alex… I can’t go back. I can’t go to some apartment and pretend this baby is yours, or his, or—I can’t do that.”

She pressed a shaking hand to her stomach, as if steadying the future inside her.

“The family will take care of me,” she whispered. “They’ll take care of us. They don’t care where the baby came from. They don’t care about any of it. They just… want us. They want us to stay.”

She took one trembling step toward me.

“We could stay,” she said softly. “We could live here. We could live forever. No more running. No more fear.” Her voice cracked. “Please, Alex. Please stay with me. Don’t make me do this alone. This is the only way we can be a family. I— we can’t go back.”

Her eyes drifted to Nick on the floor—blood spreading beneath him.

“Oh God… Alex, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” she choked out. “I was just trying—he—he—” Her breath collapsed into sobs. “Alex, can you say something? Please. Just say something.”

I couldn’t look at her. 

I couldn’t look at Nick.

My vision tunneled to the ceiling fan above me, spinning slowly, mocking how still everything else had become.

I laughed.

It tore out of me in jagged pieces, sharp enough to hurt.

It wasn’t humor.

It wasn’t hysteria.

It was the only sound my body had left.

I laughed until my ribs hurt. The only other sound was Elenor sobbing and begging for forgiveness.

“I loved you,” I said finally, looking up at her.

For a moment, she broke. Her mouth trembled. Her shoulders folded inward. She looked like she was about to fall to her knees beside me.

“Alex—” she whispered.

The room held still. Even the air felt afraid to move.

Then Ezekiel lunged.

Claws ripped toward my chest.

But they never reached me.

Harlan crashed into him from the side with a roar that didn’t sound human. He seized Ezekiel by the neck and slammed his head into the wall.

Once.

Twice.

Three times.

Blood sprayed. Bone cracked. Roots tore free from Ezekiel’s jaw as Harlan smashed until nothing recognizable remained.

The family screamed. Mae sobbed. Jonah nearly dropped Ruth.

Harlan stood over what was left of Ezekiel, chest heaving, hands trembling, drenched in black, viscous liquid—more Stillwater than blood.

He turned to me.

His face twisted—not in anger.

In grief.  
  
“There’s been enough death here.”

He bent, hooked his arms under mine, and lifted me like I weighed nothing. My feet barely touched the ground before he hoisted me over his shoulder.

I didn’t fight him.

I didn’t have anything left to fight with.

As he ran for the door, I twisted just enough to see behind us.

The family huddled together.

Mae clutched her bleeding jaw.

Jonah held Ruth upright as Stillwater pooled around their feet.

Abel didn’t move. He only watched Harlan, like this was something he’d always expected to see.

And then Elenor. Hand on her belly. Tears streaking her face. Looking at me like she’d just ripped out her own heart.

\*\*\*

The door slammed behind us and the night swallowed everything else.

Harlan didn’t set me down so much as drop me into the passenger seat and slam his own door before I could get my breath back. The engine groaned awake. Gravel spit behind the tires. The farmhouse shrank in the side mirror until it was just a bruise against the dark.

I didn’t register anything except the direction we were going: away from Elenor.

My body moved before my brain did.

I threw myself at him.

“TURN AROUND!”

My fist cracked against his shoulder. Then his jaw. I didn’t aim. I just wanted him *hurt*. 

“TURN THE FUCK AROUND—ELENOR—WE HAVE TO—”

He didn’t block me. Didn’t shout. Didn’t even look away from the road.

He let me hit him again. And again.

My knuckles split on something—bone or tooth or the metal buckle of his overalls.

“I CAN FIX THIS—LET ME—TAKE ME BACK—”

A sound ripped out of me that didn’t belong to language. It didn’t even sound human.

Harlan’s voice finally came, low and steady.

“I can’t take you back.”

I clawed at the wheel. The truck fishtailed. He caught the wheel with one hand—a giant, work-scarred hand—and held the truck steady while my nails dug into his skin.

“STOP—STOP THE TRUCK—LET ME OUT—LET ME—”

“No.” Still even. Still awful in its certainty. “Not while you’re like this.”

I hit him until I couldn’t lift my arms anymore.

At some point my body folded in on itself and slid down the door, forehead pressed to cold glass. I shook so hard the whole truck seemed to vibrate with me.

“Nick…” I heard myself whisper.

And then quieter: “El…”

I don’t remember the next hour.

Just the truck, humming like a held breath.

Just the white of Harlan’s knuckles on the wheel.

Just the taste of blood in my mouth.

When I finally blinked enough to see straight, the road had changed. Forest had thinned into fields. The moon was lower, dragging slow across the sky.

Harlan’s reflection caught in the window. His face was set like stone: jaw locked, shoulders squared, eyes on the horizon.

“Where are you taking us?” I rasped.

The words tasted like iron. Like loss.

Harlan’s hands tightened on the wheel—not because he was nervous, but like he was bracing for me to erupt again.

“Away,” he said.

“That’s not an answer.”

“No,” he agreed softly. “It ain’t.”

We drove in silence. A long one. Heavy enough that I could hear every bump of the tires against the road like a heartbeat.

Houses appeared on the horizon.

A town.

Lights in windows. People inside.

Normal.

My breath hitched. I pushed myself upright.

“There.” I pointed with a shaking hand. “Stop. Pull over. Call someone. The police—anyone—they’ll help—they—”

Harlan didn’t even slow down.

“Not here,” he said. “Not them.”

“Why?” I felt my voice tear at the end. “Why not!?”

“They’d take you right back,” he said matter-of-factly. “Family’s got hands in things around here. Deep hands. Quiet ones. You go to the sheriff? You’d be in the back of a truck to the farm by morning.”

I stared at him, numb and furious.

“Then what?” I spat. “What, we just drive until the gas runs out?”

“If we need to.”

“And Elenor?” The rage surged again so fast it made the edges of my vision go white. “We left her—WE LEFT HER THERE—”

Harlan didn’t flinch. Didn’t defend himself. He carried my words like they were supposed to hurt.

“I know,” he said quietly. “And I’m sorry.”

Those words hit harder than the shove into the truck, harder than the night air in my lungs.

I swallowed hard. “Why did you even help me?”

Another long stretch of highway passed before he answered.

His voice was smaller when it came.

“I remember what it felt like,” he said, eyes still on the road. “Knowin’ there was nothing I could do. Knowin’ she wasn’t comin’ back.”

I turned my head toward him slowly.

“Who?”

“My wife.” Barely a whisper. “Clara’s mama.”

I didn’t speak.

He kept his hands on the wheel, thumbs pressed tight like he was holding on to the past through the steering column.

“Met her in town,” he said. “’Bout sixty years ago now, if you can believe it. Pretty thing. Real smart. Had a laugh that’d warm a barn in winter.” He smiled, sadly, remembering. “She took a shine to me. Don’t know why. I was just workin’ the orchards then.”

The truck hummed, steady and low.

“She wanted a place to settle. Somewhere quiet.”

He let out a breath. “Thought the farm seemed peaceful. I didn’t know better. Not then.”

My nails dug into my palms.

“She didn’t either,” he said. “Not till she started showin’ with Clara. That’s when she heard ’em callin’ the baby theirs. When she saw how the land don’t let go of what it touches.”

My throat burned.

“She tried to leave,” I murmured.

He nodded once.

“Three of us did. Her, me, the baby. We got caught before we hit the treeline.”

His voice wavered for the first time.

“Then they killed her.”

Silence swallowed the cab.

Every breath in my chest felt too sharp, like breathing through broken glass.

“They spared me ’cause I was useful,” Harlan said. “And ’cause Clara needed someone who loved her.” He swallowed. “I stayed for her. Only reason I stayed.”

A long beat. His hands gripping the wheel.

“And now she’s gone too.”

I didn’t know what to say. Didn’t know if I wanted to say anything at all. But the hatred that had been boiling inside me… it shifted. Not into forgiveness. Not into softness. Into something empty. Like there was nothing left to burn.

We passed the town entirely.

Houses disappeared.

Road widened into open dark.

Harlan didn’t speak again.

I didn’t either.

Just the hum of the engine. The ache in my chest. The ruin of everything behind us.

Hours slipped by like water through shaking fingers.

Only then, when we were swallowed by mountains, when the moon had shifted its place in the sky, did Harlan’s voice return, quiet and worn thin. 

“Almost there.”

I looked at him.

His jaw was different. Looser. Skin sagging where it hadn’t sagged before. The line of his neck mottled with age spots.

My breath stuttered.

“Harlan,” I said. “What’s happening to you?”

He didn’t answer.

“Hey—look at me—what’s wrong with your face—why do you look—”

He cleared his throat. It sounded like leaves scraping together.

“Ain’t had a drink,” he repeated. “Not since last night.”

It hit me all at once.

“You’re aging,” I whispered.

He didn’t nod. Didn’t deny it.

His eyes stayed straight on the road.

“…S’what happens.”

He didn’t speak again.

The road wound upward into the mountains, the kind of climb that made the engine strain and the world fall away behind us. Pines thickened around the shoulders of the highway, black trunks spaced like watchmen. The air outside the cracked window grew colder, sharper.

My hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

Not from fear.

From the way everything inside me had come undone.

After what felt like another hour—maybe more, maybe less—Harlan flicked the turn signal.

“Here we are,” he murmured, mostly to himself.

The truck turned down a narrow gravel road. Stones spit and skittered beneath the tires. The headlights cut across a small clearing; just enough space for the truck to park crooked beside a lone oak tree.

A massive one. Wide-limbed. Stubborn. Beautiful.

Harlan put the truck in park. But he didn’t move.

His hands stayed on the wheel a long time, fingers curled and pale. The skin around his knuckles looked different: thinner, stretched over bone. His hair, dark just hours ago, glinted with silver in the moonlight coming through the windshield.

“Harlan,” I said again. “Talk to me.”

He finally let go of the wheel. His hands dropped into his lap, wrinkled and old. When he turned toward me, something inside my chest yanked tight.

He looked seventy. Eighty. Older.

But his eyes… they were still him.

“I’m bein’ selfish,” he said softly. “Bringin’ you here. But I ain’t got long. You deserve… some truth. ’Fore I go.”

He opened the truck door.

Cold wind rushed in, raising goosebumps along my arms. I watched him circle the hood, moving slower now, each step deliberate like he was feeling the ground beneath his feet in a new body.

I forced myself out of the cab and followed him toward the oak.

The view hit me like a punch.

The mountain range stretched out beneath us, pale blue and silver under the moon, peaks jagged and unreal. The land rolled away in waves, so big it made everything inside me feel small. Insignificant. Temporary.

Harlan lowered himself to sit with his back against the oak. It took effort. His knees didn’t bend right. His breath shook.

But when he settled, some peace found him. Not joy. Just… relief.

“Clara’s mama brought me here once,” he said quietly, running a hand over the grass beside him. “Said it was her favorite place in the world. Said the land felt honest up here. Clean.”

He swallowed.

“I ain’t been back since.”

The wind tugged at his shirt. The moonlight softened the deep lines on his face. His eyes glistened: not with tears, but with memory.

“I used to picture bringin’ Clara here,” he continued, voice fraying at the edges. “Showin’ her the ridge. The sunrise. Teachin’ her how to track elk. How to build a fire tall enough to keep away the cold.”

His voice broke, barely, but I heard it.

“She never got to see any of it.”

I sank down beside him without thinking. Maybe his grief was the only thing that felt real. Maybe I had nothing else to give. Maybe, through everything, all I could do was look at the view.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered. It was all I had left.

He nodded once.

“Me too.”

The moon climbed higher. The mountains brightened. Harlan’s shadows grew deeper, skin loosening around his jaw, his hair turning almost white right in front of me.

“How long?” I asked.

His breath hitched, shallow and effortful. He stared at the horizon for a long moment.

“He was the first, y’know” He said at last. “Ezekiel. If you think I got old… hell. That bastard had centuries on me.” He let out a thin, humorless laugh. “More Stillwater than man by the end. Killing him…” He swallowed. “Killing him was a mercy. Maybe the only good thing I ever did.”

He looked out at the mountains one last time. His eyes softened in a way I hadn’t seen before.

“I wish I could’ve taken you here, Clara,” he murmured.

Then he closed his eyes.

His chest lifted once—steep, shuddering—then eased down.

And didn’t rise again.

The wind moved through the oak, shaking loose a handful of dry leaves that drifted down and settled against his shoulder like a blanket.

I sat there a long time.

Long enough for the moon to slide across the sky. 

Long enough for everything to feel too wide, too empty.

When I finally stood, my legs barely held me. I made it to the truck. The engine started right away.

I didn’t look back. Not because I couldn’t bear it. 

Because if I did, I’d want to stay and die right there beside him.

\*\*\*

It’s been a year.

A year of pretending sunlight feels normal.

A year of sleeping with the lights on.

A year of waiting for something under the floorboards to breathe.

Coming home didn’t feel like coming home. It felt like slipping into a life I’d already stepped out of. My friends asked about the *trip*. So did my boss. Even the barista smiled at me like I’d just come back from a honeymoon.

“How was your vacation?”

“Where’s Elenor?”

“Did you two elope?”

“You guys really dropped off the grid!”

I didn’t understand any of it until someone showed me my own text messages.

Messages I didn’t write.

Whole conversations. Weeks of them. 

Telling friends and coworkers that El and I were taking time away. That we needed space from work. That we were “off the map for a bit.”

That we were happy. That I was fine.

They even messaged my landlord. Broke my lease for me. Told him I wouldn’t be coming back.

Crazy what a family like theirs can do when they have your phone for a month.

I went to the police. Of course I did.

I sat in a gray room and told them everything: every impossible detail, every inch of tunnel and heartbeat and Stillwater. They looked at me like I was crazy.

“Son… are you sure you’re not confused about what happened?”

A week later they called me back in.

Said they had “verified information.”

Said Elenor had contacted them. 

Said she confirmed everything was fine.

Said she and I had decided not to get married after all.

Said she wanted privacy.

They showed me the voicemail.

It was her voice. The cadence. The softness. It made me feel homesick.

“Alex, please stop. I’m okay. I’m happy. I don’t want to be found.”

After that, the police stopped returning my calls.

I stopped going.

I moved in with Brian—my old coworker.

He didn’t ask for explanations. 

Didn’t ask why I woke up screaming.

Didn’t ask why I checked the sink every morning to make sure the water ran clear.

He just… let me exist.

Even when I pushed him away.

Even when I forgot to eat for days.

Even when I sat in the shower fully clothed because the sound of running water made me shake.

He stayed anyway.

Sometimes I think he’s the only good thing left in my life.

Sometimes I think he’s the only reason I didn’t go back sooner.

But a year is a long time to outrun something that lives in your bones.

I feel it now, that hum under the skin. That tug. That slow, patient pulse.

I dream of roots crawling through my windows.

I dream of Elenor’s voice through the floorboards. 

Not pleading. 

Calling. 

Calling me home.

Maybe the Stillwater marked me.

Maybe it never let me go.

Maybe it’s something simpler.

Maybe I miss her.

But now I sit on the road that just ends, writing down everything I can before the words stop mattering.

The night is cold.

The moon is full.

And it’s time for me to return to Stillwater.
