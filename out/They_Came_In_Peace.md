My fingers tremble as I type this. Not from fear—though God knows there's enough of that—but from the laughter. Hysterical, broken laughter that bubbles up whenever I remember how eagerly we reached for their outstretched hands.

Three days ago, they arrived. Not with explosions or ultimatums like our films predicted. Just silence. Presence. Twelve massive vessels materializing simultaneously in Earth's orbit, each positioned above a major population center. Perfect geometric structures of shifting opalescence, like fractals carved from dawn light.

Humanity collectively held its breath.

I was presenting at an astrophysics conference in Geneva when the first vessel appeared overhead. My keynote on "Communication Protocols for Potential Non-Human Intelligence" became instantly obsolete as my audience's phones lit up with notifications. We abandoned the auditorium en masse, stumbling outside with everyone else to stare upward. The sky—that familiar Swiss blue—now cradled something impossible. I remember Dr. Kapur gripping my arm so tightly it left bruises, whispering, "Aris, your models were right. They're here."

Twenty years of being ridiculed for my "fringe theories" about advanced non-carbon lifeforms. Twenty years of grant rejections. And now, vindication—watching my life's work hover silently above Lake Geneva.

For six hours and twenty-three minutes, they simply waited. Global militaries scrambled jets that could do nothing but circle the untouchable vessels. Religious leaders proclaimed everything from salvation to damnation. Markets crashed. Social media devolved into noise.

I called my sister in Boston. "Keep Ella inside," I said, though I had no reason to believe my thirteen-year-old niece was in danger. Something primal in me—the animal brain beneath the Ph.D.—whispered caution.

Then, the Communion began.

Not through broadcasts or speakers. Through our minds. A gentle pressure behind the eyes, like tears that wouldn't fall. Like standing too quickly after lying down—that momentary gray narrowing of vision—but instead of fading, it intensified into the clearest thought I'd ever experienced:

*We are the Vanguard. We come in peace. We bring evolution.*

The sensation was... intoxicating. Around me, hardened skeptics wept openly. Dr. Jameson—who once spent an entire department meeting arguing that the Drake Equation proved we were alone in the universe—fell to his knees, face transfigured with rapture. A lifetime atheist myself, I felt something uncannily like reverence wash over me, drowning my scientific detachment in a tide of wonder.

The mass panic subsided so quickly it should have been our first warning sign.

When they descended—beings of luminous architecture, their forms constantly shifting like liquid crystal—crowds gathered without fear. I pushed through the throng in Geneva's Place des Nations, academic caution warring with an inexplicable need to be closer. Their movements defied physics, each step less a contact with earth than a negotiation with gravity itself. They had no discernible faces, just smooth, reflective surfaces that mirrored our own expressions back at us—always slightly improved, slightly more serene.

I reached out my hand toward one that glided past. It paused, turned toward me. In its surface, I saw myself—not as I was, gray-streaked hair disheveled from sleepless nights of research, eyes permanently shadowed from staring at screens—but as I could be. Radiant. Fulfilled. Understood.

The miracles began immediately. Atmospheric carbon levels plummeted as their orbital platforms initiated some kind of molecular restructuring. Terminal patients walked from hospitals, cellular degeneration not just halted but reversed. They offered schematics for energy generation that made nuclear fusion look primitive—unlimited power with zero waste.

My niece, Ella. Stage four leukemia. Three months to live, they'd said. My sister had been planning her funeral instead of her high school graduation. I flew back to Boston that night, arriving just in time to watch Ella walk through one of their "ascension mists" in Boston Common. The nebulous vapor glistened like morning dew as it enveloped her thin frame, her bald head. For seventeen seconds—I counted—she was invisible within that mercurial cloud.

When she emerged, she was running. Actually running, for the first time in eight months. Her hair—a quarter inch of new growth—gleamed copper in the sunlight.

The next day, her oncologist could find no trace of cancer. Not remission—erasure. As if the disease had never existed. My sister pressed her face against my shoulder and sobbed, "You were right, Aris. The universe is kind after all."

How do you question salvation when it stands before you, hand outstretched?

Scientific rigor demanded skepticism. But each test we ran confirmed their benevolence. Their technology defied our understanding but produced measurable, positive results. Global conflicts ceased—not from diplomatic breakthroughs, but from a collective shift in priority. What was border security compared to first contact? What was religious difference compared to cosmic communion?

For seventy-two hours, Earth experienced what could only be described as paradise.

They called it Harmonization. We called it a miracle.

They spoke of a galactic community awaiting us. Of Earth as the newest jewel in an interstellar civilization spanning eleven galaxies. Of evolutionary leaps that would transform humanity into something greater, unbounded by our current limitations. They asked for nothing in return. Nothing except trust.

I documented everything, analyzing their energy signatures, the composition of their vessels, the biochemical changes in "healed" humans. The data was revolutionary but consistent. These beings, whatever they were, had mastered manipulation of reality at the quantum level.

And yet...

Small discrepancies began to emerge. Microsecond glitches in the Vanguard's movements when they thought no one was watching. The way household pets refused to enter rooms where they had been. The dreams—reported with increasing frequency—of falling upward into geometric patterns that shouldn't exist in three-dimensional space.

During a secure video conference, my colleague Dr. Tanaka in Tokyo shared thermographic imagery showing the Vanguard operated at 12.7 Kelvin—a temperature that should render molecular movement impossible. "Perhaps," he theorized, his voice hushed despite our encrypted connection, "they exist partially outside our dimensional constraints. Perhaps what we see is merely the projection—the shadow—of something larger."

I remember checking my watch. 3:16 PM Eastern Standard Time. I remember asking, "But what would be the evolutionary advantage of—"

At precisely 3:17 PM, Dr. Tanaka vanished.

Mid-sentence, he simply ceased to exist. His clothes collapsed onto his empty chair. His coffee mug shattered on the floor. Simultaneously, reports flooded in worldwide. People disappearing from cars, beds, sidewalks. No pattern to age, ethnicity, location, belief system. Just... gone.

2.3 billion people. One-quarter of humanity, evaporated in an instant.

The remaining population descended into hysteria. Looting. Suicides. Mass pilgrimages to the Vanguard vessels. I joined a group of scientists and government officials who sought audience with the beings, demanding answers.

They seemed... different. Their movements more rigid. The surfaces that had reflected our faces now showed distorted versions—our features elongated, eyes too large, mouths too wide. The thought they projected was clear but cold:

*Separation necessary. Inefficient elements removed. Continuation proceeds.*

That night, I couldn't sleep. Ella slept in my sister's bed, both of them finding comfort in proximity after the day's horror. I stood at my window, watching the empty streets of Brookline. A luminous form glided through the darkness below. One of the Vanguard, moving with that familiar liquid grace.

Except—it wasn't quite right. Like an actor who had rehearsed a role but couldn't maintain it indefinitely. Its luminous form flickered—just for a microsecond. In that instant, I glimpsed something beneath. Something angular. Segmented. Wrong.

The illusion, once cracked, began to shatter entirely.

By dawn, the sky had changed. Not the clean blue they'd restored, but streaked with colors that had no names in human language. Colors that hurt to perceive. The air carried scents that triggered primal fear responses—not rotting or burning, but something worse. Something that predated our evolutionary capacity to identify threats.

My sister shook me awake, tears streaming down her face. "Ella's gone," she whispered. Not vanished like the others—worse. She was sitting at the kitchen table, staring at nothing, responding to nothing. Her body present but emptied of whatever made her Ella.

And she wasn't the only one. Reports flooded in of people found catatonic, their eyes fixed on something no one else could see. Some began to change—subtle at first, then with increasing speed. Crystalline structures erupting from skin. Additional joints forming in limbs. Eyes developing nictitating membranes.

Their vessels transformed. The opalescent surfaces collapsed like shed skin, revealing architectures that violated Euclidean geometry. Structures that seemed to extend inward, impossibly larger inside than out. Not ships. Anchors. Points where something else could breach our reality.

And the Vanguard themselves... God, the Vanguard. Their beautiful forms stuttered like corrupted data. With each glitch, the truth emerged. Segmented limbs too numerous to count. Mouthparts designed for feeding that could never be mistaken for communication. Eyes—so many eyes—arranged in patterns that suggested intelligence far removed from anything human, anything mammalian, anything terrestrial.

The thought they projected changed:

*Preparation complete. Veil thinned. Gateway opened. Consumption begins.*

From the vessel above Washington D.C., something emerged. Not a being. A wound in reality. A vast, reaching darkness composed of angles that shouldn't exist, casting shadows that fell upward. Where it touched the air, matter unraveled. Physics itself surrendered.

I understood then. The Vanguard hadn't come to save us. They'd come to prepare us. To fatten the livestock. To prime our reality for something older than stars.

Those who disappeared—perhaps they were the lucky ones. Because what followed was worse than extinction. It was transformation.

The "healing mists" deployed during the first days? They weren't healing. They were altering. Rewriting human biology to make us compatible with—digestible by—whatever now entered through the wounds in our sky.

I found Mrs. Chen from apartment 4B sitting in her living room, Bible open to Revelation. Her eyes hollow with vindication as she whispered, "Not aliens. Never aliens. 'And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.'" The Rapture, she believed. The worthy taken before tribulation. The rest of us left for what comes after.

But this wasn't divine judgment. This was consumption. Predation on a cosmic scale.

Outside my sister's apartment, I watched a child—no more than five—stand transfixed before one of the Vanguard. Its form glitched constantly now, not bothering to maintain the benevolent illusion. The child reached up, curious. Where their hands met, the child's flesh began to ripple, to reconfigure. He didn't scream. He smiled as his body unmade itself, molecule by molecule, into something that no longer belonged to our evolutionary tree.

I ran. Grabbed my research tablet and what food I could carry. Left my sister—no longer my sister—staring at the ceiling, her skin hardening into iridescent plates.

This isn't science anymore. Science requires rules, consistency. What's happening now unmakes rules. Unmakes consistency. Unmakes reality.

I've been moving through Boston's underground for hours. The T tunnels. Maintenance corridors. Places deep enough that perhaps they haven't noticed me yet. My colleagues—those I can reach—report the same phenomena worldwide. The streets run with substances that aren't blood. Crystalline structures grow from buildings like cancers. The sky... the sky isn't there anymore. Just a vast, watching darkness populated by geometries that drive observers mad.

Our planet was never in danger from climate change or nuclear war. Those were mercies compared to our actual fate. We were an experiment in cultivation. A crop reaching harvest.

My battery is failing. The power grid collapsed hours ago. I can hear them searching. Methodical. Patient. Hungry. Not just the Vanguard now, but what they've made of us. Former humans moving with too many joints, calling out in voices that sound almost like those they once had.

Ella's voice, calling my name from the darkness ahead.

If you're reading this, you have two possibilities: either you were among those taken, spared what came after, or you're in another reality, one still maintaining the illusion of cosmic benevolence. If it's the latter, remember this: salvation never comes easily. Evolution is not painless. And when they descend in light, offering peace...

Run.

Because heaven isn't empty.

Heaven was never the point.
