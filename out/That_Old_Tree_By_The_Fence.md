There was a tree in the edge of the yard that seemed to go endlessly. The tree stretched past the wrought-iron fence that separated the house's land from the endless nature of the world around it. The tree had seen things, my new friend James had told me, when I mentioned it to him. I lived out in the outskirts of this small city-town province in Southern New Mexico, and it was certainly something that I had never entirely questioned. The tree looked wise, roots spreading out from the ground, out from the corner of the fence that cornered it, a part of it that could probably trip anyone. My Mom always told me to watch my step, otherwise I'd fall and split my head on the roots that were as hard as a rock. I never fully understood why she'd say that, but... I was a good 7-year old girl, and as such I did take great heed to never go near that, considering how, noises seemed to always permeated whenever one went near there. Soft scratches and cracking. As if the tree was so old that even existing seemed to cause the wood such great strain that even with the slightest disturbance, cracks would be heard. It seemed weird, looking back, considering how it would make these noises without any provocation. 

A memory of mine that I had comes to mind here. I was no older than 8, hanging out with James and a  few other friends during the late months summer break from our Second Grade year, and at that time, they decided that my place, despite the clear distance from the others it was. Fairness, was what James' parents had said, everyone had to go to another's house to show fairness and trust. So there we were, a group of 6 eight-year olds, in the backyard, my parents watching while catching their shows on the television that always seemed to have signal despite us being in the outskirts. The discussion, naturally would go towards the tree, when one of James' friends, Kenny, would turn to me, and ask.

" Abby, why doesn't your folks remove that tree? Looks like it's dead, my Pa said that if a tree doesn't show leaves once a year, its a lost cause- "  I'd blink for a second, before glancing at the tree, it had, from my memory at the time had never shown even the slightest bit of leaf, considering how every other tree in town seemed to have that, and even they too had a time where they looked identical, crisp autumn leaves blowing through the wind before getting crunched through the ground by passing feet. Yet, this tree had never given me or my family any of that. A mercy, my frugal parents would say, they held many many memories of the struggles having to rake leaves and teasing me that I'm so lucky to have that tree, I'll never had to suffer that job. Yet, here I was, wondering that, before I'd make a comment myself.

"I dunno, I guess it was just a part of the house? My Ma's all about the sentimental value, like, give her a vase, she'll make a big deal about why it needs to be kept there, even if it looks like vom-" I'd pause hearing a much... different noise. At first, it sounded like a cracking sound, but then seemed to go longer than it did before, as if it was a groan, from something in pain- and one by one, all of our faces would turn pale, we all tilted towards the tree. I'd... slowly get up, legs buckling as I'd brush some of the dust off my skirt, as I'd take a step towards it, dried grass against the soles of my feet as I'd approach the tree, much larger and honestly more aged in the darkness, the old sage seemingly a visage for a emancipated leper- one who has well went past its deserved time. I'd step over the highest root, a sort of staircase, as I'd lean onto the fence, looking upwards, leaning past to see if there was a coyote, or some other animal in pain, There was nothing, but there was a slight whiff of something... rancid- I'd crinkle my nose before pulling away, feeling a bit sick to my stomach, almost slipping before I moved backwards, still pale. "L-Let's go inside... I think it's getting late- "  James would give me a glance in confusion as I'd just make an eye movement just displaying that I didn't wanna talk about it, before I went and told my Mom about it. She'd go outside the next morning, and told me she couldn't find anything, or smell anything for that manner- I'd insist that I didn't imagine anything however. Of course, my Mom chalked this off as some form of 'hyperactive imagination' or whatever.

Weeks would pass after this, and I would mostly forget about this, considering how the constant drama had once again begun with Third Grade consisting of who had cooties now, who had stuck the gum in Susie's hair then, and more and more petty childhood drama in the soap opera that was elementary school seemed to just erase whatever nervousness had come, until one evening, around early October, we were hanging out at my house again, this time for a sleepover. It was a Sunday Night, somehow I had managed to convince my parents to take me, James and Kenny to school for the next day, so there we were. Three kids just telling each other spooky stories and playing games of chicken. The conversation would once again fall back to that tree.

"So... did they ever find anything, Abs? ", James would ask, running a hand through his messy hair that he always seemed to never have combed, as Kenny just had the most shit-eating grin as an idea had formed in that head, waiting on my answer.

"No... apparently not even that smell- which made zero sense, but I haven't heard much from it, maybe since I haven't been making a effort to look at it- " I'd see his grin at this point, before glaring at him with as much scorn an eight-year-old girl could give, "Kenny, NO- I'm not going out there again- it's dark- "

Kenny would just close his eyes, grin still present. "What? Are you too... CHICKEN!?" Making a clucking sound, teasing me, as rage would form in my expression, before he'd soften his, "Okay, okay, what if we went with you this time? Would that be better? " My expression softened in response, taking a deep breath, maybe having more of us with evidence may make a better belief if there was something!? Taking this with a deal, the three of us would begin to plot, my father was a heavy sleeper, meaning if we were careful, we could sneak out with little effort, and as such, when the clock struck the forbidden time of 11:31 PM, we would slowly walk our way past the couch of my slumbering father- outside and over the opposite edge of the lawn, which seemed much larger now that it was truly night, forbidden hours. We'd reach the edge of the fence, and with them taking my much more confident hand, all three of us were now hanging over the fence, looking with our limited vision as the smell seemed to pervade my nostrils again, my olfactory senses, as I'd cringe for a second, the other two getting the same scent moments later, hacking up as the scent seemed to be stronger than it was before... as the groaning sound emerged again, the crackling and snapping being heard again from the inner workings of the tree.

This was starting to get a bit much, as I would go to feel the tree, as suddenly the noise would stop, as I'd tap the trunk, feeling a bit of hollowness, before picking at the edge of the tree- trying to see if the tree was hollow as it was hinting, before... i felt something that made me fall back. I'd rush back towards my friends, pale, my finger feeling numb as I notice that it was numb, blood leaking out from it, as I'd stare at the tree, petrified, before letting out a loud, terrified scream that woke up my parents, both of them rushing out, confused, and terrified... I didn't know what happened, all I knew is... that SOMETHING TOUCHED ME- and I wanted that tree GONE-. I was picked up by my dad, the other two being led back inside, but as I looked back, I swore I saw, at the corner of my vision, some figure moving outwards- away.

A few more weeks would pass, my parents ordered the tree to be removed, it was too dangerous, and considering how I refused to speak for days after the event, my original concern was needing research. Searching the tree would find a grisly sight. The scent that was being smelt... was a pile of corpses, decomposed, some coytotes, some peacocks, and the most unnerving of it all, there  seemed to be evidence of human fecal matter... as if someone- had been living in there.
