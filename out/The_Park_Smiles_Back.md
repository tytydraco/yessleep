Twenty years ago, Disneyland shut down over night.

They called it “structural instability,” but the public knew better. People talked. Stories leaked. Rides derailed, flinging screaming guests into concrete. The Pirates of the Caribbean kept returning with fewer people than it started with. The worst was what they caught on camera:

Mickey mouse, holding a child’s hand.  
Cut to static.  
Next frame—Mickey’s posing with a new group of guests.  
The child? Gone.

More kids vanished. Some with Mickey. Others with Goofy. But it always ended the same: 

Smiles on the mascots' faces. Missing children

Eventually, they closed the gates for good. The public moved on.  
But Disney didn't

Over the years, thrill-seekers kept breaking in. Paranormal investigators. Explorers. YouTubers. Some made it back. Most didn’t.

To deter intrusions, Disney installed Private security teams. Non-lethal weapons, patrol dogs, drones—the usual deterrents. During the day, two security cars sat at each entrance. At night? Full squads roamed the empty park in shifts.

I was one of them.

Last week, my unit did a routine head count at the end of our shift.

We were one short

Nobody saw him leave. Nobody heard anything.

The next night, we saw Goofy.

He stood at the edge of Tomorrowland, his head tilted at an unnatural angle, red stains on his gloves and costume head. He waved at us.

Then he started running.

He chased three of our guys through the park. We heard screaming. One of them never came back.

I’m not stupid. I quit the next week, along with the rest of the team. But not before I did something reckless.

I had my bodycam footage.

I uploaded it to YouTube.

It blew up. 2.4 million views in 12 hours. People didn’t know if it was real or an ARG. But they *talked*. They dissected every second. Some said if you paused at 03:17, you could hear a child whisper, “Don’t smile.”

Urban explorers started planning group entries. Reddit threads popped up overnight. TikTok theories flooded the algorithm.

Then Disney threatened to sue me unless I took it down. I didn’t want to fight billionaires. I deleted it.

But it was too late.

Now copies are everywhere. Mirror uploads. Screengrabs. Reaction videos.

So Disney escalated.

They hired military contractors—men with rifles, armor, and orders to kill anything that moves. I know because I still have contacts on the inside.

They’re not guarding a park anymore.

They’re guarding a tomb.

Three nights ago, a group of five urban explorers got in.

They thought they were smart. They had cameras, flashlights, walkie-talkies. They joked about going viral. About being legends.

They split into pairs. 

That's when things went wrong. 

Pair one: Jessica and Chris- Tomorrowland

They heard laughter.

Not recorded. Real. Wet. Guttural.

Then they saw a Mickey Mouse lying on the ground.

Chris reached toward it, and the moment he touched it, they heard:

>

Goofy’s voice. But it was… broken. Like it had been stitched together from corrupted audio files.

Then the chase began. 

Pair two: Mark and Sarrah- Pirates of the Carribean

They climbed into an abandoned ride boat. It moved on its own.

They floated into darkness, surrounded by mannequins in pirate gear. Except the mannequins were wrong- too lifelike, too still. Glassy eyes blinked.

One pirate’s skull split open, leaking blood, not water.

Then the boat tipped slightly, and a shadow leapt from above. 

He tackled Mark into the water and dragged him under. Sarah screamed until she saw the animatronics around her moving, twitching, slowly turning their heads toward her.

She didn’t stop screaming. 

Group reunited: 3:12 am- outside haunted mansion

Three of them made it back.

Soaked. Crying. Rattled. One was injured.

Then they heard footsteps. Slow. Deliberate. 

Goofy emerged from the dark, his gloves soaked, his head torn, his grin unbroken.

The ground shook. The old rides roared to life, without power. The lights flickered.

Far underground, the security cameras turned on. Red lights blinked, recording everything.

The feed? not sent. not stored. just watched.

I haven’t heard from the explorers since.

But I did get an email.  
No sender. No subject.  
Just a single line of text:

>

I’m not going back.  
But some of you will.  
You’ll want proof. You’ll want views.  
You’ll want to *see the Mouse smile.*

Just know one thing before you go:

**The park never closed.**

It’s just waiting.
