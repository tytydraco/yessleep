It is a long story byt if you dont want any backstory then skip to the part where it says THE MAIN PART.

It has happened before tbh had nightmares fow a week after the incident.It was Sept 14 around 7:00pm.
Before me telling that story i need to tell you why and how i ended up in that place. Me and my classmates were returning back from a two day trip it was almost the whole class(only boys around 15 of us) we rented a TT(Tourist Travels which has 14seats(two were damaged)) and my dad’s car(which was agreed at the last moment after seeing our seat problem) i had convinced my parents before to take my car before and only to tell them i will not be needing it on 13th but then on the morning i took it. Apart from having minor inconvineces all went well although it went above budget for me(around 700₹/10$) almost all went fine.

So on 14th night at 7:00pm  we were halfway home we were expected to reach home at 10pm. We just climbed a ghat section which was heavily raining and we were lacking behind the TT and noticed they had stopped for a final break.But we didnt needed one as i had overtaken them before in ghatsection and me and my friends(who were in the car with me lets call them B,C,D as A being me)we needed that break as i wanted to stretch my legs and D needed fresh air as he felt nausious me and C are smokers so we drank some tea and smoked ciggereates and saw our TT over take we went to the spot they were relaxing and this is where the story begins.One final thing i had not mentioned is it was raining real bad yet i was fully concentrated this rain was so bad that i couldnt see a thing apart from the markers on the road sides yet i was fully alerted and now recharged.

THE MAIN PART.
    
  After we and the whole classmates were relaxed we(B,C,D) went back to my car B was sitting next to me he used to go on rides(not an expert but amature yet better than C/D) as D was little sick from the Ghats we climbed he slept and on his lap D slept comfortably me and B we taunted then and we were in our own mood as we chased our TT overtaking them not one but two then we gained about 5-6kms on themas it was still raining. Then another car wanted to overtake me idk why i was in a chill mode something didnt seem right so let him just pass me without thinking there was however another car ahead of me and this new car came between us within a km bam the front two cars turned their cars so hard for a split sec it looked like they were going off roads but i didnt have time for that as i saw what was ahead of me 10ft away from my car i had to do the same too it was some old man with no shirt no pants only in his nicker he was right in the middle of the road i too did the same as last two and barely by two inches we were saved.

There werr a 100thoughts that ran in my head but all i could do in that moment was screm me and B scremaed on top of our lungs like little girls both CD woke up and asked to pull over without knowing tbh that day if i had pulled over i wouldve knocked him but also i knew he wasnt in his right mind i kept driving for the next 10mins my heart was literally out of my chest i had never felt this tnsed as i thought of many things going thru my head like whatif i killed that guy.After another 40-45kms we pulled up and waited for the other bus to arrive after them arriving we told them about the encounter they had the same fucking thing he was missed by inches the thing is its like middle of the forrest nearest village was like 10-20kms ahead and even more the other way.This guy was almost fully naked single and in middle of a single lane road.(side of road was dirt and then forrest so yes if he was in rightmind he couldve walked there). Then it came to my mind there was like literally no way he couldve walked next day coz it was an accident zone kind of roads fully curved and after that day its like no ine ever talksabiyt that how B and i Almost pissed our pants but yet he came to my fuckin dreams for a week.

For everyone its either boring/they just act as if its normal/just make fun of my driving. But for me it was like a horror movie.

Ps ik its a boring story but to live that was a horror for me and after months it came back today.
