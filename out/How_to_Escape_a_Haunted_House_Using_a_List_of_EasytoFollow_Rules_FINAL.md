The smell of food hung in the air. Our stomachs growled instantly. We found ourselves standing in the kitchen.

“Man, I’m heckin’ hungry,” Cassandra said.

“I think it’s from the smell. Maybe it’s getting us high or something like that,” I replied. “But it smells god damn delicious.”

A large pot boiled on top of the gas stove. A fish head stood on the counter, blood and guts beside it from what probably was an earlier evisceration—jars filled with liquids that seemed expired and gross. Dirty knives, forks, and spoons lay scattered on the kitchen counter and floor.

One thing stood out in all that disgusting excuse of a kitchen—a large mason jar filled with gold coins.

Sausage and other various types of meats were nailed to the ceiling. Also, a pig head was stuck in a spike on the left wall with a bucket under it for the blood to drain. The pig had a sort of evil grin on its face, and it looked right at us.

The kitchen led to another room. Loud banging noises came from there. I heard a man’s voice getting angry with each thud.

“God damn bones! Huh? What do I smell there?” the man’s asked himself.

The door busted open, the man stepped inside the kitchen, and we froze.

The man’s belly was enormous, and the goiter was so big that it covered his chin. Beads of sweat formed on his bald head as he looked at us with awe. Vegetable oil, blood and fish scales dripped from his long orange beard. He wore a ripped T-shirt with his cartoonized face that read Papa Bud’s Best Bites.

“Children, welcome!” he exclaimed, belching. “It’s good to have you here! Excuse the mess!”

We stood petrified as we watched that man. Spittle flew from his mouth whenever he talked, and his rotten teeth added to his already horrific demeanor.  At one point, I thought I saw worms in the back of his throat, eating away at his amygdala.

Fat dripped off his fingers. He wiped his hands on his dirty jeans, but the fat kept coming out of his fingers as if it came from inside his skin. He sweated a lot and belched even more.

At first, I thought he was an idiot. One big idiot. But, of course, nothing was what it seemed in that house. And I also remembered the rule. We would get the gold coins only in exchange for a correct answer to one of his riddles.

“What’s your name?” Emma asked.

We all glanced at her, letting her know with our eyes not to speak.

“It says right here on the t-shirt, miss. Bud, short for Budley. I used to be one of the best chefs in the world at some point, you know? Then Edgar Verlice came into my restaurant, and he didn’t like my food. He said it tasted bland. Bland! I had three Michelin stars, for Chrissake!” he said. He belched again, and a cloud of thick green smoke came out from his mouth. “Damn radioactive breath, let me tell ya! Phew!”

Another prisoner for Verlice’s diabolical will.

“How did he make you come here?” I asked.

“Well, he said he’ll kill my momma if I didn’t come and learn to cook here. He been giving me these green pills that make me go kinda insane in the brain. I see stuff that is not there, and that stuff that’s not there tells me things. Right now, it says I need to eat all of you’s fingernails if you don’t gimme the right answer,” he said.

The man was crazy. I pitied him because it wasn’t his fault. The demon Verlice made him like this. He made poor Bud go crazy, and he didn’t even know what he was doing anymore.

“Can we give you something else in exchange for the gold coins?” Vince asked.

“No!” Bud cried. “We have to follow the rules! The rules are important to this house! If we follow the rules, nothing bad will happen!”

We all looked at each other in awe. The white in Bud’s eyes turned red and popped out of their sockets halfway. He stared at us with malicious intent as if possessed by an evil spirit.

“Now, you have only sixty seconds to give a correct answer. If you don’t have one, I’ll pluck all your fingernails with these right-here pliers. I’ll take the ones on your feet too, and make them into a delicious meal,” Bud screamed. He was completely gone. His brain wirings scrambled beyond repair.

***THE RIDDLE***

Not born, but from a Mother's body drawn, I hang until half of me is gone.

I sleep in a cave until I grow old, then valued for my hardened gold.

What am I?

“WHAT’S THE ANSWER, CHILDREN???” he yelled. “YOU WANT THE GOLD COINS, DONTCHA? GIVE ME THE ANSWEEEEEEEEEEER!!!”

My heart wanted to burst out and run from my chest. The pressure and stress became unbearable, and I could imagine how Bud would slowly pull out the nails from my fingers and toes. A shiver down my spine made me cringe at the thought.

“Alright, alright!” Vince screamed.

“So it’s gotta be food related. I mean, this guy’s obsessed with food, right? I mean, look at this place,” David asked.

We had a fast debate. It comes from a mother, but it’s not born. Good for consumption. Cow. Milk. You hang it someplace dark until it turns to something gold.

“It’s gotta be cheese, right?” asked Emma.

“Hurry! Fifteen seconds!” belched Bud.

“Yes. That’s it!”

“Ten!”

I exhaled.

“Five! Four! Thr-“

“CHEESE! IT’S CHEESE!” I exclaimed.

He smashed his fist against the table and roared like a wounded animal. He looked at us with crazy eyes and couldn’t believe he wouldn’t have fingernails for supper that day.

He nodded regretfully and proceeded to open the mason jar with gold coins. He carefully gave us one and pointed to the door we entered through.

We hauled ass in a second and found ourselves in a new room. Clocks ticked all around us. Both old and new clocks covered the walls, , all showing different times. On the ceiling was a large clock with our faces drawn inside it.

“Hey, they missed my face on that thing. Bummer,” a kid’s ghastly voice whispered from behind us.

“What the fuck was that?” Vince said.

“It’s me, Oliver. I’ve been following you for quite some time,” said the voice. “Rule number seven, right? Beware the uninvited guest, blah, blah, blah.”

Out of thin air, a kid with a torn striped pajama. He dragged a beat-up teddy bear with buttons instead of eyes.

He was abnormally thin like a straw, and translucent. I could see his ribs, organs, intestines, everything through him.

“What happened to you, kid?” David asked.

“He’s been lying to you about everything. You will not get out of here alive. I tried to warn you from behind the door, but you wouldn’t listen. So I had to sneak out and warn you all. I told you I was once like you. He promised me and my friends money if we finished the challenge. We did finish, and we got the key from the Clock Master. Then we went into the Room with Crystals, where we were supposed to find the last rule of the game. The last rule said that one of my friends should stay here and the rest could go home. The alternative was that all of us would’ve died,” he said. “Guess who stayed behind.”

“How do we know you’re one of Verlice’s tricks?” Cassandra asked.

“You don’t. You’ll have to trust me if you want to live,” Oliver replied.

He went on with the story. Everyone in the Floating House was dead. Some didn’t even know it. Oliver knew it, but he said he could leave this place until someone burned it to the ground. Bud was dead, trapped in Verlice’s Purgatory. Same with Ilinca, she thought she’d go home if she played a couple more concerts, but that wasn’t bound to happen. That lady with spiders? She didn’t even exist; Verlice made her real only to see if children got scared. If they did get scared, Verlice would be the one to eat them, not the woman The Clock Master? He had a shop in Zurich, and Verlice went there to buy a watch. He liked the man and his skills and decided to make him his personal watchmaker. Alexander Meier was his name. Verlice wanted a watch that moved backward so he could travel to the past and change it.

The watchmaker told him that was impossible, but Verlice told him to make it possible. He gave him powers, knowledge, and everything, but some things could never be attained.

I was absolutely sure that he was telling the truth. We all gathered in a circle, and we were on the same page. The ghost kid was legit.

“I’m buried under the floorboards. We all are. He killed us and somehow didn’t let us rest and brought us back to serve him. He loves this house, but right now, he’s just waiting in the Room with Crystals. He’s resting until you get the second silver key. He gave you one in the beginning so you can enter of your own free will. He gave you $100 just for fun. But know, he wants your bodies and souls, and one of you will die if you don’t follow me. Or you’ll all die,” he sighed.

He told us he’s been in this house for 250 years, and all the children who came after never listened. Verlice killed them all, not many though, and discarded their bodies in the mountains, woods, rivers, deserts, places they would never be found. Oliver was all alone because Verlice wanted him to be and feel alone with no one to talk to.

“I’m so sorry, Oliver,” Cassandra said. “We believe you. Show us the way, and we’ll help.”

“Ok, so he likes to burn the kids' bodies after they’re dead. He likes the smell of burning flesh; he is that sick. I watched him countless times; he takes great pleasure in that. He likes hurting children,” Oliver said.

He told us that Verlice kept cans of gasoline in a tiny closet. He knew where it was and knew about a secret exit he protected so that if anyone would ever listen to him, he could guide them to safety.

“Will it kill Verlice?” asked Eddie. “That monster needs to die so this wouldn’t happen ever again.”

“I sure hope so,” said Oliver. “Let’s set this place of evil ablaze.”

We left the Room with Clocks and walked a long corridor where the cold wind howled, and the air smelled like death.

We entered the room, where there were a few canisters of gasoline. Matchboxes stood on a shelf.

“Think you can carry one each?” Oliver asked.

“Damn right we can,” replied Vince. “I’ll carry two even. Dave, you take two as well. Cass, Em, take the matches, and let’s burn this mother down.”

After that, Oliver led us to a backdoor, where he asked us to open it because he couldn’t grab physical objects. I opened the door, which led to the backwoods. We got out with the gas cans, and Oliver stood teary-eyed in the doorway.

“We got you, buddy. Rest easy now.”

“You all need to pour the gas and light a match. The power of friendship is strong and can destroy evil. So long… my friends,” Oliver said.

The door closed shut. We circled the house and poured all the gasoline from the five-gallon cans.

We lit the matches.

“To friendship. I love you guys,” I said.

“You’re my brothers and sisters,” Vince said.

“Love y’all,” David said.

“Love you lots,” Emma said.

“Best friends forever,” Cassandra said.

“I’ll tattoo your names on my arm, I swear,” said Eddie, giggling.

We set the house on fire. Screams came from inside, high-pitched wails and house as if whatever possessed it died in agony.  I could hear a familiar voice, tormented as the house turned to ashes.

“I will return someday. I am immortal. I will find you again! Mark my words!”

I thought I saw a flame shaped like Verlice’s face. He glanced at me before the wind swept it away. After the flames ended, it seemed like nothing had happened there. The ghost house was no more, and the ground was just as before.

We looked at the stars. Some blinked as if saying hello and sending thanks. Maybe they went to the stars and beyond and wanted to let us know everything was alright.

I hope Oliver, Ilinca, Bud, and Alexander will all be able to rest.

And I also hope Verlice rots in hell.
