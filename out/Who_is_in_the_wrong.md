Make it make sense


I want to tell you a story that pertains to my life directly, but I also want to be as truthful as possible for the audience to make their own conclusion .

In other words, I don’t want to influence what you think at the end of the story based off my perspective so I will try and be as transparent as possible for you to make those conclusions .

I feel like the only or the most fair way to do that is by starting from the beginning.

For legal issues I’m going to change everybody’s name but the locations and everything else will approximately stay the same.

I was born in 1995 on June 25. My name is Brian.
No, I’m not aware of this now, but it will be made to me clear later that I was a mistake.
I was an unplanned baby, and the result of a repeat try from a miscarriage previously, what would’ve been a female.

I grew up in a city outside of Los Angeles and California and my parents were fairly OK. At the time they both were self-employed and had good jobs.

I respectfully my parents much like others are not without fault. But their backgrounds play a heavy influence in their mentality, and approach to everyday situations.

My father is from Texas very stubborn, very hard and glaring man. my mom is from Mexico, Tijuana and her upbringing as hard as it was, was very traumatizing in religious, and it definitely had a long lasting effect on her ability to focus on a conversation.

And I understand that this can easily be perceived as opinion, but I will explain later on that it wasn’t until the age of 28 years old that I realized many others, family members and friends share the same zoomed out perspectives on my parents.

I’m the youngest of four children, the oldest was adopted.

My oldest brother is Max after that is my sister Kaitlyn and then my other brother Johnny.

Max is about eight years older than me. My sister is about six years older than me and my brother Johnny is four years older than me.

My parents always worked constantly and as a result, I only saw them for two hours at the end of each night when my mom was cooking and my dad got home, but I always had my siblings who were always there for me.

My father‘s company that perspectively he technically kind of built off the back of my oldest brother, who is adopted, started to explode, and do very well in construction.

As a result, my father gained financial independence. No longer had to work his day job and merely focused on the construction company that technically now that I’m saying is was started by my mother and her brother as a lawnmowing company that began to accept larger jobs.

Previously, my father was a car salesman, and he talks about it all the time still to the stay if I were to compare him to somebody, not in full retrospect, or to the maximum of it, but he’s very similar to the father out of Matilda, who just wants to get that money, and everyone else can go fuck themselves.

My mom already had a strange mentality at the time from being mentally and physically abused by her mother and others in her childhood home. That’s one thing I am grateful for my father is taking her out of that environment and bringing it into a better place, although that is controversial, because from what I’m told he was not the nicest man and I’ll explain why I can’t remember those things.

We had a nice house yeah outside of Los Angeles in a good city community. It was a four bedroom three bathroom maybe 2600 square-foot house.

Unfortunately, it wasn’t till the age of 14 years old when I was being drowned by my middle brother to the point that my memories flooded me and I guess I had repressed a lot of memories.

In movies, there’s always an epiphany or a great light and you can see what they want you to see the character sees in their head. It’s otherworldly when you actually experience because it is very similar. You do have a flash flood of memories from years and years of your childhood sent back into your cortex in the matter of maybe 60 seconds, and it took me almost dying and drowning for that to come back.

These memories they didn’t come back, until after we had moved in the success of the construction business into a much much nicer home.

Arguably the nicest home on that street and possibly the community till this day.

But it took my brother drowning me in the backyard Jacuzzi in order for me to have that flash flooded memories to realize that my childhood was not as good as I thought.

I’m gonna keep this part brief, but I was sexually molested for several years and I had no idea. I don’t wanna talk about that part anymore because that is not the primary focus of this.

Now, living in this nice new big house, and having all my memories back up, my father abusing my mother and abusing me and my brothers and siblings, making a sleep in the garage with a pellet gun to kill the rats, and only a bread roll for dinner.

Now I know that sounds bad but I’ve seen Netflix and stuff and people have it a whole lot worse so I’m not here to complain about that that is nothing compared to other peoples life and I want you to know I’m extremely grateful for what I have and who I am.

Inside this new big house, no one was ever home. My siblings are always gone. My parents were always gone working and that shouldn’t be a bad thing. I shouldn’t be complaining that they were never home because they’re providing for me but as a result, I was always home alone.

Now I’m gonna try and keep this part short, but I want to give a background history as to myself I’ve always been the spoiled rich kid. My father always led me to believe I was better than everyone else because he had so much money, and I believed it.

Going into high school I was the rich kid I was the rich kid that was going to get a nice car. I did get a nice car. Everyone knew my parents had a lot of money it was spoken of.

But no one knew is that that was not the reality my parents are extremely stingy, greedy, and selfish. Every dollar my dad gave me he tracked to the nearest dime.

In high school I was a fuck up. I got average grade sometimes slightly above average. I wasn’t horrible but then again I wasn’t good. I was a pothead. I hung out with the potheads and it wasn’t till about the middle of 10th grade that I started realizing I don’t wanna be a pothead anymore, so I started making new friends but I continue to smoke.

The biggest problem in my mind is that I was led to believe I had no worries in my life because I would come to adopt my father’s company and be well off for it. I was living in a delusion of nepotism and that’s not fair. I realize that now, but these are all promises that he made to me as a child.

In conclusion, I was an asshole piece of shit, entitled, spoiled motherfucker, and I would try to play every girl at my school. I wanted nothing but women and I wanted to show them how much money we had and get them into bed with me as a result, I was a cheater and an abusive speaker, much like my father.

It wasn’t until the end of high school that I met a woman, and found out that she lived very close to me down the street in fact. Her name was Amanda and Amanda and I started hanging out.

My parents immediately did not like Amanda because Amanda was different. Amanda did not want me to pay for things. She was a year older than me and she would bring me stuff like sushi, food marijuana she’d come over and watch movies stuff like that. 

Now it may be easy for you to proceed this as a bad influence, but I encourage you to make no conclusions until the end of this very long story.

Once I graduated high school I began working for my father and as a result I was getting about $500 every two weeks and the year is probably about 2014.

Now I would work about 7 to 9 hours a day Monday through Friday sometime Saturdays but my pay was fixed because my dad would start telling me I’m charging you for your truck. I’m charging your rent I’m charging you for food. I’m charging you for water and electricity. 

And I had no problem with that. He’s trying to prepare me for the future to become a man and I understood that at the time. 

It wasn’t until I started getting more involved with the business and promoted into the office that I realize that he was not doing this to any of his other children.

For some reason, my siblings had had a different arrangement with my father and I was OK with that at the time.

But then I started doing the math and I realize that he was stealing about $1500 from me every two weeks so $3000 a month and I was left with $1000. I started looking at the bills as I was in the office and I realized that , my expense in me, living with him was nowhere near the amount that he was taking from me.

So I quit and I moved out and thankfully Amanda’s family was more than happy to take me in.

No, this whole scene didn’t happen with me quitting and leaving and moving out without my father and brother beating the shit out of me outside knocking the earrings off my head, taking my money, taking my truck, taking my wallet and half of all my clothes .

It became obvious to me at that point my father wanted to leave me a present in a position of weakness, in order for him to be the savior, and remain his control.

It was at this point in my life that I started to question everything my parents had ever told me, especially the points where they told me as to why they no longer talk to certain family members.

But there’s two sides to every story. And I should’ve known better. 

I did not speak to my parents after that for about four years from the age of 21 to 22 or 23 around there until my father had a heart attack and happened to be at the hospital down the street from the office I was working at.

When I left my house and moved out and got away from my family, it was hard I had no money. I had no car. I didn’t have shit I don’t even have a phone. He took that too.


I legitimately had to start from the bottom, and if it wasn’t for Amanda‘s mother to teach me about credit how to get a car, help me get a job how to get promoted and I did. I got a job as a security guard from my best friend, and from there, I was able to work my way up all the way from the guy that takes all the orders and where to work and went to work to the guy that gives the orders and tells you when to work and where to work.

Another other words, I went from another employee to being the manager supervisor or boss. At that point I was a scheduler, and I was pretty happy with the success that I had done for myself.

Regardless, my dad was about to die I went to go see him they saved his life. He had a second heart attack and after that we talked a little bit here and there.

This is the point in the story, where I have to take a pause for me, speaking about myself directly in order to speak about my siblings.

My oldest brother Max was tired of dealing with my father and my mothers, greed and selfishness so much of the point that when he got married, he even changes his last name and he was the primary driving force of my father‘s construction business after he was married and change his last name, he decided to Move away and start his own business in doing so. Initially he tried to secure the entire business that my father had legally after that failed, and he was not able to steal my father’s business. He started his own business, but he did take about more than half of all the equipment and employees.

At the time when this happened, I was furious with my brother for being such a fucking piece of shit to steal from your own father.

But looking back on it now. I’m not sure he was wrong. How are you gonna do 95% of the work but only collect 40% of the profits it doesn’t make sense. It never made sense but I just accepted it because that was the bullshit my father stuff down my throat.

My father doesn’t talk to Max anymore. Max is now happy with a very successful construction company and two children and I couldn’t be more happy for him.

Now comes my other brother Johnny now upon the success of my parents and their construction company in our second house, they decided they needed a bigger house and even more expensive house so they went ahead and did that in order to help Johnny build credit they decided to put the house in his name.


Johnny and Kaitlyn still work for my father‘s construction company at this time, even after Max left.
On the other hand, I’ve been gone at this point slightly before Max left .

Johnny and Kaitlyn ran that business into the ground by being so unorganized so unprofessional and so un ready to handle the business strictly in my opinion, because of nepotism do not ever hire family unless they have a proven track history of other employment that’s it


So as a result of the failure of that construction business, which was the primary income.

The business was forced to close down, and as a result of the financial stretch that Johnny had he tried to sell my parents home.

Because the house was in his name, he had the legalities necessary in order to sell the house.

With my parents still living there let me mind you.

Thankfully, this was not successful even when my brother reached out to me in the midst of my years, not speaking to my parents I let him know that was fucked up and that he was wrong.


Now at this point in my life, I’ve been living with Amanda and her family for about 4 to 5 years and as a result, my personality has started to change. I become more like their family. I’m a lot nicer. I’m a lot more giving I donate and I’m a lot happier.

Unfortunately, the behaviors that I adopted from my parents were still there and prevalent, and as a result might behavior was less than acceptable at certain times.

Amanda decided to leave me and kicked me out and I’m glad she did I saw a therapist. His name was Gary that’s not a fake name that is actual name and after seven months of therapeutic discussions Gary decided that I was more than mentally OK to continue my journey. 

The main take away that Gary concreted into my mind is that when you’re born you’re born into a family you have no choice of, but you do have a choice of is what you take away there will always be good and bad things and every family what you get decide is what you take away you can take away the good things and you can leave the bad things and that’s what I did.


Because she kicked me out I reached out to my parents they were very hesitant and it took them about a day and a half in order to let me move back into their home and let me tell you they have a seven bedroom house with 4 1/2 bathrooms and it’s just them that lives there on 1 acre. 


Right after I moved in, my father had another heart attack and prior to this heart attack he bought a business. This business was for my sister to be in charge, but let me mind you, my sister has no work experience no genuine work experience, other than watching children and working at daycare, and I don’t mean to disrespect any people that work like that, but that she just practically did whatever was easiest for her in life.


That was extremely offensive to me because I had been able to run somebody else’s business from the ground up at the very bottom working my way up and doing a great job but yet someone with no experience is qualified enough for you to run your company.


My father and mother admitted to me they did not want to put me in charge or give me any responsibility for a company because of my brothers that they loop me in with them and assume that I am just as bad as them.

Fast forward seven months closer to nine months and my parents found out that my sister had been stealing from them the entire time she had so in about $24,101.00.

So of course, they fired her and put me in charge.


At this point, I’m back with Amanda we’re happy and actually Amanda has moved in. I proposed to her and she agreed.

Amanda and I now live at my parents house.

As Amanda and I prepare for our wedding, we take both of our parents with us to Mexico to find a place after we found a place. My mother told me we’re going to give you $10,000 to help you with your wedding.

I had to give you some background history here when I brother Johnny was 22 years old, he impregnated his wife, Heather, and in my opinion, that’s when the business started to fail, because Max didn’t see it as fair for them, and everyone else to take sacrifices in order to support my brothers, dumb decision, and impregnating his girlfriend.

The surprising part was my father didn’t care. He was excited. He was happy to have grandchildren, and as a result he paid for their wedding. He paid for her Mercedes SUV, and he paid for the ring.

When my sister got married, they did not have a formal wedding like my brother, but my parents put together a very big event in their backyard and made sure to pay for everything.

I never wanted to leave my job. I was so happy with what I was doing because I had perfected it. But after my dad’s third heart attack and him, unable to be there in his new business that he just started off, he came to me and asked for help.

So I use my sick time and paid time off in order to attend to him and his business.

After a week of doing so they saw the potential that I had to offer so they made me an offer.


Reluctantly, I took it and the deal was that I was going to get $65,000 a year, and they would pay for my truck which is $522.50 every month and live rent free to offset the additional $20,000-$25,000 that I get from what was my current job.


Seeing my parents in such a bad spot, I accepted


So now comes to the primary reason for this conversation I’ve explained everything to you from the beginning as best I can, and brief my parents, brief history my brief history I was a piece of shit, but now I’m not I actually wouldn’t not hire myself I would trust myself at this point And here’s the main reason.


After Amanda moved in in January 2024, we had found a venue in location for the wedding we had prices I had an Excel sheet everything was laid out when we went to go look for venues. My mother said I will give you $10,000 so Amanda’s mom agreed to match that $10,000.


However, Amanda’s mom paid us $10,000. My parents have yet to give me a dime.


They’re argument is that I live there for free and I had free food or free laundry detergent or free this and that and a constant flood of any excuse they can give me to prevent them giving me money.

Since January of this year my parents have completed their yard spent about $150,000 in their backyard and garage from epoxy , tankless heaters a pool, a barbecue, a freestanding patio.

How do I know this? I do all of their financial work when my parents want something done they can’t trust her other children so they come to me.

I feel like the main reason they don’t want to push away or give any pushback to their kids about helping them financially because they don’t wanna lose their grandkids and I understand that but it’s like my siblings. I’ve also purposely withheld their grandkids or their kids technically from my parents in order to get them to give up money


how do you think my father forgave my brother for trying to steal her house and sell it?

It’s because my brother much like my sister after she stole too threaten my parents to never see their kids again.

Where does that leave me?


I was the responsible one that walked away. He chose not to have kids to continue and finish school. Find a good woman get married first and then have kids but I’m being punished for what?


That is the primary focus of this conversation I feel like I’ve been as brief as I could’ve been, and I’m more than happy to be more elaborate, and even write out of 55 page essay for everybody to understand the full depth of the situation for them to come to a genuine conclusion, based on their own perspective.

But my main question to you guys is am I fucking wrong am I crazy for thinking my parents are assholes and just a piece of shit couple?

How am I left to feel when you get to my siblings who have taken you and me nothing who has done nothing but given to you?

That’s my main question?

Am I the one that is wrong?
