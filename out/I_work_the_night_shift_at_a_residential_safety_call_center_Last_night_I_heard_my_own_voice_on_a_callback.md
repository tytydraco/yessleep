The first thing they told us during training was that we weren’t an emergency service. We were “preventative.” We kept people from calling 911 by answering the smaller, weirder questions before they got big.

The second thing they told us was never to improvise.

Every call has a flowchart. A symptom leads to a page number in the manual. The page has a checklist, a few questions, and a script: lines to calm someone down, instructions to try, things to avoid. If the caller strays outside the script—if anything smells off, or repeats, or skips steps—we transfer to a supervisor and mute our mic.

“Don’t make it personal,” my trainer said, tapping the blue binder. “The manual knows your house better than you do.”

By the time I took my first overnight shift, the binder’s corners were fuzzy from the previous operator. Someone had written a handful of notes in pink highlighter that bled through the paper:

* Don’t repeat the caller’s name more than once.
* If they whisper “are you there?” twice, you aren’t the only person listening.
* If the tapping comes in threes, it’s not a bird.

Mostly, though, it was ordinary stuff. Dryer vents. Rust in the water. Neighbor’s kid kicking a ball against the siding. A raccoon that learned how to knock.

At 1:12 a.m., I took a call from a woman in the suburbs who swore something was “fluttering” in her attic. I led her through the page on trapped bats. Turn off lights upstairs, open a window, stand by the door with a towel, don’t swat. I held the line until she said it slipped out into the night. Her voice shook. You’d think relief would sound like laughter, but it often sounds like exhaustion. I logged it, marked “resolved,” and looped back to the top of the flowchart.

At 2:02 a.m., a man asked if it was safe to open his door. “My neighbor’s out there. Says he locked himself out. But he’s… off.”

We have a page for that. You probably think it’s “stranger at the door,” but it isn’t. It’s a neighborhood page—“Familiar Face, Unexpected Hour.” The checklist asks for three things: the neighbor’s address, the shared property line, and a trivial piece of neighborhood gossip only the two of them would know (“Whose dog ate your azaleas?”).

The man asked all three. The neighbor got the address right, stumbled on the property line, and laughed too late at the dog question. I told my caller to apologize through the door and say he’d call a locksmith on his behalf. “You don’t owe anyone your door,” the script reads. He thanked me. I could hear the smile in his voice just before I heard the knock flatten and smear out into something like a palm dragged down glass. The sound moved away.

I logged that one as “advised—suspicious.”

Then there was the call at 3:41 a.m.

“Residential Safety Line, this is Martin, how can I—”

Static. Then a tremor, like someone trembling close to the phone. A girl spoke so quietly I had to turn my headset all the way up.

“Something’s dripping. Under the sink. It smells like pennies.”

I found the page on “Unexplained Odors—Metallic,” flipped to the cross-reference. There are three common reasons for copper smells in a house: old pipes, electrical overheating, and blood. The manual is practical to a fault; it doesn’t say “blood.” It says: “If metallic odor appears with *unaccounted-for moisture* and *animal quiet*, proceed to page 47.”

Animal quiet—a weird phrase, but you’d learn it if you worked here. If the birds and bugs go completely silent, sometimes it means a storm. Sometimes it means something else.

“Where are you?” I asked, because page 47 starts with location.

“Kitchen,” she whispered. “Mom’s asleep. I’m not supposed to… I can’t… something’s behind the cabinet.”

“How long has it been dripping?”

She didn’t seem to know. That happens, too. The manual says: people don’t feel the passage of time when they’re scared. Ask for numbers—but don’t trust them.

“Okay,” I said, flipping pages, “I’m going to ask you a few questions. You’ll hear me turn pages; that’s normal. I’m here. Do not touch the cabinet. Do not look directly into dark gaps or holes. Do you have any pets?”

“Fish,” she said. “In the den. The filter’s off. It’s… everything’s quiet.”

Page 47 was paper-clipped to a note in pink highlighter: **Skip to 47B if odor precedes drip.** That detail mattered; it moves you to a different branch. The girl had said something was dripping *and* it smelled like pennies. Which came first?

“Did you smell the pennies first, or the drip?”

“The drip,” she said immediately.

I should’ve felt relief. That would keep me in 47A, which is the safe branch. Tell the caller to shut off main water, stand in the hallway, and *wait* for you to confirm a few checks. If the drip changes rhythm when they move—if it “listens”—you escalate. If the drip continues regular and the smell fades, you’re probably dealing with old pipes and a fear spiral. It happens a lot. Almost every page ends with “You did the right thing by calling.”

I made her talk to me while she found the water shutoff. She was trying to be brave—breathing too evenly. She placed the phone on the counter. The sound of her bare feet on tile was louder than the drip. Then there was the turn of a stiff valve and a shaky exhale through her nose.

“It’s still dripping,” she said. “It’s louder now.”

Louder isn’t in my script. It’s either “unchanged,” “faster,” or “stopped.”

“Okay,” I said, even though the manual tells you not to say that if you’re not sure. “Stand in the doorway to the hall. Put your back on the frame. Are the house animals quiet?”

“I told you, just fish,” she said, with a damp little laugh that sounded like someone else’s. “It smells stronger. I think it heard me.”

The pink note in the margin: **If they say “I think it heard me,” skip to supervisor.** Because that phrase shows up on three different pages, none of them good.

I hovered over the TRANSFER key. The supervisors hate getting calls that aren’t “clean,” but the binders say to move them anyway.

“Martin?” the girl whispered, before I could press it. “The drip stopped.”

I stopped, too. The headset made me too attentive to my own breathing.

“Does the smell stop, too?”

“It’s… it’s in my mouth.”

The headset hissed. The fluorescents over my cubicle hummed like a far-away hornet. Somewhere, two rooms over, the hold music started (“You Are My Sunshine,” but wrong, like it tripped every three notes). The hold music can bleed into other calls if a supervisor picks up while they’re on with someone else. It drives me nuts, but you learn to work around it.

“Okay,” I said. “Stay in the hall. Do not look under the sink. I’m moving you to—”

I reached to transfer.

All the lights went out.

Not a power cut. The monitors stayed on. The phones stayed lit. Only the fluorescents failed, one row at a time, trailing away from me to the far end of the room like a short fuse burning down.

“Martin?” she whispered. “The cabinet opened.”

I did exactly what the manual says not to do: I asked a question not on the page. “How do you know?”

There was a pause, and then she whispered, so quiet I felt my throat tense to hear it: “I didn’t touch it, but the drip has two voices now.”

My finger hovered over the transfer key. I hit it.

Nothing. The light on the button flickered and died. The call didn’t drop.

I glanced down at the binder for the escalation path and saw, for the first time, that page 47 wasn’t a full sheet. Someone had torn out half of it. It ended mid-sentence: “…if the drip grows a second voice, do not—”

A second voice. That’s what she’d said.

I stared at the jagged paper edge. My trainer’s pink highlighter bled through the missing page, leaving a neon fringe.

“Are you there?” she asked.

You’re not supposed to repeat that question. If a caller says it twice, you’re supposed to mute your mic and look around the room without moving your head. It’s a tiny survival hack built into the job: if you feel the urge to swivel to the door, don’t. Look in reflections instead. Monitors, windows, the black face of the phone.

I saw myself in the dark monitor: headset waterfalled over my jaw, mouth slightly open, eyes wide. The hallway behind my row of cubicles was a thin neon stroke from the EXIT sign. And—this is the part I keep replaying—my reflection didn’t line up quite right with the way my shoulders felt. Like there was more weight on one side in the glass than there was on my skin.

“Martin?” she said again. Second time.

I muted my mic, like a good little operator, and I looked down.

Under my desk, it was dark, but not black. Something gleamed. A coin? No. Wet pantry liner? No. It looked like the scrape of a tongue along chrome. The metal strut that held my keyboard tray glistened and then, as if embarrassed, pulled back into shadow.

I unmuted my mic without remembering doing it. “Stay in the hall,” I told her. “Do not move. I’m going to—”

The line crackled. For a second, there was a dial tone. And then, unbelievably, there was my voice.

"Residential Safety Line, this is Martin,” my voice said—earlier me, from earlier in the night. The weight of it landed in the bone behind my ear. It wasn’t a recording. It was the exact way my hello had felt on my tongue an hour ago.

“Hello?” said the girl’s voice—no, not the girl’s. Mine. Me, trying out a timid pitch. Me, pretending to be a teenager. Me, uncertain. “Something’s dripping,” my voice breathed, “and it smells like pennies.”

If the manual had a page for that, I never saw it. I doubt they print one. In the binding, someone had tucked a thin loose sheet that I’d never noticed before. It slid out when I grabbed for the torn page. It wasn’t compiled, just photocopied with a black border like a bulletin taped to a break room fridge. At the top, in crowded courier font, someone had typed: **DISPLACED CALLER: YOU.**

I skimmed it while my heart threw itself around.

* If you hear your own intake, hang up.
* If the line repeats your first-night call, it is not a prank.
* Do not crawl. Do not look under the desk. Do not put your hands where you can’t see your knuckles.
* Leave the building *without using the lobby mirror*.
* Once outside, count the windows. If the number is different than in daylight, do not go home. Call the morning manager from the payphone across the street. Wait for a white van that does not idle.

I would love to tell you I followed it word for word. I didn’t. I did something worse. I tried to fix it.

“Who are you?” I asked my own voice, which is a stupid thing to ask yourself in the middle of the night. The mouthpiece of my headset felt damp.

My voice on the line laughed then, exactly the way I’d laughed to the bat caller earlier. Exactly. Timing and breath and the little airy squeak at the end. “I told you,” it said, “I’m in the kitchen.”

The hold music hiccupped. One of the monitors down the row lit with a security camera feed—sometimes the supervisors pull the building cams up when we don’t pick up a call fast enough. The feed was grainy and black-and-white, facing the front doors. In the reflection of the lobby glass, I saw a man sitting at a desk wearing a headset. Me. But the angle was wrong. The camera was after-hours on a moveable mount. It should’ve been facing the door. Instead, it was faced back at the room, and the glass showed a second shape, crouched in the knee-well beneath the man at the desk. One long hand palmed the underbelly of the desk as delicately as if it were holding a soup bowl. The hand didn’t have fingernails; it had little wet triangles, like a cat’s tongue.

Something wet touched my knee.

I didn’t look. I didn’t crawl. I stood up fast enough to knock my chair back and walked, not ran, to the end of my row. The fluorescents farther from me were still glowing a sick aquarium green; up close, under my feet, it was cave-dark. My shoes squeaked on a patch of unseen water. I took the long way around the lobby to avoid the mirror because I am trainable, even at my worst. The exit bar groaned under my palm and then the door yawned me into the early-morning chill.

Outside, the parking lot felt like a blank page. The sky was a shade from black to navy. The world was the size of that building and however far the streetlights reached. Across the street, a payphone hunched under a plastic dome like a monk pulling up his hood.

The manual said to count windows. I counted. One, two, three, four in the top row. One, two, three, four in the bottom. But I know—**I know**—there are five on the top and three on the bottom in daylight. We all joke about the clown window, the fake one on the first floor that goes to a painted brick wall.

Four and four. Neat. Even. Like teeth that have grown into where gums should be.

I didn’t go home.

I called the morning manager from the payphone. The receiver smelled like pennies. The ring went out; the lobby lights shivered; the hold music crawled across the night like a low tide. I rehearsed my script. “This is Martin. I think the desk is compromised. Please send—”

A white van turned the corner with its headlights off and drifted toward the curb.

It didn’t idle.

A woman in a sweatshirt and pajama pants slid the side door and said, without “good morning” or “are you okay,” “Did it say ‘are you there’ twice?”

“Yes,” I said.

“Then it already knows your voice,” she said, and handed me a white paper mask like we wear during dusting. “Keep this on until noon. Don’t answer any number you recognize. Do you have coins?”

I emptied my pockets into her palm. She counted out four. “If the phone rings,” she said, “let it. If you hear anyone ask for you by name—anyone, even me—go into a store and tell them you have a nosebleed. Someone will help you.”

I asked her a dozen questions, none on any page. She answered none of them. She asked me one: “Did you look?”

“No,” I said, mask in my fingers. “I didn’t crawl.”

She nodded. “Then you can come back tomorrow.”

“I’m not—” I began, but the words didn’t quite sit on my tongue. I thought of the girl who had called from the kitchen, how brave she’d sounded trying to breathe evenly. I thought of how my voice had pretended to be hers. I thought of the way the dripping thing had learned to have two voices because one wasn’t enough.

“You’ll come back,” she said, like she was reading my script.

I’m at my apartment now. It’s 10:37 a.m. and the mask is damp and papery and I cannot do the thing I’ve done every morning since I moved in, which is bend down and check the little cabinet beneath the sink for leaks. The manual says: don’t write about work online. “We are preventative.” We are no one. I know.

But the manual doesn’t have a page for what you are supposed to do when your own voice calls you to ask for help.

So here’s mine:

* If you smell pennies and hear a drip, turn off the water and listen to the animals.
* If the animals are quiet, pretend they’re loud.
* If someone knocks at your door and laughs too late, call a locksmith for them.
* If a voice asks if you’re there, count how many times it asks. The second time is a test. The third time is a roll call. The fourth time is not for you.

And if you work nights and keep a headset on and feel something wet touch your knee in the dark, do not crawl.

Stand up. Walk to the door. Count the windows. Wait for a van that does not idle.

When it’s noon and the mask comes off, call your mother and tell her you love her. Do not repeat her name more than once. When you put the phone down, you may hear your own voice ask, Are you there?

Say nothing at all.
