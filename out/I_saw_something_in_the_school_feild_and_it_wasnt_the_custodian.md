Thursday afternoon had arrived, and I was eager to get to my afterschool handball club. The sun was just beginning to set, casting a warm glow across the school campus. The air was thick with the sound of laughter and shouting, and I could feel the excitement building as I made my way to the gym.

As I walked into the gymnasium, I was hit with the smell of sweat and adrenaline. The sound of sneakers screeching across the court and the constant thud of the ball filled the room. I could feel my heart rate picking up, as I took in the scene before me.

My teammates were already on the court, warming up. I could see the competitive glint in their eyes, as they sized each other up. They were all incredibly talented players, each with their own unique style. I was excited to join in and test my own skills against them.

As we began to play, I was immediately lost in the thrill of the game. I could feel my muscles tensing and relaxing with each pass and shot. The ball flew back and forth across the court, the sound of it echoing through the gym. It was like nothing else existed in that moment but the game.

That's when I noticed Alex, one of my teammates, looking out the window behind me. I turned to follow his gaze and saw a small, flickering light in the distance. At first, I thought nothing of it. It was probably just one of the janitors, making their rounds.

But as the light drew closer, I realized that it wasn't a janitor at all. Something about the way it moved was off, too graceful and too smooth for a human. My heart started to race, as I watched the light approach the gymnasium.

The other guys had stopped playing too, their eyes fixed on the light. We were all frozen, unsure of what to do. As the light came closer, we could see that it was being held by something tall and thin. It seemed to be watching us, studying us.

I could feel a chill run down my spine as the creature approached the window. Its eyes were dark and cold, like two pools of black ink. It seemed to be sizing us up, considering its options. I remember feeling like I was in some sort of nightmare, unable to look away from the creature's piercing gaze.

Just as suddenly as it had appeared, the creature was gone. The light had disappeared, and we were left standing in the eerie silence of the gym. It was like nothing had happened at all, and yet everything had changed.

Over the next few days, I couldn't stop thinking about what we had seen. The incident had left me feeling shaken and uneasy. I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched, that something dangerous was lurking just out of sight.

I started to do my own research, reading up on local folklore and urban legends. I discovered a story about a creature that was known to roam the woods around our school. It was tall and thin, with eyes that glowed in the dark. It was said to be incredibly fast and agile, able to move through the trees with ease. And, most chillingly of all, it was said to have a particular interest in children.

As I read more and more about the creature, I felt a sense of dread building in my chest. Could it be that the thing we had seen that night was the same creature from the stories?

I tried to talk to the other guys about it, but they didn't seem to take me seriously. They brushed it off as a prank or a hallucination, unwilling to entertain the idea that something truly terrifying could be lurking in the
