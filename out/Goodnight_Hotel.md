I check in early as I always do when traveling. The walls are old and yellowed. It’s evidently an older hotel than I thought. At first I don’t mind. There’s something satisfying about having an actual key to your room, rather than a keycard. Makes me feel like I’m living in a simpler time.

As I finish checking in, I turn around to head to my room. I see a woman sitting on the weathered bench, sobbing profusely. I ponder whether I should say something to her, but I decide against it.

I make it to my room. It’s dimly lit with ancient light fixtures. All wood furnishings make up the room. Again, it’s old, but I kind of enjoy it. Yellow curtains line the window, the neon glow of the hotel sign gleans in through them. I unpack my things and call it a night.

That morning I awake before the sun rises, ready for my early morning run. I exit my room and head down the poorly lit stairs. As I round the corner, I jump in fright. Hanging from the window is a woman in a bright red dress. Her black hair covers most of her face, but it’s still a ghastly sight. My head swirls with anxiety. I feel like I may pass out.

I dart down the rest of the steps, shielding my eyes as I run past the poor woman’s body. I make it to the front desk, frightened and out of breath. There’s no one at the desk, so I ring the bell. Anxiously, I wait. No one shows up. Ringing the bell over and over now, I’m growing impatient. I call out to see if anyone is working. They must be, yes, it’s early, but this is a hotel. Don’t they usually have something at the front desk at all hours?

I left my phone in the room, so I decide to walk to a police station. I head for the door, only to find it won’t open. No matter how hard I try, it won’t budge. Pondering what to do, I decide to head back to my room and call the police on my phone. It takes a long time, but I work up the courage to walk back up those stairs.

As I reach that dreaded corner, she’s gone. The woman is no longer there. A chill runs down my spine. I sprint back to my room, locking the door behind me. I grab my phone and dial 911, but the call won’t go through.

I open the door. The woman stands in the hallway before me, her black hair still covering her ghastly face. Her dress is now white. She meanders towards me. I scream and shut the door. The door bangs and a horrific growl comes from the other side. I stand and stare at the door in horror.

The noises slowly fade away, but I’m still on edge. I wrap myself in my covers, on full alert. My eyes don’t blink for hours. A knock at the door makes me nearly jump out of my skin.

“Room service.”

Still scared and unsure, I approach the door. Hesitantly, I crack it open. Sure enough, a short older lady stands there with a cart of towels and bedsheets. I run past her into the hallway. She shoots me a judging glance. I sprint my way down the now empty stairs. Approaching the front desk once again, I try to open my mouth to explain what I’d seen, but nothing comes out. The woman at the front desk stares at me.

I turn around and head for the door. Grabbing the handle, it’s locked. I turn around.

“You can’t leave, sir.”

“What?”

She smiles.

I fear I may have to make my way up those stairs once more, and that dreaded woman may very well be waiting for me.

Frantic, I ponder how to escape, but the door won’t budge. I pick up a chair and smash it on the window, crawling out of it, making my way outside. It’s now dark outside, even though only seconds ago it was sunny.

I wander about alongside the silent, grassy riverbank. A horrible noise breaks up the silence. Coming from the other side of the river is a horrible scream. Though I cannot see where the noise originates from because of the tall grass. I’m frozen in fear as the scream only grows louder, and then abruptly stops.

Following this, I hear a thump and then something rolling down the grassy hill, followed by a splash. It’s fallen into the river. Stunned, I stare ahead, not knowing what to do. Then more splashing follows, closer and closer. Something or someone is swimming towards me.

I jet off in the opposite direction. I must have run for three hours straight. When I finally stop, I look up, only to see I’m back at the hotel. Wet footsteps steadily grow louder behind me, so I have no choice but to enter the hotel once more.
