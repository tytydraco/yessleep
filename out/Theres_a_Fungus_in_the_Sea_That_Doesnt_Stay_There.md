I knew it was them the moment I saw the envelope.

On it, my name handwritten in black ink. It was waiting on my desk when I returned from lecture, tucked beneath a folder I hadn’t touched in years.

The others thought it was a grant letter. One of my colleagues joked that I finally sold my soul to Big Pharma. If only he knew. I laughed along.

I didn’t open it right away.

I waited until I got home, locked the door, turned off the lights. I slid a knife under the flap and peeled it open.

Inside was a single sentence, printed on a thick card.

“You are requested for field analysis at Site AV.”

Nothing else, except for a faded red stamp – a white trident piercing upward from beneath the waves.

The Order.

My hands went cold. I sat on the kitchen floor for nearly an hour, card in one hand, breath caught somewhere between my ribs. “I promised I wouldn’t” I whispered. I thought I’d left it all behind. They said *one final mission, and you’re out.*

But I guess the tricked me. Like they do with everyone.

They don’t threaten you, but they gently remind you that you still owe them. That they know what you did in Madagascar. That someone – somewhere – still has the unredacted footage. That your sister’s college tuition wasn’t a miracle after all.

The next morning, a courier delivered a package with nothing but a burner phone inside. It buzzed the moment I took it from him.

A voice spoke through the static. “You will be escorted to Site AV within forty-eight hours. Your credentials have been reinstated. Bring no outside electronics. You will be briefed en route. This anomaly has been designated RED-ALGAE.”

I didn’t say a word – there was nothing I could really say.

Before the call ended, the voice added something else.

“Oh, and Iris? Official records list the town as uninhabited. Disregard local activity and don’t engage unless authorized.”

I held the phone until the call cut. Afterwards, I started at the wall for a long time.

Then I packed.

Not much, just what I really needed; gloves, notebooks, a flashlight. I left my laptop, my real phone. Left the necklace my sister gave me. No personal items – nothing that might “compromise emotional clarity,” as the Order put it.

Exactly forty-eight hours later, I was in the back of a van with no windows.

The air smelled faintly of ammonia and cold metal. The walls were lined with that typical dull, institutional gray the Order loved to follow.

Two others sat with me: a man and woman, both armored. Guards, clearly, with Order-issued weapons, and black masks clipped to their belts. One of them glanced at me a few times before speaking up.

“You’re Iris, right?” he asked.

I didn’t answer at first. Then nodded. “Was,” I replied.

He nodded back, quiet for a moment. “I didn’t think they’d pull you back in. Not after the incident in Madagascar.”

I looked away, slightly ashamed.

He must’ve realized how it sounded, because he added: “Still alive. That’s what matters.”

The woman next to him unzipped a flat pouch and handed me a sealed envelope. Inside was a thick briefing file and a single-page mission card.

The first line read:

>“SITE AV: Active Environmental Anomaly. Protocol: BRINEBURST.”

I flipped through the pages as the van rattled along the gravel road. The report was stitched together from field notes, satellite analysis, and biohazard logs.

I won’t bore you with all the details, here’s the important part: there was an outbreak of an anomalous marine fungus resembling RED-ALGAE in a coastal town. Symptoms include tissue degradation, behavioral regression, vocal disruption, and systemic mutation. The town was designated “Uninhabited”, and a quarantine perimeter was enforced. Satellite images were falsified; civilians were listed as relocated.

I turned the page and felt my stomach drop.

**83** **confirmed** **casualties**. **12 unrecovered.**

The subjects remained in a degenerative state, with their vocal cords either ruptured or restructured. Their behavior was listed as “erratic, but not overly hostile”.

The objective was simple: to collect fungal samples, assess the mutation, and determine what was the main cause of the outbreak.

At the bottom of the briefing, a single line was handwritten in red ink.

“We only ask because we can’t afford to lose any more of our own.”

I closed the file and sat in silence for the rest of the ride.

We reached the outskirts of the town just before dawn.

The van slowed to a crawl, and I saw a checkpoint ahead – or what remained of it. Chain-link fencing, bent inwards like something had pressed against it. A sandbagged guard post, half-collapsed. The town itself was a mess – roofs collapsed, the Order’s insignia burned off the side of a metal panel, windows shattered with dried blood coloring them red.

It was a surreal sight. This is what true abandonment looks like.

The van stopped and the guards moved first. I stepped out after, my boots sinking into the mud below. The air hit me hard, filled with salt, rot, and something sweeter – *the algae,* I thought to myself.

Ahead, the road led into the town – narrow streets lined with leaning lamp posts.

I spotted the algae within seconds – though it wasn’t hard. It was growing up the sides of buildings, bleeding from the edges of alleyways, and scattered all over the ground. In some places it pulsed faintly, like a slow heartbeat.

My escort spoke through his mask. “Stay on the marked paths, we’ll enter the city center first.”

I nodded, my eyes scanning everything. It was a sad sight to see schools, parks and swingsets uninhabited.

“Do people still live here?” I asked.

The guard hesitated, tilting his head slightly. “Officially? No.”

“And unofficially?”

He didn’t answer.

We moved deeper into the town, boots splashing through puddles laced with a red hue. We passed a general store with broken glass in the doorway. Inside, I saw algae wrapped around the shelves like it had grown from within.

Then the first signs of movement.

Something shifted two blocks down. A figure – resembling a human with a bent spine – shuffled across the fog. It didn’t look at us. Just shuffled into the mist

One of the guards raised his weapon.

“Don’t,” I said sharply.

He lowered it. “I wasn’t going to. Not unless it gets closer.”

We continued in silence, the fog thickening as we moved between crumbling buildings. A house marked *Primary Infection Site* came into view, the door barely hanging on.

“We’ll keep watch,” the woman said. “Ten minutes.”

I entered fast, and the smell instantly hit me, making me gag. Red algae covered the walls and floor, thick like meat. Although I took all the necessary precautions, this amount of exposure does pose a substantial threat.

I crouched, scraped a sample into a vial. It twitched.

From the other room, I heard a door creak. I froze, looking into the direction of the noise, which suddenly transformed into a gurgling sound.

I held still. Something was on the other side – shuffling and dragging itself across the floor. The gurgling shifted into a wet, rasping breath, followed by something that might’ve been a short word, but I couldn’t make it out.

I slowly moved down the hallway, careful not to make any sudden movement or sound.

The rasping stopped.

But something else appeared – just beyond the frame of the doorway at the end of the hall. I saw a shadow twitching, approaching me from the dark.

I held my breath.

Then it appeared.

Its head was covered in algae, the skin stretching over something luminous underneath, as if it had swallowed a light source. It didn’t have any hair, its features distorted. One of its arms dragged behind it, fused at the elbow with a slick growth that twitched like it was alive.

*Crack* – a broken tile beneath me squirmed.

“Fuck.”

The thing jerked toward me with a speed that didn’t match its broken frame.

I stumbled back, now faster because it was too late to be cautious. I screamed – don’t remember what – for the guards to come inside.

They burst through the doorway as the infected thing lunged, its throat gurgling with anticipation.

I closed my eyes and heard gunfire, which only staggered the beast.

I scrambled to the side as one of the guards pulled me back by my collar, dragging me outside as the second one emptied another clip. He didn’t wait to check if it was down – instead, he turned and ordered us to retreat.

Behind him, other figures were already emerging – two, maybe three, I wasn’t sure. All of them were covered in the same pulsing red growth, like the algae had hollowed them out and was wearing them like skin.

“Don’t get distracted!” the woman shouted. “Back to the vehicle, now!”

By the time we made it back to the van and sealed the doors, I was gasping for air, mask slick with sweat. One of the guards checked my suit for any breaches while the other cursed under her breath.

“They weren’t supposed to be this close to the perimeter,” the woman muttered.

“We’ll report it to base. No point in arguing about it now,” the man replied.

I reached for my sample kit and looked at the sealed vial – the one I had taken from the wall inside.

It was glowing – faintly, but I was sure of it.

The driver sped off, tires slicing through the algae-covered mud. He swerved the car a few times, I assume avoiding the creatures which gathered there due to the commotion.

“They’re pursuing,” the driver said over comms. “I see movement on the rooftops.”

Rooftops?

The guards opened the rear doors to look. There were at least five or six of them coming after us – though it was hard to see in the fog. One of them had climbed onto a collapsed home and watched us from afar.

They weren’t fast at all, but extremely relentless. They didn’t stop – like the algae had pushed them to their maximum, pulsing behind them with every step.

A few of them slammed into the van, tilting the vehicle for a moment, tires slipping in the mud – luckily, the driver held control.

Through the fog I saw pale yellow floodlights – the checkpoint.

The gate opened just in time just in time for us to slip through it, stopping inside the quarantine garage. A hydraulic door slammed shut behind us.

I finally let out a breath of relief – something I couldn’t for the last few minutes.

“Everyone out. Contamination protocol.”

The garage flooded with sterilizing mist as we stepped out, coughing slightly under the chemical spray.

Inside it was colder than I remembered.

We passed through triage. A technician peeled off the outer layers of my gear, and stuck me with a needle before I could object.

“Blood sample,” she muttered. “What did you bring back?”

“Enough,” I said, and lifted the sample case. “More than enough.”

“Good job. We’ll process it from here.”

That was it. No more questions, no debriefing, nothing.

Eventually, they told me I was clear. There was no breach or visible symptoms, so I could go.

The van that dropped me off wasn’t the same one that picked me up. This one had windows, at least. My clothes were returned in a vacuum-sealed bag.

“Where do I go now?” I asked the driver before I stepped outside.

He shrugged. “Wherever you please. But don’t forget: you were never here.”

Two weeks later, I was back in the lecture hall, explaining fungal adaptations in extreme climates when my voice faltered. It was too similar.

The slide behind me showed a microscopic image of a lichen colony.

I thought it pulsed, even though it couldn’t – it was a still image, after all.

The students didn’t notice; they were half asleep, phones in hand or zoning out entirely. I moved on.

After class, I walked back to my office, heart beating a bit too fast. I told myself it was stress, nothing more.

But something was on my desk.

Another envelope. Same handwriting in the same black ink.

I didn’t open it right away this time either – but again, I knew what it meant.

The same overwhelming feeling of despair came over me.

The Order wasn’t done with me. And probably won’t [be.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThalassianOrder/)
