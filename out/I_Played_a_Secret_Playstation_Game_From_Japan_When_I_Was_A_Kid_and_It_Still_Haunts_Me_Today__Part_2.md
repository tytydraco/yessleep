I made it out that night, but the thirst for and the haunting of my brain by the game didn’t go away. It never went away. I felt more and more like I was trapped in that awful endless game throughout my life. 

Life did not go well. Especially after I figured out the only way to soothe the endless mind terror of the game was to drown it in as much alcohol and drugs as I could until I blacked out, and passed out. 

This behavior wiped out all my teenage years. The only thing that stopped it was getting myself thrown in prison in my 20s and getting years to dry out. 

Then I got spit put in my 30s. Nowhere to go. Totally unprepared for life. 

I went back to my hometown. That was about the only option I had. 

I walked around the town endlessly, and aimlessly. Being on the move tended to push away the monsters in my head, and, yes, they were still stalking me all these years later - I had never broken the chain of mental terror of the game. 

I was shocked to see the video game stores still open at the edge of town. 

There was no choice but to go in. I was further shocked to find the layout almost exactly the same, sans Morton. 

Instead, a tall man about my age was behind the counter, long greasy hair, playing a game on a PC. He didn’t acknowledge me in the slightest. 

I walked the racks of games, always one eye on the man behind the counter. I knew him. It was definitely Nat, just aged like me - some white hair in a sad attempt at a beard, some wrinkles on his forehead. 

Nat was giving off the energy and posture of someone who was doing everything he could to avoid being talked to. I wasn’t going to let it slide this time. 

I called him by his name. He seemed shocked. He still barely acknowledged me. The only information he would give me was that Morton died years earlier and handed the shop down to him. 

It felt like he was going to slip away from helping me again until I mentioned a name which caught his ear:

*Calyn*

Nat finally stopped playing the game and made eye contact. *What did I know about Calyn?* 

Not much. She was just my out of my league, childhood crush from growing up, and I knew he was with her. 

Nat went back to ignoring me. Until I brought up the game, From Japan. 

This caught his attention again. After correcting that the game wasn’t from Japan, he asked me a question:

“What was your experience with the game?”

“I ruined my life,” I answered. 

Nat finally let down his wall of frigid cold cool. He looked at me with moisture in his eyes. 

“Mine too,” Nat muttered. 

It felt terrible to see Nat so broken. He was like this magical cool, ahead of his time, gamer bad ass when we were growing up and now he looked like an underfed and beaten dog.

I could sense a particular sadness ever since I mentioned Calyn. 

“Where is Calyn?” I asked. 

“At home,” Nat dropped a big revelation like it was nothing. 

“Morton said you could beat the game though. Didn’t that solve the problem?” I asked. 

Nat didn’t answer, but I felt no hope radiate out of him. 

“So how are you getting through all this then?” I asked. 

“It’s just a struggle every day,” Nat explained. 

“Do you want it to be that way forever?” I asked. 

Nat looked up at me, finally with some life in his eyes. 

\-

Nat had buried his copy of the game underneath an abandoned cabin out in the woods behind his parents’ house. He took me out there and told the true story of the game as we ventured to it. 

Yes, Nat had beaten the game. One time, and it almost killed him. He explained the game seemed to connect more and more with you the longer you played it and you could feel it poisoning your blood and mind as you played. 

*Beating it almost killed him.* 

He didn’t beat it for himself though. He beat it for Calyn. She had found the game at his house and played it, driving herself mad, to the point it almost killed her. He had her hold the controller with him and helped her, while not looking at the screen as much as he could so she would be the one processing beating the game. 

But he beat the game and saved her the best he could. She was tired and damaged afterwards, but she said the game didn’t permeate her mind and life the way it did Nat’s after that. 

It helped them stay together. They went from first loves to life partners and had stayed strong together over the years. 

Nat kept trying to beat the game on his own and he never could, and each time he tried, he lost a little more of himself, and let a little more of the game into his psyche. 

He eventually gave up. He found that he could manage it with copious amounts of marijuana and keeping his life simple. He also found happiness in Calyn being able to live her life, though she had always seemed tired from experiencing the game all those years before, like it was a parasite that would never truly let her go. 

We found the game. The sight of that blank disc took my breath away. 

We thought that we would have a better chance if we tried it together. We fired up the game and our nerves filled the room in his little apartment. 

Going back into the game for the first time in decades was harrowing. I couldn’t do anything else. Couldn’t move outside of controlling the game. I started to sweat. 

The game was even harder than I remembered. It was so dark you could barely see. The monsters seemed to be hiding around every corner and they’d launch at you the second they saw you and take you out. 

Nat and I took turns and neither of us could survive for more than a few minutes. We just kept dying and dying and it seemed to take the energy, life, and wind out of us each time. 

The two of us sat down after a few deaths.

The two of us both knew we were starting to swiftly wither away. We were older and more weathered - the game was taking more of a toll on our bodies and minds. 

I was starting to get light headed after losing my life in the game for what must have been 50 times. It was getting late into the night and I could hardly stay awake, yet I kept playing on. 

I have no idea when I fell asleep or passed out. All I knew was that I woke up at some point in the middle of the night and could see Nat still playing, the remote in his hand, but him on the ground, on one knee, his face glued to the T.V. 

Nat looked terrible - his face was bright red, his body was leaned forward like he had a terrible pain in his stomach and he was gasping for air. He looked like he was being strangled. 

I looked closer at the screen and saw one of the faceless monsters on the screen. I could see its arms reaching out in the P.O.V. The monster was choking out Nat. 

I rushed to Nat and reached for the controller. I felt something push me backward, full on knocking me over. 

I felt a cold, strong grasp around my neck as I laid on the ground. I tried to fight back and push the energy off me, but couldn’t. It was far too strong. 

The oxygen started to no longer get to my brain. My vision started to get foggy. I felt like my entire body got heavy, like I could no longer move it. 

*Then, darkness.*

\-

I woke up on the floor - breathless, pained, and confused. I saw a familiar face towering above me, but horribly aged. 

I didn’t recognize him at first and then it came into focus. *It was Morton*. He was old and looked like shit but there was no denying it was him. There was no way I could mistake that disapproving scowl. 

The urge to say something to Morton came over me. He held a finger to his lips. *Silence*. I obeyed. 

Morton’s eyes went back to the screen and I looked him over again - he had the Playstation remote in his hand, he had concentration on his face, his legs wobbled, weak, as if he was struggling to keep his balance. He certainly looked like he was in a fight. 

And he was struggling and fighting. I looked at the screen and Morton was taking on an entire room full of the monsters. 

I had never made it as far in the game as Morton appeared to have made it. He was outside. I had never been there. He also appeared to be doing a good job at it.

I felt myself feel like I was wrapped in a bear hug. I looked up at the screen and saw the monsters overtaking Morton. 

I started to feel my body crunch. It felt like I was getting rolled up into a thousand-pound rug. 

I could feel my body telling me I didn’t have much time left. I looked next to me and saw Nat on the floor as well, not looking good at all. 

The black was returning to my senses. I couldn’t hold out under this squeezing for much longer. 

I started to scream. Nat screamed. Morton grumbled and flexed, playing the game as hard as he could. 

I felt something else coming over me, over the pain and the torture and the wasted life. I felt someone fighting for me. I felt Morton fighting for me. 

The T.V. screen started to shake. I saw on the screen it looked like Morton was going to work on one, final monster - a large one, and it was backpedaling. 

I felt the squeezing feeling on me start to let go. I could breathe again. I felt like I could get up. 

I watched the monster explode on the screen above me. I then watched the glass of the T.V. explode - showering the three of us with sparks and dark glass. 

There was a moment of silence with an absence of movement. Then the world started to come back to me. I was alive, and in felt significantly better. 

Then Morton collapsed onto the floor between Nat and I. 

\-

Morton had terminal cancer. He hadn’t actually died yet. He confided in Nat when he got sick and disappeared and told Nat to tell everyone that he simply died, but the truth was he just gave up the store, moved away, and tried to do treatment in peace.

Nat reached out to him when we were failing at the game. Morton was the next best video gamer that he knew and wanted to see if he could help. 

Nat and I had failed and passed out by the time Morton arrived. 

Morton knew it would kill him much sooner if he tried and beat the game, but he gave it a go anyway. 

And he saved both our lives. We owed him everything. 

Nat and I went to Morton’s hospital room. 

He wouldn’t talk to us, or let us look at him. He would only communicate by a whiteboard which he would write answers to our verbal questions on and hand it around a curtain next to his bed. 

Morton explained he could go at any minute and that he needed some help from us. He also very much in his fashion revealed something I never thought about. 

Morton showed us the whiteboard - it read: This wasn’t the first time I did this for you, either :) 

It clicked with me as soon as I saw his writing on the white board. I could see that dark figure standing over me that night at Corey’s house when someone saved me from the monsters in the game. Morton must have been keeping an eye on me or Corey’s house and came to save me, but kept himself hidden. 

Morton quickly changed the conversation on his white board and handed us a list - an Excel sheet printed out, with a note - explaining these were the copies of the dreaded game which were still out there. 

He finished by saying he had enough energy for one last question. 

Would we go out and try to track down the copies of the game and destroy them?
