My name is Kai Martin, but I went by a catchier moniker on YouTube. It was about privacy as well as branding. You might’ve seen my channel back in the day, but I’m not going to provide a link.

Anyway, by December of 2021, it was profitable enough for me to quit the day job. That month's YouTube ad revenue was equal to a year's worth of earnings from *The Daily Shitstain* — not its real name, believe it or not. My local newspaper was an endangered medium. Eyeballed by greasy bundles of cod and chips more than humans. Let’s put it that way.

Moreover, freelance journalism comes without restrictions. I reported on whatever so pleased me. In the name of a scintillating story, I’d faced war criminals, traffickers, and next-door killers. As a young, steel-balled, investigative journalist, I felt invincible. And that sort of adrenaline blinds a person to danger. It’s why I wasn’t frightened of Cedric Roberts.

I should have been.

Cedric was an ordinary man. An outwardly dull fellow, whose profession I don’t remember. He was interesting in only one way. The man claimed to have been misdiagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder. He claimed to perform rituals which really did stop bad things from happening.

Now, that’s a typical claim from sufferers of this illness. The atypical thing was that he claimed to serve something outside of him.

He called it *tall crawl*.

1. **Do whatever he bids, and do it twice if you doubt yourself.**
2. **Walk no fewer than eleven steps per hour.**
3. **Don’t walk in the shade of a backwards tree.**
4. **No artificial light between one and six in the morning.**
5. **Snap the bird when it sings.**

Those were the five rules of life by which Cedric Roberts lived. Not rules imposed by an oddball employer. Not rules pencilled on a scrap of paper. Rules whispered to Cedric in his head. Rules that I scribbled on my hand whilst doing research on his case.

Everything started three months ago.

In late June, my brother dumped a dollop of waste onto my lap. Dressed it up as a vanilla sundae, and I swallowed it with ease. Why did I entertain him? Well, I always entertain him. I always support his crackpot ideas. Besides, it shouldn’t have been possible for my brother to keep shovelling through that rock-bottom floor. But Andreas always found a way.

I sighed, scrolling through my YouTube channel’s analytics. “Views are down this month. We really need to come up with an exciting video for next week.”

“Well, did you hear about Cedric Roberts?” my brother asked.

I nodded. “Sure. The monster who killed his family.”

Andreas nodded. “He braked at the town’s train crossing, stepped out of the vehicle, and locked the passenger doors. Then he placed a brick on the accelerator and let the car roll through the barrier into the oncoming train. Witnesses said his wife and two daughters were banging on the windows and screaming, but it was all over in seconds. The train pancaked the car, and—”

“Okay, Andreas,” I interrupted, feeling nauseated.

“Anyway, he ended up in a psychiatric unit,” my brother said.

“It’s a horrible story, but I have nothing to add that wasn’t already covered by the paper,” I said.

My brother smiled. “You do now. I was talking to our source at the station, and she—”

“Just call her Holly,” I said, rolling my eyes.

“Right. Well, Holly revealed something interesting,” Andreas continued. “And not just that you’re absolutely smitten with her. I heard about your date to—”

“Get to the point,” I said, blushing.

My brother smiled, then returned to a solemn expression. “Cedric Roberts said that something else killed his family. Said that a higher being was punishing him for getting a compulsion wrong, Kai. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and OCD.”

And that was it. I *had* to interview this man. Without even arranging an appointment, I slumped into my car and set off.

It was about more than our connection to case. Andreas and I had lost our mother to suicide seven years earlier. She had been broken by her obsessive-compulsive disorder. It wasn’t even about Cedric’s murderous rampage. It was about the itch on my nape. One which burrowed deeply, like the tarmac snaking through grooves in fields and mounds. A long, country road that ascended towards a secluded psychiatric hospital.

The ward was a grey blot atop a hilly landscape. One with three storeys of tall, glass panes lined up far too squarely. The building pained my eyes for a reason I did not know, yet trusted with unwavering certainty. It was a clearer warning than any I’d ever seen, heard, or felt. My mind was telling me to turn back.

Something watched me from one of the windows. Something I didn’t see. Something that didn’t belong.

“I’ve been his psychiatrist for less than five days,” Dr David Pendleton said after I entered the building and introduced myself. “Dr Rosetta Wright would’ve been more helpful, Mr Martin. She was Cedric’s specialist for eleven months.”

“Right. I’d like to speak to her then. May I have her details?” I asked.

“No,” Pendleton replied.

I nodded. “Because she’d rather not speak to a journalist?”

“Because she’s dead,” he bluntly answered.

I felt it again. The primitive urge to turn back. The same instinct that had detected something worse than eyes watching me from the hospital windows.

And I also inferred, from the tone of David’s voice, that Dr Rosetta Wright’s death was linked to Cedric Roberts in some way. I feared that it might be linked in the worst way.

“Did he kill her?” I near-silently asked.

Dr Pendleton shook his head, then winced as if coming to his senses. “I’m not myself at the moment. I really shouldn’t be talking to a journalist about any of this. Rosetta was a dear friend of mine, Mr Martin. You’re taking advantage of my grief by poking your nose into this.”

“I’m not trying to take advantage of you,” I promised. “This story means a lot to me.”

“I imagine it’ll help your career,” the doctor cynically said.

“It’s not that. My mother was an OCD sufferer,” I replied, teeing up for the winning stroke. “Her illness led her down an awful path, Dr Pendleton. She eventually took her own life.”

There came a long pause as the doctor cautiously chose his next words.

He finally said, “If you really have no exploitative intentions…”

“I don’t,” I promised.

“Fine,” Dr Pendleton said. “I’ll have to ask for Cedric’s permission, of course.”

The patient, surprisingly, was keen on the idea of talking to a journalist. Given his volatile nature, however, Dr Pendleton thought it best to have members of staff physically restrain the man before I entered his room.

“I’ll let you conduct your interview privately,” the doctor said as we stood outside Cedric’s room. “He’s been docile today. That’s the only reason I’m allowing this interview. But shout if you need me. I’ll be right outside, Mr Martin. Less than five yards away.”

*Sure. Separated from the family-killer by a wooden door and a plastered wall*, I thought, envisioning all of the ways in which the patient might butcher me before help would arrive.

But I inhaled deeply, summoned every shred of my courage, and entered the white-walled cell labelled 307.

Cedric Roberts was constricted by a taut leather belt around his midsection, but nothing could have restrained his untoward grin. The man sat cross-legged on a neatly-made duvet. He was a strange sight. A forty-something-year-old sitting like a monk or a well-behaved schoolchild, but neither was the case.

I knew what this supposed family man had done. A heinous act driven by a mind either evil or unwell. I still wasn’t sure which, and that was what I wanted to investigate. I wanted to disprove his claims of supernaturalism and grandeur. I *needed* to disprove it. Since I’d first glimpsed the hospital on the horizon, a prison which barely held this imposing man, I’d felt something I didn’t know how to explain. A terror I desperately wanted to explain.

Cedric would give me answers, but not the ones I wanted.

“Kai Martin? The Kai Martin?” he mocked. “May I have an autograph?”

I sat on a chair opposite the bed. “Nice to meet you, Cedric. Do you know why I’m here?”

“This is a ‘collab’ for your YouTube video,” the man replied, snorting with an entirely static face.

I smiled uneasily. “Honestly, I just want to uncover the truth.”

“*Honestly*?” Cedric repeated disbelievingly. “Yes, we must always have honesty, mustn’t we, Kai-Kai?”

Something stirred violently in my belly as Cedric uttered a nickname I’d only ever been called by my mother. That fact, alongside the oppressive sensation of 307’s watchful walls shrinking, filled me with a foreign strain of fear.

“I know what happened on that afternoon, Cedric,” I said. “Who made you kill your family?”

He smiled. “My beautiful Isabelle called him tall crawl. He crawled up my body, you see. When you do what he says, he crawls. Grows. Feeds. Until he is tall.”

“Tall crawl,” I softly said, sparking a sharp chill on my left forearm.

It was only a child’s bemusing name. As bemusing as my feeling of being watched by unseen things, not quite eyes. But some perplexing anomalies are borderline inexplicable. Some oddities are funny, like four buses arriving at once. Some oddities are terrible, like the foetal shape of a body that rose beneath Cedric’s duvet. A shape that the patient roughly flattened with a thump of his hand, before massaging the bed slowly. Uncomfortably.

My heart throbbed sharply at the sight I knew I hadn’t imagined.

And then the man transformed his two longest fingers into striding legs, before marching them slowly up his right arm. And as he did, there came the sound of slow, clacking footsteps in the hospital hall. Footsteps sounding in horrible harmony with each stride Cedric’s leg-fingers took across his flesh.

I was so distracted by the approaching footsteps that, in my state of terror, I barely noticed the pain. Only when the footsteps of some unseen figure halted at the door to 307, but were not accompanied by knocking knuckles, did a meek groan finally escape my lips.

Bloody, crescent-shaped dents had been trodden into my left arm, as if I were Cedric’s reflection. The wounds were in the exact spots the man’s walking fingers had marked on his own skin. Impossible half-moon wounds inflicted by unseen puppet strings.

*“What have you done?”* I wailed.

But my lips only formed the shapes of the words. No sound escaped. My autonomy had been stripped by Cedric. And worst of all, he somehow heard or felt what I had silently screamed.

“I’m following his creed, Kai. *Walk no fewer than eleven steps per hour*,” the man said, reciting his second rule.

I looked down at the eleven deep cuts on my arm, forged by unclean fingernails. Then I looked at the five rules I’d sloppily jotted on my palm the night before.

“Tall crawl starts at your toes, you see,” Cedric finally explained. “He climbs up, up, and up.”

*Up to your breast.*

*Up to your frown.*

*Up to the tippy-top-top of your crown,* whispered his voice in my head.

“Knock, knock.”

As the man rapped his knuckles against an imaginary door, my brain matter squelched painfully. There came a dull ache from spectral fingers, too long to belong to Cedric, rummaging in my skull.

I fearfully surveyed my paralysed self in the anti-ligature mirror on the wall behind the perturbing patient.

“He crawls along the wall,” Mr Roberts continued, rocking on the bed as I failed to scream for Dr Pendleton. “He crawls so tall…”

“Please,” I silently begged.

“My Isabelle didn’t mind,” the man continued. “Tall crawl stops the bad things, Kai. You just have to do as he says.”

“Bad things happened to your wife and daughters,” I soundlessly uttered.

Only air escaped my mouth as I contended with the horror of being unable to speak.

“Because I broke the third rule,” Cedric whispered, displaying the first sign of anything vaguely resembling fright. “I stumbled into the shade of a backwards tree.”

“What is a backwards tree?” I inwardly asked, lips moving silently in the mirror on the wall.

“It isn’t something that words fit around,” the man responded nonsensically, before offering a large smile. “But it’s real, Kai.”

I nodded, wrestling with the force that bound me tighter than any belt, then mouthed, “What does he look like? This personification of your illness?”

“I don’t have obsessive-compulsive disorder, Kai,” the patient calmly insisted.

*Humour me, Cedric*, I thought.

“He looks like so many things,” the man replied, proving that he had reached into my mind. “A coat hanging strangely on a hook. Something that hides beneath fresh folds on your palms. Maybe your own reflection lingering in the mirror after you’ve walked away.”

As if in dreadful response, something changed in my reflection. Two colourless, spindly hands sprouted from behind my head like weeds, belonging to a figure hidden behind me. One I am glad I didn’t see, though I doubt it *had* a form to be seen.

Ten fingers slithered across my face, beelining towards my open, screeching mouth. I jolted in fear and looked down to find that reality was no better than the mirror’s illusion. Crawling across my chin were not fingers, but black, oval pellets. Titanic, writhing microbes. Living or unliving things that fell into my wide, soundless maw.

When I looked back up at the mirror, jaw hanging limply, my reflection had changed again. My mirrored face did not look back at me with a smile. It did not look back at all, for there was no face left.

A sunken pit sat in the middle of my featureless reflection, caving inwards from all sides and forming an impossibly black hole at the centre of my face. One which passed beyond the back of my skull. And it did not reveal the wall on the other side. It did not reveal anything that the human gaze knew how to decipher.

But there *was* something in the blackness. I felt it.

“You look pale,” Cedric whispered, drawing my gaze to him.

“What is happening to me?” I silently croaked, looking back at my reflection to find it had returned to normal.

“He said he’d save my baby girl,” the patient said, ignoring me again. “My baby Isabelle. And he did. She was stillborn, but she came back to life because I did as tall crawl asked. And Izzie enjoyed ten perfect years, which is better than none. I thank him every day.”

I said nothing. Whether due to paralysis or choice, I do not know.

“I like that you’ve written them down,” the patient eventually said, nodding at the set of rules inked on my quaking hand. “But you’ll run out of skin eventually.”

“What do you mean?” I mouthed, choking on fear or perhaps slug-like entities wedged in my throat. “Are there more rules?”

Cedric Roberts held a finger up to his lips and loudly shushed, but I gasped in bewilderment. His arms were still tightly bound in the restraining belt. How had one of his arms freed itself for a moment?

Nothing in that place made sense, but the eleven curved cuts on my forearm told me that, at the very least, it had been no figment of my imagination.

“He’ll tell you what to do, Kai,” Cedric said. “He always tells. Dr Wright didn’t see that.”

“What happened to her?” I soundlessly asked.

“The fifth rule, Kai,” the man continued, avoiding all questions. “*Snap the bird when it sings*. I had to do that one little thing or Isabelle wouldn’t have made it. I was scared, Kai. But the tall crawl blessed me with a bird to break. It fluttered on little legs through the door, smiling unknowingly and humming a pleasant tune.”

“Fluttered on little legs? *Smiling*?” I silently choked in horror, haunted by his choice of words.

The man, if he were even a man anymore, simply grinned at me.

“*Tall crawl is not real, Cedric,”* I mouthed, trying to convince myself rather than him.

“I snapped the birdie,” Cedric exhaled, as if the words were cathartic. “Snapped it shut. And the tall crawl gave me Isabelle. He saved her. But there were always more bad things to stop. Always more rules to follow. Six, seven, eight, nine—”

I silently pleaded for him to stop.

“There are too many rules to count, Kai,” the bound man giddily explained, rocking aggressively on the bed like a hard-shelled egg ready to hatch. “But it’s only fair to do as he says. Only right, given what he does to keep me safe. Do you want to be safe, Kai? So no-one ever gets hurt like your mother again? Andreas and Holly. They should be kept safe. You should keep them safe.”

“Please, let me leave,” I begged in my head. “I shouldn’t have come here.”

“No,” the man taunted lowly, eyes twitching like things other than pupils. “This is the place. You were always supposed to come here. To welcome the tall crawl into your heart.”

An unseen pall hung over the boxy room. It clung to Cedric like a heavy fabric. The tall crawl. That was what I saw. It was not a man. It was not any one thing at all.

*He looks like so many things, Kai.*

The man’s words bounced off the walls of my skull as I shivered at shapes in my peripheral vision.

I could already feel my feet tingling. Could already feel something starting to drag its prickly, transparent form across the top of my toes. A small crawl that would grow. It was too late. Whether I’d wanted to welcome the tall crawl or not, he was there.

“Follow the rules, Kai,” Cedric whispered, giggling. “There are more than five. There are always more.”

I shot to my feet, falling for the illusion that the demon had given me back my freedom for a second. Temporarily afforded me the illusion of independent will. It was a cruel joke that seemed to please Cedric Roberts. Made him guffaw wildly as I tentatively pressed towards the exit.

“Bye bye, Kai,” the patient said.

And then the man began to walk his fingers across his flesh once more. As he did, the duvet started to lift. That shape returned, with a barely-human form, and crawled towards the edge of the bed. Crawled towards an escape. Crawled towards *me*.

Screaming with a voice box that finally worked, I scurried out of the door and down the corridor.

“Mr Martin?” Dr Pendleton asked, gasping as he rose to his feet.

I didn’t tell him what I saw. Didn’t tell him what I felt. But the doctor followed me, cornering me into a conversation, and noticed the wounds on my left forearm. Chastised me for trying to conceal them. Chastised me for not seeking help. I’d hoped that the eleven cuts were figments of my imagination. But as I drove out of the car park, looking up at the windows of the hospital, it became clear that I hadn’t imagined anything.

Behind the window of 307, there stood Cedric Roberts, waving at me. And hidden behind him, a silhouetted figure waved its far longer arm in unison with the patient, like some perverse puppet-master. An arm without colour. Without texture. Without substance.

When I looked down to see only one hand holding onto the steering wheel, I realised that my free one was waving back at Cedric Roberts.

In an upcoming post, I will tell you what happened next. I will tell you about the things that followed. The things I had to do. But not today. This was already a lot for me. Besides, a tweeting bird just landed on my windowsill. It told me what will happen to Holly if I don’t snap it.
