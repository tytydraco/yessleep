Content warning: Body horror


It’s funny how the things you resent can become the things you long for once you lose them.
I had always hated this village, the quiet sense of isolation and insignificance that festered within it, the insufferable torment of my schooling, I resented my odd face with its unfortunate features, my eczema marred skin. 
I hated being lonely. 
Oh how I wish I'd stayed lonely. 


I first met Rose almost a year ago one freezing cold morning. I had set out early onto the moors, my wellies cracking satisfyingly against the damp grass. Even through the murkiness of the early morning fog I could see the thick swathes of grey clouds smothering the sky. I remember trudging along the damp field, mulling over in my groggy mind whether I could bring myself to take the trek up to school for another enriching day of getting my tie and blazer nicked and smoking behind the bike shed, something of a more recent development as my original smoking spot had become untenable. But more days than not I was perfectly happy to sit in the woodlands consumed with my hobby, a decision I was never challenged on after my parents kicked me out. Though, I wonder now if I’d made more of an effort to attend school that day things might have been different. Whittling had been my escape for as long as I could remember, my distraction from the sense of anxiety and self-loathing that crept under my skin and into my bones like a degenerative sickness, and I spent long engrossed hours sat on the moorlands practising my craft, my cracked and blistered fingers working tirelessly. It was during this fixation that a voice cut through the still silence of the forest like a knife and I subsequently caught my finger with my own.


“That’s a perfect likeness.” 


My head snapped up to be met with the sight of a young woman, sitting cradled in a low branch of one of the nearby trees. The first thought that registered was that she was breathtakingly beautiful, but with hindsight I identify the thing that hit me first about her was the instinctual sense of uncanniness to her person, that deep feeling of wrongness wormed its way under my skin like a grub, out of sight and out of mind only later to return metamorphosed and fully realized and I can only wish I had uprooted and confronted it from the start.
Her porcelain face formed a charming smile that embellished her seraphic face perfectly but even as enraptured as I was I couldn't help but wonder why it didn't reach her eyes. As she gazed down from her branch there was something in their murky depths that gave me the feeling that she was studying me intently. I pressed the small wooden rabbit tightly between my fingers as though trying to push my nervousness away with it, ignoring the bright red stain my wounded finger left. 


“Who’re you?” I heard myself say, I’d never seen her before. I thought that maybe she was new and had just moved here, but she slipped down from the gnarled tree with the practised elegance of someone who had done it a million times before. 


“You can call me Rose.” 


“This is my spot Rose,” I said. I think she decided I was joking, her smile unwavering as she sat on the other end of my log. 


“You a fan of rabbits then?”


“Not really, used to shoot them back when my dad still had his shotgun licence, thought it was a right laugh.” I locked eyes with her, daring her pretty smile to falter. It didn’t.


“A particular investment then,” 


“You seem to have a particular investment” 
I saw a spark of something in her eyes and she tilted her head in mock provocation.


“And if I do?”  She replied. I felt the smile sneak up on my face before I could stop it.
I left that day with the feeling that I had gotten what I’d always wanted, I felt then that everything was going to change.


The weeks that followed were easily the happiest times of my life. Rose and I spent most days out on the moors and I came to learn that she lived very close to my own place. Though it became clear early on that neither of us wanted to be around our respective households for longer than was necessary. I never broached the subject, the tenseness of the relationship was laid bare from the very first moment I visited her house. There was a stark sense of unease to the household and her mother and father seemed to withdraw consistently from her presence like the repelling of a magnet. It never seemed to bother Rose, but I remember the feeling of indignance that sparked in me whenever I saw this routine play out. Even more so whenever I caught the sidelong glances cast her way, cold and resentful as though they were looking at a thing they hoped would not come into contact with them rather than their own flesh and blood, the way a dog would appreciate a clinging tick. I often wondered what reason there could be for this treatment, but eventually settled that Rose and her parents simply had their differences. Despite her seemingly harsh parents she never once went to school. This was immensely disappointing for me as I remember feeling that her presence there would have made going to school not only bearable but actually pleasant. 


My reason for moving my smoking area had been that Rebecca Grace from year eleven had ran into me smoking by the bins and seized the opportunity to start on her usual bit with me as her sideshow subject. She was smaller than I was and it would've been more than easy to knock her attitude down a peg along with her body down the tall case of front steps to the school. But I wouldn't want to risk breaking any of those pretty little features of hers. I continued to draw on my cigarette, watching her short blonde curls bounce with her exaggerated expressions. I thought back to when her hair was much longer. I recalled that it used to take me forever to plait it as we sat in her parents' conservatory watching the blurry box of a tv that sat in the corner, eating penny sweets from the newsagents that was no longer on the corner. That time felt a whole world away these days, the happy memories lying deep in the scorned recesses of the past, only to be dragged up and desecrated further every time I saw her. 
Though it never really affected me. The effective solution was to just avoid school entirely. 
She had prattled on with feigned sincerity about my extraordinary likeness to an enormous gangly rat she found behind the sports hall, the one that I would later find in my backpack as the punchline of an extraordinarily funny joke later that very same day.


Even now I can recall with such viscerality the gleeful chanting of “RAT RAT RAT” that had ensued at the reveal of the rodent nestled in my bag. 

“Reunited with your long lost twin!” Lucy Green from year ten shouted, I remembered her from primary school, we used to eat our break time snacks together under the old oak in the playground. A squeal of laughter pierced my right ear, Amy Thompson, year eleven, we used to take ballet classes together.  

“The look on her face!” Rebecca. The tears burned, my throat felt swollen. I turned and made my escape, the chorus of laughter erupting further at my fleeing form.
That evening I arrived at the edge of the woods in record time, my eyes burning and brimming with tears. I remember how quickly they disappeared as soon as Rose started speaking, the laughter that shook away my sadness when she instantly dismissed what Rebecca had to said that morning about my appearance and my peers' ridicule.


“Like it matters, it’s all just skin pulled over bones.” She waved a hand. “All just shambling meat sacks with dubious levels of sapience.” she had said. “Particularly in her case.” I barked another laugh and wiped at my face.


The memory of that day embedded itself deeply in my psyche and I found myself throwing myself more and more into my hobby. Rose always seemed fascinated by my carvings and the arrangement was often the same day by day. Rose sat up in her tree, in the branch that hung with a perfect view over my shoulder as I whittled away at both my chunk of wood and whatever conversational topic took my attention that day. 
The subject of my carvings were often animals, woodland creatures, the odd sea creature here and there. Rose would bestow these with praise and my heart would flutter with the complements. This happy routine went unchanged until the day I decided to try something new.


It was getting late into the evening, the last holdout of the sun flaring a soft orange between the trees. I held the finely sculpted chunk of wood out to the dying sunlight to better scrutinise it, a self-portrait, my newest attempt at practising likeness. 


“I don’t like it” 


“No? I think it's wonderful,” Rose leaned a little lower from her perch,


“It can always be improved” I dug my nail into the soft wood, but my attention was fully fixed on her as she edged closer. My gaze retreated downward to the forest floor.


“You seem to think that of everything,” Rose said in dismissal. “It looks the spitting image of you”


“Maybe the sculpture’s not the problem then” I mumbled, digging deeper into the wooden jawline.
She gave no indication that she had heard me and was instead reaching sideways into the hollow crook of the tree. I sat uncomfortably in the silence and rubbed anxiously at the thick layer of foundation I had caked onto my skin that morning which had now begun to flake only serving to make the parts of my cracked skin even more pronounced.
Rose straightened, holding out a tall bottle which she shook with a barely concealed grin. I held up a hand to dismiss the offer but the look of mock offense in her beautiful face batted that notion away and the refusal died in my throat. I smiled and shook my head in what was obviously a gesture of knowing defeat as opposed to an actual attempt at refusing. 


“I have to get up early tomorrow. Dentist. I’m finally getting these fucking things off now that my teeth are apparently straight enough.”


“Is that what those are?” She said in an odd tone. I noticed a line form between her brows. I balked at what had to be either a joke or a lifetime of living under a particularly pre-industrial rock. When her questioning stare went unbroken I gave an awkward sniff of a laugh and ripped my gaze away.


“Was it worth it?” she asked


I scoffed. “Yeah sure, it’s made all the difference to my massive rat teeth.” I sighed. “And there's no fixing the ones at the back.”
My head snapped back up at the sound of feet hitting the forest floor. Rose had dropped from the tree branch and slid onto the near end of the fallen log. I nearly choked in surprise when I felt her soft fingers on the side of my face. She didn't say anything and wore that appraising expression I had come to know well.
I had always been uncomfortably aware of the collection of clashing, odd, little features that was my face. I’d say that it never bothered me, but that wasn’t entirely true. The truth was simply that I was very adept at gaslighting myself into thinking that it didn't make a difference. Something that had since began to wane in effectiveness at the start of this new school year, where this strategy had finally failed in the face of the unbridled, ever-evolving cruelty of my teenage peers. I could see it in the look on Rose’s face that she had noticed as well as I had that I had been harping on the subject as of recent. 


I sat completely frozen. The skin of my face tingled as she brushed it with her thumb and I became aware of the heat that rose rapidly in my face, making me even more conscious of exactly what I must look like at this moment.
She dropped her hand suddenly. 

“Why bother then?” 
I blinked in surprise but after a few seconds of pause I gave my lamentable answer. 


“I suppose it's doing something. Making some sort of change at least”


“Hm.” She silently considered this for a long moment before I watched the needling glint in her eyes disappear as she seemed to dismiss the train of thought with a shake of the bottle.
I walked home late that night, the strange conversation fading with every stumbling step back across the moors.


The next morning was when the changes began, where the snowball that wouldn’t stop rolling until it was far too late began its descent.
I awoke with a tightness around my skull and a deep pressure around my eyes. I remember being struck by how much I must've had to drink when I discovered I couldn't even move my jaw to sigh at what must've been a complete monster of a hangover. I craned my neck sideways to begin the effort of rolling out of bed and the ensuing pain that shot through my head was as if someone had lit a firecracker in my head. I stumbled across the room blindly, pressing my skull tightly between my hands as if to try and smother the burning pain. My hands felt the cold ceramic of the bathroom sink and I forced my eyes open to meet the mirror. There was nothing unexpected about the eyes that strained to stare back, my hollow cheekbones or the crooked nose that had always looked like someone had broken it. But as my visual assessment traveled downwards, my gaze snagged on my lower face. 


An outside observer wouldn’t have given it a second glance, but lengthy periods of intense scrutinisation in front of this very mirror meant that I picked up on the difference intuitively before my mind could identify it. I stood paralyzed, my glare boring into my features, eyes locked on the slightly uncanny image of myself. 
An unsettling feeling began to build in my stomach and I was strangely reminded of a past school trip to this one wax museum in London, where I stood mesmerised in front of wax faces trying to pinpoint exactly why the replicas of this celebrity or that politician did not fully look like themselves.
I brought my hand down to my jaw and gingerly pressed the pale flesh. Had the side always come out that far? Another shot of blinding pain ripped through the bone and I wrenched my mouth open to let out a sob. A cry that died smothered in my throat as I caught a brief glimpse of the inside of my mouth. My eyes glazed over as the feeling of dread that surged made my mind spin and I stared vacantly into the blurred shapes of the reflection before me. Through my disorientation I slowly reopened my mouth to confirm that what I had just seen wasn't simply a trick of the bleary bathroom lights.

I almost threw up at the sight of them. My bottom row of teeth, barred by my braces, had shifted ever so slightly to make space for several new, jutting obtrusions that blossomed from the back of my gum. I stared in horror, forcing back the rising bile creeping its way up my throat. My hand trembled as I reached up and into my mouth. I slowly ran my finger over the neat row of new growths, eyes watering from the deep ache that ruptured anew under the pressure. I rubbed my finger back and forth and back and forth, a salty taste pooling in my jaw, my face red and glistening in wet streaks. This was impossible, how was this possible? I withdrew my shaking hands from my face, the skin around my mouth now spotted with the impressions of my fingers and I was reminded of Rose’s gentle fingers against my face the day before. It couldn't have been, It was insane, completely impossible. I pushed back the creeping tendrils of suspicion from my mind but they found a new home, taking root in my gut and resolving into an absolute instinctual certainty. 


As I stared at the perfect, immaculate, new row of teeth my choking sobs began to subside as a thought began to surface in my mind. Maybe in that moment my ability to think rationally had been swallowed and smothered by the pain. Or perhaps it was my sense of self that had been so utterly eroded that allowed the train of thought to manifest with a sense of sanity and soundness that an outside perspective would never have afforded it. But then and there I had made the inexplicable choice that left me as I am now.


The cracking of wet grass thundered in my ears as I had sprinted across the moor. I found her there, where she always was. She gazed down at me with expectant eyes full of an intense zeal that clashed unsettlingly with her doll-like composure and the placid smile of her face.


“I-” I stammered, I had no words to fully articulate what I was about to ask. 
“Teeth.” was all I managed. The little smile spread and her eyes seemed to glisten.


“Do you like them?” she beamed.
My head still swam with the sickening horror I had felt, but amongst it festered the emergence of a strange, nagging want. I swallowed back the tightness of my throat and speaking my next words felt like diving into ice cold water.


“I- I do. But they don't go with the rest of them.”


“Oh I can help with that if you’d like.” She said brightly, with the light, affable tone of a person offering a sweet. 


“I was hoping you would.” Was my quiet reply.


I chose to forgo my dentist appointment, I wouldn’t be needing it. 
The following morning I awoke to the familiar splitting pain, I smiled through the ache and felt a strange sensation in my mouth, as though it was filled with beads. I sat up carefully and lurched to the vanity before opening my mouth. The stream of small white pellets clattered against the porcelain as they pooled at the base of the sink topped by the glinting silver wires of my braces. My heart dropped as I hurried to inspect the damage. I was met with two rows of pearlescent white teeth, perfectly uniform and immaculate. My admiration of them halted as I could help but notice how out of place the flawless teeth looked paired with my other painfully lackluster features. I dug at my face with my fingernail and my finger came away caked with a thick swath of foundation, leaving my blotchy skin exposed in the bare patch. What I decided to do next didn’t even merit a second of deliberation before I was out the door headed towards the moors. 
When I returned that evening I found myself time and time again drawn back towards the bathroom mirror, inspecting and reinspecting my features. Something I had done throughout my life. But now it was different, now I scrutinised them with a new outlook, for now everything was possible, none of them were unfixable, no longer just the unfortunate permanences of a face I’d just have to accept and live with.


Several weeks passed in a haze and I awoke one morning with a feeling I had not experienced since my very young adolescence. I wanted to go to school, I wanted to go to school with my new face, my newfound sense of self, with my knowlege that everything I had ever been picked on for was gone and in its place was something new and beautiful and admirable.


I was early, and standing on the steps to the school building free of its usual bustling crowd felt strangely hopeful, like overlooking the scene of a blank slate.
I jumped suddenly as I heard my name, the tone was quiet and uncertain, more a question than a call. I snapped my head around to meet eyes framed by short blonde curls that widened as I turned to face her. Rebecca stepped back, I watched her mouth open and then clamp shut again. I couldn’t resist the smile that crept over my face.
She must be feeling terribly jealous, I thought. 


“Well?” I shook my head for emphasis. Got something to say? I thought, fighting back the smile, anticipating the surprise in her voice when she told me how pretty I looked, the envy laden questions about how I achieved such a stunning change. 


“What- what happened to you?”
The tone of her voice pierced me like a gunshot. A deep note of horror racked her voice as she spoke. It wasn’t the awestruck wonder I had been expecting.


I practically collapsed through my front door, the expression of shock and terror on Rebecca’s face burning in my mind like a white hot brand. I staggered up the staircase and barrelled into the bathroom, hunching over the bathroom mirror with the feral fervour of a predator descending on a carcass. I ran my shaking fingers down my face over and over. Rebecca’s reaction had shattered the carefully crafted perception I had spent the last few weeks labouring over bit by bit, and now stood under the harsh light of the bathroom, in the harsh light of reality forced upon me, I could see with clarity what stood before me in the mirror. It had a pliable quality to it, like putty. It held pockets and divots and had begun to crack in places, the small red inflammations of my eczema replaced by the splitting texture of overworked clay. There was nothing of myself that I could recognise, a misshapen clay form, overworked on the pottery wheel, every small imperfection reworked again and again blinkered by tunnel vision until the shape of the thing in its entirety had become senseless and lost.


“I- I want my face back” I croaked, collapsed amongst the billowing grass of the moors, the tears stinging as they slid down my skin.


“You didn’t like your old face” Rose cocked her head to one side, “you can’t decide to do away with something then want it back, that’s hardly fair.”


“Fair?” I breathed, “fair? Is this a game to you? What are there rules to this or something?” Injecting as much sarcasm as my broken form could muster.


“In a manner of speaking. In your manner of speaking in fact.”
I fell silent. My paralysed limbs didn’t move as she crept closer.
“What’s said is said, what’s done is done.” She said, her voice so soft it was almost a whisper. Then she straightened suddenly, her eyes glistening with unconcealed pitilessness.
She smiled wider, the corners of her mouth pulling back unnaturally far, revealing what seemed like more teeth than a person should have. My heart pounded. I stared on as she waved her hands fervidly as she spoke, her composed demeanor becoming jittery and excitable. As she lost her composure she seemingly began to lose her guise. Her beautiful face slipping like the slowly seeping features of a melting wax figure. 
“People are so much fun. Your flesh is so malleable, easy to be shaped and sculpted like clay” she said leaning forward. “Or whittled, like a totem” her eyes brightened at that last comparison and she looked to me as if expecting me to appreciate the sentiment.
I choked on the horrid slurry of bile and words that fought their way up my throat. An overwhelming sense of hopelessness drowned my mind as it gasped for any possibility of a restorative, a fix to this. My eyes locked with hers and in their abhorrent depths everything was laid bare for me. My stomach squirmed as I saw her for what she was and I knew there was no recourse. I turned and ran. 


Now, I lay curled on my bathroom floor where I write this. It’s taken me a while, it’s been painstaking to type out each word at the angle I have to hold my head at. It would’ve made it much more difficult if any of it had gotten on the screen. I cannot speak a word to anyone about this, even if anyone was to believe me I think my jaw now lies in a mottled heap next to my shoulder. I can’t be sure, it’s hard to tell in this dark. I am beyond help, but the darkness is a small comfort. It allows me a senseless blank canvas to think, to picture my old face, to trace the shapes of my old likeness and imagine for even a second that it is what I would be met with if I flicked on the lights and brought myself to that mirror once more.
