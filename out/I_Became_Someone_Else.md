My name is Liam. If anyone reads this, just one person, it’s enough. I just need someone to hear me before it’s too late.

My life was normal, I think. I lived with my grandma in Parksville, Canada. My mom overdosed when I was too young to remember, and I never knew my dad. Grandma never talked about either of them much. But life was fine. She cooked whatever I wanted, told stories about the “old country” even though she had never been to Ireland. I had friends. We played D&D all night, wasted hours on video games. Then high school ended, and we drifted apart.

At nineteen, I was in college, lonely but managing. Days blurred together—class, gaming, sleep, repeat. It felt like I was watching my life through a dirty window, like nothing I did mattered.

Then I met him.

An old man, sitting next to me at the bus stop. His skin sagged as if it were melting off his skull, a sickly gray with deep creases, his pale eyes pleading for something I couldn’t understand. He smelled—an old, rotten scent that clung to my clothes. I tried to ignore him, but he mumbled something.

“Sorry, what?” I asked.

He didn’t answer. Just stared at me. The bus came, and I got on, relieved to leave him behind.

The days after felt... wrong. My friends came over one night for D&D, and halfway through, Raph stopped the game.

“Dude, you good?”

“What?”

“You look exhausted.”

I laughed it off, but later, in the mirror, I saw it—thin wrinkles around my eyes. Strange, but I brushed it off. Stress, maybe.

Then my grandma said something over dinner that froze me.

“Are you wearing contacts?”

“What? No.”

“Your eyes… they look… blue.”

I ran to the bathroom. She was right. My green eyes had turned a dull, washed-out blue. I stared at my reflection for hours, checking every mirror, every camera, every window reflection. My stomach felt hollow. I told myself it was the lighting. Just a trick of the mind.

Then I started losing my hair.

It thinned at the front, strands falling like dead leaves in the shower. My forehead grew. My hair color faded. My friend suggested shaving it off, but I couldn’t. Instead, I spent hours staring into my reflection, pulling at my scalp, measuring the damage. My heart pounded every time I caught my reflection in a passing window, something sick and unfamiliar staring back at me.

Then I shrank.

Not weight loss—my body was literally getting smaller. Shirts hung loose. Pants dragged on the floor. I measured myself obsessively. 6’2”, then 6’, then 5’10” within weeks.

I should’ve gone to a doctor, but I was terrified of hearing the truth. Instead, I waited for things to fix themselves, telling myself I was just imagining it. But my face—my face—kept changing. My nose shortened, my chin jutted forward, my forehead bulged slightly. It was as if something was molding me into a different person.

One night, my friends saw me and recoiled.

“What the hell happened to you?”

I had no answer. Their horror confirmed what I already knew. I wasn’t me anymore.

I sat alone in the silence of my house, watching my hands wither, my nails yellow, my skin loosen. The house smelled different—dusty, stale, old.

Then I remembered the old man. The way his face sagged, the color of his eyes, the way his lips had moved when he spoke.

“It’s too late for you.”

My friends don’t recognize me anymore. Even my own reflection is a stranger. I have no records, no ID, no proof that I was ever Liam. I don’t know who—or what—I am now.

I don’t know if I lost time or if I lost myself. But I’m so tired. So very tired.

Maybe if I close my eyes, I’ll wake up as myself again.

Maybe if I close them long enough… I won’t wake up at all.
