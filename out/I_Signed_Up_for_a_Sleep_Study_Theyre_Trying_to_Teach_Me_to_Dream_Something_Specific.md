I didn’t ask many questions.

They offered a decent payout, clean facilities, and a private room. I was broke, barely sleeping anyway, and figured why not get paid to lie down?

They called it the Somna Research Initiative. Said they were developing technology to guide lucid dreaming. “Like training wheels for your subconscious,” the intake doctor told me. “Completely safe.”

The building was tucked behind a closed-down outlet mall. Concrete walls, no signage, just a nondescript gray door that buzzed open when I knocked.

I should’ve turned around then.

Inside was spotless—too spotless. No scuff marks, no dust, no smell. The kind of clean that feels staged. Like no one really lives in it.

The intake nurse was polite but distant, barely making eye contact. She handed me a form with three bolded questions at the top:

Do you have a history of vivid or recurring dreams?


Have you ever seen yourself asleep within a dream?


Do you currently feel safe in your own mind?


I checked no on all three.

She didn’t even glance at the paper. Just led me down a narrow hallway, past identical closed doors. Mine was labeled S-Room 4.

“Don’t worry if the lights flicker,” she said. “It’s just part of the equipment syncing.”

“Syncing with what?” I asked.

She paused. Her smile didn’t reach her eyes.

“Dream state resonance.”

I didn’t know what that meant. Still don’t

The Room

It was small, but comfortable. White bed, white walls, no windows. A metal nightstand. One camera in the corner, red light blinking.

The ceiling had this… dome built into it. Like a wide eye, dark and glossy, embedded in the plaster above the bed.

“Dream Induction Array,” they called it. It was supposed to emit tones during REM cycles. “To guide the neural pathways,” the tech explained.

That night, I fell asleep fast. Too fast. It felt like my body was pulled downward the second I closed my eyes.

The dream wasn’t anything special. Just black water stretching in every direction, rippling beneath an invisible sky. I floated in it. Not cold. Not warm. Just there.

Then something moved under the surface. Something massive. I couldn’t see it—only feel the shift. The way the water curled in on itself like it was recoiling.

And from far off, I heard a voice. My voice.

Repeating:

“You’re dreaming. You’re dreaming. You’re dreaming.”

But I wasn’t saying it.

Day Two

I woke up with blood in my nose.

The nurse said that was normal. “Some mild pressure leakage from REM over-immersion,” she called it. I didn’t know what that meant either.

They asked me a lot of questions during the day. What did I see? Did I hear anyone else? Could I feel anything watching me?

The last question felt too specific. Like they already knew the answer.

That night, the dome hummed. A low tone, not loud, but deep. I felt it in my teeth.

The dream was different this time.

Same water. Same dark. But there was something floating next to me. A figure—face-down, hair drifting like it was underwater.

It looked like me.

I tried to touch it, but my hand passed right through. And then it twitched.

Not a full movement. Just a little jerk of the neck. Like it was trying to look up.

I woke up screaming.

They sedated me before I could stand.

I kept hearing it long after I woke up.

“You’re dreaming.”

Over and over. Not loud, not clear. Like it was being whispered from another room. Or from inside my own head. I didn’t tell them. I thought maybe if I ignored it, it would stop.

It didn’t.

It changed.

That night, I hesitated before lying down. The dome above the bed felt… heavier somehow. Like it had shifted an inch closer to my face.

They said it was just the visual effect of curved glass.

I lay there for hours, or maybe minutes—time got slippery in that place. Eventually, the humming started. A little louder than before. It felt like something was warming up.

Then I blinked—and I was in the water again.

Same black expanse. No sky. No stars. Just me, floating in the dark.

Except this time, the figure was gone.

There was no second body beside me. No mirror image drifting gently at my side.

But I wasn’t alone.

There were ripples.

Something was moving below the surface. Not gliding—swimming. Fast. It passed just beneath me, close enough that the water folded around my ankles like hands.

I spun, trying to find it, but I couldn’t see anything. Not even my own reflection.

And then the voice came again.

Not from the water.

Not from above.

From inside me.

“You’re dreaming. You’re dreaming. You’re dreaming.”

Except it wasn’t my voice anymore.

It was deeper. Slurred. Like someone wearing my voice like a coat they didn’t quite fit into.

“You’re dreeeaming.”

It echoed like it was bouncing off the inside of my skull.

I woke up gasping. The ceiling dome was inches from my face—lower than it had ever been.

I bolted upright. My nose was bleeding again. The sheets were soaked with sweat, or maybe more. I couldn’t tell. The red light on the camera blinked steadily.

Recording.

Watching.

Still humming.

Day Four

I tried to talk to the nurse. The one with the cold eyes and practiced smile.

I told her I couldn’t stop hearing it.

She tilted her head slightly. “Hearing what?”

“The phrase. You’re dreaming. It’s constant. I heard it in the hallway earlier. I think something’s wrong with the equipment. Maybe I’m—”

“Do you feel unsafe in your own mind?” she asked, cutting me off.

Her tone didn’t change. But she’d written something down before I even answered.

I said no.

She smiled.

“Good. That means the synchronization is working.”

I don’t know what that means.

Later, when I was back in my room, I tried not to sleep. I chewed caffeine gum until my jaw hurt. Stared at the light. Blinked fast to stay awake.

But the room hummed. Not just the dome—everything. The walls, the floor, the air.

Like the dream was already there, just waiting for me.

I passed out sometime around 3 AM.

Night Four

There was no water this time.

Just black.

Not darkness—nothing.

And I wasn’t floating.

I was falling.

Endless, weightless descent into something that didn’t feel like a dream anymore.

There were shapes far below me. Vague things, massive and unmoving. But they weren’t shadows. They were outlines. Empty spaces where things used to be.

And then I saw it.

Myself.

At least… something that looked like me. Pale skin, hollow eyes, hanging in the void like a puppet on strings. It was facing away. Breathing.

Barely.

Then its head twitched to the side.

Not turned. Twitched.

Like a glitch.

And the voice filled the black.

“You’re dreaming.”

But it wasn’t in my head anymore.

It was everywhere.

It was all of them.

Thousands of versions of me. Floating. Twisting. Speaking in unison.

“You’re dreaming. You’re dreaming. You’re dreaming.”

But I wasn’t.

I was awake.

I woke up choking.

Not gasping—choking. My mouth full of copper, my throat clotted with something thick and metallic. I rolled off the bed and spit onto the tile.

Blood. A lot of it.

My hands were shaking so badly I could barely wipe my mouth. I looked up at the dome above the bed, and that’s when I saw it.

A smear.

Faint but visible. Blood—not pooled, not splattered. Wiped across the inside of the glass in a slow, uneven curve. Like a hand had dragged across it. From the inside.

But that made no sense. The dome was supposed to be sealed.

And I hadn’t touched it.

I stood there for a long time, just staring at it. The blood was dark. Old. Not fresh like the stuff in my mouth.

It didn’t match.

There was no response when I called for the nurse.

Only the low, vibrating hum of the dome—just loud enough to feel in my teeth. I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.

Day Five

They acted like nothing was wrong.

No one came to clean the dome. No one asked why my sheets were stained. They didn’t even give me the usual questionnaire.

When I brought up the blood, the nurse frowned gently and said, “It’s not uncommon for the subconscious to externalize trauma during early-phase lucid stabilization.”

I asked her what that meant.

She just said, “You’re progressing faster than we expected,” and offered me a paper cup of pills I’d never seen before.

I didn’t take them.

Back in my room, I tried to stay awake again. I stood for hours, pacing in slow circles, pressing my palms against the cold tile floor whenever I felt my eyes get heavy.

But sometime after midnight, I slipped.

Just for a second.

I don’t even remember closing my eyes.

Night Five

I wasn’t in the water.

I wasn’t anywhere.

It was black again—so complete it made my thoughts feel like they echoed.

And something spoke.

Not the usual phrase. Not the looping, whisper-thin mantra.

This was clearer. Closer.

And it asked me a question.

“Do you feel safe in your own mind?”

The words came in my voice. Exactly my voice. But with the timing off. Like a recording played back at a slightly wrong speed.

I tried to answer, but my throat didn’t work. My mouth moved. No sound.

And then something touched me.

Not physically. Inside.

Like a finger pressed against my memory. Something tracing the shape of a thought that wasn’t ready to be remembered.

And I felt it again—that awareness.

Not of being watched.

Of being learned.

Like something behind my eyes was trying to figure out how to be me.

I woke up screaming.

This time, the blood was on my hands.

Day Six

The nurse avoided my room.

Someone else brought breakfast. No clipboard, no smile, no questions.

There were scratches on the inside of my palms. Thin, crescent-shaped marks. Like I’d been digging my nails in too deep.

But they weren’t mine.

They were bigger.

I stared at the mirror above the sink for an hour. Not at myself—at the way I blinked.

The timing was wrong. Too slow. Too deliberate.

I tried to blink faster. Force it to feel normal.

It didn’t work.

Later that day, I heard something behind the wall. A voice. My own.

Repeating.

Not the full phrase this time.

Just one word.

“Dreaming.”

Over and over.

Slower each time. Stretching it out.

“Dreeeeaaaaming.”

Until it sounded like a groan.

Until it stopped sounding human.

Final Entry – Night Seven

I didn’t try to fight it anymore.

They stopped giving me pills. Stopped asking questions. The cameras still blinked in the corners, but no one came in. Not even for food.

I wasn’t sure if I was still under the sleep study, or if it had ended without telling me. I wasn’t sure the facility was even real anymore.

The dome above the bed had cracked.

I didn’t do it.

The fracture spread like a vein across the glass, pulsing slightly. I stared at it for hours, waiting for it to split open. Waiting for something to climb out.

But nothing did.

That night, the dream came again—but this time I didn’t fall into it.

I stepped into it.

Like I was sliding through wet fabric. Like reality had a seam that had finally torn open.

And I was inside.

The black water. The massive shapes beneath the surface. The whisper in my voice that now spoke in full sentences.

“There isn’t room for both of us.”

I didn’t understand. I tried to move, but I couldn’t feel my body. I looked down—and saw myself.

Not me, exactly.

The other me. The one that had been following me. Learning me. The one that had been whispering.

It looked… perfect.

Down to the last scar. The birthmark on my hip. The slight twist in my left thumb from an old break.

But its eyes were wrong.

Too awake.

I screamed. Or I think I did. It didn’t matter.

The water surged upward. Not like a wave—like a mouth.

It swallowed me.

I woke up in a fresh room.

No cracks in the dome. No blood. No whispers.

The nurse smiled at me when I emerged.

“Welcome back,” she said.

She gave me clean clothes and led me outside. The sun was blinding. I blinked against it and realized I was crying.

I didn’t feel like myself.

Everything was too sharp. Too balanced. My thoughts felt organized. Efficient. Scripted.

It wasn’t until I got home that I realized what had changed.

I don’t dream anymore.

Not even once.

Not even a flicker.

Just darkness.

And silence.

Except, sometimes—when I’m alone in the house—I hear the old phrase. Muffled.

Not outside.

Not in my head.

From under the bed.

From the place where I used to sleep.

“You’re dreaming.”

But I’m not.

I never will again.

Because he’s the one who sleeps now.

And I’m the one who got out.
