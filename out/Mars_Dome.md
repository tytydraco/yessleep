Tall, decrepit neon lined wooden buildings littered Arcadia, it was 2103, and Earth was a burnt mess, having been hit by a large asteroid in 2079, Arcadia sat at the heart of Mars, the largest Domed area on the now water-ridden (within domes) planet, Jackson ran through the swamp area with his electrified long-blade, doing a routine cleaning of the large ugly swamp creatures, running along the border he dragged the sword against the hexagon-lined dome, the sharpness and electricity doing nothing to the structure, one of the creatures came out of the muddy water, its large body and large singular one eye letting out a guttural noise before Jackson used his circular momentum to swing it around and cut the monsters head off, he had dropped 3 bodies before concluding no more of the monsters were old enough to erupt from the waters, the waters were so toxic that no device available to them could eradicate the spawn, they simply disintegrated upon contact.  

Leaving to go back home Jackson went by the bakery and bought a large chicken and vegetable pie for the last main meal he and Rick would have in the day, Rick coming back from his hunt on Ramen, he was privately payed by various people to take out rapists in various ways, Ramen had raped a 16 year old girl earlier that week, leaving her head on a pike outside her parents house, her parents had payed a hefty sum to inflict pain on Ramen before he died, Rick had done so by shooting Ramen in one kneecap and then the other 5 minutes later, then in the elbow and the other one 5 minutes later, then slamming a knife into his feet and hands, he was begging for death after the second kneecap, it took him 5 hours to bleed out from the start, Rick locking him in a dark room after 1 hour. “I had a brutal day” Rick said, closing the wooden door slightly broken at the bottom behind him, “don’t tell me” Jackson said, putting the pie on the table centered by a large candle, “I have an idea to get rid of the swamp monsters” “what’s that” “put botulinum toxins in the water, only a few drops in each general area should do” “where can you get that” “Remedy at the herbology store has it” he projected an opaque screen in front of Rick from his eyes, showing the stock, “yep” Rick replied flatly, cutting a large piece of the pie out onto his plate.  

“Do we have any green smoothie left,” “no, but I can make some more,” the green smoothie Jackson characteristically made contained a mixture of banana, kiwi fruit, strawberry, kale, ice and honey. He went to the kitchen and put the ingredients in the blender, producing two tall glasses of the smoothie, walking back over to the table he saw Rick already hungrily digging into the pie “did you not eat today” “no, all I had was a coffee in the morning, and I nearly vomited it up after hearing Ramen screaming” he sipped on the smoothie gratefully, “I quit my job, I’m not doing this shit no more” “what will you do now” “I am going to rob expensive paintings and sell weed, I am also going to help you kill the monsters around the dome” “that sounds like a good idea, you have enough to get a decent amount of weed” “yes I do” “lets go then, I know where the plugs house is” they hopped in their levitating mercedes car, modernised with spherical wheels with blue lines across it and small wings on the side, they drove quickly through the sky to the top of a large, tippy wooden structure on which the top level was occupied by the plug Lip, they knocked on his door and punched him hard in the face, he fell backward and tumbled into a chair and table, Rick slammed a wooden panel he found on the ground into his head, and he fell down, obviously knocked out, a little bit of blood dropping off his head.

Smelling the air, Richard found nothing, he perused around the house quickly until he came across a large bag of weed placed conspicuously under his bed, he picked it up and ran out of the house, tapping Rick to attention on the way out, ignoring the man on the ground, they hopped back into their car and flew back home, picking up their phone and calling a really hot junkie girl they knew from their old school, she had a lot of money from older men she played repeatedly, she wanted to help them and bought the whole bag for 10k, they stashed the money under their mattress and went back to the dinner table to put two more slices of the pie on plates next to two freshly prepared green smoothies, eating them hungrily Rick washed the plates and they met back at the table to plot some more, their was an old rich guy in an underground mansion inaccessible to anyone who didn’t know the secret entry in the alleyway next to a coffee shop, all he had to do was pull at a lever attached to the wall in a specific pattern and an invisibility cloak fell over them, taking them through the floor beneath them into the mansion, down there lay a wide expanse of black and white marble flaws, and white walls, large potted plants and expensive art lying around the place, the old man sat at the end, facing away from them, toward a large computer screen, typing away with rickety hands at the keyboard, Jackson and Rick, with masks on, walked relatively normally up to the wall on the right, and took down as many paintings as they could, putting them into the large double layered plastic bags they both held, taking them back out, the old man did not notice anything, glued to his computer screen.

They rose back up to the alleyway by stepping into the invisibility cloak on the floor, fading in and out of space-time, taking the bags they ran around the corner and found their car sitting there, getting in it they flew home and again sat together at the table, singular candle burning away, leaving a pyramid shaped waxy mess on the table, they fell into the chairs and put the bags on the floor, “we did it” “yep” jackson replied flatly, “you know the electric sword I have” “yeah” “there is a new one, fire is attached to it, the fire modified to last longer and burn harder” “I will use this one against the swamp monsters” he projected the store location and dematerialised infront of the guy behind the desk, “I need one fire sword” “sure,” he went over to the wall and pulled the sword down, handing it over, it was the same length as the electric one, engraved with old runes to spawn the fire in the presence of a violent urge, he took it, “thank you” he left the store and took the car back home, stopping at the weed store on the way home, it became legal when the laws and writings founding Mars were established, weed stores littered Arcadia, mostly down-scale and dingy ones, wooden like the rest of Arcadia, when the dome was founded the first thing to be established was the water source and trees, a large plantation occupying approximately 30% of the domes area, midded by a large lake regenerated by a large hollowed out area connecting to the icecaps at the north and south poles of Mars, supplying all the domes from water at its borders, the swamp area was at its farthest side, bordering the woods was the farm area, containing all the plantation and animals we used for eating and the like, then going to various expensive houses, and then to the tall jumbles of wooden neon apartments, there existed around 200 thousand people in Arcadia, (unfinished)
