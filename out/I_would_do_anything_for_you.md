My name is Shelah,  I am 24 years old and I now live with my mom.  I am currently attending college where I am studying to be a dental surgeon. I am on my 5th year.  I was employed at the local bakery part time up until recently.   I take the local bus wherever I go, alternatively I walk if it's close enough since I no longer have a car.

That's all you need to know about me, the rest of the details are pretty boring.

That was until about 3 months ago.  I haven't stopped looking over my shoulder since.

I met my best friend,  Ethan on my second year of college, he had just come from another state and transfered to our college.   He was in my class, since he was studying to be an orthodontist.    I didn't know much about him at first, he was mysterious.. in a very attractive way. (You know what I mean)

Ethan never opened up and he never told me why he relocated and it didn't matter , it was none of my business.

Have you ever met someone so charming that you immediately hit it off with them?  This was the case with Ethan.  He was mysterious, charming and warm. I immediately felt a strong connection.    

We became friends and spent most of our time together.   We went to parties, took hikes along to river, studied together and he was a good friend, really protective, really loving. I always felt so safe.

After about a year of being friends, I knew Ethan would do anything for me as he always made clear by his favorite phrase "I would do anything for you buddy" always immediately after I thanked him for coming through for me in the most amazing ways that Noone else ever had.
