I would do anything for you



My name is Shelah,  I am 24 years old and I now live with my mom.  I am currently attending college where I am studying to be a dental surgeon. I am on my 5th year.  I was employed at the local bakery part time up until recently.   I take the local bus wherever I go, alternatively I walk if it's close enough since I no longer have a car.

That's all you need to know about me, the rest of the details are pretty boring.

That was until about 3 months ago.  I haven't stopped looking over my shoulder since.

I met my best friend,  Ethan on my second year of college, he had just come from another state and transfered to our college.   He was in my class, since he was studying to be an orthodontist.    I didn't know much about him at first, he was mysterious.. in a very attractive way. (You know what I mean)

Ethan never opened up and he never told me why he relocated and it didn't matter , it was none of my business.

Have you ever met someone so charming that you immediately hit it off with them?  This was the case with Ethan.  He was mysterious, charming and warm. I immediately felt a strong connection.    

We became friends and spent most of our time together.   We went to parties, took hikes along to river, studied together and he was a good friend, really protective, really loving. I always felt so safe.

After about a year of being friends, I knew Ethan would do anything for me as he always made clear by his favorite phrase "I would do anything for you buddy" always immediately after I thanked him for coming through for me in the most amazing ways that Noone else ever had.

The first few times, since we had just become friends I didn't want to be a bother, I didn't want him to know I needed help but he was cunning and with his piercing gaze he always got every last drop of information from me as if he was a "jedi mind control master".

Anyway, the first time I had a problem it was with an assignment, nothing major but I couldn't find the information I needed to finish the poster for class so he drove me to the library, then the internet cafe and eventually to his dentist (it was a dental assignment)to find the answers i was looking for, that was amazing. I was so happy to have someone like this.

I got an 80 on that assignment thanks to him. What An amazing friend.

He would always come through for me in these amazing ways, both big and small, I felt loved.


"Anything for you, buddy"! He said

There was a time right after my dad's heart surgery where I was really worried and just sad.  He spent most nights with me just sitting with me, talking, listening and we got through the hard times together.

Another beautiful moment was when I got really sick with the measles and I couldn't afford Healthcare, he took me to the doctors and eventually to the hospital when it got bad. He sat by my side, almost the entire time. 


"Anything for you buddy" he said as I had gotten accustomed to

I remember the time I was the most touched was when he intervened when one of these typical bitches insulted me for being broke.  He stood up for me in a way no friend ever has then he took me to the mall and bought me clothes.

What did I do to deserve such a loyal, amazing friend?


"Anything for you buddy"!

He picked me up when my car was broken,  gave me money when my bakery salary left me without food and even took me home to see my parents when my dad had his third heart attack.    When my dad passed last year, it was so hard.   He was there the entire time. He came to the funeral, stayed for 3 weeks with my Mom, little sis and I and helped out all over, mowing the lawn, doing repairs,  cleaning the gutters.  


"Anything for you" 

After a while both my mom and sister would ask me if this man was in love with me and why I don't want to be in a relationship with him. "Why haven't you guys ever dated?" My little sister would ask. 

I didn't feel that way about him and I know he didn't see me that way either.  He didn't want that. He said I was his sister.
At the end of the year we had a school break. An extended one.  He suggested that it might be a good idea to go back to where I grew up and visit my family again since they had a rough year.   I asked him why he never goes home or visits his family but he just brushed it off and said that family matters for him was complicated and I am his family.

We drove for hours to get home and eventually got there where he was welcomed as a son.   He wanted to explore a large portion of my home town this time, see where i went to school, where I spent most of my time. He was so interested in my life. It was really sweet.


After the vacation was over, we had to go back to campus, I was ready for my 5th year and had already got all the new text books thanks to him.

The semester started off quite rocky with water damage in my apartment due to rain.  I had a huge fight with the landlord who refused to do the repairs. I was astonished when the landlord changed his mind and brought over people to repair the damage and repaint the whole apartment.  I tried to thank the landlord but he hurried away and wouldn't look me in the eye 

How strange!

I ignored it and went about my week

I got a text from Ethan during the week asking "did you see what I arranged for you?" I had no idea what he was referring to at the time so I asked what he meant and he just said "your apartment"  I asked what he did and he just responded "I took care of it, anything for you buddy!"

Well, it was kind of weird but it was nice to have a newly painted place and all the repairs done so I didn't question it much although I really wondered how he convinced the landlord.

Later that week everything escalated when I got fired from my job for no reason. The owner said he couldn't afford to pay me anymore.  So I had to look for another job. When I told Ethan about it he got angry and said that I didn't deserve it. I didn't hear from him for a while.  I was alarmed when I heard 2 days later that bakery had burned down.  The inspector ruled it an accident.   


Strange timing!

I got a cryptic message from Ethan that night "anything for you buddy" with a wink emoticon. He didn't respond when I asked when he meant but I'm quite sure I know  what he meant.

I started to worry to what extent he was going in order to make me happy. Was this his doing? Could it be that this sweet, amazing person I've known for 3 years could have done something that drastic?

I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt until we could talk again.

I didn't see him at school the next few days, I tried calling but received no answer.

About a week later he finally came to school saying there were personal matter he had to attend to but told me to leave it alone when I asked about the fire.

At the time I had been having so many issues and it never dawned on me why I was having them, simply that I had someone who was always willing to help me and that was amazing.

I received a call from the school later that day telling me they didn't receive my registration for the new school year and that i was not really registered.   This stressed me out severely.  After spending hours in the phone with the dean of admissions she admitted that there was a mistake and my registrations were misplaced but it was too late to rectify since they already filled my seat.  I was quite devastated. This meant I could only join classes the next semester.

That night Ethan came over to cheer me up. He was himself; making jokes, distracting me with well thought out anecdotes and eventually putting me to bed after I fell asleep.   He spent the night.   That was the plan, anyway.     I woke up at about 3am to find him gone.    I went to check the couch and his pillows and blanket were still there.    Then I heard the key turn in the door and rushed to bed.   

Closing my eyes tightly I pretended to be asleep hearing the footsteps.  I heard the footsteps get louder, louder and then stop right next to me.  I felt a kiss on my cheek and the blankets being pulled up after which the foot steps faded further. I opened my eyes to find him snuggling into the couch.

where did he go?

The next morning was quiet. He didn't say much when we had breakfast. After breakfast he said he needed to go, his first class was at 8. He gave me a sympathetic look and then left. 

I decided to do some cleaning and redecorating during the day while in the afternoon i walked about town trying to find a new job. I passed the bakery which was heavily burned still curious about how this happened

I hope he didn't do this

I decided to go into my favorite coffee shop and give the manager my resume.  People seemed flustered as they were whispering among one another.

"Whats going on?" I asked the manager pointing at the commotion  around me 

"Didn't you hear? This morning the dean of admissions was found dead in her kitchen!" He said 

"It was very gruesome apparently, her head was severed from her body, the police still don't know where it is" he continued 

I asked him if they have any idea how it happened and he told me the cops have no leads.

could this be what I think it is?


I started to panic

I greeted the manager and went home.   As I reached the door of my bedroom there was a note. I removed it from the door.  All it read was "anything for you buddy"

This time I knew exactly what it meant.

At this point I started to be nervous.  What happened to my friend?  For the first time in 3 years I felt fearful as I tried to call him.  It went straight to voice-mail.

Later that night he showed up at my place nonchalantly as if he had just come from the park.  He asked me how my day went and I could barely keep a straight face.

"Did you do it?" I asked him

"Do what?" He responded 

"You know what!" I reacted to his sudden confusion 

"OH that!" He said  while turning around and strolling about the apartment 

"Anything for you buddy" he said with a serious look in his eyes I couldn't understand 

A serious expression that can silence a room

"How could you do something like that?  Who are you?" I asked

"What? I was helping YOU! I thought you'd be happy!" He said, clearly astonished by my response 


It was as if he had expected me to somehow be okay with this 

"I never asked for you to do something like that! I thought you knew me!  I thought I knew you!" I said realizing too late that I might had made a mistake

He had an upset look in his eyes that I had never seen before.  He looked betrayed. 


He immediately stormed out!

I didn't stop him. He was not who I thought he was.


 But… who was he?

I needed to find out.   I locked my doors and tried to go to bed that night hoping that he wouldn't somehow get inside my apartment.  It was a quiet night.

A week ago, I woke up early in the morning: 6 am. 

Ready to find out exactly who this person is; I was going to do some research.   

I walked up to my car when I noticed something on the back. 


It was a note stuck to my trunk.  


It was from him. 


  It just said "open".

what the hell?

I opened the trunk and what I saw made me vomit:  It was the landlord.  


His body, It was without a head. 


 Taped to it was another note: "anything for You!" 


 I screamed so loud they could hear me on Mars.  I shut the trunk quickly and drove away.

You might ask why I didn't call the police at this point but I was scared.  These were people that I had the intent to kill after all, they were causing me problems and all the evidence was pointing towards me so defeated I just drove. 

Three towns over I finally stopped. I needed help. I checked the yellow pages and found a relatively cheap PI and phoned him.  He was happy to help me find out more about my friend. All he needed was a picture and some DNA.  I have him the glass my friend used the night he was over and he was on his way.   I needed to make sure I was away from the apartment. 

I then rented a room with the last money I had left. Id have to go home soon. I had no other choice.

The PI said I needed to give him two days so thats exactly what I did. 

A day went by and I needed some air so I walked about town. This was a really small town but the environment was nice so I checked out the local scenery,  sat in the park and stalked the news stands. 


Thats where I saw it: The missing person reports. 

 

They were looking for the landlord. Next to it was a reward, someone was searching for owner of the bakery and his family; They had all dissapeared over the weekend and Noone had heard from them since.  I had a feeling that he might have done the same thing to them.  

I was petrified and decided to lock myself in the room until I hear from the PI.

When I arrived at my room the door was open.

what the hell?

I'm one of those blonde girls in the movies that would walk towards danger and yell "hello" to the dark so naturally I just had to go in.

As I carefully entered the room I nearly passed out.  MY ENTIRE WALL was plastered with post it notes of all different colors all with the same words over and over 

ANYTHING FOR YOU! 

This time it was written in very scrappy hand writing; It looked as if it was rushed.   I hurried out of there and went to a public place where I'd be safe.

I decided to call the PI.  He told me to give him an hour; He had found something.


I sat at the diner as I waited for the PI.  He was 2 hours late.  My fingers nervously tapping on the table while I planned on an escape should he not show up.  I felt like the last survivor on  an apocalypse movie with nowhere to go.

An hour later I decided to leave.

I ran back to the apartment to grab my bag so I could get in my car and leave.   

That's when I saw it.

The car of the PI was parked in the field across the street from the motel.

why is he here?

I walked over to go confront him. He never showed up and he's just relaxing over here. 

The car had a peaceful silence to it as if it has been there for hours.

I took a step closer and knocked on the window.   When I peered in I saw the PI lying backward on the seat with a slit throat and blood running down his clothes.   

he's dead

"AH FUCK!!!"

I was about to walk away when I saw a note on the windscreen. 

This one was different

"You have betrayed yourself, you have betrayed us. I would do anything for you even kill those who hurt you. And now that person is you"

I knew what that meant.   I dashed for my car to get the fuck out of there.  I was scared to go home because he knew where i lived but if I didn't go he'd kill them too.

I decided it would be best to set my car on fire and abandon it. So I pushed it down the lake 100 miles out of town and took hikes to get home.

On the way home my phone buzzed so I reluctantly opened it up to check. It was an email from a certain brooks PI. The subject line read "This what I found"  

He must have sent this before he got killed

I wondered to myself whether I wanted to open the attachments. If this guy went to the great lengths of actually killing the PI. What could be this bad?  Worse than murder?

I slowly started on the attachments.

The first one, quite obviously was the DNA analysis matching his identity. I was yet again, startled when I saw the name attached to the DNA analysis outcome.  "Chuck abotte" I read.  

This was not the name I knew him by

There were some news paper articles and police report.

Basically what I gathered from the information was that I befriended a very dangerous person who had murdered his parents.


 The police never found the killer until he was placed in a foster home and he murder the entire family.   He was deemed mentally unstable and placed in an asslym.  Which he escaped 3 and a half years ago. They were still looking for him.

I am currently at home hiding from everyone I changed my phone number, moved with my mom and sister to a small apartment on the other side of town and are hiding unsure of what to do next.

Should I call the police? Should I get another PI to find him? Should we move to another town?  How long until he catches us an kills us?  

I was a friend but not he would do anything to protect me from hurting myself by betraying him and sadly the cost is death
