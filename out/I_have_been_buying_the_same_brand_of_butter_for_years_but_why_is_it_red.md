I love cooking and try to cook as much as I can, it's hard to cook all the time given my busy schedule but my passion for cooking makes me find a way to fit it in with my busy schedule.

As much as I love cooking, I love using butter as an ingredient, it's a really versatile ingredient that enchances any dish, I use it in nearly every dish I make and I have been buying the same brand of butter for years, I have experimented with different brands but none matches the quality and taste of the brand I have been buying for so long.

But today as I melted the butter in the pan, ready to prepare a hearty breakfast for myself, I noticed it turned red, at first I thought I was dreaming, maybe I hadn't slept well enough last night and I rubbed my eyes and looked again but it was still red.

I switched off the flame and took the pan away from the stove, I took a small metal spoon and tasted it, it tasted just like butter but the color was red, I couldn't understand what was happening, there was no foul smell and the taste was the same, it was highly unlikely that it was spoilt!

I checked the packet of butter, maybe I had brought the wrong brand or maybe a different variety in haste, maybe it was some newly launched product that turned red to appeal to kids or whatever marketing brands do these days but it was my usual packet of butter, the ingredients were the same too!

So I thought something was wrong with my pan, perhaps it wasn't washed well, I scrubbed away all the grease on the pan and decided to go to work without having breakfast, I wasn't in the mood to cook again.

The whole day my mind was preoccupied with the red butter, it refused to leave my mind, this was the first time I was experiencing something like this and even though I felt foolish for searching it, I searched the whole internet for 'demonic butter' and 'red butter', but nothing satisfying turned up.

I thought maybe it was a one time incident until it happened again during dinner, this time it even smelled foul and it was thicker and a darker shade of red but the butter in the packet looked, smelled and tasted as usual, I washed the pan again but as soon as the butter would melt it would turn into as deep shade of red, it looked as if I was melting blood in the pan.

And although my mind warned me to not taste it, I couldn't control myself from tasting it, it had a strong metallic taste to it, as if I was sucking blood, the taste was so horrible that I spat it out and immediately rinsed my mouth!

I threw the packet of butter in the dustbin and even though I wanted to complain to the company, I decided against it because I knew I would look mad if I complained about something as absurd as this!

I decided to use a different brand and brushed the whole incident off as a nightmare. The next day, I went and brought another brand of butter, I didn't like the change but it was a hard choice that I had to make but as soon as I melted it in the pan, it turned red, I even went as far as using a different pan but it stayed as red as blood!

This time the smell was way more foul than anything I could tolerate, my eyes began to water because of the stench, it felt as if a decaying animal was in my house!

I tossed the butter and even the pan along with it in the dustbin, no matter how much I scrubbed it, the red grease stuck to it and the smell was so foul, no amount of cleaning could make it go away!

That whole week I was terrified, I didn't feel like eating or cooking anything, I don't want to seem like a coward and I hate to admit it but I had nightmares because of that red butter!

It took a lot of convincing to buy a packet of butter again and I really missed it's taste, everything seemed dull without it, so I brought a different brand this time, hoping it functioned just like normal butter, my hands trembled as I unwrapped it and dropped it into the pan, I prayed it would melt as usual and my prayers seemed to have an effect until,

It turned light red from yellow and then took a darker shade of red before drying off, leaving red crusts on the pan, even though I turned off the gas immediately, the butter had all dried off, my pan seemed like it was coated in blood, the sight was so horrifying, I nearly screamed.

I checked the packet of butter in panic and to my horror, it was a dark shade of red like deoxygenated blood and it smelled like decaying flesh!, l immediately threw it in the trash and washed my hands over and over again but the smell stayed for over a week, I was so embarrassed and shaken that I took a week off from work.

That was the last time I brought butter, I have begun to hate it so much that the mention of the word 'butter' is enough to disgust me and I don't think I will cook anything or even eat anything that has butter in it [again](https://www.reddit.com/r/t5_aqhpns/s/fNPM2SA55e)!
