I had never been very acceptant of the idea of an HOA. I hated them. Owning something like a house, and not being able to customize it, getting in trouble for having long grass, a horrid idea. But it was the cheapest house in the best neighborhood I could find. I wasn’t broke, but I also wasn’t rich, so I was trying to find a nice middle ground house. $127,000 for a 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom house was an amazing deal, however it came with a $87 monthly HOA fee. 

I was fine with it, was even looking forward to it, finally moving out of the apartment I had been living in most of college. I worked as an architect, it payed ok, the firm I worked in did decent, and I got to design some interesting things. 

I was 6’2, about 167 pounds and 27 years, with sand blonde hair and bright green hazel eyes. Single (hopefully not for long), and decently friendly. I think I got along nicely with the HOA board, because I looked well put together. The board itself was mainly a bunch of well off 80 something’s that told me what was and wasn’t allowed. 

“Keep these dang sidewalks clean, mow your lawn only on Saturday’s, don’t be loud after 9, and make sure anything, and I mean anything, additionally built, changed, or different, is approved and in line with the HOA.”

Basic things I guess, I had never been in an HOA so I didn’t know how strict or not strict this was. I noticed quickly that every house looked the exact same. From the weathering, the colors, every house with a shed had it in the exact same spot, or at least from what I saw they were the same. The fences were all brown wood, about 5 feet tall, you could see over them. I didn’t think this was the type of place any nonconformism would be looked upon kindly.

I got house number 602, on birch street. It seemed all the streets were named after wood of some kind. Once I had finished moving in, i had heard a knock on the door.

“Hiiii neighboooorrr” said an older woman. She was holding a basket filled with what looked like cheep Walmart bluebell cheese and some gift cards. She smelled like old lasagna, and she looked like she could be on the HOA board itself.

“I brought you a welcome basket! To welcome you to our WONDROUS neighborhood!” She exclaimed. 
“My name is Miss Pamela, but you can call me Pam. Here! Take the basket!” 
As I grabbed the basket she patted my shoulder and let herself in. I didn’t stop her, I was a little confused as to what was happening anyway. 

“Hi Miss Pamela, Pam I mean, I’m Jacob, thank you for the basket! But I have some unpacking and things I’m trying to get to and I just -“ she cut me off. 

“I’m not here to socialize all that much either, I just came to warn you.” She glanced around, her face seemed calm, but there was a tinge of something, maybe anger? 
“Do not try to be different. Don’t try to do your own thing, the HOA will hate you for it. I know what you’re thinking, and I’d like to tell you, I was a young girl once, now I know better. Don’t try to step out of line.” she patted my shoulder again, and went to leave. 

“Thank you Pam, but you don’t have to worry about me.” I said

“We’ll see then Jacob.” And she left.

After the encounter with Pam, I sat the basket in the fridge, and took out the coupons that were in it. It was random coupons, Brahms, Kroger’s, some gas stations, nothing special.

As I was bringing things in, I slammed the corner of a table into the front door. It left behind a long streak and dent, definitely noticeable. I didn’t even think I hit it that hard, but it was most definitely noticeable. I was going to have to fix it quick, and I was pretty much done unpacking, so I decided to go find a local hardware store. I decided to grab some of those coupons that Pam gave me, and noticed one for “Handy Hams Hardware”, 30% off a pint of paint. “Perfect” I exclaimed. I would have to thank Pam later, and maybe bring her some of the cheese back. 

As I pulled up to “Handy Hams Hardware” I noticed that there was only one car in the parking lot. I entered, heard a door chime, and quickly saw the paint and wood filler. I grabbed what looked like the closest to the door, an off eggshell white, and assumed that once it dried it would be unnoticeable. As I was handing the coupon to the cashier, the only person in the store, he looked up at me. Again, as everyone I’ve seen, an old man.

“Boy, that’s an HOA coupon, you better have approval before making changes to your house!” He said, his voice raspy.

“I’m just fixing a hole, I’ll talk to the HOA, but  I’m sure I’ll be fine.” I responded, paying with my card.

“Be sure to make sure you have approval on the hole as well, they’re more strict than they seem” he said and handed me my receipt.

Confused on why I had to get approval for an accident, I drove home. Pam, and two other old people were at my door, staring and grumbling at it. 

“Jacob, why don’t you explain yourself.” Pam said, she was angry.

“I hit the door with a table leg on accident, and just got the items to repair it.” I said, I don’t understand why they cared so much. 

“So you’re going to make 2 unregistered changes to your house?” The  taller dude next to Pam said.

“Im not making any unregistered changes, I’m just repairing it.” I said.

“No son, you have changed this door without permission, it’s very obvious.” The shorter dude said.

“It wasn’t a purposeful change it was clearly  an accident.” I said, a little annoyed.

“This isn’t an argument boy, you will be fined. You should have checked with us first.” The tall jerk explained.

“What the heck are you talking about? Being fined for what? It wasn’t literally an accident!” I proclaimed.

“Argue it with the collector, I’d suggest you don’t mess it up anymore.” Pam said, and they walked off.

This upset me greatly. I hadn’t even been here three days and I already had to pay an HOA fine. 

I decided to go inside and watch tv. I wasn’t gonna go fix the door after what happened, and I wanted to get my Xbox hooked up. 

At around 8, I heard knocking on the door. I went to go open it and it was the most average, middle aged man I’ve ever seen. When you think of office worker, this is exactly what your mind goes to, it was a little odd how average he looked. 

“So I see that you made an unapproved alteration to your home, and that does come with a fine.” He said, with a very very monotone voice. He almost sounded like he had no accent whatsoever, it was odd. I thought I was just being rude, maybe this was what every HOA payment collector was like. 

“It was not a purposeful change. It was an accident.” I said, hoping he understood. 

“I understand, but it still depreciates the value of the home, and that will cause the neighborhood to depreciate a little, and that will throw off all of the balance we have going on, you wouldn’t want to ruin our balance would you?” He asked. I couldn’t tell if he’s frowning or smiling, it was creeping me out. 

“Of course not.” I asked, I was tired of this and was hoping paying the fine would be quick and easy. “How much is the fine?” 

“60.” He said quickly. That wasn’t horrible. I went to go grab my wallet when he said I wouldn’t need it.

“How else would I pay it?” I asked.

He grabbed my arm. His hands were both warm and cold at the same time. It hurt. I felt the muscle in my arm weaken. My joints felt swollen. I wrenched back.

I screamed “THAT HURT WHAT WAS THAT!” I yelled. Something felt incredibly wrong. His face seemed younger, he seemed to have emotion, he seemed happier. 

“Your fine must be payed.” He said as he reached forward. 

I darted back quickly. I closed the door on him. I latched the locks, he started knocking. 

“What are you? What in gods name are you?” I said, exasperated.

“I am the head of the HOA, I am the fine collector. You must pay your fine.” He said, as I heard what sounded like mashed potato’s being stirred, the lock began to shift.

“HEY, YOU DONT HAVE PERMISSION TO ENTER.” I yelled.

“I don’t need permission, I am the head of the HOA. It was in your contract. I can enter and leave as I please.” He said.

What came through the door looked nothing like the man that was earlier. A heap of sagging flesh and the strong smell of old lasagna. His hand was mangled, the shape of a key. The other hand looked like a deflated basketball, malformed and squishy. 

I screamed. 

“You must pay your fine, you must.” The thing said. I was running to hide in the bathroom when I tripped on the cord leading from the Xbox, to a controller I was charging. I hit my head on the wall. The HOA head quickly came over to me and placed his fleshy paw on my shoulder. I felt my muscles ache and groan. My joints swell, I saw my somewhat long hair turn grey in the corner of my eye. My vision blurred a bit. My bones shifted, and my head spun. 

“Thank you, please make sure to come to the HOA board for approval of any changes next time. The fee will increase.” It said, now in the shape of a slightly younger man. I sat crying for hours, confused. I could barely walk. My teeth fell out. I was so hungry. I tried to eat some steak, cooking it hurt every joint, but I couldn’t chew it. I remembered the cheeses, I ate them all. I was going to have to quit my job. How would I explain this to my boss? I figured I’d do it later as I was very tired. I just hoped everyone listened to the HOA. I would hate for this to happen to someone else.
