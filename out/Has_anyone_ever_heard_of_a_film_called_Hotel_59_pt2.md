Hello nosleep. I have still not found anything on the film and I assume you haven’t either. The words on that note have kept me awake for nights on end. Who sent the note and who knows I have the film? Before we go any further I want to come clean to you all. No more jokes no more lies.

My wife left our family when Zach was only one. She never wanted a child. Once she found out she was pregnant with our son she despised him. One day she couldn’t take it anymore and packed her things. But before we start I want to explain myself to you all. I understand I should’ve done more research before I showed him the film, but I was desperate. I just wanted Zach to know that I listen and I care. I watched horror movies when I was his age so I thought it was fine. As I popped the DVD back in, I couldn’t have been more wrong.

After much contemplation of the notes words, I finally decided to watch the rest of the film. I made sure my door was locked and that Zach was asleep. I got the remote to turn the volume down so whatever sounds from this ungodly movie wouldn’t wake him up. I pressed play on the remote and it picked up right where it left off.

The man in latex with the tube tapped to his mouth was still screaming as whatever liquid was pouring down that tube. His screams started to become more muffled as the liquid was filling his lungs. The screams became quieter and quieter . After about 4 mins he had drowned in whatever was being poured down the tube. A body that once was squirming in agony, sat motionless in the chair. 

You would think that it would end there but it kept rolling. The liquid continued to poor down the tube. As I kept watching, the body started to inflate. The latex started to expand as the man’s stomach started to bulge. The liquid didn’t stop pouring for almost 6 mins. Then the vacuum sound came to a halt. The liquid stopped pouring and the man’s stomach was the size of a beanbag chair. I sat in disbelief of what I had witnessed. Was the just a movie, or something else entirely.

The film was not over. A figure wearing a hoodie came into frame and circled the motionless body. He squatted down beside the latex man and started playing the drums on his stomach. The hooded figure laid his head on the man’s stomach. He laid their for a while, maybe two minutes or so. During that time he reached for something out of frame. I tried to get a look at the hooded figure but the room wasn’t lit well and the hood covered to top part of face. My examination was interrupted when I saw what he was reaching for.

He pulled what looked like switchblade and started rubbing it on the latex man. What I saw next was almost to much for me to bare. The hooded figure started slashing at his victim as what I assume to be water started pouring out of his wounds. I couldn’t tell exactly what the liquid was since it was mixed in with man’s blood. The latex man slowly started to deflate as the hooded figure started clapping with enjoyment at what he had done. The victim deflated back to his original body shape. 

I’ve seen horror movies before and none have been like this. Who makes a movie about torturing someone for 30 minutes. This didn’t feel right. I took the DVD out and put it back in it’s case. I was gonna take it back to the store first thing in the morning.

It was about 2 am in the morning. I couldn’t sleep after what I had witnessed. “Who would make that, why leave a note?” After a while I got up to get some beer to ease my mind. I started heading down the stairs until I saw a light coming from the living room. I continued my way down the stairs and then I heard it. Those awful muffled screams. Zach was watching the film.

I ran over to the remote to turn it off before it got any worse. 

“What the hell are you doing Zach! I thought I made it pretty clear I didn’t want you watching this!” 

“All my other friends get to watch stuff like this so why can’t I?” 

“You know exactly why. Now get upstairs and don’t say another word about this film. Do you understand me!”

He ran up the stairs while stomping his feet. I didn’t care if he was mad I wasn’t going to let him finish that film. Morning came around and I was trying to get Zach ready for school. He was still mad at me but I could live with it, if it meant I kept him from being scarred. He walked to the bus and headed to school. I myself needed to get ready for work. I would worry about returning the film after I got off. 

As I got in my car I placed the film on my passenger seat and drove my way to work. When I arrived, my buddy Alan saw the film and said  “ Ya known if you wanted to watch pornos there is a thing called the internet. You can save yourself the embarrassment of renting one.” I chuckled and explained what had happened as we headed into work. The work day was pretty normal nothing to really report about.

My shift ended and I made my way back to the car. As I was sitting down I looked over to see if the film was still there. My eyes widened and mouth dropped. A film was there, but not the one I had rented. I slowly picked up the case to see the title.
