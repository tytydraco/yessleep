Hi, I’m Kara. Um, well - I need help. I need to know if anybody else has ever experienced something like this before, and if so is it curable? My friend Peri told me that this reddit might be a good place to try and find anyone else going through this, because I can’t find anything on google, or any of the other search engines I tried for that matter. 

So, I’m still in school. I live in a small town in England, in the Uk. I can’t give more details than that, because my mum always made internet safety very clear, and my school year has about 10 of us - and I’d rather not be worried about being doxxed on top of all this mess. For ease of reading (and mostly for ease of writing and then using a search and replace tool) I’ll call my town Town. 

I go to school here in Town. It’s one school for everyone who lives here, ages 5-18. They call it Town Tertiary - I assume inspired by the concept of primary and secondary schools. Over the past two months I and my classmates have been doing our GCSEs. 

GCSEs are very important here. Most people who live in Town hope to one day leave. It’s nice here (or at least it was) but we dream of something bigger, a place where there might even be triple digits of people within 20 years of you. And the exams are key, with good grades you can get a well-paid job somewhere bigger than Town. 

I’m rambling. I know I am, and I’m sorry. I always get like this when I’m nervous and these past week and a half have been like living in a nightmare. I think part of me hopes that if I don’t mention it then it might not have happened? That everything is fine and I’ll get to live a long and happy life in a big city, returning to Town to visit family for holidays. Unfortunately, pretending something didn’t happen doesn’t make me any less aware of the pain on my leg, or the knowledge of what happened. 

So, exams. To further emphasise how important exams are here in Town, I don’t know a singular person who hasn’t had nightmares, whether missing exams or failing exams or both. 

I had prepared, set about twenty different exams, asked my mum to set another five or so. I was not going to miss my English exam, my final one. I had got every other one and I had no intention of ruining this streak at the final hurdle. 

Despite how much we had prepared, I ended up being late anyway. My teacher - who only now I’m writing this down do I realise I don’t think she ever told us her name - she gave me the wrong time. Because screw me I guess? Everyone else got the correct time, but clearly whatever gods that guard Town didn’t especially want me to leave. 

I’m rambling again, talking nonsense to try and pretend this is a normal standard thing or perhaps a dream that if I just close my eyes I’ll magically wake up and all will be normal. 

Anyway, I was late to my final English exam. Because I was late, they didn’t want to let me into the exam hall. So, instead they decided to get one of the tables and one of the invigilators and set up a table under a tree. I’m still not sure why this was even allowed, the reason they tend to have rules and timings is moreso to prevent online cheating. My theory is that they just don’t think Town has internet? We do, but I definitely didn’t try to cheat, so I am glad I was allowed to take it - even if I now wish they had told me to just go home and I got a zero. 

Okay, I need to stop putting this off. I mean, how are you meant to know if it’s similar if I’m too scared to even say what it is! So, I was sitting under this tree, looking through the exam booklet to know what all the questions are before I start answering. And then I felt this sharp pain in my leg (which is hurting again now because apparently remembering it makes it hurt again), it felt painful and numb at the same time, as if the pain was so high it had looped around to negative numbers. It was like being stabbed, but as if the pain was radiating outwards? I’m not sure how to explain this to someone who hasn’t felt it. 

When I looked at my leg there was a large red patch - a giant mark that looked almost like a spot or a blister but larger - and an almost-circle like formation waving out across my skin. It seemed more like a living creature just under the surface of my skin than any kind of rash. 

And - well, I don’t know how to explain this in a non-disgusting way, but I’ll try to keep it brief. Peri said this might be a way to find answers but only if I tell the truth. So, I see this weird thing on my leg, when the outer ring begins to stabilise, staying still - I think it was a patch about the size of my hand. But then these strange lines started to link the two! An almost spider web of raised lines across my skin. 

It feels important to me to mention that in writing this out it’s now a day later. I know that it’s all one post, but I think it’s a cry for help of sorts - a plea to the universe or the internet to fix this problem. 

Back to a week and a half ago, still creepy - it was like some sort of jelly was falling out of my skin, though I think it was my skin. Some weird blended skin and blood and muscle. I would like to emphasise here that it hurt. A lot. An incredible amount. And the invigilator proceeded to get mad at me for screaming in pain - claiming that you need to be quiet during exams. Which, sure, I understand but perhaps considering I was the only one out here and perhaps considering what was happening to my leg, that perhaps sympathy would have been nice. 

The first aid team didn’t seem to know what to do with me, instead calling my mum. She got quite annoyed at them - apparently spotting something embedded in my leg? We still don’t know what it was, because the moment they managed to pull it out, it disintegrated!

Getting rid of the strange thing embedded in my leg solved one problem - the strange jelly falling out and the growth around the edges. 

It doesn’t seem to be getting better, theoretically dooming me to a life of forever having a bandaged leg covering an open wound. But that would be one thing. The problem is I woke up this morning and it’s grown again - sticking outside of the bandages along my leg. And the far bigger problem, it seems to be growing on my shoulder too. 

I don’t want to leave Town anymore, don’t have any ambitions of the big cities. All I want is to find some way of not losing my skin or my soul. 

If anyone has any leads, knows of any diseases or curses that could lead to this please let me know. I’m not sure how long I have of being able to try and find a cure. It doesn’t seem to spread using any kind of pattern and I can’t tell if it would be a blessing or a curse for it to destroy my brain next.
