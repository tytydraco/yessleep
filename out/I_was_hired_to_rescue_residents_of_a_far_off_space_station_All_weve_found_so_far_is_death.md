“Alright folks, time to sit tight and listen We’re due to arrive in half an hour and there’s a lot to brief.” Jepsen was shouting from the front of the cabin, bringing all of our attention forward. “There’s food and water over by the wall, if you’re hungry, eat now.”

I still felt like I was going to puke after waking up from hypersleep, unsure of where I was and groggy as all hell. There was no way I was going to eat right now, with everything in me needed just to keep my attention on Jepsen. 

“You’re all here because your skills earned you a spot. I know the big shots told you that taking this mission is like getting the goddamn Golden Ticket to tickle Wonka’s balls. I’m going to tell you that they offered that for a reason- most of you ain’t gonna see it. We don’t know what the hell we’re walking into up here, and for every single one of you to survive, I need you to be on your shit like never before.” Jepsen was already laying in, spit flying from his lips as he shouted for all of us to hear. I scanned the cabin, counting ten of us total, all suited up with armaments standing by. 

Look, I’m not usually one to come out of retirement, but when they approached me a few weeks ago, offering what Jepsen said, essentially, I couldn’t say no. Sure I was pretty successful in the freelance market when it comes to security these days, but considering how much shit I have on Uncle Sam, I had figured they would have paid me enough to ensure my silence by now. Guess all it took was the right people needing my skills, along with these other saps in here. All of us definitely fit a stereotype- male, older, obvious military background, and a majority of us with scars to show for it.

“Now, I imagine before a few days ago none of you knew space travel like this existed. Star Trek shit, but that’s just the start of what you’re going to find. We’re currently en route to a space station known as the Styx Outpost. This place is where the elite of the elite live, safe with all their money and away from the troubles and worries back on Earth. Outpost Styx is the size of a small skyscraper and has all the amenities anyone could need to live for hundreds of years. These people are the ones who you don’t even hear about because they’re rich enough to make it happen, got it? All told, with staff and ancillary engineers for the station, there are around two hundred people living in this place.”

A man leaning against the wall to my right raised his hand up, inquiring. Jepsen nodded toward him before he asked his question, “All due respect sir, these people should have some damn fine security up there already with that kind of money.”

Jepsen actually laughed at that, nodding as he did, “They sure did. That’s why you’re getting offered such a stupid fucking reward. As of about six months ago, all communication with anyone up here went totally dark. No signs of life since, and no precursor of any kind to tell us what may be happening. They sent one final message before everything went dark and it means fuck all for all I can figure out. Just one message- ‘Don’t acknowledge them’. Figure out what that means and you win the big prize I guess.”

”So aliens got the rich bastards?” Another of the guys said with a laugh, getting a rise out of the rest of us with it. 

“That’s the thing, we don’t know. A supply ship came up a couple months back for a scheduled delivery. No word from them since. Everything that comes up here ends up going radio silent the moment they step onto that outpost.” Jepsen mentioned, continuing on. “Now, considering our surroundings, we can’t go in here with regular munitions. You’ve been issues a new prototype gun, shoots out small electric bursts that are enough to paralyze most humans on contact. Use it wisely or-“

He was cut off by someone from the cockpit, a nervous voice cackling over the loudspeaker, “You guys uh… might want to see this. Sorry to interrupt, Jepsen… it’s important.”

Shutters on the window to my right began to open, revealing the empty void separated from us by thick plastic made to withstand a total lack of atmosphere. Far in the distance, the sun was blazing, providing heat and light to an entire solar system. All I could think about was sitting up in a nice cabin back on earth, wasting my days away in quiet where all this could never find me again. Soon, I hope… 

Breath caught in my throat as the problem quickly floated past our window. A girl, probably no older than fifteen, floating aimlessly through the cosmos, at the mercy of whatever force pushed her out into the cold empty. Here eyes stared lifelessly ahead, a permanent state of panic frozen into them by whatever brought her here. 

“Jesus, alright.” Jepsen swore. Beyond our ship, in the direction the girl was floating from, a small, sleek looking structure was floating in orbit. Styx loomed, not a single sign of life stirring through the massive windows hiding its inhabitants. Jepsen spoke up once more, “All told, we’re here to find out what the hell happened, rescue any survivors, and get the hell back home. Understood, folks?”

Everyone sort of murmured in agreement, all of us still transfixed on the girl floating past us in space. It was so eerie, floating by at a relatively fast speed yet everything about her was still, not a single strand of hair waving as she glided by, ghostlike in the raw sunlight filtering by. A shiver ran down my spine before pulling a victory lap and coming back up, making me visibly shake and draw the laughter of the men around me. 

“There’s more…” The voice came over the radio again as the rest of us looked further from the body floating by, toward Styx looming in the background. It was hard to distinguish them against the vast darkness of space behind, but eventually I counted out around ten or eleven bodies floating through space, all orbiting around the Styx like they were waiting to be let in. 

“Well, that’s just fucking creepy.” A soldier next to me, big guy with some of the worst brown hair dye I’ve ever seen, was whispering. I grunted in agreement as the pilot began giving us instructions for offboarding. I zoned out, just filing in behind the other guys to exit through the airlock when we connected. The bolt-rifle they gave us was light, almost too light. I felt like I was walking into some unknown hell armed with a damned Nerf gun.

”Alright, gentlemen.” Jepsen continued again, looking all of us in the eye as he stood in front of the airlock. “If you see anything suspicious, alert the others. Do not react in any way to draw attention. We’re not sure what happened up here, but those bodies outside aren’t a sign of welcome. Get back here alive.”

”Sir.” The ten of us said in unison, programming kicking in from the old days. This was nothing like the deserts of the Middle East, thank god, but at this point a little warm sun would be a blessing…

A loud hiss drove me back to the present, the hatch before us opening to a brightly lit hallway. White paneling was almost blinding, the LED lights above flickering off it and almost immediately giving me a headache from the buzz. Only the first couple of segments of the hall were lit though, with everything beyond it swallowed by darkness the further in it went. All of us took a moment, making peace with whatever we believed in, and stepped in. 

Don’t think I’ve ever felt a stillness like I do here. Everything was quiet, but… not peaceful. There was discord, like when you know that the absence of any sound means trouble, like someone’s trying not to get caught doing something bad. My stomach is already turning, knowing we’re in way over our heads before we even get ten feet into this damn place. No choice, though. Got to keep moving. 

We keep pace down the hallway, turning on flashlights as the station gives way to darkness. Before long though we’re introduced to a central atrium, like one huge towns square practically that everything branches off from in here. I could see signs for small businesses, restaurants, shopping, another sign that pointed towards a spa area, entertainment, and yet another that had ‘Lodging/Admin’ written on it in big letters, each with their own little hallway that split off. Dividing each path was a huge window, floor to ceiling, revealing the full majesty of space in every direction. Jepsen signaled for everyone to fan out, looking for any sign of what could be going on here.

It only took moments for everyone to find some sign of violence. Dried, brown blood spatters were all over the place, whether covering windows or decorating furniture around us. The occasional body part was littered on the floor, though not in any discernible shape at this point. The smell was the worst part though, permeating everything like we were in death’s shroud. All of us could feel the shadow of the reaper pressing down from above, telling us there was no way out. Almost gagged when I passed by a couch just to find a body on it, eyes torn from sockets as it lay there, hands still clawing to try and stop seeing whatever was there.

A scream came tearing through the entertainment wing, turning all of us to ice sculptures as it pierced our ears. All of us just looked at each other, unsure what to think of the noise. It sounded vaguely female, but the amount of rage and grief that was in it… I’ve heard that in a few places, usually surrounded by the sounds of bombs and gunfire, and it’s never a good thing.

Jepsen gave the signal, all of us following him down the entertainment wing at a brisk pace, trying to keep as quiet as possible while still getting there to find any sign of whatever that was. We only got more questions upon reaching the entertainment center though.

A door to our right was swinging, open and closed on squeaky hinges. Jepsen went to it first, putting a foot in the way before slowly stepping through the door, catching and stepping back as soon as he spotted what was inside. A moment later I understood why, catching a stench that I had learned all too much about in my time on the front lines. There was death in that room.

”Get out! Get out! Get out!” A voice was whispering loudly from behind us. I turn in time to see a younger man, probably in his mid-20s, starting to get louder as he shouts. “You’re going to bring them back! They just finally left me alone! Get OUT!”

He was ranting and raving as one of the soldiers began to approach him, raising a hand to try and get him to calm down at least the tiniest bit. All of us gripped our guns a little tighter as he stopped suddenly, eyes darting between us and something up above, seemingly hidden in the air ducts.

”Damned idiots. Bunch of damned idiots… it came back… ” Only seconds passed before he was torn apart before our eyes, seemingly from the inside. I saw his jaw pulled down by nothing, ripped right from his skull with tendons tearing as it stretched. Blood spewed as his screams grew louder, making all of us run cold. A couple of guys raised their guns to him, though Jepsen held a hand out to stop them. Seconds. While his jaw was being pulled off he was being stretched in every direction, like some fucked up zombie movie where they just pull at the body until everyone gets their meal, until he was dead.

”The hell did that?” A soldier whispered. The rest of us were thinking the same thing, but Jepsen made the call then and there to move everyone out, motioning us back to the door we came through, all the way to the center of the station. 

“There’s about ten bodies right inside that doorway in the same situation.” Jepsen mentioned as we walked, motioning back to the door that was still swinging ominously. “Anything that can do that is already high on our list of what not to fuck with, but I didn’t see anything. Did any of you?”

All of us responded with a negative. 

“Like the wind ripped him to shreds.” Another guy mumbled.

”Looked like ghosts killin’ him.” A man to my right this time.

We were passing by a window when one of them stopped, looking outside at the void waiting to swallow us. It’s like the darkness outside was waiting for us to slip up, make one wrong move so it could come in to prey. There were more bodies floating around out there, damned to orbit the station forever thanks to whatever threw them out there. The soldier who stopped was staring intently out into the distance, squinting against the dark outside to try for a better look at something.

”You guys see those bodies, right?” He mentioned as I almost bumped into him. “That one out there, think it’s wearing purple… I saw it wave.”

”Probably just the wind, dipshit. Let’s get out of here.” A guy to my left named Stentz spat, muscling by.

”There’s no wind in space, dipshit.” Mullins from up ahead, an older, greying man who was missing a couple of fingers. “C’mon kid, ain’t nobody out there gonna wave at you for any good reason.”

”No, it’s waving.” The guy at the window continued. He stepped closer to the window, almost pressing his hands against the glass and focusing in on one body in particular, way out in the distance. I followed his line of site, not quite following for a moment before movement became obvious. There was a woman out there floating through space, hair splayed out and frozen in the lack of gravity, and she was smiling at us. I could barely tell, but the shadows playing off her face from the distant sun and space debris made it look like a sinister grin. 

The bigger problem though, as he had noticed, was that it was waving at us. There was nothing out there in the empty to cause her movement, no way in hell that she was still alive out there, only wearing shorts and a t-shirt in the void of infinite space, but her right arm was pivoting at the elbow while her hand flapped crazily, waving right at us. 

I froze, desperately willing myself to stop seeing it. There was just darkness where her eyes should be, only teeth showing through the sinister grin to give her any defining features. All I could do was back up a step, desperately moving forward without looking back at it, trying to get Jepsen to come take a look.

”Jepsen, Jepsen there’s something out there.” I mentioned, pointing back to where the other soldier was still at the window. I see him raise a hand, feeling my stomach sink as I back away. He starts shouting.

”Hey, she’s alive! There’s someone alive out there!” He waves back to the woman, motioning at her to come closer. “Hey! Can you hear me! We’ll get you back in here!”

From where I am in the hallway I can see her, right outside the window now. There’s no way anything human could close the gap between where she was and right outside that fast, much less while orbiting in space. That was the least concern now though, because he’s still furiously waving, now banging on the window and shouting at her that we’ll get her help.

She reaches through the thick glass of the window like there’s nothing there, grabbing on tight to him in an embrace. He looks pretty surprised, but only has moments to feel it before she takes hold, pulling him back out through the solid window to be with her. As soon as she was there, she’s gone, leaving him partially floating outside the window as the bottom half of his body slides to the ground on our side, severed by the solid wall between. A couple of guys around him start pounding on the window, trying to find a way to get him back in, but it’s hopeless. The blood coming from his severed torso is boiling as it hits the vacuum of space, with irreparable damage already wreaking havoc on his lungs and inner organs. Every bit of water in his body is boiling into evaporation all at once, with the more exposed organs going quickly first. There’s barely time to register the fear in his eyes before they bubble away, sizzling silently in the void as they record their final images into his brain, soon to join them on the outside.

”STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO THEM!” A voice cuts over a loud speaker above us, giving a hard jolt to everyone after the horror we just witnessed. “If you acknowledge them, you’re going to die.”

“And who the hell are you?” Stentz started shouting at the ceiling, hefting his gun like he was going to start firing on nothing.

”Someone who’s survived here longer than you.” The voice answered back. “Come meet me in Admin and I’ll tell you what happened here. Don’t pay them any mind on your [way](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/vLtCAqXa14).”
