I don’t know who still drives past the old school off Davis Mill Road. If you’ve seen it lately, the one with boarded-up windows and a short stretch of chain-link fencing across the front, you probably thought the same thing I did. It should have been torn down years ago.

But it wasn’t. And now I think I know why.

I moved to Pleasant Garden in 2021 after spending some time in Elon. I wanted quiet, space. I found it in a small house just south of town, tucked among trees and backroads. Most early mornings, I ride my e-bike around the area. It helps me think. I usually loop past a stretch of woods, then cut back along Davis Mill.

That’s where the school sits. Not far from the road at all. You can see it clearly between the trees. The building isn’t hidden, just neglected. The overgrowth is there, but not heavy. Ivy on some corners, a few bushes creeping up the walls. Mostly it's just still. Empty in a way that feels intentional.

There’s a short line of chain-link fence along the front, with a weathered “Private Property” sign zip-tied to the gate. The fence doesn’t even wrap around the property. Just one length facing the road, like a gesture someone made because they had to. A laughable attempt to keep people honest.

Locals barely mention the place. Someone once told me it closed in 1987. No big scandal. Just a school that got consolidated and left behind. No renovation. No repurpose. Just forgotten.

Then in late 2023, a For Sale sign appeared.

It looked unofficial, weather-warped. The flyer stapled to it was already curling at the edges, showing a grainy black-and-white photo of the building from a low angle. There was no price, no company name. Just a phone number.

A week later, I rode past again. This time, the gate in the fence was open.

Not broken or busted. Just open, like someone wanted it that way.

I stopped. I wasn’t planning to go in. I just wanted to get a closer look. I leaned my bike against an electric pole nearby and stepped through the gate.

The front doors were long gone. Inside, the air was stale and cool, with that dense chemical smell old buildings seem to trap. Dust clung to everything. Some parts of the ceiling had come down. Lockers lined the walls, marked with graffiti. Light filtered through cracks in the boards over the windows.

I followed a hallway that led to a small office at the front corner of the building. The door was half-open. I pushed it the rest of the way.

There was a desk, a chair, some cabinets with open drawers. But what struck me was the chair.

It didn’t have a speck of dust on it.

Everything else in the room was coated. The floor, the desktop, even the knobs on the drawers. But the seat cushion looked clean. Fresh. As if someone had just stood up.

In the center of the desk was a Polaroid photograph, facedown.

I picked it up.

On the back, in blocky blue ink, someone had written: Do Not Forget Her.

I turned it over.

A young girl stood in front of a chalkboard. She looked maybe seven. She wore a plain blue dress. Her hands were folded in front of her. Her expression was unreadable, not sad, not scared, just distant.

Her eyes weren’t looking at the camera. They were locked onto something behind it.

Then I heard the sound of a doorknob turning behind me.

Slow. Deliberate.

There was no working door back there. No reason for that sound.

I left.

I walked quickly back through the hallway, past the lockers, out the entryway, and through the gate. I got on my bike and rode home without stopping.

Since then, I’ve ridden past that school dozens of times. The gate hasn’t been open again.

But on more than one occasion, I’ve seen something I can’t explain.

In the window near that same corner office, a light was on. Just faint enough to question whether I really saw it. But it was there. Always the same spot. Still on at the early hours of the morning, like somebody just spent an all-nighter.

I haven’t gone back inside.

I don’t think I need to.

I still see the girl’s face in my head.

And I still remember what it said on the back of that photograph. Do Not Forget Her.
