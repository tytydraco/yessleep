I was cynical. I thought you would all forget about me. And maybe some of you *have* forgotten me—maybe *all* of you have forgotten me, except for one person.

*Hey. Is your story real?*

That was the message I received from a Redditor who shall remain anonymous. I huffily told him that: yes, my story is real, *thank you very much*. I didn’t understand why anybody would lie about such a thing. Maybe I’d been living in a London Underground station too long—under that proverbial rock. That was certainly what the Redditor implied.

He said, *People lie about all kinds of things. Are you new to the internet? Lol.*

*I’ve been imprisoned in a train station for 15 years with nothing but a string of smartphones to keep me company. What do you think?* I snarkily replied.

*Okay, I’m sorry*, he messaged. *In fairness, I was just thinking that you’ve missed a lot above the surface. The world’s quite different now. So, you’ve really been trapped down there since 2010?*

*Yes, I really have*, I replied.

*Well, then I guess I’d better tell you something that you might help you*, he said.

*I’m not sure whether I’ll believe it, this being the internet and all. You know, the home of lies*, I sassily messaged.

*Okay, I deserve that*, he admitted. *Look, take my story or leave it, but your tale is reminiscent of something that happened to me in India, when I worked for Doctors Across Borders. I found myself trapped in a remote village. None of us were able to step more than ten feet beyond the outer border of the town. And we learnt, much like you, that we weren’t alone.*

*I still don’t know how to describe what I saw and heard—mostly just a shadow against the walls of buildings. It hid well, only ever attacking at night. I’m not sure where it went during the day. But we came to realise that this thing hunted like a spider. It had caught us in its web, and it planned to devour us. People disappeared, one by one. The cattle too. Nearly every living thing was devoured by this creature.*

*Now, here’s my hypothesis, and I’ll explain it. This creature was never trying to trap you—it was only ever trying to trap Peter. You were unwittingly caught in its web. Who knows how or why? All we know is that the creature clearly doesn’t see you, or you would’ve died on that first night too.*

*That’s how you’ve lived for so long right under its nose. You were never meant to be stuck there. The trap was laid for Peter, and it worked, but this creature must sense you—the unexpected anomaly. That would explain why it still prowls the station’s corridors.*

*Let me explain. See, the villagers and I survived our encounter in India through sheer luck. Only one creature in that village was spared. We saw it happen, as we watched from our hiding spot in a barn. The beast, a long shadow snaking through the streets, devoured some poor, fleeing residents, a cow, a cat, and anything else in its way—anything and everything except for the Great Indian Bustard. It’s a bird prevalent to that region. Anyway, this Bustard stood dumbly and blissfully at the side of the street, but the snaking, shadowy creature slithered straight past it. It completely avoided the bird.*

*Now, we knew that it could’ve been a fluke, but we were desperate. We had to believe that this beast didn’t see the Bustard—we had to believe that it could see only the things it wanted to consume.*

*The very next night, we had an idea. We captured a poor Bustard, and we laid a trap; we bound the bird, with a piece of rope, to one of the surviving chickens, and we set the pair in the middle of the street. Then we waited and watched late at night.*

*And sure enough, in a horrifying display, the beast came again that night. It devoured the chicken, but it also unknowingly devoured the Great Indian Bustard. And then, in a terrible display of roars and writhing, the beast choked and died. It just liquefied into a wretched puddle.*

*So, you see my point, don’t you?*

I replied, *Yes, but I don’t have a Great Indian Bustard with me down here. They’re not exactly native to London.*

*The thing hunting you is not the thing which hunted me*, he replied. *Its blind spot doesn’t seem to be a Great Indian Bustard, does it? It seems to be YOU.*

*Oh. I’m the Bustard*, I typed shakily, finally catching the stranger’s drift.

*For whatever reason, yes, you just might be*, he replied.

*Fuck*, I said.

*Yeah*, he agreed.

*Well, I’m not exactly going to feed myself to him. That won’t save me, will it?* I said.

*Think about it: you don’t need to feed ALL of yourself to him*, said the stranger, which is a sentence that will forever haunt me.

*Christ*, I said. *Just a pound of flesh? A pinch of a pound?*

*I don’t know, Carla. I really don’t. But you’re running out of options, aren’t you? You don’t want to live down there forever*, he said. *And I should add that you were right to cover your eyes, you know. One of the villagers looked directly at that thing for too long. We all saw glimpses of it, but she was hypnotised by it. She never was quite right after that.*

*So, I should do this blindfolded?* I asked.

*I would*, he replied.

And what did I have to lose? Fifteen years of solitude. I was ready, one way or another, for all to come to an end. I wanted to survive, of course, but if I didn’t, then at least the nightmare would be over. That was my mindset.

Using the bladed edge of some scissors I swiped from the office, I began the excruciating work of slicing skin away from my thigh. I’d also swiped a bottle of alcohol, but let me tell you that it did little to help. I studied biology, not medicine; I didn’t know what I was doing. But the thigh seemed like a good spot to take a pound of flesh—actually, nowhere near even an *eighth* of a pound, but I’m not a Bustard; I planned on sacrificing as little of myself as possible to this monster. After all, I had no idea whether the internet stranger’s story had any truth to it. I wasn’t planning to hack into my body for nothing.

When the vomit-inducing chunk of flesh came away, I quickly covered the wound with a clean bandage, stolen from the office’s first-aid box. I prayed that my leg wouldn’t get infected—prayed that it would be enough to satiate the beast’s hunger.

Then, with a sharp sting in my left leg, I staggered towards the station’s tunnel. I had decided, given my hellish encounter a decade earlier, that this black pit at the left-hand side of the platform must be the home of the beast.

I used an elastic band to bind my removed strip of thigh flesh to—this greatly saddens me—a rat; believe me when I say that it took many hours to ensnare the poor, unwitting fella, who was only scurrying around with his friends. The cruellest part was hobbling his little legs so that he wouldn’t be able to escape. Survival is a merciless thing.

Wearing my scarf—older and filthier than ever—as a blindfold once more, I walked up to the platform edge with my poisonous, fleshy, wriggling meal in hand. I dropped onto the tracks below, which were covered in water and sludge from recent flooding. Then I moved into the mouth of the tunnel, and my footsteps grew intimate as I entered the monster’s lair.

There came not a low growl from the depths of the blackness, but a distance plink—the plink of something stepping in a far-off puddle. I felt the rat squirm disapprovingly in my hand, and I mumbled words of apology as I placed the crippled creature, wearing a strip of my thigh, onto the tracks; then I started to back away slowly.

A series of watery slaps immediately sounded—they were not measured, but fast. Awfully fast. Fast, yet still inexplicably *heavy*. This bulky monster was far too nimble for its mass; I knew that even with my eyes covered, so I started to back away more quickly. The creature approached too speedily, however, and I tripped backwards, thumping my spine painfully against the metal tracks below.

Lying on the railway tracks, I expected the thing to pounce upon me, but it found my bait instead. Then followed the sounds of squelching as the beast munched on the defenceless creature—as it munched, also, on the piece of my flesh.

It did not take long for a hiss to spill out of the thing’s mouth—or some orifice.

The sound severed the quiet of that tunnel into two halves: one empty, and one full of that repugnant, spittle-coated breath which had spattered across my skin. And I don’t know what possessed me to do it, but I’m grateful that I tore the scarf from my eyes. Though I saw absolutely nothing in the black tunnel surrounding me, I immediately understood something horrifying.

The creature, at long last, *saw me*.

It was as if by devouring my flesh, that thing, hidden in the shadows, had fixed its narrow vision.

In response, without any conscious input, my body bounced to a standing position, swivelled on a heel, then barrelled towards the not-so-distant glow of the underground station about thirty feet away.

But as I ran, migraine starting to come into effect, I heard pursuing clomps—wet clomps from that unseen creature which had unintentionally entrapped me in its web, or bubble, for fifteen terrifying years. Its breath swept through the tunnel, encompassing me.

Once I made it to the fluorescent lights of my underground home, I scrambled onto the platform, making a firm effort not to turn back, but peripheral vision is the darnedest thing. I saw something direful out of the corner of my eye, as I dashed towards the tiled hallway ahead. It came from the tunnel’s mouth into the light.

There was no body. No large hairy beast. Fifteen years of fantasies involving titanic wolves and felines had all failed me. The truth was a terror beyond human imagination. Since seeing it, I’ve been telling myself that my eyes must’ve deceived me—after all, I saw it only in my vision’s periphery.

There emerged a face. It was a face nearly human, save for the fact that it filled the entire entrance of the tunnel, squishing against the brickwork as it struggled to squeeze out. Pale flesh finally slithered through the tunnel’s half-moon opening, like an ice pop surfacing. However, most of the creature’s face—or what my edge-vision detected as a face, for I still don’t believe whatever I saw—was filled with ginormous jaws. A wide-open mouth with pearly whites that each matched me in dimensions; a single fang would’ve been sufficient to obliterate my body.

Its flesh, which seemed to be emitting the hissing sound I had heard, was emitting black plumes of gas, as if the creature were evaporating—possibly from the meal it had consumed.

*He was right*, I thought. *I’m a Bustard.*

I saw all of this in the space of what must’ve been, at most, a half-second.

I didn’t stop. I ran. My brain whirred in horror as I attempted to process whatever I’d seen—an uncanny face of some human giant, ten times the size of any mortal man. Maybe. Maybe not. I’ll never know, and I never want to know.

I rounded the corridor’s corner to face the escalator. My mortal enemy for half of my life. Half of my *fucking* life. I sprinted towards it, tagged by that gargantuan thing whose flesh slapped rapidly against tiles. Then, there came pain like no other. A blazing pain. It tore across my ankle.

Something large had coiled around me, bringing me tumbling down against the escalator’s static steps. And I felt my foot ripping away—felt muscles, bones, and tendons being chewed inside that monster’s powerful maw.

Before the being had a chance to move its bite a little higher, however, an almighty sound came. It was neither a bellow nor a whisper, but something in-between, like the cry of a very, very old thing. A thing taking its final breath after eons of existence.

I didn’t want to turn, but I had to do so. I had to know it was over.

And when I did, I found myself looking at something *other* than the monster. I found myself looking down at the tiles, just past the bottom of the escalator, to see a black, watery puddle spreading across the floor.

I shuffled, unable to walk on my bloody stump, towards the button for the escalator, then I thumped it with my fist.

I felt myself fading as the staircase carried my half-alive body up to the top of the station. And as my eyesight faded, I realised something. Not just that it was blackness, rather than whiteness, which swallowed my vision. No, I realised, most wonderfully of all, that I had achieved something for the first time in fifteen years.

I had made it to the top of the escalator.

I woke this morning in a hospital bed, surrounded by family and friends who had spent over a decade searching for me. I showed them the messages and calls we’d been exchanging since 2010, but none of them understood.

I still hardly understand it either. It’s as if my loved ones remember it all, yet simultaneously don’t remember a thing. They don’t remember how they left me in that underground station to rot. Their heads hurt—probably in the same way that my head used to hurt—whenever they try to think about it, so I’ve told them to stop. It doesn’t matter now. I’m safe. It’s over.

Earlier, I messaged my internet hero.

*I’m sorry it took so much from you, Carla*, he said. *But I’m glad you made it.*

I did. And I’ll never take the underground [again](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
