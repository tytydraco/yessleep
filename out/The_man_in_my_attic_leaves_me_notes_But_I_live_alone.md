It started with a Post-it.

Bright yellow, stuck to the inside of the fridge. I found it when I came home from work. It said:

“You forgot the milk.”

I thought maybe I wrote it and forgot. I’d had a rough week—late nights, deadlines, not much sleep. It happens.

But the next night, I found another one.

“Please don’t lock the hatch. It gets cold up here.”

I live in a one-bedroom house. No roommates. No tenants. No reason anyone should be using the attic.

I checked the hatch in the hallway ceiling. Locked. Just like I left it.

I even climbed up there with a flashlight.

It was empty.

But when I came back down, there was a new note on my coffee table.

“Thank you.”

I called the police. They searched the house. Said there were no signs of forced entry, no hidden cameras, nothing out of place.

They left. I didn’t sleep.

Around 3:00 AM, I heard something thump above me. A slow, dragging sound. Like someone shifting their weight in the attic crawlspace. I stood in the hallway, staring up at the hatch, holding a knife in one hand and my breath in the other.

Nothing happened.

In the morning, I found a note stuck to my bathroom mirror.

“I like watching you sleep.”

The handwriting was different this time. Sharper. Like it had been carved into the paper.

I stayed in a motel that night.

When I came back the next day, the house was just how I left it. Quiet. Empty.

Until I opened the bedroom closet.

There was a new note hanging on a coat hanger.

“Why did you leave?”

I’m sleeping with the lights on now. Every drawer and cabinet stays open. I check every corner, every shadow. I haven’t gone back into the attic. I won’t.

But I can hear him up there.

Dragging something heavy. Laughing when I cry.

Tonight, I found the worst note yet.

Folded under my pillow.

“I’ve been trying on your skin. It fits.”

I didn’t sleep after that.

I burned the note. Scrubbed the pillow. Left every light in the house on and kept the knife beside me in bed.

But it didn’t matter.

At 3:09 AM, I heard it again.

The creak of the attic hatch.

This time, it opened.

I didn’t go check. I couldn’t move. I just stared at the ceiling, heart pounding, barely breathing, waiting for something to happen.

Nothing did.

Not until the next morning, when I found footprints on the hallway floor.

Bare feet.

Trailing from the attic hatch to the side of my bed. And back again.

The dust made them clear. Each one pointed forward… except for one.

The one beside me. It was turned sideways, like he’d been standing there. Watching.

Waiting.

I left the house and went straight to the police again. They searched everything—again. Said there were no signs of entry. No signs of anyone.

But I know better now.

He doesn’t need a door.

He’s already inside.

That night, I stayed in a hotel three towns over. A place with bolt locks and security cameras and zero attic access.

When I woke up, I found a note on my nightstand.

Folded neatly.

“Running is rude. You invited me, remember?”

I didn’t.

At least, I don’t think I did.

But something in me feels like I might’ve. Like there’s a blank space in my memory shaped like him.

The next few days, I stayed with friends. Told them my place was being fumigated. I didn’t want to drag them into this. Whatever “this” is.

But it didn’t stop.

New notes kept showing up.

One tucked into my jacket pocket:
“Your friends smell like plastic.”

One under my plate at dinner:
“You chew wrong.”

And then… one scrawled across my rearview mirror in grease:

“I’m going to be better at being you than you ever were.”

I don’t think he wants to haunt me anymore.

I think he wants to replace me.

I went back to the house today. I had to see it again. I don’t know why. Maybe to prove to myself I still existed there. That it’s still mine.

The lights were already on when I arrived.

The attic hatch was open.

I crept into the hallway. Every photo on the wall had been replaced. My face was still in them.

But my eyes were wrong.

Too big. Too dark. Smiling when I wasn’t.

I ran to the bedroom.

There was something waiting for me in the mirror.

Me.

But not quite.

His face was mine, but his skin was smoother. Cleaner. A little too tight. And he smiled like someone who didn’t learn it from people.

He waved.

Then turned away and walked toward the bed.

I looked behind me.

No one was there.

When I looked back at the mirror, he was lying down.

In my bed.

Wearing my body.

And that night, for the first time, I was the one in the attic.

He let me keep the light on.

For now.

I don’t know how long I’ve been in the attic.

Time doesn’t work the same up here. It drips. It hums. It folds around the corners like wet cloth.

Sometimes I see flashes through the vent — the reflection in a spoon, a glimpse in the TV screen. Him, walking around in my body. Cooking. Laughing. Stretching my skin like it finally fits right.

He doesn’t talk much anymore.

He doesn’t need to.

Everyone thinks he’s me.

He goes to work. Calls my friends. Sleeps in my bed. Smiles when people ask if he’s feeling better.

He’s better than me now.

More patient. More likable. More alive.

But he made a mistake.

A small one.

A stupid one.

He forgot about the mirror in the basement. The old one. The one with the crack in the top right corner. The one I used to check before job interviews. Before dates.

The one that only ever showed the truth.

I saw it yesterday.

He walked past it and didn’t look.

But I did.

From the attic.

And I saw myself still there.

Still whole.

Still me.

And I remembered something.

He didn’t take me.

I gave myself to him.

I remember the night now.

The scratching in the attic. The voice that came after the third drink. The whisper that said:
“You don’t have to be tired anymore.”

And I wasn’t.

Not after I let him in.

He promised he’d take the hard part. The pretending. The smiling. The weight of being me. And he did.

But now?

Now I think he’s tired too.

Because last night, there was a new note in the attic.

Scrawled in jagged, desperate ink across the wood above me:

“I can’t do it anymore. You win.”

And just like that…

I woke up in the bed.

The lights were off. The hatch was closed.

My hands felt smaller than I remembered.

My skin fit again.

But something felt wrong.

I turned to the mirror.

And smiled.

It was still his smile.
