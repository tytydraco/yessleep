In a very short amount of time, I found out that not only supernatural creatures were real, but they also needed a CSI. I debated whether I wanted to accept their job offer. The extra income was the main factor that swayed my choice. A handful of cases were sent to my email along with the amount each job paid. I gained a bonus if I trained a few Agents while working on the job. Since there were so many cases to cover, I doubted that having more people trained in my skills would ever dip into my income.

When I asked about this job, I had been told that I would be working on scenes that could have been done by a human, or a creature. However, the first deaths I documented could only be committed by a monster. After all, I’d been requested to look over the deaths of torn-apart creatures. A human could not do such damage to these bodies. I’d worked with a few Agents and taught them as well as I could. Each of the ones I met went by a different number instead of a name, and they all look very similar.

At least they were good listeners. They have gotten a lot of recent cases of monsters killed with organs removed. Or their bodies with other pieces missing. The Agents I worked with told me that the body parts of monsters hold power. An organ could be turned into a weapon or a medicine. Sometimes creatures just eat the part of the body to gain a boost, but body parts are more effective after they’re processed.

I taught these Agents a trick of putting VapoRub under your nose to help with the smell of decay while working. In exchange for that tip, they told me a little bit about how their world worked. I was stepping into this entire thing blind, so I wouldn’t understand much for a very long time.

“Our world is mostly based on favors. Killing a creature and taking parts of them is very disrespectful if it was done by another creature.” An Agent told me as he kneeled by a mangled corpse.

The monster of the day looked to be a mixture of a bird and a fox. The body is as big as a car with most of the insides torn out. He was taking photos and trying his best to get as much coverage as possible. He went by a pretty big number of ten thousand and six. I just called him Six to save time. I also asked him if he really had over ten thousand brothers. He confirmed it, but he wasn’t aware of how many were still alive. That number could be in the low hundreds.

“Don’t you creatures kill and eat humans all the time?” I asked and directed him to some places of interest to document.

He looked human. Jackalope did as well. A lot of these monsters held a human appearance, but others looked too terrifying to remain sane after encountering them.

“That’s different. Most of the ones who kill and eat humans know you don’t follow the same cultures as us. Only the jerks would try and make you uphold favors and deals if you didn’t understand it beforehand. It can get pretty complicated understand if you’re not living in this world. A creature may feel it fair to kill another if that one set foot on its territory. They see it as the other creature who breathed their air and lived because of it, and that means they could take their life. Some monsters tend to twist words around to get their way.” Six explained the best he was able.

I tried to wrap my head around it. If I came across a very bad monster, just looking or speaking to it may trap me in an unsuspected deal. Or if I came across a creature that only saw me as a meal instead of an equal to take something from, I would get eaten.

“So... Monsters just eat humans instead of being complicated about it?” I slowly asked.

“Some, yeah.” Six agreed and went back to taking photos.

I suddenly worried about what kind of job I took and the kind of world I stumbled into. The Agent didn’t appear to notice my distress and we worked together to finish the scene. His theory was a Hunter, or a poacher attacked the creature we documented. I needed to have Six explain the difference.

“There is another company made up of only humans that track down creatures to kill them. They use magic, so it would make sense why they took organs from this creature. Most likely they wanted to create a weapon to hunt down more of the supernatural. Hunters kill anything not natural out of hatred. Poachers do so for money. They’ll only kill if it’s profitable.” Six explained not sounding too bothered by the fact some humans hunted his kind.

“Doesn’t The Corporation do something about The Hunters?” I asked.

A noise drew my attention to the woods. A set of deep yellow eyes stared back at us through the trees making me jump. It was clear some sort of monster was watching us. I raised my camera as a poor defense in case the thing rushed over to attack us. A snout very similar to the dead creature we were investigating came out. After a few sniffs, the thing retreated into the woods. I breathed a little easier but wasn’t able to fully relax.

“Don’t worry. Those creatures won’t attack you while you’re with us. And no, The Corporation doesn’t stop The Hunters most of the time. To be honest, it’s all above my pay grade. They work together when needed and both know of each other’s movements. I know that The Hunters have killed Agents or tried to ruin The Corporation but there was never proof. Or they claimed a rouge Hunter was the cause.” Six said and knew we were almost finished with the scene.

I wished I had a larger crew to work on scenes like this. The Numbered Agents worked hard even if they didn’t fully know the job yet. Each of them learned quickly. Six seemed to pick up what to do the fastest and spoke the most. He acted very friendly and didn’t wear the sunglasses all of his brothers did. His eyes a blue, but so dull they looked like they should belong to a dead man. Even with unnerving eyes, I liked talking with him.

“Are you alright with that? I mean, you don’t sound angry that they’ve killed your co-workers. And maybe some of your brothers. Shouldn’t you be kind of upset a little about the fact they hunt you down even though you’re working to save humans from creatures?” I said and helped him start to pack up our gear.

He thought about the questions for a few moments. He shook his head, his soft expression never fading. Six wasn’t as stern as his brothers. I wondered why that was but didn’t ask.

“No, I get it. The Hunters formed because they hate creatures. Some creatures hunt for food. Others for fun. And others because they can. It's impossible for humans to only kill the ones who hunt for food. And it’s impossible for creatures to only eat bad humans. Even bad humans have people who care about them. The Hunters decided to try and kill all of the supernatural creatures because they don’t see any of us as equal. I don’t agree with that outlook, but I understand it.” Six said and he never lost his kind tone.

I’ve tried to think about all of that since I found out about the whole monsters-eating humans' thing. It really seemed like there was no fully moral option for both sides. Monsters needed to eat but there weren’t enough murderers and other violent criminals to support their populations. And I knew the legal system didn’t get it right all the time. Supernatural creatures might eat someone innocent locked away for a murder they didn’t commit.

I bet that no matter how hard they tried, The Hunters would never be able to kill a Dark God like the one who caused the clipped body cases. I was lost in thought when Six spoke up.

“You’re living with Jackalope, right?” He said out of the blue.

I knew Jackalope had been an Agent but didn’t know who he worked with in the past. I nodded and Six went on.

“We’ve done a few jobs. He always treated me nicely. How has he been doing? Is he smiling a lot?” The Agent asked and I felt a small pain of guilt in my chest.

Jackalope hadn’t been smiling that much lately. He forced one on his face when he saw I was looking in his direction. I was the cause of that. The trauma of what that God did to him had yet to fade. I doubted he would ever fully heal. I wanted to lie to Six but figured it was best to admit how my friend was doing.

“No. Not as often.” I admitted.

For some reason, Six smiled at the answer.

“I think that’s alright. Jackalope did it a lot for work as smiling was a tool. I’d hoped that he would feel comfortable enough to show some different expressions someday.”

I never considered that. Jackalope was a bit of a different person when we met. He acted more subdued after he moved in, and I just assumed that was because of what happened. It was possible he no longer felt pressured to keep a certain act up. I considered talking to him about this, but much later after he got more settled in.

Just as we finished cleaning up, Six got a call asking for him to go on a job. I was free to go for the day. He thanked me for the help, and I thanked him for what information he gave that day. Most of the time the emails for the jobs listed what Agent I may be working with. I decided I wanted to work with Six more even if that meant accepting lower-paid jobs. I could always take the bigger paydays after I talked with him a bit more.

I told him to be careful on his next job which caused Six to give me an odd look. I wondered if that had been the first time someone ever said those words to him. I really needed to start treating these Agents nicer. Their lives seemed pretty terrible from what I’d seen so far.

When I got home, I got changed right away and went into the shower. The smell of all those dead creatures stuck to my clothing. Since I started working in the field, I bought cheaper clothing that could be thrown out if the smells couldn’t be washed out. The outfit for today had a few more jobs in them.

While I was in the shower Jackalope came home. He normally checked up on Pesto and then got started making dinner when he finished work. To be honest, I tended to order food in rather than cook. Or I just skipped meals depending on how bad the scene smelled that day. I already gained a little bit of weight since Jackalope moved in. I never noticed how thin I’d been until I started to look healthier in the mirror.

I stood in the doorway watching him work away. I’ve offered to help but he refused saying he liked cooking. And I usually messed up dinner so badly it’s a miracle I hadn’t burned down the house yet.

“I worked with Six today. He asked about you.” I told him, forgetting that I’d been the one to give the Agent a nickname.

Jackalope paused to look over his shoulder trying to place who I’d been talking about. He knew Six was a Numbered Agent but wasn’t certain which one.

“Uh, ten thousand and six.” I corrected myself.

His expression cleared with a smile. The small grin was not the same kind of emotion I’d seen from him when he first sat on my couch. He no longer acted like an Agent, but sometimes I still saw traces of the person he’d been forced to be.

“He’s one of the youngest Numbered Agents. We only worked together a handful of times. I’m surprised he remembered me. What did he want to know?” Jackalope asked and turned back to making dinner.

He’d found the knife sharpener buried under other kitchen wear I neglected to organize after my mother passed away. With a sharp blade, he didn’t need to hold onto the vegetables to be able to cut them. But he tended to dice food slowly and unevenly, which was to be expected.

“He wanted to know if you’re still smiling.” I said deciding not to lie to him.

“And what did you say?” He asked back not pausing in his work.

“I told him the truth. You are, but not as often. He liked that.”

My new roommate stopped cutting the vegetables for a few seconds. He turned the words around in his head. When he started back up dicing, I could tell he liked the answer. He'd been worried about how other Agents thought of him after he got fired. They might not all be friends but on jobs, they needed to rely on each other. All of them wanted respect from their co-workers. I never thought about how much the idea of the other Agents not respecting Jackalope could upset him. He did his best to hide his worries and wasn’t the kind of person to ever talk about what ate away at him.

He protected a human and paid a heavy price because of it. If anyone thought less of him for his actions, then he didn’t need to care about anything that kind of person might have to say.

I didn’t feel very hungry that night because of what I needed to deal with during the day. Somehow Jackalope tricked me into eating something before going to bed. I packed up the leftovers for lunch the next day. If I did a tamer scene, I would be able to take a break and eat. If it was a bad scene, then I would give my lunch to the Agent I worked with that day. I quickly found out all of them liked free food but loved Jackalope’s cooking more. A few of them may get jealous over the fact I wanted to work with Six more often now.

The next day I got an email near noon asking to cover a scene at a campground. I saw Six’s number and accepted. I found myself in the middle of the woods with the Agent within the hour. The job description was fairly vague about the details. Six helped unload the gear but wasn’t going to help document the scene that day. Instead, he stood watch. His dull eyes trained on the woods and hand on a small dagger at his waist. The air tense between us. I still risked speaking as I got started working, careful not to disturb the trash around the small campsite we arrived at.

“What’s up with this job? I don’t know much about it.” I said while taking note of the smaller details so as not to miss anything.

The firepit was still fresh. Maybe only a few hours old. I bet if I dug around some embers still remained. The tent had been torn apart with some blood staining the edges. The camper’s items were scattered everything. Most of it was damaged. If I didn’t know better, I would say this was some sort of animal attack. The torn tent looked to be ruined by claws. For some reason. Bits of trash littered around the scene. I didn’t know the debris had been here when they set up camp, or they were just very messy.

“Some campers heard a scream in the middle of the night. They were half asleep and only remembered it in the morning. They came by this camp and saw all of this. They called the rangers, who called the police.” Six explained sounding oddly serious compared to yesterday.

“I’ll need to record what shoes everyone who came by this scene was wearing and where they stepped,” I told him, wondering what kind of mess we walked into.

“Already requested. We have some detectives working for us on cases like these. They can help gather evidence and do interviews with suspects.”

That answer brought up more questions. It felt like nowadays I was just always asking for more information. I really lacked enough knowledge of the supernatural world and how The Corporation functioned.

“Did the police call you guys to take over once they knew this wasn’t a natural case?” I pressed.

A wind blew causing a scrap of tarp caught in a nearby tree to wave. The sound made me jump. I thought it was something watching us. Documenting all this trash was going to be annoying. But necessary. You never knew what may be important to a case and needed to record everything.

“No, they’re mad we took it over and kicked them out of the woods. There was another set of campers that disappeared two weeks ago. No bodies were ever found. The Corporation keeps an eye on all recorded cases and will only send out Agents if there is a high chance of something supernatural being the culprit. There are far too many cases for the current amount of Agents to deal with.” Six admitted.

He kept looking around in the trees as if expecting something to jump out. His gripe was so tight on his weapon, his knuckles turned white. Aside from those small signs, he didn’t show how stressed he felt. I wondered what about this case made them certain some sort of creature had been behind it to act so quickly. I didn’t know how long the police started to investigate the woods before they were removed. As far as I could tell, this didn’t stand out as too odd of a death. I then didn’t like the idea of seeing two people disappearing in the middle of the night assumed dead as a minor case. These were people and I started to act as if it wasn’t too big of a deal. I’ve been working a bit too much lately.

“What about this stands out? I’ll need to know what kind of supernatural things to look for in future cases.” I said to the tense Agent.

“There is a mixture of a lot of things. No bodies normally mean they were eaten. Forests tend to be a hunting ground for a lot of different creatures.” He replied.

He started walking a little to try to ease some stress. Six moved very carefully not to disturb the scene in areas I hadn’t fully recorded yet. If a candy wrapper blew in front of his path, he very carefully stepped over it. I really wanted a crew for this. More people could cover the area faster, and I risked missing something. Plus, I couldn’t control the wind or other elements that may disturb evidence before I got to it.

“Do creatures hunt in the woods because it’s easier to hide from humans?” I asked still working away.

Six nodded without stopping his pacing fearing he may step on some evidence. The wind started to pick up kicking around leaves and other items. At least the campsite was relatively enclosed so the litter couldn’t get very far.

“That, and a few other reasons. They’re attracted to the magic that leaks from living creatures. A forest has plants, animals, and insects, so more magic than a city. But some creatures are attracted to cities to hunt regardless of if it’s riskier or not.”

Magic? I paused working to turn that word over in my head. Of course, there was magic. How else did that God stick people into objects? For some reason, I never really thought about it until that point. Somehow, I saw a short man with rabbit features as something natural. Magic explained everything odd I’d come across and yet my brain didn’t want to believe it was real. That was another topic I needed to ask about.

“Uh, living creatures have magic? Even natural ones?” I pestered.

It was hard getting all of this straight into my head as well as documenting the scene. If this turned out to be a supernatural creature, then I needed to know as much as possible. Knowledge normally leads to more evidence getting discovered while in the field.

“Yes. But it’s a very small amount. Most say humans don’t have any internal magic because you can’t use the power most of the time. And it’s such a small amount it barely counts.” Six started to explain.

“How small are we talking about?”

He stopped walking to gather his thoughts. He crossed his arms for a few seconds to figure out an example that may work.

“Let’s use stars in the sky. A human may have one star. Five or ten at the most. I’m a fairly weak creature, but I still would have at least five thousand stars worth of magic.” He explained.

I considered the difference in power level between us. I wasn’t really aware of what magic could do, but it was clear that the more of it was better. There was such a vast difference between us even though Six admitted to being weak. If a tree had the same amount of magic as a human, I understood why creatures would be drawn to the woods. Hell, even if every insect had half the amount of magic that humans possessed, then it still added up to a massive amount inside any forest.

“What about Lupa? How much does he have? And... What’s the strongest creature out there? I assume Gods should be loaded.”

Six gave a smile at my question. As nervous as he felt about us being in the woods with the possibility of some sort of monster lurking around, he was glad for the conversation as a distraction.

“Lupa is pretty strong. All the office directors are. He may be somewhere between five hundred thousand stars, and near to a million. The difference between his strength and my own is massive. Gods are nearly impossible to fully understand their powers to gauge it. And for the strongest creature... That would be The Silver King. His strength would be equal to every star in the sky that has ever existed and shall ever come into existence. That magic is endless and we all owe our lives to him. Since you’re human, you'll never truly understand how much creatures of the night love and fear him.” He said, his tone was very hard to read.

The expression on the Agent’s face froze the blood in my veins. Out there somewhere was a monster that went beyond the Dark God that took a part of Jackalope. What I experienced trying to answer a simple question was nothing compared to what ruled over the entire supernatural world. I prayed I was too far beneath the King’s notice for us to ever come into contact.

The sound of the tarp blowing against a tree drew my attention over to it. Six tensed again. His hand was ready to draw his weapon. I wished I had a gun, or something to protect myself. When I started working, I was given a windbreaker with some forms to sign. It had a simple CSI on the back and nothing else. I was told that the jacket held some protective power, but not much. Since I would be working with Agents, the Corporation didn’t want to waste resources on a more powerful jacket when I sort of have bodyguards. I trusted Six to do his best if something came out of the woods. But I found myself worrying about him.

He did appear to be an adult, but the longer I looked at him the younger he looked.

“Six... how old are you?” I wasn’t sure why I asked such a question.

He was confused over the question. At first, I thought I asked something too personal. It soon became clear he was just thinking hard about the answer as if he really didn’t know.

“I think this is going to be my third summer. The Numbered Agents are born as... something not human. We’re placed inside a deceased human body and fuse together with it. I’ve gained some memories of the one I took over, but only general things. I don’t know whose body this was, and I haven’t experienced most of what I know.”

I stared over at him shocked he was only three years old. It didn't feel real. I understood what he was saying but didn’t want to accept it. Six was too damn young to be out here fighting monsters and trying to act like an adult. I dreaded the idea that he had been working as an agent for all three of those years. Seriously, what was up with their world? Did he not have a childhood at all? I stopped working long enough for him to notice. I forced myself to go back to documenting and bagging items, but my thoughts tore into my heart. Did Jackalope go through the same thing? He wasn’t a Numbered Agent so not a part of their family. But I guessed his life was the same as theirs. He may have just started working the moment he was able.

A sound much like a twig snapping came from the woods. I shot up to look around as Six pulled the dagger from his belt. I watched in shock as he flipped the dagger in his hand and the blade shifted into a revolver in the middle of the swift movement. I was still new at seeing magic in motion. Even something as small as a weapon changing was a bit amazing to me.

He held the gun up, ready to fire. When he didn’t see or hear anything, he let his hand drop to his side and finger off the trigger.  

“Neat magic dagger.” I commented after my heart slowed down a little.

“The bullets are weaker than the magic that gets torn into the target if you stab it. But it’s useful to both have a long-range and short-range weapon.” Six admitted with a nervous smile.

I half listened to what he was saying. Something in the trees caught my attention and I focused on it. The human brain has a trait for seeing faces or objects in random patterns. Like seeing a cloud as some sort of animal, or the face of Jesus on burnt toast. I’ve heard the theory it’s helped our ancestors by them assuming every tree branch in the grass is a snake because sometimes, it is a snake that could kill them.

When I arrived at the campsite, I thought I saw the tarp as something it was not. A body of some sort of animal hiding behind the trees. As I looked up at the leaves, an odd image caught my eye. At first, I thought the bark of the tree looked like half a face staring down at us. Because I stared at it for so long trying to convince my brain it was nothing, I saw the creature before Six. He looked in the same direction but didn’t notice the same thing I had.

The monster realized I was staring right at it. The half-face in the trees moved and I shouted at Six that something was coming our way. He flew into action no longer caring about stepping over the crime scene. Our lives were more important than evidence. He raised his gun but wasn’t able to get a clear line of sight until it was too late.

The thing came from the trees, body making so many sounds as it came down on us. The same sounds we’ve been hearing since we got here. I was pushed out of the way at the last second as the monster wrapped a massive body around my Agent friend before he got a shot off. His gun getting tossed from his hand as he was slammed against a tree so hard, I heard bones snapping. I shouted out his name and that got the creatures' attention. That gruesome face turned in my direction causing me to stop breathing from fear.

The monster’s head was made up of four parts of human faces stretched and melded together. The open mouths made up the eyes, and the mouth was just an open hinge. The teeth made up of broken glass, bones, and twigs. The blue tarp made up most of the long body. The thing was very much like a centipede made up of a mixture of trash, and plant matter of the rest of the human victims it claimed. Four human ribcages hung from the tarp, some with still-fresh blood clinging to the bones. The smell of rot became overpowering when the direction of the wind changed.

I became so frozen in fear I couldn’t move. The monster came down, but I got saved yet again by Six who shoulder-checked the creature out of the way. It let out an ungodly screech as it rolled along the ground. The body picked up the pieces of trash as it rolled. Any damage Six could do would be recovered by the amount of garbage around us. I looked for his weapon. I spotted it far too late.

Arms took hold of the Agent. Each arm is either from the humans it killed or made of pieces of solid trash. He forced down a cry of pain refusing to let me hear how much trouble he was in.

“Carlos, run!” Six shouted, his voice cracking.

I froze yet again unsure of what to do. I couldn’t do anything to help. And yet I refused to let another person get hurt to save my life. Six struggled the best he could. His face started to change into something inhuman. The skin on his hands burst to show a white set of claws underneath. With strength I didn’t think he had; he tore through the hands keeping him captive.

The trash monster screamed in four voices at once. A set of large claws broke through Six’s shoes. His legs now look much like a set that should belong to an insect. His mouth went from ear to ear, and his eyes were now large and dark. I dove for his gun, feeling the cold metal in my hand. I should have made a run for it, but I wasn’t thinking properly at that moment.

At first, it seemed like Six gained the upper hand with his new transformation. He jumped and caught the creature along the side. His claws tore through, spilling out litter from the body. He landed on his feet ready for another attack. I shouted out a warning at the same time another set of powerful hands grab at him. They tore through his chest, and I helplessly watched.

I raised the gun and fired. It caught the creature in the face but didn’t do that much damage. The recoil of the gun hurt my hands like hell. For a small weapon, it should not have hurt that much. I refused to drop it. The monster tossed Six aside and came down on me. The thing caught my leg, lifting my body to slam my back against a tree stunning me for a few seconds. My eyes flood with tears from the pain. The jacket protected my ribs from being broken, but I felt a snap coming from my ankle.

When I opened my eyes again, I was face to face with countless lines of teeth. All of them were ready to come down on my head. I searched through my mind trying to think of what to do. The gun would not do enough damage to kill this monster and I didn’t know how to switch it back to the dagger.

Instinct guided my hand. Along with something else. I wasn’t aware of it, but the forest wanted this creature dead. It was ready to offer up power to do so but couldn’t act on its own. If my will faltered even in the slightest, that power would have been blown back into my face killing me regardless of if this creature ate me or not. A force surged at my back. A warm encouraging feeling joined with my single purpose. I did want to live, but I wanted to protect Six even more.

Without thinking, I shoved my arm into the monster's mouth. The teeth cut my bare hand holding the gun. I took a breath and fired the gun once. A burst of power that was not my own came from the weapon, tearing through the body from the inside. A pale green light exploded outwards, destroying most of the creature’s body besides some parts of the humans it took. I collapsed, my hand bleeding like crazy and shaking. Waves of pain came from my ankle, but I ignored the feeling to stand up.

I stumbled over to Six and got beside him. Blood poured from his chest and his breathing was raspy. I almost broke down. It was hard to fight through all the emotions to dig through his suit pockets to find his phone to call for help. I don’t know how long we stayed there for. It may have only been a few minutes. I took a hold of his hand refusing to leave him.

“Hey Kiddo, you’ll be right. Help is on the way, you’ll be fine.” I said, my voice barely a whisper.

I don’t know if he could hear my words. The blood-stained his pale face and white shirt. Finally, others showed up to collect us. It took a lot for them to separate us. In a blur of motion, I found us inside a hospital, and they needed to pry my hand from his to take me into a different room to be treated.

My injuries were mild. Since I now worked for a supernatural company, they had ways of healing wounds faster than normal. My hand and ankle were wrapped in some bandages I was told to leave on for three days. I also was ordered to stay off my foot, which I immediately refused to do so. I paced outside my room demanding to know how Six was doing. I wanted to be right with him the moment he woke up. I wasn’t even aware of how I looked. My front was covered in both of our blood, and my clothing covered in dirt from the fight. because I refused to listen to anyone, they brought in the big guns to get me to go home.

A short man came down the hallway, his soft paws silently walking across the floor. He stopped in front of me, but I still refused to stop moving. It felt like if I stood still, Six would die.

“The Agent is alive. He'll recover but we are unsure of his future with the Corporation.” Lupa spoke in an even tone.

Rage flared through my body. He stormed over to him and took his collar in my hand. I knew he was far more powerful than myself, and yet I didn’t care.

“Why was it just us out there?! Six could have died! You should have had another Agent just in case-”

“We do not have enough Agents for just-in-case situations.” Lupa cut into my rant before I got too far.  

That simple fact deflated my anger. I suddenly felt drained and needed to sit down. I slowly sank to my knees, feeling dizzy and sick. To his credit, Lupa didn’t comment on my weakness.

“Take some time off to recover, and to decide if this job is suited for you.” The man said sternly.

He turned on his heel and left me alone in the hallway debating all my choices so far.

Some kind staff members took me home. I was in such a state of shock I didn’t know what to do the moment I walked through the front door. My eyes fell to the shoe rack because a certain color caught my eye. Jackalope's work shoes sat on top of a plastic bag covered in blood. Panic rose through me, and I charged into the living room to find him sitting on the floor watching Pesto hop about. The bottom of his pant legs stained with blood, but he was uninjured. His face flew into the same panic as I felt when he saw my clothing covered in a deep red.

“It’s... not mine.” I croaked out trying to calm him down.

That relaxed him enough to pause getting up from the floor. I sat next to him, still too much in shock to do anything else. Jackalope was an Agent. He knew days like this happened.

“Your shoes...” I started unsure of how to ask what happened to him that day.

“Delivering mail to monsters gets... messy some days. It’s fine.” He said but sounded exhausted.

I did a double take over what he said. Which made him give me a strange look.

“Monsters?” I asked slowly.

I knew he got a job delivering mail but didn’t know he dealt with monsters. The more I thought about it the more sense it made.

“I told you they fixed my eyesight. Did you think that was done through regular means with no recovery time?” He answered in a light voice.

“Wel... UPS or FedEx is a big company. I thought maybe...” I started trying to defend myself.

“Carlos...” Jackalope said gently.

I found myself blushing from embarrassment. This entire time I assumed he worked with humans. At least he was kind enough not to laugh over my mistake.

“We’ll buy you new shoes tomorrow. Is there anything else you need?” I said quickly, trying to change the topic.

He knew not to ask me about my day. I would tell him when I felt ready, and he would do the same. He thought for a while and finally looked over sounding like a child asking for an expensive Christmas gift.

“Can we... Get a friend for Pesto? I know it’s a lot to ask for another animal, but I feel bad he’s alone all day while we’re at work.”

I don’t know what kind of horrors he saw that day, and yet he was worried about a rabbit. I smiled which I didn’t think I had the expression me that day.

“We’ll look into it. I want to make sure we know how to introduce a new rabbit and if Pesto wants a friend.” I told him.

When I was a child, we had a few cats. I knew that some animals you couldn’t just toss together and expected everything to be fine. I didn't want to put Pesto into a stressful situation when we just wanted to do what was best for him. Jackalope nodded in agreement, his smile something I was glad to see after the day I went through. We sat for a long time trying to process what happened. It wasn’t just our jobs, but everything we’d been through in such a short amount of time. He shifted trying to get comfortable and his hand brushed against mine. On reflex, I took it.

“We’re still here.” I told him unaware of why I felt the need to say it.

He nodded, needing to hear those words. After everything, we were still there. And that’s all that mattered at the end of days like this. He didn’t force me to eat something that night. I showered and tossed my clothing out. He did the same after me and we both went to bed early unsure if we could even sleep that night.

I hated being in the dark after encountering that God. But I felt as if I slept with a light on, that would be letting him win. I tossed in bed, feeling far too cold under my blankets. I refused to open my eyes to look out into my dark bedroom fearing I may see something staring back at me. I think I slept for a few hours. The exhaustion finally caught up to me. When I woke up, I felt even more tired than when I drifted off to sleep. A soft sound of footsteps came from the hallway making me sit up in bed. I thought I had closed my door and yet I saw a figure walking down the hallway to stop just before my door. I wasn’t scared because I recognized the silhouette.

“Jackalope...? What’s wrong? Having issues sleeping?” I asked in a tired voice.

His form appeared black from the small amount of light coming from his open door. Since he moved in. He hadn’t once gotten out of bed after dark. Seeing him at my door was strange.

“Can I sleep with you?” The voice came from the figure.

It sounded like Jackalope, but fear tore through my blood. This wasn’t him. I was either having a nightmare, or something else got into my house. The shape noticed I knew something wasn’t right. Two blue flames appeared as eyes in the dark. The figure started to make a run towards my bed, the footsteps heavy with laughter that mixed in. I launched myself towards my bedside table and flicked on my lamp. The light covered the room and the moment it turned on, the figure disappeared as if it was never there. Breathing heavily, I scanned the room. I then flew out of bed to turn on every light in the house. Jackalope somehow slept through the entire event. There wasn’t any way I could go back to bed after what I saw. My theory was that Dark God wasn’t done with us yet.

I could have rented a room somewhere for us, but I assumed a God could follow us anywhere. Until I could get a hold of someone in The Corporation to help, I decided there was no harm in keeping the lights on at night.
