Keeping a diary was something I’ve always done when I was a kid. Maybe the hobby started when my mother gave me my first diary and I was bored at that time. It was solid magenta with a large clasp that kept it closed even when I stuffed it with random drawings I made. At some point, Mom realized the diary and some art supplies kept me occupied and out of trouble when she went out to work her second job at nights. So, she made it a tradition to give me a new diary as a present for my birthdays. And it became my mission to fill them up with entries before the next celebration. The tradition lasted until she passed away just before I graduated high school. But I revived the tradition when I was a sophomore in college, using the money she left for me. 

I’m sorry. You might think I’m jabbering about something trivial. But my diaries and how I started to routinely and unceasingly write in them has a reason behind them. And it’s also the reason why I’ve chosen to write my last entries here on this website. 

Just please, read until the end and remember, there are two things that are certain: my name is Selina and it all started on September 13, 202x.

September 13, 202x

As I clocked out from the office around 7:30 PM, I remember feeling irate at everything. I was pissed at my coworkers for procrastinating and causing me to do overtime. I got irritated when the 7/11 near my house didn’t have the sandwich I liked. And I nearly broke down when I couldn’t get my heels off my feet at the first second I entered my apartment. 

I remember being tipsy from the beers I bought on a whim. But I don’t recall how many bottles I drank or how I managed to get into my bed. All I knew was that the next time I opened my eyes, there was this ringing sound in my ears. I rubbed my face and felt around for my phone that was usually by my pillow to check the time. I was surprised to see that it was still 11:49 PM since I thought I would sleep until the morning. 

*Well, tomorrow’s the weekend anyway,* I mused. I turned on my bedside lamps, hoisted myself off the bed and started to make my way to the kitchenette. *I should make some coffee and maybe read a book.* 

Then a realization belatedly hit me. 

My lockscreen was different. I was sure it was my mom’s portrait, the one I took during one of her last birthdays but now—

I grabbed my phone off the bed, opened it, and froze. Staring back at me was me and a stranger. 

It was a selfie. In it, another woman smiled and had an arm around me while she held a cake in front of us. It seemed like it was a birthday cake. *My* birthday cake. The frosting said, “Happy Birthday, Seli!”

That woman looked like me. As soon as I thought of that, there was this feeling that crept up. It was like some sense of familiarity or fondness that I shouldn’t be feeling towards this woman. I hastily shook my head, clearing my mind.  

*What the hell? Is this some type of prank?* I thought as I unlocked my phone and swiped through the apps. *Did someone photoshop this or used some type of app or AI? But no one should have access to my phone.* 

Then my fingers stilled. While I was clicking through the apps, I opened the gallery. There, I saw pictures of me in a park with the same woman. She had familiar features that I saw everyday in the mirror: dark hair, brown eyes, and an asymmetrical smile where only 1 side had a dimple. 

It was eerie, to say the least. My mind raced as I scrolled to more photos that shouldn’t exist. There were snaps of a dog in my apartment that I was certain I never saw before. There were mirror selfies in a restaurant I couldn’t recognize. And so many selfies with a woman who looked like me. Like a younger version of mom, or so relatives would say when I briefly visited my hometown after graduating college. 

Locking my phone, I reasoned that this was an elaborate prank by my friends or a random TV show. Or maybe I’m in such a vivid dream caused by my sudden drinking. I tossed my phone back onto the bed and sighed. I closed my eyes and massaged my temples. 

Just as I reopened them with my head down, it dawned on me again. A feeling that something was off, wrong, or out of place. Then I saw that I was standing on a carpet encircling my bed. In *my* room, when I never preferred to have them before. 

Mind whirring again, I looked around and saw more odd things. There was a coat rack with bags and jackets that I didn’t remember owning or using. There were figurines and collectibles of characters I didn’t know. Every turn of my head was a new, or wrong, thing that was stranger to me. Then the same emotion of familiarity that I shook away came rushing back to me. 

“Okay, okay, okay,” I breathed out. “Whoever is pranking me, you can stop now! I don’t see the cameras but I’m sure they’re here.” 

I looked around, waiting for the punchline. But it never came. 

“This isn’t funny, just so you know. I am *not* amused. So, please, stop this joke!”

Silence.

In the silence, I closed my eyes. “So, maybe not a prank and just a really weird dream. Maybe a vivid nightmare…”

I started to breathe deeply to try and calm my nerves. I wished that the next time I opened my eyes, I would be back in my actual room. I prayed that the nightmare would end and that nothing jumps out of the shadows like a jumpscare. 

“Selina?” A voice suddenly called out to me. 

I yelped and immediately lunged forward. Without looking up, I crouched to the floor and started feeling for my handgun under the bed. At the back of my mind, I was screaming for it to exist wherever this is. 

It *was* there. Thanking the gods, I pulled it out and pointed it at the person who I assume broke into my apartment. 

“Whoa, whoa, okay!” The intruder said as they raised their hands and backed up into the dark. “Selina, calm down. It’s me!”

A thud sounded as the intruder’s phone hit the floor. The flashlight was on and it was like a glare messing with my vision.

”Who are you? How did you get in here?!” I questioned loudly. “How do you know my name?”

“Selina, what are you— Oh no.”

I heard a tired sigh. I could vaguely make out the woman lowering their arms and putting their face in their hands. 

“No, no. Oh, Selina. No…” She whined softly. 

The scene unnerved me even more. But I kept the gun pointed at the stranger. My hands were shaking and I slowly inched towards my phone to call the police. 

“W-What are you mumbling about? Tell me where this is and who you are now,” I demanded, trying to feel brave. 

The woman came to attention and I felt her gaze fall to the phone I was reaching my hands to. I panicked and just as I was about to fire, she put her hands up again. 

“I’m not a threat! I know you think something bad is happening right now but I assure you, you’re safe. I am not here to hurt you, just please hear me out.”

I made no reply. My head was screaming that whatever she spouted out was some bullshit. *I feel very unsafe right now, you know?!*

“You don’t have to put the gun down, okay? Just give me a chance, please,” she pleaded. “Please listen to me, Seli.”

I stood still, saying nothing. With the gun in my right hand and now my phone in my left hand’s grasp, I took a few steps towards the windows. My mind started formulating a ridiculous plan of jumping from my second-floor apartment out into the street, away from this lunatic. I would likely break my legs but people would surely notice me and get help. 

While I was thinking of an escape plan, she stepped into my room. With the lights on, I got a good look at her. I gasped. 

It was her. The woman in my pictures. Her hair was messy, and her eyes widened in concern. But it was unmistakeable, she was that woman. 

My movements stopped and I stared at her. She inched closer with her arms still up. 

“It’s me, Selina. It’s me, your sister, Casey. You recognize me, don’t you?”

*Lies*, a voice interjected in my head. I woke up from my stupor and realigned the gun. “What fucking nonsense are you saying right now?”

She paused and lifted her arms higher. “I’m your sister, Selina. For God’s sake, just look at me closely.”

”I *don’t* know who you are!” *Or whatever the fuck’s going on right now!*

Tears started rolling down her eyes. That completely caught me off guard. 

“Fuck,” she whispered. “Is it happening again? Are you sick again?”

*What.* My hands were uncontrollably shaking. From confusion or fear, I did not know. All I knew was that I needed to leave this situation or just wake up from this nightmare. 

“Listen, Seli. I’m Casey. You might not recognize me, but I’m your older sister and I take care of you.”

She clasped her hands as if in prayer. 

“I would never hurt you. Never. Please put the gun down and join me in the living room. I’ll explain everything, I promise.”

She stepped backwards and slowly exited the room. I could hear her moving around in my apartment. The sounds of her soft footfalls were mixed with clinking sounds and bags being opened. 

I stood there, silent and confused as ever. I lowered the gun but I didn’t let go of it. In fact, I checked if it was still loaded. Then I contemplated whether or not I should call the police. 

She was not an immediate threat. She left the room and I could just jump or run out before she could even realize I even moved from where I was standing. I could scream so loud, the neighbors would have to call the police. 

*Leave now,* echoed the same voice in my head from earlier. A low ringing in my ears was thrumming.

But a nagging feeling slowly started to overwhelm me. An unwelcome one. Then in an instance, my focus on escaping or shooting my so-called sister vanished. Like it was never there. 

Before I could concentrate on what was going on in my mind, my sister called out to me, “Selina?”

‘Casey’ reappeared at the doorway, with mugs in her hand. “I made some hot chocolate, your favorite.”

I couldn’t see it. But I must’ve had a blank look on my face as I answered, “Um, sure.”

She smiled warily and went back into the living room.

Minutes later, I was curled up on the couch with a mug of hot chocolate in my hands. My gun and phone were on my lap. While my initial hostility had gone down considerably, I was still nervous of her. 

She sat on a small stool across from me, another item I know I never owned. I didn’t know I was eyeing her so intently until she coughed. I looked away and shifted into my seat in a futile attempt to distance myself from her.

“Well, where should I begin,” she nervously said and licked her lips. “My name’s Casey. I am 3 years older than you. We didn’t grow up together because Dad took me with him when he and Mom divorced back when we were still kids. We did not have much contact until Mom died and we met during your senior year of high school.”

”Stop,” I interrupted. “Now I know you’re lying, Dad died when I was still a baby—“

She put her hand up in protest. “I know. I *understand*.”

She sighed and hung her head low. 

“That’s the same thing you told me when we met face-to-face during Mom’s funeral. You kept denying Dad’s and my existence. You insisted we were scammers trying to steal Mom’s life insurance.”

She continued with her story. Apparently, I had a mental breakdown when I found Mom's corpse and that I was acting out of sorts in the psych hold until one day I “snapped back into reality”. Casey said that I arranged the funeral perfectly, listened properly to the doctors, and acted “back to normal”. I ended up convincing myself and everyone else that it was just shock and the horror of the situation that unsettled me for a while. 

She told me that I confronted them and told funeral goers that they weren't my family. Casey then looked into my eyes and asserted that that was impossible. We might not have bonded like normal families do but we had contact and were aware of each other. Then they ascertained that the trauma may have affected me more than the doctors thought. I was then sent to a psychiatrist in the city where my Dad and Casey lived. 

“Dad was told that you were having false memories due to trauma and that therapy could help you,” she said as she sipped from her mug. “After a few months, it started to work. You started to recognize me and Dad, and little by little remembered the real past.”

“But…?” I tested. I knew there was a “but” coming up.

She then started sobbing again, “You began to turn into someone else. The person who didn’t know who we were. One day I came home early to take care of you cause you had a fever, and you jumped me at the door. You pointed a knife at me. And you kept asking me why we were holding you hostage and where Mom was.”

Her sobs echoed throughout the apartment. After a few moments, she sniffled and looked back at me. “Dad came home in time. After that, there were visits to psychiatrists and specialists that you are better off not remembering. Since then, you would once or twice a year wake up with different false memories. To help you, we had you keep a journal whenever you were back to your original self to keep tabs on your daily life, your work, and your relationships.”

Up until this point, I was quiet. I didn’t interrupt anymore after the first time. Then when she mentioned a journal, I sprung up from the couch. 

That’s right! My diaries. They would be proof of what’s actually real. I never really mentioned them to anyone or in anything, even when asked if I had a habit of journalling or diary keeping. To me, they were parts of me that I put into writing and treasured close to my heart. 

I ran back into my room, ignoring Casey as she followed me in. Setting the phone and gun within reach, I took my cow plushie from a small pile near my pillow. Flipping it around, I found the hidden zipper and fished out my diary. It was the latest one in my collection: a black, small, leather-bound journal.

To this, Casey peculiarly gasped like it was a surprise. I caught her muttering something under her breath, “So that’s where you keep it.”

”What?” I swiveled around and pointedly stared at her. “You mean you never saw me write in this before?”

She shook her head. 

“No, you loved it so much that the moment you got it, you kept it away from us. But everytime I’d mention it and you’d read it, it would calm you down.”

I did not know if I believed her explanation. How can they be so sure that the contents of a journal I guarded so much would help me with my supposed mental illness? I didn’t buy her story from the very beginning anyway but this just makes it more suspicious. 

I turned away from her and ran my fingers across the pages and the edge of the diary. I confirmed it was the one I owned. *Thank God*. Then, remembering I had a “watcher”, I smiled and shooed Casey away. 

“Could you leave me alone for a while? It’s kinda uncomfortable with you standing there,” I requested. 

She tensed up but ultimately relented. Casey briskly left and closed the door behind her. 

I kept my eye on the door for a long moment. 

The life I know I lived is real. My experiences and memories aren’t false. My parents were poor immigrants who came to the US when I was still a newborn. Dad died when I was a toddler, and soon after his death, Mom got two jobs to support ourselves. She was doing work as a nurse and a grocery store employee just so she could send me to school, pay rent, and save up for my college education. She never told me, but Dad actually left debt for our family and it was the primary reason why Mom overworked herself to death. I only discovered it after seeing the papers in Mom’s things. 

After Mom’s passing, I used the money from her life insurance and the money she saved up for me to enroll in college and move into the school dorms. I only bought food and other necessities with salaries from my part time jobs. Then I graduated and got a job soon after in a textile company. I moved into a small one-room apartment, which I slowly but surely filled with furniture over the years. 

I’ve only ever had 2 boyfriends and they were during high school. I’ve gone on dates but none really stuck around enough for me to commit. I keep in touch with my maternal cousins who came to the US for studies and go out with friends from college every other month. I have an amicable relationship with my coworkers but I don’t go to dinners with them. It’s sort of a general consensus that I don’t have many relationships with other people in my personal life. And that makes it easy for me to remember everyone I’ve had even a semblance of a conversation.

So, there is no way I could ever miss a formerly estranged sister from who knows where. 

I never had a sister. Never even had a best friend to consider a sister.

All of those experiences are real and I wrote so many details about them in my diaries that they are a testament to my life, my *real* life. 

*Right. This must all be an elaborate prank or a convoluted nightmare*. Suddenly, my original plan of escaping ignited once more, but now with my diary in hand. 

Before anything else, I collected the gun, diary, and my phone and weighed my options. But before I could stand up from the bed, the ringing in my ears rose to a higher pitch. I groaned and crumpled to the floor. 

*Do not resist,* a voice reassured in my head. I strangely trusted those words. 

I rested my head on the floor and let the ringing go on. And before the pain got too much to bear, I was knocked out. 

The last thing I saw was my “sister” ran in the room. 

“Selina!”

——————

The next thing I knew the ringing morphed into the alarm I always set for the morning. The familiar tone brought a relieved sigh out of me. I wiped the sweat off my face and smiled widely when I saw my Mom’s beautiful smile on my lockscreen.

*That was such a weird and horrifying nightmare.* That thought went through my mind when I stepped out of bed. 

Turning around towards the living room, my foot hit something. And an ominous feeling surged within me. 

*No, no, no.*

I looked down and saw my gun. Not where I usually hid it: under my bed. No. It was right where I placed it before falling unconscious in my nightmare. 

My breathing sped up as my mind made up different scenarios on why this could've happened. The first reasonable thing was maybe I developed into a sleepwalker. The other reason may again have something to do with the confusion I’d get when I drank alcohol. 

I picked up the gun, and moved to replace it in its usual hiding place. But a voice was telling me to hide it somewhere else. With a bit of a hesitation, I taped it behind my bedside table. 

Then I checked around the rest of the apartment and made sure that it was the same as yesterday. No additional furniture, and no random photos in my phone too. It seemed like it was only my gun that was misplaced. 

*I should just stop drinking.* I shivered as I slumped onto my couch. I was *not* an alcoholic. I occasionally drank and it was usually wine. The binge drinking from yesterday was a rare occurrence. But now, maybe I should stir clear of all types of alcoholic beverages for a while. 

I did not want to stress myself out so early in the morning so I just made a calendar note to go to the doctor and went to make breakfast. I also took out my diary and wrote everything before I could forget. Before long, the weird nightmare was pushed out of my mind and I went back to my usual routine. 

However, the unsettling eeriness returned that night. I prayed that I did not have to go through that again. But I couldn’t stop my body from falling asleep unless I forced myself to stay awake by drinking coffee or an energy drink. 

*Nothing’s going to happen. You’re going to a doctor and he’ll give you meds to solve your sleepwalking issues. You’re going to be fine.*

With a last look around my familiar room, I closed my eyes and surrendered to sleep.

——————

The next morning, I was ecstatic to find myself in the same, old, white apartment. In the same bed and with the same phone lockscreen. 

But that relief was gone when another thing was misplaced, or more appropriately, “added” to my things. 

The stool. It was never there before. It was certainly not there all day yesterday. But I, frozen in fear, saw that it was right where Casey placed them when she talked to me. 

And another thing: it felt warm. Like someone had just been sitting there for a while. 

(Part 2 soon?)
