*Translated to English: I think, therefore I am.*

>*-Rene Descartes*

Everyone gets one single wish in their lifetime. It doesn’t matter who you are or where you come from. Every single human being is born with one wish destined to be granted.

“I’ve wished for a million dollars countless times and got nothing. This is bullshit,” you might think. But listen—don’t call me a liar. I have no reason to lie to you, and you have no reason to distrust me. Hear me out, and maybe you can save someone else’s wish. Maybe you can give them the chance to do it right. Maybe you can stop them from making the same stupid mistake that I did. Maybe you can save them.

But I digress.

You probably wasted your wish when you were still a kid. We wish for so many things as children. “I wish my tummy didn’t hurt. I wish we could have cake for dinner. I wish I didn’t have to take a bath tonight. I wish I didn’t have to go to school tomorrow. I wish my crush would talk to me. I wish, I wish, I wish.”

And at some point, amidst all this wishing, your wish gets spent. But on rare occasions, a wish waits until adulthood. Usually, it’s wasted on something mundane, as adults have learned to temper their expectations, to cope with the crushing weight of our standard reality.

I witnessed one such wish being granted. It was so stupid. Such a waste.

When I was in my mid-20s, I moved to a new town with my (now ex) partner. We started in a little rental, just the two of us. We both landed jobs at a local pizza place, and given our experience, I quickly rose to a lead delivery position while my partner became the GM protégé. We worked hard, made good friends, and eventually moved in with our new GM.

Initially, we were waiting for his lease to expire or to find someone to sublease his apartment. The managers complained about the difficulty of finding renters, but they were just old and didn’t know that people don’t read newspaper ads anymore. I posted on Facebook and had the apartment subleased that same week.

During that week, the three of us applied and got approved for a nice two-bedroom, one-bath just down the street from work. We moved in by the end of the week.

While moving in, we realized we needed a microwave, among other essentials. This is important.

By the end of the following week, we had everything unpacked. We bought a little blue microwave from Walmart and settled in. We developed routines, discovered our likes and dislikes about the apartment, and our quirks living together. Nothing major—just thin walls and our bedroom sharing a wall with the bathroom where our GM had some gut issues.

The point is, we were all comfortable and familiar with the house when the wish was granted.

One day, my partner and I were standing in the kitchen, talking about nothing in particular. Let me give you the layout of the kitchen. It was simple, a walkway ending in a pantry. On the left side was a newer stainless-steel fridge, standard white counters, overhead freshly painted cabinetry, and under-counter storage. The oven was at the far end, maybe ten feet away.

On the right side were the same white countertops and freshly painted light grey cabinets. The key differences: starting closest to the entrance of the kitchen was our little blue microwave, then some counter space, then our double-basin sink, and next to that, under the countertop, was our dishwasher.

A small kitchen. Impossible to miss something big and obvious, especially after almost two weeks of living there.

So, my partner and I are chatting, and I commented on how the little blue microwave didn’t “fit” with the rest of the muted kitchen aesthetic. My partner agreed, then looked around and pointed to the overhead cabinets between the fridge and stove and said, “I wish we had a microwave up there. I can’t even reach those cabinets.”

I agreed that it would be neat, and then turned away from the kitchen. My partner looked down at their phone. When I looked back, it felt like I short-circuited. Right there, in the exact spot my partner had wished for, was a perfectly installed, brand-new microwave. It even sat recessed in custom cabinetry.

Obviously, this blew our minds. The first thing I did was call our roommate. They were six and a half feet tall and would have noticed a microwave in those cabinets. They said, “No, our microwave is on the counter.” I explained that we now had a whole microwave installed in custom cabinetry. Later, when they got home, they confirmed the microwave had not been there when they left for work, as they used that space to keep dog treats. The treats were moved to an adjacent cabinet that was unused until then.

I felt like I had just witnessed real magic, proof of something cosmic. But dread washed over me when I realized that this was their “once in a lifetime” wish.

That was it. A quadrillion dollars? The cure for cancer? Ending world hunger? No. A raise at work? A new car? A better life situation? No. A good day? Meeting a famous person? Finding a sugar daddy? No.

A microwave installed in the cabinets of a rental we would move out of in five months?

Wish. Fucking. Granted.

>*Some years ago I was struck by the large number of falsehoods that I had accepted as true in my childhood, and by the highly doubtful nature of the whole edifice that I had subsequently based on them. I realized that it was necessary, once in the course of my life, to demolish everything completely and start again right from the foundations if I wanted to establish anything at all in the sciences that was stable and likely to last.*

Now that you understand how easy it is to utterly waste a wish, take a moment to actually think about it. Can you remember when you used your wish? Can you remember that time you received exactly what you wished for, no matter how miniscule and frivolous it may have been?

Can you recall it? Do you remember it? I can recall mine with enough clarity that the moment seems to have more reality carved into it than our current reality does. That moment is more real than any other moment that has come before or after. That moment is the moment that the entire world began to sunder and devolve. It’s the moment that I tipped the scales against our entire collective future.

It's a moment that came about in a fit of lunacy and had consequences to match.

It was a sunny day, the kind that makes you want to believe in good things. The air was crisp and fresh, it was alive and serene. But it was also the day that shattered my life and left me a broken shell of who I once was. It was the day that hemorrhaged the birth of the end. I remember it vividly, every detail etched into my mind, resonating like the migraines of some late stage brain tumor.

I was driving back from the store, just a quick run to grab some essentials. The streets were bustling with life, people going about their day, children playing, families enjoying their time together.

I was fiddling with the radio, trying to find a good station, when I heard a loud horn and the screech of tires. I looked up just in time to see a car swerving out of my way. I had drifted into oncoming traffic. I reacted on instinct, jerking the wheel to the left, but it was too late. My car collided with the other vehicle with a sickening crunch, metal twisting and glass shattering.

The airbags deployed as the back of my car lifted from the earth. The sudden exchange of forces left me breathless, my body felt as though it could tear itself in half. I existed, momentarily, in a total dualism. The inner me was thrust forward, consciousness in tow, while the outer me was left to absorb laws of physics I’d have otherwise forgotten existed.

I doubt Rene Descartes had to experience a crash to develop his philosophy, but I do wonder, sometimes, what it was that caused great philosophers to develop their ideas. What was the motivation?

>*“It is not enough to have a good mind; the main thing is to use it well.”*    
  
*-Rene Descartes*

I am stalling to continue. This is difficult to recount. I feel as though I am still standing there, like it’s still the moment I realize what happened.

Before I knew it, I stumbled out of my car, dazed and disoriented, the smell of burning rubber and gasoline filling the air. The scene around me was chaotic. People were screaming, running. Some towards the wreckage, other away. I followed their gaze and saw the other car, a family sedan, crumpled against a tree. The front was smashed in, the hood crumpled like an accordion. And then I saw them. Two small bodies, motionless in the backseat, and a man slumped over the steering wheel, blood trickling down his face.

My heart sank. I rushed over, screaming for someone to call 911, my hands trembling as I tried to open the door. I pried and pried, but the handle gave no relief to the firm fixation of the door. A woman from the nearby house came running out, her face pale with shock. She came running towards me with a hammer and an outdated fire extinguisher from her kitchen. She helped me pry the door open after the fire extinguisher failed to activate, but it was too late. The children, a boy and a girl, couldn’t have been more than five or six years old, were gone. Their father, too, had succumbed to his injuries by the time the paramedics arrived.

The woman, Emily Hilough, was panting heavily beside me, still unaware of the tragic connection she had to the victims. Her focus was on assisting me, her hands working frantically to help extricate the bodies. It was only after a brief moment of observation that she glanced inside the car and recognized the small, lifeless forms of her children and the familiar face of her husband.

Emily's face contorted in horror as the realization hit her. A maddening sorrow overtook her, and she let out a piercing scream that cut through the air, a sound filled with unimaginable twisted horror. She fell to her knees beside the wreckage, now muted, her body wracked with pain as she held the lifeless hand of her son, which was resting on the car doors window frame, just barely long enough to reach beyond the confines. Her silence echoed louder than that of any sound I’ve heard before or since. A haunting stain of the irreparable damage caused in that single, devastating moment.

The weeks following the accident dissolved into a haze of police reports, court appearances, and sleepless nights. Each day bled into the next, an endless cycle of torment and guilt that gnawed at my sanity. The weight of the children's deaths, and their father's, was a constant, crushing burden on my chest, suffocating me with every breath.

I was haunted by their faces, their innocent smiles forever lost because of my carelessness. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw them—lifeless, broken bodies in the wreckage. The screams of their mother echoed in my mind, a symphony of grief that I couldn't silence. I stopped eating, the thought of food repulsive. My stomach churned with self-loathing, a black pit of despair that swallowed any semblance of normalcy.

Sleep became a distant memory. When I did manage to drift off, nightmares consumed me. I would wake in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat, heart pounding, my own screams echoing in the darkness. The bed felt like a coffin, the walls of my room closing in on me, trapping me with my guilt. I wandered through my days in a daze, a ghost of my former self, barely able to function.

I avoided everyone. My partner, my friends, my family—I pushed them all away. I couldn't bear their pity, their concern. I didn't deserve it. I didn't deserve anything but this relentless, all-consuming agony. My mind spiraled further into darkness, each thought a dagger, each memory a poison. I became obsessed with the accident, replaying it over and over in my head, trying to find some way to change it, some way to atone.

I would sit in my car, parked at the scene of the crash, for hours on end. I would trace the tire marks on the pavement, staring at the tree where the other car had crashed, willing myself to see something different, something that would make it all make sense. But there was nothing. Just the cold, hard reality of my mistake.

My partner tried to help, tried to pull me back from the brink, but I lashed out, my anger and frustration spilling over. I smashed things, yelled, sobbed uncontrollably. I became a stranger, a monster had come to inhabit the shell of me that was created the moment I ended their lives. I could see the fear in their eyes, the way they flinched when I got too close. It only made me hate myself more.

I started drinking, trying to drown the voices in my head, trying to numb the pain. But it only made things worse. The alcohol burned like fire, turning my insides to a moldering ash, but the guilt remained fireproof. It couldn't silence the screams or erase the images that danced through my mind. It only made me sink deeper into the abyss.

One night, I found myself standing on a bridge, staring down at the black water below. The wind whipped around me, cold and biting, but I felt nothing. I wanted to jump, to end it all, to escape this torment. But I was too much of a coward. I couldn't even do that right.

>*Dubium sapientiae initium.*

>*Translated to English: Doubt is the origin of wisdom.*  
  
*-Rene Descartes*

I stumbled home, my thoughts a jumbled mess of despair and rage. I punched the walls, screaming at the top of my lungs, cursing the universe, cursing myself. I tore at my hair, clawed at my skin, anything to make the pain stop. But it wouldn't. It never would.

I became fixated on the idea of making a wish. It was all I could think about. I knew it was crazy, knew it was a desperate, foolish hope, but I couldn't let it go. I spent hours researching, reading about ancient rituals, trying to find some way to make it real. I was losing my grip on reality, my mind fracturing under the weight of my guilt and grief.

I would stand in front of the mirror, whispering my wish over and over, like a mantra. "I wish I could undo it. I wish I could take it back. I wish I could save them." My reflection stared back at me, hollow-eyed and haunted, a stranger wearing my face. I was losing myself, slipping away into madness.

The world around me became distorted, unreal. I would see things out of the corner of my eye—shadows moving, faces in the darkness. I heard whispers, voices that weren't there, mocking me, taunting me. I was unraveling, my mind a shattered mosaic of fear and regret.

I became obsessed with the notion that there was some way to fix it, some way to atone. I would spend hours pouring over books, articles, anything that might offer a glimmer of hope. I started to believe in things I had never considered before—magic, miracles, anything that could undo my mistake. It was a delusion, a desperate grasp at something to hold onto as my sanity slipped through my fingers.

>*The thinking of the mind is twofold: understanding and willing.*  
  
*-Rene Descartes*

And then, one night, in the depths of my anguish, that incident with the microwave crawled forth from the unseen corners of my mind. I was standing at the edge of a cliff, the wind howling around me, the darkness pressing in. I felt like I was on the edge of the world, teetering on the brink of oblivion.

So, I made my wish.

In a moment of utter despair, I whispered my wish into the night, my voice breaking with the weight of my sorrow.

"I wish... I wish I could undo it all. I wish I could take it back. I wish... I wish..." I pounded my balled fists against my head as the tears descended haphazardly, caught in the vice like grips of gravity.

The words spilled out of me, a deluge of pain and desperation. I knew it was foolish, knew it was a last, desperate act of a broken mind. But I didn't care. I just wanted the pain to stop, to find some way to escape the endless torment. I was so tired of that lunacy. I was so exhausted from the ceaseless screaming in my own mind.

As I uttered my wish, a strange sensation washed over me, a warmth that seemed to envelop my entire being. For the briefest of moments, I felt a flicker of hope, a tiny spark in the darkness. But as the warmth faded, I realized that my wish had been granted in the worst possible way.

>*But I cannot forget that, at other times I have been deceived in sleep by similar illusions; and, attentively considering those cases, I perceive so clearly that there exist no certain marks by which the state of waking can ever be distinguished from sleep, that I feel greatly astonished; and in amazement I almost persuade myself that I am now dreaming.*
