Hello. For reasons that will become obvious throughout my coming exposition, I cannot give you my real name. If you read this and want hard answers... Best I can do is tell you to go out there and find them yourself before they find you. I'll use the name Quinn for these posts, and hopefully I'll be able to tell you everything I've learned before they can find me. 

Don't worry, I'm getting to the context. I'm a private investigator in a fairly large metropolitan in the United States. Typically I'm watching folks pretend to have a work related injury or spying on a cheating spouse to get proof for the divorce settlement. You know the job, I'm not sure why I'm explaining it to you. Nervous rambling I guess. 

This time I was hired to look into the practices of a local sleep specialist by the name of Dr. Luske. Don't bother looking him up, it's not a real name. Honestly not even sure it's a real person, at this point. A former patient of his left their appointment with a strange discomfort that they couldn't pinpoint and wanted to see if I could find anything out about what might have happened while they were under. 

Where I am fortunate is that I had a contact at Sovna, the pharma company that Luske worked through. With a little peer pressuring, far too much money, and a very expensive bottle of liquor I convinced my contact to get me a list of patient's and their contact information. Yes, I am aware that it's terribly illegal but I promise it had no information regarding their health and I'm redacting the sensitive stuff as I transcribe.

Carrying on. I used the list from my contact to send out anonymous survey asking these former patients about their own experiences with Dr. Luske and Sovna. I made a slight, tiny white lie about concerns with medicinal side effects and needing as much information and detail as possible to help keep consumers safe going forward. Y'know, just to try and sweeten the deal in case anyone was hesitant to tell the company what they'd been through. 

Nothing could have prepared me for what they went through, nor what it would lead me to. I've prepared the first response my email survey received. Pray for me, though, because as soon as I hit submit my countdown begins. I'll be on the run and uploading these whenever I can snag some free wifi. Off the grid, just me and the road- And as much caffeine as I can afford.

My name is [Redacted, henceforth known as 'Zora'], filing my report on my experience in January of 2014. I have been asked to give as much detail regarding the events of my visit to [Company Name redacted henceforth known as 'Sovna'] and my interactions with Dr. Luske who headed my trial.  For transparency, I am diagnosed with acute insomnia, stress induced paranoia, and have spent several months since the following events in the care of mental health professionals. 

I arrived in the evening in preparation for a sleep study I was told was necessary prior to being sent home with the clinical trial prescription. I've done so many sleep studies, this felt like routine at this point. Dressed in my hospital gown I was weighed and measured before being hooked up to a mess of wires that would monitor my vitals and brainwaves. Such a tedious process, made slightly more tolerable by the very bubbly nurse that was preparing me.  She was nice. I really hope she wasn't aware of what she was sending me into, but I also can't really say for sure.

I was ushered into the room I knew I'd be observed in. He was there waiting for me, seated in a cushioned chair beside the bed with the most disarmingly warm smile I can recall seeing. Dr. Luske. I remember thinking how strong the room smelled of aloe extract. I thought it was a strange smell for a medical building but didn't linger on it for too long. Despite my experience with these types of studies, he took the time to run through the general process and what he'd be keeping an eye on for the study. Given my insomnia diagnosis he did offer me a pair of pills to help me sleep the four hours allotted. They were green and blue capsules, I can't remember if they had any writing on them though. Of course, I took them- I didn't have any reason to question what a sleep specialist would offer me for a sleep study. No medication was notated on my paperwork for the sleep study.

Before the doctor excused himself to finish setting up his observation area, he walked me through the mask we'd be using as well as the CPAP machine they'd be having me under to regulate my breathing. 

"We need data of you at your deepest levels of REM sleep, Miss Zora." He was so genuine with his explanation, like he wanted me to know the reason behind every step of this study. His reassurances came with that same warm smile. "In terms of rest, this may be your most memorable four hour nap, yet!"

I tried to calm what nerves I had. I always get nervous before medical procedures of any kind... Though it's been a lot worse, since then. When I finally took a seat on the provided bed I remembered being shocked at how comfortable it was. Typically these beds were just glorified hospital beds but this- This was true comfort. I got myself settled, mask at my side, and waited for the doctor's orders.

"We're ready in here, Miss Zora." His professionally chipper voice crackled over the little intercom in the room. Prompting a half hearted thumbs up from me. "Go ahead and put on the mask whenever you're ready - And sweet dreams!" 

When I put the mask on, and started getting settled under the comforter, I remember a bit of discomfort in how strong that aloe scent was through the mask. It takes several minutes to get used to breathing through the machine. In and out.

In and out.

In and out.

In... And... Out...

The first thing I remember about the dream - No, the nightmare, was the smell of the sea. Salty. Fishy. Then the rhythmic crashing of waves against the side of ... a boat? I was on a boat. Why was I on a boat? Where was I on a boat?

I shot upright, nearly taking my head off on the bunk above my own and stumbling out of the cabin onto the dark deck of what was apparently a sailboat. The wind was bad, so whoever was running things had tied up the sail real tight. I could feel the mist off of the choppy black waves around me. My heart was already pounding from my disorienting awakening, but it dropped and nearly took me with it as a deep, haunting cry carried over the wind. Like that of a whale but... Wrong.

It was as if my joints had turned to stone. The sudden, clear realization that I was by all appearances completely alone. In the dark. With the endless sea around me. I tried not to dwell too much, forcing my limbs to carry me back to the cabin in search of some kind of light. Any kind of light. Phone? No, I had no idea where mine was and knew I wouldn't have service wherever I was anyways. The wind ruled candles out, as well- Not that I had any of those either. 

Honestly, panic began to set in a bit and I tore that cabin apart looking for anything. Anything to help me see what was going on around me. It was maddening, made worse by the waves flinging the boat around. Finally, in an emergency supplies pack, I found a few flares. Not ideal, but better than groping around in the dark. Anything was better than the bitter blackness around me.

I was wrong. So very, cruelly wrong. As I navigated my way through the debris of my search and wrenched the first flare to life, the eerie red flame illuminated the boat's immediate surroundings. The furious sea churned around me and the boat, and each wave brought a brief glimpse at untold numbers of new horrors lurking just beneath the surface. Too quick and obscured to glean what they were, but painfully present in my new scarlet world.

It was an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness there. The wind drowned out my shouts for help. The mist and the waves made staying upright nearly impossible. My only light was fleeting at best. I collapsed against the rail of the boat's deck and sobbed. I remember the distinct taste of the saltwater as it dripped down my face and washed over me from especially choppy waves for what felt like hours. But then that bone shaking cry rolled out over the waves again. So much closer. 

It occured to me, in the moments after that second cry, that I'd made a target of myself with that blazing flare. I'd announced my presence to whatever was out there and it was coming to me. Coming for me. It's mere existence a threat to my own. A threat to drag me into the abyss with it. It got closer and closer over the next several minutes. I couldn't do anything but curl into a ball against the ship rail and scream with each of its ungodly loud cries.

I heard and felt the boat snag violently on something. The wood and fiberglass shattered against whatever force this was and flung me into the black waves. The impact was hard, it knocked the air out of my lungs. I gasped, swallowed so much seawater, and fought my way to the surface to cough and sputter. Every wave shoved me back under and so frequently. Every kick of my legs or swing of my arms brought me into contact with some slimy, scaley, or jelly-like entity that I could not even glimpse the forms of. 

It was everything I could do to maintain a coherent thought, yet I managed to claw my way up onto a piece of debris from my shattered boat and pry the cap off of one of my remaining flares. I knew I was going to die. Something inside me had accepted it. I just wanted to see what was going to take my life if only for a moment. I readied to strike the flare and-

One hand, human looking but covered in scales and webbed at the fingers, burst from the waves to grip my ankle. Of course, I screamed both in horror and in frustration, desperately yanking at my limb to try and free myself. I don't know what it was. I don't ever want to know what it was, but I do know it wanted to drag me under. It wanted to drag me into the same abyss that it emerged from. Unfortunately for us both, it was violently interrupted.

The next few moments felt like an eternity. Everything moved so slowly. The roar that had been approaching sounded again. It was so close and so loud that my body jerk in response and I flung the unlit flare into the darkness. I barely had time to remember that some creature had me by the ankle when the ocean opened up beneath us... Whatever had been announcing it's approach had found us, and in one swift motion swallowed us both. I felt everything. From the muscles in the monstrous creatures throat tensing down around my body to my bones shattering under the pressure. If I managed to scream, I don't remember it. 

The last thing I remember before waking up was the searing, mind altering pain of the creature's stomach acids making contact with my skin as I left it's throat. The smell of rotting, digesting fish and meat filled my broken body as I attempted to draw in one last breath... 

When I came to, I sat straight up in bed and ripped the mask off of my face to gasp for breath. Dr. Luske was already in the room with a look of concern on his face but... there was something in his eyes now that unsettled me. It was like he knew, but I couldn't fathom how he would. He asked if I was okay, and informed me that he'd rushed in after the monitors showed my distress. I just sobbed. Sobbed and started pulling the sensors off of my body.

He did his best to calm me down, even asked if I wanted something for my nerves but honestly I just wanted to go home. I wanted to forget about all of it and... And not think about everything I'd just experienced. 

In the end, Dr. Luske and I concluded that I wouldn't be a good fit for the drug trial and I cut contact with Sovna afterwards. Since then, the sailboat has been a recurring nightmare to the point of threatening my sanity. I've admitted myself for several 72 hour holds in the local mental hospital since then- I'm not sure why, I just haven't been able to shake this nightmare and it's... it's driving me crazy.
