I’ve never shared this before, but I need to get it out. It started when I was apprenticed to Dr. Warthrop, a renowned monstrumologist. I thought monsters were just stories… until I encountered them.

It began with a horrifying discovery. A grave robber brought us something unthinkable: a grotesque, headless creature, its mouth a gaping maw on its belly. Dr. Warthrop named it – an Anthropophagus. I was thrown into a world where nightmares walked.

We realized these monsters were feeding in our town. It was surreal, tracking creatures of legend through familiar streets. The doctor was obsessed, but I was terrified. Each mutilated body we found eroded my sanity.

Our investigation led us to an old mine – the nest. Entering that pit was like stepping into a circle of hell. The stench of death was overwhelming. The darkness seemed alive with unseen horrors. We found them there – a colony of Anthropophagi, surrounded by the remnants of their feasts. The sight of those headless, eyeless bodies, mouths gaping in their stomachs, is seared into my mind.

The creatures attacked. I remember chaos, the wet sound of tearing flesh, the doctor’s shouts. We escaped, but barely. That night changed me. I couldn’t shake the images of those monsters from my mind.

Then things escalated. The Anthropophagi started hunting openly. The town became a war zone. Dr. Warthrop, driven by a mix of duty and morbid fascination, prepared for a final stand. We armed ourselves with weapons and traps, but nothing could prepare us for the carnage that followed.

The battle was a nightmare. Explosions, gunfire, screams. We fought amidst chaos, the creatures relentless. I watched the doctor, his determination unwavering even as the horror unfolded around us. We managed to eliminate the threat, including the queen, but at a terrible cost.

After the battle, the town was shattered. People left, and those who remained looked at us with a mix of fear and suspicion. But the real horror was what followed me.

I started seeing the creatures everywhere. Shadows moved, whispers in the night. I couldn’t sleep. I kept a light on, but it didn’t help. The darkness outside felt like it was pressing against my windows, hiding unspeakable horrors.

And the doctor… he became more distant, consumed by his research. I started to wonder if there was more to his obsession. Were we just studying these creatures, or was there something darker at play?

I left, seeking normalcy, but the terror followed me. I’d wake in the night, paralyzed, feeling those eyeless faces hovering over me. I couldn’t escape the feeling that they were still out there, that we had only scratched the surface of something ancient and evil.

I tried to forget, to move on, but the memories were too vivid. Sometimes, I’d catch a glimpse of something in the corner of my eye, a reminder of those dreadful nights. I started questioning everything – was the doctor part of something bigger? Was our battle just a small piece in a much larger, darker puzzle?

The isolation is the worst part. You can’t just tell people you’ve fought monsters. They wouldn’t understand. They’d think you’re crazy. So, you carry it alone, this heavy, dark secret.

I’m sharing this here because I need to warn you. Monsters are real. They might not be under your bed or in your closet, but they’re out there, lurking in the shadows of our world. And sometimes, in seeking them out, we invite them into our lives.

If you ever encounter something that defies explanation, something that seems like it belongs in a horror story – believe it. Don’t dismiss it as just a legend or a tall tale. These creatures, these Anthropophagi, they were just the beginning. There are more horrors out there, some perhaps even more terrifying.

I don’t know what’s coming next, but I know I can’t escape it. Once you’ve seen the darkness, it never really leaves you. It’s always there, waiting, just out of sight. And all you can do is wait and watch, hoping it doesn’t decide to step back into the light.
