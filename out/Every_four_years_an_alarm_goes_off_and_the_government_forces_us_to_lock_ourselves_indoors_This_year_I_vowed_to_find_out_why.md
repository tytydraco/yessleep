Every four years, an alarm goes off. It tells us that, whatever we do, we cannot leave the house for one month. We can’t even open our doors, no matter who says they’re on the other side. 

4TH OF JULY 2058. 

This was my sixth time dealing with the alarm. My 24th birthday had recently passed, and we threw a big party. Then, we had to start preparing for the alarm. The store's shelves were nearly bare. Everybody crowded around and fought for canned food, toilet paper, water, batteries–anything they would need for a month of solitude.

Some people had bunkers prepared, just in case the alarm went off more than once. My dad calls them crazy. He doubts we would ever have to isolate for more than a month–at least not in his lifetime.

I still don’t know why we isolate. Everyone refuses to speak of what happens during the alarm and, once the month is over, we simply go on with our normal lives. 

It was approaching midnight: the hour by which we all had to be settled into our homes. We enforced the metal blinds to cover the windows and the blocks for the doors. Nobody allowed in, nobody allowed out. The idea of doing it alone terrifies me, so I always stick it out with my mom, dad, and brother in my childhood home.

Some families prayed. Some took advantage of the last hour of electricity and watched their favorite movie with their favorite meal. Mine sat in silence, around the radio, staring at one another. My mom, my dad, my brother, and me. My eyes flashed back and forth from the radio to the clock on the wall. 

“Are you sure we have everything?” my mom asked.

“Of course, we do, Linda. What do you think I am, a moron?” he scolded her. 

“But Dad– “I was going to back up my mother’s concerns. It was impossible not to worry.

“Don’t you start. I’ve done this more times than I can count. We’ll be okay.” Deep down, I think he worried, too. 

Then… The alarm went off. 

It sounded like an average emergency broadcast alert–something you would hear from an incoming natural disaster, which often struck my curiosity concerning what was going on during the alarm. But even from the age of 4, I never actually wanted to actually find out. 

“This is a worldwide broadcast. Please stay inside your homes for one month–until August 4th, 2058, at midnight–starting now. Do not leave your home. Do not allow anybody into your home. If anybody knocks, do not trust them. Even if they sound like a family member, they are not. Again, do NOT let anybody inside of your home and, finally, do not open your blinds. This broadcast will be repeated in five minutes.”

“Okay, everyone, as always, there’s no need to panic. We’ll live as usual. We just can’t leave the house. So, don’t be afraid to watch some of the DVDs we have, and I’ll start dinner.”  My dad moved to the kitchen, and I heard the clicking of the stove. 

All my life, I was thankful we were able to utilize gas and electricity during the alarm. I couldn’t imagine what we would do for a month without movies, music, and cooked food. 

I went to my room and began to form a plan. Come nightfall on the last day of the alarm, when everyone was asleep, I was going to climb out my window and find the cause of the alarm. If I could survive until midnight, I’d be able to come right home and tell everyone the truth at long last.

ONE WEEK LATER. 

Things were going fine so far. The days felt so similar yet were flying by. Wake up, have breakfast, watch a movie, engage in a hobby, have lunch–you get it. At 10PM, everybody goes to bed. It seemed too good to be true, but for us we kept things casual. Everybody was still getting along, and that was the most important part. 

“Do you ever wonder why we do this, dad?” I asked during dinner. We were having spaghetti. 

He glared at me. “We don’t talk about it.” 

After that, everyone was silent for the rest of the night. How could we not talk about what was happening outside?

TWO WEEKS AFTER THE ALARM. 

Last night, I felt what simulated an earthquake outside. The entire house shook. It went on for an hour, and I didn’t move an inch. I hid as things flew off my dresser, peering at the blocked off window just in case I caught a glimpse of something, but I didn’t, of course. 

“Did you guys feel that earthquake last night?” I asked at dinner. The days were growing longer at this point. Nobody looked up, nobody answered. We sat in silence for two minutes, until I heard my dad sigh loudly.

“What fucking earthquake?” He seemed angry that I asked. 

“The entire house was shaking. How didn’t you feel it? Didn’t things fall from your walls and stuff?” I asked, putting my fork down. 

“No. Stop asking stupid questions!” 

Nobody else reacted. I left the table and brought my food to my room; I didn’t want to be yelled at for something so stupid. That means the rumbling has something to do with the alarm. 

ONE WEEK UNTIL THE ALARM ENDS. 

There was only 6 days left till I finally found out what was going on. The rumbling has happened every night since that night. It seems like… it’s getting closer. If that makes sense. Every night I grew more afraid, but nobody would admit to feeling it, nobody else would talk about it. All we were doing was watching stupid movies and avoiding important conversations. I had never felt more prepared to leave during the alarm, annoyed with how everything was going this time. Just 6 days left. I had to know. It was eating me alive at this point.

29 DAYS AFTER THE ALARM, 10:01PM. 

The time had come. I was ready to finally find what was behind the alarm. 

I opened my window, ready to learn the truth. 

I began heading down my childhood street, every house looked abandoned. Windows covered, lights off. I hid behind a bush, waiting for the rumbling. 

In the distance, it was there. Every second that went by, it came closer to my house. 

Until I finally saw what “it” was. It was terrifying. I have no idea the word to use to describe it. 

It must’ve been 7 feet tall. It nearly looked human, its skin was deteriorating, its teeth were sharp, and it looked like it was staring at me. 

I checked my watch, 11:00PM. This was enough for me, I didn’t know what this was, if there were more after it, or where it came from, what it wanted, anything involving the alarm or the monster, but I knew it was time to go back and hide. So, I ran, I ran as fast as I could, but I felt the rumbling behind me. 

Before I knew it, I was being lifted into the air. Looking eye to eye with the creature. It created what my mind made out to be a grin, and slowly started picking away at my skin. I screamed, and I screamed loudly. Hoping that maybe someone else had snuck out their bedroom window and would somehow save me from this thing that was skinning me alive and eating every last piece. 

Then, I was thrown to the side. The grass felt like blades on my bare-boned body. I crawled, it felt like going to the ends of the Earth while I looked for my home. I banged and banged on the door. They wouldn’t answer. It was the rules. I still had 20 minutes left until midnight and no one was coming to save me. I laid down in a nearby patch of grass, watching as the monsters fled.

As I prepared for my final breaths, I saw the flashlights. People were approaching me. 

“Looks like someone saw them, sir,” a man said. He was wearing some sort of body armor that I didn’t recognize through my cloudy vision. 

“Take him. We only have twenty minutes to clean up the streets, keep him alive. You know *they* like their food alive.” 

They were military of some form–cleaning up after the monsters. Most of the monsters willingly got into the cargo trucks. When I was thrown onto the "trash" truck, I saw the others. Anyone who had seen one of the monsters was just like me: skinned, barely alive–not even enough energy to scream in pain, as every pothole we hit bounced us. I was much better off than most of the others, some of them had no skin at all, some not alive. I was "lucky" enough to catch the least of them. I could only assume that the *they* mentioned is the monsters. The truth had to be that the government released these things every 4 years as population control- survival of the fittest or some shit.

I had no idea where they were taking us, but I knew that I’d never see my family again.

I'm writing this from within the walls of some government building. I hope this message reaches someone.
