The Johnson family had just moved into their new home, a beautiful, remodeled home with a grand entrance and a sprawling lawn. They were excited to start their new life, and they spent weeks unpacking and decorating. But there was something strange about the house that they couldn't quite put their finger on.

It started with a door. The first time they noticed it was in the hallway. It was an old wooden door with intricate carvings, and they assumed it led to a storage space or a closet. They tried to open the door but, found that the handle was missing. They left the door alone and continued to unpack figuring, they would investigate it in the morning.

The next day, the door was gone. There was no sign of it in the hallway or anywhere else in the house. They searched the entire place, but there was no trace of the door. Tired and exhausted they shrugged it off thinking they may have been imagining the door with no handle after all it the placing didn’t make sense.

But then the door started appearing and disappearing at random places around the house. Sometimes it would be in the living room, other times in the master bedroom. And every time they tried to open it, the handle would be gone. The family was starting to become scared and concerned about the door.

One day, they were sitting in the living room when the door appeared in front of them. This time it was open. Inside they could see a dark, shadowy space beyond. They hesitated for a moment, but then curiosity got the better of them. They stepped through the door and what they found on the other side was beyond anything they could have imagined.

The room was dark and foreboding, and they could hear strange cries coming from the distance. The walls were made of flesh, and strange, writhing tendrils snaked through the space. They tried to step back through the door, but to their horror it was gone.

They stumbled through the pulsating fleshy room, calling out for help, but no one answered. The whispers grew louder, and the shadows seemed to be closing in on them. And then, they saw it. The door. It was back, just as suddenly as it had disappeared. They rushed towards it, desperate to escape.

But when they stepped through the door, they realized they were in a similar area which looked like the inside of a living being. The air was thick with the stench of decay. The door disappeared as the flesh surrounding the walls consumed it. They tried to run, but the walls seemed to be trapping them, pushing them forward. The Johnsons realized they were inside a creature, the house like an angler fish with its light had lured them with the door.

As they wandered through the living, breathing nightmare, they heard a voice. It was the voice of a person who claimed was owner of the house, a man who had disappeared without a trace just a few months ago. He explained how the house was ancient, it had been at the same locations for thousands of years. The exterior changes but the house is always the same. In the past there was a group that worshipped the house and it fed of human sacrifices. Now the house has evolved to feed itself.

The Johnsons knew they had to find a way out, moving forward they left the previous owner. As they reached a dead end, they noticed the bodies absorbed by the house. Their bodies stuck inside of the walls, their eyes moving but their bodies standing still, only their cries could be heard.

The walls started to constrict, the Johnsons screamed in terror, as the house started to consume them, absorbing their life force until they too became part of the walls. From the corner of their eye, they noticed a door come out of the house’s fleshy walls.  The door standing still waiting for its next victim.
