My wife adopted a stray cat a few weeks ago. I didn’t think it was the right call at the time considering we had just had our first child a few weeks prior to that, but my wife fell in love with it and convinced me to let it stay. 

We had no idea, at least I didn’t, that the friggin’ thing was pregnant itself. So yep. A short while after that along comes Lulu the calico kitten. 

The mom, Scarlet, was ultra protective of it. 

It was a regular thing to come from work to see my wife and our son Eric napping on the couch with Scarlet and Lulu right next to them. I became pretty fond of it to be honest. 

The cats weren’t messy, or demanding. They made my wife happy and so that made me happy. 

Then I made a terrible mistake. 

I came home from a 16 hour shift and there they were cuddled up on the couch with the Netflix selection on. So I grabbed a couple beers and sucked them down and plopped down beside them to watch a flick and relax. 

Lulu woke up from her cat nap and snuck over to my lap and as we got comfy my eyes got heavy. 

By the time I woke up it was too late. 

I had rolled over onto Lulu and suffocated her. 

I felt horrendous. 

It was one of those “Oh my God no no no!” moments where the consequences of your actions haven’t sank in yet. 

My wife woke up to seeing me frantically rubbing Lulu trying to bring some life back into her when all Hell broke loose. 

Not only was she freaking out at me, Scarlet went ballistic as well. I felt like the world’s hugest asshole. I tried telling her it was an accident and that I just fell asleep but my wife went off on this tangent almost accusing me of doing it on purpose.

Which I would never do. I love animals. It was a complete freak accident. 

So after I settled Eric down from all the screaming I took Lulu out in the back yard and buried her. 

My wife was so overwhelmed she was going into hysterics. Scarlet was pacing at the door wailing so loudly it sounded like a human being was being butchered in our kitchen. 

Finally the ordeal was over and I went off to bed. My wife had passed out from the sheer exhaustion of her episode and I had to put Scarlet in the basement just to get some quiet to be able to sleep. 

The next morning wasn’t any better. 

Before I left for work I went to Eric’s crib to tell him goodbye and give him a kiss and I found Scarlet sitting in the crib with him. Just staring at him very creepily. 

I had told my wife about this and her response was “Well what do you expect? You took her only child from her. Don’t you think she wants to be around ours for grief sake?”

To me that sounded like looney tunes crap, but I let it roll off and went to work. I wasn’t in the mood for the passive aggressive blame game bullshit. I said to her it was an accident and that “I’m sorry, but the damn cat stays out of the crib or it’s gone for good.”

It was the most insane thing I’d ever seen but my wife actually hissed at me in response as she was holding Scarlet and I swear that it looked like that cat was gloating, or egging it on. 

Thank God I forgot my locker key at home. 

I had made it maybe 20 minutes down the road when I remembered and turned around. 

When I went into the house and called for my wife she didnt answer, but I heard Eric crying from what sounded like the back yard. 

When I looked I saw my wife and Scarlet huddled around something. 

When I walked up to check it out she had dug a hole next to Lulu’s grave and put Eric in it! 

He was bawling and half covered in dirt when I pushed her out of the way and pulled him out of the hole. 

“No! No you murdering bastard! Lulu wants to see Eric and you’re not going to stop her!” My wife screamed at me. 

At the same time I bent to pick up my son, Scarlet jumped onto my back and left two huge scratch marks down my back. 

I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. 

I still can’t believe it. 

I took the boy into the house after having to shove my wife onto the ground with my free hand to get away and locked us in his room. 

Now my wife is outside Eric’s bedroom door beating on it with a rolling pin from the kitchen saying “Let Lulu see Eric you mother fucker! I’ll fucking kill you if you don’t open this door! Scarlet Says that Lulu wants to see that fucking brat right now!”

And I can hear that damn cat carrying on. Ripping shit up and wailing. 

Every few seconds my wife runs away and I can her loud banging on something metal in our bedroom. I think she’s going the .45 in my lock box.

I don’t know what to do. I keep getting a busy signal for 911. A fucking busy signal! 

If she gets that box open before the cops get here she’s going to kill me or I’m going to have to do something to stop her. 

My God what’s going on????
