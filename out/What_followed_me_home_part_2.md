The two police officers looked at each other both with eyebrows raised. I continued on suddenly unable to stop myself from talking.

“I left the scene before the police came, I didn't try and help, I knew they were both dead and I had no wish to talk to a police officer about what I'd just seen. I put the entire thing down to some sort of traumatic reaction, a hallucination of some sort. 

I couldn't sleep that night I lay there thinking about the thing I'd seen, question after question attacked my thoughts and yet there was nothing I could do to find the answers. The next day the crash was all over the local news, with reporters making observations about the two people in the car. The police had roped off the scene but you could still see remnants of the crash cast over the pavement. 

More thoughts of the creature came into my head and I was lost again to memories of the previous day, eventually I must have fallen asleep.  I awoke with the street lights coming in through the windows. I glanced at the clock and realised it was after midnight now.  I went over to the window to close the curtains. I gazed out and saw that the street was entirely empty, no surprise at this time of night, it was hardly the centre of town. My eyes fell on the street lamp and the unusual shadow that was being cast underneath it, I moved closer to the window, my nose pressed up against the glass and stared down. 

My heart caught in my throat, I could feel the pounding in my chest as my pulse quickened, below me was the creature, slowly it moved a few paces past the street light and back again. Its movement set me on edge, it differed from the day before it moved quicker than I had seen, skittered almost, in a jerky fashion, it's impossible limbs still working in ways that should have snapped them. 

It paused and I took a sharp intake of breath as its head tilted up to look into the window, it slowly beckoned me with its wiry finger cutting through the air.  I was aghast as my feet started moving towards the door to my apartment. There was no will strong enough to stop it from happening and I found myself internally screaming to grip on to anything that may stop me from moving forward.  Instead my hand reached out and took the only thing that was on the table by the door.  


At that point I knew it was impossible to stop myself and I gave in to the force that pushed me forward.  I felt a small wave of euphoria rush up inside me at the same time as I gave in and I relished it. I stepped outside into the night and was abruptly stopped in my tracks. 

The creature did not look at me this time, not properly, its head slightly bowed, I averted my gaze a little and I saw it shift slightly in response. I knew what would happen if it looked at me and because of that I made sure to keep my eyes low and aimed at the ground, I saw it move ahead of me and I followed at the pace it allowed me to keep. 

We wandered for a while the creature leading probably 8 ft in front of me at all times, it never looked back, I took in more of its form as we walked, the way its spine curved, how its bones stuck out almost too tight against its thin, leathery, scar ridden skin. 

Eventually it led me to a rather destitute part of town.  The weather had also taken an appropriate turn  and there was now a thin layer of fog between me and the creature. We walked on until angry voices sliced through the air and we used them to lead us down a dirty alleyway used for rubbish.  Suddenly my feet were planted to the spot again and I saw the monster stalk off further into the darkness. 

A few more steps took my brain by surprise,  but as I walked on I saw the fog had lifted and I could make out two shadowy figures arguing.  You could tell by the way they both slurred their words they were intoxicated, both adamant the other had somehow “done them over”.  I quickly ascertained these men were homeless and fighting over something they had stolen. 

My eyes so involved in the scene playing out in front of me, I almost forgot about what had brought me there to begin with. Out the corner of my eye I saw a long-limbed shadow move from behind a stairwell.  


One man pulled a knife on the other .He quickly plunged the blade into the man’s side and twisted.  There was a small scuffle and the blade was turned onto the attacker. The victim managed to cut the attacker on the inside of his thigh.  This did not stop the man, instead it spurred him on to become more violent. Yet this time the knife reached the victims neck and he fell to the floor, a look of shock still etched on his face.  


But the attacker did not lean down or strip the man of any possessions, instead he laughed and kicked the man's corpse before trying to stumble off, the knife wound leaving a thin trail of blood behind him as he tried to leave the scene. 

The monster took no time at all to close in on the man, I felt time slow again, I watched how gracefully the creature moved towards its victim, the justness of the situation outweighing any problems I may have had about an innocent man dying this way.


  I watched as the creature gripped the man's legs and pulled him down to the ground,  the full weight of the monster bearing down on him, slowly working its way up the man's back.  He was trying to fight, attempting to turn, to possibly fight off his attacker, and the creature let him. 

It loosened its grip and the man gasping for air rolled over on the dirty ground. His face had the same look of shock as the man he had just brutally murdered.  The creature clamped the attacker's arms down by his sides and looked at the man with the same empty sockets I had stared into myself.


I understood the euphoria and the pain that followed.  The man went limp and the creature took one finger and etched a deep line into the man’s leg. Blood immediately began to drip onto the road and the homeless man came round a little to see the creatures face a few inches from his own. It widened the gruesome tear that formed its mouth and this time I could see it smile as it forced the man's mouth open. 

I awoke back in my apartment the next morning desperately trying to convince myself this was all just a dream, yet I couldn’t, the illusion was over the second I went to take a shower and realised the bottom of my feet were caked in someone else’s blood
