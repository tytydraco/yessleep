Unfortunately I never had the luxury of living in a warm country. Where i Was from, sunshine was seen as a miracle. It was raining pretty much all day everyday. However in the past few weeks the weather intensified. Thunderstorms became a common occurrence here and my younger sister who was only 6 years old would be terrified of them. I had the brotherly duty of trying to comfort her during these storms that lasted hours at a time.

I awoke one night the thunder rumbling throughout the sky. I tossed and turned desperately trying to fall back asleep but eventually I decided there was no point in trying. I stumbled out of bed and made my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water. I found my sister in our living room crouched in the corner. I went over and tried to comfort her. Reading her books to her to try calm her down.

After an hour or so she eventually fell back asleep and so I carried her into her bedroom and put her back into bed. I stood at the window watching the rain pour down and seeing the occasional lighting strikes. Her bedroom window had a great view to a field just behind our house. I sat for a while just watching the rain. It made me feel peaceful. I always hated the rain but for some reason tonight it just made me calm. Just as I was about to leave her room a lighting bolt struck the ground lighting up the sky. 

My heart almost stopped as the sky lit up and for the first time I saw it... this giant creature. It was miles tall, miles wide and had big piercing red eyes. It walked on all fours with big skinny legs, it's ribcage was visible through its dark skin and as my eyes layed onto it, its head turned in my direction. Another lightning bolt struck the ground and as the sky faded into darkness it was gone. I rushed back to my room and hid under my covers. 

The sense of comfort from the rain and thunder was far gone. It was just panic and terror with every raindrop. I sat in bed rocking back and forth with my head in my hands. I don't know how long I was there however I awoke the next morning to an unusual sight. Rays of sun hit my face, blinding me as my eyes drifted open. I rushed downstairs to my family all out in the garden. 

The rain from the night before mixed with the sun gave an earthy smell to the air. I had almost forgot all about the creature I saw until we all heard a deafening roar of thunder. Confusion washed over my face as there wasn't a single cloud in the sky. We continued to sit outside for another hour or so when I told my parents I was going to meet up with my friend. 

I took my bike and cycled to his house and off we went. There was a small bike trail not to far from us so we quickly made our way over. Thankfully the trail wasn't too muddy, there were puddles of water in areas the trail sunk into the ground but apart from that it was in good condition. We cycled round for a few laps before my friend stopped and stared into the forest. 

"Hey, check that out.. look at the trees." He shouted over to me

As I turned my head I noticed some of the trees had been knocked down. There were no axe marks either I mean it was as if someone pulled the trees from the ground keeping the roots intact. We hesitatingly made our way over to the forest and cycled inside. We made our way to opening in the trees where we found a gigantic hole in the ground. I took a step to the edge and peered down. The hole went on for what seemed like forever. You couldn't see the bottom. 

As I was peering down the hole I felt a drop of water hit my head. I looked up and it was beginning to rain. My friend got back on his bike and started cycling off. I took one last look down the hole but something was different... I could see the outline of something, I couldn't make out what it was but it soon started to move. I grabbed my bike and cycled home as fast as I could.

The rain began to get heavier and heavier on the way home and shortly after the thunder started. I had to take a shortcut home that led through a path surrounded by trees. As I approached the end of the path lightning struck a nearby tree causing it to fall infront of me. I squeezed the brakes and fell of my bike. I must have hit my head off of a rock because the next thing I knew I was opening my eyes with excruciating pain running laps around my head. My bike and my clothes were all covered in mud. I stumbled to my feet, My vision was blurry and my legs were weak. I tried to pick up my bike but I was too weak.

I sat down on a nearby rock and as I help my head in my hands once again I felt a huge gust of wind blow past me. I turned my head only to be faced by this black, slimy wall. I looked up and my heart sank as I faced with those piercing red eyes once again. The creature was back and it was looking right at me. I tried to scream but nothing came out. I tried to run but my legs wouldn't budge. I just sat, staring into those big red eyes.

It lifted its head and continued to walk along. Every time its foot landed on the ground a lightning bolt would strike somewhere nearby. And with every breath caused a roar of thunder. I gather all the courage I could and ran home. My parents were waiting in the living room and I explained what happened. They just thought I hit my head a little too hard and sent me off to bed.

The next morning I had a slight headache, we went to go visit my grandfather who was in a nursing home. He never said much when we went to visit. We were there for a few hours and I decided to stay behind. He normally just sits still, barely moving and so I decided to tell him what happened. I told him about the creature. The eyes, the thunder and lightning syncing with its movements. He turned his head to me and grabbed my arms. I've never seen him like this, he told me to be careful.

I asked what he was talking about and he began to explain.

"When I was a Boy, the rain was never an issue. It was always sunny, life was thriving. Until one day I stumbled across a strange rock. As I approached it began to rock back and fourth until it split open. It was an egg. I don't know what I expected to crawl out.. but it was the creature you described. Eyes glowing red. Staring right at me. It let out a screech that almost deafened me and as it did, rain fell from the sky. This... thing... crawled away from me and dug into the ground. Ever since that day it's been constant thunderstorms."

I left my grandfather there and headed home right away. I found an old photo album and took out a picture of my grandfather as a child. I walked over to that hole I found the day before and threw the picture into it. The ground suddenly started to shake. I looked down the hole once again to be met with that face staring right at me. It's long legs sprung out of the hole onto the grass and it slowly emerged in all its glory. This wasn't a dangerous creature. Its lonely. My grandfather was the only face it ever saw before mine.

I reached my hand out and the creature came closer. I pressed my hand gently onto it's head and it closed its eyes. As it's eyes cracked open they were no longer red. I was met with big blue eyes. The rain around us came to a halt. The creature slowly sank back into the hole and that was one of the last times I ever saw it...

I grew up. I got a job, bought my own house, found an amazing with and had the cutest baby boy in the world. One night I awoke to the rain hitting on my window. I got out of bed and stood next to the window. I couldn't see much. Matter of fact I couldn't see at all. Suddenly, that same familiar roar of thunder rung through my ears. As it did, the glowing red eyes emerged only meters infront of me.

Hes back...
