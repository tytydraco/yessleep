The woods in Surrey had always felt like a second home to me. There was something timeless about their stillness, a quiet older than cities and men. Whenever life inched too close to unbearable, I’d lace up my boots and wander beneath those ancient boughs until my mind quieted. That December afternoon, with its slate-grey skies and biting cold, seemed like the perfect time to escape.

I parked at the usual spot, near the edge of the forest, and made my way in. My debts, my worries - everything seemed to shrink as I stepped deeper into the woods. The paths here were familiar, well-trodden. I knew every fork and clearing, every bend in the trails. Or at least, I thought I did.

The first hour passed uneventfully. The air was crisp, and the skeletal branches above stretched out like veins against the sky. The world was quiet except for the rustling of leaves and the occasional snap of a twig beneath my boots. But as I moved further in, the forest began to change.

The trees grew closer together, their trunks dark and gnarled, as if twisted by some unseen force. The sunlight, already faint, struggled to penetrate the canopy, casting everything in dim, shadowy hues. The air, once fresh and bracing, turned thick and damp, carrying with it a faint metallic tang that I couldn’t place.

It was then that I noticed the path.

At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light, a game played by shadows and leaves. But as I approached, there was no mistaking it: a narrow, winding trail cutting through the underbrush, its stones worn smooth by countless steps.

I stopped, frowning. This path wasn’t on any of the maps I’d studied, nor had I ever come across it before. It looked ancient, older than the forest itself, as though it had been carved into the earth by hands long forgotten.

I hesitated. Everything about it felt wrong, out of place. But curiosity has a way of overriding caution, and before I knew it, I was stepping onto the path.

The deeper I went, the stranger it became. The usual sounds of the forest - the birds, the wind, the distant hum of civilization - faded into silence. It wasn’t the comforting silence I sought on my walks, but a heavy, oppressive stillness that seemed to press against my ears.

As I walked, I noticed other things too. The trees lining the path were different from the others in the forest. Their bark was dark and smooth, almost like polished stone, and their branches hung low, as if weighed down by some invisible burden. The metallic smell grew stronger, and with it came a faint vibration underfoot, like the pulse of a living thing.

I checked my phone. No signal. Not unusual this deep in the woods, but the lack of connection added to my growing unease. Still, I pressed on, the compulsion to see where the path led stronger than my instincts to turn back.

Time lost meaning as I walked. The grey light overhead never seemed to shift, and the chill in the air remained constant, unyielding. My legs ached, and my breath came in heavy puffs, but I couldn’t bring myself to stop. It was as though the path itself was pulling me forward, drawing me deeper into its embrace.

Then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the forest opened up, and I found myself standing at the edge of a clearing.

The village was… wrong.

It sat nestled in the hollow like something out of a history book, its timber-framed houses leaning at odd angles, their thatched roofs sagging under the weight of age. A cobbled square lay at its center, dominated by a tall stone church with a crumbling steeple. Smoke rose from chimneys, curling into the still air, yet no sound or movement came from the houses.

For a moment, I stood frozen, the weight of the silence pressing down on me. Then I called out, my voice unnaturally loud in the stillness.

“Hello?”

The sound echoed through the clearing, bouncing off the crooked houses and fading into the woods behind me.

Nothing.

I took a cautious step forward, then another. As I neared the edge of the village, a door creaked open. My heart leapt into my throat as a figure emerged, his silhouette framed by the dim light inside.

The man was tall and thin, his skin pale and sallow, as though he hadn’t seen sunlight in years. He wore roughspun clothes - breeches, a loose shirt, and a wide-brimmed hat - that looked like they belonged to another century. His eyes were sunken, shadowed, but his smile was warm, almost too warm.

“Welcome, traveler,” he said, his voice lilting and strange. “You must be cold. Come, we’ll find you some supper.”

I hesitated, every instinct screaming at me to turn back, to run. But the man’s smile was disarming, and the thought of warmth and food after hours in the cold was tempting. Against my better judgment, I stepped forward.

As I crossed the threshold into the village, an odd sensation washed over me. The air seemed thicker, heavier, and my ears popped as though I’d crossed into some higher altitude. I glanced back at the path I’d come from, but the forest beyond seemed darker now, almost impenetrable.

The man, who introduced himself as Elias, led me to one of the houses. Inside, a fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the walls. The furniture was sparse but well-made, the kind of craftsmanship you’d expect to find in a museum. Elias poured me a drink from a clay jug, the liquid sweet and spiced, though its aftertaste carried something metallic.

Others began to arrive as the evening wore on. Men and women, all dressed in the same antiquated fashion, their faces pale and distant. They asked me questions about the outside world - what year it was, how far I had traveled, what news I carried. Their curiosity was intense but detached, as though the answers mattered less than the act of asking.

I asked my own questions in return: How old was the village? Why wasn’t it on any map? How had they lived here so long without modern conveniences? Their answers were vague, evasive, as though they didn’t fully understand the questions.

It wasn’t until I stood to leave that the unease blossomed into full-blown terror.

“You can’t go,” Elias said, his voice soft but firm.

I turned to him, frowning. “What do you mean?”

“The woods are dangerous at night,” he replied, that warm smile returning. “It’s best you stay until morning.”

“I appreciate the hospitality,” I said, moving toward the door, “but I should get back before it gets too dark.”

I reached for the latch and froze.

The door wouldn’t budge.

I tried again, pulling harder this time, but it was as though the door had fused to the frame. Behind me, the villagers watched in silence, their expressions unreadable.

“You can’t leave,” Elias said again, his smile widening unnaturally. “Not unless someone takes your place.”
