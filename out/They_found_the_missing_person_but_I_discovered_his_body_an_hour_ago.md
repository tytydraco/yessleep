I'm a detective, I'm posting this here because I fear I might not be around much longer to share what I've uncovered. This all started when my partner and I were called to a residence following a report about a missing person, and a camcorder found in the forest.  
  
When we arrived, we collected the camcorder as evidence, and took the witness’ testimony. Once we got back to the precinct we immediately turned the camcorder over to our evidence team and got to work. A day later, the team who examined the camcorder, every single one of them, disappeared from the precinct without a trace. We tried asking around about them but we got brushed off. Only a few hours later me and my partner received an abrupt order from the higher ups:  
  
DROP THE CASE.  
  
We got no explanations, no nothing. My partner immediately complied and told me to do the same, but I just couldn't let it go.  
  
During my investigation, I went looking in the forest around the house of the missing person. There, I found something that I hoped I wouldn’t. I found the body of the missing person. Poor kid was mutilated almost beyond recognition. The only thing that I could even identify was the distinct chest tattoo, which matched the description given to us by his friend.  
  
It seemed to me, at the time, that he was mauled by a bear. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that we haven’t had bears around here in really long time. Something was terribly off. I couldn’t call for forensics, as I was forced to turn in my radio and badge for the week, so I had no choice but to rush back to the precinct to report the dead body.  
  
But what I saw when I got there, almost made me faint.  
  
He was there, alive and unharmed. It was as if the body I'd just seen was nothing more than the figment of a bad dream. When my eyes met his, he gave me this look that unsettled me extremely. It was this haunting emptiness that he had behind his eyes, and the way they moved around with an almost childlike curiosity, as if everything around him was unfamiliar, and needed to be studied.  
  
I'm writing this as a record, I fear I might be the next one to “disappear”. Lately, I've noticed the same car parked outside my house at late hours. I might be under surveillance. This whole thing is deeper than just some missing kid. The disappearances, the orders from higher ups, all of it reeks and I should’ve smelt the shit a while back but I guess I’m just too stubborn, too damn concerned with playing the hero. From all that I’ve seen I think something real bad is going to happen to me real soon. If you’re reading this, look into Ruhiges Dorf County. But make sure no one can trace back the searches to you.
