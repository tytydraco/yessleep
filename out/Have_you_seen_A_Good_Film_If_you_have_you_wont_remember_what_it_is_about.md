Have you seen a movie called *A Good Film*?

If you have, I’m guessing you don’t remember it.

Nobody in my town does either.  
That’s kind of the point.

I live in a small rural town in Arizona. One of those places where the buildings look sun-bleached and tired. Where the same people walk into the same diner and sit in the same booth, every day. No rush. No change. Nothing ever really happens out here.

People here are the type to stay.  
They graduate, marry their high-school sweetheart, get a job they hate, and die on the same lot of land they were born. And they’re fine with that. No one’s in a hurry to be anything other than what they already are.

Except me.

My name’s Percy. I’m seventeen. And I hate it here. I wish I could be content like everyone around me. I think I would feel a lot more fulfilled if I did.

But I want out.  
Out of the dust, the routine, the same people day after day.  
I want to do something. Be someone. I want to live in a place where there is opportunity. I don’t think that’s too much to ask.

Which is why this event—this *movie*—was such a surprise.

I can excuse a lot of things. A lot of superstitious stuff goes down in towns like this. Haunted hotels. Local legends. That kind of thing.

But this is different. It’s terrifying.

But nobody else seems to care.  
They just laugh it off. Call it a magic trick—a gag. Something they’ll forget and never think about again. An event like this comes and goes and everyone just goes back to the same ol’ routine.

But not me.  
Not after what I’ve seen.

And if you’re reading this, I need to know…

Have you seen it?

*Do you remember anything at all?*

If you have no idea what I am talking about, I wouldn’t be surprised.

Most people are in the same boat as you.

But don’t worry, I’ll explain everything shortly.

It all started with a commercial.  
My dad was slouched in his recliner watching the evening news while I made a sandwich in the kitchen.  
Local channel. Channel 404, I think it was. The news anchor was in the middle of some *gripping* story about an egg shortage. 

Then came a commercial break.

The screen stayed black a little too long.  
Long enough for my dad to grumble, “Did the cable go out again?”

But then—a message.

White text faded in, written in some curly, classical font.

**“Coming to Mountain Rim Theater.”**

There was no music. No narrator.  
The whole thing felt old, like a film reel pulled out of some vintage camera. The footage had scan lines, dust pops—that scratchy noise projectors make when they start up.

More text appeared.

**“Come see ‘A Good Film’”**  
**“You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll never remember what you saw!”**

That was it.

No trailer. No plot. No rating. Just that one strange promise.  
**You’ll never remember what you saw.**

Then it cut back to the news, like nothing had happened.

At first I thought it was a joke. 

A Good Film? That is the title? They can’t be serious.  
But the next day, it aired again. Same thing.  
Then again. Twice a day.  
Then every hour, on the hour.  
Same scratchy black and white message.  
Same unsettling quiet.

Soon enough, the whole town was talking about it. Everyone wanted to see ‘A Good Film.’

I figured people had something to say about it online. I pulled out my phone and did a quick search.

Nothing.

No official website. No showtimes online. No movie database entries. Not even a Reddit post.  
It was like the film only existed *here*.

People around town thought it was hilarious.

My friend Charlie said he went on opening night.  
Said the place was pretty booked. Everyone there saw the advertisement and wanted to see for themselves. He remembers sitting down and seeing what he called a “goofy intro.” Looked like one of those silent films we learned about in film studies. Black and white. Flashcards for dialogue.

Then—boom—he was outside.

That’s how he described it.  
One second he’s watching an old-timey intro.  
The next, he’s standing in the lobby. Laughing with strangers.

“Didn’t that weird you out?” I asked.

Charlie shrugged. “I don’t know. It’s like a dream or surgery or something. You know—like, antiseptic.”

“Anesthetic,” I corrected.

I loved Charlie. But my god was he dull.

“Yeah, yeah. Whatever. It’s not a big deal. Just a magic trick. It’s fun!”

You sit down. You watch. You leave.  
And you forget.

Brighter minds than Charlie called it performance art. A postmodern meta-stunt.  
Some ‘elevated cinema’ thing.  
Nobody was scared.  
Nobody asked questions.

Except me.

I asked my teachers.  
The grocery store clerk.  
Even Big Dave—the guy who makes moonshine in his garage.

They all said the same thing:

**“You should go see it for yourself.”**  
**“It’s fun.”**  
**“You’re taking it too seriously.”**

So I did.

Friday night. 9:30pm showing.  
Mountain Rim Theater.

The walk to the theater was short, but it felt longer that night. The sun had already dipped behind the mountains, and the strip mall lights flickered like they were shorting out.

Mountain Rim Theater sat at the end of a half-empty lot. A crumbling building with three movie posters in rusted frames, one of them blank.

I could hear the hum of the marquee before I saw it. It was missing a few letters as usual. 

‘A G\_OD FILM' in big black letters hovered just above the ticket counter.

I walked up to the ticket window. The line was surprisingly long for a late showing.

I pay in cash and step inside.  
The theater was half-full when I entered. Mostly locals. They talk in low voices and crunch popcorn, waiting for the usual trailers to roll.

But when the lights finally dimmed, it was different.  
No ads. No music.

The screen blinks white, then an old-timey title card fills the silver screen:

**“Presenting…A Good Film.”**

It looks like a reel from the 1950s—faded, jittery, charming.

Then something drops in from the top of the frame.  
A man?

He lands hard on invisible floor, limbs limp, palms flat. A slapstick entrance. The audience chuckles. I don’t.

His outfit is pure mime cliché. He dons a tight blazer of thick black and white stripes, narrow lapels, and pearl buttons. It’s too clean, too perfect, as if it’s been ironed onto his skin. White gloves cover his long, thin fingers. His pants match his jacket.

The makeup on his face is heavy and cakey. Chalky white, layered thick, cracking at the edges of his mouth. His lips are painted black and pulled into a permanent smile that never quite reaches his eyes. The eyes are the worst part—circles of matte black that swallow any light. No lashes. No gleam. Just pits in his face.

He dusts himself off with sharp, exaggerated flicks. Then he straightens, clicks his heels together, and bows.

From the right edge of the screen, a stack of giant flashcards sails into view. He snatches them out of the air—gloved fingers snapping shut with a loud clap. The cards are bright white and almost poster-sized with bold black letters centered in each frame.

He flips the first card towards the audience.

**“STARRING: BRAD PITT.”**

The mime gasps, ruffles his hair, and flexes a bicep in a cheesy imitation of the renowned actor.

Card two.

**“LEONARDO DICAPRIO.”**

He clutches an imaginary Oscar and mouths a silent thank-you.

Card three.

**“MARLON BRANDO.”**

He puffs out his gut, tugs at invisible suspenders, and mimes puffing a cigar. The audience laughs behind me. Someone whispers, “Now that’s a cast.”

The cards keep coming. Half the names are real, half nonsense.

**“JANE DOE.”**  
**“TOM HANKS.”**  
**“GRANDMA BETTY.”**

With each reveal he acts out a caricature. The sketch is goofy and harmless. I’ll admit, even I thought it was a clever gimmick.

An all-star cast for a movie you won’t even remember watching.

Then it stops.

Mid-gesture, his arms drop. Gloves hang limp at his sides. The smile on his face collapses into a blank line. His head tilts, eyes fixed on us—or maybe behind us. Every inch of him is slack—like a marionette with the strings clipped mid-performance.

The hair on my arms stood straight up.

Uneasy murmurs ripple through the theater.

After a few more unsettling moments, the screen goes black.

No music. No picture. Just darkness thick enough to swallow the sun.  
A low hum rises, deep and steady, like a generator buried under the floorboards.

After what feels like a full minute, a single word appears in stark white letters:

**ENJOY.**

The hum stops.

My stomach tightened. I felt like I was bracing at the top of a rollercoaster just before the big drop.

The world goes blank.

And then—

I was outside.

Standing near the theater doors.  
People walked past me, laughing, chattering, and disposing of uneaten popcorn buckets.

I touched my face. I was…smiling.

I felt content.

But I didn’t know why.

My hands were shaking.  
It wasn’t exactly fear. This was more like confusion. Like something had been taken from me. My body reacting to something it couldn't understand.

I tried to remember what I saw.

Nothing.  
Not a single frame. Not a sound.  
The final word ringing in my head.

*Enjoy.*

I heard bits of pieces of other audience member’s conversations as they passed me.

“What part was your favorite?” someone asked.

“I…honestly have no idea.” 

Another woman laughed and said, “I didn’t expect Brad Pitt to do...you know, that thing in the movie!”

They all laughed and continued on their way. It was just an inside joke to them. A crazy experience.

I needed answers.  
Found a kid working the ticket counter.

“You ever seen the movie?” I asked him.

He shrugged.

“Yeah, I’ve seen it. Pretty good—I think. I dunno. Everyone seems to like it.”

“But you don’t remember anything about it?”

He laughed. “Nope. Nobody does—didn’t you see the ads?”

“Doesn’t that freak you out?”

“No, not really. You ever seen a hypnotist? I went to a show on a vacation with my parents last summer. Just kinda feels like that.”

I started to back away from the counter. My head started to feel dizzy.

How is everyone so calm? Why am I the only one so freaked out about this?

I peeked back into the empty theater I apparently just walked out of.

Nothing looked out of place. Just an empty theater. A few workers cleaning up here and there.

I don’t know what happened to me.

And whatever it was, it wasn’t over.

A few days passed.  
But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had happened in that theater.  
Something worse than not remembering.  
Something evil hiding behind that word.

**Enjoy.**

It wouldn’t leave me alone.  
It flashed behind my eyelids every time I tried to sleep—like a neon marquee burned into my eyelids.  
Sometimes I’d hear the hum again, faint and low, coming from beneath my floorboards.  
The same hum from the theater.  
The same one that came *right before* the blackout.

Everyone else moved on.  
Back to work. Back to school. Back to forgetting.  
I’d ask my friends about it—just casually.  
They’d smile and say, “Oh, yeah! That was fun,” and then go back to doing whatever they were doing.  
Like it was a dream they had already forgotten.

Some part of them knew this wasn’t something harmless. They knew deep down it was wrong. Maybe it was just easier that way. If you can’t do anything about it, you might as well let it go.

That’s how things go in this town.  
Something strange happens?  
You ignore it.  
You let it fade.

But I couldn’t let it go.  
I couldn’t stop thinking about that word.  
About the mime’s dead stare.  
About how I woke up smiling when I didn’t even remember what I was smiling about.

I wanted to be like them.  
I *tried* to be.  
But every time I closed my eyes, I thought I’d open them again to find myself back in that hallway—right outside the theater doors.

I started to wonder if this is how it begins for people like me.  
The ones who don’t let go.  
The ones who poke at things they’re not supposed to.

Some slow unraveling.  
A thought you can’t shake.  
A sound that follows you.  
A word that burns itself into the back of your brain.

It was the *not knowing* that tore at me.  
The empty space where a memory should’ve been.  
I needed to fill it.  
I needed to understand.

So I made a plan.

Go back.  
Sit through the intro again.  
And this time…I’ll keep my eyes closed.

The kid from the theater got me thinking—maybe it is some kind of hypnosis. Maybe there’s some code playing onscreen that brings on some form of temporary amnesia. I may not be able to look at it, but I can listen.

Monday. 9:30pm showing again.

I sat in the same seat. Fourth row from the back, center aisle.  
Not too close. Not too far.

The room filled in around me. Different faces of course. But I could feel the same relaxed and curious energy.

No trailers. No music. Just the projector warming up.  
The screen lit up.

Title cards. Black and white again. The same fake cast list. Someone snorted behind me as it rolled.

Then—

The final card.

*ENJOY.*

I shut my eyes quickly.

Silence.

Not just from the film.  
Real silence. No movement in the theater. No crunching of popcorn or slurping from plastic cups.

At first, I thought I could hear breathing.  
Soft. Rhythmic.  
A whole room of people inhaling at the same time.

In, and out.

It was hypnotic. Like a wave. Everyone breathing in unison. I had my eyes closed, but I could feel their focus. All of them staring at the same mysterious screen.

Then the static started.

It came on slow. Like a TV warming up. A low crackle from somewhere deep in the walls.

Then it hit.  
All at once.

Deafening.

A wall of sound crashed over me from all around—sharp and crackling.  
I jumped in my seat the moment it hit me.

I clenched my fist against the hard plastic armrest.

Then, it changed.

It got quieter, then louder again. Sharper, then duller.  
It was being tuned, like it was narrowing in on something.

I was so tempted to open my eyes, but a new sound shook the thought from my mind as quickly as it came.

It was hard to hear through the faint static, but I knew for sure it was there.

I heard stirring above me.

Something was moving.

It scraped across the ceiling—slow at first. Then faster.  
Like it was crawling along the panels somehow.

It didn’t sound mechanical.  
It sounded…wet. Organic. But heavy.

Each step thudded, followed by a hiss or click.

The sound started somewhere near the front of the theater. I couldn’t know for sure, but it was almost as if the thing crawled right out of the silver screen itself.

The thudding sounds grew closer and closer overhead. 

It was maybe five rows in front of me.

Then two.

Then it stopped.

It was right above me now.

I held my breath. My whole body locked up.

The static began to fade.

Silence again.

But only for a few seconds.

Suddenly, a laugh broke out from one of the audience members.

One voice. A high-pitched giggle near the front.

Then another.

Then all of them.

The room exploded.

Laughter from every direction. Dozens of voices.  
Full, hearty belly-laughs like a comedy was playing.

The laughter didn’t stop.

It kept rising. Cracking.  
It got frantic. Hysterical.

People started coughing mid-laugh.  
I heard someone gasping like they were choking.

A retching sound came from the far left.

What began as something joyful quickly turned sinister. It seemed nobody could stop laughing—no matter how painful.

I wanted to move but I couldn’t.

The sound was so wrong it made my stomach curl.  
I wanted to rip my ears off just to make it stop.

Above me, the thing shifted again.

It was closer now. I could hear it breathing.

No—not breathing.

*Sniffing.*

Short, wet sniffs. Like it was trying to figure me out.

Then the laughing stopped.

Every voice in the room went silent.

I would’ve felt some relief had it not been for the invisible threat looming right in front of me.

I tried keeping still. I prayed the thing would get bored of me. Make its way someplace else.

*This was a bad idea. I shouldn’t have come back here. Maybe I should make a run for it—*

Suddenly, the moaning began.

Low. Guttural. Pained.

A woman let out a high, animalistic wail.  
A man shouted something—his voice cracked halfway through.  
Someone whimpered, begging.

I didn’t understand why they sounded so agonizing. Then I heard another sound.

Something wet. I could hear it everywhere.  
Like skin being peeled. Or shoved back into place. I really couldn’t tell.

The sound came in waves like the moaning. A yell here. A wet tear there. It was torture. It was torture to listen to. I started to retreat into my seat. Whatever was happening could make its way to me at any moment. The only difference between me and everyone else here is I would feel it. I would remember.

I felt sick.

I clamped my hands over my ears but it didn’t help. The sounds were inside me now.

I stayed like that as long as I could.

But it was too much.

I feared if I stayed any longer, I wouldn’t leave this theater.

I stood up.

And everything stopped.

The moaning. The screaming. The sounds.

All gone.

Dead silent.

I fought the urge to open my eyes.  
I needed to get out of here—now.

I felt my way forward.  
Hands brushing seat backs. Shoulders pressed lazily into them.

No one moved.  
No one breathed.

That’s when I noticed it.  
How sticky everything was.

Each step made a wet sound, like I was walking through raw meat.  
My fingers were slick. Dripping.  
I didn’t want to think about what it was.

My hand slipped off a seat back as I shuffled sideways down the row.  
I caught myself, steadied my breathing, and kept going.

It felt like an eternity.

This theater isn’t that big.  
I was seated only a few seats into the row.  
I should’ve reached the aisle by now.

I started counting.  
Ten seats.  
Fifteen.  
Twenty-five.

Still no aisle.

My heartbeat drummed in my ears.  
Was I walking in circles? Was something looping me in-and-out of the same row?

Then—finally, I felt the gap.  
The aisle.

I turned and started inching toward the steps.  
One hand on the cold metal railing—until it wasn’t.

My palm hit a patch of mystery goo and slid straight off.  
I lost my balance.

I hit the ground hard, arms scrambling to catch myself on the slick steps.  
My hand met the floor with a wet smack.

For a second, I almost opened my eyes.  
Thank god I caught myself.

I wiped whatever it was off my hands, pushed myself upright, and reached blindly for the railing again.

That’s when I heard it.

A giggle.

Above me.

It wasn’t human.  
It was too clean. Too high-pitched.  
Like a sound effect from an old tv show.

I froze.

The giggling stopped. The familiar sound of thumping on the ceiling returned.

I started down the aisle.  
It followed me.  
Track by track.  
Step by step.

I put both hands on the railing and forced myself forward.

Almost there.

The thumping was closer.  
So close I could *feel* it.

The ceiling thudded.  
Heavy, deliberate footsteps crawling along the darkness above me.  
Then—

A breath.

Hot and wet across the back of my neck.

I stifled a scream in my throat.  
But I kept moving.  
Eyes still shut—screaming to be opened. Begging to reveal the danger around me.

I turned the corner toward the exit ramp, dragging my hand along the wall to guide myself.

The breath continued.

Closer now.

Then—

A whisper, right into my ear.

I braced for the end.  
For something cold to wrap around my neck.  
To be pulled upwards like a fish on a hook.

But nothing happened.

The air changed.  
Warmth hit my face.

I was outside the theater.

I slowly opened my eyes.

The lobby lights were on.  
I made it.

Before I could even take a moment to catch my breath, I remembered the sounds—wet, slimy, dripping.

I looked down at my body.

I expected the worst—  
Blood. Flesh. Something missing.

But my hands? Clean.  
My shoes? Dry.

Not a single stain.

It looked exactly the same as when I walked in.

It seemed to good to be true.

I turned to glance at the lobby.  
Everything was still.

The showing was still going on, so the hallway outside the auditorium was completely empty.  
Or at least…I thought it was.

I started walking toward the exit doors when I heard it.  
A voice.

“Hey there.”

I stopped and whipped around.

A guy was leaning against one of the empty movie poster frames to my left.  
I hadn’t seen him there before. Clean white shirt, black pants. His hair was slicked back tight, not a strand out of place. He looked like he stepped out of a 50s musical number.

He smiled, unblinking.

“What’d you think?”

I stammered a bit under my breath.  
My thoughts were scrambled, screams and laughter still echoing in my mind.

“What?”

“The movie,” he said.  
“What’d you think about it?”

I took a slow step back.  
“Have…have you seen it?” I asked him shakily.

He gave a casual shrug and took a step toward me.

“You just look a little rattled, is all. Thought maybe something happened in there.”

His tone was light, conversational.  
But something in his eyes didn’t match it.  
They were cold. Fixed. Unblinking.

I felt my whole body tense.

“Well, even if something happened you wouldn’t remember…would you, Percy?”

I needed to leave. Now.

I turned, already halfway to the exit. I hear him speak again not too far behind. Low and sharp.

“Go back and finish the movie, Percy.”

I didn’t think. I just ran.

Through the doors, past the ticket counter, across the parking lot.  
I didn’t stop running until I was back home and locked in my bedroom.

That was the last time I ever stepped foot in Mountain Rim Theater.

That was also the last time anyone saw ‘A Good Film.’

The movie stopped showing the very next day.  
No explanation. No headlines.  
Just…gone.

And honestly, I wish I could say that was the end of it.  
But it’s not.

I thought I needed answers.  
Thought I needed to *understand* what was going on.

But I realize now…that was a mistake.

There’s such a thing as being dangerously curious.  
Some things aren’t meant to be understood.

If I’d stayed in that theater any longer…I don’t think I would’ve come out at all.

So, learn from me.

If *A Good Film* ever shows up at your theater—  
**Don’t go.**

I don’t care how curious you are.  
I don’t care how quirky the ad seems.  
I don’t care if everyone you know says it’s no big deal.

It is.

I don’t know what I saw.  
Nobody does.  
That’s the trick. The curse. The...whatever the hell it is.

You go in.  
You see something.  
And you walk out smiling.

But you don’t know why.  
You never know why.

And if you try to fight it—if you close your eyes and really listen—you’ll hear the truth.

The pained laughter.  
The moans.  
The wet sounds of something tearing and putting itself back together.

I still don’t know what it was.  
That thing on the ceiling.

But I try not to think about it.

Some nights, though, I still hear it.

That low hum.  
That static.  
Those thick, inhuman breaths just above my head.

And sometimes, just as I’m falling asleep, I hear it again.

A soft, menacing giggle.

And a word.

The last thing it whispered in my ear before I ran out of the theater.
