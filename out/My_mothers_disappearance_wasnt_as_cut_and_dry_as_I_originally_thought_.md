*Missing. At least, that’s what the official report said.* 

I shifted in my seat nervously. That’s the story everyone in this town had heard and passed on about my mother for the last fifteen years. Nobody fully bought it, the idea of a forty-something year old woman with a quiet, content life as a mother of two just… leaving in the middle of the night late December, Christmas gifts still wrapped and ham in the freezer waiting to be cooked come the 25th... Everything seemed strange about the case, but it was easier to settle with a lie rather than try digging too far into it. 

*Your father found her.*

*Security footage of the backyard cleared him of suspicion- The figure was grotesquely large, much bigger than your stout, 5’3 dad. It lumbered over her with a steady, trembling pace, nudging her towards the toolshed in the backyard. A steady trail of seemingly blood followed her, the resolution was too low to discern. She entered the shed, the thing following behind- Contorting its body into a more compact shape to fit into the comparatively narrow door. Nobody could be seen exiting, but he only found your mother inside when he checked the shed in the morning.*

*What was left of her, at least.*

*She sat in a chair, bound- Her head split open in half like a bloody pistachio, dried viscera and fragments of skull splattered on and around the wooden throne. Only a portion of her skull’s contents remained, the rest either being missing or splattered on the walls. Her legs had been ripped off, almost as some form of deranged trophy- Splintering off at the calf.  The most striking part was her face, though splintered in two- An unmistakable smile, grim but still faintly tipped with glee- sat plastered upon her lifeless shell.* 

*Forensics found no footprints aside from her own, no fingerprints, not even any instruments (whether missing or new) to enact this carnage- The only thing left behind was a wilted rose sitting on her bloody lap.*

The sheriff drew a deep breath, setting his hat back on his head-- It was hard for me to discern whether a weight had been lifted, or a wound reopened. 

*“I figured that since you’d be leaving Scarlettville for the city tomorrow, you deserved to know the truth.”*

My stomach lurched, my mind feeling hazy and red.

*“Does anyone else-!?”* I started, shock being imprinted like a nail through the skull.

The sheriff interrupted, holding up a fist.

*“Your dad,”* he said, raising a finger, 

*“The mayor at the time,”* another one raised. 

*“And now, you.”* 

He took a long sip of coffee, almost desperate to wash out the taste of confession in his mouth. 

*“And it will stay that way, do you understand?”* 

His previously mournful tone had suddenly adapted to have a mask of intimidation, his withered face no longer seeming too weak to be scary. 

I blinked. Blinked again. There were a thousand thoughts running through my head and a thousand more things I wanted to say and do, but I was frozen in fear and overwhelmed confusion.

*“Do you understand?”* he repeated, a slightly warmer tone but still unmistakably a threat. 

Almost instinctively, the words *“Yes, sir.”* escaped my mouth, pushed out from some deep crevice of my chest too focused on survival to push back against his insistence. 

*“Good.”* He replied as he stood, getting ready to leave. *“I’m sorry that you’re only finding out now, if that’s any consolation. The mayor didn’t want to cause panic at the time.”* 

Mayor Douglas was dead, and had been for six years. Natural causes, seemingly, but one less person who knows regardless. My dad was too, having taken his own life a few months after the “Disappearance”, unable to cope with the loss and inability to talk about the truth. I was 19 when it happened, So I raised my little brother as best I could, dragging him along to therapy sessions and having him play in the play place while I worked at the local McDonald’s. Nothing had ever felt even remotely normal since that day. 

The sheriff picked up his briefcase and walked out the door, seemingly in a hurry to get out. Taking a few moments to compose myself, I started out the door after him to see if I could watch him drive away.

He was long gone, not even leaving tire tracks- but when I looked to the porch planters, I stopped dead in my tracks. 

The roses had suddenly wilted.
