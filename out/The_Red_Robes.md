It was a dark and stormy night in the small village of Tarbaby. 

The villagers were huddled together by the fire, listening to the howling winds outside. Suddenly, the doors of the village hall were blown off their hinges, and a hooded figure entered the village hall. 

The figure was draped in red robes, and their face was completely hidden in shadow. The villagers gasped in shock as the figure approached the firelight, revealing their bloody hands and a sinister-looking dagger.

The villagers watched in horror as the hooded figure crept towards them, holding the bloody dagger in their hand. Suddenly, there was a knock on the village hall door. The hooded figure turned and looked towards the door. 

A moment later, another hooded figure entered the village hall. 

The villagers watched in fear and confusion as the two hooded figures faced each other in the middle of the hall, their identities and motives completely unknown. 

A hush fell over the village as the two figures stood there in the dim light of the fire, their cloaks fluttering in the wind coming through the broken door.

It was silent for a moment as the two hooded figures looked at each other. 

The villagers waited anxiously to see what would happen next. Suddenly, one of the figures spoke in a deep and frightening voice. 

"Do you know who I am?" the figure asked. 

The villagers trembled in fear as the second figure removed their hood, revealing their face. 

The second figure was none other than the village priest! The villagers were shocked and confused. 

How could their priest be a murderer? The first hooded figure smiled as they removed their hood, revealing their face as well.

"It was the village doctor!"

The villagers were even more confused. 

"What was going on?"

The two figures stood before the village assembly and spoke in unison, as if they were both one person.

"We are the sons of death and we have come to deliver all of you from your own fears and superstitions."

The villagers looked at each other nervously, wondering what the two figures meant by their words. 

The figures drew closer to the village assembly, holding their daggers ready.

"Fear us not," they whispered. 

"We are your salvation from the tyranny of this world."

The villagers trembled in fear as the two figures drew closer, the firelight dancing off their blades. 

Some of the villagers ran for safety, while others stood transfixed in place, unable to move.

The figures moved gracefully around the village hall, their cloaks swirling behind them. 

As they reached each person, they touched them with their daggers, muttering the words.

"Be free from fear, be free from the tyranny of this world."

As they came towards the last villager, a young girl, she trembled in fear and turned away from them.

After they had touched each person, there was silence as the villagers looked around in disbelief. 

The firelight flickered faintly, casting long shadows over the faces of the villagers.

Finally, the two figures walked towards the door and exited the village hall. 

The villagers watched them go, stunned and confused.

"What just happened?" one of the villagers asked.

"I don't know," another said quietly. 

"What did those hooded figures mean by being our salvation? Who were they?"

In the end, the villagers were left with more questions than answers. 

Some believed that the two hooded figures were angels sent to deliver them from their fear, while others thought they were demons sent to tempt them.

"The truth?"

That was a mystery the villagers would never truly know.

After the mysterious figures had left, the villagers of Tarbaby spent a restless night, uneasy and scared. But as the sun rose, they realized that everything was just as it had been before.

The village hall was intact and the doors were firmly in place. The fire was still glowing in the center of the room, casting warm light on the faces of the villagers.

The village priest and doctor were also present and had no memory of the previous night. 

They were puzzled when the villagers asked them about what had happened, but had no answers to give.

The villagers of Tarbaby were left with a sense of unease after their strange encounter with the hooded figures. 

But in the end, they couldn't help but wonder if it was all just a dream. 

Even the village priest and doctor had no memory of the previous night, making it all the more strange. 

Could the hooded figures have been real, or was it just a figment of the villagers' imagination? 

They would never know for sure.
