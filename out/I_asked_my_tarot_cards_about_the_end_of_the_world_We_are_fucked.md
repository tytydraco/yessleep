I don’t believe in tarot, not in the mystical sense. The cards don’t whisper, don’t pull strings behind the curtain of reality. They don’t know the future. What they do—what I do—is tell stories. And people love stories, especially when they’re about themselves.

Most of my clients don’t want the truth. They want reassurance. They want to be told that their ex will come back, that their business will succeed, that they’ll win the fight they’re afraid of losing. They want validation, a sugar-coated narrative where everything works out.

And I give it to them. Not because I’m a fraud, but because it’s what they need to hear.

That’s why I noticed him the second he walked in.

The man didn’t hesitate at the threshold, didn’t browse the shelves lined with incense and cheap crystals. He moved with the kind of deliberate control that made my skin crawl. He was tall, gaunt, with sharp features and sharper eyes. His clothes were unremarkable—pressed slacks, a plain dark coat—but everything about him felt too composed, like he was wearing a disguise made of normalcy.

He sat down across from me without a word, folding his hands neatly on the table. I waited for the usual: love, money, success. But he just tilted his head slightly, watching me the way a bird watches an insect, and said—

“I’d like to know about the end of the world.”

The request sent a strange shiver through me. Not just because of the words, but because of how he said them. He wasn’t asking out of curiosity, or fear, or desperation. There was no urgency in his voice.

It was like he already knew.

“Not exactly a common reading,” I said, forcing a small laugh.

The man just watched me, unmoving.

I hesitated, then reached for my deck. If this was a joke, I’d play along. If it wasn’t... well, the cards would do what they always did—tell a story.

I shuffled. The cards were worn and familiar against my fingers, their edges softened by years of use. Usually, I let my clients pull their own cards, but before I could ask, three leapt from the deck and landed on the table, facedown.

Past. Present. Future.

Something about the way they landed made my breath hitch. But I pushed the feeling down and flipped the first card.

The Past: The Tower

A ruined tower, crumbling under a black sky. Lightning splitting stone. People falling from its heights, their arms outstretched in silent screams.

Destruction. Upheaval. A warning ignored.

The story was clear—there was a moment when things could have changed. A moment when people had a chance to stop something terrible. But they didn’t. Whether out of fear, selfishness, or simple indifference, they let the opportunity slip away. And now we were living in the fallout.

I exhaled slowly, my fingers suddenly cold.

The man said nothing. Just watched.

I turned over the second card.

The Present: The Hanged Man

A man, suspended upside down. Bound, but serene.

Waiting. Watching. Not acting.

My mouth went dry.

This wasn’t inevitability. It wasn’t some cosmic force pushing events toward disaster. The only reason things weren’t being stopped was because the people who could stop them weren’t. Not because they were powerless—but because they didn’t care enough to try.

The air in the shop felt suddenly wrong, heavy and too still. I glanced at my client, but if he felt anything, he didn’t show it. His expression remained unreadable, his gaze steady and sharp.

I didn’t want to turn over the last card.

But I did.

The Future: Death

A skeletal figure in black armor, astride a pale horse. A banner unfurled in bony hands.

People kneeling. People falling.

There’s a lot of feel-good nonsense about the Death card. People like to say it means transformation, rebirth, a new beginning. But sometimes, it means exactly what it looks like.

This was one of those times.

The instant the card hit the table, something shifted in the air. The temperature dropped. My stomach clenched, my heart pounding against my ribs. I told myself it was just a coincidence, just a story the cards were telling.

But across from me, the man smiled.

Not a smirk, not an amused twitch of the lips. A smile. Small. Satisfied. Like he had just received confirmation of something he already knew.

A strange, creeping wrongness crawled up my spine.

I cleared my throat, forcing my voice to stay even. “That’s... unsettling.”

The man chuckled. “It’s good to have confirmation.”

That was enough. I didn’t want him here anymore. I didn’t want the cards in front of me. I didn’t want to know what the hell he had been looking for in that reading.

“I’m ending the session early,” I said, sweeping the cards back into the deck. “No charge.”

He didn’t argue. He stood smoothly, reached into his coat, and placed a few crisp bills on the table. Too much. More than the cost of the reading.

I stared at the money. When I looked back up, he was already walking toward the door.

But just before stepping outside, he paused.

Turned.

And with that same unreadable smile, he met my gaze and said—

“See you around.”

Then he was gone.


I sat frozen for a long time, staring at the empty doorway.

The air still felt off, like the room itself had inhaled and forgotten to exhale. I swallowed hard, my mouth dry. My hands were cold.

Finally, I forced myself to move. I reached for my deck, ready to put it away—but hesitated.

The Death card was still on the table.

I turned it over, face-down, and pushed the deck aside. Then I grabbed the cash the man had left and shoved it into the drawer beneath my desk. I didn’t count it. I didn’t care.

I just wanted to stop thinking about the feeling that had crept into my bones when I turned over that final card.

I don’t believe in tarot.

Not in the mystical sense.

But that night, I locked up early. I didn’t touch my deck again.
