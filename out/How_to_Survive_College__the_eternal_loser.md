“So we’re fighting a god.  That’s just… *lovely.*”

Cassie’s dire assessment of our situation was how the emergency house meeting started.  For a brief moment I almost corrected her in that Grayson wasn’t really a god and we probably shouldn’t ascribe that status to him and also we weren’t trying to *fight* him, really, just convince him to not go ahead with his whole ‘find a permanent body and that body is Ashley’ plan but then I decided to wisely keep my mouth shut.  Semantics didn’t matter.  We had bigger problems to argue about.

It was just myself, Cassie, and Josh.  I’d wanted to invite Professor Monotone, but we’d all come to the realization that it just wasn’t safe to involve him further.  We thought he’d be fine since the flickering man was gone and he didn’t have something inhuman watching over his shoulder, but we were wrong.

So very wrong.

I spent a good ten minutes or so freaking out over the thought that I’d gotten Professor Monotone killed by involving him in what little he’d been present for, until Cassie told me that what’s done was done and we couldn’t do anything to change it so, *please* calm down and stop pacing through the kitchen.

We’d taken our own precautions to ensure that Grayson couldn’t listen in on our conversations.  The kitchen was the best place to talk, as it was the most interior room of the apartment.  We covered the windows in the adjacent living room with blankets and then gathered around the small table for a hushed planning session.  I explained as best as I could the difference between inhuman things and ancient things, reminding them that all of this is just speculation on the part of my hometown and that the rules aren’t consistently followed.  However, we agreed that we’d treat Grayson as an ancient being now, because we surely couldn’t go wrong by overestimating his abilities.

Here’s what we understand so far.

Grayson is the rain.  He was likely an ancient thing before the college was established.  

The first president was seeking a path to immortality and decided to trap the rain in a human body.  What he planned to do with Grayson after that is unknown and we’re not sure how we’d find out, because no one wants me talking directly to Grayson anymore.  However, we do know that it started a cycle of souls being stuffed into the president’s body to keep it going and Grayson’s essence being stuffed into new bodies to keep him corporeal.

Makes me wonder if the president inadvertently created a trap for himself, one of those ‘wish gone horribly wrong’ situations where his soul was allowed to perish but his body was given immortality.  Serves him right, if so.

The tree was likely created by someone that assisted the president.  One of Professor Monotone’s ancestors, who then became the groundskeeper.  We suspect that this person regretted what they did and was trying to undo their mistake, but again, no way to know because they’re dead and didn’t write anything down.

(the moral of this story is if you’re going to do evil rituals please take copious notes because someone might have to undo your bullshit a few generations down the line)

We think the tree reduced the rain’s influence.  It was an alder tree.  Grayson talked about it trying to consume him, which I assumed was a figure of speech but now, *I think he was speaking literally*.  The devil wanted me to destroy the tree because then Grayson could escape campus and he wouldn’t have to compete with an ancient that seems very possessive of his turf.

Grayson wants to break the cycle of finding new hosts by merging??? with me.  Which I’m sure would be great for the college because it’d get rid of a body-stealing ancient, but I’m not keen on it.  And interestingly, I’m only tempted by the offer when I’m around Grayson.

Oh yeah and the pool of water in the basement sucks souls out.  I proposed a bet on the pool being where the original ritual was conducted and even though I only bet a bag of ramen, no one would take me up on it.

So there we go.  That’s everything.  Those are actually just a copy/paste of the notes I took during the house meeting, which is now my job forever or until we resolve the situation.  Because somehow I’m now the fastest typist of the group, can’t imagine how that happened, it’s not like I’ve been getting a ton of practice or anything.

“I’ve been talking to James,” Josh said.  “I think he feels more comfortable with me because I’m not as close to Maria as you two are.  He’s been trying to remember things from when he was a ghost.”

He wasn’t entirely alone in the water (for we’re pretty sure at this point that’s where he was).  There were other shapes that passed him by, distant, indistinct, and when he’d first returned and was trying to make sense of what happened to him he’d assumed they were students in the corporeal world.  However, the more he dwelled on it, the more he realized that might not be the case.  Some of them were too big.  Most were oddly formed, close enough to human, but not quite correct.

“We think they are students, but they only intersect with the ocean when it’s raining,” Cassie said matter-of-factly.

We think.  They’d already discussed this without me.  My friends *are* scheming in my absence.

Also we’re calling it the ocean now, because it seems too big to be the traveling river.  Maybe the traveling river flows into it.  Into Grayson’s *actual* body.

“So we might be able to access the ocean when it’s raining?” I asked.

Convenient, considering it is *still* raining.

“That’s a theory.  But there’s something more important that James told me,” Josh said.

The ocean had currents.  He felt like it was trying to drag him down to the darkest depths, an ever-present pull and the more he resisted it, the more like himself he felt.  But there were areas where the current wasn’t as strong and he tried to stay there as much as possible.  It wasn’t that he was stuck in one building.  He stayed there because the current was weak.

“The roots,” I said, my eyes widening as I finally made the connection.  “The lecture hall was covered in roots!”

Josh and Cassie both swiveled to stare into the living room, where the piece of petrified wood sat on the coffee table.  Titanosaur, sprawled in the entryway, stared back.

“But he wasn’t able to leave with me,” I continued, frowning.  “I was stuck in the gray world - this in-between space that I think is connected to… everything.  I tried to escort him out of the building and he got pulled back.”

“Oh yeah, he mentioned that,” Josh said.  “Says it was the most lucid he ever was.  And when you were holding his hand, he saw more than just the ocean.  He saw the hallway and the doors of the geology building.  Then the current grabbed him and pulled him away from you.  He said he could think of nothing more than to find you again, after that.”

Great.  So that explains why James followed me to the power plant.

“Did he tell you why he tried to shove me in the water?” I asked.

“I don’t think he remembers that yet.”

“Or he’s lying,” Cassie said.

Awkward silence descended.  Grayson is obviously at the top of Cassie’s shit list, but I get the feeling that James might be second on account of what he did to Maria.

“Anyway,” Josh said, thankfully breaking the silence, “if the power plant pool is connected to the ocean, then it explains why we haven’t been able to fill it with concrete.”

“Or with dirt,” Cassie muttered.  “Or water beads.  Or that futon mattress.  Or anything else we’ve tried.”

Goddamn I wish they weren’t keeping me out of the loop, I would have *loved* to see them dumping all that crap in there.

They’d also come to the conclusion that maybe it shouldn’t be sealed, now that it was our ticket for getting Maria home and Grayson out of here.  Both of them seemed pretty intent on returning Grayson to the ocean, swapping in James, and bringing back Maria.  I got the feeling that they already had a plan on how to get us all in the same place and that was why Josh has been talking to James.  I also realized that they had no intention on sharing that plan with me.

“I don’t know if this changes much,” Cassie sighed.  “Other than we need to be more careful about where we talk and maybe we should start carrying silicon packets to throw at him.”

Maybe it was because I’d actually experienced Grayson’s terror about being returned to the ocean, but Cassie’s joke didn’t sit well with me.  I snapped at her that it wasn’t funny and then I just stalled, not sure what to say after that, unable to explain why it upset me so much.  Cassie looked uncomfortable for a moment and then mumbled an apology I didn’t quite believe.

“I know you want to help Grayson,” Josh said.  Bless his emotional intelligence.  “We can’t really give you a timeframe because he’s hooked into your mind, but let’s just say that if you want to do something before we do, do it fast.”

 “And we’ll help if you need it,” Cassie added.

For a moment I didn’t know what to say.  It was clear Cassie didn’t agree, but she was still going to help.  I stared at the table and tried not to cry.  But what *did* I want to do about Grayson?  

“I think I want to visit the library ghost,” I said.  “With the heart.”

They didn’t ask a lot of questions about that, which was good because I didn’t have answers.  After the encounter with the steam ghost, it just felt like the right thing to do.  It didn’t feel like I’d done something *bad*.  Maybe I was pulling them out of the ocean.  And after that - I don’t know.  There’s never been any certainty in death though.

Josh went with me.  Our plan was to show up, hope the ghost made an appearance, and then shove the stone at him.  We found a floor that was deserted, although this close to the end of the school year it was a challenge.  We were pretty high up before we finally found an obscure enough subject that no one was nearby, desperately trying to finish an essay or something.  

We didn’t have to wait long.  The library ghost still didn’t like me but this time, I had a really good idea of why that was.  He appeared just over Josh’s shoulder and I hastily gestured for Josh to move.  The ghost glared at me, but his gaze seemed unfocused, like he was looking through me.

“It’s the rain, isn’t it?” I asked.  “It’s not *me* that you hate.  It’s the rain.”

“It’s… *in you*,” he whispered.

“I know.”

I held the petrified wood up, putting it between us.  I wasn’t going to have a repeat of the steam ghost.  His eyes focused on it, the dreamlike expression vanishing from his face.

“Do you know what this is?” I asked.  “Because I don’t.”

No reply.  He took a step towards me and I held my ground, holding my arms out as far from me as I could.  I’d made sure there weren’t any windows behind me, either.  I couldn’t let him throw me out one, not this high up.

“C’mon, you have to know *something*,” I said desperately.  “I’m just *guessing* and I don’t know if this will do anything or if the only options left are all bad ones where I lose *someone-*”

He reached out a hand and placed his fingertips onto the stone.

“It’s warm,” he whispered.  “I haven’t been warm in a long time.”

Then he was gone.  Just… gone.

And a crack shot down the middle of the stone I held.

“Well that was easy,” Josh said after a few seconds of silence.

“Oh you did not just say that,” I sighed.  “You’ve cursed us.  I’m going to go to the stairwell and find it full of water now.”

He laughed, but readers, let me tell you that I WAS RIGHT.

I WAS TOTALLY RIGHT.

Okay so we didn’t go right to the stairwell, we went to the elevator and when the door opened there was a puddle on the floor and that made me panic and *then* I went to the stairwell and wrenched the door open.

“The fuck did we do!?” I howled at the water churning a floor below us.  “This is bullshit!”

I slammed the door shut.  To hell with being quiet.  The library was angry at us for just existing, I guess.  

“Um,” Josh said from behind me, “is it… normal for the water to be up this high?”

“I think it follows whoever broke the library rules,” I replied.  “Altitude doesn’t matter.”

I paced back and forth, trying to think.  I hadn’t done anything.  We were quiet.  We didn’t damage any books.  But now the library ghost was gone and couldn’t help us and we were way too high up to swim down.

“Um,” Josh said in a very soft voice, “so.  I might have some overdue books from the last semester.”

I froze.  I stared at him.

“You… didn’t think to tell us that in advance?” I whispered.

“I didn’t know!  I thought the library flooding had to do with the ghost!  No one told me it was the library itself!”

In retrospect, this is exactly the sort of stupid mistake I’d make right now.  Like I’ve got so much to worry about stuffed in my head that the minutia is dribbling out my ears.  

“We could go up,” Josh suggested.  “To the roof.  That’s technically outside of the library.”

“Wouldn’t that set off the alarm?”

Josh didn’t reply, just swept his arm out to indicate the water leaking out from under the stairwell door.

“I don’t want to get expelled,” I said anxiously.

“I don’t want to *die*.”

That was a convincing argument.  Also, I thought to myself as we climbed the few remaining floors to the roof, I could always get the devil to intervene on my behalf.  He was required to help me graduate, after all.  Expelled wasn’t graduating.

Too bad he didn’t seem to care if I graduated as myself or not.  This is why you don’t make deals with the devil.  He always twists it to his benefit.

We found the door at the top of the stairs already open.  It was propped that way with a doorstop.  I stared at it in alarm, then looked over at Josh.  He took a deep breath, shrugged, and shouldered the door the rest of the way open.  

“Might as well see what’s going on,” he said.  “Not like we can go back down.”

We stepped out onto the roof, gravel shifting beneath our feet.  A few yards away, soaked through with the rain, stood Grayson.

“Hey,” he said quietly.  “You’ve been avoiding me.”

“You think!?”

My heart began to hammer in my chest.  I felt panicky.  I wanted to flee, but there was nowhere to go.  Next to me, Josh took a step forward, putting himself between me and Grayson.

“Did you… plan to meet us up here?” Josh asked.

“A little.  I saw you enter the library and thought it was a good opportunity for me.”

“Then… my books?”

“Have nothing to do with this,” Grayson confirmed.  “*I* flooded the library to get you up here.”

Where it was raining.  Where he had the advantage.

I peered around Josh’s back, a thin strand of fury breaking free.  All those times I’d had to escape from a flood, all these semesters of being too scared to use the library.  I’d assumed it was just a… a system of rules.  Uncaring and indifferent.

“It was you flooding the library!?” I shrieked.  “Do you know how hard it is to write papers without being able to access the library?”

“I didn’t have as much control as you’re assuming,” he said, growing agitated.  “That *tree* was tearing me apart.”

The roots were spread across all of campus.  Drinking up the rainwater.

“I was aware of everything going on around this body,” he continued, “but everything else came to me in fragments.  I remember being angry sometimes, but little else.”

He was breathing hard, I realized.  This was an effort for him to be here and talk with us.  His eyes kept darting away, glancing about as if he were seeing things far away, all across the campus.  The endless rain was making him stronger, but it was also scattering him.

“It’s so hard,” he panted, clutching at his head.  “You can’t understand what it’s like.  I see - I hear - *everything*.”

“Then make it stop raining,” I replied, my heart fluttering in my chest.  “Just be Grayson.”

He glanced up at me, his eyes wide and the pupils were too small.  There was resignation in his gaze, but a wild undercurrent lurked just underneath.

“I can’t change what I am.  Only humans have that luxury.”

He took a sharp breath and the panic in his eyes vanished.  I clutched at my stomach, feeling like I was going to throw up.  Behind me in the stairwell, the water was even with the level of the roof.  There was nowhere to go.

“Let’s go,” Grayson said to me.  “I think it’s time.  I’m *everywhere*.”

He held out his hand, ignoring Josh, his gaze fixed on me.  I knew what he wanted, where we would go.

The power plant basement.

And my body began to move, drawn to him like a moth, like water running downhill, and I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t think -

Until Josh threw out an arm and stopped me in my tracks.

“Yeah, that’s enough of that,” he said firmly.  “She’s already told you no.”

“Don’t do this,” I hissed from behind Josh’s back.  ““He’s the rain!”

“He’s a dick is what he is.”

For a moment Grayson hesitated and I saw indecision flicker across his face.  He’d been human for so long.  I dared to hope that he felt enough of our emotions to not want to hurt Josh, to not tear him apart like he’d done to the swimmers.

But Grayson is also inhuman.

And desperate.

“Sorry Ashley,” Grayson said.  “You’ll understand though, once this is over.  I know you will.”

And the rain slammed into Josh and I saw red splatter onto the ground in front of me, I heard him scream - high-pitched, shrill, surprised - and then he went down.  I was running, I jumped over Josh’s prone form, I hit Grayson.  Slammed into him, knocking him backwards, and then I was hitting him, slamming my fists against his chest over and over while he grabbed for my wrists.  I couldn’t keep my footing.  We stumbled on the slick gravel and I refused to let go of him even as he grabbed at my shoulders, calling my name in panic, telling me to stop.  I was yelling, that I hated him, that I wanted things to go back to the way they were, that I wanted Maria back and I didn’t want him to suffer but I hated him - oh I *hated* him - 

And then I shoved him.

And he didn’t let go.

We fell and he hit the gravel but I -

My legs hit the ledge and - then I was floating - I saw the ground far far beneath me -

There were arms pressed around my chest, a body against my back.

I heard a muffled crack, like shaking out a bedsheet.

I blacked out after that.

I woke in my own bed.  I stared at the ceiling in disbelief, listening to my heart beating in my chest.

“Hey,” an unfortunately familiar voice said from beside the bed.

I turned my head to stare at the devil.  He’d dragged my desk chair over to the side of the bed.

“I fell,” I finally said.

“You did.  I caught you.”

That noise I’d heard.  Wings opening.  The devil is often depicted with wings.  I slowly pushed myself up so that I was sitting, my back against the wall.

“Is Josh-”

“He’s alive.  He just won’t be able to walk for a while.”

His legs, then.  Grayson had only targeted his legs with the rain.  I wanted to sob in relief but I felt empty, wrung out like a dishrag.

“Are you just… following me around, then?” I asked.

“I am!  I am *so* invested in how this turns out.”

I asked him if this meant that he’d be willing to help me.  I feared that I was in a position where I wouldn’t be able to save myself anymore and I couldn’t bear the thought of Cassie getting hurt next.  Or dying.  But the devil’s levity bled away at the question.

“I don’t think I’ll be able to save you again like that,” he sighed.  “The rain… it knew I was creeping around, but I always stayed out of its grasp and it didn’t want to make an enemy out of the literal devil for no reason.”

“Now he has a reason.”

He nodded glumly.

“But - you could win, couldn’t you?” I ventured.  “You’re the devil.”

“How many stories do you know of in which the devil wins?” he asked.

His voice was very quiet.

And I realized what I’d been ignoring this entire time.

The tricksters… bad things happen to them.  And in the cases where they get recast into the devil role… even worse things happen to them.  All this time I thought I had an ace in my back pocket, because I had one of *the* heavy-weights of the inhuman world backing me, but I’d forgotten one of the very important tenets of stories.  They were meant to explain the world, to teach us how to survive, and to establish the social norms of right and wrong, good and evil.

Which meant the devil always lost.

I didn’t have a heavyweight backing me after all.  I had the inhuman world’s eternal loser.

“You get it now,” he finally said, watching the expression on my face slowly change as I processed all of this.

“I-I’m sorry,” I stammered.

He raised an eyebrow at me.

“That I didn’t realize it until now,” I continued.  “And - and I’m sorry that you can’t ever win anything.  That sucks.”

“Oh.”  He waved a hand dismissively.  “It doesn’t bother me.  I mean it - it *can’t* bother me.  This is just what I am.  Besides, all the stories portray me as dangerous and *hot* so I’ve actually got a lot going for me.”

He smiled charmingly to illustrate his point.

“The rain has got… what?” he smirked. “Doesn’t even have a body of its own.  Has to steal one.  And the rest of it just lays there on the ground all day.  Geese shit in it.  Drunken college students piss in puddles of it.  I’ll take being sexy and adored and sometimes getting the supernatural shit kicked out of me over that any day of the week.  But you know what this means, right?”

I didn’t.  I couldn’t think of anything at the moment.  It was like my brain was chugging along at half-speed.  The devil stood and walked over to my desk.

“You’re mostly right,” he said, his back to me.  “I *do* want access to campus so I can cause trouble.  The rain has been either driving off or killing anything it can’t control, which tends to be creatures like me that have been around for a while.  I’m sure the president wasn’t the only one that brought his own motives to that ritual they conducted.”

Immortality.  Power.  A weapon against the inhuman.  Little wonder he was falling apart now, burdened by all these expectations he couldn’t fulfill.

“So for me to get what I want, I need the rain gone.  But I can’t do that myself.  It’s all in your hands now.”

He turned around.  In his hands was the petrified wood.

“That’s how I work.  I ruin your life… and now it’s up to you to fix it.”

He placed the stone in my hands.  I ran my fingers over it, staring at the crack stretching from one side of it to the other.

“I don’t know what to do with this,” I said.  “It doesn’t really look like a heart and I don’t know how that would fit into anything, even if it *did*-”

“That’s because it’s not a heart,” the devil replied.  “It’s a *seed*.”
