I doubt anyone will read this but hey reader, I'm Alma!

My journey begins on the 2nd of June, three days ago in this year of 2024. I remember the day being quite cold, as it is autumn—almost winter at that time in Argentina. 

The sky was cloudy, with gentle thin tears falling from it. There was fog, a lot of fog, and the ambience was generally humid for the constant rains of the season. I remember waking up wishing I took my life a while back, because in case it wasn't bad enough having lost my mom months ago, another family member just went and died. Not on purpose or anything! No, it was just a car accident. Someone drunk driving. Anyway, now because of ol’ good cousin Lucas, we all had to go to the graveyard on a day like that, on top of the burial being early. 

Looking in the mirror and washing my teeth, I tried to think about it as a change of routine, since my days were pretty dull. Just surviving, doing absolutely nothing and not looking hard enough or just not getting a job. The water went through the drain as my life escaped from in-between my fingers, unable to keep it together. Jesus, when was it decided that I was to turn 24 this year? 

As I drove out of the city and into the road listening to Será by Las Pelotas, I decided I wouldn't touch not a glass of alcohol. I knew there would probably be eyes around, and given the circumstances in which that idiot died, of course people would be focused primarily on me not doing “my thing”. Because of course, everyone in the family had labeled me as an alcoholic, even if that was a long time ago, it appears that two years of alcoholism are hard to erase from the record. 

I set foot outside of the car my mother had left me. I was so ready to hear something along the lines of “It is because of people like you that…”, “It is due to people like them that…” I opened the umbrella and braced myself, walking towards the entrance. The place was huge, it is the biggest cemetery of the province after all, and one of the prettiest too. I had been there before for different occasions each time, first was because of a childhood friend’s uncle, then my grandparents on specific dates. I found it funny how they asked to be buried there and my family just did that, despite how expensive it was. At least they had the extra money I guessed, good for them!

When I crossed the gate at first no one was around to receive me. I held my umbrella tight and tried to find the person in charge, because well, there normally was someone who had to let you in. And so for some minutes, all I could see was how the cemetery sprawled over the landscape, the different paths it had, without any guidance, seeming like a maze. The statues and monuments, granite and marble, apparently staring at me as if I was some sort of alien, ignoring their own cracks and flaws that time had given them as a warning, they had to retire. I wondered who was managing the place, letting it get so… worn out. 

A frown was visible on my reflection as I peeked through the third window of the building at the front, and saw the room was devoid of any human beings. Man! I was so angry, I had woken up, gotten out of bed and now everyone in the family would think I am an asshole for not showing up, but this wasn't my fault! I sighed and relaxed my shoulders, my left hand reaching for my phone when all of a sudden someone put a hand on my shoulder. 

“Alma” my auntie greeted, showing me a weak smile. 

Not much happened after that. I just remained there, silent, watching as my other family members talked with each other and shared memories of my cousin. I felt out of place. I never really connected with anyone in the family, they felt like some sort of strangers that I knew out of obligation, or formalities. It was such a big family, so many people and no one was even close to knowing not even what my favorite color was. Nevertheless, I knew that I had to be there. And as they were finally closing the hole in the ground, I felt a presence next to me.

“Enjoying yourself?” Asked my younger cousin, Matilda. 

“Aren't you supposed to be like, crying and shit?” I glanced at her askance, not really sure about what she meant with the question. 

“I'm surprised you decided to show up. You could perfectly be the one who killed him.” 

I didn't have a comeback. I wasn't even able to reply, my phone started ringing, and God it was loud. I cursed at myself and buried my hand in my pocket, going away to answer it. By the time I was far enough though, it ceased to ring, and a message that I hadn't seen before popped up. Both notifications were from my dad. 

My heart sank. Of all the bad news I could’ve gotten that day, these were by far the worst. And while he got to enjoy a life abroad, in a first world country, sending me a message from a Café with his younger daughter and perfect wife, I stared blankly at the screen, reading over and over the message. 

‘I have talked about this with Monica. I saw the balance in your bank account that I transfer money to. I'm so disappointed. One would think that you would've done something of use by now, you're old enough to live by yourself. I don't know what to do with you anymore, you're wasting your life. And if it's gonna be like that, this is the last month I'm giving you money. I mean it. I can't help you anymore.’ 

Another message. It was a contact he shared, my ex-psychiatrist. My hands went cold as the shock went away and reality settled in. What did he mean? I hadn't wasted that much money! I still could do something! Mom’s life insurance was bad, did he think it was gonna last forever?! I felt my heart race, my face get warm and saw the blurry vision of tears blocking the way. I put my phone away. I had it coming, he had been warning me. I lowered myself to the ground slowly, squatting down. I cleaned my tears with one hand and still held the umbrella with the other, and I observed the puddles being formed by the water that fell from the crying clouds with tiny waves. A chilling wind whispered to me through the rows of graves, carrying with it the scent of dampt earth and decaying leaves. I let it tickle my cheek and move my hair. I took a minute. 

By the time I started walking back I saw everyone was leaving, each jumping onto their cars or just saying their goodbyes. I waved to my aunt who was talking with the staff and decided it was enough. I turned around and headed to the exit. Approaching the window I first peeked at, however, I stopped. A poorly written poster that communicated they were understaffed and needed a night watchman caught my eye. I quickly took a picture of it while I thought no one was looking, saving the number attached for later. Every chance I got, I had to take. Not like I had any better alternatives. 

The very next day, with a sense of defeat and a clearer head to calm my mood, I made the call. An old man answered, the very owner of the cemetery. We agreed to have a job interview on the next day, “as soon as possible”. But I didn't think too much of it, after all, it was a night shift there, and who in the world would want a job like that? He surely didn't have many candidates, and that was an advantage to my favor. So considering how desperate we both surely were, this would go well. I would armor up and use every tactic and resource I had to get this job, so I dressed with a white shirt, serious pants, high heels and tied my hair up in a bun. A serious independent woman ready for the position!

Yeah that did not go as planned. I had to drive barefoot, when I arrived the high-heeled shoes kept making me struggle in the mud and I had to roll my pants up a little more so they didn't get too dirty. On top of that, it was so chilly that I felt my body shaking every few minutes. I was so tense, nervous and felt so not-ready. In a shocking turn of events, Mr. Pacífico, the owner, was very understanding. He was like one of those warm and welcoming grandads that you can see watching the birds and feeding them at a park, with a soft, serene voice. 

“Very well Alma, enough with the background and standard questions” he smiled at me and intertwined his fingers on the table. “I wanna know, why do you want to work here?” 

I smiled and looked down before returning my gaze back to his eyes.

“I find the place to be very special. I think it would be a great experience and I just know that I can do the job well. I also really need the money sir.” 

He chuckled. “I love how honest you are, sweetheart! It is perfectly fine! I know you don't want to work here!, Who in their right mind would? Just tell me, do you fear death?” 

I giggled, thinking I had heard him wrong. However, with the silent revelation that it wasn’t a mistake, I answered. “No sir.”

I got the job a few minutes after that. Or well, at least a trial night. I would be there for one night and if everything went well, I would get the job. This trial was paid, so of course, I had nothing to lose.

It was supposed to be easy. There was no big storm, no client coming for the night, nothing to really worry about, or so I thought. Mr. Pacifico explained it all to me, he would leave and I would be at the office, the building next to the gate, the only entrance and exit of the place surrounded by pointed fences. There, I had to regularly check the many cameras distributed along the whole graveyard and its various facilities. Landline was working in case of an emergency and there were a distinctive amount of locks I had to learn to use quickly on the door to shut it. I could communicate with him through the old phone or my mobile in case something was out of place, he just told me to have common sense and everything would be alright. I appreciated that he trusted me and all, yet I was still hesitant to stay all alone so when he told me that there was a security guard roaming around, I exhaled with relief. 

 “Oh and by the way, if you see any fog coming from the nearby forest, lock yourself in here and don’t open the door, no matter what happens.” he warned before leaving without further explanation, and the door finally closed.

 I glanced at the computer, unsure if I wanted to sit just yet. There was a coffee machine and a mini fridge next to a cupboard filled with supplies and snacks that he didn’t say anything about, and I would’ve asked about it if only I hadn’t heard the main gate close just when I was about to head out. I sighed and put all the locks on as he had instructed. Taking a better look at the room after, it was filled with stuff to be comfortable during the shift. To be honest, at that point I was just jumping on one leg, this would be the most comfortable, easiest job ever, and everyone else was dumb enough to judge it as scary and not take it. I smiled at the surveillance camera inside the room and surrendered to the chair, sitting comfortably in its embrace. I looked at the walkie-talkie that connected me with Zeiss, the security guard, it was strange not to know anything about the man, but I couldn’t be unprofessional and talk to him because of that, so I decided to instead familiarize with the list of cameras and their locations, which were written down on paper. I had to remember this, since it was my trial night, if anything out of the ordinary happened I had permission to tell the other guy to check it instead of going myself, although normally whoever was closest had to do it. 

After a few minutes of going back and forth between the list and the video on the screen, I leaned back on the chair and got my feet out of those god awful high heels to sit comfortably cross-legged, relaxing in what seemed to be my best job to date. The video of the office could barely capture the top of my head from that angle, so it would be perfectly fine. I was just about to close my eyes when I spotted something moving in one camera, which made me squint because it was a little dark and I could not distinguish it properly. Of course there were lamps and lighting but along with them came certain spots they didn’t quite reach, and this humanoid figure without any flashlight was in one of them. Unsure, I sat up straight and picked the walkie-talkie, pressed the button Mr. Pacifico had taught me and spoke. 

 “Hello Zeiss, I’m Alma the new watchman, I think I’m seeing something weird in… err…” I failed to remember the name of the location and just repeated the number. “Camera number 11. Could you please go and check it?” I panicked for a short moment as I let go of the button, given that I had told him unclear indications, and saw how the figure began moving again, probably taking something out of a pocket or a belt. I heard static.

 “Good evening Alma, I believe you are referring to me. I am standing in front of the camera, over.” The figure waved. He sounded young, around my age or younger. Was I tripping or were they really this understaffed, hiring whoever came first? I sighed, embarrassed. 

 “Oh, I’m sorry, I thought…” I left the sentence unfinished. “It’s a little dark in those areas, don’t you need a flashlight?” 

 “I have one, don’t worry.” he began walking and left the frame, not saying anything beyond that. 

 I frowned with a subtle awkward smile looking at the device. Yeah I probably was working with someone as strange as the position he had. Who the fuck would be willing to lurk the cemetery at night like that? I mean, staying in a room and watching the whole place was one thing, but actually being out there at night on their own? Most likely someone really dumb, arrogant or a psycho. I put the thing down on the table and leaned back once more, taking my phone out of my pocket. I had some signal, but no WiFi. I forgot to ask for it. 

I rolled my eyes and let it rest on the table too. I watched the footage, still, it got boring after some time. Got over the fact that I didn’t ask and made some coffee anyway, got some pen and paper and started drawing, every few minutes checking if everything was alright and if I could see that Zeiss guy somewhere in the cameras, but there was nothing. I was letting out a big big yawn when I realized I had to hit the bathroom. It had been quite some time since the last visit and my body was letting me know. I got up and put on those diabolical high heels. I attached the walkie talkie to my blazer’s pocket and approached the door with all the locks on. Did I really need them? Everytime I had to head outside I would have to do everything over and over again, kind of annoying if you ask me. I stretched as I felt the breeze letting me know it was windy, which made the temperature more freezing. I turned the lights on when I reached them in the restroom, and did my business peacefully. The crickets sang, the trees’ leaves joined them and the bell rang… I shook my head softly. Bell? Were there bells here? 

 Standing outside, I could hear its faint ring in the distance. I pursed my lips and like a fucking stupid protagonist of a horror movie, went towards it. It didn’t sound like the chapel’s big bell, it was a small one, like that of a goat. I clenched my fists unknowingly as the chill seeped through my bones, my breath unfurling in pale clouds that vanished as I moved on. The lamp posts from the set path were sparse, their dim halos barely enough to push back the surrounding shadows. Each pool of light bringing ahead of it a void so complete it felt alive until the next bright zone. Walking through the cobblestone was hard with those awful shoes, and yet I didn’t stop, as if I was being called, and the minutes froze waiting for me. The bell rang intermittently, closer now, and with it came its faint vibration in the air, as though the sound itself carried weight. When I reached the end of the cobbled track I hesitated for a moment, right in front of me a sea of uncut grass. I wondered how much time it took me to get there, and yet as soon as I caught the repeating sound so near, I immediately got off those high heels. Barefoot now I made my own way through crooked headstones, their etched names half-erased by time. My eyes set on my newfound need. The next repetition echoed unnaturally as I finally reached the small origin of it; a small bell to the side of a grave, with a string attached to something underground. It wouldn’t cease this time, moving continuously as I fixed all my attention on it. I extended my hand and tried to touch the string, and suddenly it went silent. No more movement. The lamps that I left behind grew further apart, and the night deepened. I snapped out of it, scanned my surroundings only to barely see more gravestones with bells next to them. 

“What the fuck…” I stepped back, but as soon as I gave my back to my surroundings and faced the trail I had to return to, all the bells sang in chorus. My eyes opened wider than before, turned around, hand reaching for the walkie talkie at the sight of all those little shits dancing. A slow walk transformed quickly into a jog, and a jog in a run at full speed. They mocked me, they laughed non-stop at how I was a coward, how I left without even grabbing my shoes again, how my finger pressed the button but I was so frightened I couldn’t even spit out some words. My breath began to run out, tears covering my retina and making it hard to actually see what was in front of me, and so with only differentiating between vague shapes and tones light or dark I tripped, letting go of what I was holding. I realized they weren’t ringing anymore. Wiping my tears while still crying, I sat with the minor scratches I had received, trying to recover. But the crickets didn’t talk, the wind didn’t blow, and this wasn’t over. I reached for the only communication I had with someone, and now I talked quietly as I got on my feet again. 

“Hey dude, are the-” I wasn’t able to finish, all I let out was the loudest scream I could offer. I had the brilliant idea to look back once more, and there I saw a vague shadow figure of a man in a trenchcoat. No need to say or do anything else, it was a race to the safe spot. I have never ran so fast in my life, and it was more impressive considering I’m completely out of shape. As I finally approached the door, I could hear footsteps closing in on me which gave me the last shot of adrenaline I needed. I entered and slammed the door, to which loud bangings exploded on it, as if it was someone who came to collect owed money. 

“Please please just leave me alone, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!” I shouted as I backed away. It stopped. I cried for a short second before the door opened by just using the handle, that was enough to make me shriek and throw the walkie talkie as hard as I could to whoever was there. 

“Bitch, what the hell!” It impacted on someone’s head, rather than the floor. The guy held his hand to the place it was hurt. 

I blinked twice, going dead silent. It was a twink. By his voice I could recognize him, it was Zeiss. I covered my mouth and analyzed him. Brown hair, dark eyes, a bit shorter than me and apparently younger too. I was fucked, if this was the security, the whole place and us were fucked.  

“Oh my god I am so sorry!” I went ahead and grabbed him by the arm to make him come inside and letting go to then close the door with all the locks. “This crazy shit happened to me back there and I, I think we are not alone, we must call the police, or Mr. Pacifico or…” 

“Alma, I see you are scared, but for fucks sake calm down and tell me what happened!” 

“I was in the bathroom I heard a bell and then went to check and there were like a shit ton of bells and they rang on their own and then I ran and there was this man in a trenchcoat that looked at me and…” I explained frantically, no pauses, no breaths in-between. 

“Wait, so…” he crossed his arms. “You just got freaked out by the bells and called me?” 

“W-Well yes! You're supposed to handle these situations!” I gestured desperately- “But what the fuck are you supposed to do if you wouldn’t even be able to take me on a fight?!”

“Girl… are you trying to make me angry or something?” the way he raised his eyebrows told me that I sounded crazy, and he was over the situation. 

“What?, What am I supposed to do with those bells!?, Why did they even ring?, Are there people buried alive down there!?, And the man… neither of us can take him!”

“There’s no man, Alma. We’re alone here. You probably are delusional or just saw a family of goblins standing on top of each other to look human in a trenchcoat.” his calm demeanor combined with that unbelievable explanation left me staring at him blankly, to which he sighed and added. “Look, I get it, it’s your first night and you think this place is haunted, but believe me, it’s far worse than that. I mean, why else the paycheck would be so good?” 

“But the bells…” 

“That’s on you, just ignore them, they sometimes ring, and so what? They didn’t harm you did they? And you could’ve just told me to go check them if you wanted, you even had the two-way radio with you.” he brought up, as if it was the most casual and normal thing ever. 

“You’re nuts, for real.” I frowned with pain. 

“Uh-huh, that’s why I’m the one wearing shoes and you’re the one who’s barefoot in this temperature.” 

“I had to!” I tried to clarify, but he shook his head lightly. 

“Sure, just get your shoes back on and continue your job. We still have three more hours to go.” he reminded me as he unlocked the door. 

“Can you at least come with me to get my shoes?” I asked, taking the flashlight already accepting the situation. 

The man rolled his eyes but agreed, and after escorting me to the office again he left for, as he put it, “Goblin hunting”.

 The last three hours I spent treating all my scratches and getting myself clean again before sitting at the desk and writing the first part of all of this. I was very tired and almost fell asleep many times, but I managed to stay awake and get most of it done, of course while watching the cameras every few minutes. I sometimes saw Zeiss walking around, other times it was just plain nothing. But the night had definitely earned the title of crazy already. It was about to be sunrise when Mr. Pacifico arrived and opened the gate. I was getting out of the first building, ready to leave, and Zeiss was leaning on a wall nearby, with his arms crossed, yawning. I was congratulated and told I got the job as I was handled the payment for the trial. I must’ve had a troubled expression, because the owner then asked.

“You still want the job right?” With a worried smile. 

“Oh, uh…” I mirrored the smile anxiously, discreetly looking at the money, and then at him again, not being able to even count how much it was total, as it was even more than I expected for this. “Yes of course sir, I just need some rest.” 

 He giggled and shook my hand happily, and we said goodbye. I waved to Zeiss on my way out and I left, having way too much to think about and many things to consider about this job. Getting home felt like a blessing. I collapsed on my bed, slept until the afternoon and woke up late, knowing that I would have to go to work if I wanted to keep this salary. I read the messages Mr. Pacifico sent me, a contract, some other stuff. But I didn’t reply, I had no clue of what to do yet. 

 

I finished writing this just now and I’ve been thinking that if I hadn’t panicked, it wouldn’t have been so bad. Should I come back?
