I was born a few years before the events of 9/11… 

I don’t remember all the details of the day, but I remember my teacher freaking out when their pager went  off—and them turning the TV to some news channel. 

Seeing freakish amounts of smoke, pouring out the sides of the building.

Another plane flying into the second trade center—all of us gasping in horror. And, were those people? 

That could do a number on a kid.

None of us would realize, until about thirty years later. 

This event, was the beginning of a long, fraught, and arduous road… paved with theocratic and secular extremism. Culminating in a gratuitous hatred—towards anyone different.

This is why, it wasn’t that hard for me to group up with the Moonlighters. 

I was working a job that did not require a drug test, and I was already smoking delta-8 all the time… besides, they seemed to be really nice!

I would get off work about 10:13 in the evenings. It was always around that time, because I had to clean the store and turn off the pumps—before clocking out. Then, I’d have to turn off the lights and lock up… they gave a bunch of poor broke people, keys. 

I took off from the Crazy Korner there in Azure Cove, the one at Bayou Road and 57—I flew down 57 towards 90 and turned right… then headed to Ocean Springs.

As soon as you would get on the bridge at 90 and Ocean Springs, you could see some beaches under the upcoming bridge. We call it Plummer Point.

I got off on a little road right past Lovers Lane, then drove to the parking lot. The evening was quite dark, save for a little fingernail crescent moon. 

From this distance, I could already smell some bonfire smoke… and getting closer, a strong smell of the dank.

I stepped out my old Honda Civic, onto the sand-drenched asphalt. 

A light crunch under my jet black nonslip shoes was cut off, when stopped hearing sounds of a guitar and maybe, a conga, from a distance.

I followed the trail of music.

Walking for a couple of minutes in the warm, humid light of night—I stood in shock. 

As I saw a large horde of people, maybe forty or more… all surrounding a towering and handsome older black gentleman, wearing a silk tuxedo vest. He was beyond chiseled, and also rocking a long set of dark box braids and a silk opera hat. 

He sat in a large chair made of recycled trashes from the beach, playing a guitar—smiling, with a large and voracious, ivory grin.

I felt a pull at my body, as if hundreds of small hands had grabbed me from behind, tugging me forward in agitation. 

There was a feeling of solitude, though it was hurried, with the touch of these hundred-fold invisible hands. Not like *vectors*, very different. 

Gentle, guiding. A bunch of loving hands that meant very well… very well, indeed.

The touch of these hands set off a flash in my eyes, too. 

I was given the memories of all those here. Of the kind hand, of this titanic man… 

I took notice of the largesse of this figure. He was always there to guide and support and cry and surprise. Steadily supplying his *Moonlighters,* with any of their wants or needs.

In return, they gave a part of themselves away to the deep blue and returned different, better. 

More than I had ever known anything… I wanted this. I had spent enough days in my room crying over men. Over the stress of a dead end job that I absolutely loathed. 

I wanted this… I so very much wanted control of my life. I needed to have control of my life.

I was new to the whole ideas of what people may consider pagan—I grew up a Tibetan Buddhist, and while there were some old folk beliefs… they weren’t that known or common. 

I could say I am still Buddhist, it’s really not a closed off belief system outright… pretty progressive actually. Most Dharmic beliefs are. 

Except for the more conservative old folks, but I mean… extremism is everywhere, right? 

Especially now, in the 2020s.

Anyways, this whole pagan thing is new to me… so, this was like, different… but it’s not some evil occult thing.

I was welcomed with open arms the first night. Everyone is!

I wouldn't even venture to say the Moonlighters are an evil group of people, not at all… in fact, they have been beyond kind. 

They are pescatarian, and their sacrifices are only the non-threatened creatures from out the water. 

Hell! One of the first mantras Father Mercurius taught journeymen, was one of his own creation.

—यतो ह्यस्य परमो लाभस्ततो ह्यस्य परमा हानिः

—(yato hyasya paramo labhastato hyasya parama haanih)

—‘For what is its supreme gain, is its supreme loss.’

It is clear that their sacrifices are greatly afforded and affected, as are they. I watched a few of these sacrifices at first—a swordfish, a flounder, a pufferfish, a blacktip shark, a nurse shark, and even a dolphin. 

Each rite was greatly elaborate, filled with a thick and well-thought out liturgy. 

But, it was the final part that always blew me away. It was the ornate effects they put together for *the bonding rites*. 

They had devised some sort of technology, that allowed them to display their spirit animals—jumping from out the sacrificial corpse to that of the soul of its supplicant. 

In short terms, it looked as if the projected soul of the animals, jumped into a projected ‘mental’ picture of the people who sacrificed them. 

It was beyond bizarre, but also mesmerizing. Father Mercurius said I was to be up soon.

The days passed in a flurry and a breeze, as I drove back and forth between that corner store and Plummer Point.

Over time, I had even tried a hit of the true ‘ganja,’ as Father Mercurius would say in his thick Jamaican patois. 

Patois, another word I learned recently… like a dialect that is not, to save a long-winded explanation, registered by the government or whatever. 

I thought my first cannabis experience was going to kill me, the panic attack I had… 

I accidentally called an ex-boyfriend and asked him if he was mad at me for leaving him—and before he responded, a dame named Pié de Tarantino,  took my phone. And that is pronounced, like pee-yeh, by the way.

That same ex tried to hook up with me almost six times between then and the three weeks it took for my *rites* to take place. It was sort of a rough go.

I watched these *rites* a lot more before mine, each person was told weeks in advance that they would be connected to a soulmate. This soulmate would be a guiding light for the weary worker until they received beneficence.

We would all leave from the pier in a flotilla, headed to Deer Island—where the first step, *the wooding rites*, would begin.

Father Mercurius, the supplicant, and their soulmate would ‘suss out’ a medium to large tree. The tree would be chosen for its abundance of branches and its hardiness of bark. 

Though oddly, from a distance, we could never see Father Mercurius… just the struggle of the other two, heading in a laboured direction that seemed fated. 

They would spend around thirty minutes looking for a branch, that matched the half the size of their human body. Once they discovered it, they began to chop away at it.

All the way, the group of Moonlighters behind them, were chanting a mix of the Gayatri Mantra, over a drone of drumming. Played on what I also recently learned, were kbandu. A type of instrument used in kumina, an Afro-Jamaican religion. 

Then was, *the floating rites…* the three of the ritualist would load up on one last dinghy, to the spot their boat first hits the curves of the fingernail moon.

After moments out in the gulf, they would slowly return with their sacrifice. The chanting still going. All through to next, *the bonding rites,* the chanting and drumming went. The whole tableau could gag the queerest of humans. 

Father had some interesting beliefs… another one of them was that species—need not have a restraint of any form. Except, of course, *any* forms of abuse on children or non-consenting adults. He knew that, on occasion, when too much bad existed… a bout of violence is necessary—though never *too* extreme, and also not required.

With this, he took pride in blending all of the beliefs of the world he could to bring people closer to God. He had the power of God in him and he wanted to flaunt it—help the world gain access to it.

He was always so confused at the screaming and yelling he received, when he tried to imitate the benevolent actions of Jesus. There was no room for magic they said. They were afraid of his magic.

Magic… yes, they said magic.

I wouldn't believe in it either, until my day of rites, which was just to come…

It had started off with a long bout of unknown experiences, for around two days before. They ranged from physical pains to emotional turmoils, like imagining the death of a loved one or feeling a physical tear at my heart anytime I thought too long about something that made me human.

Pié had tried to warn me with a cryptic message a few days before, in a strangely formatted text… written like: 

“***Pié****: The days of strife, soon, shall no longer be upon you.*

***||***

 ***==:X:== …***”

***||***

Like… what the hell is that supposed to mean?

The feelings finally ended when I pulled into the parking area at Plummer Point.

A fire on the point was blazing and the drumming was bombastic. The same as always on the day of rites. I walked with a fervor towards the water.

In the distance, was Pié and Father Mercurius waiting beside a wooden boat. Alongside a ton of other boats, filled with other Moonlighters either chanting or playing instruments.

We worked our way to Deer Island in a slow beat of a drum. The chants of the Gayatri, resonated with a strange harmony for miles all around… in the distance was the start of a small bonfire, that would honor my sacrifice. 

I got to the island and stepped on to the shore. The earth began to wobble and shake, for me and my Pié. We worked our way to the top of the little dune, covered in bunch of slash pines. 

Father Mercurius appeared in a sort of cloud, right next to a large slash pine a few yards to the right of us. I was wholly unaware… the entire area was covered in prickly pear cacti. So, the wobble was affected by the now tedious journey of choosing the right place to step after choosing wrong ones.

We reached Father Mercurius and he smiled his large grin, pearls this time. 

The sound of swinging and striking took me out of the trance I was in, staring at Father’s teeth. 

He laughed and handed me a machete.

“Strike di tree tank it fi its sacrifice.”

I did as Father said.

I walked with the limb, half my size, down towards circle of stones on the edge of the beach. Some chairs sat to the side…

I placed the branch down and the moonlighters placed small and large bits of dry driftwood all around the branch.

I got to the lone boat that sat on the edge of the island. The *rite of floating* was soon to begin. 

I loaded up on the last dinghy, to begin our heading into that fingernail moon. 

A strange thought occurred to me.  

The fingernail moon was almost always around. How had I just realized this? That was clearly unnatural.

—*PRETERNATURAL.* Says a soft voice in my head. 

That was clearly preternatural. I was in for something truly interesting, these rites… would actually mean a greater deal than I suspected.

Father Mercurius and Pié got on the boat, and some of the Moonlighters pushed our boat out to shore. 

We paddled for a good ten minutes when we had finally reached that point in the fingernail. A new set of strange feelings shook my body… I saw Pié shaking, too.

Then, I felt it. Something… an aquatic species of sorts… emerging from the bottomless depths beneath. 

I had to fight off the fear that something biblical, would swallow us whole. But, the closer it got to surface of the water—the stronger I felt these feelings.

Till, finally—I saw something large and humanoid in stature, with bright green and glowing eyes and keratinous beak, almost at the break.

It was near the boundary, and it was crazy and wild and wicked. 

I saw Father Mercurius say what seemed like a curse to the wind. A burst of purple smoke, looked to come out of his large mouth when he spoke.

I stood, paralyzed now. That nerve agent had paralyzed me, the creature, and Pié. 

Father Mercurius took out a large and long, metal pistol looking apparatus and fired it. 

The creature was struck with a harpoon and screamed a queer cry of terror. The scream sounded watery, a screech reminiscent of a coyote. That ended with a thick and blubbering gargle. 

The three connected souls fell limp, I heard Father Mercurius load the creature on to the dinghy.

I could see the creature in full now, as it was face to face with me.

It was nearly as long as the boat, over 7 feet tall…

Its entire body was like that of a squids thin mantle, save for the large beak in the middle of its trunk… 

It was barely breathing and you could see that with each struggling breath, its mantle skin would squeeze its organs.

The hot green eyes were wide open, and staring at me. 

They were filled with a bright green cloudy substance. A liquid of sorts that sloshed about in a slowly drying panic. 

Father Mercurius had put the littlest amount of water in the boat, enough to almost cover one of the creatures gills. It had legs like that of a human, but no other prominent human extremities… just the shape. 

When we finally reached the shores back on Deer Island, some of the other Moonlighters had just started the bonfire.

Father took me to a chair in the north most side of the fire. He placed Pié to the east, and then the creature to the south nearest the shore. He then sat to the west, looking to the east.

He spoke some words in a strange language I had never heard before.

“Tuma esaki e almanan aki i meskla nan pa semper. Laga e sakrifisio di kada un ta un prueba di nos sirbishi humilde.”

Suddenly, I saw my own soul… burst out my chest in a flash of light and fly directly upwards.

This was no trick. This was no strange projection.

My own essence, a corporeal form that seemed made of pure photons and energy. The energetic scatter of my separation created a large sonic boom for miles around. Reports from MUSCAT showed a strange surge in the atmospheric conditions this evening as well…

Then, with another great roar—the creatures soul separated. 

The static energy all around, made everyone’s hair stand up. A feeling of nervous excitement spread across each of the moonlighters beings, still tirelessly chanting the Gayatri mantra. 

The creature’s soul flew up in flash of green flames, and it floated in front of mine for a brief moment. I watched my essence, floating there in the sky, unable to move and unable to speak. 

I felt no fear, only a sick curiosity. 

The creatures soul stared, assuming a type of control not displayed with the almost theatrical experiences most moonlighters received.

The soul of the strangely profaned creature, opened its head… 

A large set of thousands of teeth in a dark sort of grey, flesh—began to balloon out and appear in an inverted step pyramid, like Chichen Itza.

The sounds of the Gayatri mantra began to break, and people began to murmur in a trembling fear.

I could barely see that Pié and Father Mercurius’ bodies were now in a different odd paralysis. Their bodies displayed in awkward ways like that of the peaceful swastik in most Dharmic cultures. Their eyes and mouths were wide open, and dark red lights were beaming out of them like ten-thousand lux flash lights.

The sounds of a roar from the pits of the throat of the creatures soul emerged. 

One effect of the Gayatri mantra, is a supposed boost in the part of testosterone that makes you grow hair…

The moonlighters noticed thus as their arms and legs and head began to rapidly produce hairs.

Still my soul, stood in a deep amazement… I reached my soul hand out towards the inverted pyramid and my entire soul was snatched in a geometrical spiral directly into the mouth of the being.

In almost all of the past bonding rites, the souls of the creatures would willingly jump into the bodies of the supplicants.

I did this in reverse.

My true body seized up, and I felt a relief wash over me that I had never felt before. 

I was free of the human guilt of anything. I was no longer connected to my weak corporeal form.

I was a part of this being now. We were our own creation.

I stepped out towards the Gulf with our new body… looking down at the water.

I could see, faintly, the mantle of this creature fused with the human flesh and figure of myself before.

We turned towards the moonlighters with a ferocity I was wholly unaware of, being a follower of ahimsa(non-violence) from birth.

Our being screamed with a might, that Samson likely screamed on the day his grew back and he felled the pillars of the temple.

I kept back our hungry urges for now… but the Moonlighters ran back in a terror and fled Deer Island.

It has been years since I saw them, perhaps they are are finished with their rites for now… 

I must find a way to revert to a form of a humanity again, even for a short time… if I am to learn the whereabouts of these cultists.

For now, we rest in a strange abode made of a large reef—on the ocean floor,  outside Azure Cove beach west.
