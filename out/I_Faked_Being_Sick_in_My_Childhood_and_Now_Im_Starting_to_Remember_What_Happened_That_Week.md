 

I don’t remember much of my childhood but the parts I do remember I wish I could forget. 

I hadn’t thought about that week in years.  
Not until I started cleaning out *His* garage.

This place still smelled like motor oil and sawdust. The old fluorescent light buzzed overhead, flickering every few seconds like it was trying to remind me that time doesn’t move the same in places like this. 

I found a half-finished workbench in the corner, dust settled over it like snow. The same one Dad said he’d finally finish "when he had the time."

He never did. 

Even with the windows cracked and the door rolled halfway open, the air clung to me—sawdust, WD-40, old sweat and rusted metal. The kind of smell that sinks into your skin. I stood there for a while just breathing it in, like it might fill the hole in my chest.

He was gone.

Three weeks ago, the cancer finally won.

It wasn’t sudden. We’d known for months—maybe longer, if I’m honest with myself. 

But even when the chemo started thinning his hair and turning his skin that gray-yellow color, Dad never wanted to talk about it.  
“It’s just a bump in the road,” he’d said.  
He meant it.

He still worked in here up until the last two months, dragging himself out of bed with a thermos full of black coffee and a stubborn glint in his eye. I’d tell him to rest. He’d grunt something like, “Nah, I’ve still got a few good licks in me,” and then he’d go tinkering with something that didn’t need fixing just to prove he still could.

I used to sit on that upside-down milk crate and watch him work. We'd listen to the radio, WLIK on low, playing some twangy acoustic stuff that I hated as a kid and miss now like hell.

He didn't say much. Never did. But when I’d hand him a socket wrench without being asked, he’d nod like it meant something. Like maybe he was proud of me in his quiet way.

I think about that more now. All the things he said with gestures. The way he'd pat my back when he passed by. He wasn’t a perfect dad. Not by a long shot. He yelled when he got overwhelmed. Shut down when he didn’t know how to help. Hell, when I came out as gay, he just nodded and flicked the tv channel over to Will and Grace. 

He never really knew what to do with feelings—his or mine.

But he showed up. Every time.

Even when I didn’t deserve it.

And now...  
Now I’m standing in the middle of his garage with my childhood in one hand and nothing but silence in the other.

 I’d come home to clean the place out—after the funeral, after the casseroles, after the endless parade of “I’m so sorry” from people who didn’t know him, not really. 

I knew Mom and Tori couldn’t deal with it. 

I was going through his old toolbox when I found it: my *Space Jam* blanket, folded neatly in the bottom of a milk crate, sun-faded and worn thin at the corners the blood stains soaked into the fabric and turned slightly brown with age. It was tucked beneath a tangle of orange extension cords and a cracked Thermos. I don’t know why he kept it. Maybe he forgot it was even there.

But the second I saw it... I swear I felt twelve again  
and then that whole week came back… 

The one we never told anyone about.The one I thought I’d imagined until now.  
  
***2003***

*MONDAY*

Monday morning, I woke up to the sound of birds tapping on the gutters and the muffled slam of a screen door somewhere down the street. April sun was slipping in through the blinds in soft golden stripes. I reached for the alarm clock, blinking at the numbers.

7:04AM.

School started in exactly twenty-six minutes. 

I rolled back over and coughed—dry, flat, fake. 

But I’d been rehearsing all weekend. Practicing in the mirror, rasping like I had strep, even holding the thermometer to the light bulb for a second too long before chickening out and shaking it back down.

I wasn’t sick.  
Not in the way my dad would understand.

I just... couldn’t go back.  
Not to the jokes.  
Not to Luke Bennett and his sharp elbows and sharper laugh.  
Not after what he whispered in gym class last Friday in front of everyone.

The door cracked open, and Mom peeked her head in. Her face lit up when she saw I was awake.  
“Hey, sweetie.”  
Her voice was soft and singsongy, like she used when I was sick for real. “You feel any better this morning?”

I shook my head dramatically and gave a weak little sniff. “Not really…”

She crossed the room and sat on the edge of the bed, brushing my bangs off my forehead. Her fingers were cool and gentle. I remember she was still in her bathrobe, the pink one with little blue flowers.

  
“You feel warm,” she said, though I was pretty sure I didn’t.

I didn’t say anything. I just gave her the most pitiful look I could manage.

“Okay,” she smiled, smoothing the blanket. “I’ll go talk to your dad, let him know you’re still sick and see what he says.”

She kissed my forehead and stood up, but before she reached the door, my older sister’s voice floated in—sarcastic and smug.

“Fake,” she said, peeking her head around the corner with a smirk. She was already dressed for school, backpack over one shoulder, highlighted hair pulled into a sloppy ponytail.

“Shut up, Tori,” I muttered, keeping my voice low so Mom wouldn’t hear.

“You better hope you’re actually faking it. Because if I catch the plague from you, I’ll kill you myself.”

I flipped her off.

She raised her eyebrows like she was gonna rat me out—but she didn’t. She just snorted and walked off, calling over her shoulder, “Enjoy your sick day, loser.”

Mom didn’t notice. Or pretended not to. She just shook her head, 

“Leave your brother alone, Victoria.” 

Mom walked away muttering something about the two of us being impossible and padded down the hall toward the kitchen.

After a few minutes I heard Dad's boots thud down the hall before he knocked twice on my door—he always knocked, even if he was already turning the handle.

My head wasn’t hot. My throat wasn’t sore. But I still pulled the covers up to my chin and added a few dry coughs for effect. 

I’d practiced them the night before.

 “Hey, you good buddy?”

I coughed again, this time with a little throat rasp. “I still don’t feel good.”

He stepped in. His dark work shirt was already tucked into his jeans, sleeves rolled up, the familiar “*Dale”* patch stitched over his chest. 

His hair was still wet from his shower, and he smelled like Irish Spring.

He crossed the room in two strides and laid a calloused hand on my forehead. His fingers smelled like engine oil

“Don’t feel like a fever,” he said. “But you’re pale.”

I didn’t say anything. Just looked up at him from the nest of blankets. The morning sun hit the side of his face, and for a second, I thought he looked tired. Not the kind of tired a nap would fix. The kind that just builds and builds until it lives in your bones.

He didn't press it. He never did when it came to me being sick. I think after my surgery, he started to believe I was made of glass. 

When I was 5 years old, I had a brain tumor, it was removed though and I was fine, but it scared the hell out of him and mom.  

  
“Just rest, okay?” he said, already halfway out the door. “I’m gonna work in the garage most of the day. You need anything, come get me.” 

He turned back toward the door, then paused. “You want anything? Waffles? Cereal?”

“Maybe toast.”

“Coming right up.”

He left without another word, humming something low and tuneless. I waited until I heard the faint clink of a toaster lever and the sound of the garage door creaking open before I climbed out of bed.

I spent the first couple hours exactly how I imagined: sprawled on the carpet, watching *The Amanda Show* on my old Zenith box TV, sipping Capri Sun through a chewed-up straw. My feet were cold. I didn’t mind.

The house felt... calm. Like it exhaled once the world left for work and school. I knew every sound it made. The way the fridge clicked when it kicked on. The creak of the hallway when you stepped just right. The faint *clunk* of the dryer vent in the wind.

But around 11AM, something was off.

I was halfway through a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, flipping through an old *Nintendo Power*, when I heard a thump.

Not from outside. Not from the garage.

From the hallway.

Just one. A soft thud, like a dropped shoe or someone stumbling. Then nothing.

I muted the TV and listened.

Silence.

I tried to laugh it off, but something in my chest pulled tight. The air suddenly felt heavy, like when a storm's about to roll in.

I crept to the hallway and peeked down it. Every door was shut... except the closet. The one by the bathroom. Its door stood cracked open just an inch—just enough to show darkness inside.

I hadn’t opened it. I was sure of it.

I stood there for a long time, heart punching the inside of my ribs. Then I grabbed the broom from the laundry room and—like an idiot—poked it shut from a distance.

*Click.*

I exhaled.

Later that afternoon, I asked Dad if he’d opened it earlier. He looked up from the engine he was working on, grease on his fingers and forehead.

“What closet?”

“The hallway one. By the bathroom.”

He shook his head, wiping sweat off his brow with the back of his arm. “Haven’t been inside the house all day.”

He didn’t say anything else. I think he chalked it up to imagination. Or nerves. Or both.

That night, I couldn’t sleep.

The ceiling fan rattled gently overhead, and the streetlamp outside my window painted familiar shadows on the wall. I pulled the blanket up to my chin and counted the blinking red numbers on my clock.

2:13AM.

I was just starting to drift off when I heard it.

A low hum. Not a sound I recognized. Not the fridge. Not the fan. Not the vent. It was inside the wall. Soft and vibrating, like a voice pressed through insulation.

Then... something moved across the ceiling.

Not a shadow.  
Not a trick of light.

Something that didn’t belong. Something crawling, but too smooth. Too slow. It passed just above me like a ripple in the plaster, just long enough for my breath to catch in my throat.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t move. I just laid there, every part of me rigid, listening to the silence that followed.

I didn’t know it then—but that was only the beginning.

NOW

I shuttered the memory away and pulled out my phone to write this just so I didn't forget. 

I tucked the blanket into my jeep and decided to drive home for the night. I have to come back to do more work in the garage and it's already so late...

  I'll post more about that week tomorrow.
