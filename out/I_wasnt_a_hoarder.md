I’ve never considered myself a hoarder, but I’ve always had this habit of keeping most cardboard boxes that find their way into my house, whether they’re packages I ordered from somewhere or boxes that came with stuff I bought in person.


There’s a few good reasons why I do this, but above all else I guess it stems from me being a person who simply *hates* seeing things that could easily be given some use being thrown away like they’re trash. First, some of these packages could easily be reused if I happen to have something to ship out, which doesn’t happen all that often but every now and then I do manage to make some online sales.


Second, keeping the original boxes for certain items will save me a ton of trouble if I ever need to return them, take them somewhere to get them fixed, or just transport them anywhere, like if I had to move to a new place on short notice or something similar.


Last but not least: storage, of course. No matter their size or shape, I can always find something I want to put away - but not *throw* away - and have these boxes actually serve a purpose.


I’m not gonna lie, some of these packages sit on top of some shelves and they *do* reach all the way up to the ceiling, and sure, there’s a number of things I keep around only because I can’t bring myself to part ways with them, but I’d say my case isn’t really much of a “case” at all: my place isn’t actually *littered* with these things, you can perfectly walk around the house without tripping over. It’s not the most aesthetically pleasing thing ever, but it *is* practical.


But there’s this one box in particular that’s been slowly chipping away at my sanity for a while now. I can’t tell you exactly when this all started, but I know I got it sometime in 2019, seeing as that’s when I bought the desktop computer I still own and use to this day, which came in said cardboard box.


It’s a fairly big one, by far the biggest I own, and it always sat right under my desk in a vacant spot. It has always remained mostly empty, except for the stuff that came with it like pieces of styrofoam and booklets of sorts.


The thing is that this box has become the source of a certain noise, but no matter what I do I simply cannot pinpoint what it is that’s actually *making* that goddamn sound.


I’m not sure how else to describe it, but it sounds like a toenail-clipper snapping when being put to use, except that it’s not that quite sharp of a sound. Hard to tell if it’s a quick, wet smacking sound or just a soft clicking of sorts, but it’s definitely there alright.


Never during the day, only at night, but also not *every* single night, it comes and goes. I usually have my headphones on, but if I’m not actively listening to anything then I’ll definitely be able to hear it. That’s how I first discovered it, there was this sound coming from somewhere close by when there shouldn’t be any such thing in my vicinity making that kind of sound.


Allow me to address a few things that might be on your mind at this stage:


1) It’s not a bug, or an animal. I’ve lived in this house for over thirty years and all this time I’ve only had to deal with two cockroaches, *literally*. I have never had rats or anything of the sort as that’s simply not the kind of area I live in, and even if that were to be the case, surely there’d be signs of such activity. Not only is the box still in mint condition with no holes or damage of any kind, there’s also no traces that would point to this being the result of an intruding critter of sorts, and *even if* that happened to be the explanation, I would’ve come across it by now since the noise always comes from the box itself and nowhere else, which brings me to my next point-


2) *There is nothing inside the box*. I have opened it, I have taken its contents out, and I have inspected every inch of it. Multiple times. I’ve scrubbed the insides with insecticide, and even placed some crumpled pieces of tissue in it which I soaked with bug repellent. *Multiple times*. There is nothing inside the box, but the sound *IS* coming from the box;


3) I’ve removed all sorts of things from my room time and again to try and pinpoint whether the source for that noise could be coming from anywhere else. It’s not my cord extension, or my desk lamp, or my wooden desk, or my monitor. It’s the goddamn box that’s doing it. I’ve even placed it on different ends of my room just to be sure and what do you know, there’s that sound coming straight from it, like it’s actually mocking me or something.


It has become so aggravating that at times I will lash out and either kick or punch the box, not enough to actually damage it, but enough to shake it up a fair bit. That quiets it down for a little while, maybe for a few hours or the rest of the night if I’m lucky, which is as satisfying as it is unnerving because it’s clearly *reacting* to me in some way.


I know what you might be thinking-


“*Why don’t you just throw it out?*”


No.


I can’t. I won’t.


I shouldn’t *have to*, it’s only a damn cardboard box with *nothing* in it, but for some inexplicable reason it keeps making that god awful sound that seems to be growing louder and louder. I don’t understand *how* it can produce such a distinct noise and yet I’m unable to find *anything* when I look inside.


I swear I’m not lying. There’s nothing inside the box. It’s just a box, or at least that’s what it should be, which it *is*.


I don’t know what to do. This is so stupid and yet here I am actually crying over this. I think I’ll hold off on posting this for the time being, maybe I’ll wait and see if there’s any further developments or maybe I’ll remember some other details.


***
I’m either definitely losing my mind, or my emotional outburst the other day as I was typing that first part definitely changed something. If I had to guess? Probably a combination of both.


I’ve always been a light sleeper and would wake up with the slightest sound in the house or the smallest amount of light getting into my room through the tiniest of cracks. To give you an idea of how bad it gets, I actually have to unplug the electronics in the room because whether it’s the monitor’s blinking light or that little flashing white dot telling me that my device is charging, it’s enough to prevent me from falling asleep.


So you can imagine how startled I was when I awoke with a loud sound I couldn’t immediately place, other than knowing that it had come from somewhere very close to me. Of course in instances such as this you’re likely to immediately conjure up the scenario of someone trying to break into your place - if they haven’t done so already that is - but that wasn’t something I had to worry about given how I’ve locked up my house from the inside.


I jumped out of my bed, turned on the lights and stood there in the middle of my room, heart racing, bracing myself for the next time I’d hear something as I’d be able to tell more clearly what exactly I was dealing with. Turns out I didn’t have to wait that long because as soon as I happened to look at the box I could immediately tell that something was off.


As I said before, it’s always been right under my desk, and both the desk and the box are directly resting against one of the walls of my bedroom. They’re pushed in as much as they’re physically allowed to, meaning that the box is always perfectly aligned with the structure of my desk.


Except that at that moment it wasn’t, as one of the box’s corners was slightly sticking out, as if someone had grabbed one of its sides and pulled it towards them from under there. I had barely finished processing all that information when I heard a loud smacking sound once again, as some kind of force from within the cardboard box propelled it a few inches further towards me.


I jumped back in terror and crashed against one of my shelves. I would’ve screamed if I’d been able to, but I think the only sound that left my mouth was a pathetic, choked whimper. I quickly gathered my thoughts and realized that this was actually great news-


For the first time ever, I’d actually seen this thing *move* with my very own eyes, so now I knew for a fact that it wasn’t *just* a sound and that this *wasn’t* all in my head. Not only that, but the fact that it moved at all meant that there had to be *something* in there.


At this point I firmly believed that it really had to be a rodent of some sort after all, there simply was no other explanation. I grabbed a baseball bat I keep by the side of my bed and proceeded to yank the box towards the center of the room with one swift motion. I didn’t care if I’d make a mess, I’d use my own hands if I had to if it meant that this nightmare would finally end right then and there, once and for all.


I tipped it over ready to smash the first thing that came out of it. Other than the sound of my throbbing headache, the room was completely silent. I stood there long enough for my hand to go completely numb given the rock solid grip I had on my bat, ready to swing at the first sign of, well, *anything*. But nothing came out.


I didn’t understand.


I dropped the bat, propped up the box once more and pried its flaps wide open, not the least bit worried whether something would jump out right at my face.


Nothing about the box’s usual contents had changed. Nothing.


And I didn’t understand how that was possible. I still looked under the desk, under my bed and a little all over the room, but I couldn’t really bring myself from looking away from that wretched box, because I knew I wouldn’t be finding answers anywhere else in the room, and I had a feeling that *it* knew that as well.


I was scared and extremely upset. I figured that this would be it for the night, so I went and kicked the box to get it back to its original spot while also venting some of my frustration in the process, only to find an unusual, impossible force preventing it from moving.


Maybe I had missed, or maybe I’d subconsciously reduced my intent as to not actually damage the box itself. Only when I tried to grab it and push it back under the desk did I realize that I wasn’t imagining things-


This thing *really* wasn’t moving, as if its whole structure had become part of the house’s very own foundation. There was nothing I could do other than just leave it there and deal with it come morning. Maybe I was just tired and all of this was nothing but a hallucination of sorts brought forth due to stress.


I’m going back to bed, fully aware that I won’t be getting any sleep.
***
Later that night, a different kind of sound, much more subtle and continuous than the last, made me roll on my side as silently as I could, so that I ended up directly facing the area where the box had been left at, almost within an arm’s reach from where I was.


There was no doubt about it: it was the sound of the box’s top flaps moving about on their own, as if something was trying to make its way out, and by the sounds of it, something did, as I heard it slowly brush against the cardboard flaps as it slithered through. I was in total darkness so I had no way of knowing what was actually happening a mere feet away from me. I blindly reached out for my phone which I always left at the very edge of my desk, as I can grab it at any time even while laying in bed.


I pointed it towards where I knew the box was, and for a good few seconds that seemed to stretch on forever, I seriously debated whether I really wanted to shine some light on it, not knowing what I would find. A couple of taps later, I got my answer as my phone’s flashlight filled the room.


*No*.


I immediately turned it off and rolled back to my previous sleeping position, facing away from it.


*No*.


I pulled the blankets over my head and did what I could to remain in absolute silence for as long as I had to, if it meant not having to face it.


There is nothing inside the box.


*There is nothing inside the box*.
***
My hopes that this had all been a fever dream of sorts were dashed from the moment I got up. I thought it would be morning by then, but it was still dark out for some reason. The box was still exactly where I had left it - or rather, where I couldn’t move it from - with its contents strewn about. I’m guessing with everything that happened I forgot to put it all back in, but it didn’t matter now as I would not be touching the box anytime soon, especially after I took notice of something odd on the floor right next to it-


Three small pieces of darkened paper, crumpled up, which I quickly fetched before immediately putting some distance between me and the box.


As soon as I touched them, the hairs on my arms and at the back of my neck stood up. It wasn’t just the odd, uneven mixture of black and crimson which covered the entire pieces of scrap paper that left me uneasy. I really, *really* didn’t like the feel of it in my hands either: ashen and yet slightly moist at the same time, as well as heavier than it should be.


I unfurled them completely one at time only to find a single word inscribed in each piece:


“*the*”


“*remember*”


“*pieces*”


*Remember the pieces*?


*The pieces remember*?


I don’t know what these are supposed to mean, and I wish I could say I don’t know where they came from, but there’s only one possible explanation.


I approached the box and pried it open once more with my baseball bat. It’s completely empty and unmarked in any way.


It’s just a box and there’s nothing in it.


I placed the papers on my desk and sat down on my bed facing the box.


It’s not going anywhere, and neither am I.
***
A familiar sound startled me.


I stood up in the darkness of my own room and fumbled to grab my phone.


Had I actually fallen asleep? If yes, for how long, and more importantly, *why* was it still night time? I grabbed my phone and looked at the time, but quickly realized that I couldn’t attribute any meaning to the numbers shown on my screen. I went over the bed towards the other end of the room where the windows are and directed my phone’s flashlight towards them.


Instead of glass, I was met with several layers of plywood haphazardly drilled into the wall.


That’s right, I *had* done that at some point. Guess I just forgot.


The sound of something slowly brushing against the cardboard flaps made me instinctively spin around as I redirected the light towards its source, and I was immediately met with the same exact impossible sight I’d seen that other night-


It wasn’t an arm that was sticking out of the top of the box, but rather something that clearly *used* to be an arm which had been horrifyingly and irreparably mangled.


Its hand - which didn’t look like much of a hand anymore either - was balled up into a fist pointing upwards. I stared at it in horror, unsure of what to do or think, yet unable to look away from it. I thought about grabbing the bat, but I couldn’t find the willpower to run towards whatever that was - let alone *move* from where I stood - and smash it, not knowing what else could be inside the box.


It hadn’t moved in any way from the moment I pointed the light at it, but after being stuck in that standstill for a while I finally noticed some slight movement-


Its hand opened up, revealing yet another similar piece of crumpled paper resting in its palm, beckoning me to pick it up. I hesitated but eventually began to approach it, as I figured there wasn’t any way out of this other than seeing where this would lead me.


The closer I got to the box, the harder it was for me to directly look at that thing, but I still had to keep an eye on it. I was breathing heavily and sweating profusely, while it remained completely silent and inert.


I slowly reached out with my trembling left hand as I tried to grab the piece of paper without having to come into contact with *anything* else, while my right hand held my phone, still acting as a flashlight.


As soon as I picked it up, the mangled arm violently slithered back into the box as if it had been pulled down by an unimaginable force. It was gone by the time I’d reacted to that sudden and unsettling jerky movement, but in my stupor I found myself reaching into the box with my phone in hand, only to be met with the same exact sight as always-


That of a regular interior of a regular cardboard box. No stains, no marks, no holes, no blood, no damage, no hair, no bugs, no noise.


*Nothing* but cardboard.


I wished for all of this to be a product of my imagination, but the piece of paper I still held in my hand that I’d taken from that thing moments earlier told an entirely different story.


As I inspected it, the single word I found in it made my stomach drop with such force that I would’ve more than likely hurled if only I’d eaten something, *anything* in the past few days.


Then, for some reason, I started to laugh as I began circling the box.


“*Sure, why not?*” I said, addressing it. “*Where else would I go?*”


I placed the note which read “*come.*” next to the others on the desk, then entered the box. I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to fit inside, but judging by my loose clothes I seemed to have lost a ton of weight recently. I sat in it and tucked my knees into my chest, which left my feet with enough room to lay completely flat against the bottom surface while my big toes barely grazed the other end of the box.


I hung my head low enough to be able to close the box from the inside, *still* laughing, and I waited.
***
I was sprawled out on the floor when I came to.


My immediate thought was that I had to have broken the box apart at some point as I shuffled around during my sleep, although I couldn’t even tell if I had been sleeping at all.


It didn’t take long for me to realize that there was no sign of the box under me or around me, at least not from what I could immediately feel given that I was once again enveloped in complete darkness. No matter how close I brought my hands to my face, I couldn’t see them as there wasn’t a single source of light nearby.


And then it hit me: the way the gravelly ground felt under my feet, the absence of any kind of smell or sound in the air, and above all else, how endless this space felt all around me.


I was definitely no longer in my room, or in my house, or in any place I’d ever been to before. I walked and even ran for a bit but would regularly lose my footing as it was pitch black. Whether I had my eyes closed or wide open made absolutely no difference.


I couldn’t tell you for how long I stumbled around in that state, but eventually I must’ve turned around and something that looked like a house at first glance came into view, as if it had simply materialized the moment I looked in that specific direction.


It wasn’t exactly close to where I was from what I could tell, but I could perceive enough of the structure’s details to know that it was in fact a house, or at the very least something trying to pass itself off as one.


I began to walk towards it, fully aware that a number of things weren’t quite right about it, namely the fact that I could clearly see it in the distance even though there weren’t any external light sources to be seen that would explain how the house’s exterior was lit in such a clear way.


This place did not make a shred of sense. I could begin to wrap my head around the vast nothingness around me, perhaps I had died or something, but this one random building in the middle of what appeared to be an infinite chamber of darkness instilled a kind of terror in me I’d never felt before, a terror which grew more and more with every couple of steps I took.


Maybe it was the weight of the surrounding scenery’s endlessness that was slowly crushing my very being. Maybe it was the fact that deep down, I felt like that house - and whatever might be in it - was placed there just for me to find it, knowing I’d have literally nowhere else to run off to.


Or maybe it was the screaming in the distance. I don’t know when I first noticed it, but it was the first sound I heard in that place. Not the kind of sound that’s carried over by the wind, either. It was just… there, in that house, and yet I could hear it from very far away seeing as there was nothing else around.


The closer I got, the louder and more unbearable it became. I had to stop several times because that kind of continuous screaming could only be the result of someone experiencing an ungodly amount of pain. I didn’t know what I was walking into, and I certainly didn’t know how anyone could be screaming for that long, at that level, while enduring God knows what without simply passing out or expiring.


By the time I must’ve been around 500 feet or so from that crooked-looking house, the sound had become so damn loud that shielding my ears didn’t do me any good.


Turning back wasn’t an option as there was nothing to turn back *to*, so I ran for the door, hoping that my arrival would somehow put an end to it, and I was right.


The moment I flung the door open, the sound of screaming was instantly cut off in such an abrupt yet clean manner, that it’s as if it had never been there in the first place. It didn’t so much feel like something which had stopped, but rather something that had been entirely deleted from existence itself.


I didn’t even have enough time to breathe a sigh of relief when I noticed something on the floorboards of the house I’d just entered, only a few feet away from me-


A bloody heap of flesh, the positioning of which I instantly recognized, along with what remained of its articles of clothing which had been equally shredded to bits.


*Remember the pieces*.


I felt a lump in my throat so thick I was almost certain, no, *hopeful*, that I would choke to death that very instant.


I ran out of that house and into the permanent night outside once more, screaming in utter terror, and even though I could hear myself, I could also tell that the sound wasn’t actually coming out of my own mouth, but from somewhere else behind me-


It was coming from *the house*.


The realization made me look back as I kept running, and in doing so I noticed that I hadn’t actually put that much of a distance between me and that place. I stopped in disbelief, and that’s when I noticed that my entire body along with the ground itself were being pulled towards the house.


My screams erupted from that place once more.


I ran, but my own screams kept getting closer and louder.


When I looked again, I saw the house slowly dismantling itself, as pieces of its roof, windows, walls and furniture were steadily ascending in the air and disappearing completely in the void above.


All would soon be gone, except for one thing.


The thing that was dragging me so effortlessly towards it.


*The pieces remember*.


An unseen force made me turn all the way around and face what was left of the house as I drew closer and closer to it. I tried to slow my advance with my feet and my hands, but it forced me to stand upright. There was no stopping it.


I could see the pile of flesh coming into view, resting on just enough floorboards - the only traces that the house had left behind - to sustain its entire mass.


One of its arms was raised towards me. Pointing at me, as it produced my screams along with those of someone else.


***The pieces remember***.


One final, violent pull had me fall on top of it, with my head landing right into what used to be her face. The screams were so loud that I felt my own body being irreversibly torn apart from the inside.
***
When I opened my eyes I was staring back at my bedroom’s ceiling, illuminated by my phone’s flashlight which miraculously had yet to run out of battery.


I was fairly certain that the ceiling and the walls in my room had always been white, but what I was looking at was anything but that. It took me a few minutes to process until I realized what they were: *Little Trees* fresheners, hundreds, maybe even thousands of them covering most of the ceiling’s surface.


I shook my head and laughed, but quickly stopped when I noticed the box right next to me.


I stood up and pointed the light at my desk, and saw that the four pieces of paper were still there.


When I looked back at the box, I took notice of something else that wasn’t there before: a wide variety of empty cardboard boxes of all shapes and sizes, neatly distributed all over the bedroom floor, begging to be filled up.


*Click*.


*Click*.


*Click*.


I turned towards the big cardboard box in the middle of the room. I reached for its flaps, but stopped before I could touch it.



*Click*.


*Click*.


*Click*.


I didn’t need to look, because I knew what I would find within.


There is something in the box and I know it will never go away.


I know it will keep dragging me back down to that place every single night to face it. I can’t go through it again, and won’t, so after sending this out for anyone that might care to read it, I’ll do the only thing I can do.


The only thing that *it* wants me to do.


The arm is once again sticking out of the box, this time holding a knife which I will gladly take.


I’ll have to take a closer look at all those empty cardboard boxes, but there should be enough of them to put me away for good.
