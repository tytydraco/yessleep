I don’t know if that’s what this is, but it certainly is a hell for me. Much like a normal stairwell, everything looks the same, probably why it all just blurs together so easily but I can vaguely remember when it all began.

I’d just finished overtime at work, 14 hours sat at a desk looking at numbers can really take its toll. At least I think so, that’s all I can recall because the details are all fuzzy.

When I started my descent I distinctly saw the floor I was on, floor 19, and I went, counting down each floor in my downward spiral, like a final timer to see me off from my shift.

Just rounding floor 6 I started counting out loud to myself, I know it sounds odd but I’d hardly spoken for 10 hours give or take so I wanted to hear something other than metal twangs.

5,
4,
3,
2,
1,

…
0?

I don’t remember our building ever having a floor ‘0’, it was always just ‘G’, but what made me question further was that the stairs just kept going. There was no door to leave, just the stairs down.

And now here I am, I’ve been walking down for about 30 minutes now, I’m well into the negatives at -132 but I’m going to rest before carrying on. I’ll update you as and when I can.


Floor -500:
I’ve gotten quite the way down, I’m so tired, my legs want to give out but I need to find my way down, it’s not like I can go back up anyways, I tried a few hundred stairs back but I always come back up the set I just got to. I walk back at floor 384, I appear on the steps leading up to floor 384 again. There’s no going back, only doing down.



Floor -615:
I didn’t make much progress since my last update. I lay down on a landing and slept for a while to regain some energy and from what I can tell, that’s all I need, I haven’t felt hungry or thirsty at all yet and it’s been hours so I rest when I can.

Or has it been days?


Floor -1727:
I have no idea how long it’s been now, all I’ve done is walk, sit and sleep. My body aches even after I’ve rested and despite not getting thirsty I’m panting like a dog and my mouth is so dry but I have no desire to drink anything.

What punishment is this? Is this torture?


Floor -4816:
I forgot about updating, not a lot goes on though so there isn’t much to say. But this should be my last, I can’t keep this up, this madness. There’s gaps in the stairwell, I’ve been debating it but maybe if I jump, I’ll meet and end one way or another. Goodbye, I hope no one has to go through this, this isn’t any way to live.


Floor -7250:
I can’t die.
I fell 2000 fucking floors and I still can’t die.
Whatever this is, it’s keeping me alive, not living, but alive. I still feel the pain but nothing is broken, I feel the shards of bone in my lungs with every breath after slamming into the rail at god knows how fast but there’s no marks and my ribs feel sturdy but my lungs still get torn to shreds with each slow, laboured breath.

I’m going to lay here for a while.
