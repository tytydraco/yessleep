I don’t know if what I’ve written will ever reach anyone.  
Maybe some of us survive.  
Maybe an entirely different species will discover us through these words.

Whether someone finds this or not, I will keep writing.

I made a mistake.  
I know that.  
That’s why I’m sorry.  
For everything. For everyone.

My name is Andrew,  
and I am the man who brought about the end of the world.

It all started with the terrible accident where I lost Emma.

We began our relationship happily. We made a sudden decision to get married. But happiness didn’t last. Arguments, disagreements—slowly, they crept between us. Eventually, we became nothing more than two restless people sharing the same house.

One Saturday night, I came home drunk. Like everything else, Emma scolded me for that too. I wasn’t in the mood to be insulted. I just wanted her to leave me alone.

When I locked myself in the bathroom, she followed me inside. I told her to get out. She didn’t listen. I wish she had. I wish she had just said “Go to hell” and left the damn bathroom.

She didn’t.

And I pushed her.

I only meant to make her step back. I just wanted to be alone. She wasn’t supposed to get hurt. But Emma slipped. Her head hit the edge of the jacuzzi.

And she—

I could only stare. For long minutes. I called an ambulance. By the time they arrived, it was too late. She was dead.

I remember standing beside her coffin at the funeral. I looked like another corpse staring at a body. I was shattered. I had lost my mind. We fought all the time, yes—but I loved her.

When I started waking up in bars every morning, when there wasn’t a moment I wasn’t drunk, I finally understood.

I was running.

Running from the crime I had to face.  
From my wife’s killer.  
From myself.

I was never a religious man. I never went to church on Sundays. But desperation and guilt change a person.

I couldn’t forgive myself.  
So I wanted—at the very least—to apologize.

One morning, I woke up and went to the only church in town.

I was afraid to walk through the doors. It felt like guilt and grief had merged into a single body and were waiting for me inside.

I slowly pushed open the large, undecorated door. Inside, rows of wooden pews stood side by side, separated by a narrow aisle that led directly to a raised platform. The creaking of the door and the sound of my footsteps didn’t seem to disturb the few people inside. They sat with their hands clasped, fully devoted to their prayers.

I took a seat near the front, close to the corner. As I slid across the wooden bench, I could feel it. The regret pressing down on me was overwhelming. Whenever I closed my eyes, the first thing I saw was her.

Emma.

With her curly hair and flushed cheeks. She was looking at me—pouting, sad, accusing.

I grabbed the cross hanging around my neck and lifted my head. Tears streamed down my face, slicing my cheeks like razor blades. On the dome-shaped ceiling were paintings meant to represent Jesus and the twelve apostles. I forced my eyes away from the poorly done artwork and looked higher—toward where I believed God might be.

In a voice even I could barely hear, I whispered:

“Forgive me, Father.”

Regret was tearing my throat apart, suffocating me. I begged again.

“Forgive me, Father.”

“*If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.*”

The deep voice beside me made me jump in my seat.

I opened my eyes in panic and examined the strange man sitting barely a meter away.

Yes—he was strange.

Even in the dim church light, his bright white suit practically glowed. Only his shoes were plain black. A blood-red tie stood out sharply against the white. His long brown hair was slicked back, framing a handsome face with sharp features.

But something ruined that refined appearance. He was wearing pitch-black sunglasses—completely out of place. Despite the glasses, I knew he was looking straight at me.

I turned away, trying to ignore him.

He kept talking.

“Regret is humanity’s misery.”

He turned his head toward the crucifix on the opposite wall.

“Leave me alone.”

I faced forward again, assuming he’d go away. He didn’t.

What he said next made my eyes widen.

He was staring at the cross still clenched in my hand.

“So tell me—how sorry are you, Andrew?”

“How do you know my name?”

I slid sideways on the bench. Slowly, his head turned toward me. A knowing smile—one that hadn’t been there before—spread across his face.

“I know far more than just your name.”

“Get the hell out of here, or I’ll call the police.”

Adrenaline surged through me as I stood up.

For a brief second, my attention drifted to the back pews.

The people who had been there earlier were gone. I should have heard them leave. The old wooden floors and creaking doors would’ve made it impossible to miss.

Something else caught my eye.

The stained glass windows.

The angels, humans, and holy figures etched into them looked… wrong. Their faces were distorted—sad, almost crying.

And worse—

They were all looking this way. Not at me.

At him.

His voice echoed again.

“Are you planning to lie to the police again, Andrew?”

I knew exactly what he meant. But there was no way he could know, so I played dumb.

“What? What lie?”

“You know exactly what I’m talking about. And who I’m talking about.”

As I backed away, my foot caught on a wooden ledge. I nearly fell.

“What do you want from me?”

He ignored the question.

“I’m curious. What was your reaction when you learned your wife died that night?”

“How do you—”

“And when you found out she was pregnant?”

My entire body began to shake.

That was impossible.

Only the doctor had told me. No one else knew.

I collapsed where I stood, terror washing over me as I stared at the man in the white suit.

“Who are you?”

He raised a hand to his sunglasses and slowly removed them.

I knew instantly—this was no ordinary man.

But when I saw his eyes, I realized he wasn’t even human.

“My God…”

Two tiny suns burned inside his pupils, staring straight into my soul. A red so intense it was beyond description. I was frozen—terrified, mesmerized, unable to run.

I crawled backward, then forced myself up and ran. When I glanced back, he hadn’t even changed position. I reached the church doors and threw them open. And stepped right back inside. Same place. Same pews. And him.

I tried again.

And again.

A loop.

A prison.

And this was his doing.

He raised his hands calmly.

“You won’t leave unless I allow it.”

As he walked toward me, my legs gave out and I dropped to my knees. I began to cry—not just from fear, but from utter helplessness. In that moment, I was certain this was the being sent to punish me.

I clutched the cross hanging from my neck, raised it toward him, and bowed my head.

“Forgive me, God.”

He burst into laughter—cold, sincere, chilling enough to drain the warmth from the room.

“God?” he said. “You think that’s who I am?”

“Aren’t you?”

I lifted my head slowly, disbelief written across my face.

“Of course not,” he replied calmly. “My name is Lucifer. Or, as you like to call me—Satan.”

The air itself felt like it filled with hatred and malice at the sound of his name. I could barely comprehend what was happening.

“I won’t harm you,” he continued. “On the contrary, I’m here to thank you.”

“What?” My voice cracked. “Why me?”

“I’ll explain. Stand up. Come here.”

As we moved toward the pew where we had been sitting, it felt as if an invisible force lifted and dragged me forward. When I stopped in front of the bench, hesitation still gripped me.

Lucifer sat there casually, legs crossed, gazing at the statue of Jesus as if admiring a peaceful landscape.

“You’re still afraid,” he said. “Because you don’t trust me.”

He was right. He was the father of lies—trusting him would be foolish.

“Yes,” I said. “Because you’re the Devil. The most deceptive being there is.”

For a split second, something flared in his eyes—then vanished. His expression remained calm.

“You humans have never stopped blaming me for your sins.”

He nodded toward the cross clenched tightly in my hand.

“And then you beg your beloved Father to protect you from the devil…”

As I gripped the cross harder and began to pray, the metal grew hot.

Too hot.

I couldn’t hold it anymore. I tore it from my neck and dropped it to the floor. The iron melted on contact, seeping through the wooden planks like liquid fire.

“…but the thing you should fear was never me.”

“What do you want from me?”

He laughed, as if I’d told a joke.

“As I said, Andrew, I came to thank you. But for it to truly mean something, I need to tell you a story.”

“About what?”

“About everything. Sit.”

My body locked up. Then suddenly, as if shoved, I lost my balance and fell onto the pew.

My shoulder brushed against him.

I screamed.

He was unbearably hot—like standing too close to the sun. The fabric of my shirt turned to ash, and my skin burned instantly. Ignoring my pain, he spoke.

“Every book ever written speaks of a beginning. The start of time, of the universe, of all things. But before that—there was us. My brothers, myself, and our Father. Before creating time, He desired something different. Something unlike anything He had made before. He wanted life. So He created a universe. Elements, planets, stars, black holes—everything. But this was merely preparation. I knew He had a greater plan. This creation would be different. Unlike angels, unlike any being before. Because they had no choice. So my Father created free will. He gave them a piece of Himself—so they could choose.

You, Andrew.

The human race.

The moment I saw you, I understood. I saw something my brothers didn’t. Beneath your mercy, your innocence, your purity—there was something ugly. They couldn’t see it. They looked at you with compassion. When my Father welcomed you into paradise, they brought you the purest waters, the freshest fruit. They loved you.

But I always felt it.

Evil entered existence with you.

I told my Father. I said free will was not as pure as He believed. That there was a flaw in His new creation. He refused to accept it. He said you were perfect. That you were the only truly unique existence in a universe gifted with free will. But I knew—he had seen it too.

That’s why He watched you.

And one day, He decided to test you.”

I didn’t need him to explain what that test was.

“So the famous apple story was real,” I said. “You told us to eat it. You got us expelled from Eden.”

“I never told Adam to eat the apple, Andrew,” Lucifer replied calmly. “It was a test. I did exactly what my Father did—I watched from a distance.”

He leaned back slightly.

“I watched Adam steal the apple and bring it to Eve. I watched myself proven right. My Father understood then. He realized his new, talking monkeys weren’t as perfect as he believed.”

The words hit me like a gunshot.

“But you,” Lucifer continued, “you clever little liars… When Adam realized he would be cast out, he blamed me. He claimed I tempted him.”

His lips curled faintly.

“My Father was already deeply disappointed. Even though he knew the truth, he chose to believe his favorites. And as punishment—he cast me down here. To this world. After you.”

“So…” My voice was barely steady. “You were the one expelled from heaven because of us.”

Lucifer turned to me slowly.

“So tell me, Andrew—who was the real devil?”

I shrank back against the pew as his anger began to radiate from him. Light seeped through his white suit, growing brighter with every second. I feared he might explode.

Then, suddenly, he relaxed. He leaned back again—and the glow faded.

“When I fell from heaven, I was in agony,” he said. “Shattered. My powers dulled. I was alone in a place I didn’t recognize. I called out to my Father—again and again—but he never answered. I spent years in what you call your world. Hatred and revenge rebuilt me from the inside. I searched for you. I longed to tear your race apart.”

Then one day—I found you.

Not Adam and Eve. Their children. Cain and Abel. I intended to destroy them. I gathered all my strength for it. But then something happened. I felt it.The thing I had warned my Father about since the moment of creation. 

Evil.”

Lucifer’s voice dropped.

“I saw it inside Cain. Hatred. Cruelty. Bloodlust—far stronger than anything I had cultivated within myself for centuries. I saw the sharpened spear in his hand. So I decided to watch. I watched Cain murder his brother—who suspected nothing. I watched him drive the spear into Abel’s back.”

Lucifer paused.

“Afterward, Cain fell to his knees. He was sorry. The rage vanished in an instant, leaving only the hollow, burning weight of regret. And that was when I made a decision. I would make your kind suffer for as long as it existed. But I realized something. I didn’t need to. I wasn’t necessary. You already carried that potential within you. From the very beginning. You harmed not only each other—but everything around you.”

Mercy and wrath.

You had both.

I called out to my Father again. I asked him to create billions more of you and scatter you across the world. But none of you would be perfect. No being with free will could live a sinless life. He refused. So I proposed a deal. If he was right—if even one of these prototypes lived a flawless life—I would accept my punishment. I would be cast into the most horrifying place he ever created.

Hell.

And all of you would live happily in heaven.

But if I was right…”

He turned to look directly at me.

“He would take me back.”

He looked at me as if waiting for the question already forming in my mind.

“And us?” I asked.

Lucifer smiled faintly.

“Every book written throughout history shares a common ending. Books you altered again and again out of fear. But you cannot change the fate written by God Himself.”

“The apocalypse,” he continued. “That was always the end.”

“If the final human sent to the world was also flawed, the fate written would come to pass.”

He paused.

“Unfortunately for you, that number was completed one week ago.”

The ground shook violently beneath us, accompanied by a deep, monstrous roar rising from the earth itself. I nearly fell from the pew.

It felt like an earthquake—nine, maybe ten on the Richter scale.

Lucifer didn’t move.

“What’s happening?” I shouted.

“Don’t you understand yet?” he replied calmly. “It was you, Andrew. Humanity’s final hope. And the one who triggered its fate.”

The tremors intensified. The small church began to collapse inward. Walls cracked, debris rained down. I slid from the pew and hit the floor hard.

Lucifer watched.

Dust and broken stone filled the air, yet not a single speck touched him. His white suit remained immaculate, as if shielded by something unseen.

“No… No, that’s not possible…”

“For thousands of years,” Lucifer said, “I have walked your world. My Father truly tried for this place. Tell me—how does it feel to be the one who ends such a ‘perfect’ creation?”

He rose, straightened his suit, and began walking toward the door across the part of the floor that hadn’t yet collapsed.

I screamed after him.

“Lucifer! What will happen to us? What do we do?”

He turned his head slightly.

“*Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.*”

He laughed softly and turned away.

But before he vanished, I heard him whisper—so faint it felt unreal, as thunder and destruction swallowed the world.

“You should have read the Bible more carefully, Andrew.”

His figure flickered like a hologram—then disappeared.

I collapsed beside the pew as another violent tremor brought the remaining structure down on top of me.

Dust filled my lungs. I could barely breathe.

Somehow, I managed to push away the rubble crushing my chest.

I was still inside the church—or what was left of it.

Only fragments of concrete remained.

I crawled out onto bare ground.

The earth was wrong.

Yellowish. Sickly.

The sky above was dark red.

The sun—  
it wasn’t where it should be.

It hung low on the western horizon, massive, swollen, crimson.

It was only 11 a.m.

The air grew hotter by the second. My skin burned as if I’d been thrown alive into an oven.

Despite living far from the coast, I saw the sea.

The waves weren’t crashing.

They were exploding.

Foam spilled over itself. Bubbles rose to the surface.

The ocean was boiling.

Mountains collapsed like they were made of plastic blocks. The sun continued to swell.

Beyond the falling peaks, I saw them.

Four colossal silhouettes.

Four black horses.

Impossible in size.

And four riders.

I laughed.

I had lost my mind.

My legs wouldn’t move. But where would I even run?

The world was ending.

It felt unreal—like I was watching a film instead of living my own death.

When I heard the deep, echoing sound of a horn, I knew.

This was the end.

Lucifer hadn’t been joking.

I fell to my knees, waiting to be swallowed by the waves, burned alive, or crushed by a meteor.

Then I saw him.

Lucifer stood in the distance, shouting toward the sky.

“Father! You saw everything! I showed you all of it—again! Take me back now! Return me to heaven! Let me stand beside my brothers once more!”

A beam of light broke through the black clouds and poured down onto him.

His face glowed.

His smile grew wider.

The light intensified until his form began to fade.

His final words echoed as he vanished.

“They didn’t need a devil, Father. They carried their own within them.”

The earth shook once more—and everything went black.

**Day 2 of the Apocalypse.**

I’m alive. Barely.

A few of us are hiding in an underground shelter, trying to survive.

The seas are still boiling.  
The sky is still red.  
The sun keeps growing—its color deepening, its size doubling.

No one can survive on the surface anymore.

The air must be over 100 degrees.

Our food and water will last a few more days—maybe.

Or we’ll suffocate first.

Lucifer said he wanted his apology to be meaningful.

So he told me the story of creation.

Of humans.

Of himself.

And now, I’m telling it to you—for the same reason.

I don’t know if anyone will ever read this.  
If the paper will burn before it’s found.  
Or if the concept of life itself will even remain.

Still—

I’m sorry.

To the universe.  
To humanity.  
To God.

And to Emma.

Ah…  
Maybe Lucifer was right.

Maybe I really should have read the Bible more carefully.
