It’s a decades-old joke. Cliche “boomer humor”. Probably been told almost as long as there’ve been telephones to call. It basically goes like this:

“A woman doesn't come home one night. The next day she explains to her husband that she slept over at a friend's house. The husband calls his wife's five best friends. None of them know anything about it.

A man doesn’t come home one night. The next day he tells his wife that he slept over at a friend’s house. The wife calls her husband's five best friends. All of them say he had slept over, and three claim that he was still there.” 

Of course, the number of friends varies, etc, but it’s a pretty specific joke, so it has fewer forms than most. It’s just there to go “Haha! Women’s friends are catty and insincere while boys are rude-or-die for the guy who said ‘nice shirt’ one time at a Wendy’s—cliche stereotype stuff. 

Now, if the joke happened to you, unlike some weirder ones you wouldn’t bat an eye. Either your friends suck, or they're awesome depending on which side of the joke you're playing. But, well… you’ll understand in a moment I guess. 

My marriage has been pretty smooth. Me and my husband haven’t been together long. We only got our first apartment together a year ago. 

We’re still pretty young, so we aren’t always responsible. It happened around the holiday season; not right around Christmas or anything, just in the general time. Maybe it was around the 3rd? The old gang went bar hopping because it was the anniversary of when someone did something. I was friends with some of them too, but I could never figure that one out. I don’t even think it happened on the same date every time.

Anyway, I came home one night, and he didn’t. The next morning, Tom (my husband) comes in trying to look like he isn’t a hungover train wreck run through a washing machine, and miserably failing. 

“Oh! Well hello.” I greeted him with icy cordiality. I was brewing my morning coffee. It was a weekend, so I didn’t need to head anywhere right away. I’m sure that had played into his decision in the first place. 

“Heh. Uh, sorry.” He abashedly scratched the back of his head. “Got a little too wild last night.” 

“And just where did you get a ‘little too wild’ yesterday to come in today?” I certainly think I had the right to be asking that. It wasn’t any sort of party he had planned, or had told me about at least, that justified staying the night. Had it been, I certainly would have been more involved.

“Sorry, really. I got a little more wasted than I thought. Crashed at a friend’s place.” He rushed over to pour his own coffee, gulping it black as fast as he could to fight his obvious hangover. 

“Mh-hm. And what friend was this?” I questioned. I was being hard on him, but it certainly wasn’t unjustified considering what he just pulled. I think anyone would have expected a call at least. 

His brows furrowed in obvious confusion. I was a little relieved not to see him go right to guilty dodging, but annoyed that he struggled to recall even that basic fact. 

“God, was it Jay? Don? It feels like I was at all of them.” 

I think that having seen that joke recently influenced my decision by putting the idea in my head. Normally I wouldn’t bother interrogating his friends. Even if I were truly pissed, I would come up with a better way to press the issue than that. That time though, I decided to go with the first idea that popped into my head. It wouldn’t reveal anything useful, but it would make him squirm a little as payback for his terrible judgment. 

“Okay. I’ll call them.” I had barely thought it before I said it out loud.

“Huh?” He was confused. Of course, he was also still nursing a horrible hangover and next to zero sleep, so obviously that was to be expected. 

“I’ll call them. See where you stayed last night.” The way I said it firmly communicated this wasn’t optional. 

“Okay. Cool.” He mumbled, already nursing his third coffee. 

“Let’s see, you mentioned Jay, Don, Tony, Jin, and Bill.” I thought through each good friend I knew would have been there. 

I dialed Jay.

It took a second attempt, no big surprise, he would have been just as hungover. Finally, he answered.

“Jay?”

“Huh?” An indistinct grumble came through the line. 

“Did Tom stay the night with you?” I asked, trying not to sound accusatory.

“Yeah? He didn’t message you? Did he make it home? I think I heard him leave, like, an hour ago?” He paused. “Wait, what time is it? Don’t hold me to that guess.” His voice was a slurred mess of exhaustion and confusion. 

“It’s alright Jay. I think he just arrived.” I hung up. Clearly, he needed more time to sleep it off.

“So that’s that. It was Jay.” Tom was clearly happy to end this quickly. 

“You don’t remember it being Jay’s apartment you stumbled out of just an hour ago?” I questioned.

“I don’t think I can remember ten minutes before I came through that door.” He admitted. I was glad he was honest instead of going straight to insisting it was totally Jay and that he remembered everything now. 

“I want to test something.” I was honest too.

“Don?” I dialed the next number. 

“Hnk.” I heard a misshapen snort. “Yeah, Ellie?”

“Did Tom crash with you?” 

“Yeah. Just left twenty minutes ago. Should be home soon. Don’t kick his ass too hard.” He sounded a little better off than Jay, despite his undignified opening. 

“You don’t need to lie for me dawg.” Tom spoke up, sounding terribly embarrassed by the whole thing. 

“The fuck?” Don sounded confused. “You’re home already.” 

I heard a confused chuckle from the other side. 

“I swear to God T, if you weren’t here, I don’t know who the fuck was.” I could almost feel the defensive shrug through the line. 

“He’s been home over five minutes already. No way he could have gotten here that fast.” I wasn’t going to start a fight with Don, but I had to point out the reality. 

“I know.” Don admitted. “I must have lost track of time…?” He seemed uncertain.

“We’ll figure it out.” I made sure not to sound too harsh, he was legitimately confused seeming, even if I was sure that it was too much alcohol and a misguided intent to be a good friend. “Bye.”

I hung up.

“That was so messed up.” Tom chuckled. 

“You know what they say about guy friends.” I wasn’t even angry at Don. “Everyone will say you were there. And two will insist you still are.”

“Yeah, I know. He just seemed confused. Must have been one of the other guys.” Tom’s face, slowly regaining its life and color, betrayed confusion of his own. 

“I guess I’ll find out.” I started dialing the next number.

“Wait, you’re still doing this?” He questioned. 

“Let me enjoy this spectacle and maybe I’ll forget to be mad at you.” I pointed out the obvious.

That made him quiet. 

“Hey, Jin.” I eagerly greeted the next on my list.

“Ugh, yeah?” He vaguely tried to cover up his obvious hangover. 

“Did Tom crash with you yesterday?” I asked the same question.

“Did he? He’s still here.” 

I had to stifle a laugh. Tom looked mortified. I held up a hand to stop him from speaking up and ruining the fun.

“Could you put him on?” I wondered just how he would get out of this. 

“Sure.” 

I looked at Tom in befuddlement. He looked equally lost. Just what was Jin going to do? He couldn’t fake my husband’s voice if his life depended on it. 

“Hey, man! Get up!” I faintly heard him talking over the phone he was clearly holding it away from his face. 

“Yeah?” 

My blood ran cold.

That sounded exactly like Tom. 

“Your wife’s calling. Bro, I told you you should move your ass. You’re screwed, man.” 

I could hear the phone get chucked onto a bed, and someone fumble to pick it up. 

“Hey, Ellie.”

Tom’s face contorted in horror at a much clearer sound of what was unmistakably his own voice coming from over the phone. It was groggy and slurred, but absolutely his own.

“What is this?” My words were of pure shock. 

“I’m sorry! I got way too smashed. I conked out right here with Jin. I should have had someone drive me home. And I definitely should have messaged you.” 

“I- Y-yes. You should have…” For a moment I wasn’t sure if I should probe for more, but I was just too terrified by what I was hearing. I hung up the call.

“What the fuck was that? What! In the living hell! Was that!” I was freaking out. I could feel myself hyperventilating.

“It’s got to be a prank.” My husband was clearly barely keeping it together any better than I was. “Let’s not panic. You know AI these days. They must have just heard the same joke you did and are doing a bit.”

I wasn’t convinced. He obviously wasn’t either. It wasn’t impossible that could be the explanation, but it seemed very, very improbable. 

What was the explanation then? Without an answer to that, I knew what I had to do.

“Tony?” I called the next friend. “Hey, Tony?” 

“Ugh. Yeah. Sorry, cleaning up over here.” 

He sounded markedly better than the others. 

“That’s alright. I just wanted to check. Did Tom stay at your place?” 

“Tom, did you really not call Ellie?” Tony shouted away from the phone, annoyance clear in his voice. 

“I lost my phone man! Sorry!” My husband, yet another one, called back.

“Jeez. Yeah, he’s right here. I’ll send him home when he’s done cleaning my sink out. You can guess why.” 

“I-I… okay. Thank you. I’ll… call back later.”

I stumbled through hanging up. Something felt so deeply, terribly wrong. My hands were sweating. They really prepared these perfect responses after a night of getting stone-cold smashed at bars? No way. This wasn’t a joke, and it wasn’t okay. The world was somehow wrong, terribly wrong.

I misdialed Bill three times before getting through. Tom just started pacing the room, wracking his brain for what could be happening? Or trying to remember? I was too focused on the last call to ask.

“Bill?” I couldn’t hide the desperation in my voice.

“Yeah? You alright?” He sounded concerned at my panic. “Shit, did Tom not tell you? He stayed over. Everyone’s okay.” 

He guessed at the source of my panic. 

“Is he-is he still there?” I didn’t know which I wanted. If he said no I would have no more answers. If he said yes, I didn’t know if I could keep it together hearing another impossible husband. 

“Yeah, hey! Times up buddy.”

I could hear the phone being passed off.

“Hey, El. Sorry, I lost my phone. I crashed safely here the whole night. I know I should have had Bill text. I guess I drank too much.” 

“You can’t be! I’m here! I came home! I’m right here!” Tom finally snapped

There was a long, tense pause. 

“That can’t be man. We crashed right here at Bill’s the whole night.” Tom, the Tom on the other side, quietly insisted. 

“Who are you? What are you?” I was borderline sobbing as I demanded answers. 

“It’s me, Ellie. It’s Tom. Who is over there with you?” I could sense a quiet desperation in the voice over the phone. 

I hung up. I had to. I couldn’t answer it after all.

“What is happening? What happened to you?” I broke down sobbing at last. Nothing made sense, least of all the equally broken-looking man across the table from me. 

“I don’t know.” He muttered, barely able to speak himself. “I don’t know. I can’t remember anything. I know we went out. I can’t remember anything.” 

He kept repeating it, trying to force himself to remember.

He never did. 

We tracked his phone to a bar restroom across town. 

None of the other Toms came home.
