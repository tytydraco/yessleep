Hello again. If you don’t know what I mean by again, please read my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/kfw0QJj2Jd). Long story short, me and a group broke into a facility to steal any secret documents to use against them. Things didn’t go so well as we lost one member. I managed to upload one log. Don’t know if anyone was able to read it since where I uploaded had bad internet. Now, I’m back with the rest of our group. While we trying figuring things out, here’s 2 more logs.

[Day 62][Patrick Stone][Subject #036]:
Even though this place isn’t our place, it’s really starting to feel like home. Everyone in our neighborhood had seemed to relax and gotten used to living here. I saw two woman across the street happily waving to me while I was on a run. Overall, things are going pretty well. That was 26 days ago. They started getting hectic again around day 30.

It started when people seemed to have calmed down. There was a couple living next to my house at the time. They somehow got here together. They had no children and only worried about living here. But, they both managed to power through and stayed happy together. That might seem like a wholesome story to you, but nothing here is meant to be wholesome.

The husband started getting mad at his wife for no apparent reason. At one point, she came by my house crying. Let’s just call her, Susan. Susan wasn’t hurt in anyway and was only crying. She told me that her husband started getting mad at even the smallest things. What Susan said before she left has still given me shivers to this day. “If I’m not here, take care of He”. “He” was a nickname he gave himself to sound noble. What he did wasn’t. 

A week after, some people asked him if his wife was okay. “He” started with assertiveness; saying she was just sick. We were all fools to believe him. The next morning, Susan was laying in the middle of the road. She looked like she was drained. Her hair was gray and her eyes looked like pingpong balls. Chatter turned to accusations as soon as the husband left his house. “What have you done?” “Are you crazy?” That’s all I could hear.

Then started the fighting. All the guys ganged up on him, the woman were trying to revive her to little use. Everything was happening all at once. I don’t understand how, but my vision was turning all but a blur.

I woke up back in my house, alone. Too tired, I got a glass of water and looked out a window. It was dark. Like, pitch black. There was no sound and no one was out. I noticed a note on the counter and telling what happened. In short, the men took care of the husband and some of the woman cared for me. This neighborhood is not a tranquility. This is a prison.

It’s all going down. My part of the neighborhood is in chaos. Our discoveries gave us nothing but pain. I hear some knocking in my house. I’m gonna have to defend. Please tell my mother I love her.

[Researcher’s log]: Both subjects had different reactions, but both ended in casualties. The fainting of subject 036 has remains a mystery to us. We may need to move a few decimal points. No further research will be done on sector 47. 

Okay. We are shocked. Whatever this facility is, they seem to be taking people and putting them in these strange neighborhoods. We have no idea where these people are. What’s worse is that it’s not an isolated event. You could be snatched up at any moment. I will still try to get more logs out. And maybe find a way to get these subjects their freedom.
