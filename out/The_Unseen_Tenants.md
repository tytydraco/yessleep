One of the phrases that I have grown to loathe over the years is the term “starving artist”. Most people do not know what it is like to be hungry or know where your next meal is coming from, not to mention the fact that you are trying to create your next masterpiece. Have you ever tried to do anything on an empty stomach? If not, I do not recommend it as the only thing you can focus on is your hunger. 

During this part of my career, you could call me successful as the traditional mediums that comprise my art have turned heads in the art community. I am not going to tell you my name however, for reasons that become clearer later the great state of North Dakota is currently my home. I am getting a little ahead of myself so let me start at the beginning. 

When I was young there was a part of me that always loved art as I can recount the times spent in the living room sprawled out on the floor with stacks of paper, crayons and pencils. In fact, our garage was unfinished and myself and my sister were allowed to draw one image on the walls. I chose my favorite Star Wars character at the time which was the bounty hunter Boba Fett as he waved to us every time we left and entered the garage. 

All through school I managed to get satisfactory grades, but art was always my passion as I did everything I could to excel. Anytime there was an art project in class I not only met the teacher’s expectations but also exceeded them. In fact, there was a time that I wanted to submit my artwork to some of the major comic book companies but after facing one or two rejections I decided to take my art in another direction. After graduating from high school and then college I obtained a degree in fine arts. My parents were always supportive of me and knew that I wanted to go out and make my mark on the world. 

After college I managed to scrape up enough to move out on my own. Growing up in the great state of Indiana had its drawbacks and one of them was the winters that were sometimes unforgiving. So, I packed what I owned into my beat-up Hyundai Elantra and headed south until I reached the great state of Florida. My destination was a run-down neighborhood that was just north of Miami called Overtown as I called up a local apartment complex and secured my first month’s rent over the phone. 

“Tree hunnred and fiffy bucks a month” he said in a heavy New York accent as he had escaped from the Bronx, or it might have been Brooklyn at least six years prior. That would give me a few weeks to get settled and find a job while I worked on my art in the meantime. Another bonus was this apartment was already furnished and while it wasn’t the newest it was functional and clean. 

While the neighborhood was not the best it wasn’t rundown, and it wasn’t as dangerous as people were led to believe. Sal, the owner of the apartment complex told me straight out “Eh, don’t let ‘em get ta ya kid. Don’t take any shit and ya won’t be messed with.”  The first few weeks were spent job hunting, and it felt that even the fast-food places did not want to take a chance on me due to my limited experience. However, with a bit of quick thinking and a lot of b.s. I managed to land an interview at a temporary agency. I went professionally dressed and answered their questions and in a few short days I had landed my first job at a logistics company. 

I hate to admit it, but those first few weeks were spent either working, exploring or generally adjusting to my new lifestyle. After work nights were spent cooking, cleaning up dishes and either trying to create art in vain or watching television on the beaten-up couch until I passed out. Routine as always, right? Artists struggle to make a living while creating art on the nights and weekends. Seems straightforward right? 

That is until I thought my place was haunted. 

Now I know you must think that I am crazy to think a rundown apartment complex in Miami was haunted. But I was passed out on the couch on a normal Thursday night when I heard it clear as day. 

“LEAVE!”

My reaction could have been a scene out of a horror movie as I bolted upright eyes whirling around the room looking for whoever shouted that word. Part of me wondered if it came from the television, however, there was some dumb commercial playing for a fast-food chain I had never heard of. Doing a quick sweep of the apartment turned up nothing out of the ordinary as everything was in its place. Could this have been my mind playing tricks on me? Part of me just wanted to write it off as I switched off the television and headed for bed. 

Otherworldly nightmares plagued my dreams as I tried to sleep but eventually gave up after a good two hours of trying. The next day at work seemed to drag on forever as working on no sleep and five cups of coffee was the fuel to get me towards the weekend. Co-workers were asking me if I was alright and even my boss asked me about letting me go home early. Assuring everyone that the culprit was my neighbors having a massive party that kept me awake seemed to work. Eventually quitting time rolled around and the only thing on my mind was sleep. Somehow managing to make it home, park my car and make it up to my apartment was nothing short of a damned miracle. Once my body hit the couch it was lights out for me. 

Instead of being haunted by ghosts, demons or anything else I slept for some time as it was dark outside, and my stomach rumbling was enough to awaken me. Part of me wanted to go out and get something cheap but with the influx of bills due in a week’s time I knew it was another night of spam and ramen for me. Rounding the corner into the kitchen I stopped as my mind thought there was something in front of me. However, after turning on the lights it was clear that there was no one else in the apartment. Going through the phases of prepping my meal, part of me felt that someone was watching me. However, that was impossible as there weren’t any windows in the kitchen. 

Putting the pot on the stove there was a flash of something right on the edge of my peripheral vision. Of course, just like always there was nothing there as I went ahead and scrolled through my phone waiting for the water to boil. 

“GO! NOW!”

A jolt ran through my body as this was no dream and it felt as if the boiling hot water scalded me. Doing a quick sweep through the apartment again turned up nothing that was out of place as part of me wondered if someone was playing a trick on me. Was the reason that rent was so cheap was I was now starring in some weird reality internet show? The water was boiling over by the time my exploration was completed and just like last time nothing was amiss. Part of me was curious wondering if it was my neighbors playing some movie or worse some prank as I put my ear to the wall. 

It was as if I was listening to a crowded room of people whispering something undecipherable. 

The next morning, I was determined to get to the bottom of this as I saw my landlord hanging around the front of the building talking to his friends.  

“I’ll come out and say it.” I said with a bit of hesitation in my voice “is this place haunted?”

He blinked and then laughed long and hard which caused his friends to laugh as well. “Kid, yer rich. There’s no such things as ghosts. When yer dead yer dead. Period. Finito. End of story.” 

I smirked and then hit back with “then what about my noisy next-door neighbor?” 

He looked at me as if I had two heads. “Kid, the apartment next ta you is empty. Has been for the past tree months.” 

“What? What are you talking about?”

He got up and made his way inside as he walked down the hall and to the right. He sorted through the keys until finding the right one and unlocked the door. It opened with an audible creak as he flicked on the lights. 

Empty. 

“See?” He said gruffly before closing the door and locking it “no one here.” 

I had heard something I was sure of, but I couldn’t prove it. I thanked him and I went back down the hall to  fume in silence listening to the echoes of their laughter. Part of me wanted to use this day to try and create something, however, it was just like the other times I tried to create something. The shadows grew longer as morning transitioned into afternoon and then dusk. I seethed still remembering the empty apartment, wishing I had some evidence to present to him to prove them all wrong. 

“YOU GO NOW!”

Whirling around the only thing that was visible was a blank wall and this coupled with the humilation that I had suffered earlier brought my anger to a boiling point. Next to my easel there was a well used mason jar and without a second thought I scooped it up and threw it hard against the wall. The glass shattered into a thousand pieces, but it also tore a deep gash into the drywall. 

Instead of showing off insulation or exposed wires or even wooden beams the only thing that was there was darkness. At first, I thought it was a trick of the light however, I couldn’t be more mistaken as the darkness seemed to move and writhe within the hole. A pair of probing antennae poked from out of the hole followed by another and even more as the first of a glistening black roach scuttled forth. The creature hurriedly crawled down the wall as it seemed to stare at me and that voice returned. 

“LEAVE!”

The voice boomed in my ears as more of his bretheren poured from the new found hold in the wall. Two first appeared followed by three more and then more than I could even count as they all shouted in a cacophony of voices. 

“GO! GO NOW! LEAVE! GET OUT! OUT!”

Roaches poured out onto the floor creating a black wave that seemed to obsucre everything that was on the floor. Antennae twitched and mandibles clacked together as these creatures started to shout one message. However, I finally realized that these things were not talking with their mouths. 

Their thoughts boomed inside of my head threatening to bore into my skull.

“our home! Our Home!! OUR HOME!!!”

I could no longer endure this as my legs threatened to give out beneath me as a revulsion started to rise up from my gut. Bile and sweat mixed in an unforgiving cocktail as I scrambled towards the door and flung it open running screaming out of the complex. Tenants and other curious onlookers saw a crazed person run towards their car, fling open the door and drive away as if the devil themself were chasing them. 

It seemed like hours however, it was only a few minutes as I managed to pull into a fast food parking lot as my mind was still processing what had happened. Picking up my phone and dialing one of my friends I asked them if I could crash on their couch for a few days and they were kind enough to help out. The next few days were extremely hard as I had to tell the landlord that I was moving out. He was concerned, asking me a bunch of questions such as if I was in trouble and gave me back my deposit telling me not to worry about the hole in the drywall. 

The most embarrassing part was asking him to help me load my meager possessions into my car as I wanted him there if anything else happened. Of course there was nothing going on and even the hole showed some exposed wood and wires beyond. We parted ways as he shook my hand and said “Yer a good kid, don’t let this place get ta ya so much y’hear?” Karma seemed to be on my side as my friend was losing a roommate and asked if I wanted to fill their slot and of course I jumped at the chance. 

Sleep at first didn’t come easy as those things haunted my nightmares as there were times I could not sleep. However, unlike other times this incident seemed to have unlocked something deep inside of me. Whereas I could not create any art for weeks in a matter of days I had a series of paintings done. One of my roommates saw the paintings which was more of an abstract showing different tones of gray on a lighter background and wanted to show his friends. I thought nothing of it at the time and said sure and that jump started my career. 

Now my work has been featured in magazines as it can be found in galleries all over the world. The prices for my work may not be as exorbitant as some, however, with a bit of shrewd investing and a lot of luck I was able to secure myself a great homestead in a small town in North Dakota. When people ask me why I chose to move to this state instead of a busy city such as New York or Los Angeles I tell them the same thing I have told everyone in every interview. 

“No bugs.” 

However, something has happened recently that inspired me to write all of this and I hope to god it is my mind playing tricks on me. I was on my front porch creating another piece of art as the last remnants of the day cast their long shadows when I saw it. 

A singular black roach scuttled across the planks as it looked around for something. 

Enraged that this creature had intruded on my home I lifted my foot to squash it into oblivion when I heard a faint voice inside of my head before it splattered under my boot.

“DON’T!”
