I’ve never been good at writing stories. So this probably won’t be eloquent or scary in the way you want it to be. But I need to say this out loud, even if it’s just to strangers on the internet.

I worked maintenance and environmental logging in the Cascades. This was a couple years ago, back when I still thought I’d be doing forestry for life. Remote sites, trail monitoring, wildfire damage surveys — all solo stuff. You go out, do your logs, report back.

The place I’m talking about was called **Station 23**. They don’t call it that anymore. I don’t think they call it anything at all.

It wasn’t marked on the public maps. Some of the newer guys didn’t even know it existed until they were sent there. I only got assigned because a guy on rotation broke his leg, and they needed someone with backwoods experience. I said yes before I even checked the coordinates.

The first red flag? Everyone else had a reason why they couldn’t take it.  
“Oh, I’ve got a family thing.”  
“Yeah, my truck’s acting up.”  
“Is that the one with the leaning trees?”

That last one stuck with me.

The station was just a small wooden cabin tucked into an overgrown section of the trail system that hadn’t been used regularly in years. No cell service. No satellite ping. You had to check in by radio at noon and midnight. There was a weather tower, a trail camera logbook, and not much else.

It was quiet. I mean *too* quiet. No bugs. No wind. Even the pines didn’t creak when they swayed. Everything just... leaned slightly. Not in the same direction either — like the forest couldn’t agree on what vertical meant.

I didn’t feel scared at first. Just annoyed. I chalked it up to isolation.

But that first night, around 3 a.m., I heard the floorboards creak. I thought maybe a bear had wandered close, or a branch had fallen on the roof.

Then I realized the sound wasn’t *above* me.

It was *next to the window.*

I stayed frozen for a while. Long enough for my legs to cramp. When I finally got the courage to pull the curtain just a crack — there was nothing there.

Except… I swear the pine tree closest to the porch had moved.

It was **closer**. The angle had changed.

And there was this shape next to it — tall, white, and still — like a scarecrow carved out of bone and forgetting how to stand like a person.

By morning, I convinced myself I imagined it.

Until I walked the perimeter and saw **marks** on the ground.

Three long prints. Like human feet, but… too long. The arch reversed. As if something had feet but never learned how to walk right. And next to them, **drag marks** in the dirt, like fingers — but longer.

And in the tree bark: three deep gouges.

Not scratches.

**Pressed. In.**

The second night I tried to ignore it. Headphones. Whiskey. I even left the lights on, which we weren’t supposed to do.

But at exactly 3:13 a.m., the radio clicked on.

Dead channel. No call sign. Just static.

Then a voice.  
My voice.

“I see you seeing me.”  
“I see you seeing me.”  
“I see—”

I yanked the cord out of the wall.

But the voice kept going for **seven more seconds**.

I packed at dawn. Didn’t wait for reassignment. Told my supervisor I got spooked by a bear. Told my friends it was just cabin fever. Lied every time I felt that thing’s shape leaning behind my memory.

Because I *didn’t leave alone.*

I don’t mean physically. There was nothing in my truck.

But since that night, **I haven’t dreamed once.**

Not a single dream. Not even fragments.

And sometimes — just after I wake — I feel like I was awake the whole night. Watching something. Not dreaming, not resting. Just observing.

Waiting.

My reflection doesn’t always blink when I do.

And the trees outside my new apartment lean slightly inward — even the ones in separate pots.

Someone knocked on my window last week.

Third floor. No balcony.

Just three soft knocks.

Like knuckles.  
On glass.

If you're ever sent to Station 23 — don’t go.  
And if you *have* to go, **never stay more than one night**.  
And if you wake up at 3:13 a.m. and something is leaning against your window?

Don’t look.

Because if you see it…

**it sees you longer.**
