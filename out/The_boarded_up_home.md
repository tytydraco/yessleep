Ever since I was a little kid, there was a home on the outskirts of my small town, it was always boarded up,  me and the neighborhood children were told by everyone to stay away from that home, we never got a reason why.

One time a group of children, me included went to the home, we were only on the lawn... but there was an uneasy feeling.

 Jeremy, the popular kid, known for being 'fearless' decided to enter the home through a window, he was equipped with a flashlight, he came out 3 minutes later with a face that showed is that he clearly saw something in there, when we asked he simply said "You don't want to know."

We went home that night and never told our parents.

I haven't thought about that home for 13 years, recently me an my girlfriend Marie went back to my hometown to visit my parents. 

Marie has always been the type to be interested in abandoned buildings, she always likes seeing how they look and the stories they can tell from observing them.

When we passed the home on our way to my parents she asked if we could go see the place sometime during our visit. 

I said we could go the next day, if I'm being honest I always thought Jeremy saw a dead animal or some homeless guy in there.

The next day we went in through the back door of the home, which only had one board that was easy to pry open, we looked around the rooms of the place, Marie found what appeared to be the journal of the homes previous owner, the book was dusty but in decent condition, we decided to stop exploring and come back the next day.

Later that night Marie and I started to read the journal, what we found seemed to be the crazy ramblings of a  madman

The details of the journal talked about witchcraft and hexes and all of that stuff

Then we turned to an interesting page 

According to the journal there was a woman in our town back when it was just a small village, she was caught using magic and was chased down to her home, her home was lit on fire by the towns people, before her death she said

"For your sins of burning me... when my body sees the sun... a plague will be casted onto everyone who is in this village."

The rest of the journal detailed of how the author and 3 other men put her body in the basement of the home, they made sure that no sunlight would ever get in by boarding up all the windows of the home.

We laughed it off as an insane rambling from some crazy guy.

The next day the 2 of us decided to go back to the home, this time we entered through the window that Jeremy entered through all those years ago.

The window was right by the staircase leading to the basement, since Marie and I haven't gone to the basement we decided to go there.

When we went down, our phones suddenly shut off, and we couldn't turn them back on.

I decided to break a window to let in some sunlight so we could see better.

When we got a good look we saw what Jeremy must have seen all those years ago.

There was the mummified corpse of a woman laying on a bed, the sunlight blazing directly into her face.

We felt some wind come in and we thought we heard someone wisper "You set me free"

The body soon turned to dust, we bolted out of there and drove back to my parents home

When we arrived to my parents home later that night we say my mother puking into the toilet, my father was bedridden.

The next day we started to head back home, when we went around town before leaving we saw nobody, we then heard on the radio of a strange illness that was affecting the town.

That's when it clicked

That was the body of the witch from the journal, she unleashed the plague to everyone in the town... all except for Me and Marie...
