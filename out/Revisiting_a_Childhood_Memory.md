I grew up living a nomadic lifestyle. My family and I were born in the Philippines. However, through a series of events, my father managed to immigrate to Canada, specifically to the bustling city of Toronto. After spending my kindergarten and grade 1 years there, we moved to the state of Washington, thanks to a sketchy drafting company that offered my father a green card. I spent much of my childhood in the beautiful city of Bellevue, from grades two to seven and a half. Unfortunately, the company decided not to renew my dad’s green card, so we were forced to move back to Canada, this time to the peaceful town of Edmonton. At least the job that my father took was much more reliable and stable.

However, there is one childhood memory that has always stuck with me, which is why I was in Washington last month, but ended up driving back to Edmonton three weeks ago. I remember, while my family was not looking, I explored the enchanting forests of one of the islands on the west coast. I do not remember which one, but I know it was a forest in the one of the San Juan Islands. As a child, I always thought the forests there were both beautiful and powerful, like they beheld some sort of magic you read about in fairy tales—faeries, unicorns, goblins, those sorts of mythical creatures.

I remember seeing a large grey boulder in the middle of the forest. Unlike the other rocks, it was not covered in moss. No, this one was different. There was something on top of it, some kind of mineral, possibly white quartz. But the oddest thing was that it looked like someone had carved a perfect monolith out of the quartz growing on top of this boulder. I decided to climb on top and take a closer look. I remember almost touching it, but I got really scared when it suddenly turned black. I ran out of that forest like there was no tomorrow and hugged my mom. She told me everything would be alright and that I would always be safe with them.

That was nearly fifteen years ago.

Today, a random article popped up in my news feed. A woman was found in the woods of one of the San Juan Islands in poor condition. She looked like she had been living there on her own for a week. Her mental state was clearly unstable as she kept repeating, "Don’t go in there! There’s a world in there not meant for us! I have seen it! Crystal on stone!" No one could determine the source of her instability, but she is being treated in an undisclosed mental institution until she can get back on her feet.

Somehow, this brought back that particular childhood memory. Considering that my new job would not start for another two months, I figured I would pay the San Juan Islands a visit.

It took me two days to drive all the way to that one island on the west coast. For some reason, I still cannot remember the name of that one island in the San Juan Islands. I will blame it on the trauma I experienced there. I remember setting up camp in one of the popular campgrounds. For some reason, it was empty today. It might have been because of that article I read. It most likely spooked a lot of the locals or tourists for the season. Hard to believe, though, given the popularity of this place.

The next day, after a peaceful rest in my camp, I retraced my steps based on my memory. Now, mind you, memory is such a fickle thing. It will always warp or change as you get older. This is why you should never rely on it unless you absolutely must. Sadly, today was one of those days where memory was my only “reliable” source. I must have backtracked so many times as I kept getting lost. Somehow, after five hours, I finally found a familiar path. I recognized it due to the unusual number of rocks in the area. Boulders upon boulders covered in moss. I do not know why I cannot recall this in my childhood memory, but these boulders appear to form some sort of wall. It is not a large wall, probably, on average, three feet tall. But still, completely unusual. If it was manmade, then these people must have been built of pure muscle to even do this. But that still does not answer the question of why.

I climbed over the rocks and saw the usual ferns and trees that covered the land. However, the rocks appeared to form a circular fence. It felt fairly small, maybe 600 feet in diameter. I walked towards the center and saw that one moss-less boulder from my childhood memory. It seemed the same, but the quartz crystal may have grown. It looks larger now than what I recall. Now it seems to cover roughly one-eighth of the top of this large grey boulder. The color seems to be the white that I have seen before. I approached it and looked at it in close detail. It looks extremely smooth, as if someone spent a lot of time polishing and refining this one quartz stone. It looks like those monoliths that they sell at the gem stores. However, this one was a little bigger, roughly sixteen inches tall and maybe four inches thick.

As I continued to observe it, I flinched as it suddenly turned completely black. However, this time, I was not afraid. Somehow, I was mesmerized by it, entranced by it. It looked absolutely stunning. I had to have it. So I decided to touch the crystal. I tried to pry it out of the boulder with my bare hands, but I was unable to. After a few seconds, I gave up and decided to return to camp and call it a day.

However, as I turned around, I noticed that everything had changed. Instead of the beautiful trees and ferns that surrounded the region, I was now in the midst of a forest of large, tall obelisks and monoliths composed of quartz or something similar. Some of them stood perfectly straight, while others were crooked, leaning at odd angles as if defying gravity. The air felt different, heavier, and there was an eerie silence that replaced the usual sounds of the forest.

I looked up and saw that the sky was an impenetrable black, devoid of sun, moon, or stars. Yet, somehow, it illuminated the ground where I stood. The light was diffuse and unnatural, casting an eerie glow over the landscape and making the monoliths shimmer with an otherworldly radiance.

The ground beneath my feet seemed to be replaced by a black glass-like material, reminiscent of obsidian. It was smooth and reflective, casting distorted images of the towering monoliths around me. As I took a cautious step, the surface felt cold and unyielding, sending a shiver up my spine. The obsidian-like ground stretched out in all directions, creating a surreal and otherworldly landscape.

I looked around, trying to make sense of my surroundings. The once familiar forest had transformed into an alien world, and I felt a growing sense of unease. The monoliths seemed to pulse with a faint, inner light, casting an otherworldly glow that illuminated the darkened landscape. Shadows danced and flickered, creating the illusion of movement among the towering structures.

As I stood there, trying to comprehend what had happened, I noticed a faint, rhythmic humming sound. It seemed to emanate from the monoliths themselves, resonating through the air and vibrating in my chest. The sound was both unsettling and strangely hypnotic, drawing me further into this strange new world.

I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves. I knew I had to find a way back to the familiar forest, but the path I had taken was no longer visible. The obsidian ground and the towering monoliths created a labyrinthine landscape that seemed to stretch on endlessly. I felt a pang of fear, realizing that I was truly alone in this strange place.

Determined to find a way out, I began to walk, carefully navigating the uneven terrain. The monoliths loomed overhead, their smooth surfaces reflecting the faint light. As I moved deeper into the forest of obelisks, I could not shake the feeling that I was being watched, that unseen eyes were tracking my every move.

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught glimpses of shadowy figures, perhaps ghosts. They appeared as dull grey shapes, lacking any well-defined form. No humanoid shape, no animal shape—just formless entities. Each one seemed to radiate an expression of pain and sorrow, and a sense of dread and pity fell onto me. Whenever I turned to look directly at them, they would vanish, leaving only a lingering sense of unease. The air around me felt heavy, as if their suffering was a tangible force pressing down on me.

I quickened my pace, hoping to outrun the unseen stalkers. The path ahead seemed to stretch endlessly, the obsidian ground reflecting the distorted images of the monoliths and the formless entities that haunted me. Shadows danced at the edges of my vision, and I could hear faint whispers, like the rustling of leaves in the wind, but with an eerie, mournful tone.

Every now and then, I would catch a fleeting glimpse of a twisted form, a flash of grey in the periphery. My heart raced, and I quickened my pace, hoping to outrun the unseen stalkers. The path ahead seemed to stretch endlessly, the obsidian ground reflecting the distorted images of the monoliths and the formless entities that haunted me.

The further I walked, the more the entities seemed to close in. Their presence grew stronger, the air around me thick with their anguish. I could feel their pain as if it were my own, a deep, gnawing sorrow that threatened to consume me. I stumbled, my legs growing weak under the weight of their suffering.

Desperation clawed at my mind as I searched for a way out. The forest of obelisks and monoliths seemed to twist and shift, creating a labyrinthine maze that offered no escape. The entities were always there, just out of sight, their silent torment a constant reminder of this strange, otherworldly place I had stumbled into.

Suddenly, a memory clawed its way into my mind from the deepest recesses of my brain. I remembered my mother once telling me, “Remember, if you are ever lost, always go back to where you came from. It will be much easier to find your way home from there.” I quickly pondered what that meant, then I realized: I must have somehow teleported from the rock with the quartz monolith on top. I did not know if this was true, but I decided to take a chance on it as that was my only hope for escape.

I decided to run back from where I came, somehow remembering the intricate details during my traversal of this vast alien landscape. Within a few seconds of running back, I stopped, noting that I did not see any of those eerie entities in the corner of my eyes. The humming sound seemed to vanish. The lights emanating from the obelisks began to fade.

I froze in shock as I saw what the radiating lights had been hiding. People were trapped in these motionless monoliths. Each one continuously twisting, morphing, and rearranging themselves in seemingly impossible ways. Their faces were contorted in expressions of pain and anguish, tears streaming down their cheeks. The sight was both horrifying and heartbreaking, a tableau of eternal suffering that I had never seen or felt before.

Among the trapped were campers, their outdoor gear and hiking boots now twisted grotesquely with their bodies. Businessmen in suits and ties, their briefcases fused to their hands, looked out with eyes full of despair. There were even people who appeared to be from the 1800s, dressed in old-fashioned attire—women in long, tattered dresses and men in waistcoats and top hats. Their historical clothing only added to the surreal and nightmarish quality of the scene.

The figures within the monoliths seemed to be in a constant state of torment, their bodies shifting and warping as if trying to escape their crystalline prisons. Some appeared to be reaching out, their hands pressed against the smooth surfaces, while others were curled up in fetal positions. Yet, no matter their position, something always morphed them into shapes that appeared excruciatingly painful. The sheer intensity of their suffering was overwhelming, and I felt a deep sense of fear and pity wash over me.

I felt something behind me. It felt off, wrong even. I felt I was being hunted. I had the strongest sensation that they were hungry. From everything I had learned from reading or watching horror stories, I decided to stick to one of the rules that may have saved my life that day: do not turn back, run. And that is what I did. I ran like hell. I ran for what felt like miles, always following the places that I recognized in this vast forest of obelisks.

By sheer force of luck or perhaps my rather strong short-term memory, I ended up at the boulder with the quartz on top. As I approached it, I noticed that it changed from black to white. I took this as my cue to grab the quartz and pry it like I did before. However, I could still see the forest of obelisks surrounding me, and the feeling of dread kept getting stronger and stronger. I closed my eyes, hoped for the best, and kept pulling and tugging at the quartz.

Then I fell onto the ground. It felt soft this time. My hands felt the cool, familiar texture of dirt. I opened my eyes and saw that I was back in the beautiful evergreen forest of the San Juan Islands. But the feeling of dread and danger still loomed over me. I looked at the crystal and saw that it was not only emanating black, but also radiating and shimmering with all sorts of colors. I did not ponder on this though; I quickly sprang to my feet and started to sprint towards my camp.

As I ran, I heard a crackling sound behind me. It appeared to be following me closely. I quickly climbed over the makeshift boulder fence and continued to run. Though I no longer heard that sound, I never looked behind me. After what felt like hours of running, I found the familiar camping spot where I had set up. I did not bother to pack up my tent. I just ran for my car, turned on the engine, and drove to the nearest ferry point to get off this damned island.

From there, it took me two days to drive back to Edmonton, almost non-stop.

Today, three weeks after that awful event, I received a letter from the parks department in Washington state. They fined me $596.34 for the tent that I left behind. I was okay with that since my life is worth far more than that. I also received a peculiar letter from an organization called the Institute. They notified me that they were aware of my presence in the area and mentioned that they had noticed strange activity there for quite some time.

The letter included instructions on how to arrange an interview with them to share my experiences. They assured me that the interview would be hosted at one of their nearby locations to provide a safe and private environment.

Considering that no one else believes me, I figured I might as well contact them and set up an interview. After all, what is the worst that could happen?
