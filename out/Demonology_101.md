I never meant for anything real to happen, but here we are. I'm sorry, everyone. I know that you're reading this and I'm sorry. 

Course #1: Intro to Goetics

Demons are no joke, and deserve no pity. You will never strike a deal that doesn't come at a frightening cost. You will never attain fame, power, status or money. Give it up now.

Electricity doesn't feel anything when it shocks you, and a snake doesn't regret it when it pumps venom into your heel. Sigils are just circuitry and demons are just machines. Nothing to praise there.

Okay, okay. I know. On the outside I kinda put forward that whole “hail Satan” shtick, but I was always more of a modernist, nothing esoteric. That's why I sort of shit myself when the ouija board actually worked. I thought the four of us would all tug at the looking piece like toddlers, but there it went, zipping along, telling its name, its age. (I don't remember either, but they were far too large for any human.)

This was my first real encounter.

It listed each of our birthdays. A string of six numbers for each of us, going around the circle in a clockwise motion. It took a minute for us to figure out what it was doing. 

It then gave us another sequence of four days, which I've now discerned to be our death dates. For the privacy of those involved I won't disclose theirs. 

As consolation, I'll tell you mine. 

10/13/25

My date was the last in the chronology, and I don't have much time left. I've resolved to write down as much as I can before that day comes. I'm not sure how much of it I'll actually be able to get down, but I'll keep posting for as long as I can. The board has told only the truth so far. 

Brie (yes, like the cheese) was the first to hop up and dart out of the room, face in her hands.

Then Jaxsyn. It spelled out the name of his late mother. That was enough for the little guy. 

Last it was just Grace and I. We were both trying to prove something to each other, I think. I saw her smirk through the tumbles of sanguine curls that made up her hair. 

We weren't attempting to summon anything in particular, just communicating with the spirit that Brie mistakenly thought might be in her house. As it turns out, “spirits” as we imagine them don't exist, but I’ll explain that later. Might have to stuff it in 102, but we'll see if I make it to that point. 

I was never really that into any of the big Satanist stuff. I drew a few sigils, lit a candle or two. I did try to manifest a relationship with a couple of demons, but nothing serious. Mostly the kind ones, the softies. Stolas, Purson, the like. Nothing ever answered, so I basically threw out that whole way of thinking until lately. I just assumed the cool little owl dude could help me learn guitar or whatever. Instead, I caught the attention of something unwanted.

Think of whenever you cast a line, fishing. The hook goes out there, but you can't see where it's dangling, and you can't predict what will grab hold until you reel it in. Sometimes you go for a bluegill and end up with a bass. 

We ended up hooking a snake.

Grace and I began crying blood, and though we had no reason to be sad, we both sobbed uncontrollably. Jaxsyn watched, concerned, from the doorframe. My hair was on end, every fiber of my being saying to run, but my brain just kept thinking the same thing:

“Too bad she's an ugly cryer.”

That whole thing about saying goodbye to the board is real, but that doesn't really matter at this point. It's like hitting escape, backing out of a sketchy site before you catch a virus. When you walk away without hitting X all you've done is minimize the presence at hand. It kept running in the background, even after we ran out of the house and burned the board in Jaxsyn’s father's burn pit. 

The demon I met that day has stayed with me since. It stayed with my friends, lurking just behind their retinas. If you've gathered nothing else from this lesson, then at least believe this: do not trifle with demons. The type of malware isn't worth it.
