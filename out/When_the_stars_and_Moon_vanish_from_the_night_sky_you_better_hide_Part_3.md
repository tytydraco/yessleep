Cold water dropped down onto my neck from a broken pipe on the ceiling. The bunker hallway was narrow, digging much further into the ground than I could have anticipated. Along the way, it was illuminated by dim, fluorescent bulbs that flickered as we passed, just barely enough to light up the path before us. 

Neither of the two soldiers spoke a word as they led us underground, instead making sure we didn’t make any quick, unexpected movements. Though it felt better being surrounded by armed men, the anonymity caused by their gasmasks didn’t exactly instill any sense of confidence. Still, anything beat dealing with the horrors lurking in the darkness above ground. 

“Why are you wearing masks?” Roger asked, a question that was promptly ignored. 

“Where are you taking us?” Kassandra chimed in, garnering no response. . 

It took about two minutes of navigating the narrow corridors, before we finally arrived at an opening. We entered a larger room at the bottom of the bunker, one with another sealed door at its end. Three soldiers occupied the space, one of them lying in the corner with his guts torn apart. One of them attempted to tend to his wounds, but he seemed more perplexed by the lack of blood than anything. 

“Where the fuck did you find civilians?” one of them asked. His name read “Dawson.” 

“What’s going on here?” Kassandra asked. “Are you going to hurt us?”

“Just saved your life, didn’t we?” Perez responded, seemingly annoyed. 

The two of them removed their masks, revealing two young men, barely in their twenties. A third joined us, Petrosa. He was older than the rest, a battered, middle aged man with several scars running down his face. He didn’t look worried like the rest, showing no signs of fear. Instead he just appeared… tired. 

“How did you make it here?” he asked. 

“Luck,” was all I could think to say. “We took a car and just drove. I saw your convoy, where are the rest of you?”

“They found us,” Petrosa responded. “We’re all that’s left. I hope to God the other groups fared better.” 

“So the rest are…?” I began. 

“Dead,” he finished. “We didn’t stand a chance. Our weapons barely fazed them. We tried burning them, but they’re just too many.” 

He turned his attention to the wounded man on the ground, lying with his intestines exposed. Death would be his only relief, but it was a gift he’d never receive. 

“What are you doing here?” I kept on asking. 

He hesitated. It was obviously information he wasn’t allowed to disclose, that much was obvious. Yet, there was no chain of command remaining to punish him for breaking the rules. 

“I shouldn’t tell you. But, seeing as we’re all about to die anyway, you might as well die well educated.”

Once again he paused, checking the state of his men before continuing. “It took our team years to find a way into town. Seeing as anyone that crosses the border to Silverwood never seems to return. We figured you were a lost cause, a glitch in our reality. We knew there were otherworldly beings here, we just had no means of accessing them. That was until last year, when we found one of these things wandering around Arlington. It took a whole platoon just to destroy the thing. We then–” 

He was interrupted by a loud clunk that echoed throughout the bunker. 

“Shit,” he let out. “Alright, time to get our asses out of here!”

“They found us?” Kassandra half asked, half stated. 

Her question was quickly answered by another bang shooting through the bunker. 

“This tunnel leads to an underground network of caves. It’s where these fuckers come from,” Petrosa explained. “There are four entry points, and we sent a platoon to each of them. We better pray the rest of them had more luck than us.” 

As he explained the situation, the Praetors were banging on the doors, slowly, but certainly digging their way through the metal doors. 

Perez and Avery pulled the set of secondary doors open, revealing a wide tunnel expanding endlessly far ahead.

“What about Kaplan?” Perez asked, gesturing to the wounded soldier. 

“Carry him,” Petrosa ordered. 

“Fuck that,” Kaplan moaned. “I’m already dead. Just go.” 

Perez tried to argue, but he was quickly interrupted by the distinct sound of metal being forcefully bent. They were seconds away from getting through, leaving us with no chance of transporting a heavily injured man. 

“Hey, Petrosa, leave me one of your grenades for the basters, what do you say?” 

Petrosa and Avery handed Kaplan a couple of grenades. Mumbling some words of comfort to him, before gathering at the door. 

“Time to go,” Petrosa ordered, but he was too late. The outer doors had blown open, and within seconds the first Praetors had reached us. Their spindly, twisted bodies pulled themselves along the ground at impressive speeds, quickly reaching their first victim. Perez screamed in agony as they dug into his leg, tearing him apart instantly. 

Avery and Petrosa tried to save him, but it was no use. They were forced into the tunnel with the rest of us, trying to keep the monsters at bay with a hail of suppressive fire. 

“Fuck you!” we heard Kaplan yell, followed quickly by a massive explosion that reverberated through the tunnel. It was enough to tear the Praetors to shreds, but their vile bodies still kept moving, refusing to die. If nothing else, at least he had bought us a couple of minutes before they regrouped. 

Only the six of us even made it into the tunnel, desperately fleeing from an enemy that refused to die. Leaving only two soldiers with actual combat experience: Petrosa and Avery. 

“Keep moving!” Petrosa ordered, pushing us further down the narrow corridor, leading deeper into the ground below. 

The metal doors behind us had essentially fused shut from the blast within. While it would hinder the Praetors for a while, it couldn’t keep them locked inside forever. 

The air grew heavy as we proceeded, with the temperatures rising the further we descended down the sloping tunnel. Sweat poured down my back, mixing with blood seeping from wounds I hadn’t yet discovered. I’d been hit by shrapnel during the blast, and while it had only dug superficially into my flesh, it hurt like hell. 

“I don’t think this is the way out,” Roger said with worry in his voice. 

“It will lead to a central hub. We can leave through the additional access tunnels from there,” Avery shouted back. 

With my hearing damaged from the explosion, I could barely recognize their voices over the incessant ringing in my ears. I could tell the others were struggling too, based on them screaming despite being no more than five feet away from each other.

“I see something!” Kassandra called out, pointing down the tunnel. 

Sure enough, at the very end of our path lay an opening in the wall. Though it wouldn’t lead us to freedom, it at least seemed to enter into a larger space. 

“Almost there!” Roger announced. 

But our rush for the opening was quickly halted to the sound of multiple gunshots echoing through the tunnel. It appeared the other platoons had indeed made it to their target. But they weren’t there alone. 

“Are they some of yours?” I asked the soldiers. 

“We’ll find out soon enough. Stay behind me,” Petrosa said as he raised his rifle.

He took the lead alongside Avery, moving swiftly, but carefully towards the sound of the fighting. The closer we got, the more the sound of gunshots gave way to men screaming for their lives. It was a battle I knew they couldn’t win, yet they fought on to their last breaths. 

Petrosa singalled for us to stop, letting Avery get a peek into the opening. He took careful steps forward, ready to stick his head around the corner. But as soon as he even attempted to get a glimpse, he was forced back by a storm of fire that raged past the exit. He covered his eyes as they burned from the intense heat, groaning in pain. The burns were only superficial, leaving behind little more than a missing eyebrow. 

“Hold your fucking fire, we’re friendlies!” he screamed. 

With that, the fire stopped, pummeling the room into an eerie silence. Avery and Petrosa moved out from the tunnel, securing the area ahead. The rest of us followed closely behind. 

The tunnel ended in a massive chamber connected to various cave systems, extending endlessly far down into the ground below. All we could see at its end was a pitch black void emitting distant, humanoid screams. Our only footing was a set of rusty scaffolds extending all the way around the room, extending into several flimsy rooms and platforms hanging above the hole. Four exits were marked “A” to “D,” we had just entered through the latter. 

A man wielding a flamethrower stood on one of the extension platforms before us. The sole survivor of the battle. Chunks of his body had been torn out by the Praetors, guts and all, refusing to bleed. The wounds were definitely incompatible with life, but his body was too pumped full of adrenaline for the man to realize that he was supposed to be dead. 

“It’s alright, we’ve got you,” Petrosa said, carefully disarming the man, who promptly fell into his arms from pure exhaustion

“I have to burn them,” he mumbled, barely audible. “I have to burn them. Help me burn them.”

There were several charred bodies on the platform next to him, each a prior member of his squad. The fire had been a mercy for them, preventing their bodies from being consumed by the Praetors. Petrosa assessed the wounds, immediately recognizing their severity. 

“It’s gonna be alright, just relax,” he said with a fake sense of comfort. 

“We failed,” the man said. “We couldn’t end it. They came from the hole. They tore them apart. I couldn’t stop them.” 

“We’re here now. You don’t have to fight anymore,” Petrosa went on. 

With that, Petrosa pulled his sidearm from its holster, swiftly pointing it to the man’s head, before pulling the trigger. The rest of us could only stare in shock, surprised, but relieved that we no longer had to witness his suffering. 

“He doesn’t need to feel the flames,” Petrosa explained as he armed himself with the flamethrower. 

He took a step back from the mangled corpse, before unleashing a hellstorm of flames upon his body. Within seconds it turned to an unrecognizable charred mess. Only then did I realize that no one had even bothered to get his name, before sending him to the afterlife. 

But we were not given time to process his death, before being interrupted by the sound of shattering metal in the distance. It was coming from tunnel “D,” all the way back at the bunker at the end. The creatures had broken through the door, which meant they’d be all over us within minutes.  

“Aright. Let’s get to work. It’s time to end this nightmare,” [Petrosa said.](https://www.richard-saxon.com/books/)
