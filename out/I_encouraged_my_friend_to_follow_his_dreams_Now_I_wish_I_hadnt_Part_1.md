  

You know the feeling when an old friend whom you haven’t been in touch with for ages, suddenly texts out of the blue? Why now? Where the hell have they been? Do they genuinely want to get back in contact? Do *you*?

I had received a whole flurry of texts from various people a few nights ago, which was in itself rather disconcerting for a more-or-less confirmed hermit like me. Or at least, a hermit compared to most other guys my age. Presumably the stars had alighted perfectly for once, or something, prompting a number of my fellow-humans to reach out to me all at the same time. I would’ve found it easier to cope if such communications were more spread out, as it were. That’s me. Never satisfied. 

Anyway, I scanned the list automatically registering the names: Tom, Becca, Cody, Devon, Lyn. Plus a bunch of messages from a friendship group that for some unfathomable reason I was part of. I didn’t regard or want them as friends but I hadn’t the guts to tell them that, or even just leave. Yeah, I know. Weak.

I looked through the messages. 

Becca: Hey. Wanna catch up this weekend?

Tom: Sorry to dump this on you man (*cue a whole long sob story*)

Lyn: My dear Jay, how are you? Sorry I haven’t been in touch for a while. Hope you’re keeping well.

Cody: Sending ……

Devon. Hi! Just giving you a heads-up (*cue details of a big family meet-up*)

Can you guess which of these messages shook me up the most?

Becca’s message, on the face of it, should’ve given me the most joy. She was a girl, and a rather pretty one at that, whom I had recently met at a party -  a once-in-a-blue-moon event by my standards. Pretty girls were a species I scarcely ever encountered these days, and I couldn’t tell if she really wanted to get together with me in any meaningful way or not. Evidently my radar concerning such matters was all messed up. But I have to admit her message didn’t stir up as many emotions as the others’. 

Tom’s annoyed the hell out of me. He was a work colleague who rarely ever stooped to directly communicate with me but now he was asking me to come in next day – my day off – on a matter of life and death apparently. Devon was a cousin of some sort (I had never quite figured out the exact relationship) inviting me to a family gathering - such family as I still had - in a months’ time. To be fair, he had given me plenty of warning, and I should be able to get my excuses in. Lyn was a sweet old lady who had been a friend and neighbor for years. She evidently saw herself in some kind of mother role towards me, a substitute for the parents I had never really had, and I was grateful for that, but we didn’t keep up as often as we once had since I had moved out of my home district and into my current apartment.

And Cody. The old friend reaching out after almost a year. 

It had to be. I didn’t know many other Codys, and it was his old number. 

I just sat there for a few moments, the phone in my hand. It was an odd and unexpected message to say the least but before I set myself to ponder just what it could mean I began to reminisce, naturally, over the old days. Cody and I had met in our teens, when we had some unfortunate experiences in common. But I hadn’t seen much of him in the last three years, and the last time I had seen him had been at his homecoming, eighteen months ago. His homecoming from prison.

It had all begun with that damn fool writing group. I mean, the counselling or support or whatever you want to call it, that goes around recommending writing therapy to people. People that are supposed to be in need of such a thing. People like Cody Erhardt. And, to a lesser extent, me. 

Do you really want me to go into the background of it all? Let me just summarize by saying that we were a classic pair of troubled teens, from broken, unloving (etc, etc) homes. Our stories were no different from a hundred thousand others. And we didn’t want to attend counselling. But finally, more out of curiosity than anything else, we did. That was where we first met.

To everyone’s surprise Cody rather took to the writing suggestion when it came up. Honestly you wouldn’t have thought it to look at him. The saying ‘don’t judge a book by its cover’ seemed particularly apposite in this case. Nothing bookish about him at all, never had been. I would have thought that writing would be the last thing on earth he would ever want to be involved in. He was too good-looking for one thing. Not that writers can’t be good-looking I suppose. But anyway, I’m drifting off the point. Evidently there was something that had long been hidden in him, a vein of creativity that took off at the slightest encouragement. 

At first, I ribbed him a little about the dangers of ending up as a cringy poet or something. But poetry wasn’t his thing. Nor journaling either. Instead the damned group set him afire with the idea of writing stories. Actual stories. And admittedly there was enough material in his life already to set him up. Family dysfunction, substance abuse, dropping out of high school, girlfriend troubles, even a magnificent RTA. Even though we trod similar paths his life had already been crammed with far more significant incident than mine. Whoever heard of a writer with the first name Cody, though? I sure as hell hadn’t. No doubt I’m being too judgemental again but it didn’t seem a literary name to me at all. Maybe he could set a precedent.

As for me, I would be his agent. I wasn’t bitten by the literary bug myself, as such. I just wanted to get involved on the mercenary side of things. 

(Yet here *I* am telling this story – his story, mainly.)

The long and short of it is, I encouraged him to write when no one else did. The writing group fever might have worn off soon enough otherwise, but it was I who kept egging him on. 

But before he really got down to it, he said, he had to find even more material. More incident, ever more vivid, dramatic. At least that’s what he believed, but I was of the private opinion that he was in danger of becoming a flat-out bore. 

Not long after the counselling sessions, Cody embarked upon a totally wild career. Fights/injuries, a deliberate smash-up this time, and dedicated drug-dealing, not just taking. And only I understood why he was doing these things. Collecting more writing material, to make a sensational novel. Everyone else said, or at least intimated, that it was just the predictable result of his upbringing. I did try to get him to tone things down a bit, but evidently I didn’t try nearly hard enough. I blame myself now for that of course. Before he got *too* out of control, though, some prison time intervened, as the courts did not look sympathetically on his writing alibi.  

He didn’t seem to mind prison at all, in fact he welcomed it as it gave him the chance to get on with his writing. And of course prison life itself furnished him with more material. The best thing, when he came to write it all properly, would be that all this colorful stuff would have the ring of absolute authenticity. He had literally lived all this shit. There would be genuine conviction in every word. 

And yet, you know, he still wasn’t quite satisfied. 

‘I want to write something original,’ he confided to me seriously on one of my visits. 

To be honest, that would be quite an agreeable turn for his literary career to take, and I said so, as tactfully as possible. He shook his head.

‘I don’t mean just – *unusual,* or offbeat, or anything. That’s what you’re thinking, right?’

I shrugged. ‘Well –‘

There was a faraway look in his eyes. ‘I mean – something *really* original. Something that literally no one has ever written before. Not ever.’

‘Well, that’s probably impossible,’ I pointed out. ‘There’s nothing new under the sun. Didn’t someone say that over 2000 years ago? And that probably holds truer for literature than anything else,’ I added, rather caustically.

He looked at me with his piercing dark eyes, and grinned suddenly. ‘You were the only one who ever really encouraged me to write. You’ll be the first to get my manuscript when it’s done.’

It sounded less of a promise than a threat, I thought, although no doubt he meant it kindly, in the spirit of our old friendship. 

‘Well, thanks,’ I said, trying to make it sound enthusiastic.

‘You’ll see – when I get it all into shape.’ 

I wondered how many more years that would take, but didn’t say it aloud. Instead, I smiled back. ‘Sure. Look forward to it.’ I added jokingly, ‘Surprise me.’

Like I said, the last time I’d seen him was at his homecoming from prison, arranged by his official girlfriend at the time (a different one to when he’d gone in). Her name was Sophie Redmond and she wasn’t over-friendly, at least to me, but she seemed smitten enough with Cody. During the meal, I sat on one side of him while she sat on the other, and I tried to gauge mentally where he was at. There was something different about him now. That was what prison life can do to you, was my first thought, naturally. But actually, as far as I could gather nothing very terrible had happened and he hadn’t been in for the worst kind of offences anyway. It was just that he seemed more distant than formerly. I asked him about the writing of course. That was the one thing that seemed to jolt him out of his reverie.

‘Going good, thanks,’ he replied shortly. I couldn’t help but feel I had hit a nerve.

‘Got any original ideas?’ I more than half-suspected he hadn’t managed to get anything down at all.

‘You’ll see it when it’s time,’ was all he would say.

And that was the last time I’d seen him. For some reason our once-solid friendship didn’t seem so solid after all. Perhaps his current girlfriend was the hawk-type that kept her claws (not to mention her beak) in him, preventing him from seeing his old friends and all, but then he wasn’t the type to be dominated by anyone. There was just … something on his mind. Not really a matter of re-adjusting to life outside of prison, either, he hadn’t been in that long (he’d served less than two years of a four-year stretch). Maybe he really *was* just preoccupied with the idea of writing something genuinely original. 

In any case, I wasn’t in too much of a hurry to see him again. Mainly, because I regretted ever having encouraged his writing delusions. I’d long ago stopped expecting to make any kind of money out of any kind of literary project, of course, that had only ever been a youthful fantasy. But I regretted ever having encouraged him in his writing when he did all those stupid things just to get his material. Although now he was going to try for something original. Wonder how that would turn out? Anyway, I was happy to give him some space for a while.

And now he was in touch again.

I sat irresolutely for a while, then texted my reply.

Cody! What’s up my man? Long time!!

Reading it over, my message had the odd effect of seeming both effusive and stilted at the same time. That was how I felt about Cody’s sudden re-appearance (in a manner of speaking) after so long.

I waited for his reply. None came. I sent a couple more messages, without result. I tried calling, and the line rang out.

He was playing the cryptic game.

The first sense of unease settled on me but I shook it off impatiently. Mainly I just felt rather bamboozled. And I was being rather slow, because it wasn’t until I went out into the hall, to check my front door was locked, and I saw something lying on the mat, that it hit me just what Cody was on about. 

‘Sending’ could only mean one thing, from Cody. All this time he’d been working like a *real* hermit, shut away in his ivory tower getting his material into shape. And now he had sent his first manuscript to me! Trust him to do it this way, in so sudden and dramatic a fashion. I didn’t know how I felt being the recipient. Mixed emotions for sure. I would have to be honest. But I wasn’t a literary expert. But he knew that anyway. It was just because of our old friendship. 

But on stooping to the mat, I saw that ‘manuscript’ was rather a glorified description. It was literally just one sheet of paper – rather thick and rough to be sure, more like an artist’s canvas actually. Although of course a manuscript *could* just be one sheet, but still… And was this all he had come up with after his seclusion?

*I did it.*

*Hell to the yeah*

*Watch me burn, man. I’m hot.*

That was what I read, in what certainly looked like Cody’s handwriting, but at the time I hardly registered the words, because I had noticed something else that made me gasp. The paper was spattered with what looked, and smelled, uncommonly like dried blood.

I groaned aloud. Was this meant to be some type of artwork! Cryptic messages! And sending his manuscript like this in this ominous fashion, so that it arrived late at night. Damn Cody. He just couldn’t stop with the cliches. He’d made sure to set it up like a goddammed stupid fucking horror movie. 

The feeling of unease was strong upon me now. I checked outside my apartment but all was quiet. So he’d come all the way to post it, and then just left before he could be seen? Goddam him.

Shaking my head, I went back to examining the ‘manuscript’.

Those stains – *were* they actually blood? I’m not exactly a forensic expert but like I said they really did seem to be. Well as long as it was his own blood and no-one else’s, I thought moodily. And not a goddam cat’s or anything, either. But surely he had never been the type to go around sacrificing cats, or was I being too hopeful? 

And then I started worrying about the amount of blood. True, the paper wasn’t *soaked* in it or anything, and the actual writing was just in ordinary blue ink. But the presence of the red stuff on any significant level naturally set alarm bells ringing.  Holy shit, what *had* he cut? 

And what did the writing mean? What the hell was it all about?

I checked my phone again. No more messages, of any kind, from anyone. 

I just stood for a while, wondering what the hell to do. I even began to think that maybe I should call the police, or something.

But, in the event, it was the police who contacted me.
