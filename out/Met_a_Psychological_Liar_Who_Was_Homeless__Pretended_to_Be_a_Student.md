this is honestly a lot for me to say so i’m going to do my best. it gets progressively worse as u read. i met a guy named bryce who i was introduced to from a friend group of his. he seemed cool so we started talking more often and got more closer. 2 days i believe out of the week he has borrowed 2 jackets of mine that belonged to my dad, also being the only jacket i had of my dads. it was a rainy cold day and i didn’t want him to walk without anything to keep him warm. i’d do this for any of my friends.

we agreed that the jacket would be given to my friend who introduced us in the first place and that my friend would give it to me. months seem to pass by and i realized that i haven’t gotten my jackets back and it’s usually not normal for someone to keep my stuff for that long. however, prior to this i’ve been consistently asking for my stuff back but bryce always made excuses as to why he couldn’t atm or would set a date on when he’ll bring it and never does. multiple people told me that i wasn’t going to get it back but i didn’t believe them because we were good friends. i bring this up to my friend and he claims that whenever he tried to pick it up, it was never on him. 

after time has passed by and me constantly asking for my stuff back he finally admitted a half truth that he did not in fact have my jackets and preceded to tell me that he was evicted from his student apartment and that they put some of his stuff locked in the room and some of the stuff locked in the garage. as someone who’s went through eviction, i know that it’s illegal for an apartment building to withold any of ur items after you’ve been evicted, that’s the whole point of it being thrown out. so when i realized this and realized that he was barely telling me the truth i was really mad because i’ve been lied to for months for no reason.

however it doesn’t end here, after his friends realized that i’ve been constantly asking for my stuff back. one of his friends told me how he took her stuff and never got it back. i quickly realized something felt off so i told another friend of mine who then exposed a big truth. bryce is known to be a senior who specializes in art education. he talks about how he has stuff in galleries and how this is way of live and also how he’s a student teacher for an art class. so what was the truth?? it was all fake. we found out that his art was never real, he was screenshotting another artist work and posting it. so we thought why would someone who is getting an art degree do this? especially since it could ruin your chances of graduating. like he doesn’t even copy the art down. he just posts screenshots and make it seem his own. 

after me and his friends started questioning why he’d put his own degree at risk, especially as a student teacher. we found out that he was also never a student at our school. we have an open campus in the middle of the city so anybody is allowed to be here. i found out he wasn’t a student because i was told that his name never came up on the outlook emails that we have. the reason why this is a big shock is because #1 it means he was never a student teacher in art #2 his whole art persona isn’t real. just a fairytale that he kept on rolling with for so long and #3 there has been numerous times where i’ve been in the same study room as him in the library and he’d just casually jot random stuff about art on the on the board and claim that he’s preparing to teach his next class (keeping his lies believable even tho we didn’t ask) keep in mind that i’m dealing with a pathological liar. it’s really scary knowing that little fact because it was always constant. 

after finding out he wasn’t a student, i quickly learned that he was in fact homeless and has been staying with friends in their student apartments until he gets kicked out. which makes sense why his lie wasn’t adding up when he was kicked out and said his stuff was dispersed everywhere. as more people started finding out i also learned that he has SA’d a good friend of mine and that really took a toll on me because i knew the feeling.

as time goes by i also find out that he’s been manipulating and lying to all his friends so he was kicked out of the group then proceeded to manipulate other people and friend them in hopes of gaining something out of it. he is careless and a narcissist. when i even confronted him, he couldn’t say anything to me but deny it all and just stare at me. it hurts me so much knowing how far this person has went from lying about his own identity to using people to his benefit. he has been hopping from couch to couch and every time i try to warn people, they always end up believing him because again, you don’t just expect this from an average human being. 

one example is a friend of mine who i told that bryce staying at his place is a bad idea and that he should watch out for him. he took what i said a bit too lightly and the time he let bryce borrow his old phone, bryce ended up running off with it and never giving it back by the end of the school year as he was to. this ofc angered my friend and made him want to seek revenge. he went through the same experiences as me when i was first in denial about where my jackets couldve been. 

start of summer i really went through rough patches thinking that maybe i shouldn’t be here anymore. it was hard for me to deal with everything so it really broke my spirit and hope. it felt like i was the only person who truly can see this person was a walking demon ready to strike. after trying to get through it all i seen him again in the same house as my friend that i was hanging out with. my friends roomate ended up inviting bryce and i didn’t know until i was leaving my friends room to go home. there bryce was just sitting on the couch, waiting to do dr*gs there for free knowing that he’s not real to anybody in there. after i left i quickly told my friend and he said he’d take care of it right away (he didn’t know what bryce looked like but he knew the back story bc i’ve mentioned it a lot). it still pains me to see that people really think that this awful person has any ounce of empathy or genuineness to him. it hurts so much because they’ll never understand what kind of person he is until he makes them his next victims. i felt this anxiousness come over me when i seen him and i just wish people like that didn’t exist for this long. he’s just a homeless man who has nothing to lose and enjoys cosplaying as a college student in hopes of being validated by everyone as he claims that he’s one of one and the best. calling the police never helped because it’s not like i have anything they can build a case on. i just want the world to know my thoughts just in case…this might be the only i have out. 

if you read this far thank you so much. i don’t know what to do anymore & i’m just feeling lost. he’s telling people that im lying everytime we’re in the same room and it’s pretty funny because nobody brings it up but him. because of how guilty he is. i’m just glad im not the only one at school who has spoken up about this. it’s truly a tragedy having to encounter someone like this and i would never wish this on anyone. i just hope he pays the consequences some day. it’s dangerous being around someone who has nothing to lose in their life, making them capable of doing anything..and i feel like he knows that i’ve been onto him since day 1.
