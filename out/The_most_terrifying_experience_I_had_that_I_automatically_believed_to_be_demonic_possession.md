When I was in 8th grade (14-15 years ago, worst year of my life, at least school life) I woke up one night (shortly after falling asleep as I recall) and was thinking about a guy being teased that he smelled like baby powder but he said it was cologne. 

Completely unimportant, and nothing to do with me, but it happened during that day, and I woke up remembering it for some reason.

I was bullied a lot, and full of stress, but THAT is what I woke up remembering/thinking about, no idea why.

Anyway, I got up, walked into the hallway, and all of a sudden my legs just started running. I ran across the house into the kitchen wall, and got up and went to my mom in the living room watching tv on the couch.

I was panicking “something isn’t right”. All of a sudden I started BARKING LIKE A DOG, and screaming at the top of my lungs. I felt like something else was inside of me, controlling me.

My parents walked me outside because my sister was sleeping (if I was 13 she would have been 3) but miraculously she didn’t wake up from my, loud episode.

I started yelling at the sky “GOD PLEASE WAKE ME UP! I CAN’T WAKE UP!” I felt like I was stuck in between a waking and dreaming state. I put my arms around my mom and rapidly swung my fists into her back as I made animal/nonsense noises.

They guided me into the garage (probably to not wake up the neighborhood, it was kind of rural, but also kind of suburban so there were plenty of neighbors, just a bit more land in between houses) and it just, stopped. It literally felt like waking up from a dream. I was standing in the same place though, because I was PHYSICALLY awake the entire time, I had never had a history of sleep walking either, but plenty of night terrors (waking up screaming bloody murder but no memory of any actual dream). 

I can’t remember if I started taking Adderall before or after this terrifying experience, but I seemed to be stuck in a near constant terror and feeling of it happening again for the entire duration I took Adderall. Constant nightmares of it happening in school, but I only had one more actual episode, but it was WAY less severe and lasted much shorter.

But I experienced near constant feeling of it being about to happen all the time, with some breaks where it’d completely go away. But when it started, it was like everything got blurry, and I’d feel this absolute terror, I wish it was easier to explain. I’d head some type of drums banging louder or something, in my head not my ears.

I’d wake up in the middle of the night and feel absolute terror as if I was staring at a demon or Satan himself if I dared to look in the mirror. Looking at myself was a MASSIVE trigger, ESPECIALLY after waking up in the middle of the night.

When my parents took me to a mental hospital, they locked us in for hours waiting, but somehow decided I was safe to leave, the odds were not in favor of me being allowed to leave…..

I’d have rapid heart beating too. But after getting off of Adderall (a stimulant) this stuff seemed to fade away.

I have had occasional flashbacks, and plenty of nightmares, but generally not feeling that terror of being possessed. Although a year or two ago, I did start having more particularly terrifying vivid nightmares (one was seeing a cone headed creature literally in my head, kind of looked like Kamek from the Mario games, but it seemed like it was obviously supposed to represent some kind of evil demon inside of me, controlling me?

For a few days I had regularly occurring visions of demonic looking creatures, they felt so real like they were actually there, but I could only see them in my head, not my eyes. 

I’ve also woken up with scratches on my body multiple times over the years. But without feeling “possessed”, I shook it off as “maybe scratching myself in my sleep?”

Other than that, I’ve been fine most of the time, although I’ve had plenty of terrible intrusive thoughts. But I’ve read they’re normal, and common, and they’re just harmless thoughts. But could all these things be related?

A few days ago, out of nowhere, after 14 or 15 years, I felt it again. I woke up, felt normal, got up to wash my clothes. But as I was getting my clothes, that feeling just came out of nowhere. I felt the overwhelming power/forge taking over, like it was about to happen again. 

The closest thing I can think of is an adrenaline rush. When I have an adrenaline rush, it kind of feels like nothing is real, like the real world just doesn’t exist, like I’m in a dream, and the world I was living in was the dream? I’m not even that sure how to explain it. But it’s like real life was just a dream, like how when you wake up you realize you were just dreaming and it wasn’t real and means nothing now that you’re awake. It’s very jarring, bizarre, unsettling…..

The five senses aren’t equipped to properly process this feeling, or whatever is happening. 

Death sounds like the ultimate peace and relief, unless I go to Hell for all of eternity, if it’s real. But real or not, death is permanent. I’d be stuck in hell FOREVER.

But the few days ago, when I felt that, supposed demonic possession coming on, I actually PRAYED TO GOD, and it actually went away before it could happen. And years ago when I prayed I felt like I just summoned demons straight from hell. 

The next night I threw myself on my bed and choked/strangled myself and I don’t really know why. But before that my right arm kept sticking up when I laid down, and felt like gravity was pulling if up. It stayed that way for maybe 20 minutes or so while I watched YouTube videos, like it was doing it on its own. It felt like a fight to bring it down. I don’t know if I was just bored and giving myself a game to play or something, it was just strange. 

Sometimes my right hand seems to get in my face and hit me, and I fight it with my left hand. It doesn’t REALLY feel like I’m doing it, but it has to be me, right? (Yes I know about “Alien Hand Syndrome”).

I also make evil faces in the mirror sometimes, but I feel I may just be mocking that fearful experience I used to have…..

Don’t worry, I’m confused and don’t understand me either……

On one occasion I experienced the EXACT OPPOSITE, that I was SAVED. It was Easter, and I was praying over and over, OCD about it being right word for word, and one of those prayers just seemed to work. I felt Jesus was now my Lord and Savior and pure peace, and that there was nothing  to worry about and Heaven awaited me when I die. 

But a few hours later I watched South Park and the feeling wore off (because I sinned by watching it?).

I have experienced seemingly paranormal/supernatural things before, like seeing a shadowy dog beast figure approach me, wide awake not in bed, it disappeared when I shined a light on it. That same night it sounded like marbles on the roof or in the attic, and the microwave shut off early.

I also felt presences in a house my family was looking to rent. They hated the location anyway.

It’s hard to be a Christian, but it’s also hard to be an Atheist. I don’t think I can even call myself Agnostic either though.
