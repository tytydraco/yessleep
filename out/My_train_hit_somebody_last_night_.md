The detective sitting across from me looked like a stereotypical tv cop. He was gruff, sweaty, and sallow-skinned, with male pattern baldness and an 80s era moustache. He had a large, ropy scar that ran from just below the angle of his jaw down across the front of his neck. His eyes were bloodshot and glossy. 

“These things are tough. I’ve been investigating these types of cases for twenty years and they still keep me up. They’re suicides, mostly.”

“Ah fuck!” he exclaimed as he dropped his pen and massaged his right elbow. “God damned arthritis. Don’t get old, kid.”

I let out a half-assed chuckle, the kind you do to be polite and entertain somebody. I barely registered what he had just said; everything seemed surreal and hazy. Still.

We were sitting in an empty coach on the train. The faded fluorescent lighting cast a jaundiced glow on the cream-colored walls and vinyl faux-leather seats; these old coach interiors looked like the inside of a McDonalds circa 1995. 

“I realize you’ve been through a traumatic event tonight, but we have to get the report. We need to take formal statements from crew members as part of our investigation.”

I nodded. He cleared his throat and tapped his pen on his yellow notepad.

“Okay, so let’s start from when your engineer called in the incident on the radio.”

I’ve been a train conductor for the past nine years. My old man was a conductor as well, and retired last year after forty years on the job. He urged me to apply after a failed detour through college and a handful of odd jobs. It’s a good living, he said. Decent pay, good benefits, and a pension. There were a few downsides: the long hours, dealing with some difficult passengers, and monotonous routines. I didn’t mind the work though; I finally had enough seniority to hold a run that I liked, and it paid well enough that I didn’t need to put in much overtime to make ends meet. 

The other downside, the one that every railroader prays doesn’t happen to them, is dealing with their train hitting somebody. Statistically, most conductors and engineers will have at least one incident in their career. My father had three. He told me about his first one, a young woman who stepped out in front of his train in an apparent suicide. The thing he’ll never forget, he said, was that all of the victims were knocked clear out of their shoes from the force of the collision. He explained that the impacts usually occurred in one of two ways: the victim would either be struck by the plow on the front of the locomotive and be thrown like a rag doll, or they would go underneath the train and get crushed and cut to pieces by the wheels. The latter was obviously more grisly. It was horrible for the whole crew; the engineer would throw the brakes into emergency knowing that there was nothing they could do as they watched their train smash into the person. The conductor would have to get out on the tracks to search for the body. 

This was my last trip of the night. It was slow, and we had maybe a dozen or so passengers on board. Normally I would have had an assistant conductor with me, but he had called out sick and the company didn’t assign me a replacement for the evening. We were about seven minutes out from our last stop when I heard the unmistakable pop and whoosh of the train’s brakes going into an emergency application; the train shuddered and jerked as it slowed to a stop. The radio on my belt crackled.

“Emergency, emergency, emergency, train forty four to operations, over” my engineer called out, his voice calm but with an undertone of panic.

“Operations answering forty four, over.”

“We just hit a trespasser, just west of mile post twenty-one. Middle aged male, white shirt, just stepped out right in front of us, over.”

“Roger, we’ll start emergency services your way.”

“Forty four head end to the conductor, did you copy that?” my engineer asked me over the radio.

“Roger, I’ll be out on the ground checking.”

My heart was pounding. This was my first trespasser strike, our official term for these types of incidents. I remembered from our training classes the procedures to follow; to make sure it was safe to get off the train; to keep the passengers informed. I made an announcement over the loudspeaker. “Attention passengers, due to a medical emergency on the tracks we will be standing by here until further notice. Updates to follow.” Medical emergency—the company wanted us to use that phrase so as not to cause undue stress or panic to the passengers.

I put on my orange reflective safety vest, keyed open the coach door, and slowly made my way down the steps onto the ballast. I could smell the faint aroma of a wood stove in the chilly New England air. The gravel shifted slightly beneath my boots, and the dried brown leaves crunched with each step. It was otherwise dead quiet. Even the low rumble of the diesel locomotive seemed distant. There was nothing but forest on either side of the tracks; a vast expanse of wooded nothingness. 

The autumn moon cast a dim light over the train’s stainless steel coaches. I turned on my flashlight and started walking toward the rear of the train. I noticed a pair of black leather shoes off to the side of the tracks, maybe about six feet or so away. I could hear a dripping sound, so quiet that I wasn’t sure if I was hearing things. The dripping got louder as I continued walking. I shined my flashlight along the rails and bottoms of the coaches. One of the trucks—the component that the wheels and axles are attached to—was covered in a viscous red liquid. There was gray and red streaked jelly along the rims of the wheels. The dripping got louder. I directed my flashlight toward the end of the truck, and saw a small cascade of red fluid dripping and flowing down from it and onto the rail, like that elevator scene from *The Shining*. I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. My mouth felt wet. I could taste something sickly sweet. 

I slowly moved my flashlight’s beam further back, and there it was. 

*Fuck. Oh my God.*

A pale, crumpled body lay underneath the train, its white shirt adorned with maroon. The right arm was severed above the elbow, and a pulpy stump was all that remained where the man’s head used to be, a bit of spine poking out. The rest of his torso was contorted so that his chest was twisted nearly 180 degrees from the lower half of his body. His legs were folded out of sight underneath the—

“Okay, that’s all the info I need.”

The detective ran his hand over his neck, twisting his head side to side like he was stretching after getting off a long flight. 

“You’re all set. Sorry this happened.” 

He tucked his notepad under his arm and groaned as he got up from the seat. He shuffled quickly to the end of the coach and opened the door, disappearing out of sight into the vestibule. 

My mouth was dry. I was still replaying what I had seen, the image of that dead man, the blood, the severed head. 

The vestibule door slid open, and a portly middle aged woman with her hair tied back in a bun walked in. She had a badge on a lanyard around her neck, and a radio and pistol on her belt. 

“I’m detective Collins,” she said. “I’m here to interview you about this incident.”

“I just did the interview with the other detective,” I replied.

“What other detective? Im the only one here.”

*What the fuck?*

I slowly glanced down at where the detective had been sitting. A viscous red liquid had pooled where he had sat and dripped. Drip. Drip. Onto a pair of black leather shoes.
