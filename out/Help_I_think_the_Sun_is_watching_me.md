I think the Sun is watching me. Everywhere I go I feel its beaming tendrils on my back. It doesn't matter if it's midnight or raining. It doesn't matter if I'm in the basement or in an elevator, I swear her blazing heat is always on me. Its rays lick on my neck, back and forth dragging along the folds of my mind, she's always there. I know she's watching me, studying me. I’ve recently secluded inside deep into my house, I can't bear to see her, the Sun is watching me. I just know it. 

This all started about 2 weeks ago, I'm a freelance astrophotographer so I routinely set up my equipment in the backyard to photograph celestial bodies. This month I decided to embark on a bucket list endeavor, taking the clearest image of the Sun I could, it's sort of a right of passage among the online community. I have always had an appreciation for our star. The warm heat of the summer was always my favorite place to be. Not to mention the gorgeous magnitude of the Sun. Out of our whole solar system nothing compares to it. I am a bit of a space freak if you haven't noticed. Anyway, this June was predicted to be perfect viewing weather here in Arizona. I set up my simple planetary camera and began the long process of taking thousands of computer photographs of the Sun. This was a painstaking process that is easily screwed up by weather conditions and incorrect camera movements, but it is so worth it for the crystal clear photographs that are produced. If done correctly you'll see much more than an orange ball, but individual bursts of plasma, or the overlording dark spots that put the size of out Earth to shame. After about 5 hours of Sun exposure I began processing the photos. But to my great disappointment and confusion, there was no Sun.

The Sun wasn't in any of the 150,000 individual images. There was nothing. No stars, no planets, no flares. I combed through everything to try and see what went wrong. But it wasn't just blank either, there was *something* in these images, and it was moving closer with each photo. A black, overwhelming something. This simply made no sense, so thinking it was some technical error I switched to my Canon for a not as cool but more experimental style photo. I repeated the setup and shoot and once again, nothing. There was no Sun in my photos. Baffled, I quickly searched up if anyone else was having similar problems but anything I found was linked to some sort of tech failure. I know there was nothing wrong with my setup, I have been photographing close planets and comets for years now. So I shut down for the day and put my equipment back in the garage. That night I was plagued by her. I dreamt of the images on my computer, but each one had the Sun in it, an angry ferocious Sun, and it was looking right at me. Each image I tapped through there she was, her rays piercing through the screen and into my soul taking root. The Sun is watching me I thought, and with that I jolted awake. 

This psychedelic dream caused me to wake up late for work and rush out of bed, whatever weird celestial dreams I had would have to wait. But for the next week I couldn't get her out of my head. Everywhere I walked I just *knew* her eyes were on me. The thought of taking another photograph of anything in those heavens makes me want to vomit. Whenever I close my eyes I still see daylight, a bright, burning, magnificent light hidden in my eyelids. My thoughts are seemingly melting by the heat. It's 10000 degrees in my heart and I'm sure an antacid won’t fix it (i've tried). I don't really know what to do, what am I supposed to tell a psychiatrist? I can't afford to take off work either but I'm reaching my limit. The Sun is watching me and I don't know what to do.
