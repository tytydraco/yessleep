The foundations of Woodstock, California were laid by sweat and calloused hands and have stood for time immemorial, or so the oral histories have told. All was constructed by the river and gradually branched out into the pines. The town has roots in logging and mining, allowing a massive income and workforce. Once the mines ran dry, logging became central until we were able to send and receive large transports of better, and different, resources from the outside. People here are firm and sturdy—the type who finish the job they set out to do. That is, until the river ran dry.

The river cut through the valley as if it always knew where to go—it was purposeful, and it gave the town life. A natural gift the founder was smart enough to build a town beside. Perhaps he was deceived. Once the river dried, I was sent in to investigate why. Partially because I was familiar with mountainous forest terrain, mainly because nobody else had thought to go and check in the first place. For the settlers, the wilderness meant death and despair—somewhere where you were in the hands of God. For the modern man, after we had the tools and the means to navigate the wilderness, the logging companies closed off the land, and they aren’t interested in where rivers originate.

Getting access to restricted areas takes time and paperwork, and I don’t have the resources nor the energy. I work alone, and not by choice. Needless to say, startup private investigator companies aren’t like those noir films with a mysterious private eye and a sassy secretary. Mostly, it’s joke calls from bored locals and trying to figure out where someone’s cat wandered off to. Nevertheless, I found myself accepting an unofficial call from a government agent of some important position I couldn’t bother looking into. All the while, the thought of why they decided to send me, a lone PI, to investigate something this massive remains somewhat of a mystery. I have my guesses—political embarrassment being number one—but I’d rather take a job like this than having to find Mrs. Allesburg’s cat again. The pay he promised over the phone was more than anything I could have hoped for, especially for something pretty under-the-table like this.

Since I couldn’t get into the logging areas, I found myself rummaging through the library’s history books and local archives regarding the town and its founders. Below are some clippings I took from history books, newspapers I found in some archives, physical evidence from my personal investigative field reports I had to send to my employer, and other miscellaneous sources. Dates in the titles are either the release date of the work, or discovery date if the release date cannot be determined.

Clipping #1 - Woodstock: A Compiled History by Jared L. Millcreek - (Ch. 4, pg. 109):

After their long trek through the Sierras, the Woodstock family found themselves roughly in Mid to Northern California (accounts vary as far as the modern day cities of Roseville to Yreka). Tired and hungry, the miners and loggers set to work hunting. They, along with many other parties alongside them, hunted the local Tule Elk for the meat and tallow.

After some time, a gold panner discovered a small deposit on July 16th, 1837, about 11 years before the actual California gold rush. Word had reached out to the mining companies back east. They eventually broke ground in Woodstock on September 19th, 1838. The mines proved profitable, contributing to about 67% of the income (the logging company contributing for the larger part of the remaining 33%).

The frontman of the mining operations, Algernon Woodstock, established several mines across the Turpentine Mountains, and therefore founded the Woodstock Company. He was closely followed by another fairly successful venture under the Meryl Company who heard about the local success. The parallel operations continued until May 28th, 1845 when tragedy struck the Meryl Company. A flash flood had taken out several mines along the valley. An estimated 75 miners were killed in the flood. This tragedy caused the Meryl company’s investors to pull support. This, and the full liquidation of all of the Meryl Company’s assets, resulted in full dissolution. With the loss of their competitor, the Woodstock Company gained a monopoly on the mining industry and continued their operations with great success.

***

After finding that clipping in the library, I hastily pulled out my pocket knife and carefully cut the page from the book. Yes I know it was wrong, but sometimes I like to add a little thrill to my life. This would also prove crucial for whatever I come across next. Maybe I could find out more about this Woodstock Company. While they’re no longer around today due to what I can only assume would be modern day imports, their bunkhouses and facilities are still around. I'm sure they’re out rotting in the woods somewhere. Maybe some of them will have a squatter or two.

Another curious thought occurred to me in regards to the founding of the town. Wouldn’t the gold panner receive the rights to name the town of Woodstock, California? He’s the one who found the gold, why not credit him?

As for the gold panning practice itself, the gold was found fairly early compared to the historical rush we all learned about in school. I think Algernon may have gotten incredibly lucky, jumping on the mining train so fast.

As a final note, I’d like to extend a personal apology to the Woodstock Library on the corner of 4th St. and Sandra Blvd. Along with Mr. Jared L. Millcreek for running a knife through your book. I’ll also put the rest of my apologies for cutting up books here to save space.

Clipping #2 - The Great Shift by David Sainsbury - (Ch. 7, pg. 201)

Mining, while a successful venture, does eventually run dry. It is a non-replenishable resource after all, so it would be entirely logical for the Woodstock Company to shift their ventures into different territories. In the personal journal of Algernon Woodstock, he writes, “We’ve been in the industry for several years now. My boys are dedicated and hard working—perfectly capable, and willing, to follow my orders. Those are the kind of people I like. Those are the kind of people I hire. So how hard could it be to go from swinging a pickaxe in a cave and lugging around chunks of rock to swinging an axe in a forest and lugging around logs?”.

While logging companies were established, they didn’t reach the same level of grandeur the Woodstock Company had with mining, so competing wasn’t much of a challenge. For a titan of the labor industry, this wasn’t anything new. Even today, Algernon Woodstock is still admired for a daring shift not many people were willing to take. Further to his credit, his wife would sometimes mention that it would be a point of embarrassment when he would suddenly jump from his seat to go to his office and make a note while they had house guests. His was a mind of frequent and analytical thoughts.

The newly rebranded Woodstock Mining & Logging Corporation managed to gain access—either by government permission or buying up the competition with leftover mining money—to the whole of the Turpentine Mountains, and began operations on August 30th, 1860. The logging venture had proved incredibly successful, eventually causing Algernon to move a good majority of his workforce from the mines into the forests. This, coupled with the forming of the transcontinental railroad, created a perfect scenario for profits to skyrocket. With the newfound economic growth, Mayor Quinton T. Elbrook, whom Algernon had become very close friends with, requested a statue be put in place to “immortalize the man who has brought so much prosperity”. Algernon graciously accepted this gesture and would later remark “it was like looking in a mirror”.

As time passed, the Golden Spike was driven at Promontory Summit, Utah, officially completing the first transcontinental railroad. This allowed transports to run from coast to coast and more industry in the west. This brought newfound competition to the Woodstock Mining & a logging Corporation. Algernon Woodstock, in an attempt to better compete, downsized his operations. The mass layoffs and land loss resulted in a major drop in profits.

The Woodstock Mining & Logging Corporation continued operations until May 23rd, 1903 when frequent snowstorms had resulted in record breaking snowfall. The runoff caused landslides and flooding, destroying the grounds in which Algernon Woodstock’s operations occurred. This caused several men to be trapped in the mines and others injured from the disasters. Very costly rescue operations and insurance filings from injured individuals, paired with a public safety outcry, caused the mass conglomerate to crumble and file for bankruptcy. They officially went out of business on June 15th that same year. As for Algernon Woodstock, he would contract tuberculosis and die just three weeks later.

***

That confirmed my suspicions of imports contributing to shutting the business down. Honestly, these books are starting to drag, and the pile of the library books is stacking on my desk along with their overdue fees. With the current timeline of events, Algernon’s company lasted a whole 65 years.

As much as I hate it, perhaps it’s time to go and rummage around in those abandoned buildings and antique shops. I’ll have to get legal permission to do that. Even though I hate paperwork, it shouldn’t be too much of a hassle to convince local authorities that I was told by the government to dig around in the dirt. I don’t dare go into those old mines though. Unlike some people I come across, I happen to enjoy living, and getting crushed by a cave-in doesn’t exactly resonate with me.

Maybe I can put it off for the time being and continue looking through textual evidence instead of physical.

Archive #1 - FLASH FLOOD KILLS 75 for The Turpentine Teller newspaper - June 1st, 1845

Local tragedy strikes the Meryl Company as a flash flood kills 75 workers in Turpentine Central Mine. Local militia groups and smaller homesteads also affected, but there have been no reported deaths. The flash flood began upstream from the origin of Turpentine River and followed through Woodstock. Mayor Quinton T. Elbrook has called for a public mourning for the loss of the miners on the 5th of this month, along with an announcement:

“I’m deeply sorrowful for what has happened here today,” he states in a public address, “and I wish for the welfare of my people as much as any other respectable citizen does. I would like to commemorate the Meryl miners for their sacrifices and hard working efforts to bring prosperity to this land. We are a people united, and I feel it appropriate to observe a public mourning for those we have lost.”

The Woodstock Company has placed a temporary hold on operations. They are scheduled to resume as normal on the 13th of this month.

***

I believe this is the closest I’ve gotten to the river’s relation to the town. The Turpentine River, as far as I’ve seen in my time here, has always had a gentle flow and pleasant calm. I guess nature is sometimes subject to change. Even so, I still find myself wondering about the weather reports all those years ago. I’ll bet they’re hidden away in some almanac or other newspaper somewhere. Shouldn’t be too hard—just search for the dates; double check the media.

As I make this note, I find myself quite a ways away from Woodstock and into the Bancroft Library in Berkeley. I’ve had to enlist the help of the librarians to navigate the archives because I don’t know the first thing about this field of work.

***

Archive #2 - St. Peter’s Almanac - November 20th, 1844 (excerpt for specific day range - Table cannot be presented as such and will be conveyed via plaintext)

Header Row: Date Range | Astronomical Note | Weather Prognostic
Data Row 1: May 23-27 | Waning Crescent to New Moon | Fair and unusually cold for the season. Expect gentle, easterly winds.
Data Row 2: May 28-30 | Venus visible at dawn. New Moon. | Fair and cold morning with a possibility for light rain in the evening.

***

I was stunned. Did they get the dates wrong? They should have been in the thick of the runoff, but with these conditions, that wouldn’t have been the case. Sure, there would be runoff from spring temperatures, but not enough to cause a flash flood of this caliber. 

This bothered me so much that I reached out to an old friend who worked for a news station as a meteorologist. He agreed that, under these conditions, a flash flood would be impossible. I figured “Well, predictions can be wrong”, but after searching through more weather reports and other almanacs for the area, the data matches; all report an incredibly light rainfall and low temperatures. Then a thought came to mind about the historical records: were they wrong? Did the flood even happen? I quickly dismissed the thought due to the fact that the “Great Flood of 1845” is a very well known disaster in the area. My final thought eventually came to how no one ever noticed the discrepancy in the data. Was I the first to ever dive this deep?

With how much this town idolizes its founder, I’d have to turn to other research methods. Getting out on the field is something I typically try to avoid for aforementioned legal issues, but I’ve gone past the point of no return in that regard. Regardless, if I can find old documents or personal records, they would prove incredibly valuable if they provide some reason for the contradiction.

Field Report #1 - Woodstock Mining & Logging Boarding House - September 7th, 2025

—

General Observations

Exterior: Dilapidated and weather-beaten. Woodstock Mining & Logging Corporation branding faintly visible above the main entrance, suggesting a boarding house built later in the company’s operations. Constructed of wooden planks. The front door is entirely missing.

Interior: Similarly dilapidated. Cramped living conditions with beds triple bunked. The central table offers a place for eating. A hole in the roof has allowed the elements to further damage the interior.

—

Exhibits

Exhibit A: Miner’s pickaxe 

Location: inside a metal bucket in the corner of the room.

Notes: This pickaxe is of notable quality for the time period. Suggests that Algernon Woodstock was not hesitant to properly supply his employees.

Exhibit B: Mess kit

Location: Underneath bedding on the third bunk from the left, middle bed.

Note: Suggests that men were taking food out to work with them. Also suggests long hours in a work day.

Exhibit C: Personal Journal belonging to Olsen H. Lancaster

Location: atop the central table. 

Notes: This journal will be evaluated. Contents yet to be discerned due to intense weathering and poor cursive. Leather is of poor quality and binding has deteriorated. Handle with care.

***

Something tangible has finally shown up. That journal, if it contains anything valuable, would be probably the most important piece of evidence I’ve found so far.

Next comes the part that’s really going to be difficult— not connecting the historical dots, not noting the contradictions of decades old records, not trying to make sense of everything—no. The most difficult part would be trying to get the bureaucratic archive offices to deem my research important enough to look into. Just getting past the bumpers they put in place is a nightmare and a half. They’d have to prove its validity, find some reason as to why it’s worth keeping, and then start the whole transcription process.

I’ll be sitting around for a while, but that leaves me time to conduct other investigations of points of interest.

Field Report #2 - Turpentine Riverbed - September 9th, 2025

—

General Observations

Saturated earth resulting in uneven surfaces with low resistance to weight. Dead and rotting fish are common along the riverbed and former shoreline. Ground consists of mostly rock and silt deposits. Several pieces of trash can be found, ranging from soda cans to abandoned inflatable rafts.

Origin of the river is inaccessible due to private property, owned by local logging companies. 

With the absence of the water, some mine entrances are now accessible further upstream from Woodstock proper. These have yet to be investigated.

***

I know I wrote that the mine entrances have yet to be investigated, but I feel it necessary to repeat myself: I don’t want to die. If this case is big enough for the government to care about, they’ll send one of their high-tech drones or whatever they have in store.

Since I’m on the topic of the government, I feel like I should elaborate more on how I got started in the first place. For the first few minutes after I got the call, I thought it was another prank. I would write about who called me, but I don’t feel like being hunted down by government agents, so I’ll keep it off this record. After receiving a second confirmation call from a separate person in the same department, it actually registered in my brain that this was the real deal. I was told of the disaster—of the river drying up—and I couldn’t help but accept. It was incredible that I got this kind of chance. But now that I’ve gotten out in the field, saw how it affected everyone, and walked around in the dried up river bed, I can’t help but feel incredibly selfish and ignorant. I feel like I owe these people an apology. I can run all the justifications through my head—that the government hired me unofficially, that this can be my big break, that I can finally use the money to live comfortably—but none of them have really eased the feeling of guilt I had. Even so, I guess exploitation is a commonality for this area.

Transcription #1 - The Journal of Olsen H. Lancaster - October 5th, 2025 (Excerpt selected for relevant information. Full transcription has yet to be publicly disclosed.)

—

Entry #6 - May 26th, 1845: Whispers are going around about Mr. Woodstock. They say he’s going to try and buy out the Meryl Company. I’m not particular to the idea myself, having been around the Meryl boys. They all seem like they spend more time working their chew than swinging their pickaxes. If I could get a hold of Mr. Woodstock’s ear, I’d try to advise him against it. I don’t know if Mr. Meryl’s boys have had as much luck as we have, but if they did, Mr. Woodstock’s got to figure out how he wants to handle the competition. All the upper brass who come down to us in the field have been saying he seemed fidgety. They can’t seem to put a finger on why though.

As for the mines—those holes of sweaty rock—they’ve been treasure troves. The only setback we’ve really come across has been some pockets of water, but that’s nothing we can’t handle. What’s a little cave water? The worst thing about them is that they don’t just bubble out of the ground and make a little puddle—they spray and get everywhere. Whenever we encounter one, we have to plug them back up as fast as we possibly can to prevent the mines from flooding. But hey, it’s not like we’ve got a reliable source of water above ground. There’s nothing up there. Nothing to drink, nothing to fish in, and nothing to wash in. We’ve been having to collect rainwater—or the cave water if it’s been dry—and purify it. But, on the other hand, it’s better than having a massive river run through the valley and wipe us all out. Those mines are incredibly difficult to get out of, and I can’t imagine trying to clamber your way out on slick rock—it just wouldn’t be possible

—

Entry #8 - May 28th, 1845: It seems my worst fears had come true, but I was lucky enough that they didn’t happen to me. There’s been a pause on operations, rightfully so. After learning about the Meryl miners, I don’t think I want to touch my helmet for a while. Hell, if there’s a chance that we get another flood, I might just return to my family back east. As much as I want to settle out here, these events may be God trying to tell me otherwise in some weird way.

***

Algernon Woodstock and fidgety did not seem like two things that should have gone together. Thinking back to the history books, he didn’t seem like the type. Jumpy, maybe by his wife’s account. She would have had a better knowledge of that than anyone, but the town hasn’t much in the way of personal records in regards to her, nor Algernon for that matter.

Something else was bothering me about Mr. Lacanster’s journal: he said there was no water above ground. Odd. Strange. Utterly ridiculous. Entirely case-changing. How could there be no water? We’re in the perfect area for runoff to collect, and during that time of year it should have been flowing at full capacity. But then again, the river today has dried up. Does it have something to do with those water pockets? I could almost guarantee it. Which also means, as much as I despise it, I’d have to go looking underground. Not through those old mines, thank God, but I’d have to get access into the logging company’s land to see if there’s a deep enough point that I can access. That wouldn’t have been possible earlier in the investigation, but with this much precedence, my entry would have to be made possible. I’ll see if I can get a hold of whoever’s running the operations out here and hopefully they’ll be willing to listen to a lone PI tell an epic about things that were never supposed to exist.

With this newfound information, and the signing of several liability waivers, I managed to gain access to the logging land, along with the Woodstock homestead. Once I rid myself of this migraine I’ve got, I’ll have to go in and see what I can find.

Field Report #3 - Turpentine River Source - October 20th, 2025

General Observations: No visible flowing water. The dirt of the former riverbed is dry and dusty. A mine entrance was found blocked by several boulders. They were subsequently removed for further exploration. Several wooden support beams were found along the passageways.  After traveling to an estimated 1,000 ft.  depth, a breach created via explosives created in the bedrock reveals an interconnected network of vast and empty caves. The walls are smooth, suggesting water erosion. The floor is composed of compacted sand and silt with distinguishable ridges, suggesting immense pressure and flow. The dome of the cave consists of iron rich mineral deposits and fragile stalactites, some of which appear to be broken. Each detail, as pointed out by the caving team, suggests that the cave was a former pressurized aquifer.

Additional Notes: Samples were collected by the caving team for further testing. Samples consist of:
- Silt taken from the cave floor
- Stalactite remnant from the cave ceiling
- Rock chipping removed from the cave wall

***

“What in the ever-living-hell is in that mine?” I remember saying aloud. This was literally and figuratively ground-breaking (if you’ll pardon the somewhat intentional pun). I remember following the riverbed up to the mine entrance and doing a double take. It was a normal mine, just like any other, but the entrance was blocked by boulders. One of the managers for the logging company was with me at the time because they didn’t like the idea of some guy walking around unsupervised. I turned to him and asked if they knew this was there. He replied with: “Yep. We didn’t really think to question it, given the local history and all.” He had also mentioned that he was given strict instruction to not let anyone near them due to the dangers of old mines like that. The idea of not questioning a mine with water coming out of it was something that seriously boggled me, but I managed somehow to justify it by looking at the landscape. The mine entrance was in somewhat of a dip, which lended it the plausible deniability that it was a good place for runoff to collect—the water may have submerged the entrance. Nevertheless, it had to be checked.

Also, when I first came to the scene and saw the boulders in the way, I couldn’t quite determine if it was blocked deliberately or accidentally, but after further inspection of the surrounding land, it seemed intentional. Several depressions in the ground that were incongruent with the landscape showed that the boulders were moved. These depressions were overgrown with wild foliage, but their presence was still incriminating. Why would they need to block an entrance like that?

This was also the first time I had ever worked with a team. I hadn’t the faintest idea about how to lead a spelunking expedition, but after some strong deliberation (or rather, begging) with my employer, he finally caved and reached out to a team. There was no way I would have gone in alone, much less into an unexplored cave.

Once we got the boulders out of the way, I turned on my headlamp and took a deep gulp of air. Caves were my worst nightmare. I apologize to any avid and passionate spelunkers, but something must be wrong with their brains; tight spaces and potential cave-ins are not exactly my cup of tea. Luckily for me, this mine didn’t have any of those—the caves were large enough for me to spread my arms out.

Ignoring the frequent structural support beams we constantly encountered, the most damning piece of evidence was the obvious blast hole into the side of the aquifer. This was evident even to me, someone with no geological or caving experience. The team I was with could even delineate the exact spot the dynamite would have been placed.

After we entered through the hole, we found the scene described in the field report. All of that information was taken from the team’s observations. I would never have been able to pick up on anything like that. I watched, stunned by the musty air and echoing chatter while the spelunkers were able to pinpoint every single piece of evidence that suggested that there was a pressurized aquifer here. And here is where I emphasize the “was”—this was exactly why the river had dried up.

Now that I knew it was deliberately tapped, I had to find concrete evidence for a motive. I had all the pieces, I just needed the glue to stick them together.

Field Report #4 - Woodstock Family Estate - October 21st, 2025

—

General Observations

Exterior: The wooden walls show intense weathering. Sections of the roof have collapsed as well as sections of the exterior walls. Several windows have shattered. Entry proved difficult due to rusted door hinges.

Interior: Main entryway is in incredibly poor condition. Stairs directly in front of the entrance lead to the top floor of the house. Hallways beside the stairs lead to a living room and kitchen. Upstairs, a hallway contains three entrances into bedrooms, and one into a washroom. The assumed master bedroom contains a central bed with a bedside locker for personal belongings. An ornate mirror on the west wall is hung above a small table with a drawer. Loose boards in the west side of the bed reveal a small hole where a locked box was discovered.

—

Exhibits

Exhibit A: Ruby encrusted silver brooch

Location: Inside a drawer in the table underneath the mirror in master bedroom

Notes: An etching in the silver on the back of the brooch reads “Daina”

Exhibit B: Trust documents

Location: inside bedside locker

Notes: While body text of the documents have been completely damaged by intense weathering, some words of the document’s title contain the name of the Woodstock Company before their pivot to logging. Transcription of these documents have been deemed impossible.

Exhibit C: Slip of paper with a note written on it

Location: Inside locked box hidden behind the wall

Notes: the lock on the box has rusted, allowing it to be opened on scene. The note is signed “Algernon Woodstock”.

***

I felt like a toddler as I sat on the dusty floor, absolutely dumbfounded. The paper was in better condition than anything I’ve found as of yet. The words were plain as day. My stomach dropped as I read further and further. My entire case was completed by one piece of paper. How lucky, or unlucky could I possibly be? This information earned me a paycheck with an impressive number, and a thousand ton burden on my shoulders. As of now, the only people that know how the story ends are me, my employer, and the people we sent to ensure the legitimacy of the note; that it was actually Algernon who wrote it.

As to how this would be released to the public: it wouldn’t. At least, not as plainly as a headline on the news station. Something like this has to be released quietly and slowly to prevent a public outcry. People are upset enough as is from the river drying up—if they found this, they would riot.

I will never speak of what is on that paper to anyone. I will take that knowledge to my grave.

Transcription #2 - The Personal Confession of Algernon Woodstock - October 25th, 2025

Tuberculosis is one son-of-a-bitch. The worst thing besides the constant coughing and pain in your lungs is the fact that it makes you think.

I have spent years perfecting my craft, and making sure the competition couldn’t. But that didn’t stop me from coming across several problems along the way. I was sure that damned aquifer would have been the death of me, and as I lay dying now, I still think it is. We ran into it so many times I was able to map its entire size. Those fools I hired thought about just draining the water out the side of the mountain, but I had a better idea.

The Meryl Company was a thorn in my side for years. Fredrick Meryl, their founder, was even more so. You can’t trust tycoons like him. He knew about that gold panner in these mountains, and he followed me out here. He copied nearly every operation I did. I would venture a guess and say that some of my men were double crossing me for better pay—telling him where all the gold is. Those ungrateful bastards. Little did they know that by their actions, they allowed the Meryl Company to buy land that we were going to mine. They would have surpassed us if they were left unchecked. Luckily, they weren’t.

I knew how and where to access that aquifer, and by how it sprayed out of the ground in the mines, I knew that I could use it. Infinite water, right in the palm of my hand. I got a very select few of my men to create a mine entrance, just like any other, high in the valley so it would flow downhill. Even though it looked like any other gold mine, we mined for something much better— we mined for success. They found an access point and readied the dynamite, but I gave explicit instructions for them to wait for rain so that the resulting flood wouldn’t be linked back to us. Once it did rain and they blasted that hole open, the water came spilling out, flooding the valley, and the Meryl mines. We had done it.

I don’t write this out of guilt, but in hopes that someone would know how this fruitful land was accomplished and how those leeches were draining it. I will be thanked. I will be revered.

Algernon Woodstock—I hope you’re burning in hell.
