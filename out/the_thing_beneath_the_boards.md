I moved into the old house at twilight. the windows were cracked, curtains hung lifeless, and the floorboards sighed under each step. i told myself it was just age settling. i told myself it was nothing more than echoes from a house too heavy with years. i unpacked my things in silence, the air thick with dust motes drifting in the pale light. i lay on the creaking mattress and stared at the ceiling, waiting for sleep to find me.

the first night came and went without incident. but on the second night, i heard scratching beneath the floor, like someone tapping a slow morse code. i froze, my breath caught in my throat, and i listened. the sound moved beneath my feet, dragging closer, like long fingernails pulling against wood. i lay flat on my back, my heart hammering. i dared not move. the sound halted, then resumed with a softer rhythm, as if teasing me awake.

i tried to ignore the mornings that came with bruises on my arms, like claw marks. but each bruise faded by daylight, and reappeared new each dawn. i told my friends it was restless sleep or night terrors, but alone in the house, i could still feel the thing watching me, waiting beneath the boards. the nights stretched on, and sleep slipped further away. i wandered the rooms like a ghost, seeking comfort that never came.

on the fourth night, the tapping came with voices. no words—just whispers, low and longing. i pressed my ear to the floorboard in the living room. i felt warmth creeping through the boards, like a breath. i felt the boards give under my weight—a hollow space, alive and pulsing. i tried to pry a plank free, but my fingers slipped on the warped wood. the voices stilled, leaving only a quiet heavier than darkness.

i slept in the attic next, wrapped in blankets like armor. but the house hunted me there too. the attic floorboards shifted beneath my bed. the whispers called my name, soft and pleading like a child—but hollow, like an empty grave. i tried to shout back, but my voice was lost in the rafters. the next morning, i found muddy footprints on the attic floor, leading back to the hatch. no footprints on the way out.

i packed my bags once more and tried to leave, but every exit door slid shut, as if glued by invisible hands. the windows refused to open, tight frames sealed with rot and years of neglect. i pounded on the glass. my screams were swallowed by silent walls, and the thing watched me from beneath the boards, as i ran room to room in circles, my heart ripped by fear.

on the sixth night, i heard the thing above me, walking in the hallway. its footsteps soft, deliberate, and impossible. there was no hallway above me—only attic rafters. i climbed out of bed, flashlight shaking in my hand. the beam caught a figure at the end of the corridor. tall. too thin. limbs bent at odd angles. its head tilted like a curious bird. it raised a hand, tapped three times on the floor, then vanished.

i followed the sound of dragging claws down the stairs into the basement. the door clicked shut behind me, plunging me into darkness. i fumbled for my phone. my light revealed walls scratched with names i did not recognize. each scrawl shaky, desperate—a confession carved in panic. i felt breath on my neck. i spun around. no one was there. but the tapping returned from below. the final floorboard at the back of the room seemed to throb with life.

i knelt and placed my hand on the board. the wood pulsed warm, like a heartbeat. the thing whispered, please. and i heard my own voice echo back—pleading, empty, and broken. i pried the board loose, my fingers cut by splinters. inside the narrow space, i saw pale skin and a single eye watching me, wide and unblinking. my heart stuttered. i leaned closer, and the thing smiled with too many teeth.

it crawled out on hands that bent the wrong way, its body wet with rot. it reached for me with a grin that split its face. i screamed and backed into a corner. my flashlight fell and flickered. i saw its mouth open—wider than a door. i ran past it, up the stairs. the boards beneath my feet cracked and groaned. i slammed the door behind me and raced outside, into the cold night air.

now i sit in a diner, miles from that place. rain drips from a dark sky. i clutch a coffee cup, warm in my hands, but nothing feels warm enough. i left everything behind. my car radio plays songs that drown the silence, but i still hear tapping every time the wind shifts. i wonder if it followed me. or if every floor beneath every home hides a creature waiting for someone to fall asleep. waiting to tap them awake. and take them home forever.
