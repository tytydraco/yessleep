Hi everyone. I need help. A couple hours ago I came home from a full day at work. After watching tv for an hour or 2 I went to bed. 

On my nightstand, I found an envelope. Not just an ordinary envelope. A black envelope with a white skull on it, which already terrified me. I live alone, and I am the only one that has the keys for this house. All windows and doors were fully locked and there were no signs of burglary, so this cannot be some sick prank. Also, the envelope certainly wasn’t mine. I’ve written down the letter in full right beneath here. Please read it, I am horrified. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hello there. Do you remember all those times that you were scared when trying to fall asleep? Scared that something might crawl through your window in the middle of the night, or that you would suddenly hear a knock on your door which isn’t coming from your parents? Or maybe you were scared that that thing under your bed might creep out, not realizing that that thing under your bed wouldn't bother to show itself, it would rather just grab your ankles and pull you under the bed so it can eat you alive. 

Your parents always said that you would be fine and that there was nothing to worry about. That was a lie. They forgot about me. I’m that car you didn’t see, the virus that almost killed you, even though you didn’t notice a thing. I’m that lightning bolt which almost took your plane down, that heart attack you narrowly escaped, that shadow in the corner of your room. Still, naive as you are, you believed your parents and so you tried to relax and eventually you started a botherless sleep, every time again. 

Now you probably think that I’m kidding, because you're old enough to know that there is nothing under your bed, and that there will be no-one at your bedroom door tonight. That’s true, both things are not the case. I have much better and scarierer ways to enter your room. I’ve used a lot of different methods in the past years. I’ve been there hundreds of times. To watch you sleep, without you knowing that I was standing right there, at your sight. Watching your beautiful face when you’re fast asleep. 

I’ve been chasing you. I’ve been so close plenty of times, without you noticing a single thing. Remember those moments when you were almost run over by a car? Those times when you frightenedly woke up, without knowing what happened? That was me, experimenting with my capabilities. Those were the moments I almost got you. I didn’t want you dead then, I was just having fun. A year ago my feelings slowly started to shift. I decided that your time has come.

I have been living up to this night for a long time. That’s why I sneaked up so many times into your room, to watch the person who’s life I’m going to end someday.

You might think this is all a yoke. You can’t be further from the truth. I can promise you, there will be no tomorrow. Not for you. You’ve been on this earth for too damn long. 

So, what am I?

Call me your Doom. I’ve been chasing and playing with you for years on end. That time is over. Too often have I let you slip through my fingers. Not tonight, tonight I am coming for you, and this time I will get you.

I found this letter an hour ago. Please, please help me. I am too scared to leave the house. I don’t know what to do. A minute ago a faint ticking sound started on one of the windows downstairs. I’m freaking out. I think I'm going to die tonight…
