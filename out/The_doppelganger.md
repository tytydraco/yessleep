A weeks ago the most bizzare thing happened with me. I wanted to share it here to spread information about this. Because this might happen to you too. Stay safe, be careful.


It was a chilly day mid September, the sky as dark as an abyss. I was doing my work at the living room with a strong cup of coffee not realising that it was already 1 am. To my surprise the doorbell rang. I stared at my rusty brown door as the unfamiliar sound echoed through my head. I lived alone and never had any visitor, neither did I have many friends so this surprised me greatly.

I hesitantly opened the door to a frightened young lady who looked the same age as me. She had a big dark birthmark on her neck, it looked interesting. Her skin as pale as a ghost, her eyes wide open almost as if she had seen a ghost. "Hey I'm Sam, I live next door 5A and I really need your help can I come in for a minute?" She asked shyly. She was beautiful, long blonde hair and big bug eyes. I invited her in as she sat at the table. "Would you like a cup of coffee?" I asked, "Uhh I would like that" she replied. 

"So what's bothering you?, Why do you look so scared?" I asked.

"You won't believe me but I have a, a doppelganger. She stares at me from outside my window every night. Her eyes wide open. She has this weird sinister smile that never fades, she doesn't even blink. 
Everytime I run after her she disappears." Sam starts  crying.

"Hey I believe you, I saw it on the local news too, doppelgangers are spreading" I replied trying to sound calm. 

The doorbell rings again. Sam covers her scream with her mouth. I check through the keyhole, "It's her Sam, your doppelganger" I whisper.

"WE MUST HIDE OH NO CMON, DO YOU HAVE A CLOSET" she screams softly. More and more tears rush out.  Sam and I rush to my room as we console eachother. "Sam, there it is at the living room, it broke in, oh my god OH NO " I tell her. It ran towards us in a strange manner. It felt almost unreal. 

We locked the bedroom and made it to the closet on time. " Come out please" it echoes following after loud harsh bangs. The door looked as if it was about to break.

"So the police that day, it came cause of the doppelganger, right? You said u live in flat 5A. I heard from other neighbours."
 "Uhh" she hesitated still not recovered from the fear. "Yes, yes she replied" she replied still under shock. 

We wait inside the closet for hours, I felt a connection to her, it was the first time after a while that I almost had a friend. 
" It has left we can exit the closet" I tell her. We make our way to the living and I turn on the local news channel, us both still constantly checking the windows for the creature. "Hey I'll use the washroom and be back" she said, "Before I pee my pants from fear you know?".

I watch the news not remembering I didn't tell her where the washroom was, she'll find her way there, I thought. 
I stared at the news as my eyes widened, it can't be it can't be no no no. My mind froze. My hands trembled. I could barely breathe. 
"Lookout for doppelganger, has a big black mark on neck. " says the news lady. 
I remember Sam's birthmark, I felt so betrayed. She was the doppelganger all along. 

"Uhh Sam are you back?" I say softly slowly turning around. She's right behind me inches apart, with an unusual undying smile, her eyes wide open. From behind her back she pulls out a big knife. A sinister laugh comes out. I scream.

I RUN, she stands there laughing. 

I escape from the window, that actual Sam  had broken, through which she entered inside the house. I try running as far as I can, I hear her footsteps from behind as she chases me. She's Inches away from me. Goosebumps appear and my legs get sore from running. I lose sight of her. I sigh in relief.

"It's silly to try running isn't it dear?" She pops up infront of me, like a real life glitch. 
She. Never. Blinks. 
Another sinister laugh. She brings the knife closer to me as she falls to the ground. She's still smiling as she lays on the ground unable to move. A police man from behind had just shot her. 

I run towards the policeman. "Sam, your neighbour, told me you might be in trouble so I came here with my team" he says. "Are you alright mister" He asks. "Yeah" I reply. "Thank you so much, for saving me." 
Soon afterwards I make my way home.

I still can't believe I survived, it was the most frightening experience of my life. The news about doppelganger has strangly been deleted from every platform so you won't be able to find it.  I want you to be aware and careful. Don't make the same mistake as me. Doppelgangers are everywhere. Always be on the lookout.
