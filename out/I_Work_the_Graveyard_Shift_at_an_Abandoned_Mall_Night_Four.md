**July 4th: "The Last Night"**

I wake up with a start. My hands are cold. My breath is shallow. My heart pounds against my ribs like I’ve just been running. I don’t remember falling asleep. I don’t remember coming here. But I’m already at the security desk. My uniform is on, neatly buttoned, like I’ve been on shift for hours. The monitors cast their familiar glow, flickering softly, showing the same empty corridors I’ve walked a hundred times before.

Except…

My security log is open in front of me, pages filled with my own handwriting. Entries I don’t remember writing. I flip through them, my fingers trembling. The dates stretch back farther than they should: weeks, months… maybe years. Then I see the last entry. The ink is fresh.

"Night Four begins now."

A shudder rolls through me. I push back from the desk, trying to stand, trying to shake off the fog in my head… and for a split second, I feel it. I’m in two places at once. I snap my head toward the monitors. One of the cameras shows the west hallway. I’m standing there. Patrolling. But I’m still here. Sitting at the desk. I blink, my breath catching in my throat.

The \*figure on the monitor… me\* turns. Slowly, deliberately... and looks straight at the camera.

Straight at me.

A burst of static explodes from the PA system. My own voice echoes through the speaker; flat, distant, like a recording played a thousand times over.

"Night Four begins now."

I grip the edge of the desk, my pulse hammering in my ears. This isn’t real. It can’t be real. Then the monitors flicker. A new camera feed. A hallway. Dimly lit. At the far end, someone stands just out of focus. They don’t move. They don’t breathe. But they’re watching. The screen glitches. The figure is closer.

Another glitch… closer still.

I swallow hard, my body frozen in place. Then, the screen goes black. The air shifts around me, thick and alive.

I’m not alone.

\*\*\*\*

I step out into the hallway, and I immediately know something is wrong. The mall is decaying. The storefronts are warped, their glass smeared with something greasy and opaque. The neon signs flicker; not just on and off, but between decades. One second, they’re brand new, glowing bright, advertising sales long since passed. The next, they’re shattered, rusted, dangling from wires like severed tendons.

Above me, something drips from the ceiling. A slow, steady patter against the tile. At first, I think it’s just water, just another leak from this dying building…

But when I step closer, I see it.

The liquid is thick.

Dark.

It clings to the ceiling beams like oil, sluggish and alive.

I choke down the urge to gag. The air is different too: heavier, thicker. The usual mall scent of stale popcorn and disinfectant is gone. In its place is something rotten, something that reminds me of old meat left out in the heat.

Then… a flicker.

The lights overhead buzz and shudder, and for a moment, I think they’re about to cut out completely. But no… They turn on.

One by one, down the corridor. A path of light, stretching forward. Leading me deeper in. A cold sweat creeps down my back. The mall isn’t just falling apart. It’s changing. I round a corner, and I freeze. Ahead, near the far end of the hall, someone is there.

A security guard.

Relief surges in my chest, irrational and desperate. I almost call out, but something stops me. He’s standing too still. I take a step closer, my breath shallow.

"Hey," I say. My voice is hoarse. "Hey, man, what’s…"

The figure moves. Not like a person. Not naturally. His limbs jerk, slightly out of sync, like a puppet on invisible strings. His head tilts… too sharply, like his neck is made of brittle plastic. But he doesn’t turn toward me.

He just keeps walking.

I take another step back, pulse hammering. My fingers tingle, cold and numb, like I’ve been outside in the dead of winter without gloves. I look down at my hands. And for the first time, I realize…

They don’t feel like mine anymore.

\*\*\*\*

I don’t know how long I’ve been walking. The halls stretch on forever, shifting under my feet like a living thing. I turn left where I swear there should be a dead end. I step through a doorway and somehow end up deeper inside than before.

And the mall is watching.

The PA system crackles overhead, the speakers distorted with static and something else: voices. They come in faint at first, like old radio transmissions struggling to break through the interference. But then… I recognize them.

Security guards. Past workers, leaving messages for each other.

"... back entrance doors still jammed, I’ll take a look tomorrow..."

"... lost another delivery guy. Nobody saw him leave..."

Then, beneath it all, a whisper. Soft. Urgent.

“If you’re hearing this, you’ve been here too long.”

I stop breathing. My skin crawls. Ahead, mannequins stand in storefront windows. I keep my eyes forward, telling myself they’re just plastic, just lifeless props for a store that doesn’t even exist anymore. But as I pass…

They breathe.

I hear the soft inhale, the almost imperceptible sigh of lungs expanding and contracting. I see the slow flutter of eyelids, the shift of shoulders, the minute twitch of fingers. I tell myself to keep moving. Keep walking. But then…

I see a face.

One of the mannequins, standing among the rest, has my face. I stumble back, heart slamming against my ribs. It doesn’t move, but I know it’s alive. I rush past, refusing to look again. At the next corridor, a bulletin board is mounted to the wall. The papers are yellowed, curling at the edges. A photo is pinned in the center.

It’s an old group picture: mall employees, standing in front of the fountain. The grand opening, 1982. I scan the faces, half-expecting to see someone I recognize, some proof that all of this isn’t real. And then…

I see him.

A man in the back row. Same eyes. Same jawline. Same slouched posture. He looks exactly like me. I feel sick. I turn away, and for a second, I catch my reflection in the glass of an old vending machine. My stomach knots.

It’s smiling.

I’m not. But it is.

I take a step closer, but my reflection stays put, its grin widening, teeth gleaming too sharp in the dim light. I spin around, checking the other windows. In one, my reflection watches me, face blank, eyes hollow. In another, it mouths something. I can’t hear it. But I know it’s speaking. And it looks like a warning. Then…

A flicker.

The mall directory screen beside me changes. The old, half-burned map vanishes, replaced by a single message:

“Food Court - Below.”

I don’t know why, but my gut twists. There is no “below.” There was never a lower level. But ahead, where there was only wall before: A new pathway has appeared. Leading downward. I don’t want to go, but my legs start moving anyway.

\*\*\*\*

The air is thick, humid. Each step down the hidden staircase feels heavier, the dim yellow lights above me flickering like dying embers. The food court shouldn’t be here.

It wasn’t here.

But as I reach the bottom, I see rows of tables. The glow of neon signs. The low, distorted hum of voices, chewing, slurping, swallowing. Every table is occupied. And every single person eating…

Is me.

Some are younger, barely past their teenage years, nervously hunched over plastic trays. Others are older, their faces lined with exhaustion, blank stares locked onto half-eaten meals. And some…

Some shouldn’t be alive.

Their skin is rotting. Gray, sagging flesh hangs loosely from their bones. Teeth chatter as they chew, but they never swallow. Some don’t even have lips anymore, just blackened gums and empty eyes. I stagger back. The stench of stale food and decay hits me like a wall. The chewing stops. They all look up. My stomach twists. A voice slithers through the air, low and wet, as if whispered through water.

“Join us.”

My breath hitches. My limbs feel heavy. I glance at their trays. The food is moving.

The burgers pulse, their surfaces breathing. The noodles writhe like worms. The meat glistens too red, too raw, too alive. And then…

My stomach growls.

I grip the edge of a table, my vision swimming. When was the last time I ate? My hands tremble. How long have I been here? Then…

A tray slides across the table in front of me. It’s mine. Half-eaten. The food is still warm. Next to the tray sits a plastic name tag.

My name.

I’ve been here before.

\*\*\*\*

I run. I don’t know where I’m going. It doesn’t matter. My footsteps hammer against the tile, echoing too loud in the cavernous space. My breath comes in ragged gasps. The mall twists around me, corridors bending, stretching. The storefronts glitch between decades: 1982, 1996, 2008, now. I pass a toy store where shelves overflow with boxed action figures, ones I had as a kid, still sealed, pristine. I pass a record shop where a clerk in bell-bottoms hums along to a song I don’t recognize. I pass a jewelry store where mannequins wear engagement rings that were never bought, but one of them matches the one I almost gave her.

No. No, no, no.

I force myself forward, turning down another hall… I’m back at the food court.

No.

The PA system hisses to life. My voice, my own voice. whispers through the speakers.

"You can’t leave. You never left."

I grip my head, shaking. This isn’t real. It can’t be. My security log. I fumble it open, pages crinkling beneath my trembling fingers. The entries… there are too many. Decades of them. The ink fades and changes, shifting from modern ballpoint to the scratchy drag of fountain pens. The oldest pages are yellowed, the dates barely legible. But the handwriting…

It’s mine.

Over and over.

Over years.

Over lifetimes.

I look up. There’s a mirror ahead. A dusty, smudged department store mirror. I don’t want to see it, but I step forward anyway. I look. And the face staring back… It’s not me. Not the way I remember. My hair is thinner. My eyes are dull, sunken. Tired. The lines on my face are deep, too deep. I lift a shaking hand to my cheek… and the reflection doesn’t follow. It just stands there. Waiting. Then…

A shadow rises behind me. Tall. Familiar. I see it in the glass, looming over my shoulder.

My reflection.

It steps forward. Slowly. Deliberately. And then…

It places a cold, steady hand on my shoulder.

\*\*\*\*

I collapse. My legs give out beneath me, and I sink to the floor. The air is thick, suffocating, pressing in like a weighted blanket. The voices soften, losing their malice. They coo. They soothe.

*"You belong here."*

*"It’s easier this way."*

My breath slows. The fear is slipping away. Or maybe I am. My other self kneels beside me. It doesn’t speak. It just smiles: a knowing, patient smile, like it’s been waiting for me to understand.

Something in my chest loosens. My mind fogs, thoughts unraveling like frayed thread. What was I afraid of again? This is what happens. This is how it always ends. I feel it, like a fracture in my being. I am splitting. No… multiplying. Something steps forward from the shadows.

Then another.

And another.

I look up. The mannequins are closer now. Their blank faces aren’t blank anymore. They are me.

They always were.
