“Get the fuck out of my house with this ‘ old country’ shit Sylvia, I’m serious. “ I hear my dad say from the kitchen downstairs. 

“I give children and idiots three warnings. That’s your first. “ It takes me a second to recognize my aunt’s voice. I’ve only met her a handful of times, and it’s nearly 2am. 

“Syl, he’s right, this is crazy. I’m Roma, I’m proud, but your part of the family, and mine are two separate things. “ My mom interjects. Her voice is calm and level. 

I woke up about half way through whatever is going on, and I’m fuzzy on the details, but everyone involved is three kinds of pissed. 

“So you say, but just because you ignore the other side, doesn’t mean the other side ignores you. “ Aunt Syl replies, I could never quite place her accent, but it makes her statement all the more sinister. 

“Might as well  make that the family motto. 

Syl, there are a couple dozen other kids Nikolas’ age in the family. Half of which are already hip deep in whatever is going on nowadays, you don’t need him. “ Mom isn’t pleading, but I can hear she’s worried. 

“Why are we trying to reason with your crazy aunt? Time to go Syl. “ My dad isn’t worried, he’s angry. 

“That’s two. “ Aunt Sylvia replies. 

I hear a chair squeak then fall to the floor. 

“That’s three. “ Sylvia says, her voice is cold, and I swear I could almost hear an echo. 

I can hear my dad start to quietly cough, he sounds like he’s trying to talk but can’t. My heart starts to race, I don’t understand what’s going on, but I know it’s bad. 

“Syl! Jesus Christ, that’s my husband. “ Mom sounds more offended than scared now. I wish I could say the same. 

I stand next to my cracked door, fear beginning to take hold. 

I can hear my dad start to take long wheezing breaths, I have no idea if this is a good or bad thing. 

“Happy? 

Now that any hope of doing this quietly is over, Nikolas and I have a long drive ahead of us. He’s 16, he has a license, yes? “ I hear Sylvia say, sudden footsteps walking up the stairs. 

“No, he’s not interested in driving. You  can’t take him Syl. “ my mom sounds frantic, Sylvia’s steps are measured and heavy. 

“Not interested?  You sure we are related? You raise soft children. “ Sylvia ends this with a dismissive laugh. 

The few minutes that followed were kind of a blur, with my mom trying to convince me that I was just going to visit family, as if I didn’t just hear everything. 

It's a couple hours into a long drive in a small car when my brain finally catches up to the fact that I’m awake, and going 30 miles an hour over the speed limit. 

Aunt Syl sits in the driver’s seat, she’s 40 something, olive skinned with pitch-colored hair. Her style, it’s, something. 

Her outfit was the middle of a Venn diagram of hippie, punk rock and carpenter. Bracelets, flannel, paisley, and enough piercings I lost count. 

“Any chance of putting both hands on the wheel? “ I say, I’m mad, but I don’t even really know why. 

She holds up her left arm, and I’m shocked. It’s an ancient looking blued steel prosthetic. She flexes, the clawed, almost mitten-like hand. 

“Go through too many steering wheels that way. “ She says with a smirk. 

“What’s going on? “  I ask, after an agonizing fifteen minutes of silence. 

“You’re a big boy, so if you want the truth, I’ll give it to you. There’s a job that needs to be done, a dangerous job. And I want you to do it. 

Now, I want you, not because you’re strong, or smart, or special. We have many strong, smart, special boys. 

You, I want, because you’re unknown, and, little one, disposable. “ Sylvia lets this comment hang like rotten fruit. 

The next hour goes in silence, at no point do I even entertain the notion this is some kind of joke. Something about this woman’s energy, about the way she carries herself, it scares the shit out of me. 

We board a plane, somehow she had all of my travel documents. Even stranger is that we get escorted past the security checkpoints, into first class. 

The next words I say to Sylvia are, “You have to put that out! “ as she lights up a short, yellow, hand-rolled cigarette. 

She grins, taking a long drag, it smells horrible,  the cheapest roughest tobacco odor I’ve encountered. 

She relaxes, a cloud of thick,  grey smoke forming. 

I’m stunned, not a single person says anything. At first I think maybe she’s some kind of, I don’t know, mobster or something. 

But that isn’t quite right. No one is looking at her in fear, no one is telling anyone else not to say anything. It’s like no one notices what she’s doing. 

“How does she do this? The little boy wonders. 

I don’t come offering you a thankless task Nik. I come with an opportunity. “ Sylvia says before crushing the cigarette on the arm of a chair and tossing it into the isle. 

I had questions, and between the fear and the confusion I asked every one of them. 

The only response she gave me was, “You’ll see when we get there. “. 

She was right.

The flight lands, and after an hour or so of driving the world’s oldest pickup through the English countryside, we wind up at an old farm house, in the middle of nowhere outside of Hammersmith. 

The sign outside says “ Gritt Auctions” the letters are old, bronze and tarnished, the grounds are littered with car parts, statues, and errata of every type. 

Dozens, maybe even a hundred people mill about each stopping for a moment to give a suspicious look at the interloper in their midst. 

Sylvia seems amused at my nervousness. I try and give the rough looking folks around me as much space as I can. 

“They’re family, mostly, by blood or marriage, with a handful of lost souls and hangers on. “ She explains. 

I probably should have guessed, seeing my mom’s family name on the sign, but my brain is basically nothing more than fear, anxiety and jet lag at this point. 

“When do I get to know what’s going on? “ I say, waving at a cousin of some form and receive a uniquely English rude gesture in return. 

My ear is ringing, and I stumble , the left side of my face burning. I’d say Syl slapped me, but it was more of a polite punch. 

“Don’t whine. 
You’ve been stolen from your mother, treated like a dog, and judging by Robert’s attitude, rejected by your family. 

I don’t want to hear whining, you angry, soft boy? “ Sylvia stops and turns toward me. I notice the people around us stop their tasks, interested in our conversation. 

“No… “ I begin, not wanting to piss  her off. 

I don’t even see the next slap, but it puts me on my ass. 

“Next one’s with the left hand. 

Are you angry Nikolas? “ Sylvia looms over me like a raven. 

I feel something before I get to my feet, a hot, quick flash of hatred. A context free rage at the fucked up situation I’m in. 

“Answer is still no. Because to be angry, I’d have to know a God-Damned thing about what’s going on. 

But my lunatic aunt just picked me up and now I’m standing in the middle of whatever the English equivalent to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre family is. 

For all I know, I’m your new King. So no, I’m not angry, I’m annoyed, and maybe a bit worried my gene pool really needs some chlorine. “ I’m shocked at what I’m saying, but I see some smiles, hear a few laughs. 

Sylvia’s face seems to soften slightly. 

“There’s the Gritt in you. “ She says, starting to walk to an old barn. 

I catch up to her as I attempt in vain to dust myself off. 

Sylvia opens a small, strangely modern looking door, inside a row of lights automatically flip on. 

In contrast to the rotten wood exterior, the inside of the barn looks modern, design wise it’s half way between a hospital and a car repair shop. Equipment of unknown purpose, gurneys and cages of all sizes and types surround  me. 

Sylvia walks to a door at the back, then pauses. 

“Before I open this door, you need to understand something. 

There is no fortune telling, or reading of cards here. The cloak of the traveller, the bangles of the gypsy, these are all ways of navigating the world to us. Ways to exist on the fringes of society. 

The Gritt family, we trade in the unknown. We find, we collect, and we sell. And ours is no petty collection of trinkets and tools not meant for the hands of man. 

Our grift, is livestock. “

The woman opens the door, and what I see, sitting, chained in one corner of the industrial cement walled cell shakes everything I thought I knew about reality. 

He's six and a half feet tall, his skin a waxy yellow, and every spare inch is festooned with black stitching, rusted pieces of metal or small splinters of bone. 

His face is noseless and asymmetrical, almost as if repaired or modified over and over. One eye is a small, sinister looking orb with a red pupil, the other a massive, almost reptilian thing, wildly twitching about. 

He wears no shirt, but a long, grey hide Trenchcoat hangs down to his knees. I start to shake as I see it’s  made from layers of stitched human skin. 

He sneers at us, long, conical teeth catch the harsh halogen light. 

The thing strains against the chains, but they bind him tightly enough to the wall he can barely move. 

“You’re not lasting more than 4 seconds kid. Just turn the fuck around. I’ll have you slitting your wrists in the corner by nightfall. “ The thing says, it’s voice is foul, almost a physical force. Grating, rage filled, and with a lunatic edge to it that makes me question exactly how much  those chains can take. 

“ 3/10, Augustus, who do you think you are scaring with that limp dick of a threat? “ Sylvia says, confidently walking up to the creature. 

It snaps it’s jaws with a sound like a rifle shot. No where near Sylvia, but enough to make me jump on the other side of the room. 

“If I could stop being threatened and hearing my aunt talk about dicks, I’d be a huge fan. “ I say, something deep within me, pushing past the fear and lack of sleep, “And if anything feels like just telling me what’s going on instead of being vague and creepy, even better. “ 

The chained thing looks to me, curious. Sylvia smirks. 

“Augustus is going to be forced to fight others like him until eventually he gets what’s coming to him for years of evil. 

You, are going to stand next to him while he does it. “ Sylvia begins to walk away from the thing, ignoring vile threats of both the violent and carnal variety. 

I try to follow her out the door and she blocks me. 

“If your still sane and alive in the morning, I was right. Good luck soft boy. “ She says before closing the heavy metal door. 

Without her, I feel tiny, that spark of rage is snuffed out and replaced with a cold sense of dread. 

“You’re going to have to turn around sometime kid. “ The chained creature says. 

I turn, slowly, resolving to make eye contact with the thing. I manage a second or two before looking away, the creature cackles, mocking me. 

“Holy shit, they sent me an honest to God pussy. Whole family full of void fucked apes and they send me you? 

The best part is, you don’t even get it. I can see what you’re thinking kid, I can see that tiny collection of hormones and goo you vainly call a brain going into overdrive trying to figure this out… “ Augustus starts. 

The creature kept going, I don’t have an exact count but it was at least twelve hours. 

I can only describe it as a verbal assault. Augustus drew from some dark wells, how it knew half of the things it did scared me as much as it’s clawed hands or, piranha-like teeth. 

I lost something that night. The fears that thing drug up, the insecurities it played on, the secrets it knew, it crushed any childlike notions of safety or understanding the world I had. 

Don’t take that the wrong way, I don’t mean it toughened me up. It broke any sense of confidence I had, took away any feeling of safety. That God Damned thing in the trenchcoat, changed me. 

I’ve lost track of how long it’s been since I’ve slept, but I’m brought a tin plate heaped with eggs, sausage and for some twisted reason, brown beans. And realize it’s been at least a day since I’ve eaten. 

I sit around an abused, graffiti carved picnic table with an eclectic combination of family I’ve never met. Syl sips a tea I can smell from ten feet away and looks at me like I’m a used car. 

“I’m always right soft boy. Remember that. “ She says. 

It takes a half dozen guys built like construction workers, with Sylvia following behind whispering things that wilt vegetation, to wrangle the creature into the back of an old, reinforced horse trailer. 

The inside is covered in totems, runes, and other spooky looking errata. The entity becomes sluggish and disoriented as the heavy wooden doors close, and get sealed with a  massive brass lock. 

My mind begins to wander on the three hour trip through the back country of the UK. The sun sets, and my brain screams for sleep. That scream is silenced by the sense of  mounting dread as we get closer to our destination. 

We pull up to an abandoned theme restaurant, the parking lot is full, the windows are boarded, and the walls covered in graffiti. The place is huge, more the size of a small stadium than a diner. 

The parking lot is full, the sputtering, sparking neon sign flashes “Faron’s Funhouse. “ 

It’s a few minutes outside of a town I forgot to catch the name of. We can see lights on the horizon, but there’s a feeling of wrong surrounding the building that makes them seem a million miles away. 

A half dozen ‘cousins’ of mine move Augustus into a strange, almost coffin-like box made of wood, steel and glass,  covered in trinkets and symbols. The thing sneers groggily from within, it’s mismatched eyes rolling in it’s skull. 

I don’t hear Sylvia approach, I notice her as she smacks me in the back of the head hard enough to make my ears ring. The old, cruel woman is walking toward the doors of this meeting place. 

“Eyes forward, sneer on your face, and walk like you know where you’re going. “ Are her only instructions. 

For once, they’re clear and simple. What I see inside easily keeps my attention, and I’m equal parts scared and pissed off, so looking edgy and miserable is my default state. 

At one point, this place was exactly what you’d think. I know you’re all expecting it to be a run down, rat infested haunted house now, but it was, stranger than that. 

The place was well kept on the inside, but everything was either in use or repurposed to house the couple hundred eclectic customers milling around. In the centre, is a massive Lucite Cube, crystal clear and housing a ball pit, jungle gym and what looks to be a functional canteen, complete with  a deep fryer and popcorn machine. It’s a couple hundred meters a side, and shaped like a flawed rectangle. 

Smoke hangs in the air, my aunt greets old friends in a handful of different languages, I smile and nod, still trying to understand what the hell this place is. 

We see Augustus being wheeled to the Lucite box, Sylvia cuts a laughing Cyrillic conversation short, and her and I make our way to the box that barely restrains the hatred and death inside. 

At the other end of the Lucite Cube I see a few people dressed in blue and maroon uniforms ( if I were to guess vintage, from when this place served shitty food instead of violence.), they surround a massive, hulking, lanky thing. It’s obscured by smoke, and poor lighting, but it’s nine foot frame, and unnatural gait are clear. 

The box holding Augustus sits about ten feet away from me, inside the massive cage. The front opens, my instinct is to step backward, get as much distance between me and the thing inside as possible, but instead, I’m shoved, before I can catch my balance, a workbook clad foot is in front of me. 

I fall and stumble into the cage, I turn around to try and get out as fast as I can, I’m standing inches away from the creature, but I see Sylvia closing the clear, impermeable door. 

It hits me then. For the first time since this ordeal started, I realize how grim things are. 

Just like everyone else here, I’ve been raised on spooky shit packaged to be marketable. Little monsters,  The Adams Family, Harry potter, hell let’s throw Pokemon and the like in there as it’s basically just dog fighting with a cute hat on. 

And I thought what was happening to me, was somewhere on the Venn diagram of those things. 

But as I see the impassive look on the face of a woman I’ve known since I was a child, ( at a distance or no.) as I’m locked in here with God knows what, I get it. I really get it. 

His laughter is like an ice pick, I turn to face him, Augustus brushes himself off, casually looking around the massive arena. 

“Just hit ya didn’t it, bud? “ He says, walking over to me, his steps impossibly quick, almost insect-like, “You’re not my trainer, or my wrangler, you certainly aren’t my fucking partner. “, the entity grabs my chin between two clawed fingers, “ You’re a bait dog. Something for me and that new blooded walking pun to fight over. “

My blood runs down his thumb, his grin cracks his face like a rotten melon, the monster pulls down, throwing me to the floor. 

A buzzer sounds, and a three minute timer, projected in transparent  red appears on the walls of the Lucite arena. 

“If I’ve got to hunt you down in this shit-hole, things are going to be a lot worse for you. Stay put, bud. “ The trenchcoat clad thing says, casually walking toward the creature on the opposite side of the arena. 

Closer now, I see it clearly. Inside of a pristine uniform, is a twisted attempt at the human form. The torso is lumpen, asymmetrical, but lean. It's arms nearly drag on the floor, yellow, infected looking flesh, weeping pus like a snail’s foot. 

It's eyes are black caves, with just the hint of something deep within. It’s face is blank, a torn, haggard looking grey tongue runs over rotting green teeth. 

The kid beside it looks around my age, he’s big though, just as confused and afraid as I am. He wears a similar uniform to the creature, but his looks, abused, torn, blood stained. Like it's been handed down from one unlucky owner  to the next. 

As the buzzer rings, the lanky, disgusting creature moves in a flash, tearing off the kid’s right arm and beginning to chew it. 

The blood didn’t set me off, as terrible as it was. It was the three seconds between the act, and the poor kid realizing what happened that pushed me over the edge. 

He started to scream, a horrible trapped animal kind of noise. He backs away from the monster beside him, gripping the crushed and torn remains of his forearm. 

Augustus laughs, his trenchcoat drags on the floor, leaving a streak of blood as he walks. 

“Man after my own heart. 

So, I say, we split these sides of beef for two minutes then talk shop for a bit. Fuck these pretentious apes and their show. “ Augustus looks up to the massive thing. It remains impassive, gnawing on the hand. 

“Don’t be like that. We both know two halves are better than one whole . Win-win for both of us“ Augustus gets a noise that sounds like an angry sewer pipe, and a dismissive wave of a long snake-like arm in response. 

The thing in the trenchcoat shrugs, turning around and stalking toward me. 

“You have no luck at all kid, I was going to let you go last. 

But the pinworm back there wants to be a dick about things, so looks like things are getting started early. “ Augustus grins, his mouth opening shark like. 

I stare down certain death, Augustus radiating fear, seeming to become more demonic with each step toward me. 

From behind him, a noise. 

I would have just assumed it was some part of the worm-like, filth ridden thing eating. Augustus clears up that misconception. 

He turns, shaking, body language that of a wild animal. 

“Was that a fucking snicker? A giggle? Are you fucking laughing at me, you literal fucking worm. “ He’s panting, hands twitching like dying insects. 

He stands, inches from the other creature, dwarfed by it, teeth grinding, muscles straining. 

The worm thing casually tosses the flesh bare hand toward Augustus. As it touches his coat, the arena erupts into a kind of wild, senseless, limitless violence. 

It doesn’t feel like watching a fight, it’s more like a car wreck, or natural disaster. Pieces of jungle gym turn into lethal shrapnel as the blurred, filth spewing scrum destroys them. 

I see the timer, 2:15. My mind starts to catch up, and I see the other kid, pale, whimpering, and trying in vain to staunch the blood spurting from his arm. 

I’m running, low and likely poorly, pulling my belt from my pants, and thanking myself for actually listening when I was forced to take a first aid course for a summer job last year. 

The kid is scared, he tries pushing me away, but I’m determined, and not down a couple pints of blood. I pull the belt with two hands, pull it through again and twist, it’s ugly, it’s not perfect, but the flow of blood begins to slow, then stop. 

We crawl behind a prize counter, decades old candy and stuffed animals surround us as we cower.  A liquid filled roar loud enough to crack the cheap glass cases fills the room. 

The kid is looking rough, blood still trickling from the torn stump of his forearm. I see some plastic bags and get an idea. 

I lean over to get them, and feel something strange, at first I think I pulled a muscle. 

Then there is a deep, burning pain, instinctively I pull away, and turn around. 

The kid is on his knees, sanity has left his eyes, a cheap hunting knife in his remaining hand he has a look of panic and determination on his face. 

“We have to win. “ he says, lunging at me with the blade. 

He’s slow, and I avoid it, but not by as much as I’d like. Blood runs down my back, for a moment I wonder how bad I’m hurt, but it doesn’t really matter right now. 

I retreat, but the only thing keeping us from being torn apart by the whirlwind of shrapnel caused by the creatures is the counter, I can’t escape. 

It's a stalemate, I’m no athlete, and the kid is built like a rugby player, but he’s missing a hand, and delirious from blood loss. I plead, I try and reason, and I dodge crazed strikes by increasingly narrow margins. 

Something large, either thrown or knocked loose destroys the counter behind me. Suddenly all is chaos. I’m thrown into the kid in the uniform, plaster dust surrounds us in a grey cloud. 

By the time the air clears the kid is on top of me. I have his wrist in one hand, keeping the split tip of the blade inches from my face. 

The angle is too awkward, I can’t get any leverage. It’s not a stalemate, it’s a war of attrition that I’m losing. 

I catch a glimpse of the two creatures. The worm thing is striking at Augustus, who stands still, limbs moving in arcing blurs deflecting the blows and tearing off chunks of foul, tainted flesh. 

The tip of the knife begins to dig into my cheek. A drop of blood hits my eye. 

I grab the makeshift tourniquet with a free hand and roughly yank forward. The kid on top of me screams, bloods begins to pour. Torn flesh and a gore soaked belt hit the ground. 

For a moment the weight on me eases up, and I push the knife forward. But the kid, he’s too stupid or far gone to just back off. As I feel is strength start to fade, he presses himself harder. 

I expect him to back off as I begin to drive the roughly sharpened back edge of the knife into his neck. But he doubles down, leaning forward, trying to press the knife toward me. 

For a moment, every other fucked up thing going on around me doesn’t matter. The world is small, silent, and consists of nothing more than the image of the knife ripping away a fist sized strip from the kids neck.

He backs off when he realizes the extent of the damage. Staring at me shocked, as if just not realizing the consequences of his actions. 

He dies slowly, poorly, and within inches of me. I feel no victory, no sense of being a winner, just a dark pit in the back of my mind. The loss of something that comes with taking someone’s life. 

I stand, shell shocked, staring at the corpse. My safety the last thing on my mind. 

The worm thing is hurt, and attempts to dive into the ball pit, but somehow, defying physics, Augustus grabs it, holding the half ton monster out with one hand. 

He arcs the thing, slamming it into the floor behind him, the spray of gore and viscera rivals pyrotechnics, the force leaves a blood filled crater in the floor. 

Without missing a beat Augustus starts to walk toward me, making a token effort of flicking pieces of bone and organ from himself. 

I’m frozen, I know nothing I can do could stop whatever he has planned. 

The creature picks up a jagged piece of lumber, and looks at the clock, “We’ve got 45 seconds of fun left kid. “ he says with a sneer. 

But as he passes the counter, and sees the corpse the look of imminent violence turns into amusement. 

“How’s it feel to be a child killer, bud? “, Augustus laughs, “Not that I can’t tell from the look on your face. 

Fuck me, that knocked some gears loose didn’t it? “

The thing walks forward, looking me over like a collectable. 

“I can’t let that go to waste, now can I? “ he slaps me lightly, “It’s going to be a fucking blast watching you break down kid, wonder what drives you nuts first, this kid being in your dreams, or the fact that, at some point I’m going to get bored and start giving you all the pain you feel you deserve? “

Of course, I made it out alive. It’d be kind of hard to have posted this if I didn’t. 

But now, I sit in a dingy room in a farm house half way across the world from home. Surrounded by family and monsters, all of which seem out to get me. Being forced to risk my life in some kind of blood sport. 

Maybe I’ll be back, maybe I’ll be dead by the next time I get a chance to post anything. If anyone has any help, please, post it in the comments. I’m in a dark place here and no one else seems to be on my side.
