When I was around 9 or 10 years old, I experienced something that I still can’t explain. I don’t know if it was a glitch in reality, some strange sleep disorder, or something else entirely—but whatever happened, it has stuck with me my entire life.

It started like any other night. I was at home, feeling tired after a long day. It was dark outside, and the house was quiet. I don’t remember anything unusual happening before bed—no strange sounds, no eerie feelings, nothing out of the ordinary. Just a normal night. I got into bed, closed my eyes, and fell asleep.

And then, I woke up.

But something was different.

First, I wasn’t in the same bed. I was still in my house, but somehow, I had moved to a different bed. At first, I assumed I must have just shifted in my sleep, but I never did that before. Then, as I sat up, I realized something else was wrong—it was morning.

That’s when I felt it—this deep, heavy tiredness, like I had been asleep for a long time. Too long. My body felt sluggish, like it was trying to catch up with lost time. Still, I pushed the feeling aside, got dressed, and went about my normal morning routine. Nothing seemed off in the house. My parents didn’t say anything unusual. It was just another school day.

Or so I thought.

When I got to school, my teacher looked at me strangely. Not in a "you’re late" kind of way, but in a "Where have you been?" kind of way.

She stared at me for a second before saying, "Oh, you’re back. You weren’t here yesterday."

I froze.

Yesterday? What does she mean? I was here yesterday… wasn’t I?

I racked my brain, trying to remember the day before—but there was nothing. Just blankness. It was like my last memory was going to sleep, and then suddenly, it was today. The entire previous day had vanished.

I didn’t know what to say, so I just mumbled, "I was sick." It was the easiest excuse I could think of, and I didn’t want to seem weird. My teacher didn’t push further, so I sat down and tried to act normal.

But inside, I was panicking.

If I had been asleep the whole day, why didn’t my parents say anything? Wouldn’t they have noticed? Wouldn’t they have tried to wake me up? And if I had been awake, where was I? What had I been doing?

I never told my parents. I was scared—not just that they wouldn’t believe me, but that maybe they would. What if they had seen something weird? What if they had looked for me and couldn’t find me?

To this day, I have zero memory of that missing day. It’s like it never existed for me. I’ve never experienced sleepwalking, blackouts, or anything like this before or after. It was a one-time thing, and that somehow makes it even creepier.

So what really happened to me? A lost day, with no explanation, no clues, and no answers.

I still wonder if I’ll ever know the truth.
