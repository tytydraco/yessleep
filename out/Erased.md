I need help badly. I’m not sure where else to turn, so I’ll post here.  Does anyone at all know a man maned Ernest Treverson? Blonde hair, green eyes, above average height, big on jogging. I can’t find him anywhere and it’s because of that thing, that abomination.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I suppose some background is necessary. Ernest and I went way back from meeting in eighth grade and since then we did pretty much everything together. We were like magnets sticking together. Now, I will say while he was always health-conscious, I was anything but. He’d be having a protein shake a day and the only protein I’d be getting would be from a Big Mac large combo.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The topic of my weight would be brought up a lot by both family and friends much to my annoyance. I was in denial which resulted in me being morbidly obese up until about two years ago.  Ethan and I kept in touch after graduation. He continued his passion for fitness and became a motivational instructor.  Meanwhile, I didn’t have money for college so I ended up taking different office jobs, something where I could sit on my ass all day.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This, of course, didn’t help my weight problem. It was getting worse and a visit to my doctor gave me a serious reality check. Extreme cholesterol and on the verge of becoming diabetic will give anyone a serious fright. Not to mention, the heartburn I would occasionally experience around that time. In fact, he said  I was lucky I hadn't experienced a heart attack at that point.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was scheduled with a nutritionist who informed me if I wanted this reversed, I would need a serious lifestyle change. The issue is I’ve never been good at committing to something like that. I’d try crash diets plenty of times only to fall off them mere months later.  That night after my nutrition appointment, I did a lot of introspection, going over each time I tried and failed to change my habits. I already knew where I was going wrong.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The main issue is that, as unhealthy as my lifestyle was, it was comfortable. Exercise and healthy eating require dedication. Why do all that when you can get a Baconator from Wendy’s? Convenient and satisfying with the only drawback of clogging your arteries like wet cement through a garden hose. The more I thought about things, the more I began to realize the reason I kept failing was that I would always rely on willpower alone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What I required was outside help and therefore, I turned to Earl. We both didn’t work weekends so I gave him a call.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Travis, how’s it going?”

&#x200B;

“Can you help me with something?”

&#x200B;

“Sure, what?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I explained everything to him and his response almost made it seem as if he’d been expecting this from me for a while.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I can help you no problem, but if you aren’t willing to make a permanent change then there’s no point.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even though his words stung, I knew he was right. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How do you do it?” I asked. “It’s so hard for me.”

&#x200B;

“Well, why don’t you come over tomorrow and we can see if we can figure something out? Be there early and bring your jogging clothes.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Another way in which we differed was that he was a morning person who’d be up an hour prior to the crack of dawn. Meanwhile, if work wasn’t a factor, I’d be awake bright and early at two in the afternoon. I drove to his place and parked in his driveway. He must’ve already heard my car’s engine because he came out to greet me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why’d this have to be so early?”

&#x200B;

“You’ll be doing more than that if you’re serious about turning things around.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We went inside and talked for a bit on his couch and I told him how it was hard for me to resist temptation. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Have you considered that your issue may be you’ve been trying to do too much at once?”

&#x200B;

“What do you mean?”

&#x200B;

“Okay, you said that you always try to only eat healthy with your diet, right?”

&#x200B;

“Yeah.”

&#x200B;

"And that you only tried to eat healthily?"

&#x200B;

"What about it?"

&#x200B;

"What if instead, you used certain foods as an incentive?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That piqued my interest so I asked him to elaborate.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“In short, instead of quitting the food you like altogether, try the healthy alternatives like I mentioned and give yourself a cheat day.”

&#x200B;

“Cheat day?”

&#x200B;

“Where you treat yourself to whatever foods you want for a day.”

&#x200B;

“That might work. Is it a once-a-week thing?”

&#x200B;

“How often did you say your diets lasted again?”

&#x200B;

“Only a few months, four at the most.”

&#x200B;

“Then try a once-a-month cheat day.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I thought about it and it made sense. If I was able to go months at a time without junk food, in theory, what Earnest was proposing made sense.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Now, you’ll slip up sometimes,” he continued. “Don’t worry about that. It happens. Besides, once we get you in shape, you’ll be able to afford a few extra treats outside of your cheat days. Just don’t overdo it. Anyway, are you ready to get started?”

&#x200B;

“As ready as I’ll ever be I guess.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ernest told me to pick an exercise to help with my weight loss and I chose jogging because it seemed like the easiest. That didn’t mean it wasn’t difficult. Over the next few months, I was subject to two-hour-long runs and my feet would be screaming at me by the end of them. My diet also changed drastically and it actually wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. Ernest gave me some of his recipes, including a pretty good protein shake.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Turns out that no matter what you put in if you add chocolate that’s all you’ll taste. Even though I didn’t find turkey burgers as good as beef, the way he had me prepare them was undeniably tasty. I should mention, my two-hour runs were spaced out, once in the morning and the other after work, and two hours straight on my days off. I wanted to quit plenty of times and I would have if not for Ernest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He kept pushing me and while I did get irritated with him, he remained patient. I apologized to him and he laughed it off, saying he’s dealt with much worse. Eventually, my hard work paid off and my pounds slowly shed. It felt great., especially in contrast to how I was originally.  I was proud of myself and so was he. In fact, when I hit my goal he treated me to pizza at a local spot we went to often back when we were in school.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He paid most of the time. I don’t want to get too off-topic, but I didn’t have the best home life growing up so I would spend a lot of time at his place. Eating at that place really took me back. Even after my weight loss, he and I would still jog together. We would talk which would help time fly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

By then, he’d gotten a girlfriend named Kristy which meant he and I weren’t hanging out as much. That’s to be expected, though. However,  about two weeks ago something happened during one of our jogs. Looking back, something about that night felt off and in retrospect, we should have recognized that as a warning sign. We met at the usual trail and found that we were the only ones there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Looks like it’s going to be quiet,” Ernest commented as we were stretching.

&#x200B;

“Fine by me,” I replied, “I hate having to deal with the cyclists.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We hit the trail and made conversation as usual.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So. how’s work?” he asked me.

&#x200B;

“Pretty good, I switched jobs.”

&#x200B;

“Really?”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, it’s weird. It’s hard for me to sit still for a long time now. I wanted something where I was moving around more.”

&#x200B;

“What did you switch to?”

&#x200B;

"Security at the natural history museum."

&#x200B;

"Cool."

&#x200B;

"Thanks, anyway what's been going on with you?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He glanced at me and his lips curled into a smile.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What is it?" I asked with a slight chuckle.

&#x200B;

"I'm going to ask Kristy to marry me."

&#x200B;

"Holy shit. Are you serious? Dude, that is awesome. Who else have you told about this?"

&#x200B;

"Only you."

&#x200B;

"Only me?"

&#x200B;

"Yeah because you won't talk. Kristy means a lot to me so I want to get this right."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He and her really did make a good couple. I just wish their relationship didn't have to end the way it did.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Well, good luck with that. Let me know where the wedding will be so I can drop off my gift."

&#x200B;

"Come on, Travis, don't be like that. You know you're the only one I want as my best man."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Truth be told, I've never seen the appeal of weddings. However, in Ernest's case, I was willing to make an exception. We were coming up to a curve in the trail that was overshadowed by branches.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Alright, I guess I can pop in for a little while."

&#x200B;

"Hell yeah, that's the spirit. I knew I could count on you."

&#x200B;

"No prob-"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I stopped. Then so did he.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Travis? What's wrong?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I pointed and he squinted. Then he grew concerned as well. There was a long-haired woman sitting on the trail. She was in a crouching position and from what we could tell, she had her arms wrapped around her knees.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you think she’s an addict?” I whispered, not wanting to alert her.

&#x200B;

“Could be,” Ernest replied. “She must be freezing.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The woman was only wearing a gown similar to the ones in hospitals.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Maybe she got out of a facility,” I said. “Know what? I’m getting a bad feeling about this. We should head back.”

&#x200B;

“What if she needs help?”

&#x200B;

“Then we’ll call someone.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Like who, the cops? Come on, you know how they treat these kinds of people. Besides, what can she really do against the two of us?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I couldn’t deny his points. Still, I wasn’t able to shake off the sense something wasn’t right.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Look,” Ernest went on, “we’ll see if she has a medical band and if it has a number we can call. If not, we’ll turn around and leave. Sound good?”

&#x200B;

“I guess.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We approached the woman. Ernest was in front with me slightly behind him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Excuse me,’ he called out to her. “Do you need some help?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She shifted slightly but didn’t respond.  Up close, we could now see her skin was eerily pale. I wondered how long she’d been out there before we found her. Ernest stepped closer and I watched closely. What happened next did so in slow motion. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He reached for her and that’s when she acted.  She looked up from the trail. Her face made my breath stop. It wasn’t ugly. It was wrong. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don’t know how else to explain it other than it was as if she never meant to be there. I wanted to shout at Ernest to get away from her. Before I could, it was already too late. Her hand shot out, grabbing his wrist exposed between his glove and sleeve. He vanished.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It wasn’t some rapture scenario where his clothes were left behind. He was completely gone simply by that woman making contact with him. She stood up fast and I could now see that her arms were incredibly long. They had multiple joints giving them a crooked appearance. She used a nearby branch for support. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It vanished too. What was unsettling is that there wasn’t even any imprint or indication a tree was ever there. I backed up slowly and I swear she smiled at me. I didn’t waste another second. I bolted. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She was fast and in the back of my mind, I was questioning how she was able to keep up without shoes on. Then again, there’s no way she could’ve been human. I’m so grateful for Ernest whipping me into shape because that saved my ass. I didn’t dare glance back. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, every so often I would feel the breeze on the back of her neck when she tried swiping at me. I pushed myself harder than I ever have in my life. Up ahead, was the parking lot. To my confusion, Ernest’s car wasn’t there anymore. I didn’t have time to think about that, though. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I hit unlock on my keys and yanked the door open, slamming it closed and locking it when I was inside. As soon as I was, I jumped as the woman’s hand slammed against my window. She began pounding it in an enraged frenzy and a crack was quickly forming. Shakily, I jammed my keys into the ignition and turned it. The engine roared to life and I reversed it, speeding the fuck out of there with her still giving chase.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced at my rearview mirror, She was standing at the edge of the parking lot, screaming her head off. The sound of it was deafening and it made my windows rattle. When I got home, I immediately reported Ernest missing. Then I called Kristy. Her reply has left me shaken to my core.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Who’s Ernest?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My veins turned my blood to frost.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What the hell do you mean?” I shouted.

&#x200B;

“Travis, calm down.”

&#x200B;

“Ernest, you know, the guy who’s been your boyfriend for the last four years?”

&#x200B;

“I’m sorry. I don’t know what you’re talking about. Look, I don’t know if you’re on drugs or something, but you should get help.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She hung up, leaving me dumbfounded. Was this a joke? I couldn’t imagine her pulling a prank this cruel. I tried his parents next and got a similar result. I even tried his sister, Ann and some of our other friends. They all thought I had lost it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The police contacted me and I was told not to waste their time by giving fake reports. I couldn’t believe it. Nobody else believed Ernest ever existed. I’ve tried convincing people to no avail. Whatever scenario they met him in has been wiped completely from their memories. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’ve even asked how I met them since sometimes Ernest introduced me to people. They’ll describe the correct places only without Ernest there and with someone else introducing me aside from him. None of this makes any sense. Ann insists it was her I spent the most time with when we were younger. Both of them were less than a year apart.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don’t get what’s going on. There’s no way all my memories can be wrong. I may have a lot of flaws, but forgetfulness isn’t one of them. I know there was an Ernest Treverson who was my best friend. I know we grew up together and I know he’s the only reason I’m still here to type this. 

&#x200B;

I know all this and that I’m not crazy, because I still have a gift he bought me. It’s a Fitbit that he ordered online and nobody else can confirm they brought it for me. I even checked through my order history on every account I have which means I couldn’t have been the one to buy it. Too bad that won’t be enough to convince people. At the very least, it’s given me some peace of mind. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’m not sure why I’m the only one who remembers him. Maybe it has something to do with the fact I was the last person to see him before he disappeared. What was that woman and where did she come from? What is she? I’ve been trying to figure that out for weeks now and have come up with nothing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It’s as if she made it so Ernest never even existed in the first place. How many others has she done this to? When someone dies or goes missing, there’s usually something they leave behind. Even blood or a butchered corpse are signs that a thinking feeling person with family and friends once lived.  No matter how gruesome, they were signs a person was once here.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ernest doesn’t even get that. I’m so angry about all of this. I want to confront that woman again. I want to make her pay for what she did and demand she bring him back, but I know that I would only end up meeting the same fate in all likelihood. Still, if anyone knows anything that might help bring him back, please share it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That woman didn’t kill him. She made it so he was never here, to begin with, and to me, that is a [very](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) scary [thing.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)
