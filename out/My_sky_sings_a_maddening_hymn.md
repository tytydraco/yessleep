Again. I hear it. It comes often yet visits infrequently. Inconsistency that teases me from peace in my home. An unsubstantial tick with no meaning aside from overbearing accumulation. From my ceiling they pleasure themselves, splattering to the kitchen tile. At least, until I bested them with a bucket. Their cruel master taunts me still. No longer could he reach my floors. Now, in what I assume is annoyance, he stains my ceiling with his legionaries before dismissal. Drop after drop after drop, a pace that is unreadable, making it all unbearable. I refuse to check the source. My mission stretches me too thin, the importance too great. The means needed for resolution I do not possess, and why stress myself in greeting my torturer.



Why is all I can wonder. Why the games. Why the punishment. I am a flawed man but to deserve this? Injustice is what it is. I am a man of noble cause. Despite what they’ll tell you, my actions are no sin. I act to better the whole. I am a saint among men, my purpose, to cure waste. Eating rotted food is a virtue. I am a savior for precious energy and life that others condemn so easily. It is the divine plan God chose for me. Nourishment all can enjoy and they’ll call it sin.



But here I am in desperation. Why curse me for my virtue,God? My suffering can’t be the fault of me alone. Have you grown angry with my resolutions? My unwillingness to the calls you let fall above me. The bucket resisting the mess of your weeps. I sense the frustration in what I assume is your blushed cheeks, growing on my ceiling. Please stop your tears from falling harder. I cannot understand. I cannot handle this punishment you’re giving me. I am one of your servants. 



I've stopped using my upstairs—no more bedroom, no more space. I refuse to acknowledge the drips. Out of sight, out of mind is what I wish. But their untimeliness rings in my ears. When it began, I brought my essentials to the living room. Pit or pile, I can't tell, of clothing by the couch. Marg, my cat, loved to be cradled at the center. Her imprint still lies there, creating a volcano. Coffee table is littered with stuff, things and waste: deodorant, stained disposables, lotion, remotes, coasters. My home has been raptured, empty of Marg and Mom and replaced with disaster. The endless and improbable rain of the kitchen, volcanoes, and landslides. He leaves me to suffer this ruin.



What they’ll call my sin, started with fruits. Bananas to be specific. They all ripen at off times, cultivating those deep mahogany to black “bruises”. I never understood why we all considered bananas to waste at this point. Yes, the color is off-putting and the texture is slimy, but I’ve learned to love them. I’d close my eyes and eat them as fast as possible at the start. After the first few it became enjoyable. My rush slowed and I savored the experience. The rot that took root in their flesh was of an indescribable sweetness. A precious caramel that only nature could nurture. 



My experimentation grew from here. Apples were a similar story. I found myself awaiting their rot, until they would tremble and squirm to my touch. Only then were they ripe. Berries became a favorite, the rot consumes them fastest. In one bite I experienced their sweet flesh mush to a heavenly juice. Every berry delivers ecstasy. Fruit succumbs to time in a beautiful way. Their sweet flavor becomes indescribable. Flies know this. They swarm and feast the rot with no discrepancy. I envy their passions. 



My relocation to the living room keeps me closer to the kitchen. Like flies I have started orbiting the rot, eagerly awaiting ripenings. From counter to fridge to counter, constantly checking. Hoping. I am not alone in eagerness, that which is lying upstairs has amplified calls for my visitation. I hear it in its sweaty beats of vitality. I see it in concentration.



Incidentally, I explored beyond rotting fruit. A line I was wary to cross. Packaged chicken breast sat deep in the fridge while groceries whittled down. When found, it was stewing in a creamy white slime, for what looked to be weeks. It begged for consumption. I couldn’t let an animal die in vain, slaughtered with no rhyme or reasoning. It was here I realized waste is a curse among us.



I accepted its pleas and was met with a terse aroma. A scent I had not yet known I was chasing with fruit appeared. Sour and full bodied, unlike its wispy counterpart. The flavor, hearty as the smell. I reveled in that experience. After that night, I knew my calling. That God needed me as a saint to purge waste. 



I started shopping for rot, there to be the saviour. Conveniently, stores marked it down with disgust. Oh, they are all so ignorant. His holiness aided me, he helped me save money and reach further in my deeds. With the savings, I could cure more waste. The fancy fish and beef made it all the more exciting. Fish became my staple for how fast it readied. I gauged meat based on that cream-based nectar accumulating in the package and fish never disappointed.



My body grew familial with rot. I stopped getting sick, which panned out well for me. My mother, disgusted with my habits, could not understand. When I was sick, things escalated. She called my bliss disgusting, among worse words and threatened me out the house. But I couldn’t stop, I promised God. I believe, for that, he immunized me to carry out his divinity. No longer getting sick, I started to eat raw, experiencing rot in a purer essence.



With my mother gone, my ambitions grew. I no longer found use in the fridge. Leaving it all on the counter meant ripening would come sooner. Next, I knew I was not doing enough to end the plague. I drove to local shops and rooted through their trash to please God. Daily walks in my freetime along busy roads scouring for waste. My answer was found in roadkill. It lies there, and he illuminates it in sunlight for my attention. The smell and taste, ethereal. I knew he was pleased with my efforts. That he would reward me graciously. 



Yet, he didn’t. Instead he punishes me with that presence. Demons of invariance that toil with mind. Their calls grow deafening by the moment. Yesterday, it was whimpering. This morning whispers, now words. I hear them. My efforts to ignore them, futile. It's a beg, a familiar one. The dripping is synchronizing, harmonizing. It departs from my harsh torment. In my willingness to now hear, I recognize. It is the same plea I first heard of rotting meat. God wasn’t cursing me. I was just too ignorant to feel his benevolence. He marks my house of rot in approval. I know I must visit those above and accept the offering.



I crawl up the steps in anxious excitement. Met with the hallway, the upstairs that had grown hazy in my mind clarified. Teeming from my mothers room is that haunting substance tracked with footprints in and out. A rust red with deep ruby overtone seeps into the crevices of the hardwood. Hordes of flies swarm the door in infatuation, together they omit a musk so dense it stagnates in the hallway. It is beyond comprehension yet warmingly familiar. It reminds me of the cream of rot, it feels of the same slime.



Ready to forgive my tormenter, I open the door. The floor is littered with bones, large and small, atop of that rosy slime. Some cracked open and others draped with chewed flesh. I pull myself deeper into the room, eyeing the bones, excited to cure their waste. At the center lies a hammer and two rotting corpses, one of woman and of cat. They resemble stomped out campfires, broken inward, missing essentials, collapsed, and then dispersed. Now, I recognize. God finally indicts me as his saint. For my hardships he has rewarded me a feast. I stoop to my hands and knees to apologize for my ignorance. Then taste the rot.
