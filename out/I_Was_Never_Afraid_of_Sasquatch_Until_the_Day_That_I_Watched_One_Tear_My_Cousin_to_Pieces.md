There’s something about Bigfoot that just isn’t very scary to me. Maybe it’s the countless bumper stickers I’ve seen depicting him wearing sunglasses or giving a thumbs-up; maybe it’s his association with beef jerky or men’s grooming products; maybe it’s the fact that he has slowly been transformed from a ferocious monster into a goofy mascot for the Pacific Northwest over the decades since his inception; but for whatever reason, I just don’t have a lot of respect for the guy. He’s never once scared me, not in all my years living in this region and the countless nights I’ve spent out in the woods beneath the stars, listening to all the unknown sounds that seem to drip from the surrounding trees like a broken faucet, their sources indistinguishable but in my mind definitely not produced by a massive, hairy ape that is stalking me from just beyond the edges of my campfire’s glow. He’s simply never been frightening to me — or rather I should say he *used* to never be. I still struggle to remember that those feelings exist in the past tense now; and they most certainly won’t ever be coming back.

None of this is to say that I never *believed* in Sasquatch. I, probably to a fault, tend to believe in almost every cryptid under the sun, regardless of how much evidence there may be in support of or contrary to their existence. In my opinion, the more that exists out there beyond our human understanding, the better. The world’s just more interesting that way, or at least that’s how I see it. Despite believing in him, though, I just never managed to find Sasquatch particularly scary. There are other, similar creatures that certainly inspire fear in me — beasts like werewolves and dogmen, as well as cousins to Bigfoot like the Yeti or even the Skunk Ape — but poor Sasquatch was never able to make the cut.

Not until I encountered one for myself.

My cousin and I were going on one of our usual weekend camping trips, the kind we liked to take a handful of times every year to escape from the craziness of life for a while. Sometimes other friends would join us, but often, as was the case on this particular trip, it was just the two of us and his dog, Groggy. I often find myself wondering if things would have gone differently had there been other people out there with us that day. If we had more people to help us, to help protect us, then maybe he would still be alive.

The trip in question occurred in early December, when the promise of winter was already spreading throughout the mountainous sea of green that was the backdrop for all of our camping excursions. We parked at the base of a hiking trail that, while normally much more well-travelled in the warmer months, saw a large drop-off in activity once the seasonal chill crept its way into the area. It is for this reason that we didn’t expect to see any other people during our 5-mile trek to our usual campsite, a premonition that proved to be correct. The path along that trail can be rigorous, but it’s nothing we weren’t used to, and after disembarking from my cousin’s car and gathering up all of our supplies, the two of us, accompanied by an enthusiastic Groggy, made quick, steady work of trekking along the path to our destination.

One of the things we liked about this particular trail was that it always saw an abundance of wildlife, even when the weather began to turn cold, and this trip was no exception. Birds skirted through the branches about our heads, chittering their pretty songs as they went. Squirrels and chipmunks chased each other through the brush at our feet. A red-tailed hawk unleashed its unmistakable screeching cry somewhere in the distance, surely on the hunt for prey or love. Groggy seemed to enjoy the wildlife just as much as we did; he chased after any small critters we came across, sometimes disappearing into the brush for a few minutes until my cousin beckoned him back with a stern call. The pooch would always come running at his master’s command, and he always returned without ever claiming one of his would-be victims as a prize. I don’t think he ever wanted to actually *hurt* the animals he chased — he was far too sweet for that — but he enjoyed the hunt anyway, if only for the thrill of it. He was a good dog, taken well before his time, and I miss him almost as much as I miss my departed cousin.

My cousin’s phone, mostly a glorified camera due to the lack of cell coverage along the trail, nonetheless decided to go off twice during our walk to camp. Being hypoglycemic, he had an app on his phone that was connected to a sensor in his arm, and went off whenever his blood glucose levels were getting too low. Groggy often managed to detect my cousin’s drop in blood sugar before the phone app did, but the dog was far too distracted to notice his master’s condition while we were on our walk, and as such, my cousin needed to be alerted to his dropping sugars by his device. The interruption these alerts caused were minimal — we only needed to stop for a few minutes each time so he could chug an apple juice and get his levels back to normal — and they were an expected part of going on camping trips with my cousin. I was just about as used to dealing with his blood sugar issues as he was, and rarely thought much of it. We’d never had to call off a camping trip early due to his condition, so when his phone’s alerts went off, I never saw them as more than a slight delay in our adventures. After his second bout with the alarm, my cousin’s body thankfully managed to keep his sugar levels high enough for us to make it to our destination.

We arrived at our usual campsite, a small clearing surrounded by tall, slender white pines and bordered on one side by a steep hill that I am tempted to call a cliff, in the early afternoon. After getting our camp set up, we eagerly made our way to the bank of a nearby river, fishing rods in hand, and, with Groggy dozing lazily between us, spent the next few hours casting our lines and reeling in whatever nature deemed fit to offer us. We alternated back and forth between conversation and peaceful silence while hunting for the fish that we hoped to make our dinner that night. We eventually caught our first (and only) keeper, which we threw into our cooler before resuming our relaxing activity, not realizing that it was soon going to come to an abrupt end.

It was during one of our periods of silence that we discovered the mutilated carcass.

Groggy was the first to notice that something was off. He perked up from his lazy doze and began sniffing the air with an alert seriousness that was uncharacteristic of him, especially when coming right out of a relaxed napping state. His sudden demeanor change prompted my cousin and me to share a concerned glance.

“You alright, boy?” my cousin asked his dog. “Smell something?”

Groggy continued to sniff the air, his back stiff, his ears perked up so high I thought they were preparing to swap places at the top of his head. He stayed in this rigid state for more than half a minute while we watched him, our worry for the distressed pooch only growing. Suddenly an unseen pressure began tugging against my fishing rod, stealing my attention away from the dog. I had to brace against this new weight to prevent my rod from escaping my grip and jumping to its doom in the water. The resistance I felt was so great that I feared that my line would eventually snap with the weight.

“Caught something?” my cousin asked.

“I don’t know,” I said, awkwardly standing up with the rod clutched tightly in my hands. “Maybe. Feels more like I’m hooked on a rock or something.”

“Well reel it in steadily.” My cousin, also rising, grabbed the nearby fishing net, taking its handle into both palms. “Maybe you got something good.”

I did as he advised and began to slowly reel against my mystery catch. It took a considerable amount of effort, and there were several times when I thought my line might give way again, but eventually whatever was on my line drew close enough to the surface to produce a dark shadow just beneath the flowing sheet of water.

“Looks pretty big,” my cousin said, preparing to reach out with the net.

I didn’t respond, instead continuing to concentrate on my catch. It wouldn’t be long before it finally made it to the surface. I just had to keep on reeling.

The mystery catch breached the thin curtain of water, prompting my cousin to lash forward with the net. He didn’t realize until after he had already caught it that what he was going for was the soaked, lifeless head of a doe. When he saw the deceased deer behind that mesh barrier, he immediately pulled the net away and reeled backwards with a spasm of disgusted shock.

The sight of the deer surprised me, but wishing to prevent my rod from ending up in the river and not knowing what else to do, I continued to reel and pull until the dead animal escaped from the frigid current and rested in a soggy heap on the riverbank at our feet. With it fully removed from the water, we realized that what had been caught on my line was actually only the front half of the deer; the back half was completely gone, replaced by a stream of red innards as well as white fragments of the severed spine.

Groggy moved his face toward the dead deer in order to conduct an investigatory sniff, but my cousin shooed him away weakly. “Jesus,” he said. He looked ready to puke. “What do you think did *that*?”

“A bear, maybe?” I said, not believing my own explanation. 

Evidently my cousin didn’t either. He shook his head. “I dunno, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a bear do something like *this* before. And why would it move its prey to the river afterwards?”

I shrugged, not having a rebuttal for him. My mind was elsewhere, thinking about an article I’d read recently about three hikers being mauled to death by a grizzly on a similar trail only five or so miles away from the one we had taken to our campsite. They hadn’t found the culprit; could that same beast have been in our neck of the woods now, practicing its brutal techniques near our campsite? I didn’t like the thought of it.

Thankfully I wouldn’t need to think of that possibility for long. As I stood staring at the ruined deer, my mind was suddenly enveloped by a nauseating scent that overwhelmed my nose and made me physically retch.

My cousin covered his mouth and nose with his shirt. “What the hell is *that*?”

At first I thought the stench belonged to the deer carcass, but a moment’s consideration made me doubt this explanation. It looked fairly fresh, not dead nearly long enough to produce such a rotten smell, and anyway, I had walked by many dead deer in my day, most of which were in worse states of decomposition than our river friend, and none of them had come even *close* to smelling like what we were presently subjected to.

My concentration was again broken, this time by Groggy’s sudden, unexpected growling. My cousin and I looked down at his dog, who was now facing the treeline behind us, once again as stiff as a tree trunk, the hairs on his back and tail as sharp as needles.

“What’s wrong, Grog?” my cousin said, looking back and forth between the treeline and his dog. “What do you see?”

Groggy ignored his master. He continued his long, droning growl, his glare fixed on the thick shadows that took up residence just beyond the treeline. I turned my eyes, watering with the horrible stench, in the direction of the dog’s angry gaze, but I couldn’t see anything past the dense thicket of trees and the darkness that permeated the space therein. My mind flashed back to the news story of that ravenous grizzly, still at large, and I suddenly found myself wishing that I’d taken that firearms class with my sister earlier in the year.

Then came the sound of rustling in the brush. I thought I saw movement beyond the trees, large ferns flapping their thin, verdant bodies in our direction as if they were waving hands, and I fully expected to see that very same grizzly come bounding out of the treeline, hunger in its eyes and violence on its mind. But instead the rustling came to a stop, and the ferns ceased their little dance. The three of us stood staring at the shadow-drenched brush for more than a minute before Groggy finally allowed himself to relax, his persistent growl coming to an end. Only when their chirping returned did I realize that all the birds in the area had gone completely silent since the arrival of the stench, which was already beginning to fade away.

My cousin and I, each breathing a sigh of relief, looked at each other now.

“What was *that*?” I said.

My companion shook his head. “I’m not sure. Could’ve been a bear.”

“Grizzly?”

“I doubt it,” he said. “Maybe a black bear. Something timid enough that ol’ Groggy here was able to intimidate it.”

I looked at beast and master, then back at the treeline, which suddenly looked a little less black. “You think we should get back to camp and pack up?” 

“You mean go back home after taking so long to get out here?” He shook his head again. “Nah, screw that. We’re staying for at *least* one night.”

“But what if that thing comes back?”

“I don’t think it will,” he said. “Not now that it knows Grog means business.”

I considered this for several seconds, feeling unconvinced. “Well, alright then.”

“We’ll be fine,” he said. “And if we ever feel like we’re in danger, we’ll pack it up.” He paused, waiting for affirmation from me. When he didn’t get it, he went on. “Anyway, we should probably get back to camp.” He glanced at the half of a deer carcass dripping death onto the riverbank. “I don’t want to be near that thing in case something out here is looking for an easy snack.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Let’s go.

We returned to our campsite and set about preparing our fire. The crisp afternoon air was soon ablaze with the fresh flame, which crackled in defiance of the stinging December chill. We spent the remainder of the afternoon around the warmth of our campfire, drinking beers and talking about whatever came to mind. My brain felt distant and distracted the entire time as I thought about the eviscerated deer, and the thing that Groggy had felt threatened by that watched us from the shadows. I couldn’t help but wonder if the two things were related, though I hoped with all the enthusiasm I had within me that they were not.

“Maybe it got hit by a truck,” my cousin said after a period of silence, seemingly reading my mind. “There are some roads upriver that go right by the water. Could be that a semi hit that poor thing and sent its front half tumbling into the river while its back half got stuck in the truck’s grille or something.”

I didn’t much care for that mental image, but it offered an explanation that my worried mind evidently found acceptable, if not a little farfetched. I shrugged with hesitant acceptance as I sipped from my beer. “Yeah. Maybe.”

We left it at that, and didn’t resume our conversation until about an hour later, when it was time to prepare our dinner. My cousin began fileting our one keeper of a fish while I set to work boiling water in our cast iron pot and dicing up some vegetables for what was going to be a fish stew. I regularly glanced at Groggy, sitting in front of the fire, as I worked. I noticed that, while he hadn’t gone back on the alert like he had down by the river, he also had never settled back into a state of total relaxation, either. He’d not gone back to sleep since the incident on the riverbank, and kept his gaze focused intently on the thick treeline, as if he expected to detect something there at any moment that would require him to jump into action. His calm readiness filled me with an unshakable chill that persisted despite the raging fire that burned so close to me.

My cousin finished fileting our fish, and we tossed our ingredients into the boiling pot just as the last vestige of sunlight was kissing the world goodbye. The wafting smell of our cooking food drifted on the evening winter air and immediately set my stomach to rumbling. After a long, tiring day, the two of us were incredibly eager to enjoy a warm bowl of stew while relaxing around the hot, cozy fire. Unfortunately, we wouldn’t get the chance to. We didn’t know it at the time, but we would never get to do either of these things together again.

We were sitting around the campfire, chatting while waiting for our stew to finish cooking, when it happened. I don’t remember if the stench or Groggy’s growls came first, but I soon found myself with my coat pulled up over my nose to guard me from that familiar putrid smell while watching the freshly alert dog growling into the sinister darkness being kept at bay by the wall of trees.

I shared a glance with my cousin, who also covered his face with his coat. Though neither of us said a word, the thought that seemed to pass between the two of us like static electricity in the cold air was obvious.

Groggy stood glaring into the trees as that familiar stench overpowered the smell of cooking food and suffocated our campsite with its malice. The dog’s growls grew more angry, more savage; firelight glistened in the thick foam of saliva forming over his sharp, dangerous teeth. I barely noticed either of these things. In that long, terrible moment, the only thing my mind could focus on was that awful, awful smell.

“Easy Grog,” my cousin said, his voice somehow breaking through the heavy miasma that clung to the air like a plague. “Settle down, boy.”

If Groggy heard his master’s words, he had no intentions of heeding them. A few moments later he took off in a powerful sprint, barking like mad as he barreled toward the swallowing darkness. He disappeared into the gloom just as my cousin called for him to come back. Groggy continued to snarl and bark like a thing possessed until these sounds, much like his visage, were also lost to the all-consuming shadows. I would never see the poor dog again.

“Groggy!” my cousin yelled as he shot to his feet, his voice echoing through the trees. “Groggy, come back!”

Groggy didn’t come back. It was as if he had suddenly vanished off the face of the Earth. When the dog showed no signs of returning, my cousin dug into his nearby backpack and pulled from it a large flashlight. He turned on the light and began rushing after his beloved pet before my cry for him to stop caused him to pause.

“I have to go after Groggy,” he said. “I can’t leave him out there. You can stay here if you want, but I’m going.”

Knowing that I would be unable to convince my cousin of anything else, and knowing that I had no other choice, I reached into my bag and pulled out a flashlight of my own. I then squared up next to my cousin, and the two of us made our way into the trees.

I somehow knew going into our search that we would never manage to find Groggy. He was lost to us already; this much was clear to me. All I could do now was hope that my cousin would soon come to his senses, and we’d be able to return to the relative safety of our camp. Future events would eventually shatter my perception of our campsite as a bastion of security, but while wandering in that massive catacomb of trees, there was nowhere else I wanted to be than in front of our warm fire, as far away from the creeping darkness as I could have possibly gotten out in that terrible, isolated forest.

We wandered about in that swirling, black-drenched wood for what felt like an eternity or two, perilously stepping over gnarled roots and twisted bramble, barely avoiding patches of harsh, grabbing brush that would surely break an ankle of anybody foolish enough to step within its grasp. Guided by the meager glow of our flashlights, we moved slowly and methodically, both of us calling out Groggy’s name, neither receiving an answer. Snow began to fall as we walked, its gentle, floating dance only contributing to the Rorschach that was the surrounding forest. My shivering body screamed and ached for the warmth of the fire, but by then I wasn’t even sure we’d be able to find our way back to camp if we wanted to, and I feared the very real possibility that we could end up trapped in that labyrinth of a forest until dawn, or maybe even forever.

I asked my cousin to return to camp several times. Each plea was ignored. The thing that finally convinced him to turn back was when he almost went tumbling down a sudden, sharp ledge that he only managed to avoid thanks to my successful catch of his arm. This gave him the much-needed clarity that I was hoping he’d find, and we agreed that the best thing we could do for Groggy would be to rest until dawn, when we could properly search for him. We turned back in the direction that we thought the camp was in, and for several agonizing minutes, my brain was flooded by the resurfacing fear that we’d never actually make it back. Relief flooded me when I saw the gentle glow of our campfire breaking through the trees ahead of us, telling me that the salvation of our camp wasn’t too far off after all.

At the time, I was ecstatic just to be getting back to the comfort and familiarity of our camp. Looking back on it now, though, returning to that site might have been the worst mistake we could have made. If I could go back and do it over, I would gladly take wandering through the dark forest over the events that followed. Had we stayed away, my cousin could still be alive today to tell his side of this nightmarish story.

We saw the figure, silhouetted by the shadows cast by the flame, hunched in the center of our camp. Thankfully it was turned away from us, which gave us enough time to kill our flashlights before their beams managed to alert it to our presence. It had already plunged our camp into a state of disarray — our tent torn to sunders and thrown into the treeline; our hastily tossed backpacks in similar states of ruin and lying in messy heaps, where they slowly suffocated beneath a layer of fallen snow; our pile of collected logs scattered along the ground as if toppled by a bowling ball — and was cautiously making its way, crawling on all-fours, toward the boiling pot overtop the fire. It seemed wary of the campfire, but its hunger or curiosity or compulsion toward violence forced it to creep closer and closer to the scent of our cooking food.

The figure sniffed the steamy air above the pot before it gave the receptacle a cautionary tap, and upon realizing that it was safe, grabbed the pot’s cast iron lid with its massive, hairy hand and tossed it away as if it were carelessly throwing a frisbee. The lid clattered against the cold earth just as the figure thoughtlessly reached its thick manus into the boiling water and pulled out a messy ball of cooked fish in the same way someone would grab a sand dollar out of the ocean. Our guest greedily shoved the ball of fish into its mouth, and evidently liking what it tasted, went back for more, snorting and slobbering as it quickly devoured handful after handful of what was meant to be our dinner. It accidentally knocked the suspended pot to the ground, spilling its contents onto the cold earth, but this only encouraged the thing to scoop up the remaining food with both hands, swallowing it back eagerly along with any dirt and grass and rocks that it happened to grab along with its intended meal.

My flesh felt as cold as the wintry air all around us as we watched this hellish scene unfold. For a while I thought I had forgotten how to move, but eventually I managed to turn my head enough to share a glance with my cousin, who looked to be about as terrified as I felt. He gestured back into the woods with his head. I nodded, and together we began slowly backing away from the creature that was enjoying its dinner in the center of our camp.

We might have actually gotten away unnoticed, too, had my cousin’s blood sugar alert not gone off.

The shrill, echoing sound of my cousin’s phone caused the creature hunched in the clearing to rise to its full, gargantuan height, its body twisting in our direction at an absurd speed. The beast’s furious eyes glowed bronze in the moonlight, and glared at us with a threat of malice the likes of which I had never seen before, and have not witnessed since. Its sharp maw, filthy with the hanging flesh of fish, transformed into a snarling mess of gnashing teeth and seething hate.

And with a huge, bounding step, it began to close the space between us.

My cousin, throwing his screaming phone into the treeline, yelled for me to run, but his words came as I was already well into my own sprint into the waiting wood. Together we rushed out of the clearing and into the gloom of the forest, our newly alive flashlights flailing wildly in our grips, doing very little to guide us through the imposing darkness. To this day I have no idea how I managed to avoid getting snagged by an upturned root or smacked in the face by a low-hanging branch. I didn’t think of these potential hazards at the time; all I could focus on was my burning lungs, my screaming legs, and the terror that kept me moving in spite of them.

I didn’t notice my cousin falling behind. He had always been the more athletic between the two of us, so it didn’t occur to me that he would ever be the one to tire out first. I had forgotten all about his rapidly dropping glucose levels, my mind lost in my desperate flight from the danger that chased us in the form of that massive, hulking beast that I could hear growling and snorting and howling behind us.

I was able to steady my flashlight’s beam long enough to notice the hollow in the tree only a few yards away. It promised safety, protection, a place to hide, and in my desperation and panic, I sprinted toward it with all the speed that I could possibly muster. I slid through the welcoming threshold of the hollow like a baseball player just barely reaching home plate, then turned around to look for my cousin. I expected him to be right behind me, and when I saw just how far back he was, my stomach transformed into a series of knots that I’m not sure I’ve ever managed to fully untie. I didn’t dare to leave the safety of my new sanctuary in order to go help him. Part of me regrets this decision, but the other part of me knows that had I tried, I likely would have shared in his fate.

Maybe that would have been for the best.

He was barely two yards from the hollow, and would have made it in a matter of seconds had he not fallen. I don’t know if his body gave out due to plummeting blood sugar or if he merely tumbled over something in his path, but either way, the result was the same. He went down. And he would never get back up.

My cousin’s flashlight spun like a twirling figure skater as it fell from his grip. It landed so that its beam was facing him, giving me plenty of light by which to see him in his final moments. He spotted me in the hollow, our gazes meeting for those brief few moments that he had left. I could see the terror in his eyes, residing in a home that would soon be abandoned, where shortly would live nothing at all.

And then the beast was upon him.

It is here that I must confess to the slight inaccuracy of this post’s title. To tell the truth, I never actually saw the extent of what happened to my cousin. I only watched a brief moment of the carnage before I retreated deeper into the hollow, but in that moment I saw enough horror to last me for the rest of my life. I remember thinking just how easily my cousin’s body was relieved of his arm, as if he were made of freshly molded clay. Pressing my back against the arboreal wall of the hollow, I shut off my flashlight and closed my eyes as tightly as I could. I wanted to cover my ears, but I didn’t. I figured I owed my cousin that much at least.

I sat there, in my hollowed out tree, in my own world, listening until the screaming and the growling and the tearing all stopped. And then I sat there for longer. I sat there shivering with equal parts terror and cold, hoping that the beast was gone, and that it couldn’t hear me, or smell me, or somehow see me through that wall of bark. I stayed there, refusing to move or think, barely breathing, until the stench of that horrible creature slowly faded away, and all that remained in the air was the foul smell of iron. Only with the coming of dawn and the return of chirping birds did I finally muster the courage to depart from my hollow.

Dark blood painted the snow and brush where my cousin had fallen, but his body was nowhere to be seen. Not even his torn off arm remained, though bits of leftover gore lay sprinkled all about the surrounding surfaces of the forest like spent confetti. A trail of blood and disrupted foliage created a path leading away from the hollow, disappearing into the trees. I turned and went in the opposite direction.

Thankfully my route was the correct one, eventually leading me back to familiar territory. From there, it was only a short distance back to the ruins of our camp. The fire was reduced to dead cinders, the pit coated in new snow. As I stepped closer to the vestige of the campfire, I noticed several massive impressions in the earth which acted as basins for the previous night’s precipitation. I didn’t need to draw very close to them in order to see just how much bigger those impressions were than my own feet.

I made my way to my cousin’s tattered backpack, praying that he had put his car keys in it the day before. Much to my dismay, I couldn’t find them in any of the bag’s pockets. Panic began to grow in me as pocket after pocket turned out to be devoid of the keys, but this strengthening tension broke when I noticed something shimmering on the ground near the bag, and found the keys half-buried in the snow. Scooping them up, I headed in the direction of the trail that would eventually lead me back to my cousin’s car. I didn’t offer the campsite another glance as I left. Even at the time, I knew that I would never see it again.

The walk back to my cousin’s car was long and cold. Without my cousin and Groggy to keep me company, it was an incredibly lonely journey. I wished Groggy was there to chase a squirrel or chipmunk into the brush. I wished my cousin was there to stop and check his glucose levels after his alert went off. The isolation of it all was suffocating, almost overwhelming; I had to continuously fight the urge to lie down in the snow and close my eyes, praying that I never opened them again, knowing that I probably would. When I reached my cousin’s car, I took a few minutes to wipe the coating of snow away from the vehicle before I climbed in, adjusted the seat, and attempted to bring the thing to life. It wouldn’t turn over at first, and I feared that the cold had sapped it of its battery, but a few seconds of persistence saw the tired engine come grumbling awake. After sitting in the vehicle’s heat for a bit in order to allow my frigid body some time to defrost, I threw the car into drive and made my way down the mountain, silently saying goodbye to that old, familiar trail for the last time as I went. I drove for a few miles until finally getting a signal on my phone, which I used to hastily dial 9-1-1. The sound of another person’s voice caused me to immediately break down into bitter, sobbing tears.

It took them days to find my cousin’s body, but they eventually discovered what remained of it near the riverbed, lying sprawled beneath a tree. The only way they were able to identify him was by syncing his phone, which they had found well before locating his corpse, with the glucose monitor embedded into his still-attached arm. I guess I’m thankful the beast chose to spare that single limb; it made his recovery just a little bit easier.

My cousin was ruled to have been killed by an especially vicious bear. A grizzly was found sleeping in a den near his corpse, and was promptly terminated before it could wake up. The bear’s demise brought the rest of my cousin’s family and friends some sort of peace, but it did nothing for me, because I know the truth. I know that poor bear was unjustly blamed for my cousin’s death, but I have no choice but to go along with the lie. I’m forced to pretend that what I saw that night was a hungry grizzly, and not what I truly know it to be.

Let me end this by saying that I’m sorry I ever doubted you, Sasquatch. I know what it means to fear you now. I’ll know it every time I see a goofy, hairy character on a bumper sticker or watch a humorous beef jerky commercial on TV. I’ll know it when I’m out at night taking the trash to the dumpster and I suddenly see a figure that looks like it’s watching me from the nearby treeline, or when I smell a horrible stench wafting on the air that is far too familiar. That fear, that unrivaled terror, will live with me forever, waiting just beyond my reach until those few and far between moments that it comes crashing to the forefront, and I’m reminded of what I saw and heard and smelled and experienced that night.

And if I’m lucky, it will only ever be a small fraction of the fear that my cousin felt in those last few moments of his life.
