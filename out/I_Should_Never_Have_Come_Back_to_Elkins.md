They buried Tom on a Thursday. It was raining. Of course it was.

Elkins was always gray in my memory, a town that never seemed to dry out. The air felt wet just breathing it, like mildew had soaked into the bones of everything—houses, trees, people. I hadn’t been back in over eight years, not since I left for college and then… just never returned. There wasn’t much to come back to.

Tom had stayed. The last of our little group still clinging to this rotting place.

I didn’t even know he was dead until my brother called me.

“You should come,” Marcus had said. His voice didn’t sound like I remembered—less aggressive, more… hollow. “They’re saying he hanged himself. But something’s wrong.”

Those words stayed with me.

Something’s wrong.

So I drove back to Elkins, through the fog-wrapped roads and pine forests that had always made the town feel tucked away from the rest of the world. When I arrived, everything looked the same—but off. The trees leaned too far over the roads. Some houses had windows painted black. No birds. No wind.

I stayed at Marcus’s place—our childhood home. He lived alone now, ever since Dad died and Mom left.

“You look like shit,” he told me when I walked in.

“Thanks,” I said. “Still brutally honest.”

He didn’t laugh. Just gave me a look.




Tom’s funeral was quiet. Barely a dozen people. His mother didn’t cry. She just stared forward like she wasn’t really there. A few people said kind things, but none of it felt real.

The weirdest part was what they buried.

The casket was closed, sealed shut. When I asked Marcus why, he looked at me like I’d said something dangerous.

“They said the body… wasn’t in a state to be seen.”

That was bullshit. Tom was young, healthy. He wasn’t a druggie, he didn’t drink. He wouldn’t hang himself. Something didn’t fit.

Back at Marcus’s house that night, I found myself staring out the window at the woods behind our backyard. They used to be our playground as kids. We built forts, played hide and seek, made up monsters to scare each other.

I saw something move out there.

Not a person. Not an animal. Just—movement.

It was the way the trees shifted. Like they breathed.






On the second night, I found the tape.

It was in Tom’s handwriting, slipped under my bedroom door. I hadn’t brought it—Marcus swore he hadn’t either. The label just said: “For you. If I go.”

I didn’t recognize the handwriting at first. It was shaky, panicked. Not like Tom.

Marcus still had an old VHS player in the basement. We watched it together.

The footage was rough—handheld, shaky. Tom was filming himself in his bedroom, whispering.

 “Something’s wrong here. I can’t sleep. The dreams are spreading. The other night I woke up outside, just standing in the woods… like I’d been called.”



“People are changing. Not just forgetting things—rewriting them. I asked Mike if he remembered Sarah Thompson from high school and he looked at me like I was insane. She was his girlfriend for two years.”



“I found something in the woods. It’s not… I can’t explain it. But I think it sees me. I think it knows my name.”



At the end of the tape, Tom whispered something into the camera:

> “If you’re watching this, it’s already too late for me. Maybe for you too. Don’t follow the lights. Don’t go beneath. There’s no coming back from beneath.”



Then it cut to static.

I didn’t sleep that night.




The next day, I went to find where Tom filmed. I remembered his place, walked the woods behind his house until I found a clearing.

That’s when I saw it.

A hole in the earth, perfectly round. Maybe ten feet across. No debris, no dirt piles. Just a gaping black pit.

I threw a rock in. No sound. No bottom.

Something in me screamed to run, but I stood there, frozen.

Then I heard it.

A voice.

Not loud, not sharp. Gentle. Calm.

 “Come see.”



It wasn’t Tom’s voice. It wasn’t anyone’s. It was like a thought spoken by the air itself.

I ran.


Marcus was waiting for me when I got back.

“You went to the woods,” he said.

I didn’t answer.

He stepped closer. “You saw it.”

His eyes looked wrong.

“I thought maybe you wouldn’t. Maybe you’d leave before it got into you. But it’s too late now.”

“What the hell is going on?” I shouted. “What the fuck is that hole?”

He smiled. Not like my brother. Like something wearing his skin.

“It’s not a hole. It’s a mouth. And you’ve already heard it speak.”

Then he lunged.


When they find this, if they ever do, know this:

The town isn’t real anymore.

The people aren’t people.

The roads don’t go where they should.

And the hole isn’t a hole.

It ate Tom. It’s eating Marcus.

It knows me now.

I hear it in the walls, in my bones, in the space between each heartbeat.

“Come see.”



I think I will.

I think I don’t have a choice.

There’s no coming back from beneath.

And if you’re reading this…
you’re next.
