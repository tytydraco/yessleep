

Winter in new York is a grey, wet, diesel reeking slog. 4 months of walking through snowstorms or cramming into packed subway cars that havn't figured out how to not smell like piss in 80 years. 

I chose the former, trying to pull my black suit jacket tighter to stave off the cold as I made my way to the squat, dilapidated VFW building. 

We buried Eli earlier that day, small service, mostly old military friends, ( both literally and figuratively.) myself, and  the ancient Rabbi.

But this was where the real memorial was going to happen. 

I see some familiar faces, mostly folks I've crossed paths with during the course of my career or people that knew Eli long before me,. Back when he wasn't my best friend , but a top level medic patching up folks wounded on the type of special ops that the fate of the world hinges on. 

I see a familiar face, at one point in time the two of us were out for each other's heads. A rivalry that left me with half of my teeth as broken splinters, and her with a left pupil that never contracted, just to name the highlights.

But the only constant in life is change, over my 10 year career her, and her superiors have came to a strained kind of peace with Eli and myself. Out of all of the flamboyant psychos she works with, I actually respect her. 

She's six and a half feet of bulk, built like a wrestler, her hair is short and black, sunglasses cover her eyes despite the grey gloom of the November afternoon. The long brown trench coat she wears flaps in the wind as she struggles to light a cigarette. 

She notices me walk up, but not lift the pack of Marlboro Red's from her coat pocket, i take one, offering her her own cigarettes back with a smirk. 

She curtly takes the pack, shaking her head, and in a moment of anger, throws her useless plastic lighter across the street. My zippo has less trouble, i light her cigarette, then mine as we stand there, silently. 

It's not uncomfortable, just the easy interaction of two people who are closer than friends, or lovers. Two people who have had each other's lives in their hands, time and time again, and never decided to close their fist.

"He was a good man Mike, crazy, but a good guy." Sam says, taking a long drag snowflakes making the tobacco sizzle and pop. 

"Thanks." I say, taking a shuddering breath. 

I've been crying in fits and starts all day, small, periodic breakdowns that never seem to put a dent in the tide of depression and rage that followed Eli's death. But i compose myself, stinging tears begining to well in my eyes. 

"How are you taking it?" She asks, her tone level, but her concern evident. 

"You mean, personally, or professionally?" I say, unintentionally sounding accusatory. 

"Both, I guess. Not asking on the record, just asking." Sam lights another ciragette from the butt of the first before throwing it away. How she manages to wear a 200 pound suit of kevlar and strike plate in the field like it's cosplay gear, while puffing these coffin nails, i don't understand. 

" I'm gutted, i jumped right the hell off the wagon, been on a 3 day bender, and I'm probably not going to stop until my puke is more blood than food. 

If it wouldn't be spitting on what we were doing, I probably wouldn't be around any more to tell the truth. The guy survived the actual Nazis, all the crazy shit him and I did, not to mention everything in between, to be killed by what? A fucking blood clot. " I shake my head, trying to stop the  free flowing tears," And as far as professionally? I should probably just pack it in. 

It's been ten years, and I'm running on fumes, not just mentally either. If I listed you everything wrong with me, it'd sound like I was doing an old George Burns bit." 

"But it's not like you go around immolating gang leaders and Jason Voorhees'ing violent Cults much anymore is it? That's why we like you, Mike, your reputation stops more violence than you committ. 

You're sad, so am I, Eli was a legend, and you were closer to him than just about anyone. But life goes on, and you and I both know you are not going to move to Idaho and go back to being a birthday clown. 

Finish your bender, puke your blood, and get your shit together, please. " her last sentence was spoken with more care and understanding than i could hope to convey with just words. She throws her second smoke away, walking into the building, i work up the courage to do the same a few minutes later, sitting at the back of the low ceilinged, wood-panelled meeting hall/bar as friends and fellow soldiers take it in turns to share old war stories, anecdotes and anything else they could think of relating to Eli. 

I stayed silent, after all, what could I add to the conversation? The things the old man and I got up to were not exactly meant to be shared with a crowd. 

The speeches stop and the drinking starts, i feel more in my element as the booze starts to flow and those around me without a deep seated alcoholism start to get hammered. 

As afternoon turns to evening the crowd thins, i try and leave, but just can't bring myself to do it. As stupid as it sounds, it feels like I'm walking away from Eli himself. 

So I sit in the decades old folding chair, deep in my mind, my choices, both future and pastâ€¦.

"So here he is, the homo that's been taking advantage of my dad for ten years." the voice is like gravel, i know who it is only by description, Eli's son. The Cliff's Notes? The guy is a piece of shit, as evidenced by him showing up hours late to his own father's funeral. 

I don't want trouble, I stand, the little prick can't be more than 5'7, a full head shorter than myself, with faded meth scars and not so faded gin blossoms dotting his nose. 

Not that i have any right to judge the last part. 

"I was just leaving Steve, but for the record, you are extremely wrong about me and your dad." I say, trying to get past the scrawny addict.

Of course he isn't smart enough to just let me. 

" I don't think I am actually, what other reason would a 30 something year old be spending all his time around some old guy? Always thought the old man was bent, so no surprise. 

But the way I see things, is you got a lot of shit coming to you that is mine by right. I'm his son, not you, you Marlyn Manson looking, lurch shaped piece of shit. " Steve smiles up at me, and i think of how easy it would be to snap his spine over the back of one of these chairs. 

I keep my voice low, and calm," Steve, what I 'get' is to clean out my dead best friends apartment, because you are his only family, and clearly are incapable of putting down the syringe long enough to move a box or pick up a broom. 

I don't care if this is guilt at being a hemmerhoid on society for your entire life, or just a cash grab, but I'm not playing. " 

I try to walk forward, push by the scum bag, but i feel a small prick in my stomach. He's  holding an oversized folding knife, low and discreet, his black toothed smile spreading. 

Quicker than he can react I grab his right hand in my left, releasing the lock on the cheap gas station knife, my right clamps down on the blade, catching his fingers between it and the handle. 

"Shhhh" I whisper" if you make a sound you lose the fingers", i squeeze the blade until I feel bone, to underline my point. 

Blood pours down his hand all but invisible in our corner of the dimly lit room. 

"I'm going to let go in a couple of seconds. Then, you're going to stick your had in your pocket, walk outside and take a cab to the hospital. 

If you do anything else, if you so much as stop to sneeze, i'will have you out of this building before anyone notices, and I'll leave you bleeding to death in an alley. " i keep my eye's locked to the bloodshot orbs of the addict, i take the knife, and for the briefest of seconds I see a flicker of defiance run through the man's eyes. 

But he's smarter than he looks, and  follows my request to the letter. 

I left the wake a few minutes later, and find myself standing in Eli's apartment, half a buzz on, and the other half sitting on his tattered couch in the form of 6 40 oz bottles of Grey Snow malt liquor. 

At first glance the place is a nightmarish horder's den. Boxes of erata stacked to the ceiling, every available surface holding some cup, knick knack or half repaired electronic, but all of this is just a facade, just something to throw off anyone that might want to start sniffing around, police, or otherwise. 

But the place, really, is half armory half evidence locker. Organized via cypher, anything we felt we could use that we came across was here somewhere hidden among hundreds of warped records and fake dead cats.  

At this point, you've probably asked yourself what the hell is it that I actually do. Let me clear that up as best I can. 

If I'm being unbiased, there are 2 answers to this question. 

The first, is that I'm a lunatic who slapped together an absurd moral arguement to take out his worst desires on other people. Then weaved a web of delusion around himself involving secret government agencies, serial killers, and a war vet.  

Now, the second answer, is the one I'd prefer you to believe. And the one I tell myself every day is the truth. 

I'm a guy who broke one day after seeing evidence of the worst type of crime. Who went to go out in a blaze of glory, ridding the world of one vile man, and ended up failing upwards, turning a handful of brutal, if deserved acts, into an urban legend who sits in the back of the minds of the worst people out there, making them question just how much of a reputation they can amass before coming face to face with me. 

There's more to it than that, of course, but that's a whole other story. 

The first part of the night goes quickly, getting rid of all the general crap Eli had amassed over the years. Just general old man junk, magazines from the 80's, expired canned food, medications he really should have been taking, nothing that required any thought to sort through. 

So I drank, my mind wandering, my legs stumbling and my eyes crying as I dropped boxes of useless crap down the rusted garbage chute in the hallway. 

When the last faded playboy and ball of rubber bands had been thrown away I was left with the real task ahead of me. The decade worth of what police would likely call "Evidence of serial murder.". 

I'm dismantling a massive custom handgun using a cold welder and a hacksaw, when I'm hit with everything all at once. 

I remember us laughing at how useless the thing was, the man wielding it was a bloodthirsty leader of a half gang half cult, but this tacticool nightmare was so impractical he didn't land a shot within 5 feet of me as I calmly sauntered up to him, and and stove in his skull with a lead cored lucite walking stick. 

And that one brutal, stupid memory starts a flood of every negative emotion that has been brewing inside of me since I found his body, still in an armchair, taped re run of All in the Family still playing on the television. 

I feel disconnected, surreal, i rock and shake, swearing, crying and raging at nothing in particular besides the series of bad luck and decisions that lead to this point. 

Way in the back of my mind, I hear it, the voice, one of 2 actually. Whispering to me. 

Mental health is at least as important as physical health when you spend your life doing shit that no decent person wants to do. That's why a handful of psych meds are as much a part of my equipment as any gun, knife, disguise or first aid item. 

But ever since I gave up making people laugh and devoted my life to trying to make people safe there have been  2 little voices that no amount of abilify or Seroquel can touch. I call them Norman and the Boyscout. They don't talk to me, so much as I find my brain tuning into them from time to time. Personally, I think they are real people, out there somewhere, but I'm well aware that most scitzophrenics would say the same. 

Norman, he's a dark scary  piece of work. He knows how to stalk, lie, and feel like a million bucks while doing it. 

The Boyscout, he might be crazier than I am. He talks like a golden age comics character meets a brain injury victim. But everything about combat i didn't learn from Eli, i learned from him. 

I drown out Norman with more of the vaguely skunky tasting beer, and force myself to keep plugging away at the apartment. 

Every item brings up a new memory, but one stands out among the rest. It's simple, an old cracked blackberry phone. It belonged to Doctor Alfred Grochowski, a man who I made sure never made it into any top ten serial killer lists. The bastard had a body count more like a disease than a man. 

But originally, it wasn't him I was after. 

The media called him the "Eighth Street Ogre.", stupid name for an average sized guy with almost no discernable features. His M. O was to find an isolated 24/7 party store, kill the clerk, steal the person's uniform, then proceede to brutalize a handful of customers through the course of the night before disappearing. 

No video, only the odd witness from across a street, or deep in an alley. The exact type of scenario Eli and I loved to get involved in. 

After weeks of dead ends and bad leads, either luck or skill lead to us finding the ogre, though not before he had decapitated the lone clerk in the comcally small bodega.And true to reports, he wasn't anyone obviously dangerous. 

Short, with a wavy mop of dark hair obscuring his eyes, the only feature that stood out was his waxy almost feverish skin. 

the store had 3 customer's jammed into it, likely violating a handful of fire codes. The rusted bell rings as i bring that number to four. 

The orgre notices me, I notice the mangled body behind the counter. 

Remember Sam talking about me being a birthday clown before? Well, she was being an asshole, but not totally off. Before all of this, I was a professional, registered, facepaint on an egg in Paris, clown. And to answer your question, yes the job prospects for that are exactly what you would assume, but it did leave me with a few skills. 

One of which was the uniform I was wearing. A black and red tramps outfit, hanging off of my lanky form. It breaks every rule of the art of clowning, and is an eye straining disaster, just subtle enough to walk the streets in, just distracting enough to make someone wonder how much of a threat I could really be? 

I hold the walking stick, 5 pounds of giveless lucite, and point it at the dead eyed man. 

" We need to go outside and have a little..." i stop mid sentence, jaw just about hanging, the guy is half way across the tiny store before I register he moved. 

I havn't even taken a step before he tackles a 50 year old man into a glass fronteted beer fridge. In an instant the floor is flooded with razor sharp shards and foaming liquid. 

The other two patrons, a tall rough looking guy who I would have assumed was the scary one in the store and a young, drunk looking woman stare at the scene, immobile. 

The ogre bludgeons, tears and slams his victim, never once pausing to pick up a weapon, or Adress any of the massive, yet barely bleeding cuts on his own body. I've seen every kind of killer, professional, talented amateur, rage, and every other color of the worthless psycho rainbow. But never someone who can turn a person into a mangled lump of flesh In a matter of minutes, using nothing but his bare hands. 

The killer is silent, turning on me, and i wish i had came in with more than a stick and a knife. Walking around armed is risky, and i thought i was going to be dealing with some guy with sedatives and a lead pipe not... Whatever the hell the demon in front of me is. 

The ogre lunges, i swing with the cane, demolishing his jaw, splitting it into a flapping, almost insect like looking mandible. 

This should have killed the man, and if by some miracle that didn't happen, it should have turned his lights out in an instant, Ir left him bleeding to death from his face. 

Drops of thick red blood slowly fall from the wound, but the dead eyed rage of the ogre doesn't skip a beat, he throws aside a cheap stell rack, stomping toward rough looking man. 

Finally the two sheep tune into their situation and start to scramble out of the store, i run at the ogre trying to grab him, take him to the ground, i'm met with the stiffest elbow I've ever experienced directly between my eyes. 

I'm on the ground dazed, and before I can shake the black spots from my vision he's on top of me. 

Every blow feels like a cinder block, he wrenches my shoulder out of socket, i manage to draw my knife for all of about 2 seconds before he sends it flying across the store. 

Sound goes dim, one of my eyes is swollen shut, and it's all I can do to put up one arm and try and gouge, tear and poke my way free of death. 

None of this makes sense, the human body doesn't work like this, i see no technology, or even clever weapons on the guy. What i do see is no less than three wounds that should have killed him long before he started taking me apart. 

I hear 4 loud pops, and feel blood hot enough to sald splash across my face. The ogre's chest sports 4 ragged, quarter sized wounds. Bad grouping, cheap ammo by the sounds of it, not Eli. 

Finally the invincible bastard seems to notice a wound, getting to his feet, and stumbling almost drunkenly out of the store. The girl is gone, but i see the pig eyed, man standing, shaking, holding a pawn shop pistol and likely on the verge of a heart attack. 

Eli copies and erases the security footage, the man wanted nothing to do with the cops, and i spend my time recuperating assuming that whoever the ogre was, he died a slow death after whatever the hell was on wore off. Bad grouping or not, four shots through the chest after everything else is three stooges leaves of body trauma. 

My shoulder hadn't even stopped clicking before we began to see similar police reports and news segments. 

And sure enough, a few weeks later I found myself staring and the same short, waxen, man, crimson stained hands pretending to sort lottery tickets. 

This time I was wearing nothing more attention grabbing than a pair of blue jeans and a large hooded parka. The night was clear and I was hidden well, watching this human pipe bomb get ready to do his thing. 

Sorry if it seems cold to watch someone murder a handful of people in a knock off 7-11, but in the real world, there are things you can fix and things you leave the hell alone. This situation was rapidly approaching 'leave the hell alone status'. Usually when this kind of thing happens Sam gives us a call, and at least a bit of reasoning, and we leave it alone. But neither her, nor anyone she had favors to call in from knew anything about the ogre. 

Without the distraction of me trying and  failing to put a stop to his rampage, the hunched, animalistic little man tore his victims apart at his leisure. 

Long after he stalked off into the night, i made my way into the store, the bent steel, shattered wood, limbs torn from bodies, my first thought would be some kind of explosive, but i watched, as this place was nearly leveled, blow by blow, scream by scream. 

So, that night Eli and I had ' The Talk'. 

Eli, at one point was the type of guy who, when something was 'need to know', needed to know. He'd read the X-Files, and kept going to Y and Z, if you get what I'm saying. 

But this, was the moment we both knew could happen, even if all evidence pointed toward it being bulls hit. The moment we find something actually paranormal. 

Sounds stupid, i know, but when the evidence is dripping from the walls, things get a little hard to ignore. 

So instead of hooking up with some scary guys selling  scary guns, or maybe calling in a few friends in low places to even the odds I spent a month dealing with the most shit stuffed assholes on the face of the earth. 

Psychics, cryptozoologists, ghost hunters, occultists, every word out of their mouths made my brain revolt, and every penny I gave them for their time made my soul cry, I knew even if I found one that got me on the other right track the other hundred were still con artists and horrible human beings. 

I was convinced this had to be a vampire, nothing else really made sense, not that any option in the Woo Woo rainbow did, but this felt like the cleanest end of the turd to grab. 

Eli was, ironically more of the mind this was a real urban legend, not some guy like me, using overactive imaginations to create a paper tiger, but some blight on the city, and spent his time trying to sort through creepypasta and psychotic ramblings. 

The last time i was face to face with the ogre was in a massive, overnight grocery store, victims were plentiful, homeless folks looking for a warm place to be, shift workers getting frozen food, and all the other assorted misfits who frequent vendors in the wee hours of the morning. 

He was pushing a mop, haphazardly across the canned food isle, but i watched him as he stared at his prey, his body twitching in anticipation of violence and bloodshed. 

I'm wearing a leather jacket thick enough to stop a bullet, and while I could be just another face in the crowd, every stitch of clothing I wear is reenforced, or holding one of the handful of occult 'weapons' I brought with me. 

I'm almost disapointed when he doesn't seem to recognise me, giving me no more of a look than any of the victims milling about the store. 

My hand untwists the vial of the bottle of holy water, i stopper it with my thumb as I close the distance between us. I'm close enough to smeel an ammonia reek coming off of him, like urine and sweat in competing excess amounts, as I pull the bottle from my pocket, splashing it in the creatures face. 

He recoils, stumbling backward, and i smile as I realise this fight is going to go a lot different than the first. 

I shouldn't have smiled. 

He was shocked, and stumbled backward, wiping at his face, because, well, that's what anyone would do when someone splashes an unknown liquid in their eyes. 

No smoke, no hissing, no half melted walking corpse, just a wet, angry man shaped thing holding a broken mop handle like a dagger. 

Can you guess what effect the silver bullets had? 

Anyone think garlic worked? 

And for extra credit, who can answer if a cross did anything to even slow the ogre? 

Anyone who the questions positively has not been paying attention. 

It was the worst beating I had taken, and handed to me by a guy using nothing more dangerous than his own flesh bare hands. To add insult to injury, he casually extinguished life after life as he did it. 

Thrown ten feet through a  plate glass window, saved only by the tattered remains of leather and steel from my outfit, i crawl through the parking lot. I roll onto my back, watching the oger walk through the window, heedless of the shards of glass tearing strip from his legs. 

I can't do anything but try and breathe as the creature walks over to me, pausing a moment to take in the broken man below him. 

I don't close my eyes, i want to see what fate this thing has in store for me. Eli has to be watching, maybe whatever it does  will give him some kind of clue as to how to take it out. 

I take what I assume is going to be my last breath as the Ogre falls upon me, but before I feel those steel fingers tearing into me half of the things head evaporates, I honestly expect the wound to repair itself, of the Ogre to keep going, heedless of the wound, but he drops, lifelessly as I'm sprayed with what used to be his grey matter. 

I look in the direction of the gunshot, and there stands Eli, holding the largest handgun I've seen to date. On the ground below him, is a tall man in his mid 50's who would be photogenic if not for the severe facial bruising somehow caused by my octogenarian partner. 

Dr. Grochowski, not that I knew that at the time. 

He fixes me with a cold stare that tells me that if there wasn't the barrel of an elephant pistol aimed at his head, he wouldn't be going quietly. 

He should have taken the chance Eli was as blind as he looks. 

We took him to a warehouse Eli rents, worst lot in the worst block in the city. But the soundproof room worked for times when we needed to ask questions people didn't want to answer. 

The good doctor didn't start talking until a week in, long past the point of pulling fingernails and keeping him up for days. It wasn't until I started in on his hands that he finally opened his corpse like lips. 

In a world that wasn't hell bent on being a tragic joke, Dr. G would have been the kind of guy to cure cancer, or invent an artificial heart. But instead this once in a century genius saw that as below him. 

The good Doctor wanted to make monsters. 

But after decades of trial and error, he found something medical science won't fully understand fot another 50 years or so. 

The exact limits of the human body. 

This depressed the lovecraft hero wannabe as he realised his dreams of an army of uber mensch were not, nor ever could be attained. Monsters don't exist and they certainly can't be made. 

So he set his sites lower, if he couldn't create monsters, he wanted to create a legend. 

When we found the old farmhouse he had been using to store and mutilate his victims, that's when i stopped feeling bad for taking pieces of the man. Human beings, packed together, dead from starvation and exposure, treated with no more concern than a forgotten jar of tadpoles. 

I wasn't fighting a single bullet proof, steel muscled monster. 

Each ogre was a victim, made identical to the last by what may be the most skilled surgeon on earth, and pumped full of a cocktail of drugs that are a guarented death spent in a lobotomised haze, 

He promised them freedom for a set amount of kills in the store, giving their slowly shutting down brain one goal to focus on till strokes, broken bones and incidental trauma left them as much a mangled corpse as their victims. 

He seemed so proud to say he "cracked the twenty minute mark", in regards to survival time. I don't like to think of myself as someone who likes the violence I have to commit, but I took the man's eye for that remark. 

We whittled that man down to a sightless torso to gain every bit of medical knowledge inside that twisted mind of his. I lost a bit of my soul doing what I did to him, but what we learned was a true torch in the darkness, showed us we didn't live in a world of monsters, the universe is ran by logic and reason, easy to understand once you know the rules. 

I box the last of the useful items, and turn the last grenade into unidentifiable scrap. I grab a box to go back to my apartment, files, and a few dubiously useful firearms and explosives. And think of how two grown men, well versed in just how surreal the world can be still went full medieval peasent the second their worldview was questioned. 

And questioning your worldview is where this story truly starts kids. 

What, you thought this was going to be a story about a group of cut rate superheroes bonding over tragedy and saving the world one last time? 

Fuck no. 

First, as a story, that one has been told to death. 

Second, as an event, it doesn't usually go that way. Tragedy, more often than not, is a wedge that gives people the excuse to part, versus the kind of relationship superglue media would have you believe. 

No, I'm no hero, and I sure as hell am in no way super. 

This story starts as that door closes behind me, and I notice I'm standing in a building that I've never seen, wearing clothes I've never owned, and holding not a box of of disturbing facts and violence, but a bag of groceries, and a set of keys. 

My story starts in a city that calls itself New York, but bears little resemblance to the metropolis I've spent my life in. In a place that's two steps off of normal, streets with different names, landmarks with different histories, a place with plenty of dark corners containing things i couldn't dream of, a place of dangerous whispers and, Hollow Promises.
