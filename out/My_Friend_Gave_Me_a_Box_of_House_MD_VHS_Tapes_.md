I know that my hobby is pretty odd. I like to go to thrift stores and find old film, SD cards, DVDs and VHS tapes, and convert them to MP4 so I can watch them, and dig through the dirt to find the gold worthy of selling. Most of the time, it's useless footage: old wedding videos and photos, or selfies and kid's birthday parties that have nothing interesting to contribute to online archives, or archivists who are looking for new, first-person POV's of historical events. Hell, I've seen more homemade sex tapes than anything of any worth, and my God, does it turn you off the idea of growing old with someone. But hey, people are perverts, and I guess I'm no better; buying tapes and viewing them like some 'voyeur.'



I suppose I should just admit that fact—I am a voyeur. It's not like I get my rocks off to the stuff people film, but I do spend an unusual amount of time watching snippets of stranger's lives. It seemed like it was quick and easy money, at first; secret archives that might strike gold at any moment. But it soon became an itch I needed to scratch, an overwhelming curiosity that needed to be quenched. Finishing the conversion and watching a batch of old, donated footage didn't satiate me for long. I found myself frequenting local thrift stores and donation points in search of new, unwatched content. At my lowest, I travelled for an hour and a half on the subway to a joint that a subreddit said was good for those with my hobby. I know I'm no better than them, the people who have… 'fetishistic' tendencies for the footage they find, but I assure you that my curiosity is fuelled by a more morbid desire. The desire to find something new and unveil to the public a POV of tragedies so well known, yet not from that particular perspective. 



It started when I came across an SD card in an old Canon Camera after a week or so of 'dumpster diving' for footage. After converting the footage to MP4 on my computer, I scoured through endless videos of crappy student films and drunken evenings. Until I found a video of the student and his friends in a dive bar, with the New England Strangler sitting behind them. I frantically searched the internet, trying to find if anyone had ever uploaded the footage online before me--if news stations already had their hands on it. They hadn't. 



I sent the video to the police in case they needed anything to close up any leads that were left open. I received a brief 'thanks' in response, but that was enough to send me on my downward spiral. I became obsessed with the idea of finding the next biggest thing; the next story that could contribute to the betterment of society. But, alas, things slowed down soon after. I guess that's how gambling gets you, in that same, alluring manner. I spent my money on mostly pointless footage hoping I'd find something good again—worthy of finding. And just as gambling seems to hook you back in when you're about to give up, as did the footage I'd find. Nothing too crazy, but things like missing people in the backgrounds of photos (despite them being taken prior to their disappearance), or videos of drug deals taken with the intent to brag, only for me to find them. It was enough to drag me back; feed my hunger just enough not to satiate me, but delude me into thinking it was worthwhile. 



Like I said before, there's a bit of a community of like-minded individuals out there. I met a guy, Gerald, through a friend of a friend. He said he wasn't a complete pervert, but definitely had way too big of a collection of homemade sex tapes for me to believe him. He had some interesting stuff, however, and over the past few months, he'd become somewhat of a mentor to me, telling me where the best finds usually were and what sorts of labels I should be looking for. Apparently, most tapes labelled "X's first birthday," are usually taped over with footage of video will's.



Pretty morbid, huh?



This morning, Gerald came to my apartment. He'd been acting strangely on the phone, saying I couldn't come visit for our weekly meetup. He'd insisted on coming to me instead, something to do with him feeling paranoid at his home. I accepted, but I wasn't necessarily completely surprised—I'm sure anyone with that many random sex tapes of couples he never knew would be pretty suspicious to law enforcement, or anyone else visiting the home, for that matter. 



He turned up, dishevelled. I mean, it wasn't like he looked great normally, being a basement dweller by day, and janitor at a gym by night. But he looked really, really rough. He looked greasy, and he wasn't necessarily unclean despite what I've mentioned already. His home was neat and tidy, but filled with bizarre paraphernalia of Polish films I've never seen, and the aforementioned tapes. His skin seemed yellow, a strange, sickly tint that reddened his eyes and darkened the UV-damaged wrinkles on his face. The vein on his thick neck bulged out more than usual, and he averted his eyes from my own, never looking up at me with the same familiarity that he usually did. He handed me a box full of VHS tapes, all labelled 'HOUSE,' and abruptly left, never uttering anything more than a: "You need to watch this."



The whole interaction was weird. Gerald was an older, stocky Polish man who apparently used to participate in bodybuilding competitions. He was loud and friendly and a bit uncouth, but he was always kind and welcoming regardless. I'd never seen him so skittish, and I felt even more unnerved when he didn't respond to any of my phone calls. 



Nonetheless, I checked out the tapes. Gerald never gave me anything that wasn't to my tastes, knowing my stance on watching weird swingers getting it on (to reiterate, it's not my thing). It was usually strange or random videos, that I'd be able to double check if they were worth anything historically, or connected to any crimes—solved or unsolved. I put the first tape, labelled 'HOUSE 1.1', into my VHS player, and, as I'd assumed, the pilot episode of House began to play. You know, with Hugh Laurie? Playing that cynical, asshole doctor? And it's never Lupus?



I was bored, and had nothing else to watch, so I just let it play in the background as I worked on some video editing. It was the same old shtick, until I heard crackling from the monitor. I turned to look, and the show turned to static, flickering and buzzing as a slow, muffled woman's voice came from the video. It was inaudible, but from what I could tell, it was a song; a light whistling from a  high-pitched voice that squeaked every now and then, clearly coming from an untrained source. Of course, this piqued my interest, and I excitedly swivelled round in my chair, ready to see what on earth could've spooked Gerald so much. Eventually, the static cleared, and a close up of a young woman's face appeared on screen. She was smiling, and she must've been using a camcorder, as her face wasn't properly in shot. Mostly her forehead, and the occasionally reveal of her grin as her hands shook. A self-film. She was humming a tune I didn't know, and she was wearing a hat, which I assume meant it was winter. It was dark out, and after some shuffling and movement, the camcorder had been set on a tripod, from what I could tell from the sudden stillness. After some adjusting, an entrance to a cave of sorts became visible, and the girl came to stand in front of the camera, visible from her shins upward. Even though she was wearing a trapper hat, and snow was now visible on the ground, she only wore a tank top and pyjama shorts. She kept smiling at the camera—nothing unsettling, but as if she was genuinely happy. A grin that reached past her eyes, though they were glassy and wandering.



"I'm so grateful for this!" She said, giggling and squealing and spinning around quickly. She put her hands to her mouth, and bashfully looked back at the camera. "I haven't managed to find the mine for so long, but look! Here it is!" 



She stepped forward, making her way back to behind the camcorder. The footage zoomed into the mine before zooming out and back in again in quick succession. She moved away, stepping back into frame and placing her face back in front of the camera. Her features were much more visible now, and there were deep, purple markings under her eyes. I rationalised that I was probably watching a drug addict. 



"I've been talking about the mine ever since I was little, and no one believed me!" She fake pouted, stomping away to where she was stood before. "But look at how dumb they all are! I told them it was real, but no one listened. No one ever listens to my dreams." 



She stilled, and tured to the cavern behind her. The 'mine'. After a moment, she turned, excruciatingly slowly, back toward the camera. Her grin had grown tenfold. She blew an exaggerated kiss to the camera, before turning back towards the mine, and walking into it, waving the entire time.



"Bon voyage, losers!" She screeched, and slowly, her figure disappeared into the darkness. It was silent, with only the low whistling of the wind audible. The camera immediately cut to black, and the end of the Pilot of 'House' starts up again. 



I was pissed off. I didn't know what Gerald was playing at, but this dumb prank wasn't something I wanted to waste my time over. I thought he must've just watched V/H/S 94 after my recommendation, and thought it would be a funny prank to collate student films and tape them over old episodes of House to spook me or something. I tried to call him again, but he never responded. After an hour, he finally texted me back:



*Did you watch the tapes?*



I scoffed, and gave him a piece of my mind. I told him I knew what he was doing; that I wasn't going to fall for whatever prank this was. He only replied one more time.



*Watch them. I can't explain any more. You won't believe me until you see it.*



That was at about 9 p.m. I reasoned I had enough time on my hands, and I hated to admit it, but I was curious. It wasn't necessarily scary stuff, but my interest was piqued, so I put in the second House tape, 'HOUSE 1.2'.



Like before, the second episode of the first season of House began to play. It didn't take as long for the taped-over footage to play; the static cutting through at least 20 minutes into the episode. Eventually, it cleared, and an out-of-focus shot of a man in an armchair was visible. It focused, and the man in the armchair appeared to be a very old, East-Asian man. He looked to be very serious, and had both his hands placed in his lap—his posture impeccable despite his age. 



"Mr. Higuchi, please let me know if you ever want to stop the tape. I want you to be comfortable, and we won't be able to progress with treatment if you aren't." A woman's voice said off-camera. Her voice was nasally and Bostonian, even though she'd clearly attempted to hide her accent behind a faux-professional tone. The man, Higuchi, simply nodded, and proceeded to stare directly into the camera. 



"Okay, I suppose we'll begin. Mr. Higuchi—"



"Osamu is fine. You can use Osamu." He interrupted, nodding slightly. Although his voice was stern, his mannerisms were polite. 



"Oh, um… apologies, Osamu. Your wife booked this appointment for you, stating she was worried about your behaviour after the attacks on September 11th. Do you know why that may be—what she might have been concerned about?"



He briefly looked just beside the camera, which I assumed was at the woman interviewing him. From everything I could tell, this was a therapy appointment, but I have no idea why it was recorded. I assumed it was another amateur film. 



"The fire…it was terrible." He finally responded, turning his gaze back to the camera. 



"Yes, it was--and you're not alone in feeling like that. I've had a large influx of patients since the tragedy, all of whom have various reasons for seeking support. Do you think you might have an idea as to why it affected you so much?" She asked, and the low scribbling of pen on paper could be heard. 



Osamu, or Mr. Higuchi, suddenly snapped his head to the side, glaring just behind his left shoulder. He mumbled something incoherent, and then smoothed out his shirt, pulling at the seam on his left shoulder. 



"Osamu, are you aware of what you are doing currently?"



"OF COURSE I AM AWARE!" he bellowed, and the camera wobbled slightly, likely because the woman was startled. Osamu quickly stood up and apologised profusely, bowing at a 90-degree angle. He then sat back down and brushed his left shoulder again before sighing deeply.



"I'm…I apologise. That was uncouth of me." He pushed his hand through his hair, and grabbed at it harshly, as if punishing himself; pulling so hard that he yelped in pain.



"Osamu! There's no need for that." The woman frantically ushered for him to stop, and he did. He pulled at the seam of his left shoulder again. He leant forwards in his chair; the first time he'd rested from maintaining his rigid posture. 



"Apologies. I don't know what has come over me…recently." He brushed his left shoulder again. "My wife is correct, the…attacks had quite an impact on me. I see things now." He stared into the camera again, tracing a finger on his thigh. 



"I see, that must be terribly distressing. Your wife said you served Japan in the Second World War; you were only 18—in 1944, correct?" He nodded, and the scribbling commenced. I was surprised to see how youthful this man was. Sure, he looked to be in his mid- to late 70s, but his movements were incredibly fluid. I chalked it up to makeup. The actor was likely someone far younger. 



"That…that was a terrible time for me." He stated, shaking his head. He jerked his left shoulder, and clenched his jaw, before shooting an angry look over his shoulder again. "The fire reminded me of that time. The smoke. The screams."



"Forgive me if I'm overstepping, Osamu, but are you talking about Hiroshima?" The woman asked, softly, yet still nasally. He snapped his head back, and shook it, turning to stare back at the camera again. There was a flicker in the footage, and for a brief second, I saw something bizarre. I rewound the footage, over and over again, until I'd managed to pause it at the right moment. A slight, fizzle of smoke emerged from Osamu's left shoulder—a small, blackened mark visible on it briefly. As soon as I'd pressed play again, it had disappeared. Still, Osamu continuously patted or jerked his left shoulder as the tape continued. 



"No. Not that." He hesitated, before flinching slightly; his back returning to the rigid state he held prior. He seemed uneasy, and had I been somewhat of a superstitious person, I would've believed, and subsequently been unnerved, at the fact that Osamu's expression seemed to be almost pleading with the camera—begging the footage to show something that he was too anxious to verbalise to the woman before him. 



I thought he was a damn good actor.



"I was…I was not a good person then." He continued, clearing his throat and changing his demeanour, as if remembering to reiterate what he had rehearsed. "We committed many crimes against humans, against people we captured. I was a soldier, but I was too weak to fight, and I have bad eyesight, so I couldn't fly. I was assigned to managing prisoners of war." 



"I…I see…" The woman responded, clearly at a loss for words. 



This was way more interesting than the last tape.



Osamu turned over his left shoulder again, visibly becoming more uncomfortable. He turned back towards the camera and resumed his forced, rigid facade. "As I was not a doctor, or scientist, I disposed of the bodies. In the incinerator. Sometimes…” He gagged, shaking. Suddenly, he sits upright again, flinching his left shoulder again. "Sometimes they were still alive, and so we would listen to the screams of the prisoners as they burnt, and begged to be let out. It would have been useless, though, as they wouldn't have survived regardless, even before the incinerator!" He stood up, and suddenly fell, as if having been smacked over the head. The woman behind the camera gasped, and quickly ran over, helping him up. He slapped her hand away, and screamed out; speaking Japanese. He turned, screamed at the empty space behind the armchair, and quickly brushed himself off, sweating profusely. His previously neat and perfectly ironed shirt was drenched, and he pulled a handkerchief from his back pocket. No matter how much the woman fussed over him, he denied her at every chance, and although it couldn't be heard, I assumed that he'd told her to go sit back down.



"Do you need medical attention, Osamu? You really don't seem well, and—"



"No. Don't. I don't deserve it." He breathed out, and slumped back down in the armchair. It looked like he'd have a heart attack. "Kata tataki. Do you know what that means?" 



The woman didn't respond, but Osamu began to laugh hysterically, before they turned into sobs. He sobbed and wailed, unbuttoning his shirt and failing to breathe correctly. A short rustling implied that the woman moved to call security, or for medical assistance, but Osamu lunged forwards, slamming his head on the ground and begging her to stop. 



"KATA TATAKI! They won't fire me." He gasped out, his eyes bulging. "But they'll have to kindly ask me to retire myself." His breathing was ragged and desperate, and he grunted and coughed. 



"SO I AM! I'VE ATONED, SO PLEASE—"



Osamu burst into flames, and the woman behind the camera screamed in fear, knocking the camera onto the floor. Osamu's legs were visible, bubbling and sizzling, and flesh dropping off bone into a blackened puddle on the floor. The carpet fizzled into the wood, and, rather quickly, Osamu stopped moving. Or what was left of him, at least. Gloopy sinew and scorched veins were reduced to nothing, like the wick of a candle dripping wax from heat, idly melting downward to cooler temperatures. He'd melted, then scorched, until blackened bones crackled with sparks, motionless albeit for the thermal energy that ricocheted his bones back up from the floor again. Marshmallow sticks splintering in a bonfire. White flooded the screen, and the lady began to extinguish him, crying and screaming the entire time. It sounded like she'd hurled off camera, and then, like the last tape, House begun to start up again. 



I'll admit, I thought it was a pretty good short film—way better than the last one. Definitely would've scared me if I hadn't been so cynical. I shot Gerald a text, but, of course, I was left on read. 



I wasn't tired yet, so despite how late it had become, I put in the third tape, 'HOUSE 1.3'. That was a mistake.



Same old shtick, no need to divulge into the details. The same static eventually emerged, and the footage depicted a young boy fiddling with something slightly off-camera. He couldn't have been older than 11, and had a missing front tooth. From what I could tell, he was in his bedroom, with all the DC Comic posters stuck unevenly on the walls, and it was daylight outside. 



"Hey guys," the kid said, blonde hair and freckles unfortunately littering every inch of his skin. "My dad got a drone, and me, Ryan, and Joe are gonna prank our neighbours with it!" 



The camera, which I assumed was a GoPro, showed two kids, both similarly looking like all kids, lest they be chunkier or taller than their peers at that age. The kid then panned the camera back to his face, snot visible up his nostrils. 



"Ok guys, be sure to like and subscribe, and get ready for the mayhem!"



I cringed deeply, recalling every awful video I'd participated in, or made my friends do, when I was that age. At least I could be thankful that I never had the concept of internet fame as a genuine career plan when I was young. 



The footage cut, and reemerged to show the three boys were near an apartment complex; the generic type that seems to frequent every city. The freckled kid was clearly behind the camera, or wearing the go pro, as only his friends were visible in the footage. Both of them seemed nervous, yet excited, and the taller of the two was almost vibrating with anticipation. The footage shifted, and grubby fingers grabbed at the lens until the kid, the 'main character', swivelled the camera back to face himself. 



"Ryan thinks his dad is cheating on his mom, so we're gonna catch them in the act. Fuck Ryan's dad!" The camera pans back to the two kids, and I assume Joe was the one cheering on, as 'Ryan', told him to knock it off. After some movement and clicking, the footage began to rise into the air, buzzing as it ascended. It occasionally smacked against the building as it flew, causing severe interference in the footage until it stabilised again. It got to the point where the footage was 4 frames a second, glitching and humming with each terrible movement from the kid's controls. 

There was nothing interesting, until they briefly caught a glimpse of a woman changing. The kid began to squeal in delight, which led the other two to join in, desperate to see what he was gawking at. The footage was barely visible, and, I suppose after what might've been a scuffle, the drone flew upwards randomly, slamming against a window of a 7th floor apartment. 



Then, there was a slam at my window.



I'll be honest, it made me jump. Creaky noises and unexpected bumps are common in my apartment building, so I'm not usually affected by such sounds. But it did make me jump. Perhaps because I thought I was watching horror shorts, and the eerie feeling you seek when looking for a good scare does put you more on edge. The footage paused, and started to buffer. I ejected the VHS, and pushed it back in, knocking on the player to hopefully fix it, though I knew it didn't do anything. 



After a few minutes, the VHS tape began to play again, but without my interference, it fast-forwarded to the point I was at last. Where the drone hit the window.



My window.



It was stuck on an image of the outside of my apartment, peering through the window; a blurry visage of myself, in my current clothes, hunched over my monitor, but head turned to look at my VHS monitor. It was unmistakable—me, in all my unkempt glory. It was just a few frames, but it was me, and as much as I'd tried to reverse the footage and view it again, it was frozen. 



A chill went down my spine, and I gingerly stepped towards the window, mind racing at the idea that the very kids I'd just seen on a dusty, old VHS of House MD were very, very close--present right outside my own home. I peered out of my window, and saw nothing. 



And then I heard police sirens. 



I unlocked my window and leaned out, desperate to quench the hollow dread that burned in my chest. I wish I hadn't. 'Ryan,' from what I could tell, had his head caved in; the remnants of the drone lodged deep into his skull. His eyes weren't visible—just a white, gaping mouth, and his still figure lay unmoving against the concrete. The drone must've hit my window, and lost connection to the remote, hurtling down onto the poor boy's head as he waited earnestly for the 'prank' to take place. I couldn't see the other kid, Joe, but the freckled one who filmed the video kept poking at his friend, as if to see if he'd respond. It was futile, but the pale shock of sudden death must've frozen him, and he continued to prod just below the drone's metal, on Ryan's cheek. Over and over again. Hoping in earnest that death might not have taken someone so young. But with half a head crushed to mush…



I threw up a lot. I didn't want to think of anything; the implications of the film, the kids, anything. I had a few whisky shots tonight, so pardon me for any grammatical errors. I need to tell someone else—someone that isn't Gerald. 



He texted back a few minutes ago. Saying how he 'knew', and he was 'sorry.' I blanked him, too confused and concerned about this awful 'Ringu’-like curse he'd unleashed on me. I'm too tired to write any more.



EDIT: Gerald sent me another text.



*The films show the future.*
