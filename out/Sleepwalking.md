I recently read a story about someone sleepwalking and it brought back a disturbing memories from when I was younger. I honestly never thought of most of these memories as disturbing but, looking back on it now I can see how weird these moments where. I think the best place to start my story is back in the beginning.

I grew up on a small dairy farm in the middle of rural Pennsylvania and didn't get to go many places or see many people. Due to my isolated early childhood I didn't have many friends growing up but, the friends I did have were extremely close. At the time I would consider my best friend to be Jake. We didn't live to far away and as an animal lover Jake loved coming to my house to see all the cattle, rabbits, goats, dogs, and whatever other animals we had on the farm. He also had an older brother who was almost 10 years older than him and would often bully him, so the escape to the farm was a welcome treat.

I didn't hang out with Jake nearly as much in elementary school because he was almost always in the hospital. He had a lot of health problems when he was young like open heart surgery, asthma, and cleft palette. I remember one time in the second grade he was in the hospital for roughly a month and every kid in class wrote him a get well soon letter. After our elementary years however Jake's health seemed to improve and he and I basically became inseparable.

He often spent the night at my house during our middle school years. I had a bunk bed that my parents got for me and we would often share it trading who got the top bunk every night. I don't know if I just didn't notice he habits at night when he first started coming over but I definitely noticed him when we were 12.

One night when I had the rights to the top bunk I heard a strange noise coming from bellow me. It almost sounded like a deep groaning mixed with a high pitched squeal every now and then. At first I thought it was maybe just my dad snoring from the other room but as I listened more I could tell it was coming from the bottom bunk.

"Jake is that you" I said quietly.

No response.

"Jake are you awake" I called out again a little louder.

A grumbled groan came from the bottom bunk.

"Jake stop messing around are you awake and making a weird noise" I peaked my head over my bed to see if I could see him. As I peeked down I saw Jake just laying there on his stomach face in a pillow, silent, not making a sound. I looked at him for a little bit and decided I must have just been hearing things and decided to go back to sleep.

I didn't notice Jake doing anything weird in his sleep or I was just fast asleep myself in the following weeks. About a month (at least I think it was a month) after the last sleep noise incident I heard something again. This time I was on the bottom bunk and when I heard noises above me I knew it who it had to have been.

"No..... Stop.... Help"

I thought I made out those words but honestly my memory is a little hazy from this night. I just remember hearing help and immediately jumped up and said "J-Jake what's wrong? Is there like a spider in your bed or something?"

No response.

"Jake seriously what's wrong" I had climbed up the bunk at this point and started shaking him.

"Huuh.. Oh.. Hi Drew what's wrong" He said staring at me confused.

"That's what I would like to know. Why are you asking for help your scaring me man?" He looked at me confused.

"I never said help, you must be hearing things dude. Have you been watching some like horror videos or something." He responded.

"You know I don't like horror stuff man, but fine I maybe just heard something. Let's go back to sleep." We both agreed I'm just looney and went back to sleep.

At some point I stopped bothering him about his sleep talking. I remember him doing quite frequently and at some point it was an almost every night occurrence. My Mom even told us one morning that she heard noises from our room around 2am and thought we were messing around late at night, just to find Jake playing with stuffed animals, singing a song about pink fluffy unicorns dancing on rainbows. She was laughing hysterically that morning as she told us the story.

One night when we were around the age of 13 I had lost my rights to the top bunk again. I was about to fall fast asleep when all of a sudden I hear a mass \*Thump\*. I jolted up looking around to see what happened. Everything looked normal none of my stuff fell, so I thought maybe I heard something outside and started to look out the window. As I turned to look through the window I catch something in the corner of my eye moving. I slowly turned my head. Soon a large dark figure started to fill my vision. I jumped back and almost screamed but then noticed it was just Jake.

"Jesus Jake you scared the crap out of me." I said in a Shakey voice.

No response.

"Jake are you okey, did you hit your head or something? Was that you who fell and made that noise?" I franticly asked hoping he would respond.

Still no response, but this time he moved. He turned and started walking out of my room. Confused I followed him hopping to get a response. As he walked out of my room I saw him walk down the hall and toward the bathroom. I assumed he just didn't respond to me because he needed to use the restroom and went to bed.

The next day my mother asked him why he was standing in the bathroom around 2am. He looked at here confused. "I don't remember going to the bathroom last night" He replied.

I looked at him and said "Yeah Jake you did. You scared the crap out of me when you fell off the bed."

He just stared at us confused "Guess I just forgot I did. Things like that have been happening lately. My mom also told me she saw me in the bathroom one night just standing there."

My Mom laughed it off and just said he was just a sleepwalking goober and to not think about it to much. Later her mind will be drastically changed.

It was getting close to Jake's 14th birthday and of course he was staying at my house. It was summer break why wouldn't he be there to play with the animals and hang out on the farm. Since it was the week before his birthday I decided to give Jake the top bunk for the whole week. Thinking back that might have been a mistake.

The first night he stayed on the top bunk I heard him crawling down the ladder. I turned over and just watched him assuming he would do his usual. All of a sudden he stopped, stared at me, looked up, and then climbed back up the ladder.

The next night I heard him again this time he was mumbling under his breath something I couldn't quite make out. I decided not to look at him this time to see if he would do something different. He did.

"Stop... No... Help.... Drew..." Those were the only words I made out but it sent a shiver down my spine. I turned to look at him.

I think I know why I blocked out these memories and I curse the story that made me remember them. I don't want to remember my friend's face that way. His face was stretched into a smile to large for his mouth. HIs eyes where rolled back and the light from the window behind me almost made it look like they where glowing white. His body was hunched over like he didn't know if he was awake or asleep.

I jumped back and screamed "Jake. Jake what the heck."

His smile turned into a frown, his eyes closed, and he stood up straight.

"Huh.. What? why am I standing here?" He asked with a now confused look on his face.

"Dude not cool. You can't just do that to me. Your going to give me nightmares man." I said, "Also don't ask me why you're standing there I should be asking you why your are standing there staring at me like a creep!"

Confused he responded "I guess I was just sleep walking again."

"I guess you were. Don't ever do that again man." I replied, "Let's just go back to sleep." I rolled over in my bed and heard him climb the ladder back up.

The final night he spent the night was another memory I wish I didn't recall. Not for the events that happened that night but because that was the last night I ever saw my friend Jake again. The night started like every other night had been. I'd be laying in bed and hear Jake climb down the ladder. Since this was the third night in a row that he had done this I just assumed he was pranking me at this point so I ignored him.

"Josh... Please.... No..." He mumbled under his breath.

Josh? His brother? Why is he talking about him tonight.

"Help... Drew...." More mumbles that I chose to ignore.

\*thump\*

I heard him move his foot.

\*thump\*

He took another step.

\*thump... thump.. thump.\*

I heard him leave the room and go into the hall. I could hear his footsteps in the hall until he was almost to the bathroom and then I drifted off into sleep.

"AAAAHHHHHHHHH" I awoke to my mother screaming. I hear my dad run out into the hallway and he yells "What's wrong honey."

"Lock the boys in their rooms and call the ambulance" I heard her replay.

At this point I jump out of my bed and try to run to the hall, but my dad is already there.

"Just stay in your room buddy everything will be alright." He told me in a comforting tone.

I sat in my room for about 15 minutes before I heard the sirens. We lived a long way from civilization after all of course they would take this long. As the sirens approached a thought appeared in my mind.

"Where's Jake?" I said outload.

I climbed up the ladder to the top bunk as I heard the paramedics came running up the stairs. As I got to the top to check on my friend all I saw was the fact that Jake wasn't there.
