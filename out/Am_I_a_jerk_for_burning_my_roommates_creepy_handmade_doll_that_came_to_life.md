My roomie and I have been playing a game, [“Doll in the Hall,”](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11nz6qy/am_i_a_jerk_for_refusing_to_participate_in_my/) which is like Elf on the Shelf but the elf is a terrifying sock doll come to life. We’ve been recording the doll’s paranormal activity—*for science!*

It was a *very* long night, for reasons I’ll explain, and so when I started [typing this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ryj2m/my_roommates_creepy_doll_went_viral_am_i_a_jerk/) I quickly realized I’d need about six more cups of coffee and a diet coke to get through it all.

So, apologies for taking so long with this update, but I’m back now, baby, an Energizer Bunny bashing on the keys! (Why yes, my diet *does* consist almost entirely of caffeine and aspartame; doesn’t yours?).

Right then, let’s get to it!

**Darwin Award:**

Curt came home within about 20 minutes of Karen posting our video of the doll, Boo Boy, toddling around, and predictably lost his shit. He threatened to kick us out unless Karen destroyed both the video and Boo Boy, who was suddenly nowhere to be found. Karen physically blocked Curt from entering her room to search (bold of her, given not only is the man twice her size, but we have an ongoing bet about whether he’s ever buried anyone in his backyard). She shouted that she *wouldn’t* take down the video but *would* call the police if Curt entered her room, and then slammed and locked the door.

Curt swore and kicked the sofa.

“Hey!” I said. “Chill—”

“DO NOT bark orders at me in my own house! You unleash bad fucking mojo—”

“It’s just a doll—”

“You are playing with fire, and don’t even know you’re already burning!” He jammed his finger at me. “Well, I am not gonna be the collateral damage! If I so much as catch a *glimpse* of that… *THING…* toddling into my room, I will break its little legs, then I will break *your* little legs, then I will throw you both out on your asses onto the street to live in a box begging for money with your broken little legs—you get me?”

Honestly, I had to admire the man’s eloquence. I mean, dollars to donuts he’d really do it, but hey, he sure could turn a phrase, huh?

(Why yes, people who threaten to break my legs are fine in my book, as long as they do it with *pizzazz*!)

Anyway, I was too stressed to sleep after that. Not only because Curt’s belligerent outburst had sent my heart rate spiking, but because after three days of Boo Boy moseying around in my periphery, his sudden absence was… *disconcerting*. Not so much because I didn’t know where he was in that moment, but because of the implications of his avoiding Curt.

You see, I’d been operating as if Boo Boy’s occasional movements were like ball lightning. Ball lightning is so rare that for centuries it has existed only in anecdotal accounts, and even now remains scientifically unproven. And while some accounts (especially early ones) have mistaken it for the work of spirits or devils, there’s no consciousness directing where the ball lightning appears or disappears. It’s not a spirit, moving with intentionality. And so Boo Boy’s walking was like that in my mind—a unique phenomenon, seemingly occurring at random around the house.

But his dodging of Curt implied a degree of intelligence--*sentience.*

And if this thing was capable of decision-making, not simply moving at random but deliberately and with purpose… then what *was* that purpose?

This is the question that suddenly, very deeply chilled me. And as I settled on the sofa, I began to wonder if, in my mad quest for science (and Karen’s for clicks), we’d perhaps gone too far… When I skimmed my documentation of Boo Boy’s movements during “Doll in the Hall,” I found that I’d complained about Curt’s caution as “overreacting” but put down Boo Boy walking all around our house as \*checks notes\* “normal.”

Yeah, okay. My bad. My judgment *may have been clouded.* It’s possible we might have *slightly lost touch with reality*. Passed bananas and gone full fruit salad. Boarded the crazy train, commandeered it, and conducted it right off the rails.

But now that I was searching for evidence of *intention*, I found that there was nothing in Boo Boy’s movements to support that hypothesis. None save for the one single obvious choice—never to move when directly observed by us or *by the cameras*.

Oh God. The thing understands cameras.

Curt’s warning came rushing back to me: *You are playing with fire, and don’t even know you’re already burning.*

And so it was partly because I was too creeped out to sleep, partly to keep an eye on things that I stayed out in the living room, turning off the lights so as not to bother my housemates, leaving only the soft glow of the bathroom nightlight.

I sat down on the sofa, adjusting the window shades to allow the moon’s silvery illumination to filter in.

Then I fell to pondering…

**Bad Fucking Mojo:**

So there I was, mulling over the mysteries of existence. (Deep thought being the virtue philosophers are famous for. You want fun? Flirty? Sexy? Sorry we don’t serve that here. Now, if you’re into endless pontification of the unknowable universe? Oh yeah baby, let me talk *deontologically* to you…)

A shadow flitted in my periphery.

I raised my phone before I even really noticed what I was tracking. It was no larger than a cat, but more like a monkey in its movements… toddling out across the carpet toward Curt’s door with the whisper of fabric.

Boo Boy.

I opened the camera app. Boo Boy had its back to me and I don’t think it had noticed me.

When I clicked, a blinding light flared just for an instant. Boo Boy’s head turned, so in that moment of the flash, the doll’s button eyes appeared to be staring right at me. As the light faded, I heard a quiet patter back toward Karen’s bedroom. Her door clicked shut.

Apparently, Karen was still awake, because a moment later her door opened and she slipped out.

“Did you see Boo Boy?” I asked.

She nodded.

“I just took a picture of him trying to go into Curt’s room…” I was fumbling with my phone, trying to open the image.

As soon as I did, I froze.

“What is it?” Karen came over.

My heart hammered.

I don’t… I don’t know quite how to describe the picture. It’d be easier if I could post it. Only, I don’t have the picture anymore, for reasons that I’ll explain. Honestly, I probably shouldn’t even describe it to you.

(Not to be a tease or anything—I *will* describe it. I didn’t bolster myself with six cups of coffee just to *not* write about the pivotal moment. But I’ll save it for the end, and I’ll put a header warning it’s coming. That way if you want… and if you’re *wise*… you can skip it.)

According to Karen, looking at the image was the mental equivalent of taking acid. Like the beginnings of a bad trip. Nausea. Dizziness. Hallucinations. For several moments afterward, everything in her periphery appeared to be crawling with snakeskin.

I, lacking her expertise in illicit substances, can neither confirm nor deny. The best I can describe is that it looked… *wrong*, and it made my brain itch and crawl. My heart hammered as if I’d injected caffeine straight into my veins. Every hair on my body stood on end, and the longer I looked, the *less* I could make sense of it.

Through the sickening lurching of my mind, one rational thought pierced: my first hypothesis was correct. Boo Boy was *being moved*. Manipulated by a force that hadn’t triggered the motion sensors, but caught in the flash—it’s like it was taken by surprise, unable to camouflage itself. Sudden terror struck me like a sucker punch to my gut, my nerves jangling and then tightening like violin strings ready to snap on the next note.

We were both still staring at the picture when Curt’s door slammed open.

“I can hear you two whispering. The fuck is going on?”

Karen and I just looked at him like two children caught red-handed over a broken cookie jar. Karen started to tell him it was nothing, but I showed him the picture.

“Jesus Fucking Christ!” he screeched, flinging one hand up to cover his face and the other to shove the phone away. “Jesus motherfucking Christ!”

“Pretty sure he’s not part of this,” I mumbled.

“Plato! Can you fucking please be serious!” begged Karen.

“I *am* serious.”

“You need to burn that motherfucking doll NOW!” said Curt.

“Just *wait.* Okay? Wait!” snapped Karen.

We all started to talk at once, but Karen shouted us both down, snarling, “Will you just listen? We gotta do this the right way! If we just burn it, we might unleash whatever this… this *thing* is. We have to do what she says!”

That shut both of us up.

Then, “Who the fuck is ‘*she*’?” demanded Curt.

For once, I was in agreement with him.

Karen flipped on all the living room lights, opened up the messages on her phone, and introduced us.

**All Aboard the Crazy Train:**

Karen’s video had swiftly racked up thousands of views, including by a woman who went by the handle of “PsychicDeathLady123,” a self-proclaimed expert in dark summonings. She’d messaged Karen and told her she must get rid of the doll before the possession advances further, or the thing manipulating the doll would come for us. Karen hadn’t fully believed her, but had nonetheless been in the middle of listening to her instructions on how to perform a cleansing ritual when my flash had caught the picture.

I had my doubts about this so-called spiritual expert, whose primary credentials were beady eyes, an exaggerated British accent, and jeweled rings on every finger, but in a video call with Karen, she asked right off the bat about Hitori Kakurenbo and who the players of our game were, proving she had at least some rudimentary knowledge of our situation (or at least knew how to Google). Still, it’s not like we were going to find a better paranormal puppetry expert on Yelp. PsychicDeathLady123 instructed us to begin by deleting *all* photographic and video evidence of the doll.

“Why?” I asked.

Cue woo woo warnings about how the doll serves as a *token,* to which the spirit could bind itself in order to manifest in the material realm. Supposedly, the spirit could use images as substitutes for the token if players were close enough in proximity to form a psychic link; but if we deleted everything, the spirit would have nothing to latch onto. The players (Karen, I, and Binky—yes, the hamster) could then burn the doll in order to end the game and force the errant spirit back to the spectral realm.

(Incidentally, I also asked about my posts on nosleep. PyschicDeathLady123 said being text only, they’re probably fine. *Probably*. So you know. It’s fine to keep reading. *Probably.*)

While Karen drove to her sister’s house to pick up Binky, Curt and I searched for Boo Boy, whom we found tucked into Karen’s bedcovers with his head on the pillow, as if he were sleeping like a good little boy.

Good grief.

Less than an hour later, we gathered around the firepit outside. From in iPad propped on a log, PsychicDeathLady123 guided us through assorted rituals (they were exactly what you’d expect of such rituals, involving various symbols and invocations in what I later found out was a $500 call—apparently there’s an after-hours upcharge).

Since Karen was holding Binky, the honor of closing out the game fell to me.

“Oh, er, well friends, this has been fun, but we are now officially—”

“Hurry the fuck up!”

Quoth Curt, ever the epitome of eloquence.

“Right. So… thanks for playing Doll in the Hall. Bye bye, Boo Boy.” I tossed the ragdoll into the flames. “GG.”

A horrific screech lit up the night. The doll’s limbs curled and turned black, and the little pigtails of hair made from my, Karen’s, and Binky’s locks sizzled and puffed into smoke. All three of us stepped back from the flames and covered our eyes.

Soon there was only ash.

**Game Over:**

And there you have it, folks! It’s been one heck of a wild ride, and I’m a day late updating because this post took so long to write, but we’ve officially concluded “Doll in the Hall!” Will update again if any more woo woo weirdness occurs. But since we obeyed the undeniable expertise of PsychicLadyDeath123, I’m going to assume this is *not* one of those horror cliches where we’ve seemingly vanquished the Big Bad Boo, only for it to pop up again in a followup post having possessed a new host (Probably Binky—*I’M KIDDING*! I will never let any harm come to our furry hamster overlord. Please put those pitchforks away).

Oh, but for continuity’s sake: YTA? NTA? ESH? Let me know in the comments!

I’ll also post my description of the photo there, too, so you know… as with anyplace on the interwebs, read the comments [*at your own risk.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
