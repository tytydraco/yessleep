I’ve never been a saint, but I have been a terrible sinner. I’m not looking for sympathy, because I deserve none. What I deserve, may come for me still.   
I’m writing this because I owe a debt, and no matter what happens to me, that debt has to be paid.  
I’m sorry Peggy.  
I’m killing Quiet Casey tonight.  
\-  
Her name was Peggy. Easily the ugliest girl in the school, if not the entire town of Oak Grove. She was a bookworm with coke bottle glasses and a haircut straight out of 1985. She also had a terrible stutter.   
All of us were horrible to her since her family moved to town in third grade. Hannah Stone, my best friend, was the first one to single Peggy out when she was the new kid. She started calling her, “Piggy.” Everyone else just jumped in from there. No one ever really wanted anything to do with her, except to make her life hell. I have my share of that. I have to own it.  
\-  
In fifth grade, Simon Lucas was the new kid who had just moved to our town two weeks before school started. Peggy was the first person he talked to. He moved in next door to her and he hung out with her for that first two weeks. Peggy had finally found a friend. I remember seeing them laughing and riding their bikes together over and over down the big hill on Dawson Street.  
The first day of school, he even sat with her at lunch, but by the end of the day, Simon realized that he was becoming friends with an outcast; the kiss of death for any new kid.  
Simon never said a word to her after that day.  
Peggy was alone again.  
\-  
When Peggy turned sixteen, her parents scraped up enough money to buy her a little beater that smoked and rattled down the road. You could literally hear it coming from a mile away.  
Peggy was so proud of that car. The innards may have been shot, but she kept it immaculate on the outside. There was never a bug in the grill or dirt in her wheels. She would even wipe it down during lunch break with one of those weird cloth things you could buy off of the television.  
Hannah decided it would be funny to play a prank, so one night, she stole the car right out of Peggy’s driveway. The next morning a smoldering husk of what used to be Peggy’s car was found in the school parking lot. No one was blamed for it, and no one was going to be. The town was just as guilty as the school for its disdain of Peggy.  
I know exactly who did it. There were ten of us, and after we had dumped gasoline all over it, Hannah and I both threw a match.   
I didn’t own it then, but I do now.  
\-  
The next day, Peggy confronted Hannah in front of the school. At first, we all assumed that there was going to be a fight, instead Peggy burst into tears and just asked, “Why?!”  
“I don’t even know what you’re talking about Piggy.”  
“I know it wa…wa…was you!”  
“P…ppa…prove it bitch! Why do you care anyway? That car was an old piece of shit.”  
“My pa…parents saved for f…fff…four years to buy that f…ff…for me.” There was an awkward silence. That’s when I first started to wake up. That’s when I first started to realize that I had an ugly heart.  
Hannah started laughing.  
“It took your parents four years and that’s ALL they could afford?! God, you’re way more poor than I thought.”  
Everyone laughed. Everyone but me and Simon Lucas. We didn’t laugh, but we also didn’t do anything when Peggy ran away crying.  
Peggy went back to riding her bike around town, but two months later, someone stole that too.  
\-  
It was senior year when Peggy got pregnant. She never said who the father was, but we all knew that it was Cody Baldwin.   
She had a crush on Cody for years, and even though he ignored her, he never really picked on her. I guess that’s what made him attractive to her. She was in the right place at the right time, and she finally told him how she felt and they went to bed together. It meant something to her.  
He was drunk and she was there. That’s what it meant to him. He told her as much when she told him she was pregnant.   
  
Even though we knew who the father was, for some reason that didn’t stop Hannah from starting the rumor that it was her father who knocked her up. Everyone in school picked it up and ran with it.   
Everyone started to call her Piggy Preggers.  
She could have gone on home studies, but for some reason, she insisted on finishing the year at school with everybody else.  
Hannah even started rumors that her baby was going to be some kind of mutated monster because of incest. A hideous thing that would haunt the town. Someone drew a crude picture on Peggy’s locker of the monster baby with two clawed arms and no legs.  
I look back on it now, and I have no excuse for myself. I was a cruel shadow of a human being who enjoyed hurting someone.   
I have to own that.  
What I am amazed by is that by that time, the whole town of Oak Grove seemed to hate her for no particular reason and she knew it. The town “othered” her and they all loved to do it. Maybe that’s why she stayed in school. Maybe she never truly let anyone get to her, until the bad day happened.  
\-   
The day before spring break, I tried to apologize to Peggy at school just after first period. She smiled back at me.  
“You feel bad huh? Little Quiet Cccc…Casey. Well mmm…maybe if you feel bad, you’d ssss…stand up and sss…say something next time your little fff…friends gang up on me.”  
Only an hour later, I saw a group of my friends walking behind Peggy through the hallway of the second floor. Hannah seemed to have it in for Peggy more than she usually did, and she was trying everything to get under Peggy’s skin.  
She had made a catchy little ear worm that she repeated over and over whenever Peggy was within earshot.  
“Ppp…Piggy Preggers with her legs up high,  
her daddy put it in and let the bbb…baby batter fly!”  
Hannah repeated it four times while she walked behind her, and when Peggy finally got to the edge of the stairs, she turned toward Hannah with a pointed finger.  
“Hannah, you nnnn…need to…”  
“Don’t point your finger at me, Piggy!”  
It happened so fast.  
To this day, I don’t know if Hannah meant to push her or it was just an accident. What I do know is that five seconds later, Peggy was face down on the floor at the bottom of the stairs with blood spilling out of her head and somehow, when we were asked what happened, none of us knew.   
Quiet Casey.  
\-  
She was rushed to the hospital. I still remember everyone standing outside of the school when she was loaded in the back of the ambulance.  Cody Baldwin watched her go in silence and as the ambulance pulled away, several of us looked over at him. She was carrying his baby after all. I asked him if he was alright. He jerked around to the sound of my voice like I broke him out of a trance.  
“Oh…yeah…it's just weird that’s all. I always thought she was going to come after me for child support someday. I think I might have just dodged a bullet.”  
\-  
She was in a coma for seven months. I moved away to go to college, but Hannah kept me in the loop. She told me that she heard when Peggy finally woke up, the only thing she asked about was her baby. They told her the baby died the day she fell down the stairs.  
Peggy never said another word. According to town legend, her eyes glazed over into a thousand yard stare that never broke and her mouth upturned to a slight smile. She stayed that way until they finally gave up on her and transferred her to a mental hospital about an hour outside of town.  
I listened to Hannah telling me the story and there were those little noises and intonations that let me know that she was smiling on the other end while she was talking. After she was done, I was silent.   
Why was I ever friends with this person? Why had I been so cruel to someone for no reason?   
“Casey? Are you still there?”  
“Yeah.”  
“Can I ask you a question?”  
“Ok.”  
“Is it wrong that I don’t feel bad? Casey…hello?”   
I had no words for her. I hung up the phone. I ran to the bathroom and threw up all over the floor before I could make it to the toilet.   
I needed to change who I was.  
\-  
Years went by. My parents stayed in Oak Grove but I wouldn’t go back to visit them. Instead I would ask them to come stay with me. Everytime they brought up my old home town, I was quick to change the subject.  
One day I finally got up the courage to tell my parents what exactly happened to Peggy and my part in everything.  
To my surprise they shrugged it off. They told me not to worry.  
“Bad things happen honey.”  
As the years went on, I talked to them less and less. I noticed that my parents seemed to change for the worse. They were more bitter, easier to anger, and more apathetic towards people in general.  
Twelve years after I left my home town, my parents were involved in a car accident and I lost them both. I had no choice but to go back home to settle all of their affairs.  
\-  
As I drove into Oak Grove, I noticed the state of the town. Everything was rundown.  
Trash everywhere, boarded up businesses, stray dogs whose stomachs were rubbing their backbones. Even the lake where we all used to hang out was little more than a fetid pond that reeked of dead fish.  
The people I saw walking around town moved in an aimless way and all the American flags from every porch were ragged and threadbare. The church had burned down a few years before and the rubble had never been cleared.  
Most of the oaks that lined the streets were dead or dying.  
\-  
When I finally pulled into the driveway of my old house, I barely recognized it. My parents had always taken care of their home when I was growing up. I had only been gone for twelve years, but it looked like it had aged more than thirty or forty without the slightest effort of upkeep.  
When I went inside I was met with the home of people who had never thrown anything away. Piles and piles of garbage and newspapers and food wrappers and all kinds of junk.  
My parents had been living like animals and I had no idea.  
I tried my best to clean up a little, but it was a lost cause. I heard a knock at the door.   
I never should have opened it.  
\-   
“Casey?!”  
Hannah looked far older than she should. Deep lines were set in her brow and there were streaks of gray in her dark hair. She was also very pregnant.  
“Casey! Oh my God! Hi!” She hugged me as tightly as she could manage with her stomach between us.  
“Hi.”  
“I didn’t know you were in town! I’m so sorry about your parents.”  
“Thank you.” There was a long silence and I realized that I had the perfect excuse for not inviting her in. I opened the door so she could see the state of my old house.  
“I’d invite you in, but it's a little crowded in here.”  
“Oh, I understand. You come by my place! Have you got a minute?”  
“I don’t know if I can. I’ve got a lot of stuff to do here.”  
“Oh come on! Just for a little bit. Let’s catch up!”  
\-  
Her house was worse than my parents, although she didn’t seem to notice. The outside was a monument to outrageous neglect, and the stairs that led up to her front door were cracked and covered in a thick brown mold. Inside was almost an obstacle course of refuse and debris. More trash, more smells, and small smatterings of mouse shit everywhere. I didn’t want to sit down.  
She had lost both of her parents as well just two years after high school. She never said what happened, and I didn’t ask.  
The more she talked, the more I realized how much I hadn’t missed her. It sounds strange, but I felt this pull inside my brain. Something was trying to make my mind slip back into the old me, and I was afraid of it. It was like being back in my hometown was bringing out the parts of me that I hated somehow. An angry thing that wanted me to grow ugly the way it had.  
She offered me a drink and I accepted. I needed it. I was surprised and disgusted that she poured one for herself. She sat down, handed me my whiskey and coke and then sucked down half of hers.   
“Are you sure you should be drinking?”  
“Oh hell, it’s the only thing that quiets this little bastard down. I think he looks forward to it every night. I’m just starting early today.”  
She was repellant. I wanted to leave, but what she said next made me stay.   
“Sometimes… I think we broke this town, ya know? Like Piggy took this town down the tubes with her. Remember Piggy?”  
“That’s kind of hard to forget.”  
“God, what a bitch!”  
“Is she still up at that hospital?”  
“As far as anyone knows, she’s still blowing spit bubbles and shitting her pants in a bed up there. Hasn’t kept her from cursing this town though.”   
“Cursing?”  
“Shit Casey, look at it. Everything has just been falling apart for the last twelve years. So many people have moved away, but the ones who still live here are either sick or dying!” She laughed so hard, she jostled something loose in her throat. She snorted and then spat out a green glob on the cover of an old People Magazine.   
“Did you hear what happened to Cody Baldwin?”  
“No.”  
“He just went nuts. He kept telling people he was being followed at night. Well one night, he was home alone. All the doors locked. He barricaded all the windows and doors with boards and nails. It took the cops an hour to get inside. They found him on his bed. He wrote a note about something trying to get inside of his house to kill him right before he blew his own head off.”  
“My God.”  
“That’s not even the fucked up part.” She lowered her voice. “The gun was found halfway across the room and no fingerprints were on it.” She smiled and shot back the rest of her drink. She left me in a state of shock while she got up and poured herself another whiskey. She asked me if I wanted another and I shook my head.  
“Remember Simon Lucas? His brakes went out on the top of that big hill on Dawson Street and he was T-boned by an Amazon truck at the bottom. Died instantly.  
All kinds of weird shit happens around here. Almost half of our graduating class have all died. ”  
“Then why uh…why haven’t you moved?”  
“Well I own the house outright, and I’ve got an easy job at the hotel that pays enough. Maybe I’ll move someday, but I’ve got a pretty sweet thing going here.”  
“Yeah.” I looked around her “sweet thing” she had going on. It was strange. As if the thought of leaving a town that may be cursed was completely alien and illogical to her.   
She was delusional.  
“Whoa! Ow!” I watched her stomach move. “Little bastard is thirsty. I’m working on it, you little shit! Jeez! His dad up and left two months after I got pregnant, so I’m still working. It's been really hard on both of us.”  
She jumped again. I saw her stomach move twice. It looked like the kid was trying to push his way out right then and there. I had never seen a baby move that much.  
She told several more stories of how people I used to know died horrible deaths and then laughed about it.   
She was not only content, but happy to stay in this miserable place.  
I was reminded of the crab-bucket effect. With every word she spoke, and every minute I spent listening, I realized I was allowing myself to be pulled back down into the pit of this town.   
I had to leave.   
She insisted that we exchange our new numbers before I left, so I did, but I had every intention of deleting her info as soon as I took care of one more visit.  
It was late afternoon, but I needed to try and make things right one more time.  
\-  
The mental hospital was almost an hour outside of town, and as soon as I left my old home behind, I instantly felt better. I inquired about Peggy at the reception desk to see if it was even possible to see her.  
The nurse gave me the side-eye and spoke to me in a hushed tone.  
“She’s not here anymore. Her Daddy came and took her back home years ago.”  
“Does he still live in the same house he always did?”  
“Technically speaking. If you can call staying in that town living. A miserable place full of miserable people.”  
\-  
I knocked on the door of Peggy’s old house and I waited. It was ridiculous of me to be thinking the way I was. Even if she couldn’t hear me, I had to apologize to Peggy that night, because I was firm on never coming back to Oak Grove again.  
The door finally opened and Peggy’s father was standing there.  
“Can I help you?”  
“Yes. Sir my name is Casey…”  
“I know who you are, Miss. You’re one of those girls that took my baby and my grandbaby from me. I never forget a face.”  
“Sir, I just want to see her, if I could? I need to apologize to her for how I treated her.”  
“Well this is a first. One of you coming back here to try and make yourself feel better for being such a bitch to her.  
Apologize, huh? Sure, why the hell not. You can just kneel there at the foot of the oak in the yard and apologize all you want. Maybe you can apologize to my granddaughter too. We spread both of their ashes down there.”  
“She’s gone?”  
“Oh sweetie, she died eight years ago. I watched her just waste away in her bed until at the end, she was only a shadow of what she used to be. But you didn’t ask me if she died, you asked me if she was gone. That’s a harder one to answer isn’t it?” The tone in his voice became more sinister and he smiled.   
My skin started to crawl.  
“I’m sorry for your loss…and…I’m sorry for my part in it.” I turned to go back to my car. He grabbed my arm from behind and pulled me around.  
“You were smart enough to get outta town when you did. Much smarter than a lot of other people. If you’re being honest with me, I want to give you some advice. Get out of here before she knows your back. She’s not one to accept apologies anymore.”  
\-  
By the time I had got back to my parents house and grabbed a few things, the sun was already beginning to set. I wanted to be on the road before it got dark.   
I had just got in my car when my phone rang.  
It was Hannah.  
“Cccasey…I need help!” She was crying.  
“What’s going on?”  
“Ppp…please hhh…hhelp…”   
“Hannah, I have to go.”  
“I’m scared.”  
The call dropped.  
I didn’t care.   
\-  
I started driving away, back out of the town. I had made a mistake by coming back, and I had no intention of staying there any longer.  
I was stopped at the light just on the edge of town and it started to rain. I was at war with myself.   
I had spent the last twelve years trying to atone for being a cold hearted bitch who helped destroy someone’s life, and right then I was leaving town without even checking in on someone who was crying and asking me for help.  
The light turned green, but I didn’t move.  
I finally turned around and headed back to Hannah’s house.   
\-  
The rain was pouring and the street lights were out on Hannah’s street. I had to hold onto the handrail to keep from slipping on the stairs up to her porch.  
Her door was locked, but I could hear Hannah screaming inside. I had to break a window to get in.  
The smell hit me the second I set foot on her crunchy carpet. A putrid stink of rot that wafted through the house.  
I ran down the hall and found Hannah writhing on her bathroom floor. Her hair and skin were slicked with sweat. She was only wearing a pair of boxers and her bra. There was a discolored chunky fluid smeared all over the tile, and I realized that her water had broken and she had defecated.  
“Help me! Casey! Oh God it hurts!”  
I ran to Hannah and tried to keep her still. I put one arm behind her shoulders and held her head up.  
“I got ya! I’m going to get help! Just hang on!”  
I called 9-1-1 on my phone and told them we needed an ambulance. The operator tried to keep me on the phone, but I let it fall to the floor while I tried my best to hold onto Hannah.  
Her pupils were completely dilated and her pulse was almost beating through her neck. Her stomach was spasming violently and I could see blood starting to spot her boxers.  
“Casey! Ccccasey! Please make it stop!”  
“They’re on their way! You’re going to be ok!”  
I held onto her as best as I could, but she started thrashing so wildly and her skin was so slick, I lost my grip on her. She fell out of my arms and the back of her head crunched as it crashed into the tile floor. She stopped moving.  
“Oh my God! Hannah! Hannah?!”  
Her eyes were closed and I could feel a faint pulse in her neck. Everything was quiet except for the sound of the rain. I reached for my phone, but I stopped when I heard the front door of the house open.  
“Hello?! Is somebody there?!”  
At first there was nothing, but then I heard the sound of quiet laughter.    
I looked down the dark hallway, but I could only see a small part of the living room and the broken window I had climbed through.   
“Hello?....Hello?”  
Hannah’s stomach started to move again. This time it was moving downward, and blood began to soak the front of her boxers. I could hear the laughter again. I picked up the phone and whispered.  
“Please hurry.”  
“Miss, just stay on the phone with me. They’re on their way.”  
“Ok.”  
Something started to move through all of the filth in the front room.  
A bottle fell over.  
I heard a glass break.  
Then I heard a small patter that started to get louder. I saw mice, hundreds of them, running from underneath all of the garbage and out through the window I had broken.  
Hannah whispered my name, and I looked down at her worn face.  
“I’m here.”  
“Ccc…Casey…” Another voice came from the front room. It was rough and hoarse. Someone was in there with us. I looked around the bathroom for something to defend myself with and the only thing I could see was the shower curtain rod.  
I laid Hannah’s head back down and slowly stood up.  
“Quiet Cccc…Casey…”  
I ripped the rod from the wall and tore the curtain off of it. The hooks clattered to the tile and I held the rod like a bat.  
I waited. The sound of Hannah’s ragged breaths echoed in the bathroom while the pounding of the rain became more intense.  
I waited  
and waited  
and waited  
“FUCK IT HURTS! OH FUCK! IT HURTS!” Hannah jumped off of the floor and stood up. Her eyes were wild and her face was twisted in agony. She ran as fast as she could down the hallway toward the front room. “HELP ME! IT’S RIPPING!”  
  
Blood ran a bright red down her legs and left a trail down the hallway. She disappeared from view but I could still hear her screaming as she ran out the front door, and then I heard her fall down her front steps.   
Then there was nothing but the rain.  
“Hannah?! HANNAH?!”  
My heart was pounding. I got up the courage to move forward. With every step, I was convinced that something I didn’t want to see was going to come racing down the hall toward me.  
I eased my way into the front room, but there was no one there. The front door was wide open and as I walked over to it, I saw Hannah’s crumpled body at the foot of the steps. She was already soaked. Everything was dark, so I found the switch by the front door and turned it on.   
Her porch light flickered and it was dim, but it was just enough light for me to see that Hannah’s dead eyes were staring back at me and her mouth was agape. Her neck was crooked and one of her legs was broken.  
I could hear the siren from the ambulance in the distance. I kept looking around, making sure that no one was anywhere near me.   
“Quiet Ccc…Casey…”  
Someone was standing in the darkness across the street. I tightened my grip on the shower rod.  


*Only a shadow of what she used to be.*  


I saw Hannah’s body start to move.  
The flesh of her stomach was stretching like a balloon that was being inflated and then deflated. Over and over. Things inside of her were crushing and popping. Fabric started to rip and then her stomach flattened as something spilled out onto the dark street.  
“Quiet Casey…”  
I will not describe what crawled out of her body because I don’t want to remember it. I watched it crawl silently and deliberately across the street toward the person in the shadows. The person leaned down, picked it up, and cradled it.  
The ambulance finally rounded the corner onto Hannah’s street and I looked toward it with relief, knowing that someone else was coming.  
When I looked back across the street, the person was no longer there. As the ambulance got closer, the headlights illuminated a trail of filth that led from Hannah’s body to the other side of the street. I watched it quickly vanish as it was washed away by the rain.  
\-  
I was detained for only one night. It was determined that Hannah’s death was an accident, and that she had suffered a late miscarriage due to her fall.  
When I was questioned by the deputies, I said nothing of what I had seen.  
I kept hearing that rough voice from the shadow in my head, and for once, I think I did what Peggy wanted me to do.   
I was Quiet Casey one more time.  
\-  
I left the next morning, and I’ve never gone back. I wrote this because I need people to know what I did. I owe a debt.  
I’m sorry Peggy.
