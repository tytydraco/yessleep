I’m not usually a fan of Reddit, but this seemed as good a place as any to post my story. Maybe y’all can get some karma out of it or something. I don’t know.

Something happened several weeks ago that brought back a memory from when I was five. It was so vivid, I have to tell you that part before I get on to the rest.

I was spending the day at my grandma’s apartment after preschool class let out. I don’t remember the time, just that it was early enough that I needed to go someplace after class while my parents were still at work.

I remember getting off the bus at the apartment building and running up to my grandma to give her a hug. We spent most of the day doing the normal grandma stuff—puzzles, which I always loved, and sitting on her couch watching cartoons like I always did. It was honestly a pretty normal day. Grandma made chicken soup, she had those butterscotch candies in the little gold wrappers, and I spent the afternoon sneaking them while watching the 2003 TMNT show. When I try to remember if this was a dream or not now, my go-to answer in my brain is that I remember the episode. It was “New Girl In Town,” the episode where they introduced Karai (Once a TMNT fan, always a TMNT fan). I remember sitting on the floor about two inches away from the TV (because I was a menace) and being so excited about the turtles and this new character.

About ten minutes into the episode, my grandma left to go to the local thrift shop, as she would volunteer there most days. It was right next to her apartment, so she didn’t have to worry too much. Remembering that now, I find it a bit strange because even if it was directly next to the building, she was still leaving a five-year-old alone in an apartment building for a few hours every time I went over. But there had never really been problems before, so what could go wrong?

As I sat there watching turtles, I distinctly remember hearing a sound out of the corner of my ear. It sounded like faint buzzing. I think I tried to rationalize it as being the building or the fan in the other room, but looking back on it now, it sounded more like a weed wacker right outside the window.

My grandma lived on the third floor.

I ran to the window to check what it was, and when I didn’t see anything, I figured it was fine, and I didn’t want to miss the rest of the turtles.

That’s when I saw it.

A small, what looked to be glass, cube sitting on the floor. I distinctly remember being curious and not scared or put off by the cube. I was a pretty inquisitive kid, and at five, I don’t even know if I realized a cube appearing wasn’t normal yet.

I sat about four inches away from it on the floor for about ten minutes, just watching it. I was fascinated by this thing. I remember the picture on the TV screen behind it getting fuzzy, and the picture showed up clearer inside the cube. Looking back, I think it was tuned to the frequency being put off by the TV.

So I kept watching turtles through the cube, and it was strange to me that I also remember it being so much more high definition than the small TV my grandmother had. This went on well past turtles and onto some other shows until the cube started blinking and spinning. I remember a blinding white light. And then I don’t remember anything at all. I don’t remember going home that night, I don’t remember my mom picking me up from grandma’s. Nothing. And I still struggle to remember things well after that day. As far as I can remember, that was the last day I went to my grandma’s, but my mom says I went plenty of times after that. When she said that, I got concerned. I thought I had just had a shoddy memory. But now it feels more like I’m actively repressing something that went on for a really long time.

I told my mom about the cube earlier this weel. She told me I must have been dreaming, and specifically mentioned how we had this conversation when i was 5, and that she remembered it, and before yesterday, I would have agreed with her.

I hadn’t thought about this moment for years. I don’t even know if I remembered it at all up until that day 2 weeks ago. I was at family dinner at my parents’ house, and all of my family was there. Specifically, I was spending time playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate with my seven-year-old nephew, Noah. After that, we got in the side-by-side that my brother, Devin, had driven them over in and drove around for a while in the woods, through the mud, which he always thinks is awesome.

Eventually, I had to pull over in the woods and go behind a tree to use the bathroom. My nephew stayed in the buggy. I was only gone for three minutes, and when I got back, Noah wasn’t in the side-by-side anymore. I started freaking out for a second but then took it easy and went looking for him.

It took me about twenty minutes before I found him sitting behind a nearby rock, staring at something. I was a bit concerned because he looked enthralled by it. I walked a bit closer and put my hand on his shoulder.

He looked back at me and then looked back down. As he looked down, he said, “Where did it go?” I looked a bit concerned and began leading him back to the buggy. “Where did you go, dude?”

He looked at me and said something that had been bothering me ever since: “There was this glass cube,” and right as he said that, it all came flooding back. I still, foolishly, chose to ignore it. And the night went on as normal.

A week or so went by and I got a call from my brother Devin, he was freaking out saying that he and Noah had found their cat snowball killed this morning, and that he was trying to figure out who did it.

When he said, "Who did it," I was a bit confused. Where we live, if a pet was killed, it was often times by a wild animal. So I pressed the matter. The conversation went like this

Me: "So you think someone killed Snowball?"

Devin: "I don't think so. Sorry about this, but it's hard to describe." 

He sent me a picture. I was disgusted. The picture was of snowball, with what looked like a massive, perfectly cut cube shaped section of her just completely removed. This wasn't the only instance of this that day. 

I later learned that this had been happening all over my hometown. Animals having large sections of meat removed from them in perfectly cut cubic shapes. 

But only seeing snowball, I put the pieces together instantly.

It was the perfect size and shape of THE cube.

My heart pounded in my chest, I dropped my phone and ran to the bathroom to throw up, and as I did, there was a nock on the door.

Between barfs, I said "one second," and I finished about 10 minutes after saying one second. I walked over to the door.

I opened it and to my surprise there was no one there. Just a small package and a note. I opened the note and pulled out what I thought must have been a joke. It was a blank white sheet of card stock that had nothing printed on it. In fact, as I noticed that, I realized that the entire package was unmarked.

I was too curious. I began to take the tape off of the box to reveal a large amount of silk, as if someone had used it in replacement for packing peanuts. I remember thinking that was fancy until I reached in and pulled out what was waiting inside for me.

A cube.

My heart sank. I quickly wrapped the cube back in the silk and threw it into my trunk. I was going to get to the bottom of this. 

As I drove my car to work the next morning with full intentions of showing the cube to my coworker, I heard bumping in my trunk. When I got there, I went around to check only to realize there was a smoldering hole in the trunk of my car, the same as snowball. And the cube was nowhere to be seen.

That's the last I've seen or heard of it. It's been years since then, and I haven't told anyone other than my mom about the cube. Maybe it's because I'm avoiding the subject, but I have never experienced anything so strange in my life, and I needed more people to know about it.
