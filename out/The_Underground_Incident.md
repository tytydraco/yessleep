Hi, my name is David and a survivor of the incident. I wanted to share with you what happened in the small city known as Millfield. The city used be peaceful and normal like any other cities in the world until one day...

The darkness enveloped the small city of Millfield, casting an eerie shadow over the deserted streets. The solely sound that ought to be heard used to be the howling wind, as if the very air used to be mourning the loss of the once thriving community. It had been two weeks due to the fact that the first disappearance and the townsfolk have been opening to recognize that this used to be no normal event.  


The local authorities had been baffled by the surprising vanishings. No signs and symptoms of warfare or compelled entry could be determined at any of the affected houses. It was as if the missing people had virtually vanished into thin air. But the disturbing horror was once yet to come.  


It used to be on a cold, dark night that a group of scientists from the research facility subsequently uncovered the truth. They had been studying the atypical readings coming from deep under the earth's surface, and it was once their findings that would exchange the direction of human history forever.  


The researchers observed an ancient underground civilization, one that had been buried deep underneath the earth's crust for eons. They had been a race of monsters, twisted and deformed by way of the extreme stress and darkness of their subterranean home. They had lain dormant for centuries, waiting for the possibility to reclaim the surface world as their own.  


The scientists had unknowingly breached the barrier that saved the monsters trapped underground, and now they have been free to roam the world once  more. The creatures wasted no time in making their presence known, attacking and abducting the townsfolk in the darkness of the night.  


The last residents of Millfield had been now trapped in a desperate fighting for survival. They barricaded themselves in their homes, armed with something weapons they may want to find, but it used to be clear that it would only be a count number of time earlier than the monsters broke through.  


As the days passed, the survivors started out to be aware that the creatures had been changing. They had been adapting to the floor world, developing stronger and greater powerful with every passing day. It appeared that the monsters had a plan, and it used to be only a be counted of time earlier than they would launch their last assault on the closing humans.  


The survivors knew that they had to act quickly if they desired to have any chance of survival. They shaped a makeshift army unit and launched a desperate attack on the monsters' underground lair. It was once a brutal and bloody battle, but in the end, the people emerged victorious.  


But the cost of their victory used to be great. The underground town had been destroyed, and the monsters had been driven back into the depths of the earth. The remaining townsfolk had been left to pick out up the portions of their shattered lives, haunted by the reminiscence of the horrors they had faced.  


The incident at Millfield used to be hushed up through the authorities and the lookup facility, the secrets of the monsters were buried with the city and the survivors have been given new identities and relocated. But the monsters had been no longer long past forever, they had been still there, buried deep below the earth's crust, waiting for the day when they would upward shove once more and declare the surface world as their own.

Ever since that day, i have lost many friends and family that I wish to not speak of their name of. But sometimes I wonder if there are many more monsters laying around underground from other cities just waiting to devour the walking innocents that's above them.
