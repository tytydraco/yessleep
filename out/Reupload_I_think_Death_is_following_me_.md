I've had a lot of near death/spooky experiences the past three days. 

First it was finding some bones (most likely a small animal's such as a baby deer or raccoon) and later realizing they were in the shape of my first initial, which I of course walked over and scattered slightly before I could get a picture. Normally I like spooky things and sent the picture to one of my friends who I thought would appreciate it as they also like weird/spooky things. Until they replied back that it looked like it was meant to be in the shape of an 'N' and to be careful. 

Next, while out tidying up the yard to start a garden next Spring (we just moved in a few weeks ago and no time to start planting anything this year) I kept finding bits of sharp metal and a hodge-podge of nails and screws. I tripped over something in the yard (a large rock most likely, it's very rocky here) and nearly stabbed myself in the eye with an oddly new looking and red painted screw. Very odd as we haven't done any carpentry around the house, let alone outside. I've also found bits of broken glass of different thickness and a few of different color (yellowish and grey/green, but these vanished from the nest pile I was collecting) in the same area. 

Yesterday while taking up leaves in the side yard, a large oak branch suddenly gave way and nearly hit me. When my husband went out the next day to buck it down and clear it away, he remarked "Holy SHIT, Honey, they call those widow makers for a reason! THAT was the branch that missed you??"

Today I was out for a walk with our 87 lbs German Shepherd on the easement trails shared by/between properties of us and a few neighbors. We're on a very rural/mountain area and it's usually quiet of people noises but lively with small animals, insects, and birds. I didn't notice right away that it had gone quiet. Unnaturally quiet. That is until my dog started snarling and snapping in the direction of the manzanita just up the hill a short distance from us. Then the birds occupying the bush next to it all burst into flight as one swarm. I didn't hesitate. I called for my dog to turn but had to grab the handle on his harness (thank goodness I decided to put it on him in the event that we ran into the neighbor's mastiff) and we headed back to our house as calmly as I could manage. The sound I heard, ripping towards us from the undergrowth was not something I have ever heard before and I don't want to again, was something between the low roar of gale force winds and a metal band lead singer's growl. It had some odd undercurrent to it that sent shockwaves through the primal part of my brain, demanding that I run and NOW that I was somehow able to push down and ignore. We just made it back into the house and as I was twisting the deadbolt into place I heard the cry ( previously a low, reverberating bass) crescendo with a snarl. Now I wish I'd had the presence of mind to record the noise, but fumbling to do so might have given whatever it was time to attack. 

Now I'm terrified of leaving the house. 


Edit: would love to add pictures (of the animal bones, metal bits/nails&screws, and possibly my dog) but I'm on mobile.
