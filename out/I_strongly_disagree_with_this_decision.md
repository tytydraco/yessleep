The following letter was found in the cell of prisoner M. [De.XXX](http://De.XXX), a few hours after his internment in the XXXX psychiatric hospital. The defendant's lawyer was against the publication of this letter, but the court decided to allow its publication for unknown reasons. The contents of the letter have not been altered in any way, and are reproduced below.

Dear Judge,

I have written the letter you are now reading to express my dissatisfaction with your recent decision. My lawyer has already started the appeal process, but I want to get my story to you before my next court session.

Because of your decision, my peaceful life has been turned upside down and a part of me has died. The future is bleak, and your verdict is to blame. I really don't agree with your principles, and I'd like to say something.

To help you understand the situation, we need to go back in time. Four years ago, to be precise.

I had just tragically lost my wife. I don't want to go into the details, her killer was put away for life, as you know, and I have to make sure I live as long as possible to go and spit on her grave.

Living in a rather remote area of the French countryside, being around people was a rare enough thing for me, and the fact that I lived completely alone looking after the farm my father left me didn't help matters. I more or less provided for myself, and had very little dependence on the outside world, not that I disliked human contact, it's just that I preferred to stay in my own bubble.

As the days went by, this feeling of solitude only increased. The lack of noise was certainly one of the things I could stand least, and I'd reached a stage where a change was necessary, if only to keep from going crazy.

From time to time, I took a trip to a large park between the nearest town and my farm. The park was a long way from home, but the long drive was good for me. Although I'd lost my wife, I didn't feel hatred or envy when I watched families having a good time at picnics. They had a right to happiness, but I had a right to mine too, the only one I'd ever had having been taken away in the most despicable and cruel way imaginable.

It was a Sunday. The sky was a mesmerizing blue and the sun was shining brightly. As usual, I was reading a book on my favorite bench near the playground. 

Several hours later, I was roused from an unexpected nap on my favorite bench, book in hand and drool flowing. I sometimes fell asleep when the softness of the night invaded the park. It was a kind of rubbing on my leg.

And that's when I realized that my life was going to change overnight.

He looked sheepish, and just stood there looking at me as if he expected something from me.

I asked him if he was alone, and he didn't answer. There was nothing on him to give me any indication of his name or address, and the only occupant of the parking lot was my old Mustang. 

What first crossed my mind was the sane and logical thought of making a phone call to report the incident, but it was the second thought that won the day. As I pulled my phone out of my pocket, the reflection of my face on the still unlit screen was an electroshock. Loneliness had been eating away at me, the dark circles under my eyes repulsive and the sadness of my own gaze almost nauseating.

Then I remembered Sébastien. Sébastien lived about ten kilometers from me and visited from time to time. He was much older than me and had explained to me that he'd managed to combat loneliness with a stray cat he'd adopted. He was never married, and when he realized, too late, that he never would be, that stray cat he found in the woods was, he said, his lifeline, right up until his death last year. I don't know what happened to the cat.

But then I realized I'd found my own lifeline.

I put my phone back in my pocket and stroked the head of my new companion, whom I'd decided to call Sébastien. I told myself that giving him this name had been done on a whim, but Sébastien was the most logical choice for me at the time.

Sébastien's sad eyes and lack of energy, who must have been abandoned by irresponsible people, didn't make me feel pity, but were rather a breath of hope. The hope of having a companion to brighten up my morbidly boring days.

As soon as I brought Sébastien home, I started looking after him as best I could. I was very attentive at first, and made him feel at home on the farm.

At first, as he regularly tried to escape, I set up a kennel with a doghouse in the backyard, the kind of kennel that makes you think of Snoopy. The kennel was wire-meshed, and I put a chain around his neck to prevent him from digging a hole and running away. He could take shelter when it rained, and keep more or less warm when it was cold. In summer, I made sure he didn't run out of water.

However, the more the days went by, the more I tired of his company.

He spent a lot of time barking, and despite numerous canings, the situation didn't improve. To punish him for his bad behavior, I deprived him of water for several days in the summer. To make him understand that he had to behave, I took away his kennel in winter and put it back once he had calmed down, or was too frozen and tired to continue growling as he so often did.

I used to smile with pleasure when I saw Sébastien looking for any kibble in his kennel. My annoyance was growing, and I found a certain pleasure in seeing him suffer.

From time to time, I took him out to a forest not far from my home, and despite everything, he loved to play. It took a while, but after a few weeks, he'd manage to bring back the ball I threw, guided by the pleasure of receiving a piece of raw meat or a kibble as a reward.

What I didn't know was that in this same forest there was now a new trail, very suitable for quiet walks, appreciated by the few city dwellers who came to recharge their batteries in the countryside from time to time.

Walking on this trail was a fatal mistake.

Sébastien hadn't been used to seeing people for 4 years, since I picked him up in the park. I'd spent months trying to tame and educate him, but I hadn't really thought about how to handle him in public.

The only thing I knew was that a muzzle was essential. Sébastien often barked, which kept me awake at night, and liked to bite, which he had done on several occasions in the past. I still have a few scars. And I think I broke a few bones in return, kicking him in the ribs as a punishment.

So I'd got into the habit of putting his muzzle on during walks in the woods, and figured it wouldn't be a problem if we came across someone.

As I explained to you during my court session, it's not my fault, nor Sébastien's, that this French tourist died as a result of the injuries he inflicted on her.  
I repeatedly told the woman not to remove Sébastien's muzzle, but she wouldn't listen.  
She screamed so much at the sight of my companion, for some reason, that she wouldn't or couldn't hear anything.  
If he tore half his throat out when she took off his muzzle, it was purely out of defense - he had a muzzle for a reason.

As I watched the French tourist bleed to death in front of me on the trail, I was amazed at how the few teeth Sebastian had left were sharp enough to completely rip through skin, flesh and bone. Had I known he could do so much damage, I would have taken more precautions.  
But neither you, the police nor the jury would admit that Sébastien only defended himself.

It seems that his parents, the irresponsible people who cowardly left him in the park 4 years ago, are going to take care of him now.

I lost custody of my son, an 8-year-old boy whom I looked after as best I could for four years, and I don't agree at all with your decision.
