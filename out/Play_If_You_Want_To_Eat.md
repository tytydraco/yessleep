Sari Njein is still at large, possibly somewhere in San Francisco. She would use her connections with family and neighbors to hide among everyone else. I survived, but I have to be careful not to say where I live now.  
  
The sight of Barbie dolls or Powerpuff Girls or My Little Pony makes me sick. At first, I refused to play with the toys. I had no idea what she was talking about, I'd never seen her daughter before.  
  
Hunger can do strange things to a man. I wanted to survive because I wanted to kill her. Not because she jabbed me with a needle with some animal tranquilizers loaded into it and then stuffed me into the trunk of her car and beat me with plastic toys while I regained consciousness. I wanted to kill her because I'd brought in my dog to her emergency animal clinic and while she had me imprisoned she told me she'd killed my dog. For that I wanted to get my hands around her neck, for Ioved my dog very much.  
  
I was afraid I would never get out of that basement, it was more secure than a prison cell. At least that is what I thought for the longest stretch of my imprisonment. She never opened the door, not for any reason. I had to survive down there, and using the septic system as part of an escape plan didn't occur to me until later.  
  
My first concern was food. Every day, if I gave her my things in a bundle and kept myself clean she would give me water. Then she'd give me a sermon in her own language and translate it into English - a little bit more each day. I picked up gradually that she had me mistaken for someone who had killed her daughter somehow, and now she was having her revenge. I wouldn't eat unless I played with the girl's toys. At first I refused, but hunger soon prevailed.  
  
Over time I had nothing else to do down there in the blank void of darkness, where it was not day or night, and the world had forgotten me in a silent tomb beneath the Earth. Barbie and the Powerpuff plushies and the My Little Pony creatures were my only friends.  
  
That is when the terror of losing my mind began to seep in. I was no longer doing voices for these effeminate characters, but rather I was hearing them speak. I looked up and for a second, I saw something in the shadows, some kind of gray thing of ribs caked in clay and worms hunched there and its jaw was slowly moving as the dolls spoke. It was gone, but the smell of it lingered in the air from then on. I found the wriggling things and took their protein as sustenance.  
  
I trembled as I awaited another visit, terrified of the thought that it might not leave. My captor asked me in a strained whisper, "Have you seen her yet?"  
  
Shaking I pointed to the darkening stain I was trapped with. I was too scared to say anything, and sweat beaded on my forehead. The vengeful mother looked and saw only an echo of her daughter fading there in the chthonian darkness. "She will come again."  
  
Then she repeated those same words in a zealous shriek where I had almost not heard the fabric of her first lip-moving whisper.  
  
"It is time to see what Stacie is doing, I bet she has to clean all the hairbrushes after what she said at Night Light's party." I heard one of the dolls saying. I looked and it was moving jerkily across the floor, as though each leg was held and moved by a scooting child. Perhaps an invisible ghost, giving me cold chills as I discovered its presence. The thought of it there, beyond my senses, could not be ignored. I was trapped down there with it. The doll was ambulating.  
  
In a rash of terror, I lashed out defensively and knocked the doll across the floor. I thought I would be confronted by the face of grave horror of the rotting corpse of the child, but instead she just laughed at me, and I could not see her.  
  
I fainted from my panic, unable to endure it past a certain point. My eyes opened and I could not fear the child's ghost any longer. I had somehow realized in the dreams I could not remember, that she was not dangerous, and not to be feared.  
  
Rather it was the thing that used to be a woman that was in the kitchen sharpening a knife that I should fear. The knife? No, that was just to chop vegetables. She wasn't going to cut me, this wasn't amateur hour for her. She wanted me to suffer forever down there in the dark.  
  
Some weird part of me actually felt sorry for her.  
  
Anyway, she already knew, being a mom who had lost her girl child, that physical pain was nothing compared to psychological pain. I had a moment of clarity, somewhere in my cracking mind, and I knew I'd rather be set on fire than undergo any more of her oubliette. I was going to stay down there until I knew nothing else. My body might live on, but my mind would be shattered. I could tell it was happening, things were obvious for a moment.  
  
Then I felt normal, after that brief self-realization. I felt afraid of the dark, a dark I was trapped in, and I feared my captor, who seemed to have god like power after all that time down there. But I was sure I wasn't going crazy, I just suddenly wasn't bothered by a lot of different things.  
  
I no longer worried about who I was before, because I had become the audience of the dolls.  
  
I was not predisposed to caring about food or water or anything but the dolls and the ponies, and fearing the dark.  
  
There was also another voice, a god to fear in the darkness. Will there be food - have you played with the dolls? I have - yes, so you shall eat. It was a realm where god was feared by all men, and men ruled above the Barbie and the Pony and the Powerpuff, but in the edge of light, for beyond is the darkness, in which dwell the dead. The dead belong to god's anger.  
  
And god's anger makes my whole world this hell - a mind-screaming silence, a numb paralyisis of endless terror at the reality of belonging to someone who can only feel hate. A god of hatred, and hunger.  
  
Never enough to eat, you see.  
  
It all goes down that hole, there's the other way out.  
  
Was it madness that overwhelmed my fear of the wrath of god?  
  
Yes, yes it was.  
  
I found the power to put my friends, one by one, piece by piece, down there, down to the next level of Hell. I was laughing while I did it, because the cries of the dead had become comical. Perhaps they were encouraging me, tired of watching me suffer.  
  
When I turned I saw her there as she was in life, somehow angelic and glowing. She smiled for a moment and I knew I'd have her assistance when the moment of dread came for me. The door opened and I saw the needle in one hand and then the brightness of her light was in my eyes, blinding me as she rushed at me.  
  
But there was no venomous prick. No, somehow my madness was not illusion, making it the worst kind of madness.  
  
"Just go." She gasped, having stuck the needle into her own cheek on reflex at the apparition's beaming sentience. I thought about helping her but felt the fatigue that might stop me from climbing the stairs with my own body, let alone hers.  
  
I didn't close that door and lock her down there. I thought I did, and I looked back and saw that I hadn't. I could hear her coming up the stairs. It sounded more difficult than when I came up the stairs.  
  
I limped to the vegetable knife that was razor sharp and got it equipped in both shaking hands. I was scared to peeing my rags, as I saw her crawling towards me. Before I'd gone into her dungeon and lived as her guest for enough of her daughter's birthdays that the girl would be all grown up, I was a pretty husky guy.  
  
Now I was a skeleton, barely able to hold up the knife with two hands. I was so scared of her that I was backing away, although I still hated her. I thought about Cupid, and I changed how I was holding the knife.  
  
I resolved to stab her, although I didn't. I didn't have it in me. Part of me had wanted to kill her for a long time, but seeing her crawl towards me like some kind of killer Terminator reminded me I felt sorry for her. I Stockholm Syndrome stabbed the knife into the cutting board instead of my captor, and I found a phone and called for an ambulance for her and the police to come protect me from her.  
  
"What are you doing?" She looked at me from the floor, confused. Her eyes were blurry, she wasn't sure she was seeing or hearing things correctly.  
  
I set down the pink toy Barbie phone and looked at it again. I had heard the operator. There was no way I was that far gone. I shrugged and got up and walked outside into the burning sun skies of Los Angeles.  
  
Just then a dog walker on skates with some kind of electronic harness released Cupid from the pack and she came running up to me. She licked my face, she had never forgot me.  
  
We were walking along eating all the good stuff out of people's garbage cans when the dog catcher had to get punched by me. I didn't hit him that hard, he's just a wimp and took it too far. So, I was arrested, but then they brought in the FBI because I was missing for so long.  
  
That's how I found out I wasn't crazy and how she had taken me instead of her real target, only she didn't know the difference. They told me she had moved to San Franciso with extensive connections to conceal her from authorities. I was given back Cupid and we were given to the US Marshals, who removed two chips from Cupid, and then we spent a year off the grid before I could have any kind of life again.  
  
I still keep my location a secret, in case those bad people out there want to get me and put me in a dark place again.
