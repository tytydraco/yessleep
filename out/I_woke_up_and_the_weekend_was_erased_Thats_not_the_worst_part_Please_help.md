I’m typing this from the driver seat of my own car while stuck in a parking lot.

I am exhausted and my hands are shaking so bad the autocorrect is basically writing half of this for me.

Four weeks ago, just another tiring Thursday night, I was lying in bed scrolling my phone.

The calendar widget said Thursday.

I remember thinking,

“Two more minutes and it’s finally Friday. Thank God it’s almost Friday.”

I literally watched the clock tick over to 12:00 AM, and my phone said Monday.

Not Friday. Not Saturday. Monday.

I thought it couldn’t be true that I had blacked out for three straight days. But it was just Monday 12:01 AM. It felt like that weird sensation of losing or gaining one hour because of the daylight saving time thingy.

At first, I thought I must have gotten confused (otherwise, what else could it be?), so I ignored what happned, but now I am posting this to let you guys know that this is NOT normal.

It’s been the same every week since.

Every time my phone says Thursday and the clock hits 12:00 AM, I close my eyes and wake up to Monday.

On the second week of this madness, I finally asked Thomaz, the Brazilian guy on the same floor:

“Hey man, did I miss work last Friday? I think I might’ve been sick or something.”

He looked at me like I’d grown a second head.

“What are you talking about? What’s Friday?”

I nervously asked him again. “You know… Friday? The day after Thursday? Before Saturday?”

He just stared. Then chuckled like I was messing with him. “Friday? Is that like… Triday? Or… I don't know, Wemday? Stop making up words, man. We have a meeting in ten minutes.”

Shocking.

I tried Hillary next. Same thing.

Robert, the developer guy. Supriya. My boss. The barista in the Main Street café (we call the lobby floor area Main Strete for some reason).

None of them knew what Friday was. None of them knew Saturday. None of them knew Sunday.

They all gave me the same confused, slightly pitying look. “You okay, Matt? You’re acting really weird today.”

This can't be True. Even God rested i thougut. 

I pulled out my phone and opened the Bible app (needed to install). I remembered Genesis—God worked six days and rested on the seventh. I needed proof the weekend was supposed to exist. I scrolled to chapter 2 (I thought I at least know Genesis a little bit).

“And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested…” Yes. That’s the verse I tried to find.

But the text on my screen said something else.

“…and after the fourth day the Man continued his labor.”

I refreshed. same thing. I closed the app, reopened it. Same edited verse.

Man? Not God? And continued to labor?

I googled “Genesis 2:2” and every site said the same lie (or I am crazy): the Man never stopped working.

Ok. Then if there is no Sunday, when do you do the church mass or services (I am Catholic—if you know what that means)?

I tried searching “catholic church near me.” Nothing. No results. Not even old abandoned ones.

I asked Siri: “What day do people go to church?”

She answered: “church is not a modern English word, but it is rarely used to describe a place where people sometimes gather to share inspiring personal stories, but there is no designated building or day for that.”

I said out loud, “Church. You know, mass? Worship? Jesus?”

The barista looked up from steaming milk and said, “Jesus? Like… that Mediterranean folk story? That’s just mythology, hon. Cute, though.”

I almost dropped my coffee.

I opened my calendar app. Every week is just Monday → Tuesday → Wednesday → Thursday → Monday. No Friday. No Saturday. No Sunday. No Christmas. No Easter. No nothing.

I called my mom. She answered cheerful like always.

“Mom, do you remember weekends? Like… days off?”

She laughed. “Days off? Sweetie, everybody works. That’s how it’s always been. You feeling okay?”

I hung up and escaped my office and now I am sitting in my car in the parking ramp for twenty minutes trying not to hyperventilate.

The worst part isn’t that I lost my weekend.

The worst part isn’t that I’m the only one who remembers it ever existed.

The worst part is there is no God in this world.

I miss sleeping until late noon.

I miss “Thank God it’s Friday.”

I miss the park I used to take a stroll on during the weekends.

I keep feeling this phantom ache—like my soul is mourning something the rest of the world never had.

Today is Thursday, and I will wake up on Monday morning again.

i’m scared.

But I am not sure if God will hear my prayer in a world where there is no God in the Bible.

…what happens when the week never ends?

If you’re reading this and you remember Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—please. Please tell me I’m not alone.

today is Wednesday... please tell me day after tomorrow will be Friday.
