One of you reading this will be dead by tomorrow. I am sorry, I really am. But I’m just the messenger. And I take no pleasure in telling you this because once you die, I will be next.

See, I know the future. Well I get told the future sporadically. Every now and then a woman’s voice will whisper to me. A cold brush of air that travels into my ear and burrows itself into every nerve. Sometimes it's little things, meaningless things, like my neighbor will be wearing red today. Other times it's more important things. The reason I met my current girlfriend is because the woman told me I would if I went to the coffee shop across town on this day at this time. And there she was. After that I never doubted my invisible companion.

This is the first I have ever told anyone about her though. I know I would sound crazy trying to explain this so I don’t. But now I have no choice. And if you could prove that I am in fact just crazy, please do so. Because I wish it were that easy. 

I’ve built up an image of this woman in my mind over the years. She’s omnipresent. Maybe she’s God. Maybe I’m chosen. Or maybe even I’m just mentally ill and none of this is real. Except she’s never told me a lie. She is always proven right. And this morning I was awoken by her invisible caress telling me that yes, one of you will die soon. So be careful. It involves a car. I don’t want to say much more because my intent is not to frighten you. It would be a good idea to stay inside today, just take it easy. I know one way or another you won’t be able to though, you will eventually have to go outside. That’s when it will happen. Even worse for me, she told me that I’m next. It’s finally my time. She got very specific with what will happen to me. Didn’t leave out a single detail. She sounded sad as she told me, but promised that I could finally join her. Join her where? I’m not sure and I don’t think I want to know. 

I really hope she’s wrong about this. I know we don’t know each other but I don’t want you to die. More selfishly, I don't want to die. I need to find you, whoever you are. The woman said we don’t know each other, so if we did, maybe we could change things and stop this. Please. I’m starting to get scared. She’s been talking to me more frequently. Taunting me about it. No longer is she feigning sadness, she’s looking forward to this. That’s how I now know she’s no god or some higher authority. This is personal for her and that means the outcome can be changed. I won’t let her win. You and me, our fates are not sealed yet. Let’s find another way.
