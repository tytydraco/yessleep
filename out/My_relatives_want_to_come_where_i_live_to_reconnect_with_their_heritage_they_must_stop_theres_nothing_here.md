La morte verrà all'improvviso
Death will come unexpected 

Avrà le tue labbra e i tuoi occhi
She'll take your lips and your eyes

Ti coprirà d'un velo bianco 
She'll cover you with a white veil

Addormentandosi al tuo fianco
She'll fell asleep by your side

La morte va a colpo sicuro 
Death never fails

Non suona il corno nè il tamburo
She doesn't play horns nor drums

Madonna che in limpida fonte
Mylady who in a clean stream

Ristori le membra stupende
You rest your beautiful limbs

La morte non ti vedrà in faccia
Death won't look you in the face

Avrà il tuo seno e le tue braccia 
She'll take your breasts and your arms
 
Do you like it? De André made a readaptation of this song but the original text is as old as the little church of the village where i live.
2000 people, a piazza smaller than a grocery store park and a 1300 years old church all of this 40 minutes away from a proper civilized place, up on the hills of the lower Appennino Emiliano Romagnolo. I live here and as my description stated there's nothing here, so why the hell did our American relatives choose to visit this instead of the many more interesting places of Italy?

For all my life they were just the "patacca cousins who ran away from the Duce" my grandpa resented them for this, they did not stay and fight with the resistance like him. He never told me anything, where they came from, what their names were and got mad when they were mentioned.

Then one day grandpa died and his hated relatives too. Their grandsons one day woke up and discovered they didn't know anything about where grandpa came from and contacted us. I don't know how exactly did they manage that but they find our address and sent a letter in a mix of english and google translated italian. After checking up and verify they were indeed our relatives and not a nigeran prince who wants to deposit something on our bank account we gave them a number to text to, my number.

I am the only one on the family that speaks a decent english so i had the task to translate, chat and answer whatever questions the "patacca cousins" might've asked. 
It was fine, i didn't mind it, i taught them a couple of words, how to curse, some blasphemy and that ravioli and tortelli were two different things. 
One day they told us they were planning to visit their grandfather's home (wich is our great ball busting job to keep from collapsing by the way) to "rediscover our roots". 

They can't form a sentence, they don't know dialect and the peak of tradition for them is makig tortellini for christmas (also those aren't tortellini! They are called cappelletti!). I tried to tell them off, i even offered to take them for a tour of Bologna or Rimini or Ravenna and taking a 2 hours train ride but nope. Grandpa's shitty village it is.

Now, as i said, there's Nothing here. And we'd like to keep it as it is because, if Something would be here that would be a trouble for everyone.

I'll be as directed as i can, take this however you want but it's a fact: everyday and everynight, 24/7 Something roams the streets, and it's not human.
It never talks, never stops, never does anything but walking. It can happen however that It could knock on your door at night. If that happens let It enter.
It'll sit at your table, you'll have to offer It something, it doesn't matter what, he won't take it. After a few minutes It'll get up and lie on your bed for a couple of minutes, them It'll thank you and leave. 

You can talk to It but it is not a good idea, whatever you'll tell It doesn't matter, It'll take your words as a wish, take what you offered earlier and leave, your wish will come true, even if you just asked who was he, and no one knows what It actually wants as a payiment (that's why it's not a good idea to try this).
Don't ever try to talk to It on the streets. You'll die. Plain and simple.

But what you must, under no circumstances, do is not open the door. My cousins's granpa was dumb enough to try this shit. 
My grandma told me what happened: everybody in the village had to leave an animal outside of their door in the night. Her family was poor and she had to leave her hedgehog outside, she loved that little guy. After that night anybody who didn't leave an animal outside disappeared, their houses were a mess but no one was inside. She still remembered the screams that followed in the nights, 3 nights of screaming, yelling and pleading. When she got dementia she saw those night again and again. I am she is now in peace.

I don't know how exactly he did survive that, but it must've been part of why he left Italy. I don't want his offsprings to come here and cause another mess but i surely as hell can't tell them "your granpa angered death itself and if you come here i am sure you'll be next on the list". What am i supposed to do? I can't just tell them to ignore the mysterious clearly non human figure that will knock on their door, and i am sure that will happen. My granfather asked that last time It knocked on his door. The answer he recived was "cerco tuo fratello. Il pagamento sono i suoi discendenti" "i am looking for your brother. I want his descendants".

If you are reading this don't come here. There's nothing here.
