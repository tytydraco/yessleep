But before I get into how I am determining this, or rather to help you understand how I came to this conclusion, lemme give you some backstory and lead-up to finding the box.

Apologies in advance, too, for how I write, especially if it seems scattered or confusing. I have ADHD, and I tend to type as things are happening/like I'm speaking. It just helps my process, I think. I can't focus too much on prose or I'll never get anything typed.

So this past weekend, my family and I (and by family, I mean my parents, 5 adult siblings and any of their SOs and children they have, plus my one aunt that lives with us (we are Catholic. Or raised Catholic, at least, if you're wondering)), went on a family vacation. Partially because it was something my mom always wanted to do with us since we were kids, and partially for a reason I'm not fully comfortable talking about. All this to say, we were away for the weekend, and our house was locked. Only my one uncle that lives nearby has a key, and he only checks in and also does stuff with his plants and other stuff outside (he's a botanist, for reference). I asked him about the box of files; he had no idea what I was talking about.

The second part of this is that I live in-- what is essentially-- the attic, up on the third floor. Albeit refurbished to be a bedroom. There IS a door to get to what is the "proper" attic space/the part of the attic not considered my living space. That's where I found the box when I was putting suitcases away for my mother. I asked my mom what it was and if it was hers. She didn't know what the box or papers were  either. She doesn't remember seeing the box in there before, and neither do I. I was in the attic to get suitcases before we left, and I swear I didn't see it. And no one apart from immediate family would really know the storage space is there if they didn't live here. There's a pole that goes high across that door to hang my clothes and coats and things, so that door is actually partially  hidden.

The box was in this attic space, stacked on top of some other stuff in this small, already well-packed room. How I found out they were case files of some sort was because I accidentally knocked the box over and sent the contents tumbling. I just thought it was more stuff/junk that was being stored; my initial guess was tax papers or something, but I looked over the papers a bit more carefully as I was picking everything up and realized they were case files. My knocking-the-box-over didn't help, but the contents of the box were already in disarray, as far as I could tell. Nothing was in order, and I really couldn't have bothered in that moment to deal with organizing or making sense of the contents beyond my cursory glance.

Later on, I brought the whole box downstairs and let my mom have a look, to see if it was something she recognized. She didn't (perhaps obviously, or else we wouldn't be here), and she set about asking my siblings about it. Meanwhile, the files themselves caught my attention when I did take time to examine them some more. The few I did read reference things that have happened, but... differently. I thought maybe they were some kind of unfiction project someone in my family was working on, but the only writer/writer-adjacent person in my family is my oldest sister (besides me, kind of). Not only does she not have time to make something like this, being a mother and college professor, but she only got here a week ago with her family in tow, with the intention of leaving at the end of the month to go move into their new place. They're staying in a camper, so they don't have a reason to move things into the house.

Anyway, what gave me the feeling that these might be from an alternate dimension and possibly legit was a particular document that was dated three days ahead of when I found the box (the document was from today, Thursday Feb 20th (although I guess by the time I'm posting, yesterday) to be even more precise, so I found the box on the 17th). As though it already happened, even though this is something kind of still actively happening. It doesn't entirely make sense, but I'll sum it up.

The document in question regards a group called the Yizians. No, that's not a typo, but they are very strikingly similar to the Zizians. Same people, same incidences (the killings, fake deaths, and whatnot), just slightly different. Where it wildly departs is that, according to this document, these Yizians opened a portal and escaped imprisonment with the assistance of "retro-evolved isopod-folk wielding quasi-quantum revolvers". There's a remark on the file about tracking which facet of Existence (yes, with a capital E) they slipped into, because the file also states that the retro-evolved isopod-folk are not a registered Earth species, and to look into what kind of sound like star systems they could've have come from.

Obviously, very bizarre. And obviously something that didn't happen. Here, at least. It's a stark contrast to what HAS happened here. Yet, there's a feeling I can't shake when I'm looking at these documents that I probably shouldn't be looking at them. That they __are__ legit. There's no markers on the papers that indicate that I shouldn't be looking at them or have them, but... like, who would I even turn these in to?

Either way, happening across that file had me wanting to look more closely at everything else. I'd like to determine how I can at least organize everything.

I'm shaking a bit as I'm typing and thinking about it this.  Not out of fear, but... excitement, maybe? It's also cold and we live in a very old house (180 years at this rate, if i remember right), so there's that. But exciting nonetheless.

(Well, fear might be a factor, as I'm thinking about it. Like... WHERE did the Yizians and the isopod-people go? And what does that file mean about "Existence"? Because if this is all legit, I can only imagine it means they could be anywhere.... and now I'm paranoid. )

I'll pick a couple of cases and skim them over to give you guys an idea of what else I've found. Some files I've read so far are a bit bizarre, some very bizarre, some admittedly are a bit boring (I find them interesting? But I have to look up what events they're referencing). One or two that I was looking at were kind of recent? In like the past few years, at least.

Alright, so here's a couple of the more recent cases I'm going with:

The first case I looked over that is strangely adjacent involves everyone's favorite death machine: OceanGate Titan. The janky submarine that imploded when making a trip down to the Titanic. Only this document mentions an EXplosion, rather than an IMplosion. A seemingly minor difference, but it's meaningful because the document mentions "something" caused it, due to a large puncture that could be found when the pieces of the craft were pieced together. Which also mentions other files by distinctive codes that I don't have figured out yet (and that I can't find due to the haphazard way everything was stored). It mentions these other cases because this large puncture to the craft isn't unique, and has appeared on other seafaring vessels and on ocean structures briefly mentioned as examples, all of which are mentioned in this document as also being destroyed by some kind of explosion. I guess worryingly, the document mentions that the "something" hasn't been determined yet, or for any of the other incidents. Another minor detail I might as well mention is that the names of the passengers in the Titan are also different. The pilot is the same, but the passengers that paid to be on the vessel? Totally different. Otherwise, the date and times are the same (like when they departed, when the Coast Guard was called, etc).

The next document I found that caught my eye was more local to my state. I live in the US, just as an FYI.

This one involves an amusement ride pier in Ocean City, NJ called Gillian's Wonderland Pier. If you've ever vacationed down at the Jersey Shore, you may be familiar with it. Ocean City is among the most popular beach towns in South Jersey. You may also be aware that Gillian's Wonderland Pier permanently closed this past year (October 13, 2024). But you can also look this up.

Well, this document makes mention of an incident on August 24th, 2023, that involved a massive fire that that started at Gillian's Wonderland Pier and burned down a portion of the boardwalk it is/was on, as well as a few businesses on and near to the Pier. The cause is unknown, but the file makes mention of a trail of human footprints burned into the planks of the boardwalk. The trail leads towards the beach, where the trail continued with patches of crudely melted sand, heading towards and ending at the ocean's wake. It's noted that the tracks clearly show someone walking barefoot, but nothing else has been found. Eyewitness reports state that there was someone on fire, but that the blaze above them was massive. Something the file also reports is that the tracks also indicate a long stride, possibly indicating that this thing was either massive, or was possibly running (maybe both (per the file)).

I don't think I have to mention that it didn't burn down. I could drive there now and get photographs of the place (but its also late, so that's a hard pass). Plus, a disaster like that affecting a popular shore town in the summer before Labor Day of any year would've been big news for the region. Nevermind the fact that someone was on fire and the weird things mentioned in the document.

I'm sitting here, looking at this box and the scattered papers, and I think I'm going to give this a break for now. I don't think I'm AS convinced as I was before. It's still interesting, but these alternate events are kind of hard to believe. I still can't shake the feeling these have some credibility, though. There's no explanation on how this box and all these papers wound up in the attic. And if there is some truth to these, then maybe this box slipped between dimensions, somehow? It kind of has me scared to even go up to my room, at this rate.

I'll give ya'll an update when I look at these again. It's still interesting, and I've admittedly got nothing better to do with my life, at the moment. Till next time.
