I have to tell someone this. I’ve tried my best to just stuff this memory down deep in my mind by just not talking about it to anyone but my therapist but I just can't anymore, I can’t pretend. Maybe I’m being too dramatic but I still wake up in cold sweats every couple of days. I need to talk about it.

I used to live in a small house about 4-5 years ago, the house wasn't in a massive city by all means but the city I lived in then wasn’t small either. I'm new to sharing stuff like this online and I’ll keep as much information as I can private for my own well being. Back then I rented this house from a friend of my parents. It wasn't the best, it was in a middle of the road trashy neighborhood with a break-in problem every other month for all 10 months I was there and the occasional two or three drug addicts you’ll see wandering the streets in a small southern city just asking for lighters and gum. 

I at least got a discount and I could bring my pet because the owner knew my parents from all the way back in high school and at the time as a broke college student I wasn't going to complain. I thought it wasn’t the worst decision back then, I mean it was really close to my campus but after this experience I regret it wholeheartedly. I type this to make it feel less real as this experience still bothers me to this day.

I had lived there for 8 months at this point. It was a smaller sized two-story house with a pretty big living room and a half of a hotel room sized upstairs with a banister overlooking the living room. 

The living room itself was really tall because the upstairs only took up the right side of the house. I had this smart TV on the living room wall and a coffee table I used in front of it. Most of the time that coffee table held cheap empty beer bottles and plates of spaghetti, my dog Isaiah loved sleeping under the small thing even though he was almost too big to fit under it. 

Isaiah was an English Cocker Spaniel who my parents had taken in when I was 14. He loved playing around with me in that house. Off topic I know but I'm trying to remember details.

Underneath the upstairs was the kitchen and inside of it was the pantry. It was about the size of a small closet but at the time I probably didn’t know that, I hardly used the thing. Every grocery store product I bought either sat on the tiny kitchen island, inside the old rusty fridge, or the cabinets so I had no use for it. My dog would love hiding in it though, those times finding him would give me a near panic attack because I always thought he had found a way out of the house.

Now between both rooms and in the middle of the house was a pillar and to the left of the pillar facing the living room was an old worn-down, wooden spiral staircase. It creaked like a banshee every step you would take on it. At the top of the stairs was the upstairs banister that acted like a hallway connecting the already connected two rooms in the upstairs. 

The bedroom and the “extra room” as I called it were on separate sides but both rooms were connected within them by a small hallway shaped like an archway. My bed was nothing much, I mean it was an un-sheeted mattress with symmetrical flower designs imprinted on the fabric. 

That extra room wasn’t really used for anything besides getting to the small bathroom connected to it, in fact it was the only way to the bathroom. I used it like an attic or basement, only using it for storing old pictures and antiques. All of this is needed I swear.

Writing this, it's all starting to flow back, all these vivid and small details. 

That day I had just gotten off work and made a cup of coffee. That was my daily routine: go to work, get home, make coffee, and relax. After I finished my cup I quickly cleaned it and put it up. After that I sat on the couch only I was just slightly less tired than usual. Isaiah crawled on my lap and nuzzled up to me. I sat and pet him while on my phone.  It was only a couple hours until dark but I thought about taking a nap. 

As I sat there I felt my phone vibrate, It was my friend Craig. He asked if I wanted to join the group going out bar hopping that night. It had been awhile and I missed hanging with the guys so I decided to go. I got my coat and headed out the door. On my way out I made sure to give Isaiah some love before I left.

That whole night was a blast and I remember it well, I only had a couple drinks and had an admittedly pretty heavy buzz going. It was filled with laughter, dumb jokes and just an overall carefree attitude, I miss it so much. I never had a second thought that that night could be ruined. I drove home from the bars we drank dry still with a smile on my face. I know it probably wasn’t safe but I wasn't the smartest back then.

When I got home and walked to the door I realized something strange. My door was unlocked. In my buzzed state I just brushed it off as a sloppy mistake from earlier. I was tired and maybe I just forgot. But as I walked in I became privy to the fact that yep, this night could be ruined. 

I sobered up fast looking into the place. As I stepped in I looked at my completely trashed living room. My coffee table was flipped, beer bottles smashed, and my trash can had been ransacked. My couch cushions were scratched and torn open, spilling cotton, and different objects decorated the scratched floor. 

In the kitchen my plates and silverware were smashed and spread out on the tiled floor and my floor was dented and cracked by objects being thrown down extremely hard. My fridge was left open, half my drinks were opened and drank from, and food was left out on the counter and even the floor. Most of my cabinets and drawers had been ransacked, hell even my useless pantry was. 

My pure shock turned to utter frustration. I thought to myself, “Of course-a damn break-in!” I stomped loudly to the kitchen and put the food I could save back in the fridge, I threw out the drinks, I wasn’t drinking after some junkie. I was too pissed to even clean the silverware but I did see from the corner of my eye that all the kitchen knives were missing. I thought whoever broke in had probably just strung it on the floor but I never saw that or maybe they had the gall to steal them to sell, who knows. I decided I needed to check upstairs to see the damage, so I started walking up the steps.

I couldn’t even hear the screeching steps my foggy haze of anger had completely clouded me. I’m sure I sounded like a bull coming up those stairs. I kept stomping to the bedroom furious as to what I might see.

I got to the bedroom door and swung it open with a violent force. Only to feel a wave of horror hit my gut like a bullet. My stomach churned as my heart sank like an anchor, my angry breathing was cut off in shock. The bedroom lights were off and standing over my bed was a man. He never left my house… 

It had never even crossed my mind that he could still be here. The man must have been 6 feet tall and he was just standing there right next to the pillows on the bed. All that noise I made should have alerted him but no, I still don’t know how it didn’t or maybe it did I don’t know. He faced the wall of the bedroom, a blank stare and chilling smile formed on the side of his face I could see. I could only make out certain details in the dark but his smile was just there, like there was no happiness or malice behind it, it was numb and void of all emotion. Nearly covering his smile was a scruffy unkempt beard with stains of blood in it and a balding head with barely any hair left. He wore a dirt stained baggy dark grey t-shirt and light brown cargo pants with black stains and streaks along them. Afterwards I would realize he had no shoes on and his feet were bloody and leaving bloody footprints on the bedroom carpet. 

He had wrinkly grey skin with brown and yellow bruises on his arms. I slowly scanned him and saw his right arm. A massive wound on his wrist still spurting blood like a water gun was there, I could see his bone jutting through and chisel marks along the bone as if… a dog had bit him. 

“Isaiah, where was Isaiah?” Questions ran through my head. “Why wasn’t he the first thing you checked for!” Questions ran through my head. “Where is he? Is he hurt?” Questions ran through my head. I looked behind the man and onto the floor. “Please no… oh god no.” 

My questions had been answered.

Lying on the blood stained carpet was Isaiah, every knife from the kitchen protruding from his body. He had one long cut in the middle of his back that went around his whole body similar to a bisector. The blades stuck into him like nails in a board were placed in a symmetrical pattern almost like a rorschach test picture. The image of it still haunts me whenever I close my eyes.

I felt tears swell up in my eyes as I looked back up at the man, he was now facing me. His head cocked towards me but his eyes were transfixed on the mattress. His eyes scanned the mattress impossibly fast and he scanned so many times, I thought he was counting nanometers. I looked closer into his eyes. They were bloodshot with such big blood vessels I thought they would blow up in his head like water balloons. His pupils were abyssal pits of black that seemed to swallow most of the eye. The horribly dilated circles stood still in an instant still hyper fixated on the mattress. His jaw began to move back and forth and he parted his lips more revealing sickly yellow and black teeth grinding together, no not together, on something. A piece of flesh sat in between his top row and bottom row but not from my dog. Human flesh.

I scanned the man once more and realized his right arm wasn’t the only one gushing blood, his left was too with another bite mark but not from a dog, from himself.

His teeth continued grinding against the meat as my stomach tied and tears spilled from my eyes. The teeth kept cutting and cutting into the flesh in his mouth until he cut the piece in half. One half fell from his lip and the other flopped out slowly from his agape jaws onto the bed. He slowly reached out his hands without moving his eyes and pushed the two pieces side by side. His neck creaked to the side sounding like a firecracker as if to show he had seen something intriguing. His teeth kept grinding together and even chattering as his eyes lit up when he saw the two pieces on the bed.

He began making a "tisk tisk tisk" sound as if stuttering on words. I wish he never got the words out. He spoke for the first and only time. “Symmetry”

I slowly backed up onto the balcony with the knot tied in my stomach growing tighter by the second. The danger I was now in spun in my mind at that moment, almost making me dizzy. My heart beat like a drum as I thought of the man pulling a knife or lunging at me but he didn’t, he just kept looking at the bed as if it was the most beautiful thing in the world. I slowly closed the door with grace so as to not make noise and headed to the steps. Then it hit me. The creaky steps…

My heart pounded even harder in my chest, feeling like it was gonna pop out as I thought to myself, “Did he see me, didn’t he cock his head at you?” It didn’t matter, I had to go. I took my first steps down the stairs. When my foot hit the stairs it made a slight squeak as I put my weight on it. As I took step after step down It got louder and louder. When the stairs hit its loudest It sounded like a wailing baby interrupting a room of silence. I could hear my heart throbbing in my ears at this point and once I took that last step I heard it. The old bed upstairs creaking. That's when the pure horror of the situation hit my mind. He could come out of the bedroom in two ways, he could have a weapon or even a gun, what if he saw me or heard me, what if he? All of those horrific situations rushed through my head as I quietly made my way to the pantry and shut myself inside. I sat hiding in there, tears streaming and a lump in my throat aching. “I wish Isaiah was here with me.”

As I hid in the corner terrified I pulled out my phone and dialed 911. As I was on the phone I could still hear movement from the bedroom and maybe even the attached room. I was lucky that day as a patrol car was only a couple blocks away from my house.

When the cop arrived he already knew where I was and told me to stay downstairs although I did come out of the pantry. He made his way up the stairs and entered the bedroom while I watched from the living room. I saw his flashlight click on and heard a groan that I assumed was the man. I heard the police officer's voice but the man didn’t even respond or put up a fight.

The cop put him in cuffs and walked him out to the car. He put the man in the backseat and got my statement. After that I went to stay in a motel. 

Only sitting on that hotel bed did a train of thoughts hit me but out of them all one hit hardest. My Isaiah was… I cried and cried that night until the sun rose. After that I called some friends and stayed over at their places. I don’t remember much else as I just stayed hammered for that week. Losing an animal from your childhood can crush you. By the time I got home everything had been cleaned and I had been notified where my friends had buried my dog. They helped me so much, they even picked a nice tree to bury him under. 

That night I couldn’t sleep even with a new mattress and new locks on all the doors and windows. Rolling over and looking at the floor I could see the red stains in the carpet. This blob of red and footprints pointing me in the eyes. Sometimes I saw this massive puddle almost like an outline of Isaiah and the man walking away after he was finished, I balled myself to sleep those nights. 

2 months later my parents friend let me off the lease, I couldn’t sleep anymore at that point. His face still flickered in my mind, I still checked every room in my house even after I moved shortly after. I still do.

Afterwards I found out from one of my dad’s friends who knew the cop who responded to my call that the man was incredibly dangerous and had been wanted for killing a woman outside of her apartment in the building hallway the same way he had my dog. He had major mental issues and was on multiple substances the night he broke in. The man couldn’t even remember his name according to the cop. 

Although therapy has helped I still blame myself. Why wasn’t he the first thing I looked for? Why? I’m to blame for Isaiah. Maybe if I was home sooner…or if… I don’t know. I hurt a lot and I miss my pup. I love you Isaiah.

My nightmares consist of me being paralyzed in bed even in my new house and that horrific man standing over me grinding his teeth and looking at me. He bites into me making symmetrical marks along my body and carves symbols into my stomach with his bare and still bleeding hands. He runs his fingers across the deep cuts on my body checking for perfection. He gets to my face and sticks his fingers in my mouth grasping my jaw. He pulls his mouth to my ear and I smell his breath, It smells of death. He whispers in my ear softly with glee in his voice.

“Symmetry.”
