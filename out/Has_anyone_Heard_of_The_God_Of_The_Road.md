Hello, i simply go by 0cu-1u5 online. Im wondering if anyone else has had an experience with the so called "God Of the Road". I was 17 when I discovered it. it was a dumb bet. Go and explore an old parking lot behind an old Hotel. Everyone in school said that the place was cursed or haunted. I wish I believed them then.

At about eleven o'clock I got to the parking lot with my friends. The dare was simple, stay the night in the parking lot, if I did I’d get $50, it sounded like free money at the time. I set up my sleeping bag then turned on an electric lamp and looked around. The place was a dump, graffiti, trash, old broken down cars, pretty much what you'd expect from a parking lot no one used for years. But then I saw it, that damn car. It was an old Roadrunner, though it was clearly modded. I think it had a spoiler and definitely a hood scoop, but that's not what made it stand out. It was pristine. Not a dent, scratch, spot of rust, not even dust. It looked like brand new, shiny black paint and all. The only thing out of place was the front of the car, the driver's side of the bumper, and the headlights were splattered with red. I didn't piece it together at first, but it was blood. Old dried blood. Sticking to the car like a permanent stain. And its license plate read “G0D0FRD”.

Of course though like the idiot I was, I checked it out. Tried to open the door and to my shock it actually opened. Just like the outside, the inside was perfect, it didn't even smell. Red leather seats, fuzzy dice, fancy stick shift. Looked like something out of a cartoon. I couldn't resist, like I said I was 17, driving was a dream for me, and a car like this well, I just couldn't pass up at least sitting in it. I looked around a bit, like I said, the thing was spotless, but one thing stuck out. In the passenger seat was a license. I picked it up and looked at it, it was for someone named Shawn Haze, i mumbled the name to myself as i read it. That's when hell broke loose.

The radio Suddenly screamed with static as I said the name, I covered my ears and quickly tried to turn it off, turning dials, kicking it, anything to make the static stop. But then I heard it… that voice, the voice in the static, it said “God of the Road”. The door shut and locked, I frantically tried to get it to open. The radio continued screaming with static. I was trapped and defined and no matter how hard I slammed against the door or pulled on the lever it wouldn't open. Again that voice called out, “Drive”, it said. “God of the Road always wins”..

The car suddenly roared to life, its engine rumbling and headlights blaring. “God of the Road always wins,” it said again. “Drive.” I looked at the wheel with hesitation. I reached out and grabbed it. It felt like fire running through me. Like I was being cooked from the inside. I remembered screaming out in pain and when I did the car's engine revved louder. It's crazy to say but, I think the car was hurt by my grabbing the wheel as well. “Drive,” it said again. I was sick of its commands and just did what it said. I put it in drive and peeled out of the parking lot, driving as fast as I could. I was making turns I never thought I could do. The craziest part though. I don't even know how to drive stick.

Before I knew it I was going nearly 180 miles an hour. But still, I was driving perfectly, every turn feeling natural, instinctual even, like I had driven the same path a thousand times. The whole time the radio kept saying the same thing. “God of the Road always wins.”

I don't know how long I was driving, but on the last turn, I saw him. That kid. He ran out into the road. I tried to swerve and then that sound. The sickening thump. I slammed on the brakes and opened the door, quickly jumping out. Before I even peaced together I had gotten out of the car I realized I was back in the parking lot. The car hadn't moved, and the hood was ice cold. There was no one there. Then the radio said one last thing “God of the Road didn't lose a race”

I ran home. Didn’t get the $50, I didn't want it anymore. I looked into the name “Shawn Haze.” turns out he was a drag racer. A good one at that. He had won every race he was in. His son was watching his last race and as his dad crossed the finish, he ran out into the road to celebrate with his dad for another win. Shawn swerved too late. Apparently he killed himself later in life. I know someone haunts that car. I don't know who haunts it though, the son or the dad. But I know I'll never forget this. But I just need to know, has anyone else heard of or even interacted with the do called "God of the Road"?
