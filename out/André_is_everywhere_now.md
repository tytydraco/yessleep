After the episode in 2023 that I told you about in my last post, everything has changed. I feel like I don’t have much time left.

It’s been two months since the night he stood at my door. He repeated the same thing for an entire week. I only managed to sleep properly for two nights during that time.

I remember, on the sixth day, he was there and the light turned on. I saw it under the door and I heard their conversation. He managed to cover it up for Fátima. She must have believed him, half-asleep as she was.

I’m **EXHAUSTED** with all of this. I feel like he’s feeding on my sanity little by little, and I know something horrible is going to happen to me.

I don’t know if it’s going to be today, now, tomorrow—I don’t care anymore. I just know I’m already far away from him (at least I hope so). I stole Fátima’s car two hours ago and I’ve been driving aimlessly ever since. I took all the money I could find, even what wasn’t mine—sorry, Fátima, if you ever read this.

So much has happened in these two months of torture.

He stopped with that door shit after Fátima caught him in the middle of the night. She was sleeping and woke up to the sound of him **slowly knocking his head against my bedroom door.**

“Babe? What’s that?” she said.  
“Nothing, just scrolling on my phone.”

I don’t know what she saw—only what she heard.

Either way, she wouldn’t suspect him. And she definitely wouldn’t believe me.

After that, everything we did together was uncomfortable. I had to hide it from Fátima, but at the same time, I couldn’t relax. During dinners he would stare at me while eating, holding my eyes for way too long. Whenever I lost something, he appeared out of nowhere and handed it back to me, like he had hidden it on purpose. Always staring. Always smiling that creepy, *friendly* smile of his.

Living with the devil for that long, I started noticing the same patterns as before.

He always arrived at our house at 6:30 PM sharp. Always folded clothes the exact same way. Always sat up straight without ever resting his back on the couch. Always chewed on the right side of his mouth. Always took exactly ten minutes in the shower. I don’t think Fátima ever noticed.

One night he started rambling about his past—which was obviously a lie. He invented fake childhood traumas. When he finished, he turned to me:

“And you, dear, do you have any trauma?”

He stared directly into my eyes with that serious face, like he wanted to drag me back to 2023.

Fátima told him to stop, since he already knew the answer.

“Oh! I forgot, my deepest apologies, Clarice.”

Just hearing him say my name makes my skin crawl.

The BIG SHIT started happening when he began leaving our house… and showing up in other places.

Here’s the problem: it wasn’t him. At least, not to other people.

At work, “Samuel” showed up every day at exactly 12:00. Always in a suit and tie. Always perfectly upright posture. Always breathing calmly. Always greeting people with the same exact tone of voice. He was polite to everyone, and everyone loved him.

Whenever I went to the bathroom, grabbed coffee, or returned to my desk—he crossed my path. Always staring into my eyes. Always repeating the same kinds of comments Jonas used to make.

“I love that dress,” he told me once—about a yellow dress I had never worn to work before.

How do you *love* something you’re seeing for the first time?

He bumped into me six times.

And each time:

“My apologies, that wasn’t my intention.”

WITH. THE. EXACT. SAME. TONE.

I know it sounds insane, but wait.

It gets worse.

At the coffee shop I always went to—or *used to*—there was “Emily.”

“Good morning, Clarice.”  
“Good morning, Clarice.”  
“Good morning, Clarice.”  
“Good morning, Clarice.”

Always the same way. Always preparing my coffee. Always serving other customers too.

But whenever she handed me my cup, it was with the same look.  
The same smile.  
The same eyes.

What made me abandon that café was the day “she” handed me my order with the name “André” written on it instead of mine. And she stared at me, waiting for me to notice. The second I did:

“My apologies, that wasn’t my intention.”

I’m not crazy.

The strangest part is that on my very first day at that café, Emily was the most unpleasant barista I had ever met. She never said good morning. She radiated that kind of hate-your-job energy. She looked at her work like it was a punishment. Always serving with a bored, disgusted face.

And then suddenly Jonas turned her into the friendliest woman in the whole neighborhood.

But the grand prize for *fucked-up weirdness* goes to the next one.

And I’ll admit it.

“Jonas” outdid himself.

I don’t own a car. I always walked home. It’s not far, totally doable, and before you think it’s dangerous—the streets in my city are always busy.

For two weeks, at the end of July, there were no signs of him. None. Nothing. I even thought maybe he had found someone else to destroy.

Until I noticed.

Coming home at 6:21 PM, already on my street…

“Neve.”

Everyone knows Thomas’s Siberian Husky. I always pass their gate on my way home.

His dog.

**Staring at me.**

More than usual.

Maybe I’m exaggerating here, but I genuinely don’t know what to believe anymore.

After I noticed the first time, I started noticing it again.

And it happened two more days.

The dog stared at me the exact same way.

Sitting. Tongue out. Watching me without blinking. Not moving her body—only her head and neck, following wherever I went.

It didn’t happen again, because I couldn’t bring myself to walk home anymore. I started taking the bus. It’s slower, but it stops right in front of my house, and the driver’s a friend of my dad’s. I avoid looking at Thomas’s house.

I keep wondering what he did to Emily. I didn’t know Samuel, but I asked myself the same thing.

Does he kill them and then use their identity?

I don’t know. Because the first time, there were *two Andrés* in his house.

What the fuck is he, really?

After everything, I gave in.

I had to.

I started being aggressive with him.

Whenever Samuel spoke to me at work, I would stop and stare back.

He always returned it.

He knew I was afraid.

And I was.

I still am.

But what else could I do?

I started carrying a kitchen knife in my bag when I noticed “Samuel” getting closer to me.

One day, in the middle of a meeting, he sat down beside me and put his hand on my thigh.

I pulled the knife from my bag and he pulled his hand back immediately.

He knew I was getting aggressive—and that gave him freedom to return the aggression.

Anger replaced fear.

I think that was the worst mistake I ever made.

One day I decided to walk home again.

Neve was there.

This time, instead of walking past like before, I snapped. I wanted to play crazy. I started yelling at him.

I pulled out the knife and pointed it at the dog.

She just stared at me. Unblinking.

Seconds later, Thomas rushed out with his daughter Amanda. They saw me waving a knife at their pet.

“Get the hell out of here before I call the cops!” Thomas yelled.

I ran home, while some of the neighbors watched me scream at an animal.

But that’s not what made me steal Fátima’s car and leave town.

It was what happened five hours ago.

Today was my cousin Antônio’s birthday. He turned 13. My dad wanted me to go, and Fátima convinced me too, saying I looked exhausted and needed to see familiar faces.

Still tense, I went.

At first, the party was calm.

Until exactly 6:30 PM. The devil’s hour.

Yeah, I’ve been watching the clock a lot. I think I’ve even developed OCD.

“Jonas” always arrived at that time. And I think that’s when I finally lost it.

A “cousin” I had never seen before showed up out of nowhere, along with his parents—whom I had also never seen.

I think you already know what I thought.

It was him.

It had to be.

I didn’t even think twice. I just went straight for him.

No, I started *screaming* at him.

He’s 15. Just starting high school.

“You think this is funny? You came all the way to my uncle’s house with these two to keep playing your sick game? You son of a bitch, I’ll kill you right here!”

I grabbed the knife they were going to use for Antônio’s cake. I almost killed an innocent kid.

My dad and uncles managed to hold me back.

It wasn’t Jonas.

It really wasn’t.

This whole thing has fucked with my head so badly.

They treated it like nothing happened. Like it was normal.

They didn’t want my breakdown to become gossip.

I apologized and said I was leaving.

Before I left, my mom came up to me.

She said she understood what I was going through, and that I should go back to therapy because I clearly hadn’t moved past what happened in 2023.

Here’s the thing.

“2023” came back to haunt me two months ago.

And I hadn’t told anyone about it—except the police, who didn’t believe me, and Fátima, who I’m sure only pretended to.

My mom didn’t know about 2023. Nobody in my family did.

Jonas was really at that party.

But not as some distant cousin.

That motherfucker was **Nathalia.**

My mom.

The second I heard that, I connected the dots. I wasn’t crazy. Jonas slipped up, thinking my mom already knew.

What scares me the most is that I think he’s getting better at disguising himself.

Because I know my mom very well—and during that entire party, I never relaxed for a second, thinking maybe he wasn’t there. The thought crossed my mind.

But I didn’t notice. I didn’t see that he was her.

I don’t know where he is now. But I’m going to do everything I can to stay far away from him—until the police find me and arrest me for theft.

Maybe in prison, I’ll finally have some peace.
