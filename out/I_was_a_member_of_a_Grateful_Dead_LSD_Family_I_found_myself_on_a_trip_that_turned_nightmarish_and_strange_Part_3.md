&#x200B;

The people in the cavern who had their limbs amputated continued to moan and whimper as waves of pain overtook me. Laying on the cold, stone floor, I continued to look up at China Cat when a commotion began behind us.  
  
“It’s OK, you’re gonna be fine, you’re gonna make it through this,” he said to me, putting pressure on the wound. I felt spurts of warm blood rushing out in time with my heartbeat. He took a belt and wrapped it around the leg, tightening it to reduce the bleeding.  
  
“Make way for the Herald,” someone shouted in a deep, gravelly voice that echoed through the stone tunnels. “You swine, you subhumans, move aside.” I looked down the dark tunnel, seeing lanterns heading in our direction. Men in purple robes walked in our direction. Soldiers armed with swords surrounded them on both sides, swearing at anyone who didn’t move fast enough, pushing and shoving people.  
  
Occasionally, I would hear a whispering, emotionless voice say, “Take that one, he’s good for the Master,” or, “That child there. Grab her.” By the time they got to us, the procession had dozens of prisoners, bound up in chains and linked together. I saw the soldiers grabbing an old man from a small cavern forking off the side of the main tunnel, punching him in the side of the head for no reason. He crumpled to the ground. One soldier with a face like an angry bulldog knelt down, chaining the old man’s hands and roughly lifting him to his feet. The old man swayed like a boxer before a knockout, and the soldier slapped him hard across the face.  
  
China Cat had cut Isabella’s bindings with the same knife I had used to kill the man in the filthy paint mask. She knelt over me as he began to cut away part of my jeans to look at the wound closer.  
  
“Well, I don’t think it hit any arteries,” China Cat said, “but you really need stitches. I don’t know where we’re going to get those around here. You should try to walk on it as little as possible, and you definitely won’t be running any marathons.”  
  
“I’m going to die here, aren’t I?” I asked. The men in the purple robes had closed in on us by this point. The soldiers in front began shouting at China Cat and Isabella.  
  
“Take them,” the same low, whispery voice said. I saw it came from a short, elderly priest with a hunched back and thin wisps of hair that looked as airy and white as dandelion seeds. He had cold green eyes that regarded us like slabs of meat. He looked at my spurting leg. “If the injured one can’t walk, kill him.”  
  
“I can walk,” I exclaimed through gritted teeth. I wasn’t actually too sure of that, but I certainly had no intention of letting myself get butchered here on a stone floor this far from home.  
  
I rose slowly, looking at the knife embedded in my leg. It hadn’t struck the bone, but had gone clean through the outer layers of skin and muscle. Squeezing my eyes shut, I pulled the knife out, slowly, centimeter by centimeter. It felt like hot pins burning inside my flesh, but a few seconds later, it came sliding out, a waterfall of dark blood flowing out behind it.  
  
“Let’s go,” the soldier behind me said. “Hands behind your back.” I saw China Cat slide the head of Mr. Grin into his shirt, tucking it into his pants. It was extremely obvious, but the soldiers didn’t seem to care what he had in his shirt in the slightest. They chained my hands, then chained Isabella and China Cat, putting us in the line of half-starved prisoners. I saw a prisoner look down at the bulge in China Cat’s clothing.  
  
“What’s that you got there, meat? Bread?” the thin man in front of us asked, turning and staring at the bulge for a long moment.  
  
“None of your business,” China Cat said gruffly, and the man just laughed. Mr. Grin stayed strangely quiet.  
  
“You won’t have long to eat it if it is,” he said cryptically. “You’re better off sharing it with us now if it is.”  
  
“It isn’t food,” he responded. The man turned back around as the line began to move forwards. I leaned heavily on China Cat as waves of fire ran up and down my bleeding leg.  
  
I looked back, seeing the old man who the soldiers had beat stood almost directly next to me. The right side of his face had already begun to swell, a rapidly darkening purple bruise giving him a squinted, one-sided look.  
  
But it was clear that this wasn’t the first indignity heaped upon his face. His right cheek had deep, melted scars that ran in keloid folds down to his jaw. The eye on that side had withered like a shrunken grape. It stared out blindly without a pupil or iris, as smooth and white as a pebble worn by a river.  
  
“Good fortune, friend,” he said in a quivering voice, “though I don’t know how good it will be for any of us now.”  
  
“You too,” I said, returning his strange greeting. “Who are these people? Where are they taking us?” I saw Isabella and China Cat lean in, listening intently to the conversation. I limped slowly along, occasionally leaning on China Cat for support. The chains around us clinked like dull metal bells. I saw dirty silhouettes of starving men, women and children scattering like cockroaches before the light as the column of armed men and priests advanced down the stone passage. The old man leaned close to me, examining my face and clothes.  
  
“You’re not from around here, are you?” he asked. I saw he had an old leather belt wrapped around his thin waist. He had cut new holes farther and farther along the length of it- markers of his increasing emaciation as his body wasted away until he looked like a concentration camp inmate. He wasn’t the only one, either. Looking down the line, I saw vertebrae bulging through thin, sallow skin, and legs and arms that looked like metal rods wrapped in a miniscule layer of flesh.   
  
The old man wore a strange kind of tattered cloth the color of swamp water. He nodded his head sagely at me, answering his own question.   
  
“No, I can see you’re not from around here. I haven’t seen clothes like that since…” He stopped, looking up at me with an anxious expression.  
  
“Since when?” Isabella asked, curious. He looked over at her with surprise, as if he didn’t even know she was there.  
  
“Since the High Priest of Koras first came into our world,” he said. “But that was fifty years ago.”  
  
“What is your name, old man?” China Cat asked. The old man turned at him with weary, watery eyes, the eyes of an old dog about to be put to sleep.  
  
“Abraham,” he answered in a quivering voice. We introduced ourselves, and asked him about what had happened fifty years ago.  
  
The line began marching down a corridor I had never seen before, taking more and more prisoners as it went. I saw red light streaming in an opening far away, no more than a pinpoint. Emaciated and dirty people scattered into side tunnels and slunk into shadows, the soldiers grabbing some at random and adding them to the ever-increasing chain. They seemed like they were just trying to fill a quota and didn’t care who they chose.   
  
And then Abraham told us a story that turned my world upside-down.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
 “He called himself Smiley,” he said, “but he said his real name was Stephen Carmine. Everyone knew it when he showed. His arrival had been marked by seers and prophets for hundreds of years. The followers of the Ancient Ones predicted a great king would arise who would conquer the warring armies and unite the land under one leader.  
  
“When he finally appeared at the Well of Voices, stars began to fall from the bloody sky above, meteorites that struck the earth all around us with countless blows. Quite a few people died, and many houses and temples got smashed to bits under the crushing weight of the falling stones from the sky.” He shook his head grimly. “Omens of things to come, I’ll tell you.  
  
“Koras had been rampaging across the town that day, as he usually did every couple years before traveling to far-off lands and inevitably returning. He ignored the meteorites as if they were no more than flies buzzing around his head. They would hit his heavy scales and bounce off with nary a mark or dent. But all the commotion seemed to have driven him into a killing frenzy. He had begun grabbing random people with his tentacles and chewing them with his many mouths.”  
  
“Many mouths?” I asked. I hadn’t seen any mouths. It felt like my heart would burst out of my chest as he recounted the story. I couldn’t believe he had said Smiley’s name, but more importantly, I thought it might even become essential for our survival. Abraham nodded.  
  
“Yes, behind the tentacles, if you ever see them lifted, he has dozens of strange, teeth-filled holes. It almost reminds me of a lamprey or an eel, with the spongy, black gums and the teeth jutting out in spirals. Each of the mouths chews on its own, and it helps him consume prey faster, I assume. Animals can change over time, so why not whatever Koras is?”  
  
“You mean like evolution?” Isabella asked. “Are there more like Koras here?” Abraham shook his head.  
  
“No, thank God, he is the last. The others were killed in the wars that swept through Scarville after Smiley arrived. They each had their own priests and soldiers who followed and worshiped them.”  
  
“Can the priests talk to Koras?” I asked. He smiled grimly.  
  
“Only the High Priests ever communicate with the beasts directly. We don’t know how they do it. They have to undergo some sort of secret surgery, I hear. Their tongues get sliced in half, until they’re like the forked tongues of a serpent. Only then can they speak in the language of the Ancient Ones, a queer, hissing kind of speech.  
  
“I was just a young man when the High Priest Smiley arrived. I lived at the edge of town. My family were farmers. We grew the edible caracas root, which spreads very easily under the fiery red light of Scarville. Nearly all of our meals back then consisted of root vegetables and herbs, never any meat. No, the High Priests would send their armies in and take any livestock we had as ‘tribute’.  
  
“It was much different back then. Smaller versions of Koras, which we called the Ancient Ones, rampaged across the country. They would gather armies, cult members who would sacrifice prisoners of war to the reptilian gods. Everyone in the town was armed and ready to fight at a moment’s notice.  
  
“The Well of Voices had become a site of pilgrimage for us, as the holy men in our town said it could tell the future. It was just a massive natural rock well, formed into a perfect circle about the length of a man across. It went down so far that you couldn’t see the water. People had climbed down on ropes to the sacred waters below, but it had taken them hours and much rope.  
  
“The sacred waters had a light gold color and always tasted sweet and refreshing. But it was the voices that echoed up from the Well during rainstorms that truly brought the pilgrims streaming in. For centuries, voices had babbled in many languages, seeming to adjust each towards the natural language of the listeners present. People thought the voices would predict the future, and they listened closely to the words that echoed up the endless, smooth stone of the Well.  
  
“The day the High Priest arrived, though, there was no rain. The holy men who built their huts around the Well heard screaming echoing up from far below, faint and eerie. They immediately summoned the strongest young men from the town, who got their strongest ropes and began climbing down.  
  
“Hours later, they emerged carrying a wet, exhausted young man wearing clothes just like yours. I had heard rumors of a commotion in the market in town and had gone to investigate. Thankfully, I had not been present when Koras began his rampage. However, my parents had both been in the house. It collapsed on them and killed them instantly. I didn’t find their bodies until days later, when rescuers finally cleared most of the rubble away.  
  
“It would have been far worse, but when the young men brought this man, Smiley, into town on a mule-drawn carriage, Smiley had seen Koras from a long distance away. He instantly rose, as if revived by the sight of such a monster. He yelled at the driver to stop, and in a fit of mania, he ran towards the rampaging beast.  
  
“He began crying at Koras, and though he didn’t have the forked tongue, the beast stopped and looked at him. Koras tilted his head, almost like a dog. It would have been comical were he not surrounded by the crushed bodies of his victims at the time.  
  
“Koras picked up the man Smiley with one of his long, writhing tentacles, bringing him up to his great dragon’s eyes. With slitted pupils, I saw him regard the man for a long moment. I expected the tentacle to begin squeezing and the man to be crushed into a bloody paste, but that’s not at all what happened.  
  
“Instead, Koras’ pupils dilated, and his snake-like nostrils flared, and he began to shriek endlessly. The sound shook the ground. He immediately ran off, taking the man with him. I don’t know what Koras saw in him, but it looked like sheer terror.  
  
“The next thing I knew, the man had somehow met the Priests of Koras, and he learned about the ritual. They had seen the connection shared between him and the beast, and they immediately approved him for the tongue-slicing ritual. He learned to talk to the beast, and he controlled it like no other priest. The beast seemed… afraid, somehow. It would begin to quiver and roar when Smiley drew near, bringing the sacrifices of prisoners of war or, if that failed, anyone they could grab.”   
  
We made it outside by this point, going up a sloping dirt ramp that led into the flat, black plains that seemed to go on forever with roads made of bones stretching out to every horizon. I blinked quickly, limping as I went, feeling fresh drops of blood still running down my leg. Yet the bleeding seemed to have slowed slightly, and though I felt light-headed, probably from the blood loss and pain, I knew I had to push myself and keep going.  
  
Ahead of us, I saw a platform made of skulls five feet tall, and on top of it stood a silver throne. In the chair, surrounded by the bones of thousands of people, I saw my friend, Smiley.  
  
Yet he had aged greatly. I could tell it was the same man, but he now looked seventy or eighty-years-old. He had a face as wrinkled as a raisin, the skin leathery and pale.  
  
The eyes were the same. They seemed to crackle with intensity and inner fervor. Smiley looked over the crowd of prisoners, all chained together in a streaming mass of humanity. Then soldiers began yelling, and we came to a stop. The soldier next to me looked me up and down with bleary eyes.  
  
“We’re not going to check what you have and find a human head that you’ve eaten, right, subhuman?” the soldier said in disgust. I shook my head quickly. He spat on the ground and moved away.  
  
“Mr. Grin is awfully quiet,” China Cat whispered. “I wonder why.”  
  
“We have bigger problems,” I said, looking around for any advantage. I only had a few things on me, including Mr. Grin’s skull tucked into my shirt, a bloody pocket knife and maybe a million hits of LSD in a glass vial in my pocket.  
  
I saw we had arrived on a flat dirt field where long tables were set up. Intricate carvings of reptilian faces stared out from the edges and legs of the tables. A massive punchbowl five feet wide and a few feet tall was filled to the brim with some golden-colored alcoholic drink a few steps away from me. I think it may have been honey mead.   
  
Next to it, plate after plate of roast duck, slices of beef, smoked pork, rice, bread, pies and chocolates ladened the tables. Some seemed to bow slightly under the intense weight of so many dishes. The smell of cooking meat, fresh bread, honey and baking cakes permeated the air. My stomach growled, and I wondered when I ate last- or when I would eat again, if ever.  
  
Then, an idea came to me. I looked around, seeing no one looking at me. The Herald and his priests stood around Smiley, leaning over and whispering something to him. I saw a scowl forming on his face.  
  
I checked the perimeter guard, seeing the soldiers still laughing and talking. They stood in a circle around the chained prisoners, regarding them with apathy.  
  
“Koras won’t be here for another hour,” I heard one complain. “He won’t come for the subhumans until the night arrives and the fires blaze here on every pyre. Which means we might as well start drinking and eating.” He shook his head angrily. “I hate waiting around.”  
  
I felt in my pockets, the handcuffs jingling with a harsh, metallic ringing. After a few seconds, I found it. I took out the vial of LSD, unstoppered the top, and with a prayer, I crept next to the punchbowl, trying to act confused and inconspicuous. I didn’t make eye contact with anyone as I lifted the vial above the edge of the bowl, hiding it with my body as much as I could.  
  
I poured the LSD into the great wooden bowl. The silvery white crystals dissolved into the golden-colored liquid in an instant. Within the next few minutes, servant after servant came over, drawing from the bowl to bring drinks to all of the soldiers and most important people. Mr. Grin laughed inside my shirt, drawing startled glances from all the prisoners around me.  
  
“Good thinking, cowboy,” he said. “I hope that doesn’t backfire on you.”  
  
“Well, what else do you expect me to do?” I whispered, looking like a lunatic. A few people gave me strange glances, as if they thought I were talking to myself.  
  
“Oh, no, you made the right call,” Mr. Grin said. “I just hope you kept a little for emergencies. You’re not out of the woods yet. But I digress. Let’s just watch and wait.” We did, and it didn’t take long.  
  
Within a few minutes, soldiers and priests began falling over, their dilated pupils staring up at the sky with terrified faces. Some of them started screaming, and I saw a few strip naked and begin running around, howling like wolves as they turned their faces up to the crimson sky.  
  
I looked up at Smiley, seeing him holding a cup of mead in his shaky, withered hand. I still couldn’t get over how much he had aged. His scowl turned to an expression of confusion as he continued to drink from the cup. When the soldiers started falling over and laughing or screaming, he rose from his chair, looking directly at me. A flash of recognition came over his face, but it disappeared as quickly as it had arrived and confusion took over again. Hope started to fade in my heart as I saw his face go slack and dumb.  
  
I saw a cloud of dust heading towards us from the horizon, a cloud that reached nearly up to the sky. I wondered if it was Koras here for the sacrifices. What would he do when he arrived and found his cult members all running around or laying on the ground with heads full of acid?  
  
But it wasn’t Koras. Koras had not arrived yet. Someone else had, though.  
  
From far away, I saw half-naked men with faces painted red or blue. They all had spears, swords and crossbows. Leading them in the charge, I saw something horrible.  
  
“The Wandering King,” Mr. Grin said from inside my shirt, sounding terrified. I shivered at the name.  
  
The creature towered above his armies, standing taller than a two-story house. His face constantly changed, the bones seeming to reform and move around under the tight, red skin like tectonic plates in the Earth shifting and grinding during massive earthquakes.  
  
A staff made of flames sat in his two skeletal right hands. His two left arms kept waving the armies forward.  
  
“Kill them!” he roared with a cacophonous voice that shook the ground. “Kill the followers of Koras! Leave no one alive. Rip them apart, cut their throats, crucify the enemy!”  
  
“Oh God, I think it’s time to go,” China Cat said. I nodded.  
  
I looked around, seeing a soldier laying on the ground nearby. A ring of keys jingled around his coarse leather belt. I moved as close as I could, held back by the chains, but I reached my arm forwards and just managed to close my hand around his foot. I started dragging him towards me, fresh blood pouring down my leg from the effort.  
  
“I could use some help here,” I said to Isabella and China Cat through gritted teeth. They each grabbed part of his leg and dragged him between us.  
  
His eyes were blank and his pupils blown wide open, pure black orbs that roved constantly over the crimson sky. He muttered to himself.  
  
“Oh, it’s just the wind, it’s caught fire again,” he whispered. “The tornadoes are coming. The sun exploded, and I saw it. I think it melted my eyes…”  
  
“Grab his keys,” I ordered. “Let’s get the fuck out of here.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
There was only one person who I believed had the power to bring us back to our world from Scarville. He sat on a throne of silver laid on top of thousands of bones, tripping on a high dose of LSD. As soon as we had unchained ourselves, we began moving towards Smiley. Every time I looked at the army following the Wandering King, they seemed closer and closer- not more than a few minutes away by this point.  
  
Smiley’s personal guards and priests had all drunk the mead, and most had wandered off or laid on the ground, talking to themselves. Some just ran away like demons from Hell were hot on their heels. I knew the soldiers of Koras could not formulate any real defense in this condition. Our only chance to survive was to rouse Smiley and have him take us out of here.  
  
“Smiley!” Isabella cried as she reached his massive throne. He looked at us blankly. I took Mr. Grin out of my shirt. The skull grinned up at me, its black eyes excited and pulsating. “It’s us, Isabella and China Cat and Jay. We’re here, man. We’re finally here.” Her voice broke, and she started to cry.  
  
“We need to get out of here, now,” China Cat said to him. Smiley shifted his eyes slowly and robotically to China Cat. I couldn’t tell if he even knew where he was or what was going on. “If we don’t get out of here in the next couple minutes, we’re going to be slaughtered. You understand that, right?” Smiley didn’t say anything or react in any way. I sighed.  
  
“Perhaps you can reach him,” Mr. Grin offered, “by reminding him of the true nature of reality.”  
  
“The true nature of…?” China Cat said. Mr. Grin sighed.  
  
“Where you were when he opened the portal,” Mr. Grin said. “Where a part of him still is now.”  
  
“The desert!” Isabella cried. “We’re in a desert with trailers, right? And there’s a leather-bound Bible…” Smiley’s eyes widened, and he looked directly at Isabella.  
  
“You saw that too?” he slurred. “How did you know about my dreams and nightmares?”  
  
“They’re not dreams!” Isabella cried. “That’s the real world, and we need to go there, now.” I looked nervously at the armies approaching us. They roared with a frenzied bloodlust. I could see the black, filthy beards hanging down from their scarred faces. We stood no chance if we were still here when they reached us. They would tear us apart in an instant.  
  
Smiley stood suddenly, grabbing China Cat’s hand.   
  
“China Cat?” he asked in a quavering old man’s voice. China Cat nodded.  
  
“It’s me, buddy, I’m here for you,” he said. China Cat looked nervously at Mr. Grin. “So what now?”  
  
“Do I have to do everything?” Mr. Grin grumbled. “Tell him to open his third eye and concentrate on the desert! That’s how he got here in the first place. He thought this place only existed in his nightmares, but clearly, he didn’t realize he was experiencing another true world. Maybe he doesn’t realize your world is real either. But he better realize it quickly, otherwise…”  
  
The Wandering King was now only a few hundred feet away. He sprinted in front of his armies, his blood-red robe rippling around his legs. His face kept changing and melting, the eyes reforming into nightmarish spectacles. They changed from reptilian to insectoid to bovine. The mouth opened like a black hole, without teeth or a tongue. It fell open, and he shrieked his battle-cry.  
  
Then he ran into the first line of Koras’ soldiers and prisoners, and I knew it was too late.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
“I remember!” Smiley said, excited. “I can see it clearly, as clearly as I see all of you…”  
  
“Then take us there!” Isabella cried. “Now! Run it through your third eye, and keep increasing the power until…” But that was all she got out before the screams of the dying and injured started to reach us. I looked at the armies of the Wandering King as they stabbed and decapitated dozens of people on the perimeter. The Wandering King was looking directly at Smiley, shrieking with a voice like thunder to kill, kill, kill.  
  
He began running towards us, his black hole of a mouth taking up nearly a quarter of his body. He looked like a red, skeletal banshee, his fiery staff held high as he crushed one person after another beneath his red-robed feet. I heard bones shatter and a sound like trickling water as blood poured from crushed and mutilated bodies onto the dark earth below.  
  
As he closed in within a couple dozen feet of us, I had a crazy idea. I took the vial of LSD out of my pocket, aimed it and threw. It sailed through the air in a lazy arc, and an instant later, I saw it land in the Wandering King’s gaping mouth. A small tinkle of glass shattering rang out through the air. The Wandering King kept coming, but after a few steps, he stopped. He looked around, confused, and his face began to melt and change faster and faster.  
  
“It’s opening!” Smiley cried. I saw light streaming from his body, forming an arch behind him. Through it, I saw the desert we had come from. Without looking back, we all ran through, and with a popping sound, it closed behind us.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
When we got back, I saw Smiley had returned to his old self. He wasn’t some eighty-year-old man anymore, but the Smiley in his twenties, the one we all knew. He had fallen sometime in the chaos, and now he slowly sat up, grinning his crooked half-smile as he looked us all up and down.  
  
I still had Mr. Grin’s skull in my hands, and his black eyes shone with excitement.  
  
“So,” Smiley said, laughing, “crazy trip, huh?”  
  
We packed up and left, and to this day, I still have Mr. Grin in my room. He’s happy to be out of Scarville, and so am I, for that matter. I hope I never see that foul place again.
