Hello all,

I’m in my early 30s, and I’ve been getting very poor sleep for a few weeks. I have no prior history of psychosis. I just spoke to a mental health professional—they said get some sleep and sleep deprivation could be a cause, but doesn’t entirely rule out the paranormal. 

Last Monday (almost 2 weeks agoI) was chanting om mani padme hun on the front porch. On my left side, a voice was chanting om mani padme hun. It was clear and distinct. I chanted along with it until I heard my name uttered at one point followed by an inaudible sentence. I had a strange feeling. It kept chanting and moving towards me, getting ever closer with each chant. At one point it sounded very close and it startled me, so I went inside. While inside it kept chanting the mantra, but the “padme hun” part was exaggerated, as if to be intentionally mocking. I fell asleep at the kitchen table and awoke there a few hours later to silence. I heard this exaggerated "padme hun" in background noise the next night kitchen. There was a large stack of heavy cooking trays and cookie rack things on a table. As I was dosing off this stack fell very loudly, but it wasn't all at once. It was as if the stack was a card deck and the trays and racks were swiped off one by one to extend the loud crashes. This freaked me out--I screamed at the top of my lungs and felt like my heart was going to explode. This woke up my housemates, and they even observed the noise and trays on the floor. I'm a senior STEM Major--this stack disobeyed natural laws the way it fell. It simply made no physical sense. This could be coincidence, I was half asleep... who knows? 

Monday last week I started hearing a background voice that sounded like Daleks from Doctor Who--my best description the voice--that will say these mantras at times normally, but also angrily and/or mockingly? I can control what the background say just by thinking about them, but not the way they say them. Sometimes their voices pitch will match the movement background noise in due to the doppler effect, either a high pitch shrill or a low pitch evil sounding (Due to vehicles moving to and fro). Every once in a great while there will be an evil witch sounding laugh. There are 2 other things that these voices have said: 1) The Hare Krishna mantra (incorrectly); 2) Variations of the Oompa-Loompa song from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. For example: Oompa-Roompa doopa-dae-rum how many cowboys do I run? Goompa-loompa doopa-dee-dee what do you have for meeeeee? (the me is prolonged and  gradually becomes more shrill).

A few mornings ago around 12:30am I heard tapping on my second story window, my curtains being tugged, the occasionally guttural beast sounding noises, and the witch laughter one more time. The background voice was coming from a background sources. I went to a friends house real quick (where I didn’t hear it inside his house, only outside), then when I got back I said the heart sutra mantra  for 3-4 hours straight. Again, The background voice was coming from multiple sources. In my kitchen when I was saying the heart sutra, the voice couldn’t say any mantra or make an attempt. It was just gibberish like “Ohio, Ohio, Ohio…..” over and over again. Only when I would pause chanting for a couple minutes, the voice could attempt say a mantra but would say it completely wrong; the only mantra they could say was chenrezig’s mantra, but it was full of rage and screaming it—a scream of full of anger, hatred, and ill intent. And there were many attempts to scare me enough to stop chanting. I also had things thrown at me while chanting—like apparitions appearing in front of me, objects being yanked and moved in front of me, peripheral motion. When I say moved, I mean that the object stayed there after. I also heard a guttural, beast like noise for the first time where one source of the background noise and background voice came from When I heard it, I immediately switched to chanting om mani pae mey hun. After this morning no background voice no longer came from there l. I also heard two low sounding female whispers coming from the other side of the living room. Near the end when I was in my room chanting the heart sutra mantra I felt footsteps on the floor around me and even an entity that was made from shiny air. I even heard a shrill, high pitched scream come from near or inside my house that darted off and ran away. It was not human sounding whatsoever. 

The differences in what the voice(and/or my mind) said before, during, and after that morning are significant. Again, it—a projection of my mind or not (or both)—is a lot weaker and there’s of anger and hatred coming from the voice (and/or my mind). Before this, in my room there were multiple sources for the voice. Now,  in my room there’s only one source and it comes from outside. I can control what it says, but it’s always angry. When I don’t try to control what it says it never says any mantra correctly. And only when full of rage screaming it out of anger and hatred. 99.8% of the time when they try it goes like this “om mani pae mey WHO ARE YOUUU?!” over and over again. 

Two mornings ago, the voice separated into 2. One I can control, the other was extremely angry and kept saying “WHO ARE YOU?!!!” I could talk to the angry voice through the nicer one. I repeated “I love you.” The angry voice said this too, but more strained each time until it said I HATE YOU a few times, then “I hate love, I love hate.” It also kept saying “WHO ARE YOU?!” I kinda realized that these were two manifestations of my mind, one of them being hatred. I kept on trying to explain who I was through the voice—the uncorrupted portion , but I always got the same response “WHO ARE YOU?!” I then realized that I’m being delusional by thinking my aspect was better. “I said I’m a delusion and addiction” to which it said “I KNEW, I KNEW!” For the first time in 1.5 days. This lead to a dialogue between the angry voice about some negative qualities about myself and how to improve. It was honestly a moment of great introspection. When I didn’t control the voice, the two talked about how I was a loving, kind person and full of good qualities, but needed to work on some things. They said that they were going to leave that day. A few hours later their voices became very faint, as if miles away. Sometimes I didn’t hear them at all. The next morning, I heard nothing from them. They were gone. 

After 1 night and a full day of sleep I don’t hear them or anything at all. Sometimes I think I do and it sounds far away, but I focus on the background noise and I don’t hear it anymore—it’s as if it’s just an echo of the past. Weird experience.
