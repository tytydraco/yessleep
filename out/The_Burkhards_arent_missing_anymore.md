7 years ago a family of four went missing from our small town. An ailing mother and father - Camilla and Patrick - along with their adult twins - Fred and Pam. No signs of entry into the now forlorn and lifeless home from which they vanished on that quiet December's night were found. It was Christmas time and Fred had driven over from across the country whilst Kam had flown halfway across the world. 



It wasn't until two days after Christmas that the neighbours realised something was wrong. The kids had grown up together and even now as adults spent the day after Christmas enjoying a hearty meal and exchanging stories detailing the past year of their lives. But when nobody answered the old dial-up phone and nobody left the house for those two days, a blanket of angst shrouded the minds of the Burkhards' neighbours. 



The police arrived to the scene described earlier and with nothing to go on the case shuffled from desk to desk, gathering more dust and less importance each time it did so. It was eventually labelled as unsolved, and the town gradually moved on albeit with a constant undercurrent of unease that the event injected into our previously happy-go-lucky attitudes. The festering wound had somewhat healed. Heavily scarred, yes, but day-by-day reversing course.



   

We had moved on. 





But we didn't account for the fact that something didn't want us to. It didn't allow us to. Waiting silently in the wings until our community felt safe again, only to snatch it away as if toying with us. 





Those were 7 long years. Long enough for me to marry and to start a family. I can only wonder to myself why I never left this place behind. But, after all, home is where the heart is. And I refused to abandon mine in fear.

It was the 7th anniversary of the Burkhards' disappearance when the packages began to show up. One eventually showed up on every doorstep of every house in town. The D'Angelo's a few streets down from me were the unlucky first recipients. 



Well, I suppose they were lucky in some regard after all, but news of an inconspicuous brown cardboard box being left on their doorstep and being found to contain a human ear spread like wildfire in hushed, fearful conversations. Analysis found it to be that of Pam Burkhard's and after 7 painful years the aforementioned wound our town was inflicted with began to violently fester once again. The neglected case file that was sitting deep within a cabinet somewhere was reopened, because the unknown fate of the Burkhard's was being unfolded with the entire town as involuntary witnesses. 



Over the next months and leading up to the following Christmas, the packages kept coming. Earlier on they were identifiable pieces of the human anatomy but as time went on these horrifying reminders of a lost family's end devolved into inscrutable hunks and chunks of meat in erratically different sizes. At some point, pretty early on, people around town refused to open packages we didn't recognise and the police were needed to retrieve each piece of evidence to keep the case from fading into the past once again.  



There was something else in those boxes, though. One word, scrawled onto a browning scrap of light pink paper. It cycled through each package and teased us as if we were all participants in a version of Russian Roulette even sicker than the original.



Eenie…



Meenie… 



Minie… 


Yesterday - shrouded with an air of inevitability - my own package finally arrived. I wanted to let the police know. Let them deal with it as so many had opted to do so. But I needed to know.


With trembling hands and beads of sweat borne from a primal fear inching down from my forehead, I pried the clear tape away from the top and sides of the box and inhaled in queasy preparation. But when I laid my eyes within, there was no meaty appendage waiting for me to discover it. 


Just that small, pink-tainted piece of paper.


“*Moe.*”


It’ll be the 8th anniversary of the Burkhards’ disappearance tomorrow. 


And now, we’re next.


I won’t allow myself to make the same mistake I made all those years ago. I refuse to stay. Vanish into the night and be parcelled up as part of a twisted mental game inflicted on the people I have lived around all my life.


My family and I will disappear on our *own* terms.
