I always wondered what the scientists in the other laboratory were working on, whispers in the cafeteria were always about how that group managed to decode our DNA. I work as a data analyst so my place is right at the bottom of food chain so getting any info was like asking God for a favour. The facility was no large and neither was it some super-secret government facility, what it really was for is quite interesting. Ever since the paper of some scientist was published on how the DNA could be  unravelled like a twisty candy, upgraded and then rewound people decided they can do it so a bunch of big corps got together and built this place.

Built, I say this in past tense because 4 years ago something was made there and it did not like where it came from. I was working on my shift that day going through the provided data and the other stuff I normally do, it was tedious but I was paid well enough not to complain. How it all started was when I noticed that a few scientists were running to the entrance looking over their shoulders, I noticed this and I tried to see where they were looking but did not see anything.

I got up and walked over to another desk where Sam say, he was my supervisor and  I asked him what was happening. He looked up and saw more scientists running and looked at me like I held all the answers, seeing that I was in the dark like him, he picked the receiver to call the front desk only to be informed by the auto reply that all line were busy. We both decided to check out side and just as we reached our office door the lights went out and the still dark was broken by a distant siren. Our office housed the main servers so it was climate and noise controlled, the access was power based so we could not leave until power was restored. I looked around to see if I could see anything, the servers ran on independent power back ups so the lights they gave off were too weak to see, I did not have my cell phone so I could not use the flashlight function it to see. I walked around the office trying to see what was happening, our windows were thick insulated glass so no noise came in.

Sam waited at the door and cursed the company for not letting us have our cell phones, he tried the door a few times but since no power it meant no dice. He tried to pry open the lock to see if he could find an emergency unlock function, I kept my eyes on the outside but could not make much out, the darkness was almost complete, and the lights that emanated from the servers made it worse. It was then I heard a banging coming from one of the windows, I walked over to it to see what the source was. To my horror I looked like a person was on the floor banging on our window asking for help, I could not make out much but just as I tried to strain my eyes to see the lights suddenly came back and I was disoriented for a few minutes by the sudden light. As I finally managed to see the person I jumped back in complete shock, she was missing her lower body. I stared in complete horror as the trail of blood and intestine lead to our room window, the scientist was dead and did not have to guess why. I looked around and saw more of them, a headless corpse was sitting on a chair in the act of still working, the labs that were across were in complete disarray. No one was around and I looked back at Sam and he was staring at the horror on his side.

“What in the actual fuck is going on?” Sam’s hand was hovering over the lock of the door and I told him not to open until we knew what was going on. The server room was in the centre of the main lab floor surrounded by thick insulated glass, this way the data from all the computers did not have issues when people were working together on any project and by being close to everyone it gave a sense of confidence that no one will steal their data. We were in the middle of an attack that we had not idea about, none of this made sense and even if there was an attack we would have been warned to shut the servers and begin lock down procedures.

I then saw the source of the carnage, I looked like 8-foot-tall person thing. Malformed in every way possible, there were large blisters all over the body and skin looked like raw meat. I was completely mesmerised this sight and so was Sam, we stood there watching the thing lumber about the labs looking for something or someone. I turned to run but Sam raised his hand and whispered not to make any more moves, whatever the thing was may look slow but after seeing all the carnage it may as well be the Flash. I turned back to see the headless monstrosity move around and we both stood stalk still hoping someone would kill it.

A scientist ran out from his hiding place and that is when we witnessed the power of that thing, I stopped and turned to the escaping scientist. Moving faster than it looked it moved towards the scientist with speed unseen, extending it appendages that could be seen as arms it gained on the fleeing man. We could not hear the sound but did not need to, the man was running for his life all the while screaming something like “Help me please.” We watched as the thing finally caught up with the man in a flash, he was stopped on his tracks and yanked backward.

I compete dismay we watched the thing grab the head of the scientist and pull it backwards the expression of complete pain was so evident and we watched as the head and spine was ripped off the man slowly. I winced at this but could not move, Sam looked like he was about to throw up and he did by rushing between the serves and violently throwing up. I continued to watch with morbid fascination as the head and spine were absorbed into the body of the thing, blood and viscera were spreading like pool around the thing, I now call homunculus.

The homunculus satisfied of the grim feast then dopped the limp body and continued its search, I saw another scientist slowly crawl to the front. I was going to try to warn her but noticed the Homunculus did not notice her, it seemed that it could not see. My guess was that since it did not have a head it could not see but it felt vibrations or it used sound to hunt. I watched at the scientist slowly made her way to the door, crawling over blood and body parts of victims her face was full of determination to make it and I found myself silently rooting for her.

The Homunculus turned to her direction and my heart sank for a second, then I saw a flash of something being thrown at it and in an instance a group of armed men rushed in. The object looked like a flash grenade or something and it burst with a bright white light that burned the Homunculus. It was injured and I could see flesh being burned as the armed men rushing forward and throwing more at it. More flash bangs exploded around the Homunculus as it tried to retreat. A heavy-set man carrying 2 tanks on his back let off a cloud of steam at the creature and withing a few seconds the labs they were in was covered in white mist.

It was nitrogen that was used to stop the Homunculus and the frozen body was taken away, we were rescued from out glass prison by another group. The aftermath was that 25 people were killed and the whole thing was covered up, I later learnt that the team was actually trying to clone people but the whole thing was corrupted by faulty research. I am still thankful for that server room being to secured, but pray for the lost.
