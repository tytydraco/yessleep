I smiled faintly looking in the mirror. My reflection looked different than it did fresh out of the police academy; my hair thinner and greyer. I had a small gut from–well, donuts if I'm being honest. How cliche. Still, I cleaned up well. 

I also had the right temperament to run the most active execution chamber in the United States. 

No nonsense, yet relatable. I've got the gift of gab and while I have no formal education in sales and marketing, I can soothe anxious inmates in their last hours of life; get them to amble peacefully to the gurney like a cow to the kill floor. I sell them their own death. 

This made me indispensable. Forcing a guilty man to the gurney was traumatic for both the inmate and my men. Forcing an innocent man was even worse. 

Did you know that actual innocence is not considered a mitigating factor to the court of criminal appeals? To vacate a conviction the inmate must prove his due process was violated. Exonerating evidence doesn't matter. Politics notwithstanding it makes my job a helluva lot more difficult. But I don't make the laws I enforce. 

Also, my wife still thinks I look cute in a uniform. She would be the first to tell you a glimpse of me in my dress blues and…well, we had a good morning that day, the last day of my pleasant, albeit morbid existence. I now understand the true power of blissful ignorance.

Four hours later I was informed I was being transferred 30 miles away to “run an elite death watch”. Actually, the strange man had said 30 layers away but I assumed he had misspoke. 

He hadn’t, but we’re not there yet. Going from DR Warden to Captain of Death Watch is technically a demotion, but the salary…compared to what I was already making, which wasn't peanuts, it felt like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates money. The shock of it was like I was the one seated on Ol’ Sparky.

I had thought it was just another death watch tour (death watch is a separate unit for inmates with an execution date). We have them surprisingly frequently. Most often we show higher-ups and politicians running tough-on-crime campaigns how the process works. That's what the lead up to murdering a man for murder is called. The process. The protocol. Their COD is still listed as homicide. 

Barely a few minutes into the tour I was deeply uncomfortable. The questions were, well, I don't like to use this sort of language but they were fucking weird. A normal question would be related to maintaining security on the day of execution. This guy, whose name I don't recall…why don't I remember his name? Probably the shock. But he knew my last name was Reaper. Usually people do a double take, but Mr. X here seemed overeager to discuss it, practically salivating. He asked me my ethnic origins, if I had presided over any botched executions, and if so *how* botched? 

He took more than a passing interest in my feelings and coping mechanisms. He asked me how I went about hiring, which I answered almost greedily. This was my forte. The challenge, I explained, is that you have to find someone willing to end the life of another who was neither a sociopath nor a man with unshakable morals. The first type belong on the gurney themselves; the second type are likely to blow their brains out. My shpiel was practiced and I was even getting into the groove a bit when I noticed the visitor wore an even more manic expression. 

And then I felt it. Fear. A primal sense of revulsion I have only felt with the worst of the worst. The man who raped and cannibalized his own grandmother. The one who tortured his 8-year-old child to death for flushing his drugs. The guy who lit a gas station employee on fire when he refused service after the murderer's card declined. These were the men who triggered my lizard brain. Who I had no trouble shepherding from life to...after. I felt that fear with this strange agent who asked far too personal questions. 

The tour ended, I excused myself and ate a donut hoping it would bring familiarity and comfort. It did, to an extent. Then the transfer was initiated. No one told me it was my last day as warden, but here we were.

I'm back home now. I'm trying to get to the point, I am. I just don't know if I can face it, let alone sell it.

The strange man did not mean miles when he said layers. It turns out there really is a fucking multiverse. *A multiverse*. 

30 layers from a pound-me-in-the-ass prison in Texas is another prison. The architecture is a windowless black cube that reminded me of vanta black, a paint so black the human brain interprets it as a sort of void space. There was no barbed wire fencing. No sniper tower. 

And no door. The strange man led me to the doorless cube and told me to knock. “Sir, respectfully, are you fucking with me?” “Just knock. It's already written one way or the other.”

“What is written?”, I said, knocking lightly. *What the fuck was written?* 

“That.” He pointed. The formey solid space now revealed a sleek, monochromatic hallway. “That,” he repeated, “is Death’s Door. Shortly after her imprisonment she informed staff of her complete control of who comes in, and who goes out. 

Lady Death is not beholden to the laws of physics, though she is made vulnerable to containment when not in possession of her scythe. As you in particular would know, the machinery of death has not stopped and never will. However, in absence of her scythe, we hoped we could contain her long enough to change her views regarding certain universal laws. She has a rather liberal interpretation of the fabric of existence and has described herself as "a spirit of the law kind of gal". 

“Hoped? Past tense?”

Yes. Death has told us she can leave whenever she wants, at which point she will access the presently unknown layer that holds her cloak. While the cloak appears to be normally sized, the interior is capable of holding all souls living and dead from all universes. She has informed us that once she accesses her cloak, there will be no stopping her taking back the scythe, at which point she will trigger a mass extinction event. When asked why she didn't do it now, she simply responded, “Because it isn't time. My father is Time and one day I will take Time, too. As long as Time lives, so does Man. But Time’s time will be up, and the era of Man will die with my father. Until then, I will require staff. Bring me my Reaper. He is close.”

“... It's just a last name, don't you think that''s a little on the nose?” This bothered me more than the revelation that death was a corporeal being, apparently female, the daughter of Time itself, and temporarily detained in a doorless prison from which she threatened to end the universe, which is infinite. Compartmentalization is another invaluable skill. I couldn't do what I did if I saw the whole picture. The childhood that led to the gang that led to the robbery that led to the shooting of a 93-year-old veteran that led to the trial that led to the death penalty that led a 24-year-old to the gurney, whose tears I wipe gently as he is restrained approximately 18 seconds after entering the death chamber. I only see a convicted killer with whom I will develop a relationship that inevitably ends with preparing his body for transport to the town funeral home. 

See? Compartmentalizing. 

I like to think I'm a tough guy, but I just wanted to go home and look cute to my wife in my uniform.

A female voice echoed from past the door. “Abandon all hope ye who enter here, Officer Baconater.”

I spun around, facing the strange man. “Is that her? Is that…Death?”

The strange man sighed. “No, that's just Karma. She's here too. Try not to let her get to you.”

“Yeah, try not to let me get to you like I did that gerbil-faced overpaid fake goon squad virgin in a bad suit."

“I’M NOT A…nevermind. As I said, don't let her get to you. We’ll get you caught up soon enough. For now, read this.”

I was handed a leatherbound black book titled “The Protocol of Death's Watcher”. The strange man informed me he wrote it himself, warning me to take it seriously.”

His expressionless face broke for a second, finally giving me a peak at whatever humanity he housed. “Listen, if you're going to survive death, there's something you have to do. You have to give up any pretense that you are in charge. You are not. You are here to entertain Death. She gets bored. She needs people to float ideas to, to threaten, to flirt with. And on that note, not that you would, but do not ever engage in sexual conduct with the inmate. It will be the last thing you ever do.”

Though I don't quite remember entering, the door shut behind me. Or did whatever a door does when it stops existing. The strange man was gone, and the scene before me looked like it had been picked from the set of a Southern Gothic period film. An old-timey lamp turned on from a desk that wasn't there before, and the book burned and became heavy in my hands. 

I knew what it meant without asking. The time for introductions was over. The time for learning had begun. I felt a sensation, I don't know, like when you can tell you got someone a really, really good birthday present. The feeling I got when my wife opened her PS5 on Christmas Day. I knew Lady Death was pleased. I was a quick learner and punctual to a fault. 

Still, while I am used to 24/7 surveillance,  it has never been for *me*. Not like this. Not with Her. Still, I had a job to do. 

I opened the heavy book. Page 1, chapter 1.

“A Reaper’s Guide to Inmate 00:00” 

Fuck.
