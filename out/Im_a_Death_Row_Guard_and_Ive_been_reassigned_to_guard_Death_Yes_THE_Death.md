I smiled faintly looking in the mirror. My reflection looked different than it did fresh out of the police academy; my hair thinner and greyer. I had a small gut from–well, donuts if I'm being honest. How cliche. Still, I cleaned up well. 

I also had the right temperament to run the most active execution chamber in the United States. 

No nonsense, yet relatable. I've got the gift of gab and while I have no formal education in sales and marketing, I can soothe anxious inmates in their last hours of life; get them to amble peacefully to the gurney like a cow to the kill floor. I sell them their own death. My wife calls it a sixth sense. I don't know about all that. I just carry out the law. 

Whatever you call it, it made me indispensable. Forcing a guilty man to the gurney was traumatic for both the inmate and my men. Forcing an innocent man was even worse. 

Did you know that actual innocence is not considered a mitigating factor to the court of criminal appeals? To vacate a conviction the inmate must prove his due process was violated. Exonerating evidence doesn't matter. Politics notwithstanding it makes my job a helluva lot more difficult. But I don't make the laws I enforce. 

Besides, my wife still thinks I look cute in a uniform. She would be the first to tell you a glimpse of me in my dress blues and…well, we had a good morning that day, the last day of my pleasant, albeit morbid existence. I now understand the weightlessness of ignorance.

Four hours later the top brass informed I was being transferred 30 miles away to “run an elite death watch”. Actually, they had said 30 layers away but I dismissed it as a brain fart. 

It wasn't, but we’re not there yet. Going from DR Warden to Captain of Death Watch is technically a demotion, but the salary…compared to what I was already making, which wasn't peanuts, it felt like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates money. The shock of it was like I was the one seated on Ol’ Sparky.

I had thought it was just another death watch tour (death watch is a separate unit for inmates with an execution date). We have them surprisingly frequently. Most often we show higher-ups and politicians running tough-on-crime campaigns how the process works. That's what the lead up to murdering a man for murder is called. The process. The protocol. *The procedure*. 

Only their death certificates call it homicide. 

Barely a few minutes into the tour I was deeply uncomfortable. The questions were, well, I don't like to use this sort of language but they were fucking weird. A normal question would be related to maintaining security on the day of execution. This guy, whose name I don't recall…why don't I remember his name? Probably the shock. But he knew my last name was Reaper. Usually people do a double take, but Mr. X here seemed overeager to discuss it, practically salivating. He asked me my ethnic origins, if I had presided over any botched executions, and if so *how* botched? 

He took more than a passing interest in my feelings and coping mechanisms. He asked me how I went about hiring, which I answered almost greedily. This was my forte. The challenge, I explained, is that you have to find someone willing to end the life of another who was neither a sociopath nor a man with unshakable morals. The first type belong on the gurney themselves; the second type are likely to blow their brains out. My shpiel was practiced and I was even getting into the groove a bit when I noticed the visitor looked absolutely manic.

And then I felt it. Fear. A primal sense of revulsion I have only felt with the worst of the worst. The man who raped and cannibalized his own grandmother. The one who tortured his 8-year-old child to death for flushing his drugs. The guy in middle management who soaked a gas station employee in gasoline and lit a match for texting instead of working. These were the men who triggered my lizard brain. The ones I had no trouble shepherding from life to hell. I felt that fear with this strange agent who asked far too many personal questions. He was *wrong*, somehow. 

The tour ended, I excused myself and ate a donut hoping it would bring familiarity and comfort. It did, to an extent. Then the transfer was initiated. No one told me it was my last day as warden, but here we were.

I'm back home now. I'm trying to get to the point, I am. I just don't know if I can face it, let alone sell it.

The strange man did not mean miles when he said layers. It turns out there really is a fucking multiverse. *A multiverse*. 

30 layers from a pound-me-in-the-ass prison in Texas is another prison. A smooth black cube that reminded me vaguely of Borg. A utilitarian monument in the middle of a disturbing lavender-colored desert. There was no barbed wire fencing. No sniper tower. Just the blackest black; vanta black, the famous black pigment so dark the human brain sees a bottomless void. 

There were no doors or windows. The strange man led me to the doorless cube and told me to knock. “Sir, respectfully, are you fucking with me?” “Just knock. It's already written one way or the other.”

“What is written?”, I said, knocking lightly. *What the fuck was written?* 

“That.” He pointed. The formerly solid space now revealed a sleek hallway. “That,” he repeated, “is Death’s Door. She is...detained here, though she is not beholden to the laws of physics, which you will become painfully aware of over time. As you can testify, the machinery of death is well-oiled as ever. However, in the absence of her scythe--long story--we hoped she could be held long enough to make certain reasonable adjustments upon release. 

“Hoped? Past tense?”

Yes. Death has made it clear that she can and will leave. She just likes it here. She is ancient, and this is new.  She is the shot caller of her own reality show. When she grows bored, she will access the presently unknown layer that holds her cloak. While the cloak appears to be a normal size, small if anything, the cloak's interior is best described as a black hole that will eventually consume all souls living and dead along with the infinate universe. Best not to think about it too hard. 

She has informed us that once she has the cloak, there will be no stopping her taking back the scythe, at which point she will trigger a mass extinction event. When asked why she doesn't just get it over with, she responded, “Because it isn't time. My father is Time and one day I will take Time, too. As long as Time lives, so does Man. But Time’s time will be up, and the era of Man will die with my father. Until then, I will require staff. Bring me the Reaper."

“... It's just a last name, don't you think that''s a little on the nose? I'm not the goddamn actual grim reaper.” This bothered me more than the revelation that death was a corporeal being, apparently female, the daughter of Time itself, and kinda sorta not really detained in a doorless and windowless prison from which she threatened to end the universe. 

Compartmentalization is another invaluable skill. I couldn't do what I did if I saw the whole picture. The childhood that led to the gang that led to the robbery that led to the shooting of a 93-year-old veteran that led to the trial that led to the death penalty that led a 24-year-old to the gurney, whose tears I wipe gently as he is restrained approximately 18 seconds after entering the death chamber. I only see a convicted killer with whom I will develop a relationship that inevitably ends with preparing his body for transport to the local funeral home. 

I couldn't handle the prospect of preventing the destruction of infinite realities, but I could get pissed off at this guy for being a dick about my last name. See? Compartmentalizing. 

I like to think I'm a tough guy, but at that moment I just wanted to go home and look cute to my wife in my uniform.

It was not to be. A female voice echoed from past the door. “Abandon all hope ye who enter here, Officer Baconater.”

I spun around, facing the strange man. “Is that her? Is that…Death?”

The strange man sighed. “No, that's just Karma. She's here too. Try not to let her get to you.”

“Yeah, try not to let me get to you like I did that gerbil-faced overpaid fake goon squad virgin in a bad suit."

“I’M NOT A…nevermind. As I said, don't let her get to you. We’ll get you caught up soon enough. For now, read this.”

I was handed a leatherbound black book titled “Death's Watch”. The strange man informed me he wrote it himself, warning me to take it seriously.

His expressionless face broke for a second, finally giving me a peak at whatever humanity he housed. “Listen, if you're going to survive Death, there's something you have to do. You have to give up any pretense that you are in charge here. You are not. The inmate runs the asylum. The quicker you can accept that, the better. You are not the one who flips the switch. She is, and has always been, and will ever be.

You are here to provide entertainment and counsel to Lady Death. You are to use your formidable skills to de-escalate her when angry or bored, given her proclivity for pranking staff by killing them. We believe with your skill set you will be spared of this fate."

Though I don't quite remember entering, the door shut behind me. Or did whatever a door does when it stops existing. The strange man was gone, and the scene before me looked like it had been plucked from the set of a Southern Gothic period piece. An old-timey lamp turned on from atop a desk that wasn't there seconds before. The book became heavy in my hands. 

I knew what it meant without asking. The time for introductions was over. The time for learning had begun. I felt a sensation, I don't know, like when you can tell you got someone a really, really good birthday present. The feeling I got when my wife opened her PS5 on Christmas Day. I knew Lady Death was pleased. I was a quick learner and punctual to a fault. 

Still, while I am used to 24/7 surveillance,  it has never been for *me*. Not like this. Not with Her. Still, I had a job to do. 

I opened the heavy book. Page 1, chapter 1.

“Surviving Inmate 00:00 - Tips and Tricks” 

Fuck.
