
Last week’s dry journey
https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/XrUVxsRChe


"Hey, I just wanted to thank you for helping me and the kids out back there. You really saved our asses.", Martin says to Mike. 

For the last couple of hours Mike has been walking a good distance in front of us. The entities are reduced to confused wandering individuals, or small groups trying to make some kind of sense out of what’s going on. Trying to find some kind of niche in this suddenly diverse ecosystem. Things are about as “safe” as they’re getting.

Leo warned Martin, telling him that Mike needs space. But like every dad since the dawn of time, Martin has a little trouble reading the room when someone is miserable. 

"Shut the fuck up.", Mike says flatly. 

His wounds are starting to clot, but the world's most justified sad clown is hurting mentally and physically. He's practically dragging himself along. 

"No offense intended. Just wanted to...", Martin begins. 

 Mike stops dead, turning around. Martin runs into him. 

Tension springs up like a landmine. Martin looks nervous. 

"Fuck off.", Mike states, taking a long pause between both words.

Martin looks like he’s going to say something. He's clearly offended by Mike's refusal of his gratitude. 

Martin opens his mouth, good sense losing the battle to ire. 

Mike doesn't say a word, doesn't pull a weapon, just slowly, and obviously looks over to Martin's kids, then back to him. 

Martin pales and lets the subject drop. 

"The hell is wrong with that guy?", Martin says to me a while later after he puts some distance between himself and Mike. 

"No idea. But I'd probably stop poking the bear if I was you.", I reply. 

Gravel gives way to a teal sand. The landscape is flat, punctuated by large, meandering dunes. In the distance we see a large model of one of the Lost's cars, picking up wounded travellers and bringing them to what I would describe as a makeshift aid station. 

"Is Mike going to be okay?", I ask Demi. 

"Physically? I can staunch the wounds, but he needs a blood transfusion. Given basic medical supplies, I'm more than capable, but I’m not seeing any around here. 

Mentally? I don't think he’s the type that can process innocent blood on his hands. Withdrawn is not a state I've ever seen Michael in. It causes me… concern.", Demi replies. 

"They make car engines out of people, yet they’re risking their lives out here trying to save folks. 

Doesn't make sense to me.", Sveta remarks watching the lost in the distance. 

"It's what happens when you let people see others as less than human. You saw how that one reacted when we figured out what he was doing, he had no idea his actions were wrong. 

 I almost get it though. 

This place, it wants me to be a slayer, not a hero. And I assume it's much of the same for them.", Leo replies cryptically. 

The gates can't be more than an hour away at this point. Close enough it feels like we could sprint there if we wanted to. 

Over a dune to our right we see the front of the Lost's vehicle from before. This close up, we see it's a thing made for the kind of rough terrain you're likely to find around here. Ten spiked, bladed wheels, and a gore soaked bumper still festooned with the remains of various entities are the most obvious examples of this.

 The nearly silent conveyance breaches the hill.

The back end is struggling with the incline. Giving us a bit of time to talk. 

"If they're only pulling their Ed Gein stuff on people manipulated by whatever is under the sand, you think Martin and his kids would be safe with them?

I'm not saying they're slowing us down or anything, but historically, being around us is a dangerous hobby.", I suggest. 

Leo mulls it over for a moment. 

"You're making sense. Why don't we try to flag them...", Leo begins. Before he can complete the sentence though, the bladed vehicle crests the hill. Leo sees something inside that makes his eyes go wide, "Scatter!", he suddenly screams. 

I see it a second after he does, a familiar, wounded face. Bandaged, noseless, and with a look of pure rage. 

Our group has been together long enough, we nearly act as one. 

I wish I could say the same for Martin's family. 

It was only a second of confusion, a moment of looking around to try and see where the danger was before moving. But we live in a world where mistakes are punished harshly, no matter how minor. 

I don't want to describe the gore. I told you how the car was designed, you know how the human body is put together, how it looked is likely exactly how you'd expect. 

But I don't want to gloss over their deaths either. I don’t want you to see the poor souls caught up in this horrific adventure as just a body count. 

These were people. Everyday folks who didn't ask to be here, and who fought harder than us to survive. They didn't have the luxury of a born hero, or Jack the ripper as a companion. Just a will to live. 

In a fraction of a second everything they were, every struggle they went through, amounted to nothing. Their lives, and hope dashed by a slighted lunatic. 

The vehicle drifts, awkwardly spinning around to face us. Three of the Lost inside other than our old friend. With a noise like a ghost's wail, the thing speeds toward us. 

Mike tries to run toward the Lost before the car can get momentum, but he stumbles, trips, then seems to have trouble getting up. 

Leo's face is granite, there’s a depth in his eyes that goes beyond human. 

"I got this one.", Leo says, patting Mike on the shoulder as he walks by. The words have enough force the rest of us stand by. Not a word of protest.  

The Lost's car gains speed, sand being sent behind it in a massive plume. 

Leo begins to speak, Latin if I were to guess. His cadence has the sound of a prayer. 

The car is thirty feet away and closing fast. Not so much as a bead of sweat on Leo's brow. 

He ends with the sign of the cross, and a simple, mournful phrase in English, " I give you peace."

There’s a grinding, wet noise from within the vehicle. Some wheels spin randomly, others stop all together. It doesn't so much turn, as force itself sideways in an instant. 

Blood flies from the undercarriage as the car starts to lift on one side. One of the lost is killed trying to jump from a window as the twisted transport starts to roll over violently. 

Leo stands still, as if a few hundred pounds of rusted steel and rotten wood isn't flying towards him. 

The car comes to a stop, ripped apart by the violence of the malfunction, ten feet away from the hero. 

The remaining lost struggle to free themselves. I expect Leo to draw a weapon, but he simply starts to mumble something in what I think might be Hebrew. 

"Repent, and be saved.", Leo says, pointing to the Lost. The energy I feel coming off of him is like standing next to a furnace. It dwarfs anything I’ve seen him use before. 

"Repent? We are the only light in this god-forsaken place. We do what needs to be done to save those who are worth saving!

Who the fuck are you to judge us?", The bandaged man says, a rusted rifle in his hand. 

"No one. 

But I’m not the one that's going to be judging you. 

God isn't the domain of one specific religion. Every one has a tiny bit of insight into it's true nature. 

You think you're the white hats here? Maybe, maybe not. But I can't wait to find out.", Leo says, holding his right hand, palm forward. 

Around the lost, a beautiful, sourceless white light begins to form. Leo watches, stoic. 

At first the Lost are confused, almost interested. But after a few seconds, a look of understanding crosses their faces. The bandaged man tries to raise his rifle, a last ditch attempt at revenge but the metal starts to glow red hot, the ammunition cooks off.

The light gains intensity, a perfect circle of divine energy. The effect is nothing less than 'Old testament'. Layer by layer, the lost are destroyed. Something from beyond erasing them from existence. 

After about a minute the light is a pristine white pillar, too pure and bright to look directly at. For anyone that isn't Leo that is. 

When it stops, there’s nothing left. No blood, no flesh, not even a spec of ash. 

"What was that?" I ask, incredulous. 

Leo gives a satisfied look to the empty space where the Lost and the vehicle were moments before. 

"The first ritual was a painless death. One of the first things we learn. Coming across someone too far gone to save, is a common occurrence in my line of work. 

The second one though, I've never been able to do. I've always been more of a 'Pass the Ammo' than a ' Praise the lord' type. But the connection here, it's so clear. Honestly don’t remember it’s name though. ", Leo says, curiously. 

It feels callous to get moving immediately, but we do so none the less. Time is becoming more and more of a scarce resource. 

Mike tries to stand and falls. His eyes have a glazed over look, and his skin is nearly translucent under the layers of drying blood. 

"I'm done.", he says simply. Dragging himself to a sitting position. 

"The hell you are. I've not come this far to have you pick a dramatic moment to die.", Demi says. 

The massive man bends down, getting a shoulder under Mike's arm and drags him to a standing position. 

"I'm going to slow you down.", Mike says defiantly. He tries to break free from Demi, but there's no strength left in him. 

"Catch 22 isn't it? If you were whole, you'd be able to resist me. But you wouldn't need to. As it is, with you weak as a kitten you don't really have a choice, do you?", Demi replies smugly. 

"I fucking hate you Demi.", Mike counters, nearly out of breath. 

"I know.", Demi answers as we begin the final kilometer to the gate. 

We stand in front of the massive, rune inscribed, wrought iron gate. Slowly, with a hellish grinding it opens just enough to let us through. 

"Demi, any solid info you have?", Leo asks. 

"The last time I looked into it was around when the steam engine was invented, so my specifics may be out of date. But what are we if not the embodiment of a day late and a dollar short?

To start, an analogy may be helpful. 

Not to pick on anyone, but there is a country that loves firearms. So much so owning one is seen as a right. 

To the surprise of no one, this country is riddled with the misuse of firearms. 

This place is similar, but with paranormal power.", Demi answers. 

"Do not like the sounds of that.", Sveta says. 

"Nor should you. 

The residents are power hungry, and the major source of trade comes from captured people and entities from earth. 

This benefits us though, as getting back home will be, relatively speaking, easy. 

There is some infighting among the ruling groups, but in general, these are not the kind of people interested in a fight. They want slaves and playthings. And they are powerful enough to get them.", Demi replies.


"Open carry paranormal bullshit and a bunch of twisted cowards running the place. Sounds like par for the course.", Leo says as we take our first steps into the city. 

As we cross that threshold, things feel different. This place is infused with every type of energy possible, but things feel more, real than the desert. Strange, but not, artificial if that makes any sense. 

Wide streets and impossibly large buildings stretch for as far as the eye can see. I watch as sports cars drive beside carriages drawn by malformed horses. Neon signs compete with supernatural images, every storefront advertising some rare or twisted product or service. 

It's excess incarnate. It's gaudy. It's what happens when people who should be kept as far away from power as possible, aren't. 

I don't know if it's my own ability to understand, or simply obvious but I immediately notice something. Those in power are human, their forms may be twisted, but they’re human none the less. They seem to revel in keeping entities as servants. 

We attract a little bit of attention, but it seems to be more from the fact that we’re new arrivals than anything. As far as it goes, our band of weirdos kind of blends in. 

"Michael, stay with us...", Demi says as Mike starts to fall forward, colliding with a couple of bald gentlemen hiding their scarred faces under deep hoods. 

Mike grabs one for support and is pushed to the ground. The two bald men talk to each other in a language that I can't even guess at, size us up, then walk away. 

"Where the hell do we start?", Leo asks as we start to walk deeper into the city. 

"Where isn't the issue, look around, we couldn't toss a stone without hitting some kind of information broker, or soothsayer. 

How, is going to be the issue. We have no resources, nothing to barter.", Demi replies. 

"We don't have time to waste doing favors.", Sveta adds. 

"Someone would deliver us the bishop on a platter for a werewolf.", Demi says. 

"Watch it John Cleese.", Sveta replies. 

Our attention goes to an odd, muffled jingling noise. 

Mike holds a small, black velvet sack, cinched up with silver wire. 

"Any of this shit worth enough to get me patched up?", Mike asks, eyes glazed. 

Demi takes the sack, and prods the contents. 

"With enough left over to let us grease the gears of corruption a bit. 

Good work, you little magpie.", Demi says with a smile. 

We start to discuss the plan. After a few minutes, a voice cuts through the din of the city. 

"Demetrious? Demetrious!

Jack! You old son of a bitch! You finally made it down here, did you?", says a small, mustached man.

He's dressed smartly, his suit is slickly tailored, but in an early 1900s style. A bowler hat tops his head, and a stethoscope hangs out of one pocket. 

Demi looks unsure for a moment, then realization washes over his face.

"Herman?", Demi says quizzically. 

"That's Dr. Mudgett to you, you old huckster. How have you been?", The small man replies. 

"Stories upon stories. But I’m not laden with time at the moment.", Demi admits. 

"Fair enough, looks like you finally made the big trip. Probably out to set yourself up as quickly as possible. 

Got yourself a nice little collection of livestock though.", Herman observes. 

"Believe it or not, no. These are my compatriots as of late, and we are on the hunt for a religiously themed lunatic. Haven't happened to see him have you?", Demi asks. 

"You said doctor, right? As in MD?", Mike says.

He's ignored by both Demi and Herman. 

"Can't say that I have. But I haven't been looking either. 

I'd offer you a roof for your stay, but after being here for this long Page has gotten a bit ornery. Gets a little territorial at night.", Herman states. 

"Who's Page?", Sveta asks. 

"My hotel, young lady.", Herman replies. 

"Is anyone hearing me?", Mike asks. 

"That must have been an undertaking, getting the old girl here. 

You still keep a stock of medical equipment, or is my friend here out of luck?", Demi questions casually. 

"Old habits die hard. Sundown isn't for a few hours, let’s fix your broken toy.", Herman offers.

We find ourselves deep within a twisting, maze-like hotel, complete with a much needed medical suite. 

Besides Demi, everyone seems a little on edge about the place. Strange noises echo from just out of sight, objects turn slightly, or get drawn across surfaces of their own accord. 

Now, I can't say that the haunting symptoms didn't phase me. That being said, what I felt chilled my blood. 

It was like being deep inside something living. This place, this ancient collection of plaster, beams and steel, it's alive. It's not haunted, or cursed. Years of torment, violence and screwing around with the void has given the place itself autonomy. 

Herman was beyond stocked up with blood of any type we could think of. Not to mention rows upon rows of organs and flesh floating in various colored solutions. 

Mike lays on a gleaming steel table, barely awake. He's hooked up to an IV and slowly looking less like a mangled corpse. 

The rest of us sit around a sterile looking desk, Herman and Demi chatting like old friends. 

"I suggest setting up camp at Agnus' tavern. It caters to the just passing through crowd, not likely to run into too much trouble. 

As far as your Bishop? Give me half a day, and I'll find someone who knows which direction he went. 

That being said, my payment, is what you'd call, non-negotiable.", Herman says. 

"Let's hear it.", Leo says. His tone is a challenge. 

"Hair, and fingernails from your wolf and whatever the hell the little one is.", Herman replies, not missing a beat. 

Leo and Sveta share a look. She shrugs. 

"For that kind of price, I want a rundown on how this place works.", Sveta replies. 

"Fair enough. Knowledge is power after all. 

You have four groups that run the city. The quislings, the reapers, the sculptors, and the Deans." Herman begins. 

As he says the name of the last group, Leo gets a sickened look on his face. 

"I always thought that was a rumor...", Leo says. 

"Not at all. Now, the original is long dead, and they are the least of the four. But even your kind end up here from time to time Hero. 

The quislings are those that try their damndest to emulate those of the void. Twist their bodies, turn themselves ethereal, kidnap followers, all to convince themselves they are something they are not. 

The sculptors help them do this. They deal in the craft of flesh. The best of them can turn a person into a nightmare. 

The reapers control the river to the void. Quickest way to get there if you need to, but they drive a hard bargain to say the least.", Herman finishes. 

None of this sounds promising, but I can't concentrate, this place, Page is trying to worm it's way into my mind. 

We spend the next few uncomfortable hours hearing Demi and Herman make the most disturbing small talk you can think of. 

Mike is covered in stitches, gaunt, and clearly in pain, but he can walk. All of us take advantage of this to get as far away from Page as we can. 

Agnus' Inn is the most welcome hit of boring possible. The inside is full of wounded people, looking like refugees in hell. 

Agnus herself is a massive woman, short red hair and a look that makes it clear, she doesn't put up with shit. Her face isn't marred, but to be nice, it wasn't made for magazine covers either.  

"Anyone you're looking for isn't here.", she says with a sneer. 

"I know what we look like beautiful, but trust me, we're not interested in causing havoc..", Mike says with a wry grin. 

"You're a bad liar. But not a dangerous one I think. One wrong move from any of you though and I’m selling your pieces to the Sculptors.", Agnus promises. 

And with that we get ourselves something we haven't had in a long time. Privacy and a real bed.


Alone, sitting in a cheap hotel room, it feels like my brain unclenches for the first time in forever. 

I'm laying on a shitty bed, across from a shitty 90's television, hearing a shitty minifridge hum louder than it has any right to. But it's a slice of heaven in the middle of hell. 

When you find yourself jumping from one crisis ( or body.) to the next, you lose the luxury of reflection. As the minutes turn to hours, I indulge myself. 

I wonder what's waiting for me after this, back in the real world. I think about how we are going to stop the bishop. But the subject I find myself most drawn to is neither of these two things. 

I start to think about what I bring to our group. The more I do, the more I feel, inadequate. 

As a possessed toy, I had a lot going for me as sad as that is to say. I was scary, lethal, I could get places and see things no one else could. But now, I start to think of myself as the weak link in our chain. 

The reason I’m letting you guys in on this little pity party, is to show you what kind of mindset led me to wander the streets of the city, dead set on finding things out. 

I'm scared, vulnerable, and unarmed. But I know that spark inside of me can help. If I can figure out how, that is.

Just walking the streets I see the depravity of man. Petty tyrants with diseased minds walking with retinues of branded , mutilated serfs.

I've just about made up my mind to try and strike up a conversation with what I'm fairly sure is a ghoul when I'm distracted. 

"It's Punch, right? What a stroke of luck, I was trying to find one of Demi's friends.", Herman says. 

Something about the way he managed to pop out of the woodwork unsettles me. The streets are thin, and I don't understand how he could have got this close without me noticing. 

Then again, who am I to judge?

"You found something out about the Bishop?", I ask. 

"More than that. Your dress wearing friend has ruffled a lot of feathers around here. I had people practically begging to tell me where he was. 

One even knew a thing or two about what he was. Gave me a weapon that'll take him out before he has time to blink.

Why don't you stop by Page, pick it up and spend the night thinking about how slow you want to make the Bishop's death?", Herman replies proudly. 

"I thought you said it wasn't a good idea for us to come by at night?", I question. 

"For Demi, or the rest. But you come from a family who deals well with the paranormal, am I right?", Herman inquires. 

"Yeah, but up until we got here, I was a possessed toy. I have no real idea of what my family was.", I answer. 

"Doesn't matter, your kind are subtle. It's not a thing you wield, it's just who you are. Come on, it'll be a ten minute trip.", Herman says. 

I follow Herman back to his hotel. In the dim of night it takes on a more sinister appearance. I swear I can see it breathing. 

I shove down panic, telling myself this is what I was meant to do. This is my place in our group. 

The fear doesn't subside as we enter. Every loose object seems like a loaded gun, every deep shadow moves in ways that aren't right. There's a noise in my mind, like screaming from another room. It's Page. 

"See, she isn't going to bite. She just likes keeping people on their toes. 

You hungry? I could toss on a couple of steaks.", Herman offers. 

"I'm good, thanks.", I say, doing my best to ignore the feeling in my mind. 

"Not a problem. The weapon is in room 213. Go up the stairs, it looks like a sharp, wire wrapped spear-tip. I'm going to get your clown friend some antibiotics, god damned miracle he isn't dead from sepsis already.", Herman says. 

I ascend the nearly pitch-black stairwell. The noise in my mind goes from nagging to distracting. 

"I know you don't want me here. I'm just going to get my stuff and I'll be gone.", I say, hoping to calm Page down. 

For a moment that soundless noise stops, then comes back hard enough to make me see spots. I concentrate on blocking it out. 

"Go fuck myself it is.", I say to the building. 

Room 213 is easy enough to find. Though, unlike Agnus' place, it is anything but mundane. 

Walls are caked with decades old blood. The floor is covered in scratch marks, and all of the furniture has been damaged beyond repair. 

Sitting on a lopsided dresser, is the weapon Herman spoke of. 

I'm half way to it, when I hear the door behind me slam shut. I turn, heart racing. I start to develop a migraine trying to shut out Page. 

A small opening in the door is slid, behind the empty space, is Herman. 

"Dirty pool, I know, but you're a once in a lifetime opportunity buddy. 

See, most people of note have one or two of your kind. You're rare, and it's a nice status symbol. 

The problem is, it's been so long since the world has had a use for your people, no one knows what you can really do. 

Now, the slaves, either don't know, or they aren't talking. And no one wants to waste their investment on, let's call it 'destructive testing'. 

But you, my friend, are found money. I'm going to figure out what makes you tick, then use that knowledge to get myself more favors than I can ever possibly use. 

Not going to be a fun time for you, but if it makes you feel any better, I’m still going to help Demi find the Bishop. And, let's face it, it's not like you were doing them any favors. Think of this as your contribution to the job.", Herman ends his rant with a twisted grin before he slides the small window shut. 

I fall to my knees. I feel stupid, horrified, trapped and useless all at the same time. Fear and depression strip my focus, and I hear Page. 

"Run!", she screams, her warning reaching me far too late.


Negotiations went, okay
