I don’t know where all this water is going.  Everything I’ve learned says that we should be flooding right now.  The ground is saturated.  We started seeing standing pools of water in the grass days ago, all over campus.  It should have gotten worse, as the rain has been unrelenting, but it’s like the progression abruptly *stopped*.

Professor Monotone went down to the river recently to check where it’s at and while it’s elevated, its not at anything higher than what it normally hits during the spring when all the snow melts - or at least, in years prior when they actually *had* snow.  I’m trying not to think about that too much.  My anxiety can handle only so much existential dread.

I know about the river levels not because he told me specifically, but because he *brought it up in class*.  He didn’t even do that thing where he just throws out a piece of information and leaves us to figure out why it’s significant, like some of my other professors in the geology department do.  No, he explicitly said that with all the rain we’ve been getting he’d expect it to be flooding at this point.  But it’s not.  And then he was like ‘hmmm this is all very interesting’ and I of course knew that *interesting* means *unnatural fuckery* but the rest of the students were like ‘is this going to be on the exam’ and when he said no they immediately lost interest.  So while I initially was sitting at my desk, screaming internally in panic at Professor Monotone’s recklessness to bring up that topic in front of a full class of students, I guess it’s not actually something to worry about.  I sometimes forget that not every student is as psychotic about their classes as I am.  Is it the scholarship that made me this way?  I feel that having to keep my grades up for my scholarship was the catalyst for me to become the worst version of myself.

Not everyone lost interest, unfortunately.  I took a covert glance around the classroom and saw a few staring thoughtfully out the windows.  I am a junior now, after all.  These are the advanced degree level classes.  Everyone is here because they want to be here at this point.

As Cassie so often puts it, not my problem.  Hopefully they’ll assume it’s something-something water tables and not something-something alternate dimensions.

Because my personal theory is that the water is going into the traveling river.

Josh thinks I should try summoning the river to test that theory, as well as to find out just how much authority I have over it now.  He is hyped about the idea that I might be able to exert some control over the inhuman things on campus.  It’s a faint silver lining to the whole situation, but it is undeniably a silver lining.  Surprisingly, Cassie agrees with him.  I thought that Josh was just stepping into Maria’s role, now that Maria is… not here… but it seems like the entire dynamic is shifting.

I don’t think this is what the devil meant by everything would change, though.  I’ve got a feeling that it’s something to do with the unceasing rain.

Everyone on campus is talking about it.  Everywhere I go, I hear students muttering about it, I hear them talking before class.  It’s not like when I was a freshman, either.  There are no upperclassmen to ask if this is normal.  The seniors are only one year ahead of me and none of us know anything.  The professors, when asked, have admitted that this is unusual but declined to speculate.  (only Professor Monotone threw it out there like a hand grenade)  I kind of wonder if this were a different university if campus safety would have made a statement by now, like yes it’s raining a lot, no we’re not going to flood but take these precautions anyway.  I can’t see them doing that here.  If they admit that something weird was going on with regards to the rain, I will go out, buy a hat, and eat it.

Because it all seems to come back to the rain, doesn’t it?  The river.  How it changes things.  Even some of the inhumans seemed to depend on it - the flickering man was rendered vulnerable when the rain vanished and if the campus has a will of its own, I wonder if it was the university itself that revoked that from him.

It’s a troubling thought.  It would mean that the rain is controlled by campus.

As a reminder, I write these posts in stages since I’m having memory problems.  A few paragraphs here and there, as I think about about it and before I can forget.  So you all get to find things out with me in the same order, albeit with a massively condensed timeline (minutes as opposed to days).

Obviously I’ve been avoiding Grayson.  I blocked his phone number.  Cassie did too.  (and that brings up an interesting question - who pays for his cell phone?  I bet it’s a line item hidden in some budget somewhere that no one questions)  We’ve avoided talking about the Grayson problem.  Cassie sees it as a simple thing to resolve now.  We shove his soul back to wherever it came from.  Put James where he belongs.  Get Maria back.  Done.  The conflict with how we save everyone was made easier by removing Grayson from the list of people she actually wants to save.

In her mind, the devil did us a great favor by allowing Grayson to reveal his true colors.

I am… conflicted.

I’ve seen the place Grayson came from.  It bled out of his fear and into my mind, through that connection he’s established between us.  It is a place of vast power and weight, but also of emptiness, of isolation.  I didn’t think that inhuman things could feel fear, but Grayson can, and this is what terrifies him.  Being trapped in that place.  He wants to be here, with us, and considering I’ve only seen him hurt people to further his own survival…

If we’re going to condemn Grayson for that, then we should feel the same about James.  But we don’t.  We’re trying to save James, even if it means leaving Maria trapped in some half-existence while we figure it out.

Is it wrong of me to have sympathy for something inhuman?

It terrifies me.  I know that I want to stay me, I feel sick whenever I think of what Grayson proposed.  I don’t want to lose myself, I don’t want to *be* something else.  But… I’m not sure I trust myself either.  Because despite Cassie’s constant reminders that “I shouldn’t light myself on fire to keep someone else warm”, I’m not sure I’m going to be strong enough to fight back.  It’s not like when I chose to leave my hometown and go to college.  That was my decision I made for myself.  It didn’t impact anyone else.

If I choose myself over Grayson, then he’s gone.  He’s cast into that vastness.  And I’ve… always chosen someone else at the expense of myself.

I’m not sure I’m strong enough to change that.

So my strategy right now is to not get to that point.  It’s… not going great.  I have no idea what to do.  I’ve never felt so lost.  I know I should be strategizing, but it’s like my emotions keep getting in the way of my brain and before I know it it’s been an hour of staring helplessly at the wall of my bedroom.  And it’s just me, too, I have to figure this out because I’m not sure if anyone else will.  Cassie seems to have accepted that it’s either Grayson or me and she’s picked me.  I’m worried she’s off scheming with Josh without me.  In fact, now that I type it out, I’m positive that’s what she’s doing.

Great.

The devil certainly hasn’t shown up with any convenient solutions.  Can’t say I expected it.  He got what he wanted and his role here is done.

Unfortunately, the longer I struggle, the more time Grayson has to finalize his own plans to… make us the same person???? However that’s supposed to work.  And after a few days of being blocked on my phone, he decided to come find me in person.  I shouldn’t be surprised.  I couldn’t avoid him forever.

Especially since he knows where I live.

And my class schedule.

Not sure how he got the latter but I’m sure it was through wildly unethical means and/or whatever influence he has over the university as a whole.  While I was unnerved to see him waiting for me outside of the geology building, I can’t say I was surprised either.  There was no avoiding it.  I’d have to speak to him at some point.  He was unlikely to leave me alone.  I left the building, walking briskly right past him, forcing him to hurry to keep up and fall in step with me.

“I haven’t changed my mind,” I said tersely.  “I don’t want what you have planned.”

“I didn’t expect you to.  This is why I didn’t tell you the details until it was too late to undo it all.”

I swallowed hard upon hearing that, as if I were trying to swallow my fear.  No.  It wasn’t too late.  I refused.

“You better have a backup plan, because I’m going to make sure this little idea of yours fails.”

He laughed.  It wasn’t necessarily a cruel laugh.  Incredulous.  I bristled at hearing it.  I might not be inhuman like him, but that didn’t mean I was helpless.

“Didn’t I kill the flickering man?” I snapped.  “You think I can’t stop you too?”

His face furrowed in frustration.  The rain was intensifying, the sky overhead growing darker.

“You had help,” he said.

The university revoked the rain.  That’s right.  I stopped walking and turned to face him, balling my hands into fists.  That wasn’t all though.  Hadn’t I-

A thought occurred to me.

“The eye,” I said quietly.  “From my freshman year.  I killed that.”

“You did,” he replied, his voice also soft.  

And this time, he didn’t point out that I had help.

He must not know about the devil.  It’s not much of an advantage, but I’ll take it.

“How… involved were you in creating that thing?”

He closed his eyes for a moment.  The rain had soaked through his hair, plastering it to his forehead, and it ran down to drop off his eyelashes.  He told me, calmly, without a hint of emotion, that he had not directly been involved.  But he was the reason.  The college always had a replacement it was preparing for Grayson.  Sometimes he needed them, when his current body was failing.  Most of the time he didn’t.  But it was always there, his replacement, being shepherded to that pool of water so that he could make the transition when it was time.

The flickering man had seen me before, so many more.

And the eye.  Well.  I’d seen it in the laundry lady’s realm, hadn’t I?  And the steam tunnels?  Everything was connected and the pool, the pool was a *doorway*.  One opened by the president in his bid for immortality.

Something had come through.  That was what killed Patricia and the others with her.

“It’s hardly the first time that’s happened,” he said grimly.  “Can’t say I’m very happy about them using *my* gateway.  But I tucked it away because I didn’t want it rampaging all over campus.  It was a useful weapon for a little while, but I can’t say I was terribly upset when you killed it.  It made me realize your potential.”

I took a step backwards, away from him.  I was realizing that he had more control over the creatures on campus than I thought.  And the ones he couldn’t control…

“Were you using me to kill things you didn’t want around?” I whispered.

“A little,” he admitted.  “You didn’t seem to mind, did you, always hurrying to put yourself in danger-”

He trailed off and it wasn’t because he noticed that I was getting upset, it was because he was staring off over my shoulder at something in the sky.  He frowned and his shoulders tightened.  He reached for my hand, to pull me along with him, but I snatched it out of his grasp and hastily put another few feet of distance between us.

“Hang on,” I said.  “Where is Josh?  He was supposed to meet us.”

I glanced around.  Campus was remarkably empty, even with the rain.  We were between class times.  Normally there’d be at least a handful of students braving the weather with rain jackets and umbrellas, hurrying to class.

“He’s not here yet,” Grayson replied.  “I asked you to leave class so we could talk without them.”

My chest felt tight.  Those memory gaps.  All those moments I couldn’t remember.

“You’re the reason I can’t remember things,” I whispered.

Maybe… maybe Cassie is right about what we need to do.

“You weren’t ready,” he said urgently.  “*I* wasn’t ready to tell you everything.”

I was walking backwards now, keeping distance between us, my horror churning inside me and becoming something else, something I was starting to feel more and more these days.

“You’ve been in a human body long enough to know this isn’t okay!” I snapped.  “You don’t get to decide when someone is ready - what someone gets to remember-”

Words were failing me.  I was breathing too fast now, sucking in air in deep, desperate gasps.

“I’m doing the best I can!” Grayson was breathing fast too, one hand raised to clutch at his brow.  “Everyone here is so - difficult - you don’t know what you want and barely know who you are - and I’m *trying* to give you what you want -”

Maybe Grayson has been trapped inside a human body for so long that he’s just as lost and uncertain as the rest of us.  I came here with no other thought than to get away from the life I had, get away from my town, and I’d figure out the rest once I was here.  But I hadn’t.  I didn’t know what I was going to do after graduation.  I had no idea if I was doing things right, if I was going to be okay, if I would someday be happy with my life.  Grayson offered… certainty.  I could leave all that doubt behind me.

But only if I wasn’t human anymore.

He sucked in a deep breath and then took a deliberate step towards me, his gaze once again settling on the sky, focused on some distant point behind me.

“We don’t have time for this,” he snapped.  “They’re hunting today.”

“*They*?”

He pointed.  I glanced back over my shoulder - and I saw them.

Gliding through the air, undulating like flags, barely visible in the muted sunlight.  Like bubbles floating on a stream, I thought.

The swimmers.  The swimmers which had been trapped in the swimming pool but the tree was dead, the roots were gone, and they were free and so very ravenous after being imprisoned for so long.

This time, when Grayson grabbed my hand, I ran with him.  He wasn’t running for the closest building and for a brief moment I didn’t understand why, and I slowed and looked towards the nearby entrance.  I saw a few faces looking back at me, dull and oblivious to the swarm of gelatinous hell-manta-rays sweeping across the sky.  The other students.  They were waiting out the rain or they were in class, but they were there, packed inside those buildings.  And perhaps the first wave of the swimmers would simply splatter against the glass, but there were so many of them, they were hunting as a pack, and if the glass broke - if they got inside -

Grayson was leading them away from other students.

“We’ll get out in the open,” he shouted at me, over the roar of the rain, as we ran, “and escape through the river.  Hopefully they’ll scatter into smaller, more manageable packs in confusion.”

Manageable.  Was he referring to campus security?  Could they handle this before someone was eaten?

“But you’re in charge around here!” I shrieked.

“They’re ravenous bags of gelatin and teeth” he yelled back.  “And I’m in a human body right now, you know, the whole *issue* you’re upset about?!  I’m *meat* to them, same as you.”

He snatched his hand back and whirled, turning to face the incoming swarm of swimmers.

“Fine,” he said tersely.  “I’ll just take care of all of them, if that’s what you want.  I don’t have that tree drinking me up anymore.  I should be able to do this.”

I watched in horror as they swept down on us, glittering like glass, their teeth almost indistinguishable from the falling rain.  So many.  No longer content to wait for the pool to be refilled and for their prey to come to them.  I cowered behind Grayson, wondering if I should call the river, if perhaps escape was the right move here, but Grayson stood there unflinchingly.  He stared up at them and then he exhaled softly, closed his eyes.

And the rain.

It went through them.

Like needles.  Straight through.

I heard them scream, in unison, a thin whine like a distant siren, despairing, agonized, as the rain shredded them and then there was silence and I watched as they splattered against the ground in a thin layer that the rain continued to beat against, washing them away into the grass.

It was over in seconds.

I wanted to throw up.

Grayson turned to face me.  His skin was pale, almost gray - like rotting meat - and his eyes were fever bright.  He raised a shaking hand and wiped away a thin trickle of blood from his lips.

“You see?” he cried then, flinging his arms wide.  “Do you realize what I am now?  Do you understand why I don’t want to go back to what I was?”

I didn’t.  Or perhaps I didn’t *want* to understand.

“I AM THE RAIN!”

He stared at me, smiling, eyes wide, breathing hard and there was a rasp to it, an ominous rattle.  I saw the elation in his eyes, because he *was* powerful and he wasn’t hiding it from me anymore, it was all out in the open and I knew what he was.  And I saw the desperation there as well.

That vast emptiness.  The isolation.  Being everywhere and being unable to interact with anything.  My breath caught in my lungs.

Grayson isn’t just an inhuman.  

This whole area.  They believed the rain to be more than it is.  And when the college was created, with students that were from out of state like myself, it only made it stronger.

Don’t go out when it rains.

Maybe that didn’t start with the college.

And then when the rain was something *more*, something inhuman, possibly even something *ancient* - they gave it a body to inhabit.

“We’re going to break this cycle,” he said, lowering his arms, his eyes still fixed on me.  “You and I.  And you won’t be scared anymore, you won’t be weak, and I’ll be able to leave, I won’t be trapped, I won’t be *scattered*-”

The university president did something monstrous.  He took an inhuman force of nature, something that didn’t think or feel as we understand it, and he shoved it into human flesh and give it all those things it never would have had.  I can’t blame Grayson for not wanting to go back.

And because I felt my resolve crumbling, because I kept seeing the swimmers falling apart in front of me and thinking that I wouldn’t be scared, I *would* have power, I’d be ancient myself - I ran.  I ran and ran and it was useless, so fucking useless, because the rain fell everywhere [I](https://alderrayne.com/) [went.](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
