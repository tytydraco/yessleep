I ran with Nancy’s arm wrapped awkwardly around my shoulder, Liz trailing close behind. Tim was gone. Dead, judging by the screams. And whatever killed him might have been lurking in the underbrush, ready to pounce at any second.

Attacked on all sides by branches and bracken, we battled our way forward, never slowing down. We couldn’t waste a single second. Already it was dusk. In another hour, we’d be fumbling around, blind.

It felt like I was on autopilot. I just kept putting one foot in front of the other. Then again. And again. Each time we hit a bump or stumbled Nancy grimaced and took a quick, sharp inhale of breath. By the time we reached the point where the foliage thinned out, I was severely gasping for air and my lungs were on fire.

I barrelled along until an exposed root caught my toe and sent my passenger and I sprawling across the ground. Now that all the adrenaline had worn off, I couldn’t summon the strength to hoist her up again.

“Come on,” Liz cried. Although our combined strength was enough to hoist Nancy up, we could only carry her in short bursts. Seeing no other choice, I had Liz help me drag the injured lady into the shelter of a small grove of oak trees.

“Just gimme a minute to rest,” I said, between heavy gasps.

Nancy grabbed a notebook and a pen from her pack—grimacing from the effort—and started writing.

“What are you doing?” Liz asked, confused. Rather than answer, the American simply let her pen whizz across the page.

Part of me wanted to throw the towel in and have one final cigarette. None of us had slept for more than 24 hours and it felt like I’d run six marathons, back-to-back. If we were already doomed, I may as well have gone our smoking, right?

What even attacked Tim? We’d found our tour guide’s corpse out there. And the voices, they’d been used to lure us into an especially dense section of forest, leaving us vulnerable.

Maybe a group of cultists called the forest home. Maybe we’d trespassed on their land, and this was all a sick method of psychological torture. Except judging by the speed with which Tim got dragged away, the attacker couldn’t possible have been human…

From way off in the distance, a series of low giggles and whispers drifted along like wisps of toxic smoke. I jumped up, suddenly alert, and then tried scooping Nancy up.

“C’mon we can’t stay here,” I said after she swatted my outstretched hands aside.

“No, *you* can’t.”

Liz and I exchanged a look.

Nance said, “Don’t drag this out. It’s getting dark, we’re lost, and you can’t carry me around forever.”

She was right, of course. Already my shirt was a drenched rag against my back and my spongey legs struggled to support my own weight, never mind hers. Yet despite this, I couldn’t bring myself to abandon her.

No doubt aware I was struggling with this decision, the American smiled. “Don’t play the hero, Darren. I’m done. Here.” With great difficultly, she reached over and stuffed her notebook into my hands. “I wrote a note for my daughter. Make sure she gets it.”

Liz said, “Nancy, the cabin can’t be much further. We’ll get you to a hospital.”

At that moment, it occurred to me how similar Mom and Liz were. Despite her brattish nature, a noble selflessness still shone through when it counted.

Nancy entered a harsh coughing fit. You could really hear the liquid in her throat. “The longer you stand here gabbing with me the more time whatever got the others has to catch up.”

“No,” Liz said, her cheeks wet with tears.

“GO,” Nance snapped. Then, softly, to me she said, “Darren, take your sister and get the hell out of here. Do it for Angela.”

My thoughts whipped back to Mom—to how she’d always insisted that, above all else, I needed to look out for my baby sister. *You would take care of Liz, right? If anything ever happened to me…*

“What, are you waiting for a green flag or something? GO.”

Liz leaned forward and gave Nance a hug. From the way the American clenched her jaw, you could tell the pressure really stung.

“You’re sure about this?” I asked, as Liz stepped away wiping snot off her chin.

Nancy leaned over, scooped up a fist-sized rock, and smiled. “Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine. Now enough of this sentimental crap—GO.”

We went.

The track was flanked on either side by wild grass and crooked branches thrust out at chest-height, like sweeping arms. Liz and I moved as fast as we could, our heavy packs thrashing around on our shoulders.

Less than five minutes along the trail, a shriek went up from the point where we’d left Nancy. The sound was thick with agony, climbing higher and higher, and then suddenly stopping.

Liz and I froze, shot each other a look.

“Run,” I said.

We hit the gas, unsure whether we were even going the right direction. Not that it mattered. What mattered was putting as much distance between us and the thing lurking in the forest as possible.

As night crept along, we found ourselves stepping into hidden ditches or letting sharp boughs hook inside our jackets, so I grabbed the flashlight from my pack and angled it forward.

The temperature plummeted ten degrees, enough that the cold cut us to the bone, and I couldn’t even summon the strength to swat away the gnats and midges settling on my face.

We just kept going. At times, it felt more like falling than running. I’m not sure how long this went on for. Now and again, I’d hear branches scrap together and point the beam at great walls of looming trees. Or a crooked bough. More than once, Liz came close to nosediving forward, and I needed to hold her steady.

“I can’t keep going,” she said, already half-asleep.

“You can,” I snapped. “Come on.”

I nudged her once, twice. But the tired woman had already reached the edge of her reserves.

Who was I kidding? We couldn’t march on endlessly. My twanging leg muscles started howling several miles back, and I’m pretty sure that was blood sloshing around my boots.

There hadn’t been a single sound for miles. Maybe we’d shaken our pursuer off. Or maybe if had it’s fill with Nancy and Tim and lost interest in us.

Much as I wanted to collapse right there on the spot, the tent would at least offer *some* protection. I dragged Liz into a flat patch of dirt and slid off my pack and told her to hold the flashlight.

While my hands rummaged around inside the rucksack, I said, “When was the last time you ate?”

She took a moment, concentrated hard. “Breakfast.”

I tossed her a protein bar, to which she made a gagging noise. This made me smile.

“Eat up,” I said, already rolling out the ground sheet. “We’re going full tilt tomorrow and you’ll need all the energy you can get.” Then, doing my best mom impersonation, I added, “Think of all the starving children in the world who haven’t a bite to eat and you with a big plate in front of you!”

We both chuckled half-heartedly. It cheered me up to see that, despite the circumstances, she hadn’t lost her sense of humour.

The cabin couldn’t have been far. All we needed to do was survive until dawn, then we could charge full throttle to our destination.

While I forced metal pegs into the cold, hard dirt, Liz started sobbing.

“Mom’s dead, isn’t she? I mean, whatever got Tim and Nancy, it got her. And the others.”

I hesitated. Our mother would have known *exactly* what to say. Now the role of therapist fell upon me.

I cleared my throat, the loss hitting me especially hard. “Are you kidding? There’s nothing scarier than Mom when she’s in a bad mood. If whatever got Tim and the others tried any funny business with her, I’d feel sorry for it.”

A faint smile crept across Liz’s face. “Darren.”

“Yeah?”

“I’m sorry.”

“For what?”

“For being such a shit. Not just on this trip. I mean…generally.”

There were a few beats of awkward silence. I let out a deep sigh. “I’m the one who should be sorry. You’re a teenager. Being a shit is what you’re *supposed* to do. But I’m the adult, and all I’ve ever done is snap at you. Maybe I should have tried harder at being a good big brother.”

She held out her hand. “Truce?”

We shook on it. “Truce.”

It’s funny: Liz and I's strained relationship was always a real sore spot for Mom, but the camping trip turned out to be the perfect bonding experience. I mean, sure, we’d probably die ten minutes after signing the peace treaty, but you couldn’t question the results.

From beyond the clearing, there came a creak, a thud, and a trample of dead leaves. As both Liz and I surveyed our surroundings, a low scream came pouring out of the darkness. “AhhhhHHHHHH.”

It sounded like Mom. Well, this trick wouldn’t work a second time.

“Get in the tent,” I said to Liz. We rushed inside—*Close the door, you don’t live in a barn*—where I zipped the flap shut.

Liz and I faced one another, panting. There was no point keeping watch. Tim got ripped away at superhuman speed. You couldn’t fend off an attack like that. Our only option was to batten down the hatches and pray.

From deep within the brush, another scream rang out. “AhhhhHHHHHH.”

Mom’s cries started off low, rising, rising, rising in pitch. Except the cries sounded identical to the first time, as though someone had played back a recording.

Dead leaves crunched outside, and a rank smell, like old meat in a humid room, drifted toward us.

Quiet steps accompanied sobs, low cries for help, and at least one wail. We heard Mom under attack, crying for help. Tim in pain as he called after his wife. Ulrich choking out a desperate plea. And finally, the wail of a Nokia Phone.

Liz and I exchanged a look. That was the ringtone we’d heard earlier.

“You are one ugly motherfucker.” Now it sounded like Nancy was *right* outside—like only a thin strip of cloth separated us and her voice. I felt a sense of probing. Whatever lay out there was playing with different sounds. Parroting people to see whether we’d take the bait.

At the sound of a pack getting tossed around, chills went racing down my spine. In the mad scramble to get inside, I’d forgotten the rucksack. Which meant I’d *also* forgotten the map. Along with the lighter fluid. And everything else.

Stupid, Darren. Stupid, stupid. I patted my pockets. If the pack got destroyed or stolen, we’d only have a knife, a lighter, and a half a carton of cigarettes to survive on.

“Is someone there? Hello?” Mom’s voice again. These words hit me deep in the stomach, acidic and bitter. Because now I knew if this thing could mimic our mother, that meant she was…*gone*.

By now, it seemed clear the creature wasn’t human. Oh sure, it could make itself *sound* like one. But it didn’t understand how we thought, felt, or acted. It simply mimicked our voices. That’s why the cries sounded so quiet at first—to trick us into pursing them. If not for Ulrich and me, Tim would have chased his wife’s cries straight into the ditch, his own personal cage. Once that ploy failed, we got lured into a den section of forest where we couldn’t see an attack coming.

Why move Ulrich’s corpse, though?

Because he was the bait...

Of course. I’d gotten wise to the trick and insisted we push on, but even I couldn’t resist the prospect of reuniting with Ulrich. His corpse was the cheese in the mousetrap.

Low giggles and random whispers rang out. As the stench of rot and decay filling the tent in choking waves, I grabbed and held Liz. It was like rocking a baby she felt so frail.

I got the impression our assailant had grown frustrated and therefore pulled out every scheme in its arsenal. It didn’t know *what* it was saying, only that this cruel trick had enticed other humans out of hiding.

“Mommy, is that you?”

Wait, the child’s voice. Was that how it coaxed Mom and Tammy away from the campsite? If mom heard a child’s frightened cries, she would have no doubt gone charging after them with zero regard for her own safety.

My thoughts whipped back to my childhood. To how she always chased away the monsters in my closet and then sung me to sleep.

That’s all I wanted, just then. For Mom to come back and chase the monster away.

Thoughts of her got swallowed by a quiet laugh bleeding off into the distance, leaving behind an uneasy silence. Maybe if we held our nerve until dawn, we’d survive?

Except we’d have no way of finding the cabin without the map. The dense forest dragged us off course, we could have been anywhere. Unless I got it back, we’d wander in circles until we starved or our pursuer returned—whichever came first.

Swallowing a giant gulp, I moved to unzip the tent.

Liz grabbed me by the arm. Through chattering teeth, she whispered, “What the fuck are you doing?”

“The map.”

“Fuck the map.”

We went back and forth on this until I motioned for her to relax and pulled the zip back, only a few inches. Although I couldn’t see very far ahead, the forest lay completely still. No signs of life, no sudden movements.

The pack was sitting up ahead, all torn up along one side. Through the hole I could see the map. One gust of air and our hopes of finding civilization would have gone soaring off into the gloom.

I pulled down the zip as quietly as humanly possible.

The forest moist breath made hidden branches scrap together roughly. Five metres ahead, the map fluttered around. I quickly confirm the knife was still strapped to my waist.

I crawled forward on my hands and knees and extended my left arm until my fingertips grazed the strap. Moving slowly, I reeled the pack toward me and hugged it into my chest. I even let out a little sigh of relief. The hard part was over.

But then my eye happened across the space between crooked trunks. Amongst the sea of leaves, pale eyes hung in the darkness.

A dry cramp seized my throat. For a moment, the only sound was the harsh thump of blood in my ears. The entire world stopped dead in its tracks.

Without warning, a silhouette burst from the shadows, scurrying forward on all fours like a giant spider. Liz shrieked.

As those eyes came racing toward me, my hand fumbled for the knife, but the creature covered the distance between us in all the time it took to wrestle it from the holster. A tremendous force rammed into my chest, hard. I went flying backward, the blade spun out of my hand, and the pack’s contents got dumped across the forest floor.

The pressure against my diaphragm made breathing borderline impossible. I was pinned down.

Gasping for air, I stared up at pale eyes in the centre of a lopsided, pale skull. Those eyes leaned in, closer and closer. The skin surrounding the right one looked bruised and swollen, as though recently struck a blow.

Regurgitated voices spilled out of a thin slit filled with sharp teeth, and with them came a stench of spoiled meat.

Trapped beneath the painful, squeezing vice grip, my final thoughts were of mom. About how I’d failed to protect my baby sister. Like I always promised I would.

I squeezed my eyes shut and choked out a feeble, “I’m sorry.”

Out of nowhere Liz burst from the tent, screaming. I opened my eyes.

The knife came down in a great, shining arc. A powerful growl rang out, part human part bovine, as the blade plunged into a thin, sinewy neck.

The humanoid whipped toward Liz, allowing me to drag down a few lungful’s of air. Now I could see a torso so thin you could count the individual ribs and vertebrae, along with hideously long arms and legs, each capped by claws with black nails curved into sharp points.

A terrified Liz craned her neck up and up as our attacked extended to its full height. Then, with the flail of a long limb, my sister became airborne. She went crashing into a nearby tree and slid to the ground.

Head upturned, the creature dropped onto all fours and scuttled toward her.

Still gasping for breath, I rolled onto my front. My hand fumbled along the ground for a rock, a stick—anything I could use.

*You would take care of Liz, right?*

What I found instead was the lighter fluid.

*If anything ever happened to me…*

A scream went up. I clenched my jaw, tight. First this beast took my mom, then came back for my sister? I needed to act.

Amped up on rage I grabbed the lighter fluid, found my feet in a heartbeat, and then doused the monster’s spine with flammable liquid. Its top half twisted towards me.

I grabbed the lighter from my pocket, ignited it with a roll across my trouser leg. Now It was *my* turn to lay a trap.

“Come on you son of a bitch.”

The creature spun to face me, my mother’s voice tumbling out of those thin lips, pleading for help. This was how it operated. Prey would be much easier to overpower if it was confused, scared, and helpless.

Blocking out the dread, I held steady until my mother’s murderer crawled away from Liz. Then I hurled the lighter forward.

Flames immediately engulfed the creature’s torso, illuminating the canopy. My hands shot up to shield my eyes from the searing heat, but for a split second I glimpsed legs bent backward at the knee, and skin so thin you could see chords of veins beneath it.

As the blaze cracked and leapt, the creature scurried off into the murk, shrieking and thrashing violently as it collided with every tree in the vicinity, leaving behind a trail of charred leaves.

When the darkness set in once again, I rushed over to Liz who lay in a daze, her chest going up and down in short, quick heaves. I dragged her inside the tent and doubled back for the rucksacks discarded contents.

Although Liz’s skull was wet with blood, her injuries didn’t appear life-threatening. Using the med kit, I patched her up, pulled her towards me, and held her for a long, long time.

For the rest of the night, we listened carefully. If the creature survived our encounter, it left us undisturbed.

We set off at dawn, covered in bruises and cuts and dry, sticky blood. I shouldered much of Liz’s bulk travelling on autopilot, one foot in front of the other. It must have been midday before we reached the end of the forest and saw the sky for what felt like the first time in years.

The cabin at the end of a dirt trail had fence posts on both sides. Two rangers were on duty.

Through a language barrier, we explained the rest of our group had been killed, then they rushed us the nearest hospital. I fought the temptation to smoke in the waiting room while the doctors stitched a cut along Liz’s head.

A huge, six-day search and rescue operation took place, but the authorities found zero signs of the others. Although we explained what happened multiple times, you could tell they dismissed us as dumb, superstitious foreigners. A few local papers labelled us as ignorant tourists who got spooked by their own shadows, possibly while under the influence of illicit substances.

Nancy’s daughter, as it turned out, reached out after hearing her mother had vanished. We passed on the note. To this day I’m not sure what it said, only that we received a heart-breaking ‘thank you’ letter in return.

Back in England, Liz came to live with me. We had countless long, tearful conversations about our mutual grief and guilt, and ultimately agreed the best way to honour mom’s memory was by keeping the family together. I decided to kick the cigarettes, too. After all, Mom’s last words had been a heartfelt plea for me to give them up.

One afternoon, after the sorrow ebbed away, I was in the lounge putting a nicotine patch on my arm when Liz walked in and asked to borrow money to go shopping with her friends. Even I was amazed by how ‘mom-esque’ my voice sounded when I automatically replied, “What, you think I’m made of money?”

I facepalmed hard, upset about how quickly I’d slid into the ‘stern, grumpy parental figure’ role, while Liz [doubled over with laughter…](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)
