My sister Taylor died last night. Drowned. When she was found she was still dripping wet. Bloated, parts of her skin dissolving like wet tissue from her flesh. Looking like she had been submerged for months. Only here in Western Australia, we are currently experiencing the worst drought of the century.

The going theory was she drowned in the tailings dam. But no toxins were found in her body and didn’t explain how her body was found seven kilometres outside of town on some abandoned farmland. Laying amongst the ashy remains of what was once a cotton farm. Not that I didn’t want to believe it was her, It was. She still had the scar from childhood of when I bit her after ripping my Pokemon cards. But only last night, I saw her. She came to my work asking for help. I may not know how, but I know why, and most importantly that she was not the first or the last. 

I was working late at the veterinary practice. Lucy, Farmer Pete’s sheepdog and local celebrity had just been euthanised after a long battle with crippling arthritis. Needless to say, the town was devastated. But, not more so than Pete himself. The poor guy didn’t have anyone else. He stayed a few hours after closing to grieve. I offered him some Jack Daniels I had hidden behind the heart worm medication. For those rough days, and between Lucy and a stray I was failing to nurse back to health. Today was definitely one of those days.

We talked for hours, all the big questions. Why are we here? Why do we suffer? And of course, what’s waiting for us after? I mostly listened. I’d known Pete since I was a boy and he was a passionate catholic but now, he had his doubts. Questioning his own faith. Frankly, I didn’t know what I believed either. I wanted to believe that there was something after, some paradise waiting past all our struggles. But in reality, I think we just return to the earth as nothing. But That wasn’t what Pete wanted to hear. It wasn’t what he needed to hear. So I gave my scripted spiel about the rainbow bridge and how, when it’s his time, they’ll be reunited. 

“And those, who don’t have anyone?” Pete asked.

“What do you mean?”

“I mean all those poor animals that don’t have anyone who looked after them? The cattle we send off for slaughter? Do they get a heaven? Do they wait for anyone?”

“I’m sure they have some passionate soul welcoming them.” 

“That’s nice. You were always a good kid Eddy. I knew they were all lies.”

“Thanks Pete, but we really don’t…”

“No I mean, everyone gave you the stink eye when you became a vet. No one wanted you looking after their animals. But I knew you didn’t hurt them kittens. Do you think? Do you think they’re waiting too?”

Before I could answer, I heard the shattering of glass from reception. Ending our conversation, I went to investigate. Opening the door half an inch I could see someone hooded crawling through a shattered window. “Have the cops on standby,” I said to Pete leaving the room. 

I flicked the lights on.

“What the hell are you doing!?”

The hooded woman looked up. It was Taylor. 

“Oh Christ Tay, what the fuck are you doing?” I asked.

“I’ll pay for it I swear. I just needed somewhere safe to hide.”

“So you finally left that prick?”

“It’s not him, there’s someone after us.”

“Wow, who would’ve guessed stealing people’s dogs would make some people pissed. Yeah, I know what you both do, cuz they all end up here… Us?” I asked knowing that her boyfriend Jack was most likely in the room as well.

I looked towards the reception desk. The only place someone built like a brick shithouse could hide. 

“Jack, come on out,” I said.

Jack slowly rose above the desk. Double my height, he’s usually ready to intimidate me with his stature. But now, he was hunched over, making himself look as small as possible, looking like a frightened puppy who’d just heard his first clap of thunder. “Just let us stay here tonight, we won’t touch anything and we’ll be gone as soon as the sun’s up.” 

“Really?” I asked as I reached into his jacket pocket to find Jack had already helped himself to some tablets. 

“These are worming tablets jackass. Both of you, out now or I’m calling the police.” I continued.

Pete, interrupted, “Ladies, quit ya whinging and come give me a bloody hand.” 

All of our attention shifted to Pete trying to cover the broken window with an operating sheet. Just outside was a barreling wave of blood red dust about to descend onto us. 

“You got any tape Ed?” Pete asked.

I ran to the supply closet to grab some duct tape that had been collecting dust for years. I passed the tape to Pete. Moving faster than a man his age should be able, Pete taped the sheet to the window. Then looked at me, then a passing glance at Taylor and Jack. “Funny.”

“What?” I asked.

“That dust storm came on us in seconds from the south right?”

“Yeah, so?” Jack Interrupted.

“So, with winds that strong this shouldn’t be holding.”

The sheet was still. Like there was no wind at all. But from what we could see, dust was violently blowing against the building. 

Pete walked back to my office where we had our earlier therapeutic conversation. He walked back with the bottle of Jack Daniels and a couple of paper cups. “Well, we’re not going anywhere anytime soon. So just for tonight, we’re gonna play nicely. Is that alright with you kids?”  

Pete passed a cup to Jack who avoided all eye contact. “Yeah, we can do that.” Pete passed a cup to Taylor and she thanked him under her breath and finally to me, but I refused. I couldn’t afford to even be a little tipsy around Jack. I couldn’t hold my liquor, he could. He was also a very violent and unpredictable drunk. 

We heard the sound of equipment dropping from the back room where we hold the animals.

“Who else is here?” I asked Taylor.

“Just us I swear” Jack answered.

My scepticism was immediately deafened by a horrific symphony of screaming cats coming from that room. 

“What’s wrong with them” asked Taylor. 

Pete, softly putting his rough work worn hand on my shoulder said “I think you should go check on them cats mate.”

“We don’t have any cats,” I replied.

The screams stopped. Silence. An unnatural silence. No wind, no crickets and no white noise. I had to click my fingers just to make sure I wasn’t going deaf. 

The silence was finally broken by distant gentle knocking. There was someone knocking on the back door of the practice. 

“Fuck it’s found us.” Jack shrieked.

“It? I knew you two were high. Even if there is something after you, I don’t think they’d be gently knocking. And if it is I’ll say I haven’t seen you. I don’t need to deal with this tonight. Pete can you…”

“Go for it Ed, I’ve got it sorted here.”

The practice was originally a large family house of a mining magnate in the 70s. The exterior had barely been updated but the interior was like a labyrinth of newly renovated rooms, showing no clues of its previous life. It took a minute to reach the back door. I grabbed the children’s sized cricket bat I kept in the supply closet, also known as the clinic’s Lost and Found. Could’t risk it actually being someone Tay and Jack pissed off. 

“Who’s there?” I asked through the door.

“Can you please help me? I’m lost.” Called a voice from behind the door. A voice of a young girl. What was a young girl doing out this late and this far out of town?

“What are you doing out here kid, especially at this time of night?” I asked as I unlocked the door.

“I was riding back home from my friend Mia’s house but the chain on my bike broke. I got caught in the dust and got lost. I just saw the lights on and hoped someone was here.”

I opened the door a crack. It was a kid. No older than 12. Bike chain in hand and still in her school uniform.

“Alright, just leave your bike there and quickly come in. We’ll call your folks.”

I quickly opened the door and let her in.

I escorted her to the main reception where Pete had Taylor caught in one of his minute long stores he could somehow stretch into a full hour. Jack was attempting to sleep in the corner on a pile of dog beds. 

“Sorry kid, I didn’t grab your name.”

“Abbie, Abbie Fry. My mum’s name is Ruby. Same last name”

“Ok Abbie, I’m Ned and that’s Pete. Did you ever meet Lucy?”

“Yeah, she was the puppy that was always in the little wagon. That’s the guy who used to take her around town.”

“Well she was a little older than a puppy, but yeah. Pete was the one who’d take her around town. You want to go say hi and I’ll call your folks?”

She wandered over to Pete breaking his intense concentration on the story he was boring Taylor with. 

“Well hello there kiddo. Did you get caught up in this nasty storm too?” Pete said patting the seat next to him for her to sit down. 

“Yeah, my bike broke.”

“That’s no good, but I should be able to fix that up for you. A young lady shouldn’t be out by herself at this time of night alone.”

“Hey, that’s a Damascus uniform right?” Taylor asked Abbie.

“Yeah, It’s my first year of high school.”

“I used to wear the exact same uniform. But I thought they updated it the year I left. I didn’t think they still wore the green.”

“Would you shut up, I’m trying to sleep!” Jack shouted from the corner of the room.

“They must’ve gone back to the old uniform,” Abbie whispered. 

I called the number Abbie had given me and after what felt like an eternity of ringing, it finally went through.

“Hello?” A distant voice said from the other end. She must have me on speaker.

“Hello, this is Ned Henderson. I’m the local vet. Is this Ruby fry?”

“Yes, but we don’t have any pets.”

“No no no, the reason I’m calling is your daughter Abbie is here. She just got lost in the storm. Would you be able to pick her up if possible?”

The voice got closer and cleaner. 

“Is she alive?”

“Is she alive? Of course. She’s right here.”

“Are you going to kill her?”

“I’m sorry!?”

Ruby now sounding like she was standing directly beside me.“Are you going to kill her Eddy?! Drown her like the kitties?” 

In a knee-jerk reaction, I threw my phone to the ground. Only it didn’t break into pieces. It splattered to the ground. Blood, gore and fur leaked and twitched from the phone. 

Peter called to me, “What’s wrong mate?”

I looked at him, then back at the ground where my phone now lay in non-organic pieces. 

“I can’t get through to your folks, sorry kid. I’ll try again soon. I think I just need some water.”

I thought there must’ve been a gas leak. But I couldn’t smell anything. I just knew I had to get out of here and soon.

“Look!” Jack shouted, suddenly fully awake looking out the window.

We all looked out to see a row of ten people lined up in front of the clinic wearing crude paper mache animal masks. They looked like a cult, only they wore casual and work clothes.  Even with the masks, It didn’t feel like they were hiding their identity. 

I sat down near Taylor and whispered. “Are these the people who were chasing you?” 

She hesitated. “It wasn’t a person.”

One bald man wearing a disturbing cat mask walked into the warm glow of the closet street light, then spoke. “Taylor Henderson and Jack Wright. We’ve here to help you both.
Pete walked to the broken window and ripped the operating sheet off. He examined the dust as it didn’t appear to enter the building, hitting some invisible barrier. He then shouted to the masked men. “Sean! What the hell are you lot doing in the dust? Get in here you silly bastard.”

Taylor pulled him away from the window. “What the hell are you doing? Don’t ask a bunch of creepy men wearing masks to come in.”

“There’s only one bald person in town and that’s Sean Cooper, he’s a good mate of mine. He used to be the local Senior Sergeant.” 

Sean took off his mask. “Thanks for the invite Pete but I’m afraid we can’t. I’m very sorry you had to be here tonight. But I promise we’re here to help Jack and Taylor. We really need you both to step out.”

Jack shouted, “Do you know how to kill it!?”

“Yes. But first, we need you both to step out.”

“You know what I think? I think you’re full of shit. Creepy cult of latter day shitheads. No one in their right mind would willing help us. Especially a cop.”

He may be an insufferable prick, but Jack was right. I looked over to Abbie. She looked about as confused and scared as I felt. “Hey Abbie, there’s a landline behind the desk. It should still work. I need you to call the police. Can you do that for me kid?” She nodded and ran to the desk. 

I then shouted from the window. “Why are you really here.”

“Is that Edward Henderson? Sorry, you prefer Ned now don’t you? Well, I might’ve stretched the truth, but we truly are here to help. I don’t need to tell you what your sister has been up to lately. Terrible things Ned.”

Another of the masked figures walked into the light. She removed her dog mask.“Ned, dearest. It’s Pam. You saw my beautiful dog Benson? The Rottweiler scared of cats? You used to put the TV right next to him during visits so he felt more at home.”

The sight of Pamela convinced me to unlock and open the door of the clinic. There was absolutely no way this woman could possibly harm anyone. She’d regularly donate food and beds to us. 

“What are you doing?!” Taylor aggressively whispered.

I brushed her off and stepped outside.

“Hi Ned. How are you dear? I know this seems like a very peculiar night."

“Pam, how’s Benson?”

Sean cut in, “That’s actually why we are here son. Taylor has done terrible things. But we’re trying to help her, I promise.”

“Help her how? They both seem to think something’s after them.”

Pamela’s eyes began to water at the thought of Benson. “There is Ned and it’s here. While they’re with you, you’re all not safe.”

“What’s here?”

Sean cut in. “Atropos. She’s here, she’s angry and she will get them. But if they both come out willingly, to embracing their sins, their suffering will be lessened.”

“What you’re planning on killing them?!”

“No no, they’ve been marked.” Both Sean and Pam pulled out a constructed clay idle of some kind of bird. Both marked with blood. 

Pamela continued. “And while you are with them, we can’t guarantee your safety.”

I gestured to the clinic, “There’s a young girl with us, she’s lost. Are you saying she’s in danger too?”

Pamela turned her back, avoiding the question. She hurried away as the remaining members of the group disappeared into he dust with her.

“Yes. Atropos is nothing more than a hungry animal. While you all are with them, the scent of sin will mark you all. You need them to come out willingly knowing their fate.” Sean continued putting his hands on my shoulders to refocus me. “I’m sorry Ned. Taylor will die tonight. If they come out willingly it’ll be painless and quick. If not, they’ll experience not a singular death but many. And you, Pete and that young girl may be caught in the crossfire. Here, I only have the one.” Sean passes me another small bird idle. “This one is unmarked. It’ll keep whoever has it safe. Good luck. We’ll be praying for you.”

As Sean walked away into the sea of dust I then realised all of them were prominent members of our local church group. All of which had Pets I had treated.

I walked back inside.

Jack grabbed my shirt. “What did they say?”

“Where’s Abbie?” I asked.

“Pete took her to see that dog out back.” Taylor replied. “But what did he say?”

“I’ll tell you in a second.” 

I’m the corner of my office was Pete and Abbie patting the stray I had on a drip. 

“Sorry mate, the little one couldn’t get onto the police or her Ma. Thought she needed a distraction.  Hope that’s alright?  I think she’d make a good little vet don’t you.”

“Thanks Pete, and that’s no trouble at all. I think our sick little friend likes the company. Hey Abbie, come here a second.”

“Is he going to alright Ned?”

“Pete, nah he lost his mind years ago,” I said jokingly hoping to get a laugh from her.

To my relief she laughed, “No the puppy. He doesn’t look good.”

“Well lucky that’s what we’re here for. Now I need you to do me another favour. See this little bird figurine? I need you to hold on to it for me, just for tonight.”

She reluctantly took it from me. “Okay?…”

“Thanks kid.”

“Oh, does the puppy have a name?”

“I suppose,” I never named any of the animals that looked like they were knocking on death’s door. Saved me getting attached. 

“What’s the dog’s name?” Abbie asked.

“I don’t know. I forgot to ask him.”

“Why don’t you name him?” Pete asked Abbie. 

“Can I?” Abbie excitedly asked me.

I wanted to say no. I didn’t like the dog’s odds and didn’t want this night to be any worse. But for whatever reason I said yes. 

“Leo!” She exclaimed.

“Leo it is. Now I think Leo needs some rest. He’s had a big day.” 

We all walked back into reception where Taylor was trying desperately to keep Jack inside. The door was open and just outside, almost glowing through the red dust was a pristine yellow school bus. 

“I need to go home!?” Jack shouted.

“Guys help me! The bus, it isn’t real!”

“Get the hell off me! I need to see my mum. She’ll be home waiting for me.”

Before Pete and I could help restrain him, he broke from Taylor’s grasp and ran outside. We didn’t dare follow outside.

“You smell that? She’s been baking.” Jack said slowing his pace to the bus. 

“Jack you need to come back inside now!?” Taylor shrieked.

I closed and locked the door. 

Taylor screamed and hit me, “What the hell are you doing?!” 

“Hopefully. Saving your life,” I replied. 

The door to the bus opened and that warm hopeful expression on Jack’s face dropped to fear. Barking. What sounded like hundreds of echoing dogs barking and whimpering in pain came from the bus. 

I didn’t make out what Jack said under his breath but It sounded like “I shouldn’t be here.”

He attempted to run back to the clinic only to be swooped upon by some winged creature. It grabbed him with it’s large talons and, in a faction of an instant, flew him straight up above us, out of sight. Jack’s screams faded into the distance. 

The silence was deafening and the bus dissolved in the dust. The quiet was finally broken by Jack’s body violently landing on my car. He hit it with such velocity that parts of him and my car exploded in every direction. Sitting above his dripping remains, sitting on the clinic’s dated and faded billboard was what had soared him to unimaginable heights. It’s wings draped over most of the sign as it stared directly at us.  Stared directly at Taylor.
