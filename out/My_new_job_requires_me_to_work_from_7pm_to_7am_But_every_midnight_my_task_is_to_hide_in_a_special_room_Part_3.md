On Thursday, September 21st 2023, following my supervisor's instructions, I went to work at 5 pm, ensuring that I was early enough to maximize the time frame of our meeting. Unfortunately, he only freed himself at 6 pm, and he told me right from the beginning that we only had 20 minutes. Our conversation looked like this:  
  
"What is your problem Kol? Like seriously? Aren't you happy to have a job and sustain your family?" He asked.  
  
"At the expense of my sanity? My life?"  
  
"Aren't you man enough to handle this job? Do you think everyone out there have it easy? Or that there's only you that go through pressure?"  
  
"Sir, this thing trying to get me, what's this thing? What's that midnight thing all about?" I desperately asked, only to be slapped with the reply I least expected.  
  
"I don't know." My supervisor replied.  
  
"What?"  
  
"I'm sorry, even I, your supervisor yes, even I, I don't know. Maybe you should ask the CEO, that is if you can get in touch with her. I'm not sure she replies to mails though. But do you think it's all those people out there that will give you the answer?"  
  
"What? What people?"  
  
"You think I didn't see your posts online?" He asked, baffling me. "Yeah right, look at me with your big eyes now. I saw them. Do you think those people will give you answers? So it's a trend now, right? The moment an employee is unhappy, the whole situation ends up on a sub?" He questioned.  
  
"I'm really sorry Sir, I just wanted to—"  
  
"Cut the crap! There's no policy in our institution that forbids such behavior. You can even continue if that can help you cope, as long as you don't name the company or anyone involved in the business, even if it's a dog. Alright? And also, don't cheat like last time. After midnight, everything is back to normal, whatever it means to you, and you're expected to be patrolling, not chilling the whole night in the black room. Okay?"  
  
"Understood Sir."  
  
"I always told you to just follow the rules. You're all safe in that room, what's hard with that?"  
  
"Sir, it's insane! I mean— this ain't normal, and also, what happened to the previous guy?" I asked.  
  
"You're looking at him. Look, this is really like a training process for you like I told you. This whole first month. But if you think you can't handle this job, you might consider leaving." He said, as he stood up to leave himself. "And you know, if you can't handle pressure, then there's no job for you anywhere in the world. There are good and bad days at work. That's just the truth. Don't be thinking that remote workers, or Influencers have it easy. Nobody does. Especially in this company. Look around, look more closely. We all have our rules to follow, even myself. One of them is not to be here at 6:30 pm. At this time, only you should be here." He added and walked away.  
  
"Thank you very much Sir." I simply replied.  
  
"Oh, and word of advice for a stubborn type like you. If you find yourself trapped, just make sure to have your full uniform on, close your eyes and don't make a single move or sound." He revealed.  
  
"Or else?" I inquired before he reached the door.  
  
He simply lifted his shirt to reveal the most disturbing scar I have ever seen on someone's belly. The stitches made it so worse that it looked like the closed mouth of a crocodile.  
  
"Just be like drivers. If they don't follow the rules, they cause accidents, they die and even kill as well in the process. Kol, follow the rules. I'll give you a call tonight, you might need other tips." He said with a smile, then left.  
  
The shift on Thursday completely went almost uneventful. At midnight, I was in the black room just waiting for the entity to display the new tricks it had in store for me. It appeared at the entrance at 12:00 am as usual, but just remained there. It did not roam around and only stood there, affecting the camera at the entrance of the building. Since it was far, I could even use my phone and the radio as it could not affect it from that distance, and my wife called me.  
  
Our little boy of five years old was having difficulties to sleep, so my wife figured that he wanted me to sing our own composed lullaby, something I usually do for my kids. Afterwards, we talked a little bit but my wife insisted on my job, telling me that she knew that attitude and asked if I wanted to quit. She knows me well, and I used to quit my previous jobs as soon as I was fed up without thinking of the consequences. We almost argued about it because she thinks that I am on the verge of doing it and letting my family down, again. After almost an hour of reassuring her, we concluded the call on a more positive note. It was 01:08 am by that time and of course, the entity had completed its shift. Therefore, it was time to resume mine.  
  
However, I could not have braced myself for what awaited on Friday. Everything once again started peacefully until midnight. At 12:00 am, unlike the day before, the entity was nowhere to be seen, not a distortion on a single camera. The coast looked clear. Thirty minutes later, I wanted to check my phone and I realized that I had forgotten it in the restroom right next to the black room. Whatever my supervisor had to say, I wanted to hear it since I am sure he knows more than he is willing to tell, so I could not miss that call. Like my supervisor said, there are good and bad days at work, therefore, if the entity chose to take a day off, I might be at peace for once. I decided to take the risk of retrieving my phone.  
  
Armed with my machete, I slowly opened the door and my jaw dropped at the scenery I discovered. Instead of the corridor, I saw the windowless living room of a really old house. An old wooden house surely decorated by an old lady from the 50's. A few meters away, carefully placed on a small wooden table, my phone emitted a bizarre static sound, before I could hear my voice from it, performing the same lullaby I sing for my children, to my absolute bewilderment.  
  
I then slowly looked at the monitors and am really grateful for doing so, as I saw them rapidly distorting one after the other because the entity was speeding towards the black room at a velocity I did not know it had. I slammed the door shut and locked it. Not even ten seconds later, I heard it approaching and growling, and it soon began to pound on the door. The worst was not that thing trying to force the door open, it was its growls, switching from that of a beast, to that of a woman, to that of a kid, to that of a man, and other things I can not even describe. I ended up curled on the floor, my hands covering my ears because its rage screams were deafening. At 01:00 am, everything abruptly stopped. I do not know if I missed my supervisor's call but ultimately, we did not get to talk.  
  
After my shift, I returned home ready to ignore my wife and quit. I also thought that I could at least get some rest and free my mind from what I just went through, I was wrong. My son was the first to welcome me as soon as I stepped in. My wife could only tell me that the excitement came from a dream that he had last night. When I asked him about it, he explained the dream in details, telling us that the whole family was on a deserted island, dressed like pirates, something he really likes to do. A 'voice' then told him that fruits, water and a treasure were hidden somewhere, and that the only condition for the family to access those good things was for me to just get out of the black room.
