My heart was already pounding. It was 9 AM, and I couldn’t decide what needed to be done. What if I had been hacked? What if it was Lana? She was a social-media buff; it could’ve been her. She might have asked one of her friends to hack into my account and mess with me. Just a harmless but idiotic prank.

I messaged her right away. I didn’t have much time left to slowly influence her into revealing the truth, so I confronted her.

“Hey… Lana, you need to stop doing this, okay?”
Her reply came instantly...

“What? What are you talking about?!”

“Hey… look, I know you guys are playing a prank on me. Please stop. It’s too much now,” I replied.

“You’re crazy. What prank? What are you even talking about?”

Her responses sounded genuine. I didn’t know if I should continue, because her denial would mean it was someone else, and that would be concerning.
I didn’t reply to her at all.
It was already around 9 PM, and I had to leave for the gym.

My gym routine involved an hour of cardio and some time with the dumbbells.
I had purposely chosen a gym that had fewer people coming in, and even then, my time slot was 9 PM onwards. By then, almost everyone leaves.
There were only two of us at first, the owner, who was partly asleep, and me.
But wait… three.
I saw another guy.

The guy wasn’t up to anything. He just stood there like he had no idea what needed to be done. I couldn’t see his face because of the glass that separated us. He looked quite well-built, though, and that made me believe he probably didn’t even need to work out.

Then I heard camera click sounds. The guy was probably taking selfies. I looked through the glass; his flash pierced it several times.
A while later, when I was doing cardio, I got to see his face.

He looked slightly familiar, but horrifying. Quite otherworldly.
What intrigued me was the fact that I was looking directly at him, but he behaved as if I wasn’t even there. Perhaps he didn’t like being gazed upon.
Then he turned around, stretched his arm upright, and started taking selfies.

I wasn’t in the mood to go home at all. I was worried for my safety; the thought of finding someone inside my house was concerning. But I had nowhere else to go either. I couldn’t avoid going to my own home.
I left the gym by 10:30. The other guy had already left.

At home, I was terrified, concerned about what was going to unfold. Yet, I still logged into the Thamior account to see if I could get some clue, if Lana had finally agreed or was giving hints that it was her all along, playing the prank.
Right after logging in, I opened the messages section.
Lana had blocked Thamior.

I didn’t expect that from her. She could’ve just refused to reply at all.
Then I accidentally clicked on my own profile, and it sent multiple chills down my spine.
Thamior’s profile picture had been changed.

And in the picture, it was him at the gym.
I was right behind him on the treadmill, photobombing his photo.

I didn’t know what to do next.
Now I didn’t need any answers from anyone. I was sure that Lana hadn’t done it, and my account wasn’t hacked either.
How did the guy look exactly like the one I had created?

Yet still, I was certain, if Thamior had invited Sophia to my place, then he would definitely come.
I locked every single door, window, and any kind of opening that could let someone in.
It was 10:54.

They were going to arrive within six minutes.
Six minutes later, I didn’t hear anything. No noise. No doorbell. Just nothing.
I kept waiting.
An hour went by.

I was kind of happy. I let out a mild laugh, because I was almost sure it was turning out to be a mere prank.

But before anything else, I opened the laptop to check for recent activity.

There was a message from Sophia:

“Can’t come tonight. I’ll let you know if I get the time tomorrow.”
There was no reply this time.

“And that means Lana had been playing a prank all along. When I confronted her, she chose to block me. She’d hacked my account. Silly me,” I laughed, saying this to myself.

Then I entered the bathroom to take a shower. I had forgotten to take one after coming back from the gym.
After five minutes of refreshing and relieving shower time, I came out.
I sat on the sofa and opened the laptop to watch some Netflix.
But then the open tab in the browser caught my eye.

The [REDACTED] site was still open.
Sophia had been replied to, just two minutes ago.

The reply read:

“Had a tough workout session at the gym today. See you soon, honey. I’ll pick you up. Now I’m gonna go enjoy my coffee.”

My body froze.

I had just come out of the shower. There was no way someone could’ve replied to her on my behalf. The doors were locked too.

Then I heard the clink of a mug against the counter coming from the kitchen.
