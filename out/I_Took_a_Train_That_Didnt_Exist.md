I’m not asking anyone to believe me. I just need to tell this somewhere — because lately, I’m not sure what’s real anymore.
If you ever see a silver train at a platform where no train should be… don’t get on it.


It started on an ordinary Thursday night. I worked late. I was tired. I went down to the station I use every day. Only… the lights looked dimmer. The tunnel leading there felt a little too long. The silence felt too heavy.

When I reached the platform, it was completely empty.
No passengers. No sound. Just… a silver train. Already waiting.
It wasn’t on the schedule. I checked the board. Nothing listed. And yet there it stood, quiet, old, and covered in a faint layer of dust, like it had been pulled out from another era.
No logos. No numbers. No lights on inside.
Just… there.

The door opened with a long, quiet hiss.

I should have walked away. But there was something… compelling. Like something behind my eyes whispered, "This is your way out."

And I stepped in.
Inside, the lights were dim amber. The air felt still and stale. The seats were a strange red velvet, worn and torn in places. It smelled like old books and wet wood.
The passengers — if you could call them that — didn’t look at me.
They didn’t move.
They were dressed… wrong.
One man wore a bowler hat and a brown tweed suit that looked straight out of the 1920s. A girl sat across from me, maybe eight years old, holding a doll with no face. Her eyes never blinked. Not once.
And then, at the far end of the car, I saw him.
A tall man in a black suit and a wide-brimmed hat. His face was pale. Thin.
But his eyes… they shined like glass in the dark.
He was looking straight at me.

I looked away.
I pulled out my phone.
No signal.
Battery: 47%.
The clock was stuck on 11:17 PM.
I glanced around. Every passenger was still frozen in place — but now they all seemed… slightly turned. Like their bodies had shifted half an inch closer to me.
I whispered, “Where is this train going?”
No one answered.
But then the man in the black hat spoke — voice like gravel under ice:

> "It never mattered where.
Only when."



The train shuddered.

The lights flickered hard. The windows turned pitch black like the outside world had vanished. And then — slowly — the train stopped.

The door slid open.

A gust of cold air hit me like a wave of dead breath.
I stepped out.

The platform was ancient. The sign above was cracked and rusted:

> "ECLIPSE STATION — TIME UNKNOWN"
The world outside looked… off.

Buildings were crooked and melted slightly at the edges. The sky was a strange shade of violet, like twilight stretched too far. There were no cars. No people. No wind. Not even noise.

I walked.

There were clocks on every wall I passed. None of them moved.

A newspaper sat on a bench. The front page headline read:

> "Local Man Returns Claiming He's from the Future — Dies Screaming 'It Followed Me Back.'"



And below that:
Date: October 19, 1902.
I backed away.
That’s when I saw him again.
The man in the black hat. Standing at the end of the street.
Smiling.
He raised one hand and pointed… not at me… but at behind me.
I turned.
There was the train. Waiting. Doors open.
I ran back inside.


This time the cart was empty — except for him.

He sat in the middle now.
In front of him, on the seat, lay a small, folded piece of paper.
He slid it toward me.
I opened it. It said:
"You rode the train.
That means it rode you.
Something came back with you."
And in the corner of the paper… a clock drawn in black ink.
All the numbers were gone.
Only 11:17 remained.


I blinked.
I was back on the regular platform. My train was arriving. People were around me. Talking. Laughing. Normal.

I checked my phone.
Battery: 47%.
Time: 11:17 PM.

Exactly the same.

But something’s wrong.


That was two weeks ago.

Since then, mirrors in my house don’t show me blinking right.
My reflection sometimes lags half a second behind.

I hear footsteps at night.
Always stopping at exactly 11:17.

And in the reflection of my TV — turned off, pitch black — I sometimes see a man in a black hat… standing in the hallway behind me. Watching.

Last night, I checked my phone again.
The photos folder had one new picture.

I didn’t take it.
It showed me.
Standing on the Eclipse Station platform.

And behind me, far off but perfectly clear,
he’s there.
Smiling.



I took a train that didn’t exist.
Now something that shouldn't exist is in my world.

And I think…
it’s just waiting for the right time.



If you ever see a train that isn’t on the map,
not on the schedule,
with no driver…
don’t get on it.

Because once it rides you…
you don’t get off alone.
