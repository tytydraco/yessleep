Some of you may have told someone in your life that you’ve met either your soulmate, your best friend, or your business partner in the weirdest way possible. Prior to the meeting, you’d never have guessed that you’d encounter them in such a strange way, let alone imagine they’d end up staying in your life for so long—if not forever.

I have a story that’s much, much weirder than any of yours.

This is how I met my twin brother.

“Met?” you might be asking. “You’re a twin. You don’t just meet each other like a friend or a spouse. You grew up together, starting from the womb,” or so many people have told me—more times than I can count.

Well then, my friends, read my story closely. And slowly. If necessary.

Keep in mind that the story may feel really weird and absurd at the beginning, but it will make sense by the end. And you’ll love it. I hate it, to be honest, but I’m quite sure you guys will love it. I promise. So, bear with me.

This story happened 57 years ago.

I didn’t remember how I got there—racing down an empty road in a stolen floating car, running from a group of people.

Strangely, I didn’t even remember how I ended up being chased. The people pursuing me looked like military personnel, police, or something of the sort. I turned my head to look at the man driving the car I was in. I didn’t remember who he was. All I knew was that I’d been running from those people with him.

There wasn’t anything particularly special about his appearance.

The only thing that stood out was his birthmark: three black moles, lined up under his left eye.

“I don’t understand,” I said to him as he gripped the wheel. “The more time I spend running, the more I lose my memory of what I’ve been through here.”

“Same here,” he replied. “This city is strange. I can’t tell why or how. I don’t even remember why I’m running from them. But from experience, a group of people chasing me never means anything good. So I guess running is the best option for now,” he explained.

“I don’t remember who you are either, or how we ended up running from them together. No offense,” he added as he sped the car faster.

I didn’t respond.

I looked around. How did I end up here? The city looked futuristic, with no moon or stars in sight. It was as though it was perpetually nighttime, lit by the glow of high-rise buildings and dazzling city lights. Beautiful on one side, but hollow and lonely, too.

I glanced back and saw the group chasing us drawing closer.

“Stop them! Don’t let them reach the portal!” shouted one man who seemed to be their leader.

“Portal?” I muttered, turning my head forward. Ahead of us was a massive, skyscraper-tall, circular structure. Its center glowed with a blue, watery surface. The portal.

“Dude, there’s a dead end!” I shouted in panic.

“No, there’s a portal,” the man driving replied. “There’s hope.”

“What? But we don’t know where the portal leads!” I warned him.

“Maybe. But I can predict where staying here leads, and I’m not going there,” he said, accelerating further.

Amid the fear and panic, I scanned the city. Other portals stood scattered among the buildings, but the one ahead was directly at the end of our road.

“Don’t pass through the portal!” the leader of our pursuers yelled from behind.

My companion and I exchanged a glance. Did we have any other choice?

“You don’t understand!” the leader screamed. “It’s not your time yet! You haven’t undergone the procedure! You’ll remember everything!”

“What was so terrible about ‘remembering everything’?” I thought.

"That portal in front of you is the final gate to reincarnation. Throughout the history of humankind, there have been countless times when two strangers—never knowing each other in their previous lives—jumped through that portal together, yes. But they all did so under strict procedure. None of them were still in a condition where the memories of their previous lives remained intact," we heard the man preaching the weirdest sermon we had ever encountered in our lives.

But I keep racing, along in the same floating car with the man beside me, whom I, once again, didn’t remember ever seeing before.

“No! Don’t! Don’t pass through the portal together!” His voice was much louder now, genuinely filled with urgency and fear.

We hesitated. But we didn’t have much time to debate. We sped forward and plunged through the portal.

Crossing it felt like passing through a wall of water.

Then, everything turned white.

When I regained my sight, I found myself staring at a ceiling. I was in a room.

As my vision sharpened, I saw the face of a man leaning over me. He looked massive—like a giant—and wore a surgical mask, his eyes filled with shock and concern.

I tried to raise my hand but froze in horror. My hand was tiny and fragile, like a baby’s.

Before I could process what was happening, the man spoke. “Ma’am, it turns out your baby is a conjoined twin. We need to take them to the observation room immediately.” He handed me over to a woman in a nurse’s uniform.

Wait. What did he just say?

A baby?

‘It turns out’?

Conjoined twins?

Panic surged through me as I turned my head. And there it was—another head, attached to the same body as mine.

The face on the other head stared back at me, its eyes wide with the same horror I felt. Then, I saw it.

Three black moles, lined up under his left eye.
