Something’s wrong. I hardly remember my dreams anymore and when I do, it’s just static. I’m not sure when or how it started. But one day, the quiet night stopped feeling so innocuous, and the walk to work became haunted by an undercurrent of dread. Every few minutes, I'd throw a look behind me into the dark between lonely streetlights. I got to work safe and sound, but I still couldn’t shake the feeling that something had been following me, watching.

I should back it up: I work at a 24-hour gas station/liquor store in a semi-rural town, surrounded by dense redwood forest on one side and a long and lonely highway on the other. We don’t get too many people passing through here late at night besides locals, so it gets boring fast.

The first sign of trouble began with the trio of customers that waltzed in a few nights ago. I don’t remember what they did or even what they looked like. One moment, I was looking up at the sound of the storebell and saw them enter. And the next, I was watching them leave. The automatic doors shut as the tail end of the bell died down. There was a strange taste in the back of my throat, and my head was spinning. Every time I tried to remember what had just happened, I blanked.

I would have written it off as being tired; it was 2 am, but a storm was now raging outside, and the floor was bone dry. Even if they had umbrellas, surely they’d drip at least a little. Maybe they had covers, but even then, their shoes would still be wet.  They’d leave something behind. Between the three of them, at least one would slack in drying his feet off at the doormat. I know it’s a strange thing to fixate on, but if I could just remember what happened, it would be fine.

Staring at the cameras, I knew how I’d find peace. The front desk has a monitor with a live feed of all CCTVs, I rewound to a few minutes earlier and paused at the moment the trio came into frame. They were mid-motion, and so all I saw were three black blurs. Just looking at them made me feel uneasy. I hovered over the play button, knowing all it would take was one push to dispel the uncertainty. But the brain fog crept in, and the compulsion to just look away was growing stronger by the second.

I had just worked up the nerve to watch the footage when the doorbell brought my gaze up. My breath caught in my throat, my chest seized, and my stomach flipped. Sara stood there at the threshold, smiling. Sara whom I admired and yearned after for years now. Sara, who had fallen off the face of the earth 4 months earlier, and I was certain I’d never see again. Something within me reignited, and for a moment, I forgot my fear.

“It’s been a while, hasn't it?” she said.

“Yeah, I thought you moved away. What brings you back?”

“I was on a vacation of sorts, but I’m back now, back to my favorite gas station with my favorite attendant. Need a nicotine fix, Marlboro reds.” She said with a sly smile.

We spent the next half hour catching up, all while she palmed her cigarettes. My knees felt weak every time she looked into my eyes. By the time she said she had to step out, I had forgotten the three men and the footage.

“I’m gonna go smoke and chill for a bit, but I’m not up to anything tonight. I’ll stop by again to hang, do you mind?” she asked.

“Not at all!” I said over excitedly.

She flashed that grin of hers one last time, said, “I’ll be seeing you soon,” and left. I was over the moon; it felt like she was more attentive than usual, almost flirty. I pulled out my phone and sent a text to my best friend, letting him know that Sara was back and that I thought she was into me. I was smiling so hard my face hurt, but that shattered the instant I saw the monitor and the blurry figures on it. I hovered over the play button, wondering if it was even worth finding out. It seemed so trivial now with Sara back.

I clicked play on a whim, now that it didn’t matter, why not? The video played for a few frames before I was forced to pause it again as my phone buzzed with a text alert. It was from my best friend, I quickly read it and was confused.

“Is everything alright man? Do you need help, are you safe?”

“Yeah, just at work. Why? What’s up?”

The three dots indicating that he was typing appeared and disappeared half a dozen times for a few minutes. But still, nothing was sent, I got the impression that he was erasing his messages, looking for better phrasing. Bored, I looked up at the monitor, and the confusion only deepened. The three men were in the store now, standing directly in the view of the camera, silhouettes no longer blurred. But their faces were scrambled. Not deformed, no, it was like someone had taken a blender tool and smudged their features until they were nothing but unidentifiable messes.

My phone pinged with a message, but I ignored it as I used the left arrow key to rewind a few seconds before they entered and hit play at the same moment my phone pinged again. I watched in bewilderment as they trudged in. Their forms were normal, but their faces were obscured by TV static, shifting and crackling as they walked toward me. I hit pause as yet another message alert sounded out. The faces stopped being static and returned to that smudged state as ice flooded my veins.

I stared intensely at the screen, scrutinized my face, and saw that it showed no fear. I looked almost bored by the mundanity. I hit play and turned up the volume so I could hear what was being said. I flinched at the earsplitting static whine that blared from the speakers and muted it on instinct. My head throbbed in its aftermath, but still, I watched. I didn’t speak, only held out my hand as they handed me something, something I threw into my open mouth and swallowed. Horror was all I felt as I watched them walk out, leaving me at the register with no recollection of what they had just done.  My phone pinged one last time, and I finally looked at it in exasperation, it was from my friend, and it read:

“Hey man, I don't know how to break it to you. Don’t be mad at me ok? I only meant well, I didn’t want you to get hurt, I know how much you liked this girl. Sara left for Canada a few months ago for vacation. She died during a freak camping accident. She’s been dead for 3 months now. The only reason I know is through my mom. I’m sorry man. I don’t know who you think you saw at work today, but I can assure you it’s not Sara.”

Lightning flashed outside as my heart thundered. I put my phone down, closed out of the feed, and sat down to try to think. I had been drugged, that much was certain, but what effects was the drug having? Had I hallucinated my entire interaction with Sara? Did this drug strike in waves, and only now was I lucid again?

I shot a message back to my friend asking him to come, that I needed to see him in person, and ran back to the monitor. I pulled up the security feed again, rewound, and watched the trio enter and leave half a dozen times. Not once did the visual distortions hiding their faces fade. Knowing that it wasn’t a hallucination didn’t help. I simply clung to another hope that it was a glitch in the recording equipment, even if I knew in the pit of my stomach it wasn’t.

I skipped forward a dozen or so minutes ahead to get what I dreaded. I pressed play and watched as Sara walked in and approached the counter. Her face was veiled by static. I closed out of the player again, picked up my phone, and sent my friend another text. I told him that something was wrong and begged him to call me as soon as possible. If Sara was dead and I hadn’t hallucinated her, had someone been wearing her face?

I spent the next few minutes pacing around, trying to calm down. I kept telling myself that nothing had truly happened. But with every passing minute, the fear of what the drug could do to me grew, and I decided to call the police.

“911. Address and emergency.” Croaked out the dispatcher, her voice was so dry and frayed it almost hurt to listen to.

“I work at the gas station off of Bradshaw, and about an hour ago, three men came in, and they drugged me.”

“They drugged you? How?”

“I mean, I don’t remember it happening, but-“

“You don’t remember being drugged? How can you be certain it even happened then?”

“Because I have it on tape! Security footage I can show to investigators. These three guys walked in and gave me a pill, and I took it, and since then strange shit has been happening.”

“You took a drug willingly from strangers, and now you want us to bail you out?”

“Jesus fucking Christ, why am I the one being interrogated? I don’t know if it was willingly, they could’ve forced me for all I know. The mind-altering effects of what I took, it doesn’t let me remember.”

“I’m sorry, Jared, I misspoke, I just wanted to make sure this wasn’t a false emergency. I’ll be sending an officer shortly.”

“How do you know my name?”

“Please stand by while I dispatch-“

A distorted static scream wailed out of the phone, modulating between pitches it assaulted my ears. I don’t remember blacking out, only coming to at the tail end of a hoarse voice speaking, catching only the fragment of a syllable. The static scream was winding down alongside it, its fading echo still reverberating in the call. I hung up and dropped my phone on the countertop.

I was dizzy, and my stomach was wound so tightly in anxious knots that I was on the verge of vomiting. But I held it together long enough to notice two things on my phone. First was a notification informing me that the message to my friend failed to send. The second was the time, almost 4 am. I had lost an hour. I had been on that phone, held hostage for almost an hour.

I ran to the monitor and pulled up the feed once more, rewound an hour, set the playback speed to 16x, and watched. Normally, in time-lapse footage of someone standing still, you can still see them shift and twitch. But I watched myself stand still as the dead for almost an hour, listening to whatever was on the other end of the phone.

A flurry of questions raced through my mind. How did my call go through if the text to my friend failed to send? What was said on the call, and were the police in on… whatever the fuck was happening. Above all, I knew I had to leave. I didn't even call out; I just gathered my things, grabbed an umbrella, and walked out. Didn’t even make it 3 steps before I ran into her.

I almost screamed at the lithe woman huddled under the umbrella. She couldn’t have weighed more than 110 pounds soaking wet, and yet she terrified me. Sara noticed my apprehension and stepped forward.

“What’s wrong Jared?”

“Nothing. Something came up, and I’ve got to go.”

“Aw. But I wanted to hang out, and I needed more cigarettes. Can’t we just go back inside real quick?”

I took a step back, and she drew closer. On instinct, my hand shot out as if saying, “Stay back.”

“Oh, c’mon Jared,” she pressed.

“Joseph said you were dead, you’re not supposed to be here. I don’t know who you are.”

She reached her hand out towards me, beckoning for me to grab hold of it.

“Dead? That’s impossible, Jared. I’m here right now, flesh and bones.”

The seconds before her next words felt like an eternity. Lightning flashed, thunder roared, rain fell, and the storm churned, and yet she stood, unflinching.

“I’ve missed you, Jared. I’ve never got the chance to tell you before, but I always liked you.”

I shook my head, taking another step backward, inching towards the gas station door.

“You don’t believe me? Let me show you how real I am. How serious I am about my affections”

She tossed her umbrella to the ground and began to unzip her hoody. She wore nothing underneath, and with one languid movement, she slipped free of her hoodie's grasp. Wind and rain battered at her bare flesh, and yet she seemed unfazed. She inched closer, hands outstretched, begging for an embrace.  There was a static whine somewhere, reverberating in my head, calling the fog. I had to fight against the desire and compulsion to run towards her, and I was only barely winning. She was a siren, and I was transfixed.

“No one has seen my insides before Jared. I want you to be the first.”

Her hands snaked down her body, past her clavicle and breasts to the soft flesh of her belly. She circled her navel several times with her finger, made some strange throaty sound, and, without warning, plunged her fingers into her stomach. She didn’t scream, didn’t even react as her fingertips gouged deep into her skin, tore past muscle and sinew, and prodded at her squishy organs.

I yelled and flinched away, nearly stumbling to the ground as I tried to turn, but she walked forward, prying herself open. She flayed herself with sheer blunt force, and the flesh tore up towards her chest. Blood cascaded down and mixed with rainwater, and the diluted tendrils spread out towards me. Her organs didn’t look right; didn’t look human. The cavity was riddled with tumors the color of gangrenous flesh.

The centerpiece was this bulbous, hole-riddled hive. It was anchored by a thick cable of nerve fibers that connected directly to Sara’s spine. Every time she breathed, the flesh hive throbbed and exhaled a plume of black shimmering mist, and she would make that lusty, throaty sound.

“Don’t you want to join as one Jared?”

Her voice was cracked and strained, tinged with a static whine that hurt to hear. The voice of the dispatcher. Her breath quickened, and glittery dark smog poured from her wound, she attempted to close the distance. She waved her bloody hands towards me as she took a strained step. Another torrent of blood poured out of her, chunky with bits of flesh this time. Her mouth gaped as she let out a deafening roar, that horrid, distorted, static scream.

I was running before she could get any closer, before her siren call could take hold. I cleared the distance to my home faster than I ever had before. I practically threw myself into my house and locked all the windows and doors.

It’s been a few days since I haven’t left my house, and I haven't answered any calls or messages. Whatever’s happening, this force is influential enough to intercept 911 calls. I don’t know if that means I’m targeted and this is localized to me or if it’s spread across town. I’ve been left with so many questions, and I’m not sure I want the answers. I’m haunted by what happened while I was listening to that voice and siren over the phone. I’ll never know what those three men even wanted that night or why their faces couldn’t be seen.

I want to believe that the entire night was a bad trip, brought on by whatever nasty thing those strangers fed me, but I’ve fixated on a new idea. What if the drug's primary function wasn’t hallucinations, what if that was only a nasty side effect? What if what they fed me was meant to make me susceptible to manipulation or programming? I spent over an hour listening to that phone call. God knows what its purpose was, but what if they changed something in my mind, and now it’s impossible to fight against? What if a directive was implanted, and it’s so subtle I don’t even notice its effect?

Or what if it was real, what if something sinister and abnormal was happening, and I was caught in its path? What if something was puppeteering those three men and Sara’s body? When it tore itself open to show me its true self, was that a taunt or invitation?

I should run, I should flee, but the storm is still here, and I don’t have a car, and I don’t know if I can trust myself or anyone anymore. I can hear the whine of static occasionally, crackling from radios and TVs, always threatening to morph into that horrible mind-rending scream. I dream only of it for Godsake. I’m going to wait a few days to see if it was just a bad night, but I’m certain that something is wrong. The last message I got from my friend was a response to the one that was never sent, simply reading, “I’ll be seeing you[ soon](https://www.reddit.com/r/grimoireofmadness/).”
