Half a decade in the medical field has driven home precisely one fact that hasn’t contradicted itself with inexplicable miracles and cornea-peeling despair:

Nothing soothes like a cigarette.

I lit the tip and inhaled, letting the calming buzz exchange twenty minutes of my life for a moment when everything felt right. At any rate, maybe forty-seven seconds of any twenty minutes were worthwhile, so I accepted the transaction. I offered the cancer stick to Dr. Virgil. 

“No thanks, I don’t do drugs,” he responded dismissively while spreading his toes to find a vein. Settling on the best available, his eyes rolled back as he injected the Clonazepam.

I wish I could have opened a window to release the cigarette smoke, but that risked letting outsiders know that we were in the office. The operating table reeked of smoke at this point, but that was better than the drawbacks of ventilation.

[I work for Dr. Virgil at a hospital of the transmundane in one of the most extremely adequate strip malls of the entire county](https://redd.it/1b0hbzt). Business is steady because we work hard to hide ourselves.

That fact became moot as the door burst open. “We have a password!” I yelled as I got to my feet. Dr. Virgil, deep in his stupor, was momentarily unable to respond.

The man who burst in was stocky with a crew cut, looked to be in his thirties, and was probably ex-military. He looked through me to the incapacitated Dr. Virgil and marched forward. “I need help, and I need it now,” he demanded. 

I lifted a hand and pressed it against his chest. He stopped walking and stared down at it as though unable to comprehend what it meant.

“I require professional assistance,” he demanded, trying to move past. 

“The soundest advice I can give is to accept that change can only come from a willing heart.”

He looked at me like I was an idiot. “What?”

“What I said was that I cite people like you for my smoking habit. Some people claim that nicotine’s to blame, but I know it’s my own damn fault.” I pinched out the quarter-finished stick. “Now explain why you were pushing past me.”

“It’s my dog,” he answered, panting. He appeared agitated, like he was ready to hit someone. “The other one says we’re the same, but it’s a trick for the blood.”

I folded my arms. “For fuck’s sake, man, put the words in order before you say them.”

I think he would have hit me in that moment if the door hadn’t burst open. 

“I thought this was locked,” the second man announced, shocked. He was stocky with a crew cut, looked to be in his thirties, and was probably ex-military. He stared through me to the incapacitated Dr. Virgil and marched forward.

“My ability to mitigate the symptoms of moronity is inversely related to the quantity of morons in my presence,” I snapped. “Please wait your turn.”

He looked at me like I was an idiot. “What?”

“You couldn’t have waited until I was finished with my cigarette, could you?” I shouted, positioning myself between them. They stared back at me, each with his hands on his hips, each a foot taller than I stood. 

Both of them yelled at once. That roused Dr. Virgil.

“What can I do you for?” he asked, a placid smile on his face as he drifted forward through the Clone Fog.

“He’s not a real person,” the second one snapped, pointing at the first to enter the room.

“He’s not a good liar,” snapped the first, pointing at his identical counterpart. 

Dr. Virgil folded his thin arms. “Okay,” he answered. “What difference does it make in the long run? Most arguments fade away when you realize that it doesn’t matter what the other person thinks.”

They stared at him, momentarily paralyzed. “He wants to eat my dog,” the first one said.

“No, it’s *my* dog, and no one gets to eat him!” spat the other. 

“First things first,” Dr. Virgil interrupted, his voice droning. “I need to tell you apart. You came in first,” he explained, pointing to the first man, “and you were the last,” he continued while turning to the second. “From A to Z, you’ll be Azariah and Zadok.”

“Those aren’t our names!” shouted Azariah. He scratched himself vigorously. 

“I didn’t say those were your names, I said that’s what I’ll call you. I don’t want to know your business; human beings are foul creatures. Besides, it seems that you’re claiming to be the same person?”

“My name is Gauner!” they shouted in perfect unison. “He is lying!” they added, each pointing at the other.

“And both wants the real Gauner’s dog?” Dr. Virgil pressed.

“Damn straight!” shouted Zadok.

“Of course I want my dog!” shouted Azariah.

At this point, Dr. Virgil’s face went blank. I’m always telling him to come down easy off a Clone Fog, but physicians have a thing about healing themselves. 

“What the doctor’s trying to say is that one of you is clearly a Mimic, and the other is the authentic douchebag, correct?”

They both glared at me. “Yes,” they answered in unison. 

“This creature appeared from the darkness and took my form,” growled Azariah. “Then he tried to hurt my Bichon.”

“All of that is true except reversed,” Zadok growled. “That *thing* is an unholy pest that has no place on earth.”

“So you agree that one of you should be exterminated,” I clarified.

“Yes,” they chorused. 

“And the other is just kind of a turd who should continue living with the other turds that comprise the bulk of humanity.”

“Yes,” they answered with the same emphasis. 

“Okay,” I sighed, turning to Dr. Virgil. “Do you have anything in the books to deal with this?”

One eye focused on me, but the other was peering into places that didn’t exist on any map. “This,” he crooned, pulling a machete from under the table.

The fear jolted me so powerfully that I nearly toppled. A Mimic can wield six times the ability of anything it copies, which meant it was going to fight back with the strength of half a dozen men once it was unmasked. Dr. Virgil didn’t stand a chance even with a machete, and I internally questioned the medical decisions he was making while high. 

“A wise man once said that a good compromise leaves everybody mad. We’ll cut the dog in half,” he explained as the machete shook in his hand. “Each ‘person’ gets one part.” 

Azariah stared at him, one eyebrow raised. “You’re going to chop my dog in two just to spite this asshole?”

“Better yet, I’ll let *you* two sort it out,” Dr. Virgil continued. Then, carefully, he reached under the operating table and pulled out a small Teflon container. The fear in my bones jumped to eleven when I realized what it was. “A sip of this will give each of you enough strength to rip a dog in half.” He stepped back from the container with speed that I had not believed capable of such an intoxicated man. 

Zadok stared at his counterpart in horror. Azariah took the momentary hesitation to grab the Teflon container and rip it open, gulping its contents. 

“Please, Doctor, just give him the dog! Don’t kill her!” Zadok yelled. 

Dr. Virgil finally focused both eyes on Zadok. “I’ll give the dog to the second man. Do not kill the dog; Zadok is his person.”

Azariah stared at Dr. Virgil in fury as comprehension dawned that he had been tricked. 

“Better run,” Dr. Virgil warned Zadok. “This creature is very unlikable when it’s angry.”

Zadok bolted for the door while Azariah dropped all pretenses and changed his form. My fear reached a new level as he grew two feet taller and blanched his oversized eyeballs to an appalling white. The creature’s jaw lowered four inches, six inches, and then an entire foot. 

“We should consider an extreme evacuation,” I warned in a panicked voice. “Do we have time to escape the propane?”

“No need,” the good doctor replied, his voice calm. “That wasn’t a strength serum.” He turned to the Mimic. “Surely you’ll recognize the indigestion caused by fluoroantimonic acid?”

The Mimic lurched. 

Then he screamed loud enough to shoot physical pain through the space between my ears. 

We watched as the being fell to its knees before curling into the fetal position. 

“Is it safe to have fluoroantimonic acid spilling through his skin and into the office?” I asked, stepping away from the writhing beast. 

“Hell, no,” Dr. Virgil responded. “But we have to keep it close. Do you know what kind of a creature would be willing to tear open a defenseless Bichon?”

“Some kind of monster from the ninth layer of hell,” I answered, clenching my fists.

“Exactly, Beatrice,” he answered. “Which means two things.”

“We have to kill it,” I responded, watching as its tongue erupted and flapped with the speed of a hummingbird’s wings. 

“Yep,” Dr. Virgil answered, moving closer to the Mimic. “If you grab its… head protrusions, I’ll slice open its neck. Which brings me to the second thing.” 

“You want to collect its blood.”

“We rarely see something *this* evil, Nurse,” he explained. “The blood will be an invaluable addition to my apothecary.” 

I groaned and crossed my arms. “This counts as overtime.”

“I can pay you in powdered grixxxley beeth resin. You’ll never need another cigarette again.”

“No thank you, I’m at peace with my drug use. Nothing supernatural. You can be a difficult man, Dr. Virgil, so I guess I’ll have to settle for making a tiny change to the world as payment. Now hurry up and cut this thing’s head off, I don’t want to touch it any longer than is [absolutely necessary](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/).”
