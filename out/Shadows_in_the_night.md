We all fear something. As adults most of our fears are reasonable; mortgage payments, not getting fired, tangible things in our lives. However, as kids, fears are born of the unknown; shadows at the foot of your bed, a creaking coming from the wardrobe, things a naïve mind can’t comprehend.

Well, it seems my mind is regressing as I’ve been seeing shadows.

I don’t know how it got brought up, but one evening while my family were eating dinner, my mother questioned me about something she’d obviously been holding back for a while.

Apparently when I was young, somewhere around five, maybe six, my parents awoke to the sound of me crying. This was back when they still slept in the same bed, but obviously startled, they rushed into my room and found nothing. Just me tightly curled into a ball under my covers, quietly whimpering.

After repeatedly asking me what was wrong, according to my mother I said, “the shadow man was watching me.”

My father scoured the room, checking anywhere a person could be hiding or a way they could have got in. With that search fruitless, they were compelled to chalk it up to a nightmare, allowing me to sleep with them that night.

Throughout the following weeks to months, I’d occasionally burst out crying late into the night, though when they rushed in, again there was nothing. This pattern persisted for a good couple of months before I stopped suddenly.

In their eyes I’d got over my fear of the shadows cast by the furniture in my room, with that incident fading from their and subsequently my memory.

Before she regurgitated that little story, I had no memory of the shadows, with their existence attributed to childish paranoia, though I couldn’t get what she’d said after out of my mind.

“I know it wasn’t real, they were just nightmares, but that first time, when we rushed in. I thought I could see a man by the side of your bed. It wasn’t for long, fading as your father flicked the light switch on, but there was something.”

My father’s eye roll only exacerbated what his personal opinions were on the matter.

By that evening and after a good couple of hours sat at my desk, my mind was elsewhere, though her words must have lingered in my subconscious. Laying down and drifting off I recall having an out of body experience.

As dreams are, its patchy, but something to the effect of seeing myself sleeping from a position to my beds right. With my room’s layout, my bed was pushed up close to the wall, with just enough room for a person to be stood in that strip.

Waking suddenly as if I’d been pulled into a sitting position, my eyes fixed onto the dark shape stood in the vague vicinity of my dream self. Without thinking my kneejerk reaction was to swing, flailing my right arm in a poor attempt at a fight response. The only outcome was the small, knuckle shaped dint I left in my wake, with that phantom figure fading.

Giving myself a minute for my racing heart to subside, I let out a small chuckle, imagining how stupid I’d looked, swinging at a shadow. Rotating in place, in order to reach for the light switch just above my bed frame, my eyes caught a snapshot, before the fluorescent bulbs illuminated my view.

For a millisecond and maybe not even that, there was another figure peaking from behind my wardrobe. Physically that shouldn’t be possible as the gap between my bookshelf and wardrobe was about as wide as a shoebox, but I know what I saw.

At the time I just played it off as my subconscious mind replaying mum’s story, fuelling a childhood fear long since discarded, but not forgotten. Though that would be true in a perfect world, it wasn’t the last time I’d see my spectres.

Weeks to months and now years, those shadows persist. Initially they’d just stand there, silent statues of what I think are people, at least that’s what the silhouette’s appear like. Their fuzzy, almost void like façade a deeper black than the darkness of my room.

Part of me was content to just ignore them, what could a stationary shadow really do? However practically the moment my mind stopped pointing them out to me and those out of body experiences stopped, they moved.

Obviously, my mates would assume I went crazy if I said anything and the way my parents’ marriage is, I don’t want to add another problem to the pile.

I knew they’d say they were simply shadows cast by objects in my room, which sounds obvious and mundane, but a small part of my mind tried to comfort me initially with that sentiment.

Evidently that idea didn’t last. Waking from a dream where I was stood in front of my mirror, the urge to piss had become too strong to ignore, as I rolled out of bed, still half asleep. Seeing the vague jostles of movement in my mirrored wardrobe, didn’t alarm me as I drowsily opened my door and trudged down the hall. In my partially awake state, my mind must have been lagging behind, that movement wasn’t a reflection from the sparce light trickling through my blind, it wasn’t me.

Panicked I recalled the dream I’d been so rudely pulled from. Now observing from another vantage spot, I was acutely aware that during that vision, I wasn’t in control. That wasn’t me in the dream and that wasn’t my movement in the mirror.

Thought that revelation sparked another wave of fear, surprisingly as it did the previous weeks, my mind started to phase the shadows out. Most of the time there would be the single apparition and for all my hysteria, it would only ‘walk’ from my mirror to the desk and then back.

It was a stupid notion, but the way that spectre moved, reminded me of myself, walking that same path across my room. I even accidentally stepped through it one night, when I got up to grab the water bottle, I’d left on my desk.

Oddly I didn’t feel anything, at least not as pronounced as the ghost hunting shows would have described the feeling of hitting a gust of ice-cold air. At best it was comparable to the sensation of walking into a room where the air was denser, nothing major, but definitely noticeable.

Eventually they became as constant as the birds chirping in the early morning or my alarm crashing to life. I did feel a little watched, as the second and then third shadow didn’t seem to move very frequently, but as time progressed, they too were trotting across my room.

Similarly, those out of body experiences also dwindled, though they did give a sense of déjà vu. Their movements become more pronounced as their bodies began to articulate a more human movement style, to the point that in one instance, I couldn’t even tell I was dreaming.

An idea lingered, one I tried to force down and not dwell on. Tantamount to the thought of death and what comes after, an existential question tried its best to rear up from the depths.

If they’re attempting to learn from me, as I imagine they are, then why?

Except for my mother, no-one but me had seen them. Unfortunately, a barrier I expected was beyond them, was violently crossed.

We’d booked to leave on a weeklong holiday, something my father hoped would rekindle something and drag my mother out of her lethargy.

As dad’s do, my father wanted us up at 4:30, as according to him, we desperately needed to be three hours early for our flight.

Walking in and gripping my shoulder, he woke me giving the typical spiel, "come on, get up, I want to be gone in forty-five!" Turning and reaching for my wardrobe, in an attempt to grab something he thought I’d forgotten, he passed close to one of the shadows.

Whilst still rubbing my eyes his pained cries rang out. Trying, through sleep covered eyes, my focus landed on his twisted posture and the elongated dark extension embedded in his right shoulder. Fingers, something I didn’t know they possessed, pierced his upper arm and the top of his shoulder blade.

With the picture in front of me a nightmarish blend of the physical and ethereal, my initial response was to force the figure to stop in the only way I knew how, as my hand reached for the switch.

In an instant the figure and its compatriots were gone, and my father fixed his footing, only to eke out, "was just a cramp, make sure you’ve packed everything", before shuffling out holding his shoulder.

That holiday for the rest of my family was a nice change of pace and a satisfying way to rekindle something for my parents, though for me, it was a recuring nightmare I traumatizingly forced myself to withstand.

Fuelled with physical animation, my once benign nightwalkers quickly sought out to use their newfound touch. Gripping pain, moving items and an all-encompassing fear plagued me each and every night.

Worse still were the dreams. They knew I was tethered to them and they took full advantage. Drawing my vision in close as they jabbed my unflinching body.

Though this was the first time I’d slept in a different room, they played with its contents as if they’d inhabited it for centuries. I tried to block out any sounds they made, content for them to stay as unassuming as before, but as that threshold had been crossed once, a second time only seemed inevitable.

Cackling toned up and down mimics of my fathers words, contorted into siren calls, just egging me on to react.

Like a primitive human, night is now a dangerous and all-encompassing period in which I desperately don’t want to inhabit. I’ve tried to keep my light as my mother does, but no matter how strong and blinding those bulbs are, shadows still dance in the crevasse and alcoves of a place I once felt safe in.

My sister asked me a question a couple of days ago, which just like my mother’s statement, niggled at deep ancient animalistic part of my brain, sending a numbingly cold bolt up my spine.

"I know this is going to sound crazy, but I think something is casting a shadow on my back wall."

I’m drained; both my muscles and my mind are running on empty. They’ve done something to me, but I don’t know what. I’m not even confident that I’m the origin. Whatever the case they’re spreading, and I don’t know what they want or how to stop them.

If you see something in the corner of your eye, don’t look, don’t give them any indication that you can perceive them in anyway, they aren’t just shadows in the night.
