It was a new job, very well paid.  
The company is based on exporting and importing goods (worldwide).

The company’s building consists of 5 floors, and there were some rules, which were quite normal, except one- You can’t  enter Door 517.

The sign at the ground floor (Floor 1) says:  
*Floor 1 - Entrance*  
*Floor 2 - Accounting*  
*Floor 3 - Management*  
*Floor 4 - Warehouse*  
*Floor 5 - Under Construction*

I worked at floor 2, one day I had to bring some documents to management (floor 3), and from there went to floor 4 (Warehouse) to bring more paper for my office printer, since it was only 1 floor away, I have decided to use the stairs.

I was busy on my phone and apparently missed the exit to floor 4, I tried to exit but the door was locked. I haven’t realized that it was floor 5 (there are more stairs for the roof so I had no idea I was at the last floor). I knocked on the door and said- 

“Hey! It’s me, J! I need to get more paper for my printer, anyone there?”

No answer, sigh… what now? No way I am going back to my office, I tried calling.. no answer.  
I knocked again, this time more firmly, I tried playing with the door handle… *something broke*, The door has started to open…

The floor was dark, couldn’t see a thing. I used the flashlight on my phone, I still thought it was the warehouse.  
I knew I messed up, but curiosity got the best of me.  
I started shouting:  

*”Hey, this is J, from accounting. I need to get more paper for my printer.*

Nothing- darkness, silence. I walked for maybe 30 seconds, until I reached a T section, I took the left turn.  
At the end, there was nothing, I went back and took the other way, I almost reached the end, then I saw something at the end, it was very dirty, I used my hand to brush the dirt away… and it said “517 - Authorized Personal Only”.

I understood right away, I am at floor 5, I walked back towards the stairs, but then I heard a faint voice, coming from 517.

I went back, 517 is locked shut, no way to enter.  
I knocked on the door-

*”Hey! Is there anyone in there?”*

No response, I asked again and again, nothing.  
I put my ear on the door-

*”Do NOT Enter!”*

The voice said, faintly, I remembered that this was one of the main rules when I got hired, everyone in the company knew that this room was forbidden.

I had to check it out anyway, I tried looking through the keyhole, I saw someone moving inside, then he stopped, turned around and looked at the keyhole, he was staring back at me.

I ran away as fast as I could towards the staircase, I heard the door (517) open, someone is chasing me, I ran all the way downstairs to the ground floor, down until floor 2 I could still see him chasing me, only when I reached the ground floor was when he disappeared.

The receptionist looked confused-

*”J, are… are you feeling ok?”*

I screamed: 

*”Someone was chasing me! From the… 5th floor”*

She stared at me, frozen in place:

*”You know that you aren’t allowed there, don’t tell anyone about this. Leave and don’t come back, for your safety.”*

I decided that I should take that advice, I called my boss and told him that I quit, he asked me why, I told him that it was due to personal reasons.

Things took an even stranger turn from there.  
Things in my apartment weren’t where I left them, there were signs that someone was after me.

I stayed on low profile for weeks, maybe months.. who even counts? I didn’t know where to go, who would believe me? I used to constantly look behind me, making sure that no one was following me.

One day, I saw an email saying-  
*”You shouldn’t have done this.”*

Panicking, I went outside, to places with as many people as possible, it gave me a false sense of safety.  

Nighttime has arrived, less people outside, I am alone, they can be everywhere. I regret ever getting that job.  
I called my boss, I told him everything, he said-  

*”Meet me near the old marketplace in an hour.”*

I arrived, he wasn’t there, I tried calling again…  

*Blacks out, sharp pain… is all I remember*.

I woke up, in a room-

“*Wher… Where am I?* I asked”*

My boss (ex boss to say), came from the corner of the room, he said-

*”You wanted to see what’s inside room 517, didn’t you? This is 517, where a journey ends and a new journey begins…”*

They put a rag in my mouth, I could barely make a sound… right then, I heard someone out of the door saying-

*”Hey! Is there anyone in there?”*

I tried with all my power to warn them, I could barely make a sound, but I was able to say one thing -

*”Do NOT Enter!”*

Right at that moment, a person behind my boss came, looked at the keyhole, opened the door and started chasing that person.
