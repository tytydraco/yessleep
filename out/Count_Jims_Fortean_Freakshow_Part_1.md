Journal of Frater XII of the Esoteric Order of the Other

October 17th, 1993 - Scrimbus, TX

The static hum of the old kinescope still rings in my ears, even hours after the show. Tonight was… different. Not the usual parade of bewildered yokels calling in about ghost lights or the juvenile antics of former high school classmates calling to mock me with the hated nickname "Sasquatch Fucker". Something has shifted, like a tectonic plate groaning beneath the surface.

It was from the call-in segment of my public access show. It started innocently enough. “Count Jim’s Fortean Freakshow” chugged along as usual, the low-budget graphics flickering on the screen. I’d just finished a segment about a the carnivorous "bridge lurkers" found in dark places among urban sprawl.

The phone line crackled, the voice on the other end a tremulous, young thing. “This is Suzie… from Anson,” she’d stammered. Her voice was tight with a kind of terror I rarely hear outside the field, the raw, heart-thumping fear in her voice palpable. “Count Jim, please, please don’t air the next segment.”

I paused, my hand hovering over the remote that controlled the tape deck. “Suzie, what are you talking about? Is this another crank call like the previous guy?”

“No, it’s not! It’s- it’s... You can’t air it. It’s not safe, not for the EOTO, not for the children of the Other.” Her voice cracked. “I've seen this happen way too many times for my liking...”

I glanced at the tape, sitting innocently on the console: a beat-up VHS, fell from the sky a few months ago at a renaissance festival in Waxahachie. Some vendor I ran across on my last trip to Dallas was pawning off ‘paranormal artifacts,’ a term that makes my skin crawl these days. I’d paid a pittance for it, mostly for a laugh. The tape was labelled with nothing more than a Sharpie scrawl: "Collider - 10/16/96"

“Suzie, what ‘children of the Other’?” I asked, my stoicism straining at the edges at the utterence of the phrase outside my circles. It was the first time I’d seen a caller use that specific wording. Usually it’s the “demon” or “devil” crowd, never anything that hints at understanding.

 “Just… please. Don’t air it.” The line went dead.

My brow furrowed beneath my flat-brimmed cowboy hat. The red-tinted lenses of my glasses seemed to amplify the static on the monitor in front of me. For the sake of the show, I hit the play button when it was time for the segment to air.

After a brief synopsis of the events leading to its discovery, the tape unfurled, revealing a grainy, distorted image. It was the supercollider site outside Waxahachie. But it wasn't the active and operational site I knew. It was in ruins. Metal twisted and rusted, concrete cracked, overgrown with weeds. There wasn't a living soul in sight. The camera swept across the desolate landscape, clipping to various scenes in the decrepit administrative buildings and tunnels beneath the complex. And then there was a date stamp: 10/16/96. Three years into the future.

Oh, and the monsters encountered by the entrepid explorer that made the tape. Monsters are standard fare for the show. The two pictured seemed pathetic. Rotting. But alive and suffering. One octopoid creature thrashing about and a gnarly decomposing reptilian beast that seemed to spring life before the tape cut out. The state of the collider facility and the dates on the tape worried me far more, making these sad creatures an afterthought.

My blood ran cold. This was no ordinary anomaly. My show has always dealt with strange things, but this… this felt… wrong. This went beyond misidentified cryptids or ghostly apparitions. This was a direct violation, a tear, in spacetime itself.

The rest of the show was a blur. The broadcast kept glitching out with digital artifacts, the picture fracturing and reassembling like a broken mirror. I kept trying to keep my composure, spouting some fabricated nonsense about ‘temporal anomalies’ and ‘possible cross-dimensional bleed through’ but it felt hollow. I'm sure the viewers barely noticed though. The public is remarkably obtuse.

During the end credits the image that was supposed to show the logo for EOTO Holdings, a shell company created by the Order to fund the show, was replaced by a silhouette. A tall, red robed figure, head bowed under a pointed Spanish capriota. It was a silhouette of a penitent, a religious zealot. The kind you would see during Easter processions... easily mistaken for a klan member by the mundane, though I know the difference. Someone or something had invaded the credits, like a parasitic entity.

After a horrible night's sleep, I woke up at the crack of noon. I booted up the EOTO's secret BBS. The server fan whirred like an animal purring in the corner, as I typed out a message to Soror XI. She's my immediate superior within the EOTO, a woman who communicates only via chat and encrypted files.

The chat log is as follows. Please pardon the redundancy in my messaging. I was in the middle of a panic attack and was trying to nail my point across.

[Soror XI has entered the chat]

Soror XI: Hey Count. Or should I start calling you Sasquatch Fucker? This better be good. I was in the middle of making lunch for the kids.

Frater XII: Oh ha ha. We need to discuss what happened during last night's show. It’s been bugging me since we wrapped up the broadcast.

Soror XI: Oh, what now? That spooky call-in you got, right? It's just some backwater tinfoil hat trying to stir the pot. You need to stop letting these things get to you.

Frater XII: This one was different. The caller warned us not to air the piece about the collider tape. They mentioned the Order and the Children of the Other. You know me better not to let some crank call get to me.

Soror XI: You're really taking this seriously? You know what's real. What's out there. Not to mention, we have EOTO members working in cooperation with the NAORC at the highest clearance levels at the collider for fuck's sake. If something goofy was going on, we'd be the first to know.

Frater XII: It wasn't just the call. During the show, especially when the collider was mentioned, we had strange audio and video glitches. Especially at the end of the credits, the distortion resembled the silouette of some scary looking guy. It gave me the chills when I saw it.

Soror XI: Technical glitches happen all the time. We can't let every flicker and distortion spook us. I think you’re overreacting.

Frater XII: You seem awfully dismissive. Are you hiding something? You of all people know I'm not just some backwoods Art Bell wannabe. If there's something I need to know, I need transparency. Especially if my ass is the one on the line hosting this show for the Order.

Soror XI: Hiding something? Why would I? Look, the silhouette could have been anything. Probably another show's signal got crossed with yours There’s no need to jump to conclusions.

Frater XII: I can tell you're being dodgy about something. There's something about this crap that doesn't sit right with me. I feel we need to investigate further. Maybe even get Pater Magnus involved.

Soror XI: Fine, if it will put your mind at ease, we'll look into it, but I am NOT going to pester Pater Magnus about it. He already has enough on his plate. Let's stay rational. Fear and superstition won't help us.

Frater XII: Fine whatever. Let’s have the archivists review the footage frame by frame and enhance the audio. We should also fortify our protection wards, just in case.

Soror XI: Sure, sure. But honestly, Count, you need to take a step back and breathe. We can't let every spooky incident throw us into a frenzy.

Frater XII: I understand the need for calm, but the call, the glitches, the silhouette—they all point to something significant. I can't just ignore it. I have major bad vibes from it.

Soror XI: Look, you, me, and the Order have been doing this for a while. You of all people know strange shit happens all the time. Monsters. Other-touched beings. Rogue Emissaries. Doesn’t mean there’s a grand conspiracy or some malevolent force at play.

Frater XII: You keep making this out as nothing. Why are you so reluctant to commit to a bigger investigation?

Soror XI: Reluctant? I’m just trying to keep us focused on what’s real and tangible. We have other important matters to attend to without chasing shadows. Besides, I already said we'll take a look

Frater XII: Okay I don't mean to be a pain in the ass about it. But this thing could be a key piece of a larger puzzle. Ignoring it could be a mistake.

Soror XI: Or it could be a wild goose chase, distracting us from our true work. We need to be practical.

Frater XII: I still feel like you’re hiding something. There’s more to your dismissiveness than mere practicality.

Soror XI: Hiding something? What could I possibly be hiding? I just think we shouldn’t waste our time and resources on every odd occurrence and "bad vibe". We have real work to do.

Frater XII: Alright, but I won’t drop this. Please keep me updated on what you find, no matter how small the lead. If there’s nothing to find, so be it. But if there is, I seriously need to know.

Soror XI: Fine. Just remember, not everything is a grand mystery waiting to be solved. Sometimes, things are just… what they are.

Frater XII: Maybe so, but we owe it to ourselves to find out. Let’s proceed with caution and clarity.

Soror XI: Whatever, Count. I said for the millionth time I'll have the archivists look into it. Just take your prozac and get back to your primary tasks, ok? You're getting on my last goddamn nerve. I got shit to do, so I'm out. I'll get back to you if I find anything. Just get next weekend's show ready.

 [Soror XI has left the chat]

That was it. No acknowledgement, no discussion of the potential ramifications. It was dismissive, almost flippant. It isn’t her way. She cares too deeply for the Order and its safety. Something was being hidden.

I traced the caller's number back, a simple feat with my setup. It led to a payphone of a gas station outside of Anson. No help there. Then I dove into the digital breadcrumbs of the tape itself: the format, the encoding, all of it. The tape itself is clean. No alterations and nothing particularly exotic- aside from the contents. Just a standard VHS tape that looked like a tornado ran over it.

I felt a headache coming on behind my eyes, a dull throb that echoed the hum of the kinescope. This wasn't the kind of strange the EOTO was designed to investigate, it was something else. Something deeper and darker. But if it threatened the children of the Other, it would be their- no- OUR duty to face it. Who else will? The narrow-minded idiots at the North American Occult Research and Containment Coalition?

I paced around my small living room for hours, the floorboards creaking under my Doc Martens. The ouroboros on my ring felt strangely warm against my skin. My long black duster coat swirled around my legs as I pulled it on, the garment a familiar comfort amidst the turmoil.

My mission is balance, understanding, and protection. Not just for the denizens of the light, but the Other, too. Suzie, or whoever she was, got the right phrasing. “The children of the Other.” Not demons, not monsters, but beings, good and bad. Just like you and me, albeit from a different side of the coin. And she was frightened. For them. Something is coming. Whether it’s from the future or from a place beyond our understanding, it’s coming.

I went to the computer once more and started to type a message on the show's official BBS, this time, being a little less cryptic than my usual fare. I told the viewers about the tape. I told them that I needed to know if anyone had seen anything. And how they felt. How they reacted. With a little nudge they might be able to see something I can’t. A crack in my glasses, a change in the perception.

I glanced at my TV. The screen was still now. Just black. But I swear, for a moment, I could see the faint outline of something there. It was something in the negative space, something that moved in the corners of my vision.

I went outside and stood on my porch under the now inky black of a Texan sky as I realized that I spent the entire day fretting. The wind whispered around me. I don't know what is coming, but I know it will need the EOTO to stand against it. And I know that I have to do more than just run a program on a backwoods public access channel. And that whatever this threat is, Soror XI is not telling me everything.


I will be ready. And if the worst happens, hopefully whoever finds this journal can do something.
