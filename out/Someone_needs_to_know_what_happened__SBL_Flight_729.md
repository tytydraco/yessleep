Below is what is accepted to be the official transcript of the Cockpit Voice Recorder of Sky Bridge Logistics (SBL) Flight 729. This Transcript was transcribed with the help of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), The Federal Security Service (FSB) of Moscow, the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) of Moscow, with help from the United Nations. All of which have signed off on this copy being accessible to [Redacted] to help further understand the cause and nature of the incident in question.

Due to the Investigation being ongoing at this time, it was agreed upon by all parties involved that this Transcript not be released to the public in any capacity to avoid any unwanted attention towards the investigation. Any and all personnel who violate this agreement shall be met with both disciplinary (full termination) and legal action as necessary. 

Description of Flight in question: SBL Flight 729 is a Tupolev TU-204-100C aircraft, acquisitioned by the United States government (presidential office) in connection with the Russian Federation (Kremlin Seal) for the transport of sensitive cargo. 
Maximum takeoff weight: 103mt 
Date of last Maintenance Check: August 7th, 2023
State of Aircraft (Before Incident): Flight Ready
State of Aircraft (Currently): Presumed Flight Ready

 Due to the extremely volatile nature of this joint operation, the amount of information within this document is all you will have to use to help in the process of the investigation 

Aboard SBL Flight 729 during the incident flight was forty-seven gas canisters, two separate lab equipment kits that included heavy machinery, a supply of Hazmat suits outfitted to withstand the contents of the aforementioned canisters, and one offloader for the combined weight of 54mt 

The Flight Crew of SBL Flight 729 were as follows:

Cpt. Joseph "Matchbox" McCoy, United States Air force - Pilot (age 39)
Kpt. Maksim Glazastov, Russian Aerospace Force - Co-pilot (age 37)
Sqn Ldr Zahir Rao, Indian Air Force - Flight Engineer (age 42)


The Flight was scheduled to take off at 0600 UTC on August 9th, 2023, however, it had been delayed to 0645 UTC due to complications with both loading the aforementioned cargo, and clearance issues between the main 2 governments involved. At approximately 0647 UTC, SBL Flight 729 took off from runway 9/27 on Fort Liberty Airforce Base, North Carolina, heading East towards it's intended Destination of Ukrainka Air Base in Amur Oblast, Russia. This flight was scheduled to make a refueling stop in Istanbul. The flight lasted a total of 16 minutes. Exactly 9 minutes into the flight, a Mayday was sent out by Captain McCoy to the Air Traffic Control tower where he was cleared to return to Fort Liberty. Captain McCoy successfully made a 180Â° turn at flight level 89, and began his descent. Eye witnesses report seeing the aircraft dumping fuel and descending "rapidly" and flying "sluggishly" before making touchdown at 0703 UTC. Emergency vehicles were on seen awaiting the doors of the aircraft to open, which they never did. Fearing the pilots and crew had fallen unconscious from whatever emergency had caused their return, the emergency responders rushed to the aircraft at 0710 UTC. Upon entering the aircraft they were met with what one responder called "dark blue smoke" blowing out of the open door. Once the smoke cleared, responders entered the airplane to retrieve the crew and search for a fire. No fire was located, nor was any member of the crew. 

After the engines were shut off by a responder and extensive search was done in and around the aircraft looking for any survivors or remains, none were located. All cargo from the aircraft was removed and carefully examined. One of the canisters marked as "HOPCCN" had suffered minor damage causing the contents to drain to about 95% capacity. Apart from this, all else appeared normal. 


The agency of [Redacted] is tasked with listening and reviewing the Transcript of the CVR Recording of the flight in question, which has been approved by both governments. All parties involved are to be notified immediately and simultaneously if there is a discovery made from your findings. To help, the names of the crew will be placed beside their respective CAMs.
