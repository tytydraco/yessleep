The door creaked open as I stood, my eyes wide in shock and fixed on Nichole. She had her gun. I was immensely thankful to see it this time. Neither of us moved like frozen effigies fearing the inevitable fire. The footsteps from the room beyond were soft – slow, measured. What is a chimera? My mind conjured images of the mythological creature but that couldn’t possibly be what she meant. The creature now roaming the living room was not a wild, ancient beast. It sounded human, and it was hunting for us. My heart – so frequently on the run – was back at a sprint. I feared it would soon give out. A horrible swooping feeling in my stomach made me slap my hand over my mouth, refusing to let that stupid reflex win. The faint sound of my hand striking my face may as well have been a scream. The footsteps stopped, and then the intruder did something utterly staggering. It called out to me. 

“Liz! Hello?” it beckoned with a voice that was at once alien and eerily familiar. A face swam in my mind’s eye of the not-me that released me from that underground hell. It was still a husky, growling voice, but it seemed slightly more…human than before. It wasn’t her. This was a trick – something to lure me out. Nichole’s expression was stony, but her eyes betrayed the fear and confusion I felt. Then it spoke again. 

“I’m not here to hurt. I’ve been helping. Photos. DVD. I sent,” it said, sounding breathless. “Been following. Keeping safe. My sister.” 

Sister? Who is her sister? Did she mean me? Nichole? My mind was a beehive, ceaselessly buzzing with question after unanswered question. The footsteps started again, coming ever closer. Nichole raised the gun, ready to take aim. For some inexplicable reason, I waved her down and stepped directly in the way. I must have trusted whatever or whoever this was. I could barely justify it to myself. Nichole begrudgingly removed her finger from the trigger but did not lower her arm. I held my breath as the thing stepped through the open doorway from the living room into the kitchen. It – she – was mere feet from me. I almost laughed when I saw her in normal clothes. It was an errant, split-second reaction. I had only ever been able to imagine her in that tattered and stained hospital gown. I stifled the thought immediately. Her movements were more fluid and natural than they were in our first encounter. I felt a heavy sadness take over when she turned, finally, to face me. She did not come closer. Once she saw me, our eyes locked, and I saw hers fill with tears. Her expression was grim, sorrowful. Without thinking or deciding to act, my feet took me closer to her. I was not aware of moving until I was only an arm’s length away. Her mouth split into a goofy, genuine smile. She lumbered over the remaining space between us and pulled me into a bone crushing hug. 

“Miss sister. So much. Be together. Always,” she attempted to whisper in my ear, but that was one skill she did not seem to have mastered. It was too loud in my ear, but that may also have been due to the preceding hours of silence. The hug was unbearably tight, but I somehow knew she wasn’t meaning to hurt me. She also did not seem to want to let me go. Nichole, still on high alert, walked up behind us, tapped the not-me on the arm with the barrel of the gun, and demanded her attention.

“Hey!” she shouted, her voice quavering. “Hey! Let Liz go. Who the fuck are you? How did you find this place?” The arms around me relaxed and the not-me gently pushed me away from herself. She then stepped between the gun and me. 

“I am friend,” she told Nichole. “Liz is sister. Followed. From Liz home. From motel.” There was a strained, frustrated tone as she explained. It was like there was a disconnect between her brain and her mouth. The stilted way she spoke had the simplicity of a caveman, but it occurred to me in that moment that even though she sounded like an animal trained to speak, she was not actually stupid. There was a depth of emotion and the look of intelligence in her eyes I hadn’t seen until now. What had they done to her? Who was she before?

Nichole needed more convincing. A floorboard creaked behind the three of us, and we all jumped. A soft voice followed, “Sis?” Nichole’s whole body was tense – like someone strapped to a rocket and unsure when it would explode. She screamed at the boy now standing in the hall. “Fuck! Damnit, Aaron! I told you to stay in your room!” Despite the strain, there was a guilty quality betrayed on her face. This wasn’t just another rebellious flunky like Nichole. It suddenly made so much sense why she seemed to implicitly trust this kid – why she was so aggressively protective. This was her brother. It was almost funny how strangely fitting that was. 

He had the panicked and guilty look of a dog being scolded. He even whimpered, solidifying the image. He looked at my “sister” as if she were a wild, bloodthirsty bear. He started to say something, his mouth opening for a moment, but Nichole spoke before the words escaped him.

“Liz is not your fucking sister. I know WHAT you are,” she declared, every word filled with venom. She shifted her gaze to me, “Don’t trust this thing, Liz. She’s a killer.” Her accusation should have shocked me or scared me, but I already knew she was a killer. I had seen the bodies she left in her wake. I was still afraid, but not of what I thought she would do to me. The fear I felt was deeper, more sinister. I feared what she was – what they had made her. She was the perverse funhouse mirror image of myself. She was the monster I could have been – the monster I would have been if she had not saved me. 

But did she really save me? They let me go. They had a tracker implanted in me. Did she know? Was she – is she still – playing her part? I believed her. I knew I shouldn’t, but there was a connection I couldn’t ignore. I was struggling to find words – any words – that fit this moment. I wanted Nichole to back off. I wanted to comfort the childlike boy cowering down the hall. I wanted desperately just to be able to sit the fuck down. But mostly, I wanted the not-me to give me the answers I had been burning to know. The time stretched seconds into centuries, no one willing to give an inch to the other. It was maddening. Finally, I spluttered out a rushed and nearly incoherent sentence, “Stop. All of you. Let’s just…Just… Let’s figure this out.” All eyes snapped to me. Nervously, I gestured for everyone to follow me back into the living room. I sat down on the couch. Nichole and the not-me followed my lead, though warily. The boy, Aaron, hovered uncertain in the doorway. It was downright bizarre. The living room’s antiquated yet pristine décor stood in stark contrast to the three people now occupying it—each teetering on the edge of sanity. 

Nichole had made the short walk from shadow into light, her gun still fixed on our intruder. I was beyond exhausted – every muscle screamed with an ache so deep that no amount of rest would restore me. My mind was bubbling over with adrenaline and fatigue, oscillating between clarity and confusion. One good push would send me reeling into a psychological void I might never escape, so I clung to the relative normalcy of this room as if it were the only buoy in an unforgiving and stormy sea. 

“Have question?” the not-me asked, pointing to me. “Have answer.” she added, pointing to herself. Of course I had questions! Thousands! Millions of questions! I looked at her, then Nichole. The first question that tumbled from me stemmed more out of a Southern girl’s upbringing than anything else. “What do I call you? I mean, your name?” As I said it, I wasn’t sure if she had a name, but also worried about the name she might say. 

She sat in thought for a moment. I could see the wheels turning. This was a difficult question and clearly not one she expected me to ask. Eventually she replied, “Don’t know…what name… was. They…call me…E.A.L. 4. I call me…Elle.” I wasn’t sure if the name she gave was just referring to the letter, but I could hear the sadness in her croaking voice. Then another thought struck me. E.A.L.4. Elizabeth Anne LaFleur? Was that meant to be my initials? And the number 4? As if she was reading my mind, Elle held up her arm and drew my gaze to her wrist. She was still wearing the hospital band—faded, worn, and identical to the one I’d once had. Lafleur, Elizabeth. Admitted: February 6, 2019. And just beneath that, in small print: E.A.L.4. 

Elle had given me something invaluable. I never noticed that print on my bracelet. The police had removed it and stored it in evidence the night I made my statement. If mine had a number…. I found myself praying that if it did, that it would be the number one. I needed to get that back, and there was only one person I could trust to help me. I had to call Mark. 

This was easier said than done. I knew Mark had been recovering, but I had no idea what had happened to him since that night. I wasn’t fully clear on his shooting, either, but I could guess enough of those details. I knew Nichole would object, so I said nothing, stowing this thought for a later time. I refocused on Elle. She seemed eager to give us answers or maybe just eager to have someone to talk to.

“How did you escape from that place?” I asked. Elle shifted through emotions as she prepared to answer – from pensive concentration to what may have been triumph. “Training room. Knife…on table…for pro…procedure,” she struggled with the last word, wincing. It was only then that I realized it wasn’t cognitive ability making her speech stilted. Speaking was painful. I felt another wave of empathy for her, and part of me wanted to stop. Making her talk hurt her, but she continued anyway. “But it was… test. For me. How good…control,” she paused, taking a deep breath, then “They think,” she pointed to her head, “dumb. I hear. I…know.” She seemed to be finished, and I was trying to unravel her story.

“So, you were in a room. To train?” I asked and she nodded. “They left a knife…near enough for you to grab it?” She nodded again, but I was unsure I grasped the next part. “They were testing your intelligence? By leaving a knife?” She shook her head vigorously.

“Test was…control. Me. Under control. Take knife…Not controlled. I took knife,” she clarified, and I could see it play out – their hubris. They must have placed Elle in a situation to see if she would try to escape. Or to orchestrate both our escapes entirely. *Why? Did they not realize that putting a weapon in Elle’s hand would spell death for everyone there? They made her. Didn’t they know she was capable of that?* The next question I asked aloud, “Did you know they were letting us escape?” She cocked her head to the side for a second, considering. “Not know. Thought…later…when followed.”

“They were following you? You still have a tracker?!” the distress in my voice was evident. My eyes darted around the room, to the timid boy, to Nichole, and then out the window as if, even now, danger might be approaching. Elle waved a hand to regain my attention. “No. See? I… cut out.” She swiveled and pulled up her sheet of hair to reveal a jagged and ugly scar running vertically up the middle of her neck. I swallowed hard but felt the adrenaline ebb. It was Aaron that spoke next.

“Wh..What are you?” he sounded half fascinated, half revolted. Elle only shrugged. Nichole had a more definitive answer. “A chimera. It was project name…This was another side venture for the aspiring Dr. Mengele,” she said, and it looked as if the words tasted bitter. “It’s when they would use a…less than perfect clone…for additional experimentation. A person that had more than one set of human DNA. The main project was to perfect duplicates so they could replace certain people in positions of power. This one was said to be to create new soldiers…But I think they were all…twisted.”

“You never said that before. Back at the motel. If the project was for replacements, why me? I’m nobody. Why did you have a double?” I asked Nichole, feeling another note of betrayal. She didn’t tell me *everything*.

“You had a double?!” Aaron asked, his voice cracking. His posture switched from uncertain hovering to taught and defensive. Nichole had the look of one caught in the act, and she lowered the gun for the first time since Elle’s arrival. She searched for the words, quietly, opened her mouth, shut it, and thought some more. Aaron was glaring at his sister, the sting of this secret so clear – and so familiar. Nichole finally said, “Yes. I did.”

She obviously wanted to drop the subject there and move on, but Aaron pressed her further. “Why? Where is she now? And WHY didn’t you tell me?” He had taken a few steps closer in his furious questioning. This would have been tantamount to an act of war if I or Elle had done it, but Nichole allowed it from him. She sighed, letting her head fall back, looking at the ceiling, groaning in frustration and then resigned to having to explain.

“They said it was two-fold. They made doubles of us – both the original and the alters would be aware of every step. It was the control group – a way to compare willing participants to the unwilling. The second was to help ensure the secrecy of the project. My double was trained – brainwashed – so that if I made any…transgressions against them, she would neutralize me and ultimately take my place. There would be no missing person, no investigation.” Nichole rubbed her temples and squeezed her eyes shut for a moment. Aaron stood, mouth hanging in shock.

“So, I could have lost you and never known?” Aaron asked, more like a lost little boy than ever. Nichole opened her eyes and looked pitifully at him. She nodded.

“She…The… MY double…” Nichole started, fumbling the words. “She’s dead.” Her eyes flickered to me. “She died on a…nasty mission. A mission I refused. I… didn’t want you to know… I thought you would hate me if you found out how…complicit I had been. And how long I was part of all of it before getting out.”

“I don’t hate you,” Aaron said, but there was still doubt in his voice. He glanced at me, then briefly to Elle, then landed back on Nichole. “That’s why they killed Mom? You never…I guessed it was something… I mean… You think I’d blame you for… Mom?” Nichole looked pleadingly at her brother, silently begging forgiveness. He took a step toward her, a shooting a trepid look at Elle once more, and then, “It’s not your fault. You did some bad stuff, but not that. You saved me. And her.” He inclined his head towards me. “Can’t be all bad, right?” I wasn’t sure if he was trying to convince her or himself, but she wiped the few runaway tears and nodded, but not quite meeting his eyes.

Elle had taken all this in as stoically as a statue. She appeared unmoved by Nichole’s confession or the conversation that followed, but now seemed slightly agitated, wanting to get back to the core of the previous discussion. Her next words were louder, defensive, looking directly at Nichole, “I…am not…monster.” Something of what was revealed touched a nerve and I understood that Elle did not want to be perceived as some lab created creature they unleashed upon the world. Nichole was shaken – her gaze unwavering from Elle. “Maybe… Maybe you aren’t,” she shuddered as a sob broke through, “But maybe… I am.” The silence following was heavy, dripping with everything left to be said. Nichole regretted the awful things she had done, but, even if she wasn’t sure, I knew. She *was* a monster. She did save me, but that doesn’t change what had already happened. I could easily hate her, but I didn’t. I saw a mirror image not just in Elle – what more experiments might have done to me – but in Nichole. If they had had me longer, wouldn’t they have brainwashed me, too? Would I have been any more than a cog in the machine? I saw these two branches of what my future could have been, and it made my blood run cold.

“There…are…others.” Elle announced, breaking through the wall of quiet. “
