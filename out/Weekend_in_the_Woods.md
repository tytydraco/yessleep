It was a great day. It really was. It started off that way, anyway. I'm sure I remember. But, now? Now... it is not a great day. I love going hiking, I really do. But, suddenly? I'm not having fun anymore. 

We've gone to our cabin in the woods before. Many, many times... that I can remember. It's always been fun. Always. The scenery, the wildlife, the fresh air... always. But, now? 

It's getting dark, and I'm alone. I'm not even sure how I ended up here. It smells weird, and everything looks the same, but also... different. Something isn't right. I feel it. Wait...

Where's James? I know he was with me just a minute ago. I know this, I remember. Get it together, you're losing focus. James. I have to find James. Stand up. 

My head, my leg, I feel pain. This is the road... I'm on the side of the road. There's blood on me. I'm hurt and James is gone and I don't know where I am. Start walking. 

He wouldn't have left me here, he must be close. Something must have happened... I can't remember. Noise and lights coming toward me. Bright lights hurts my eyes. Truck. Start running. 

It's not James. The lights pass right by, they don't see me. I call out, and they don't hear me. I'm alone. It's dark now, and I'm alone. Except, I'm not... there's something moving in the woods. Run faster.

Wait. Maybe that's James... maybe he needs my help. Maybe he's hurt too. I call out, and something moves deeper into the woods. Is he playing with me? James! 

We've been together for a while. I remember... it took some time for me to trust again, but James had earned it. He took care of me, and I took care of him. Try to remember. He didn't leave me. I was with him, and then... I wasn't. Darkness in between. It didn't make sense.

Head hurts. Try to focus. Another light flashes. Brighter, louder, faster. Panic. Someone is after me... and it's not James. A strange voice calls out to me. A word I have never heard and do not understand. Run, now.

Into the woods. I'm safer here than on the road. Whatever happened to me and James, happened back there. Just run. Grass, leaves, trees. Twigs snap beneath my feet. Branches scrape across my face. I close my eyes, put my head down, and run. 

Wait. Turn around. No one is chasing you. Breathe now, inspect your wounds. Pain returns. Heart pounds. It's really dark now. Strange sounds, unfamiliar scents. Blood has dried. A twig snaps behind me. James?

Something is watching me, and it's not James. That smell. I freeze. Hair stands on end. Another twig snaps. I call out, trying to scare away whatever creature is lurking. It works. I am alone, again. 

Our cabin must be close by. I'm sure I remember. I inhale deeply, my pupils dilate. I know these woods. There are others in these woods. James told me about them... told me not to trust them. The others may even look like me, but they aren't like me.

I keep my eyes open wide, and I move cautiously. I hear a scream in the distance. No sleep tonight. I am limping now. The air is cold and the ground is hard. This is not where I belong. I am not safe. Nothing is right. I feel it. 

The trees are moving. I'm hungry. I'm thirsty. I'm tired. I'm scared. But... I have to keep walking. I have to find the cabin. I have to find James. I can't let the others see me. I can't let the others catch me. I don't know what happens if they do, but James says I don't want to find out. Keep walking. 

Something sharp on the ground hurts my foot. I yelp out in pain. That was a mistake. Another scream, much closer this time. And another. And another. The others. They know I'm here. They're coming for me. Run. 

I think the cabin is this way. I hope the cabin is this way. Once I get closer, I'm sure I'll remember. I'll know. Just, run. Don't turn around. Something is chasing you. 

Can't call for James. The others will hear me. Can't hide. The others will find me. I have to keep running, and hope they don't catch me. I have to keep running, as long as my leg lets me. Leaves rustle beside me. Sticks break behind me. 

The screams are all around me now. The smell is overpowering. Driving me further and further away from the cabin. Further and further away from James. I know it. I feel it. 

The others had heard my cry. They smell my blood. They sense my fear. They're coming. If only I could remember how I got here. I can't keep running. I can't escape. Focus. There is only one option left. 

Stop running. Turn around. Try to breathe... you're surrounded. Keep your eyes open wide, pupils dilated. Muscles tense. Teeth clenched. They may look like you, but they aren't like you. Heart pounding. Hair stands on end. 

The others appear in front of me. Behind me. On all sides of me. They aren't like me... they're bigger. I cannot move. I cannot breathe. I want to tell them to leave me alone, but I know they won't listen. If James were here, he would protect me. But, he's not here. I'm alone. Surrounded, and alone. 

A bright light flashes. A dark figure appears. It's running towards me. I freeze. It's getting closer. Heart pounds. Hair stands on end. A loud bang. The others run away. This is it. 

The bright light hurts my eyes. The dark figure is right in front of me now. It calls to me. A word I know... I understand. Pupils constrict. Inhale, exhale. James. James. I fall into his arms, and he cries. He hugs me. He hugs me harder than he's ever hugged me before. It hurts my head , but I don't care. 

I'm home now. Home with James again, where I belong. My wounds are dressed and my belly is full. The air is warm and the ground is soft. I'm safe. I'm not alone. No pain. Everything is right. I feel it. I know it. I remember. 

James says I fell from the truck. He doesn't know how. He went back to look for me, but I was gone. He says he's so sorry, and I forgive him. He didn't mean for our weekend in the woods to go this way. I knew he wouldn't have left me. He says it will never happen again, and I believe him. 

I curl up next to James in our bed. He scratches my head, and I close my eyes as he softly says my favorite word. 

Goodboy.
