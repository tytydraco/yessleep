I'm a single dad to my lovely daughter, Ava. She celebrated her birthday last week. I decided to surprise her with a pretty doll she had been eyeing at the local shop.  
  
She named it Daisy. Daisy had beautiful brown hair, wearing a sweet pink dress with cute little shoes. For the first few days, Daisy was Ava's best friend. They would eat together, sleep together, and even have small tea parties.  
  
Things began to change after a few days. One night, Ava came to my room, shaken. She said Daisy was watching her. I comforted her, saying it was just a doll with glass eyes, nothing more.  
  
Next day, a new chapter of horror opened. Ava cried that Daisy had moved on its own. I furrowed my brows. I told her it was just her imagination. Ava looked disappointed, but I saw fear in her eyes.  
  
Days passed. Things became chilling. I started noticing Daisy wasn't where we'd left her. She was in different places every time - on the dinner table, near the bathroom, sitting on the couch. Each time, the doll's gaze felt more piercing, almost like it was staring at us.  
  
One day, we found Daisy in Ava's school bag when we hadn't put her in. A chill ran down my spine. Ava's face went pale. She stammered, “Daisy didn't want me to go to school alone.”  
  
The incidents amplified my fear. I decided to put Daisy in the attic. Ava didn't protest.  
  
I was hoping things would get back to normal. But after a couple of days, Ava woke me up again saying she heard Daisy talking. By now, I was genuinely scared. I went to the attic with Ava. Daisy was sitting just where I had left her.  
  
To prove Ava wrong, I picked up Daisy and demanded, “Do something. Walk. Or talk!” But it was just a silent doll in my hands.  
  
The next day, returning home from work, the most horrifying sight awaited me. Daisy was sitting on the living room couch. My heart raced. I had locked her in the attic. How was she here? I grabbed the doll and locked it in the trunk of my car.  
  
That night we had the first peaceful sleep in weeks. But the peace was short-lived. Early morning, Ava woke me up. She whispered, "Daddy, Daisy is back."  
  
I hoped she was dreaming. But her face was pale white with fear. I walked into her room and felt my blood freeze. Daisy was there, lying beside her on the bed.  
  
I felt terror like never before. I grabbed Daisy and decided to burn her. This nightmare had to end. I started a bonfire in the backyard, threw Daisy in it, and watched it burn. Ava watched from the window, silent.  
  
That night, Ava slept in my arms. We both needed comfort. Just as we were dozing off, we heard it - a soft sing-song voice, "Daddy, why did you burn me?"  
  
We both sat up, terrified. In the soft glow of the night lamp, we saw something that froze our blood. Daisy, slightly burnt, stood there on Ava's bedpost, staring at us with empty glass eyes.  
  
Soon after this, we moved to a new town, leaving behind every piece of old life, especially Daisy. But even today, when all is quiet, Ava and I shudder thinking of those glass eyes and that sing-song voice, "Daddy, why did you burn me?"
