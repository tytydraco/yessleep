a 23 year old man named Dan was on a late night walk, he felt a chill down his spine however he thought nothing of it so he just kept walking, soon after walking for about 5 minutes it hit him, something was following him he heard the footsteps, it sounded like very long slender legs, he wasn't sure what it was, he looked behind him, there was nothing there, he thought he was confused, he could've swore he heard foot steps? maybe he was imagining it, he kept walking because there was a small Cafe up ahead, soon he felt it again... those long slender legs steps..... he didn't look back this time, he ran and ran and ran, as he ran the footsteps were louder, he kept running until eventually the footsteps stopped, he kept running and eventually saw the cafe, he entered the Cafe and there were so many wanted posters on the wall he never even knew existed, he's been to this Cafe allot since this is a small town and he grew up in it, he asks the lady at the cash register what it was about, he's never seen any of them before, she said "haven't you heard? there's been a huge increase in killings this past week" he didn't know about any of that, but then he remembered someone was following him, he knew he must've been in trouble and was glad he ran, he orders a coffee and waits for a while (he has a night time job as a security guard)



1:38 AM


Dan thought it would be fine to leave and go back to his home now (30 minute walk), he leaves and thanks the cashier for letting him stay for over a hour, as he gets closer to his house he hears it again... the footsteps got closer and closer... he ignored them... he has to be imagining it?.... right???.... until he was about 10 minutes from his house he felt breathing on his neck.... Dan was terrified... he couldn't move he was so scared... his body was shaking and couldn't move at the same time...he turns his head and sees it.... a man ATLEAST 8 foot tall...with a smile on his face.... a smile so sharp it could pierce your soul....the man had makeup on? or something  like that.... wait?.... is it.... a mime?? a clown??? he saw a knife in the mans hand...Dan didn't even think, he ran and ran.
he finally made it home...he locked every door and window, he hears it... it's banging on his door, he gets his phone and hides in closet trying to call the cops.



911:"911 what's your emergency?"

dan:" a man was following me home... he had a knife and is banging on my door...please send help... I'm begging you... my address is *BEEP*"

911:"officers are on they're way."

911:"what's your name?"

dan:"i-i-it's dan..."

911:"okay dan stay on the line with me, they should be there in 5 minutes"

*glass breaks*

dan:"SHIT..... SHIT SHIT SHIT.... HES HERE... ITS HERE ITS IN MY HOUSE!!"

911:"okay dan..Dan... stay calm... officers will be there in 2 more minutes, keep your voice down" 


1 minute later


dan:"I hear it... it's coming upstairs...."

911:"stay quiet dan... if you even say a word it will hear you"

30 seconds later


*banging can be heard with a sharp laugh and gushing noises aswell as dan screaming*

911:"DAN? DAN? DAN ARE YOU THERE?"

*room goes quiet*

???:"Dan's not coming" *psychotic laughing*


911:"what?... who are you? what happend to dan?.."




officers arrive 30 seconds after this happends

in 30 seconds that... that thing... killed a man...
nothing, nothing is found except for dans phone, a broken glass window, and some blood scattered throughout the house, they test the blood and it is confirmed to be Dan's blood, after that night nothing anything like that has happend, they believe it was a murder that was fast, planned, and random... why would anyone do that to someone randomly.....no... no one would... a monster would... that's who... that was no human that did that to dan.... it was a monster... a cold blooded....monster.... and that is Dan's last night alive....
