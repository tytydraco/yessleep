They called us the lab rats. Three kids conceived in a lab, born in a lab, and raised in a lab, only existing to be pawns in an illegal science experiment. Although I suppose illegal may not be the right word for it- can the government do something illegal, or is it okay because they're the ones who make the laws? 

This information, and my existence in general, is heavily classified. Only a few people even know I still exist; well, I guess more people will soon. 

My name is Subject 406, named after my time of birth. The other lab rats were 403 and 410. I was the middle kid, younger by three minutes and older by four. I always thought that Alex would've been a lovely name for me, but I was never allowed to be called that. 

What was the False God Experiment? Well, that's a good question. I'm still not entirely sure. From my understanding, a group of archaeologists discovered an idol from ancient runes in South America; a long since extinct group of people, worshipping a God nobody had ever heard of before. Below the idol, words were inscribed. Translated, it roughly meant:

*He who prays to the false god will face the wrath of horrors unearthly.* 

They were incredibly curious as to who this false god was, and who wrote this warning. Upon further exploration of the runes, they discovered many rituals and shrines to the false god, and came to the conclusion this ancient civilization once prayed to the false god, and faced whatever horrors they warned us against. 

The only question was, what horrors? 

That's where we came in. Three children, born specifically as sacrifices to whatever horrors we were about to face, raised to perform ancient rituals to pray to our false god. 

For as long as I can remember that's all I knew. We woke up. We ate stale bread as we prepared an elaborate meal for the false god. We prayed in front of his statue. We gave him an offering. Then, at night, we'd be taken into a dark room to perform the ritual. Then we'd be put to sleep, to wake up again. 

The ritual scared me when I was little. The room was dark, safe for the glowing eyes of our false god. The statue was scary. It depicted the false god, sitting on a throne made of thousands of hands holding him up. He had sharp, inhuman claws and above his glowing red eyes were long deer-like horns. In order to perform the ritual, we were to draw a small amount of blood from our hands and smear it onto his throne. Then, we were to close our eyes and chant and pray. We were only to be allowed out when the scientists opened the door we could never figure out how to get open from the inside. 

It was scary. But it was all we knew. The artificial sandy houses we lived in to replicate Latin America that suddenly cut into all white modern walls when you reached the laboratory. The stale bread.

And the false god. 

For a while, he scared all of us. When we prayed to him, we used to pray that he would never hurt us, because we were so terrified of his everglowing presence. But one day, we were about 7 (I don't know how old we were, or even how old I am now. This is my best guess.) subject 403 became ill. We don't know how- our lab was supposed to be quarantined. But since we had weak immune systems from being raised in a sterile laboratory, 403 was not doing well. Because of this, Dr. Milov, the head scientist of this experiment, suggested something to 410 and I.

"Perhaps if you pray extra hard and prepare him a fantastic offering, he will heal subject 403!" He said to us through his observation window.

We were still frightened of the false god, but looking at 403's condition, we really had no other choice, as we knew the scientists would let them die if they had to. They didn't care about us. 

The next day, we put extra care into his offering. I had never worked so hard in my life. As we placed it down in front of the false god's statue, we prayed, for the first time not just for him not to hurt us, but for him to protect us. To heal subject 403 from their ailments and ensure all of our safety from whatever 403 caught. I even drew a little bit of extra blood from my hand during that night's ritual just to be sure. 

The next day, subject 403 had miraculously recovered and was completely back to normal.

"It's a wonder, boss! Subject 403 has been subjected to such strong suggestion, they induced a placebo effect in themselves! The false god experiment is really working!" I overheard a scientist say. 

Subject 410 and I exchanged glances. From then on, we began to look at our false god differently. 

He showed us what nobody had shown us before; safety. It seemed our prayers had been answered. I recall a time a small fire had started in the laboratory- nobody was killed, but some equipment was destroyed and a few scientists suffered mild burns. Our wing was the only one left completely untouched. Another time, the laboratory kitchen became infected with E.Coli, and all of the scientists became ill. Despite 403, 410 and I consuming food contained in the same kitchen, we remained healthy. 

We became attached to him. He was the first being I remembered feeling love for. 

It didn't take long for us to begin praying to the false god more. We would pray for better food. The scientists would decide to feed us a full meal instead of our regular bread. We would pray for longer sleep. We would all wake up fully rested. The better offering, the more blood drawn, the better it worked. However, we soon began abusing this newfound power. 

Dr. Milov was a bad man. Most of the scientists didn't necessarily care about us, but it seemed this man had pure disdain for us. He would verbally abuse us, and in extreme cases he would even beat us. 

So, we did what we knew we should. That night, we all cut a deep cut into our palms and smeared it onto the false god's stone throne. I cut so deeply it was still bleeding in the morning. We then prayed for him to give Dr. Milov what he deserved.

We didn't see him again after that. Freak accident on the drive to the laboratory. 

That night, we were given the news the False God Experiment was to be defunct in a short while. I tried to protest, but was shut up.

"But what will happen to god?" Subject 410 asked. 

"There is no god, 410!" A scientist snapped at us. "You have been praying to nothing. We have led you astray, and there is nothing coming to save you. Your last night here is tonight." 

From what we heard that night, in the morning, we were to be executed. They didn't want the public to find out about this experiment, and if killing us prevented their secret from coming out, that's what they would do. 

That night, we devised a plan. One last prayer to our false god, one shot in the dark to save our lives. We drew more blood than ever before and gave him the strongest prayer we've ever done. Please, save us. Please. No matter what it takes.  

For a while, nothing happened. We were distraught. Was our god really false? 

But then, we heard a loud noise. Alarms in the laboratory began going off, and suddenly scientists were all around us. They tried to detain us, but somehow, they couldn't go near us. Strong winds began blowing, and the scientists were all lifted into the air. 

Suddenly, something appeared from the sky. From his dark body, to his glowing eyes, to his long antlers, 403, 410 and I knew who it was. 

The false god. 

He stared down at all of us. The scientists had a look of terror on their faces. 

All of a sudden*, He who prays to the false god will face the wrath of horrors unearthly,* took on a new meaning. 

Our god was not the false god after all. 

We watched as all of the scientists around us faced unearthly horrors, and us three children were protected by an unseen force. After all of the carnage was over, we stared up at god. He gave us a look of understanding, before placing his large hand gently on each of our foreheads one by one. Then, he disappeared.

That was years ago. It was obviously covered up by the government. I still live in a secret base location. Not much is new. I will say, however, accident after accident in our base has occurred, yet I and two other patients have remained unharmed. 

And as we bandage up our hands for what seems like the thousandth time tonight, we reach this question out to you: 

*Who have you been praying to?*
