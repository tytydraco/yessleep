I don’t tell this story often. Mostly because I hate reliving it, but also because when you try to explain something like this, people smile politely, maybe even laugh it off. But I know what I heard. I know what I saw. And God help me, I know what’s still out there.

It was late October when Eric and I decided to go camping in Blackwood Forest. We wanted to get away - no phones, no city noise, just miles of trees and sky. Blackwood had a reputation for being remote, untouched, and… other things, though we didn’t pay much attention to the stories. Stories about strange disappearances and “voices” were just campfire fodder, or so we thought.

The hike in was uneventful, beautiful even. The trail wove between towering pines that stretched like ancient sentinels toward the sky, their branches forming a canopy that muted the sunlight. By the time we found a clearing and pitched our tent, the world was steeped in twilight. Everything was bathed in this eerie orange glow, the kind that makes shadows seem longer and darker than they should be.

We built a fire, drank a couple of beers, and talked about nothing important. It was quiet, too quiet. At first, we chalked it up to the forest being remote, but looking back, the stillness was unnatural. No rustling leaves, no distant owl calls. Just the crackle of the fire and our own voices.

As night fell, the silence seemed to thicken, pressing in around us. It was the kind of quiet that makes you hyper-aware of every sound, your breathing, the occasional pop of a log in the fire. When we crawled into the tent, I remember saying something like, “At least it’s peaceful,” but Eric didn’t respond. He just stared into the trees, his face pale as snow. I should’ve asked him what he saw.

I woke up hours later to the sound of footsteps.

At first, I thought it was Eric moving around, but then I realized the steps were outside the tent. Slow, deliberate, crunching through the dead leaves. They circled us, pausing every so often before resuming their measured pace. I lay there, my pulse pounding in my ears, trying to convince myself it was just an animal. A deer, maybe. A fox.

But then the steps stopped.

And something spoke.

“Jonathan… Eric…”

It wasn’t loud, but the voice carried, slipping through the tent walls like smoke. It was soft and sing-song, the way you might call to a child who was lost.

I froze. My mouth went dry, and for a second I convinced myself I’d imagined it. But then Eric whispered, “You heard that, right?”

I nodded, though he couldn’t see me in the dark.

The voice came again, closer this time. “Come out and plaaay…”

There was a lilting quality to the words, like it was enjoying itself. I wanted to move, to grab the flashlight, to do something, but my body wouldn’t obey. My skin prickled, every instinct screaming that whatever was out there wasn’t human.

Then the scratching started.

It was faint at first, a soft drag of nails against fabric. It started low, near the base of the tent, then traveled upward, slow and deliberate. The sound was maddening, like whoever, or whatever, it was, wanted us to know it was there.

Eric grabbed the flashlight, his hand trembling so badly the beam wobbled across the tent walls. “We’ve got to go,” he whispered, his voice shaking.

“No,” I hissed back. “We don’t know what’s out there.”

He didn’t answer. He just unzipped the tent in one frantic motion, and before I could stop him, he was gone, the flashlight bouncing as he bolted into the darkness.

For a second, I was paralyzed, caught between the safety of the tent and the terror of what lay outside. But then something slammed into the tent, hard enough to knock me sideways. The walls caved inward, and I scrambled out, my breath hitching as I hit the cold night air.

The forest was a maze of shadows. The moon barely pierced the canopy, and the trees looked… wrong. Their trunks were gnarled, their branches twisted into unnatural shapes, like skeletal hands reaching toward me. The air smelled sharp, metallic, like blood.

I heard Eric screaming.

It wasn’t a normal scream. It was guttural, broken, the sound of someone being ripped apart. It came from deeper in the woods, and every instinct told me to run the other way. But I couldn’t leave him. I took a step, then another, my legs shaking so badly I thought they’d give out.

“Eric?” I called, my voice barely more than a whisper.

The laughter started then.

It was faint at first, a low chuckle that seemed to come from everywhere. But it grew louder, more distorted, until it was a chorus of voices, overlapping and echoing. Some were high-pitched and manic, others low and guttural, like growls.

I turned, and that’s when I saw it.

At first, it was just a shape in the darkness - a pale smudge against the black. But as it stepped into the moonlight, I felt my stomach drop. Its limbs were too long, its skin stretched tight over jagged bones. Its face was… wrong. The eyes were hollow pits, and its mouth was an impossible grin, the teeth jagged and uneven.

It tilted its head, watching me. Then it spoke.

“Jonathan,” it whispered, and the sound was like needles sliding into my brain. “Don’t you want to see your friend?”

I didn’t think. I just ran.

The forest seemed to shift around me, the trees bending and twisting, their roots clawing at my feet. The laughter followed, growing louder, closer, until it was in my ears, in my head. I didn’t look back, not even when I heard the heavy crunch of footsteps right behind me.

When I burst onto the trail and saw my car, I nearly sobbed. I threw myself inside, locking the doors and jamming the key into the ignition. The engine roared to life, and I floored it, gravel spraying as I sped down the dirt road.

But as I glanced in the rearview mirror, I saw it.

Standing at the edge of the forest, its head tilted, its grin stretched impossibly wide. And as the car disappeared into the distance, I swear I saw it wave.

They never found Eric. The search teams said there was no sign of him, no sign of us ever being there. But sometimes, late at night, when the world is quiet, I hear it again - soft and teasing, just outside my window.
