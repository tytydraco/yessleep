I’m still really unsure about the things I’ve seen, but I do know there are others who have seen it now. Did a little digging and found some random message boards suggesting a ‘Demo” like a first attempt at humanity. Except now I’m finding out that visitors to the Demo don’t end up sticking around long after they return.

From the few threads I’ve seen, and bear with me- I’m fucking homeless and using library computers- the few of us who went in and made it back all had somewhat similar experiences. Emptier, more low-res version of their surroundings at the time, and a voice luring them closer before glitching out on them. Most ran, and everyone assumes there were plenty more people who didn’t get away, but everyone who found a way out says it was by complete accident. No mention of anyone in a mask, Sloth or otherwise. I appeared to be an isolated incident.

There wasn’t even a common theme in how they got there in the first place. Things were seemingly at random, whether it was just a random doorway while urban exploring or just being in the wrong place at the wrong time. One person described their experience just falling through the floor one day, emerging in the Demo version of their school. I couldn’t find any correlation, even among the small handful of people who had shared their stories.

I just found out one thing that’s consistent between all of us though, and I’m not sure how much time I’m going to have left. The glitch followed me. Others mentioned some strange happenings, seeing glitches in real life, technology acting strange, and a feeling that there was something watching them, waiting. I’ve felt that since the first encounter, just a few days ago but I feel like my heart is still racing. Mechanical, constant screams echo in my head, static building on my skin like wearing a fleece coat fresh from a dryer. Except not comforting at all, leaving me with cold sweats.

I stayed in the library overnight to avoid the rain and damp outside. I hadn’t been myself the past couple of days, pushing everyone away who tried to check on me. EMS told me I was a damn hero for pushing Phoebe out of the way, so why do I feel like I’m being hunted? I did a good deed, right? That deserves some sort of reward, you would think, not a fucking curse.

Everything settled in the library around midnight or so, with workers librarians, and janitors finishing up their duties. Years of experience taught me where to hide and avoid anyone checking around, though the janitor was extra thorough tonight for some reason. Must be an event or something tomorrow.

I curled up on one of the couches set aside for reading, nestled in one of the back corners where a small light cast shadows. It was comforting, one of the only places I’ve ever known that felt like home. Guess that’s why I finally ended up drifting off to sleep, but it was only minutes before things got weird.

A loud series of thumps from a few aisles down, books hitting the floor in quick succession. Pages were turning like a hurricane was blowing right through, threatening to tear them apart. In the shadows I could see the shelf wavering, ready to topple over at the force before a figure emerged, gliding from the aisle like a damn ghost. It turned, looking toward me. The same, small child I saw in the Demo was standing there, a faint glow coming from it as the sneering, plastered on face focused in on me. Then that loud, mechanical scream again, like voices sounding out briefly before being silenced, becoming a chorus of glitching, digital hell.

My reaction time was much better, maybe because I knew where I was or because I didn’t have the initial shock at whatever this damned thing was. When the Glitch started moving toward me, bending and stretching like gravity was tearing it apart at the seams, I took off down another aisle.

Well, that pissed it off apparently, because it started getting even louder, the storm of gravity around it pulling everywhere. Where to go or what to do were secondary in my mind to just get the fuck out of here. I ran the maze of aisles, judging where the Glitch was by the tornado it was whipping up. Whoever came in there to clean in the morning was probably pissed, but when I came back this afternoon everything was in place. Whether it was the work of all the employees or another bit of the Demo’s fuckery, I have no idea.

I’m ahead of things again, sorry. At some point it occurred to me that this thing wasn’t just going to go away. It meant I was going to be out on the streets in the rain, but it was better than what the Glitch might do to me. I still don’t know what the hell it would do, and tbh I’m not keen on finding out. Took me a second to look around, figure out where I was, and make a break for the doors. 

The adrenaline is what I’m blaming for this one, because it totally escaped my mind that the damn doors are locked. Not my smartest moment, I know, but something worked out for me anyway. I dashed through the detectors that kept the doors separate from the rest of the library, hitting the doors themselves HARD. I was still bruised from that truck hitting me, so hitting the metal push bars was incredibly unpleasant to put it lightly. 

I was scrambling once I realized they were locked, and the Glitch was screaming like a dial-up modem in a fucking blender behind me. It was almost on me and I still wasn’t able to get the top deadbolt undone, my hands slippery with sweat while trying to pull the old, rusting lockout.

The Glitch charged at me then, mouth wide in a smile that looked like it was going to chomp down on me. It hit the detectors set up to prevent weapons from being brought in, suddenly compressing down to a small singularity as the parts of it stretching in every direction were absorbed, infinitely folding itself into oblivion before it could pass through the other side. Wasn’t stopping me from getting the hell out of here though. I finally fumbled the deadbolt open and burst through the doors faster than the devil running from a church. I ran maybe four blocks before I finally stopped to catch my breath, a few other pedestrians on the street giving me an odd look.

Found an alley to curl up in that was somewhat dry. It wasn’t easy to fall asleep, though, with me on constant high alert thinking it could appear again at any point. Not to mention my mind fucking running marathons trying to figure out what made it disappear. I’m hoping I can figure it out to keep myself alive, at least. God, I’ve been just surviving for so long that I kind of forgot what it feels like to actually be relieved to be alive. 

Thinking about it, writing it all out now, when it hit the metal detectors it was almost instantly done for. Whether it killed it or just sent it back to the Demo is a whole other thing entirely, but there’s something there…

Oh fuck. Magnets. Holy shit why didn’t that click earlier? They’re digital, everything looked like it was from old, digital media discs. I still remember when my dad got mad at me as a kid and decided a “punishment” was taking my copy of Final Fantasy VII to a refrigerator magnet. Still never got to the final disc after all this time, but I guess he got karma since he fucking died a few weeks later. Maybe you shouldn’t have drunk and driven, Robert. 

Sorry, little trauma dumping. I ended up falling asleep in the alley until about noon when it became too uncomfortable. The sun was hitting the trash back there just right to really bake some old dairy. Made my way back to the library instead to scour the internet more, maybe find some answers, and write all this up.

I think I need to find the Sloth. He definitely wasn’t a part of that world, with much more clearly human features even just by his build. Until then I’m going to see if I can swipe a few magnets from the library desk. If anything I might be able to find the stuff to make a small electromagnet. Maybe I can find something lying around the trash. Until then, I’m definitely not sleeping here, so guess it’s back out on the street along with all the other [American strays](https://www.reddit.com/user/googlyeyes93/comments/1efyman/strays_chapter_masterlist/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
