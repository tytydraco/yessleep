I'm standing in the dark.

That's it.

Just standing.

I thought there would be more.

But there's nothing.



I revel in it.

Revel in the blackness, the numbness.

Heavy.

Solid.

It sits on me like a weight.

I rest in its folds.

Wrapped in its embrace.

A blanket of comfort.

A mantle of security.

It surrounds me.

It's a part of me.

I'm a part of it.

We are the same.

I've been here forever.

I won't ever leave.

It is all I know.

All I desire.



Suddenly, I'm blinded.

I shut my eyes.

Yearning for the darkness.

My senses bombarded.

Minutes pass.

I open, seeing again.

Seeing.

There is light around me.

I hasten back to the dark.

But it scurries away.

I try again.

Running to my haven.

It eludes me still.

I yell in frustration.

Why has it abandoned me?

I was safe in its cover.

I look down.

My hands shake.

They appear alien to me.

In their grasp is the source.

I feel it.

Cold.

Smooth.

Bright.

The bulb lets off its sickly yellow glow.

Chasing my darkness away.

I yearn for the dark.

Yearn for the way it shut me off from the world.

The way it held me in its embrace.

The unfeeling glass has taken it all away from me.

Taken the dark away with its repulsive beam.

I hear the blackness whispering.

*Come back to me.*

It purrs.

It opens its arms.

Invites me in.

I can't pry my eyes away.

The bulb rests in my hands.

My fingers touch the cold metal base.

There's no cords.

No wires.

It shouldn't be working.

It shouldn't be glowing.

Yet it is.

The power comes from me.

Shining from within.

The darkness creeps.

Challenging the edges of the light.

Probing.

Prodding.

Wanting its captive back.

But I can't.

I won't.

I won't give up this gift.

I won't surrender to its calls.

*I miss you* it says.

*I need you* it pleads.

I taste poison dripping from its honey voice.

I don't move.

It grows bold.

**You belong to me**.

It bellows from everywhere at once.

It's deep and carnal.

I feel it more than hear it.

The darkness wails.

Desperate fingers grasp at my ankles.

Trying to pull me back.

To trap me again.

Its lonely prison.

It knows me.

Knows where I hurt.

My light flickers.

The darkness grins.

It licks its lips.

**You are nothing.**

My light dims.

My sphere of safety shrinks.

Blackness gets closer and closer.

A deep chuckle echoes around me.

I can feel it salivating.

It's right in front of me.

It's all around me.

All consuming.

Inescapable.

My head spins.

My breath grows quick.

I feel constricted.

Panic grips my heart.

No.

I can't.

Not again.

I won't make it.

Not this time.

I feel it breathe down my neck.

It has me.

**You are alone.**

But I am not alone.

This thought strikes a chord.

A sweeping melody from deep in my heart.

I have my light.

It's barely holding on.

Hardly visible.

The darkness starts to ease it from my hands.

It caresses my cheek.

It tells me I'm okay.

To let go.

I almost listen.

I almost give up.

But I see that little bulb try.

Try to stand against the impossible.

Pushing against the virulent darkness.

I can't let it do that alone.

I hold up my light.

I hold it up high.

Its glow is dim.

But it does not flicker.

The darkness laughs at the pathetic attempt.

**Look at you** it sneers.

**So weak and afraid**.

But I look at my light.

And I feel warm.

It's a new feeling.

It grows.

Spreads.

To my chest.

To my toes.

The blackness recedes from around me.

It hisses.

Screams.

Tears at the space in front of me with its sharp claws.

I imagine them sinking back into my flesh.

Like they had for so long.

I can't be scared.

But I am.

I know what it's like.

To be in their clutches.

**You are worthless.**

Wind shrieks past me.

Whipping my hair.

Stealing my breath.

**Come back to me.**

There's nothing before the dark.

It's all I've had.

All I know.

It would be so easy.

**You are mine.**

Was I happy in the dark?

I thought I was.

It told me I was.

Could it be right?

**You.**

**Are.**

**MINE.**

The darkness assaults me.

It's desperate.

It needs me.

Needs me to be numb.

Needs me to be unfeeling.

Uncaring.

Blind.

That's how it wins.

But I *feel* now.

I see.

The darkness has lost.

It can't come close.

My little light keeps it at bay.

The dark beats its fists against its glow.

Kicking.

Fighting.

Anything to get to me.

Its tantrum is deafening.

Its anger infinite.

It tries to knock me down.

But I know where I stand.

I stand with my light.

I do not stumble.

Hurricanes roar.

The ground shakes.

But inside, my light is calm.

I am calm.

I grow more confident.

The light expands more.

Brighter.

Brighter.

I see myself.

Brave and determined.

My light shines now.

It's strong and white.

It's reached its brightest.

Pure.

Hopeful.

The darkness stops retreating.

Held at bay.

But never gone.

It hovers.

Watching.

Humming.

Waiting.

Waiting for me to make a move.

It thinks it has me trapped.

I don't know what lies past the horizon.

Can't see past its veil.

But one step takes me closer.

One step pushes it away.

I must trust in my light.

The dark doesn't move until I do.

But the light never fails me.

As long as I don't fail myself.

I step into the dark.

But once I'm there it is no longer.

It becomes illuminated.

Known.

Mine.

I can be strong.

I don't know where I will go.

But I do know that I'm not alone.



I have my light.

That's it.

Just going forward.

I thought there would be more.

But it's enough.

I revel in it.



Revel in the light, the emotion.

Bright.

Free.

It guides me with its warmth.

I beam in its glow.

Bathed in its magnificence.

A beacon of hope.

A beacon of promise.

It surrounds me.

It's a part of me.

I'm a part of it.

We are the same.

I'm always looking forward.

I won't ever stop.

It is all I know.

All I desire.

To shine my light.
