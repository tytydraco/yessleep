I'm debuting as an idol soon.

Born in South Korea, I’ve wanted to be an idol ever since I was a kid.

Luckily, one of the top talent agencies was secretly scouting for a multi-gender, English-speaking group to rival New Gen groups like Stray Kids and NewJeans. 

I’ve been a fan of the older groups since I was young.

My mom was a huge fan of older-gen groups like Big Bang and Girls’ Generation, so they were always on TV when I was a kid. BTS, Black Pink, etc. 

I grew up in the US obsessed with them. 

When we moved to the U.S., I took dance classes every week to improve myself.

After graduating high school, I planned to move to Korea to stay with relatives.

If things didn’t work out, I’d head back to the U.S.

Now, at 25, I know that’s considered “old” for an idol. I’m still not sure how I made it through.

I auditioned because it was my dream. 

But I wasn't expecting anything to really come out of it. I mean, my singing and dancing was subpar, and I *barely* met the beauty standard. I remember the audition was cruel. The judges were *too* honest. 

They weren't judging people. These guys were *insulting* them. 

“Overweight.” 

“Disgusting.”

“Pig.”

“Terrible.”

I almost walked out. Twice. 

However, my group all managed to pass without even performing. 

There were four of us. Thankfully in my age range. Early to mid twenties. 

I'm going to be substituting names due to NDA’S in place. Min, a bubbly singer from Thailand. He was *really* into animals. His whole camera roll was his dog from back home. Min was sweet.

Jay, the youngest, a scowling British guy who brought a book to read while we were waiting. 

Initially, I thought he was an asshole. Especially when he ignored others’ attempts to talk to him, shooing them away with an uncomfortable look. 

But he was just really, *really*  awkward. When he actually started talking, Jay (unintentionally) made me laugh. 

His ice breaker with me was, “I haven't left my room since I graduated college.” 

I laughed, but he looked pretty serious. Then he went off on a weird tangent about League of Legends.

I didn't know what that was, but he seemed really into it. 

Finally, there was Winnie, an Australian model, who arrived late.

But because of her looks, she was the one receiving apologies. 

I watched as fully grown men insisted on grabbing her, telling her how beautiful she was. 

Winnie had a resting bitch face, so I immediately kept my distance. 

But when she came over and introduced herself, I found myself unable to stop talking to her. 

She spoke like she was on fast forward, but that was what made her endearing. Winnie had no idea the whole room was staring at her– and only her. 

Min seemed intrigued by her, the two of them immediately connecting.

Jay gave her a wave, offering his seat, since there were none left. 

I keep thinking back. 

Was it fate that we all met beforehand?

There were around 200 people auditioning, and out of them, only the four of us got through. 

It's not like we had connections. I was from a relatively poor background. 

Min and Jay had part time jobs to survive, and Winnie was walking around with holes in her shoes.

All of us were (and still are) unknown. I kept going through it in my head. 

How did we pass? 

What made *us* better than others? 

To put it simply: Lookism.

Korea is obsessed with beauty. 

They didn't see our talent. 

I don't even think they *wanted* talent. 

They saw faces they could endorse and capitalize on. 

At the time, I wasn't complaining. It was a compliment. It's nice to be called pretty. 

Jay was, admittedly, gorgeous. His accent was the icing on the cake. 

Min had boyish charm and a baby face I *knew* would sell. 

Winnie was self explanatory. Whenever the four of us entered the room, all eyes were on *her*. 

Our looks had already sailed us through, and I don't think I believed it was happening for a while. 

It only fully hit me when we began training, and as a trainee, I came to realize there was no such thing as *eating*. 

I thought it was just junk food, initially. Which was understandable. 

Mom sent chips and candy in a huge comfort package for all of us to share. 

Only for our manager to trash it right in front of us. 

I don't mean she threw it away or confiscated it. I mean she dumped the package in a trash can, and set fire to it. 

No, I'm not joking. 

So, no junk food. I could understand that to an extent. 

During my first month as a trainee, I counted almost fifteen times a food item had been snatched from my hands, and it wasn't even bad food. 

I was eating carrots and celery sticks to keep me going, and the next thing I know, the bag is in the trash, and I’m being forced to my feet to complete one hundred push ups. 

It wasn't just me. Jay made the mistake of eating a candy bar. 

I had zero idea where he'd gotten it from. The guy managed one singular bite, before he choked on the rest. 

Under the pretence of “He's choking”, the candy bar was taken off him. 

I wasn't sure if it was Jay’s failure to chew, or the kpop gods sending down their wrath. 

He did get it back. 

After it had melted and rehardened in our dance instructors pocket, and was basically fucking inedible. 

We shared an apartment, and the refrigerator was empty. 

When Min attempted to go grocery shopping, he was stopped in the middle of the street. 

We did end up devising a plan when lack of food was becoming a problem. 

By ‘problem’, I mean if we didn't get something sustainable into us, we were going to go fucking crazy. 

I was already highly irate. I couldn't concentrate on training, because all I could think about was food.

Jay, who had a short fuse, was argumentative, getting into fights with two dance instructors.

His behaviour was completely out of character, and it was because the guy hadn't eaten anything in days. 

Conveniently, training sessions ran through lunch, and all we *were* allowed was a limp looking salad with a grand total of three lettuce leaves. 

There were no carbs, no real vegetables or dressing, or anything to at least keep us going until dinner. So. I drove half an hour in a random direction to get management off of our tail. 

The plan was to buy as much food as possible, and smuggle it in a storage container only we knew the code to. 

I don't mean buying candy and chips and shit that will screw up our health. 

I mean *healthy* home cooked meals that we could survive on. 

However, the second I jumped out of my car in front of a community owned store, our manager was standing in front of me. 

He was gentle, offering me a candy bar. Like I was a fucking child. 

But he did usher me into his car, not so subtly locking me in. 

According to him and his higher-ups, we were deemed the most visually captivating group. 

Min stood tall and athletic, his handsome features sculpted to perfection. 

Jay possessed a flawless jawline that drew attention effortlessly, while Winnie's figure was described as a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”

I was told my eyes were what ‘sold’ me. 

I could entertain a crowd just by looking at them. I could captivate a whole concert hall. 

Eating meant piling on weight, and weight meant failure.

Still though, whatever excuses he had didn't stop us from eating at every opportunity we had. 

Waking up every single day with an empty stomach, dragging ourselves to training and eating three lettuce leaves was unsurprisingly putting a toll on us. We got into fights over the tiniest inconveniences. 

Min tore my head off because I used his body wash by accident. 

Jay and Winnie had an argument over who was using the sofa bed after 24 straight hours of gruelling training, where we were allowed one single five minute break. 

Min and Jay got into heated arguments over stupid shit that didn't even matter. 

I ripped Winnie’s head off when she used my toothbrush. 

Six months in, Winnie tried to leave.

“I can't do this.”

She broke down to us one morning, and we were her support network. 

I hugged her, and the boys joined in, wrapping her into a comfortable cocoon.

Korea called Winnie *beautiful*. 

Healthy. Glowing. 

I had another word for it. 

When she tried to leave the training room, the girl was gently apprehended, and when she asked our manager for something other than salad, he gave in and ordered a child sized bowl of rice. 

Winnie ate like an animal. 

The rest of us watched her, ravenous. 

I was exhausted, insatiably fucking hungry, and losing my mind. 

I would not regret tearing it out of her hands and eating it myself. 

Training was becoming more demanding, and we were starting to lose our minds a bit. 

It felt like we were slipping into a Lord of the Flies scenario. 

There was a strict rule against intimacy with fellow group members. One night at 3am, I stumbled upon the others in an awkward threesome on the couch. 

Exhausted and possibly hallucinating from hunger, I didn't think much of it.  

The next day at a later time of 4am, after another 15 hour grueling training session, I found myself collapsing onto the couch with them, and one thing led to another—I ended up joining in. 

We talked about it, each of us agreeing it was nice. 

But there was no way we could continue something so special while we were trainees. 

There reached a point when my manager’s words were no longer registering. I awoke every day at 5am, after three hours of sleep. 

I went over choreography until my body was aching, my thoughts reduced to mush. 

But I always had one goal in mind. 

Debut. 

I was stopped in the middle of the street by a kind woman who told me I was beautiful. 

She hugged me and gave me two granola bars. I ate the first one so fast I couldn't even remember the taste. I saved the rest to share with the others. 

I did *try* to share it. 

My group mates were barely coherent after we were forced to repeat the choreography 26 times, because Jay kept stumbling. It wasn't that he was a bad dancer. He was too TIRED. 

We were all so fucking tired. 

When I showed them the food, they barely reacted. 

I wasn't expecting the higher ups to enter the studio when I was pulling apart the bar and offering pieces to them. 

Our manager didn't snatch it away, thankfully.

I ate that fucking granola bar right in his face.

However, he did extend training by three hours. 

I wasn't the only one struggling. Min was losing color in his cheeks due to lack of sleep, and somehow it was HIS FAULT. 

Min didn't even eat salad after that. 

Instead, while we were all eating our three allocated lettuce leaves, he went to the gym. In his words, “I'm going to work off all of the calories.”

WHAT calories????  

Somehow, keeping to the *diet* actually paid off. We were set to debut. 

Not publicly, but in front of the industry higher ups. 

The night before, however, we decided to treat ourselves.

McDonald's. 

I suggested it when our manager went out to dinner. For once, he wasn't stalking us, and neither were his entourage of guards. 

I ate two triple cheese burgers and three helpings of fries. Winnie downed four burgers (somehow) and two sodas. 

The guys were hesitant at first, but once they started eating, they couldn't stop. 

I had never seen them so happy, and at that moment I actually felt like a normal person. 

Afterwards, we grabbed drinks and snacks, constantly looking over our shoulder to see if we were being followed. 

We were not. 

So, when we got back to the apartment, we indulged in soda and chips. 

I went to sleep happy and *full* for the first time in months. It's crazy how good a proper meal can make you feel. 

I was woken up, however, maybe a few hours later, to violent retching. 

*Jay*. 

It's not out of the ordinary for a trainee to wake up to vomiting. It's pretty normal for trainees to purge at night, and then get rid of any evidence. 

That is what I figured was happening. 

But I could hear him crying, his sobs echoing down the hallway. 

After a while of sitting up in bed, half aware of my muddled thoughts and a sharp pain in my lower gut, Winnie stumbled into my room, hysterical. 

“It's Jay!” She shrieked. In the dull glow of my bedroom lamp, her cheeks were sickly white. “There's something wrong with him—”

Winnie covered her mouth suddenly, before she threw up all over herself. 

I could hear Min choking in the hallway. Coughing quickly morphed into barfing. 

Food poisoning, I thought, my own stomach lurching. I could taste it, a sudden rotten slime slowly inching up my throat. 

Surely, it was the fast food we ate. Those burgers. 

They did taste weird, but I thought it was just, like spicy mayo. 

I didn't make it to the bathroom, dropping to my knees and spewing through my hands. Whatever it was, whatever we had, did not agree with us. 

I had body aches that made it impossible to move, to even breathe. 

The next twenty four hours were horrific. 

I spent the entire time running backwards and forwards to and from the bathroom, crashing into the others, like a fucking cartoon. I couldn't keep anything down. 

Bottled water just came back up, tea and honey, gatorade, even anti sickness meds. I was delirious, hot and cold, and then somehow not feeling at all.

I passed out on the bathroom floor, my legs entangled with Min. 

He muttered something along the lines of *lawsuit* because those burgers had made us *really* fucking sick. 

At some point, I was in the shower, trying to cool myself off. 

But I was so hot. 

“Lawwsuiiiiit.” Min was singing, half delirious, curled into a ball. 

“Lawsuit. Fucking lawwwwwwsuit.”

His voice felt like a pickaxe knocking against my skull. 

“Min.” Jay’s voice was a relief. I thought he was unconscious. “Shut the *fuck* up.”

“But it's a lawsuit.”

I heard something hit the wall behind Min (Maybe a book?) from Jay’s direction. 

Min’s delirious chanting of “lawsuit” came to an end. 

The shower was too hot. 

Then it was too cold, and then it was burning my skin. I felt like my skin was peeling off, my blood boiling in my veins, my brain coming apart. 

It was like being set alight.

I was half conscious. I only remember tripping over Min's outstretched legs, triggering a far weaker, mumbled, “lawsuit”. 

I  collapsed into bed, my body twisting and contorting. 

It didn't feel like a virus, or even gastritis. 

I was barely conscious, sitting on the side of my bed, when I sneezed something into my hands, choking up chunks of deep, dark red. 

Jay was on the floor, and Winnie was on the *ceiling*. 

I didn't remember eating anything red. 

I stared at the gloopy red lumps trickling down my palm. It wasn't food.

I had already brought up the entire contents of my gut. 

This was too *warm.*

It was lumpy and bright, staining my hands. 

“All of it. I want you to bring up *everything*, Sunny.”

The voice came from behind me. 

*Something* was behind me. I could see it's inhuman, bulging shadow. 

I felt its slimy, wet fingers rubbing circles on my back. 

“Do you *want* to be an idol?”  The thing demanded, it's tongue flicking out, licking my neck. 

"It's *hungry*. It wants to eat. It wants to *feast*.”

The voice dropped into a monstrous snarl. I could feel warm saliva pooling down my neck. “Will you feed it?”

I think in my state, I screamed, “Yes.”

The others echoed my cry. 

I found myself repeating his words, the others joining in, in sync. “You… do… not… need…to…eat. You need to feed *it*.”

We do not…

Breathe. 

Sleep. 

Think. 

We feed *it*. 

It. 

That dripped from the walls, in every corner. 

Masses of writhing flesh closing in on us, gnawing mouths twitching wider and wider. 

It's voice inside my head demanded more. It wanted *more*. 

It wanted to *feast*. Min was slumped into the wall, opposite me, his head hanging, half lidded eyes glued to what poured from the walls, what was swallowing us up.  

Jay was gone, his body devoured by writhing mounds of flesh—red, slithering amalgamations spilling into the room, swallowing Winnie whole. 

It looked like the inside of a human being. 

Without the skin.

It told me not to be afraid.

But I was already scrambling back on my hands and knees, watching it chew through my friends, merciless slimy mounds ripping through their flesh. 

Its breath, hot and sticky, curled against the back of my neck, and I think I gave up. 

I pressed my cheek to the cold bathroom tiles and curled in on myself. 

I let it seep through the door, let it spill into my mouth and nose, filling my lungs—stealing my breath. Stealing my will to breathe.

I can't remember anything after that, except waking up, covered in warm slime slick on my arms and legs, already hardening between my fingers. 

I tried to push through, but I couldn't move, half aware of my body contorting beneath me. 

I lay there for hours, watching Min’s arm break through hardened, crystallised slime. I could see Jay, or what was left of him, poking from a bulging mass of flesh. 

I didn't feel sick anymore. 

I didn't feel anything.

The sheer exhaustion and fear sent me into a deep sleep.

Min woke me up with a sheepish smile, but his eyes were hollow. 

Sunlight was pouring through the windows, and he was already dressed for the day. 

“Crazy dream, right?” He laughed a little too hard, and ran back to the bathroom. 

But it wasn't a fever dream. If it was, we wouldn't have shared the same one. 

I could still see the markings on his arm, where *it* had consumed him, head to toe. 

I pointed them out, and he just shrugged, smiling, saying, “I probably… slept weird.”

Neither of us wanted to say the obvious: Those markings on his arm were *fingers*.

I had them too. 

A doctor came to see our group, diagnosing us with food poisoning.

But I'm pretty sure food poisoning can't cause significant changes to appearance. 

The boys were somehow glowing, their figures too perfect, almost surreal like looking in a fun mirror. 

Min's baby face was exactly what they wanted, as if it had been meticulously structured and molded. 

Jay looked ethereal, but beauty like him shouldn't exist. 

Yet somehow, it did in idols. It was forced beauty. 

Manufactured and tailored beauty that wasn't natural, wasn't normal. 

Jay was already pretty. 

He *already* met the beauty standard, so why did they insist on turning him into this? 

Into someone I barely recognized? 

Winnie was *too* thin, to the point of looking like a fragmented reflection. 

Her skin was so pale, sickly and lacking color. 

My eyes were no longer my only defining features. 

I had a body that moved gracefully, allowing me to twist it to fit any choreography. 

I forced down a cupcake, and threw it back up. 

I tried water to wash out my mouth, and threw that up too. 

This wasn't happening. That's what I kept TELLING myself. There was no way my body was just rejecting everything. 

I went crazy, as soon as I figured out I couldn't keep down *anything* I ate. 

Pasta, bread, meals, noodles, soda– 

Nothing. 

When I manage to stuff something down my throat, my stomach immediately revolts. 

It's not just appearances that have changed. 

The others are acting weird. Like they're permanently high. 

Personalities, too. 

Jay has switched from an awkward guy with a friendly smile who I had grown to love, to someone who wouldn't even *look* at you if you weren't on his level. 

Min brought a girl home three nights ago, but I didn't see/hear her leave at any point. I asked him before training, and he just shrugged with a clueless smile. 

“She stayed for dinner.”

I nodded slowly, suddenly conscious of him talking about *dinner*. 

Which meant he was *eating*. 

“Why didn't you invite the rest of us?” I asked, dumping my backpack on the ground next to his. “What did you guys have to eat, anyway?”

“Just food.” he said, shooting me a grin. 

His cryptic behavior was starting to drive me crazy. “Okay, so *what* food?”

Min didn't answer, only pressing a finger to his lips with a smirk, and dancing away. 

“Are you guys dating?” I asked, waiting for his snort. 

His laugh was more of an ironic sputter. 

Trainees can't *date*. 

He's gotten really good at dancing, almost to the point of it looking inhuman. 

Min’s backflips are effortless, his body moving like flowing water. 

I stayed at the studio late that night, and made my way home around midnight. 

When I pushed through the door, Min and Jay were in the kitchen. 

Winnie was on the couch. 

Ego surfing, probably. 

She can't do it publicly yet, so Winnie scrolls through what fellow trainees are saying on our shared group chat.

The girl offered me a quiet greeting, her gaze glued to her phone. 

Since our manager finally let us have our phones back, my friend hasn't let go of hers. 

She was a little bit too obsessed with others' opinions.

After being named the ‘face’ of our group, Winnie wanted to keep it that way. 

“Hey, Sunny!” Min shouted from the kitchen. Jay sat on the counter top, swinging his legs, his eyes glued to the pan. “Do you want to see what I'm cooking?” 

I nodded. Curious, I headed over to what was bubbling away in the crock pot. 

Meat. 

Min leaned close, and I caught a smear of tomato sauce on his shirt. “Smells good, huh.”

It *did*. 

I couldn't keep the smile off of my face. 

Beef stew, I figured. There were dumplings and vegetables to go with it. 

We all sat down, and I ate something *real* for the first time in weeks. It was perfectly chewy and melted in my mouth. 

And the best part? I didn't throw it back up. 

In fact, I was hungry for more. 

So hungry, in fact, that I decided to grab leftovers when the others were training. 

By now, my mouth was watering. 

I could still taste this stew. 

It was the best thing I had ever eaten. It felt almost nostalgic, like a home cooked meal from back home. 

I wanted *more*. 

However, the refrigerator was empty, bar a few cans of beer and some old cheese I remember managing to smuggle through a mutual friend.

I did try the cheese in a sandwich, only to find myself choking it back up. 

The only thing I could eat was Min’s stew. 

I figured maybe he was hiding some in his room. That was my half delirious thought process.

But I didn't find beef stew. 

Instead, under his bed was what was left of the girl he'd brought home. 

Her severed head stared up with vacant, lifeless eyes. 

The jagged edges of her neck bore the marks of a saw, the flesh uneven and raw. Pieces of her body were meticulously 

wrapped in plastic, blood pooling through clear sheeting staining it deep dark red. Her limbs were bound together like butchered meat. The smell was overwhelming, choking my senses. 

I wrenched back, stumbled out of the room, and slammed the door. 

I called the cops, but halfway through the call, my phone cut off. 

Every time I try to talk to our manager, he pushes me away. 

It's always, *“Not now, Sunny.”* or *“Can this wait?”*

When I went back to Min’s room, the body was gone. 

There was more beef stew that night. I stayed in my room, despite my growling stomach. 

I stood next to Min on the practice stage yesterday, and I'm terrified of him. 

This man is going to debut at some point. 

This fucking monster. 

His teeth are too sharp, pricking through a wide grin. 

I fucking SWORE he was drooling, saliva seeping down his chin. I caught him smirk at a girl in the audience. 

But Winnie and Jay aren't much better. 

I've caught Jay dragging guys backstage during small concerts, and Winnie disappears all night. She comes back with guys, pulling them into her room. 

I can't stop thinking about that girl’s body disappearing. 

Min keeps making beef stew, and the more I eat it, the hungrier I become. 

But every time I eat, I throw up?

What the fuck is wrong with me?

Min brought home another girl today. I can hear her laughing. 

I can smell her. Her perfume is so fucking strong, I can't think straight. 

I’m going crazy. 

Sometimes I lose track of myself. 

I'm here sitting in bed, and then I'm halfway down the hallway, and her voice is in my head, like cymbals crashing in my skull. I can't get her smell out of my head. 

Music is helping so far, but I don't know how long I can deal with this. 

I'm so *hungry*. 

I'm eating chips right now, but they're not staying down. 

I keep blacking out. 

I blink, and then I've somehow moved. 

I'm further down the hallway, my head trapped in fog. 

Jay joined me last time, his vacant eyes glued to the lounge door. 

He caught my eye, and winked. 

I think he's waiting for something. There was a predatory, territorial look in his eyes. 

I think he's waiting for the girl’s laughter to stop. 

Jay, Min, Winnie, all of them scare me. 

I'm terrified of myself. I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

Every passing day, the people that once felt like family are morphing into strangers. 

Monsters. 

I caught Min looking in the mirror last night. 

He pulled his shirt off, and his back was stretched, like his skin was hanging off. 

Jay didn't seem to mind. He just grabbed a pair of scissors, cutting off the excess. 

Then, he ran his fingers down his perfect, sculpted body, his lips breaking into a grin. 

I'm not allowed a lock on my door, so I've pushed my bed against it, barricading myself in my room. 

So far, I think I'm okay. 

Please. If you're an idol fan, stay away from us when we debut. 

Don't come near ANY of us. Just stay away from idols in general. 

For your own safety.

Because I think the others want to feed *it*.
