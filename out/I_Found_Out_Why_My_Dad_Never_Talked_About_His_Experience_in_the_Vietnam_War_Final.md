[Previous Parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/comments/1bg4l0g/i_found_out_why_my_dad_never_talked_about_his/)

Sitting across from my dad, the dim light of the living room casting long shadows on his face, I could see the toll recounting that story had taken on him. It was a lot to take in, the kind of tale you'd expect to find in books or movies, not in the life of someone you knew, someone as close as your own father.

He leaned back into the sofa, his eyes closing for a moment. The silence between us was heavy.

"Wow," was all I managed to utter.

"I always intended to go back for Tuyet," he began, his voice tinged with a sadness that seemed to permeate the room. "But life... life has a way of taking plans and twisting them into something unrecognizable."

“The US withdrew from Vietnam, and not long after, the South fell to the North. Everything changed overnight. I found myself a refugee, displaced, with nothing but what I could carry and the memories of what had been."

He sighed, a sound that seemed to carry the weight of years and continents. "After I came to America, everything was about building a new life from the ashes of the old one. I met your mom, and we started a family. Life... it just moved on, you know?"

My dad tried to stand up from the sofa, but the chemotherapy had taken its toll on his strength. As he wobbled, I rushed over, catching him just before he could fall. "Dad, you've got to be more careful," I said, helping him sit back down.

"Could you do me a favor? There's something in the closet I want to show you," he asked.

Curious, I made my way to the closet he mentioned. Pushing aside coats and boxes, I found a heavy wooden box hidden at the back.

Carefully, I pulled the box out and carried it back to my dad. His eyes lit up as he saw it. "After the ‘Liberation,’ I had to burn most of my personal effects from the war," he began, his fingers tracing the contours of the box. "But… I managed to save a few things."

I watched as my dad flipped the latch and opened the lid of the box with a reverence that seemed almost sacred. The first items he carefully lifted out were his medals and ribbons. They were worn, the colors faded, but the pride they represented remained undiminished.

Beneath the medals, a stack of photos caught my attention. I carefully lifted them, feeling the weight of history in my hands. The first photo was of my paternal grandparents, along with aunts and uncles. There was a big chunk missing from the side of the photo where my dad would be.

Next, I saw a photo of his platoon, young men in uniform, standing tall and proud. My dad pointed to himself, a much younger version, and then to others he had mentioned in his story.

There was also a more recent photo, taken a few years ago. My dad was sitting with two men, their faces familiar from my childhood. Uncle Lâm and Uncle Hùng. I smiled at the memory of them visiting our home, their families blending with ours during those visits. They were like extended family, their children like cousins to me.

"We never spoke of what happened, not even among ourselves," he confessed. “We were afraid. If the CIA ever found out what we saw, what we did... well, let's just say we weren't sure they’d leave us in peace."

"They've both passed, you know. Cancer took them." He paused. "Lung cancer for Lâm, and Hùng... pancreatic cancer.”

My attention was drawn back to the box as I noticed a scarf, its fabric tinged with specks of dark, half a century-old blood.

I gently lifted the scarf, holding it up to the dim light. The checkered pattern seemed to dance as the light filtered through its weave. It felt surreal, holding a tangible piece of my dad’s story in my hands.

Beneath the scarf, my attention was captured by a torn photograph. It was a picture of a young woman, dressed in a traditional áo dài, her poise and grace undeniable even in the simple black and white photograph, her smile radiating warmth and a sense of familiarity.

“Is this Tuyet?” I asked.

“Yeah, it is,” he said. "After all these years, I still think about her, about what life she led after the war. If she found happiness."

"Did you…" I started. “... Did you ever try to find out what happened to her?"

He sighed, a deep, weary sound. "I did try. But Vietnam was closed off to the world for years, and by the time it opened up again, I… knew it was too late. There was no longer a path back to her. I had to let go, for the sake of my family here, for your mom, and for you kids.”

I could feel the heartbreak in his voice. But I didn’t know what I could possibly say to make it better.

"You know, I've been thinking a lot about my life, especially now," he said. "My time is running out. I've made peace with that." He paused.

"I've lived a good life. I did some crazy shit in my youth. Then I came here and raised a beautiful family. What more can a guy ask for?" he continued, his eyes meeting mine. "But there's always been this... void, an unresolved chapter of my past."

I knew what he wanted to say before he said it.

"If Tuyet is still out there, if she's alive... I’d like to see her one last time. And if she's not, then I'd at least like to lay flowers at her grave. I owe her that.”

His gaze held mine, imploring me to understand the depth of his request.

"Dad, of course," I replied. "We'll find her together, I promise."

His hand reached out, gripping mine with a strength that surprised me. "Thank you," he whispered, a profound relief washing over his face.

—

The very next day, dad's condition took a sudden and unexpected turn for the worse. It happened so quickly; one moment he was sharing with me any details that could help find Tuyet, and the next, he was struggling to breathe. The cancer, which had seemed to be at bay, roared back with a vengeance, leaving us scrambling.

The end came in the early hours of the morning, with only the sterile hum of hospital machines for company. I held his hand, feeling the warmth slowly ebb away, until he was gone, leaving a silence in his wake that was heavier than I ever could have imagined.

The funeral brought my sisters and their families back from out of state. We gathered, a small, somber group under the cloudy sky, as we prepared to lay dad to rest next to mom, Loan, who had passed away years before.

Losing dad was like losing a piece of myself. The house felt emptier, the silence more profound. Yet, amidst the grief, a fire had been lit within me—a determination to fulfill his final wish. I would find Tuyet.

The task seemed insurmountable. Vietnam had changed so much, and all I had was a first name and a half-century-old photograph. But I couldn't let it go.

—

I considered my options. The only person I could think of who could help was Ash, an old buddy of mine who, alongside his wife Reine, ran a private eye firm out of New Orleans. They were somewhat of legends in their field, having solved a 25-year-old missing person’s cold [case](https://www.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/comments/192g7zw/an_heiress_went_missing_25_years_ago_what/) with little more than a faded Polaroid and a heap of intuition. It was a long shot, but if anyone could track down Tuyet after all these years, it would be them.

I dialed Ash’s number, the familiar tones echoing in the empty room, each one heavy with the weight of hope and desperation. The call connected, and Ash’s voice, deep and slightly gruff, greeted me.

“Hey, buddy, it’s been a while. What’s up?” he asked, the warmth in his voice a small comfort.

Catching up with Ash brought a brief respite from the gloom that had settled over me. He shared the news of Reine giving birth to twins, a boy, and a girl, the joy evident even through the phone line. "It's a whole new adventure for us," he said, his voice tinged with the unmistakable pride of a new father.

“Congrats on the twins, man. That's amazing news," I said, genuinely happy for him.

"Thanks, it's been a wild ride. How about you? How's everything on your end?" Ash inquired.

"Well, Mira's expecting, too," I revealed, the news still feeling surreal every time I said it out loud. "We're excited... and scared, all at once."

"That's fantastic, man!” he said, sounding ecstatic for me.

“Yeah, it is…” I managed to say.

“There's something else, isn’t there? I can hear it in your voice. What's going on?" Ash asked, his perceptiveness was impeccable.

I took a deep breath before I spoke. “Actually, I called to ask you for a favor, Ash. It’s… I need you to find someone. it’s important,” I began, my voice faltering as I tried to find the words to explain the magnitude of the task.

Ash paused, the silence on the line stretching between us. "You know, Reine and I have actually stepped back from detective life since the twins were born. Family first, you know?" he said with a hint of regret.

I nodded, even though he couldn't see me. "I completely understand. I normally wouldn't ask but… It's just... it's about my old man. He... he passed away recently," I admitted, the words heavy on my tongue.

"Shit, dude. I'm sorry to hear that," Ash's voice softened. "Your dad was a great man. Tell me what you need."

I explained everything to him then—the story my dad had entrusted to me, his final wish to find Tuyet, and the very little I had to go on. I could hear Ash listening intently, the occasional "uh-huh" signaling his engagement.

When I finished, there was a brief pause. "That's quite a story," Ash finally said. "I can see why this means so much to you."

"Yeah, it's... it's the least I can do for him," I said, feeling the weight of that truth settle around me.

Ash sighed deeply. "Look, I’ll have to run it by Reine first… But for old times' sake, and because it's for your dad, I'll see what I can do. I can't promise anything though.”

Relief washed over me, mingled with gratitude. "Thanks, bro. Really, thank you. I know it's a long shot, but even just trying means a lot to me."

"We'll need all the details you can give us, every little bit helps,” he says.

“Yeah, okay, sure,” I reply, feeling a surge of hope.

“And hey, let's catch up properly when you're not neck-deep in grief, okay?" Ash's attempt to lighten the mood was welcome.

"Yeah, that sounds good," I managed a small smile, the first in what felt like ages. "And Ash, thanks again. This means the world to me."

"No problem, buddy. We'll get started right away. And congratulations on the baby, by the way. That's something to hold onto, something new to look forward to," Ash reminded me, bringing a flicker of warmth to the cold space left by my father's passing.

—

Over the next few days, Ash kept me updated with regular calls and texts. Each time the phone buzzed, my heart skipped, hoping for the news I so desperately needed to hear. But as the days passed, those calls were filled with more of Ash and Reine's tireless efforts and dead ends than the breakthrough I was waiting for.

Then, nearly two weeks in, my phone rang with Ash's number. I picked up on the first ring, barely able to contain my anticipation.

"We’ve found her," Ash's voice came through, cutting straight to the chase.

“You did?” I asked, not believing my own ears.

"Yeah, we did," he confirmed, a tired but triumphant smile spreading across his face as he switched to FaceTime. Ash looked exactly as I remembered him, albeit with a few more grays and the unmistakable signs of sleepless nights etched under his eyes.

Reine appeared in the background, her voice floating in. "I'll join y’all in a sec. Just need to put these little rebels to bed."

Ash started, detailing their steps with a level of detail that was frankly astonishing. "So, first, we combed through military archives for any mention of a Tuyet fitting your description around the specified time frame," he said, his tone shifting to what I could only describe as detective-mode. "It was like looking for a needle in a haystack, considering how common the name is."

Reine finally joined Ash in front of the camera. Her hair was pulled back in a practical ponytail, and she wore a simple t-shirt that had seen better days, likely a casualty of motherhood. Her face, though tired, was alight with the excitement of their success.

"Hey, sorry about that. Bedtime is like negotiating with tiny, unreasonable bosses," she said, her slight accent danced softly on the edges of her words.

"We hit a goldmine when we stumbled upon a local newspaper article from 2018. It was a profile on a veteran named Đinh Mỹ Tuyết," Ash said, his tone animated, reflecting the importance of this find. "She was described as a sniper during the War. The timeline matched perfectly with what you told us."

Reine leaned closer to the screen, her eyes bright. "The article mentioned that she's retired and living in Hội An. It even had a photo of her, and let me tell you, the resemblance to the woman in your dad's photo is uncanny," she added, her excitement palpable.

I was speechless, a whirlwind of emotions swirling within me. "That's... that's incredible. I can't believe you found her," I managed to say.

Reine nodded, a gentle seriousness overtaking her features. "We've made preliminary contact, just to confirm it's her. She's a bit wary, understandably, but she's open to meeting you. She mentioned something about 'unfinished stories' that needed closure."

"There's something else you should know…" Ash says, his tone suddenly serious. He glances at Reine.

"Chéri, you might want to sit down for this part," Reine suggested.

Confused and a bit apprehensive, I take a seat, my heart pounding in anticipation of what could possibly add more weight to this already heavy revelation. "What is it?" I ask, bracing myself.

Ash paused, as if gathering his thoughts, or perhaps considering the weight of his next words. "We found birth records... Tuyết had a son, Nhân, born roughly within a year of her meeting your dad."

The information hung in the air between us, a bombshell that seemed to warp the very fabric of reality around me.

"Are you saying...?" I asked.

Ash nodded, his expression empathetic yet unwavering. "Yes. We believe your dad is Nhân's father. You have a half-brother."

—

After the call, I was in a daze, my mind racing with the magnitude of what I'd just learned. A half-brother. A part of my dad's life, his story, that I never knew existed. The rest of the day passed in a blur, my thoughts a tangled mess of emotions I couldn't quite sort through.

The sound of the front door opening snapped me back to the present. “Spencer, I’m home!” my wife Mira called out. Her footsteps echoed in the hallway, her presence a comforting constant in the whirlwind my life had become in the past few hours.

"How did the doctor's appointment go?" I asked, trying to focus on the present.

Mira smiled, her hand instinctively resting on her belly. "It went well," she said. "The doctor says everything's looking good. Baby's healthy and growing right on schedule."

Mira and I had been trying to conceive for years, facing setback after setback. Each negative test, each failed attempt, had been a small heartbreak. But we kept trying, holding onto hope, supporting each other through every disappointment.

"That's great news," I replied, my voice genuine but distracted. Mira noticed, her gaze sharpening as she studied my face.

"Everything okay? You seem... off," she said, concern lacing her words.

I hesitated, unsure of how to even begin explaining the day's revelations. "It's... complicated. I found out something about my dad today. It's a lot to process."

Mira came over, her concern for me evident in every step. "Want to talk about it?" she asked, her voice soft.

I nodded, the floodgates opening as I shared everything Ash and Reine had uncovered. Mira listened, her presence a steady anchor as I navigated the stormy seas of my emotions.

By the end, the room was filled with a heavy silence, both of us contemplating the weight of what I'd just shared. Mira reached out, her hand finding mine, her touch a reminder of the strength we shared.

"I think I need to go to Vietnam," I finally said, the words feeling both freeing and terrifying as they left my lips. "I need to meet Tuyet... and Nhan."

Mira’s response wasn't immediate, but when it came, it was delivered with the same strength and understanding she'd shown me through every challenge we'd faced together. "Then you should go," she said, her voice firm yet gentle.

"But what about—"

Mira cut me off gently. "We'll be fine here," she assured me, her hand resting on her belly. "This is something you need to do, not just for your dad, but for yourself. And I'll be here, waiting for you to come back and tell us both the story.”

—

In the weeks that followed, I made preparations for the trip. The logistics were complex, the emotional preparation even more so. Mira was my constant, her presence a calming force in the whirlwind of passport renewals, flight bookings, and late-night worries that plagued me.

The day of my departure arrived all too quickly. Standing at the terminal of LAX, with Mira beside me, I felt the magnitude of the journey I was about to undertake. "Promise me you'll be careful," Mira said, her voice thick with emotion.

"I promise," I replied, wrapping her in a tight hug, feeling the solid reality of her, of us.

With one last kiss, I turned and walked towards the security checkpoint, not daring to look back, for fear that the sight of her standing there would unravel the delicate courage I'd managed to weave together.

The flight from Los Angeles to Sài Gòn was a grueling one. I found myself cramped in economy, sandwiched between a chatty tourist with a penchant for dad jokes and a quiet Vietnamese woman who spent most of the flight with her eyes closed, possibly in prayer or just seeking peace amidst the chaos of travel. As the hours stretched on, I tried to distract myself with movies I barely followed and music that sounded more like noise against the drone of the aircraft. Sleep proved elusive, my mind racing with thoughts of what lay ahead.

Upon landing at Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport, the wave of tropical heat hit me the moment I stepped off the plane. The customs process was chaotic. I was pulled aside for a “random check,” the customs official's eyes glinting with the unspoken expectation of a bribe.

Reluctantly, I slipped a few crisp bills into my passport as I handed it over for inspection. The official's demeanor shifted subtly, a nod of understanding passing between us before he waved me through with a barely perceptible smile.

The connecting flight to Đà Nẵng was shorter, the plane cutting through skies that transitioned from the deep blue of dusk to the inky black of night.

As soon as I disembarked from the plane at Đà Nẵng, I navigated through the modest but bustling airport to find a somewhat quieter corner. Taking out my phone, I dialed the number of the contact Ash and Reine had given me. It belonged to Duyên, Tuyet's granddaughter and Nhân's daughter.

The phone rang twice before a voice answered, clear and confident. "Hello?"

"Hi, Duyên? It's Spencer," I said, my voice betraying none of the turmoil inside. “I just arrived.”

"Ah, I've been expecting your call." Duyên replied, her English nearly flawless and tinged with a warm tone. “You'll recognize me when you see me. I'm just outside the arrival gate, holding a sign with your name on it.”

Thanking her, I ended the call and made my way to the baggage claim to collect my suitcase. Once I had my belongings, I headed for the exit, scanning the crowd for a sign with my name.

True to her word, it didn't take long to spot Duyên. She was younger than I expected, probably in her early twenties, with a bright, welcoming smile. Her sign, a simple piece of cardboard with "SPENCER" written in bold letters, stood out among the throngs of people.

Duyên's appearance was strikingly reminiscent of the young woman in the photograph my father had cherished. She had the same gentle eyes and the same confident stance. "Spencer Huynh?" she called out as I approached, her smile widening in recognition.

"Yes, that's me," I confirmed, extending my hand for a shake that she quickly bypassed in favor of a warm hug.

"It's good to meet you. Welcome to Việt Nam!" she said, stepping back to look at me again, as if trying to find traces of her father in my face.

"Let's get you settled. We have a bit of a drive ahead of us to Hội An."

Duyên led me through the parking lot. As we walked, she glanced over at me.

"So, what should I call you? Mr. Huynh? Uncle?" Her tone was playful yet respectful, acknowledging our familial connection yet uncertain of its boundaries.

"Just call me Spencer," I replied, smiling.

Alright, Spencer it is," she said with a nod.

As we stepped outside, the humidity enveloping me like a thick blanket, Duyen led me to our ride. My expectation of a car vanished when I saw a Honda Wave parked by the curb. My eyes widened in disbelief. "We're taking that?" I asked, gesturing to the small motorcycle, then to my suitcase.

Duyên giggled, sensing my apprehension. "Don't worry. We make it work here." With a deftness born of practice, she arranged my luggage and secured it, then handed me a helmet. "You'll need this. The police are strict about helmet laws."

I put on the helmet and climbed onto the back of the Wave, my hands tentatively finding a hold as Duyên kick-started the engine to life.

The ride was an experience unlike any I'd ever had. Duyên navigated through the chaotic traffic with the skill of a seasoned rider, weaving between cars and trucks with what seemed like mere inches to spare. Every honk and near-miss had me gripping the sides of the bike tighter, but Duyên seemed unfazed, occasionally throwing curses at particularly errant drivers.

Trying to distract myself from the fear of imminent death, I struck up a conversation with Duyên, raising my voice to be heard over the roar of the engine and the cacophony of the traffic.

"So, how's life in Hội An?" I asked, raising my voice slightly to be heard over the noise of the traffic.

"It's peaceful, mostly. Touristy, but it has its charm," she replied, her voice steady despite the constant maneuvering. "You'll see. It's a world away from this."

"How's Tuyet? And Nhan?" I asked.

"Grandma's strong. But she's getting old, you know? She talks about the past a lot... I think she's looking forward to meeting you." She paused, navigating a tight turn before adding, "Dad's... complicated. He's had a tough few years."

Her words did little to calm the storm of emotions brewing inside me. The anticipation of meeting them was a tangled knot of excitement, apprehension, and a deep-seated longing for a connection I hadn't known I was missing.

I found myself holding onto Duyên tighter than I intended. "You're good at this," I shouted over the noise, trying to make conversation and perhaps distract myself from the precariousness of our mode of transport.

Duyên laughed, the sound barely reaching me over the din. "You get used to it!" she shouted back. "Besides, this is nothing. Wait till you see Hội An during the tourist season."

Before I knew it, the hustle and bustle of the city was far behind us, replaced by the tranquil beauty of the Vietnamese countryside.

As we entered Hội An, the city's famed lanterns began to light up the evening, casting a warm glow over the streets and the Thu Bồn River. The historical charm of the city was immediately apparent, with its well-preserved architecture and bustling marketplaces offering a glimpse into Vietnam's rich cultural tapestry.

Pulling up to a stop outside a traditional Vietnamese house nestled in a quiet street of the ancient town, Duyên killed the engine and dismounted the motorcycle. I followed suit.

"You ready?" she asked, her eyes reflecting the lantern light.

Taking a deep breath, I nodded. "As I'll ever be."

“Relax, Spencer, you’re among family here,” Duyên said, smiling reassuringly.

Duyên led me through the small, meticulously kept garden that fronted the house. The fading sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the path.

She opened the door and stepped inside, her voice echoing as she called out, "Bà nội (grandma)! I’m home. We have a visitor." Her words seemed to hang in the air for a moment before a response came.

A woman appeared from deeper within the house, a broom in hand as if caught in the middle of tidying up the house for guests. “This house is such a damn mess!” she lamented to herself.

Despite the passage of time, her resemblance to the young woman in the photograph was unmistakable. Her eyes, sharp and discerning, softened as they met mine. I instantly recognized her as Tuyet.

"Chào con," she greeted, her voice carrying a warmth that belied her initial scrutinizing glance. Setting aside the broom, she stepped forward, her movements carrying the grace of her youth.

“Chào cô. I’m Spencer, Thành’s son. We talked over the phone…” I said to her in Vietnamese.

Tuyết's eyes lingered on me, searching, as if trying to find traces of my father in my features. A multitude of emotions flickered across her face, settling into a tender smile. "Of course I know who you are," she reassured me. Extending her hand, she clasped mine, her grip firm, grounding.

As we settled into the living room, a cozy space filled with the light of the setting sun, Tuyet turned to Duyên and instructed her to prepare a pot of tea. The air inside was cool, a respite from the day's warmth, filled with the scent of jasmine and incense.

Once Duyên had left to make the tea, Tuyet gestured for me to take a seat on a cushioned bench near the window. "Your name, once more, please?" she requested, her voice gentle.

"Spencer," I replied, watching her face as she tried to wrap her tongue around the unfamiliar sounds.

With a soft chuckle, she shook her head. "These English names are too complicated for my old ears," she admitted. "Do you have a Vietnamese name?"

"Sang," I said, feeling a connection to that part of my heritage, even if it was one I rarely used.

"Sang," she repeated, with a nod of approval. "You look like a Sang."

As Duyên came in with the tea, the aroma filled the room, a subtle invitation to relax and share more freely. Tuyet poured the tea with practiced ease, her hands steady despite their age.

The conversation flowed easily, despite the weight of the reason for my visit. As I shared about my career as an engineer and my excitement and fears about becoming a parent soon, Tuyet listened intently. She spoke of her own experiences, touching on the challenges and joys of motherhood.

As the initial pleasantries gave way to a comfortable silence, I took the opportunity to present the items I had brought with me—the checkered scarf and the photograph of a young Tuyet. She studied them for a moment, her fingers tracing the fabric of the scarf, then shifting to the edges of the photograph. A myriad of emotions seemed to pass over her face, a silent conversation with memories long held.

Without a word, she stood and walked over to a corner of the room where a small altar had been set up. It was dedicated to honoring the dead, filled with incense, small offerings, and photographs of loved ones.

Among the photos displayed on the altar, I spotted the old torn photograph of my father. Next to it, almost protectively, was a patch bearing the tiger insignia of the Rangers. With reverence, Tuyet placed the photograph of her younger self next to my dad's. The torn edges of the two photos aligned almost perfectly, as if they were matching pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that had been separated for far too long.

"It's hard to believe we were ever that young," she murmured, her stare lingering on the altar. "Life was simpler, in some ways, and so much harder in others."

Tuyet sighed. "I couldn't let Nhân grow up bearing the stigma of being the son of an enemy soldier."

"I told everyone his father was a soldier from the North, one who had died fighting the Americans. It was easier, safer for him," she said. “So, in a way, I’ve been mourning for your father all these years.”

Tuyết returned to her seat next to me. "May I ask… How did your father pass?" she asked after a moment.

"Cancer," I replied. "It was... quick, at the end."

Tuyet nodded, a knowing sadness crossing her features. "I'm not surprised. We didn't fully understand the horror of Agent Indigo back then," she reflected. "We all suffered from its consequences, not just those directly caught in its flames. The fumes, the contaminated water... Hell, your dad and I waded waist-deep in that stuff! It seeped into our skin, into our blood, mutated us on a cellular level.”

The weight of her words hung in the air.

"It was years before we understood the full scope of the devastation," she continued. "Spikes in cancer cases, stillbirths, and birth defects... The government eventually caught on and declared the area a disaster zone. My family, along with many others, had to resettle here in Hội An."

Tuyet's gaze was piercing, as if she was trying to read more into me. "Have you... have you experienced any health complications?" she asked.

"Other than asthma, I've been okay," I replied

"Consider yourself lucky, then," Tuyet said softly, seeming not to believe her own words.

After a long pause, she asked, "Would you like to meet Nhân?"

—

Tuyet and Duyen led me upstairs, the wooden steps creaking softly under our feet. As we ascended, Tuyet shared more about her life and Nhân's. "For the longest time, I thought I’d been spared the worst of Agent Indigo's effects. I’ve never been sick a day in my life," she said. "Nhân grew up healthy, strong... He had a good life."

Reaching the top of the stairs, we paused at a door at the end of a short hallway. Tuyet lingered at the doorway as she continued. "It wasn't until he was in his forties that we noticed changes. It started small—forgetfulness, mood swings—but it got worse quickly."

Tuyet's eyes started misting over. "Duyên's mother... Nhân's wife... she passed away in a tragic accident a few years before that. I had to step in to help raise Duyên and put her through school.”

Duyên braced herself as she opened the door, her expression turning grave. The strong, unsettling stench of decay washed over me the moment the door creaked open. It was a smell that spoke of something deeply wrong.

Duyên called into the dimness, her voice wavering slightly. "Dad, someone is here to see you.”

A shadow stirred in the far corner of the room, the figure barely discernible in the scant light that filtered in through the drawn curtains. My heart raced as I stepped closer, my eyes adjusting to the darkness, revealing the figure of a man tied securely to a chair. Nothing could prepare me for what I saw next.

Nhan’s body bore the unmistakable signs of severe mutation: skin mottled with tumorous growths, limbs twisted in unnatural angles, and eyes that glowed with a feral, unsettling light. Agent Indigo had consumed him, leaving behind a grotesque shell of the man.

His head snapped towards us as we entered, the sound of the chains rattling against the chair's arms. The snarl that escaped him was chilling, a sound no human should make, filled with pain and rage and an insatiable hunger.

Fighting to stifle a scream, I steadied my voice, trying to reach whatever part of Nhân might still recognize kindness, or perhaps even family. "Nhân, I'm Spencer. Your... I'm your brother," I stammered.

At the sound of my voice, a low growl emanated from Nhân's throat, a sound that cut through me like a knife. His restraints creaked as he strained against them, his jaw snapping viciously in the air between us.

Duyên stepped beside me, her presence a small comfort. "He has his moments of clarity, but they’re becoming fewer and fewer," she explained softly, her voice heavy with unspoken sorrow. "It's been hard on us. But we manage, day by day."

—

That night, after a subdued dinner, Duyên showed me to a small bedroom on the ground floor they had set aside for me, its windows offering a view of the garden under the moonlight.

I settled into the small bedroom, the weight of the day pressing down on me. The moonlight spilled across the floor, casting shadows that seemed to dance with my tumultuous thoughts. My phone buzzed with an incoming video call, a welcome distraction. It was Mira.

"Hey, what’s up?” I greeted her.

“Nothing much,” she replied, her smile brightening the screen. “I just missed seeing your face.”

“Aww, I miss you too, babe,” I say, longing for her comforting embrace.

"So, how did it go with Tuyet?" she asked.

The question hung heavily in the air. I hesitated, unsure of how to navigate the truth of my encounter with Nhân. "It went great," I lied, forcing a smile. "She's... she's really something."

Mira's smile widened, but before she could respond, her expression shifted, a hand instinctively cradling her belly. "Oh, wait, you've got to see this. The baby's kicking like crazy."

She adjusted the phone, pointing the camera down to her belly. Watching her, the warmth of the moment was overshadowed by a sudden, sickening sense of dread. The revelation of Nhân's condition, the mutations, and the dire possibilities they represented loomed large in my mind.

Could the baby in Mira's womb be a ticking time bomb? Had I inherited the same mutation that had ravaged Nhân and passed it on without knowing?
