Before I update you, I wanna give a little bit of context real quick. In my last post I said things continued as normal after everything that happened. This is true, but I want to add that our group as a whole has gradually stopped hanging out as much as we used to over the last few years. We used to hang out every week, but now we usually hang out once a month or sometimes less. This is not because of anything in particular, that’s just how it is when you get out of high school.

I also wanna add that Mikey has been normal since then. The only time he acts weird is when anyone mentions the banana man, in which case he just tries to change the conversation.

The last time I saw Mikey was about a month ago. I texted him the same day I made the last post to ask if he had any more of those dreams since the first one. I told him about the second dream I had as well, which I haven’t shared with anyone before I made that post. The next day he called me.

“Hey Mikey how’s it going?” I said as I answered the phone.

“Listen to me Ian. I don’t want to talk about the stupid banana man. It’s not a funny joke and it’s gotten really old. Can we just forget about it?” He sounded irritated.

“Okay yeah sure, sorry man,” I said softly.

“Alright, goodbye,” he said with a sigh before hanging up the phone.

I felt pretty stupid at that moment. Obviously I was overthinking it all. We made a silly joke and we creeped ourselves out somehow. I decided then that I wouldn’t make a follow up post… but obviously I’ve changed my mind since then.

A day later, Mikey called me again. The moment I answered the phone, he spoke.

“Ian! I’m so sorry about the other day, I was having a bad day. We’ve gotta hang out! Are you free later?”

I was taken aback. I thought for a moment.

“Oh, uh, yeah I don’t have any plans. What’s up?” I asked. I figured he must’ve had a reason for sounding so excited. He usually calls me with enthusiastic ideas when he wants to hang out.

“Not much, but I’ve got to show you something. You’re gonna love it!”

“Okay sure! Just let me know what time” 

“I’ve got some errands to run so I’ll text you in a bit, see you later!” He sounded ecstatic, and then hung up immediately.

I felt relieved. Turns out he wasn’t as annoyed as I thought.

Later that day he texted me. It said “Meet at my house at 8,” which I thought was a bit late, but not too unusual for a Saturday.

I got there right on time. I parked on the street in front of his house as I usually do because his parents park in the driveway, but his parents weren’t home. I figured they would be coming home eventually.

I walked up to the door and noticed the lights in the house weren’t on. Then I knocked.

He opened the door within just a few seconds.

“I’m so glad to see you!” He said as he opened the door. His eyes were practically glowing and his smile stretched across his face.

“Hey man, how’ve you been?” I said, still standing in the front step.

“I’ve been great! Come in!”

He stepped out of the way, holding the door open for me. I walked inside and looked around.

“Dude it’s so dark in here, why don’t you turn on some lights you weirdo?” I joked.

“Oh sorry, I’ve got a migraine right now,” he said plainly.

“Oh okay. So what did you want to show me?” I asked curiously.

“Oh right, follow me!”

His enthusiasm was contagious. I couldn’t wait to see what he was talking about. I imagined he would show me an awesome video game that would postpone our sleep until the morning.

I followed him through the living room, into the hallway, and watched as he opened the door to the basement. Immediately I got goosebumps.

“Wow, I haven’t been down there in a long time,” I said, waiting for an explanation. He said nothing as he stepped through the door.

Reluctantly, I followed him down the staircase and into the dark and empty room. I turned my head to see him already walking into the hangout space. I took a deep breath and rushed over to join him. I didn’t want to be alone in that abyss of a room.

It was just as I remembered it: the futon, the cot, the messy computer desk with a couple empty chip bags on top, the small square window, and all were illuminated by the dim light of the computer monitor. I felt a pang of nostalgia, despite my discomfort. Mikey was sitting down on the futon. I took a few steps into the room.

With a bit of hesitation I asked him, “What made you want to come down here again?”

He smiled at me and simply said “I’m ready to talk about it.”

My skin crawled. The way Mikey was acting could only be described as unusual. He never wanted to talk about it, so why now? After two years?

“Talk about what?” I asked, despite the fact that I knew what he meant.

“You tell me,” he said, the smile slipping away from his face.

“Hey, are you feeling alright?”

The stretched smile quickly returned to his face, as though he hadn’t realized it went away.

“What are you afraid of Ian? Didn’t you want to talk about it? Ask me anything you want,” he said as he stood up, staring into my eyes.

Something came over me at that moment, a feeling of unease was filling my stomach. I thought about the doorway, the solid black void that was waiting behind me. I thought about that dream.

“Mikey I don’t feel good at all,” I said as I slowly turned around. My eyes met with the featureless black wall.

“SAY IT.” Mikey’s voice boomed behind me with a rage I’d never heard from him before.

I jumped as the words pounded my eardrums. Then came a familiar feeling: I was frozen. I heard him slowly stepping toward me. Somehow I could feel his eyes on me, I could feel that sickly forced smile just behind me.

“Say… it…” he whispered.

I said the only word I could think to say.

“No.”

Still I felt frozen, facing into the abyss. There was silence for what felt like minutes. Then I heard something I’ll never forget, something that’s been burnt into my mind, and something I’m still trying to process even as I write this. Something I could only describe as the sound of peeling.

This was enough to break the spell. I dashed into the darkness, up the stairs, out of the house faster than I could comprehend. I don’t remember much, I just remember driving much faster than the speed limit and leaving that place behind.

I texted my friends Jason and Liam as soon as I got home. I told them something was seriously wrong with Mikey, something I couldn’t explain. I didn’t dare to mention the banana man, I knew they wouldn’t take me seriously. I told them that no matter what happens, no matter what Mikey says, do not go over to his house. I told them to call me the next day.

That night I was deathly afraid to go to sleep. I dreaded seeing that doorway again and facing that thing. I was haunted by the thought that I could already be dreaming.

Surprisingly, I never had one of those dreams that night. I didn’t sleep very well, however. I stayed up waiting for the dream to come, and thinking about what was happening to Mikey. Was it even Mikey I saw at all? If not, where was he?

The next morning, Liam called me.

“Ian what’s going on? You sound crazy, you sure I don’t need to check on Mikey?”

“Please dude, whatever you do, do NOT go over there. He asked me to come over and I did, and he wasn’t acting like himself. Just give him some space, please,” I begged him.

“Okay man just keep me updated, you’re freaking me out.”

I waited the rest of the day for Jason to call. I called him a few times, and he never answered. That was two days ago.

I’m not done with this yet, far from it. I’m posting this as an update in case anything happens. I’m going to find out what happened to Mikey, I’m going to find Jason, and I’m going to put an end to the banana man. God damn it, I hate calling it the fucking banana man.
