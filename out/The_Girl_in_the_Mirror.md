I've never been one who has been afraid of the paranormal, more curious or skeptical over anything. Until something paranormal happened to me. Back in 2015 I had moved out for the first time with my then boyfriend. The apartment was a bit older but we had fallen in love with it. I could tell right away that the place had a heavy feeling to it but I chalked that up to being nervous about the move. 


But things started to happen right away that i will never forget. Every night since moving in I would have these dreams, it was always the same. I would dream I was laying in bed and then I would see it in the corner. A dark figure would appear from behind the curtain. I never saw it's face, just it's hands. Long thin fingers would grab the curtain and slowly start to pull the curtain open. I was not sure what it was but I knew what it felt like and it felt cold and it felt inhuman. As soon as it would start to step out from behind the curtain I would wake up sweating, paralyzed with fear. 


Because of these dreams I would often be up at night roaming around the house to avoid going to our bedroom. That's when I started to see her..to hear her. To get to our bedroom you have to walk to the end of the hall and at the very end of the hall was a mirror. She appeared to me shortly after my dreams started. It seems she would only show her self before I would go to our bedroom. I would only ever see her in reflections but I was not afraid of her and I knew she did not want to hurt me. But I could feel she was afraid herself. She would never look at me, or look up in general. Her long brown hair would always cover her face as she looked down. She never would go down the hallway and would be gone as soon as I turned around to look at her. If I ignored her reflection I would hear her call to me. Calling my name. It was almost as if she was trying to pull me away from entering the bedroom. 


These nightly events would lead me to what happend on my last night there. That night I went to bed early as my boyfriend stayed up to play games. Half asleep and a bit groggy I was woken up by my boyfriends hand as he placed it on my waist. I could feel his hand press harder and harder into my waist and that's when I heard it. My boyfriends laugh coming from the other room. My eyes quickly opened and that's when I saw her. The woman who would never go down my hallway, was at my bedroom door. Looking straight at me. That's when she spoke to me. "Run". I felt those long thin fingers grab ahold of me. I tried to jump straight out of bed but the more I tried to run the harder it pushed me down. I could hear it growl in my ear. I knew at the moment that it wanted me to look at it. It wanted me to give in. I was able to break free and ran towards the door. As  soon as I ran through the woman, she screamed. A blood curdling scream so loud it hurt me ears. I fell to the floor  as my boyfriend ran down the hallway. I asked if he saw the woman and he told me "no, I just heard a scream". 


I knew at that moment I had to leave. I never went back to that apartment. I moved out as fast as I could. Since the day I left I have never had so much as a nightmare. I believe the woman was appearing to me to try and save me.
