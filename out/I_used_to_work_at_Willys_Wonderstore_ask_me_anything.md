Hey, r/nosleep , suppose you didn't expect activity from this account, but I suppose, that expectation is broken now.   
I will state in advance, no, this is not Nate, nor is it Sarah, this is Kyle. Yes, \*that\* Kyle, the one Nate described like a bad stereotype and you all labelled as weird. Frankly, I hate that he described me that way, but I think, if I can type out my thoughts and experiences onto this forum, I can make it more understandable why I acted the way I did and also explain what's happened, including why I'm posting from Nate's account. 

You can find the posts made by Nate and Sarah here, by the way.

**- Introductions and Explanations**  
So, where to start... well, first off, hi, I'm Kyle, used to be the ADM before Nate. Yes, I am gay, though I hardly see why that was mentioned as one of my personality traits by Nate, frankly, always found the kid weird. Was born in the 90's, so I got to live life a bit more... harshly, then him or his friend Sarah. 

Nowadays, I live my life in an apartment paycheck to paycheck, taking all the work I can, was why I ended up at Willy's Wonderstore, when I'd blown my career of two years at the local lawnmowing business. Had turned up drunk to the job, was a shit bloody time, was a major alcoholic, currently still recovering. 

I've been with Willy's Wonderstore since around 2016, way earlier on. Being in my mid thirties now, it's hard to think I've wasted a near decade in that shithole. Originally I was janitorial staff, as we'd have our own janitor team that also dealt with moving around stock for specific departments (bags for checkouts, totes for deliveries, cleaning projects for deli and bakery). Ended up with the front end team around the three month mark, which was when I'd been on a near year of sobriety. 

I think Rebecca stopped me from spiraling, when I signed up, she immediately took interest in me, guess she saw some similarities between me and her husband, Craig. (Nice dude, killer moustache on him.)  
Didn't take long for me to get transferred and to get an increase in hours, with me becoming one of her favourite workers despite my slower pace of scanning. 

Customers apparently liked me too, though I was never asked to work Graveyard Trading Hours until the fourth year, when I was well and truly sober for nearly five years. I can remember it still, how she'd deflate and become dull if anyone mentioned that shift to her, especially David, the store manager. 

As Nate noted, I'd been ADM for ages before him, had been doing the closing at late night for about four years when I was demoted- which I will add, I requested for. Couldn't take it, four fucking years of it all. 

It's not much, but that's most of my background for my time at the store, just being the recovering alcoholic who was best buddies with the golden girl of the checkouts. Did occasionally pull some pranks on my coworkers, but those were purely harmless, far less extreme than what Nate described.  

Suppose then, I should explain how I got onto Nate's account. Simple answer is, I got into it via Sarah, after she vanished. Yes, that is correct, Sarah is also missing, both her and Nate, for the past five months, have been put down as missing persons cases. 

Yet, how do I have this account? Well, I was messaged by Sarah, presumably before she went in, I'm guessing, something about bad connection on her phone, both a post she'd written up and the password and username for the account. If she's dead, then I was given this as her parting wish, yay. (I'm being sarcastic.)



**- The "Consumers"**  
Frankly, I find the name for these things stupid, what Nate called them, but honestly, it works. Consumers, yeah, them. So, people were theorising that they're aliens or something of the like... Truth be told, I wouldn't be surprised, but I don't know, frankly don't care about that explanation. 

What I \*do\* care about, though, is how to get rid of them. At least, to scare them away or to placate them. If you yourself encounter them, maybe this can help, if I'd been in a better state of mind, I'd have given Nate the same advice.

Firstly: Don't acknowledge them, they'll leave quickly if they just go through the lanes rather than the express counter. Otherwise they do what the rubber neck psycho and the maga creature did.  

Secondly: They love products, but when they start to take more animalistic forms, it is best to simply let them pass through, eat a few items, knock some stock off the shelves. It is better than what happened to Nate with the Pigeon- lucky bastard, glad he didn't get one pretending to be a dog. 

Thirdly: DO NOT LET THEM IN BEFORE OPENING. They must be supervised by at least a member of staff entering and exiting, or else they can get up to who knows what. 

Fourth: If they keep talking about being hungry, won't go away, stay calm and leave the store via the back entrance, they will chase if you're afraid. 



**- Sarah and Nate**  
I don't know where Sarah and Nate are, but it seems that David has done something with the footage and evidence of their disappearance, Jason too, as I could have sworn I've seen him once or twice driving Sarah's Ute. The pair of them are covering up whatever they've done to them both, or what happened to them.   
Seems that the police are looking the other way, as any attempts made by Nate's mother to find out what happened to him has gone nowhere. I feel bad for the woman, but at the same time, not like I can do much for her, unless I find out what's happening.



**- Ask me anything**  
Unlike Nate and Sarah when they were on this account, I will try to answer messages and questions. I'm definitely going against whatever NDA I signed under David's pressuring, but frankly, I think everything I have experienced to be known to all of you. 



That's all for now, I'll see you all whenever I next post, stay safe and have a good rest of your week.  
 \- Kyle.
