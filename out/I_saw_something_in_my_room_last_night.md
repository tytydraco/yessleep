I know how this subreddit goes, everything is real and blah blah blah... But I don't know where else to share this. What happened to me is 100 percent real though, I swear... I can't stop thinking about it, and now that nightfall is here, I can feel my heart racing knowing that I have to go to sleep soon. If I see whatever it was... In my room again, I don't think I'll ever sleep right again. I'll just jump in and share my experience.

Recently I had to move in with my dad. I found out my girlfriend was cheating on me and I just can't forgive that. We had just bought a house together in her name (I know, I'm a fucking idiot) so obviously she's keeping the house. 

Last night I was getting all my stuff situated in my room, preparing for my first night away from old home, my old life. It was around 9 p.m. and I had to be up early this morning for work. My room is pretty small, my dad's house is small in general but the spare room is tiny. I have a loveseat that folds out into a bed, so I can have more room when I put the pull out bed away. Anyway, around 9 o'clock I pull out the bed and turn my t.v., which is maybe a 2 feet from the edge of my "bed". I surprisingly fell asleep pretty quickly. Right around 2 a.m. I jolt awake from a noise.

"Hey"

I heard a voice whisper loud enough that it woke me up. I shot up in bed confused, my brain still half asleep. My t.v. was on stand by mode emitting a soft blue light in the room, other than that it was blackness. 
I look around the room, still wondering what woke me, when I look towards the t.v. my heart slammed in my chest harder than it ever has. Right to the left of my t.v. I saw an old man's head leaning out from behind it. I stared in shock, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. My tired brain tried to rationalize what I was seeing. I was focusing as hard as I could to see if maybe I had a sweatshirt hanging that just looked like a person. Nope, there's nowhere to even have a sweatshirt hang back there.
So I sat up in my bed and looked a little closer, still fully believing I'd see a sweatshirt or something there that was playing a trick on my eyes, making it look like an old man. Obviously that wasn't the case, I could just see more detail now that I was closer. I could see the receding hairline, the patchy beard, his bulging eyes... He wasn't looking directly at me, he was staring intently at the floor next to my bed. My heart rate quickened as I realized this wasn't a trick of the lighting or something, this was real, and it was 3 feet away from me...
I dove for the light switch as fast as I could and flipped on the switch. There was nothing there. I scanned the room for anything out of the ordinary but saw nothing. Everything looked normal. 

"Hello?" I foolishly asked at nothing.

Obviously I didn't get an answer, but I wasn't really expecting to. Needless to say I couldn't fall back asleep after that, I was so on edge that I decided to just stay awake the rest of the night. I'm a 35 year old man that isn't afraid of the dark, at least I wasn't... But I had every light turned on for the rest of the night. I jumped at every noise I heard and my head was on a swivel. I was relieved when it was time to start getting around for work. Once I got to work I went straight to one of my coworkers, named Russel.

"Dude do you know what the fuck I saw last night!?" I half whisper/half yelled.

"I'm so sorry dude, it's been driving me fucking crazy! It's the only way to get it to go away!" He was almost crying.

He told me the day before yesterday he's been seeing something strange in his room at night, every night... 

"What do you mean your sorry?" I asked somewhat confused.

"It's the only way to get it to leave you alone, to pass it on to someone else..." He said sheepishly.

I was so mad I shoved him and walked away. All day at work I debated telling someone else about it, but I didn't have the heart. I love my coworkers, we're like a family, I couldn't do that to any of them. So to everyone reading this I'm so sorry... If you see it in your room tonight, turn on your lights and stay awake, that seemed to work for me. Then tell someone else about it and it should leave you alone, well at least for my sake I hope so...
Again I'm very sorry...
