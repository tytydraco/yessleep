Today, I can finally deal with what’s been happening for the past 6 weeks. Now that the horror I’ve lived has been unmasked in its raw truth, I can make sense of it.   
  
Someone has been living with us.  
  
An unwanted guest, wandering in the rooms and peeking from the dark corners of our house. Watching us, skittering away from our sight, running across our home on its bare feet.   
  
Deep down, I’ve known since the moment it first occupied our home. I knew from the night I had seen it slipping in behind my husband. Uninvited. Unwanted.  
  
I’ve been living with Jacob for over 4 years. For 3 of these years we’ve been married. He didn’t share much about his past, I didn’t ask more than what he was willing to share. He’d been married. A complicated, maybe abusive relationship with a strange woman, Amalia. She was an archeologist somewhere in the country. He didn’t tell me specifically why they divorced, but he did tell me he ran far away from her.  
  
Jacob and I met on tinder. We dated for a while, and eventually married. We just clicked, despite the fact I knew there was a shadow hiding part of his history before we met. I was ok with that, because he told me what I believed was the most important part of his past, that he’d been married already, on the day he proposed to me. That’s when we agreed to never speak about it again. After all, I had my skeletons too.   
  
Right from the beginning, he showed to be a caring man, eager to build a life with me. He showed me a kindness I wasn’t used to. He was good, the best I’d had.   
  
Until that night. The night of the peeking eyes.  
  
Jacob was late that night, and I was just sitting on the couch, thinking of work. I was numbly looking at my reflection on the window.   
  
That’s when two yellow eyes appeared behind the dark glass. I started, fell back on the couch and shook my head. The eyes had disappeared, leaving the window to retake its space of darkness and only show my reflection.  
  
“Jacob?” I whispered, not letting the window get out of my sight. I knew Jacob wasn’t home. But I just couldn’t make sense of what had happened. What had I seen? Those eyes seemed to be floating at a height too low for a human. Unless someone was on his knees. Was someone just sitting in my yard and peeking through the window?   
  
I finally heard the welcomed tingling sound of the keys and the steps on our doormat. Jacob stepped in the house. He looked at me, suddenly scared by the fear in my own eyes. And I was ready to run towards him and hug him, tell him of those damn yellow eyes. But I didn’t.  
  
Because right behind his tall figure standing in front of the open door, someone, something, had slipped in right under my sight. It was quick enough I couldn’t make sense of it. A shadow. A small figure, perhaps hunched over. And it disappeared, in the direction of the kitchen.  
  
I screamed. The image of the small eerie shadow possessing my mind again. The idea of whatever that was now hiding somewhere in the house quickly widened my eyes and the depth of my scream.   
  
We ended up spending the night in the hospital. Panic attack. With hallucinations, as Jacob eagerly confirmed to me after he’d spoken with the doctor. Because sure as hell no dwarf, small creature, or creepy shadow had just slipped into our house behind my husband.  
  
We came back home the day after. I tried to convince myself that the image that kept playing on a loop in my mind, a not-so-human small shadow quickly slipping into our house, was just a hallucination. But I kept seeing that… Thing and its strange and not very human walk. I kept seeing it entering our home, as if it had been invited, knowing exactly where to go.  
  
“Where was it now?” I found myself wondering a few nights after, my eyes wide, stuck on the ceiling. I stood up to go get a glass of water, wandered to the kitchen. The hot summer night was quiet, our house was new, so I hadn’t yet learned of any weird, cracking or creepy sound it might hide.  
  
As soon as I closed the fridge, I heard it. A low, yet very clear  and steady sound. Something gripping my spine with a feeling I couldn’t quite grasp. Something human and yet not belonging to this world. Certainly not to our house.  
  
A cry.   
  
Someone was crying, an unworldly, uninterrupted cry. The cry of… A baby? The sound was muffled, like a recorder was just playing it from inside one of our closets or cupboards.   
  
I stood frozen for a few seconds, before I ran to our bedroom and woke up Jacob, shaking him with an urgency that immediately startled him awake.  
  
“Wha– Sarah? What’s happening?”  
“Do you hear it?”  
“Hear what?”  
  
The sound was even louder now. It got closer, as if it had followed me in the bedroom. I wandered with my eyes trying to locate the source. Until I did. The closet. I slowly shook my head and looked at Jacob. And I wasn’t sure about it back on that night, but I’m sure beyond any shred of doubt today: that night, in the dim light getting through the curtains from the street’s lamppost, I just caught Jacob looking at the closet as well, in some sort of dumb amazement.  
  
“You can hear it,” I told him, not a question. He denied.  
“I’m just trying to understand what got into you, Sarah. There’s nothing, it must be the str-”  
“Don’t tell me it’s stress!” I raised my voice now, “someone is fucking crying.” My voice did sound crazy as it echoed in my head. ”It’s a baby… How don’t you hear that? LISTEN!”  
  
My voice shaky but convincing, we fell quiet in the dark. At that moment, not a single sound was coming to our ears. He caressed me, pulled me back into bed and hugged me all night. I couldn’t sleep, but I didn’t hear any other sound that night.   
  
I kept staring at the closet in front of our bed.

It was only a week after I realized I hadn’t dreamed anything. It was real. Something was happening to our house, or at the very least to my brain.  
  
That night we had dinner at home with Tom and Paul, our neighbors. As soon as they left, Jacob and I sat on the couch to watch Indiana Jones. When I’m stressed I like to rewatch movies that remind me of my childhood. Movies I know by heart. It’s soothing.  
  
I woke up just for the last 10 minutes of the movie, next to a snoring Jacob, the lights of the TV dancing on his face. I reached for the remote, Jacob’s sleeping legs resting on my lap. I started rewinding the good 45 minutes I’d slept over. I was groggily staring at the scenes I was so familiar with now playing backwards.  
  
The pale face looked at me behind the lights the TV was projecting on my face.  
  
It was just behind the right corner of the TV, at its same height. A pale face, small, heavy eyes. The face seemed to be hoovering in nothingness. It was a sad face, but it looked alive. It was staring at me with deep yellow eyes. I didn’t scream, I was just dumbfounded, stuck on that pale face in the dark corner of the living room. The tiny, soft lips were deformed into silent gape. The yellow eyes were shaped by a sadness so deep it had become their nature. Black curly hair was falling across a white and smooth, perhaps sweaty forehead. Then the pale lips moved to pronounce something I couldn’t make any sense of.  
  
“*Mom.*”  
  
The voice was soft, a whisper. I just kept staring, unable to set my lungs in motion to breathe, let alone to say anything. The full figure of what I knew was our unwanted guest came out from behind the TV with a strange hesitation, and showed itself for what it was: a… Baby? Or… Some form of it.   
  
I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It most definitely looked like a baby, way too tiny to stand on its feet. Yet, there it was. It was a small figure, a deformed head, too big for the tiny body that was wrapped in ripped clothes. All over the body were ugly, black bruises. One of them covering his right cheek, surely the reason why its mouth was falling open in an unsettling bending gape.  
  
“*Mom*.”   
  
The creature repeated, in the same sorrowful tone. It kept walking, with visible impediment, toward the couch I was sitting on, Jacob’s legs still on my lap. Only then did the baby move its tiny neck for the first time, turning towards Jacob. Its eyes had changed, they’d opened. They were not sad anymore. It looked like they’d come to life with a fierce passion that couldn’t be mistaken, despite how unnatural it looked on the face and body of a baby. It was hate.  
  
That’s when I finally managed to scream. I stood up so quickly Jacob started and fell off the couch. I turned to him, and then back to where the intruder had been standing. Only he wasn’t there anymore. I heard the sound of tiny feet now apparently running towards our bedroom.  
  
“What the hell?” Jacob asked in his groggy voice. “What are you doing?”  
“He was… He’s here! It’s a-a baby! I-I saw it!” I replied, shouting, still in shock.  
Jacob seemed to hesitate for a second. “Jesus Sarah,” he stood up, looking at me in a different way than usual. He wasn’t concerned for my mental health as before, he wasn’t scared either. He was angry. Why was he angry?  
  
He kept looking at me, while I stood shivering in the middle of the living room. He carefully took the few steps that divided me from him. His look softened as he slowly opened his arms to invite me into his hug. And I was about to get there. But then I saw something that stopped me. Right before I took a step, just for a fraction of a second, both his eyes quickly moved to look at something behind me. I saw the white of his eyes return to me right after. He hadn’t just looked over the room to assess it, his eyes had gone to find something.   
  
They’d gone to something, or someone, [behind me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lost_Whispers/)
