About two years ago, two weeks from today, I had woken up in the middle of the night. It wasn't for any particular rhyme or reason, no cold sweat, nothing out of the ordinary. I took a sip of water and looked out the window that was next to my bed. 

I had tugged the curtains open more than they normally had been, and peeked out, expecting it to just be a normal dark, dingy street, with nobody awake except for maybe a squirrel or mouse.

Directly across the street from my house, just in the middle of the yard, a man was sitting on a lawn chair, with a beer and a telescope. 

I was never one to judge, so I didn't, at least at the time. As a young and naive 13 year old girl, I just thought he was stargazing. One of my friends dads was going through a stargazing phase at the time so I had been exposed to it previously, and thought almost nothing about it. 

Looking back on it, especially with what happened and what I had noticed following, he wasn't stargazing. 

After seeing him 'stargaze', I had just laid back down in bed and went back to sleep. By the next morning, it had essentially escaped my mind. 

About a week later, I was at the store with my mom when I walked into the next aisle and saw him. He had looked surprised to see me, but I gave a smile and wave anyways. 

My mom had walked in after me and made some small talk with him, while I had zoned out, looking at all the different candy options in the aisle. 

Later that night she had explained to me that he was a teacher at the local high school, the one I would be going to. At the time, I was excited, when I went to high school I would see a familiar face. 

About a month after that, I was walking along the sidewalk, when he ran out of his house with Watermelon gummies in his hand. I had perked up, half expecting them to be for me, as I was always asking my mom for them but she would never give them to me. 

So, you can probably imagine my extreme excitement when he stopped in front of me and held them out. 

I asked him if they were for me and what I remember most of that time was how disgusting his breath was. It was hot and smelled sour. I shook off the initial shock and snatched them from his hand. 

He put his hand on my shoulder and squeezed it. He was talking about how much of a great kid I was, how obedient I was. 

That was the first time I felt like his behavior was odd, being the longest, and only, conversation I'd had with him. 

I said my thanks for the candy and immediately left back to my house. I shoved it under my bed and thinking back on it, it's still there. Whatever. 

I also hadn't told my mom about it. Maybe I was thinking too much into it. It was just a nice man who gave me candy, so what if he was a bit touchy? 

Over the past two years, that had been the only conversation id ever had with him. The most we've interacted is him giving me a smile and I hesitantly wave back. 

Also over the past two years, I've seen him in places I'd never seen him before. Places like the mall, the park, places where a grown man should not be. I've also started looking out my window more. I no longer assume he stargazes. I am certain he looks at me. 

I wasn't originally going to talk about this, but I had gotten my high school schedule yesterday. 

I'm in his class. 

School starts in a week.
