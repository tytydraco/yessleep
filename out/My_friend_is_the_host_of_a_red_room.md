For context, i dropped out of college, and my mom kicked me out, and i needed shelter to thrive in any way.

I called all of my friends, who backed down and I was left alone, on the streets.

Only if amanda hadn't-

Me and amanda were best friends. "Besties", shall I say.

I get a call one day from her mother, and tells me that she had gone missing.

2 days later, her body was found dumped in a river, her body mutilated to the extent it was no longer recognizable.

It was nearing night; the sky was painted a crimson red and i wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.

Suddenly, my phone dings.

One unread message from Blake

I opened the message, and looked at it curiously.

What was blake doing, chatting with me?

Hey.

What are you doing?

What should I say?

I mean, it's been almost 2 years since no contact and, he's messaging me now?

What the hell?

'Hey.' I say.

'How's life been?' He asks.

I told him all about my situation and he seemed pretty nice for someone who cut contact from me for no absolute reason.

'Well, you can always come to my house.' He says.

Okay, hear me out;

I have no shelter, No food available right now, And i was starving.

'Fine. But i've never been to your house.'

I text him.

'It's ok. My parents are okay with that. It's just that- my house is too disciplined.'

'Wdym?'

'You'll see.'

'What are you talking about?'

'Do you want to stay in the streets?'

'No...'

'Yeah, i thought so.'

I looked at my balance- 0.83 dollars.

'You're gonna have to pick me up. I'm broke as hell.'

'Fine.'

It was nearing night then, the sun an exclamation point in the crimson red skies, and then, just then, i hear a whirring.

I turn back, and i see blake, smiling, and i walk closer to the door and i open the handle and get in the car.

We drove for a solid 15 minutes until we reached a house that looked nothing short of a mansion.

It was adored and decorated with blue paint, it's roof a mind tingling yellow (Now that i think of it, it kind of hurt my head)

I look at the rearview mirror for a moment and then i see a book.

It was plated in- rubies? No- it was- Silver?

Silver, yes. It was coated in silv-

'Well.' Says blake, waking me up from my trance,

'We're here.'

I close the door of the car, and walk towards his house.

I haven't ever seen his home- but the mere outline of it was enough to convince me that they were, infact, loaded with money.

Blake rings the doorbell, and a  two middle aged couple opens the door for us.

They smiled at me; I smiled back- It was very awkward, but i didn't have time for awkwardness here, i needed a shelter to live in.

'Blake's told us all about you.'

 The woman, who i assume to be blake's mother, was very- nervous, to say the least. She kept shaking her fingers- this was usually something did- She doesn't even look like she's in her 50s. Both of them look really young.

Ofcourse, he had told me that they had married very young. His father was 19 and his mother was 17. Both of them kicked out.

Both of them lead me upstairs, and i get a glimpse of three separate rooms.

In the middle of them, there was a notice on one of them.

Do not enter here.

Mold present.

'Yeah. I mean, the house is very old, and we don't want any deaths, now, do we?'

Blake's dad says, and gives a strained laugh.

'Well my dear, that there is your room, and that's blake's room right there.'

That night, i lay on my bed, just starting to enter the world of dreams when i hear a scream from the other room.

I was scared. A robber? A murderer? What is going on?

I open the door of my room, and as i stand in the hallway connecting the three rooms,  i realized the scream was from the room that had the mold warning on it's door.

My heart froze. I didn't know what to do. I could just unlock it... Or leave it alone..

No. You should help. Open the door and help her. 

The voice in my head spoke.

That was when i heard footsteps coming from downstairs, and right then i knew to get the fuck out of there.

I ran to my room, locked it, and pulled myself under the covers, waiting, breathing in my own carbon dioxide. My heary was beating so fast i thought it would burst out of my chest.

I had to do something.

And i will.

Tommorow was normal, and during the evening blake told me that he had to leave for work.

I didn't believe it. I don't believe this family. They might be, or even they are, sadists. Do they kill people? Oh dear god, I think i've gone mad. Bear with me.

I made the decision that today, i will investigate blake's room.

I have to save whoever screamed that night.

After making sure that his parents were asleep, i headed to blake's room.

As i opened the door, i saw a computer and a mic.

Huh.

I looked and scanned through the room, and i saw the book that i saw in the car laying in the bed.

The pages of the books were full of notes. 

Horrific Notes.

All victims for this year;

Sadie Whitehurst-Catched

Amanda Joels-Catched, Posted video to website

Stella Davies- Not catched

I kept staring in disbeilief at the last two names.

He killed my best friend and was planning to kill me.

So- the scream i heard- it was- Sadie wasn't it? 

I rushed to the other room, and burst open the door.

There was hundreds of monitors there. The room held an eerily red glow, and i saw cameras, aiming directly at a large glass box.

Inside, covered in blood, there lay the bodie of sadie whitehurst. I was about to throw up when i realized.

I have to escape from here.

Surprisingly, it was pretty easy. I packed all my stuff and ran away from that wrechted house.

But today, I got a message. It was from blake.

;)
