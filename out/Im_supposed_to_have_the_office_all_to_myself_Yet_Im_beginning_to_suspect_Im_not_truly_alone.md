When I reported for my first day of work, the office looked nothing like I expected. The route was a desolate series of winding, narrow dirt roads. In the pre-dawn gloom, my headlights strained to illuminate the otherwise unlit path that stretched through scenery that probably looked gorgeous in daylight.

The installation ahead of me appeared out of place, like a standard low-rise office building had been lifted from a city center and dropped into the middle of a national park dozens of miles from the nearest major highway. It had an uninspired, angular appearance. It looked remarkably clean and untouched by the surrounding nature, especially in contrast to the vines and ivy that extended from the dense woods to cover patches of the dilapidated walls of the security station and old-timey cabins I’d passed on my journey.

The parking lot had only one car, a dusty sedan by the main entrance. I took the spot next to it and, carrying my work bag, approached the glass door.

In the reflection, I saw my long, curly hair and the sharp black skirt suit I’d donned. My face, despite my best efforts, betrayed the exhaustion from the long, early commute. I was just grateful to have a job after months of unanswered applications and stressful dead ends.

I entered an empty security station. It had everything you’d expect - monitors, metal detectors, scanners - but no employees.

“Hello?” I called, when nobody emerged to greet me.

I called again. A gravely voice answered, “Coming!” At the far end of the room, a middle-aged woman with unkempt black and gray hair and a dark blue jacket appeared. She held an ID card to a reader. A green light flashed. The doors opened.

As she neared me, she rolled a wheeled suitcase behind her. “You must be Amanda,” she said, extending her hand.

“Nice to meet you,” I replied, shaking it. “And you are?”

She ignored me as she fished through the pockets of her jacket, her suitcase dropping to the floor with a ‘clang.’ “Just a moment,” she mumbled before removing a second ID card, which she handed to me. I took it. It displayed my name and picture. “You’ll be needing this,” she said. “Don’t lose it. Can’t open the door without your badge.”

“Understood.”

“The payroll system automatically records when you swipe it to enter and exit. So, if you want your paycheck, make sure to swipe in by your start time, and to not swipe out until your end time. Anyway, I have to get going.”

This made me a little confused. “Um, I guess I’ll go inside and meet the rest of the team.”

This prompted a single, sardonic laugh from her. “You haven’t heard?”

“Haven’t heard what?”

“Everyone else is laid off. Whole building. I’m here to grab my last few personals, and to give you your card.”

“*What*?” I exclaimed, shocked.

“Yep,” she nodded. “You’re the lucky one. The morons carrying out these reductions missed you because your materials were in administrative limbo during the security check. Those behind you in the onboarding process had their offers rescinded. Those already onboarded were let go. But you slipped through the cracks. Don’t worry, I didn’t tell anyone. Now, you’ve got the building to yourself.”

“I…huh? The whole building?”

“Yep.” She picked up her suitcase and dragged it past me. As she reached the door to the outside, she added, “My advice: keep your head down. Don’t cause any trouble. With any luck, nobody of any importance will notice that you’re working here. Best of luck, Amanda.” With that, she loaded her belongings into the sedan and departed.

\~

Dumbfounded, I placed my purse and briefcase by a desk in the corner of a large room full of open offices. It was a sunny spot, with long windows on two sides that provided a pleasant view of the surrounding woods, and it had the same type of computer as all the others. I considered taking an enclosed supervisor’s office, but that somehow felt even more isolating.

As I booted up the computer and entered the login credentials, I sat back in my chair and tried to comprehend what was happening. I never could have imagined that *everyone* else in my building would be laid off. I thought about just how devastating the news must have been to the many people who would otherwise be my co-workers.

And where did that leave me? I still had a job, but, from what the woman had told me, that was only due to a fluke. One peep about me to the wrong members of leadership, and I’d get canned, too.

I tried to process the insanity of this situation. All my expectations of gaining experience and making connections would go unrealized while I would be stuck in an isolated, empty office.

*This is a blessing in disguise*, I told myself. *Think about all the people who wish they had a bigger office, or freedom from deadlines and supervisors.*

I opened my email to find form messages from HR about several mandatory training courses. Putting my concerns aside, I set about completing them.

When I finished the trainings, I had nothing else to do. No assignments, no emails. Was this what every day would be like?

\~

I set about exploring the building. The main level had a marble central corridor that connected the entrance door to a series of private offices, two bathrooms, a kitchen, two fire exits, and several openings that led to the open main work area.

A sheet of paper displaying several emergency numbers for fire, electrical, and security services hung next to the entrance. The women’s bathroom was in relatively good shape, though it looked like it hadn’t been recently cleaned. The kitchen was cramped and gloomy, with a flickering overhead light. A stack of paper birthday plates sat sadly on a large table. From the lunchboxes, canned drinks, and frozen meals in the refrigerator, I inferred everyone had been let go with little warning. The crumbs on the floor and empty plastic bottles in a bin meant no custodian would visit soon.

I took the elevator upstairs, where a walkway overlooking the main floor stretched from end to end. It connected to a series of individual offices that were nicer and larger than the ones below, though just as empty.

The elevator displayed three “B” levels, where I assumed the labs were located, but it wouldn’t travel to any. I found a door near my desk marked “Basement Main Access,” which opened to a barren concrete staircase. A sickly yellow bulb cast gloomy light over the windowless stairwell, giving it a spooky appearance that compounded my isolation. I decided exploring the basement could wait.

\~

As the afternoon stretched on, I called my friend Winona. We’d been close since high school, and we’d even kept in touch during the years she’d spent deployed overseas in the military. She presently teleworked a part-time tutoring job from the apartment she shared with her boyfriend Tommy, and she tended to not mind calls from me during the day.

When I explained my situation to her, she was as astonished about it as I was. “It’s so weird being alone here,” I confided. “I keep thinking about all the conversation and meetings and laughter that used to fill this place. Now it’s all gone, and I’m all that’s left.”

“I’d be *so* freaked out if I were you,” she replied. “Especially with how far you are from, like, everything.”

“I know,” I said. “But a job’s a job. If I don’t get work, maybe I’ll take online courses or apply to other jobs as a fallback if I’m discovered.

“You should try to relax,” Winona said. “At least for now. *So* many people would kill for a situation like yours. Embrace it. Bring books to read, or find a way to watch something you like. Or, better yet, set up a profile on a dating app like I’ve been saying. With this much time on your hands, you’re officially out of excuses.”

I chuckled. Winona always said I hadn't dated since Michael broke up with me two years ago, and I used to say I was too busy. Now, I had all the time I needed.

\~

For two weeks, I drove the same lengthy route, swiped my card at the front door, and logged into my computer. Time and again, I had no assignments or new emails beyond general announcements. When my first paycheck arrived, I was ecstatic.

I spent much of my time following Winona’s suggestions. I finessed my resume, applied to new jobs, enrolled in an online accounting course. The remainder of the days I spent reading, listening to audiobooks, setting up dating app profiles, and jogging around the building to stay in shape.

The first strange thing happened during my third week. I’d just set up a date with Alfred, a software engineer I met through an app. We agreed to meet at a restaurant that night. I'd gotten Winona's approval, as she was more savvy about these situations. The whole process of meeting someone through an app made me anxious and uncomfortable, so I decided to settle my nerves with a snack I’d packed for myself and left in the kitchen. Only, when I got there, it was gone. My entire lunchbox, in fact, was empty.

My first thought was that I’d left the food at home. But how absent-minded could I have been to not only forget to pack it, but also take an empty lunchbox?

This bothered me, but I shrugged it off. In my rush to leave for work, I must have left the food at home. Excited for the date, I soon forgot about it and pushed through my hunger.

The date went well. Alfred was a little reserved, but polite, and he seemed not to judge my hungry self for eating a hefty meal. I liked him, and we made plans to meet again.

The next morning, as I packed my food for work, I noticed that there was no extra meal in the fridge. So, what happened to yesterday’s lunch?

There has to be a reasonable explanation,” Winona told me. “Maybe you forgot to make it. Or you ate it and don’t remember. Neither sounds likely, but what’s the alternative?”

“I don’t know,” I said, as I sat back in my office chair and admired the view outside. “This place is just so eerie. It’s like, I can sometimes sense all the people who used to occupy it. I feel like they’re watching me sometimes.”

“I’m *sure* it is eerie, Amanda, but no spirit of a laid-off employee ate your lunch, if that’s what you’re suggesting,” she scoffed. “Don’t be ridiculous.”

“You’re right,” I sighed. We shifted our conversation to my second date with Alfred, a carnival that Sunday evening.

\~

After carefully laying out the used plastic water bottles from the kitchen recycling bin, I took the spherical “Outstanding Leadership” trophy, which had once been attached to a plastic pedestal, out of one of the upper floor offices. I rolled it across the marble central hallway, delighted when it knocked over eight makeshift pins.

I set everything up again. This time, I took a video when I released the trophy, bowling a strike. I flipped the camera to capture my little cheer and sent the video to Winona.

*OMG*, she texted me back. *Using your time productively, I see*. I giggled. *Got to pass the hours somehow*, I shot back. *Might as well have some fun :)*

A few minutes later, Winona responded again. *Amanda, is there someone else in your office today?*

*What? No. Why do you ask?* I typed back.

I waited, perplexed, until my phone buzzed. Winona had sent a screenshot from the end of my video, my victory dance. *Look above your left should, in the distance*, she wrote.

I zoomed into the area she described, which consisted of the glass window on a supervisor’s office. At first, I didn’t notice anything unusual.

Then it hit me: the glass reflected a blurred, faint image of a *face*. It seemed to subtly shift and waver, almost like a ripple on water, but I blamed the poor lighting and the angle. It was hard to make out, but I could vaguely discern a long nose, a square chin, and a pair of sunken, dark brown eyes.

My pulse instantly quickened. *What the hell?* I texted her back. “Is someone here?” I called out, my voice echoing in the vast, unoccupied space. No one responded.

I grabbed my belongings and headed to the exit. I considered calling the emergency ‘security’ number or leaving early.

*Maybe it’s just an illusion?* Winona texted me. *Hopefully I’m freaking you out over nothing.*

Hopefully she was correct. If I called security, that could lead to the consequences I feared.

*Don’t be the horror movie dumbass*, I told myself. *Just leave*. But I also wanted to deal with this. What if it was nothing, and I ended up risking my only source of income for no reason?

I turned and faced the main corridor, where I’d just been bowling. Nothing seemed amiss. Taking a deep breath, I called Winona.

“Yeah?” she answered.

“Look, um, I’m going to try to figure out what happened. I want you on the phone with me.”

“Of course!”

“Good.”

I took a few tepid steps toward the office where we’d spotted the reflection. When I reached it, it was completely empty. Nervously, I turned to the office *across* from it, where whatever had been reflected in the glass would have been located.

I burst out laughing. This office had posters on the wall and pictures on its desk. Someone had left their personals behind. The posters were of scientists - I recognized Albert Einstein - and the pictures were presumably of the former occupant’s family.

I explained to Winona the reflection we saw must have been from one of these images. “Sure, but do any of them look like the face in that reflection?” she asked. “Not really,” I conceded. “But, the reflection was so blurry I can’t tell for sure. Anyway, it makes the most sense compared to any other explanation, right?”

“Yeah,” she said, though I sensed skepticism. “I’m sure that’s it.”

\~

Alfred and I’s second date was even better. We’d stayed out late doing clichéd things - he won me a stuffed animal, we took a boat ride, and sat on a Ferris wheel. As our compartment ascended, I held my breath, and sure enough, he kissed me! We became ‘that’ couple kissing passionately as our car rotated. If anyone minded, nobody brought it up. When I got home around midnight, my heart was too full to settle, and it wasn’t until hours later I went to sleep.

Naturally, this resulted in me fighting to keep my eyes open at work the next day. Fortunately, I didn’t have any major tasks. After swiping into the building and sitting down at my desk, I leaned back, closed my eyes, and let exhaustion consume me.

My phone awoke me sometime later. It was Winona, asking how my date went. I yawned drowsily, took a few sips from the bottle of water on my desk, and called her back.

We talked for a bit as I recapped my evening with Alfred. “You’re making me want to puke,” teased Winona. “Y’all are too damn cute. So what’s next with him?”

“We’re meeting at my place on Friday night,” I related.

“Oh my gosh!” said Winona. “I’m *so* excited for you. It’s about time you spent the night with a crush.”

“What is that supposed to mean?” I shot back defensively. “He isn’t necessarily-”

She interrupted playfully. “Oh sure, you invited him over for a chaste night of formal conversation and mild flirtation. How indecent of me to imply anything further might occur.”

“Oh whatever,” I nagged, as I took another sip of water. “We’ll see what happens.”

Just then, I felt a soft bump against my neck. *What was that?*

Whirling around, I saw something floating slowly before hitting the ground. It was a paper airplane. “Jesus Christ,” I muttered, jumping to my feet and, in my panic, dropping the water bottle.

“What’s wrong?” asked Winona.

“Someone threw a paper airplane at me.”

“But you’re all alone, right?”

*“Hello*?” I called out to the empty room, my voice once again echoing. “This isn’t funny! Who are you?”

I glanced everywhere - the upper walkway, the desks, the empty offices - and detected no signs of life.

“No response?” asked Winona.

“Nope.” I bent down to pick up the airplane. Made from notebook paper, it had words crudely written in blue ink: ”*Bad match*.”

As dread coursed through me, I realized something worse: I hadn’t brought a water bottle to work.

\~

I ended the call with Winona and grabbed my belongings. On my way out, I took the sheet by the door and, once at my car, called the ‘security’ number.

“Ma’am,” the gruff-voiced man answered, “so you’re telling me someone threw a paper airplane at you, gave you a bottle of water, and maybe ate your lunch?”

“Yes, but it’s not like that.”

“These aren’t exactly felony offenses, ma’am. Had the water been tampered with?”

“I don’t think so. When I opened it, the cap snapped, like it hadn’t been opened before. And it tasted normal.”

He paused. “So, you’re sure you want us to send someone all the way out there over this?”

“**YES**,” I stammered. “Someone is stalking me. *Please*, take this seriously.”

“Alright. Stay put. We’ll have a park ranger there soon.”

\~

I stayed in my car, eyes focused on the entrance, foot on the accelerator. I was ready to speed off at the first sign of the creep.

Finally, an unmarked car with a siren pulled up. The uniformed officer, bright blue eyes in his mid-thirties, stepped out. He had a gun holstered at his waist. He tapped on my window, which I lowered.

“You Amanda?” he asked in a deep voice.

“Yes.”

“Officer Jackson,” he replied. “I’ve been briefed on the situation. Want to let me inside?”

\~

“Well?” I asked, when he emerged a half hour later.

He shook his head. “No trace of anyone else.”

“You looked everywhere?”

“Yep,” he said. “Look, ma’am, I think you’re telling the truth. But like I said, I couldn’t find anything. Not even the paper airplane you mentioned.”

“I can’t *believe* this,” I muttered, exasperated. “You must have missed it.”

“Ma’am, you’re welcome to go look yourself. There’s not much more I can do right now, but anything else happens, let me know, and I’ll come right over. Do you want me to file a formal report?”

“Of course.”

“If I do that,” he added, “the people who own this place are going to find out. Is that what you want?”

I let out a moan. This was such bullshit. I wasn’t ready to alert leadership to me being here, to this whole situation. Not before I found a new job. “Forget about it,” I uttered, frustrated.

\~

I arrived at work the next day with a can of mace in my purse. Before sitting down, I reversed my corner desk to face the opposite direction, giving me sight of the open office area, anyone heading towards me from the ground level or the nearby basement staircase. When I used the restroom, I took the mace.

I spent the day immersed in my job search, broadening my horizons by submitting applications to positions I previously would have overlooked. All the while, I remained vigilant, regularly scanning my surroundings for any signs of life.

A few days passed without incident, and I started to calm down. Yes, someone had creeped me out, and for all I knew, was still hiding. But the officers had made valid points: my stalker hadn't done anything to harm me. If they'd wanted to, they could have done it already.

I wondered who this person was. A former employee? A vagrant? How long had they been here, and what did they want?

\~

“*A little help?*” read the subject line that popped up one morning on my work computer on Thursday morning.

I sat up straight as soon as I saw it. This was the first personalized message I’d received in my workplace account. The sender had a Gmail account: “EdgarG” followed by seven numbers.

The message read, “*Good morning Mandy! Emailing you from my work phone as I left my ID card at home. You mind letting me in? -  Edgar.*

My first thought: who *was* this? Obviously someone who didn’t know me well - I didn’t let *anyone* call me Mandy.

I gripped the mace as I tried to think through the situation rationally. Maybe this was just some sick game by the person who’d been spying on me. Or, maybe…

I typed back, “*Good morning. As I do not know you, did you intend to send this to someone else with a similar name? Best of luck getting into your office."*

The response read, “*This isn't funny, Mandy. We’ve been work buddies forever! I know it’s not protocol, but can you please open up for me? I don’t want to go all the way back home to get my card. - Your friend Edgar."*

*Shit*, I thought. There was something *seriously* wrong with this person. Why would he be pretending to know me?

I walked to the front of the building and peered outside. Nobody seemed to be there. A little spooked, I returned to my desk.

That’s when a loud *thud* resounded, causing me to gasp in surprise. It came from the window  next to me. Whatever had been thrown had been heavy, as a small dent in the glass marked the point of impact.

I leapt to my feet. For a brief moment, I saw a figure retreat into the treeline outside. I only got a brief glimpse, but it appeared to be the same person as before with a square jaw and those same longing, deep brown eyes. His face seemed to shimmer, an unsettling distortion that I dismissed as a trick of the light or my own fear.

After that, a flurry of emails arrived:

*“Just trying to get your attention! You coming?*”

*“You’re being awfully rude Mandy. You know I’d let you in if you forgot your card.*”

“*Mandy - I thought we were friends. What happened?”*

*“Hello? I’m still out here. You’re really going to make me go home?”*

*“After all we’ve been through, I thought I meant something to you. I guess not.”*

*“You bitch. This is not okay, and this isn’t over.”*

*“I’m going to get back at you for this, Mandy. You just wait.”*

\~

I dialed the same number for security. To my frustration, nobody picked up. I tried again, with the same result this time. I left a frantic message before dialing 911.

“Let me route you to the nearest park rangers’ office,” said the operator.

“I already *tried* that,” I complained.

“They’re the ones who can best assist you,” she continued, overtalking me. Before I could protest, I heard the call transfer and a familiar ringing. I hung up.

Winona was more helpful, at least once I calmed down enough to clearly explain what was happening.

“The way I see it,” she advised, “You need to leave. We already know that this creep has some way of getting inside, so you’re not safe there. Make sure the coast is clear and, if it is, get in your car and go.”

“What if he’s, like, hiding, waiting for me?”

“That’s why you’ll want to take the pepper spray with you. Don’t hesitate to use it.”

\~

I kept her on the line as I made my way to a second-floor office and peered out a large window overlooking the parking lot. It appeared empty, aside from my car. Seeing no one, I proceeded to the main entrance. “I can do this,” I told myself before swiping my card to open the door to the security room.

Immediately, a dark, hulking figure emerged from behind the security station.

“Fuck you!” I roared, activating the spray.

\~

Officer Jackson emerged from the bathroom nearly an hour later, face wet and red.

“I’m so sorry,” I told him, still wondering what he was doing here.

“I’ll be okay,” he said. “I’m trained on this. I just need a bit more time to recover.” He’d uttered plenty of expletives after I sprayed him. Fortunately, I’d only gotten off a little before he swiped my arm away, sending the bottle to the ground.

“Again, I’m sorry.”

“Don’t worry about it. You’re just looking out for yourself.”

I wasn’t sure what to say. I didn’t expect him to be this polite, especially considering the excruciating pain I’d just forced him to endure.

He explained he’d been returning from an emergency when dispatch informed him of the message I’d left. He was already in the area and decided to check on me, parking in a small lot behind the building. He was heading inside, in the publicly accessible security room, and about to call me when I ran into him.

For my part, I recounted the creepy emails from “Edgar G.” Officer Jackson had many follow-up questions, including if I had anyone in my life, like past romantic partners, who might hold a grudge. “No, no,” I said. “My only ex, Michael, would never do something like this. And I *saw* the guy, and he’s not anyone I know.”

He jotted down the physical description I provided. “So, we definitely have a persistent stalker. We’re not sure what he wants or if he’s a threat. Look, Amanda, how about you stay home tomorrow? I’ll devote the day to investigating, okay?”

\~

My phone rang around 3 p.m. “I got him,” said Officer Jackson.

A wave of relief swept through me as he described what happened. A man named Lucas had been living off the grid in the national park intermittently for years. He occasionally snuck into buildings, including mine. “His point of entry,” Officer Jackson explained, “was a fire exit carefully wedged open from the outside. I’ve secured it. I don’t know what he was messing with you about, but my arrival last week spooked him back to the woods.”

“And the emails?”

“He stole a cell phone from a hiker. Decided to harass you. Probably held a grudge for you calling me. We’ve got him booked on trespassing and illegally residing in the park. He won’t bother you again anytime soon.”

*“*Thank God*,*” I said.

“It’s my job, ma’am. All in a day’s work.”

“It’s okay, I’m just glad it’s over. And, sorry for macing you.”

“Maybe you can get me a drink sometime,” he chuckled. “Look, if you ever need anything, or if anything creepy happens to you again, you know how to reach me.”

\~

After that, things felt like they were turning around. Alfred and I had a splendid date Friday night. He stayed over, and I slept soundly in his arms. Come Monday, I pulled into work feeling everything was on the upswing. For the first time, I felt secure, even turning my desk back around to face the beautiful view outside.

“*So*, you texted me things went well with Alfred,” said Winona, when I called her in the late morning. “But I want more details!”

“Like what?” I jested, knowing exactly what she was fishing for. “I told you: we had a nice dinner, and he made breakfast for me in the morning.”

“I’m more curious about what happened between those two activities,” Winona retorted.

“We had a pleasant time, and that’s all I’m telling you.”

“Oh God, you’re really going to make me work for it, aren’t you?”

I feigned offense. “What? I would never do such a thing.”

“I’m assuming you smooched?”

That made me giggle. “You assume correctly.”

“And then…”

“I’m not telling! But, I will say he was *very* good at it.”

“At *what*?” she pried.

“Winona, don’t you have work to do?”

She groaned. “Did you two, you know…”

“I *don’t* know!”

“Sleep together?”

I paused, letting the question simmer. Then, abruptly, I giddily blurted out, “Yes, and it was awesome, and I’ve got to get back to work, bye!” I hung up, a proud smirk on my face.

\~

By Tuesday afternoon, my ecstasy had soured slightly. I’d had a challenging job interview that morning and, worst of all, Alfred hadn’t responded to me since I’d seen him last weekend.

“I’m fearing the worst,” I confided in Winona. “What if it was all an act, and he’s gone now that he got what he wanted?”

“I wouldn’t worry,” Winona assured me. “From what you told me, he’s not the kind of guy to sleep with you and then ghost you. I’m sure something came up. You’ll probably hear from him tonight or tomorrow.”

“I’m sure you’re right,” I said.

My cell phone buzzed with a new call. “Someone’s trying to reach me, Winona. I’ll call you back.”

\~

That night, Winona and I met up to celebrate. I had another job lined up, though it wouldn’t start for a month. My current job had upsides: no work or annoying co-workers. But I needed to develop skills and make connections to progress in my career. I also needed to get out of this creepy building and out of a job that could end at any moment if leadership noticed my existence.

When I arrived at work the next morning, I was nursing a slight hangover from drinks with Winona. I drafted emails to HR, explaining I’d accepted a new position and giving them my last day.

My day passed slowly. I read a chapter, took a short nap, and made progress in the accounting course. Near the end of the day, I got up to use the restroom one last time before the long drive home.

When I returned, my phone, ID card, and car keys were missing from my desk. “What the fuck,” I whispered to myself. Meanwhile, emails popped up on my screen, from the same “Edgar G.” as before.

*No*, I thought. Wasn’t this guy in jail? Regardless, how did he have access to the same account?

The emails were written in the same style - just a sentence or two each:

*“This is the last straw, Mandy. Getting a new job without even telling your trusted colleague?”*

*“Don’t worry, Mandy. I didn’t do much. Just a friendly prank to even things out.”*

*“Come and get it.”* This last message included two photos: one of room B315, the other showing my ID card and phone on a small table wedged between a closet door and coat rack in the room’s back corner.

*“Fuck,”* I hissed. Officer Jackson must have arrested the wrong person. I was a fool to think I’d be safe here.

Perhaps it was just a prank, at least in the twisted eyes of my tormentor. My stalker hadn’t actually harmed me. Maybe if I went to the basement - which I’d avoided - I could retrieve my belongings, leave, and never come back.

But, fuck that. I wasn’t eager to march into harm’s way. I opened the phone function on my computer.

“Officer Jackson,” he answered.

I explained the situation. “Okay,” he replied. “Wait where you are. I’m heading over now.”

“How far away are you?”

“Not far.”

“Should I try to find a way out? The main door won’t work, but I’m sure I could use one of the fire exits.”

“Negative,” he replied. “The fire exits are all locked.”

“Wait, what?” I said, flustered. “Why are they locked? And, if you knew that, why didn’t you tell me?”

“Let me ask you a question,” he said, “do you recall how you got this number?”

“*What?*” I asked, noting his deflection. “I dunno. On the sheet by the door?”

“Well Mandy, what if I told you the same person who’s been stalking you put that sheet there? And, what if I told you each number listed on it went to the same phone?”

My jaw dropped as a nauseous feeling fell upon me. He hung up. A moment later, the lights went out.

Before my mind could process, I heard his voice say, “*Told you’d I’d be here soon, Mandy.*” Only, this time, it came from several yards in front of me, from a corridor connecting the main hallway with the central open office area.

My eyes adjusted to the darkness to make out that a figure in a police uniform. I recognized his long nose and sunken, dark eyes.

Then, something strange happened. His face…changed, its skin shifting around and contorting. His hair changed color, his nose shrank, and eyes lightened from dark brown to bright blue. Now he looked like…Officer Jackson?

“I wasn’t going to wait down there for you forever, Mandy,” he taunted. “I’m tired of you playing hard-to-get. I think it’s time I come and take what’s mine.”

Survival instincts kicked in. Before my thoughts caught up, I leapt over my desk. He nimbly sidestepped, blocking me if I tried to run around him.

But I wasn’t trying to get behind him. If I was going to get out, I’d need the items he’d taken - the items supposedly on a desk in room B315. Instead, I shoved open the nearby basement door and scurried downwards.

\~

I flew through the air, nearly losing my balance. As I descended, I saw, for the first time, entrances to levels B1 and B2. "Biolab 1" was affixed next to the former, and "Biolab 2" next to the latter. Through each glass door, I glimpsed a clean, well-lit hallway, its walls lined with a mounted fire extinguisher and ominous safety warnings.

B3 was labeled “Storage & Sanitary.” I rushed inside. Unlike the two floors above, the lights were off, except for a single flickering bulb at the far end outside a room I recognized from the pictures “Edgar G.,” or Officer Jackson, or whoever he was, had sent me.

For a moment, I settled my nerves enough to pause and listen. It occurred to me I hadn’t heard my pursuer behind me. Was he even following? Or did he know another way down?

I remained uneager to walk into what I was sure was a trap, especially with no guarantee my phone, keys, and ID would still be there. But, I also knew I was helpless without the items he’d taken - no way out short of breaking a window, no way to drive, and no way to contact authorities. And, it’s not like anyone would be looking for me anytime soon. The only alternative was to hide, but I couldn’t do that forever. I pressed onwards, hand outstretched ahead in case obstacles awaited in the shadowy corridor.

Finally, I reached room B315. Just as in the picture, my missing items sat on the small table, illuminated by a bright desk lamp.

I scanned the room. It was plain and largely undecorated. A small set of lockers and two wooden crates sat on one side, a closet on the other. As far as I could tell, the coast was clear.

I stepped forward. As I reached for my belongings, my foot hit a small string, which snapped. *Shit*, I thought, realizing I’d activated a tripwire trap.

The closet door, triggered by the broken string, burst open. I screamed as a bulky male form fell out. Its weight sent me tumbling.

At first, I assumed it was Officer Jackson. But a horrifying sensation fell over me: it was worse - it was Alfred, dead.

“Oh God, no,” I whimpered, crawling from under his corpse. He had deep gashes throughout his back, as if hacked by a long blade. Taped to his shirt was the paper that had flown into me a week earlier, with “*Bad match*” still displayed.

I didn’t have time to mourn. I jumped to my feet, grabbed the items, and scrambled back to the hallway.

“*Mandy*!” called Officer Jackson’s voice from the unlit far end of the hallway. “Got you good, didn’t I?”

I inferred he'd been pursuing me after all, just not bothering to run. He wanted me to fall victim to his prank.

I weighed my options. I could try to get past him, but I didn’t like my chances; he had a gun. Instead, I darted into the room directly across from B315, hoping to find a temporary hiding place until I could sneak past him.

It was a mostly-empty storage room. In its center stood an arched wooden structure covered in flowers. I snuck into the closet behind it.

I gasped. It smelled disgusting, and I quickly realized why: another dead body. It was covered by a plastic bag and propped against the wall. Oh God, I thought, realizing who it was. Jesus Christ, this guy had murdered fucking Michael, of all people. What the fuck? Why?

I slipped behind Michael’s body, continuing to fight against the urge to puke as I did so. I heard the door open as Officer Jackson stepped inside. “Mandy! You in here? Come on out already. Like I said, I’m sick of playing games with you. We were just getting started.” I listened to him pace about the room.

I held my breath as he opened the closet door and peered inside. “Big mistake,” he said, my heart dropping. “Breaking up with her. I may be upset with her for the moment. But she’s a quality lady. Shouldn’t have let her go, Michael.” He closed the closet door, and I felt as much relief as someone in my situation possibly could.

Officer Jackson opened the door back to the hallway. “No more hiding in the dark, Mandy.”

Brightness beamed as he flipped on the lights. It took my eyes moments to adjust. I continued to listen, hearing footsteps, then a closed door. The sounds became muffled and distant.

Recognizing the opportunity, I shoved Michael’s corpse aside, sprinted out of the storage room, and re-entered the hallway. As I hurried back toward the staircase, I realized, to my shock, that the walls were *covered* in photographs of me.

Me working, stretching, reading, napping. *Lots* of me napping, with the camera right in my face. It was as if, every day since I arrived, he discreetly shot a new photo album of me.

I didn’t have time to feel even more horrified. I just kept running.

*“Like my work?*” he called, just as I pushed open the stairwell door. A rumbling followed - the sounds of his heavy form dashing after me.

I didn’t trust myself to keep ahead of him. This man was a schemer, having thought ahead enough not to let me win easily. So, when he finally opened the main level door, I was waiting with a fire extinguisher from B1.

I slammed it, as hard as I could, into his face. It was a perfect hit. Blood flew as the blow sent him sprawling.

I didn’t wait to see how badly I’d hurt him. Instead, I dropped the extinguisher and frantically hurried to the main entrance. My card worked, the door opened. I flew outside, hopped into my car, turned on the engine, and zoomed away into the night.

Winona and Tommy let me move in with them for the next several weeks. I couldn’t be alone.

I met many times with police officers who confirmed I’d been hoodwinked into calling a fake security number. They quickly identified the likely culprit as an Edgar Garrison, who’d briefly worked at the facility as a test subject. Records showed that one of his trials had lingering, long-term effects on his appearance, sparking a lawsuit from him that was ultimately dismissed.

During that time, Edgar developed an attraction to a female lab technician. When she didn’t reciprocate his feelings, he turned to stalking. He was eventually fired for it. After that, he’d gotten a gig as a local park ranger but was quickly fired for attempting to use his authority to continue stalking her. The uniform I’d seen him wearing was one he’d failed to return upon his removal from the job.

“He continued to spy on her even after losing both jobs,” an officer explained. “There was a defective back door that he’d use to sneak in and out. When she, along with everyone else, got hit by the latest layoffs, he seems to have shifted his obsession from her to you.”

The police also discovered diaries he’d kept in the basement, which established he’d developed a fantasy about winning me over by protecting me from men who wanted to hurt me. “I’ll be her knight in shining armor,” he wrote. “I’ll keep her safe from those unworthy, and she’ll love me for it.” He created some of the very problems from which he then ‘rescued’ me. When he learned I got a new job elsewhere, he snapped and decided to make his move before I departed from his hunting grounds. His plan…I don’t want to go into it in detail, but it involved drugged food, a ‘wedding’ under the altar I’d stumbled upon, and a room secured by multiple locks.

Edgar hadn’t been seen since that night. “Don’t worry,” the officer told me. “We’ll catch him.”

Winona and I arranged a week-long backpacking trip, aiming to escape the grief and guilt I felt regarding Alfred and Michael, as well as the endless police visits. We both posted our hiking route on social media, along with images of sites visited during our drive to the trailhead.

That first night, we camped close to the road. After setting up our tents, we discreetly snuck out to the designated lookout point where we unpacked the equipment.

Through night vision goggles, we waited patiently for hours. Sure enough, the skulking figure of my nemesis eventually appeared. He had a knife in one hand, a flashlight in the other, and a pistol holstered at his waist.

“Time to end this?” Winona whispered, handing me the loaded gun she’d been training me with.

“I think it is,” I whispered back as he slowly unzipped the tent door. We only had moments before he discovered the figures we’d left in the sleeping bags were mere props.

“You know I’ve got your back if anything goes wrong,” Winona assured me. I nodded and gave her hand, which gripped her rifle’s barrel, an affectionate squeeze.

Taking a deep breath, I emerged, stood tall, and walked confidently. The last thing he saw, as he spun around and went for his gun, was the laser sight aimed at his bandaged forehead, followed by two quick flashes of [light](http://www.reddit.com/r/peacesim).
