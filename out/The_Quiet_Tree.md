  
Recent events have forced me into a kind of reckoning, sifting through the fractured memories of my freshman year of high school. Until now, that time in my life felt like a scattered collection of half-remembered moments, disjointed and unreliable, like an old tape that’s been recorded over too many times. Moving back to my hometown three years ago didn’t stir up much—at least, not at first. But something has changed. Something has resurfaced. And though my therapist insists I should keep these thoughts contained, I need to put this into words. I need someone—anyone—to tell me I’m not losing my mind.

Before I get into my own memory of that first week of high school, I need to explain the town. I call it my hometown, though we didn’t move there until I was five—Danny, my older brother, was seven. Still, it’s where I spent my formative years, where most of my childhood memories live. For a long time, those memories were warm ones—of my mom, of Danny, of a time before everything changed. I won’t share the exact location, but it’s a small town in South Eastern Kentucky, the kind of place that sits quiet on the map, unremarkable to outsiders. And yet, for reasons I can’t quite explain, people there seem to have an uncanny amount of luck. That’s what brought me back. Or at least, that’s what I’ve been telling myself. 

I remember the summer before my freshman year—three families in town won the lottery. One of them hit the Mega Millions. It wasn’t just them, either. No one ever seemed to struggle for long. Layoffs never led to foreclosure. Bills always got paid. If someone wanted a job, they got it. My mom, a single parent, landed a management position in the next town over, one that made raising two kids on her own seem almost easy. Looking back, I should have questioned it more. But at the time, it just felt like life was... charmed.



With all that in mind, things took a turn not long after my first week as a ninth grader. One memory stands out—meeting someone else who was new to our high school that year: Mr. Hendrickson. He was our history teacher, fresh to town like I was fresh to high school.

I remember that first Friday when he took our class out by the track field. The late-summer air was thick and heavy, the kind that made everything feel sluggish. We gathered near a tree that I hadn’t really noticed before.

“Do you guys know why this is my favorite place to relax during lunch?” Mr. Hendrickson asked, scanning the group with a small smile.

Liz Dillenger spoke up before remembering to raise her hand. “Isn’t this tree new, like you?”

“Remember to raise your hand, Elizabeth,” Mr. H chided gently, though his tone stayed light. “That’s a good guess. But I don’t think this tree is new. A tree this big doesn’t just pop up out of nowhere.”

He paused, glancing up at the thick branches as if reconsidering his own words.

“This is a white oak,” he continued. “It’s more relevant to my junior-year class—since they study U.S. history and their curriculum is a little more specific—but I think you guys might appreciate knowing a little about it too.”

Everyone sat still, waiting for him to get to the point. I noticed Liz wasn’t even paying attention anymore. She leaned back on her palms, eyes tracing the spidering limbs above her, as if searching for something hidden in the tangle of leaves. The pink ribbons she always had in her hair, dangling towards the ground.

“Some Native American tribes believed the white oak was sacred,” Mr. Hendrickson said. “The Celts… Are any of you Irish or Scottish?”

A few of us raised our hands.

“Very good. The Celts believed the oak was the king of the forest,” he continued. “Here in North America, the white oak is a symbol of peace and calmness. If I can find a tree like this one—” he reached back and placed his hand against the trunk, though his eyes remained on us, “—all the noise goes away. I can sit in silence and revel in the quiet.”

Liz Dillenger scoffed but didn’t say anything.

Mr. Hendrickson gave an exaggerated frown, almost cartoonish, like a sad clown, before slipping back into his usual jolly demeanor.

“Regardless of what you think about all that hooey,” he said, giving the trunk a light pat, “this is an old, quiet tree. And when school feels like too much, I guarantee you can come here, sit for a while, and return to level.”

I’m not going to lie—I thought it was a really weird thing to say. But we didn’t have anything else to do for the rest of class, so I liked it. It beat sitting in a stuffy classroom, anyway.

What I didn’t like was how all the girls in class flocked to Mr. Hendrickson while we waited for the bell to ring. I remember overhearing Liz tell one of her friends that he looked like *Brad Pitt with Dahmer glasses*, and in some primitive, *me-make-fire* caveman way, I saw him as competition for every single girl in the school.

Of course, nothing ever came of it. The chomo accusations never surfaced because Mr. H was always dismissive of the girls' flirtations. He kept his distance, kept the conversations school-related, and never entertained anything inappropriate. But the real absurdity came that weekend.

My house wasn’t far from the school. If you laid it out from east to west, there was the middle school facing east, a small field with a few playgrounds, the high school football stadium, and then the track—separate from everything else, with the high school right next to it. A long stretch of open field and a quiet residential road ran in front of it all. My house sat facing that road.

That Saturday evening, I was sitting in the living room, watching my brother Danny and one of his newer friends, Jaden take their turn facing off in *Mortal Kombat 4* on our PlayStation. Then something outside caught my attention.

Through the window, I noticed Elizabeth Dillenger sitting on the other side of the track field, just a few yards from the treeline, right at the base of the small sloping hill that housed the white oak Mr. Hendrickson had shown us. There was no mistaking Liz—she was the only girl who hadn’t upgraded her wardrobe for high school, still wearing the same pink-and-white outfits she always had.

But the man standing with her?

I couldn’t tell who he was.

In my defense, I’d grown up with Liz through elementary and middle school. I knew her—knew her posture, her habits, the way she stuck out without meaning to. And, for the record, it was the year 2000. So before anyone calls me out for recognizing *her* from 200 yards away but not the grown man standing with her—she was wearing a stupid fucking pink fedora.

Yeah. A *fedora*.

I’m glad that style died.

What I’m *not* glad about is what happened to Dillenger in the weeks that followed.

At the time, I brushed off what I’d seen as absurd and focused on something *really* worth my frustration—losing to my brother at *Mortal Kombat*.

Fuck Scorpion. Fuck his teleport move. Fuck my brother for memorizing every damn combo and *never* picking another character.

After hours of abusing jump kicks and being bitterly defeated, Danny and Jaden took a smoke break, and I followed, overseeing as little brothers do. As we stood by the shed, the memory of Liz sitting by the tree resurfaced, gnawing at the edge of my thoughts.

“Hey,” I said, breaking the lull, “either of you got U.S. History with Mr. Hendrickson?” I remembered he taught two junior-year courses, so there was a chance.

Neither of them did, but Danny mentioned that Phil Brooks—one of his mutuals from his lunch table—had him. “Why?” he asked, exhaling smoke into the night air coughing dryly.

I gestured vaguely toward the track, as if they could somehow see through the shed, through the house, to where that damn tree stood. “That old oak out by the track,” I said. “Hendrickson gave it some weird praise, but—when the hell was it ever *there*?”

Jaden cut in before Danny could respond. “Nah, don’t go near that tree,” he said, shaking his head. “Gives me the creeps. Definitely wasn’t there before.”

“You sure?”

Jaden didn’t even hesitate. “Since when do multiple teens suddenly *notice* some random old-ass tree, and none of the teachers say a thing about it?”

That Sunday, I kept turning it over in my head—the idea that a tree could just *appear* out of nowhere versus the more rational explanation: it had always been there, blending into the treeline with a hundred other unremarkable trees, and I’d simply never noticed it until Hendrickson brought us to it.

Monday passed.

Tuesday passed.

Wednesday.

Liz was irritable. Not just her usual kind of snippy, but *off* in a way that I noticed immediately. Maybe she’d been like that the past two days too, and I just hadn’t paid attention. The bags under her eyes were darker than usual. She moved sluggishly, but not in a lazy way—in a *weighed down* way, like she was dragging something behind her that no one else could see.

Hendrickson stopped her on the way out of class. I remember his warm smile as he asked if she was alright. Liz nodded, muttered something back. I might’ve caught what she said if I hadn’t immediately embarrassed myself by tripping over my own feet and eating shit right there in the hallway.

Thursday.

Liz was *tweaking*.

She looked worse—worse than just sleep-deprived. It was like she was running on something beyond exhaustion, wired and aware in a way that didn’t make sense. I felt like everyone else was brushing it off as typical 14-year-old behavior—pulling all-nighters, being dramatic—but no one else *really* saw her. Not the way I did.

She wasn’t just tired.

She was *afraid*.

During the quiet study period at the beginning of class, I caught her glancing over her shoulder. Not once, not twice, but *several* times. Like she expected someone to be standing there.

And then, through the lesson, I watched her flinch. Cover her ears. Squeeze her eyes shut. Three separate times.

Hendrickson noticed too.

I remember the way he sat at his desk, rolling a small brass ball between his fingers—tiny, no bigger than the tip of his pinky. He watched her with something unreadable in his expression. Not curiosity. Not concern.

Something *grim*.

That afternoon, Hendrickson stopped her again. This time, I caught nothing of the conversation—the door shut behind me before I could linger.

Then came Friday.

Friday was *different*.

Liz still had the gray bags under her eyes, but the jittery, frayed edges of her demeanor were gone. No more fidgeting, no more looking over her shoulder. She wasn’t flippant or sporadic anymore. She was just… *still*.

The only noteworthy thing happened after school let out.

Most days, I’d find Danny after tenth period so we could walk home together. But as I stepped out the front doors, something caught my eye—Liz, moving fast, rounding the corner in a purposeful speed-walk. Not toward the buses.

Toward the back of the track field.

I hesitated, watching, following towards the corner of the building and peering at the track.

She didn’t slow down until she reached the white oak. And then, without hesitation, she lay down beneath it, arms at her sides, staring up into its tangled branches.

For the first time all week, she looked *calm*.

A deep, settled kind of calm. Like she had finally arrived somewhere she had been struggling to reach.

A strange feeling crawled up my spine.

I turned back toward home and saw Danny and Jaden already on the sidewalk.

Danny was watching me.

Jaden was looking at Danny.

And Jaden was *gesturing at me*, talking fast, his movements exaggerated with stress.

I remember making a point *not* to ask what they were talking about. Jaden was always cool with me, and at the time, I was more worried about Liz. Not that it mattered in the end.

That was the *last time* I ever saw her.

That weekend—sometime between Saturday night and early Sunday morning—I woke up to a *shriek*.

It tore through the dream I’d been having, dragging me into consciousness with a start. A warm, reddish-pink haze washed across my window, flickering like a distant fire. I told myself it was just some late-night drunk weaving home from the city tavern, headlights bleeding through the trees.

My eyes flicked to my clock.

*3:03 AM.*

The numbers pulsed, blinking erratically. The power must’ve gone out. I shut my eyes with a frustrated sigh, knowing I’d have to reset the time and my alarms in the morning.

But I didn’t move. I didn’t get up.

Something about that light—the way it pressed against my window—kept me frozen.

At some point, I must’ve drifted off again because the next thing I remember was dawn creeping over the horizon. And then—police cruisers.

Patrolling the school. Circling the block. Eventually branching out into the rest of town.

Monday morning, Liz didn’t show up to school.

I never saw her again.

The weeks that followed were *too* normal.

That was what unsettled me most.

The official story was that Liz Dillenger ran away in the middle of the night. Her parents claimed she had been pulling away from them recently—growing irritated, restless, eager for distance. Maybe that was true. But it wasn’t the *whole* truth.

I knew that.

I had never outwardly cared for Liz. She was prissy, a little annoying—but never mean. And for all her dramatics, I’d never seen her like she was *that week*. The exhaustion, the way she flinched at things no one else noticed, the way she *fled* to the tree that Friday afternoon and just *lay there*, as if something about the tree spurred away the nonexistent creatures assailing her.

Her parents didn’t see that. They didn’t *interpret* her the same way I did.

And so I found myself sinking into a pit of regret.

Should I have said something?

Would it have even mattered?

In the end, the school year crawled forward. Time washed over Liz’s absence like rain over pavement. Aside from a few of her outspoken friends, her disappearance faded from the front pages in a matter of months.

And life carried on.

Like nothing had ever happened.

It started to settle on me like an uncomfortable truth—just one of those terrible things that happen in life. A fluke. A tragedy. The kind of thing that shouldn’t happen, and yet, somehow, still does.

The odds of it happening again felt minuscule. Almost nonexistent.

Until later in the fall.

And then through the winter.

That was when Phil Brooks started coming up more and more in conversations between Danny and Jaden.

What I haven’t mentioned about Phil is that, for a time, he was much more than just a mutual friend to my brother—he was practically a fixture in our house. A frequent visitor. A fellow Mortal Kombatant, back when Danny and he were middle schoolers.

But, like the upgrade from Super Nintendo to PlayStation, things change.

Out with the old. In with the new.

By the time ninth grade rolled around, they had drifted onto different paths. Nothing bad—nothing dramatic—but they weren’t *as* close. They still ate lunch together, but their new friend groups pulled them in different directions.

And then, gradually, Phil became more of a memory than a presence.

At least, until his name started coming up again.

What I hadn’t realized was that Danny and Jaden had been more aware of my fixation on the tree than I thought. Maybe I hadn’t been as subtle as I believed. Maybe they’d noticed something in the way I talked about it—or didn’t.

Either way, they *had* been paying attention.

And they’d actually asked Phil about Mr. Hendrickson.

It all came to a head one night during Christmas break, when we gathered for a smoke session—not behind the shed this time, but *inside* it. The wind was brutal, howling against the thin walls, rattling the loose paneling. It was a light winter, barely any snow, but the cold carried a sharp edge.

Jaden was the one to bring it up.

“So, how’s Phil?” He asked, exhaling smoke in a slow, deliberate breath. “He acting weird? He doesn’t really *seem* like it.”

Danny hesitated. He shifted where he sat, glancing at me like he wasn’t sure how much to say. “He’s… not bad. Like—he seems okay?” His voice carried a note of uncertainty, like he wasn’t even convinced by his own words. “I only really see him at lunch. He’s not as talkative lately, but it’s been like that since September. He just kinda… zones out.”

*What?*

I could feel my expression tighten, my reflection in the dusty mirror catching the way my brow creased, the way my eyes flicked between them.

Something was up.

I knew it.

And they knew I knew.

And I knew they knew that I knew.

I spoke up before they could move on to another topic. They were professional asshats when they got high, and I knew it was only a matter of time before one of them started blinking super hard to focus while the other got distracted making paninis on the George Foreman grill.

“Woah, woah, woah. What do you mean, *is Phil acting weird*?”

Had they noticed Liz being weird around the tree? Had they sent Phil to check it out? *How much did they know?*

Danny shrugged, like he was trying to wave it off, but Jaden—knowing damn well I’d just keep pushing—finally answered.

“Brooks told your brother’s lunch table about Mr. Hendrickson’s class with Alex Rilen,” he said. Then, after a beat, “It really isn’t that big of a deal. He just talked about the same thing you told us—Hendrickson giving some weird sentimental speech about the tree. That’s all.”

*That wasn’t all.*

“Then why the hell are you asking about it *now*?”

They both hushed me, glancing at the shed door like someone might be listening. I hadn’t realized I’d raised my voice.

Danny grabbed my shoulder, squeezing it tight before locking eyes with Jaden and then back at me. His face was serious.

“Listen,” he said. “Just stay the fuck away from Philip. And stay away from that stupid fucking tree. Phil is off his rocker about it since September. And the last person who hung out over there—” he raised his hands, making air quotes, “—*ran away*.”

Then he leveled me with a look. “Just listen to me, Kev. I’ve never lied to you.”

We called it after that, heading inside to play *Medal of Honor* split screen deathmatch. As I sat waiting to face the winner, two things gnawed at me.

First—Danny *had* lied to me. Plenty of times. But I knew what he meant.

Second—Jaden and Danny knew about Liz ‘running away.’ And even though I’d never told them what I saw, or how she’d been acting that last week… *they didn’t believe she left town either.*

Obviously, I just bided my time until winter break was over, but I knew what I was going to do the second that conversation in the shed ended. It wasn’t a question. It wasn’t even a debate. I needed to talk to Phil.

Call me crazy, fine. But I lived in reality.

Danny’s warning had been serious—maybe the most serious I’d ever seen him. But I knew Phil Brooks. I remembered when he used to spend weekends at our house, cracking jokes, teaching me Mortal Kombat combos that Danny would later use against me. He wasn’t some lunatic. He wasn’t *off his rocker*. And if he was the only other person who saw what I saw, who knew what I knew, then I had to hear it from him. *Not secondhand. Not in whispers over a joint in a freezing shed. From him.*

And I knew exactly where to find him.

At the old white oak.

Because that’s where it always led back to.

As I approached Phil, nothing seemed particularly off. Like I said, it wasn’t a snowy winter, so he sat on the sloping hill beneath the tree, knees bent to prop up a worn notebook.

He must’ve caught me in his peripheral vision because he started, “Mr. He—” before realizing who I was. He corrected himself fast, voice going light, almost too casual. “Mr. Mr. Kevinnnn, what’s up?”

We went through the usual pleasantries—enough to make it feel normal, enough to let me press forward.

“So why are you out here? It’s still pretty cold.”

“I like this spot.”

“That right? What’s so great about it?”

Phil hesitated. His fingers drummed against the notebook cover.

“Noise, I guess. It’s just… quiet here.”

His eyes drifted up to the branches, bare now, skeletal against the pale winter sky. Without the leaves, the full shape of the oak was exposed—twisted, impossibly wide, older than any tree had a right to be. It looked like it had been here forever.

That’s when I saw it.

A small, brittle branch jutted out near eye level, a ribbon tying the husk of a bell to it. The metal was dull, corroded, and despite the wind swaying the branch, the bell didn’t make a sound. Hollow. Like it had been drained of its purpose.

I swallowed hard. “Mind if I hang out for a bit?”

Phil stiffened. “You should go, Kevin.”

Something about the way he said it put a knot in my stomach.

“I’ve gotta meet someone.”

“Hendrickson?” I guessed, pushing my luck. “No big deal. I have a class with him too.”

Phil shook his head fast, eyes darting back to the tree. “No, you don’t get it, he’s no—”

“Kevin! Phil! How’s it hanging?”

Phil shut his mouth so fast I thought I heard his teeth click.

Mr. Hendrickson’s voice rang out from twenty yards away, casual, too easy. His hand lifted in a friendly wave.

Phil’s grip tightened around his notebook, his knuckles bone-white.

Whatever I’d come looking for was shot down instantly. Hendrickson wasted no time clearing us both off the premises, sending Phil toward the parking lot and me on my usual walk home.

For a few minutes, we walked together in silence—until Phil whispered, just barely audible:

“The noise isn’t real.”

Then he veered left, and I was alone.

Walking home, stomach twisting, I couldn’t shake the feeling I’d just burned a bridge I didn’t even know I was standing on.

As if it were clockwork—just like the last time something bad happened. Another nightmare. But this one wasn’t just a nightmare. It was violent, vivid, something that fractured my mind.

I sat up in bed to an unnatural pink glow seeping through the window. A warmth hung in the air, thick and heavy, clashing with the reality I knew—I was certain it was still winter, yet outside, the world had changed. The grass was lush and untamed, swaying in a crisp summer breeze. Trees stood in full bloom, their emerald leaves shivering as if whispering secrets to one another. A deep, floral scent drifted through the open window, but something about it was cloying, too sweet—like flowers left too long in stagnant water.

Then, my vision sharpened, unnatural, like I had binoculars fused to my skull. My gaze was drawn to the Quiet Tree. Its massive canopy pulsed with the pink glow, raining light down in a steady, unnatural rhythm. And beneath that glow stood a figure.

They faced away, standing still in the haze. For a moment, I couldn’t tell who it was. The tree’s thick foliage fragmented the light, throwing streaks of pink and gold across their form. My breath hitched. Something was wrong.

Then the air shifted. The floral scent turned rancid—flesh left too long in the sun. My stomach twisted as a wet, splitting sound reached my ears. At first, I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. Then I saw it.

The base of the tree began to open.

Not like roots pulling apart, not like bark cracking, but like a wound splitting at its stitches. Flesh—not wood, not earth—flesh tore itself apart in a yawning, jagged mouth of pincer-like teeth. Hundreds, maybe thousands, curled inward, engorged on something that pulsed within the gnarled trunk.

I couldn’t breathe.

The teeth oozed something dark and viscous, strands of saliva stretching between the rows. The deep, gaping wound of the tree shuddered, its grotesque form pulsing with some horrible, living hunger. Then, as if shaking off its disguise, smaller branches twisted and curled downward—not wood, but limbs—real, grasping, coiling limbs.

They shot down, wrapping around the ankles, the wrists, the throat of the figure below. My heart pounded against my ribs as the tree’s grotesque limbs lifted them, twisting them like a marionette.

Then the tree turned him around.

Philip Brooks.

His face was slack, his glasses slightly askew. But his eyes—his eyes locked onto mine, and something cold and final slithered through my gut. His mouth barely moved as he whispered:

“The noise isn’t real.”

Then—Jingle.

A sound, small and delicate. A bell? A charm? It rang out, and the moment it did, the tree reacted.

With a terrible, wet shudder, the gaping wound of its mouth yawned wider. I screamed as Philip was ripped apart in an instant—no resistance, no struggle—just the sickening snap of bones and the sound of something vital being swallowed whole.

By the time my blurred vision cleared, all that was left was the faint rustle of leaves and the whisper of wind through an impossibly still night.

And his glasses, lying in the grass, catching the last flickers of fading pink light.

The bottom of the tree stitched itself closed.

Like it had never opened at all.

I stumbled back from the window as if the tree might come for me next. As if it knew.

The branches of nearby trees—trees that hadn’t been there before—slammed against the window frame with a violent crack. Shadows twisted, clawing at the glass. I staggered backward, breath coming in sharp, panicked gasps.

Then—bang.

Pain flared through my skull as I slammed into the doorframe. The world tilted, the nightmare splintering apart—

And I woke up.

Cold air pressed against my skin. My head throbbed beneath my palm. My breath hitched as I took in the dim, quiet room. No pink glow. No unnatural warmth. Just the lingering echo of my own panic.

Then—Jingle.

A soft chime from the hallway. I froze.

Only to hear my mom’s voice, humming lightly to herself as she removed the last of the Christmas decorations from the hall.

I’m sure you can guess Phil’s parents hadn’t heard from him since that Friday I’d last seen him. The cops actually came around during history class. Mr. Hendrickson was called out into the hallway, and though it felt like mere minutes, when he returned, his face was heavy.

He didn’t even need to say anything before the words slipped out, quiet but clear:

“There are therapy dogs available, in case the two disappearances are weighing on anyone.”

My stomach tightened. It felt too soon to declare Phil gone, but then again, I already had a feeling about what had happened to him.

There was a creeping unease hanging over everything, but somehow, Phil's name still echoed through the hallways longer than Liz's, and the fact that his car hadn’t been located helped my mind rest in the early spring. Danny and Jaden had been hanging out more, but with the weather warming up, they weren't as often home. They’d take Jaden's 1982 Honda Civic to his house, and I never felt comfortable enough to ask if I could tag along. It felt like they knew I’d spoken to Phil—and they’d shunned me for it.

We never talked about it, but the silence between us was louder than any words could have been. I’d gotten used to the familiar sound of Jaden’s Civic sputtering to life, followed by the bouncy noise of the suspension as it pulled out of our driveway… and then sometimes, there was the *jingle.*

It grew in the back of my mind, a steady thumping that hammered against my skull, making sleep harder and harder to come by. I held on as long as I could, but one day, Mr. Hendrickson called me over.

"Hey Kevin," he said with that soft, patient smile of his. "Why don’t you stay after class for a minute?"

I thought I was about to be confronted about the deterioration of my work. I'd forgotten about everything else—my grades slipping, my focus fading—but the way I’d been shutting down. All that mattered was the growing fog in my head.

Instead, he just sat there, spinning a little brass ball in his hands. "This too shall pass," he told me.

I remember how the words settled in the space between us, and I noticed something shift inside me. The tension in my head eased for a moment, like a calm after a storm. I leaned in to stay after class for those kind words, hoping they’d work their magic. They always did… until they didn’t anymore. Until I needed something else. Until I needed to be under the tree.

Mr. Hendrickson didn’t nudge me toward it, he simply suggested it, like he had no idea how much the idea of the tree had already taken root in my mind. Now that spring was in full swing and the tree was heavy with blossoms, he’d sometimes stop outside before heading home, offering words of encouragement that stacked on top of the soothing effect the tree had on my thoughts. It was perfect. My grades were getting back on track, Mr. Hendrickson wasn’t as bad as I’d thought—hell, he was even great—and the Quiet Tree had become my sanctuary.

But there were moments when I’d look up and see Danny and Jaden standing in the distance, exchanging quiet looks as they noticed me sprawled beneath the tree’s twisting limbs. The way they looked at me, like I was something different now, irritated me more than I cared to admit. They thought they knew me, thought I was going above them, maybe even above their advice. I could feel it in the way they whispered, the weight of their unspoken judgments hanging in the air.

It pissed me off. But then again, I couldn’t blame them.

Then the day came when the tree wasn’t enough to quiet my mind until the next day. It wasn’t enough anymore. I needed to stay after his classes, and then I’d compound that peace with a visit to the tree. But that wasn’t enough either. Soon I insisted, I couldn’t just visit the tree by myself. I needed Hendrickson there too. He obliged. 

The longer this went on, the less it helped. I got less and less sleep, and the silence of my mind grew louder, louder, until all I could hear was the jingle. It had only been a few weeks. Looking back, with clearer eyes, I realize now—Phil had managed to stave off the noise and the urges from September, right up until I met him at the tree in January. He’d gone without a conversation with Mr. Hendrickson because of my interference, and it wasn’t long before he was never seen again.

Then came the final plunge. No matter what I tried, my sleep continued to falter. I needed Hendrickson more than just after class or after school. I remember stumbling out of lunch, driven by an urge I couldn’t control, making my way to his classroom. There was no long-term plan anymore, no thought of solving the problem. I was hooked. All I could think of was prolonging my survival.

I opened his door—and he wasn’t there. Panic surged through me. I squeezed my palms against my temples, eyes shutting fiercely, trying to focus, to calm down. Desperation took over, and I rushed to his desk, searching for something, anything—whatever book he got his quotes from, something that could help, anything to fill the void.

When I opened the drawers, the rage hit me like a wave. There was nothing—just a few pencils, a spare pair of glasses with no case(probably why they were cracked), loose-leaf paper, a little pink ribbon, and that damn brass ball he always fiddled with. That was it. My fingers tightened, frustration boiling over. I was about to storm out of the classroom, heading straight for the tree, when I slid the drawer shut, got to the door, reached for the knob —and the door opened.

Mr. Hendrickson stood there, his expression unreadable, his eyes scanning me in a way that made my stomach twist. Before I could think, the words poured out of me, desperate, frantic—I begged him for something, anything, to get me through the rest of the day.

He placed a firm hand on my shoulder, met my eyes, and said, *“Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before.”*

The noise in my head dulled, but confusion quickly filled the space it left behind. Why would he say that? Before I could ask, he gestured me out of the room. The door clicked shut behind me. Locked.

I blinked, and suddenly, Friday was over.

I stood before the Quiet Tree, its blossoms heavy in the golden afternoon light. It should have been comforting. It should have been enough. But it wasn’t. I knew I wouldn’t sleep, not even with the tree’s usual calm pressing against my mind. Mr. Hendrickson never came out, and for the first time in weeks, I thought of Philip. *“The noise isn’t real.”*

As I tilted my head back, my gaze traced the twisting limbs of the tree—and then I saw it. A small, hollow bell tied to the end of a branch, swaying gently. There was nothing inside, nothing to make it ring. Yet, as the wind whispered through the tree, a faint jingle played out.

My chest tightened.

I forced myself to follow the limbs downward, to the trunk—perfectly smooth. My breath caught. The ground beneath it was untouched, unbroken. No gnarled roots pushing through the earth. No bumps where roots should have burrowed deep.

My eyes darted back up. The wind swept through the leaves, rustling, shifting—

And yet, they made no sound.

The only sound was the wind in the other trees, just yards away.

It was as if the tree knew what I had just realized about it.

The calm it had given me evaporated, replaced by something cold and unwelcoming. A warning. I had no choice but to go home and try again Saturday.

But I couldn’t have predicted what the night had in store for me.

As I stepped through the front door, Danny bumped into me on his way out. He wasn’t angry—just… uneasy. His eyes met mine, and for a moment, I thought he might say something. But before I could open my mouth, Jaden’s Civic pulled up, the sputtery pop of its exhaust cutting through the quiet.

Emotion clawed its way up my throat. I should have stopped him. I should have said something. Apologized for being distant, for letting the Quiet Tree dig its roots into my mind. But I hesitated. Too late. The car doors shut. The engine revved. They were gone.

Night fell, and my skull pounded as I tried to force myself to sleep.

Melatonin and weed. It had never crossed my mind before—I’d never smoked with Danny and Jaden—but now, it felt worth a shot. Anything to stop the noise. It seemed to do the job fairly quick.

I laid down, closed my eyes, and drifted into a deep, dreamless sleep.

The next memory was hazy, dreamlike. No mind-numbing jingle. No headache. No feeling in my body at all as I stepped outside, feet moving of their own accord. My vision tunneled, the world narrowing to a single focal point—

The Quiet Tree.

Its glow bathed me in warm pink light, washing over the hill where I knelt, yards from its base. A golden shimmer drifted through the air like dust in the sun. I exhaled, and euphoria flooded my veins, thick and sweet. I opened my arms, surrendering to it.

The tree moved.

Its limbs curled and twisted like fingers, stretching toward me. The trunk shuddered, stitches of bark unraveling, splitting apart—

My vision blurred. My thoughts slowed.

A gust of heat rolled from the opening trunk, yet there was no smell. No rot. No scent at all. Just warmth, seeping into my skin. My senses dulled, my mind slipping—

Then—

*Pop.*

A sputtering engine.

A car door slammed.

Tires screeched against pavement.

And then—through what felt like a wall of concrete—I heard the shouting.

Danny.

*"NO, KEVIN—GET OUT OF HERE!"*

A shape burst into my periphery, closing the distance in a heartbeat. I barely registered the impact as Danny shoved me back. My knees buckled, my body slumping onto my heels.

Tears blurred my vision. I tasted salt on my lips. I forced out the words, a strangled whisper—

*"I’m sorry, Danny."*

I blinked—

And the tree had him.

Limbs wrapped around his arms, his torso—his leg bent at a wrong, sickening angle. Even through my haze, I knew it was broken. He thrashed against the branches, against something stronger than either of us could ever be.

*"IT'S OKAY."* His voice was quieter now, like he was already being pulled away. *"IT'S OKAY. GO HOME."*

A smaller limb coiled around his throat.

My vision blurred further. My hearing was so far gone what he said was just a whisper.

*"No matter what, I still lov—"*

Crack.

Something warm sprayed across my face.

I was beyond ready to wake up from the nightmare.

But I didn’t.

Not until I was lying at the bottom of the hill, rain pelting my face, an EMT kneeling at my side. A little bell with a ribbon and a small brass ball within it gripped in my hand.

The following days shattered my mind to sediment. This disappearance wasn’t like the others. I wasn’t going to forget this one. Because it should have been me.

I was cleared from the hospital, sent back to school, but everything had changed. Mr. Hendrickson was gone, replaced by a substitute. The tree—gone. As if it had never been there at all.

Nobody believed me.

A whole year, it had stood there. Three missing students. Forgotten.

But I remembered.

Even now, I can feel it—something clawing at my skull, scraping at the inside of my mind. Why can I remember? I want to forget. I did forget.

They sent me away. My mom. She took me to every professional, trying to fix what she thought was broken. But when I wouldn’t stop insisting that I had a brother—that Danny existed—it was the final straw.

Six years.

Six years confined to the wing of a mental hospital.

And then, somehow, I moved on. I forgot. Built a life. Started a family in 2011 with my ex. Left it all behind.

Then my mom died.

She left me the house. And a small fortune from a lottery ticket she won in 1999—a ticket I never knew existed.

Crazy, I know.

So tell me. Tell me why.

Twenty-five years later, my daughter walks through the door, fresh off her first week of high school—

And she tells me about the old white oak tree behind the track.

I can see it from my fucking window.
