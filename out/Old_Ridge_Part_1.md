It takes a lot to break me. I’m usually able to keep myself together during hard times, but with my sister’s funeral yesterday, I couldn’t help but to lock myself in my room and ball my eyes into my pillow. It was 10:32 PM, A drunk driver took a left as my sister, Hannah, was driving through a green light. The driver was too hammered to realize that she was approaching quickly, but he went anyway. She was going 75 MPH, until it rapidly fell to zero when her body went through the windshield and crashed into the drunk’s car. The dark red hue of her blood completely filled the right side of the drunk’s white van. If that driver wasn’t driving under the influence, or if Hannah was wearing her seatbelt, none of this would’ve happened. I know she wasn’t wearing one, because I was in the passenger seat that night.

I felt so guilty. I didn’t know she wasn’t wearing it. Maybe if I told her to put it on, things could’ve been different. Blaming the driver makes the situation easier though. His name was Bryce Mollere, he’s serving eight years in prison. If I could, I would plead for public execution, never let him drink, drive, or do anything again. But, America and democracy has its morals or whatever.

I’ve been in my room since last night, and haven't eaten anything since the granola bar I stashed in my pocket before the funeral. I haven’t checked on my dad to see how he’s doing, we didn’t talk the whole car ride home. First it was my mom three years ago, and now my sister. I lifted my head off my pillow to see a pool of tears I left in my breakdown. I wiped my face with my shirt as I stood up weakly. I could still feel the airbag bashing my chest in with such force that it left a massive bruise. It hurts to use my arms or try to move in certain ways.

The room was a mess. T-shirts and shorts thrown around the place and unpaired socks all over the floor. I ignored them and headed for the door. It creaked loudly as I opened it slowly. I could hear slight whimpering coming from downstairs. Halfway down the stairs, I see my dad sitting on the couch, head in hands, as he quietly wept into them. I guess nothing in this house is quiet, because he must’ve heard the wooden stairs creak and looked up from his hands.

“Oh,” he said as he wiped his tears. “Sorry, I didn’t see you.”

“It’s okay.”

I came down the rest of the stairs and sat across from him in the living room. We sat there in silence for what seemed like lifetimes.

“I’m sorry you have to go through this, son.” I stayed quiet, looking down at my feet. “This wasn’t supposed to happen to you, to us. You’re just a kid.” 

Another tear rolled down his cheek as I looked up at him. I felt more tears starting to form.

“I just don’t know what to do,” I pleaded. “What can we do?” 

The silence was deafening. I didn’t expect him to answer. We’ll just have to do what we’ve been doing for the past three years; ‘fake it until we make it’. But that’s bullshit, because there is no ‘making it,’ so we’ll be faking it for the rest of our lives. After the excruciatingly long pause, my dad spoke up.

“What do you think about moving?” 

The question caught me off guard. It made me think about how run-down the place was: the doors nearly coming off the hinges, the floors and stairs feeling like they’ll cave in any second. We didn’t have a washer or dryer, we didn’t even have an oven. It would be nice to be somewhere new, especially since I’ve lived in this same house since I was born. But where was my dad going to get the money for a new house? He works off of minimum wage helping at construction sites. As if he heard my thoughts, he answered.

“I got a job offer from a delivery service, semi-truck driving. It’s a lot higher paying than what I’m working for. Problem is, it’s a couple hours down south in a town called Old Ridge. I found a decent house, better than this one. I’ll be able to pay for it, don’t worry.” 

It sounded appealing. I just felt bad that he had to handle the expenses on his own. 

“Are you sure you can pay for it? Maybe I can find a job down there, help with some of the bills.”

“Thanks buddy,” 

He gave me a weak smile as he got up from the couch. He walked over to me holding his arms out, signaling a hug. My heart melted, along with the rest of my body as he held me in his arms. I tried to hold back my tears, but it was just too much. I gasped and struggled for air as tears rolled down my cheeks. I could hear his heartbeat as my head rested on his chest.

“I’m so sorry you have to go through this, no kid should have to.” 

He hugged me tighter as I sobbed. Every time I close my eyes, I can see that night, clear as day. The graphic memory of my sister barreling through the windshield. Her limbs mangled in ways I didn’t think I’d ever see outside of dark web videos online. I would never be able to erase it from my memory as it haunts me every night.

“I don’t know if I can do this, dad,” I said shakily as I wiped my tears. 

The weight of both the women in my life suddenly gone was just too heavy, knowing I'll never be the same again. It was probably worse for dad, losing his wife and his own child.

“It’s… it’s gonna be alright,” I could hear the uncertainty in his voice. “We’ll get through this together.” 

I hoped we would be able to recover, but if we couldn’t, at least we would be miserable together.

“So, would you be okay with moving?”

“Yeah.”

“Are you sure? I can give you some time to think about it-“

“No, it’s okay. I’m fine with it.” 

I looked up at him with a genuine smile. If my dad can get a higher paying job and we can live somewhere more secure, then that’s fine by me. 

“Okay then. I’ll accept the job and we can leave in a couple days.”

I had everything I needed for the new house packed into 3 different boxes: One for all of my clothes (I really only had 7 different outfits that I owned), one for my 2010 personal computer and all the parts it needed, and the last one for any random accessories or toys that I had.

I peeked in my sister’s room, which was mostly empty. The night before, my dad and I put her stuff into a couple boxes. We kept a couple of her things for memorabilia, but most of her clothes and other items were either given to charity, or sold to whoever would take them. One thing we kept was a necklace she would always wear. It was a necklace I gave her on her twentieth birthday. I got it from a generic jewelry store, but she loved it and wore it almost every day. It was mostly silver, while the charm was a golden heart. On the back of the heart, it said, ‘I love you forever.’ Before my mom died, I would do chores around the house for allowance. I used all the money I made from this to get her that necklace. She was wearing it on the day of the crash. Before she was taken to the hospital, a police officer came up to me, holding the necklace. He asked me if I was related to Hannah, and when I confirmed, he gave me the necklace to keep. I started wearing it everyday after he gave it to me; Just something to keep that has a little part of her everywhere I go.

I checked my dad’s room, he was crouching down in front of one of the cardboard boxes, putting piles of clothes into it. He heard me approaching with the creaking of the floorboards and looked behind him. He gave me a smile and stood up.

“You ready to go, bud?” 

I traded smiles with him and nodded. He saw Hannah’s necklace I was wearing and his smile faded a little. His eyes were suddenly filled with sorrow, and I reciprocated.

“Yeah I got packed pretty quick, don’t have much to pack anyway.”

“Alright, we can leave here pretty soon. I just gotta finish cleaning up before we go.”

“I can help.”

“Thanks, I gotta finish packing, but if you want to start without me, you can put the tupperware and utensils in a box downstairs.”

I started down the stairs that sounded like they were about to collapse and found a box to put the tupperware in. I headed to the kitchen and opened the silverware drawer. I don’t know exactly why, but I guess out of boredom, I started counting each individual fork, spoon, and butter knife,

One, two, three, four, five… six forks.

One, two, three, four… five spoons.

One, two… three butter knives.

I never realized that we had one less spoon compared to forks. Maybe someone accidentally threw one in the trash along with their paper plate. Speaking of, we didn’t have glass plates or anything like that, so I didn’t have to worry about counting those. We do have some glass cups, though.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven… eight glass cups.

One… two glass coffee mugs.

I made sure to put these in carefully so they wouldn’t break on the transport to our new house. The box was about halfway full, and all I needed to pack now was the plastic tupperware. I didn’t even bother to count these because there were so many plastic shapes and sizes that I wouldn’t even know how to classify them, so I just tossed them all in the box. There were a couple containers with lids, some big containers with no lids, and other classifications I didn’t bother to check. I was about to seal up this box with tape when my dad came down the stairs with his first round of boxes.

“Do you need any help moving those?”

“Nah, nah, it’s all good, I got it.” 

He sounded like he was about to pass out, but I wasn’t about to ruin his manhood, so I watched him struggle to place the boxes at the bottom of the stairs with a bit of a thud. He wiped his forehead and heavily exhaled.

“Whew, didn’t think I had that much stuff either, but I still got three boxes upstairs.” 

He stretched out his back and I could hear the multiple cracks throughout his spine. He searched through his back pocket and held out his car keys to me. 

“Do you mind putting some of these boxes in the trunk for me?” 

I grabbed them and nodded. He started his way back upstairs as I unlocked and opened the front door. I struggled to pick up the first big box, but managed to bring it to the back of my dad’s SUV. I put it on the concrete driveway and reached into my pocket. I unlocked the car and swung open the trunk. Hopefully there was enough room for all of our boxes. I thought it wouldn’t be too bad, though; we can cram some other boxes and items in the backseat as well. I lifted the box up and carefully slid it in the back of the trunk, touching the backseats. I walked back inside for more boxes when I see my dad coming down the stairs with another one.

“Hey, grab this one for me, will ya?”

I took it from his hands, it was lighter than the one I took outside previously.

“I put all the forks and stuff in that box in the kitchen if you want to look at it before taping it up.”

He went to the kitchen as I headed outside with the box he handed to me. The trunk was still open, so I placed the box into the trunk, putting it right next to the previous box. I wiped the sweat off my forehead with my sleeve. I heard a door open and close to my right. I thought it might have been my dad coming outside, but instead, it was our next door neighbor. We both exchanged looks as he headed over in my direction.

“Hey, Sonny! Whatcha doin‘ with those boxes?”

The man was old, about 80 years old, but we never really talked all that much, and I couldn’t remember his name. All I know is that he and my dad would go out golfing a few times before. But ever since mom passed, we stayed reclusive when it came to neighbors.

“Hey! We’re actually, um, moving away.”

It was a pretty awkward exchange. He just stood there after the fact, with the same oddly big smile on his face.

“Oh, well that’s a shame. Where ya headed?”

“My dad got a job in Old Ridge, a few hours south of here?”

The man’s demeanor immediately changed from cheery to blank-faced. His smile faded faster than anything I’ve seen before. The color from his eyes vanished into nothingness.

“…Old Ridge..?”

His monotone voice gave me the creeps. I instinctively took a step back. What was it about Old Ridge that set this old guy off? I assumed that maybe he used to live there, or maybe passed through before.

“Y-Yeah, do you know the place?”

He didn’t answer. His face didn’t change, he didn’t even move. It was as if he was in a trance, and the phrase that triggered it was ‘Old Ridge’. I looked to my left and saw my dad coming out the door with the box of tupperware I packed, now taped and sealed up. He peeked around the box to see the man and smiled.

“Hey Bill! It’s been a while!”

I stepped out of the way as my dad put the box in the trunk. Bill still seemed to be his frozen state, but he quickly snapped out of it when my dad spoke to him.

“Hey Jim! So you’re moving to Old Ridge, huh?”

“That’s right, did my son tell you?”

”Yup! He also told me you got a job down there. That’s great!” His big smile was back and his tone shifted back to how it was originally. It was like he was two different people.

“Yeah, we’re excited. Nice to have some change, y’know?”

“Oh, I know it all too well…” Bill took a long pause. “...I’m sorry about your daughter’s passing recently.”

“Thanks.” 

I could tell my dad wanted nothing to do with this conversation, and neither did I. I remember seeing Bill at the funeral; it was just for a moment, but he was standing in the corner after the ceremony. Not interacting with anyone, just looking down at the ground, or staring off into space somewhere. I never trusted this man, I don’t know if it’s just because he’s old and frail, or something about his vibe just doesn’t sit right with me. Another long pause was broken by Bill when he started again.

“Alright well, you two best get back to it! I wouldn’t want to keep you!”

Dad and I were heading back inside, but before we reached the door, the man chimed in another time, with his same happy demeanor.

“Best of luck in Old Ridge! My son lives there, that place is not what it seems!” Bill chuckled, but the statement didn’t seem funny at all. “Buh-bye now!”

He waved us goodbye as we closed the door behind us. We both looked at each other, as puzzled as ever to his last addition. ‘Best of luck’? ‘Not what it seems’? I don’t know what he could possibly mean, but by the way he looked at me when I brought it up, it wasn’t anything good.

“What, a, weirdo.” He read my mind.

We brought out the rest of the boxes and were able to cram everything in the trunk, with a few things like bedding and such in the back seat. I slammed the trunk door shut and handed my dad’s keys back. I swung open the passenger side door and jumped in the SUV. I shut the door, reached in the back seat for a pillow and blanket, and got myself comfortable.

“I’m gonna do one more sweep of the house to make sure everything’s good, okay?” I gave him a nod as he went back inside. 

I breathed deeply and exhaled as I closed my eyes. My head was still wrapping around what Bill meant about this town we’re moving to. Is it really a good idea to do this? Well, I guess there’s no turning back now, this house has already been sold. 

I opened my eyes and looked out the passenger side window. My skin began to crawl as I looked at the side of Bill’s house. At his window was a silhouette of someone, staring at me. No, it wasn’t just someone, it was Bill. I squinted my eyes to see that he had a massive frown on his face, as if polar opposite from before. His hand was smudging the window as it was pressed against it firmly. My breathing became shaky, it became hard to breathe. It was like his presence was sucking the life out of me. I glanced to the front of my house as my dad came out the door and locked it behind him. My eyes quickly darted back to the man’s window, but the silhouette was gone. I could still faintly see the hand print he left on the window.

My dad opened the driver door and plopped himself next to me. He exhaled as he closed the door and started the engine. It took a little longer than expected to start up, but the car was persistent and the engine began to purr.

“Alright, you ready? Got a long trip ahead of us.”

“I guess so.”

“Okay… let’s hit the road.”
