*Welcome to Kill Sim. Government software license 7861X76F.*

*Your participation is voluntary.*

*Do you wish to play?* [1]-**Yes** or [7]-**No**?

[1] >!You're in a bare concrete room. The victim—bound and hooded—kneels before you. Do you [3]-**Kill**, [3]-**Rape** or [3]-**Maim**?!<

[2] >!No! You refuse! You back away from the victim. Then, feeling your way along the wall, you find a switch. You press it. A door opens. [6]-**Exit**.!<

[3] >!When, finally (*No, please…*), you're done (*Stop*, she sobbed… as you—), a voice says: “Excellent. That must have felt extremely liberating. But, tell me, do you feel any guilt?” [4]-**Yes** or [5]-**No**?!<

[4] >!A flood of light! Blinded, you hear boots, feel hands pulling you. A syringe—pierces your neck. As you [9]-**lose consciousness** you hear, “Another moral defective. Strip them, hood them, reset the room for the next test subject…”!<

[5] >!A door opens. Three uniformed men enter the room. Two drag away what remains of the victim. The third says, “Congratulations. You have followed orders and demonstrated an exceptional level of sadism. You have therefore proved your worth to the State. Welcome to the *Internal Enforcement Division*.”!<

[6] >!You’re in a long corridor. *Listen*, you hear, echoed. *We are the Resistance. You have refused to play their game which is not a game. We need your help. There is a message for you hidden between [7] and [8]. Do not let them break you. Do not let them take away your humanity. Go!*!<

[7] >!A hood is forced over you head—! [9]-**What?**!<

>! *Kill Sim* is not a simulation! It is an experiment by the State. Everything that happens here is real. The pain is real. The deaths are real. So many innocent men and women have already suffered and died. Countless more will. Unless you put an end to it. Already you have disobeyed them. Become a hero. Put on this vest. Continue to the Control Room. Once inside, engage the detonator. [X]-**Obey** or [7]-**Go back**?!<

[8] >!*Click*. **Bang**! Destruction. [Z]-**Death**.!<

[9] >!*Blackness*. You’re bound, kneeling. Struggling to breathe. It’s cold. You hear somebody. “Hell—” you manage to say before the **pain starts**. *Oh, God! No, please… Stop…*!<

[X] >!You burst into the Control Room! Dozens of men and women stop and stare at you, their mouths hanging open, absolute terror in their eyes. Do you engage the detonator: [8]-**Yes** or [4]-**No**?!<

[Z] >!...or so it seemed, because as you regain your senses you realize you're still alive. The Control Room is untouched. Dozens of people are applauding you. A woman approaches. She reaches out her hand to you. “Congratulations,” she says.  “You have demonstrated an exemplary willingness to commit mass murder on command. You have therefore not only passed the *Kill Sim*, but passed at the highest possibke level. Welcome to Control Division.”!<
