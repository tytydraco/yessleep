This all began at a hole in the wall bar in Ohio .. Just a random bar visit on a Tuesday night has radically changed my life. There was this goddess of a bartender who would serve me. She looked like Megan Fox except with a bubbly  contagious demeanor that I was immediately infatuated with. 

  
 "Hey ma 'am.. Are there any different bars or clubs in this town that are new or I dunno just something kinda different? " i shouted to her across the bar ... Her face lit up Xmas tree style and she was beaming as she power walked straight towards me.

  
 "Oh hun I know a brand new bar that opened.... but It is probably too different for even a thrill seeker like ur self" Heh was she trying to intimidate me with a bar  .. Lady u picked the wrong drunk.

  
 "Try me ... Can I have the address or is that a secret too?" She smiled as she began mixing a drink that began to bubble and looked like a Hi-C extocooler . .. She dropped a pellet into it and it glowed like a glowstick .. 

  
"The rules are ... That you have to chug this shot in one drink and it's free so once u do that I'll go get u the address and a membership pass" she winked adorably at me ... No way was I not taking this shot I was in love with this stranger.

  
I threw it back and even preparing for a strong liquor to burn my mouth ... Something was ... Wrong .. It didn't taste like liqour... Harsh chemicals and metallic taste and smell really had me worried .. What was this stuff... Was it even safe to be digested? It didn't taste like it was ... I looked for that bartender but she had completely vanished ... Never even giving me the address ..

  
I decided to call it a night and since I didn't feel sick or poisoned I went to bed to pass out . A nice surprise for once sleep came to me super easily a rarity in my life ... Another surprise followed .. I was immediately dropped into this um... Well it was a conference room with hundreds of people just like me in it ... confused ... Scared ... panic setting in .. everyone asking "where am i? " no one seemed to know that ... 

  
 "Excuse me people please I know ur all looking for awnsers ... Only I have them so listen up closely " shouted a man I had not seen til his announcement ... He looked like a lawyer or a company owner he spoke with authority

  
 " I'll just give it to you straight ok folks. Ur dreaming right now ... I know it doesn't feel like a dream and hell we only call it that for lack of a better term ... But simply put .. At some point tonight .... Someone made u a drink ... Or dropped something in yours .. Perhaps you recall a disgusting taste of metal in a drink ... In lamenins terms those chemicals and hypnotic suggestions hidden in  numerous apps on ur phone has made it so that all of you people .. Dreaming ... Share the same space in the same deminsion .. RIGHT ... HERE .. 

  
 "We call this place the nexus and weither you like it or not this will be where u go every time you go to sleep from now on ....you will be waking up soon so I want to tell you our goal .... After we found this annomaly another quickly presented itself ... There is a hallway with 4 doors (2 on each side) ... They could literally lead to anywhere in space... Time ... Maybe even other dimensions or timelines ... And I've made this small team to discover the unknowns ... Adventure awaits .. We will see you next time !!!! "

  
I woke up and quickly tried to say to myself "it was only a dream" ... But I know In my heart that's not true ... I rremember every single second of the dream and I never could do that in dreams before ... And it just didn't feel like a dream it's hard to explain but I'll keep u guys posted on this
