Multiple people told me to post this here from my original post.


This happened to me over the weekend during a hunting trip. I spent last night trying to google and figure out what the hell I saw. I haven’t found anything that doesn’t seem like conspiracy craziness so I am open to any suggestions.  

A family friend has a few hundred acres in Tennessee. Once a year my dad, uncle, me, and the guys in the family that own the land go on a week long hunting trip. They have a cabin and a trailer tucked away at the edge of the mountain that we stay at during the week. There is no running water and we use a generator for lights during the evening. Phone service is non existent out there. The nearest town is Murphy, Tennessee which is about 50 mins away by car. Typically, we get out to tree stands/ground blinds around 4:00 AM and then come back to the camp around 9ish,  grab something to eat, and nap and then head back to hunt until sundown. All week my uncle and I hunted the same “plot.” It was on the east side of the property and took about 20 mins by four wheeler. We would park the four wheeler in this big clearing and then the ground blind I was hunting from is another 15 mins or so by foot. It’s a rough 15 mins too. I basically walk along this ridge line on the side of the mountain and the blind is set just inside the underbrush of a tree line that overlooks an opening at the start of a river. My uncle was hunting in a blind that was a little closer walk and probably 30 mins away from me. 

We hunted the same spot Sunday - Thursday. Thursday evening we were all drinking beer and hanging out by the fire. My uncle having not seen anything all week wanted to go to the plot my dad was hunting. It’s like a 30 min walk from the camp you don’t even need a four wheeler to get there. I had killed a deer the first afternoon there and seen a bunch of doe’s that evening right before sunset so I wanted to stay where I was. So Friday morning after we hunted I helped him pack up his blind and ride it out to the plot my dad had been on and helped him get set up for that evening. I took the four wheeler by myself that afternoon and continued hunting the same ground blind. 

Same thing as I had done all week everything was fine. Nothing out of the ordinary, until Saturday morning. I had gone out by myself again that morning and had watched a bunch of deer that crept up right before the sun started coming up. They were a bit further than I wanted to shoot and when they got closer to the edge of the river they weren’t big enough or were too young for me to justify shooting. I watched them until they retreated back into the woods and at this point it’s probably 8:30 AM or so and the sun is fully up. 

Now this is an embarrassing for me, but oh well. Having spent almost an entire week packed in this trailer with 2 other guys and no privacy. I decided I was going to rub one out before I went back to the camp. Every hunter has done it idc if you admit it or not lol. Now I’m sitting there doing my thing and even though nobody ever walks up on you while you’re hunting out there, I’m still on high alert making sure I don’t get caught by one of the guys while I’m doing this. I’m laid back in this chair inside the blind basically one eye open looking out in front of me and every now and again peaking behind me through the mesh to make sure no one is coming. That’s when I started hearing crunching. I knew it was people footsteps and I could tell it was more than one person. It was to my right and the mesh of the ground blind and underbrush kept me from being able to see who it was. I calmly put my junk away and quietly leaned up so when my uncle or whoever it was came up I could act like I was just sitting there hunting. Keep in mind we are so far out in the sticks that it never even occurred to me that it could be anybody other than someone I was hunting with. 

I listened to them walking and finally I slowly stood up and poked my head out the blind and peaked over the underbrush. It was 4 people walking towards the river in a line. They were wearing these black cloak looking clothes like something they wear in Harry Potter with these furry hats that covered most of their faces. Looked like some weird cult but the guy in the back of the line was completely naked. He looked disgusting. His hair was curly and way too long and he had a big beard that looked nasty like it had a bunch of leaves and shit in it. I’m bundled up with hand warmers in my pockets because it’s like 25-30 degrees out. This guy had to be freezing. No SHOES either. This is thick underbrush we’re talking about walking through. Rocks jutting up from the ground and shit. No sane person is out there barefoot much less completely naked. The guy had to be 115 LBs too just completely unhealthy looking like these people had been keeping him prisoner or something. The sight of these guys was so unnerving to me that I was still standing there frozen in an awkward half stand half bent over position with my head out the blind watching them before it clicked with me I needed to slowly sit down. At that point they had passed the point of the blind where I couldn’t see them and were walking with their backs to me towards the river. 

I slowly sat down and put my rifle in my lap and watched them all step ankle deep into the river. They were facing side profile away from me towards the woods and I could see two of the clothed people moving around the naked guy and one of them was standing still holding their arm out in front of them. I got the nerve to look through my scope at them and it looked like two of them were washing the guy with the river water and the other one holding their arm out holding like a chain or something. The one holding the chain was talking but way too far for me to hear any of it. After a few minutes the two doing the washing stopped and all three of them held hands around the naked guy and started moving in a circle around him while he just stood there staring ahead. They did this shit for 5 minutes at least.  That doesn’t seem like a long time but 5 whole minutes of watching whatever the hell that was seemed like a lifetime. 

Something of note. That clicked with me last night. Whatever they were doing seemed time based. My watch beeped at 9:00 and nearly gave me a heart attack. No way they could hear it but in my head I was picturing them all turning and looking at me. But right after my watch beeped they stopped a few second later so 9:00 on the dot. The 3 clothed people stepped back in a line in front of the naked guy and they walked back the way they came from. Exactly like they came in. None of them talked or broke the line they were walking in. It was terrifying because the way out for them was the first time I truly could have been in their line of site. They never saw me though and I watched them once they passed me head back up the mountain from where I assume they originally came from. I waited for 30 mins or so and booked it out of there so fast.
