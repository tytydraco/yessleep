No one tells you how much of the job is managing fears. Not your own, but your kids'. A shadow in the corner, a bump in the night, a clump of dust they’re convinced is a spider—it’s always something. You try not to roll your eyes or snap, even when it’s the third time they’ve dragged you out of bed in a week. You remind yourself that kids don’t see the world the way you do, that their imaginations get the best of them. You tell them there’s nothing to be scared of, that it’s all in their head.

And most of the times, you'd be right.

Most of the times.

It started with my son (M8). Let's just call him Alex. He just turned eight last month, and I was starting to think we were done with this sort of thing. Monsters under the bed, shadows that move when they shouldn’t—I thought we’d outgrown all that. He'd been a tough kid to raise. He was always scared of something, and still sleeps with a nightlight. But he isn’t a baby anymore. He plays Minecraft like a pro, beats Ganon without breaking a sweat, and is on his way to be a Pokémon master. But then, one night, he came into my room, clutching his Bulbasaur like a lifeline.

“There’s something under my bed,” he whispered, his voice trembling just enough to make my heart sink.

I sat up, rubbing my face. “Alex, you’re too old for this.”

He looked at me, wide-eyed. “I know,” he said, almost sorry. “But I think it’s real.”

I sighed and threw the blankets off. It was late—too late to start this kind of back-and-forth. But something in his face stopped me from brushing him off entirely.

“All right,” I said, standing. “Let’s go check. Together.”

Alex hesitated, glancing toward the door. “Can you bring the flashlight?”

I almost rolled my eyes, but his voice—quiet, shaky—made me pause. Alex wasn’t the type to ask for help lightly. Hell, he had gotten better than me at some games and had to help his old man more often than not.

“Fine,” I said, grabbing my phone and turning on the flashlight. “Let’s go see this monster.”

He followed me back to his room, clutching my arm like we were about to walk into a war zone. When we got there, everything looked normal. He had enough Pokémon plushies to start a daycare, and most of them were piled on his bed like a tiny army protecting him at night. His Nintendo Switch was sitting on the desk, still charging from earlier. His Pikachu blanket was half-crumpled on the bed. And, of course, his plush Pokémon stared at us from their usual spots, their stitched smiles oddly reassuring.

But the bed—it felt different.

I couldn’t explain it. Maybe it was the way Alex stood in the doorway, refusing to step inside. Or maybe it was how the air seemed colder, heavier somehow.

I shook it off and crouched down. “See? There’s nothing here,” I said, angling the flashlight under the bed.

The beam lit up the usual mess: a couple of stray Lego bricks, one of his Minecraft guides, and a couple Pokémon cards.

I turned to him. “No monsters, Alex. Just some junk you should probably—”

Then I saw it.

A shape. Small and dark, shifting just out of the light’s reach.

I froze. The shape didn’t move like something alive, it didn’t scuttle or slither. It just… shifted, like it was deciding what to be.

“Dad?” Alex whispered from the doorway. His voice was barely audible.

I wanted to tell him it was nothing, that it was just a trick of the light. I wanted to laugh and say, “Look, it’s your imagination again.”

But my throat tightened.

Because for the first time, I wasn’t sure.

“Stay there, Alex,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady.

He lingered in the doorway, hugging his stuffed Bulbasaur, when a groggy voice cut through the room.

“What’s going on now?”

I turned to see his older brother, Nate (M12), sitting up on the top bunk, squinting down at us. He rubbed his eyes, looking annoyed. “It’s, like, midnight. I’ve got math tests tomorrow, and Alex is doing the monster thing again?Dear god, he's 8 already, dad!

Alex glared up at him, his lip trembling. “It’s not a thing. I saw something.”

Nate groaned and flipped on the light next to his bed, flooding the room with a harsh white glow. “See?” he said, waving an arm dramatically. “No monsters. Just a freaking mess. Like always.”

I glanced back at the floor. Under the harsh light, the room looked painfully ordinary. Messy, yeah, but ordinary. The pile of books by the desk. The heap of Legos spilling out of their plastic bins. Even the shadows under the bed had disappeared, swallowed by the light.

“Go back to sleep, Nate,” I said, trying to sound firm but tired enough to avoid an argument.

“Maybe Alex should go to sleep, too,” Nate muttered, flopping back onto his pillow. “He’s the one freaking out.”

I shot him a look, but Alex didn’t seem to notice. He was still staring at the bed, his knuckles white against Bulbasaur’s green fur.

“Dad,” he whispered. “I’m not lying.”

My chest tightened.

“I know, buddy,” I said softly. “Let’s just check one more time, okay? Together.”

Alex nodded hesitantly, and I crouched down again, shining the flashlight under the bed.

Nothing. Just the usual stuff, more books, more Legos, a stray Poké Ball plush.

I felt Nate’s eyes rolling from the top bunk without even looking up. “Told you.”

“Enough, Nate,” I said.

Alex tugged on my sleeve. “But it was there, Dad. I know it was.”

I opened my mouth to respond when Nate cut in again, sitting up abruptly. “Can you guys not do this right now? I’ve got a stupid math test first thing in the morning, and you’re scaring the crap out of him for no reason.”

“I’m not scared!” Alex snapped, his voice breaking.

“Enough!” I barked, harsher than I meant to. Both boys froze, and the room went quiet except for the faint hum of the air purifier.

“Everyone back to bed,” I said firmly. “Now.”

Nate grumbled and flopped back down, pulling the blanket over his head. Alex hesitated but eventually shuffled to his bed, still clutching Bulbasaur.

I stayed there for a minute after they were both lying down, staring at the empty space under the bed. Everything looked normal. But as I stood up to leave, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had been watching.

For a couple of weeks, everything was quiet.

Alex stopped waking me up at odd hours. Nate didn’t complain about losing sleep. It was as if the whole “monster under the bed” thing had never happened.

Life went back to normal, or as normal as it gets with two boys. Alex buried himself in Minecraft and Pokémon battles, while Nate still came at us with that 12-year-old-I-know-it-all attitude. I’d even started to believe I’d imagined that weird, shifting shadow under the bed.

But then Alex came to breakfast one morning, scratching his arm furiously.

“Stop that,” I said, passing him a plate of eggs. “You’re going to make it worse.”

“It’s itchy,” he whined, holding out his arm. Tiny red bumps dotted his skin, like mosquito bites.

“It’s the weather,” Nate muttered through a mouthful of toast. “You always get that when it’s dry out.”

He was right. Every winter, Alex’s skin flared up, and I’d have to slather him in lotions so much he ended up looking white, kind of ghostly. It was annoying, sure, but normal. Nothing to worry about.

Mom grabbed the bottle of moisturizer we had used last time and handed it to Alex. “Here. Rub some of this on, and stop scratching.”

Alex groaned but obeyed, smearing the lotion across his arm.

Over the next few days, though, it got worse.

The bites (or whatever they were) spread up his arms and down his legs. He woke up one morning with deep red scratches on his shoulders, as if he’d been clawing himself in his sleep.

“It’s just dry skin,” I told him when he showed me, though even I didn’t believe it anymore. The marks looked too precise, too deliberate.

“You think it’s bed bugs?” my wife asked that night, peering into Alex’s room like she was expecting to see a swarm of insects on the floor.

“Maybe,” I said, though I’d already checked the sheets and mattress. Nothing. Not even a speck of dirt.

“Could be his nails,” she said, gesturing to his hands. “If he’s scratching in his sleep, he might be doing it to himself.”

That seemed logical, but something about it didn’t sit right with me. The scratches were too clean, too sharp, like they’d been made by something smaller. Something with claws.

I didn’t tell her that, of course. But I could feel she didn't believe it was hisndoing, either.

The next morning, Alex came to breakfast looking worse than ever. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, and he barely touched his food.

“What’s wrong, buddy?” I asked, trying to keep my voice light.

He shrugged. “I couldn’t sleep.”

“Nightmares again?”

He shook his head. “No… not really. But I heard it.”

My stomach tightened. “Heard what?”

“The scratching,” he said, looking up at me with wide, terrified eyes. “It’s back, Dad. I know it is.”

Nate snorted from across the table. “It’s probably mice or something.”

But Alex shook his head. “It’s not mice. It’s the monster. I know it is.” Nate just did the eyes. My god, those eyes that I hope I have never made in front of them. Was it exasperation? Losing your temper? Either way, kids can do that to you. Sometimes you have a meeting at 6AM and the last thing you want to do in the middle of the night is crawl under the bed looking for monsters. Mom said she would clean today and ger rid of whatever thing was scratching under their beds.

That night, I decided to check on him. Not because I believed him, but because… well, I didn’t know what else to do.

I waited until both boys were asleep, then crept into their room, flashlight in hand. I knelt by Alex’s bed, pulling the blankets back carefully. His arm was draped across Bulbasaur, his tiny chest rising and falling steadily.

Everything looked fine.

And then I heard it.

A faint, rhythmic sound, like nails dragging across the tiles on the floor.

I froze.

The sound was coming from under the bed.

I didn’t want to look.

Every instinct told me to back away, to wake Alex and Nate. To run. But I couldn’t leave without knowing. If I walked away now, the sound would follow me. It would crawl into my head, scratching at my sanity until I cracked.

I slowly lowered myself to the floor, the flashlight trembling in my hand. The scratching sound grew louder, more insistent, as if it knew I was listening.

The beam of light pierced the shadows under the bed. At first, all I saw were the usual suspects: a couple of crumpled Pokémon cards, a lost sock, and a pile 
(smaller, but still a pile) of Legos. But as I swept the flashlight to the far corner, I saw it.

A hand.

It was pale, almost translucent, with long, spindly fingers tipped with black, pointed nails. It pressed against the floorboards, scratching lazily, almost thoughtfully.

My breath caught in my throat. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t scream.

The hand stopped.

Slowly—deliberately—it slid back into the darkness, disappearing into a place the flashlight couldn’t reach.

I shot up, banging my head against the bottom of Alex’s bedframe. My hand flew to my mouth to stifle a scream. My heart pounded so loud I was sure it would wake the boys.

“Dad?”

The whisper made me jump. I spun around to find Alex sitting up in bed, rubbing his eyes.

“Go back to sleep,” I hissed, barely able to keep my voice steady.

“What are you doing?” Nate grumbled from the top bunk.

“Nothing,” I said quickly. Too quickly.

Alex looked at me, his face pale in the dim light. “It’s back, isn’t it?”

“No,” I lied. “Nothing’s back. Just go to sleep.”

He didn’t look convinced, but he lay back down, clutching Bulbasaur so tightly I thought the seams might burst. 

"Can I sleep with you tonight?" he muttered. After some hesitation, I said "Get in bed with your brother". Nathan barely moved making way for his little brother, being this not the first time I'd make them sleep together.

I backed out of the room, leaving the door open just a crack. My mind raced as I made my way to the kitchen. I grabbed a glass, filled it with water, and leaned against the counter, trying to steady my shaking hands.

What the hell had I just seen?

It couldn’t be real. Things like that didn’t exist. Maybe I was just overtired. Maybe I’d let Alex’s nightmares get into my head. Maybe too much stress, too much work and too little sleep was messing with my head.

But deep down, I knew better.

The next morning, Alex had more scratches.

This time, they weren’t small. Four long, parallel marks ran down his back, jagged and raw.

“What the hell happened?” I asked, spinning him around to get a better look.

“I don’t know,” he whimpered. “I woke up like this.”

Nate walked in, yawning. “What now?”

“Look,” I said, pointing to Alex’s back.

Nate blinked, then frowned. “Maybe he’s doing it to himself.”

“I’m not!” Alex cried. “I told you, it’s the monster!”

I shot Nate a warning look, and he held up his hands. “Okay, okay. It’s not him. Chill. It wasn't me either, I slept like a baby".

I crouched down to Alex’s level, my hands on his small shoulders. “Listen, buddy,” I said. “Are you sure you’re not scratching in your sleep? Maybe without realizing it?”

He shook his head furiously, his eyes filling with tears. “It’s not me. It’s real. Why won’t you believe me?”

“I—” I started, but the words caught in my throat. What could I say? That I did believe him? That I’d seen something under his bed? That whatever was leaving these marks wasn’t human?

Because I knew, in my gut, that was the truth.

That night, I couldn’t sleep.

I was awake, still working and preparing an early morning meeting, every creak of the house sending a jolt of adrenaline through my veins. I kept hearing Alex’s voice in my head: “Why won’t you believe me?”

The truth was, I did believe him. I just didn’t want to admit it—not to him, not to myself. Because if I admitted it, then I had to face it. And I didn’t know how.

At around 2 a.m., I heard it again.

The scratching.

It was faint at first, like a distant echo. But it grew louder, more frantic, until it was impossible to ignore.

I shot out of the small office and ran to the boys’ room.

The door was open. The room was pitch black, the small nightlight they usually left on flickering weakly.

“Alex?” I whispered, my voice shaking. “Nate?”

No response.

I stepped inside, fumbling for the light switch. My fingers brushed the wall, but before I could flip the switch, the nightlight blinked out completely.

The scratching stopped.

For a moment, there was nothing but silence.

And then, a low, guttural growl filled the room.

My stomach dropped. I tried to turned the flashlight on my phone and aimed it at the bunk bed. When I finally got it on, I flashed it on Nate's face pale, his eyes immediately opening wide with terror.

“Dad,” he whispered. “It’s under the bed.”

I didn’t think. I dropped to my knees and shone the light under the bed.

What I saw made my blood run cold.

It wasn’t just a hand this time.

The thing under the bed was crouching, its body twisted and elongated, its skin a sickly, translucent gray. Its eyes glowed faintly in the darkness, and its mouth stretched into an impossibly wide grin, filled with jagged, uneven teeth.

It moved, jerking its head toward me, its bones cracking with every motion. Its grin widened, and it let out a sound that was somewhere between a laugh and a snarl.

I froze, paralyzed by fear.

“Dad!” Alex’s scream snapped me out of it.

The thing lunged.

I scrambled back just as it reached for me, its claws scraping against the floor. It moved so fast, too fast, disappearing into the shadows.

Nate leaped from the top bunk, landing beside me with a thud. He grabbed my arm, his voice trembling. “What the hell is that thing?”

“I don’t know,” I said, pulling him close. “Where’s Alex?”

“He was here,” Nate said, his voice breaking. “I swear he was right here!”

My heart pounded as I scanned the room, the flashlight darting over the beds, the walls, the floor. And then I saw it.

The closet door was ajar.

Something moved inside, shifting the clothes on their hangers.

“Alex?” I called, my voice cracking.

No response.

I stood, gripping Nate’s arm tightly. I stepped toward the closet, every muscle in my body screaming at me to stop, to turn around, to run.

I reached for the door handle and yanked it open.

Alex was there, curled up in the corner, his arms wrapped around his knees. He looked up at me, his face streaked with tears.

“It tried to take me,” he sobbed. “It tried to pull me under.”

I scooped him up, holding him tight. “It’s okay,” I lied. “You’re safe now.”

But we weren’t.

Wife came bursting in, trying to sound upset but with fear in her eyes. How could I explain this? Nate did a much better job than me, and Alex was just sitting there in shock, mom holding him like a baby. After every nonsense sentence like "the monster took Alex into the closet" and "it looked like something ugly but like it didn't quite have a shape", my wife would just turn to me and I silently nodded. She grabbed the kids and went to out room. I just stood there for a moment, wondering what to do now whej I instinctively flicked the light switch off. And as I turned to leave the room, I felt it.

A cold, bony hand brushed against my ankle.

I ran.

We spent the rest of the nigh in our room, all four of us huddled together on the big bed. The boys eventually fell asleep, but I stayed awake, clutching a kitchen knife and watching the shadows shift across the walls.

"What the fuck are we going to do, dear? I'm scared, please! Do something! Call the cops or an exorcist or something!" came my wife's upset words. But who would believe us? After all, we didn't believe him.

In the daylight, it was easier to pretend it hadn’t happened.

But Alex’s scratches didn’t go away. They got worse.

By the end of the week, his arms and legs were covered in raw, angry marks.  The pediatrician couldn’t explain it. She said it might be an allergy, maybe stress. She recommended creams and antihistamines, but nothing helped. And then Nate started waking up with scratches, too.

The final straw came when Alex showed me his Pokémon plushes one morning.

Their seams were ripped, their stuffing spilling out. But it wasn’t just wear and tear—it was deliberate. Precise.

Like something with claws had torn them apart.

I sank to my knees, pulling him into my arms. “I’m sorry,” I whispered, choking back tears. “I’m so sorry.” He looked at me as if he had some deep understanding that I could try my best, but still would be sorry. And for the last time, hugged me as tight as his little arms would allow him.

That night, I barricaded the boys’ room. I pushed the beds against the closet dllt, stuffed the closet with boxes, and duct-taped the edges of the door shut. Made the kids sleep with us again. Couldn't dare leave them alone after the sun was gone.

But it didn’t matter.

Because at 3 a.m., I woke up to Alex screaming. We all did. But just as sudden as it started it stopped and everything was silent.

And he was gone. Me and my wife ran to their room.

The barricades were untouched. The closet door was still sealed. But he wasn’t there.

“Alex?” I whispered. Nothing. Then I saw it.

The closet door was slightly cracked open, and something—a dark, shadowed shape—shifted inside.

“Stay here,” I said to my wife, my voice shaking. She didn't stay, just grabbed my arm and moved along with me.

I approached the closet slowly, every fiber of my being screaming at me to run. But I couldn’t.

“Alex?” I called again, louder this time, stepping closer.

Then—

The closet door flung open.

Alex wasn’t inside.

But the thing that was made my stomach churn.

A large, twisting mass of limbs and pale, stretched skin. It was crouching there, staring at us with eyes too wide, too hungry. Its mouth stretched impossibly far, cracking as it grinned.

I couldn’t breathe.

Wife screamed. “What is that?! What is that thing?”

I could barely speak. My throat was tight, choked with terror. “I don’t know,” I whispered.

Before I could react, it lunged.

The thing screamed, but it wasn’t its voice. No, it was Alex. It sounded exactly like him, calling to me from somewhere in the back of the room.

"Mom, Dad, help me!"

I turned, but there was nothing there.

When I looked back, the creature was gone.

Nate was just behind us now. “What was that? Where is he? Where’s Alex?”

“I don’t know,” I said, my hands trembling. “I don’t know what it is, but it's real. And it’s taking him.”

“Stop!” she shouted, pulling away from me. Her face was flushed, her breath shallow. “Stop, STOP! I can’t handle this. I can’t! We need to tell someone and-"

“No! No one will believe us, damnit!.” I grabbed her by the shoulders, forcing her to look at me. “This isn’t a joke. There’s no explanation. Whatever’s under that bed... it’s real.”

Her face crumpled, her eyes filling with tears. "But how do we fight it? How do we even stop it?"

I didn’t know.

And then I heard it again—Alex’s voice.

"Mom, Dad... please..."

It was coming from inside the walls.

That’s when it hit me—we weren’t safe.

Neither of us.

The room was silent, suffocatingly silent. For a moment, I thought I had lost my mind. Wife was still sobbing uncontrollably, but there was nothing else. No growls. No scraping. No Alex... Just... stillness.

I don’t know how long it took, but eventually, the front door bursted open. I don’t know if it was the wife or me, but we both rushed toward it. The hallway was dark, like we were walking through a void. My heart was still pounding, my hands trembling, but I didn’t care anymore.

We ran, just darting toward the stairs, down toward front door. And there, outside the door, standing as if nothing was wrong—was Alex.

He was standing there, his back to us, his small frame illuminated by the faint light from the hallway.

I almost collapsed right there, half in relief, half in terror.

“Alex...” I said, my voice breaking. My mouth was dry, but I could hardly speak through the lump in my throat.

He didn’t turn around. He just stood there, facing the door, unmoving.

“Alex,” his mom called again, softer this time. “Please... we’ve been looking for you, baby.”

He finally turned around. And I can't remember if I screamed or cried.

He looked like Alex... but not.

His face was the same. His clothes were the same. But his eyes...

God, those eyes.

They were too wide. Too black. And they didn’t have that spark of life anymore. They were cold, empty.

“You wouldn’t believe me, huh?” Alex said, his voice low. Too low. It sounded like it was coming from far away, like it wasn’t even his voice anymore.

His lips curled into a twisted, hollow smile, one that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “You never listened to me, did you?”

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t speak.

That thing had taken him.

But it didn’t just take his body.

It took the light inside him. The part of him that had been my son.

And now, standing before us, he was something else. Something we couldn’t even begin to comprehend.

His mom reached out, her trembling hand stopping just short of touching his shoulder. “Alex? Baby... please.”

He didn’t even flinch. He just stood there, staring.

“You won’t believe me,” he repeated, his voice softer now, but colder, almost... disappointed.

“I told you.”

He was gone. Not physically, but worse. And the thing... Was it gone? 

But we knew. We knew something was still watching us.

The thing—whatever it was—was still in our house. Still in Alex.

We can't escape it. It had made its home here. And now, we have to believe it.
