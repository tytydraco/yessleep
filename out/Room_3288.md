I ambled down the corridor, my flashlight, a cone in front of me, the inky blackness, covering each surface as a thick fog. Making the cream white walls and golden columns become duller to the eye. The slow static of my radio, quivered into my ear, overtaking the small, heavy squelching of my boots in the carpet. The air lifted a mix of must, tea and old books into my nostrils as I scanned over the passage.

Was it really necessary to shut even the lights off? I thought to myself, I mean seriously, I know the electricity for a house this big must cost a fortune but still.

My radio started to crackle to life.

“Hey, just a regular check in, how are you doing?” the voice said

“Fine, fine, same quiet dingy hallways as usual” I answered followed by a loud beep

“I'm going to spin round and finish up this patrol, then head back to the kitchen”

“Fine, fine, just remember to check room 3288 on your way back”

Room 3288 huh? It was on the handout the owner’s housekeeper gave us when we arrived, it's almost as though this manor has little rhyme or reason to it when it comes to room numbers, wooden planks bolted haphazardly next to or above doors, with a number scribbled unceremoniously in black paint. 3288 was the highest room number after room 16. I took a detour the cream carpets and walls haunting me as I went, until I found the door. The only one in which multiple wooden planks had been hammered into the door, with a long metal bar underneath.

“Door is fine, no scratches or dents, making my way to the kitchen”

“Looks like we are in for a long night” he said in his usual monotone voice

I took a 30-minute rest, she had given us the kitchen to relax in and clearly stated we couldn’t do the same in the rest of the house. at first, I thought it a little weird, but she did provide food and drinks through the housekeepers that would restock it each day so you can’t catch me complaining.

Opening a can of Pepsi and slowly drinking it to the scrolling of Instagram, sadly she had banned alcohol on the premises, citing in letter that we needed to be focused on the house, not ‘wallowing in drink’, but Will had promised to bring some in.

My radio crackled to life again, the red light starting to blink.

“Sorry to interrupt you sunshine, but I have noticed door -1 seems a little twitchy on the camera, you mind checking it out?”

“sure” I said with a groan, stretching as I got up, the flashlight upturned, reflecting off the stark white ceiling and wall tiles.

I stopped and pulled my hand back up to my radio

“Twitchy?”

I said with a hint of confusion

“Yeah, it seems a bit odd”

Even over the radio I could feel him leaning into the monitor to get a better look.

“I'll give it a look, since I have not done anything outside yet, and I'll have to do it eventually”

I grabbed a black coat off one of the hooks and buttoned it tight. I made the slow walk through the corridors before reaching the grand front door, flanked by the 2 staircases to the upstairs. I grabbed the ornate handle and pulled it inwards.

I was greeted by rain, light drizzle, illuminated by my flashlight, I couldn't see the last of the steps in front of me. I navigated myself, using the railing along the side of the steps, making my way round and to the left. The cover of my coat, making a small scraping sound along my ears.

I parked my body against the wall and started shuffling until I got to the outside entrance to the basement. Two wooden sky facing doors that were usually just about visible from the large window that overhung it. When I had started that evening, they were blocked by several rows of planks nailed at each side, with a chain and lock threaded between the handles. When I got there it seemed much the same, I gave a thumbs up to the security camera over my head, that hung and blinked. The wooden planks had all been ripped in half, their visages hanging each side, held by their nails, the minus sign and the 1 split, with black paint dripping onto the dirt. The chain, a sorry shadow with each link strained and mangled.

“I think you caught something will” I said back into the radio

“Make sure to keep a look out, we never know when they might make another attempt”

Static greeted me before Will answered.

“Sure, I'm glad I caught it before they could go through the chain”

Before I went back inside to get another few planks to re barricade the doors, I scanned the surrounding area, walking to the field in front of the manor yet saw or heard nothing. Just endless metres of wet grass, the smell of moisture and the sound of the wet push of my boots against the soil.

I nailed the boards into place, and fetched the key for the lump of metal that was the padlock. I opened it and fed a new chain through, having eyes at the back of my head as I did so.

I finished and stumbled back inside, shaking the rain off my coat placing it firmly back on its hanger.

“Do you intend to take it easy this night?” my radio crackled

“of course” I replied between mouthfuls of a snickers.

“The note said I only have to do one round, and checking each of the 3 floors and 18 rooms is a long, drawn out and paranoid filled bore” 

I took another mouthful and threw the wrapper into the bin on the other side of the table I was sat at.

“Besides, if whoever it was at the outside entrance to the basement tries again, you're sure to catch him”

He laughed

“Sure, but we will be in for a long night, I would start doing patrols anyway just to keep myself moving”

“Then why don’t we swap places?” I retorted sarcastically

“Yeah, and when the mistress finds us in swapped positions directly opposing what she told us to do ill make sure it’s your pay that's docked”

I sighed heavily once again getting up from my chair and picking up my flashlight. I decided to start from the ground floor, since it was the largest, and contained room 3288 that Will seemed too fixate over. I mulled it over in my mind, perhaps a storage of gold or maybe a secret laboratory. I chuckled. The house was still and when my flashlight wasn’t on, it was completely dark, no light of the moon, nor any candles as mandated.

A feeling of unease spread over me, like the darkness had started to suffocate my body and push against it. slowly marching forward to room 3288, I stopped, holding my light up. Same as usual, same wooden planks, same metal bar, same scrawled numbers. I let my hand weave its way to the handle and try the door, feeling the sudden stopping of my wrist.

“I should've figured” I said, slowly turning and pointing my flashlight forward again.

As I walked away, subtly, just behind the sound of my feet against the carpet, a faint scratching, I whisked my body around. Shutting off my flashlight, waiting for my eyes to adjust. The scratching did not stop, nor intensify, it simply moved from the behind the centre of the door to the bottom. I looked down, squinting, a thin curled finger jutted out from beneath the wooden frame. I stepped back quietly, as the nail nearly hit my boot. The skin was whitish grey with dark red or purple spots? around the joints. I watched as the finger inched its long black nail into the floorboard and pulled back, creating a low-pitched scraping noise as it went back to the door.

I could hear my breath, in and out, as I watched it slide back beneath the door. A low mumble answering its entry, like the low warbling of a choking bird, before silence returned.

The aching of my body reminded me of my stillness. I backed off slowly, my eyes firmly locked to the bottom of the door. Tip toeing along the corridor, making sure to glance every few seconds.

Once I was far enough away, I radioed into will telling him to watch his cameras closely, he answered with a tired “fine”. My eyes in the darkness could have been playing tricks on me, but the sounds I heard were definitely real. At least it was behind a sealed door, I tried to comfort myself, putting as much distance between me and room 3288 as possible. The rain outside was beginning to lessen, and the windows showed the umbral visage of the fields before me, as though viewing the world through dark blue stained glass. I walked past the window that sat atop door –1, and I stared in horror. Both doors had been flung open as the newly hammered planks painfully swung on their nails. I started for the front door nearby, checking if it was locked.

“Will! Will!” I harshly whispered into my chest.

“Yes?” he replied groggily

“Have you noticed anything on cameras inside the house?”

I waited for a few beligued seconds

“No, nothing out of the ordinary”

“Door -1 has been broken in to, the one outside the main entrance”

“Oh, that's fine” he retorted

“that's the only entrance into the basement, and there is a door behind it that I'm sure they cannot get through”

“How do you know that?”

“We both started working the same day, and you haven’t been into the basement. Let alone outside of the camera room” I said with a rapidly growing voice.

He paused for a few moments leaving my ears with static before answering

“As part of my package I got given the blueprints for the building so I can see everything”

“don’t worry, I know what you're thinking, you don’t have to go down into the basement to look for a would-be robber”

“There is a second door as I said, but it seems whatever in the basement is heavily guarded as there is a heavy vault door past a few steps, its labelled quite obviously here” he said patronisingly.

“How did you miss them literally breaking into the basement” I half murmured angrily towards the red light”

“And how did you not hear it?” He answered

I calmed myself down before checking the front door again and moving back to door –1. I scanned it anxiously, looking for any sign of movement before thankfully walking back to the kitchen. I locked the doors in the kitchen and didn’t move out until morning when the housekeeper came to relieve us.

I almost thought about taking that night off, but when I phoned the housekeeper about it that afternoon she wouldn’t have it, ordering me in, despite my nervous pleading.

It felt unsettling to say the least in that house as the sun went down. The housekeeper had rebound the door to the basement, she assured us that nothing had been stolen or broken inside the basement or house. I quickly reverted back into my normal routine as the previous night's images slipped. 

I stayed in the kitchen for the first few hours until 1:00am when I made my round, I hadn’t heard a word from Will, although he must be tired. I walked through the house swinging my flashlight from side to side. As I walked past the front door hearing a crash, a raspy snapping sound. I practically ran towards the window in the left side hallway to watch the doors to the basement fling open. I turned my light off and crouched down as if to make myself smaller, like someone would not have already seen or heard me. Nothing moved in the darkness between the 2 wooden doors. And once again I found myself sneaking backwards from the window until it was out of sight.

I locked myself in the kitchen and prepared for a long night of anxiety and snacking before I remembered that I hadn’t completed that patrol. If the housekeeper checked the camera footage and saw that I hadn’t I might have my pay docked or be fired entirely for not doing my job. I winced as I realised this, cursing under my breath as I peeked through each of the doors.

I tried to resume my usual route, finishing the rest of the ground floor as much as possible, scanning the looming windows as I went past them.

My anxiety did not dip, the silence only becoming more prominent, as each pillar and lamp honed into view like a lighthouse or island out of mist, starting to make me skittish.

Tt was just standing there on the other side of the glass. As I went through checking the last window, a large what I guess would be called a humanoid stood there, slowly pacing along the width of the glass. It was horrific, as though a child had been given white play dough and asked to make something human. It was thin, with arms to long for its frame, so much so that it hunched at the weight of them, every slow footstep seemed like it would make it topple over. It must have been quite tall as it rose nearly halfway up the window despite the window being at least 3ft off the field floor. I staggered back, unable to stop my hands from shaking as it stopped, making its long arms sway. It tilted its head in my direction, white skin covered cavities where eyes should have been, a broken nose lightly dampened in red. It jerked its head to the side. Its skin was a perfect white, no blotches, pimples or bruises, making it’s hairless nature burn into my eyes. I felt the gulp run down the back of my throat, and when it settled all at once I dashed back into the main hall, running towards the kitchen I violently wrested with the radio on my left side.

“WILL!!, WILL! We've got an intruder outside the house! Call the police! I don’t think this thing is human! WILL? WILL? You're there, right?”

I felt a pit rise in my stomach as I slammed the doors of the kitchen shut after I entered. It had no windows and so was dark and quiet without the candles. I pressed my ear up to the door I had entered through, placing my flashlight down and off. A small crash, that bounced throughout the walls of the house and entered my ear. My hands were shaking again, the shivering almost visceral. I held my hands together and remembered Will. The camera room was on the 3^(rd) floor from what I had been told.

But with that thing out there it's going to be difficult to get around, especially if it moves erratically. I'll need to use the servant staircase that led to the 2^(nd) floor and then find another to get to the 3^(rd) floor. 

I tried to calm my nerves, I lit a candle in the centre of the table and whispered a prayer, before standing in silence for a few moments, trying to stop myself from shaking. I was interrupted, a creaking floorboard muffled from the door opposite. I blew the candle out and slowly sneaked through the door to the servant's stairs, as I started to climb, I could hear a faint scratching.

I managed to wind myself precariously up the metal stairs, making sure the heel of my boots never touched the surface, before opening and painstakingly inching the door back until it rested against its frame. 

Daring to turn my flashlight back on, I was greeted with the crimson red colouring of the second floor. I started to sneak about the corridors trying to find the next set of stairs and avoiding anywhere that I thought led to the main stairs. That central area of the house is a death trap. A wide-open space where you can just about see everything and anything in there can always see you.

I had never used the servant’s stairs before, and it took me a while to find them, but after searching quietly through several rooms and passages, I found another set of spiralling metal stairs.

I made another attempt to contact Will whispering into my radio and slightly recoiling each time it beeped and assaulted me with another round of static. I crept up the metal staircase, and slowly persuaded the door forward. The 3^(rd) floor is much like the 1^(st). More cream-coloured walls and carpets, with wooden arches and pillars. I snuck through until I found the first metal door I had seen in the building. The door had a sign with a security camera on it, squiggled in black paint. I hadn’t seen it before due to its nestled nature among the within the interior of the house, hidden by the door of another room.

I whispered will’s name to the door before slowly knocking three times, both gave no answer. With a heavy hand, i pushed the door forward, taking a considerable amount of effort to shove it forward, almost making me tip over forwards as it gave. 

Everything was doused with a heavy layer of cobwebs and dust, with a desk and chair propped against the back wall, the room was quite small, so much so that I nearly hit my head on the chair when I fell. On the desk sat a keyboard and mouse with many, many blacked out screens and monitors.

I tried to stifle the growing fear and confusion tingling up my spine. Fuck it I thought almost saying it out loud, I need to at least get out of here. I felt the tinge of anger in that moment and resolved to give Will a real beating once I got out. All I had to do was go down the way I came and get out the back, while making sure not to make any noise that would attract that thing, or just run into it haphazardly.

I went back and painstakingly began to close the door, but when it finally gave and rushed back into its frame, it made a deafening screech and bang, that reverberated and crunched as the door argued with the metallic base of the door way.

I nearly leapt backwards, and froze as the silence returned. The only part of my body moving was my head and neck that hurried turned from side to side longing and wishing for a hiding spot. Finally, I could just make out a large closet to one side of the corridor, flanked by 2 sets of armour.

I hurriedly bungled myself into the closet, as I peered through the wooden grating at the top. The silence had carried on and was splitting my mind with its overwhelming presence. I finally settled down as the moments started to blur into seconds. Maybe it cannot hear so well? I thought to myself or it had never entered the building? I scoffed quietly, disappointed in my lack of bravery and the sheer eccentric nature of my situation. But then I started to hear something, I staggered my breathing, one hand over my mouth. It was hard to make out at first, but then turning into a soft pushing of something on the carpet. It only happened once every few seconds, yet sounding rushed and slowed at different points, getting closer.

The thing honed into view between the wood, causing my body and hands to sweat profusely and my head to scream. It took long, painful footsteps as it passed by. It stopped next to the door that opened to the camera room entrance, looking around. Before moving on.

I kept my breath held until I could not hear anything anymore, waiting seconds, until I felt safe again.

I gradually peeled myself out of the closet, I did not know how many sets of stairs were on the third floor, since I had only used the main stairs on my rounds. The servants stairs were out, seeing as they were in the direction that thing went. I moved to the right and decided to brave the main stairs rather than taking the time to search for another staircase. I wanted out. I painfully snuck through the cream hallways almost hitting things without my flashlight, until the area finally opened up into the main stairs towards the 2nd floor.

I held on to the handrail and inched my way down the stairs. 

“Why could they not have the main stairs go all the way to the ground floor?“ I cursed under my breath.

I constantly was checking behind me as I made my way through the second floor to the servants stairs to the kitchen.

In the darkness, without my light on, I tripped over the side of a table, just managing to right myself instead on tumbling into the floor. My flashlight dropped, I watched it fall and clatter to the ground, missing the carpet and hitting the wooden floor boards.

As I looked around frantically for a place to hide, a faint scream echoed through the house, as though a child in pain hollered in jubilation. I made my way to the side of the corridor and stood as still as a pillar, trying to stop myself from passing out. 

I heard it again, the soft squelching of large feet on carpet, but more laboured, followed by a cracking of bones. It finally entered view causing me to recoil and plaster my hands across my mouth and nose silently its face peering around the corner. But what terrified my most was its movement. It made long, exaggerated, tip toeing movements, as though it had jumped out from a cartoon. Arms up to balance its body, its knees bending and lifting it making the slight cracking noise, as it reached its apex.

It tip toed slowly until it got in front of me, the light of the moon finally shining through the clouds, the rain stopping, and so did it.

It’s head turned staring directly at me with 2 limp pieces of white skin.

I watched as the 2 long arms were brought up to it’s face, the skin moved to reveal its eyes, a black pupil with white iris, and a white pupil with a black iris.

As the creature’s eye lids lifted, the hands came up either side of its face, fingers spreading out suddenly from clenched positions. Jubilation plastered across its frame.

The curved mouth opened, revealing rows of yellowed molars.

I took my last breath of fetid air.
