I need help your help. Yesterday I caught something. A disease or a parasite, I don't know. I woke up and went to get breakfast. A normal everyday bowl of cereal. I scarfed down the first bowl and decided that one wasn't enough. The second was poured and eaten in 5 minutes. My stomach rumbled and I knew that by some miracle I was still hungry. "Fair enough" I thought "cereal isn't much of a meal anyways". I opened the fridge and poured over the groceries my parents had stocked the fridge with. Fresh eggs, and a brand new packet of bacon caught my eye. The fixens for a big breakfast that was supposed to happen the next day. "Oh well" I thought to my self feeling the pit in my stomach growing "I'm hungry and I'm an adult I'll just buy them more later." Eggs and bacon fried, toast was stuffed into the toaster. A full breakfast sat in front of me on the table. My stomach growled and I dug in. It was only by the time I was done that I had realized that I had never even grabbed a fork. I just shoveled food into my face with my bear hands. Any average person would have had to pop their belt open after a feast such as that. Only I found that even after everything had hit my stomach I was still feeling peckish. 

Ok who cares right I'm telling you I ate a big breakfast. Plenty of people do that and don't bitch about It online. But for me it didn't stop. Hour by hour my thoughts were slowly consumed by the empty feeling in my stomach, a feeling that seemed to grow worse instead of better. Breakfast was finished, but I was not. I shoveled what ever I could into my mouth. By the time supper time had hit I had completely cleaned the fridge out. I sat in the kitchen gripping my stomach. Not in agony that I would burst from the unnatural meal I had just ingerted, but out of fear that somehow I had only grown more ravenous. I was surround by trash and wrappers from the food I had devoured. Looking upon the destruction I had brought to the food made me realize I hadn't even cooked the meats. I didn't avoid the stems and pits in the fruits. I ate it all. I began to cry a wave of deep shame was over me. My parents would be home soon. They would see me, their useless dropout son sitting in a pile garbage. The food they had purchased and their kitchen desecrated. Surely they would kick me out this time. A rumble, a gurgle, and a deep groan shook me from my tears. It was as if my stomach was mocking me begging me for more. Against any judgment I had left I obliged. It was if I was under a spell. Like my stomach was in the drivers seat and my brain was completely out of the vehicle. I at the canned goods, a full bread loaf, cat and dog food. Any and all food was cleaned out of the kitchen. I no longer cared what my parents would think. I had to fill this void inside my gut. Whatever it took.

A click and woosh, my parents were home. I had migrated to my room where I sat in my bed shaking from hunger pains. My mother called out for me. My father questioned "hey honey where did the fish go? They were all in the tan..." He was interrupted. The scream was loud and intense. My mother found my mess. There wasn't any time to clean it anyways. My parents yelled for me. They were furious. I didn't listen however. In fact I could barely hear them over the sound of my stomachs inssesant begging. The hunger had grown unbearable and nothing in the entire house could quench it. My parents approached my room. My hand clenched tightly. I knew that there would be trouble.My door swung open with the force of an angry bear. My father stood angry and confused. "What the hell is that mess in the kitchen and where did my fish go. In fact where's mittens and..." He didn't finish. The knife cut the rest of his rant as swiftly and it did his throat. My mother screamed again this time out of fear not anger. I took care of that however. It was dinner time. 

The only thing I left was bones. I was meticulous in licking each one clean, making sure every last piece of gristle was eaten. Here I lay on the blood soaked carpet asking if any of you know whats going on? Has anyone else ever been in this situation before? I've eaten everything in the house and my neighbor just got home and I think their making supper.
