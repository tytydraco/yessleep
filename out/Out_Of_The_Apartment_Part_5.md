We're still working on how to get out of town. I mean, we're not dead which I guess is a step in the right direction. We got the Hummer working again, and you'll all love this. We thought it shut off due to the wreck. Come to find out, Roscoe had forgotten to refuel it. We only realized this when by some miracle Drake got the engine to turn and observed this on the fuel gauge.

“Typical of that moron to forget something like this,” Van said.

“The dude just died. I know you and him hated each other, but don't be a fucking dick, alright?” I replied.

Van relented and kept his comments to himself.

“Okay, we know it works. Now, all we need is fuel,” Drake said.

Rummaging through the back, I produced a container of gas.

“It seems safe right now so I’ll go out and refill it,” I said.

“You might want to reload first,” Drake advised.

I heeded this, exchanging the clip of my pistol before hopping outside. We’d gotten lucky throughout the night, having avoided any encounters.  Although, there were some close calls. Another one of those crawling ones wandered by. It got too close to Drake and he stabbed it in the eye.

The most significant one was the one I encountered.  We were doing rotating shifts and it was my turn to keep watch.  Everything was fine until I spotted a figure off in the distance. This thing was tall. We’re talking a height that puts even Robert Wadlow to shame. Remember, the moonlight was my only source of visibility.

I’m watching this monstrosity jittering about. It wasn’t walking so much as striding.  I thought about waking up  Drake and Van so we could blast it away. Then I thought better and figured I should take a closer look with the binoculars. Good thing I did. Otherwise, we’d be zombie food.

What made me reconsider was what it did. Up close, it had several other distinct features. It was entirely bald and had no eyes or a nose. I don’t mean they were gouged out. There was only lumpy skin where they should have been. Its head was constantly shifting directions, presumably listening for any potential prey.

It stopped and I realized it had stepped into a boulder about as big as the Hummer. I thought it was going to bypass it, What happened instead that almost made me piss myself was as follows. It picked it up in both hands and crushed it. Let me repeat that.

It crushed a boulder the size of a fucking Hummer like it was a clump of powdered parmesan. Somehow, I didn't think our weapons were going to cut it. Even if they did, the noises would surely attract other zombies. All I could do was keep quiet in hopes it wouldn't wander to us. Then something happened that made my nuts retract.

Behind me, Van sharply inhaled and I realized he was going to snore. I'm not proud of what I did next. Acting on reflex, I punched him in the throat. He awoke, staring at me with a mixture of anger and confusion. Whatever he was going to say died in his throat.

I already knew it was behind me before I turned around, having felt its hot breath on my neck through the broken window. Its breath was foul like a decomposing body in a sewer and it was making my eyes water. I would have rather been smelling week-old roadkill left a week in the humid heat. Fighting the body's natural impulses is the hardest thing a person can do. Right then, mine was wanting to make me puke.

The zombie partially stuck its head in, growling as it did. Neither of us even did so much as breathe too fast. The seconds it remained in place were going by like hours. Finally, it decided it was wasting its time and went away. We still weren't going to make a sound until we were sure that thing was at least several miles away. On top of all this, we have no means of escape without getting shot so yeah, things are kinda shitty.

By then, the sun was peeking over the trees. We got Drake up and told him about what happened.

“God damn,” he had said, “good thing none of us had any beans last night.”

As I was standing out there, filling the tank, I started wondering what other shit we'd have to deal with. The regular zombies were already bad enough. Then we ran into the crawlers and now we have to contend with those tall ones. I'm calling them lankers.  Once I was through, I got into the passenger side.

“Alright, now let's see if they did anything,” Drake said, turning the ignition.

The Hummer roared to life, making us all ecstatic.

“Now we're getting somewhere, but how exactly are we getting out of here in this oversized thing?” Van asked.

The area where we'd ended up was a bad spot for any normal car, let alone a Hummer.

After glancing around, Drake replied, “Very carefully”.

He was to pull some maneuver where the tires on my side were hugging the base of the cliff. Meanwhile, Drake's side was snapping through branches. Eventually, we found a way back up to the road.

“Alright, we're back in business,” I said, then looking at our desolate town added, “For the most part.”

Our first course of action was heading back to the hotel. This shifted when we came to hordes of zombies shambling in front of it.

“They're here now too?” Drake said.

“Probably migrating,” I replied.

That raised the question, what would happen to the zombies if they ran out of food? Do they actually need to eat or are their cravings more akin to an addiction? Whatever the case, it was bad news for us.

“Where are we supposed to go now?” Van asked.

“They had to come from somewhere which means wherever they left should be safe,” Drake responded.

“Alright and how exactly do we go about figuring out where that is?”

“We go the opposite way they are.”

“Hang on,” I said,  mentally tracing the distance, “won’t that take us back to the apartments?”

Sure enough, it did. We parked at the convenience store down the road.

“Gus, what do you see over there?” Drake asked.

“There’s a handful of zombies,” I replied with the binoculars to my eyes.

“What kind?”

“Just the regulars, do you want to try and snipe at them?”

“Sounds good. I’ll handle it and you  two take care of the stragglers.”

We got in position with two sniper rifles. Drake climbed onto the Hummer roof while I was going to be covering him on the ground. Meanwhile, Van would be warning us if anything came from behind.

“Why don’t I get a gun?” he asked.

“You panic too much,” Drake told him. “Ready, Gus?”

I cocked my weapon.

“Go for it,” I said.

Things occurred uneventfully under the given circumstances.  Drake sniped at the zombies that were further away and I got the ones attempting to climb over the fence. Once that was over, we drove up to the gate. Drake used Roscoe’s keycard, causing it to beep and then open.

“Figures it’s working now,” Drake said.

Driving through, we could see corpses covering the sidewalk and grass that had been mostly eaten away.  From what I glanced at,  I saw several heads, feet, hands, and what may have been someone’s genitals.

“I didn’t think this place could get any shittier, but here we are,” I said, trying to lighten the mood.

“Do we really have to stay here?” Van asked.

“For now.  So do you want to crash in our apartment or are you heading back to your place?”

Van looked at a man by a fire hydrant with his intestines hanging out.

“I'll stick with you guys if it's all the same to you.”

Once parked, we went to the trunk to gather the groceries. While our backs were turned, we heard the sound of several guns being clicked.

“Turn around slowly.”

We did so to see an old lady with a revolver and a cane. Her face was covered in dirt. With her were some people, also armed. We squinted.

“Mrs. Sheaver?” Drake said in a perplexed tone.

She wasn't known for having a nice demeanor. If anyone got on her bad side whether by making too much noise or just looking at her funny, she would pelt them with rotten fruit. Nobody knows where she gets it.

“Damn right, we couldn't help but notice you and your friends have some food and weapons. You wouldn't mind sharing with us. Would you?”

“I mean, maybe we could negotiate-”

She pressed the barrel of her gun to his chest.

“On second thought, we're feeling generous.”

So we've managed to survive countless horrors for the better part of a week only to be robbed blind. Mrs. Sheaver had people search through the Hummer to take whatever they deemed valuable.

“Welp, this sucks,” I said.

“Quiet,” she snapped, “Now, tell us what you saw out there.”

“Why should we?”

She poked me with the gun.

“Oh, right.”

We relayed to her what we'd encountered and how we were effectively being trapped in town.

“Damhad theregovernment bastards,” she said. “The IRS will have my savings when they pry it from my cold dead hands.”

She then asked the others if they got everything to which they replied yes.

“Thanks for the shit, suckers.”

Mrs. Sheaver laughed while shuffling away.

“How the hell did she end up being the one in charge?” I wondered aloud.

That's a weird phenomenon where in a survival situation the worst qualified somehow become the leaders just because they happen to be more assertive.

“I don't know,” Drake said. “Let's check if we have anything left.”

Then we gathered up everything, bringing it inside and laying it on our table. Luckily, Mrs. Sheaver forgot to have people check us so we still had our handguns. As for everything else, that would remain to be seen.

“Okay, we have the two axes, the pistols,  two boxes of Jiffy cornbread mix, four bags of dried mix beans, a box of sweet tea, and I found this bag of Spicy Chili Doritos under one of the seats,” I said, taking stock of everything. “What do we have here already?”

“I know we still have like half a pack of bottled water and some gas station food from the other day,” Drake replied.

“The stuff here should last us at least a few days.”

“I mean, we could try going back over to Walmart.”

I thought about Drake's suggestion. It wasn't a bad idea. The issue was we had no way of knowing if the zombies had left that area or more had gone there. Furthermore, what if stronger ones were now there?

“What about the convenience store we were just at?” Van said.

“Oh yeah,” I replied. “It didn't look like it had been broken into so there's bound to be some good stuff in there. Why hasn't anyone else gone over there then?”

“Because they're shortsighted,” Drake told me. “I say we get started on boiling some beans and try to work out a plan.”

“To escape?” Van responded to him. “You saw what happened to Roscoe. They're not letting anyone out.”

“Then why not just bomb the town or something and be done with it?”

Our town was isolated. Therefore, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch for them to have the ability to do something like that and sweep it under the rug.

“I don't know,” Van said. “Maybe it's too costly or something. Explosives aren't exactly cheap. Whatever the case, it doesn't change the fact we're stuck here.”

“You know you are way too defeatist,” Drake replied.

Van responded with a shrug.

“Hang on,” I said. “I think I have an idea.”

“Shoot,” Drake replied.

“We cut through the woods.”

“Gus, I'm not sure if you're aware, but we already tried that.”

“Not on foot.”

I explained that I planned for us to walk straight through instead of taking the dirt road again. It's unlikely the government people would be there since there are only a few roads leading into town.

“So to sum up everything, we gather what we can and walk until we come across a main road,” I finished.

“Great plan, there's only one problem,” Van said.

“What?”

“There’s a bunch of zombies outside that want to eat us alive and you're talking a minimum of two days straight out there.”

“We didn’t see any in the woods,” Drake pointed out.  “I think if we keep moving we should get through it okay. I mean, you can stay here if you want. Me and Gus aren’t going to make you come with us.”

Van considered this and said, “I’ll have to sleep on it.”

That sounded like a good idea seeing as how we were going to wind down anyway. Right now, the sun is setting. I don’t see any zombies outside right now, but when I open the back door, I can hear their cries of hunger being carried by the wind. I wonder if any other neighborhoods have managed to hold down the fort? If they have then maybe that’s where they’re heading.

Drake is setting up my laptop with an HDMI cable to our living room TV. I have a lot of movies downloaded so that’ll be good to keep our minds off things until tomorrow. Wish us luck. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some [stove popcorn ](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/)to [make.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
