There’s this thing that happens when you drive through Central California, the really rural part. Groves of almond trees are planted in a lot of fields between corn, rice, and other crops. As you drive next to the grove, you can see all the way down rows of trees to the other end of the field for a split second. It depends on how fast you drive, but it sort of feels like watching an old film reel frame by frame.

I say this because I’ve moved here a year ago with my parents and sister before my freshman year of high school. I found the rows almost hypnotic at first, gazing down them to see what changed.

About 3 months ago, I was riding in the car with my dad, and we drove past this random field of trees. Like usual, I adjusted my gaze so I could see down the row.

In the first row, I saw a dark figure I assumed to be a man, maybe a farmer or a field worker. The next row flicked by, and I could have sworn it was the same silhouette. Each row had a similar silhouette. I was confused but chalked it up that there must have been some farmers checking trees. Then the field ended, and the cornfield next to it didn’t show anything like that.

We got to the next grove, and I recoiled in surprise as I watched twenty rows go by with similar silhouettes at the end of them. Then another field of silhouettes. Then another.

“Dad, are they doing something in the almond groves today?”

He glanced over at the passing trees. “No, I don’t know anything specific. Why?”

“I keep seeing people down the rows.”

“Hmm. Probably just checking irrigation lines. I don’t see anyone.”

We passed another field. More dark figures.

A week passed, and every almond grove we drove by had silhouettes down the row. They were getting just a little bit closer to the car as I rode to and from school with my friend, Jackson. He was two years older than me, but we were in the same grade since he got held back a couple years growing up. We both liked heavy metal. Jackson and I had been two of the kids who hadn’t hit their growth spurts as we entered high school, and as a new kid, I didn’t do a very good job of making friends. However, we both hit our growth spurts two months into our freshman year. By the end of the school year, he gained about 20 pounds and grew 6 inches, and I grew into a lanky 6’ 2” freak.

One evening when Jackson couldn’t take me home from work, my dad brought me home.

“How’s Jackson doing? You haven’t mentioned much about him lately.”

“He’s doing good.”

“How’d school finish out for him?”

“I don’t know, good, I think. We don’t really talk about grades that much.”

“What do you talk about?”

“I dunno, movies, music, cars. Not grades.”

I looked over into a grove as we drove past. The figure was there, silhouetted by the sun. Then it was closer. Each subsequent row it teleported closer to the road. My stomach dropped and my pulse thundered. Dark clothing. A medium built man. It was so close now. I struggled for breath and braced for the figure to jump through the car window as we passed the next row.

The field ended. I released a tense breath as the figure disappeared.

“What’s wrong?” said my dad.

I gathered my thoughts. “Nothing, I dozed off.”

I kept my eyes on the road for most of the week. Sometimes I’d see the figure out of my periphery and then just stare at the floor. It felt like I was a toddler playing hide and seek by covering his eyes.

After that second week of seeing it and nothing happening, my fear morphed into curiosity. I found myself excitedly looking out the window on the drive to and from school with Jackson. He caught me looking at it.

“What are you looking at?” He wiped his face with his black t-shirt. It was already hot for the morning.

“There’s this thing…in the trees. Down the rows. It looks like a person. I’ve been seeing it for two weeks now.”

“Yeah I have too.”

“You have?”

“Yeah I tried to drive around and figure out who it was, but its kinda hard when you’re trying not to crash.”

“Who? How do you know it’s a person and not a ghost or some trick of the light?”

“I never said it wasn’t a ghost, but you can only see it in almond groves for some reason. Not peaches or walnuts.”

“How long have you been seeing it for?”

“A couple of weeks.”

“You know anybody else who’s seen it?”

“No.”

“Just me and you I guess.”

We pulled into the school parking lot, even though school was out. In an effort to get to know more people while staying as far away from high school drama as possible, I had decided to sign up for the cross country team. Our school was pretty terrible and could barely string together the seven guys and seven girls needed for a varsity squad of each. I figured I could be a slow seventh, but didn’t realize that training started with a running club in the summer heat before practices started in the fall. Still, running club was a good excuse to get out of the house two mornings a week before I went to work or hung out with Jackson. My parents didn’t approve of shuttling me around at six in the morning, so thankfully Jackson covered for me. He kept talking about wanting to lift weights, so he took this as an opportunity to use the school gym while I ran. This gave us a lot of time to speculate on the way to and from practice.

“I bet it’s an alien.” He shook his nasty smelling protein shake before taking a swig.

“How would you prove that?”

“It can teleport, or make copies of itself.”

“No it’s gotta be a ghost. Those seem like ghost things. And no one else can see it.”

“You don’t know that.”

“Nobody else is talking about it.”

He burped. “Yeah whatever.”

We got scientific about studying the entity in a way only two teenage boys could. We’d accelerate and decelerate to make the “frame rate” speed up and slow down to see if we could get a better look. We tried a whole bunch of routes. The trees had to be big enough. If the trees were shorter than six foot, it wouldn’t show up. It only appeared when traveling between speeds of 32 and 93 miles per hour. Though we didn’t learn much, it was a fun experiment. Pretty soon the silhouette felt like a fun game we messed with, something like that made-you-look thing guys in middle school could use as an excuse to punch each other.

After the next practice, we stopped at a fruit stand on the way home from practice and talked to this Hispanic guy selling mangoes. He hadn’t seen anything weird in the trees. He was a cool dude, though, and those mangoes were good.

“Maybe it’s a cult,” I said on a whim, mango juice gushing down my chin.

“How would that work?”

“I dunno, they make sacrifices, get powers, they’re specifically targeting us.”

“MK Ultra, dude,” Jackson said, dripping juice on the already sticky leather seats.

“Please not MK Ultra.”

“What if these mangoes have LSD in ‘em or something?”

“That’s dumb.”

“This could have been a military testing facility where chemicals leaked into the ground and made everyone hallucinate.”

“I’m not going to dignify that with a response.” We chewed as the 8:00 sun beat across the windshield and made us squint.

“You’re right about one thing,” I added. “These mangoes are like crack.”

“Yeah, we gotta get more.”

“I’d blow my whole paycheck on ‘em.”

“I’d steal your paycheck to buy ‘em.”

“I’m the one who paid for them in the first place.”

“Yeah, your mom always said you were a sucker.”

I punched him hard in the arm, and he spit onto the steering wheel.

Cross country treated me ok. I lost a couple pounds in the first few weeks even if my diet was still crap. Most of the guys were dorks or geeks. They kept asking if I had seen obscure Youtube videos from 2011 or Dr. Who. I was surprised that I was able to keep up with them, given their gangly physiques looked built for long distance running. It was only once I met some of the girls I stopped thinking of cross country as social suicide. Particularly one of the juniors, Sophia.

Sophia, forgive my hyperbole, was perfect. You might disagree with that, but blonde girls in ponytails and running shorts are exactly my type. But it wasn’t just that she was my type. She was so…nice. Our first conversation was the first time I had talked to a girl and hadn’t seen her pull up her nose in disgust.

“I like your shoes,” she said as we stood next to each other in preparation to start our run.

“Thanks,” I flatly replied.

“Where’d you get them?”

“Um, shoe store.”

“Which one?”

“Uh. I don’t remember.”

She ignored my stupidity. “I like the colors. Sky blue and tan look good together.”

“Really? I thought they were kind of bland. I just grabbed the first pair that wasn’t a neon eyesore.”

“No I think they’re cute.”

Cute? I scrambled for an answer. “Is that a good thing?”

She grinned and tilted her head to the side. “Cute is great! You’ve got good taste.” How could anyone be this happy at 6 am?

“Well if you like them…” I said, uncertainly, my face feeling red.

“Like I said, they’re great.” With that, coach told us to start. She started her watch and ran away with my breath.

As I climbed into Jackson’s car after practice, he noticed me looking at her.

“So you joined the team for the babes? You sly dog!” He razzed me. “Which one you got your eye on?”

I was turning a deep shade of red. “Um…you know Sophia?”

“What? Dang it, dude! I was way into her!” he protested.

“Oh, sorry man. I’ll-“

“Ha! You should have seen your face!” He grinned. “No, dude, I’m not into her. Now the Latina chicks at the gym…ooh man, you should see the curves. Not like these skinny girls.”

“Whatever dude. I’m hungry.” I disliked how he often talked about girls that way.

We peeled out of the parking lot and started the drive back to my house, taking a route we hadn’t gone before to go get some breakfast. As groves passed by on both sides, I thought of a new test.

“Hey, if we look out opposite sides of the car, would there be two figures?”

“Good one! Let’s see how many of those cultists there are!”

“You said that was a stupid idea.”

“What the heck? I can’t change my mind on it?” He invited me to verbally spar.

“Just look out the window.”

We looked out opposite sides of the car. There was a silhouette on my side.

“You see it?” I asked.

“Yeah it’s a hot Latina girl now.”

He was getting on my nerves. “Shut up.”

“Fine. It’s still there. You?”

“Yeah. Same as always.”

“Guess that means we’re both cursed.”

We sighed. My mind felt fuzzy as I stared at the silhouette in another passing grove. It was like I was trying to look at something too far away between too many layers of glass.

I went out and bought a watch the next week for cross country practice after my coach told me to. I had saved up enough for one of the fancy smart ones, even though I didn’t have a lot of uses for it. It came with a few swappable bands, but I didn’t care, so I stuck with the sky blue one that came attached.

Sophia looked pleasantly surprised when she saw it. “You got a watch to match your shoes?”

I shrugged as I glanced at both. “Didn’t plan it.”

She giggled. Her nose scrunched when she did that. “You must have some divine guidance then.”

“Just lucky, I guess.”

“Do you like it?”

“I dunno, this is the first time I’m wearing it.”

She smiled. “I’m sure you’ll be faster now. I felt like it when I got mine.” She held up hers, the same model with a lighter blue strap.

“Woah, look at that, twinning.” I held mine up next to hers. Her hands were tiny compared to mine. “Maybe it is divine guidance.”

She smiled. Coach told us to start, and I felt like I was floating instead of running when I thought about her. She continued to steal my thoughts while riding home with Jackson.

He broke the silence. “It’s getting closer.”

My head whipped out of a daydream to look out the window. The silhouette was probably twenty yards from the road now.

“You see it?” Jackson asked.

“Yeah. That’s a lot closer.”

“I think I can see some details, dude. For some reason, it looks like a Hispanic guy.”

There was no way he was serious. “What do you mean?”

“No I’m serious.”

“You’re not pulling my leg?”

“No why would I be pulling your leg?”

I couldn’t see my side well with the sun rising behind it, but I didn’t think it looked like a Hispanic guy. Even though the face and hands were shadowed, the skin didn’t look dark enough.

“Looks like a white guy to me.”

“What? Clearly his skin is somewhat darker than ours.”

“No, I’m telling you, it looks like a white guy.”

“Ok whatever. You’re looking at the sun anyway.”

It was a long weekend afterwards that Jackson and I didn’t hang out because of work. I spent a lot of time daydreaming about Sophia.

“Hey, you doing anything for the 4th of July?” Jackson asked on the drive to the next practice.

“I don’t know. Probably watch some fireworks. My parents are chaperoning a girl scouts trip out of town for my sister.”

“Wanna watch a movie? My parents are gonna be gone.”

“Let me see. I’ll check and get back to you.”

As I was getting done with my run, hands on my knees and breathing heavily, Sophia walked over to me.

“Hey, we’re having a pool party at Ella’s house on the 4th and the whole cross country team is invited. You wanna come?”

Admiring the sparkle in her eyes, I replied without thinking. “Yeah sure! Um…do I, uh, bring a swimsuit?”

She tilted her head to the side and laughed. “It’s a pool party; of course!”

“Oh, uh, yeah, ok.” I huffed. “My brain, uh, needs some food to start working again.”

“Well we’ll have pizza and snacks there, so come hungry!” She giggled and scrunched her nose. “See you there!” She turned and jogged away. My gaze lingered on her.

Back in the car with Jackson, the AC was struggling to keep up, and I was gulping down all the water I had. “Hey, so about the 4th…”

“Yeah?” he said, mouth breathing. His black tank was already sweaty from his workout.

“I, uh, got invited to a pool party…by Sophia.”

“Cool.”

“That’s ok?”

His tone was downtrodden. “Yeah man, go hang with girls. We can hang out after.”

“That’s true. I don’t think it’s gonna go super late. Thanks man.” I had to justify to myself that he was ok with it. I changed the subject as we passed a grove.

“So how’d you figure out it’s a Hispanic dude that’s haunting us?”

“I don’t know, dark hair, tanner skin. He got really close to the car one time last week.”

“Like how close?”

“Probably 10 yards from the road. I could see his face a little.”

“What’d it look like?”

“I dunno, kinda sad. Had a beard or a mustache. But mostly just shadowy. Looking at the car go by.”        

“Where’d you see this?”

“Over on Turlock Road.”

“Can we drive over there quick?”       

“Yeah whatever. Can you at least grab me a protein bar out of the glovebox?”          

We drove there. The grove he was talking about had shallow rows, but a lot of them. Our silhouetted friend was jumping towards me with every row as Jackson hit the sweet spot of 32 mph. The sun was coming up from behind the mountains and backlighting the figure. I squinted into the sunlight as it got closer and closer. Black clothes. Dark silhouette. Dark hair. But the skin seemed lighter. It was so close to the car. The sunlight washed out the face. So familiar for some reason. The field ended.

“I don’t know, dude. Didn’t look Hispanic to me.”

“Whatever dude. Just keep saying it’s aliens.”

“Hey, we still haven’t ruled out a demon. Maybe we gotta recite a prayer and it will go away.”         

He let out a sigh. “Can I just go home? I’m tired and hungry.” I expected him to jump at the chance for more investigation but obliged his request.

The 4th of July couldn’t come soon enough. My parents dropped me off at a mansion with the intent that Jackson would pick me up. Ella’s house was way too nice, with a huge pool in the back, complete with a covered porch, mini bar with a fridge, diving board, waterfall, and jacuzzi. Probably thirty people mingled around the pool, including the whole cross-country team. I grabbed some pizza and engaged in nerd talk with the other cross-country guys before I got tapped on the shoulder.

Sophia stood there, glowing in the sunlight, a sky-blue bathing suit against her tan skin. She was right. Sky blue and tan went well together.

“You made it!” she said, giving me a side hug. I turned red, and not from sunburn. She smelled like sunscreen and flowers.

“Yeah, I did. And I, uh, wore my swim trunks.” The new shorts were kind of itchy.

“I like them! And they match your watch!” she said.

“Huh, guess I got lucky again,” I said, fist pumping in my mind that she had noticed.

“Are you gonna swim?” she said, tilting her head to the side.

“Don’t I have to wait thirty minutes after eating?”

“That’s a myth,” she giggled. “Besides, I’m sure someone would save you if you were drowning.”

We swam for a while as people jumped off the diving board, guys roughhoused, and girls lounged and chatted. I met a bunch of Sophia’s friends, who seemed nice. As the sun got lower, people migrated to the jacuzzi or the bar, but Sophia and I sat on the edge of the deep end.

“So why’d you join the cross country team?” she asked, the pool light giving her a flattering glow.

“I don’t know,” I said. “Didn’t want to get hurt while still playing a sport. Seemed like a good way to meet people.”

“You could trip and fall and break your head open,” she said.

“I don’t think I’m that uncoordinated. I manage to walk around without falling over most days.”

She giggled and kicked her feet in the water. “I’m glad you joined the team.”

“Thanks,” I said. “Thanks for making me feel welcome.”

She smiled. Her eyes sparkled in the dimming light.

“Hey, um,” I said, “Can I ask you a question?”          

Her eyes got big. “Yeah, sure!”

“Like, a weird question.”        

“Yeah…”

“I mean, it’s really weird.”      

“Well you’re being really weird right now,” she teased.

“Ok whatever.” I leaned in toward her. She leaned in towards me. Her skin looked so smooth.

“Have you ever seen anything strange in the trees around here?”

Her face got puzzled. “What do you mean?”

“Like strange stuff while driving around almond groves?”

“No…what do you mean?”

I explained to her what Jackson and I had been seeing and how it kept changing. She had never seen anything like it.

“Yeah, Jackson and I can’t figure out what it is.”

“Does that scare you?” she said.

“I don’t know. It’s just kinda normal now.”

“You said you were seeing different things?”

“Jackson said it was a Hispanic guy, but it looks like a white guy to me. Bulky figure, wearing black. Kind of hard to see with shadows.”

“You sure you aren’t seeing two different things?”

“I guess we just assumed it was the same.”

She looked hesitant. “Well, I mean, it kind of sounds like you were describing Jackson.”

“Really?”

“Yeah, dark clothes, bulky. You sure you’re ok?” She put her hand on my forearm. Our eyes met. I leaned toward her. She smelled like the pool and sunshine.

Tires screeched into the driveway, and someone laid on the horn over loud music. Sophia whipped her head around at the noise. Then the yelling started.

“Hey Anthony! Hey! Let’s go! I gotta-!” I didn’t catch the rest of Jackson’s yelling over the rev of the engine. All the eyes at the party shot toward me. I scrambled up from the edge of the pool, embarrassed and quickly turned to Sophia.

“I’ll, uh, see you at practice next week.”

She looked beautiful and uncertain as I turned my back on her, grabbed my stuff, and toweled off as I jogged around the house.

“Anthony, come one!” he honked again.

“Dude, what the hell?”

“Dude let’s go for a drive then watch some fireworks.”

“Ok, um…”

“Come on, man, we gotta go!” He seemed so convinced. His eyes looked weird, and he was bouncing his leg. I got in the car, fastened my seat belt, and he peeled out of the driveway.

“Where are we going, Jackson?”

We pulled onto a minor highway at a speed I wasn’t comfortable with.

“Just around, dude. I just want to drive.”

His pace picked up even faster. I gripped the console and the handle above the door as we barreled past side roads. Most were empty.

“Hey can you slow down?” I said.

“How’d it go with Sophia?”

I was caught off guard. “It was…good. She likes me, I think.”

“Huh.” I barely heard the grunt over the metal music.

I turned it down. “I was thinking about asking her out before you showed up.”        

“Yeah, dude, she’s hot.” He didn’t look at me.

Fields whisked by. “Where are we going?”

He turned onto a side road that narrowed between two groves of almond trees. “I just wanted to go for a drive with you.”

“Ok, but where are we going?”

He laughed. “I don’t know!”

“Shouldn’t we figure that out? I don’t want to get lost.”

“I’m sure we’ll find our way back.”

He wasn’t making any sense. “Why are we driving?”

“Just to drive.”

“But why? Is something going on?” I left off “with you.”

“No, man. I just wanna drive.”

I gave an exasperated sigh as I turned to the window. The sun was an orange ball just touching the horizon. It pierced through the trees and shown perfectly down the rows, casting long shadows in the trees.

The silhouette was gone.

I turned back to Jackson just in time to see a pickup truck run the stop sign at the intersection about a hundred feet in front of us.

We must have hit the truck twenty miles over the speed limit. I became weightless as the car flipped over its nose and over the truck. My head slammed into the support column as we rolled, and my neck whipped against the headrest. Glass sprayed across the cabin, cutting my cheeks and arms. My feet came unglued from the floor on the second roll. My ankle bent the wrong way as it caught on the bottom of the glove box. I heard a crunch as the dashboard buried the other leg. My vision swam as the car slammed into a tree and almost folded in half, whipping me against the dash now crushing my midsection. As my vision reoriented, the car came to a stop on its side, my door now pinned on the ground.

From where we had landed, I could see directly down the row of almond trees as the sun’s last light sank below the horizon.

Something dripped on my cheek. I looked up to Jackson’s still face, mouth and eyes wide open. Blood was dripping from his mangled arm onto me, a slow pat, pat, pat.

Pain overwhelmed me as the sun’s glow faded from the sky. I melted away into darkness.

Jackson had been killed on impact. His neck snapped as the car flipped over its nose. I woke up a week later with 2 broken legs, a torn meniscus, cracked ribs, a broken arm, whiplash, and a major concussion. Safe to say I’m going to miss the cross-country season.

The guy in the truck died after he was thrown from the vehicle into a nearby tree. He was a farmhand here on a work visa from Mexico.

It’s been two months since the accident. I’ve spent most of that time laying in a dark room hoping one of these days my head stops hurting. Sorry if this account seems a little disjointed. Sometimes I only have enough focus to write a few words at a time.

I haven’t seen or spoken to Sophia since the 4th of July. The colors of that night bleed together every time I try to think about it. Jackson’s hollow eyes are etched into my mind. I just keep wondering what I should have done.

On a drive to the hospital for a checkup, I noticed they’ve started planting an extra row of trees along the road in the groves. It maximizes land usage, I think, but it also breaks up that picture effect of passing tree rows. Hopefully it keeps anyone else from seeing a silhouette in the trees. Or at least they don’t have to see it coming.
