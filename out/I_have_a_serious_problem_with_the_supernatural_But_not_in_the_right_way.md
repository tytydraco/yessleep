Since I was 11 years old, the supernatural has been chasing me, like an obsession, a skinnwalker, it chased me for years, at first it was my friend, but then it got weirder (I dated my skinnwalker friend), at first I didn't know, but he was very possessive, he was even jealous of my cat, and during the night I would wake up and go outside to pee, (after all, I live in the countryside, in the backlands, and the bathroom is outside the house), and my My body had a biological clock that made me wake up at three o'clock in the morning, and while I went to the bathroom, I felt a shiver down my spine, a cold that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, but I didn't feel like it was supposed to hurt me, after pissing I went back home, but passing by the mango and jackfruit trees, that feeling of being watched very closely increased, and I felt the cold early morning wind kiss my face, making my entire body shiver, and in the darkness I could see two small shiny balls in the middle of the darkness, they looked like marbles, but I managed to realize that they were... Eyes, that's right, very bright eyes, and green, and not just any green, but such a deep green, they looked like emeralds, but bright with the sun, I got scared and took a step back, and when I tried to run I tripped over my own feetðŸ˜…ðŸ« .


And that thing hugged me from behind, and covered my eyes with a single hand, I was more scared, but something made me freeze, I smelled a sweet fragrance, but not sickly, it was woody... It was the smell of my boyfriend's cologne, Henry... I was so shocked. My body instantly relaxed, it was subconsciously, but I felt the touch on my waist and the touch of his fingers covering my eyes, it was as cold and cold as a corpse, my body became rigid and by instinct I tried to run away again, but he squeezed my waist with more pressure, it became a little painful, then I felt a strong bite on my neck, and then a small amount of blood came out, it was as if he was a bat feeding (if you don't understand, research how bats feed on human blood). I bewilderedly call out to him hesitantly: "Hen- Henry, why are you doing this?" I questioned weakly and shakily, and he just replied in a sickly voice, "I'm just claiming what's mine. You've been mine since the moment I saw you, when you were just 3 years old, you looked adorable in that little pink dress with cute embroidery." I was shocked, the dress he described I only wore once, on my third birthday, 8 years ago, and before I said anything I fainted.

The other day I woke up in my bed, I woke up with a start, I looked around my entire room, and I sighed with relief, thinking that maybe it was just a dream, but after thinking that, I felt a pain in my neck, I reached my hand to my neck and there was the mark of his bite, and soon I understood that it wasn't a dream, I went to my mother's room and in front of the mirror I took off my pajamas, on my neck there was a bite mark, there was blood from the bite, but it was clotted, and on my waist there was a handprint, from Henry's hand, and it was perfectly marked because my skin is very white, even though I live in the countryside and walk in the sun, and something caught my attention, I had a black mark on my left thigh, which if you looked closely you could tell it was a skull.
