Hello. This is my final option to write to this place. I was born in 1999 and lived a quiet life somewhere in Cotswolds. It was all fun throughout my childhood. I was happy with it. Though my parents died when I was a baby in a car accident, my paternal grandparents took great care of me. It is all normal until here, I was a normal kid going to a normal elementary school when I realized the things around my house were different.

Have you seen the daisies around the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant? The way their cores? I had them in different species throughout my garden and I loved them. It was all I knew growing up until I went to elementary school. It seemed somehow weird to see 'normal' ones with basic circular cores in those flowers. I thought maybe it's just another type of flower at the end of the day. I didn't mind it and kept living my days.

In middle school however, I realized that my grandparents had occasional burns around their arms and legs. They would tell me that this happened because of the stove, the oven, the fireplace, the barbecue pit etc. I believed in them. Naive me thought like, would they lie?

I wasn't allowed to have any friends to my home since my grandparents were old and weren't into loud noises we did as young kids. I didn't also think anything of it until one day, they left to visit London. I called a friend of mine to my home back in 2012. He came around and we spent time in the woods behind my home looking for bugs and sticks as typical kids so we could show what we found to the other kids. That was the first time I saw it. It looked just like my grandfather.

It was taller and slimmer than him and had this weird look on his face. He was almost 20 meters away. I looked at him and he looked at me. I immediately knew he wasn't my grandfather because I didn't hear his old truck coming to the driveway. I felt uneasy so I asked my friend to go inside. I didn't want to scare him since he had a heart condition which prohibited him from sudden movements. We went inside and I locked the doors. I called my grandparents two times which both went straight to the voicemail. 

When we tried to light the fireplace, my friend told me that it is already warm inside and maybe we can just watch some cartoons we like on TV. I agreed and went to turn on the TV only to find out that it was all glitching. It was unusual because we had a great TV with renewed cables. I didn't think much of it so instead I decided to ask him if he was hungry. He said yes.

That's when I saw it as well. It was right out of my kitchen window. I gasped and fell on the ground. That figure walked away from the kitchen towards the front door. I grabbed a knife and went inside the living room where my friend was. He wasn't there. I called out his name and I checked around. Nobody knocked the front door, nothing was unusual.

I felt extra uneasy. I thought maybe my friend was playing a game with me but no, he was nowhere in the house and I was so afraid to go outside. I decided to call him but his phone wasn't on and it sent me straight to the voicemail.

I called the cops but they thought I was kidding and didn't really care. I was empty handed. I tried to call my friend's family but nobody was home either. I felt more afraid than ever. It was like I don't know, I was just in pure horror. I decided to call my grandparents one more time and they answered. It was my grandfather. I told him that there was someone that looked just like him outside also that I can't find my friend nowhere.

He quickly responded with a concerned tone. He asked if that friend came to our house and I said yeah. He hung up. I called him again but he didn't respond. After 10 minutes he called me and told me not to get out of the house and that they were coming back from London. I asked for an explanation as to my friend's whereabouts but he said that I shouldn't have brought him to our house. I was confused this time. I peeked out of my window a few times only to see nothing. Nothing was there, nobody was there. Garden seemed usual, woods had nothing in them except for a few deers. It was just the same. Only missing thing was my friend.

I don't remember how but at some point through the night, I fell asleep. When I woke up, it was morning but nobody was home. I was called by my friend's family. I checked the voicemails only to hear this one particular voicemail from his mom. It was something like 'I am coming there to get him, I can't reach him. Hope this come over thing didn't include staying up all night and sleeping all day. If so, he will be in trouble because we talked about his sleep schedule.'

Well, she never showed up. Actually, nobody from his family showed up. I waited for even one person's arrival. It was only my grandparents that came after what felt like a lifetime. They seemed worried and completely out of color in the face. They asked me if I was alright. I was. I was worried about my friend and that weird figure I saw.

My grandfather told me not to mention this to anyone and asked if I called the cops or anyone else. I said I called the cops but they didn't care. Also mentioned of my friend's mom and the voicemail. That's when they looked at me dead in the eye. I was just so scared that I kept asking what's wrong. My grandfather asked me if the mother actually came here to which I replied no.

He slapped me. For the first time in 13 years, he slapped me. He told me that I am stupid and I caused the deaths of my friend and his mom by inviting him to the house. He told me that I was the reason why things became this way. My grandmother didn't say anything. She was basically looking outside for something I couldn't really recall.

My grandfather walked around the house for a few times. He checked the windows and the door. He did nothing but paced around anxiously. At one point I lost it and asked him what is wrong.

He held me from my shoulders and shook me. He told me that I am so stupid. He said that this house is based on some radioactive test zone that was used way before I was born. He asked me if I was stupid enough to not understand it by the way that daisies looked like or the burns around their arms and legs. He told me that only one generation per pair makes it to full adulthood in this house. That was why my mother and father died. He told me that the figure we saw was his grandfather that had be contaminated by the radiation when the test zone was first established. He told me that his grandfather, the figure, wasn't really happy with outcomers thinking that they came to build the test zone like they did years ago. That was why we had no guests when I was a kid. That was why I wasn't allowed to have anyone coming over.

I asked him why we didn't move out of this house years ago. He told me that we own this property and if we would move out, we would be held accountable for all the deaths and the tests that were done. His grandfather would also be on rage to kill them if they were to leave this house. I asked why he didn't tell me about this. He replied that I was a kid and he thought I would've told the other kids. At one point an adult would hear the story and start to put the pieces together. I was lucky because my friends' mother was a single mom with no one to look for her really. It wouldn't be a really big problem for my grandparents. I got mad and asked him where was his grandfather or whatever that thing actually was.

Eventually he kicked me out of the house. I had nowhere to go and I still have nowhere to go. I tried not to stay around the property. I panhandled. I tried to build myself a life. I tried to get help. I was beaten and bullied until I started to learn how to stand up for myself. I started to work and lived on the streets for a little more. In 2021, I was able to live on my own when I got the news of my grandparents' passing due to a fire that started in the fireplace. I felt sorry but I didn't want to go back to that property. It felt like all of these things were over. I inherited the house as well as their savings. I didn't want to deal with the house and all the trouble so I put it up for sale.

Today I got a message from my grandfather's phone number. It told me to come visit the house and that I won't regret it. I was so sure the number was unusable. I am really freaking out. Where do I go?
