Things have gotten worse since the last time I spoke.

As I said, I couldn’t help myself. I needed to know. I went back to the place that started it all, and I regret that I ever put my hands on the wheel after discovering what I found.

My grandpa’s old neighborhood hadn’t aged a day since I’d seen it last. The houses, lawns, and even the cars seemed unchanged. Families were outside playing. Men at work trimmed their hedges. Dogs prowled cut grass for intruders. It was almost disturbingly picturesque, knowing what had transpired there all those years ago. People waved at me as I drove by without an ounce of hesitation, and that, too, unnerved me. I was reasonably shaken by the events of the day, and I still believe that I have enough repressed trauma to keep a shrink in business for a decade. However, I couldn’t let myself feel any of it. If I let it all out, I’d fall apart. So I zipped up whatever courage I still had and followed the road back to his house.

The house itself was an old reproduction Victorian design. It wasn’t as old as it looked, but it wasn’t that young either. There was a green hue to the once blue paint that covered the dry wooden exterior. The front porch was dried and splintered beyond repair, and the windows and exterior walls were covered in kudzu. Long web-like vines reached up from the ground in waves of pointed leaves. It swallowed the base of the house like the unhinged maw of a snake. It was still standing after all these years, though I dared not take one step on the stairs. The house was clearly unoccupied and had been like this for some time. Given the news, it wouldn’t have surprised me to learn that it never went back on the market. Still, it was odd that no one thought to demolish it for the land. At least ten acres stretched out in a straight line from the back yard, so there had to be some value to it.

I decided to walk around the back to see if the old gate still stood. It did, and the latch was clearly broken. I gave one last look back over my shoulders to see if anyone was watching, and I almost pissed myself when I saw that across the street, maybe fifty yards away, a woman with hedge shears and a large straw hat was smiling at me and waving vigorously. At first, I thought it was sarcastic, but she seemed to be genuine. I gave a half-hearted wave back, and without a word more, she went back to cutting her hedges. She was rigid with age and moved slowly from branch to branch. I decided she had to be senile or simply mistook me for someone else and continued into the yard.

They’d refilled the holes where the bodies once were, but the actual soil was still barren. The acid and salt Papa Jo had buried with his victims had ruined any remaining nutrients, scarring the earth with four grey rectangles. In one of them, I saw a weed, long dead, sprouting from the earth. It was grey and withered, but its shape was still peculiar.

It was wide, not tall like most weeds, and outward from its base were several barbed vines. Each thorn on the vine was at least an inch long and pale as bone. The tendrils stopped at the edge of the barren patch, but as I inspected it closer, there was something more concerning about its alien look.

Coiled periodically and tangled through the thorns were bones. Mice bones. Snake bones. The husks of large bugs. All were impaled on the thorns, though all were long dry. I struggled to wrap my head around the whole thing, and wondered whether the animals had simply died from being tangled in its brush or if they were victims of something else.

As I looked up from the sight, I locked eyes with my grandfather’s shed. It was still standing after all these years, and his sliding barn door stood agape, waiting for me. The bright red paint on its exterior that I used to love as a child was now rust colored, like dry blood. I could see little inside of it, save a few things on the counter and a defunct lawnmower. Still, I poked my head in for any other strange sights. I had hoped nothing could top the plant I’d seen, but as you’ve probably guessed, that’s not what happened.

There truly was nothing in the shed of note, as I expected there wouldn’t be. Almost all of Papa Joe’s tools had been taken as evidence during the investigation, but some small things did remain. There was a broken ruler, a rusted shovel that’d been left behind for whatever reason, and then, oddest of all, was a huge bag of rock salt. It was the kind they used to keep roads from freezing over, but where we lived, it rarely snowed. It sat, half empty, in a folded heap against the corner.

I took out Papa Joe’s letter again and looked it over for the hundredth time. He wouldn’t stop mentioning salt, and whatever book he wanted me to find was apparently buried somewhere in a graveyard in the woods. I wanted to punch myself for being stupid enough to go through with this real-life horror movie, but I couldn’t shake the itch.

Truth was a book in a graveyard, and I needed to find it.

I took the shovel, walked to the back gate of the yard, and began my trek down the path my grandfather once took me on ten years ago.

The path itself was a dry dirt road that wound off into the dead trees for at least two miles. There was no good way to see all the way down it, and the bends felt more and more similar the farther in I wandered. It was still light out, but the sky was an oppressive leaden grey. The cold air was so heavy, it formed into trampling mist about a mile in. It kept getting thicker and thicker. At one point, I thought I’d started walking in the opposite direction, but I was proven wrong when I stubbed my toe on something hard.

I’d kicked a small headstone, with a name and description that were weathered beyond recognition. I turned on my cell’s flashlight and shone a beam on the ground in front of me. A few feet away, there was another stone, this one newer than the last. Its name and date went back to the early 1920s, and its date was short. I found two more headstones and knew I had found the family plot. I set about to the business at hand, as the mist grew thicker around me.

I combed over stone after stone, looking for the broken cross Joe had told me about. Eventually, my light fell on it, and I saw the one I was looking for. There was a stone in the shape of a Celtic cross, but its top and left arm had crumbled away. There was damp, loose soil beneath it, so I started to dig.

As I dug, I could’ve sworn there’d been a noise somewhere in the fog, but I was too focused. I kept digging and digging until finally the rusted blade made a dull thud. Anxiously, I got to the ground and started pawing at the earth until a black plastic bag came into view. I took hold and wrenched it out as tenderly as I could manage, then ripped it open. Inside was another bag, and inside that was a hard object wrapped in layers of cling wrap. After ages of unraveling and tearing, my cold hands finally felt the hard leather of a book. I pulled out the secret my grandfather had almost taken to the grave and inspected it ravenously.

The book was simple. It was a medium-sized book with a hard cover bound in black leather. There was no inscription on the cover, but on its spine, in small, faded gold letters were the words:

“Königreich der Ecken.”

It’s safe to say, I had no fucking idea what that meant, but I opened the book anyway. What I found inside puzzled me all the more.

I flipped through its pages, and was met by letters and words I’d never seen before. Some of it was written in what I now know is German, but the rest was more symbols than letters. There were curves, marks in the shapes of tridents and spirals. It looked like something out of a video game. Even more concerning than the letters and symbols were some of the illustrations I saw within.

One was of a man in a tunic. He would’ve been normal, like one of those figures you see on old Greek pottery, but he had two extra sets of arms and three faces. One face played a strange pair of flutes, another blew a ram’s horn trumpet, and the final face sat agape as if singing, while its last pair of arms strummed a harp.  Beneath this image were the words:

“Orfes, Die verfluchte Harfe.”

Another image of a many-armed figure appeared in the flipping pages. This one was a woman, and between her many fingers, strands of thread crossed over and over again, creating a maze with its cords. Another inscription read:

“Ariadne.”

As I flipped, I saw figure after figure. A man with the head of a bull, a hooded figure with antlers protruding from his head, and many more I couldn’t even guess the shape of.  Beside each, half in German, half in the language I couldn’t identify, there were burbs of text and geometric images I’d never seen before.  I kept flipping and flipping, trying to find something that answered what my Grandfather had said.

Then I found a page that didn’t have a person. Instead, there was what looked like a barren tree, black on the outside and covered in sharp barbs. Beside it was an image of a vine that grew some strange amorphous fruit. It didn’t have any notable features and looked like a bizarre, formless watermelon, but then I followed the page down to another image. The same vines, but this time, the shape of the fruit was more symmetrical. It was larger and gaining appendages. I only spied a glimpse of the final image before a voice broke the silence of the woods.

“Frank,” a man said, “I’m so glad you’re here.”

I spun to my feet, tucking the book under my arm, and wielding the shovel like an axe. My eyes darted in fear for the source of the voice, but I soon had my answer.

In the fog stood a man in a flannel shirt and boots. He had no hair that I could see, and the fog blocked his face, but his voice was clear enough for me to recognize it.

“P-papa?”

He laughed in that same dry way he always did. When we went camping, and he’d tell jokes around the fire, he always chuckled the same way.

I was close to pissing myself.

“What- how? H-how are you- no, no, no, I saw you get killed. I saw you in the chair. You’re not my grandfather! Who the fuck are you?”

The man who sounded like my grandfather waved his hand at me and said:

“It’s me, sport.” He stopped waving, but kept his hand upright. “I took you camping out here all the time when you were young. Remember?”

I clutched the shovel tighter.

“What do you have there?” he said, pointing a pale finger at the book. “Let me see it.”

“If you were my grandfather, you’d know what it is.”

He went silent, freezing like a broken animatronic. His arms shot up.

“Come give Papa a hug, sport!” The voice was so close to his own I thought I was hallucinating, but some note about it was off. The speech was too exact. Too strained. There was almost a buzz to the end of his words.

“You’re not my Grandpa,” I told him, “and I’m not coming near you.”

“Awwww, don’t say that, sport,” He said. “Your father used to come out here all the time with papa. He was here too, all grown up just like you. That wasn’t too long ago, come to think of it.”

“What are you talking about? Quit avoiding the question! Who are you?”

A gust of wind blew through the woods, and the fog started to dissipate. As it did, I almost screamed.

The man before me had no face. There was only smooth skin gleaming in the grey daylight that was quickly fading to dusk, except across that smooth skin, there were thorns, each at least three inches long, poking out of his skull and neck. Around him, through the vanishing mist, it was clear to me that a thick black vine with pointed leaves and barbs anchored him to his place. More thorns began to sprout from its outstretched arms, and the flannel evaporated like ash.

Then, without a mouth, it spoke through its waxy, thorned flesh.

“Legione Sumus…”  then again, echoing, “eímaste legeóna… Wir sind Legion…Anachanu Legion.”

Trembling in the dying light, I saw it all clearly. I don’t want to describe it, but I need to get it out. I need you to know.

From a gravestone a few yards away, a tall black tree sprouted. Its limbs and leaves were black, and from its vines came more of the same thorns. They spread across the dying trees, strangling pine and oak alike, and caught in the thorns, impaled and unholy, were the bleeding bodies of wildlife. Deer, foxes, rabbits, squirrels- any creature I could think of was pierced by the thorns. My horrified eyes wandered further along the carnage until I came across something even more familiar.

Almost directly above me was the grey mummified corpse of a man in a faded deputy uniform. A nametag still hung from its lifeless form. It was Sheriff Locke.

I was shaking so much I thought I was going to faint. As I looked back at the thing that addressed me, it grabbed the vine from the back of its neck and wrenched it out. A sound like wet celery echoed across the small graveyard. Then, in a voice I hadn’t heard since childhood, the same voice that I heard call my papa a killer, the mouthless thing said:

“There’s a new Sheriff in town.”

I started running. I didn’t even know if I was going in the right direction, but all I could do was chase the setting sun and pray the light stayed with me until I reached my car. I didn’t know if the thing was chasing me, but it didn’t matter. As I sprinted down the path, I could see more of those vines laced through the trees, prey large and small hooked in their grasp.

I burst into the backyard, dashed to my car and locked myself inside as quickly as I could. I tossed the book in my passenger seat and fumbled with my keys. As the engine roared and the lights blinked to life, I got another look at the house my grandfather had built as his home years ago.

The vines on that house were not kudzu.

I started to reverse. I checked every angle for a sight of the creature from the woods, but instead, my taillights illuminated a figure standing at the edge of the opposite lawn. It was the smiling woman from earlier.

She was waving at me.

I took off out of the neighborhood, breaking every traffic law I could, but that didn’t spare me what I saw on the way out of the area. Every person I had noted earlier, everyone I’d waved at, was standing at the edge of their lawns, doing the same thing as the old woman. I now understand why the waving bothered me before. They were all waving with the same hand at the same time.

Dogs stood on their hind legs, breaking the natural shapes of their front paws to do the same. Birds broke their wings to wave from trees. All of the cars I’d seen earlier were gone, leaving only goliath collections of vines and some mass that looked like flesh.

They were taunting me, and I didn’t even understand why. I left them smiling and waving and drove out of the state as quickly as I could. I stopped for gas seldom, and never when there were trees around. When I finally gained the courage to check my phone, I realized I had ten unread messages from Lacey and three missed calls.

I know it's shitty, but I didn’t have the will to call her back. My brain was reeling. I had a book I couldn’t read, and I felt like a lunatic trying to process everything I’d seen. I drove back through the night and made it back home in the early morning.

Lacey was up, covered in her robe, and sprang up as soon as I walked in. I had expected her to scream at me, to demand to know what I was doing or who I had been with, but instead she hugged me and told me everything was okay. I must’ve looked like hell for her to say that without context, and I couldn’t even begin to explain what I saw. My papa was right. I was being hit repeatedly by horror, guilt, remorse, grief, and incredulity.

How long had Locke been dead? Who else could they steal a voice from? Who had they already taken?

“Its fruit could be anywhere. It could be anyone.” He’d written. “We were so close to the start of it all.”

I hugged Lacey and cried, clinging to her like an anchor as she caressed my back.

“It’s okay,” she said. “Everything is okay now.”

I kissed her neck timidly and held tight to her robe.  Then, still shuddering, I saw something I’d never seen before.

At the nape of her neck, about the size of a quarter, was a divet mark. It was nearly invisible from any other angle, but it was very visible to me.

My mind went back to the thing in the woods. The noise of wet celery. The writings of my grandfather. The people in the neighborhood.

“No matter what you see, do not touch it….” He’d warned me. “The things they do to your mind are nothing short of unholy….”

So now I’m home, sitting in my basement typing this out. Lacey invited me to bed. She almost dragged me upstairs, but I insisted I needed some time alone. I thought any of this would finally break her and get her to snap, but instead, she simply let me go. She watched me quietly the entire time.

I’ve been in here for hours now. I snuck back out to my car to get the book, but apart from that, I haven’t left. I’ve drawn the curtains, and I’ve been typing this between spastic internet searches on whatever the hell this book is. So far, I’ve got nothing outside of a handful of archaic German words, but I’ve finally gotten to take a closer look at that page from the woods.

The fruit finishes its transformation in the drawings and takes the shape of a man.

The inscription beneath it reads, “Der Würger.”

If anyone can give any tips on just what in hell they think I should do, please tell me. I feel like I’m starting to lose my mind.

Papa Joe was right. There is something in the woods that my family planted, and it’s coming for me.

I’ll update when able. I don’t think I’m gonna sleep for a while.
