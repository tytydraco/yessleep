I walked up the steps in a red haze. My hands were still trembling with a dull anger and they still flexed and twitched involuntarily. Each footfall brought a contradictory surge of emotion. Fury and despair. Fury at my parents for their silence about this hidden nightmare in our home, then crushing despair that perhaps they'd tried to warn me in their own inadequate way and I would never see them again.

I wanted to scream at Sherrie for letting me believe she could escape, then in the same breath, I wanted to apologize for not understanding her prison sooner. I was furious at myself for returning there, yet I couldn't imagine having done anything else.

Worst of all I was mad at the stillness. The only sound echoing through the towering steps remained my own footsteps. There was nothing to vent at, no grabbers to tear apart, no other creatures to test myself against. The whole place seemed at peace and that peace tore at my brain and raked at my sanity. The simmering anger was abnormal, I knew that. Likely born of the same curse that Sherrie had warned me about. If I wanted to think clearly again I would have to continue my ascent to the hall of whispers and find a way to purge this madness before something really bad happened.

Time warped around me and what felt like hours might have been mere minutes. I remember biting my tongue to placate the growing frenzy that pressed in on my mind. To my relief, the monotony of the stairwell finally broke and the scenery changed. I began to notice small recessed panels embedded in the wall. They seemed to glow with strange baubles: jagged crystals and seashells, each pulsing with their own inner light.

The destructive urges were quelled for a moment as I started at an odd little seashell that seemed to slowly change colors every few moments. It was a simple thing, but the shifting tones had hypnotized me into a placid state and I found myself unable to pull my eyes away.

After a long moment I thought I heard something. It sounded like it was coming from the shell. It was a voice, soft , tremulous, not so much a sound as a vibration on my inner ear. Not speech, exactly, but a series of wavering pulses. The shell hummed against my fingertips, sending a memory-tinged chill through my arm. I stared deep into its spiral mouth, and the colors within seemed to rearrange themselves into words.

“...it’s not the anger, it’s the hunger...”

The resonance ricocheted through my skull, words crawling up from an undertow. I tried to let go of the shell but my hand was locked, paralyzed by some dormant reflex. The second voice was clearer, threading through the gulf between my ears: “Let them pass. Don’t eat what they’ve left behind. Don’t eat yourself, or you’ll never leave.”

I wrenched my hand away from the shell, feeling phantom teeth sink into my palm even as I dropped it. The hallucination subsided, but not before the stairs warped, each tread now alive with the echo of a million footfalls before mine, a tangible pressure of all those who’d ascended, and never come down again.

For an interval, maybe ten minutes, maybe the length of a heartbeat, I climbed as if in fugue. The steps lost all solid texture, the world resolving itself only as I set my foot down. My mind ran a looping monologue of nothing in particular, just fragments of childhood, flashes of my mother's anxious voice, the flavor of copper in my mouth that grew sharper every moment.

Each sluggish step shifting the odd dreamlike haze around me. Each step causing the ever present whispering to grow louder and louder. I passed more of the shells, some broken and leaking faint blue mucus, some intact and glittering in pale flashes. The concrete of the walls gave way to some older, rough-hewn stone, almost like the core of a mountain, shot through with veins of rust.

The air here was thick, viscous with humidity, and the old chemical odor had matured into the stench of rotten kelp and the ozone of an electrical fire. My hands stuck to the banister, tacky with something half-dried, perhaps grabber blood, perhaps my own.

I counted steps for a while to keep myself oriented. At the 200th, a trick of perspective made the whole world open up, the wall simply vanished, replaced by a silo-like well that dropped in a straight plunge hundreds of feet into absolute blackness. The staircase was now a spiral of exposed metal grating, cold and flexing beneath my bare feet, and the walls were slicked with condensation, alive with movement.

I caught a blur of motion rising up from somewhere high above. The anger in me roared back, something in that darting movement pulling taut every muscle in my body. I smashed upward, taking the steps two and three at a time, bellowing in a hoarse whisper for Sherrie. It wasn’t her. It couldn’t be.

Blinding light flared overhead, brighter than any illumination I'd seen in the stairwell yet. It was a presence, or maybe a person, or echo of a person radiating golden phosphorescence. The figure drifted a few steps above me, not walking but hovering, her face changing like a kaleidoscope, cycling through the faces of every person I'd ever known, loved, or hated. Sometimes it was Sherrie, or what I remembered of her. In the ever-morphing edges I caught a glimpse of my mother, then my ex-wife, then something that looked like me but much, much older and hollow-eyed with centuries of regret.

The sight snapped the rage in me like a gunshot. Everything constricted, pulled taut, and then collapsed inward, all the anger and hate and bloodlust folding into a single pinpoint in my chest, and I felt myself breathe for the first time since I'd come back.

A shrill, childlike voice shivered in my skull, tinny as bone conduction and yet unmistakably Sherrie. "Ignore it. Keep coming up. Don't look at the faces. Don't talk to them, they're not me. I'm almost at the top, I can feel it, I can…"

Her voice flickered, overtaken by a hiss like boiling tar. Then, softer: "I found the opening, a shining pinnacle. But there's something up here with me...."

The luminous imitation above me lurched, splitting into multiple afterimages that pooled around the staircase walls. New faces budded and warped along the spiral,staring at me with compound, unblinking eyes. Each face tried on a new permutation of grief, anger, lust, until they found one that pricked at me, a memory I’d almost allowed myself to forget. My father, huge and trembling with rage, the night he’d found my mother hunched in the dark at the foot of the stairs, weeping over nothing. I watched the vision snap her jaw open, and an aquarium of tiny, screaming mouths spilled from the wound, reverberating my own voice back at me in a chorus of accusation.

I wanted to run, but the steps beneath me had turned soft, viscous as a tendon or raw fat, and my feet sank into it with each stride. The faces kept erupting from the walls, bulging at me, all teeth and eyes. I pressed on by sheer force of will, knees and elbows scraping through the congealing stairwell.

"Hurry," said Sherrie's voice, but now it was in my ear, not the inside of my brain. Something about the timbre was wrong, too loud, too desperate.

"Hurry, it's closing, it's closing behind me!" The call ended in a wet gurgle, then silence.

I tried to ignore the horrible implications of her plea. The first voice had warned me not to listen, that the others were not her. But it sounded like her and she sounded like she was in trouble.

I pressed on and the steps leveled off into an impossible corridor, its floor translucent as the rim of an oyster shell. There was no banister, no boundary, just a walkway several feet across, the walls arching away into infinite mirrored tightropes. In the distance, how far, I couldn’t judge, I saw a silhouette limping towards the far end, a faint mist of blood trailing behind her. With each pace, she left prints that glowed a dull, arterial red in the pale ambient blue radiating from the corridor itself.

I broke into a sprint, or tried. The floor bent and bucked beneath me, undulating to some heartbeat not my own. For every five steps, I gained three and lost two. Suddenly the whole tower shifted and I felt myself tumbling end over end. I was launched out of the strange corridor and back into the stairwell.

To my amazement, I was not plummeting back down the stairwell. Instead, my body lurched upward, my stomach dropping into my throat as my hair and clothing pressed against my skin from below. The translucent floor receded beneath me like I was being yanked by invisible wires, the mirrored walls blurring into streaks of cold blue light. It was as though the stairs had suddenly decided that "down" was now "up," leaving me helplessly tumbling through a vertigo inducing inversion of reality.

My body tumbled through space until my fingers caught the jagged edge of a step , arresting my momentum with a jolt that nearly dislocated my shoulder. For what felt like an eternity, gravity remained in flux, my blood rushing to my head, then my feet, then sideways as the stairs continued the nauseating reorientation. When it finally settled, I dangled from the staircase's underside near the central spiral, my knuckles white with strain, legs swinging over an abyss so deep that darkness swallowed whatever bottom might exist.

Somehow, I managed to haul myself back up, muscles trembling. The surge of furious strength had abandoned me and I felt weak. I wanted to collapse. I wanted to scream. Looking in both endless directions of the stairwell, I felt my resolve fracture. One moment I was certain I should press on toward where I'd seen her silhouette, the next I was convinced it was another deception, another trap. My mind warred between the desperate need to find Sherie and the crushing certainty that I was merely prolonging my own suffering. Perhaps both were true.

Then I saw it, a faint glimmer suspended in the darkness above. A corona of amber light pulsed against the gloom, and my mind seized on the reference to a shining pinnacle. My legs found their strength before my courage did. I hauled myself upward, each step a prayer that this beacon marked salvation rather than another of the Stairwell’s cruel tricks. Either way it was better than waiting there.
