Hi all,

Today was horrendous. I haven’t shaken off the nightmare, it feels as though something’s crawling in my brain. It’s not a physical feeling; more a long, thin shudder crawling in my imagination. I feel unwell. But rent is due in a week. 

The Leisure centre was busier than usual last night with fifty-somethings in lycra and sweatpants. Once I’d fought my way through this horror show to reception, I found the concierge absent from her desk. 

With a deep breath I made my way along the corridor to the soft play centre. Passing the office, I was surprised to see Craig hunched over his laptop and a dry sandwich. He is never usually on-site beyond 3 pm.  

I tried to walk by, but it was too late. I’d made eye contact. I sensed he wanted to be left in peace, but he smiled. “Callie! How ye’ doing?”

“Oh, fine, thanks, Craig. How come you’re here so late? N-not working too hard, I hope?”

He laughed. “Nah, just problem-solving.”

“Sorry about Friday.”

“Hey, no worries! You feeling better?”

“A l-lot better, yeah.”

He narrowed his eyes. “Could have fooled me.”

“Really?” I demurred. “Nah, I promise. I’m alright. I’m sorry to leave you short. I bet it was a pain in the bum trying to find cover.”

He shook his head. “No trouble…if you’re ever feeling under the weather, I’d much rather you told me before it gets bad.”

His kind warning took me off guard. “I promise I won’t need any more sick days.”

“I don’t mean that,” he said, “you’re fine, Callie. I’d much rather you told me if something was wrong, that’s all…I can’t lose any more good staff.”

I was flattered, but his meaning wasn’t lost on me. “Has someone left?”

He heaved a heavy sigh. “It doesn’t look like Nadia’s coming back.”

“Like...ever?!”

Craig nodded. I was sad to hear it, though somehow, I wasn’t surprised. “I-is she ok?”

“I think she’s got a lot of stuff going on at home…it’s for the best. Bless ‘er. Wexham Park rang this morning–”

“She’s in hospital?!” I swallowed. I pictured the cheery, smiling Nadia curled up on a hospital bed, with the smell of iodine and nurse alarms beeping incessantly around her. 

“That’s between us. I know I don’t need to say that.”

I nodded hard. “But the point stands,” he continued, “if these hours ever get too much for you…if this place ever gets under your skin…you’ve got to tell me. Ok?”

“Of course.” It was under my skin already, yet I couldn’t burden Craig after he’d been so nice. 

I grabbed my cleaning caddy and skulked off to start work. As the staff had left, the play centre was eerily quiet as ever, and the floors were littered with popcorn following a movie party. I shoved my earphones in and swept the sticky denizens into a dustpan. The smell was on me like a hawk and only worsened as I tried to ignore it. I’d sprayed a cleaning cloth with Lavender room spray earlier that day. I produced it from my pocket and pressed it against my nose, like a plague doctor, terrified of bad airs. Barely an hour passed when it got too much, and I was forced upstairs. 

The tunnel ran through the jungle gym like the marshy veins that flowed through my hands. I knelt. My knees sunk into pillows, giving themselves to be held. I pressed my nose against the crash mat. I smelled as sickly sweet as the vomit I scratched from my throat when I was 17; the taste of a child’s birthday cake mingled with acidic bile. I shut my eyes. 

That was when I felt it. Beneath the vinyl carpet, something was stirring. The floor rose, just barely, like an infant’s chest rising and falling in sleep. What was…remembering myself, I pulled my head up from the floor. I pulled, and pulled harder. It was no good. My head was stuck to the floor. 

The insipid peace melted away and terror succeeded. I cried out, twisting my neck around and hunching my shoulders in a desperate attempt to free myself from the floor. I scratched, I clawed, I wrenched; a sinewy vine of pink foam stretched from the spot where I laid my head to my cheek. I reached for the sagging centre and clenched my fists around the mallow-y tendril, trying to tear it in two. It was warm to the touch and moist. In my hunted grip, I swear I felt its pulse radiating through my arms, beating in time with my heart. 

“Get off me!”

I pulled, but the fleshy rope wouldn’t break. It only stretched as I pulled it thinner and thinner, like a taffy strip. When it was like strands of spaghetti, I scrambled to my feet. Turning to the padded walls, I scraped my palms against the climbing ropes. The squashy capillaries stuck fast to the rope but cloyed my hands. It would not relinquish me. 

“Get off!” I burst into a scrambling, stumbling run down the foam-padded corridors. I was too big for them now; the nimble child I once was now lay underneath the interlocking foam mats, pressed between layers of the memories of sleeping children. At 25, I was an adult in a birth canal, “cuckold, disinherited,” scrambling towards the slide and the gaping ball pit that was my only exit. 

I reached the top of the slide just as the floor beneath my feet turned warm with life. The smell of birthday cake flooded my senses, paired with children’s laughter. I hurled myself down the scarlet plastic slide, whirling towards destruction. The ball pit opened up, ready to swallow me whole. I screamed as a million multicolored balls swelled around me. I was an infection, a parasite, worthy only of a swift immune response. It’s all that I have ever been. Taking one last gasp of air, I turned my nose and mouth into the pit and hauled myself towards the exit. 

My eyes were wide with terror as I stared at what seemed like miles of ball pit beneath me. Popped party balloons, snacks wet with spittle, and used nappies populated its depths. Overpowered by the stench, I pursed my lips and held that final breath, even as it festered in my lungs because I could not smell whatever was down there. I strained to hold my breath, letting air out in tiny increments through my mouth to relieve the burning pressure in my chest. Something rumbled beneath my middle as I floated blindly through the plastic ocean. I floundered, in vain, to move myself closer to the exit that I had not had to use for nearly twenty years. Was it still there? Or had it moved? Even if the exit was the same as in 2007, would I fit through that tiny circle of light meant only for children? Besides, I could never fit all my arms and legs through the hole. I wriggled on my back, flailing my many limbs. Helpless, frightened tears poured down my face as I imagined the poor staff having to find me: my mandibles opening and closing as a supersonic screech poured out of me, my abdomen furred over with silver hairs like an old strawberry.

They shouldn’t have to see me. No-one should. I don’t want to bother anyone. 

I was an adult now. How was I still incapable of coordinating my monstrous body? Why did my legs and arms get by as dangling deadweights for so long? I have never hated myself so much as I did at the moment. Bitch! My voice was high and low all at once, composed of frequencies that most could not hear. Stupid fucking bitch! I hate you, I hate you, I FUCKING HATE YOU!

Fuelled by self-loathing, I pulled with all my might. A supersonic screech of effort burst from my mouth as I raised my armored head towards the gap. My front arms went first–then another pair, my second, third–then, my front legs, back legs, and all of my bloated, shivering, hairy abdomen until at last, like a fever,  I burst from the ball bit, trampling broken fragments of shell, spurred on by the sugary grease that coated the floor. Putrescine. Cadaverine. Sweet decay, my rotten home. 

The feeling of the cold, sticky floor beneath my cheek brought me to myself. I felt as though I were on fire with terror as I staggered to my feet and ran down the stairs to the cafe area and the blessed exit beyond. I knocked over my cleaning caddy, spilling acrid fluids on the floor as my trainers scraped the ground and my laces caught beneath. I hit the ground hard but staggered up as my heart pounded and my head reverberated with pain. I barely stopped to get my car keys and dashed my hip against the tables as I swerved to lift my bag and threw myself towards the corridor. Tears of fright blurred my vision as I jabbed the key code in beneath the gaudy bubble writing on the door: 

“Good Job! You found the Tunnelwig.”

I was out of the door like a bat out of hell. The rickety lockers creaked as my footsteps sent earthquakes through the floor. “Callie?” I heard Craig’s voice, warm and anxious, behind me, but I did not stop. I did not even look behind me until I got to my car. I floored it home as phantom beetles scuttled over my throat and down the back of my neck. 

How cold and dark my bedroom was. I slept with the light on, but this domicile comfort did nothing for the smell. It was everywhere. It clung to my duvet and pillows and bled into the futile perfumes I sprayed all through the night to keep it at bay. I did not sleep, but pressed my nose into my Grandma’s old jersey. I kept my phone open to see the picture of Mum on my home screen. My beautiful mother; the only one who ever loved me. 

But that’s not true, is it? There is another that would love me profoundly if only I let it. My 6 am alarm went off, and I was so sick of the smell that I felt no options were left. I would have to return to the place where the stench can’t follow.

Tonight’s my last shift. I go gladly and feel no fear. Craig: I don’t think I’ll be clocking in tomorrow morning. I am sorry to give such short notice. I know it’s inconvenient. To my Mum and Grandma, I love you so very much, and I am sorry. Please don’t worry about me, though. I am happy. I greet the rising mound of foam with joy. It will wrap around me with the ardor of a lover and with all the warmth of childhood. It cares not that I am what I am. It will not spit me out. I am with my brothers and sisters now, all of us pressed like layers of earth beneath the foamy floor. 

I don’t know what else to say. Knowing me, I have probably left something out. Sorry. Anyway, that’s all I’ve got time to write. It’s getting on, and I’ll be late for work.
