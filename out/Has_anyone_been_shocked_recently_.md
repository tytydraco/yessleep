Has anyone been shocked recently? I work as a new doctor in a small town outside of Cincinnati, Ohio and have been getting more and more cases of people coming into the emergency room presenting with severe burns to their hands, feet and even their faces. These burns are the always the first symptom and to my knowledge, there has not been a single survivor after being admitted with the first burn. I'll outline my experience below and hope that some one has experience with these symptoms. I have already called the CDC to investigate as well, but no one ever arrived.

Log 1 - Initial Report, 12:00 AM - 1 hour after intake.

This has only been going on about a week, starting with a young female patient that approached the emergency room with severe burns on her fingertip on her right hand. The patient stated that she was working at her computer when she felt an electric shock come from her mouse and enter into her finger, causing the burn. The patient stated that she felt fine other than some localized pain around the burn mark and some join stiffness that we attributed to the electricity entering the body and stunning the surrounding muscle tissue. We wanted to make sure that she did not damage her heart and immediately put her on a multi-diode ECG to ensure that her heart didn't get damaged and asked her to stay overnight.

Log 2 - 2:00 AM - 3 Hours since intake

I was woken up by a overnight nursing manager about an emergency that was occurring with the patient and she could no longer feel her arm. All other readings were steady, but they wanted me to come in and oversee due to being the resident on call. When I arrived they had moved the patient from her residency in the room 240 patient ward into room 11 on the emergency floor. I inspected the patient and found that she had no feeling in her arm at all and the arm appeared to have no function. Upon inspection of the burn site I observed that the fingernail of the electrocution site had fallen off and the skin had turned black. The nail bed lost its consistency and was gelatinous in nature when touched. The patient otherwise appeared normal and was still fully conscious. The patient was given a standing order for pain medication if needed and a recommendation was made to have the finger and possibly the arm removed after a meeting with a surgeon in the morning.

Log 3 - 6:00 AM - 7 Hours Since Intake

I was called back to the hospital due to rapid deterioration of the patient. Upon entering the room a horrid smell wafted from the room, immediately reminding me of medical school. It reminded me of the day that we visited the morgue and saw some cadavers in advanced decomposition. But the patient was still alive. The patient seemed in obvious emotional shock, but stated that they were still feeling no pain. Upon observation of the arm it was observed that the patient no longer had fingers, as they had melted(?) to the linens that she was laying on. The bones to the fingers were still present on the linens but the patient still could not move the remainder of her arm. The surgeon was called for immediate intervention as this was progressing too fast to wait.

Log 4 - 6:18 AM - 7:18 Since Intake

The on-call surgeon arrived on site and asked for a briefing when a nurse once again asked for assistance in emergency room 11. Upon arrival the nurse found that the patients entire arm had melted(?) to the linens, leaving only the bones and a terrible mess. The patients chest and lower abdomen showed signs of black permeating the skin. The surgeon was unable to do any surgery as the infection had moved into critical portions of the body. I took several samples of healthy tissue as well as the gelatinous tissue that was left from the infection. I had the lab run it for everything they could think of, as we were running blind at this point.

Log 5 - Approx. 7:00 AM - 8:00 Since Intake

More patients with similar symptoms arrived at the hospital. The patients presented with similar burns in different areas of their body. The patients also claimed that hey had all been in contact with an electronic device when they were burned. The CDC finally took an interest and arrived at the hospital.

Log 6 - Approx. 7:30 AM - 8:30 Since Intake

The lab nerds stated that they were unable to run the sample due to constant interference in their instruments. They stated it was akin to someone holding a magnet nearby causing the sensitive machines to give odd results. One lab tech put a sample under a microscope and observed several mini-electric shocks occurring between cells. The microscopic electric attacks were causing the cells to rip themselves apart, causing the skin to just "let go" of itself. I remember in biology they told us that electricity could not be alive, but I was beginning to wonder.

Log 7 - Approx. 8:00 AM - 9 Hours Since Intake.

The lab began getting shocked by their own equipment and all but two of the techs ended up in the hospital that they were working at. Was it somehow spreading to the equipment? After helping the techs to the emergency admission center I was called to Room 11 once again to pronounce time of death. The patient had suddenly stopped responding, staring into the distance as if all life had stopped behind her eyes. The patient continued to breathe and show signs of "life" until part of her chest caved in from the infection reaching her internal organs. Time of death 8:08 AM. 9 Hours from initial shock.

The patients admitted after the original patient have started deteriorating in a similar fashion and with no leads, we just have to make them as comfortable as we can. Some of my colleagues have been shocked by our medical equipment. Once someone shows additional signs something is wrong it has been 100% fatal.

The CDC took initial samples and left to test them, but have not returned. The last thing they told me is that it that the virus was somehow stopping the electricity in our body, causing them to melt down. I theorize that the loss of muscle control and lack of pain is due to the impulses from the brain being turned off as it spreads. The CDC just stands outside now. Watching us from their vehicles outside of the hospital.

Log 8 - Approx 12:00 PM - 12 Hours Since First Patient

I want to leave. I want to sleep. But every jolt and every touch of an electronic device is making people jump and worry. Anyone who gets shocked is immediately ostracized by the remaining staff out of fear of the unknown. I will continue to work, as is my duty, but please.

Has anyone been shocked recently? Can anyone tell me their experience with something similar?

Log 9 - 2:00 PM - XXX

I got shocked by one of the respirators when I was trying to keep someone breathing. We've had some success removing the limbs of initial shock patients if removed before symptoms occur. We've had two patients survive initial shock. My hands are stiff. I'm unsure if its from my lack of sleep or infection. At this point, I'm not sure I'd care. Some of the other doctors told us we were unable to leave now. They claim men in hazmat suits block the doors whenever someone tries.
