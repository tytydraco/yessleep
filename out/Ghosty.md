When I was a kid I was quite imaginative, I still am as I often find myself daydreaming at the desk at work. My father loved it as it gave me the want and the need to go outside and play for hours on end, leaving him in the house to stick needles in his arms and chase the dragon for hours on end. My mother, on the other hand, hated it, she hated my imagination. My mother preferred to be quiet and work on art.



That’s not to say I wasn’t creative, I had a comic book about my two cats who got into all sorts of mischief but my mom would have rather me get into cross-stitching and rubber stamping than draw two cats going on goofy adventures. I remember when my mom cross-stitched and I was made to stay inside, watching those scenes spread out from her needle for hours. She entered the pieces in the fairs nearby and often won big blue silk ribbons for them.



When she’d go to enter her hard work, my father and I would often times tag along and get a sneak peek at what the fair was going to offer that year. One competition was a fair we had never gone to before and was in a part of the state we rarely went to. It seemed a little too snooty, so rather than poke about, my dad and I went outside to enjoy the summer sun, there was a huge grassy hill that my memory plays back as being so bright, it nearly glows, lighting up my other memories.



There was a little boy there on the top of the hill, kicking about an imaginary rock, and like just about all kids, I had never met a stranger. I walked up to the boy and introduced myself, and he did the same for me, and his name was Ghosty. I thought that was an odd name and giggled, and he gave me a playful shove and told me to quit it, then asked if I wanted to play at the little playground at the bottom of the hill. The hill we stood upon was steep and I looked down and saw a little sand pit with a swing set, not much of a playground, but it might be fun.



I grabbed his hand and ran over to my dad, asking him if Ghosty and I could go play on the swings as my dad unwrapped a candy bar, took a large bite, and seemed to savour the familiar crunch between his teeth. My dad smiled and ruffled my braided blonde hair. “Aww, how cute, my little daughter has an imaginary friend.” I had never heard the term imaginary friend before, but I didn’t care as Ghosty took off running down the hill, I ran after him, tackling him and we both rolled down the hill. A mess of arms, legs and laughter. When we came to a stop, we stood up, brushed the grass from our knees and headed for the swings.



We swung for what seemed hours, talking about our favourite video games, our favourite Pokemon, and what we wanted to be when we grew up. It came to an end far too soon as my mom and dad made their way down the hill. “Time to go, kiddo,” said my dad, his hands in the Mariners Baseball windbreaker he always seemed to wear.



I got off of the swing, turning sadly to Ghosty. “Bye, Ghosty, it was fun!”



“Who’s Ghosty?” Asked my mom, moving to the swing where Ghosty sat and she stuck her hand out for him to shake but she yanked it away and shot me an angry look. “Really, Mary? How frickin’ childish do you have to be?”



My dad stood there and rocked back on his heels. “Yup, our little girl has her first imaginary friend!” There was that word again, imaginary friend. It was obvious my mother could see and interact with Ghosty, so why couldn’t my father?



“Oh? What was that Ghosty? You want to show me something over there?” Giggled my mother in a nasty tone, and she grabbed the hand of my friend. I heard him clear as day, he wanted to show my mother something behind the old tool shed. He sounded different, he sounded mean. I was a bit surprised she was going with him, she never liked my friends.



I sat back on the swing, feeling a bit jealous, why couldn’t he show me *and* her? I was his friend, wasn’t I? My father stood behind me and pushed me on the swing, pushing me higher and higher to the point I could see the cars in the parking lot. After my fourth jump off of the swing, my father angrily checked his watch. “Where is your mother?” He grumbled, stomping off towards the tool shed.



I scurried after my father. He got to the tool shed before I did, but I didn’t see any sign of Ghosty anywhere. My father let out an ear-piercing scream and turned to me. “Mary, I need you to stay here! Don’t touch anything! Daddy’s going to get help!!” My father ran past me, showing me what had made him scream that loudly, my mom’s lifeless body, a pair of rusted gardening shears plunged into her neck.



I was too young to remember the police investigation of the murder of my mother, but what I do remember is who had murdered my mother. A little boy named Matthew Anderson, only it stumped the police. Matthew Anderson had died two years earlier. What really stumped me was the fact that Matthew Anderson looked exactly like Ghosty.
