and for about twelve years I’ve been doing auditions. Yeah, as many as I can fit around my day job, or I guess my night job. I work at the box office at this theater uptown, it’s not on Broadway but you know, I walk down to Times Square on my breaks and I just breathe in the air. There’s something electric, as well all know; that’s what you hear. I think that’s mostly the ignorant tourists who are excited to be there. They don’t go every day and feel that melting sensation, knowing you’re just on the outside, on the outside looking in. People who live here know: you’re just an audience member. 

Well I want to be on the stage, so I actually got a union card. I started going to auditions multiple times a week, but I could never be seen. I could never get the chance to show them how good I really was.

Because I’ve been practicing, you know. Since a kid. I’m not talking about school theater, I’m talking about the real thing. I’m talking eight shows a week, matinees twice a week, just like the pros. I would learn the shows by rote myself from tapes and movies. I would learn all my favorite parts, and each night of the week I’d play a different one, except for Mondays off of course. I had to rest sometime, but even then I couldn’t wait for Tuesday night when I’d put the tape in again. I’d put the tape in and I’d show the whole world what I could do.

So today, I’m going to an audition. It’s uptown, right near where I work, for a new play. The ad said they want new faces, new voices, and I can give that to them. You know I can, you’ve seen. Everyone has seen. Everyone has seen the dulling of the theater culture, the taming of the rabid creative. Where are the Andrew Lloyd Webbers of the world? Where are the people taking fistfuls of coke and coughing up twenty-six of the most confusing and beautiful songs you’ve ever heard, along with the most attractive and beautiful people you’ve ever seen. I’ll tell you where they are, they’re among us, practically hiding away at this point from the stones constantly thrown their way, whenever they try at all to stand and show themselves. We live away in holes, waiting for our moment, for our chance, waiting anxious and frustratedly for the call. Sometimes I scratch at my neck so hard that I bleed. Sometimes I bleed so long that I cry. And sometimes I cry so much that I can feel the warmth of my tears cradle my head, drip down to my feet, and pool on the floor of my apartment. I splash around in my own sadness nightly.

But today is different. Today I’m going to be seen, no matter what it takes.

I sit in a blank room, only one door with a small window and the tiniest crack at the bottom from which I can hear the mutters of directors, accompanists, the shuffle of sheet music and the bland reading of sides from an assistant, followed by some of the most absolute rubbish you’ve ever heard. It’s drawl, the way these actors kick and scream to be heard in the silence of a room, with all eyes on them. If they’d just relax, maybe they’d make it. They’d make it like I’m going to make it, and they’d thank me. 

As I listened, the room slowly cleared. What started as twenty or thirty of us slowly melted down to fifteen or twenty. I looked at the person next to me, studying their short hair, buzzed. Their clothes, baggy and unkempt, and their eyes wide and darting up and down the page in front of them. I could see the focus, the concentration on what felt like the entire world on that page. After about ten seconds of me looking, their eyes snuck a glance in my direction. 

“What do you see?” they asked, so quietly that it took a moment to register I was being spoken to.

I looked into their eyes. 

“On the page?” I asked them.

“Yeah. What do you see when you look at that page they gave you? That they gave us?”

I turned from them to the page. “If I’m being honest,” I said, raising my eyebrows and squinting, “I see some areas for improvement.” They laughed and I continued, “The scene is entirely too long for what it’s actually trying to say, yet these characters can’t seem to get it out, they can’t get to the point, even by the end. It’s all just lost in itself.”

They stared at me still, then looked around the room. “But all these people don’t see it that way. Look at them. To them, these words are gospel. For the time they are in this room, there are no words that matter other than these, you understand? This right here is all we ever need to know.”

I studied the page again, the short scene between two brothers — one older, one younger — who can’t seem to figure out where it is their sister has gone. Perhaps I should explain. It’s this odd thriller, at least from what I understand, about a family who quite literally loses themselves, and by the end, it’s just two brothers going down an endless road following the rest of their family, until they come to a fork in the road. Then they realize that the only way they can most effectively find their family is if they split up, then at least one of them will have a hope of catching up, while the other will just have to keep walking.

I told you, I don’t like it. So maybe I’m not doing it justice. It’s all very surreal.

The person in the unkempt clothes continued to look at me. They said again, “Do you understand that, what I’m saying to you?”

I blinked. “Yes,” I said. “I guess I can’t do that.”

The door opened and another was let in. After a moment of silence I heard the voices begin quietly in the room, starting at a murmur, then suddenly increasing to yells interspersed with the calm and disconnected voice of someone reading back lines.

“BUT WE CAN’T GO TOGETHER!” I heard muffled through the door. “YOU KNOW IT’S NOT RIGHT!”

*It must be a scene from the end of the show*, I thought as I studied my own page. I didn’t see that line at all as I scanned down, reading the highlighted lines marked “Joey”, my character’s name.

The whole time the person with the unkempt clothes had sat next to me, their eyes never leaving my face, watching me as I reacted, listened to the other actors in the room, ran my eyes over and over down the page. *If I’m memorized,* I thought, *they’ll notice that.* 

As the door was opened again, some light entered the room. I tried to peer in and saw nothing behind the woman with the straw-colored hair that stood in the doorway. Her glasses, her green cardigan, her loose-fitting jeans, and the Doc Martens on her feet; she was without-a-doubt the writer. I could tell by how she held the pages in her hand, firmly but tenderly, like a mother holds their child. 

She called a name and I felt the eyes beside me leave my face as they turned towards the woman. I heard the rustle of clothes, and from the corner of my own eyes saw what looked like a stick figure in a dirty shirt and pants three sizes to big for them, sauntering towards the room. I could feel their confidence as they let pages fall from their hand, walking sloppily but with poise through the door. As they passed the woman she stood over the threshold, watching me for a moment. I could taste the dryness of my mouth, feel the emptiness of the hot, still air on my face. When she finally shut the door, I finally breathed in slowly through my nose. I smelled the room, a nearly empty air freshener doing it’s best to hide the smell of wanting, hot and terrified actors on a humid summer day. 

It was three o’clock. By five o’clock, the room had mostly cleared. There was just one more person in the room with me. We looked at each other periodically across the room, trying to fake a smile as the cacophony blazed from inside. After a few minutes I said, “How many of these have you done?”

Their face softened as they turned to me, seemingly relieved by the attempt at small talk. “Oh, I’ve been here loads of times,” they replied. “Over the past ten years that this production company has been doing shows, I’ve auditioned for them.”

“Really?” I was surprised at first, but as they turned into the light I saw they didn’t look much older than me. “And how has it been for you?”

“Well, they’re very kind,” they began, interrupted by a shout from the other room (*“But if I take the other road, how will you see me again!?” —* tough script, even tougher acting). They continued, “I have to say tons of people come for these auditions, and no matter how much time it takes I’m always seen. They make sure to see everyone.”

“And have you gotten a part yet?”

There was a pause as they considered.

“Not yet,” the second work elongated as if it was a stretch to pull it out of their mouth, “but I know they’re looking for a spot I might fit in, you know? They told me last time that they’d write something for me.”

“For *you*?” I was surprised. How could someone who couldn’t even get casted be having a part written for them? I had been coming to these auditions for years, playing and studying every part to the depths of its being. Jealousy rose within me as I soured, “Well, maybe *one* of these days they’ll get around to writing that. For now, I guess you’ll just have to hope your acting will be enough.”

They laughed. “I suppose so.”

Their naïveté frustrated me, their hopeful confidence unfounded. I felt my muscles tighten, but before I could do anything, the door opened and they were ushered in, leaving me by myself in the room. 

After about five minutes, I noticed the silence in the room. Not my room, but the one all of the actors had disappeared into. There was no reading of lines, no dampened cordialities seeping through the walls or through the crack under the door. It was then that I heard a small whirring noise. It took a while looking around and then I saw it.

Above me, a camera, and a voice speaking over a breaking PA: “You will be seen now.”

The role of a lifetime. I could barely believe my eyes and ears, I didn’t even notice the sound of the door locking or the faint hissing as the AC turned on.
