Sirens wailed in the distance, but my mind fluctuated from thought to thought, unable to settle on any one thing. I’ve never used a gun before in my life… how could the first time I held one end like this? I knew it wasn’t truly me who pulled the trigger, but the weight of the gun, the officer’s face as he fell to the ground, that sulfury-sweet scent lingering in the air after the shot. Those were my memories now, just as much as they were Cabman’s.

And then there was the radio’s last transmission, playing over and over in my head.

Davis...

Could Zoey know this woman?

The thought of it all made me sick.

The cab door slammed behind me. My hands gripped the wheel. The rain intensified, drowning out the sound of the engine as it roared to life. I hit the gas, tires screeching, as the car lost traction on the wet roads and slid onto the empty street.  

The sirens became louder as the flashing blue and red lights filled the rearview mirror.  

Those voices returned, louder than before, the angry choir swelling until the rest of the world disappeared. It was clear they weren’t just noise; they were chastising Cabman. They infiltrated his mind every time he was stressed, whenever fear gripped him, wherever doubt crept in. Those voices were relentless, like a punishment he could never escape.

But no matter how loud they grew; I could never make out their words. One thing was certain though, they hated Cabman. And they wanted him to suffer, to feel their pain as they tore into his unstable psyche, tormenting him from the inside out.

The voices angered him. I could feel his hatred growing, as he became singularly focused on the chase. He was being hunted, and he had to outlast his hunters.

I felt it in every fiber of my being… his thrill, his anger, his tenacity to win the game of it all. The cab weaved through traffic, barely squeezing between vehicles as I sped down the narrow city streets. Hanging a sharp right down a one-way road, the sun was coming up over the horizon. My foot hit the pedal stronger, harder than before. Faster. Faster. I had to go faster. 

The sirens were getting closer. Two police cars appeared in my rearview mirror, but I knew there were more following. I cut down an alley way as one of the patrol car’s emerged from the shadows of a side street. They had tried to anticipate my movements, setting up officers ahead in case I tried to take an alternate route. It was a good plan but Cabman was always one step ahead.

Or so I thought.

My excitement mounted; the chase was invigorating. But the thrill scared me, I couldn’t let myself enjoy this. I can’t give into Cabman’s evil. I gritted my teeth, knuckles white on the steering wheel. My breath came in ragged gasps.

Cabman counter steered, avoiding the officer’s attempt to block our cab. The police weren’t giving up. Every turn I took, every alley I ducked into, they were right there, closing in.  

I shot out of another alleyway, barreling toward a closed road sign. Cabman wanted off the main roads and back into the woods. He would be hidden, covered, and the darkness was his security blanket.

We had to cross traffic, moving faster than I could control. The cab took flight as we jumped the curb, weightless seconds before crashing back onto the asphalt. The tires screamed as we rounded the turn. Trying to focus, a blinding, white-hot explosion of light seared into my retinas like two burning stars.

Pain burned behind my eyes, an unbearable pressure forcing my vision to go white. The world blurred, but I felt myself yanking the wheel. Swerving with all my might, the tires screeching and the deafening sound of a car horn increasing the chaos. My stomach lurched as the cab skidded sideways, barely missing the oncoming car.  

I had lost total control.

My eyesight started to return, the horror before me coming into focus. A massive tree, dead ahead. No time to correct. Not a second to brace. Just branches looming toward the windshield. The voices in Cabman’s head erupted in a twisted chorus, jeering at the thought of his death. For the first time, I could understand them. They weren’t just noise anymore, they were celebrating. Like an unseen audience of onlookers excitedly applauding the demise of their most hated character.

“Do you hear it, Cabman? The sound of your own end?" one of the voices sneered.

“You took my life, now your time has come!” another chided.

“I thought you said you were untouchable but look at you now.”

“You’re a coward. You preyed on the weak to hide your own weakness.”

The voices spiraled in my head, overlapping in a relentless barrage… angrily chastising, condemning, rejoicing in Cabman’s misfortune.

Then…

Impact.

The crash was harsh, my body being thrown from the cab, but not just the physical force… it was like I was being ripped away from this reality.

A violent jolt, as if something inside me had been broken loose, like I was being yanked backward through the fabric of time itself.  

It felt like a dream where you’re falling. I dropped like a ragdoll through an empty void. But this wasn’t a dream. I plummeted through endless darkness, falling into a thick, suffocating black cloud of nothingness stretching infinitely in every direction.

I’d never seen darkness like this before, an abyss so thick and absolute that the farther I fell, the more nothingness there was.

It wasn’t just an absence of light… it was an absence of everything. No sound. No sense of surroundings. Just the terrifying weight of emptiness pressing in from all sides.

I thought my body would tear apart from the speed. Untethered, I plummeted, praying for it to end.

I grabbed at myself, trying to shield my body, gripping my arms, my chest—desperate to brace for something. An audible gasp escaped from my throat as I realized… these were my arms. My limbs. My chest. My legs.

No longer trapped in Cabman’s cursed body.

I was me again.

The sound of my gasp echoed through the void, reverberating endlessly. The repeats grew faster, distorting, layering into a dizzying loop. I felt my body stretching, pulling apart as my speed increased.

Until everything stopped.

Stillness.

Silence again. I was no longer moving.

Everything was just… dark.

I opened my eyes and inhaled sharply, my lungs burning as I jolted awake—air rushing into me like I had been drowning. My vision blurred, my pulse hammering in my ears.

The scene around me was familiar.

I was home… curled in a ball on my bedroom floor.

My heart slammed against my ribs. I clawed at the carpet, my fingers shaking. I could still feel the heat of the steering wheel, the sting of shattered glass in my skin, the suffocating grip of Cabman’s presence.

But he was gone.

I could still feel my body trembling from the fall, the shock still lingering.

But I was back.
