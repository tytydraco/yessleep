*Journal Entry #1*  
July 13th, 2008

I don’t know how long I’ve been here. Days? Weeks? Months? It all blurs together, the lights flickering above my head, the sterile smell of antiseptic suffocating me. I don’t even remember how I got here. But they say I’m crazy. They say I’m the one who killed them. They say I killed my family. But I didn’t. I didn’t.

I remember the night like it was yesterday. The house, the smell of the storm coming in, the thunder rumbling like something was pounding at the door. The wind howling.

And then it started.

I wasn’t alone anymore.

I was sitting in the living room, just zoning out, trying to watch something on TV to distract myself from the noise. The storm, the pressure in the air. But I couldn’t focus. I kept seeing something in the corner of my eye. A shadow, barely noticeable, but there. And then it moved.

At first, I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me. But then it started breathing. It was real. I could feel it.

It... it *wanted* me.

It didn’t speak at first, no voice, just that feeling. The air went cold. It was so cold, I could see my breath in the living room, but the heat was on. And that’s when I knew.

Something was in the house with me.

I stood up. I tried to move, tried to call out to my wife, to my kids. But the words wouldn’t come. My mouth was dry. My legs wouldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. My chest felt heavy, like something was crushing me from the inside out.

I tried to get to the stairs, to run to them, but my feet were frozen. I couldn’t move. I was trapped. Trapped in my own body. I couldn’t scream.

And that’s when I saw it.

It wasn’t human. It wasn’t anything that should exist. A shape, no form, no face—just a presence. It was *inside me*. It wasn’t just standing there anymore; it was pulling me, bending me, breaking me. I could feel it, crawling through my veins, through my mind.

It made me do things. I couldn’t stop it.

I didn’t kill them. I didn’t do it. But I saw it.

I saw what it did to them. My wife, my kids—*they weren’t them anymore*. Their eyes, wide and empty, hollow. Just like a puppet with no strings.

And I—*I couldn’t stop it*.

I wish I could say I remember their faces one last time. But the truth is, I don’t. I don’t remember what happened to them. I don’t remember the blood, the screams, the chaos.

I remember the silence after. The thick, suffocating silence. The feeling of something... *wrong*.

And then the cops showed up. I don’t even remember calling them. But they found me.

I was standing there, covered in blood. My hands, my face. I didn’t do it. I didn’t do any of that.

But they didn’t care. They didn’t want to hear it. They just saw the blood. They saw my face, my eyes. The look of someone who had done something terrible. And they believed it. They *believed* it was me.

They said I had snapped. That I was sick. That I was insane. They said I killed my family.

But I didn’t.

*It* did.

And now I’m here.

They told me I’d never leave this place. They told me I’d never see the outside again. And I know they’re right. Because if I left, it would follow me.

It’s still here. In my head. Watching me. Always watching.

I can feel it. Even now. It never leaves.

Sometimes, I’ll see it. A shape in the corner of my eye. A movement in the dark. And I know—it’s still waiting.

I can’t outrun it.

I thought writing this down would help. I thought maybe if I put it on paper, if I made it real in some way, it would go away. But it hasn’t.

*It’s still here.*

And the worst part?

I’m starting to wonder if it’s always been here.

That thought is in my head now. It’s digging its claws in deep, making me doubt everything I’ve ever known. Making me question what’s real and what isn’t.

I don’t think I can take it anymore.

The walls close in, and I can feel *it* watching me. It’s been waiting for this. Waiting for me to break. And now—now I think I’m ready.

I’ve been here too long. Locked away. Trapped. And there’s no way out.

Maybe if I do it, I’ll finally stop hearing its whispers. Maybe if I end it, *it* will finally be quiet.

I won’t be stuck in this cage anymore. I won’t have to hear *it* inside my head anymore.

The doctors don’t get it. They won’t ever understand. They think it’s just me. But they’re wrong.

I wish it would all stop. 

If only it would just... all end.

I’m sorry, I thought I got over it. 

I thought I escaped the guilt, it has been around a year since I last wrote in here, but no-its back.

I can’t live with this anymore. The guilt. The whispers. The thing inside me. I just—*I just can’t*.

If they find this, maybe they’ll finally understand. Maybe they’ll finally know what I went through.

But I don’t think they’ll care. They never did. They never will.

Maybe the last thing I’ll hear is the sound of my own breath. Maybe that’ll be enough.

Goodbye.
