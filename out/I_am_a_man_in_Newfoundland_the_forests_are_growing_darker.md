Father Westwood arrived at the beginning of November. A few weeks had passed since the night of the knocking, things had remained relatively tame. Whispering late at night, scratching, tapping, but nothing as crazy as the knocking. Still, I had no idea what, or who was behind all this. It was extremely disturbing and I had barely gotten any sleep. 



If Father Westwood noticed the bags under my eyes he didn’t say anything. 

and 

“Good day, Father,” I said, greeting him at the ferry landing.



Father Westwood was an older, yet muscular man with greying temples and a mustache so bushy it would make Friedrich Nietzsche jealous. Besides the perpetual frown he wore and the way his eye twitched behind his thick glasses as he spoke, he was a welcome sight. He looked past me at the small town of Blythe and wrinkled his nose. 



“Where is it?” Father Westwood demanded.



Skipping the pleasantries, I led him through Blythe toward the church. The carving was still very present and noticeable on the side of the church. Father Westwood approached the carving and ran his finger along one of the grooves. Looking at it clearly during the day, I noticed that several areas appeared burned like they were carved with hot iron. 



Father Westwood gripped his cross and whispered a quick prayer to himself, before stepping back and splashing a small bit of holy water on the rune.



Frankly, I felt like an idiot for not doing the same earlier but I was too scared to touch it before. Father Westwood, whether he believed me or not, did not suffer from the same anxiety. He took a few pictures of his own before turning to me.



“Your message said this wasn’t the first?” He asked.



“No, Father.”



“Take me there.”



The ruins of the Heathstead house had remained untouched since they recovered Marie’s body after the fire. There wasn’t much left of the structure, what little there was had collapsed in on the basement. Blackened logs and scorched concrete. I whispered a quick prayer for the dead as Father Westwood walked the perimeter. The sea was angry and frothing, spray was hitting us like rain and the wind threatened to take us off our feet. I shivered in my boots, but he didn’t seem the least fazed.



“You say it was in the basement?” Father Westwood asked, his voice clear despite the wind.



“Yes, Father. Cleaned it up myself afterward.”



“Before or after the fire?”



“Before. Several months before.”



Father Westwood bounced his mustache on his lip as he thought. He shook his head after a few seconds and looked around. After he confirmed there was no one around us, he hopped down into the basement and began pushing around the rubble. 



“Father! Father, I think we should go! This isn’t appropriate!” I exclaimed, hesitantly looking around. 



If anyone saw us, that could be bad. Worse, if Gregory saw us, he would likely keep his promise. 



Father Westwood paid no attention to me. I thought he was crazy until he pushed part of a burned beam to the side. Underneath was a familiar-looking rug. While it was blackened and burned, it appeared to be intact. Father Westwood looked up at me and then back at the rug. Slowly, he lifted it revealing a preserved portion of a bloody rune. 



I immediately felt nauseous. Instantly, I had dozens of questions but I couldn’t even focus on anything. Marie had made her own rune before the fire. I felt a shiver go down my spine. Father Westwood grimaced before snapping several pictures and crawling out of the house. He turned back and again splashed some holy water over the ruins. 



We stood there for a few minutes afterward. I was still processing what the rune could mean and Father Westwood was off staring into the forest behind the Heathstead house. I didn’t notice until afterwards but he drew a cross with his holy water toward the woods. 



That night, after we had dried off, Father Westwood printed off his pictures and made a phone call. I wasn’t privy to the conversation, instead I was resigned to sitting in a pew with Spots purring in my lap. 



What little I overheard went like this: “No. No. Mhm. Yes…yes. No.”



Despite the rather one-sided nature of the conversation, I still listened intently. I didn’t even notice Spots’s attempts at playing with my hand. 



“Unclear,” Father Westwood said with a sigh, picking up one of the photographs, “What do you want me to do?”



A few, painfully long seconds dragged by.



“Understood,” Father Westwood said, hanging up the phone.



He stroked his mustache a few times before walking over and sitting in a pew adjacent to mine. 



“Well?” I asked, anxiously.



“It is the position of the Vatican…” Father Westwood started, “That this is superstitious nonsense.”



Hearing those words, I didn’t feel sad or angry, just defeated. I dug my palms into my eyes and slouched back in the pew. The soft patter of rain echoed through the church. It was cold and I don’t think it was entirely the weather. 



We sat there, listening to the rain and Spots’s occasional meows for attention, for several minutes. Eventually, Father Westwood stood up, cleaned his glasses with his shirt, and turned to me.



“I am sorry,” he started, “I know this isn’t the news you were hoping for.”



I didn’t respond. I could only pray that I had the strength to face the coming trials alone. A daunting prospect. Frankly, part of me considered giving up and just leaving with Father Westwood. I knew it wouldn’t be that easy, however. 



“What do I do next, Father?” I asked.



Father Westwood let out a long exhale. He bounced his mustache while he was thinking and stared at the door.



“Care to join me for a walk?” 



The town of Blythe was fast asleep as we walked through the sparsely paved streets. What few lights there were illuminated our way and glistened off puddles in the street. Despite us each having an umbrella, I was shivering from the cold wind alone. 



“Beautiful place you ended up,” Father Westwood said, he didn’t appear bothered by the weather at all, “Is it true there are Viking settlements around here?” 



“N-no just landings or something.”



“Hmm. It’s good to know the history of the land you call home.”



We continued in silence for several minutes longer.



“Do you believe me, Father?” I asked.



“Belief is a powerful thing. I think something is going on. I don’t like not having the full truth.”



We talked for a little longer as we strolled through the town. It wasn’t until we were on the stretch of road back to the church that I felt a shift in Father Westwood’s demeanor. He began fiddling with his rosary as we walked and whispered a few prayers to himself. While normally this wouldn’t be the weirdest behavior at the moment, it made my stomach clench.



We walked past the church. I stopped at the door expecting Father Westwood to follow but instead, he continued into the dark forest. I called out to him but he didn’t respond. Hesitantly, I chose to follow. He didn’t stop until we were so deep into the forest that the church was nothing more than a hazy light through the trees.



“Father?” I asked as I approached.



He had his back towards me while he slowly unwrapped the rosary from his wrist and then rewrapped it again. 



“Do you agree that we all must make sacrifices, Father?” Father Westwood asked.



My mouth was dry as I tried to respond.



“Y-yes….You aren’t… you aren’t going to give yourself to it are you?” I asked.



Father Westwood drew his small ampule of holy water and crucifix from his pockets.



“I pray you will forgive me,” Father Westwood muttered.



I didn’t even fully process what happened next until it was over. A twig snapped somewhere behind me causing me to jump and turn. Before I even realized, Father Westwood was behind me and kicked in the back of my knees sending me sprawling out into the mud. Pain shot through my body as my head bounced. I struggled for air and my ears went silent from the impact. 



“…yourself!” Father Westwood shouted, “You wanted him! So take him! Show yourself and face the consequences!”



I groaned and tried sitting up. Father Westwood’s foot fell on my sternum pushing me back down. 



“I am sorry,” he said, “this needs to be done.”



I tried pushing his foot away, but I was still too in shock to put up much resistance. I did, however, feel the heavy footstep that hit the ground in the woods just beyond our sight. 



We both froze, I couldn’t see much but the shrubs around us. But whatever Father Westwood saw made him start shaking. It was only then that I realized that while he might have been the one sent by the Vatican, he was just as inexperienced as I was. 



“B-b-be gone…” He whimpered, splashing holy water in the direction of the footstep.



There was another heavy footstep. Father Westwood’s gaze started moving upwards. His mouth fell open and his weight on my sternum subsided.



I took this small advantage and shoved Father Westwood’s leg as hard as possible. He lost his balance and crashed into the mud. I crawled away as my feet struggled to gain traction. Behind me, I heard Father Westwood screaming and yelling, whether at me or the demon, I didn’t know. 



My feet finally got under me and I ran faster than I ever thought possible through the trees. The faint light of the church was my guiding star. Branches whipped at my face as I crashed through the trees, I didn’t feel the footsteps behind me but I didn’t want to risk the longer trek of the established path.



I slid on the steps of the church cutting open a gash on my leg but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop. Even on my hands and knees, I crawled into the church and slammed the door shut as fast as I could. I braced my entire weight against the door, ready for whatever was coming next. There wasn’t anything. 



No demon. No Father Westwood, Nothing.



I began to sob uncontrollably. Before my stationing at Blythe, I would have considered myself a stoic man. But that night I sobbed like a newborn. Tears, snot, blood, all of it. Once the adrenaline wore off I finally settled down but the edge remained. 



I didn’t sleep at all that night. Several times throughout I swore I could hear Father Westwood’s tear-filled pleas and screams echoing in the night. Whether it was real or not, I didn’t know.



The next morning, I went looking for him. It wasn’t the smartest decision I’ve ever made but I rationalized it because I had never had any incidents during the day. Snow was starting to fall when I stumbled out. It was too wet to stick but it was cold. Like hell itself was freezing over.



I told myself I would turn around at the Old Growth Tree like I normally did and if I couldn’t find him myself, I would get the sheriff. There would be no need to get the sheriff involved. I found him, Father Westwood if he would even call himself a Father, at the base of the Old Growth Tree. He was on his knees and naked, head to toe. Fresh cuts and dark bruises dotted his body. It wasn’t until I got closer that I realized he was also muttering to himself. 



“Father?” I asked as I got closer.



That seemed to snap him out of it as he slowly stood up.



“Is it gone?” He asked, his voice broken.



“Is what gone?” I asked.



He just cried in response. Despite protests from the local doctor, Father Westwood would leave that afternoon. He boarded the ferry without even looking back at me once. His perpetual scowl was replaced with silent sorrow. 



I wish I could have asked Father Westwood more about what happened to him. Maybe see if he told the Cardinal anything. Maybe his experience would prove the validity of the events here in Blythe. So many possibilities that would never come.



That night when traveling back to the mainland, the ferry ignited. The entire craft and all eight souls aboard were instantly engulfed in a raging inferno that sent the craft to the bottom of the ocean.



I am not a betting man, but if I were, I would bet my life that somewhere on that ferry in the minutes before it burned, a lone man committed a terrible act. Somewhere on that wreck, is a rune made of blood and viscera. As that ferry sank, so too did my only hope of salvation.
