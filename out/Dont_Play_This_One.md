I don’t even know why I’m writing this.

I’ve moved twice. Changed phones. Burned everything I thought could be connected. But the breathing still happens at night, under my bed. The static returns every time I close my eyes. And the faces—they never stopped showing up.

So maybe I’m writing this for you.

Or maybe this story just needs to keep telling itself.

It was the summer of 1987. Ohio. The kind of heat that makes the sidewalks bubble and kills your appetite. That Friday, five of us had a sleepover in Danny Porter’s basement: me (Chris), Tommy, Robbie, Shawn, and Danny. It was our usual tradition—horror movies, junk food, and daring each other not to piss our pants before morning.

Danny’s older brother Kyle worked at a video store. Not one of the clean corporate ones—this place didn’t even have a name on the front, just a flickering neon OPEN sign and rows of sticky carpets. He brought us a stack of tapes with handwritten labels. Evil Dead II. The Gate. Some weird foreign one called “Angst.” But there was one tape with no label at all. Just a black shell and old masking tape that had peeled off.

In sharpie, barely visible: “Don’t Play This One.”

So of course, we played it first.

It didn’t start with anything. Just a black screen. Faint static. A wet breathing sound, like someone hyperventilating inside a plastic bag. Then, out of nowhere, the image snapped into place—and we were looking at a grainy shot of a basement.

Danny’s basement.

The exact layout. Same broken lamp. Same ugly green carpet. The same dent in the drywall where Kyle once punched a hole during a tantrum. I thought it was some weird home video at first. But none of us had ever seen this tape. And nobody was filming.

Then something came into the frame.

Not from the side—from above.

It skittered along the ceiling, backwards, like a puppet with its strings tangled. Its limbs were long and shaking. Its face—if you can even call it that—was stretched like plastic wrap over a skull. No eyes. No mouth. Just a wet, pulsing thing behind translucent skin. It crawled across the ceiling, turned its head 180 degrees toward the camera…

…and the screen went black.

The lights in the basement blew out. All of them. At once.

The air turned sour—like burnt meat and rusted pennies. Then we heard it: breathing. Not from the tape. Not from us. From behind the dryer.

Tommy grabbed the flashlight. He was the loud one, the funny one. Never took anything seriously. “Probably just a blown fuse,” he said. “I’ll fix it or die trying.”

He disappeared behind the laundry machines and never came back.

We called for him, begged, screamed. Eventually, we found the flashlight lying on the floor. Still on. Still warm. But it was pointing straight at the ceiling.

Something had been written in red crayon on the wall behind it:

“SOMETHING ALIVE UNDER THE HOUSE. IT WEARS FACES.”

There was a sound—wet, like someone chewing too close to your ear.

Then we saw it.

Tommy’s face—just his face—was nailed to the concrete wall like a goddamn deer trophy. His skin was peeled off with surgical precision. It was twitching. One eyelid fluttered. The mouth opened just enough to exhale.

I ran. I actually ran to the storm door and tried to pry it open, but what was on the other side wasn’t the backyard anymore.

It was a hallway.

Impossible. Too long. Too red. The walls pulsed like a throat. The carpet was soaked and sticky, and every ten feet there were mirrors—but they didn’t reflect us.

They showed versions of ourselves.

Robbie with his jaw ripped off. Me with my head turned backwards. Tommy without a body. Robbie backed away from one of the mirrors and whispered, “That’s not me.”

Then he was gone.

No scream. No puff of smoke. Just gone. Like he never existed.

The phone lines were dead. The windows showed nothing but static. Not outside—in the glass itself. It was like the entire house had been swallowed. Like we weren’t on Earth anymore.

Then the TV came back on.

No one touched it. But it turned on, and it showed things we should’ve never seen.

Shawn’s arms, covered in burn marks. Me curled in my bedroom corner, rocking while my stepfather pounded on the door. Tommy, crying over his dad’s grave.

Then it showed Danny.

At the lake.

Last summer.

There was a girl, pale and thin, floating just beneath the surface. Everyone said it was an accident. But on the screen, Danny held her head under. He whispered something we couldn’t hear. And when she stopped moving—when we thought she was dead—her eyes opened underwater.

And she smiled.

Shawn started praying. Repeating the same phrase over and over. “God will protect me. God will protect me.”

The lights flickered again. When they came back on… Shawn was inside the TV.

I’m not trying to be poetic. I mean he was inside it. Pressed up against the screen. Screaming without sound. Scraping the glass. Behind him, that thing from before stretched its limbs toward him—its body twitching like it was being pulled by invisible hooks. Then it yanked him back into the static.

The screen turned black.

Danny didn’t move.

He sat cross-legged on the floor, eyes wide, mouth open. “It’s showing me stuff I forgot,” he said. “She said I was supposed to die too.”

That’s when I ran.

I didn’t look back.

I smashed the basement window, tore myself up on the glass, and sprinted barefoot down the street until a cop picked me up and wrapped me in a blanket like I was some lost toddler.

The official report? Gas leak. House fire. They said there were five bodies in the basement, too charred to identify.

But I’m not dead.

And neither was Danny.

I’ve tried to forget. Really, I have.

But it won’t stop.

The static started again last week. First on my phone. Then my car radio. Then my dreams.

Last night, I saw Shawn again. Just for a second. His face, behind my bedroom mirror.

He mouthed something to me.

I think it was: “Now it’s your turn.”

If you ever find an unlabeled VHS tape in your attic, or at a garage sale, or just sitting somewhere it shouldn’t be—don’t play it.

Don’t touch it.

Don’t even look at it.

Because it’s not a movie.

It’s a doorway.

And once you’ve seen what’s behind it…

…it sees you back
