It happened again last night. I saw the film—the one that only plays when I’m asleep. This was the third time this week. I wish I could tell you it was just another weird dream, some fleeting nonsense my tired brain conjured up. But every time I wake up after watching it, something in my real life is… different. And not in a small way either. At first I thought I was losing my mind, misremembering things. Now I’m certain it’s the film that’s changing everything around me, piece by piece.

The first time I dreamed of the film, I didn’t realize what I’d seen. I woke up with only hazy images in my mind: a dimly lit, mostly empty movie theater; dust dancing in the projector beam that cut through the darkness; a musical score playing faintly (something classical, almost a lullaby); and a feeling of quiet dread hanging in the air like a fog. I brushed it off as an ordinary dream, albeit a vivid one. That morning, I was groggy but nothing felt out of place—at least not until I left my apartment and noticed the old willow tree outside was gone.

I stood on the sidewalk, staring at the patch of dirt where the willow had been. It was a mature tree, easily forty feet tall, one that had stood outside the building for as long as I could remember. Now there was just raw earth and a few stray roots poking up like exposed nerves. I even pressed my hand to the kitchen window, half expecting to feel the familiar rough trunk through the glass. Nothing. The tree had vanished without a trace overnight.

My first thought was that the city must have come with a crew at dawn, removed the tree due to disease or old age. It was early, the sun barely up, and maybe I had just slept through chainsaws and machinery somehow. I asked my neighbor about it later that day, but she looked at me like I was crazy. “What tree?” she replied. The huge willow right outside, I insisted. She pursed her lips and told me she’d lived in this building five years and there had never been a willow tree there. I laughed it off, confused. Maybe I had dreamed the tree, too? Or maybe she was messing with me. I even googled old street photos, only to find images with no willow in front of the building at all. It made no sense. I knew that tree. I’d stood under its shade last summer!

The second time it happened, I started to suspect something strange was going on. Two nights after the willow vanished, I had another dream of the film. I remember more of it this time. I was not just an observer in a theater—I was in the film, or at least it felt that way. I was a kid, riding my old red bicycle down the hill on Mulberry Street where I grew up. In the dream, a dog darted out and I swerved. I felt the impact, the ground tearing into my skin. It was so visceral I jolted awake in a cold sweat, heart hammering in my chest.

My sheets were damp and twisted from my restless sleep. Still shaky, I swung my legs out of bed—and hissed in pain. A sharp, burning throb radiated from my right knee. Confused, I rolled up my pajama pant leg. There was a fresh scab stretching across my kneecap, raw and angry red, as if I’d wiped out on pavement. I stared at it, uncomprehending. I hadn’t hurt myself, not recently. But it looked exactly like the kind of scab a kid gets from a bad bike fall.

I hobbled to the bathroom and flipped on the light. In the mirror, I could see it better—a large scrape with bits of grit still embedded. Dried blood streaked down my shin. My stomach turned at the sight. How could this injury be real? I touched it gingerly and winced. It was real alright. I spent the next hour disinfecting it, my mind whirling. That morning I called my mom, half-laughing, half-nervous, to ask if I’d ever crashed my bike on Mulberry Street as a kid. There was a pause on the line. Then she chuckled, “Of course you did, honey. You still have the scar, don’t you? You were so brave, you got right back on that bike after the ER stitched you up.”

I felt cold all over as I hung up. I have no scar on my knee—at least, I never did before. But sure enough, after cleaning the wound I found the faint silvery line of an old scar under the fresh scrapes, a scar that had not been there yesterday. Memories I never had began to trickle in: the smell of the hospital, the itch of the stitches, a phantom ache when it rained. They felt real, but I knew they were new, like someone had edited my life and inserted this scene.

I spent the rest of that day double-checking my own memories against reality. I dug out an old photo album, hands trembling as I flipped through pages. Sure enough, there was a picture of ten-year-old me with a bandaged knee, grinning gap-toothed at the camera while my mother held up my crutches. The photo had never been in my album before—I was certain. Yet there it was, physical proof of a childhood accident I never lived through until last night. I felt like I’d gone crazy. But the scab on my knee still stung, grounding me in the present. I had to accept that somehow the dream had reached out and altered the facts of my life.

I wanted to tell someone—my best friend, Mark, or maybe my girlfriend, Elena—but how could I explain any of this without sounding insane? “Hey, do you remember that giant willow tree outside my place? No? Well, it was there yesterday.” Or, “Did you know I apparently almost lost my leg in fourth grade and just forgot about it for twenty years?” It was futile. Instead, I feigned a stomach bug and took the day off work. I spent hours pacing my apartment, chain-drinking black coffee to stay alert. I was terrified of what would happen if I fell asleep again.

By nightfall, my nerves were shot. I hadn’t slept properly in over 24 hours. Every time I blinked, I saw afterimages—perhaps from exhaustion, perhaps something else. Once, as I splashed cold water on my face, I swore I saw a flash of light on the bathroom wall behind me, as if a projector had come to life for a split second. There was no source, of course. Just my phone’s flashlight reflecting weirdly… or my imagination. The shadows under my eyes looked like bruises. My head ached. Still, I refused to lie down. I would not dream, I told myself. If I didn’t dream, nothing would change.

But eventually, sometime around 3 a.m., I hit the wall. My body betrayed me. I remember sitting on the couch, the TV droning infomercials at low volume while I browsed forums for anything about “dreams changing reality”. My eyes were so heavy. I blinked and suddenly the TV wasn’t on anymore—my apartment was dark. The clock read 4:47 a.m. I had lost nearly two hours. A surge of panic brought me fully awake. I checked my phone’s camera roll, my messages, the front door lock—trying to see if I had sleepwalked or done anything in that missing time. Everything was as I left it. Everything except for the fact that I had apparently fallen asleep sitting upright. And I had dreamed.

My heart was pounding. I tried to recall what I’d seen in the dream, but it slipped away like smoke. Only an uneasy feeling remained, a dread that something important had just happened on that screen. I needed to check on things. The apartment looked the same at first glance. The willow was still gone, my knee still bandaged. But something new was off—I could feel it in my bones, a wrongness in the atmosphere. Dawn light was creeping in, so I threw on a jacket and decided to go see Mark. I needed to see a familiar face, to ground myself.

Mark lived two floors down. We hung out almost every other day—playing video games, grabbing beers, complaining about work. He was my one constant through all of this. I knocked on his door, softly at first then harder. No answer. Odd; he was an early riser. After the third knock, the door across the hall cracked open. Old Mrs. Gomez peeked out, bleary-eyed. “Who are you looking for, dear?” she asked. “Mark… Mark Tillman. Did he go out?” I replied. She furrowed her gray brows. “Nobody by that name lives on this floor. It’s just been me and the Nguyen family for years.” She must have noticed the color drain from my face because she added hastily, “Maybe your friend moved out?”

“Moved out…right,” I mumbled, stumbling back. I knew Mark hadn’t moved. We were literally playing Fortnite together in his living room two nights ago. I fumbled for my phone and pulled up my contacts. Mark’s entry was gone. My text history with him—gone. Photos? I scrolled frantically through my camera roll. Every selfie, every group shot from parties and hikes—Mark was missing. In some, he was just… not there at all, leaving a conspicuous gap. In others, a different acquaintance filled the spot—one of my coworkers, looking awkward in what should’ve been Mark’s place. A cold wave of nausea hit me. Mark Tillman had been erased from my life.

I don’t remember stumbling back to my apartment, but suddenly I was there, slamming the door behind me and sliding down to the floor. I tried Elena next. My hands were shaking so badly I nearly dropped the phone. Her number was still in my contacts, thank god. It rang and rang. Just before it went to voicemail, she picked up. “…Hello?” Her voice was groggy. It was 6 a.m. after all. “Elena!” I gasped in relief. “Oh my god, El, I… something’s wrong. Mark is—” She cut me off, confused. “Who?” “Mark, you know, my best friend.” There was a pause. “Babe… you haven’t mentioned a ‘Mark’ in the year I’ve known you. Are you sure you’re okay?” she asked quietly. “Maybe you should get some rest, you sound…” She trailed off.

I couldn’t even respond. I just thanked her for picking up and hung up abruptly, my head spinning. A year? Elena and I had been together three years, not one. But now that I thought about it, flashes of a “new” memory rose to the surface: meeting Elena at a Christmas party last year and hitting it off, when originally we’d met in college ages ago. The history of our relationship had changed, just like everything else. Mark was gone and in the void he left, my timeline shifted enough that even my relationship’s origin was different. I wanted to scream. Instead I just sat on the floor of my living room, surrounded by photo albums filled with holes and lies, trying not to lose my grip on reality entirely.

My eyes fell on the scattered pages of notes I’d written last night, the ones meant to document the original reality. They were still there on the coffee table, covered in my frantic handwriting. Proof that it all really happened—at least I remembered how things used to be. I clung to that for a moment, picking up a page at random and reading my own words: “Mark Tillman - friend since college - now gone.” A bitter laugh escaped me. It felt like reading a eulogy for a person no one but me remembered.

At some point, adrenaline and terror gave way to a hollow numbness. I knew I couldn’t keep doing this alone. If I didn’t find answers, I’d lose myself. So I broke my rule and did the one thing you should never do when you’re questioning your sanity: I went online. Most results were useless—new age blogs about lucid dreaming or schizophrenic gibberish. But on a dusty corner of the internet, I found a thread in a paranormal forum from 2008. A user named FilmBuff99 had posted: “Every night I watch a movie in my dreams. I think it’s changing things when I’m awake. No one believes me. Has this happened to anyone else?” There were only a few replies. The others mostly told him to seek therapy or joked that he was on drugs. The original poster never responded again after that initial post.

I stared at that screen until the words blurred. It was like reading my own thoughts. Had FilmBuff99 succumbed to the same thing? Did he vanish, or lose his mind, or worse? The thread was over a decade old—I’d never find out what happened to that person. I shut my laptop when I realized my hands were trembling uncontrollably. I needed help. Professional help, maybe. If reality was unraveling, could a psychiatrist even do anything? Doubtful, but maybe they could at least drug me dreamless. It was a slim hope, but better than nothing.

Morning edged toward afternoon as I weighed my options. Finally, I caved and phoned a psychiatrist I used to see years ago for anxiety. I was lucky he picked up at all on a Saturday. I didn’t go into detail—just blabbered that I hadn’t slept and was seeing things and needed help. My voice must have scared him because he agreed to squeeze me in over lunch.

Dr. Simons’ office was cool and bright, all reassuring beige tones and soft music. I sat on the leather couch twisting my hands while he peered at me over his glasses. I couldn’t tell him the full truth, or I’d be locked up for sure. So I rambled about intense nightmares, stress at work, maybe a pending psychotic break. It wasn’t far from the truth, really. He listened patiently. In the end, he scribbled something on his prescription pad. “I’m going to give you something to help you rest,” he said slowly, as if talking to a spooked animal. “Just a mild sedative. Take it tonight, you’ll get some sleep. We can regroup Monday and talk more then.” I nodded numbly and took the slip of paper.

I was both relieved and horrified. Relieved that he didn’t throw me into a padded cell on the spot—horrified because he was essentially telling me to do the one thing I feared most: sleep. I stumbled out of his office with the prescription and a pamphlet on sleep hygiene, feeling like I’d signed my own death warrant. I didn’t fill it right away. Instead, I wandered the city in a daze as evening fell, dreading going home to another night. I found myself standing at one point in front of an old cinema downtown, its marquee blank and dusty as if no film had shown there in years. The sight made me shiver; I hurried on, pulling my jacket tight against a chill that wasn’t just the autumn air. All around me, people were wrapping up their normal days—hailing cabs, walking dogs, grabbing dinner. To them it was just a Saturday like any other. To me, it felt like the last day before the end of the world, and only I knew it.

Back at my apartment, I scribbled down everything I could remember about the original versions of my life—details about Mark, about the willow tree, the accident I never had. I was terrified those memories might fade or warp if I lost any more time. The act of writing steadied me a little. It was something concrete, proof that at least I remembered how things used to be.

Around 9 p.m., as I sat clutching the pill bottle with shaking hands, there was a knock at my door. I nearly jumped out of my skin. For a second my brain conjured the image of some shadowy film character come to take me away. But it was Elena, thank god. I opened the door and she stepped in, eyes full of worry. She said I hadn’t sounded like myself on the phone. I must have looked a wreck because she immediately pulled me into a hug. “You’re freezing,” she murmured, feeling my forehead. I realized I was shivering.

I wanted so badly to unload everything on her, to make her understand. But seeing her standing there in my living room, concerned and very real, I couldn’t bring myself to drag her into my nightmare. I just muttered that I hadn’t slept and that I’d had a panic attack. She glanced at the pages of frenzied notes I’d left on the coffee table. “Is this why you were asking about your friend earlier?” she asked gently. “I… I guess. I don’t know,” I said. She gave me a long, searching look, then picked up the pill bottle from my hand. “Why haven’t you taken these?”

“I’m scared,” I admitted in a whisper. My eyes burned with exhausted tears I was too proud to shed. Elena’s face softened. “Hey, it’s okay. You’re not going to feel better until you sleep.” She tapped two pills out, not just one. “Take these. I’ll stay the night, watch some boring TV next to you. If you get any nightmares, I’ll wake you, okay?” I wanted to protest that she couldn’t possibly wake me from this, but I had no fight left. Maybe it was the faint scent of her perfume or the steadiness of her voice, but I nodded. I swallowed the pills. She helped me to bed like I was an invalid.

The sedatives pulled me under in no time. Despite Elena’s presence beside me, I felt myself slipping into the familiar darkness of that dream world. This time, I found myself back in the old movie theater, the one from the very first dream. I was seated in the front row now, and the screen loomed huge and bright before me. There were no other patrons, no sound but the whir of the projector somewhere behind me. My body felt leaden; I couldn’t move from the seat.

On the screen, scenes from my life flickered. I saw myself as a boy blowing out birthday candles—only I was alone, no family around the table. Cut to teenage me, sitting in an empty classroom, desks vacant. A jump cut—I was older, standing in an aisle of blooming willow trees, row after row of them lining a street I didn’t recognize. The film jumped again, and I was watching a new scene: Elena walking past me on a city sidewalk as if I were a stranger, her eyes sliding over me with no recognition.

“No,” I tried to shout, but in the theater only a strained whisper escaped my lips. I struggled to move, to get out of that damned seat and stop this, but it was like being pinned by invisible weights. The projector light above me burned intensely. The scenes kept changing, faster now. I saw my mother younger, crying in a hospital waiting room—no, not crying, just sitting quietly as a doctor shook her hand. Through some impossible perspective, I saw into the doctor’s clipboard: a birth certificate with my name, and the word stillborn stamped in stark black letters.

I started sobbing, a raw animal sound. The film was wiping me out entirely—undoing my very birth. Image after image blazed by: an empty nursery with pale yellow walls, a little league team photo with one boy missing in the lineup, a high school graduation with an unfilled chair on stage. Then came adult life: office group pictures with a gap where I should be, holiday gatherings where my mom and dad posed as a childless couple. Each scene was a world where I wasn’t there, as if I’d been meticulously cut out of every frame of reality.

At last, the film sputtered. The screen went white with the final blinding flare of a projector reaching the end of its reel. In the sudden silence, I realized I could stand. I got up on shaky legs and turned around, desperate to confront the source of all this. Up in the projection booth window, I saw a shape—a human silhouette. My heart leapt into my throat. “Why are you doing this?” I screamed, my voice echoing in the empty theater. The silhouette did not answer. It just cocked its head, as if studying me. Then it raised a hand in a small wave… and switched off the projector.

Everything went dark.

I awoke to morning light and the sound of silence. The apartment was empty. Elena was gone—no imprint on the pillow, no note, nothing. For one blissful second I thought maybe she’d just stepped out for coffee. Then I noticed her overnight bag wasn’t there. Neither were the empty pill packets that had been on my nightstand. It was like she had never come at all. Dread coiled in my stomach as I got up and searched the apartment. Her presence had been wiped clean.

Hands trembling, I grabbed my phone and called Elena’s number. It rang and rang, and my heart lifted when she answered. “Hello?” Her voice was cautious, like she gets with unknown callers. “Elena!” I breathed. “Thank god, you left, I was worried—” “Who is this?” she cut in. I stopped cold. “It’s… it’s me.” A pause. “I’m sorry, you must have the wrong number.” Her tone was polite, utterly unfamiliar. She hung up, leaving me listening to the dead line.

I sank into the couch in a daze. I think I knew what I’d find next, but I had to confirm. With a kind of morbid calm, I dialed my mother’s number. It went to voicemail—her cheerful voice asking callers to leave a message. I didn’t leave one. What could I say? Instead, I tried my dad’s old cell, the one he barely uses. He picked up on the third ring with a gruff, “Hello?”

For a moment, I couldn’t find my voice. “Dad?” I managed at last. “Who is this?” he replied. His tone held no recognition. “It’s me… it’s your son,” I said, voice barely above a whisper. There was a long silence. “I’m sorry, you have the wrong number,” he said, awkwardly, like he wasn’t sure. My throat clenched. “Dad, please.” I hated the pleading in my voice. The line stayed quiet for a long time. Then, softly, like he was speaking to someone else in the room, I heard him say: “Marianne, hang up. It’s some nutjob.” Marianne—my mother’s name. The call disconnected.

They didn’t know me. My own parents. Whether I had never been born or somehow their memories were stolen, it hardly mattered. To them—and to the rest of the world—I no longer exist. Only I remember the life I had, and even those memories are tenuous, like sand slipping through my fingers.

I’m writing this down—while I still can—in the hopes that maybe it will anchor me to reality, or that someone out there will read it and remember me, even when I’m gone. But I can feel it happening already: a numbness in my hands, a coldness creeping up through my bones. Like I’m fading. I don’t know what will happen when I finally fall asleep and there’s no one left to wake up. The film ended. The credits rolled. I think this story is over now—except I’m still here, caught in the final frame, waiting for the projector bulb to burn out.
