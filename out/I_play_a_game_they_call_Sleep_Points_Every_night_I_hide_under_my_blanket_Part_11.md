Remember my strategy of dealing with Ezra?  The one about keeping away, not making eye contact and ultimately just hoping for the best?  No such luck.  My day started when my clock pretty much forcibly jolted me awake with a noise way louder than anything I had expected.  8 o’clock sharp.  Just what I had set the alarm to.  I knew Anastasia had said that the clock would wake me up “without fail”, but holy shit.  

Pretty soon, after I caught my breath from having been scared half to death by my own bedroom clock in a whole new way, my family came into my room to wake me up.  I just tried pretending like I was still asleep and just hoped that they’d let me sleep in and take that Sunday off. That would at least buy me another week’s worth of time. Though of course, my parents could tell I was up and made me get dressed.  On the bright side, though, at least my foot was all good.

I still had to avoid Ezra at school too.  But that seemed like it should’ve been pretty easy since we never ran into one another at school.  As far as school went, all I had to do was keep myself out of detention again.  Or so I had initially thought.  The more I thought about him, the more my mind kept going back to the note that randomly showed up in my locker.  And how it had disappeared.  Ezra was the only explanation.  If he knew where my locker was, he could still very easily track me down if he wanted to, even at school.

These days, I was scared to come across him just about anywhere.  I never knew when he would turn up.  He seemed to have the uncanny ability of showing up wherever I was, right when I least expected, just like how he had on Friday night.  I just tried my best to stay around as many people as possible, so that way there would be other people to intervene on my behalf.  Or at least witnesses to testify against him in court.  

Although, come to think about it, Ezra never really struck me as the type to care about witnesses.  That would require him to care about getting himself a jail sentence.  And it wasn’t like he hadn’t done some hard time already.  He had.  At only 17, he already had a pretty lengthy criminal record.  Although it didn’t have any charges of attempted murder.  Yet.  I was about to fix that if I could help it.  There had to someone I could go to.

But, regardless of whether or not he was planning on committing any attacks in full view of bystanders, being around others was still the only thing that gave me some sense of solace on our way to church.  At least there, if he tried to come for me, there would be other people around to keep him at bay and fight back on my behalf.  I usually sat with my family, so if anything happened, they would have my back.  Besides.  Ezra was usually pretty well-behaved during church, as surprising as that always was to me.  Along with my own parents, I also had Isaiah and Naomi, Ezra’s mom and dad, keeping him in line as well.  That was probably why he was so well behaved at church in the first place.

When he came into the building and I saw him, I did everything I could to look away.  But his gaze was still locked on me.  When my family went to go sit down, I tried convincing them to sit further back, but they refused, opting for the seats they always sat at.  The ones right in front of the Livingstons.  Even if Ezra couldn’t actually do anything to me at church, he could still make my time there ungodly uncomfortable.

He must’ve spent pretty much the whole sermon burning holes in the back of my head.  I could just feel him staring me down the whole entire time.  I tried not to move my head.  Not even the slightest.  Not the smallest bit of movement that might give Ezra the sense that his behavior was getting my attention.  

Finally, service ended and mom and dad made their way to the food table out in the church's hallway, along with Ezra’s parents.  I was too nervous to move.  I had hoped he would just go along with them.  But he didn’t.  I at least hoped his parents would make him go along with them.  But they didn’t.  I guess he had a clean enough record at church for them to let him be.  We just stood there silently, for what felt like forever.

Eventually though, I did get the nerve to look back and address him.  Now, for reference, he usually looked pretty ugly.  Like not how a typical person looked.  I don’t really know how to describe it any better than that.  I'm not saying this just because I hate him.  Although I still certainly do.  But, even putting all of that aside, something about him just always looked a bit uncanny.  But today, he seemed to look just a little bit weirder and even more off than usual.  Somehow, he was a little more frightening to look at.  Which I was not at all pleased to discover.  

But I just chalked that up to the fact that I was dreading having to confront him about what he did Friday night.  That probably had a way of making him appear scarier in my mind.  That was the explanation that made the most sense.  But things that make sense don’t tend to happen to me, so I still had some suspicions and kept my guard up.

“Hello Ezra,” I said.

“I believe you mean--”, he started.

“Ezra.” I cut him off.  “Your name is Ezra.  YOU might be a racist, but you’re not gonna get me to go along with it.” I said, as seriously and with as much strength in my voice as I could muster.  

Ezra had a certain offensive alter ego that he always insisted others address him as.  It wasn't "Ezra the Edgelord" like I talked about in previous sections.  This one went by the name of "Dr. Shekelstein", an overtly antisemitic caricature, and one that he seemed to take great pride in, just as he always seemed to take great pride  in making fun of Jewish people.  Since surrendering to his demands and calling him "Dr. Shekelstein" required the other person to also engage in his prejudices right along with him, he was always very eager and insistent that other people do it.  But I was not about to.

“Woah, woah, woah there goy, I ain’t a racist,” he said.  He had a habit of calling people “goy”.  If you've been on the internet long enough, you'll probably know how a lot of alt-right antisemite types have a similar habit.  “I’m only racist against assholes.  Like black people for example,” he said.  Of course, he didn’t actually say the words “black people”.  But because the word he really did use wasn’t the sort of word that I’m in any mood to repeat, I’m sure you can use your imagination to fill in the gaps.

As with most things Ezra did, it was not only obscene, but also just really confusing.  How his comments were obscene is of course pretty obvious.  But the part that made them so hard to rationalize was the fact that Ezra, himself, is black too.  And, by making the mistake of attempting to reason with him, I tried to point this pretty obvious fact out to him.

“You’re black too.  Doesn’t that just make you racist against yourself?” I reminded him.

“Um, excuse you goy, but not ALL black people are --.” You get the idea.  “I happen to be one of the respectable ones.  God, why do you have to be such a racist and assume we’re all like THEM?”, he said as if this all made total sense.  Though, of course, he knew it didn’t.  The whole time he was wearing an expression of smug satisfaction in response to my confusion.  It was generally one of his favorite pass-times to deliberately confuse people and then try to convince them that they were the stupid ones for being confused.  Even though HE was the one who wasn’t making any sense on purpose.

“Well anyway,” he continued.  “Wuss crackin’ cracka?  Anything the matter?  You’re lookin’ very verklempt.”  He said.  

“Why are you calling me ‘cracker’?  What?  Is that supposed to be your way of saying that I’m somehow NOT one of the ‘respectable ones’?” I asked, accusingly.  Technically, I’m half Alaskan native, so I’m only half-white.  Honestly, I was just surprised he hadn’t brought up that part too by now.  He usually did.

“Why, yes, it is.”  He responded simply.

“Yeah.  Figures.” I said, as annoyed as I always was whenever I had to interact with him.

“Y’know, I honestly must agree.  Given how fucking obvious it is that you really aren’t one of the respectable ones, it really does, indeed, figure, doesn’t it, goy?” He said, as though I had just stupidly fallen into another one of his little traps.  And the worst part was, I couldn’t even say anything to dispute this.  I ultimately had.  I had just made the grave mistake of telling him that one of his comments made sense.  I had said “Figures.”  Of course, that wasn't REALLY because his comments made sense; but because they were just that annoyingly predictable.  But that didn’t matter to Ezra, of course.

“Anyway, what had you wanted to talk about again?  I got distracted from how fuckin’ boring and irrelevant this bullshit’s ‘boutta be,” he said.

“Why did you try to hit me with your car?” I asked, very upset and annoyed, not just by what had happened, but by how arrogant and flippant he was being about it all.

“Pffft” Ezra scoffed.  “What are you on about now, goy?” asked Ezra, dismissively.  
“You did!  Someone tried to hit me with their car, and I know for a fact I saw your face through the window!” I said, raising my voice, getting more and more afraid and upset with each statement.

“Oh REALLY, now?  And when EXACTLY was this?”  He said, condescendingly, as if he really did think I was some kind of insane person who couldn’t be trusted to know about the real world even if hit me upside the head.

“Friday night.  I was driving back home in my parents’ truck when you came along, and nearly had a head-on collision with me.” I said, confident in my version of events.

“Excuse me, what was that, goy?” he asked.  He then started fidgeting around in his pocket.  For a moment, I thought that’d be the end of me.  I thought he must’ve been feeling around for a knife.  Hell, maybe even a gun.  But he took his hand out, without any weapon.  I took a mental sigh of relief.

“Friday night.  I was driving home in my mom and dad’s truck.  Right when I was about to turn into my driveway, you showed up and nearly rammed right into me.  You even turned toward my car so you could hit it better.” I repeated.  Ezra fidgeted in his pocket some more.  This time he did pull something out.  But it wasn’t a knife or a gun or any sort of weapon.  Or at least, not the sort of weapon that could do direct physical damage.

“Thanks, goy.” He said with a particularly vicious smile, even for his standards, as he promptly pulled out his cellphone and let me hear the audio-recording he had just made of everything to do with how I had taken my parents’ truck out for the night.  It might have just been easier if it really had been a gun.  At least then, my death would be quick and relatively painless.  But I guess a death like that would’ve been too nice for Ezra’s liking.  He had to be as cruel as possible to me.  He had to make sure I died in the slow and brutal sort of way that my dad was bound to subject me to, once he got a load of that.  Maybe I really would come to wish his car had killed me, after all.

“No.  No way.  You are not seriously about snitch on me.” I pleaded with him.

“What, this?  No one’s gonna hear a goddamn word.  As long as YOU don’t say a goddamn word about how I apparently tried to ‘kill’ you or whatever with my car.”  He said coldly.   “I honestly don’t wanna have to use this shit.  Sneakin’ your folks’ truck for a little midnight joyride?  That’s pretty fuckin’ based.  Y’know maybe you’re more respectable than I give you credit for, after all, goy.”  He continued.  

“But if you get me a life sentence over something I had absolutely FUCK ALL to do with?  You’re fuckin’ dead.  ‘Cause if you tell people about this, they’ll believe you.  Everyone.  No one puts anything past me.  You could tell them I was responsible for the fuckin’ Rwandan genocide, and most people would assume it was true.  Not that I mind.  I LOVE that they would assume it of me.  'Cuz y'know what?  I honestly WANT people living in that kind of fear of me.  Just like you do.  But if you get me in trouble, REAL trouble, over something I didn’t even do?  I will not hesitate, for one goddamn moment, to become the batshit insane serial killer everyone expects me to be.  That I make damn sure everyone expects me to be.  Got it, goy?”  He said, clearly trying to sound as intimidating as possible.  

The good thing with Ezra, though, was that he was never the kinda guy you could ever really take seriously.  Even when he wanted you to.  The harder he would try to come off as psycho and edgy, the more he would always make himself look like a total joke.  So that, at least, went a pretty decent way to lighten the mood.

“I mean what the fuck’s next?” he continued.  “You gonna say I broke into your house and threated you at gunpoint?” He asked.

“But you DID break into my house.  I saw you, right there, in my room.  You were talking about how I would come to wish you really HAD killed me with your car.  And then, instead of just leaving out the front door like a normal human being, you jumped out of my window from the second floor, God only knows why.” I finished.

“If I had jumped out of a second-story window I’m pretty sure I would’ve broken my legs,” he said, as if he was explaining to a 5-year-old basic things like how the microwave works or something.  “Now.  Do I look like I’m in a wheelchair, goy?  Ya seein’ any crutches?  Any bandages even?” He said, as though I should’ve clearly known, based on his arguments, that everything I was saying was obviously bullshit.

“Well… no.” I conceded, a bit weakly.

“So isn’t it probably more likely that you’re just fucking delusional and none of that shit with me breaking into your bedroom ever fucking happened?” He asked, very pleased with how insecure and defensive I was becoming.

“Well, I guess… but—” I started.

“But I wonder what else might’ve all been bullshit too?  I mean.  Given how fucking crazy you obviously are and everything,” Ezra said, savagely.

“Fine.  I guess you’re right.  I mean, jumping out of my bedroom window would’ve probably gotten you an ER visit.  And you look fine.  I guess I am crazy.” I finally admitted, somewhat sarcastically, though somewhat defeatedly at the same time.

“There ya go, goy.  Now you’re talkin’ sense,” he said.  “I never hit you with my car and I never broke into your house.  Y’know why?  Because I was never even in town on Friday Night.  I’ve been down in Anchorage all weekend with Isaiah’s folks, right up until last night.  We didn’t even get home till 6 AM.  Eleazar’s gotten himself pneumonia again”, said Ezra as if his grandfather Eleazar had done it to himself.  “Not that I’m complaining.  We left Thursday afternoon, so I got Friday off.  Woulda skipped class anyway.  But now I don’t even have to worry about a detention,” he bragged.  “Doncha see, goy?  I wasn’t even PHYSCALLY PRESENT to do literally ANY of the shit to you that you’re saying I did,” he claimed.  Though even then, I still wasn’t gonna buy it.

“If you were really gone all weekend with your parents, wouldn’t they defend you in court against any attempted murder accusations?  Wouldn’t they testify that you were with them the whole time and that you couldn’t possible have done anything?” I questioned, still grasping for some kind of confession out of him.

“Oh yeah, they could.  But they wouldn’t bother.  The only reason they don’t kick me outta the house is because I haven’t turned 18 yet.  But come this September, I will be.  I’ll be outta their hair and they’ll be outta mine.  Having me tried for murder just gets the ball rollin’ even earlier.  Hell, I bet they’d forge evidence against me just to move the trial along and get ridda me even faster,” he explained.  “Ya done askin’ stupid fuckin’ questions, goy?  Good.  Now do me a favor and fuck off,” he finished.

So that’s what I did.  I walked and loitered around, listening to various conversations from the adults around me.  I heard Ezra’s parents.  Sure enough, there Naomi was, Ezra’s mother, talking someone’s ear off about how they had just come home from Anchorage, taking care of her father-in-law, Eleazar, with pneumonia.  How they had arrived back in Fairbanks just that morning and had to sleep in the car.  So that was it: he really had been out of town all weekend.  


I just couldn’t fit together everything I had seen.  I knew I had seen Ezra jump out of my window.   And yet, I also knew I had seen him at church, in perfectly good health.  No cast, no crutches, nothing.  How could I be so convinced that I had seen such obviously contradictory things?  As afraid as I was of his recording, as long as I didn’t say anything about what had happened, or rather, what I had THOUGHT had happened with Ezra the previous Friday Night, I should still be all good.  

Don’t get me wrong:  Ezra’s not exactly the most trustworthy guy.  But still, I’ve never known him to snitch on anybody unless he had a serious bone to pick.  After all, it takes a lot to get Ezra of all people to suck up to authority figures.  Ya don’t exactly tend to see that.  So, if I just stayed on his good side and kept quiet, maybe I really would be okay.

As I went to sleep that night, I tried to tell myself that Ezra was right:  I really was crazy.  Nothing I had seen involving him Friday night had been real.  His good health and functioning legs were obviously proof enough that he had never seriously jumped out of my window.  And then there was his mother talking about how they had been out of town all weekend, backing up his story of how he'd been away all weekend up till then.  It didn’t make sense for her to be going along with one of Ezra’s made-up stories.

And, most importantly of all, I hadn’t ran into him unexpectedly at all the previous night.  If that had really been him, it would only make sense for him to make an unexplained appearance yet again, just to make the fear factor hit even more close to home.  Yeah, I know, obviously I had experienced a whole bunch of irrational, supernatural shit up to this point that all managed to somehow be completely and utterly real.  But still.  None of that could explain this, I figured.

When nightfall came, I thought about the checklist Anastasia had given me the previous night about what to do every night before bed to help me sleep.  I wasn’t completely sure how she would know that I was following her sleep regimen, but since she managed to find out that I had gotten lost Friday night without me having ever told her, I figured she must’ve been telling the truth about how she had her ways.  

Sleep Points must somehow give you the ability to learn intimate details about other people’s personal lives.  Plus, her comment about how obvious it was that I wasn’t keeping up my hygiene still stung pretty badly.  So, sure enough, when 8 o’clock rolled around, I didn’t look at my phone once for the rest of the night.  I hopped in the shower, brushed my teeth, even looked through my bathroom cabinet for some floss and got started on that too.  By 9 o’clock, I was in bed, just as she told me to be.  I tried going to sleep with my blankets over my head.
