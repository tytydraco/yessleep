Being an artist is a difficult journey in a world filled with them. Everyone is an artist in their own way. Writers translate the visceral emotions of people and concepts into meager language. A primitive tool that could never capture true feelings, yet they strive and reach closer every day. Architects design beautiful and logical cities. Complicated designs worth every penny. Construction workers break their bodies to develop those cities and do it so efficiently it can be finished in just days. 

Artistry stems from a flow state. The state of being withdrawn from the outside world and the only thing inside is the work to be done. You feel every word, you picture every design, you hammer every nail, all the while your mind is empty. It flows from you into the world as the ultimate form of expression. Straight from the soul.

So, when everyone is an artist, the field becomes impacted by the weight of society. For every businessman there are twenty or more musicians. I am one of the lucky few to have been granted the right by the public to ascertain a career of it. It wasn’t all merit, I admit. Connections are very important in NYC. But, everyone I play for only has the highest praises for me. 

With my newfound fortune from playing the piano and selling out shows, I bought myself a personal one and it came with a beautiful apartment at the top of a building in the heart of artistry, here in NY. I have never seen anything like it. A gorgeous and well tuned, well taken- care-of machine ready to go at the drop of a hat included with my own place to call home. It was a miracle, something given by the universe itself to congratulate me in my life’s work. The artist of the strings pulling together our universe themself have beckoned me to live here. 

A panoramic view of gray monoliths stretching out, lighting up a dark sky with their vibrant life and no sound to accompany it. A marble open floor plan with plenty of space to accommodate at least four people comfortably. My new home.

There is a problem with my god given gift though. There are bugs in my walls. 

I don’t know the kind, but they act strange. They are alive in ways that make me think they’re conscious. I only started suspecting them a month after moving in, when I began to hear scratching following me into every room I entered. I thought there may have been a structural problem, but the builders I called to inspect my apartment didn’t find any large scale issues with the integrity of it. Just some missing caulk here, a pipe needing to be replaced there. 

The scratching continued. It would follow me into the bedroom and slowly pulsate in waves of stress that made it impossible to sleep. One time when I woke up from a feverish dream, I stared at the ceiling and I swear I saw it bulge and bend. Like a baby turning over in his mothers womb. It would tick and turn like a metronome, slow and methodical, until I drifted away. 

I couldn’t stand being in the apartment anymore and so I called pest control to help me. The noises were driving me mad. They looked through every nook and cranny, but didn’t find evidence of creatures living in my walls. 

“Probably the wind,” the exterminator said.

I admit I yelled at the man and forced him out of my house.

“How could the wind bend my walls? How could it scratch all night and know where I’m at?” I said.

The man shrugged and said something about sounding like a personal problem. Sounded like I needed to see a doctor. But, I am not crazy. I know crazy as it has been bred into family members I grew up with who had had to get institutionalized. I know the signs and I know what is real. 

I was defeated that night. Slowly drinking myself into a stupor, I opened up the grand piano for the first time and played something inspired by my world.

The moon bore a full face, scowling down at all of humanity below me. It had no one to accompany it that night, as all its younger brothers and sisters had been wiped out by the artificial light of the people. Light that killed all of the moon’s family. Our scourge on the sky. It bore a face of sadness, of regret. Thinking of all of his lost family, I played something to accompany his grief. His loneliness. His sadness. The great sonata dedicated to him by Beethoven. 

Every note rang true through my hands and body. The vibrations added warmth to the air and melancholy miasma spread in a gaseous form through every crack in the doors and filled the hallways with blue notes of ancient sadness. The moon lowered in the sky in appreciation, getting closer to hear better. 

In my flow, I thought of a man I met years ago. Before I was ever famous and before anyone but my mother and father heard my songs. We were at a bar, listening to some slow blues of a local band. 

“Have you ever thought of being an artist?” The man said. 

I turned in my stool and looked at him in confusion, as I never met him before. He had striking red and curly hair. Skin like porcelain and aquamarine pools sitting in sharp but sad eyes. Eyes that told a story of certain betrayal that intrigued me enough to entertain him. 

I shifted my body uncomfortably, but his energy gave off a welcoming and loving presence. Something about him made me want to tell him the truth. “It’s all I ever dreamed of.”

He smiled a wide grin that filled me with warmth. 

I remember that night as if it were etched in time, every word a part of a dance between fate and desire. I leaned forward slightly, my eyes locked onto his, as if daring the secret inside me to reveal itself.

“You see,” I began hesitantly, feeling both compelled and terrified by the pull of his oceanic gaze, “I’ve always believed that art was a born gift. A fire waiting to spark.”

His smile grew, slow and knowing. “Do you think that spark is something… given by inheritance, or something beyond comprehension? Something otherworldly.” He asked, his voice a gentle purr that seemed to echo off the smoky walls. The soulful notes from the blues band draped around us like an intimate shroud.

I laughed nervously, unsure if I was prepared for what lay beneath his words. “Are you suggesting some kind of… magic?”

“Not magic, per se,” he replied, leaning closer so that the light caught the glint of something unspoken in his aquamarine eyes. He took a sip of his drink. “A pact, perhaps. A covenant that can turn a whisper of talent into a roaring blaze. Something you promise to yourself. But as with the laws of nature every light casts a shadow. A price paid for every good deed or wish granted.”

The chill in his tone sent shivers down my spine. My heart hammered with the anticipation of both hope and dread. “And what price would that be?” I asked softly, every instinct screaming that the answer might shatter my dreams.

His eyes darkened for a moment, sorrow mingling with mischief. “Let's make up a hypothetical. Say I were to give you your dreams, but you must be cursed. Like a shadow, in the direct magnitude of your wish.”

I felt the weight of his words deep within me. Like a promise too tantalizing.. “So, if I accept your… offer, I’ll become renowned, destined to have all I ever dreamed of?” I murmured, unable to tear my gaze away.

He chuckled, a sound both musical and menacing, as he brushed a stray curl away from his ghostly face. “Renowned, yes. But also entwined with the very darkness that feeds on brilliance.”

I felt a moment of uncertain clarity. The allure of a destiny fulfilled, the image of my songs reaching countless souls. It was impossible to ignore. Yet in the depths of his eyes, I sensed the truth: nothing in this world came without consequence.

After a long silent beat that seemed to stretch into eternity, I whispered, “I understand,” and closed my tab.

A slow smirk crept across his lips, as if both victory and melancholy graced his handsome features.

While adventuring through my mind palace with the sweet notes of moonlight sonata, I noticed a strange reverberance that shouldn’t have been there. It was a slow scratching. I slowed my pace. It turned to a beat inside the wall. A thump. Like a heartbeat that followed the rhythm of the music.

I slammed my hands on the keys. “You bastard! You’re fucking with me!”

Then, I hatched a plot. 

I scooted away from my seat, and gently placed a record on my turntable. It started toward the middle of an interpretation of caprice no. 13, transitioning into variations op. 15. I turned the volume up and the speakers filled every room with noise, then followed the beating and scratching in the walls.

The scratching had gotten worse.

It wasn’t just at night anymore. It whispered through the drywall in the middle of the day like a thousand dry legs tapping in rhythm. Sometimes it hummed, low and wet like breath rattling in a diseased throat. My fame had soared, but with it came the sound, and now it owned me.

I stood in front of the wall where the sound pulsed loudest, chest heaving, fingertips twitching. I had tried everything. Ignoring it, drowning it out, even sleeping in hotels. But it always found me. Always.

The wall was cold and stark white, but the area where the scratching was happening had veins of mold creeping like rot through the seams of drywall. I pressed my ear to it. The sound stopped. Then, clear as anything, I heard it.

"*Play for us*."

I snapped.

With a strangled grunt, I drove the claw end of a hammer into the drywall. Plaster exploded like bone dust. A hollow groan escaped the wall, and something beneath the surface shuddered. I didn’t care. I kept going.

Each strike sent shocks up my arm. My knuckles split open as I ripped away chunks with my bare hands. Blood smeared across the wall like paint. The deeper I went, the warmer it got. The space behind the drywall wasn’t empty. It breathed. It exhaled a thick, sticky heat that smelled of old blood and wilted flowers left too long in stagnant water.

Behind the drywall, I found something fleshy. Not wood. Not insulation. Flesh*.*

I stared, breath catching in my throat.

Veins, black and pulsing, ran in lattices across a pinkish membrane. It twitched when I touched it. My fingers sunk slightly into it like wet dough. Beneath my skin, I felt the vibration. Like a thousand whispers trapped in a closed mouth, begging to be heard.

I tore at it.

My nails bent back as I clawed through the pulsing meat. It screamed. Not in sound, but in my skull. Sharp, shrill frequencies stabbed my mind as hot, translucent fluid spilled down my arms. It smelled like vinegar and spoiled milk.

Behind the membrane was a hollow, round chamber. Nestled inside, alive and writhing, was a mass of black, silky threads that moved like hair in water. They twined around tiny mouths, blinking eyes, fragments of instruments, torn pages of scores. My scores. My handwriting. They were feeding on them.

On me.

I fell backward, sobbing, slick with gore as the threads reached outward toward the moonlight.

And in my mind, I heard him again.

“... entwined with the very darkness that feeds on brilliance.”

I am shuttered in my room and haven’t left for days. I don’t want to see the thing in my walls anymore, peering out at me with sickly flesh. The scratching is getting louder, and it’s whispering to me. Begging me to play music.
