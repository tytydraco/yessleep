TW: animal mutilation,violence (continue at your own risk) 

It was a very hot summer. I decided to work on my vacations since I needed the money to pay my rent. I had been working here for five years now but what happened to me that summer would never be erased from my mind. 


I arrived at the building like always,my coworker quickly recieved me asking if I could cover the afternoon and night shift. I needed the money so I didn't refuse. 

So I went in and started my work, fed the canines and checked if I had to receive any customers at check-in or check-out. I noticed that there was a check-in marked as an emergency at six pm. 


I want to clarify that when a client requests a reservation, they must show the dog's vaccinations, information and a photo of their pet. But when I looked for all this in the chat where the reservation was made I couldn't find anything. 

It seemed strange to me since our boss was very strict about those things. I assumed that perhaps, being an emergency reservation, he was admitted without being asked for anything. 


I finished what I had left and prepared the area for the pet to receive it quickly. To be honest I didn't like night shifts because there was a very strange vibe there, but I really needed the money. And so I decided to ignore it, although on that specific night my guts alarmed me that something would go wrong. 


Finally the client arrived, I went outside to receive him but I was left in a state of surprise to see that this subject was covered from head to toe in dark clothes. It wasn't that cold so it seemed very strange to me, making me almost retract the idea of ​​going out. But thinking about my debts and my needs made me do it. 


I approached him with a smile but I received no response, not even a sigh in return. He just handed me the dog which looked in a bit of a miserable state. He looked like he hadn't eaten in days. 


He gave me the pet's stuff and just walked away finally saying "good luck". I didn't understand what he meant, I thought maybe the dog's behavior wasn't the best but anyway, this whole situation started to get a little weirder every time. 


I entered the building and took the dog to his area where he would rest. I put food and water in case he needed it and went back to my desk. As it was closing time, the hard work had finished. I only had to dedicate myself to ensuring the safety of the pets. 


After a while the clock struck 3 am. The truth was that I was very tired and my eyes were already closing by themselves. but I did my best not to fall asleep on top of the desk and decided to take a walk through the dog rooms to stay awake.


 I stopped immediatly when I saw that the dog room that I received recently is completely open. I went into a state of panic and started looking everywhere for the dog. There was no way for him to escape outside, but he could harm other dogs or even eat the food that was storaged for the others. 


So I kept looking for it but, hell, I didn't even know the name of this animal so I could call him. I began to associate the last words that its owner said to me with what was happening, but what awaited me would be even more unpleasant and horrifying than I thought. 


I began to hear another dog whining and when I entered I was petrified. This dog was eating the other dog that was in that room. Literally large bites that tore at his skin as if it were a steak. I started screaming while trying to get this dog off the other one in the hopes that he was still alive.  


But this disgusting dog had hurt the other too much to do anything,his organs where tore apart,his bones where showing,it was gone. 


Suddenly he turns to me with a look that is somehow human and at the same time wild, something that raised the hair on the nape of my neck because I knew I was next.

He rushed straight towards me pretending to bite me. I somehow managed to grab him by the neck although I received a deep bite that made me tremble anyway.


 I fought him while I took him outside and threw him out of the building.I could swear that I heard this dog whisper something while he was looking at me furiously as if he understood what I had just done. 

I yelled at him to go to hell while I was looking for a weapon to defend myself with. But it was not necessary since this hellhound quickly left inside the forest that we had in front of the building.

 I tried to call my boss but I knew that he would not answer me because it was already too late and I knew that if I called the police they would not believe me. 

So I decided to watch the video from the cameras from outside and be able to hear if this dog had really whispered, but to my surprise in the footage I only saw myself fighting with nothing.

The only proof of what had happened was my bite that did not stop dripping blood on my arm and the dog bitten to death.

 I didn't know how I would explain to the owners and my boss what happened.
But the next morning when I tried to tell my boss every detail, he just interrupted me asking me what the owner of the mysterious dog looked like. 

When I explained to him every detail of his appareance I could see how his face changed to an expression of anguish and fear. He knew something but he never said anything. 


Then he told me not to tell anyone else what had happened that night and that he would find an excuse for the dead dog. 

Which he did. He disposed of the body and told the owners that the puppy had escaped when they had taken him out to play, which caused many problems for the local almost making them close. 

After that I decided to quit withouth caring and move far away. I decided to tell what happened to me because I want an explanation of what happened that night, what was that thing,that man.


 And because the truth is, sometimes at night I feel his presence getting closer but maybe is just my imagination,a response for my trauma.
