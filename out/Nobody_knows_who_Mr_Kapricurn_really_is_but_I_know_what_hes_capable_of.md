It started the way it always does. A dream. A struggle. And a man who promises to make it all come true. My dream was music, and my struggle was everything else. My days were a cycle of coffee and frustration, busking in busy plazas where nobody stopped to listen, and playing open mics where the applause was as thin as my wallet. I wrote simple songs, earnest lyrics, plain melodies; nothing stuck. Every time I uploaded a track online, it sank into the void.

Then, on an unremarkable Wednesday evening, everything changed.

I was at a dimly lit bar, strumming my guitar for a handful of patrons who just didn’t care. As I sang the final verse, I spotted him in the back corner. He wasn’t drinking. He wasn’t scrolling through his phone. He just watched, his pale eyes locked onto me like I was the only thing in the room.

After my set, he approached me. His voice was smooth, low, and deliberate, every word soaked in control.

"You have a gift," he said. "But a gift is wasted without someone to help you share it."

I blinked, unsure if he was mocking me. "Thanks, I guess."

"No guessing," he said, handing me a card. His name gleamed in gold letters "Mr. Karpicurn" and below it was a single phone number. No email, no title, no company name. "Call me when you’re ready to make your mark."

He walked away before I could respond. The scent of him lingered, a faint scent of cigarrettes and fancy perfumes, and for days, I couldn’t shake it.

I almost threw the card away. If this was the unprobable event he actually was an executive and could give me a fast rise to the top, I wouldn't take it since I wanted to believe I could make it on my own. But every rejection email, every blank audience, every skipped meal chipped away at my pride until eventually, I called.

The meeting took place in his office, a sleek fortress of glass and shadow perched above the city. The desk was bare except for a single sheet of paper and a pen. The contract was unnervingly simple. It said one thing: deliver the music, and the world will listen. I stared at the blank spaces waiting for my name and signature.

"What’s the catch?" I asked.

"No catch," he said, smiling faintly. "Only consequences."

His words rattled in my head, but the promise of success drowned them out. I signed.

In the beginning, it was everything I’d dreamed of. My songs, once ignored by the uninterested audiences of low end bars, now swept across streaming platforms like wildfire. A producer reached out to collaborate, a hitmaker whose name alone could launch careers. Within months, I was headlining shows. My lyrics were being sung back to me by audiences so massive they looked like oceans of light. The world knew my name and I loved it... for a while.

The first crack in the dream came quietly as the exhaustion didn’t hit all at once; it crept in, slowly and insidiously, like a fog rolling in until I couldn’t see where I had started or where I was going. The first few months were euphoric. My songs were everywhere. I was everywhere. People stopped me on the streets, at airports, in coffee shops. "I love your music," they’d say, and for a while, that was enough.

But as the months bled into each other, something shifted. The songs they wanted weren’t the ones I wanted to write. The raw, personal lyrics that came from nights spent in my cramped apartment, guitar in hand, were now stripped bare in boardrooms. Committees of producers and executives chipped away at them, turning my stories into something sanitized, marketable. My melodies were drowned in layers of auto-tuned choruses and synthetic beats, until they no longer sounded like me.

"You’re an artist," they’d say. "But this is a business. It’s not just about the music, it’s about the brand."

At first, I fought it. I argued over lyrics, over arrangements, over my image. But every battle I won felt like a hollow victory, and every battle I lost carved a piece of myself away. "Trust the process," they’d tell me. "This is how you make it to the top." And I wanted to believe them, because the alternative was admitting I’d traded my soul for a dream that wasn’t even mine anymore.

The burn-out wasn’t immediate, either. It built like a slow crescendo. Early on, I didn’t mind the studio sessions that stretched into the early hours of the morning. The adrenaline of creating something new kept me going. But the adrenaline faded, replaced by deadlines and the constant demand for more. More singles, more press, more appearances. It felt like I was running on a treadmill that sped up every time I thought I might catch my breath.

Sleep became a luxury I couldn’t afford. Studio sessions bled into photoshoots, which bled into interviews, which bled into rehearsals. My schedule was packed tighter than the arenas I was starting to fill. The people around me noticed. My manager, my assistants, they started slipping me little things. "Take this," they’d say, holding out a pill. "It’ll help you focus." Or, "This will take the edge off." I’d resisted at first. I didn’t like the idea of needing something to keep going. But the longer the days became, the easier it was to give in.

The pills became part of my routine. One to wake up. One to stay awake. One to bring me down after a high-energy performance. They called it “balancing the scales,” but I didn’t feel balanced. I felt numb. The highs weren’t as high anymore, but the lows were deeper, darker.

The worst part was the mirror. I’d catch my reflection in backstage dressing rooms or bathroom breaks during endless flights, and I’d stare at the man looking back. He was gaunt, his eyes sunken, his skin pale under layers of expensive makeup. There were dark circles under his eyes, no matter how many professionals tried to conceal them. He looked... wrong.

But what hurt the most was the emptiness in his eyes. When I first started, my eyes burned with passion. I’d see videos of my old self, singing to tiny crowds in dive bars, and my gaze was so alive, so hungry. I missed that hunger, because now I couldn’t feel anything at all. I’d tell myself I was doing this for the art, but deep down, I knew my art wasn’t mine anymore. I wasn’t writing songs, I was writing ads disguised as songs. The lyrics weren’t stories; they were slogans.

To cope, I leaned harder into the distractions fame provided. The parties were endless, every room filled with people who wanted something from me. I wasn’t lonely, how could I be when I was always surrounded by so many people? but I felt alone. So I drank. I smoked. I let the music at the clubs drown out my own thoughts. The bad habits felt like a salve at first, but they only left me feeling more hollow.

I told myself it was all worth it. After all, the fame I’d always wanted was mine. People were singing my songs, screaming my name, streaming my albums. But in the quiet moments, when the noise died down and I was left alone in some five-star hotel room, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d traded something irreplaceable for all of it. I couldn’t remember the last time I wrote a song just for me.

And that thought, the idea that my music was no longer my own, burned more than anything else.

On a particularly eventful day I walked into an art store, hoping to find something to get myself, maybe buy something to look at that wasn't the face of that disgusting man in the mirror and my walls. A woman, maybe in her mid 20's, was standing by a shelf of paints, her clothes splattered with crimson and black, her hair falling in uneven strands around her face. She looked exhausted, her eyes hollow, like she hadn’t slept in weeks.

"Hey," I said, looking at the unfinished art pieces. "Are these any good?"

She barely glanced at me. "Depends. Are you an artist?"

"Not really. Music’s more my thing."

"Lucky you," she muttered, her voice bitter. "At least people pay attention to that."

Her words hit me harder than I expected. "You okay?"

"Do I look okay?" she snapped, then sighed, running a hand through her hair. "Sorry. That was... uncalled for."

"No worries," I said, stepping back. "Rough day?"

"Rough life," she corrected. She hesitated, then added, "I’m working on a commission, it's almost done though"

I looked at the completely blank canvas she was pretending to stroke with the brush on her hand. "Who’s it for?"

Her eyes narrowed, and for a moment, I thought she might yell at me. But instead, she shook her head. "Nobody you’d want to meet."

As she walked away, I couldn’t shake the chill her words left behind. I didn’t know her, but something about her felt too familiar. Like a shadow I’d seen before.

The weeks that followed were chaos. Scandals erupted out of nowhere, paparazzi caught me stumbling drunk outside clubs I didn’t even remember entering. Rumors spread online about my ego, my temper. The fans who once adored me started to turn, whispering that I’d sold out.

Mr. Karpicurn was never far, always appearing when the cracks in my life were widest. "This is what you wanted," he’d remind me, his voice silk and smoke. "The world knows your name. Isn’t that enough?"

It wasn’t. The fame that had once burned so brightly now felt like fire in my veins, consuming everything I was. My friends were gone. My family didn’t recognize me. My music, my one salvation, was no longer mine.

I finally reached my breaking point backstage at a sold-out show. The roar of the crowd vibrated through the walls, muffled but insistent, like it was calling for a version of me I didn’t even recognize anymore. I stood in front of the vanity mirror, my chest heaving, sweat dripping from my temples. The lights above the mirror buzzed faintly, casting a sickly yellow glow over that face. And that face... it wasn’t mine. Not anymore.

The man in the mirror looked gaunt, hollowed out, as though someone had scooped out his insides and left only the shell. His cheekbones jutted out unnaturally, the skin stretched so tight it seemed ready to tear. His eyes were sunken deep into their sockets, ringed by bruised shadows that looked almost black, as if he hadn’t slept in weeks or years. His pupils were blown wide, drowning out the natural color of his irises, leaving only a faint ring of gray around endless darkness. The whites of his eyes were bloodshot, webbed with angry red veins that pulsed with every beat of his heart.

His skin had a strange, almost translucent quality to it. It was pale, but not in the way of someone who’d simply spent too much time indoors. It was sickly, waxy, like old candle wax left too close to the flame. Tiny cracks formed at the corners of his mouth, dried blood crusting over as if he’d been biting his lips raw. His teeth... when had they started to yellow? And his hands, gripping the edge of the vanity, were veiny and claw-like, the knuckles raw and swollen from endless fights with walls, doors, and anyone who dared to challenge him.

But it was the expression that truly made me recoil. The man in the mirror wasn’t angry or sad or scared. He was... blank. Emotionless. His face sagged under the weight of its own exhaustion, his jaw slack, his shoulders hunched forward. He looked like he’d been hollowed out and worn down by something far more powerful than any human should face.

Then there were the eyes. They weren’t just tired; they were hungry. Desperate. They stared back at me with an emptiness so profound it made my stomach churn. I felt like I was looking at something that wasn’t quite alive, like something that had crawled out of the depths of the earth wearing my skin as a costume.

My phone buzzed on the counter. I ignored it at first, my eyes locked on the stranger in the mirror. But it buzzed again, insistent, dragging me back to reality. I grabbed it with a trembling hand, swiping to open the notification.

There it was, plastered across every major social media platform: *\[MY NAME\] Refuses to Pay Crew Members, Accused of Exploitation.* My heart sank as I scrolled through the post. Photos of me in designer clothes, grinning on red carpets, contrasted with testimonials from stagehands and backup musicians, people who claimed I hadn’t paid them for weeks of grueling work. "He’s rolling in cash while we’re barely scraping by," one person had said. Another claimed I’d screamed at them during rehearsal, calling them "replaceable."

I wanted to scream, to throw my phone across the room, but what gutted me was the fact that I didn’t even know if it was true. I’d lost track of the numbers, the contracts, the faces of the people who worked behind the scenes to keep this machine running. Maybe I hadn’t paid them. Maybe I had said those things. And even if I hadn’t, what did it matter? My name was already tied to the scandal, and in the court of public opinion, I was guilty.

The buzzing in my ears grew louder. The reflection in the mirror twisted and warped, the man’s mouth curling into a cruel, mocking smile. My chest tightened as I slammed my fist into the glass, shattering it into jagged shards that rained down onto the counter and floor. Blood welled from the fresh cuts on my knuckles, but I didn’t feel the pain. I just stood there, staring at the fragmented pieces of the mirror, each one showing a distorted version of the monster I’d become.

"I can’t do this anymore," I whispered.

Mr. Karpicurn appeared right behind me, his smile as sharp as ever. "You’ve already done it. The deal is sealed."

"Then take it back," I begged. "Take the fame, the money. I don’t want it."

He tilted his head, his eyes glinting with amusement. "Fame is fire, my friend. It burns bright, but it consumes everything it touches. And you? You’re already ash."

As the words left his mouth, the air in the room seemed to grow heavy. The walls of the dressing room shimmered like heat waves rising from scorched asphalt. My knees buckled as a sudden, oppressive heat enveloped me, and I stumbled backward, clutching the edge of the counter for support.

The world around me dissolved, replaced by something… impossible. I was standing in a cavernous, hellish space, the ground beneath me cracked and glowing with molten veins of fire. The air was thick with the acrid scent of burning sulfur, and the flickering light cast eerie, dancing shadows that seemed alive. Towering columns of twisted, writhing shapes rose from the ground, and I realized with horror that they were made of people... people like me.

To my left, a woman stood at an easel, her body skeletal and trembling. It was the woman from the art store, her paint-streaked hands moving mechanically, as though guided by some unseen force. Her canvas was impossibly large, stretching endlessly into the distance, and every stroke she made seemed to bleed, the colors alive with an otherworldly glow. She turned to glance at me, her hollow eyes locking with mine for a split second. She didn’t speak, but the pain etched into her face said everything. She was trapped, cursed to paint forever, her art consuming her piece by piece.

To my right, a guy who I assumed to be an engineer crouched over a set of plans laid out on a fiery stone slab. His hands moved frantically, assembling intricate blueprints that burst into flames as soon as he finished. He screamed, his voice echoing through the cavern, but he never stopped working. It was as if the plans were all that existed for him, an endless cycle of creation and destruction.

Behind him, a chef stood over a grotesque banquet table, chopping and cooking with feverish intensity. His knives moved faster than seemed humanly possible, slicing through meat that writhed and screamed as if it were alive. The dishes he plated shimmered with a sickly, tempting beauty, but as soon as they were placed on the table, they disintegrated into ash. His face was pale, streaked with sweat and soot, and he muttered recipes under his breath like prayers, his hands shaking as he continued his work.

In the distance, I spotted a magician on a raised platform, performing for an invisible crowd. He pulled endless chains of fire from his sleeves, conjured shimmering illusions that flickered and warped into grotesque parodies of beauty. His face was painted in a frozen smile, but his eyes, those eyes were full of despair. Every trick seemed to siphon something from him, leaving him gaunter, weaker, and more lifeless with each act.

I turned back to Mr. Karpicurn, who now stood at the center of this infernal gallery, his sharp suit unblemished by the ash and heat around him. His presence was commanding, untouched, as though this hell was his domain and he thrived in it. He smiled, but it wasn’t reassuring, it was the smile of a predator ready to attack its next meal.

"This is what you wanted," he said, his voice smooth, echoing with an unnatural depth that seemed to shake the ground beneath me. "You’re not the first, and you won’t be the last. I make dreams come true, my friend. But dreaming has consequences".

I wanted to scream, to run, to claw my way out of whatever nightmare this was, but my feet wouldn’t move. The heat pressed down on me, suffocating, and the vision began to pull me in. I saw flashes of the life I’d had, of the life I’d wanted. My face plastered on billboards, my songs being sung by millions, the applause, the money, the fame. But those images twisted and warped into something else... tabloid scandals, broken friendships, isolation, and a hollow, endless hunger for more.

"You’ve all made the same mistake," Mr. Karpicurn continued, gesturing to the suffering souls around us. "You all thought you could have it all without giving something in return. But don’t you see? Your dream was never yours to begin with. It was mine."

I forced my head to turn back toward the painter. Her hand froze mid-stroke for just a moment, and she looked at me with something I couldn’t quite place... pity, maybe, or warning. The light of her canvas reflected in her hollowed cheeks, her hands trembling as she turned back to the impossible task before her. The others worked in unison, their faces varying shades of despair and madness, all trapped in an endless pursuit of their art, their passions turned into their punishments.

I opened my mouth to speak, to beg for release, but Mr. Karpicurn raised a finger to his lips. "Shh," he said, his smile widening. "You’re exactly where you’re meant to be. Every moment, you knew it wasn’t earned. It was gifted. And now, the time has come to give it all back."

"No," I whispered, falling to my knees. "Please. I’ll do anything. More music. More years. Anything but this!"

He crouched in front of me, tilting his head like a predator toying with prey. "Anything, you say?"

I nodded frantically, tears spilling down my cheeks. I thought I saw a flicker of pity in his eyes, but it vanished as quickly as it came.

"Very well," he said, his voice like silk dipped in venom. "If you wish to delay your descent, then so be it. But know this: your suffering will not be avoided. It will only change its shape."

Before I could speak, the world around me shattered. The heat and people were gone, replaced by blinding lights and the roar of a crowd. My hands gripped the neck of my guitar, mid-strum. I was on stage again, bathed in the adoration of thousands. But something was wrong. Their cheers sounded wrong, their faces twisted into masks of something primal, something… hungry.

I tried to stop playing, but my hands refused to obey me. The strings burned against my fingers, but I couldn’t let go. My voice rose unbidden, belting out lyrics I didn’t recognize but somehow knew were mine. As the music swelled, I felt my body moving of its own accord. My feet dragged me to the edge of the stage. The crowd surged forward, hands outstretched. Their eyes were empty, their mouths open wide.

And then I saw it, the flames in their throats, the same fire I had seen in the pit. They weren’t fans anymore. They were my audience, my tormentors, and I was their eternal performance.

I tried to scream, but the sound that came out wasn’t mine. It was a laugh, deep and guttural, echoing in the space between my ears. The devil’s laugh.

The music wouldn’t stop. The crowd wouldn’t stop. And deep down, I knew the truth: this stage wasn’t a reprieve. It was my hell, and I would give them a show. 6 times a week, each lasting 6 hours spread across 6 days with a single day of "rest" that isn't really restful, filled instead with haunting planning of the next show.
