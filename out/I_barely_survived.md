The alarm woke me shortly after the sun set and I pushed away the sleeping bag that covered my body, cautiously sitting up, reaching for the light to my left side. I wrapped my fingers around it and found the switch with my thumb. The camper lit up and I squinted, reaching for the hard case that contained my glasses, wiping them clean with the cloth I kept inside the case as well. I opened the canopy over the bed of my battered old 1984 truck. I stretched toward the sky and then stretched my legs as well, before walking into the building that housed the toilets.

After relieving myself, I washed my hands and stepped back outside. I walked back to the truck and retrieved my pack of cigarettes and thc vaporizer, taking a few hits off of the electronic device before tucking that into the key pocket of my jeans. I lit one of the little tobacco sticks and then opened the driver's side door of the truck and slipped behind the wheel, placing the key in the ignition, waiting for my phone to connect with the newer radio before backing out of the spot and leaving the Rest Area, turning right onto the highway.

I continued on the lonely road into the mountains, both stubbing out the cigarette as I entered a series of tight curves that forced me to put both of my hands on the wheel. It took me another hour to reach a small town. I pulled onto the exit ramp, my stomach rumbling in protest to the fact I hadn't eaten anything since early afternoon the day before. I found a small restaurant with an equally tiny lot, though there were a few spots still open. I pulled into one of them and cut off the engine and stepped out of the old truck.

I entered the building and was quickly shown to a table, the young server leaving a menu with me before moving away only to return with a cup for coffee and a little wire basket with creamer and sweetener packets in it along with a small glass shaker filled with real sugar. He returned again, a coffee pot in one hand, filling the ceramic cup while I browsed the breakfast dishes. It didn't take very long for me to decide on one of their breakfast sandwiches. The food didn't last much longer than the decision process had.

I paid the bill and included a decent tip, making my way back out into the lot, taking a few moments to walk a few laps around the blacktop, stretching my back again as well, and once I had limbered up a little I got back into the truck and continued out onto the road again, heading Westward through the mountains toward the valley where I had been born. I had been traveling for months and was daydreaming of spending time in a comfortable bed instead of the thin foam rubber pad I was using as a mattress as I pressed the brake, approaching another series of curves.

My engine roared as I pressed the accelerator, urging the rusty old truck up an incline, lighting another cigarette, rolling down the window to let the smoke escape into the air outside. I drove until the sun began to set and as my eyes began to close of their own accord I cranked up the radio, keeping myself awake until I saw a billboard advertising a motel twenty miles away. I pushed the pedal toward the floorboard again and lit a cigarette. I had to slam on the brakes when a deer ran in front of me, my heart hammering in my chest as I swerved over the center line and back into my lane.

There was no impact, but the adrenaline dump was making my hands shake as I pulled to the side of the road. I didn't kill the engine but sat there until the trembling in my fingers eventually stopped. I started to pull back onto the road but waited as a log truck rolled by. I waited, allowing it to get a decent head start on me before I entered the curves behind it. The moon was barely visible through the clouds and the thick canopy only made it harder to see. I turned on the brights just in time to swerve again to avoid the jackknifed truck sitting sideways in the road.

The hazard lights were flashing and the little orange triangles were already out as well, the lights on the trailer and coming from the cab casting everything in a strange yellow hue as I pulled over once again, pressing the button that activated my own hazard lights, then shifted the old truck into park. I reached under the seat to grab the large, metal flashlight from underneath where it was strapped next to my first aid kit. I tested the heavy torch, flicking the switch forward, and the bulb came to bright life as I had expected.

I stepped out, glancing around, and straining to hear just in case the driver was hurt. Nothing but the sounds of insects and other forest animals filled my ears, the buzzing of wings and the chirruping song of crickets interlaced with the croaking of tree frogs and hooting of owls.

“Hello..?” I called out, sweeping my light over the asphalt, the glimmer of broken glass reflecting back to me.

The only response I got was the normal noises along with the quiet ticking of the truck behind me as the engine started to cool. I felt a moment of fear, but became convinced that the other driver was hurt, and couldn't answer, so I did the only thing I could think of. I approached the truck, halting when I saw the state of the driver's side door. The thing looked mangled as I moved my light over it, bent and dented, small punctures in the paint and metal. They looked almost like bullet holes but that made no sense. There hadn't been enough time, and besides, no small caliber firearm had left some of those dents.

I could smell something in the air. Familiar, but I couldn't place it until I saw the blood smeared and pooled in the seat, I realized what that was. Iron. I retched and stepped back, and for a moment the thought of getting the hell out of there crossed my mind, and in retrospect, I should have. Instead I moved around to the front of the tractor trailer where I saw more gore and clear impact damage. The grille of the semi truck was nearly concave. I swept the beam of my light back and forth across the wrecked vehicle.

The sound of a branch snapping behind me had me spinning around, heart leaping into my chest initially, breath freezing in my lungs. I felt a little silly when a buck poked its head out from behind the small shrub that still hid its body from my view. I began to relax, and the animal stepped out further, and I trained the flashlight on the chest of the creature. It looked to be smeared with mud or something. As the thing stepped forward again I realized exactly what it was. Blood. Fear returned in a big way as the thing approached more, clearly not spooked by me at all.

I started to backtrack, and the thing continued to approach me. I didn't want to turn my back but if I didn't, it was going to catch up to me for sure, or I was going to trip. I turned and began to run toward my truck, and thankfully made it before the buck behind me caught up, but not fast enough to get to me before I slammed the door. I was quickly shown how wrong I was even as the thought that I was safe began to form in my mind. The thing rammed the door hard, and it dented but didn't buckle. I started to turn the keys.

The thing that looked like a buck rammed those antlers into the tire which exploded with a loud pop. I wouldn't be going anywhere. The thing stared at me through the window of the truck after puncturing my tire, and I got the feeling it was taunting me. When it started ramming the door again, I regained the ability to move, and started scooting across the seat toward the passenger side of the truck. I mentally counted down from three to zero as I scooted toward my exit, clutching the flashlight in one hand and the handle to the door in the other.

I pushed. Hard, and hit the ground running. The thing let out a noise that sounded like a bellow mixed with a grunt, but not entirely animal. There was something wrong about the vocalization. I began to run, blindly at first, into the trees, briars and other thorny shrubs tearing at my clothes and bare arms. I didn't stop, hearing the heavy hoof beats of my pursuer. Every time I turned, it would move to one side or the other, as if it were herding me somewhere. As I ran, I tripped over something and sprawled to the ground.

I lost my grip on the flashlight and it swept around in a half-arc to shine behind me. I glanced toward what had entangled my ankle and caused me to fall. I wish I hadn't. I saw a disembodied arm, and roughly a quarter of a torso. Ragged clothing clung to the ragged flesh, dried blood darkening the edges of the fabric where it had been shredded at the same time. I let out a cry before I could restrain myself. It wasn't as if I had escaped. I could hear that thing getting closer even as I struggled to my feet.

Any head start I had gotten had been negated by the fall, and by the time I was running again, that buck, or whatever was chasing me was closing in with every step. I was wearing down,but that thing didn't seem to be getting tired at all. That thought was followed by the feeling of antlers jabbing painfully into my lower back, pushing me forward. I stumbled and tried to maintain my balance, and while I stumbled, the animal headbutted me again. This time when I sprawled out, the flashlight flew from my hand.

I rolled onto my back instinctively as the creature moved to stand over me, and in that moment, I did the only thing I could think of. I made a fist and swung upward, my knuckles finding nothing but open air as it ducked backward. Even though my attack failed, it gave me the opportunity to scramble backward again, away from the beast. Its jaws parted and it let out another bellow, this one sending a chill straight to my bones. I managed to get to my feet as it took a step back and scraped at the ground with one of its front hooves, and that sound seemed off somehow as well. Like bone on bone.

I backed away slowly, not turning my back on the ting as it advanced toward me. I wasn't going to escape this way, having to carefully measure each backward step, but at least I would be able to see if the thing prepared to attack me again. I still wasn't fast enough to dodge when it did charge, closing the distance and lowering its skull almost impossibly fast. I felt the sharp pain under my ribs before I registered what was happening, body losing purchase with the earth, arcing upward before landing in a thorny bush.

I didn't have time to feel the pain, forcing myself to move even though simply breathing was painful. A beam of light caught my eye from the periphery of my vision. My flashlight! I scrambled toward it just as the thing that looked like a deer charged me again, this time its jaw opened and clamped down around the lower part of my leg. I let out another scream as the pressure increased and I literally heard my shin bone crack in the thing's mouth. I screamed out again and barely managed not to pass out from the pain.

I kicked at the deer's skull, heel connecting solidly with the top of his head over and over again until it released my leg. I scrambled away, and started moving again, trying to push myself backward. My ribs were definitely cracked as well and I barely got myself free from the tangle of branches that ripped at my skin before the thing closed in on me once more. I kicked desperately with my good leg while using my arms to continue scooting backward.

“Leave me alone!” I yelled, knowing that it was pointless, and even speaking made pain flare through my torso.

“Hello!?” came an incredulous voice in the distance.

“Help!” I cried, just a moment before the deer-thing bit down on my already injured leg again.

This time its blunt teeth closed around my knee joint, but before it could do too much damage, I heard the sound of a gunshot. The bullet whizzed past the thing, but that was enough to cause it to halt its attack on me. A beam of light focused on the blood-soaked animal and there was another shot. It jerked to the side as the wet sound of the impact reached my ears, sending a spray of blood into the air that filled the area with a foul odor. The thing looked down at me, and then toward the direction the attack had come from seemingly barely effected by being shot.

My bleary eyes turned in that direction as well as the person with the rifle advanced. The creature gave a sickening bellow and then bounded off into the forest. The man with the light and firearm approached me, and I almost broke down in tears out of sheer relief. The man knelt next to me and tried to help me stand, but after a few moments, realized that wasn't going to work. He lifted me and carried me about fifty yards back toward the road, then set me down.

“I'll be right back. I don't think it followed us.” the older man said, then jogged down the slight slope and out of sight, his flashlight beam bobbing into nothingness.

I barely clung to consciousness long enough to hear the siren of an ambulance wailing in the near distance. I blacked out only to wake up a few minutes later when the stretcher was loaded into the back of the truck, the transfer too painful to ignore even being in shock as I was. The paramedics questioned me, but I don't remember what I told them to be honest. I knew they wouldn't believe the truth.

I don't know what that thing was, but I don't drive alone any more.
