Paranormal or parallel? Believer and previous non believer seeking opinions!
…
I’ve experienced a few small nods towards the paranormal in my life (20F) although my Bf (21M) has never. We’re both very much believers in anything and everything you’ve got to say, so please. Let me know if you’ve had similar experiences or any advice on what our next step should be. Otherwise - enjoy our lives changing in 10 seconds  

Me and my boyfriend were playing video games in our bedroom on my birthday 5 nights ago for probably an hour or so. He was on our bed playing xbox, I was on my pc not even a foot away.

When we finally got off the game we both took our headphones off and he looked at me saying "Do you want to smoke a bowl?"
I responded with "yes" and joined him on our bed. Around 10 seconds after he initially asked to smoke - he went to grab his phone and I was just looking at him. Then a female sounding voice (almost identical to mine, but not quite) clear as day said "can we take a bowl?". I wasn’t expecting to hear my own voice so I still don’t know if I’m trying to think it wasn’t but we both heard it. 

 It was only a few words off from what my bf said so we first thought maybe a recording, hacker, device relay, Alexa, cops?? We truly have been over everything and it's a dead end every time. It was a completely different sentence all together so we got over that option very quick. 

My bf had never believed in any type of alternative universe before this but it's the only "logical" conclusion. We're both convinced this was a glitch and in some other timeline I said that to him instead. It's happened way to many times, me saying that exact phrase & exact scenario even in the same tone.  

Was this maybe my passed best friend visiting me on my birthday legit wanting to smoke with us? A mimic? A ghost? We both got immediate chills and left the house to my parents. I was hotter than I’ve ever been in my life the whole night, sweat beading down my face calm as day hours later. I woke up to a horrible dream of me and my bf in our own bed at home and in the dream I woke up, rushed to the end of the bed to see a demon figure and before I could even react I was awake.

Another thing maybe related or not: we just moved into this house 4 months ago. Ever since I have been feeling so drained, no energy, my mood has been erratic at times. Maybe I’m vulnerable? I’m so lost right now but trying to stay positive.

I also want to say that no we were not just intoxicated or whatever we didn't even get our bowl bc it spooked us too bad :( We have carbon monoxide detectors in every single room in our house, they are on and working and have been throughly checked. I appreciate the concerns but unfortunately that’s not our problem solved here.

Let me know what you think: Glitch? Ghost? Mimic? Loved one? 

Any feedback is greatly appreciated! We are still very jumbled over this and do not quite know what to make of the situation.
