Dude, I should not have had that last beer. Or maybe it was the five shots of Fireball before we left the house. Either way, my stomach was absolutely destroyed as I stumbled into this sketchy gas station bathroom. My brothers at Sigma Chi are waiting on me. I NEED to hurry…

“Bro emergency,” I muttered, pushing through the heavy door. The place reeked, but whatever. I was about to explode. My Sigma Chi tattoos were just barely visible under my wrinkled polo as I made my way to the middle stall. The lock was busted, but who cares? I’d be in and out.
Man, I was so wrong.

As soon as I sat down, my gut just went haywire. Like, way beyond normal beer shits. This was something else entirely. Wave after wave hit me, hot and wet like ground beef forcing itself out of my asshole, I couldn’t even move my toes. My legs felt like jelly.

“What the hell,” I groaned, checking my phone. How? Already been here an hour? That couldn’t be right. I’m fucking wasted.

I tried calling my boy Tyler to come check on me, but my phone kept dropping calls. The fluorescent light was flickering like crazy, making weird shadows dance on the walls. Probably just the alcohol messing with my head.

By hour two, I was getting concerned. This was not normal, even after my legendary celebratory hangover keggers. My body felt like it was eating itself from the inside out. I kept hearing weird scratching sounds in the walls. Probably just old pipes, right? I can’t hear shit over the sound of wet slop hitting brown water.  

That’s when I noticed the graffiti. Weird stuff I swear wasn’t there before. Messages scratched into the paint: “It watches,” “Day 8. Getting weaker,” “The creature feeds.”

Probably just some emo kids trying to be scary. I would have laughed if I wasn’t feeling so awful.

My phone buzzed. Raven’s name popped up. My goth girlfriend with all her dark makeup and fishnet everything. She was probably wondering where I disappeared to. We’d been at some party, and she’d been looking incredible in that new black corset with all the buckles and chains.
“Kyle? Where did you go? You just vanished from the party.” Her voice had that smoky quality from her clove cigarettes. “I’m still here in my full makeup and platform boots, and Brad’s asking if you’re okay.”

“Hey babe,” I managed, trying to sound normal. “Just had to use the bathroom real quick. This gas station on… uh…” I looked around for a sign. “Highway 9.” Even in my weakened state, I smiled thinking about her towering over everyone at the party in her platform boots. All nine feet of my amazonian goth goddess.

“You’ve been gone for two hours, Kyle.”
Two hours? No way. “That can’t be right. I just got here.”

Something shifted in the shadows behind the stall. Probably just my imagination. I was pretty drunk when this started.

“You sound weird. Are you sick?” Raven’s concern was clear even through her usual deadpan delivery. I could picture her adjusting her silver nose ring like she did when she was worried.

“Just the beer, you know? Had way too much.” I tried to laugh it off, but another wave hit me hard. My vision blurred. “Listen, I might need”

The scratching in the walls got louder. Way louder. Like something big was moving around in there.

“Kyle? What was that noise?”

“Probably just… pipes or whatever.” I was starting to feel really weak. Hours of this had drained everything out of me. “Hey Raven? If something happens”

“What? Kyle, you’re scaring me. What do you mean if something happens?”

I could hear her combat boots clicking as she paced. Those custom-made size 15 boots that helped her reach her full nine-foot height. She was probably smearing her dark lipstick as she bit her lip. She always did that when she was anxious.
That’s when I realized the scratching wasn’t coming from the pipes anymore. It was coming from right behind me. 

“Ermm- it’s right behind me isn’t it?”Something was in here with me, and it had been right behind me. Waiting for me to get weak enough.

“The creature,” I whispered, finally understanding what those graffiti messages meant.

“What? THE creature? Kyle, what are you talking about?”

“The creature right behind me.” I gasped as the final wave of shit fluttered out of my ass, the sound slowed as my body failed me. The sound of my farts somber and slow like jazz

My body finally gave out completely. The thing- that CREATURE had been right behind me if I hadn’t made that clear enough; hunting me this whole time, and I’d been too drunk to realize it. As everything went dark, I could hear Raven 9 feet tall, screaming my name through the phone, her voice cracking with panic.

She’d probably show up here in her full goth gear. She’s 7 foot 5 even without the platform heels but she doesn’t mind being even taller for me. The dramatic winged eyeliner, the dark eyeshadow that made her look like some beautiful specter. Ready to fight whatever had taken me. But it would be too late.

The last thing I heard was wet feeding sounds and my girlfriend’s desperate voice promising to burn this whole place down with her ritual candles, her sobs mixing with sounds I really didn’t want to identify. I couldn’t help but think about how she’d wear her 19 inch tall heels to my funeral, she knew I always wanted a woman who was 9 feet tall. 

The creature had found its meal, and now it would wait for the next, clueless, helpless, sigma chi brother like me who had one too many brews. I could only hope I’d be lucky enough to crack a cold one with Jesus up in heaven 





Edit: What’s up? I’m Chad! President of Sigma Chi house! And right now, I’ve been tasked with solving Kyle’s murder, or disappearance, or whatever the hell happened to my brother.

The cops basically shrugged when that nine-foot goth chick Raven came to them with her story about Kyle being trapped in some gas station bathroom. I mean, I get it. She’s intimidating as hell in those custom size 15 combat boots and all that black makeup. But Kyle was one of ours, and we don’t abandon our brothers.

So here I am, pulling up to this sketchy gas station on Highway 9 in my lifted F-150, ready to get some answers. The place looks like it hasn’t been updated since the ‘80s, and there’s this weird smell in the air, like something died and got left to rot.

“Bro, this place gives me the creeps,” I muttered, adjusting my backwards cap as I walked toward the building. The neon “Open 24 Hours” sign flickered ominously.

Inside, the clerk, some dude with more piercings than Raven, barely looked up from his phone when I asked about Kyle.

“Yeah, there was some frat boy in here a few days ago,” he said with zero interest. “Went into the bathroom, never came out. We figured he climbed out the window or something.”

“What do you mean never came out?”

The clerk shrugged. “Bathroom door was locked from the inside when we finally checked. Nobody in there, though. Just his phone on the floor and some… mess.”

My stomach dropped. This was not the explanation I was hoping for.

I headed toward the men’s room, pushing through that heavy door Kyle had described to Raven during their last phone call. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, and immediately I could see why Kyle had been freaked out. The middle stall had graffiti everywhere, messages scratched into the paint that definitely weren’t there during normal vandalism.

“Day 12. Still here.”
“It feeds on weakness.”
“The creature hunts.”

And at the bottom, in what looked like Kyle’s handwriting:
“Tell Chad to avenge me. Tell Raven I love her platforms.”

“What the hell, Kyle,” I whispered, pulling out my phone to text the group chat. But my signal was completely dead in here.

That’s when I heard it. Scratching in the walls. Just like Raven had described from Kyle’s phone call. My first instinct was to bolt, but I’m the president of Sigma Chi. We don’t run from anything.

“Yo, whatever’s in here!” I called out, trying to sound braver than I felt. “You messed with the wrong fraternity!”

The scratching stopped. Then something much worse started, a low, wet sound coming from the pipes above. Like something large was moving through them.

My phone suddenly got signal and immediately started buzzing with texts from the brothers asking for updates. But the most chilling message was from Raven:
“Get out of there NOW. I can sense it waking up.”

Nine feet of goth intuition was not something to ignore.

I backed toward the door, but it wouldn’t budge. The same pneumatic hiss Kyle had mentioned was back, only in reverse, like the room was sealing itself.

“Oh, come on!” I banged on the door. “I’ve got a charity mixer to plan!”

The creature, whatever Kyle had encountered, was getting closer. I could feel its presence growing stronger, just like he’d described. But unlike my brother, I wasn’t weakened by hours of beer and Fireball. I was stone cold sober and pissed off.

My phone buzzed one more time. Another text from Raven:
“If you’re still alive, the creature feeds on desperation. Stay angry, not afraid. Kyle’s spirit says the silver cross on your chain burns it.”

I looked down at the Sigma Chi cross pendant around my neck, the one Kyle had given me when I became president. It was starting to glow with a faint silver light. Was Kyle watching me from beyond the grave? Would he protect me like a stand from JoJo’s bizarre adventure?

“Alright, you ugly bastard,” I growled, gripping the cross. “Let’s see how you handle a pissed-off frat president with nothing to lose and a trunk full of cold ones…”
