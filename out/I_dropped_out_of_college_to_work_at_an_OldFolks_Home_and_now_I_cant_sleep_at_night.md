This is a confession. And a warning.

I wish I could say nothing, but I know I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. This is the least I can do, posting this.

I can only hope it will be enough.

About a year ago, I was in a rough patch. I was in college and my grades were plunging straight into the ground. I had stopped caring about school when my only friend had been killed in a car accident at the beginning of the year. All of the grief was making me reconsider my values and life ambitions. Ultimately, I came to the decision that life was too short to do things I hated.

So, instead of trying to salvage my education, I decided to drop out and look for a job. The money I had saved up for tuition became my personal savings. Instead of going to class, I worked on my resume and applied to jobs. At the time, all I knew was I needed to get out of the town where I was living, and put my failed schooling behind me.

I had recently finished CNA training in a misguided attempt to find jobs within my major (Nursing). Taking the course had burned me out in some ways, but I was grateful to have something concrete for my resume. I applied to hospitals, private practices, even prisons. Honestly, I was just looking for anywhere that was hiring.

After three months of no luck, I was at the end of my rope.

Then one day I found a listing on Indeed for an opening at a Nursing Home that looked promising. The pay was good, and they were also out of state. That last bit sounds like a hassle, but it was a bonus for me.  Getting the job would mean moving away, which is something I really wanted to do. Anything to get away from the memory of my friend.

I put in an application, not really expecting anything. A week later, I received an email. It told me I had gotten an interview for a CNA position.

The Nursing Home was a few states away, but I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on plane tickets. I decided to take a risk and drive down with all my stuff. I didn’t own a lot, and anyway, I wasn’t coming back. This interview was the excuse I needed to get away.

I filled two suitcases with whatever I could, gave the rest to my roommates, canceled my lease and turned in my key. Homeless and jobless, I drove away, never looking back.

After two days of driving, I arrived at my destination: the Home. It was impressive. Just by looking at the outside you could tell it was one of those fancy retirement homes only the uber rich could afford. Sweeping lawns, pillared terraces, that kind of shit. It looked like something out of *Downton Abbey*. It must have housed over a hundred residents, and even though I had been to almost a dozen different facilities, I had never seen anything that compared to this.

I remember being in awe, both by its size and its beauty. Even now, it weirds me out at how calm I felt, like this was the place I was meant to be.

The woman who interviewed me was also strange. I had worked for a few other assisted living facilities at that point, and to put it politely, the people that ran them looked only a few years away from staying there themselves. My would-be boss wasn’t like that. She was young, tall, thin, and looked like she should be in LA starring in the next big movie or television show. That, or maybe CEO of the next Multi-level Marketing Company.

She was also exceptionally kind. Most people never went out of their way to treat me with anything more than base politeness. She seemed to actually care about me, which made me put my guard down. We chatted for the first twenty minutes of the interview about my personal interests, what I thought of the facility, and some tv shows both of us had seen. After confirming my skill set, she offered me the job on the spot.

I accepted. I wonder where I would be now if I hadn’t. Maybe I would still be able to sleep at night.

At the time, I was relieved. My risk had paid off. Besides, I had already spent a large chunk of savings on this trip, and I needed the cash. I signed some paperwork, gave some personal info, thanked her, then went to find an apartment.

The city was a twenty minute drive away from the Home. It wasn’t bad, as cities go. Sure, it was grungy and a bit run down, but that was my style. I felt like I fit right in. I found an apartment on the bad side of town that fit my price range: dirt cheap. The interior was old, with decor that hadn’t been updated since the 80’s, but there was wifi and the carpet wasn’t too dirty. It was also close to some good restaurants (hole in the wall places, but absolutely delicious food) and the laundromat was built into the complex as well.

In a word, it was convenient. Very convenient.

I unpacked, and started my new life.

Work was rigorous. My boss warned me about that in the interview. The Home was run strictly and efficiently, and it was proud of their system. Like most everything about it, their ideas of how a nursing home should be handled was different from most other assisted living facilities. First off, employees were assigned to singular residents, like personal servants. My boss had explained it was to provide a higher standard of care, as most of the paying customers were shelling out fortunes to stay there.

For the CNA’s, shifts were divided into a morning and evening cycle, a different CNA being selected for both. They were expected to be at their resident’s beck and call for the entirety of their shift. Duties included helping residents with the bathroom, administering medication, fetching items, and doing whatever the resident either needed or wanted. If they said jump, we leaped, no questions asked. It sounds miserable, but honestly, it wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

I was assigned to Mrs. Beverly. 

I mentioned earlier that I was no stranger to working in Assisted Living Facilities. However, I there is a secret I’ve never told anyone:

I’m terrified of old people.

I don’t know if it comes from my grandparents raising me, or if it’s just some sort of genetic trait that never worked its way out of my DNA, but I am not comfortable around anyone over the age of sixty.

But for some reason, Mrs. Beverly didn’t bother me. She was old, yes. Very old. But on my first day, I walked in and saw her reading *Salem’s Lot* by Stephen King, one of my favorite all-time books. Needless to say, we hit it off right away.

Mrs. Beverly was from Germany, and had been there when the Berlin wall both rose and fell. She had the most endearing German accent, which sounds strange, but trust me, for lack of a better term, it was cute. She was also one of the kindest people I had ever met.

Mrs. Beverly assured me from day one that she thought the long hours I worked were absurd, and that she wouldn’t need all that much help-wise. This was a relief. When I overheard some of the other residents talking to their CNA’s, I could tell most were not like Mrs. Beverly.

She also told me she didn’t want me to lose hours on her account, so she told me to stay and do whatever I wanted until my shift was over.

We quickly fell into a routine that benefited me immensely. Most of the day was spent talking with Mrs. Beverly or playing my switch while Mrs. Beverly slept. When she was awake, we would swap horror book recommendations, and watch *Supernatural.* Sometimes we’d shake it up with an old black-and white horror movie. We watched *Nosferatu* at least once a week.

Sometimes Mrs. Beverly would need actual help, like going to the bathroom or getting medication, but she was pretty self-sufficient. Apart from being wheelchair bound, she was exceptionally independent for a geriatric living in a care facility.

There were also other perks. The Home had the most delicious cafeteria. Most Assisted-Living Cafeteria’s are garbage, but the Home’s food still makes my mouth water thinking about it. CNA’s and other workers could pay to eat there, but the prices were ridiculously high (the food was worth it though). I had no self-control when it came to eating there. I think I gained fifteen pounds in the first few months. It might have started eating into my savings if it wasn’t for Mrs. Beverly.

Once she learned I loved to eat there, Mrs. Beverly would order an absolute shitload of food, then slide most of it over to me when it was brought to her. I would try to refuse, or pay her at least, but she would just wink and tell me to eat. She said it did her good to see someone as skinny as I was putting meat on my bones.

That saved me a ton of money on food, and the pay was so good I was getting back what I had lost by moving way faster than anticipated. I don’t exaggerate when I say it was the best job I ever had.

While Mrs. Beverly was cool, the Home was still strange to me. There was not a lot of interaction among coworkers, since there was only one worker per resident. I spent so much time with Mrs. Beverly, I only ever saw my coworkers in passing. For those I did have surface-level interactions with, I got to know a few of their faces, but every time I was starting to get familiar with someone, they’d quit and a new worker would take their place. The Home had a high turnover rate, but they never seemed to be hurting for workers. New faces would replace old ones almost immediately.

Life became routine, and before I knew it, four months had passed. Even with my unexpected connection with Mrs. Beverly, life was kind of lonely. But I wasn’t complaining. Sure, I spent most evenings playing *Elden Ring* and drinking beer all by myself, but I was making a lot of money and didn’t have to worry about finances anymore. I had a roof over my head, food in the fridge, and no homework or other school nonsense to worry about.

Life was good.

However, one day, I was a bit later clocking out than usual. The Home still used punch cards, along with some other outdated equipment, even though the medical stuff was top notch. I didn’t mind. It was cool to walk around the manor, and the old tech made it feel like you were stepping back in time.

But this day, I was in a hurry. I had accidentally overstayed talking with Mrs. Beverly, and didn’t want to get written up for taking unauthorized overtime.

When I got to the clock-in station, the room was empty. Normally there would be one or two people clocking out, as well as cafeteria and laundry staff taking a dinner break. It was just another reminder for how late I was. I punched out, and turned to go out the door. I wasn’t looking where I was going, and I ran headlong into someone entering the room.

It was a short, college-aged girl with long blonde hair and the thick kind of glasses that people wear in ads but no one really wears in real life. She was cute, and I definitely stared way too long at her. I was still a bit dazed. Once I stopped acting like a neanderthal, I apologized awkwardly, and she told me it was fine and not to worry about it. While she punched in, I ducked out and went home, kicking myself for being so awkward.

That Sunday (the only day I had off during the week) I was at a coffee shop when I saw her again. At first I tried to stay out of sight, embarrassed, but she saw me before I could get away. She came over and started chatting with me.

Her name was Lena. She had seen my *Beserk* brand of sacrifice tattoo on my wrist, which I had gotten when I was sixteen and didn’t know any better. She had wanted to compliment me on it on the day I had literally bumped into her, but I had left before she could say anything.

We got our coffees and kept talking for most of the morning.

She was into *Beserk* too, and she had been working at the Home for three months longer than me. She also worked for Mrs. Beverly, and we both agreed that she was the absolute coolest. We were into the same video games (*Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, Zelda*) and had a lot of other stuff in common. She had dropped out of college three months before I did, and had an awkward relationship with her parents as well.

She had somewhere she needed to be later that day so we said goodbye and parted ways, but before I could leave she grabbed my phone and punched in her number. “For shift exchanges,” she said. She sent herself a text so she would have my number, then left the coffee shop. I had major butterflies in my stomach watching her go.

The next Sunday, she texted to hang out, and I played it cool by replying “sure.” I then spent way too much time trying to pick out my outfit. We went to a local arcade, spending over fifty bucks in quarters. She told me she had wanted to go for ages but didn’t have anyone to go with who would appreciate it.

We learned we lived in the same apartment complex. I was worried that might be creepy, but Lena started showing up in the evenings with a six pack and an extra controller. There were a few hours between my shift and hers (Mrs. Beverly was cool with her showing up late) so we’d play games and drink a little before Lena would leave to catch the chartered bus to the Home as she didn’t have a car.

That went on for two months. We would hang out evenings, and then spend most of Sunday together doing something or other that caught our interest. Sometimes she would stay so late, she would crash on my couch, and leave the next morning. After two weeks, I started giving Lena a ride to the Home so we could spend a bit more time together in the evenings. She accepted. Those hours in the car were special. We would talk about everything and anything. Even though it was eating into my savings and my old car was needing repairs from the extra mileage, it was worth it.

I was happier than I’d ever been.

Mrs. Beverly noticed my new cheerful attitude, and asked me why I was so happy. I didn’t really tell her why. The Home had a pretty strict anti-romantic-relationship policy when it came to coworkers. It could be grounds to be fired. At the time, I guessed they were tired of CNA’s hooking up in the linen closets on shift, and that was how they put a stop to it.

So I didn’t talk about Lena. I gave some other excuse about why I was smiling more, and Mrs. Beverly left it at that. But I always suspected she knew what was really going on.

One night, Lena and I were at my apartment messing around. We had gotten a pizza, and drank a little too much. We were arguing about some small chemistry principle both of us didn’t really remember from our college days. It was a playful argument, nothing serious. We looked up the factoid, and it turned out I was right. Lena shoved me, and we started play-fighting, and the next thing I knew our faces were inches from each other.

I leaned in and kissed Lena for the first time.

I pulled away and we stared at each other in shock. I had always played it really safe with Lena. She was my only friend there. I didn’t want to ruin that. It was nice to have someone to talk to and spend time with, someone my age and who really understood me. Although I wouldn’t have minded if things had gone to more physical places, I was afraid that I would lose all the good things that had been there if I tried to force it.

I was already beating myself up in my head for being so stupid and impulsive.

I started to apologize.

That’s when Lena came up and kissed me back.

I won’t go into details of what happened after, but it was very clear both of us had been waiting for someone to make a move. How long we had both been waiting, I don’t know, but all of the feelings I had tried to keep buried came to the surface and I just gave into them.

But before we could do anything substantial, Lena’s phone alarm went off for her shift at the Home.

I was too drunk to drive, and she was about to miss her bus, so she got her clothes on, and told me that she would be back tomorrow night. We had one last kiss, and she ran out the door. I laid back on my bed with the greatest feeling. I could hardly wait for the next time we would see each other.

The next morning, I went on shift. Mrs. Beverly, and I were both in exceptionally good moods. She asked again why I was so happy, and I let it slip that I had met someone. We gossiped about my mystery girl, and the romance of her past. Even though I kept Lena’s name out of it, it felt so good to finally tell someone.

My shift passed by in a blur, and I got to my apartment. I went a little crazy. I cleaned everything, bought flowers, and even went to our favorite Thai place to get takeout.

Everything was prepared, and I waited.

Lena never showed up.

The next two weeks were a haze. I tried texting, but she didn’t respond. I called and it went to voicemail. At first, I believed that she’d ghosted me. I let myself have it. I screamed at myself in the mirror about how huge of an idiot I was and even broke my TV when I punched it in a drunk rage one night.

I was alone again, and it was worse than before. This time, I knew what I was missing.

I drowned myself in booze and was barely able to function. It took all I had to keep showing up at my job. I started leaving earlier so I wouldn’t risk running into Lena. I stayed indoors on Sunday and played games and drank until neither was fun anymore.

Mrs. Beverly noticed. It was impossible not to. She had my eternal gratitude at the time because she gave me a pass. She could tell something had happened, and she didn’t hold it against me. She even commiserated with me, telling stories about her heartbreaks and assuring me it would be okay.

Sometimes, we would just sit in silence, and she would rub my back while I cried.

One day, Mrs. Beverly grabbed my face and looked me in the eye. This was the sternest I had ever seen her. She looked almost angry.

“Get up. Get over it. You have a life to live,” she said.

She was right, and I knew it. It took a monumental effort, but I got up. I went home and poured out my liquor and beer. I cleaned up my space, which had accumulated trash and filth from two weeks of negligence. I found a few of the things Lena had left behind. It wasn’t a lot. Just some scrubs and other work related items that she kept at my place in case she needed to change. Some video games too. I considered throwing her stuff out, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

But I needed to get rid of them.

I had visited Lena’s apartment a few times over the past months when we were still on talking terms, so I knew where it was. During my two-week bender, I had thought about trying to visit so I could ask why she stopped talking to me, but I just couldn’t bring myself to face her. I was a bit better now, not as angry or as self-destructive. And a little part of my heart hoped that she had changed her mind.

I brought over the box of her things, and knocked on the door. Waiting on the doorstep, my heart was racing. I tried to calm it down. I didn’t want to look desperate.

I heard footsteps, and the door opened. My heart lifted then fell. I was immediately confused.

The person who answered the door was not Lena. It was an older woman with dark hair and sun-worn skin. I double checked I had the right address, and the lady confirmed that this was the apartment I was looking for. I asked if she knew where the previous owner had gone.

The lady looked at me weird. She told me she had been living there for the past two years.

I knew that wasn’t true, but something made me not press the matter. I apologized to her and left.

Nothing about this made sense, and something felt seriously wrong.

I went to the front office of the complex and asked for the forwarding address for Lena. I tried to seem nonchalant, but I don’t think I did a good job covering my feelings. The complex insisted there had never been a “Lena” living in that apartment.

I felt like I was going crazy. I was worried about late stage schizophrenia or some other mental disorder until I found pictures of Lena on my phone. I *knew* I wasn’t crazy.

I was starting to panic. I hadn’t said it out loud, but I knew something had happened to Lena. And it looked like the apartment complex was involved. With how sketchy the area was, the possibilities of what happened to her felt endless. Trafficking, gang violence, she could be buried somewhere in a shallow grave. I tried not to think too much about that last option.

I didn’t know where to start, but if Lena was in trouble, I needed to find her.

I thought about calling the police, but I needed proof first. Something more solid than just pictures on a phone. Otherwise, they might lock me up just for being crazy.

I paced around the room for hours, thinking about where I could search. I kept the blinds shut and spent the rest of my Sunday trying to figure out what to do. I couldn’t sleep, even though I tried. Images of Lena broken and bleeding kept appearing every time I closed my eyes. I ended up not sleeping that night.

It was still dark outside when my alarm went off. It scared me before I remembered what it was for: 

It was time for my shift at the Home.

I considered calling in sick. That was a big no-no, but if Mrs. Beverly could placate my superiors, I would be fine. I was in no state to work there anyways. I had the phone in hand, ready to dial the number.

Then I got an idea. I could narrow down when Lena went missing if I could confirm if she arrived for her shift at the Home that night. It wasn’t a lot, but it was something to go off of. In a few minutes, I was speeding in my car towards the Home.

When I got to the Home, I only stopped by Mrs. Beverly’s for a moment. I tried to keep it cool, but like always, she could tell something was bothering me. I reassured her I was okay, and then found an excuse to get out, saying something about refilling some supplies or getting some medication I knew we were going to need.

I didn’t do any of that. Instead, I went to my boss’s office.

It was on the top floor, and was in the same place where they kept the Home’s records. The receptionist was on break when I got there. The door to the office was closed.  I knocked, and no one answered. I started feeling panicked again. I needed to talk to her. Feeling impatient, another idea occurred to me.

During orientation, I had been told that there was a state-of-the-art camera system set up on the premises as part of the facility tour. It was to maintain resident safety, and could store up to a month of footage. At the time, they had shared the factoid to prove how impressive the Home was.

Now, all it meant to me was that there might be footage of Lena entering and exiting the building on the day she went missing.

I checked to see if the boss’s door was locked.

It wasn’t.

I celebrated my good luck and went inside. I only had a few minutes, and I was starting to get reckless. I needed to find Lena, even if that meant losing my job.

The office matched the rest of the Home. That is to say, it was old and stately. A mahogany desk was on the opposite end of the room with a great window of stained glass casting shifting colors as the sun rose over the mountains in the distance. It also made weird, spidery shadows on the floor that made my skin prickle. I chalked it up to nerves. I had never broken and entered before. There was a laptop open on the desk. I moved to it. The screen was black, but fiddling with the mouse brought the screen back to life.

I knew that the camera program was accessible through the wifi. The guards at the gate could watch the feed and keep track of the residents. I found an icon for the security company and clicked on it. The camera feed appeared on screen. It was thousands of small boxes showing the Residents and CNA’s about their morning routine. I found Mrs. Beverly’s screen. She was reading now, looking up at the door every so often.

I saw a tab at the top. It read “archived footage”. I clicked on it, and was barraged by a mountain of files. They were labeled by date and camera number, so I double checked which ones were attributed to Mrs. Beverly. Going back into the archive, I found the file with the correct camera number and date. I clicked on it and the video player opened up.

It started off with footage of Mrs. Beverly sleeping. I skipped around, and saw footage of me working. Then I skipped some more, but was greeted with only a black screen. There were white words superimposed on the black background.

It said “Footage moved to Secondary Storage.”

My heart dropped. What the hell did that mean?

I had never heard of Secondary Storage. I knew that the servers for the cameras were kept in the basement, but as far as I knew, that was all that was down there. And it was off limits to employees such as myself. It was one of the only places in the building we weren’t allowed to go.

It was a weak straw, but I was grasping at anything.

I looked around for my boss's keycard. If she was out and about, chances are she had it with her, but I needed to be sure. I pulled open drawers, and my heart leapt when I saw the little plastic rectangle with a picture of her on it. I swiped it, and made my way to the door.

That was when I heard footsteps.

I panicked. I ran to a closet on the other side of the room, and got in as quietly as I could. I closed the door so it only remained slightly open. The footsteps got closer, and I heard the door open.

Through the crack, I saw my boss enter the room.

She gave no indication that anything was amiss. She was looking at her phone, holding a container of yogurt in one hand, and a bottled health drink in the other. She sat down behind her desk, and absent-mindedly fiddled with the trackpad on the laptop

I bottled up a gasp. I hadn’t closed the camera window.

She didn’t look at her screen, but was shaking her bottle. I knew that any moment, she would turn and see the open program, and then it was only a matter of time before she found me. I clamped a hand over my mouth to keep from breathing hard and giving myself away.

My boss stopped shaking the bottle. My heart stopped as well.

She opened some drawers, looking for something. Her keycard grew sweaty in my palm.

She cursed. Then she stood up and walked to the door.

“I always forget the damn spoon.”

She closed the door behind her, and it took me a second to realize that she had been looking for a utensil for her yogurt. I almost laughed out loud in relief.

I got out of the closet, and out of the office. I tried to look as nonchalant as possible when I passed other CNA’s in the hallway. It took everything I had not to freak out at every little noise.

I went straight to the server room. It was in the basement, on the right corner of the manor. I tried the keycard on the door. The red light flashed green, and I heard the lock click. I went inside and the door locked behind me.

It was dark inside the room. The only illumination was some emergency lights, and the slight blinking of the servers. Even in the darkness, I was struck by the decadence of the space. I wasn’t familiar with security servers, but I knew that they weren’t usually carpeted spaces with wood paneling.

I started looking for anything I could use. I once again realized my stupidity when I came to the conclusion that  I had no idea how any of this worked. My fear was building with each second I stayed.

I saw a door on the opposite side. It had another keycard lock. Thinking there might be a terminal inside, I tried the boss’s keycard. The light flashed green, and I opened the door.

I still dream about what I saw next.

The area beyond was a long hallway, lit by ancient, yellow electric lights. It must have gone on for 200 feet until its dead end. Wooden filing cabinets built into the walls were layered up to the ceiling. Each was set with a metal panel engraved with a name. Near the door, I saw a name that I recognized.

Mrs. Beverly.

I didn’t even consider what the implications of this hallway were. I was desperate to find out what happened to Lena. I took a risk, and reached up to pull the cabinet’s handle. It slid open on oiled hinges. Inside were VHS tapes, the kinds old security cameras used to use. Each was labeled with scotch tape and sharpie. I saw many names I didn’t recognize, then near the back I saw what I was looking for.

Lena. Night Shift.

I grabbed it without thinking, and shoved it into my pocket.

I left the hall, then went through the server room, closing the door behind me. I was about to cross straight to the door, when I heard something that made my blood run cold.

The beep of a keycard swiping outside.

I jumped behind another server. I heard the door open, then close. The emergency lights flickered, leaving the room darker than it was before.

Footsteps moved down the server aisles. I moved quietly, keeping myself out of sight of whoever was inside.  I moved from server block to server block.

I was three feet away from the door when I heard the footsteps stop. I don’t know if it was my imagination, but it seemed whoever was in here with me had halted where I had hidden just a minute before.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I sprinted for the exit. Swiping my keycard took an eternity, and I thought I heard whoever was in there begin walking towards me. The light flashed green, and I threw open the door and slammed it behind me.

It was almost too easy to get up the stairs and go out the back entrance. I sprinted down the halls, trying to be as fast as possible, forgetting stealth. Once outside, I snuck through the gardens to get back to the staff parking lot.

I knew I was going to lose my job, but I didn’t care. I needed to know what happened to Lena. I needed something I could bring to the police. I knew what I was doing was right, but I felt bad I couldn’t say bye to Mrs. Beverly first. She had done so much for me, been there for me when no one else was. I hoped that one day she could forgive me for not saying goodbye.

I drove back to the city, looking over my shoulder the whole way. I didn’t go home. I didn’t trust my apartment was safe. 

I needed to see what was on that tape.

There was a retro video store in the seedier part of town. Near my apartment actually. They sold old tapes, but for fifteen dollars you could buy porno VHS’s and watch them in a private viewing booth in a back room. Lena and I had found it when we had wanted to watch an old authentic Disney film, and were too cheap to pay for Disney+. The store owner had made some assumptions about us and made an offer. We laughed about it for weeks. But now, thinking about it gave me a lump in my throat as I went through the door.

I paid the fifteen, grabbed a random smut film from the stack, and closed the door to the booth. I pulled out the tape from my coat labeled “Lena” and slid it into the player. The screen came to life.

The video was dark at first, except for some white text that denoted date and time. Then the image appeared. It was Mrs. Beverly’s room. Lena and Mrs. Beverly were there, going about the nightly routine. There was no audio. I watched, and for an hour, nothing out of the ordinary happened.

Lena helped Mrs. Beverly into bed. I kept watching.

Another hour passed. Nothing.

I was feeling tired. My head hurt from my lack of sleep. My adrenaline was running out and it took everything I could not to doze off.

I was shaken from my stupor, when something on the VHS changed.

Mrs. Beverly was sleeping. Lena was reading in the corner. She stood up and stretched, then moved to go to the door. In the background, Mrs. Beverly was bolt upright in bed. I didn’t remember seeing her sit up. Lena didn’t turn. It didn’t look like she had heard her. She was writing a note on a nightstand, oblivious, as Mrs. Beverly slid out of bed, and moved behind Lena.

I felt sweat bead on my forehead.

Lena turned around, and jumped when she saw how close Mrs. Beverly was standing to her. Mrs. Beverly grabbed Lena’s neck with both hands. Lena struggled for a moment, reaching for her neck, then began to twitch and seize, her arms jumping as they tried to grab hold.

Mrs. Beverly’s arms began to expand and contort. Lena’s body became emaciated, like the blood and water was being sucked from her. Her clothes fell off her shriveling form. Mrs. Beverly expanded and bloated like a balloon. Her ankles, calves, and face swelled. Her veins stood out on her skin like roots and her mouth lolled open, her tongue stretching out the corner of her mouth, dripping clear liquid.

Then everything that was inside of Lena began traveling through Mrs. Beverly’s fingers and into her body. 

Lena’s body contorted and bones became displaced as her innards traveled up the length of Mrs. Beverly’s arms. It was as if they were conduits to her insides. Her hands and arms expanded to account for the muscles and organs that made their way into her own form. Lena’s mouth was open in a scream I couldn’t hear. Her body became limp, and empty.

It took fifteen minutes. The last thing of Lena to go was her skin, which melded to Mrs. Beverly’s hands like a floppy conjoined glove.

Mrs. Beverly was unrecognizable. She was bloated with strange shapes coming out of different areas of her body. Sharp points of ribs barely contained within her skin. She closed her eyes and collapsed upon the ground.

There was a second where nothing moved.

Then Mrs. Beverly’s form began to boil. Her skin became shapeless and it was like watching some terrible soup of human flesh tremble and twist. Things moved around inside of her, things that pressed up against the surface until the skin was almost translucent. I couldn’t look away. I hated it, but I couldn’t stop watching.

After thirty minutes, a healthy, naked, normal looking Mrs. Beverly lay sleeping on the ground.

The video ended.

I never went back to my apartment. I went to a branch of my bank and withdrew all the money I had. I went to the airport and bought the furthest plane ticket I could find. I left the tape in front of the police station in a paper bag with the word “Evidence” written on it.

I was a coward. I should’ve stayed and made sure it got in the right hands. I should’ve done more, made sure that whatever was going on at the Home was stopped.

That was a year ago. I’ve been living off the grid since, using cash, and renting apartments that don’t require personal records. I do risky construction jobs, pick fruit, mow lawns. Anything where they hand you the money and don’t ask questions.

But I know now I haven’t run far enough. For the past month, I’ve felt people watch me when no one was there. I come back home, and people have been through my things. Sometimes, at night, I hear things move around in the dark. I don’t know how much longer I can last.

There’s a reason I haven’t said the location of the Home, or even which state it’s in.

I can’t remember.

The moment I left the city, it was like every detail about the location disappeared from my mind. No address, no map. I can’t even remember my old apartment address. When I went to check my old mailing addresses on Amazon, there’s a blank space where it should be.

I can’t find any evidence of the Home or the city. Sometimes I wonder if I’m going crazy.

But I know it’s real. I can’t forget what I’ve seen.

Lena deserves justice. People need to know.

But it’s only a matter of time for me. The Home never lets go. Maybe I got out so easily because it knew what it would feel like to be away. Even if I can’t say exactly where it is, I know I can find my way there. It’s like a sixth sense that sits right underneath my collar. Sometimes when I can’t sleep at night, thinking about all the horrific things I saw, I hear the Home calling to me, asking me to return.

It’s getting harder to say no.
