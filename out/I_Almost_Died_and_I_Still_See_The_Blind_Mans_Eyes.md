There are horrors that are beyond human comprehension, some hidden in the darkness of night -but there are others that happen in broad daylight. I went through such a horror when I was a teenager. I lived in the city of Phnom Penh in the 1975, back when the Vietnam War was happening. I had a small family; a little sister, my parents, and my grandparents. My extended family included many aunts, uncles, and cousins. We all lived in the capital. 

I was in school at the time, and had dreams of becoming a writer when I grew up. The war felt distant but I was aware that there were some tensions in the country with communist political parties and strict laws which, admittedly, violated freedom of speech. Every day when I left school to listen to the radio at the markets, I’d see this old blind man; he had no eyes so only his eye sockets remained, wearing worn farmer’s clothes, and holding a gnarled cane. 

I’d see him giving sweets to the local children around the markets, and I was surprised none of them were scared of him. When he was by himself, he’d be sitting by the radio towers and humming to the music. 

April 17th was when it all went down. After talk of American forces bombing the country’s borders and the Khmer Rouge fighting back, the people were relieved that the Khmer Rouge took the city.  How could we have known? We were glad that the war appeared to be over. That relief turned sour when the communist soldiers were forcing us to evacuate the city, telling us that the Americans were bombing the cities next. 

Much of the family had to leave in a hurry, but some of my cousins were being taken away in the other direction by soldiers. One of them was an aspiring singer who sang at the local bars. He wasn’t any good, but he always made an effort to try.  I saw him being taken away including a lot of my classmates, my teachers, and the hippies. Something, deep in my stomach, told me that this was not good. 

The soldiers made us hand over whatever money we had on hand, all personal belongings, and a set of clothes to wear. The clothes were all the same, no one looked different from each other. We were placed into these camps where people planted rice, vegetables, and tended to animals. We were put into farms. When we arrived, all of our hair was cut short and we were made to wear our new clothes; loose, black, and a red scarf. 

We weren’t allowed to wear shoes, either. The soldiers told us that wearing shoes was a sign of being unpatriotic to the eyes of Angkar; the political entity. Our new lives would start there. At four in the morning, you would be woken up by the loud blare of sirens. The first word you would hear on the speakers were, 

“BLOOD-”

The blood of the people; of the workers and the farmers, of the soldiers. The national anthem would play as you were expected to get ready with whatever small lunch you can make and were expected to be on the fields by five. My parents, my sister, and I were only able to make a handful of rice with salt for each of us. 

My sister collected cow dung for fertilizer, I dug ditches, and my parents planted rice. We wouldn’t finish work for the day until 6 in the evening, but we wouldn’t be home until 11 at night after their weekly gatherings. Someone would be accused of being a spy, a traitor, or to indoctrinate us. Sleep at midnight, get up at 4, at work at 5, and leave by 6pm. 

Whatever breaks we got were brief and our lunches were tiny; always rice and salt. If we ever tried to sneak more food in, we’d be punished. My mom tried to stash some small fish and vegetables for my sister and I to eat, but a camp soldier found out and had her arrested. I couldn’t forget when the soldiers put a blindfold over her eyes, and paraded her around the camp. The soldiers said, 

“This woman has violated Angkar and proved selfish towards her fellow comrades. No one will have more or less than they are given. Angkar will provide for all!” 

I never saw my mother after that day. No one knew what happened to those who were found guilty, but I would find out eventually. One by one, I would see my cousins die; starvation, exhaustion, or taken by soldiers. My father, one night, told us he was going to give us some food to leave the camp and hopefully make it to the Thai border. At the time, we didn’t want to leave him; he was the only family we had left. He didn’t say anything and took us into the jungle in the middle of the night, managing to get just outside of the camp. 

My sister tried to beg for my dad to come with us, but his last words were, 

“GO! I don’t want you two anymore!” 

It hurt to hear that. I had to cover my sister’s mouth as she cried, and ran with her away as we left our dad behind. We already made too much noise, and my dad would be found eventually. We managed to find another camp and passed as orphans, and were made to work the rice fields. It wasn’t so bad after a while, adjusting to the schedule and my sister would have moments of silence away from the soldiers where we’d talk and sing the songs we heard on the radio before the evacuation. 

It was the first time I’d seen my sister smile ever since the first year of the regime. One day, I was singing to her as we worked, but a junior soldier caught me. That pit in my stomach came back, and I was taken away by soldiers and blindfolded. I felt like crying but I couldn’t show it. It was too dangerous. I was paraded throughout the camp and junior soldier shouted, 

“This man has betrayed the law of Angkar! He does not respect our commitment to this nation and is a spy for the old regime! Do not forget that Angkar works for us when we work for them!” 

I was taken to what I could assume was a field, and I could feel through my feet that I was at the edge of a dug out pit. I could only think of my sister. Who was going to protect her? The last thing I remember was a sharp pain to my head before everything went black. 

I thought I was dead, but I could still feel my body on top of what I assume with several over bodies and the smell of decay. I took off the blindfold and saw the viscera and gore, and then the sharp pain came back and I felt the blood dripping from the side of my head. I felt dizzy, but I needed to get out. I climbed on top of the bodies and climbed out of the pit, using every ounce of my strength to pull myself out and get out of there. 

Lightheaded, bleeding, and presumed dead, I hid in every bush and forest. I foraged whatever food I could get, heading north. Most of my journey was a blur, but I remember seeing people stepping on landmines and their cries of pain. Blood everywhere. I couldn’t go to help them. I just didn’t want to die, and I needed to get to safety. It took me several weeks on foot to reach the Thai border where I was put into a refugee camp. 

By that time, I was treated by Red Cross nurses and met my wife there for the first time. From 1977 to 1980, I lived in the refugee camp and decided to go back to find my sister. I had heard from those going back, after word rang out about the Khmer Rouge being defeated by the Vietnamese, that everyone was going back to Phnom Penh. I had to hope that my sister was going there too. My wife and I reached Phnom Penh, and it was empty despite those who came back. Houses and buildings were ransacked, streets littered with debris, and my sister nowhere in sight. 

At the market, I looked at the silent radio towers, and then I saw the old blind man. He was sitting by himself, silent. He had no sweets to give the children, and he looked like he hadn’t eaten in weeks. When I tried to tell my wife about him, my wife could only say, 

“Which one? I don’t see him…” 

We decided to start a new life in the United States, there was nothing left for us here. I became an English teacher and she became a nurse. I sometimes think of if my sister is still alive, and of the old blind man. Where were they now? So much was missing, and more unresolved. The ghosts of the past still live there in my mind. Every night, the empty eyes of the old man stare at me when I wait to sleep.
