Hello. The past three days since that night have been a swirl of packing, making calls, talking to managers, moving out and in, and trying to barely think about what happened, but I’m going to post this as a little insurance. That’s if I can even type it all out—every creak of flooring and every door slammed in my building feels like death.

I’m going to change the names around, but someone very close will reveal this is real if my company tries anything. I don’t think they really would, but I’m on such an edge right now I couldn’t get the thought out of my head. So here I am.

My name’s Riley, and I work as a night watchman. I’ve been trying to make a music career work, but the money hasn’t exactly been flowing. My bass player Mule—his real name’s Stan, but he carries our heaviest equipment so we call him Mule—and I got the job together, and for the last five months, it’s been great.

We’d work shows from evening till night, then we’d go to work and make our rounds talking about the band. The worst thing that ever happened was just stuff like snakes or birds tripping alarms. All of this is to say I would have been content to keep the routine for years, until Wednesday night.

The company I work for is pretty big and owns a lot of blue-collar sites, and the one I was working at is a nickel refinery. We don’t have many of them in the US, but the one I worked at is a pretty busy one. Anyway, we were probably halfway through our shift. Mule was in the parking lot, and I was heading up onto a catwalk above a pile of raw nickel. We were playing this game where one of us hums a song and the other has to guess the band.

“Hm hm hm… hm-hm-hm hm hm hm”

“It’s Queen, ‘Another One Bites the Dust.’”

Mule would usually throw me the basics. It sounds like a boring game, sure, but when it’s dark and every gust of wind or fallen leaf makes you jump, it helps ease your nerves. I was passing along the catwalk, losing to Mule as he guessed a Soundgarden song, when I started absentmindedly kicking bits of nickel.

Filtered rocks piled out from a sieve a little ways off the walk, but bits would still fall onto it. They would scrape across the metal and make a dull sound below:

*S*c*r*e*ec*h

**Thud**

Mule was checking out a truck for a second, so I was all alone. In those moments between words, you really have to force off any nerves and just pretend like you’re in control. I came to another rock:

S*c*r*e*ec*h*

**Thud**

When I say pretend to be in control, I just mean you have to throw off the “technicallys.” Technically, someone could be sneaking up behind me, but technically, if I turn my back, whoever’s waiting ahead could take their shot. Another rock:

*S*c*r*e*ec*h

**Thud**

The best you can do is just keep forward, hold your nerves, watch, and hope. I heard a bang of metal somewhere far off, and I began to listen in close. There was a final rock:

S*c*r*e*ec*h*

**Th-crack**

Hissssssss

My attention snapped below. I tried to tell myself that it was a snake, but a snake couldn’t hiss loud enough to hear from a catwalk. Besides, this noise was different.

“Hey Mule, I heard something weird. I think there’s some animal in the facility, I’m gonna go check it out.”

“Okay, sounds good. That truck was fine, by the way, someone just forgot to roll their windows down. I swear, man—”

He rambled on, but even with Mule talking, the silence was thicker. Sounds like the rattling of the stairs was actually eerie again, but I was still able to pretend it was nothing important.

I wasn’t too sure after I saw a large chunk of nickel, split in half, oozing with a grey, pungent slime that led away.

I radioed in and explained to Mule.

“...Really?”

“Yeah, man, come down here and look at this shit.”

Despite my instincts, I threw a look over my shoulder.

“I don’t want to deal with this alone. I think I might go ahead and radio in to the others.”

Mule and I were only junior watchmen, so we just got a taser and outside watch. The senior watchmen actually had guns and were assigned to the file rooms.

“Well, you know the rules—we only radio if something’s wrong.”

“Seems like something's wrong to me!”

“*Sigh.* Yeah, I meant like if we actually see something. I mean… what’s to say it’s not just some hibernating reptile or something?”

“Bro, it came out of solid rock.”

“Listen, just wait there. I’m heading your way. You’re in the East wing, right?”

“Yeah, I’ll be waiting here.”

Three agonizing minutes passed by as I waited. Three minutes of jumping at birds flying off, staring and darkly theorizing at the slime, and barely breathing to keep quiet. I almost had a heart attack when I was struck by Mule’s flashlight for the first time.

“What took you so long?!”

“Calm down, man, it’s not—*Whoa.*”

Mule flashed his light over the rock. I saw the fear creep its way over his face, but then he fought against it.

“Look, Riley, this is definitely freaky, but it’s our job to deal with stuff on our own before calling for backup.”

I stood there locking eyes with him, shifting on the spot. He had a point, sure, but I wish I’d had the spine to tell him no. Probably wouldn’t have changed anything, but still, it would’ve been better.

“You remember what happened to Jane? She had one false alarm, and they put her off duty for a week!”

“Okay. Okay, fine.”

I scanned around. Whatever was leaking out of the nickel only went a few meters beyond it.

“The trail leads down that way, but there’s a fork south and north. I’ll take south, alright?”

Mule scanned around a bit, trying to seem in control, before answering.

“Okay, sounds good.”

I remember getting some of my confidence back after regrouping with Mule. It really began to be feasible in my mind that this was some rare animal we hadn’t heard of. We went on our separate paths, and the paranoia began to eat over me once more. My radio sparked up:

“Hmmmmm hm hm hmmmhmm hmm—”

“Look! Now’s not the fucking time.”

“Alright, man, calm down. We’ll get this over with first.”

“Good, and besides, that was ‘Wayward Son,’ and you made it obvious.”

I found nothing—just some high-dollar equipment that wasn’t locked up. After I set it in its place, I radioed in.

“Mule, I’m not finding anything on my end. It probably is some kind of lizard or something. I’ll keep looking, but—”

“Riley,” he was speaking in a shaky whisper, “I found something. It looks like some kind of husk.”

“...What does it look like?”

“It’s like—oh shit!… WAIT W-WA—AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!”

The radio pierced my ear with static, but I didn’t bother to turn it off as I ran back the way I came, taser out. I found a break room trailer with the door open, but all was silent. I began to make my way over to the door, but suddenly a streak of shiny grey-black came hissing out of the darkness. I fired my taser the moment I saw it, without aiming first, and I put up my hands to brace. It hit me with more force than I expected from something so small, and I felt a wet, searing pain run over my arm. I dropped onto my back, and whatever it was ran off farther into the facility.

I was trying to catch my breath, but the pain in my arm was taking it away. I ran into the trailer and flipped the light on, but pain or not, the macabre and disgusting sight of Mule froze me for a moment. I ran over to the sink and ripped off my jacket and ran my arm under hot water.

Across my left forearm was a grey, shimmering slime, and though it was cold as ice, its acidity burned like hot steel. I only got hit with some residue off its body though, so I was able to wash it off. It hurt me to do so, but after I was done, I turned around.

There are many scenes from that night that will haunt me, but seeing Mule, laid out over the coffee table, eyes and mouth agape, in a petrified scream as the rest of his body was melting into shimmering goo and red slush, will hurt me for years to come. Even the band pins on his coat were melting—those were his favorite.

I went back outside and picked up the radio I’d dropped. I found it, too, had gotten a slash of acid, and was subsequently buzzing and chirping uselessly.

I had two options: hole up in the trailer and hope it didn’t come back, or make a break for the security office. My nerves were too shot to think clearly, but hours of loneliness with Mule’s disintegrating corpse was still a hard sell. Besides, I still had a job to do.

I started walking. Each breath and step felt like trying to soundlessly drag a bag of metal pans. At that point, it didn’t matter what the noise was; it made me jump and stand still all the same.

I wouldn’t say I’m not brave. I had respect from the other security workers, and I’ve handled myself well, but what are you supposed to do? Stay calm in the face of some unknown thing that’s as fast as a wasp and melts skin?

I began to pick up on a trail that, much to my nausea, was in the direction I was headed. Scenes like forklifts seared down to a third, discarded bits of flesh, and sickening pieces of molted grey skin began to pop up. I kept on, until I saw a reflective mound ahead.

One of the other watchmen, Ted, had been attacked. All that was left of him was bone, a few stray scraps of flesh, and his radio. I almost marveled at how fast this thing could pick someone apart while I clicked it on.

“Hello, this is Riley. Something’s loose in the facility, and I need help. I’m just outside the office, so meet me down here.”

No response. I set it on SOS and kept walking, but I soon heard a noise. It reminded me of a dog eating kibble, and when I rounded the corner, I saw it.

Most of it was just a dark grey silhouette, but I could make out many details. Somehow it had grown to be at least three meters. Its body was long and covered in shiny hairs that looked sharp as needles. Its arms—there had to be at least seven pairs—were busy probing over a pile of raw nickel. I watched it consume pounds and pounds of nickel as leftover flesh flicked off its sharp body. I was just standing there, peeking around an excavator, when my radio suddenly sounded.

“Hey, Rile—”

I snapped it off and ducked under the machine. The noise had ceased, and it became deathly quiet. Silent as it was, I could still hear it inching towards me. Under a half moon’s light, I could barely see the bottom of it over the long rubber wheels. Time had slowed down. Acid saliva dripping down seemed to take minutes, multiple legs piercing the soil beneath felt like hours, and then, when it was only a couple meters away, I began to hear its high-pitched hum.

“RILEY! WHERE YOU AT?”

“Tracker says he’s just over there.”

It sounded like my supervisor and some of the other senior watchmen. My heart sank when the thing flipped around and rushed towards them.

There was nothing I could do. I just sat there as my ears were barraged by the sounds of screams, a terrifying insectoid warble, and gunshots. When I heard the crunching of bone, I nearly began to cry.

The feeding was over quick, and I suppose it had forgotten about me because everything was silent before long. It still took some time to drag myself out though. Once more I was faced with a choice: stay there and wait to be hunted, or make for the security office where they lock our phones up for a shift. I chose the latter, and I suppose the guilt of my cowardice helped push me forward. I’ll spare you the details of the “leftovers,” but it’s enough to say the number of bodies only left me and some scattered junior watchmen.

I found the office undisturbed as I quickly bolted the door behind me. There’s a main tracking system that shows where each radio is in the facility. To my surprise, one of them—Leonard’s—was heading straight for the office. It then hurt me dearly to realize it was only me and him left. As the first light of day shone through the blinds, Leonard came smashing into the office door, and I think I almost gave him a heart attack when I unbolted it and popped out at him.

“AHHH!”

“It’s me, man, calm down!”

“R-RILEY! This fucking thing, it attacked me and Chris, and—”

“I KNOW, I KNOW! Just breathe and keep quiet, man!”

I pulled him in and locked up. We sat there unloading on each other.

“I can’t believe Mule’s dead, Riley.”

“I—I know.”

My thoughts turned to him. Rotting in that trailer, when we should be getting off to go sleep right now. I thought of our dreams, all our plans. Taken away. The only thing I could do for him now was to try and get this thing caught.

“Leonard, keep watch. I’m gonna go get my phone to call the cops.”

My hands were still shaking, so it took a few tries to get the combination lock off, but once I did, I dialed 911 faster than you can imagine. As I was beginning to explain things to a tired operator, Leonard’s face made me pause. He looked mortified.

I knelt down beside him and separated the blinds. There, at the end of the yard, we saw it. It was over twelve meters long and it was climbing over the fence, dragging a pair of legs with it. And, not far behind, something small followed. Something with shiny hairs and dozens of legs.

Once it was gone, the whole night and its implications finally dawned on me. These monstrous killers were loose, and I freed them. Someone else would have eventually, sure, but still. They could kill anyone in their way, guns apparently didn’t work on them, and they were breeding.

We kept our frozen position on that couch for hours until everyone arrived. After that, it all feels like one long sleepless dream. The company couldn’t have this out, so I guess some deals were made, because the next day the cops were reporting that a machine accident had taken out all the watchmen together in the office—all but me and Leonard.

I was in no state to perform, my best bandmate Mule was gone, and so my music career was certainly not high on my priorities. Besides, with all the stress and lack of sleep, I could barely think as they shoved papers and NDAs under my nose. I could lose my job, or I could take a serious pay raise on the other side of the country. I don’t know if it was the right decision, and I don’t know if going back on my word and posting this is either. But I still don’t want some suit deciding I’m not worth the risk and snuffing me out. Hopefully, this post protects against that.

I’m not sure where life is taking me now, but at least it’s away from that town, with those things. Maybe this all amounts to nothing but the death of a few good men—my good friends—but maybe those things are multiplying.

If they are, then be ready to hide.

And stay away from nickel refineries.
