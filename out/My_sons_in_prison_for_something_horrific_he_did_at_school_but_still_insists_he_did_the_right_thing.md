The visitation room is cold.

It’s a stark, blank space, where a glass wall separates us from the inmates and the only physical connection between a mother and her son happens through a gray telephone.

I sit on a hard plastic chair and wait for Adam to come in. I don’t even know what I’m supposed to feel.

Since he did what he did two weeks ago, it’s like my life has been put on pause and my body’s been stuck in a state of numbness. I haven’t seen him yet.

I watch him enter through the door, head down, the prison uniform clearly hanging off his 145-pound frame.

A tall, intimidating officer escorts him to the seat and stands guard behind him.

Through the glass, I stare at him, but he doesn’t look up right away. He’s ashamed—a mother knows.

We both pick up the phones.

“Hi, son,” I begin, keeping my voice neutral. “How are they treating you here?”

“It’s okay, mom,” he replies. “I probably deserve it.”

His answer catches me off guard, and we sit in silence for a few moments.

“I don’t understand why you did it,” I say, my control slipping as tears begin to well up in my eyes. “But I’ll always love you. You’re still my son.”

As soon as I finish speaking, he drops the phone, buries his head in his hands, and begins to sob uncontrollably. Like he did when he was 10.

Then he picks the phone up again.

“Those kids I killed at school, mom,” he begins. “You have to understand—they *deserved* it. They needed to be taken out the way they were.”

The officer behind him overhears the conversation and keeps a sharp eye on Adam.

“If they were bullying you, son, that’s terrible,” I tell him. “But that doesn’t mean they deserved to die and—”

“They weren’t bullying me!” he yells, cutting me off, his outburst drawing the attention of nearby inmates and visitors.

The guard steps in, grabbing him by the shoulder. “That’s enough, Adam. Time to go.”

“Mom,” he whispers through the line, before he is dragged out of the room. “You need to look into the glove compartment.”

\*\*\*

I walk out of the room, dazed.

Was my son paranoid? Hallucinating?

I storm out of the facility and get in my car.

The long drive back to the city is a blur. My mind spins: How didn’t I see this? How could I not have known what he could do? As a single mom, always tired from work, he just seemed like a quiet, geeky teen.

What snaps me back to reality is noticing a car that has been behind me since I left the prison. A black vehicle, driven by a clean-shaven, military-looking man in dark glasses, follows me. He looks eerily familiar to the guard from the visitation room.

I take several random turns and he stays on my tail. I pull into my neighborhood store. He parks at a distance, still in view.

I rush in, grab what I need, and get in line, still trying to make sense of what the hell is happening. Why is he following me? They already have Adam.

As I wait in line, I hear someone call my name from behind, and I jump in fright.

It’s not the man from the car, but I almost wish it were.

It’s a pale woman with a blank expression—Jenna, the mother of one of the three kids Adam killed at the school shooting.

I freeze.

“Hi, Claire,” she says.

It takes me a second. “Hi, Jenna. How are you?”

“Not very good,” she replies—not bitterly, just honestly. I flinch.

“Hey, I just want to say I’m really sorry for your loss,” I begin. “What my son did was unforgivable, and—”

“Claire, please,” she cuts in. “This isn’t your fault. We both lost our sons that day.”

She takes my hand in hers.

“From one mother to another,” she tells me, leaning in. “We need to help each other.”

Then she hugs me—so tightly I nearly collapse into tears. No one had shown me that kind of compassion until now.

I leave the store with new strength, ready to go straight to that car and confront the man who had been following me—but he’s gone. Thank God.

I get in my car and as I’m ready to get home, I remember Adam’s words, and I check the glove compartment. 

There’s nothing unusual in there except for a small metallic device. A flash drive.

\*\*\*

Back home, I go straight to my laptop. It’s already dark.

I know exactly why Adam would’ve hidden the USB drive in the car. His room, computers, phone, and even video game were all seized and searched the day after the events. Even my own laptop was taken—I had to get a new one from work.

What I don’t know is what he needed to hide.

My hands shake as I plug it in and open a folder full of images.

They’re photos of the three kids who died—mostly candid shots, capturing them in normal moments at school.

The same three always appeared: two boys and one girl. The pictures, likely taken on Adam’s phone, showed them eating lunch, walking home, studying at the library. Just ordinary stuff.

Was Adam stalking them? They didn’t look like bullies.

Then the photos start to get weird.

One of the boys, kissing a girl—someone else, not from the three—behind the football field. Holding hands. Private.

Then, suddenly, one set in a bleak concrete space. The three kids, soaked in blood, standing over what looked like the girl from before—dead. Her body ripped to pieces on the floor.

There was something strange in their eyes. In the photos, they were solid white.

I had to adjust in my chair, rattled.

Then more. The trio luring people. A janitor, an old woman, another child.

The last pictures in the folder showed them emerging from an alley, shirts stained red, those blank, glowing eyes again. The photos were clearly taken in hiding.

I nearly threw up. Was this what Adam meant? What are these kids and what were they doing?

That’s when I heard the noise of my front door opening.

“Is someone there?” I called out from my room. Only Adam and I lived here. I had no idea who it could be.

I get no answer, and the thought that it might be the man in the black car sent a chill down my spine.

I walked slowly down the hallway.

“I just called the police, so whoever you are, leave now,” I shouted, bluffing. My phone was in the kitchen.

When I reached the hallway, I saw a figure standing still at the front door.

It was Jenna. The mother of one of Adam’s victims. One of the kids in the photos.

“Jenna?” I asked, confused. “Do you need something?”

Her face was blank. Robotic. Emotionless.

She took a few steps toward me.

“I don’t know what Adam told you or what he left behind,” she said, voice flat. “But I can’t let you keep it.”

Then her eyes turned white, just like the three kids in the picture. 

And my body, desperate to run, couldn’t… move.

It just stood there, every muscle in me locked tight in the same position it was when her eyes changed. 

Even my eyelids stopped working—I couldn’t blink. I felt like a statue, except for my heartbeat, which had gone completely wild.

Jenna walked slowly, savoring my frozen panic.

“Don’t even try, Claire,” she said with a grin, now just five feet away. “Humans are such pathetic creatures.”

She raised her hands, and her fingers began to shift—turning into blades, thick and gleaming like solid steel.

That’s when I heard the gunshots.

Multiple. Quick. Jenna collapsed in front of me, riddled with bullets.

The man from the black car—the same guard who had stood with Adam—was behind her, holding a gun, his eyes locked on her body.

He must have fired six times. Jenna was lying in a pool of blood.

He stepped closer, still aiming at her head.

“Don’t do this, please. I’ll stay still,” she begged—but he pulled the trigger one last time.

That’s when my body unfroze, and I collapsed to the floor, gasping for air, sobbing uncontrollably.

The man knelt beside me and placed a hand on my shoulder, gently.

“Ms. Claire,” he said carefully, “I know this is a lot to process. But you’re not safe here. What your son uncovered... it’s not from this world.”
