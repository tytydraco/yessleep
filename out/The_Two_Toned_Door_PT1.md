All I remember was waking up from the strangest dream I had ever had. I wish it was a dream that I woke up from that immediately escaped my grasp. The agony that eclipsed me was more real than anything I had ever experienced in my waking life. Every detail so vivid, every smell, every breath, everything.. 

It all started with me walking down an endless road. A scene that seemed never ending. Every tree looked the same, every step felt like it had already happened. Until I came upon the crying man. He was a sight to behold in an endless void of trees and pavement. The first thing I had seen in what seemed like an eternity of endless road and forset. The man looked disheveled and as pale as the moon.

 One hand trembling over his covered face, the other behind his back grasped in a fist. His long white hair draped over his tattered old gray robe. As soon as I walked near him he peaked at me through his fingers with the hand covering his face. The sobbing stopped and I saw his old wrinkled mouth turn to a grin under his hand. He uncovered his face to reveal an unnerving sight. His left eye was covered in an endless pool of blood that never trickled or fell to the ground, but just kept flowing in and out of the skin that remained on his face. Before I could even process what I was looking at his smile widened and he said four words. "You're gonna need this." 


He quickly swung his left arm from behind his back and threw a small silver key at me; as i was tracking it and preparing to catch it, I caught the man in the corner of my eye dart into the woods laughing and mumbling something to himself. I heard the key rattle on the road and jumped back in surprise, completely distracted by the strange thing I had seen.

I couldn't even call it a man all I could see in my minds eye was the constant flow of blood pulsating and flowing in that creatures left eye. Somehow through the blood I could see a black piercing eye like a black hole. It felt as if you could get lost forever if you looked too closely at that one eye. The other eye was a bright blue almost Identical to my own eyes. I don't know what unsettled me more though his demeanor, the eye, or what he said. All I heard him mumble was a confusion of words "Two... Door... Key... for..." I had tried to chase after him but as soon as I stepped into the forset I was back where I had started at the beginning of the road.

 I only knew I was back at the beginning because I saw the sign I had forgotten about in the miles upon miles I had traveled in the same terrain. The sign simply read "Carter Davis." Seeing my name on the sign sent shivers down my spine. That's when i woke up covered in sweat. My left eye pulsing; fuck me another migraine. I went to work feeling like I didn't get a wink of rest. I punched in and then made my way to the break room to pour a cup of coffee. "Carter? Hello..? Dude you are dumping coffee everywhere!" Carter suddenly snapped back into reality lost in a day dream. "Stupid fucking woods I'm so sick of this!" Carter said not realizing he was speaking aloud.

 "Jesus fucking Christ Carter what the hell are you going on about? You're pouring coffee all over the counter! Your cups been full for a minute." Sorry Dale." Carter said snapped out of a trance. " You have the key no need to worry." Dale said softly. How the hell do you know about the key!" Carter snapped. "I said I need the keys for the dodge parked out front. What the hell is going on with you Carter you've been stuck in a daze since last week!?" " Shit, sorry Dale I've been sleeping less and less lately. I keep having strange dreams that keep haunting me." Carter said falling back into a trance. " They aren't dreams you stupid fuck, WAKE UP!!" Dale shouted. " I AM AWAKE!" I yelled back.

 "Carter I think you should go talk to Greg. Something isn't right with you, you might need to take some vacation time. All I said was " We need to get a move on to fix that truck." I don't know why the fuck you are yelling about being awake." Suddenly the ground began to shake like the greatest earth quake to hit the east coast was happening. Carter felt the ground give way beneath him and he felt himself falling until he fainted. When he woke up his eyes were glazed and he could barley make out a wooden sign. When he fully adjusted and opened his eyes he could only say two words. "Fuck me." The sign read "Carter Davis." This can't be real! It fucking can't be!!" 

Carter screamed hearing it echo into the woods along the dark paved road. He tried to run backwards for what seemed like 20 minutes. When he turned back around he froze in sudden horror. The sign was still right behind him and read " Wrong way Carter Davis!" The wrong way was written in what appeared to be blood. Carter looked down and saw his wrist was cut, not to bad but enough to cause blood to be running down his hand. His right middle and index finger had blood on it as if he had written this message with his own blood. " I was running the whole time, what the fuck is happening to me." Carter screamed again hearing nothing but his own echo.

 "This time you won't leave that easy." He heard a voice whisper right behind him. Carter whipped his head back but there was nothing but the never ending road and forest behind him. When he turned back ahead he jumped back with a yelp. " Use the fucking key god damn you!! The crying man roared in his face then lunged at Carter. The pulsating black hole of an eye right above his suddenly started spilling it's blood into Carters left eye. The crying man begin to screech and cry hysterically reaching through the blood pouring into Carters left eye and forced his hand cupped under Carters eye ball. Carter screamed and squirmed in pain as the crying man ripped out his left eye and put it in his own. "Perfect fit!" He said laughing and patting Carter on the back. 

"Now use the fucking key or next time I might take one of your balls instead." Carter woke up to his boss Greg shaking him so violently he fell out of the chair in the break room and spilled his coffee all over himself. "Look at yourself Carter, see what happens when you don't use the key? How many times do we have to go over this!" Greg said concerned. " What the fuck do you want from me!! Fuck you and fuck the stupid key!" Carter screamed. Greg frowned and slowly pulled up a chair while Carter still sat on the ground covered in coffee. "Carter I think it would be best if you went home maybe took a week off and set your mind right. You've been falling asleep more than you've been working lately and all you seem to focus on is some god damn key. 

Now listen kid you've been one hell of a mechanic and I look at you like a son. All I said was look at yourself Carter see what happens when you don't get some sleep, and you are jumping out of your pants. Go home get some rest and call me when you are ready to work. For now I think you are better off straighting yourself out before you come back to work. I care about you kid take care of yourself and come back when you get some rest and a clear head." "Thank God I still have both my eyes, but God damn this migraine is gonna kill me." Carter muttered. "What was that son? " Greg asked. " Uhh I said I think you're right Sir, I'm sorry I haven't felt like myself lately." Greg smiled and gave Carter a pat on the back. Carter recoiled thinking of the crying man and grabbing at the left side of the face. Greg gave him another concerned look and told him to be on his way and get some rest. " please make sure you get yourself right before coming back. You always have a job here kid." Greg said the concern but love in Greg's voice almost brought Carter to tears.

 Greg was 70 years old and had owned Greg's autoshop since he was 20 years old. He said short military cut salt and pepper hair. Always dressing in a mechanics uniform worh his name on his left breast. His face was rather smooth and if he didn't tell you he was 70 you wouldn't believe it. Carter was an only child and when his dad passed away his best friend (Greg) took Carter under his wing. Ever since he was 15 all Carter had known was working on cars.

 He wasn't very social and mostly just kept to himself besides work. This was very hard for him to except. Losing the one thing that kept him grounded. He knew Greg was right and he needed to address his problems but he didn't know how. (" That's not true it starts with the key you idiot") he said to himself. Except no that wasn't right it wasn't him saying it. Not exactly.. but who? "Son are you gonna be able to drive home? You're spacing off again." " Oh sorry Mr. Pistle I'll be alright i just appreciate you looking out for me." Carter was halfway home when the ground started shaking again. 

His car sucked into an endless void until it ripped apart pulling him alone deeper and deeper. He felt his body slam into the pavement and when he opened his eye he realized something wasn't right. The pain was unbearable, he could only see out of his right eye. He put his hand up to his left eye and when he pulled it back all he saw was blood. Then you looked around and realized he was back in his own living hell. Or was it living? What the fuck is happening to me. He thought barley able to concentrate over the migraine. Wait not a migraine I lost my fucking eye Jesus christ this can't be happening! He fell to his knees and began to cry, when he wiped his eyes all he saw was blood. This was way to real, the pain was way to real. The vision loss eas way to real. The sign and the endless road and forest was way to real. "I'm breaking." He whispered to himself.
