[Part Five: Why The Little People Are Real]


They’re real.

I don’t care what you think. What I used to think. I know what I felt. I know what I saw. The things in that chamber didn’t come from my imagination. They touched me. They hurt me.

And they’re still down here.

I don’t know how long I lay there after they disappeared. Could’ve been minutes. Could’ve been hours. The cold seeped into my body, mixing with something — I don’t know what from.

From fear. From pain. From exhaustion. From the weight of knowing I’d been wrong.

I was shaking down to my bones.
T still hadn’t come back.

I called his name once. Just once. It echoed off the stone like it didn’t belong to me anymore.

I tried to sit up, but pain shot through my leg like glass under the skin. I had to bite my tongue just to muffle my screams.

I don’t know where they went, but I didn’t want them to know I was awake.

“I can’t wait any longer, T…” I said softly, preparing myself for what was coming next.

You can do this.
You have to do this.
I need to get out of here so T doesn’t have to come back.
I have to make sure he doesn’t face these things for my sake.
Like I know he would.

Eventually, I started to crawl. Elbows, then forearms, dragging myself inch by inch toward where I thought the tunnel was. Everything was a blur — my thoughts, my sense of direction, even time. I was still clutching the flashlight out of instinct, but it hadn’t worked since the things left. I thumbed the switch out of habit. Nothing.

Just darkness. Not the kind that just surrounds you — but the kind that smothers.
The kind that sticks to you, almost like a second skin you can’t peel off.

Behind me, I heard something shift.

A shuffle. Then the distinct sound of breathing. But not like a person’s breath. It was shorter. Quicker. Like a dog panting through its nose.

I froze. Holding mine.

It moved again. Pebbles skipped across stone. Then another sound — like fingers tapping rhythmically. One-two. One-two-three. One-two.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I couldn’t take their taunting.

I turned over and screamed into the dark.

“S—stop it! STOP!”

The cave answered with laughter. Not loud. Not human. Dozens of little throats giggling just out of reach. A skittering wave of sound moving up the walls and across the ceiling like insects with teeth.

I kept crawling.

I don’t know how far. I don’t know where I was going. Just that I had to move. My leg dragged behind me uselessly, and I could feel it bumping against the rocks, raw and exposed.

At some point, I brushed against something soft.

My bag.

I grabbed it like a drowning man reaching for rope. Tore it open, dumped everything out with shaking hands until I felt the familiar shape of the battery pack.

I jammed them into the flashlight, flipped the switch.

Nothing.

I shook it. Slammed it against the floor. Clicked and clicked and clicked until the plastic cracked under my thumb.

Still nothing.

The breathing came back. Closer now. Right at the edge of the space I occupied. Like someone crouching just a few inches from my face, watching me with eyes that could see in the dark.

Then — hot air against my ear.

“Don’t leave.”

I screamed and threw the flashlight. It hit the rock and clattered off into the dark. I scrambled forward on hands and elbows, feeling stone and dust and sharp ridges tear at my palms.

Behind me, the sounds changed.

No more laughter.

Just footsteps.

Running. Fast. Too fast for something that small. The kind of speed that belongs to nightmares. Dozens of feet slapping against the stone, closing the gap between us. Their rhythm was off — like they moved in unison, but not quite perfectly.

I cried out, forced my body to keep moving.

Ahead, I felt the stone rise — it was the narrow slope we’d slid down hours before. I clawed at the walls, fingernails cracking, teeth clenched through the pain in my leg. I got maybe two feet before something grabbed at my ankle.

Hard. Sharp. Like little claws digging in just enough to hold.

I kicked. Screamed. Lashed out with my good leg, felt my boot connect with something soft and brittle.

Then silence.

Then hissing.

It wasn’t air or wind. It was their voices. High-pitched. Layered. Saying things I didn’t want to understand.

“Lost child lost child lost child”
“Too loud, too loud, go back go back”
“Her turn. His turn. Your turn.”

I kept moving.

I crawled until my arms went numb. Until the pain in my chest drowned out the pain in my leg. I crawled because I had to. Because the only thing more terrifying than dying down here was letting them take me.

The tunnel tightened again.

I shoved myself into it. A jagged edge tore into my shoulder, but I didn’t care. I crawled like an animal, mouth open, gasping, sobbing into the dark. I could feel hands scraping at the soles of my boots. Tiny nails. Fingers tugging at the threads.

The noise followed me.

No words now. Just shrieking. Animal shrieking. Like metal scraping against rock. Chittering like laughter turned inside out.

I felt blood trickling down my neck from my head.

I didn’t know if it was fresh or from earlier.

I didn’t stop.

I didn’t stop.

I didn’t stop.




——————-




I don’t know how long I had been crawling.

Time doesn’t exist down here. It was just the stone beneath me, the sweat, blood, and tears I poured as I crawled for my life with something, somethings following.

Not mocking anymore. Not laughing. Not whispering.

Now they started growling.

Low. Guttural. Dozens of tiny voices layered together like a throat filled with gravel. Every few minutes I felt one of them touch me. A tug on my shirt. A scratch across my calf. Then harder. Nails biting into skin. Something small but strong yanking my broken leg hard enough to make me scream.

It was like they were right behind me and I was, somehow, just barely out of reach.

They’re not playing anymore.

They’re going to kill me.


I can hear them behind me. The scuffle of bare feet. Hands slapping the stone in a slow rhythm. 

Slap-slap-slap-slap. 

And always that same copper smell, getting stronger with every foot I crawl forward. Like pennies soaked in heat.

It’s them. I know it’s them.
Their scent. Their hatred.
Surrounding me.

I kept my head down, shoulder dragging against the stone as I clawed my way up into the narrow tunnel, the one we came through. The one we should’ve left through, together.

That’s when I saw it.

The flashlight. Sitting just inside the tunnel.

Not mine.

T’s.

At least, I think it was.

Why would he leave it?

I scrambled toward it, half-mad with panic.
My hand reached out but it landed in something wet…

Thick. Sticky. It smeared across my palm, warm and viscous. It clung to the stone like sap. The copper smell was overpowering now, and it was in my mouth, my nose, my throat.

I couldn’t breathe.

But I didn’t have time to think about it for too long.

I heard them closing in.

Not whispering. Not chanting.

Roaring.


Dozens of them. Hundreds maybe. Their voices rising into shrill, angry shrieks like swarms of furious insects. The tunnel around me vibrated with the sound. The blood beneath me began to feel hot, like it was boiling under my skin.

They were coming.


All of them.



I grabbed the flashlight, fumbled with the switch, and just as the sound reached its fever pitch. 
Like they were about to pounce, about to devour me whole, leaving not even my bones…

The beam flicked on.

And there was… 

Nothing.



Silence.



The tunnel was empty. No figures. No skittering. No shrieking. Just me.

Panting. Trembling. Alone.


I stared into the dark ahead of me, waiting. Certain they’d come pouring in. That they were just hiding from the light.

But they didn’t.


My hands were shaking.

What game were they playing this time?

Was I not afraid enough for them yet?

Did I not suffer enough for their liking?

Where did they go? What are they doing?

I kept asking myself, pointing the flashlight in every direction.

And then I finally noticed…


Blood.


Everywhere.


Thick streaks of it across my forearms. My shirt soaked through. My jeans smeared with it, caked into my palms, between my fingers. I hadn’t noticed before, it blended with the pain, with the dust.

But now, in the light…

I turned.

Slowly.

The beam traced the curve of the tunnel behind me, over the walls, over the floor… and then down.

That’s when I saw the cave-in.

The tunnel was sealed.

And just beneath the largest stone was a boot.

A familiar boot.


T’s boot.


The rock hadn’t just fallen. It had buried him.

At least, that’s what it seemed like…

But,

I knew better.

I know the TRUTH now.


The blood trailed down from the blockage. Too much blood. Thick pools of it running under the rocks, soaking into the dust.

No.

That’s not a cave-in. That’s not what this is.

I see it now.

They got him.

THEY GOT T.


The Little People dragged him into a tunnel too narrow for his body, shredding his limbs as they tried to pull him through. Tore him apart piece by piece while he screamed my name.

My hand trembled so hard the flashlight jittered in my grip. I pressed my back against the wall, stared down at the blood-soaked stones.

He was supposed to be safe.

He was supposed to be out of here.

He was supposed to have left to get help.

But now I see…

I left him.

I sent him to die.

He wanted to stay together…

He wanted to leave TOGETHER.

I felt the scream tear its way out of my throat.

A cry of pure agony.
A cry laced with regret.

And a pain so deep it bore a hole in my chest, never to be filled again.

I cried for I don’t know how long.
Sobbing uncontrollably in my brother, my best friend’s blood. The only family I had left.

At some point, I even started trying to dig him out, but… it was futile.

He was gone.

And in the absence, filled sorrow and pain.
And one other thing.

Rage.

It started as just a flicker in a void of sadness.

But as reality settled in, and the awareness of my situation returned…

It became a blaze.


“COME ON THEN!”

My voice cracked.


“You want me? You want me?! COME AND GET ME!”


“COME. GET. ME. YOU. FUCKS.”


The tunnel didn’t answer.


“Come on, you sick little freaks!”

“I’m not scared of you!”

“I FUCKING HATE YOU.”

“I HATE YOU!”

“I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU!”

I started to push myself back down to the chamber.
My rage only grew, building with more and more intensity once I entered the space again.

I stood. 

Or tried to.

My leg screamed.
I collapsed back down but kept the flashlight high, pointed into the black.

“I’m not scared! I’M. NOT. SCARED!”

I turned the light off.

And the dark swallowed me whole.


Silence.


Then,

the rhythm returned.

Slap-slap-slap-slap.

Getting closer.

Slap-slap-slap-slap.

Louder. Faster.

SLAPSLAPSLAPSLAPSLAPSLAP

They were coming.

I gritted my teeth. Clenched my fists.
Nails digging so deep, blood dripped from my hands.

I wasn’t going to run.
I wasn’t going to hide.

Not this time.

I was going to fight.

For T.
For S.
For every story I ever scoffed at, every warning I ever ignored.

“Come on,” I whispered. “COME ON!”

The sound hit its peak — a wall of feet, hands, shrieks, claws, rage.

And then—




LIGHT.




Blinding. Sudden. White.


So bright it burned through my closed eyes.


I screamed, fell backward, covered my face.
The flashlight clattered out of my hand.


And just like that—




It was silent again.




————————-




I came back to the world slowly.

It wasn’t like waking up from sleep.
It was more like surfacing from drowning.
My lungs burned. My tongue felt like it was wrapped in cotton. My limbs were stone. For a moment, I wasn’t sure I had a body at all.

Then the pain reminded me.

A dull, constant throb in my leg.
A tighter pressure behind my eyes, like something had taken root and refused to let go.

My vision shimmered.

The room around me was unfamiliar. Too sterile. Too white.

A hospital?

I tried to move. My hand twitched against the stiff sheet, and something tugged at the crook of my arm.

An IV.

A monitor beeped softly to my left.

I pushed myself upright.

That was a mistake.

As soon as I tried to swing my legs over the edge of the bed, fire shot through my shin and I crumpled with a shout.
My leg buckled and folded beneath me.

The door burst open.

Two nurses were there in seconds, calling out for help as they pulled me up and laid me back down.
I was too stunned to resist.
My head spun. My throat burned.

“You’re alright,” one of them said.
“Just stay still.”

I didn’t respond.
I barely heard them.
I was already losing myself back to unconsciousness.



A doctor came in later.
He wore a navy sweater under his white coat and spoke softly, like he was used to giving bad news.

“You were found three days ago,” he said, reading from a clipboard.”

“You were unconscious when they brought you in. You had severe dehydration, a concussion, and a fractured tibia.”

“We also detected high levels of carbon monoxide in your blood. Likely from extended exposure in a poorly ventilated space.”

His voice didn’t match the weight of what he was saying.

It was too calm. Too practiced.

“You had multiple lacerations across your arms, back, and legs. Likely from crawling over sharp surfaces. Your scalp was torn in places, possibly from scraping against stone.”

He flipped the page. Didn’t look at me.

“The carbon monoxide exposure was extensive. You’re lucky you weren’t down there any longer.
Symptoms at your level include confusion, auditory, visual hallucinations, and disorientation. And you came in pretty disoriented, so that may help explain what you remember. If you remember anything at all.”

I did.

Too much.

The doctor asked a few more questions.
Just simple things.
My name. My birthday.
I got most of them right.

He nodded, wrote something down, and left.



It wasn’t until a few hours later that the police came.

There were two of them.
One spoke, the other stood quietly with a notepad.

“You were found near the east lower ridge and somehow ended up deep in an unexplored cave system,” the lead officer said.
“That area’s restricted. Closed for months now. You’re aware of that?”

I nodded, slowly.

“Well,” he sighed, “the good news is: you’re not under arrest.
The pipeline company’s still deciding whether they’ll press charges, but given your condition…”

He let that trail off.

“There was active excavation going on in that area,” he continued.

“Test charges. Seismic probes. Rotary drilling.
That whole section of the mountain was unstable, which is why it was fenced off.
There were multiple controlled detonations the morning you were found.
We think the vibrations from the explosions and heavy equipment may have caused the cave-ins you experienced.”

The other officer flipped through his notes.

“We spoke with the pipeline crew,” he added.
“They said they heard someone shouting. That’s how they found you, through a breach in the southern wall.
One of the chambers must’ve connected to the old mine access they were working through.
They said you were barely conscious, covered in blood, crawling through a small passage.”

I stayed quiet.

The first officer’s expression softened, and I could see the pity growing on his face, like he was about to give bad news.

I knew what he was about to say.

“There was another man with you,” he said.

“He… didn’t make it.”

“We found him buried under a partial collapse near the crawlspace. His hands and fingers were worn… it looked like he’d been trying to dig his way out.”

“I’m sorry.”

I didn’t say anything.


They asked me some more questions.

I gave them the short version: we went in. A collapse happened. Got trapped. That was it.

They nodded and finally left me alone.




The room was too quiet after that.
The kind of quiet that presses on your ears.

I stared at the ceiling for a long time.
Watching it blur.
Letting the silence stretch.

I didn’t cry.
I didn’t scream.
I just… listened.

Some part of me still expected to hear them.
The tap tap tap of small feet.
The scraping.
The whispers.

But there was nothing.

The logic came back slowly.
The explanations lined up.

Monoxide. Head trauma. Exhaustion. Panic.

Everything could be explained.
Everything was explained.

But that didn’t make it feel any less real.


I kept thinking about what T had said.
Over and over again:

“You still don’t get it, do you?”

I do now.

The Little People weren’t real.
Not in the way I thought.
But that doesn’t make the stories false.

The stories exist because something happened.
Because someone got lost.
Because someone never came home.
And the people they left behind,
the people left wondering why they didn’t come back, needed a way to make sense of it.

So they told stories.
They gave shape to the dark.
They taught children to stay out of places where the earth breathes heavy and the shadows don’t echo right.

And we… I laughed.
Snot-nosed brats like me.
We called them fairy tales.

But T didn’t.

He understood.

Whether he actually believed in monsters or not didn’t matter.

What mattered was he understood why our people made them.

He was right.

I didn’t get it.
I mocked the stories.
I mocked him.

And now he’s gone.

And I’m still here,
broken and sitting in silence,
still listening for the footsteps that will never come.

But I remember now.
I remember everything.

And I believe.

Not in the Little People.
Not in magic.

But in what they meant.

Because T died trying to protect me.
And the stories—the ones I spent my whole life mocking, were trying to do the same.

And I didn’t listen.

But I will now.







[Update]


It’s been over a decade now.

Since the cave.
Since the voices.
Since the blood.

Since I watched one cousin vanish forever,
and sent the other to die.

And I haven’t left the rez since.

Everyone was surprised.
Hell, I was too.
But something about leaving didn’t feel right anymore.
Maybe it never did.

And once I started putting things back together,
cleaning up my grandmother’s place,
fixing fences, running the food drives she and T used to run, the more I started to see what they saw in all of this.

I feel silly for ever leaving.

That probably doesn’t mean much to some of you.

But I spent years running from this place.
I left as soon as I could. 
College, work, white collar stuff.
Anything to forget where I came from.
Anything to forget S.
Anything to forget the night she went missing in a place we weren’t supposed to be, chasing legends I thought were just spooky stories.

I spent years mocking T for clinging to tradition.
For honoring stories I thought were useless.

And still, he followed me into hell just to keep me safe.


And he didn’t come back.


I live in grandma’s house now.
Keep the fence mended, the wood stacked,
the old smudging shell on the windowsill just where she left it.
I sit on the tribal council.
I work with the youth program.
I teach the stories the old way. 
Face-to-face, no script.
Just breath, memory, and meaning.

I tell them about the Little People.

Not because I believe.

Because that’s not the point anymore.

I tell them because the stories were never just about what was real.
They were warnings.
Culture.
Memory.

They were the closest thing we had to law before there was law.

And they still are.

Whether the Little People exist or not doesn’t matter.

What matters is we act like they do.

Because that’s tradition.
And tradition is survival wrapped in story.

We as a people die when our tradition dies.

And tradition dies with us.



Some nights, I still dream about the cave.

I still dream about them.

About the scraping.
The whispers.
The breath on my neck when the light went out.
Sometimes I dream about T’s voice yelling for me from just down the tunnel, begging for help, but I’m too far to reach.

I wake up sweating, heart racing, still half-expecting to see those little shadows watching from the corners.

But they’re never there.

What is there, every morning, is my job.

To keep these kids grounded.
To keep our stories alive.
To build something T would’ve been proud of.

And every time I stand in front of them, these kids, these grandkids of the same blood that built our Nation, I remind myself:

I do this for S.
I do this for T.

They’re the reason I stopped running.
They’re the reason I started building.

I don’t light candles.
I don’t talk to graves.
I don’t send prayers out into the night, hoping their spirits hear me.

But every choice I make,
every policy I fight for,
every kid I talk out of leaving,
every mural we paint,
every language class we fund,

that’s for them.

Not out of guilt.

Out of love.


I didn’t survive the cave. Not really.

The person who came out of there was someone new.

Someone finally willing to listen.

So now I listen.

And when the kids ask if the Little People are real…

I smile.

And I say,

“Of course they are.”

Because T would’ve said the same thing.

And that’s good enough for me.
