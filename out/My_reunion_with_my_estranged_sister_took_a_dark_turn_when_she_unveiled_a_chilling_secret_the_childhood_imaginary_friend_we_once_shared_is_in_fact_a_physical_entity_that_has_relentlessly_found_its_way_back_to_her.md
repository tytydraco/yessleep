PART 1

There is no greater horror than the prospect of being confined within the same room as my sister, Claudia – older by two years. I can watch any horror film and sleep like a baby through the night, no problem, but put me in a room with my sister for more than five minutes and, well, I’d rather take my chances against Freddy Kreuger after overdosing on a full bottle of melatonin. The last time Claudia and I co-existed on somewhat civil terms was a few years ago on Christmas, so it was more of an obligation than genuine volition. That was the last time we spoke but going long periods of time with little to no communication is pretty standard routine for us. Though, I’m pretty sure this is the longest we’ve ever gone without speaking, which made her out of the blue ambiguous text message even more abnormal. I woke up to the text this morning. Cryptic in simplicity, it read, “My place. Tomorrow. 7 pm.” Naturally, I assumed the message was intended for someone else but I decided to capitalize on my sister’s error and seize the opportunity to reconnect. 

I’m about to press the call button when I’m gripped by an intrusive thought – If I don’t rub my nose three times, this phone call will spiral into a heated argument. I’m completely aware of the irrationality embedded within the belief that the fate of my relationship with my sister is determined by scratching my nose, but I submit to my OCD anyway and rub my nose three times to quell my impending anxiety. Distress alleviated, I dial the call button and brace myself for my sister’s monotone hello, which I will reciprocate with an equivalent, “hi” - a ritual in our strained relationship. The phone rings once, followed by a slow, labored breathing from the other end of the line.

“Hello?” I utter, my words tinged with a palpable anxiety. 

The breathing stops, replaced with a heavy silence that stretches into an eerie, indefinite pause. 

“Claudia?” I insist, my voice reflecting my confusion. 

“I found you,” a haunting whisper punctuates sharply.

Before I could even muster a response, she abruptly hung up on me, marking the unsettling end to our first conversation in years. 

It’s now 6:47 pm, which means I’m already late. She’ll roll her eyes when I walk through the door and complain that I have no sense of urgency. Fact of the matter is, I’m a very punctual person but when it comes to premeditated interactions with Claudia, I’ve developed specific instincts. Stalling becomes an involuntary response – a means of self-preservation against the looming threat that is my older sister. What can I say? I'm an evolved organism. Three decades of navigating our unique predator-prey relationship, characterized by verbal onslaughts and brief episodes of abandonment have cultivated an arsenal of defense mechanisms that inhibit me from venturing anywhere near my sister’s orbit. It would be akin to putting a defenseless goat in a malnourished lion’s den. 

It’s unfathomable we’re of the same species and share the same strands of DNA. We share nothing in common besides the dark Italian features inherited from our deadbeat father, who some would argue, I have the most resemblance to. My sister is a hybrid between our parents, with distinctive traits of my mom’s Latina side – dusk complexion, voluptuous figure and fiery disposition (to put it mildly). Her eyes, a deep chocolate hue, boast an alluring, feline slant, which is a stark contrast to my own amber-brown, doe-like gaze. One thing neither of us inherited, thankfully, is our mother’s alcoholism. Nonetheless, we each carry our own burdens entwined within our divergent identities. 

I, for instance, have self-diagnosed hypochondriasis supplemented with mild OCD, also self-diagnosed. It doesn’t conform to the clichèd depiction of OCD, where everything needs to adhere to a particular order or where every surface needs to be pristine enough to dine off of. My OCD is a quieter variant that I’ve become adept at concealing from the prying eyes of the world. IF I went to therapy, they would attribute my need for a sense of control to my upbringing but I think I arrived into this world with these tendencies already etched into my being. I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember. I’m not anti-therapy. It’s just not for me. 

My sister, on the contrary, loves therapy, solely for the fact that she can cast herself as the victim and not only will someone lend a sympathetic ear while simultaneously validating her self-pity but then prescribe a pharmaceutical remedy to temporarily mask her depression instead of addressing the root of the underlying issue. Pharmaceutical intervention is another area our views differ. She places her trust in Western Medicine, while I opt for a holistic lifestyle approach. Beyond my fear of inheriting the genetic predispositions that plague my family – alcoholism, dementia, muscular sclerosis – I’m tormented by the idea of how every morsel I consume affects my wellbeing and the sculpted physique I put in a tremendous effort to maintain.  

Aside from our disparities in physical attributes and idiosyncrasies, the most profound difference is reflected in our recollections of childhood. For me, childhood is entwined with memories of playing outside until the veil of night shrouded the dense New England forest that encompassed our house. Meanwhile, the memories of my sister’s own accord are solely the unpleasant ones. Some may even deem them as downright terrifying but you become desensitized to the bumps in the night after a while. I’d say at around age twelve, the cacophony of banging and screaming that reverberated through the walls of our family home had become as commonplace as the rhythmic drone of my father tending to the lawn every Sunday morning. Our parents aren’t bad people. They’re just not the best communicators. Their words were often verbal daggers underlined by indelible markings or throwing objects at one another. My sister and I handled these situations differently. I sought refuge in movies or drawing, remaining ignorant to the happenings outside of my bedroom. Claudia, on the other hand, would eavesdrop behind closed doors, a detrimental habit that endured until Angeline entered the picture. 

Angeline was my sister’s imaginary friend who inevitably transformed into my own imaginary confidante, as is the nature of sibling dynamics  – what one sister possesses, the other has to have. Up until Angeline, you couldn’t pay us to share anything. I outgrew the imaginary friend phase long before Claudia did. She clung to Angeline until around fifteen or so, when she officially declared herself too old for such things. Still, every now and then, I would inadvertently overhear her engaged in a hushed conversation with Angeline when she thought no one was listening. Oh shit. It’s 6:58 pm now. I should probably feign that I caught the plague at this point. I better get going. Wish me luck. Please file a missing persons report if you don’t hear from me soon. 

LATER - 7:24 PM 

I should be sprinting up the cobblestone steps to Claudia’s modern Connecticut home because I’m late and my sister is going to murder me but instead, I opt for a leisurely gait. I would have arrived by 7:15 pm if I wasn’t hit with the compulsion to ensure that I locked the door. Anxiety clenches my chest as I approach my sister’s front door and – what the fuck is that smell? Is that me? I take a subtle whiff under my armpit in case my sister is watching me. Fuck, it is me. I didn’t notice the extent of my profuse sweating until now. That’s what I get for running up and down the stairs to my front door seven goddamn times like a goddamn maniac. Bracing myself for the worst, I inhale deeply, mustering the courage to knock on the door when I realize it’s slightly ajar. 

“Claudia?” I call out, which is met with silence, prompting me to let myself in. 

Standing in the foyer, I scan the environment and suddenly, I’m having a difficult time breathing. The air feels stuffy in here. It feels similar to when I was a kid and struggled with asthma. I entered remission in my late teens, during which it completely vanished. The cause, I suspect, was secondhand smoke, as both my parents were chain smokers. I steady my breathing and saunter into the dimly lit living room. The layout is pretty standard, embodying my sister’s vanilla taste, which makes this recently developed contemporary building feel even more austere than it already is. 

“Claudia?” My voice cracks as I call out her name. I swallow my nerves and listen for an indication of her location. 

No response. Unable to quell the urge, I delve into Claudia’s personal belongings, secretly hoping to stumble upon blackmail. The walls are punctuated with family photos, none of which I am featured in – rude. The observation strikes a chord within, though its impact doesn’t penetrate as deeply as one might expect. I’ve grown numb to this brand of sibling treatment after all these years.

I continue exploring the space when my foot collides with something. Startled, I glance down to find a sleek Roomba vacuum. I admire my sister’s innovative laziness for a brief moment before I power up the dutiful robot, causing the directional light to cascade a ten-foot radius of illumination. In a matter of seconds, it zooms underneath the TV console, embarking on a programmed quest for dust mites. I realize how filthy my sister’s place is as I watch the Roomba zoom around with graceful determination. Dust bunnies scatter in its wake, like fleeing creatures of the darkness exposed to the light. When was the last time my sister cleaned? My hypochondria starts to kick in and I suddenly feel the onset of an allergic reaction. Another evolutionary defense mechanism, perhaps. Evacuate now before it’s too late.

The Roomba continues its silent crusade, inching closer toward its ultimate goal as it glides effortlessly across the worn out carpet. I track the vacuum’s movements as it maneuvers around obstacles with ease, gradually swallowing the remnants of time’s passage and markers of my sister’s incomprehensible lifestyle. Having exhausted its efforts in the living room, the autonomous waste-collecting robot disappears into the adjoining room, leaving behind a spotless surface.

I deviate my attention to the bookshelves where a series of untouched literature intertwine with frequently revisited titles, leather bounds worn by time and usage. I never took my sister for an avid reader. I pull one tattered book after the other – ‘Heaven’s Threshold: The Enigma of Faith and Despair”, “Resurrection of the Soul: Faith Beyond Dogma” and a bible, precariously encroaching into the empty space left by a missing book. I take a moment to digest this new tidbit of knowledge about my sister. Following the path of God was forced on us from a young age but we weren’t exactly the zealous Christians who dutifully attended mass every Sunday. Perhaps I’m projecting my own struggles with religion.

I return the bible to the bookshelf and allow my gaze to meander towards a display of meticulously curated family heirlooms. An assembly of porcelain dolls stand in a line, all facing the same direction, their backs ominously turned. I spin one around, only to find its features grotesquely distorted. It gives me the heebie-jeebies. I seize another doll and turn it around to reveal its head devoid of hair and empty eye sockets. Why does my sister have a set of creepy dolls? Better yet, why has she suddenly embarked on a devout spiritual journey? I come to the stark realization that there’s a significant gap in my understanding of my sister - an inevitable consequence of enduring extended periods of mutual silence for years at a time. I move to return the doll back to its original position when suddenly, a rhythmic pounding fills the space. The sound repeats itself, each bang more persistent than the last. 

“Claudia?” I call out nervously. 

I pursue the noise with caution into the kitchen and flick the light on to find the Roomba seemingly possessed as it relentlessly smashes into the wall, determined to retrieve a mere speck of dust lodged into the corner. A wave of calmness washes over me. I kneel down to deactivate the vacuum when I hear a voice that sends chills down my spine.

“What are you doing here?”

Startled, I spin around to meet my sister’s piercing glare. I barely recognize the person standing in front of me. She’s rail-thin with gaunt features enveloped by dull skin. 

“Cheezus crust, Claudia. You scared the hell out of me.” I mutter, my relief tinged with lingering anxiety. 

I take an instinctive step toward her for a hug and pause in my tracks. Do we hug now? We’ve never really been the hugging type. Her failure to reciprocate my awkward gesture confirms that we are still not the hugging type. The air is thick with the weight of our shared history – a mixture of happy and painful memories. I immediately regret my impulsive bid for affection, but it’s too late and I’m here now so I grab her frail arms and words slip out like water from a broken dam.

“Have you lost weight? You’re so tiny, I could flick you and break you in half.” I quip, and without much thought, I flick her right in the boob. The action surprises me as much as it does her, and now she’s glaring at me with an intense, dagger-like gaze. I scramble to retreat. 

“Sorry. I don’t know why I just did that.” I mumble.

Uneasy silence lingers between us as I lock eyes with my sister’s withering stare for a long uncomfortable moment until she grabs the Roomba and moves to return it to the charging station. I take another stab at initiating conversation as I follow her into the living room. I talk a lot when I’m nervous. 

“What I mean is… I haven’t seen you in a really long time and you’re just a lot skinnier than I remember…” I falter for a brief instance, grappling to find the right words. “It’s really good to see you.”

She turns to meet my gaze and I brace myself for what’s inevitably coming – her declaration that this was a mistake and she wants to sever all ties with me (again). 

“It’s good to see you too.” she murmurs, a slight curl at the edge of her lips. I wouldn’t classify it as a genuine smile, but it’s progress and I’ll take what I can get. 

Our eyes lock and years of tension seem to dissolve as we share a small awkward laugh. The love we once shared, buried beneath layers of wounded surfaces. An abrupt stifled thud emanates from upstairs, intruding on the sentimental moment. I glance at Claudia, who tenses at the sound. 	

“What was that?" I inquire, my words laced with suspicion.  

"I didn't hear anything," she responds, her familiar impudence now replaced with an unsteady hesitation.

"How did you not hear that?” I retort. 

“Calm down. It’s probably just the air conditioning kicking on and I’ve grown used to it.” she replies dismissively. 

“That didn’t sound like an A/C unit.” I counter, my suspicion hanging heavily in the air. 

My sister, as is her custom, pays no heed to my concerns. Evading the question, she skillfully sidesteps its grasp, diverting the conversation. 

“You never answered my question. What are you doing here?” she demands with a palpable disdain for my presence. 

Confused, I attempt to refresh her memory. “Your cryptic text message. No hello, how are you? Just a vague, my place, tomorrow, 7 pm.” I explain, grappling with the mystery of why I find myself here after all these years. 

“Text? What are you talking about?” she replies, her response steeped in bewilderment, as though the recollection of her message demanding my attendance has momentarily escaped her. 

“You sent me a message yesterday to come over,” I explain as if speaking to an infant. 

“I never sent you a text.” She retorts sharply, her tone conveying a profound seriousness that makes me question my sanity.

Determined to prove I am not crazy, I retrieve the text and hover my phone in front of her face. I watch her expression fall as she reads it. She stares at it for a long moment, stunned. Did she drunk text me? Did she mean to text someone else? She clearly does not actually want me here, which sends my heart plummeting to my stomach. 

“What?” I stammer with an edgy tone that betrays the anguish beneath the surface.

“I didn’t send that text,” she solemnly replies, unleashing a tidal surge of heartache that engulfs me. 

My mind is a labyrinth of horrid thoughts screaming within me as I conjure all the conceivable ways she might cast me out, so I preemptively beat her to the punch. 

“I can just leave,” I suggest, my voice laden with an undercurrent of trepidation. As I’m about to turn towards the door, the unexpected happens. 

“No. I mean. You’re already here. You should stay. Do you want to watch a movie?” she offers with a trace of hesitation in her voice. 

“Sure,” I respond, unable to conceal my joy. I’m excited to spend time with my sister after all these years and I’m game for anything with minimal interaction to avoid awkward silence or arguing. 

“I can make some popcorn. Do you eat that?” 

“Oh. I brought snacks,” I declare with profound excitement as I pull a bag of organic carrots and freshly ground nut butter from my purse. 

“Of course you did. I have carrots, you know.” she says, evidently annoyed. 

“Yeah, conventional carrots.” I clarify. 

“There’s no difference between organic and non-organic foods.” She replies with an air of dismissiveness. 

Triggered, I find myself elaborating on the distinction between organic and conventional agriculture. I can’t help it. Ignorance is not a sanctuary but rather a treacherous path, one that inexorably leads to dire consequences like disease and death. My tone is a delicate balance of passion and arrogance when I speak. 

“Technically, they offer the same nutritional value but conventional foods are tainted with a multitudinous array of bacteria and pesticides that lead to health issues.” 

“Multitudinous?”

“Yeah, like, a large amount.”

“Why didn’t you just say that?” she counters. 

My sister has always been perpetually vexed by my extensive vocabulary, an attribute likely inherited from years of obsessive scientific research. 

“Pick a movie while I grab a snack. Do you want anything to drink? Bottled water? I mean, we don’t want to risk the horrors of tap water, do we?” she jests, taking a playful jab at my discerning tastes derived from hypochondria. 

“Bottled water’s great. Thanks.” I mumble sheepishly, eliciting a chuckle from her as she vanishes into the kitchen. 

I flick through my sister’s streaming services and cringe at her recent viewings, which reveal her insatiable appetite for reality TV. It really is unfathomable that we’re related. I scroll through the horror genre until I stumble upon the 2013 Evil Dead remake, which makes my heart flutter with excitement. My sister detests horror but she granted me creative liberties, so I seize the opportunity and hit play when a series of bangs from upstairs cause me to jump. What the hell is that? I mute the TV and listen. Nothing but silence. Incognizant to the noise, Claudia returns from the kitchen a moment later and settles into the opposite end of the couch. I quietly observe as she tears a bag of Sour Patch kids open, suppressing the urge to utter something that will initiate an argument. A strained smile creeps across my face, a facade concealing the unspoken judgment beneath its surface. She smiles back with an equally pretense demeanor, feigning an affinity for my company. We lock eyes in awkward silence until her attention drifts towards the movie, mercifully shattering the disquieting intensity of our uncomfortable gaze. As she washes down the candy with a diet coke, my eyes fall upon an unsettling detail - a peculiar, distorted marking on her arm, resembling the imprint of a deformed mutant.

“Oh my God. What happened to your arm?” I blurt out, my voice tinged with concern. 

While her taste in men has often been questionable, this fills me with worry I cannot cast aside. 
The question makes Claudia more uncomfortable than my presence already makes her. On edge, she rolls down her sleeve to conceal the marking. 

“You know you can talk to me about anything, right? I know we’ve never exactly been close but…” 

“It’s nothing.” she says, abruptly cutting me off.

“Okay. Sorry.” I utter softly, retreating from the probing inquiry, knowing that some mysteries are better left untouched. 

Attention deviated back to the movie, she pours a heaping of candy into her hand. I can’t help but grin as she meticulously picks around the yellow kids. She has done this with every bag of sour patch kids since she was little. It stirs a wave of nostalgia within me. Even though we never got along, I’ve always loved my sister. This moment we are sharing right now feels like home. 

“How can you watch this?” she utters with clear disdain as she casually pops a blue candy into her mouth.

“How can you eat this?” I retort, simultaneously snatching the bag of sour patch kids from her hands. If she can judge, so can I. “Oh my God, Claudia. Do you know what’s in this?” 

“Deliciousness.” She responds, tossing another candy into her mouth. 

“Sugar is the first ingredient!” I shoot a repulsed look at my sister and continue dissecting the ingredients. “It’s literally a concoction of cancer causing ingredients. Sugar, synthetic food dyes, and corn syrup.” 

“Mmm. Cancer tastes good.” She says as she indulges in the disease-inducing treat. 
I recoil at her self-destructive behavior. 


“Try one, it won’t kill you.” she persists. 

“The hell it wont. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in America.” I reply, a little too sharply.

Claudia rolls her eyes and shoves the last non-yellow colored candy into her mouth. Even our palettes were always dichotomous. I loved the lemon candies (when I was young and ignorant), with their piercing surge of overwhelming sourness that rattles your senses until the tartness quells, giving way to a cascade of sweetness that envelops your taste buds in a comforting embrace. It’s a metamorphosis – a transformation that unveils the candy’s dual nature. A faint chuckle escapes me as I take a nostalgic trip down memory lane, back to the days of our youth. 

“You always hated the yellow ones. It worked out perfectly though because those were my favorite. You always ate the red candies and I would eat the yellow, and then we’d divvy up the rest, until one day, you stopped giving me the yellow ones because you said you were saving them for…. gosh, what was her name?” The name danced on the tip of my tongue, yet remained elusive. 

“Angeline,” she murmurs in a barely audible voice. 

“That’s it! Angeline,” I declare, a laugh escaping from my lips. “I think mom was equally as happy as she was disturbed that we shared an imaginary friend. Mostly happy it gave her a chance to drink.” 

I glance at Claudia, waiting for a response, but it’s evident that my sister is too entangled in the web of her own thoughts to hear me. 

“Earth to Claudia…” I say, gently prodding her attention. 

“What? Sorry…what did you say?” she responds.

“I was just reminiscing on our childhood.” I reply.

“Oh… why?” She says with a negative connotation, as is her usual way. I refuse to give her the opportunity to taint this tender moment with the venom of her cynicism towards our shared upbringing, so I delve into the recesses of my mind for another happy memory. 

“Remember shadow tag?” I ask with a detectable spark of enthusiasm in my voice. 

“I hated shadow tag. I always got scared.” she groans. 

“Your own shadow scares you.” I tease lightly. 

“That’s what I’m saying!” she retorts. 

“We should play. For old times sake.” I propose.

“Absolutely not. Besides, aren’t we a little too old for that?” she responds with an icy demeanor.

The mere mention of the word “old” makes my skin crawl. As a hypochondriac, the impending aging process becomes an ominous reminder of the biological decay and increased susceptibility to disease that comes with the passage of time. In other words, the slow journey to death. I start to ruminate on my inevitable mortality when I’m hit with the notion that I am going to die from the same dementia that claimed my grandpa’s life. In the clutches of my anxiety, my OCD manifests, whispering rituals to fend off the early onset of the fatal disease. If I knock on wood three times, I won’t die from dementia. I can feel my sister watching me as I wrestle with the irrational impulse for a beat. It’s either my dignity or an increased chance of developing dementia. Fuck dignity. I knock on the wooden side table three times. Shit. That doesn’t feel right. Panic sets in as the sensation of imbalance consumes me entirely. Desperately seeking equilibrium, I’m hit with a different variation of my impulse to knock four times instead of three. I can see my sister staring at me out of my peripheral vision but the feeling of dementia growing inside me is overbearing so I subtly knock in two sets of two. 

“That’s a nice table. What is that, solid oak?” I inquire, attempting to mask my insanity.

Claudia studies me, expression tainted with a searing judgment that causes me discomfort. 

“What?” I snap defensively, even though I’m well aware she caught me performing my weird OCD ritual bullshit. 

“Nothing.” she says with a smirk that betrays her tone. “The side table is laminate. Not wood.” 
Fucksake. I loathe cheap homeowners. 

“Oh.” is all I can muster in the state of internal panic I am now in. 

“The door is wood though, if you want to knock on that.” She adds, enjoying my embarrassment way too much. 

We make eye contact and suddenly, the unimaginable happens. We start laughing together. I playfully toss a pillow at her as I tell her to “shut up!”  

The pillow smacks her in the face, causing her to laugh even harder. I bask in the moment, gaze never wavering from my sister. She takes on a different persona as she laughs uncontrollably. 

“I’m glad we’re talking again. I know we never really got along but this is nice.” I confess in a soft tone. 

Her laugh dissipates, sending my nerves surging until her lips soften into a genuine smile, revealing the softer, hidden side beneath my sister’s tough exterior. 

“Me too.” she replies with a sincerity that makes me believe her.  

“I have something for you.” I say as I pull a poorly wrapped gift from my purse. 

“What’s this?” she asks, trying to mask her excitement. 

“Happy birthday.” I say, warmly. 

“My birthday was seven months ago.” she says, as if I didn’t already know this. 

I shrug, “We weren’t speaking then.” 

Happiness fills Claudia’s face as she unwraps the gift, which doesn’t take long given the lack of effort I put into its presentation. It’s a framed picture of us having a tea party when we were younger. I wish I could remember the day it was taken but I have no recollection of the memory at all. Still, the faded image serves as a gentle reminder that despite the complexities of my relationship with my sister, at its core is a love that defies understanding. For so many years, this photograph has remained a vessel, summoning a reservoir of hope that one day my sister and I might mend our wounds, erase the scars and forge the sisterly bond I’ve always longed for. My emotions are a turbulent blend of excitement and anxiousness as I watch Claudia tear away the last remnants of wrapping paper until her expression grows solemn. A wave of anxiety envelops me and in that moment, I'm consumed by the weight of regret. It’s possible that my well-intentioned gesture evokes a bad memory. I really wish I could remember the day this photograph was captured. 

“You don’t like it.” I blurt out apologetically. 

“No. I do. It’s… It’s great. Thank you.” she utters unconvincingly before she stands and moves toward the bookshelf. 

A surge of happiness courses through my body as I watch her place the photograph among the other photos. My fleeting joy is only temporary because when she turns to face me, the wounded quality in her eyes becomes unmistakably clear. 

“What is it?” I ask.

Physically, this is the nearest I’ve been to my sister in years, yet an undeniable sense of distance lingers. I watch her grappling to articulate her thoughts. 

“When we moved out of the house, I thought that I would be able to leave it all behind me,” she explains solemnly, her words heavy with the weight of uncertainty of what to say next. 

The air is laden with unspoken histories and uncharted emotions for an uncomfortable moment while I dig deep for a compassionate response. 

“Claudia, we were just kids. Children aren’t supposed to see their parents swinging at each other like professional UFC fighters.”

Claudia’s response is so quiet, I can barely decipher her words. “I’m not talking about mom and dad.”

Is she talking about me? I’m almost too afraid to ask but what other choice do I have? “What are you talking about?” I ask gently. 

Claudia’s expression grows intense. “She found me.” 

“Who found you?” I press further. 

In a hushed, almost conspiratorial whisper, as if guarding against any prying ears in close vicinity, the name “Angeline” escapes my sister’s lips. The weight of the single word hangs in the air as I digest my sister’s completely delusional answer. 

“Angeline isn’t real.” I say with as much empathy I can summon. 

Claudia looks hurt by my response but not surprised, as if she expected my disbelief. I’ve never heard my sister speak with such desperation until now. 

“You saw her too. I don’t know when or why she stopped revealing herself to you but at one point in time, you saw her.” she snaps back. 

I’m slightly caught off guard by her conviction on such an absurd idea. Careful not to initiate an argument, I articulate what I deem to be the most rational answer. “It was just typical sibling rivalry. Everything you had, I needed to have too.”

Claudia shakes her head in disbelief. My sister is fairly dry on humor, but she has to be messing with me. There’s no way her overpriced therapist didn’t inform her that she created Angeline as a coping mechanism to dissociate from the reality of our tumultuous upbringing. 

“She was our imaginary friend. We both made her up.” I reiterate softly, emphasizing the fabricated nature of Angeline. 

Claudia looks like she’s about to argue this, yet as if surrendering to the weight of defeat, she reluctantly murmurs, “Yeah, forget it.” 

The resignation in her voice confirms my shortcomings as the idealized sister. I gently nudge her with my foot in an attempt to warrant a laugh. Resisting the urge to meet my gaze, Claudia’s eyes remain fixed on the ground in front of her. I can feel her beginning to withdraw, a sign that she’s about to shut me out. Driven by my resolve to not let that happen, I playfully coax her a little harder by nudging her with a little more force. She wrestles against every urge until her lips contort into a grin.

“Ow! What?” she says with a suppressed giggle, attempting to veil the joy my company brings her. 

Our eyes meet in an unspoken truce for a fleeting moment until the moment is abruptly shattered by a dissonant sound reminiscent of the intrusive thuds from earlier, but this time more intense. Fear registers on my sister’s face as a series of bangs emanate from upstairs in rapid succession. 

“Claudia, what the hell is that?” I demand, a blend of fear and concern tainting my tone.

“The A/C just needs to be reset.” she replies, her worried expression betraying a tone of conviction. 

I challenge her response with a hard stare, my skepticism untouched by her words.

“I’ll be right back. Just watch the movie,” she responds with a peculiar undercurrent in her voice.

I find it rather odd that a recently constructed building would come equipped with such a cacophonous air conditioning unit. I listen as the disquieting rhythm resounds in a low, deliberate crescendo of relentless bangs until suddenly it stops. Anxiety alleviated, I fixate my attention on the movie. It’s the part where David is burying his own sister. She’s pleading for her life when she suddenly morphs into the demon and turns on David. Siblings, man.  

Speaking of siblings, where has that sister of mine disappeared to? It has been quite some time since the commotion derived from the A/C unit has subsided. I silence the TV and strain to catch any sound that might hint at my sister’s location. A profound stillness envelops the room. 
“Claudia?” I call out. 

No response. Intrusive thoughts begin to penetrate my mind, screaming so loud, they interrupt the oppressive silence. Suppressing the unsettling thought that my sister finds my presence unbearable, I rise from the couch to investigate when I notice yellow sour patch kids strewn across the floor. My sister’s untidiness makes me cringe. I activate her fancy little Roomba, causing the light to infiltrate the darkness. My initial fascination with the machine gradually wanes with each passing second as I watch it aimlessly scour the room, scavenging for untidiness. How is it possible for such a hi-tech cleaning device to be so oblivious to a mess scattered haphazardly across the floor? I shift my gaze toward the staircase, where I noticed the yellow candies, only to find they’ve mysteriously vanished. How is that possible? They were right there a moment ago and my focus had been unwaveringly fixed on the vacuum the entire time. My attention drifts to the machine’s ethereal glow piercing through the darkness when suddenly the directional light crosses something that makes my heart stop  – the shadow of a large distorted figure crawling on all fours darts past my vision. Could my sister have a pet she never mentioned? A sizable dog of some kind? It can’t possibly be a cat; it’s far too large.

The light diminishes as the Roomba accelerates into the kitchen, leaving me engulfed in darkness. Unfamiliar with the landscape of my sister’s living room, I grope around with my hands until they find the table lamp. Now the only source of light, the illumination from the lamp casts warm colors and shadows on the walls. I glance around the space. There’s no sign of an animal. 

My eyes fall on the photograph of my sister and I – I’m spellbound by the photo, gaze fixed upon it with an undeniable sense of longing for a memory that has faded from my grasp until something in its reflection catches my eye. Reflected on the wall behind me, is the shadow of a malformed arm stretching out, as if slowly reaching for something. Startled, I turn around to catch a quick glimpse of a grotesque hand grabbing the sour patch kids from the side table and in one swift movement, it disappears behind the couch. An unsettling rustle permeates the air. 

“Claudia?” I call out, trying to conceal the trepidation creeping into my voice as I approach with caution.

Just as I’m about to reach the couch, the rustling comes to an abrupt halt, quickly replaced by a fast pitter-patter, like something shuffling across the wooden floor. I glance behind the couch only to discover the bag of sour patch kids empty and abandoned. I bend down to grab it when out of my peripherals, I catch movement. I glance up to find, cast on the wall, mere feet away from my own shadow, stretches the silhouette of another figure, its limbs crooked and contorted. I cautiously move toward it when it scatters out of view, slinking away on all fours. Clever Claudia, using our childhood game to scare me. I brought this upon myself by suggesting we play earlier.  

“Common Claudia, quit messing around. This is going to end up in a fight and then I won’t see you for another five years,” I assert, my words a feeble attempt to conceal my fear.

Without warning, the light clicks off, plunging me into darkness and enveloping the room in obscurity. Paralyzed with fear, I wait for my sister’s laughter to disrupt the silence but it’s so quiet, the only sound I hear is the mechanical whirring from the Roomba entering the living room with purpose. The vacuum’s integrated light cascades a two-foot ray of hazy illumination, slicing into the darkness. I watch it beeline for something – a straggly clump of hair – then abruptly pivot in rapid sequence, switching direction like a robot with untreated ADHD. It sucks up more yellow candies mysteriously littered across the ground before it darts for the table. Hindered by the base, it collides into the table repeatedly, an insistent sentinel, driven by an unyielding resolve to rectify the mess it senses.

The Roomba backs away from the base, readying to hurl itself in another attempt to breach the barrier. I slowly approach the table and lower myself onto all fours to look underneath, which is enveloped in pitch darkness until the Roomba crashes into the base. The beam briefly exposes the unsightly visage of a profoundly disturbing creature, its form twisted and distorted in a manner that defies the laws of the natural world. Its scalp is exposed, with clumps of straggly hair fallen across the floor beside it. An unnatural, guttural sound escapes its mouth - a harrowing combination of an eerie cry and animal noises. 

I scream as I reel back in terror until I find my footing. Unblinking, I watch the Roomba continue its relentless attempts to breach the table. Haunted by the dread that the creature might relocate if I flee for help, I tentatively draw near the table once again. When I look underneath this time, there’s no otherworldly being – just clumps of hair. I blink hard, convinced I’m losing my mind. I draw a deep breath and lift the table, allowing the vacuum to fulfill its programmed purpose. It voraciously sucks up the hair and veers off in another direction, briefly illuminating the silhouette of a figure crouched in the corner - an invitation cloaked in shadows. 

Paralyzed with fear, I fixate on the obscure form lurking in the corner. Perhaps it’s my eyes playing tricks on me. Darkness has a penchant for such deceptions. With measured trepidation, I edge closer to the corner and slowly turn the lamp on to reveal – 

– my sister’s dead corpse. 

A guttural cry escapes my lips as I fall to my knees beside my sister’s lifeless body, the surge of emotion impossible to conceal as the stark reality sets in - My sister is gone and I’ll never have a relationship with her in this lifetime. I swallow this bitter truth down, sitting in the suffocating silence until the noise – one thud after the next, mocking and coaxing me into its perverse game. Petrified, I bolt out the front door like a bat out of hell. Standing in the middle of the lawn, I stare back at the house as I steady my breathing, my initial fear and anxiety replaced with a volatile blend of anger and determination. I need to know what killed my sister.
