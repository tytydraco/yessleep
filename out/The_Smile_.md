It’s funny how people trust you when you wear a smile.

I’ve lived in Bryson City for over fifteen years now. Small town, quiet, nestled between endless stretches of dense woods. Folks here love the familiarity everyone knows everyone, or at least thinks they do. They’ve always liked me, been comfortable around me. I guess I make people feel safe.

Tonight, I’m walking the trails like I always do. The air smells of pine and damp earth, the familiar crunch of fallen leaves underfoot soothing. There’s a soft rustling to my left a rabbit maybe, or a squirrel. I ignore it. The woods are alive at night; they hum with energy, with sounds of creatures that can’t be seen but you know are there.

I spot her ahead, one of the new girls who moved into town a month or so ago. Kate, or maybe it was Katie doesn’t really matter now. She’s jogging, headphones in, oblivious. I watch her for a few moments, her breath coming out in little puffs in the cool air. Her pace is steady, her ponytail bouncing in rhythm. She’s fit. I love when they’re fit.

The smile I’m known for spreads across my face. This is going to be fun.

I step out of the brush, timing it just right. She startles when she sees me, but when I wave and say, "Evening," she relaxes. See? Always trust the guy with the friendly smile.

“You’re out here late,” I say as I fall in step beside her. “The woods can be a little creepy at night.”

She chuckles, a little nervous but trying to hide it. “Yeah, I know. Just needed to clear my head.”

I nod, keeping pace with her, though it’s obvious she’s speeding up slightly. It’s adorable how they do that like they can sense something is wrong but are too polite to confront it. The social contract, ingrained deep.

After a few more minutes, I point to a narrow trail leading deeper into the woods. “Shortcut back to town,” I tell her. “Saves about fifteen minutes.”

She hesitates, her instincts flaring up again. But then I smile. God, I love how easy this is. “Alright,” she says with a sheepish grin, and we turn onto the trail.

It only takes five minutes before she realizes something’s off. The path gets narrower, overgrown, the trees pressing in closer. She stops, breathing heavier now, not from the jog but from fear. 

“Where… where are we?” she asks.

I don’t answer right away, letting the silence stretch out. The night around us seems to grow darker, thicker. I can hear her pulse quicken. It’s beautiful.

Then I let the mask slip, just a little. “You know, no one ever takes this trail unless I bring them here,” I say softly.

She blinks, confusion flickering across her face. I watch as realization slowly dawns in her eyes, like a flame catching hold. I live for this moment.

Her breath hitches, and she stumbles back a step. “I… I should go back,” she mutters, starting to turn. I grab her wrist before she can move. Her skin is so warm, so alive.

“No,”
