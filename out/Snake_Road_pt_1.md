Hey guys, 

I am unsure if I am really looking for answers or  simply hoping someone would understand the things that happened in my hometown, I am going to have to break this up into a few or so parts but at least someone can hopefully help me understand or I don’t know, share in my trauma. 

Now I grew up in a small town in Northern California, and much like any small town it was filled with legends and tales of the supernatural, creatures and ghouls that stalk the woods, hills claimed by demonic beings and their cults, or schools haunted by people nearly forgotten by all those but whom know the stories. Some crumble quick under the smallest amount of investigation but others, well they from my experience hold weight. I would love to share all the spooky tales from my childhood but for now I would like to focus on one. The story of Snake Road. 

Now, knowing me isn’t truly important to the story but it might set up some context for exactly who I am and lend some perspective to this story, growing up I was very much a care free guy. People new me as the type of guy who was always ready for a good time and loved to joke around, further proof to that would be any luck I ever did have with the ladies was more so on account to my sense of humor than accredited to my looks. 

I wasn’t fugly by any means but truly an average guy in the looks department. I was quite intelligent as most of my high school years were spent speed running textbooks to finish the assignments so I could then skip class as in my head, I did the work so now it was time to play. Most of my days were spent with my best friend Luis and a variety of revolving faces, drinking and going on “quest” to explore anything and everything. Never really looking for anything in particular but just enjoying the thrill of a good time and sometimes the excitement of a good scare. This being said there was only a hand full of times I found myself face to face with something I couldn’t rationally explain. 

It was my junior year in high school, Luis and I had made plans to take a group of friends up to Snake Road in the late hours of the night. We were from a small town but Snake Road (which isn’t its real name but a nickname given to it as from a Birds Eye view the road looked like a gigantic serpent slithering through the hillside.) connected us to an even smaller town, one so small it didn’t even have a gas station. 

The smaller town was nestled in a valley, surrounded but hills on all sides and the half circle of slopes opened up to a marina waterfront that the shores only served as rail track for trains, my town had the track station while this smaller town did not. In fact, other then the maybe 20 or 30 houses, this town only had one restaurant that was attached to a hotel that teenagers rented to throw parties in but otherwise had been long past it’s glory days, a schoolhouse that was gated off (a story for another day.) and a bait shop that was mainly used as resupply for fishermen who didn’t know the importance of preparation. 

This town did not even have a town hall, to give further context to exactly how small this town actually was. Before the interstate was put in and a small one lane road carved through the hillside was put in, snake road was the only thing connecting the small town to the outside world but sometime long before I was born a section of the road collapsed into the cliff making the interstate connection the only way in and out of the small connecting town. 

Luis and I were no strangers to Snake Road, and we have become somewhat of local legends for guiding friends or friends of friends around the many scary places around our town but I would note our second favorite activity was following the fake paranormal tour groups around and yelling our banter at the wild stories they would make up about building right on the Main Street. 

We never could fully understand why these people elected to not step out of the town and go to the truly haunted places beyond the light of our towns street lights and take people to the dark voids where things truly went bump in the night. Now, as a teenager mortality doesn’t fully set in, I am now older and understand why most people elected to not brave the darkest and lock their doors at night. Even after all of my close encounters, I would laugh it off as soon as the I was luck enough to get away but looking back I don’t think I realized just how lucky I truly was. 

This story most likely won’t be perfect to the exact course of events that transpired that night as I only have my perspective but perhaps I can help others understand to not go messing with things beyond their understanding and get some answers to exactly what happened, as while I remember it I can not fully rationalize it. 

Luis and I had just cut out from school, leaving right before fourth period. We would go up by the track field where P.E. (Physical Education) class was held everyday, we generally would have about 5 to 10 minutes before the gym teachers would come out from their offices below the gymnasium which was plenty of time to walk across the parking lot in the rear of the campus, cut through the neighboring apartment complex and make it to the freedom of suburban neighborhood and from there we would our preparation for tonight’s trip onto the slithering road surrounding by hills to one side and steep cliffs to the other, all of which was consumed by a darkness that only gave way to a blue dim glow gifted by the moon, illuminating small patches of unmaintained asphalt and trail heads that lead to places that even we wouldn’t travel at night but again, that’s a tale for another day. 

We wasted no time going to my house to get some flashlights that never managed to produce any light of significance on snake road, my trusty club (small baseball bat I got from a MLB game) and a few rations of beef jerky before locating a homeless person to buy of a few beers and bottle of vodka that we would empty onto water bottles, instantly putting us into cogito mode then finally ending up at Luis’s house for a well deserved beer and lunch of leftover tacos he had the evening before. We would wait around for the nerds, i mean friends of ours to get out of school and meet us at the intersection that led to Snake Road, we would spend some time joking around until everyone got there. 

As our group amassed we had Sam, he was a very attractive guy but known for being way too sensitive and would normally lash out when being the butt of a joke, short and thin in build he always wore his hat backwards and had a crackly voice. 

Ashley R, a fairly attractive girl with a moderate sense of humor but would get annoyed easily and known as a tease to anyone she was dating but otherwise never flirted with anyone but the one person she was with or interested in at the time which in and of it self was a rarity. 

Natasha, a curvy but slim girl of native America descent who was innocent and pure who rarely got anyone’s perverted joke or flirting and it would quickly go right over her head. 

Kyle, a fairly large guy who prided himself on being a “country boy”, but honestly had a bit of anger issues. 

Ashley M, a slim cute girl who was well endowed on the chest and mainly had a hippie vibe and Kyle was in love with her but she really only used him because she could tell and knew she could get stuff from him. 

Lastly, there was Rose, a delicate flower on a field of sunshine who smile lit up the world and laughter would cure the rage of men, she was intelligent and near perfect in all aspects while at this time I was lucky enough to call my girlfriend. She was honestly to good for me but she said I made her laugh and I loved hearing it, and though I was sure she would someday realize she was wasting her time with me I was just happy to have her in any given moment. Though I did tend to try to run from her lectures about my habit of skipping school. 

I stepped up and with my back facing the road that lead down to Snake Road I said, “Now, tonight we will be spending the night on Snake Road. All of you will need to be back here exactly an hour before sunset, if you want to spend the night down there and keep everyone save, we will have a very specific set of things we need to do before entering the road. Sure you can travel at night on the road with minimal risk but since we are planning to spend the whole night there are a few rules. First, We must pay respect to at last one grave in the cemetery on the side of the road that leads up there, spirits don’t like when you spend the night without showing your respect first even then they still might not like you, specially you.” 

I pointed to Kyle before chuckling, “second, do not go off on any side trails. Don’t want to have to come get you, if getting you is even possible. Third, do not shout or yell back to any voice you hear coming from a distance, worst case you’ll let them know where we are and best case you’ll let some cop know where we are. Fourth, if you see a spot of pure impenetrable darkness absolutely do not step into it or you’ll end up in their world. Fifth, if you see the spider do not scream, try to get everyone’s attention, point it out and run, we can only hope we see her before she sees us but she is extremely rare to actually be anywhere near the road. Lastly, never go anywhere alone.” The guys all made mocking scared gestures as the girls looked around and wondered by they were joining us idiots for this. 

Kyle, Sam, Ashley M, and Natasha went downtown to get some food, while Luis and Ashley R went to his house to partake of the devils lettuce. 

Rose and I would go to a near by park and enjoy the pleasant California weather, the perfect hoodie weather but only after my lecture about attendance, I protested by presenting my case that I already knew three languages and technically completed all the textbooks for my classes. She told me that I should be in advance placement (super nerd classes) but I just laid my head on her lap while we sat and laid in the grass as I said “but seriously, the roads going to fucking hate Kyle, spirits don’t like sister fuckers.” Rose would smack the side of my head as she giggled, she wanted to didn’t want to admit it was funny but couldn’t help herself, “he might try to kick you butt for saying that.” Rose replied after her giggling subsided, “the day Kyle can kick my ass is the day he bangs someone outside of his family tree.” I quickly retorted only to feel another smack and hear the sound of her cute suppressed laughter. 

One of the local homeless men walked up, he was a chubby man with white hair and a white beard and normally wore a red hoodie which earned him the name Santa Claus, she approached us and asked for some money but I simply looked up and told him “I’m as broke as you and twice as ugly.” Santa and Rose gave a chuckle as Rose pulled a dollar from her pocket and gave it to the jolly old man, “you must be doing something right.” Santa said as he point to Rose, insinuating how lucky I was to have her. “I don’t know Santa, she hasn’t given me a dollar. Only lecture.” He would chuckle again before pressing on to find more money for a beer or some type of liquor. 

“Is, is it really that scary up there?” I heard Rose’s soft voice ask, the slight shakiness of fear in her voice, “it gets pretty spooky, but you have two directions to run and most of the things up there know I’ll get them the roasting of an afterlife time for messing with me. They heard the roasting I gave Tyler a few months ago and pretty sure they don’t want to run that with me.” Rose chuckled and began playing with my hair, “but, you’d protect me right?” I looked up at her, “I’ll trip Kyle, shove Sam, pick you up and run you to the next state over it anything happens. I would never let anything happen to you.” Honestly I couldn’t, sure it was high school but she was my world, life and the world wouldn’t make sense without her and I could never let anything happen to her. We called it a day at the park and headed over downtown to get a quick bite before rejoining the others. 

Upon meeting back at the intersection, Luis was already waiting. He had his backpack which had supplies like beer, vodka, beef jerky, flashlights, a wooden club to and handed me my backpack that had matching supplies. We waiting for the others, just the three of us looking down the roads leading away from Snake Road trying to see if we could spot the others coming when suddenly from behind us further down the road came a blood curdling scream that sounds something between a woman falling from a great distance and an animal being killed, even though we could tell it was coming from relatively far away, it pierced out ear to the point all three of us covered them and quickly turned around expecting to see a murder scene, but as we turned around the scream stopped it it was simply a road abandoned road with woods on both sides, leaves blowing in a spiral towards us and while still lit up from natural lighting shadows crept in from the dusk hours when the sun begins to set. 

We all looked at each other, Rose looked begin Luis and I over flowing with fear and seeking confirmation this was a normal occurrence as we both looked at her then each other in confusion, we have experienced more strange things than we could count on that road but never anything before we made it up there and never anything before sunset and this scream was a new one, I knew the only was to settle all of our minds would be to crack out the humor even though deep down in my gut I felt something wasn’t right, with confusion still on my face and looking at Luis and said “wrong hole?” To which he immediately brushed into laughter but as I was about to join him I felt a sudden pain in my stomach causing me to bend forward and let out a grunt of pain, “you jerk! Someone can be getting hurt up there and you’re just making jokes. Are you even going to go check.” Rose yelled at me. I stood back up rubbing my stomach and with a bit of pain still in my voice I said, 

“yeah, wait here and we’ll go check.” Now it’s about a 15 minute walk from the intersection to the official start of Snake Road and as stated just around a bend, out of sight from the intersection was a grave yard and past that was wooded a bit on both sides before the right hand of the road would slope off into a cliff, Luis and I would walk up, yelling out for anyone making it to the beginning of Snake Road without seeing a living soul. 

Since the road was collapsed down on the far side towards the smaller town the city put up a barrier so cars couldn’t drive down and accidentally drive off the road, plus even before the road collapsed many people had driven off the cliff, some by accident and others not so much, the beginning of the road had tree branches covering it from both sides, like a tunnel of trees that lead you to the unexplained and unknown, you could see about 25 yards before the road led into its first bend when banked left into the hillside, we saw nothing and heard nothing. Luis and I exchanged a look of uncertainty, we could both tell tonight was going to be different from any of our previous trips but we were just unsure of what degree and both could tell that we were debating if it was worth it, 

“Let’s head back.” Luis said, so we back out way back down the road only to hear a sudden thud behind us, we were both fairly big guys, in fact probably some of the biggest guys in our school and known for being able to hold our own in a fight but yet both of us jumped and turned, entering a fighting stance prepared to take of whoever dared try sneaking up on us but when staring straight ahead only saw the empty road we just looked down and only when we tilted our heads down realized that the sound was a bird laying lifeless on the road before us, to be specific a dead crow, I squatted down to inspect it and sure enough it was as if the crow fell from the ether to deliver us a clear omen. 

I looked up at Luis shrugged and he insisted we not tell anyone before throwing the crow off to the side of the road and we made our way back to the intersection. 

Upon arrival the whole group was here with the addition of one of Ashley M’s friends, I think his name was Miguel and it was a friend she was clearly interested in, as we approached I saw Kyle seething with jealousy at the uninvited guest, well uninvited by any of us and only invited by his love obsession. 

The others talked and laughed at they prepared themselves for the night to come, all but Rose who still had the clear look of concern and anxiety on her face. I would quickly walk and hug her, whispering in her ear to make an excuse and go home, that no matter how much I wanted to spend time with her that tonight was going to be different and I didn’t want her in any danger she whispered back and asked if I would come with her but I told her I couldn’t as they would need me, with her hands shaking as she held onto me she shook her head and she than I would need her and she was coming with me, I kissed the top of her head and held her close only now noticing the mocking cackling of the group for what they perceived as Rose and mines lovey dovey behavior, Rose composed herself and let me go as I stepped back towards Luis, “are we all ready?” I asked, being met with hell yeahs and let’s go’s. Luis and I looked towards each other with a serious glare we both nodded, turned our backs and began to lead the group down the road that was now barely covered with the faint glimmer of twilight.
