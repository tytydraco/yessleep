The theatre smelled like old wood, a comforting scent that always made me feel like I was stepping into another world. It was a small, rundown building nestled between a shuttered bookstore and a faded café, but inside, the energy buzzed like electricity. The crew was a tight-knit group of dreamers and misfits, all hungry to create something raw, something real.

On my first day with the troupe, I was introduced to the director, a wiry woman named Claire with sharp eyes that seemed to see right through you. She didn’t waste time with pleasantries. “This isn’t your typical play,” she said, voice low and serious. “We’re pushing limits. I want you to live your characters. Lose yourself. That’s the only way.”

That’s how I ended up with The Double, a role that sounded simple but twisted as soon as I started digging. The character was a man who lived by imitation, stealing another’s identity so completely that he became a ghost walking in someone else’s shoes. Claire said it was perfect for me, given my method style.

Rehearsals were held in a cramped room upstairs, walls lined with cracked mirrors and peeling paint. I’d watch myself practice every gesture, every look, trying to slip under the skin of this shadowy man. My fellow actors were intense, especially the one playing the "original," a tall guy named Marcus with a quiet, almost eerie presence.

At first, it was all just acting. But slowly, I started to notice the mirrors weren’t quite right. Sometimes my reflection lagged a fraction behind my movements, or I’d catch a glimpse of Marcus’s face flickering next to mine. Once, after rehearsal, I found my jacket slung over a chair, except it wasn’t mine. It smelled faintly of Marcus’s cologne.

That night, I lay awake staring at the cracked ceiling, but it wasn’t just the silence that kept me restless. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was starting to change, subtly, but unmistakably. It was in the way I held myself, the way I caught myself adjusting my posture without thinking, mirroring Marcus’s quiet confidence.

The next day, after rehearsal, I met some of the cast at a nearby café. The air was lighter there, the chatter a break from the intensity of the theatre, but something shifted when Marcus walked in. His eyes locked onto me, narrowing as he took in the way I was dressed, the same dark jacket he always wore, the same worn boots.

“Why are you trying to be me?” His voice was low, edged with something I couldn’t place, anger? Fear?

I blinked, surprised. “What do you mean?”

He took a step closer, his jaw tight. “You’re acting, sure. But outside the play, in the real world, you’re copying me. The way you talk, the way you move. It’s like you want to become me.”

I laughed nervously, but his stare didn’t waver. “It’s just part of the role,” I said. “You know that. I’m just… method acting.”

Marcus shook his head. “This isn’t acting anymore. You’re crossing a line. You don’t even realise who you are anymore.”

I wanted to argue, to tell him I was fine, but a cold knot tightened in my chest. The truth was, I was starting to forget who I was. When I looked in the mirror, I wasn’t sure if I was seeing myself or Marcus, or some twisted blend of both.

That night, alone in my apartment, I caught myself practising his gestures in the mirror, feeling the same strange satisfaction he seemed to carry. But somewhere deep inside, a voice whispered that I was no longer just playing The Double, I was becoming him.

By the time opening night arrived, I had become Marcus. His voice, his mannerisms, his quiet confidence, it all slipped into me like a second skin. On stage, it felt seamless. Natural. Almost inevitable.

The show was a success. Critics praised it as “a performance of uncanny realism,” applauding my portrayal of The Double as if I’d cracked some hidden code of acting. Claire was over the moon, beaming at me from the wings, while the rest of the cast offered polite but wary congratulations, but Marcus was silent.

In the days after the final performance, he drifted further away from the group. At first, it was subtle, missing rehearsals, avoiding gatherings. But soon, he wouldn’t even stand in the same room with me. One evening, I caught him outside the theatre as the crew was packing up. He stood by the curb, his jacket collar turned up, watching me with something that felt sharper than resentment.

“You did it, didn’t you?” he said, his voice tight.

“Did what?” I asked, though my stomach twisted.

He shook his head, stepping back. “You didn’t just play the part. You took it. You wanted to be me. You wanted my place.”

“That’s not—” I started, but he cut me off.

“I’m done,” he said, his voice low and final. “I can’t stand to be around you. You’ve made me a ghost in my own life. You’ve stolen everything I had. The role, the praise… even my face. I’m out.”

He turned and walked away, his steps quick and unsteady, disappearing into the night like he was trying to outrun something.

 I stood there, feeling the weight of his words settle over me. I wanted to call after him, to deny it, but a strange, quiet voice inside me whispered that he wasn’t wrong.

A few weeks after Marcus left, the troupe moved on. Claire announced a new production, a minimalist, experimental piece titled The Sleepwalker. The role she offered me was challenging but intriguing: a man caught between waking and dreams, wandering through half-remembered moments.

Rehearsals were smooth, almost too smooth. The lines came easily, the blocking felt natural, and the ensemble worked in perfect synchrony. The play’s structure was fragmented, each scene bled into the next, like a series of dreams layered over each other. I found myself slipping into the rhythm without much effort, delivering lines that seemed to rise from somewhere just beneath my thoughts.

But while the theatre hummed along as usual, my life outside the stage began to fray.

The first time it happened, I woke up in my kitchen, seated at the table, surrounded by half-eaten food, bread torn into chunks, a glass of milk tipped over, a crust of pie I didn’t remember buying. My hands were sticky, my clothes rumpled, as though I’d been there for hours. The clock on the wall read 3:12 AM.

I stumbled back to bed, too dazed to question it, but when it happened again the next night, the unease settled deeper. This time, I woke with my head resting on the table, a fork still in my hand. My phone buzzed quietly on the counter; it was a message from Claire: “Stay focused. You’re doing great.”

I began to lose track of time. Mornings bled into afternoons, and I’d find myself standing at the window, unsure how long I’d been there. At the theatre, my lines were flawless, my performance precise. But at home, I was slipping.

One night, I woke up to find muddy footprints trailing across my kitchen floor. They led from the back door to the table where I sat, surrounded by the usual half-eaten meal. I checked the locks, they were still bolted from the inside.

I tried to tell myself it was stress, sleep deprivation from the long rehearsals. But deep down, a chill was settling.

At first, it was just the kitchen. Then, the backyard. I woke up one morning, slumped against the garden fence, dew soaking my clothes, dirt caked under my fingernails. I didn’t remember walking out there. I didn’t remember anything.

The episodes grew worse. I’d wake up on the front steps, curled like a stray animal. Once, I found myself standing fully dressed in the middle of the street at dawn, staring blankly at the empty horizon as though waiting for something.

Claire’s texts became more frequent: “Stay grounded. You’re almost there. Don’t fight it.”

I tried to explain to her that something was wrong, that I wasn’t sure where the stage ended and real life began. But she only smiled, her sharp eyes glinting. “That’s the whole point of The Sleepwalker. It’s about surrender. The role is transforming you.”

I didn’t argue. I was too tired. Too hollowed out.

The final night it happened, I wasn’t even aware I’d left the house. I must have slipped out sometime past midnight. The next thing I knew, I was walking naked down the centre of the road, the asphalt cold against the soles of my feet.

Headlights bloomed behind me, blinding and sharp. A horn blared, and the screech of tires sliced through the stillness.

I turned just in time to see a car swerve, its wheels skidding wildly. It missed me by inches.

I stood there, heart hammering, breath shallow, staring at the taillights as they vanished into the distance. My skin prickled with cold, but the deeper chill was inside, a realisation that I wasn’t sure where I’d begun and where I’d ended.

The next day, I showed up at the theatre, shaken and exhausted, but determined to see it through. When the curtain rose and the stage lights burned down, something inside me clicked. The audience hung on my every word. My movements, slow, dreamlike, deliberate, felt effortless, as though the role itself was flowing through me.

When the final scene ended, the applause was deafening. People rose to their feet, cheering, calling my name. I stood there in the spotlight, letting it wash over me. In that moment, I felt… invincible. Like my style of acting wasn’t just a technique, it was magic.

After *The Sleepwalker* closed, Claire approached me almost immediately with the next project. “You’re perfect for this one,” she said, handing me a thin, dog-eared script titled *The Patient*.

The role was raw, disturbing. I was to play a man locked away in a crumbling mental hospital, convinced that the walls were alive, that the nurses were poisoning him, that something monstrous was lurking just beyond the locked doors. It was a descent into madness, a man fighting his own mind.

Rehearsals were straightforward at first. I learned the lines, studied the character’s fragile ticks, the way he’d wring his hands, flinch at shadows, whisper to himself in broken, half-finished sentences. It was just acting, I told myself. But then I started hearing things. Small sounds, scratches behind the walls, a distant creak of floorboards in my apartment when I was sure I was alone. The ceiling above my bed groaned like something was crawling across it. At first, I laughed it off. Long hours, stress. Method acting blurring into overwork.

But the noises grew louder. My neighbours complained about strange thudding sounds coming from my unit at night. I found my front door ajar in the morning, though I swore I’d locked it the night before.

During rehearsals, Claire praised my performance. “You’re channelling his paranoia perfectly,” she said, her voice rich with approval. I nodded, forcing a smile, though inside I wasn’t sure I was *playing* paranoia anymore.

At home, I’d sit in the dark, listening to the walls breathing around me. The hallway light would flicker at odd intervals. I’d catch glimpses of movement in the corner of my eye, a shadow slipping past the bathroom door, a figure standing just beyond the window.

I started keeping the lights on, but it didn’t help. The shadows crept closer.

Then, one night, I woke to find myself standing in the corner of my living room, hands pressed flat against the wall as if I were listening to something on the other side. My mouth was dry, my heart racing. I didn’t remember getting out of bed.

In the following days, the shift was subtle but undeniable. My apartment, my safe, familiar apartment, felt wrong. The walls seemed to lean in ever so slightly, as if they were listening. I heard faint murmurs behind them, like conversations in a language I couldn’t quite make out.

The smells changed, too. The faint scent of dust and old wood was replaced by a sterile, acrid odour, like bleach and hospital disinfectant. My floors creaked underfoot, and no matter how hard I scrubbed, dark stains reappeared on the tiles near the bathroom.

I stopped leaving. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to; I couldn’t. Whenever I reached for the door, my hands trembled. I’d stand there for minutes, forehead pressed against the wood, listening to whispers that promised something terrible waited outside.

Sleep was no longer an escape. I’d wake up disoriented, convinced I was back in character. The walls of my bedroom transformed into peeling, mildewed plaster. My own furniture blurred into institutional cots and rusty chairs. I began to believe the window wasn’t real, that it was a painting designed to keep me calm, just like in the script.

Once, I heard a knock at the door. A gentle, polite knock. I crept toward it and peered through the peephole, but all I saw was a long, dim corridor stretching endlessly, lit by flickering overhead bulbs.

I couldn’t even call for help. My phone, once a tether to reality, buzzed with messages I couldn’t understand, just static and fragments of sentences. “Stay inside. They’re coming for you. Don’t listen to the walls.”

The final straw came when I woke one morning, or what I thought was morning, to find my apartment fully transformed. The walls were lined with cracked tiles, the lights above flickered with a cold, clinical glare, and the air was thick with the scent of antiseptic, and my clothes were replaced by a thin, tattered hospital gown.

I wasn’t in my apartment. I was in his room, the cell from the script. And somewhere in the distance, I heard footsteps echoing, growing louder. They were coming for me.

The days blurred together in that prison of my own mind. Every moment felt like I was trapped behind padded walls, caught in a cycle of paranoia and fear. But somehow, the night of the show arrived.

I showed up at the theatre a hollow shell, still haunted by the visions and sounds that plagued my apartment. My hands shook as I stepped onto the stage, but the moment the lights hit me, something shifted.

The crowd was silent, waiting. And I was no longer just myself; I was The Patient.

I poured every fractured thought, every whispered fear, into the performance. I trembled, whispered, flinched, and became the man losing his grip on reality right before their eyes.

When the final line echoed through the empty hall, the silence held for a heartbeat… then the applause burst forth like a storm. Standing ovations, cheers, calls for an encore. Once again, the show was a complete success.

The applause from The Patient still rang in my ears when Claire handed me the next script: The Plague Doctor.

The character was eerie, wrapped in heavy robes, the birdlike mask concealing all emotion, wandering through death and disease. I was intrigued, but also wary.

At first, rehearsals were normal enough. But within days, I noticed a tickle in my throat, a dryness that wouldn’t go away. A cough began, soft, almost polite at first, but it settled in, stubborn and unrelenting.

My body felt heavy. Fatigue dragged me down like a weight I couldn’t shake. I chalked it up to stress, to the intense focus the role demanded. But as the days passed, the sickness crept deeper.

I started seeing shadows in the corners of my eyes. The faint scent of something medicinal, sharp and metallic would linger in the air even when no one else was around.

Again, I told myself it was just the role getting under my skin. But something about it felt different this time, more real, more... contagious.

The cough worsened. It rattled deep in my chest, dragging ragged breaths from my lungs. Days bled into nights, and exhaustion wrapped around me like a suffocating cloak. I could barely focus during rehearsals, yet the role demanded every ounce of my attention.

Then the skin changes began. At first, tiny red spots appeared, but within days, the spots swelled into angry, painful boils that bubbled and wept.

I tried to hide them, long sleeves, gloves, but the itching was relentless. The sores spread across my arms, neck, and toward my face. Each morning, I awoke to find new marks, fresh wounds, as if some unseen plague was claiming me, piece by piece.

One night as I slept, I was jolted awake by a soft tapping at the window. My breath caught as a cold wind swept through the room.

I pulled myself up, heart pounding in my chest, and in the dim moonlight, I saw it standing just outside, on the fire escape, a tall figure cloaked in black robes, the iconic beaked mask gleaming faintly like bone in the night.

The mask’s glass eyeholes reflected the streetlights like empty, soulless eyes. I remembered the old stories, how plague doctors wore those masks filled with herbs and spices to ward off the miasma, the deadly “bad air” believed to carry the sickness. But this figure wasn’t warding off disease, he *was* the disease.

He raised a gloved hand slowly, tapping again, rhythmically, as if beckoning me to open the window.

Frozen in place, I felt a wet, rancid breath on my neck, the scent of decay and rot flooding my senses. A whispered rasp carried on the wind, words I couldn’t quite make out, but filled with menace:

*“The pestilence spreads.*

The night of the play, I sat trembling in the dressing room, fever burning through my skin, sores weeping beneath my clothes. The air felt thick, suffocating. I hadn’t slept since the Plague Doctor came to my apartment, and I hadn’t stopped hearing his whispered promises of death and decay.

When Claire came in, I pleaded with her. “I can’t,” I rasped, my voice hoarse. “I’m sick. I’m seeing things. Please…”

Her lips curled into a thin smile, her voice cold and resolute. “This is *exactly* the realism we need. The fear, the sickness, it’s perfect. The audience will believe it because it’s real.”

I felt my legs buckle beneath me as I made my way to the wings, trembling, drenched in sweat. But as I stood there, waiting for my cue, I saw him, the Plague Doctor. He was watching from the shadows backstage, tall and unmoving, his glass eyes catching the stage lights. His beaked mask tilted slightly, as if acknowledging me, but no one else seemed to see him.

I stepped onto the stage, the fever making the floor ripple beneath my feet. The sores on my arms throbbed with each heartbeat. I felt like I was dissolving into the role, like the plague wasn’t just makeup, it was in my blood.

The Plague Doctor’s shadow flickered at the edge of my vision, always just out of reach, as if waiting for me to finally give in.

But I carried on. Somehow, I delivered every line, my voice cracking, my movements slow and heavy. The audience watched, silent, captivated by what they thought was masterful acting.

When the final scene ended, applause erupted like a tidal wave. Standing ovations, cheers echoing through the theatre. Again, the show was a complete success.

But backstage, as the crowd roared, I collapsed to the floor, shaking. The last thing I saw before the world spun into darkness was the Plague Doctor standing over me, his gloved hand outstretched as if to collect what was left of me.

I hadn’t wanted to come back here. Not after the Plague Doctor. The fever, the sores, the endless nights of shivering beneath my blankets. I still wasn’t sure if any of it had been real or just the role sinking too deep. But the fear, the lingering dread, that was real enough.

Claire found me just as I was about to walk away. Her eyes were bright, almost pleading.

“Please,” she said, voice low, “I need you for one last role. The Timekeeper. It’s different, quiet, controlled. Nothing like before. You’ll have the stage to yourself. No elaborate costumes, no grotesque makeup. Just you and a clock.”

I shook my head, the ache in my joints reminding me of the Plague Doctor’s toll. “Claire, this has to be the last one.”

She nodded, almost sadly. “I understand. This *is* your last. And it’s important. The story... It’s about holding onto control when everything slips away. I think it suits you.”

Something about her tone made me uneasy. It wasn’t just hope, it was desperation. As if this role meant more to her than just a play.

I wanted to refuse. I wanted to run. But when she handed me the script, thin, worn, with a single phrase circled in red, something inside me whispered that this was unavoidable.

“Alright,” I said, swallowing hard. “One last role. Then I’m done.”

Claire smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Good. You’re going to be incredible.”

Rehearsals went smoothly. Too smoothly. There were no signs, no chills, no creeping sickness like before. The script was sparse, almost hypnotic in its simplicity. I found comfort in the predictability of the lines, the steady rhythm of the clock ticking offstage.

Claire watched me with a quiet intensity, as if waiting for something to happen. But nothing did. I began to believe this was truly my last role, that maybe I could walk away with some shred of peace.

Opening night arrived without fanfare. The small crowd settled into their seats; the stage bathed in a soft, golden light. I stepped out, heavy costume trailing behind me, and took my place beside the ancient clock.

I spoke the lines, my voice steady and calm:  
*"I keep the hours, the minutes, the seconds, forever more."*

The audience listened.  The clock’s hands moved steadily, marking time with an almost unnatural precision. When the final line left my lips, the applause was warm, genuine.

But as I bowed, the ticking didn’t stop. It grew louder, until it wasn’t just a ticking. It was a pounding, a hammering in my chest.

I felt my knees buckle. The stage around me blurred, the faces in the crowd melting into shadow. The clock’s hands spun wildly, faster and faster, until they became a cyclone pulling me in.

The cyclone of clock hands sucked me in until everything went black. Then, without warning, I was back on stage. The spotlight hit me like a hot blade; the ancient clock frozen at midnight beside me. The audience was silent, their faces expectant, waiting.

I blinked, trying to steady myself, but I was already speaking the line, the words spilling out of me without control.  
*"I keep the hours, the minutes, the seconds, forever more."*

The audience listened, just like before. The clock’s hands began their steady, mechanical march. When the applause came, it was the same warm, expectant sound as always.

But this wasn’t memory, It was time repeating itself.

The same performance. The same crowd. The same stage. Over and over again.

I don’t know how long it’s been. Time itself has There is no day, no night, only the stage, the spotlight, and the relentless ticking of the clock. I can’t leave. I can’t stop.

But this isn’t madness. I’m still me, at least, I think I am. And I need help.

If anyone reading this ever hears the story of the Timekeeper, knows this play, or even sees that old clock, I’m begging you.

Help me break the cycle.
