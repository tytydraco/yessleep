My mind had shattered, slowly and methodically, into confused fragments and tiny, shrieking pieces. I remember days just laying in bed, not eating, staring at the ceiling. I remember the skittering of the shadow people in the corners. But most of all, I remember the voices screaming at me all the time. It was my mother’s voice most of all, that insane, grating cry.

“Wet your bed again, and I’ll cut it off!” she screamed harshly. The voice seemed to come from all around me, shaking the walls and the ceiling. But I was still laying alone in my bed. No one else was here. Logically, a part of myself knew it, but I could still hear her shrieking voice, that lunatic, raspy shrieking.

I remember the first time my mother ever caught me stealing a piece of candy as a little boy. She dragged me, crying and pleading, into the kitchen. Then she turned the oven burner on high and grabbed my hand.

“This will teach you, you little shit,” she hissed as she quickly pushed my hand down. I think the screams from that day echoed across the decades, and that sometimes, even now, I still hear them.

\*\*\*

The door downstairs clicked and jiggled. I felt like a statue in the bed, emaciated and dirty. The ceiling seemed to be opening up into another world. A ragged patch about seven feet across crumbled down, revealing a paradise with rainbows and bright green rolling hills and puffy clouds beyond. But in this dank place, my flesh body stayed and rotted, surrounded by garbage and filthy dishes with larvae squirming on them.

Out of my peripheral vision, I saw policemen and paramedics rushing in, their cold, attentive eyes quickly scanning the room. Mixed in with them, though, the shadow people skittered and writhed.

They grabbed me, but I couldn’t tell if the hands were the flesh of humanity or the cold void of the shadow people. I looked up at the opening in the ceiling. It seemed to wave me forward. I felt myself floating out of my body toward the land of milk and honey as the blue skies and eternal sunshine there beckoned me forwards.

I glanced back. The shadow people swarmed all over my filthy, broken flesh shell, but I knew I had escaped their clutches. Working together, the paramedics and shadow beings took my body away, but I felt grateful, knowing I had just left behind a fate worse than death.

\*\*\*

Time passed, but I don’t know how much. I lived in the world of forever sunshine and clear streams and endless forests.

I would glance back through the opening occasionally, seeing my body made of meat still laying there. Men in white coats stood among the shadow people in a brightly-lit, clean room with curtains. The shadow people took their razor-sharp fingers and traced invisible sickness all over my body. Other shadow people gnashed and clawed at the men in the white coats. I knew that their attacks didn’t leave physical marks. They were more like radiation in a way. If a shadow person reached inside someone’s body and traced its dagger-like finger across their liver, that person would have liver failure or liver cancer within months. I had seen it happen many times.

The shadow creatures attacked me all over. With each brutal assault, it seemed like I lost more and more of myself. I turned away, sickened. I would always return back toward the land of sunshine and rolling hills, but as I looked around there, it seemed more like a prison than ever before. I was alone in these forests, set to wander under the beautiful springtime hills for eternity. Perhaps this place was Hell. Perhaps, instead of fire, it used boredom to burn, just like a prison. I heard the men in the white coats speaking through the opening that always followed behind me.

“It’s a rather severe case of catatonia with catalepsy and mutism,” one of them with glasses said. “He has a prior diagnosis of schizophrenia, but it seems to have gotten much, much worse.”

“Does he have any past history of catatonia?” the bald man in a white coat asked. The man with glasses shook his head, looking grimly down at my body made of meat. The rest of the men looked on with slightly bored expressions. One turned and left the room, jutting something down on a clipboard. The shadow creatures followed close behind, twisting and thrashing on the walls and ceilings like salamanders from Hell.

“No reported history of mutism or waxy flexibility or any other typical signs,” the man with glasses responded, giving a low sigh. “Well, he’s not responding to benzodiazepines, so we’ll start him on electroconvulsive therapy and continue the lorazepam for now. We’ll also keep the feeding tube.”

“So what are you putting down as the official diagnosis?” the bald one asked. The man with glasses wrote something down on his clipboard.

“Withdrawn catatonia resulting from severe, untreated paranoid schizophrenia,” he responded. “We’ll have to get an involuntary commitment form signed by a judge. Tell the nurses to rustle up an extra inpatient bed in psych. He’s gonna need it…”

\*\*\*

The next few days slipped by as before. I watched them wheel my body into a room with lots of machines. They put a robin’s egg blue mouth guard with a breathing hole in it between my teeth. They rubbed a gel on my forehead and started attaching circular electrodes to my skin. The shadow monsters flitting around seemed to laugh and dance.

They supposedly give ECT patients drugs to put them to sleep, but I saw the whole thing from that other world. Perhaps there are more things in existence than doctors ever dreamed possible.

I watched my body jerk in seizure after seizure as the electricity hit it. I felt myself being ripped from the dream-world I had inhabited. I fell through the opening towards my silent, thin body. It lay there, as pale and still as a corpse.

As we rejoined, I thought I could hear the laughing of the shadow people.

\*\*\*

“Ugghh…” I groaned. My eyes flew open. I saw time had passed, though I had no idea how much. I wasn’t in that surgical room anymore with the kicking, seizing surges of electricity and the doctors who showed far too many teeth in their smiles. Now I was alone.

Every part of my body seemed to hurt. My back shrieked at me as stabbing pains ran up and down my spine. I sat up suddenly in the darkness, looking around.

I was laying on a thin mattress in a room with oppressive, brutalist concrete walls. I blinked quickly, my eyes adjusting slightly. A thin trickle of light came in through a window. Metal bars crisscrossed it. Outside, I saw the bloody red glow of a sunset, or maybe it was a sunrise. The dark crimson light streamed down through roll after roll of razor wire and high, sharp fences.

I stumbled out of bed toward the door, ripping it open. Bright fluorescent light streamed into the suffocating gray room. They flickered and strobed, casting eerie shadows dancing up and down the hallway. I didn’t see a single person.

Empty medical carts stood on the sides. Bloody scalpels and knives were thrown haphazardly on top of one. I saw the drawers ripped open, some of them broken off. One of the half-cocked, crooked drawers contained dismembered human fingers, lined up carefully like an open package of hotdogs. Used needles and chunks of broken brick and cement littered the gray floors. I also saw splatters of something red, and chunks of what looked like liver.

Flies swarmed around them, and a sudden wave of fetid reek reached me as I stood on the threshold. I backed up, nearly vomiting. I retched for a moment, my eyes watering as I breathed through my mouth, trying not to smell the putrefaction.

I looked back into the room, realizing there was a sign above the bed, one I hadn’t seen in the darkness. It looked ancient and was covered in thick layers of dust and yellowing nicotine stains. I squinted, getting closer and trying to read it.

RULES FOR PATIENTS’ WELL-BEING AND SURVIVAL WHILE IN WHITING PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

1. Do not leave doors open. That invites *them* in.
2. If you must go into the keyroom, get out before the guard notices you.
3. You must make an offering of raw meat to the Keeper if you wish to pass from one level to another on the stairwell.

I stared for a few interminable seconds at the sign, wondering what the punchline was. I looked around, expecting someone to jump out and try to scare me, or perhaps announce that it was all a prank and being recorded. But nothing changed. Still imprisoned in the cube of gray concrete with ancient, strobing lights streaming in from the hallway, I felt a sudden coldness run through my body.

I glanced at the open door with a shrinking feeling in my chest. For a brief moment, in the flickering lights, I thought I saw a pale face with wide, excited eyes peeking around the corner. The fluorescent lights made “tink-tink-tink” sounds as they strobed in the hallway, sending their eerie glare into every corner of the room.

“Hello?” I whispered, tiptoeing toward the door. “Is… is someone…” I was cut off by an eerie, congested breathing, a long, raspy inhalation, as if a corpse with dirt and worms in its throat had just come back to life. My heart raced at a hundred miles an hour, beating hard in my ears.

“Dax…” the voice gurgled, calling my name. I heard more ragged, choked breath faintly echoing from further down the hall. I backpedaled quickly, looking for some sort of weapon. But everything was bolted down to the ground, even the bed. Unless I wanted to try suffocating these eldritch creatures with a thin hospital pillow, there was absolutely nothing of use in this room.

My mind flashed back to the medical cart in the hallway with bloody scalpels and surgical instruments littered over the top of it. A long, white arm reached around the corner of the door. Breathing hard, I put my head down and sprinted straight for the medical cart. It was so close, maybe only twenty feet away, but at the time, that twenty feet seemed like twenty miles.

I heard a choked gasp as the unknown creature lunged forward, wrapping its cold, pale arms around my neck. I glimpsed the deep, suppurating sores eaten into the flesh, the way the bones poked out through the tips of the fingers. Maggots writhed in black, necrotic gashes dug into its skin. I saw long, black hair fall over my vision and smelled the odor of rotten tomatoes and decaying meat. And though this happened a few days ago and I did end up escaping that wretched place, sometimes I think I still smell that fetid odor in the air- and my heart freezes.

“Dax…” it hissed in my ear as it wrapped its freezing hands around my neck. “Give me… your warmth.” I tried throwing the thing off as it squeezed, cutting my breath off. In panic, I thrashed my arms, slowly pulling the corpse towards the medical cart. I tried reaching back and gouging out its eyes, but my fingers just kept sliding off the dead, loose flesh.

Further down the hall, I saw three more pale, white figures, limping slowly towards the commotion like moths drawn to a flame. I got a good look at them, realizing they had once been women with long, black hair. Now they looked like the walking dead.

Deep, black gashes ran through their skin. Garish autopsy stitches ran up and down their chests. They had on light green hospital gowns stained with a rainbow of fluids that I couldn’t even try to identify, though a lot of it was clearly blood. Their eyes had taken on a filmy, faded look. Their plodding, limping steps brought them incrementally closer as their eyes twitched to the left and right.

I was still too far from the cart, and I knew I had lost. My vision started to turn black as the fingers tightened, fingers whose skin was falling off. The sharp claws of bone dug into my neck. I would have screamed, but I had no air.

Then something heavy and fast hit us, and we both went flying. The fingers flew off my neck. I looked up, seeing a giant man with a dark, cross-eyed stare. He was breathing hard, his chest heaving as he looked down at the pale, undead woman who had tried to strangle me. I saw he was wearing the garb of a patient at a psych ward, a white T-shirt and khaki pants with slippers. I looked down, realizing I was wearing the same outfit. Someone must have changed my clothes while I was unconscious.

With a lunatic gleam on his face, he stared down at me and the undead abomination. He was holding a gleaming buck knife soaked with fresh blood. He ran forward. I screamed.

But he didn’t attack me. With a crunching sound, he brought the knife down through the undead woman’s milky left eye. It pierced deep into her skull with a soft cracking of bone and the sound of spurting blood. Her legs kicked and twisted for a couple moments as she writhed on the filthy, gray floor. Pieces of broken glass and the tips of used needles dug into her loose, white flesh. Black blood poured out of the wounds, a waterfall of it gushing from her head.

The man reached down, pulling his knife out with a sickening, sucking sound. He put out one giant, callused hand toward me and I quickly grabbed it. With strength like an ox, he ripped me up off the ground.

“We need to get out of here,” he said in a low, flat monotone. He pushed me forward, down the hallway in the opposite direction from the rest of the undead women, who were now only a couple steps away. “Run!”

Even though my head was pounding and I was terrified and confused, I sprinted for my life. The large man was faster than me, and I ended up following him down the hallway. It split to the left and right, but he seemed to know where he was going. He veered to the left and pushed open a cracked door around the corner whose sign read “Janitorial Closet”. After ushering me inside, he slammed it shut and turned the deadbolt.

We found ourselves in total darkness, until he pulled on a string hanging next to a bare, incandescent bulb. Its light covered the small closet in a dim, yellow glow. The man extended his left hand toward me. I shook it, wincing as his iron grip crushed the bones in my palm.

“I’m Freddie,” he said in his slow, plodding way. One of his eyes stared at the wall while the other looked at me. His right hand still gripped the knife tightly. The blood dripping off the point of the blade made soft, repetitive, tapping sounds as they smacked against the ground. “You must have a death wish leaving your door open like that.”

“I’m Dax. And I just got here. I had no idea those… things would be in the hallways, peeking around corners.” I heard something sharp being dragged lightly against the other side of the door. I could imagine those horrific, undead women dragging their rotted, claw-like fingers over the surface of the battered wood only a few inches away. I thought I could hear the faintest trace of a gurgling breath, and I shuddered. “So I guess those rules are real?” Freddie’s face darkened like an approaching thundercloud as I brought up the list of rules. He nodded grimly.

“They are as real and as serious as death,” he said. “I don’t know who put them up, but they’re the only reason I’ve stayed alive this long. They’re in every patient room. How did you get here?” I told Freddie about the catatonic state I had gotten trapped in, the land of eternal sunshine and the shadow people, the electroconvulsive therapy I had seen my own body subjected to and, finally, waking up here.

“There was a lady in my town. She had real bad mental problems. Real bad,” he said, shaking his head. “She used to get catatonia, too. We had a few statues and wells downtown. It was just a small town, but what town doesn’t have a few statues, right?” I nodded. “Well, the lady used to walk over, slowly and confusedly, almost like a robot that doesn’t know how to use its legs. Once she got near a statue, she would freeze. Sometimes she would have one arm bent upwards at a ninety-degree angle, or she would be posed like the Statue of Liberty.” He started giggling.

“And she would just stay like that forever, if you let her. I mean, until she died or collapsed or whatever, obviously. But someone would have to come and get her. They’d have a couple strong guys come and pick her up and put her in the back of a car. When they carried her out, it looked like they were carrying out an actual statue. She would be stiff and rigid as a mannequin.

“And sometimes, my family would drive through downtown, and she’d be out there, stiff as a statue, and my daddy would say, ‘Ah, goddammit, there’s ol’ Becky again, doing her rigor mortis routine.’ And I would laugh, but deep inside, a piece of me also cried, because even though it was kinda funny to me back then, even as a kid, I knew something was deeply wrong and disturbing about the whole thing. I mean, she would literally stand there until she froze to death if someone didn’t come grab her.” I nodded, feeling suddenly very tired.

“Is there any food or water around here? My head is pounding,” I said, grabbing my forehead and rubbing rhythmically in circles to try to relieve the horrific migraine pulsating hot agony in time with my heart.

“Well, there’s the cafeteria on the ground floor, but we’d have to go through the stairwell… you’re on the third floor right now, you see. And it’s no big deal, really, but…” I remembered the rules and smiled.

“But we need to feed some eldritch beast with raw meat, right?” I asked, giving him a half-smile. He nodded. He reached into his pocket and pulled out another blood-stained folding knife, handing it over to me handle-first.

“We can just cut a chunk out of that corpse in the hallway,” he responded blankly, not showing a shred of emotion as he talked about feeding human meat to the stairway master. “He’s not so bad, really… or it, I guess, because I’m not even sure if those things have males and females.”

“What does that mean?” I asked, my curiosity mixing with a sense of dread. He just shook his head.

“You’ll see in a minute, won’t you? Come on, let’s go get some water. I could use a drink, too, and you don’t want to try drinking out of the sinks in the bathrooms. Last time I did that, they started gushing warm, salty blood and I nearly threw up. God, it tasted foul.” He wrinkled his face as if the memory of that experience still left a nasty taste in his mouth.

“Thanks for the tip,” I said as he unlocked the door and we went out into the hallway and back into danger.
