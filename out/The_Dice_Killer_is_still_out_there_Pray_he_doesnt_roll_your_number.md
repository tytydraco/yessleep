*The following is an interview by Detective Tamara Lu with retired Detective Jeremy Moore regarding the Dice Killer. It was meant for internal use only, but for the good of the community, I feel like it’s my duty to share it. If you have any information that might lead to the killer’s capture, please contact local police immediately.*

**Lu: Thanks so much for coming in today. Before we get to the new information you wanted to discuss, would you mind providing a bit of context? I’m still getting up to speed on the details of the case, and it would be useful for the record anyway.**

Moore: Of course. My name is Jeremy Moore, formerly a detective on the force here, aged 66. I’ve been retired for about a year now, and I suppose I should be letting more things go, but that never was my strong suit.

I was the one who kept working the Cyclops Killer case over in San Leandro when everyone else assumed it had gone cold. It was my call to pull all the records of one-eyed men in their fifties, which as you may know is what eventually cracked the whole thing open.

That’s why they brought me in on the Dice Killer case. They figured if anyone could crack it, it would be me. My wife Lily and I moved here specifically so I could work the case.

**Lu: Take me back to those early days when you first joined the task force?**

Moore: Sure. This was maybe back in 2015. By then, he’d already hit maybe eight or nine houses. After his murders, the killer left dice on the doorstep to each victim’s house, the numbers matching the address.

It became the department’s working theory that in order to keep his victims totally random, the killer simply rolled the dice, using the numbers that came up to choose his next target.

**Lu: Sure. And the streets themselves?**

Moore: There had been a popular map of the town released back in the 90’s with a grid layout, 1-6 on the vertical axis. A-F on the horizontal. It became our assumption that the killer used this map in conjunction with the dice.

As time went on, it also became apparent that the killer employed exactly six methods of execution, which would be applied wholesale to each set of victims: gunshot, stabbing, smothering, bludgeoning, drowning, and electrocution. It was assumed that these two were chosen at random beforehand.

**Lu: Jesus. How do you drown a whole family?**

Moore: In some cases, a sedative was used. Tracing the chemicals led to a total dead end–a theft at a veterinarian's office.

**Lu: At some point, the case became… political, right? Can you tell me a little about that?**

Moore: Sure. As the theory leaked to the public, the city government received a flood of applications for new addresses that contained numbers other than one through six. So, for example, the Griffith family asked for 364 Terra Avenue to become 368, the new number offering a halo of protection.

Things got a little heated when certain friends of the mayor got priority renumbering over others. The whole thing turned into a cluster–you know.

As time went on and the murders continued, a city councilman proposed appending a zero to all addresses, but the idea ended up dying in committee after a rival politician bristled at the idea of repainting all of the numbers on the curbs.

**Lu: So… killer on the loose. Mayor’s office completely useless. You were stuck.**

Moore: We did what we could. Planted loaded dice at local stores, setting up stings at housed addressed 111 or 2222. It never came to anything.

As time went on and our lack of leads became obvious, fear took hold and dark incidents of mob violence flared up. An elderly man from out of town was beaten within an inch of his life after picking up a Yahtzee set at the local Target for his grandson’s birthday.

All the while, new incidents continued to occur, also at seemingly random intervals. Sometimes, it would be between one to six days. Other times it was eleven or sixty-three days between incidents, but never seven days, never thirty-nine or seventy-two.

By the time I retired, the killer had hit twenty-eight houses. More would follow. I hate to admit it, but when I sold my old house and bought a condo to retire in, I checked to make sure the address had seven, eight or a nine or zero in it. Same went for my son’s family. I refused to cosign on a loan unless it had one of those numbers.

**Lu: Which brings us to the… present incident.**

Moore: Right. That occurred just a couple of days ago. I was taking my grandsons to the Rick’s Comics to buy a pack of Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

**Lu: Kind of a Pokemon thing?**

Moore: Close enough. It’s kind of our routine–we get the cards and then go for ice cream at the Fudge Factory two blocks away.

I still have good memories of going to Rick’s back in my teens, when I got really into Captain America comics. Every time I walk in, the smell of old paper hits me and sends me back to those days, scouring the long white boxes for issues I didn’t have, trying to fill in the gaps of the backstory, trying to make it all make sense.

While the kids looked around, I started flipping through the old stuff and found a few issues from the 70’s that I wondered if I’d ever read. I guess I got distracted, because I looked up to see a man walking out the door with a big paper bag, practically bursting.

I watched as he loaded it up with the last of his purchases: a few plastic tubes loaded with what looked like rocks, except they were colorful and made of lots of different shapes: little pyramids, and soccer-ball type things.

Seeing me watch him, he quickly loaded up the last of his purchases and left without another word. I wish I’d gotten a good look at him, but he was wearing an N-95 and a winter hat. All I can say is he was maybe 5’10. Medium build. Average joe.

As the guy left, I approached the cashier and asked what the man had been buying. And he said, D&D stuff. I asked him to be a little more specific, and he said gaming dice.

**Lu: I don’t follow.**

Moore: See, in these games, you can’t just use dice with six sides. Certain spells or axes or whatever have a five in eight chance to work. Or… maybe your dagger does one to four damage. So these dice, some of them have four sides. Other ones have twenty.

As soon as I heard what he’d bought, I sprinted out into the street, but the guy was gone. Totally in the wind. I’d been right there, right in the same fucking room with him.

**Lu: Or it could have been some random nerd spending his birthday money from grandma.**

Moore: It was him.

**Lu: If you were that close, maybe he’ll slip up again.**

Moore: You don’t get it. He must have bought five hundred dice that day. And it’s not one through six now. It’s anything. When I was working the case, it wasn’t \*actually\* random. One through six. That’s a limit. That’s something you can contain.

Now there’s no safe address in this whole fucking city. Any number is in play. Any number. My house isn’t safe anymore. My son's either. Anyone. Any night.

Every night I’m sitting there in a car in my son’s driveway, gun in hand, ready to go. Sometimes, I’m shaking with fear and sometimes I’m just numb. Sometimes, I’m sure I’ll still be the one to take him down, and sometimes I know I’m destined to fail.

But I know he’s coming. Give him long enough and the right number will pop up. It’s just a matter of when. He’s coming for all of us. Every last one.

**Lu: So what do we do?**

Moore: You hope. You hope that one day he rolls a pair of twenties when he’s picking his time between houses and has to wait 2020 days. Or you hope he rolls his own street, his own house when he’s deciding who dies next and ends up offing himself.

You just hope the dice roll [in your favor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
