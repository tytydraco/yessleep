A figure keeps me from sleeping. 

It started one night, when I woke from sleep.  Feeling like I was being watched.   

I usually sleep with the covers pulled over my head.  Completely enveloping my eyes in darkness.  I normally sleep peacefully through the night, and never woke in a panic.  This night was different. 

I heard a whistle.  I reasoned that I must be dreaming.  I reasoned that this has to be sleep paralysis, which I’d read so much about.  Then I heard the whistle again, and knew that it was reality. 

I threw the covers off of my head, and saw a dark figure at the end of my bed.  An entity of pure blackness.  I vividly remember his form, an old time figure with a top hat, staring at me as I slept. 

I then awoke in the morning, as if the incident had just been a dream.  I reasoned that it must have been a dream.  Sometimes, I have dreams that I wake up in my bed, and the dream continues.   

Surely this was no different, it had left a psychological mark, sure.  It had instilled a fear in me that I hadn’t felt before.  I’d felt a realness in this experience that hadn’t previously occurred in nightmares of the past.  This time surely wasn’t different...right? 

It seems that my previous inclinations were incorrect.  The fear I felt that night has either broken my psyche, or I am experiencing the presence of a real entity.  Every night I awake in the darkness.  I pull the covers back from my head and see the dark figure at the end of my bed.  A man of pure blackness, with the dark outline of a top hat sitting upon his head. 

The experiences are growing prolonged.  I lower the covers, see the man at the end of my bed, and cover my eyes once again.  Laying in fear.  Fear of the unknown, fear of what the figure at the end of my bed really is, fear of what he might do to me.  The length of time I lay in fear, seemingly awake, has continued to increase.  It feels longer and longer, with each passing night. 

Every night is the same.  I lay there with my face covered.  Praying that he isn’t real.  Eventually, morning comes, and I awake, as if from a normal dream.  As if nothing strange has occurred at all.  

I don’t know where to turn for help.  I feel as if my life is going to end soon.  End in a way that is unnatural.  I fear that whatever afterlife the normal person experiences, will not be experienced by me.  I feel as if this darkness will hover over me for all of eternity. 

If you know anyone who has had a similar experience, or has found help, please tell me.  I beg you.  I’ve talked to many people about this.  Everyone dismisses it as delusions, hallucinations, etc.  I don’t believe this to be the case, but I pray that they’re right.  Please help.
