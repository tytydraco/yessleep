PART 1

What’s the worst thing you’ve ever done? Was it horrible? Unspeakable? Straight up Evil maybe? Was it bad enough for you to end up in hell for eternity over? I ponder those questions as I sit here typing away on this keyboard with an uncertain future. I did terrible things in my life sure. But I never really considered myself evil.

I didn’t remember how I died. And for those of you wondering how I’m on this earth posting this… Well we will get to that. All I remember is waking up in a haze. My senses were groggy. My throat was dry and my eyes hurt. It was dark, almost pitch black, wherever I was. The air was hot and sticky. It reeked of rotten and burning meat. I tried to cry out. But my throat had trouble producing the words. Like I said, my throat was dry. I tried to move but my muscles screamed as I lifted my arms. That was when I realized I’d been chained to the floor. I pulled a little harder. The chains were heavy. But I still managed to move. They made this god awful screech as they were drug across the hard floor. I groaned as I pulled them. The last thing I was expecting, was the voice.
“Mr. David Stone….” The voice called out. It seemingly came from all directions at once.

“Wh-Where?”
“Where you are is not important. Now, listen to my instructions very carefully. I won’t repeat myself. All you need to know is that you exist now as a battery. And I am the one assigned to make sure you stay charged.”
“What?” I asked.

A sudden shock of electricity came flooding through me. My muscles tensed as I screamed I’m agony.

“Don’t interrupt me.” The voice sneered. The voice wasn’t particularly deep or intimidating. It did seem hollow and void of any kind of emotion. I couldn’t tell if it belonged to a male or female.

“Now, in order for you to stay charged. There are various things I must make you feel. None of them will you find pleasurable. You will cry. You will feel pain like you’ve never felt while you were alive on earth. You will beg me for death. But in the end. Your calls for mercy will fall on deaf ears. There is no mercy down here. Only suffering. Take consolation in the knowledge that your sacrifice, be it deserved or not, will serve to benefit Gehenna and all of its denizens. In the end, your suffering is the most honorable thing your kind will ever accomplish in its entire miserable existence.”

I sat there silently, my muscles still aching from the electric current that had just torn through me. My eyes still trying to scan the darkness. What was Gehenna? Was I here to be tortured? My mind was having trouble trying to comprehend.

“I’m sure you have several questions, Mr. Stone. Unfortunately, I run a tight ship and have little time on my hands. So I’ll allow you one.”
My mind was still far from being stable. I had so many questions but I just couldn’t bring any to my lips. I strained for a second before I got to my feet.

“Who are you?” I asked with a horse voice that was almost a whisper. “My name is Saxon. You will address me as Master!”

That was when the lights came on. I found myself sitting in a glass box that seemed to float a few feet from the ground. The chains wrapped around me were blacker than black. They were crude in their design. I wondered how they’d managed to get electric currents through it. But I only wondered for a split second as my eyes shot up to the being standing before me. It looked like man, but it was far from human. Its body was human, it was pale, almost paper white. Its head looked like that of an angry lizard. It’s features were reptilian, from the slits where it’s nose should be to the inky black eyes. I could make out a row of sharp serrated looking teeth behind its thin lips. The creature showed no expression towards me. It just stared into my very soul. I froze in fear as we locked eyes.

“Welcome to Gehenna, Mr. Stone. Or as you humans say, Welcome to Hell!”
The next few hours were a blur as I regained my senses. The chains had fallen off. My glass box had been moved into a giant row of glass boxes. Each of them had their own occupant. Most were men from what I could tell. Everyone sat in a corner kind of just staring out into space. I think that was when it actually dawned on me that everyone, including myself, was completely naked. Naked and mostly hairless. I remember running my hand across my now bald head as I turned around. My muscles ached with every movement.

“It grows back. Then they shave it. Makes us easier to torture.” A voice said from the cell next to me.

“What?” I asked as my eyes met his. The man in the cell next to mine was a tall, broad, and hairless black guy who had a wide smile across his face.

“Your hair. For your denizen body.” He said as he pointed to his head. “My denizen what?” I asked. “Your denizen body. At least that’s what the Hellspawn around here call it. It’s the body they assign your soul too when it comes down!”
I was a bit confused and my face showed it. He only chuckled a bit. “You must be really new here! Tell me, do your muscles hurt? Like when you move?” he asked. I nodded.

“That’s because you’ve never used them before. Your body was grown in the flesh pits on the second level. When you died, your soul was sent straight there and then assigned a function. I guess you drew the short straw, cause you get to be a battery!”

“A battery for what?” I asked. The man put his hands up, “All of this! This place feeds off of negative energy.”
I was still confused as hell. But my brain started to register. I raised a brow at him as I stepped closer to the wall.

“So I’m dead? And this is hell?” The man nodded.
 “Do you remember your name yet?” he asked. I thought hard about it. I wasn’t sure about my name. I didn’t even know who I was. 

“The uhh.. The creature called me David.” I said. “Well… David. My name is Dwayne.” “Like the Rock?” I asked.
“Rock?” he asked with a confused look. My brain went fuzzy for a second. I’d actually remembered something. 
“He’s an actor. Big dude, used to be a wrestler!” Dwayne shook his head from side to side.
 “I’m going to be completely honest with you, David. I was killed in nineteen-seventy-two.” “How?” I asked. “Nam! How’d you die?” he replied. I sighed as I tried to remember. He only took a deep breath.

“It’ll come back to you.” My thought process, however, was interrupted by a buzzer that rang so loud it made my ears hurt. My hands shot to my ears as I dropped to my knees. My ears were ringing and I could feel blood beginning to gush out. 
Then, just as fast as it started, it stopped.
“What was that?” I asked as my eyes tilted over to Dwayne. 
“Torture time.” The man said as he got back to his feet.
 “Torture time?” I asked. “Twenty-three hours a day! Used to be longer but the hellspawn all went on strike!”

“Seriously?” I asked.

Dwayne smirked at me, “No… Rumor has it-“ Dwayne’s speech was interrupted by a sudden spike that shot up from the floor of his cube. It was thin and translucent like the glass that made up the cube itself. It went through the bottom of his foot and through his armpit before exiting the shoulder. Dwayne groaned in pain as his hand shot out and grabbed it. A crimson pool had already started below him.

“Oh, God!” I said as I tried to keep myself from vomiting. My luck, however, wasn’t any better as a spike came horizontally in my cell. I tried to dodge, I thought maybe I could duck out of the way. But it was a stupid and foolish idea. The spike hit me in the right side of my chest before exploding through my back. Blood splattered all over the back of my cell. I screamed in agony as another spike flew through my back and exploded out of my stomach.
I could feel the hot tears and blood flowing down my face. The pain was indescribable. I looked over at Dwayne, who winced as another spike came flying through his back and out his front.

The last thing I remember was looking at one of the glass walls. It seemed to vibrate at a certain point. Almost like a disturbance in water from a specific angle before a spike came flying directly at my face.
When I woke up. I found myself floating in a pool of a warm sticky fluid. I was still in my glass box though. I groaned as my body went vertical. My feet touched the ground and my eyes shot directly ahead of myself. Where Saxon stood with a disappointed look on his face. “Mr. Stone… You’re not supposed to pass out during your draining sessions. You only lasted twenty seconds. Each session lasts twenty-three hours.” I could feel myself about to say something, but then I remembered the last time I’d spoken out of line.

“I know you’re new down here. It takes time to adjust.”
I felt the area on my forehead where the spike had impaled my face. I could hear Saxon exhale at this.

 “You’re not dead, because your body was grown to regenerate. You can come back from any wound, it helps one last a bit longer during our sessions. The only thing that could really kill your body is one of these,” He said as he held up a obsidian black short sword.

“A weapon from our armory.”

I didn’t say anything in response. I just watched the weapon as he moved it around. My mind immediately wondering how I could take it from him and bust out of here. Only problem was, he seemed to notice. My thought process was interrupted by a sudden and abrupt shock that made my muscles clamp up. I roared in pain as I fell underneath the translucent liquid. I had my mouth open, the stuff burned like acid as it went down my throat and into my lungs.
It took me a second to come up for air and cough the substance up. I could see Saxon smile at me as he stepped closer to the glass. His sharp and serrated teeth were yellow and blood stained.

“Insubordination will not be tolerated, Mr Stone.”

By now I could feel the anger rising in my gut. I wanted to get out and kill this thing. But I didn’t know how. I could only glare at him through the glass as he turned and walked away. The liquid in my box slowly started to drain. I found myself covered in it. My cell moved itself back into the line of other cells. Where I saw Dwayne trying his best to reattach one of his arms. I inhaled as I watched the veins and muscles seemingly stitch themselves together. It looked disgusting. It also looked painful, Dwayne winced hard as the muscles and sinus reconnected.

“Don’t worry about him. No one stays conscious the whole day.” He said with a grunt. 

“What?” 

“Those that do are taken to another level. Most of them are fucking sadists anyway.”

 “Where are they taken?” I asked.

Dwayne shrugged. “Never been out of this box! You’re lucky you came on the spike day. Yesterday we were eaten by hellhounds.” 

My eyes got big as i exhaled. This was the new forever for me. I sat down and leaned my back against the wall. 

The sticky substance that’d slathered up my body acted as an adhesive. I felt like my back was coated in syrup and I’d laid down against something. I didn’t really care though. My mind thought on Saxon’s sword.

That was when another image flashed through my mind. I remembered being on a rooftop. I was surrounded by men in black uniforms that’d all had assault rifles aimed at me. I had my pistol raised at them as well. It was cold outside, quite possibly the middle of winter. To my right stood a priest. I couldn’t tell you his name if I tried. But he was on my side. I had thought we were about to die. I was ready to die right there. But someone saved us. It was a man, a man in a black metallic suit of armor. One who wielded a short sword that was glowing a neon blue color. The man cut through the soldiers like they were made of paper. He saved us.

My mind reeled from the memory. I took a deep breath as I looked across my cell at Dwayne. Who sat there watching me. Then I looked at the cell behind me. It was empty, I’d remembered there being a person in there when I’d first been brought in. I turned back to Dwayne with a perplexed look on my face.

“He’s today’s special battery.” Dwayne said with a sad look in his eye.

 “What’s that mean?” I asked. 
“Saxon’s special batteries get to power the appetites of the master himself.” “Appetites?”

As of on que, the man was being drug back in by two more larger men. Both of which were wearing thick black collars that seemed to be made of the same metal that had created my shackles from earlier. The glass on the cell slid open and the man was sloppily tossed in. I watched the two burly men as they walked away. They actually wore baggy burlap looking pants. My eyes met one of two’s. The man seemed to immediately look away. Almost like he was afraid.

“Those are Saxon’s personal slaves. Every once in a while a soul comes through that he takes a liking too.” 
“Sounds a hell of a lot better than this.” I said. “Believe me… They’re not any better off then we are.” My eyes shifted to the man in the other cell. He was a chubbier man that was also completely hairless like we were. He was curled up in a ball in the center of his cell. I could hear him sobbing. My eyes shifted back to Dwayne.

“What did you mean by appetites?” I asked. 
Dwayne took a deep, shaky breath. “It depends on how Saxon is feeling that day. Sometimes he’s hungry…. Sometimes he’s horny… Sometimes he wants to do the torturing himself.”

I grunted and mumbled under my breath.

“You were thinking about taking his sword.. He can sense defiance you know! That one behind you, he was a Lawyer in Maryland before he was killed by some drug dealer. I think he abused his wife. Came down here and immediately started making demands. Threatened to sue several times. He was defiant until he became the favorite battery. He’s been the favorite battery since he came here.”

“When was that?” I asked.
 “Ten maybe fifteen years ago…. No ones even thought twice about crossing Saxon since. Not that we could if we tried.” I sighed as I leaned my head back and closed my eyes.

 “I can see the defiance in your eyes David. Do yourself a favor, don’t buy into it.”

It was too little, too late however. I’d already made up my mind. I was gonna find a way to kill this Saxon. I didn’t care if it took me a hundred or a thousand years. I could do it. I would do it.
