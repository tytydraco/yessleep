Picture this scene: the room is ultra-dark, you’re pressed against the sofa cushions by a strong man with his wet tongue stroking your neck, the sofa and cushions are not that soft, and your head is turned, stretched even, facing just the right angle to stare out the window and into the neighbor’s lit-up attic, where a shimmering light glows up the face of a doll and it is so far away you can’t make out any of its expression. It becomes a game for you to make out what its face is telling, but no matter how many times you get pinned against that sofa, you never figure out what it tries to tell you.

It has been 11 years. I am now 21 years old year, an outsider trans girl turned barista for a company that sells primarily to white cis mall babes, and I have been planning on re-taking my rightful first steps into adulthood with my best and only childhood friend, Kyle. (Yeah, he lives every bit up to his name—a hype-beast who peaked during his High School football years and DJs for a trashy nightclub, who acts unrestingly like he has been force-fed Monster Energy drinks since he was an infant when really, it’s probably ADHD.) His dad, Bob, loyally has promised to pick us up from the nightclub at midnight when Kyle’s playtime is over—for our safety. Bob’s a *“Bob”* the same way Kyle’s a *“Kyle”,* a man who could be anyone so his friends, colleagues, and family had to nickname him *“Bob the Builder”,* which clarifies him… He works construction, and I guess people have always thought of him as stereotypically kind and normal. My parents have heritage in the Middle East; they fight loudly, and regularly and are not well-liked around our block (luckily my younger and older siblings have turned out better people so far), so we automatically stick out, and since tonight is my first time going out, I’ve had to keep it a secret from them.

I hang out with Kyle after my shift has ended, going to random local thrift stores, and we’re about to exit the most moldy-smelling one when a fat doll pops up out of nowhere. It looks like it has been sitting there collecting dust for the past 11 years. I know it is the right one, the one from the attic. Even though I was never able to read its expression, its hair, clothes and shape are too recognizable for it to be any other. Finally seeing its expression up close feels like a sudden anticlimax. It has gone from a hazy mystery to an average-looking vintage doll staring right back at me.

Without letting Kyle know why, I buy it. Perhaps I don’t know the reason myself, why I feel like I should own it (where would I even put it? I still live at my parent’s). We don’t have time to go back to my place, so we head straight to the nightclub where Kyle will be practicing since he’s still new, and we have a couple of mutual friends there who co-own it.

“What the fuck is that?” is the question of the night, referring to the 3-pound heavy baby I’m carrying around awkwardly. “Sorry, that’s our new friend, I forgot to introduce you,” I say. “Who the fuck brings a doll to a nightclub anyways?” Kyle is not happy about it, being my opposite in many ways, as straight and masculine as a hammer or spanner.

When they start with the drinks, I am sober in the most “epiphany” kind of way—that is, I simultaneously care less and less about how I stick out and feel like I don’t belong here, and really am glad that I don’t get hammered by alcohol the way that they do. My fat doll becomes attractive to their drunk minds, a genuinely amusing play tool that gets passed around in a circle used mockingly as a Lolita and less offensively as a hostage to their strong and sour alcoholic breaths. I give in to their caricatured selves, the tension around my neck loosens up, and I too engage in their mockery and silly dancing.

At some point, I forget keeping track of time and checking my phone for new messages and notifications. People stream in like silverfish on a bathroom floor until the club is filled with people in slick and shiny clothes. The pumping loud music is making me feel dizzy even though I’ve had nothing but free tap water all night. Kyle introduces me to a girl friend of his I’ve never met, she’s cool, goth and her eyes pierce deep into my soul as she pulls me onto the dance floor, leaving my doll in Kyle’s lap as he tells me that he has to go take a piss and I answer: “well, bring the doll and just don’t take a piss on it then, Kyle,” and he smirks.

The night is gone like that. Any frustration, any concern evaporates into the thin oozing smoke penetrated by colorful laser beams, a hard pounding in my chest, a gleeful smile in front of me and my matching rhythmic dance moves to those of a new friend.

And then the screams. The kind that doesn’t belong here: guttural, panicked, *“someone just fucking died”* kind of screams.

Reality hits me like a bowl of ice water, groups of people push to the exit, I have no idea wherefrom the panic arose but I know I have to follow people outside. I’m pushing past them aggressively; Kyle’s friend is gone. I throw my elbows to rush faster and make space, I check my phone, it is midnight, it is *midnight*, where did I leave Kyle?

Where did Kyle go? People exit in different directions, but I know where to go because Kyle’s dad should have been here now, so I go to where we had arranged for him to pick us up. To the side of the club, a small parking area lit by flickering streetlights, people are running away from there, leaving a body behind on the asphalt with a man kneeling screaming his name: “Kyle, no, no, no, my son,” *no, no, no.* I run to them unaware of any danger or sensation other than that my heart is in my throat, electricity shoots bolts through my body. He’s dead. He has no face. It’s replaced by mossy red matter. They’re soaked in a pool of blood; his dad doesn’t even notice me.

“I am so, so sorry,” I say as if it’s my fault that Kyle is the one who is dead. Bob still doesn’t hear me, other people come and try to pull him away from the body, and sirens ring discordantly. I go to the shadowed wall of the nightclub, throw up water and turn around to see once again, just far enough out there in the distance, my doll lays with its face turned towards me, hollow in its expression. Almost menacingly.

I wish I could say my story ends there. Alongside Kyle’s. But it doesn’t.

Three hooded men wearing masks were spotted running away from the crime scene after having beaten and kicked my best, and only, friend to death outside his workplace. No one got caught. No one got punished.

It has been six years.

I used to scuff at movies featuring creepy killer dolls because it always felt like mine saved me, but now I believe it. This doll of mine was there with him, stained with a single drop of blood on its cheek, a testimony to what it witnessed. It was my fault, it said, and then I slowly walked past the small crowd taking care of the body and the body’s father and I picked it up from the ground and thought, this is my fault, I am going to take that home with me, all the blame. I see it now: This is my fault.

On the sixth anniversary of his death, I make a quick call to my parents and siblings to let them know that I care for them and appreciate them, for having respectfully supported me and letting me live with them up until I got my own apartment (which is a month ago). I quit my low-pay job, and I turn on the gas oven and open it, ready to put my head inside of it.

I have thought about it a lot so that I don’t mess it up. There is something so poetic about dying like Sylvia Plath, a woman whose soul was haunted despite the love she also received during her life. I am reminded then in that moment, of the backstreet cat that has peered through the window since the first night I moved in, which I reluctantly opened the window for and let into my apartment for a cup of almond milk. If I am to end what I have here to get a sense of peace, to bury the endless black noise that has occupied my brain since Kyle’s death, I am not taking an innocent cat with me.

So, I go into the living room, blow out a candle and close the window to the streets where a strong wind is whooshing. As I do it, I hear the sound of the door to the kitchen slamming behind me, the air cracks and I hear a low rumbling as something erupts behind me, tree and glass splints and a wave of heat hits my back. I am knocked over; my head hits the ground with a loud thump.

I wake up in the hospital to my dad sitting next to me. He is eating shawarma (probably from his place downtown), which makes the whole room smell strongly of homely spices. I feel nauseous but mostly because I realize my demise; that my demise was not the one I had hoped for. How does one go about explaining what I had tried to do, excuse it? There is no way to do that. Instead, I stare at the doll placed on the cupboard in front of me, parts of its face are burned but the body is very much intact and the same. “Oh,” my dad says as he notices the subject of my attention, “they did not manage to save much from the fire but that. It’s so ugly, they should’ve left it.” It is an ugly doll, for sure. That thing *is* haunted. Maybe it never saved me, maybe it has been there at every bad moment of my life because it was the reason for them, it is the *cause* of bad things happening around it.

I want to get rid of it, and I know I can’t. If it could die, I know it would’ve died in that fire.

You would think things could only go downhill from here: at the hospital after a failed suicide attempt with basically no income, no place to live, having to move back to my parents, having to experience my family silently judging me at the peak of the aftershock? Yeah, I don’t think so. I am spending the next few months facing my new realities, such as that due to the fire, most of my back is scarred including the backside of my head, where my long beautiful hair will never be able to grow back. Some of my chin is scarred, my neck is scarred, and a lot of my arms and legs. I look like someone’s nightmare, and I don’t know how any wig or makeup could ever save this.

I get rejected at every job interview, getting embarrassed and spooked looks from the interviewers and the people in the streets. Even after having spent hours in front of the mirror trying to piece my skin and body back together into something recognizably human. *The doll turned out better than you,* I think.

I guess that is when I decide to make a change, and instead of reversing my life into societal norms, I am going to completely destroy any sign of them. I am tired of this body and this mind, there are only a few things I have been definitively good at anyway, and if I stay, I want to fulfil the revenge I sought out in the first place.

My only, and depressing, regret, is that I got the wrong person killed. Technically, the beating was only supposed to land Bob, Kyle’s dad, in the hospital. I was too much of a coward to ask the small group of white druggies from the edge of our suburb to finish the deed after I paid cash—naturally, I had saved up and withdrawn money from the bank ever since I started working my first job at 16. I just guess they took it too far and got scared when they realized they jumped the wrong family member; Bob and Kyle do look somewhat alike, as fathers and sons typically do. I haven’t heard or seen them since, and I don’t care to because I don’t blame them. It is me who was responsible for looking out for Kyle, me, who hired them knowing their history and not at all caring if it would’ve turned out the same for Bob, splashed out on the street for all to see.

Maybe I sound insane but that is what he made me feel: Wrong and worthy of destruction for the reason of existing. For years, I would escape my parents’ fights by going to Kyle’s and finding comfort in how much more average-looking, “ideal” his home life appeared. We played games on his PlayStation, Kyle even got me to play ball games with him, and we chatted about life and everything cool and not-cool, deep and not-that-deep.

Kyle’s parents were happily divorced, and since his mom was a career-lady, Kyle naturally favored staying with his dad. I never saw Bob around much because he, too, would work pretty late, but when I came over at night because of my parents, things started to change. He would never leave me and Kyle alone, out of sight, except to bring us ice cream from the fridge and soda. He seemed like a perfect dad, probably too perfect, and then one day, it was like he flipped the switch. His face grew more serious as he asked first Kyle, and then me, to undress.

Kyle’s face blushed with redness, I couldn’t stand looking at him, he tried to ask his father if they could do it later, alone, privately. I both understood what was about to go down and had no clue what it meant. He didn’t seem to force Kyle to do anything, Kyle appeared as if he went along with it, while I stood there frozen. “You too,” Bob would say, sneeringly. Petrified I removed my clothes like he told me to, and I felt myself distancing from my body which was wrapped in cold air and goosebumps.

Sometimes he did both Kyle and I, sometimes he did only me and made Kyle watch. I still couldn’t stand looking at Kyle, so there I stretched my neck, looking out of the window into the neighbor house’s attic across the street, at the doll that I now own.

I don’t know why I ever went back; if it was for Kyle’s friendship; if it was the desperate belief that everything else about his home life was perfect and better than mine; if it was because I felt that, even though what Bob did to my body hurt and left me feeling dirty and shameful, I still somehow felt that it was so much better than the lack of control in my own house. Somehow the act of going back felt like I did have a sense of control, and that it was rewarded in the end with Kyle’s lifelong friendship.

Now Kyle is dead because of me. I had arranged that night out where we would need to get picked up, made sure that it was Bob who would come to get us, and showed the gang members who to go for, while I would be dancing the night away with Kyle. Obviously, I knew it would hurt him emotionally, but I trusted my gut that it was for the better because Kyle still lived at home and I still saw the way he acted around his dad, timid and uncomfortable when he got up close to him. I knew that it was right.

But I messed up everything, and I have to do it over. I have found another strategy. Bob wasn’t only interested in kids; he was also interested in hookers. Here I find myself unable to get past a job interview for a normal job, and I must go rogue. I tell my family that I am safe but I am going to be away for a while, and they try to hold me back but they can’t refuse because I am my own adult.

It is depressingly easy to get into prostitution today: One contact becomes your ad and suddenly, you’re sold like a cheap car on Craigslist. So much for self-empowerment and feminism. I don’t have any clothes I consider slutty but I find out that it doesn’t matter, they’ll treat you the same—and all the sexual trauma awakens, rushes down my spine and keeps my body stiffened like I am in electrotherapy, breathing through my teeth. The greedy sensations, the foul smells, the taste stuck in the back of my throat that I will be washing away with soap in the bathroom later. And the best part, I can’t stop. This is what I was made for, and it all crescendos the day Bob becomes my client, and takes me home.

“It’s been a while,” he says. I tell him to shut up, my voice is grown-up. “What?” he says anyway, and I tell him that I don’t want him to make me remember. “Alright,” he answers. Over the next many years, I willingly see Bob. Bob becomes my client, and I become his. Sometimes he makes me dress up as Kyle in his old clothes, all of which I know by heart, and sometimes he tears up and asks me to just sit with him and hold his hand. I don’t know which makes me feel more ill.

When I fuck with Bob, I make sure to make him feel loved and seen and heard. I do everything that he wants me to. It is like I am his doll. This is a punishment for both of us, I think, fittingly. My life has turned into our life. We are one side of the same coin, the victim and the perpetrator. He buys me things and asks me out, too. We lay in bed after fucking, and I let him cook breakfast for me in the morning.

By the time Bob is in his late 60s, we are in a loving relationship, and I no longer have ties with my family. And by loving, I mean: “I hate every single inch of your skin, but I will tolerate you until it’s time.” Because one day, he will die by my hands, too.

He frequently talks about marrying me. A discreet marriage, of course—not because I am the childhood friend of his dead son and much younger, but because I am a trans girl. His colleagues, of course, can’t know. I don’t reject him but I appear reluctant, I don’t want him to know that I want the marriage to happen, too.

So, by the time we are officially, and discreetly, married, I am ready to finalize our time together.

Serving by serving, I put a little bit of rat poison in his drinks. He falls ill, pale as a white sheet and wet with heavy beads of sweat. His lips are bluish, he throws up a lot. I keep it going, serve him just enough to keep him ill for extended periods and drag it out, but make sure there are periods when his health is better and he can return to work to avoid suspicion.

It is a slow process but this is what I have waited for. I realize that I do not find joy in seeing him die slowly but there is something else that makes it worth it. Like the tense pause between the end of a performance and a standing ovation. He coughs, gets slimy, he is the most disgusting he has ever been, and I have seen the worst of him. He wants sex, and I pretend to pity him when I say no, I simply cannot.

I know the torture has to end when he is bedridden for several weeks, the workplace keeps calling and he is coughing up blood. I have to give him a proper doze and end the misery, despite how every nerve in my body tells me to extend and keep pushing, keep seeing how far I can make him go. I know that it has to end.

The fat doll, which I have placed on a bookcase next to his bed, stares at us as I sit next to him and give him his final doze of arsenic. “I am scared,” he says, “don’t you think you should call the doctor?” I open his hand and run my finger in circles on his rough palm. “No. I don’t think I will.”

With caution, I proceed to remind him that a real man owns his illness and doesn’t succumb to it. A man’s illness is his, and only his problem, and if he makes it anybody else’s, well, then he is no better than said illness. Bob’s teary eyes look at me for help. “I want you to know before you pass, that it was me. All those years ago. With Kyle. I arranged for someone to get hurt that night.”

He blinks, and his gaze flickers around as if he is tracking a fly darting the room. “What do you mean *“with Kyle”*?” His old voice is so much more fragile like a whimper than I expected. He almost sounds innocent.

“I mean that I killed your son,” I say, and he reluctantly laughs in an uncomfortable smile. “It was supposed to be you for raping me and for raping Kyle. For everything you did to us, you disgusting pig.”

I can feel my voice and hand tremble as I recollect my memory. All of what has been boiled up, unsaid. No words have enough color or edge to give life to that. Yet I want him to believe what I say, and it appears he is fumbling, beginning to see a picture he never even considered.

“Remember how eager I was for you to come and pick us up at the nightclub? How I had it planned for months—and those three men who got away? I paid them for years worth of work salary, oh yeah, I messed up with that. It wasn’t supposed to be Kyle.” I suddenly find myself choking up before realizing my cheeks are already wet with tears. “He was my friend. I didn’t even want anybody dead. I just wanted you to hurt,” I cried, gasping, “I needed you to feel so, so hurt. Please, why did you do it?” I ask.

Through my blurred vision, I see his face distorted, too, in a sad frown with ugly tears and snot running down his face. It feels like I am looking at the real Bob, caught in shame and self-pity, and I can’t tell if he is crying for me, for himself or for both of us.

I stop myself from squeezing his hand and let go. He eyes the empty cup of arsenic at his bedside. “How long?” he asks.

No, I think. This is not about you, Bob. But he thinks so.

In the exhausted breath of a loser, I sigh and stand up. I no longer look at him. I’m staring at my doll.

Bob is not healthy enough to get up himself and call for help, call for anything. He may live for another hour, maybe for another day. Nobody stops by for him anymore.

As I leave Bob to die alone in excruciating pain, I am comfortable knowing that I will be somewhere else and that when his neck tightens, and he angles his head to scan the room for help, he will find himself in just the right position to lock eyes with the “faceless” doll I leave behind.
