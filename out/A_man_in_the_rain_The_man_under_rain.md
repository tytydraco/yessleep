*It was a simple town, darkened by night, shrouded by fog and rain. He stood there, quite ominously if I do say so.*

It started like any day. I walk outside, try to dodge the rain, and attempt to speak to the locals. Believe it or not, English is hard to learn when your school decides to send you to a secluded British village while you've spoken in French for all of your life. It may seem like torture, but I learned the basics quite fast, and as you can see from this post, I learned the rest of this dialect fairly quickly too. I hated the weather there. I heard it was always grey in the United Kingdoms, but it was Spring, and it was raining at almost every waking hour. Maybe if it was sunnier sometimes, I could've never seen what happened then? I made friends there, not sure how. Maybe they knew some French, and I knew some English, and that was enough? I don't really have much memories of that time, it was years ago, after all. All I truly can remember is what happened that specific night.

*I approached him. I'd say I was hypnotized, but in truth, I wasn't. I simply was curious*

When the evening came, I tried like all days to seek the sunset. I'm not sure what I expected. Even if there was no rain, due to all the clouds, I'd just see slightly orange grey or slightly pink grey. Maybe that could've been enough to rid me from the monotony of the skies? I guess we'll never know. Back to the story, I walked outside, and I managed to find some local. We spoke-by that I mean, they spoke, and I nodded along- until we found someone else. They were fully dark, but at the time, I just assumed they were wearing a fully black outfit. Thinking back, that did make sense. And there were higher chances that was the case than what happened.

*He turned to me. He seemed joyous, if not ecstatic. Maybe he simply was happy he found someone else, but I'd learn later.*

My newly found friend approached the person, seemingly lacking any kind of survival instinct at all. I stopped them, trying to reason them, because I thought they were an addict or maybe a drunk guy. And yet again, that explanation WOULD have made more sense. Obviously, what they heard was probably utter nonsense blended with poor sign language and interspersed with uhh's and french words with an English accent. In the end, I grabbed their arm, using the universal language of actions, to not have my new acquaintance be in possibly lethal danger.

*He didn't speak. He didn't need to. I think we made a deal. It wasn't clear enough for me to remember, but I do know clearly what happened afterwards*

My friend grabbed my arm and pushed it back aggressively. Almost too aggressively. I couldn't possibly make them change their mind, and I had the proof I also couldn't physically stop them from going there. They walked up to them, greeted them with an exaggerated smile, and I deduce started introducing themselves and asking questions about the other. They seemed oh so happy to find the person, standing in the rain. It felt like they were both childhood friends, reunited. Except the man standing under the rain never spoke back.

*He dissapeared, in the rain. I felt myself grow larger and larger, until I was everywhere. I was spread throughout wherever there was a possibility of passing on the curse*

The first thing I noticed was the sound. A terrible, horrible "plic", followed by a "ploc". A morbid rhythm that continued, louder than the rain, impossibly louder than anything else. It echoed through my ears each time, and just as it would go away, another one would fall onto the floor, echoing again. Then, I saw it. The blood, prickling from every orifice, every pore, which made the loud prickling even more frantic. Finally, they spoke. I am still sorry I, the one person in this village would barely spoke a lick of English, heard it. All I know about it, is that it was calm. Almost accepting. It even seemed... Regretful, that the Man had to kill them.

*I felt my sanity decrease, as I ended up being but a shadow in the rain. I didn't see anything. I didn't hear anything. I didn't say anything. Maybe I couldn't. Or maybe I decided to hide my humanity*

The Man looked at me. Or, at least, turned to face me. I could barely see it, yet I noticed every detail. It had one hand covering the both of its eyes, one covering its mouth, and one for each ears. As if it didn't want to see, hear nor speak to its victims. As if it was regretful. But that was a demon. It didn't have regret. That I knew for sure. Or perhaps I thought for sure? Suddenly I doubted everything I knew. If such a thing that can mutilate my late acquaintance exists, does anything I know even weight anything in this impossibly unknown world?

*The world could've ended, I'd still go on, trying to find an appropriate vessel. Everytime, they would die, and their blood would be sprayed over me until I dissolved to somewhere else*

Just beyond sight, at the edge of vision, I almost could notice a sympathetic look from the Man. Obviously that was false. A monster couldn't feel sympathy. Especially not after having killed an innocent... I did not understand why I was so mad. I still do not. The man had killed someone I didn't know, I never even understood them. But still. He killed someone. Could I really not be mad? It seemed more like I was mad because of moral obligation, instead of personal thoughts.

*Hopefully, one day, I can find a fitting vessel*

Though I saw this almost incomprehensible creature, this demon, I did not feel in the slightest bit of danger. This monster felt more relatable than anything. Almost as if we did know each other. But no, this feeling was more as if we would end up knowing each other, no matter what happened. Almost as if we were the same person.

*Hopefully, one day, this carnage can finally stop*

Through all of this, I can do nothing but hope. Hope that the Man in the Rain can not find me. Because as he diffused in the rain, I deduced one thing. He can only aim once. And perhaps we will meet again, and this time, he'll aim for me.

*Hopefully, one day, I finally will end up dying.*
