Some background on the circumstances:

I called in sick to work today. I had a bad headache last night that bled over into this morning. 

To be honest, I was fine a couple of hours after I called in and could've gone, but I decided to stay home to sleep, read, make art and get stoned instead. Sue me.

Anyway, that part is irrelevant.

Let's bring us to about 3 hours ago, when I got the munchies and went into the kitchen for a snack.

My house is big and old, and sits on top of a small hill on the corner of two streets. I was snacking and watching any passing traffic out the window, also while observing the strange lack of snow for this time of year.

I was jolted out of my hazy stupor when I thought I saw my boss's Corvette wiz by (at too fast a speed, might I add). The car had been going too quickly to really tell, and there are a lot of rich assholes around here with cars like that. So I brushed it off.

A few moments later, I saw what looked like my manager Sarah's car drive by and turn onto the side street. 

Now, in a place where everyone lived near each other, or took similar traffic routes, I suppose this wouldn't be strange.

But I am the only person that works there and also lives where I do. I'm about 20 minutes out from my job, and live in the middle of podunk nowhere; the armpit of my county. Across the street from my house is literally a river. 

I stood by the window, mouth open in mid-crunch, and thought "Wow. I guess I smoked too much."

Needless to say, all of that freaked me out quite a bit, so I retreated back into my bedroom to read and nap.

I woke again just an hour ago, and went downstairs to my kitchen for more snacks after another smoke sesh.

I was standing there by the window again, eating some chips for a little while before noticing a car drive past that looked like my co-worker Jeremy's new Ford Escape. I had seen it up close, so I was fairly certain. I thought I even made out the decal I know he has on the passenger side door. 

I started to freak out and seriously reconsider some of my life choices when the car drove by again, coming from the opposite direction. 

My vision isn't the best, and the road is about 18 meters from the window, so I could've been mistaken... But I could SWEAR that I saw the driver turn their head completely sideways to stare at me as they drove past.

Their skin was definitely a dark complexion like Jeremy's... And it looked like he was smiling with wide eyes as he stared in. 

I'm super freaked out and don't know what to do. Does anyone out there have any advice?

Am I going crazy? Please help! I don't know what to do.
