How many nights have I had this dream?

I stopped counting.

It always starts the same.

I’m lying in bed.  
Room dark.  
Air cold on the right side of my neck…  
warm on the left.

A contradiction I can never explain.

Then something sits on my chest.

Not a figure.  
Not a shadow.

Just weight — slow and deliberate — pressing down like the darkness is learning how to breathe.

I try to inhale.

My ribs twitch.  
My throat tightens.

Then it whispers my name.

Right into my ear.

The breath is warm…

yet the air against my cheek stays freezing.

That mismatch scares me more than the whisper itself.

The physics stop making sense.

I wake up gasping.  
Heart racing.  
Hands shaking.

I used to tell myself it was sleep paralysis.  
Nightmares.  
Stress.

But nightmares don’t follow you during the day.

The whisper does.

My family always said I was special.  
Marked.  
Followed by bad luck.

“Bad luck sticks to you,” they’d say.  
“Like a second spine.”

I thought they were joking.

Until the sheep.

I used to count them to fall asleep:

“One sheep…”  
“Two sheep…”

And then—

“Three sheep.”

Except I didn’t say it.

The voice came from the other side of the pillow.

Too close.  
Too gentle.  
Too real.

I turned my head slowly…

Nothing there.

But the whisper kept going.

“Four sheep…”

Barely audible.  
Shaped like a smile.

“Five sheep…”

Warm breath brushing the cold air.

“Six sheep…”

The blanket tightening slightly — like something else moved under it.

I hid under the blanket after that.  
Instinct.  
Desperation.  
Some childish reflex wired into me.

What — the monster wouldn’t see me if I covered my head?

The blanket didn’t stop the whisper.  
Didn’t stop the breath.  
Didn’t stop the fingers.

Cold.  
Thin.

Tracing the line of my ankle as if checking whether I was real.

They tugged once — just enough to drag me down the bed a little — before I jolted awake.

And before my eyes opened, I heard it exhale:

“Soon.”

I tried to fight it.

Earplugs — still heard it.  
Lights on — still felt it.  
Sleeping in different rooms — still sensed it.  
Different cities — still followed me.

When I was sixteen, I recorded myself sleeping.

The footage showed nothing.

But the audio…

Someone was whispering.

Right beside the mic.

I showed my friends.

They didn’t laugh.  
They didn’t tease me.  
They just stared.

“Why are you recording yourself?”  
“That’s just you snoring.”

But the file had no snoring.

Not even breathing.

So what were they hearing?

Why did they look at me like I needed help?

After eighteen, I stopped telling people.  
Stopped asking.  
Stopped trying.

People don’t react well when you describe things only you can hear — or things they refuse to hear.

But telling my family was worse.

They were atheists.  
Skeptics.  
The kind of people who mocked ghost stories for fun.

When I told them, they froze.

Their smiles dropped.  
Their bodies went stiff.  
The room went dead silent.

Then one of them whispered:

“…djinn.”

I asked what it meant.

Nobody explained.

They just turned away — slowly, carefully — like they didn’t want to upset something standing behind me.

But the truth is, the whisper didn’t start in my bedroom.

It started outside.

I remember being six or seven, playing football alone in my garden.  
Kicking the ball against the fence.  
Repeating the same shot again and again.

The sun went down.  
The sky dimmed.

And from under the big tree in the corner of the garden…

I’d hear my name.

Soft.

Too soft.

“Buck…”

I’d turn.  
Nothing.  
No one.

Just the tree.  
Just the wind.

But the wind doesn’t pronounce syllables.  
And it doesn’t exhale.

Even now — at twenty-six — I sometimes hear a half-formed breath behind me.

Like it’s trying to learn this world’s language.

And the strangest part?

It never touches me when I’m angry.  
Or loud.  
Or moving.

It waits.

It waits for silence.

And that’s why—

I scream.  
I shout.  
I make noise.  
I slam drawers, stomp around, hum songs, anything.

Because if there’s silence…  
if the room goes quiet…

I’m afraid.

What if it comes closer?

People around me act normal.  
Laughing.  
Sleeping.  
Working.  
Holding conversations like nothing is standing an inch behind me, gently breathing a second after I exhale.

Sometimes I stare at them and think:

Why do they act so normal?

As if the cold patch isn’t real.  
As if the whisper isn’t balanced on the edge of my thoughts.

Am I crazy?

Then something warm exhales down my spine.

Delayed.  
Precise.  
Waiting.

Silence used to be peaceful.

Now silence feels like permission.

My family had a word for it.

A Qarin.  
A shadow.  
A mirror.  
A breath that isn’t yours.

I don’t know if I believe in any of that.

But something is with me.  
Something always has been.

And every night…

every quiet moment…

every time I close my eyes…

I exhale.

And then—

something else exhales after me.

Not my breath.

Its own.

If it’s all in my head…

why does it have its own breath?
