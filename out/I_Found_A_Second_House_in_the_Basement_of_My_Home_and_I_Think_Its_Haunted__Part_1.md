My parents made me move to a small town in the middle of nowhere when I was younger. Yes, there was a college where they worked but what was that for me, a 17 year old finishing up high school a complete loner.

All that meant was I spent most of my time laying around the cold old Victoria house they rented. I at least found entertainment in studying the walls of the house, finding little carvings and scribbles, clearly left by other children who had been bored in the house in the 100 plus years it had stood erect.

I saw behind the dryer, a series of arrows carved into the wooden floor which led away from the appliance. I traced them to the back corner of the room, a little space populated by an air vent. Through the dust and cobwebs I could see carvings inside the vent. 

I wedged myself between the dryer and the wall to get a closer look. I was just starting to make out the scratchings when I felt the floor give out from under me. 

I’m not exactly how far I fell. All I knew was I hit the ground hard and kicked up a serious plume of dust. 

I found myself sitting on the ground in a basement space, empty, for other than a small wooden house which took up most of the space. Completely in-tact, there was no denying the thing was a full on building - front door, porch, windows, triangle roof. 

Something called me to the house. 

No surprise the inside of the house was stark. There was an intense smell of dust which instantly made me sneeze. I let it out and heard something shuffle somewhere else in the house. I followed the sound towards the back.

I only made a few steps when I felt something hard and unsteady beneath my foot. A toy car, made of wood, its wheels tripped me up as I momentarily skidded on the wood floor, almost falling down. 

That was enough to get me to race out of that little house in the basement. I didn’t need to waste anymore time in there. In the basement either. I got back to where I fell through and found enough loose and empty brick space in the wall to climb back up and out of the basement. 

I was extremely not thrilled at this point my parents had left town, and me, home alone for a few weeks. What I thought was going to be an ideal vacation away from responsibility had become a horror movie. 

I had no idea what to do from there other than convince myself that yes, there was a complete, intact house in the basement of the house I lived in, but that was it. *It didn’t have to be sinister, right?*

The feeling that it didn’t have to be sinister circulated enough in my head that I was able to sleep. With my dresser drawer pressed up against the back of my bedroom door of course, sealing me in. 

That was great until the middle of the night. *Something was moving around my room.* 

I couldn’t see it. Only hear it, milling about on the other side of the room. I flicked on a light next to my bed. I didn’t catch whatever it was in time. 

There was nothing on the other side of the room, but I saw my dresser had been moved away from my bedroom door, and it was now wide open. 

I wanted to get up and see what was going on, but I couldn’t, I was still too tired. I drifted back to sleep. 

I don’t know if I would call it a dream. It didn’t feel like one. It felt like a flash of a vision. I saw a girl, about my age, long flowing dark hair, bathed in sunlight coming through a window, standing in a clean room, looking at me. She smiled and waved. 

I moved in her direction one step before I woke up. 

The house was freezing when I woke up. I felt scared, but also alone. I couldn’t feel a presence or anything else in the house. I’d be lying if I didn’t say that all I could think about was that house in the basement. 

I wanted to investigate it more though. Something was calling me down there. I could feel a warm breeze coming out of it - it was possible the hole had messed with the heating system and that was the deal. 

Either way, I dropped down into the hole and carefully let myself down into the basement.

The house was there just as it had been the day before. This time I walked right into it, stepping through the front door. 

I was greeted by an empty room. Large, wood floors, windows darkened. There didn’t appear to be a drop of life in it. 

The room changed as I got in deeper. It got darker. A thick rain started to fall from the ceiling. 

Cutting through the rain was the outline of a figure on the other side of the room - just standing there, still, staring at me. 

It appeared to be a boy. Somewhere in the teenage years. Short, but strong. Shaggy hair. 

I felt a searing pain hit my shoulder. I looked and saw a blackened and burned hand gripping my shoulder tight, sharp nails digging into my skin. 

I spun away and ran for the door. I felt myself get pulled backward. I felt that painful hand grip back onto my back. 

*What had I been thinking? Go back down into the basement with the eerie and mysterious house resting in it? Regret. Regret. Regret.* 

I was frozen in my thoughts and I felt like the figure was taking advantage, gripping me tighter and pulling me further into the house. 

Then I was pulled backward, towards the door which led me in. Just a bit, enough to loosen me.

I didn’t waste the opening - I ran right out of the house in the basement. 

Once upstairs, I made a promise to myself to never go down there again. I had explored enough. 

I paced the house for what seemed like hours, trying to decide on my next move. I didn’t decide on one. I eventually got distracted by something. 

Everytime I stepped on the hardwood floor I heard my feet pitter patter with noise, then I heard two steps behind me. I would then whip around, but no one would be there. 

I could feel someone or something there. It was like it was following me. I just couldn’t see it. 

I thought of a trick. I walked and heard the footsteps following me in unison again. 

I reached a lightswitch and flicked it off quickly. I immediately saw it standing there next to me in the dark. 

It was human shaped. Burning white. Its outline burned there in the darkness. It wasn’t the boy in the basement. It was light and soft while he was dark and stout. 

A head rush hit me suddenly. I felt myself get out of my body for a flash. 

I was in a hospital. The smell stung my nose and the chill of the drafty building rose the hair on my arms. 

I remembered the scene - I was in an MRI machine - sent there by a hard hit from football practice. The image lasted for only a few moments…

That image had happened. No idea why it flashed through my head while I was being stalked by a ghost. 

At least the ghost was gone now. I was alone in the house again. 

The thought of leaving went through my mind again. I stayed. Something compelled me to stay. I went about my life in the house. 

The house began to stir in the middle of the night. I woke to the sound of an insect buzzing in my ear. I swatted at it in the dark when I woke, missing it by a mile. 

I sat up in bed and saw my dresser, bolstered on that night by also sliding a couch up behind it, was still blocking the door. What was open, and had let the insect in was the window next to my bed. 

The insect buzzed by me again, right by my nose. It looked like a mosquito. 

A look around the room revealed the image of a girl - standing in the corner, looking at me. Teenage. Dressed in all white. I caught a quick glimpse of her, and then she was gone. 

Another blackout took over me, then replaced with an image, like a moving slideshow - I was looking at the hallway which connected the bedrooms of the home to the living room and the heart of the house - a trapdoor was opened from the ceiling - a set of stairs descended down to the floor - a great light radiated down out of the opening above. 

Crash. I was back in the room. The teen girl in white gone. The mosquito no longer buzzing around. The window closed. The light of morning rising somewhere outside off in the distance. 

It felt perfect to examine the ceiling trapdoor in the hallway I had seen in the vision. I had seen the handle before and had oddly never thought of investigating. 

I pulled the trapdoor and was shocked by the giant amount of light which poured down. It blinded me for a second. 

The blinding flash of light took me back to another moment my brain seemed to have forgotten. I was standing in my bedroom at our previous house. The sound of my mom crying had rousted me from my video game. I crept to the door and cracked it open. 

Through the crack in the door, I could see into the living room and see my mom on the couch, wiping tears out of her eyes and sobbing. My dad consoled her. 

*Had that moment actually happened though?* I wasn’t sure. It’s possible my brain had just created a memory at that moment. 

I was back in the hallway looking up at the trap door and the stairs which descended down from it. 

I started up the stairs when I felt something cold grab my ankle. I tried to get back up the stairs but watched in horror as they tucked themselves back up into the ceiling on its own. Like they were a living, breathing entity. 

Another blackout flash washed over me. I saw the image of that beautiful, young blonde woman, sitting in a pristine room, just drenched in gorgeous sunlight. 

She looked frustrated now, or disappointed? 

Then the flash was gone and I was in the hallway again. Almost completely dark. 

The teen boy was there. At the other end of the hallway. We had about 10 feet between us. I at first thought he wasn’t going to charge at me. It looked away from me, as if it had no interest in me.

Then I watched the figure come more into focus - his body strobed - going in and out - choppy and grainy. He got more clear as he moved toward me. 

My feet were glued to the floor. I wanted to run but it was like he had me stuck in a trap. 

He was almost to me. I could smell an awful stench sting my nose. I closed my eyes tight. 

I felt safe. I felt warm. I felt rested. I couldn’t open my eyes. It didn’t matter. I felt perfect. 

A woman’s voice came into my ear - soft and sweet. It cut through the trauma like sugar poured into unsweetened lemonade. 

“You’re okay,” the female voice whispered into my ear. “You can open your eyes.”

I was back in my bedroom. There was no woman there. Just me, alone. 

My alarm went off on my phone. It was early morning. I had at least made it through another night. 

I felt like death. My head ached in a way it never had before. It felt like someone was making a hole into it with a power drill. 

I couldn’t get out of bed. I laid right back down and went to sleep. 

I went into a dream. I was at a doctor’s office in a situation I definitely had not been in. 

My parents sat across the desk from a doctor, looking at x-rays and paperwork. Everyone was serious. There was no talking, just reviewing the documents with dread all over their faces. 

I could see someone else, standing in the room, behind my parents - tall, young, blonde woman, haunting. She was the one I kept seeing in my visions. 

I felt the end of the vision/dream coming like a rush. It was like playing in the shallows of the ocean when it sucks a wave back and then it comes back. 

I was staring at the wave, waiting for it to come. I looked deep into the eyes of the blonde girl. I felt her communicate something to me just before the wave crashed and everything went black. 

No words went into my head. No revelations. No instructions. Just a feeling. I was in deep trouble and whoever this blonde girl was, she was concerned for me…*and maybe she could help?*

The wave crashed onto the shore of my mind. I woke to the doorbell ringing. The house had a doorbell? I had never heard it before. Regardless, I got up, still in pain, but figured it was time to get out of bed. 

I tried. I couldn’t get out of bed. 

Worse yet, the teen boy was there, standing in the corner of my room. 

The fright in my heart was enough to get me to start moving, to plead with him. 

“Please, I don’t know what this is, but I’m just a 17-year-old fucking idiot, trying to deal with his migraines and his bullshit, and riding out summer break in this big weird house, in this weird, little, fucking town,” I lost control at the end, spitting out those final words, no idea how this monster would react to my hostility. 

He reacted by rushing onto my bed, pinning me down, and breathing down my throat, like he was trying to give me C.P.R. with the world’s most powerfully disgusting breath. 

The wrestling match took me away - back into another black out. I could see my parents again. They were on a pristine, tropical beach, drinks in-hand. I knew that, but they looked nervous. My mom chewed her nails off and gnashed them in her teeth. She hadn’t done that in quite a while. My dad was in paradise, but he was skimming through Twitter on his phone, my mom’s least-favorite habit. 

A wave crashed on the beach in front of them and swept up to their feet, soaking some of their belongings. 

But they didn’t even react. 

I felt the wave kept going higher and higher up the beach and they wouldn’t react. I felt myself get swept up in its power. I felt myself getting drug out to sea. It was warm. It was light. It was nice. I wanted to just let it take over me. 

Something told me not to. I pushed my hands out and tried to wrestle and swim against the tide. 

My hands eventually found something solid - a human neck. A clammy one. A cold one. 

The lights came back on in my head. The teen boy was on top of me still, but I had pushed him up and away. 

I dug deep as I could into my bones and sat up and pushed him off of me. She fell off the bed.

No time to waste, I ran right off the bed. I was going to run out the front door of the house and out into freedom. I didn’t care, I’d go anywhere but there.   


I was greeted by that ceiling trapdoor in the hallway. It called to me. I ran up the stairs as fast as I could and followed the light which beamed down from the hole above. 

I found myself in an attic space, made out into a bedroom. Lined with windows, it let in a glorious amount of natural light. It had a well-made bed and it was just everything pristine. 

I closed the trap door below me. That’s when she emerged from a closet in the attic room. 

It was the girl from the visions - tall, blonde, long hair, looking like some kind of Rapunsel who had been living in my attic all this time. 

I didn’t have to speak the words, I’m sure she could read them on my face. 

“You’re probably wondering what all of this is about,” she said softly, her voice I could recognize. 

Again, I didn’t have to answer. Apparently neither did she. She walked over to me and wordlessly led me to a mirror in a back corner of the room. 

She nodded to the mirror and my eyes followed her. I barely recognized the person standing next to her in the mirror. Yes, it was me, but it was barely me. Is that what I really looked like? 

“It’s you,” she said to me, telling me what I feared. 

I started to get frantic. I looked so skinny and frail that I could die and I tried to trace backward in my pained mind. Had I left breadcrumbs or someway to remember what I had been doin

g and how long I had been doing it? How long had I actually been home alone? When was the last time I ate food?

It made sense why I looked like such a wreck. I didn’t even know what was going on with my life. 

I looked at the woman. She, and that room, they were so damn perfect. She. She had to have the answer. 

*Who was she? Did it matter?* I needed help. That I could tell. I needed it fast. 

She took me away from the mirror. I would later realize she was holding my hand the entire time. 

She told me one thing before she disappeared

:

“Call your parents.”

I looked in the mirror and she was gone. 

I had to call my parents, but where was my phone? I couldn’t even remember. 

It was in the basement. That’s right. I remembered it falling out of my pocket the first time I went down there. I never retrieved it. 

*Could I just run out of the house and find somewhere else to call from - a neighbor? No*. It was miles to the next place, no guarantee anyone would be there, and I could feel inside my body I wouldn’t be able to make it. 

I prayed my phone would still be down there. 

I descended that rope with what little energy I had into the cold and the darkness of the basement.
