Three years ago, I visited my uncle from my mom's side in a small village in Davao Del Norte, Philippines. I stayed with them in a kind of small hut/house with just my uncle, aunt, and baby cousin. The village had a slum atmosphere, with no proper cement or gravel, just pure dirt. There was this massive banana tree on the outskirts that really stood out. Apart from the unusual color of its bark/trunk, which you'd see in a wilting or dying banana tree, it still stood tall and sturdy. It blended in with the other normal trees, making it surprising to realize it was a banana tree.

I thought of going near it at first, but then my uncle called out to me and told me to unpack my things quickly as we’d be eating with the neighbors. There’s this term they call “Boodle Fight,” which most laymen refer to as “Kamayan.” It’s an activity where everyone gathers and eats together with their bare hands, sharing the splayed-out food. They were apparently celebrating my visit to their village.

During this event, I asked my uncle why there was an unusually big and weirdly hued banana tree on the outskirts of the village. Everyone stopped moving for a second and looked at me, with concerned looks on their faces. My uncle assured me that it was nothing. There was this one guy tho, who blurted out, *“That’s the Nightstalker!”*—roughly translated from their native language. Everyone at the table gave the guy a stink eye. My aunt nagged him on, saying, *“There you go again with your stupid stories. Why don’t you get a job and get out of here!”* The guy followed up by saying, *“If it wasn’t for that tree, we’d have more children and people in the village!”* A friend of my aunt said, *“Alright, that’s enough. Let’s just go back and finish eating, okay?*” After that, the table was covered with awkward silence until my uncle and I finished eating,

After my uncle and I finished eating, we headed back first to avoid any more awkwardness. As we walked back to his place, I heard some mild shouting from where we were. I couldn’t understand what they were arguing about, but it seemed pretty heated. So, I just minded my own business and went back inside my uncle’s home without a peep. About an hour later, I asked my uncle about the Nightstalker. Apparently, the Nightstalker is the local folktale in that village. They say the huge banana tree uproots itself and moves when the moon isn’t visible, stalking people from adults to children who wander too long and far at night. Just recently, a young kid went missing, adding to the eerie tension that built up over the local folktale my uncle told me. He laughed it off and told me to head to bed before the Nightstalker gets me. I gave a simple nod and went to bed.

The next morning, everything went as usual in the village. I tried to enjoy my time there by going out around the area, but every time I walked towards the road to head to the local places, I always seemed to find myself looking at the banana tree before leaving the village. As days passed, I kept doing it again and again. I guess it never really left my mind after what my uncle told me. On the last day, on the last evening before I went back the next day, I decided to take a closer look at the tree. No one really paid attention to what was outside their homes at dusk, and I just chucked that up to probably one of their superstitions or something. As I got nearer, something strange caught my eye. Among the banana blossoms, one looked disturbingly different. It had a twisted, grimacing face, resembling that of a child in pain and horror. The sight made me feel uncomfortable. The village’s folktale filled my mind as fear and unease surged throughout my body. I mustered every ounce of courage and hurried back to my uncle’s place and stayed the night, not even thinking of leaving until I saw light outside the window. I avoided looking out the window for fear of what I might see. That night, I just took my blanket, covered myself with it, and lay on my bed, shutting my eyes forcibly until I fell asleep.

On the morning of my flight, I walked back to the main road with the intent of catching the earliest ride to go back home. I glanced where the banana tree would have been since all week I had noticed it being in the same spot. But as I looked for it, it wasn’t where it was supposed to be. I turned my head in the opposite direction, and there it was—the big [Banana Tree](https://imgur.com/a/LYuH0nS) where it wasn’t supposed to be. The hairs on my body stood up, and chills went down my spine, but I overcame it as the sun’s light gave me the courage I needed. I decided to take a picture of the [Banana Tree](https://imgur.com/a/LYuH0nS) but the one thing that haunted me the most was still there, so I got my phone and zoomed in stood still as I possibly can to get a clear picture, I'm not sure and I think it was just me but I saw the Banana Bloom squirming at one point but I didn't stuck around and decide to find out so I hurried to the main road and never looked back, fearing I might miss my flight. But I think I just made that an excuse to leave the place as fast as possible because as I was starting to believe the folktales at that time. To this day, I wonder if what I saw was even real. It all felt so vivid. It’s been years since I thought of that place, but I just remembered this memory because my dad told me we have to go back there and support my Uncle in his time of need because my cousin went missing a few days ago.
