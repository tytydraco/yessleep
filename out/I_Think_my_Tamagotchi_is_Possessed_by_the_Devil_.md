I am not sure how long I have or even if I will be able to post this. The lucid times come less and less frequently. I think my Tamagotchi has been possessed by the Devil and it is using me to do bad things.
 
I don’t even remember when this started, could have been a few days, weeks, or hell even years ago. I will start by what I remember though. I hope someone can give me some advice on how to get this to stop.

It all began when I was shopping around for some toys for my niece. I was at Toys R Us, browsing through a beautiful selection of dolls when I saw it dangling at the end of the row. All the nostalgic memories of the toy came flooding back and I had to have it.

I could not even fully exit the store before I unwrapped the package and began hatching the egg. I quickly began to become obsessed. I took the day of work just so I could make sure it was alive and happy all day.

It quickly grew and evolved with the affection I gave it. I am still not sure if this was a normal creature, but it became a dark cloud with piercing red eyes. It gave me such an unsettling feeling in the pit of my stomach, but he was my baby and I loved him.
 
This is were everything becomes hazy to me. The first instance of me noticing something was wrong was when my phone rang. Marg, my manager at work, spoke with a worried tone in her voice asking why they hadn’t heard from me in days. I was taken aback. I could have sworn it was a only a few hours since I got the toy, not days. I blacked out before I could process it any further.

The next time I remember is when I awoke to chanting coming from around me. Dark robed figures encircled me, candlelight absorbing into their pitch black garbs. The voices enchanting me, my mind barely registering my own naked body laying there with the Tamagotchi placed around my neck.
I remember the glint of the blade raised up into the stagnant air. The hairs on the back of my neck extending, warning me of potential threat. The searing burn in my stomach before my consciousness depleted once more.
 
A few times, I awoke for a fraction of a moment. A dark voice seemed to speak to my subconscious. I am not sure the words, but I know it spoke to me. Like a mother with her child’s voice, I know this.
 
Now, I have been lucid for an hour. My body covered in blood that is not mine. I am in a place I do not know. I found what the hooded figures cut into my stomach. It’s the strangest pentagram I have ever seen. This is how I know it must be the devil that had inhabited my toy.

I have found my phone nearby, and I am trying to ask for help. I thought about calling the police but I know they will not care. No one is going to believe me, I know I sound crazy.
 
If anyone has any useful information, next time I am free from my internal sleeps I will read them. I need help, I don’t think I will have any will power left much longer. Help, not for just my safety but yours.
