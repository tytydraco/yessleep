SOCIAL HELL

Leonard was enjoying shooting the breeze with his mate, Realph. And on this particular day, Leonard felt happy and comfey, out of the thunder and pouring rain, sheltered in Realph's workspace. Realph had been his workmate and dear friend, for a long time. Realph had even got Leonard a job, as an orderly, at the hospital he worked for. 

Realph was a big man with a beard, at this point in time, he was wearing overalls. They looked a bit more like waders, actually. Or some kind of hazmat suit. Leonard was looking at Realph's chest. It was showing a greese-like spatter. Not to worry, though; it would easily wipe off.

Leonard, doing nothing to help Realf with his project, "whatever that is," Leonard thought, not really caring. At this point in time, Leonard was off on a tangent. He was regurgitating fragments of politics, he had heard on tv, in the last couple of days. Being opinionated about things he didn't quite understand.

The sound of an angle grinder overtook Leonard's pointless nonsense. Realph may have done this on purpose, he thought. After the loud scream of the angle grinder came a few different kinds of squishy, squeltching noises. 

Something, all of a sudden wasn't feeling quite right. Leonard could feel it in his head, and deep, within his stomache. "Why is this starting to feel a bit sinister?" Leonard twigged as he heard a crunch. 

This was the moment that terrified a very recently aloof Leonard. This was the point in time where Leonard realised that he was not in Realph's shed, at all...

Bright, flurescent lights hurt his eyes, as the light poured into his retnas. His head throbbed like a beating heart. He ran to the nearest bin and vomited four times; For, he had finally came to. Awake, from the maddness and straight into a horrifying scene. For the first time in hours, Leonard, properly understood the very real nature of what was happening.

Realph and Leonard were three floors below ground level, at the hospital. Alone, and Realph was performing an autopsey. Post mortum butchery on a woman's dead body. And not just any woman, Keren. Dear sweet, organised, motherly Keren.

Leonard touched her pretty face. He got blood on his fingers. He screamed, but no one heard it from the morgue, aside from Realph, who didn't care. He screams again. This time, Realph joined him... Just for fun. His was more like a playful, yet crazed howl. Leonard began to experience flashbacks. There was a party the night before. Keren, Realph and... those fucking bath salts... Leonard tried to warn them, before giving into peer pressure.

It was realph, who was oblivious now. Hacking and sawing and poking about and draining stuff... Keren's body had no tag. Nor was it normal work hours for Realph. Leonard had to make his move...

He turned around and bolted for the lift. Realph, walking behind him. Still holding a bloody saw. Every step reverberating in Leonard's brain, like a panicked heartbeat. He pressed the button five times in a second, before turning and heading for the fire stairs; to no avail. THUMP!

Waking up cold is unpleasant. Cold, and in the pitch black, darkness. Leonard screamed, which only wasted his limited oxygen. Leonard was in a confined space and Realph had climbed on top of Keren and went to sleep.

The next day, detectives swarmed the morgue. It took, slightly, longer for them to discover Leonard's frozen body and recognise it as part of the crime scene. A small saddy bag, with the remainders of the previous night's festivities were discovered on the floor.

...instead of bagging it, a police officer pocketed it. Not that he needed any more, he had enough to fuel a lot more madness. His next targets were on his radar. "This is gonna be good," he said, to himself.

THE END.
