I saved the world.

Yes. That's right, I did.

The whole world was this close to being nothing but cosmic dust and no one would have known, which is actually the scary part here.

I never realized that life was so delicate before, that it could end just like that in a blink of an eye. And we were this close to being wiped out, I can't still sleep after all this happened.

My girlfriend nearly consumed our world. Now, you might be wondering, what the heck is this guy talking about? But its true, she was already on her way to consume the entire planet once it caught her attention. She's a cosmic entity, you see. I don't know how she got here and where she came from and all she was said was that she devoured worlds to sate her hunger, especially those with life on it.

Apparently, she was passing by when the Earth caught her attention and she decided to devour it. But became fascinated by the life on it, she decided to explore its surface before consuming it. Which is how we found each other, to me she looked like any other girl I've met in my life. But I could tell something was off with her. I took her on a date, which conveniently delayed her decision to consume the Earth.

Because of the fascination she found in me, she halted her plan to devour our world and decided to spend time to get to know more about me and the Earth. I didn't know what she was until I found her one time, in our room and shedding her form to a darker form. The frequency I felt from it made me have a bleeding nose and I passed out the next moment, my head hurt after that.

She told me what she was after that and her original idea to consume the Earth, but that I stopped her plans when I came into her life. 

She also said that she was on Earth and not on Earth at the same time, I was at first confused by that but she explained it to me. The girl I was looking at was just a physical manifestation that she created for the Earth, but her true form existed in a far off dimension that was outside space, time and matter.

The girl was basically a hair that was plucked and put on Earth, at least that's how she explained it to me.

I've learned more so far. She can also take on a lesser cosmic form on Earth, but the frequency it emanates affects any living creature nearby. Which is why I had a nose bleed and passed out when I first saw her like that. But her true form was worse, she said it could destroy the minds of humans if any gazed at it. Which is why it was in a far off dimension.

She has recently learned how to use her face muscles, to display expressions. Its challenging but she's getting there. She's also a great cook, from just touching a recipe book and she didn't even open it. She just knew what to do, like she absorbed information from it.

She has not shown her cosmic form again after that first incident, said it was unnecessary to waste me. Whatever that means.

But I'm alive. And she's still here, and the Earth is fine still. I might not get an award for literally saving the Earth, but I guess a win is a win
