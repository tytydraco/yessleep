My hands tremble as I approach the shoreline. Whether it’s from the cutting breeze or the moment, I’m not entirely sure. 

The others are waiting in the darkness.

Doug Boyle is sitting atop a seaweed-laden rock, staring back into the nothingness. In the faint reflection of the moonlight, he appears hunched over and tired. He’s wearing the same reflective vest he always does, the same old oil-stained overalls. It’s like he’s never left the job site. In a way, maybe he never wants to leave.

Fidgeting with the ring around his finger, he glances up and nods. 

Mrs. Worton extends her arm, patting the tattered teddy bear that I’m holding on the top of its head.

She thinks it’s my dog, Mylo’s. It’s just easier that way.

I trade glances with her and smile. She’s clutching her triquetra necklace to her chest, her long robe fluttering in the wind. In her other hand is a candle, emanating an earthy scent. The tiny flame blows rapidly in the wind, dancing in the shadows. 

She’s chanting something, again. 

There are other familiar faces. People clutching sweaters in their arms or backpacks across their shoulders. Old and young, male and female, shivering in their pajamas, holding baseball caps or scarves wrapped around their arms. Staggered along the coastline in the midnight black, we look like we have arrived too late for the bonfire.

Still, I am shaking. 

Doug slowly steers his attention back to the undulating waves. The water froshes back and forth, smashing against the nearby caves and flowing steadily toward the beach. Its movement is hypnotic. 

I close my eyes and take in the sound of the waves. There is a calm presence passing through. However, it is short-lived.

The reflection from the moon casts a pale glow across the water. It has never looked so big.

The king tide comes around twice, maybe three times a year, depending. The gravitational force is strongest at the perigee, the point at which the Sun, Moon and Earth are all aligned. In early January, the tides are exceptionally high. The push and pull from the ocean is the strongest.

If the coast guards knew what we were doing they would haul us all away.

We wait until the shoreline begins to disappear. The walls of water begin to build, the calmness overtaken by steep, thrashing, tidal waves. The sea awakens.

And that’s when we know it’s time. 

Mrs. Worton takes her first steps into the water. She rocks backward with the incoming wave, narrowly managing to fight off the momentum. Doug slides in, soaking his ripped, dirtied, clothing. They wince, breathing heavily, as the chill of the water ignites their senses. 

The rest of us trudge through the sand in silence. The biting sensation brings shivers and goosebumps to my exposed flesh. 

I walk further, my dress pants clinging to my body like glue. My white dress shirt (now see-through) exposes my red, raw skin. My nipples poke through the fabric. As the water reaches my midriff,  the roar of the waves takes over. My arduous steps through the sand become painful tip-toes along the jagged rocks beneath. Soon my legs and arms give way to the water, and I begin to tread. 

It’s getting tougher and tougher to see past the foam and the slapping precision of the waves.   
Above the roar of the water, a shrill cry erupts. As I struggle to stay above the rolling tide, I am unable to focus on much else. 

But what I recognize is the fear. 

Another voice emerges– the moaning that bellows out is much deeper in tone and closer for me to pinpoint.

I know they are Doug’s cries.

“Elanor!” he screams. 

It’s enough to light a fire within me. My arms flail, my legs kicking rapidly toward the man. I see glimpses of his legs chopping through the water, but his yellow and orange vest is a speck amongst the dark, swelling pools of black. 

I do not hear him again. 

A foam soccer ball floats past. The glimmer of something gold, maybe a locket. Other clothing items litter the ocean before the waves come crashing again, discarding the items somewhere underneath their immeasurable depths. 

More screams follow–screeches that slash through the night in all directions. I become disorientated by the waves that toss me backward. I’m being swallowed up by the tide. I can feel that sick sense of regret along with a burning sensation in my lungs. As I’m gasping for air, I see something else floating up ahead. 

Mrs. Worton is riding the apex of a goliath wave, her figure largely lost amongst the bubbles. She appears and disappears, sometimes face down into the sea, her silky grey hair fanned out across the water. Other times she is face up with a wild stare.

She is too far for me to even attempt to save. 

A surge of panic floods my system. Around me, other bodies are being cast aside, thrown by the merciless tide. Their frantic chopping motions do nothing.

I have to squint to make out the sliver of beach behind me. Some of them are attempting to swim back, but I know that I can’t. 

Not after what Doug has screamed.

When I guess that I am close, I take a deep breath and dive under. The pressure squeezes my eardrums, popping as I dive deeper. The din of rushing water and bubbles fills my earways. In a normal instance, there would have been complete and utter darkness, but in this moment of space and time, a celestial power has intervened. 

They emanate a soft glow, an aura of grey light surrounding their bodies. They are floating upwards, unperturbed by the roaring waves above. 

My eyes dart from face to face. There are few distinguishing features beyond the valleys of wrinkles and pruney skin, waterlogged and bloated beyond all recognition. My heart pounds as they rise closer, their eyes cloudy, if not entirely gone.

From the strain in my guts and lungs, I know I don’t have much more left. A few more seconds, a few more panicked stares. 

My heart sinks in my chest when I realize: 

*She’s not here.* 

There is a ripple of sparkling hair skirting around in a circular motion, a silky twirl that surrounds Doug Boyle. The skin on her face is barely hanging on. His arms wrap around the woman as they spin, interlocked in an intimate embrace. Bubbles rise from his wide grin.

I note the faces of the others who have made it: some shine bright with elation, brighter than I’ve ever witnessed at the beach. They rise together, hand in hand, floating up to the surface for air.  
Other faces are riddled with pure terror as they are dragged deeper into the unknown, their trail of bubbles slowly disappearing. 

That was always the risk. 

I can’t ignore the pressure against my diaphragm any longer. My air is almost out. It pains me deeply to be this close, but I have to go. 

Just as I kick away, one of them spots me.

She propels forward, stretching one of her shriveled arms toward my leg. The gash feels both hot and cold at the same time. She continues to dig her nails into my flesh, the stinging intensifying. I kick, momentarily writhing away. But another catches the commotion, turns, and grasps my cold face. Blood pours out of my wounds in a dark, murky cloud. Their grip, their pull, is far too strong for me to break; I can feel myself sinking, lower and lower, despite my last-ditch attempt to wrestle free. I have emptied what little energy I had left. 

Fireworks of bright light begin to spark in and out of my vision. My lungs feel as if they have been scorched. Before I begin to blackout, a faint clicking noise travels in our direction. The woman's gaping mouth snaps shut, her gnashed barnacled teeth disappear. It is enough of a distraction for me to break loose, wriggling away into the open water. One quick glance back, and it’s as if they are frozen, gazing back in the direction of the sound. 

I break the surface, desperately gasping for air. There is little relief as a wall of water pounds me back under. I see faint streaks of grey light, like beacons in the night, floating back in the direction of the shore.

I somehow battle the utter exhaustion and excruciating tide toward calmer water. An orange glow begins to paint the skyline, illuminating the rows of vacation homes amongst the haze. I collapse at the edge of the beach in tears. Digging my face into the sand, my hands rubbing against the crunched shells and slimy seaweed, I cannot believe I am alive. My body lies flat as a starfish washed up on the shore.

When I recover, I notice footsteps in front of me. Doug Boyle is talking to himself, heading down the stone path to the car park. His smile is still beaming. 

I almost get up and follow. 

But in the layer of mist that sits atop the water, I notice a young figure. She’s cradling her teddy, drenched and barely visible. 

The waves run through her. 

She’s rocking it gently, back and forth, holding it just like they found her. Her face, her innocent limbs, all still intact. The damage erased.  As if the barrier was never there, and the accident never happened. 

 I sit, waiting for her to approach. But she stays standing in the distance until the mist disappears. It carries her away with it.

I never get to say goodbye.

Or I’m sorry.
