I can hear the wind howling through the door in front of me. There is frost on the knob. The narrow walls are cool to the touch and the step I’m sitting on is dusted with snow. Wooden stairs ripple below me, stopping at a faded white door. The wood is covered with scratches, trenches deep enough to show through the other side. When I looked, all I could see was endless white.

I can’t believe they’re dead. It’s so cold. I exhale steam and inhale ice. Warmth is leaking from me faster than blood through a gutshot but I’m not ready to move.

He’s waiting.

Dodger, Doc, Holly and I watched the blank movie screen while the things in the forest watched us. Doc kept nodding off next to me and Holly was paler by the minute. It’s an awful thing watching people die slow with no way to help, no one to call.

Dodger was restless, eyeing the shadows at the treeline like he wanted to pick a fight. I didn’t think that would be any use. Instead, I stared up at the stale night sky praying for any sign of life, the flare of a satellite or white scar of a red-eye flight. We were awash in isolation.

Images began to flicker across the theater screen. There was no sound. A woman and a boy, dark-haired with light complexions, walking together in a maze of lights. There were evergreens and neon reindeer, hanging light bulbs, stands selling hot chocolate. An ice rink was visible through the maze. Families and lovers glided across the ice in singles and pairs. Snow began to fall. The camera, home movie quality at best, pulled in on the boy, who looked vaguely familiar.

“Oh,” Dodger said. “Don’t. Don’t do this.”

The woman and the boy walked on, sipping hot chocolate and watching the snowfall. Then a man joined them, carrying a basket of funnel cake. Smiling, the woman took a bite then kissed him, leaving the impression of powdered sugar on his cheek. The boy reached up, asking to be carried. Handing the food to the woman, the man swept the boy up in his arms and the trio moved further into the maze. They looked like a family, happy and in love, celebrating somewhere in the shadow of Christmas.

Dodger was shaking in his chair.

“What’s wrong?” Holly asked, sitting up next him.

Dodger stared at the screen. “That’s my son and my wife. Ex-wife. And her new husband.”

The boy was light in the man’s arms, held gentle and near the way a father would carry his whole world.

“I’m sorry,” I told Dodger.

“Not nearly as much as I am,” he replied.

The screen clipped and a new video began to play. Tall and blonde, with a soldier's haircut and a game-show smile, Tom beamed down at us, standing on a stage.

“Your ex?” Dodger asked Holly.

“Mine,” I whispered.

Every fiber a showman, Tom bowed to the crowd, sweeping off his cap. There was still no sound but I remembered the applause he got, how the whole house stood and cheered. Everyone but me in the back corner, already drunk and angry about something I can’t even remember now. The movie jumped and now it was my apartment, Tom and I in the middle of another argument. I was yelling, pointing at the door. Tom only looked tired. There was no trace of that smile of his that could shine out even under a spotlight. He turned and walked away.

One more scene skip. Tom alone in his car, wearing the same clothes. This must have been just after the argument, a perspective I’d never seen. He was staring at the door to my building, crying silently, hands tight on the wheel.

Maybe Tom was trying to decide if it was worth it to walk back again one more time. Or, more likely, he was hoping I’d be the one to finally open that door, to apologize, to do better. I never realized how long he waited watching the door before he drove away.

“What happened?” Dodger asked as the screen followed the red lines of Tom’s brake lights.

I ran my fingers through my hair. “The same thing that always happened. I drank too much and said ‘sorry’ too little. We were both involved in the local theater scene, me as a writer, Tom as an actor, but only one of us was doing well. It wasn’t me. Maybe I took that out on him, maybe we were just drifting through the natural shift apart that threatens all couples and continents. Whatever it was, it made us argue and I couldn’t help but see every argument as a competition to win instead of a chance to do better. I loved feeling like I won. My writing might be mediocre but I’ve always had an exceptional talent for getting under people’s skin. There was just-”

I stopped speaking as the screen changed again. It was so strange, watching a movie without sound. All I could hear was the wind brushing the trees. No other insects or forest sounds at all. Everything happening on the screen looked loud. There was sand, high dunes, dust kicked into the air. We were watching a desert in the middle of a war zone. A trail of bullets skipped by like rocks across a pond. It was a pitched fight, a half-ring of tan Humvees circled like wagons, providing cover for about a dozen soldiers.

The camera zoomed in on two of the figures sheltering behind the vehicles, one writhing on the ground, the other crouched above. The latter was clearly Holly, looking a few years younger, in her army kit with a red medic patch on her arm. She was wide-eyed, arms stained red. The man on the ground was porcelain pale, staring up in shock. His stomach was an open cavity of scarlet and purple, guts spilling out in wet ropes. Young Holly was desperately trying to keep the man’s insides *in*, scooping and pushing and holding and crying. The dying soldier kept trying to speak but it seemed like he was choking. Blood ran down his chin, outlined his lips.

“Jesus,” Dodger whispered.

“Shrapnel,” Holly said, no emotion in her voice. But her small hands were fists and they trembled.

I exhaled hard. “A friend?”

“More,” Holly replied. “More. One of the reasons they discourage relationships. It’s hard watching friends die. Much worse watching someone you love bleed out on the sand because you can’t put them back toget-.”

Holly stopped, choking down the memory. The screen flickered and went black for a few moments. When it came back, the scene was of a beach covered in snow. Chunks of ice rolled in with the tide. Snow fell in wind-snapped sheets and fog lay over the water. Most of the beach and ocean were obscured but two figures stood out clear near the shore line.

The first was unmistakably Doc but some younger version. He was a little less gaunt, fewer cracks around his eyes and there was still dirty blonde mixed in with his graying hair. The woman standing next to him had coffee-colored skin and was built like a dancer. I recognized her as Doc’s wife from the picture we’d seen in the house’s version of Doc’s study.

Both of them stood together, hand-in-hand, looking out over the ocean into the fog and snow. Massive shadows moved on the horizon, hidden shapes that towered over the ocean. I was glad for the curtain provided by the snow and clouds and mist. I had no desire to see what those things would look like, drifting figures the size of skyscrapers.

“What is it?” Doc asked, his swollen face and glossy eyes staring towards the screen. “What do you see?”

“It’s you and your wife on a beach,” I said. “It’s snowing and-”

“Oh,” Doc cut me off. “That’s enough. I know what that is.”

Dodger turned away from the screen. “Doc, what happened?”

“I lost her. Obviously, I lost her. I don’t need to elaborate.”

“Okay,” Dodger said, “and I’m sorry but-”

The screen went black. At the same moment, the entire clearing flooded with noise. There was screaming in the woods, laughing, wailing and begging. The thump of a heavy landing. Trees cracking. The volume swelled until I was on the ground next to my chair, palms pressed against my ears hard enough I was afraid I’d crack my skull.

All of the noise stopped at the same instant. We were left in the clearing, ears still aching, in a hangover of silence.

“They’re gone,” Dodger said. He and Holly were huddled together on the ground. “The creepy kids and those spider fucks that were watching us are gone.”

Doc was the only one of us still seated. “We should go now while we can.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We walked through the forest, always on the path. Dodger helped Holly walk while I guided Doc. The four of us stayed silent. I knew I was in my head about what we’d just watched and I imagined the others were reflecting on their own movies, as well. The night was getting colder and colder. I’m not sure how many hours we’d been in the forest, or days, or weeks. It all ran together and time didn’t seem to work normally within the house.

I was pretty confident there wasn’t going to be a sunrise no matter how long we walked. The night grew darker and less hospitable as we went. Even the stars above us were changing, the constellations growing jagged and the starlight dim. There was a new star in the sky peeking over the treeline; a red star, one that caused nausea anytime I glanced at it.

Doc seemed to be adjusting well to his newer, blinder reality. I only had to guide him gently. He never wavered or tripped. Holly, however, was getting worse by the hour. The venom running through her veins appeared to be wearing her down. She did her best to keep up but struggled to walk for more than a few minutes before Dodger had to carry her. They made frequent stops whenever Holly needed to get sick by the side of the road. Dodger held her hair and did his best to comfort her while Doc and I sat on the trail.

Clouds were running up from behind us and not long after we left the theater in the clearing the wind began to rise. A storm was biting at our heels. We tried to pick up the pace but the forest seemed endless. The trail wound through strange places, stretches of woods where entire cities worth of furniture stood abandoned under the trees. There were old beds and broken chairs, dressers and nightstands and televisions, all strewn among the roots and branches around us.

It was like God had opened a dollhouse and shaken the contents out over the forest.

The clouds were swift and devoured the stars above us. Hard wind ran through us like ice sharpened to a razor. At the first crack of thunder, I debated suggesting we take shelter under the trees. But I was afraid to leave the path. Even though they were silent, I knew the creatures and the children were still likely in the woods around us. It would be a risk to even approach the treeline…

The decision was made for us when the first drops of rain fell fat and cold from the sky above. As the water hit my skin, I screamed. The rain burned. Each drop was like a wasp landing. We ran for the trees without saying a word, Dodger carrying Holly. I prayed the things watching us in the clearing hadn’t followed this far.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

“Why do you think the house showed us those home movies back there?” Holly asked.

The four of us sat together just inside the treeline. Thunder drummed above us but the rain was slowing down. An occasional burning drip would fall down from the branches above and leave a little stinging kiss on an exposed arms or necks. We were careful not to look up.

“Because it likes fucking with us,” Dodger answered. “This house has been jerking us around since we walked through the first door.”

*Poking,* I thought. *Prodding.*

“But why?” Holly asked. She was shaking constantly now, her eyes unfocused.

“Maybe it doesn’t need a reason,” Doc said. “Maybe...it’s just for fun. Or maybe it’s a test or all of that, none of that.” Doc let out a little laugh. “Maybe it doesn’t matter.”

Dodger looked out across the path. Lightning threaded through the sky.

“When we get out of here, I’m burning your house down, Doc,” Dodger said. “Sorry.”

Doc laughed again. “If we get out of here you have my blessing to try.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once the rain was finished we went back to the trail. The world around us was silent and dim. Most of the stars were still cloud covered but a ugly red tint lay over the forest. The glow came from behind the clouds from a single, blurry point of scarlet. It was like the sky was bleeding into cotton bandages. I couldn’t look at the red star (it had to be a star) for long without feeling nauseous and...angry.

We walked on and the world became increasingly stranger. The forest grew close and tight to the path. Soon enough the path became only the hint of a trail through the trees. Furniture was scattered everywhere in woods. Here and there objects and trees merged together. There was a steep hill along our way and after we crossed it we found ourselves looking down on the rest of the forest. Fog was rolling in like waves.

“Jesus,” Dodger whispered.

In the distance, half-hidden by the fog and red gloom, was the largest tree I’d ever seen. It dominated the skyline, a giant spike driven into the world. And it was *moving*. Not just swaying in the breeze; the branches stretched and undulated with a mind of their own. I thought of a massive squid deep in the ocean only with a hundred arms, each floating away from the body.

I glanced at one of the trees near us on the hill. The tree glanced back at me. A single human eye the size of a watermelon stared down from the trunk. It was bright blue. As I watched, it blinked slowly.

“Fuck this place,” I said. The rest of the group noticed the tree. The massive iris followed me as I walked closer.

“Over here,” Dodger called, looking up at another tree. His tree had an open mouth wide enough to crawl through, if you were so inclined. I wasn’t. A fat pink tongue dangled out from the lipless maw.

The mouth smiled, showing perfect teeth, and I felt my stomach flip. I tried to stay calm but there was something deeply unsettling about the trees, beyond the obvious. They seemed...aware of us. Interested.

“Just keep moving,” Doc said, cresting the hill.

I stared down at the path as I walked. Each time I glanced up at the trees closest to us I felt worse. Several of the trunks had complete faces pressing out under the bark. They wore a variety of expressions, none of them pleasant. Off in the distance, the giant tree still moved slowly. There were shining lights visible towards the end of each swaying branch. I couldn’t see anything clearly through the fog but the lights were strangely attractive, like beacons. Or lures.

Once we were over the hill, I saw that the drop to the forest below was even steeper than I’d thought. We were on the cusp of a valley that stretched for maybe a hundred yards. On the other side, the forest rose up again. There was a fallen tree between the two hill peaks. At the opposite side of the make-shift bridge I saw the next door, circular and white.

“Finally,” Dodger said. “Oh thank God.”

Holly leaned against a nearby tree, hopefully after checking to make sure it didn’t have eyes or teeth. “Don’t thank anybody yet. We still have to either cross that tree or go through the valley. I vote valley.”

“The tree is fine,” Doc said, brushing past me. He stepped one foot on the trunk. The tree was wide at the base, maybe 25-feet around and stripped bare of branches or leaves. But it seemed to get narrower as it went.

“No offense, Doc,” I said, “but how can you know if the tree is fine? Can you even see it?”

He turned back to me and grinned. His eyes were milky white. “I can sense the tree’s reliability. Have some faith.”

Doc began to walk across. We all shared a look but we followed. I tried my best not to look down. Every now and then I couldn’t resist. The fog was thick and rolling under us. Large silhouettes undulated below. One emerged from the mist slowly like a breaching whale. It was one of the branches from the giant tree. I could see the light on the end clearly now, blue and diluted. The glow was shaped like a woman, beautiful from the waist up. Her torso ended in a slick, oily thread that tied to the tip of the branch.

She smiled at me and I felt myself wanting to take a step towards her.

Dodger grabbed my arm. “Don’t look,” he said. “Eyes down, we’re almost there.”

Halfway across the gorge the trunk became too narrow to walk on. We were forced to crawl one-by-one. I’ve never liked heights. It was all I could do to keep worming forward, one hand in front of the other, knees wrapped around the tree in shaky desperation.

“Keep going,” Dodger said from behind me.

I stared down at the tree, focusing on the soles of Holly’s white shoes in front of me. After forever, we made it across. A small, neat deck branched out from under the white door. The four of us sat silently for a few moments after the crossing. Dodger was the first to stand up. He walked to the door and put his hand on the knob. I saw from the slump in his shoulders something was wrong.

“Locked,” he whispered.

I stood up and joined him. The knob, bronze and smooth, refused to turn.

“Some doors require a task or a price,” Doc said.

Dodger and I both turned then froze. Doc was holding Holly off the ground by the back of her neck. She struggled weakly but I could see the venom and the crossing had left her exhausted.

Dodger took a step towards Doc. “What are you-”

Casually, with hardly any sign of effort, Doc tossed Holly off the deck. I saw a brief glimpse of her face as she went over the edge. Then she was gone, dropping to the valley below.

“No,” Dodger screamed, charging Doc.

The movement was so quick I didn’t even see Doc’s arm twitch. But I heard the crack of something breaking in Dodger. He dropped into a ball.

“The door only needs the one payment,” Doc told me, advancing. “You can come with me if you’d like.”

I stood, frozen, unable to sync my mind to this new, horrible reality. Doc stopped in front of me, his face a scarred ruin with blind eyes.

“Well?” he asked.

My jaw moved but I couldn’t coax any words out into the world.

Doc sighed. “Not making a decision is its own decision.” He walked past me. The door opened with a loyal click. “See you on the other side.”

Then Doc was gone. I ran to Dodger. He was curled in the fetal position, clutching his chest. His breathing was harsh, wheezing. From over the edge of the deck, I saw several blue lights moving towards us.

“We have to go,” I said, trying to drag Dodger towards the door.

He kept gasping like a fish torn from the water. We made it halfway to the door before the first light caught Dodger. I pulled, with everything I had, but he was pinned by the glowing thing at the end of the branch. This one was a man, perfect like stone. I watched it take a bite from Dodger’s calf.

“Come on,” I begged, pulling Dodger’s arm. “Please come with me.”

More lights were catching up to us, climbing up the deck. Each bright shape was beautiful. They tugged at Dodger, took little bites from all over. He never screamed.

“Please,” I said, voice breaking. “Please, please, please.”

I looked down and saw Dodger staring at me.

“Go,” he gasped. “Find. Him. Kill. Him. Go.”

Dodger waved me away, weakly. The bright blue lights were swarming over him, tearing off pieces as they went. I tried one last pull and his arm came off at the shoulder where they’d been gnawing at it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That was all I could handle, and I ran, and I left him there. God forgive me, I left him there. I went through the door and closed it tight behind me. After the door was a staircase headed straight down. I stopped halfway to finish this, sitting on a cold step.

My phone battery is all but dead. I’m all but dead. All I can hear is wind. The door at the bottom of the stairs is rimmed with ice. I don’t want to go any further. But I can’t go back.

If this is it, if I die here. I’m sorry, Tom. I’m sorry I didn’t walk out to the street that night. [I’m sorry.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grand_Theft_Motto/)
