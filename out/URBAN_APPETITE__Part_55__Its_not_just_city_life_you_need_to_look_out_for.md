Cold mud filled in between my fingers as I hauled myself out of the mud on the edge of the river, several miles south of the city. Every single part of me ached and I felt like I had spent the night in a freezer, so I could only imagine what I looked like by that point. My phone was also finally dead, the battery giving up the ghost after surviving the river. But I was alive. I was tired, cut and worn, but for the most part no worse for wear. A great deal more than I could say for almost a lot of other people. Including Travis.  

I hadn’t been able to focus on what had happened after Travis had taken his shot. I had been struggling to stay above the water as I did my best to resist drowning. My coat had protected me from a lot of the broken glass but I’d been forced to remove it to keep from sinking in the river. At some point I had gotten my shoes off, which now left me barefoot as I walked through the forest in search of something, anything that looked like it belonged to a person. The sun had just started to rise, the glowing warmth welcome after everything I’d been through. It helped a little, but this numbness wouldn’t be wearing off anytime soon.  

I finally found a paved road, and from there I turned and walked until I came across this seedy little gas station miles away from the nearest town. Speaking as someone who used to work in some dangerous areas, this was one of the roughest-looking gas stations I had ever seen, crumbling and worn-down. Two old pumps sat out in front of the building surrounded by cracked asphalt and bare dirt. Reminded me of home.  

I hauled myself in and toward the counter, greeted by a surprised bearded man a bit older than myself who looked like he had been working there longer than many people have been alive. He looked me up and down. “Rough night?” he asked. “We have a phone for paying customers.” Thankfully I still had my wallet, so one swipe of the credit card later I was able to make a call to my wife requesting a ride, with what I promised to be a very thorough if unbelievable explanation for why I was calling from some random gas station in the middle of nowhere. She had no idea what had happened to the city, and I had a feeling she wasn’t going to find out. There was no way this was going to be allowed into circulation. Even if Travis had succeeded, if he had managed to strike true, this would never get past those in power.  

I also purchased a large stockpile of junk food to hold me over, and the gas station attendant was even kind enough to lend me his computer at my request. So I sat in a small little booth to the side, awaiting my ride as I typed out everything that had happened in the posts you’ve been reading up until now.  

“Quite the story,” said the attendant over my shoulder, making me jump. “That place up north always seemed really off, but you can’t really tell about those sorts of places until you go there yourself. As close as I am, though, I always figured.”  

“Wait,” I said. “You believe my story?”  

“I’ve been here long enough to learn about things the average person never does,” said the attendant, moving away from me and back behind the counter. “One of those things being… I guess you could think of them as mimics. No real form to call their own, but able to become one with inanimate objects, integrate themselves in with them to make use of the disguise before eventually moving on to someplace else, leaving a shell behind. They’re an old species, old enough to see humans come into their own and move across the world. Though none of them remember the time before humanity; human sapience and their sapience are tied together. Not many like to think about their own self-awareness being courtesy of their food, though.”  

“So these monsters have been eating people for millennia?” I asked. “How could people not know about this, no matter how good their disguises are?”  

He chuckled. “They’re not really monsters,” he said. “Think of it like a wolf. A wolf will hunt down and eat a rabbit, or even several of them to get full. It’s not out of some sense of malice, or even that the rabbit is its preferred prey. It just needs to eat, and it takes a lot of rabbits to keep going. Though I suppose the rabbit would see the wolf as a monster for eating its kind.”  

As he finished his comparison, a man wearing a ski mask burst in and pointed a gun at the counter. “Give me a bottle of whiskey and whatever you have in the register!” he barked. He glowered at me as well. “And you, empty your pockets or you’re both dead!” We both complied, him snatching the meager contents of the cash register and his whiskey as well as my wallet. He knocked over one of the snack stands on the way out and made it into the lot, heading to an idling truck nearby.  

Before he made it halfway, though, the ground opened up beneath him and he fell in, dropping his gun and the whiskey. He scrabbled at the crackled asphalt around him, screaming as he struggled in vain to break free from the jaws of a creature that I thought I’d escaped. The open feel of this little gas station evaporated and suddenly I felt like the walls were about to cave in on me and crush me to paste. I glanced at the gas station attendant but he didn’t even so much as flinch, focusing on fixing up the fallen stand.  

Soon the robber was gone, nothing left but a new crack in the asphalt that had moved back into place. The gun and whiskey had vanished, undoubtedly sucked into the ground, and the truck moved on its own, rolling downhill in the direction of the highway. The natural slope led it onto the main road and it traveled a ways before I heard a distant crash. The attendant gave me a smirk.  

“Some aren’t too choosy about their prey, but I find less people get suspicious when it’s just criminals that go missing,” he said. “No one is going out of their way to look for…” He paused for a moment. “Charlie Friedman, born in 1987, from Hannibal, Missouri. He did sign up to be an organ donor, but I don’t think he expected how that would come about.”  

I still couldn’t get myself to move. He smirked. “While I might not attract the clientele one would think a gas station would want, I do value those that don’t think I’m just an easy score,” he said. “I appreciate the latest gossip. I thought the last of the giants had starved. Most do when they get that big. But I guess that one figured out how to best conserve energy. Got sloppy letting you two get so close to its core, though. Maybe your friend made it pay for that mistake.”  

He thought for a moment. “You mentioned the Lewis and Clark building near Jennings in your story?” He asked. I managed to nod. He moved over to me, taking the laptop. He saved my final post to draft before logging me out and closing the lid. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out something that he shoved into one of my hands: my wallet. “Been so long since we passed each other looking for new grounds. Tell that one I said hi if you ever pass by it, little rabbit,” he said. Something outside caught his eye. “But for now I think your little doe is here.”  

I looked outside and saw my wife’s truck. I didn’t say another word to the gas station; I bolted out of its depths as fast as I could and threw myself into the truck, wrapped up in my wife’s arms as she squeezed me. “What on earth happened to you, Steve?” she asked. “What is going on? I can’t find anything online. I can’t even find the city online!”  

“I’ll tell you,” I said, borrowing her cell phone to make my final edits after our talk. I looked back at the gas station to see him just inside the building, smiling at me, giving me a wave with one hand while he held a bleached-white skull in the other. “But for now, just drive.”
