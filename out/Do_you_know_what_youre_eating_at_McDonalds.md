I know I shouldn’t post something like this. It could land me in a lot of trouble but, I have to tell everyone. I’m an employee at McDonalds, I was recently hired and I took the job because I have been really low on money recently and to be honest, they were the only ones that would hire me. Not the worst job in the world if you’ve gone to McDonalds throughout your whole life. The menu was practically ingrained into my mind before I even started working. Everything went well for the first week, sort of. They forgot to schedule me twice so my hours haven’t been very good. Third week in, they finally gave me a full schedule, and even though I had worked only 3 days up until this point, I already knew how every single system worked and how to perform the job efficiently. It’s McDonalds, it’s not rocket science. Things were good and I was finally on my way to making some money and getting myself out of this damn hole I’ve been stuck in since COVID. The pandemic ruined just about any plans I had for myself, all of the events resulting in me working at the one place people in society see as the lowest of lows. I’m getting side tracked.

Anyway, on my 4th week, I ran into something, something really fucked up. I went into work, I think it was a Tuesday and the managers didn’t seem to be present. Not a single manager showed up for their shifts that day, and for whatever reason they had forgotten to put me on the schedule for the following week. Not knowing none of them were there, I went into the manager's office to try and speak to someone. It was completely empty. The computer was gone, the usual paper work with scattered pens, even the desk. It looked like they were in the middle of cleaning out the place for some reason, and in a hurry. In another timeline the story would’ve ended here, with my managers eventually returning to work, and remodeling the office for whatever reason. Unfortunately for you, there's so much more.

Now before I continue, I want to warn you that what you’re about to read will be incredibly shocking, especially if you’ve consumed McDonalds in any capacity. It was the night shift, and only about 6 people were working. Thanks to the desk being removed, it revealed a small handle. The handle could pass as some random metal part of the wall, but I’ve done my homework on secret doors and how some of them open. The handle had no grip, it was inside of the wall, hence why I said it could easily be missed. These types of doors usually have a hidden button that reveals the handle allowing you to step inside. So I searched. And sure as shit, I found the button. I closed the manager door, I was on my break so it wasn’t like anybody was gonna notice nor care that I wasn’t around for a bit. The button was right above the entrance of the manager’s office. Looked like it could pass as a panic button, but I was never told in training or during my orientation that any such panic button even existed. If any of you have worked at a McDonalds before, you’ll know that the manager's office is pretty small. At least for my location it was. Bout the size of a small walk-in closet.

Once I was sure that nobody would notice what I was up to, I pressed the button, the handle revealed itself, and me wanting to be like Indiana Jones (movies I watched way too much as a kid), decided to walk right in. What happened next, permanently traumatized me. After opening the door, there was a pair of stairs that went down to some basement. The stairs didn’t make ANY sense. I expected a really small hidden place behind a door to keep some secret objects or whatever, but not an entire basement. On the other side of the wall from the door, was simply an open hallway. There was no way that a staircase could even exist here, yet here it was staring at me. A strange aura of invitation began to permeate through my mind, as I regrettably made my descent.

The staircase was so narrow it practically touched my shoulders as I stepped down the creaking steps, one by one. At the bottom of the stairs was a pitch black abyss the likes I’ve never experienced. Imagine the darkest room in the world, one where you couldn’t even see your hands one inch from your face; now multiply that by 10. Following the darkness came the overwhelming sense of anxiety and the feeling that I was being watched somehow. I slowly felt my way around the room, trying to find anything that I could grab onto. Eventually after rummaging around a bit, I finally found a wall; lucky enough it had a light switch on it. This was when I ran into the first warning that I should get the hell out of there. I heard something fall behind me, it sounded like metal cups tumbling on the floor, along with the sound of kitchen utensils swinging back and forward from a suspended locale. You know how every person has what’s called “fight or flight.” Well mine was fight; the kinda fight that runs directly towards the danger hoping it will end it faster. Looking behind me, I saw a pair of bright white teeth in the darkness, just smiling at me. No eyes, no nose, no hair, nobody….nothing. I couldn’t even see my own hands yet I could see this creepy fucking floating smile, like a Cheshire cat was stalking me. This frightening me to my core, activating the fight sense,  I decided to immediately turn the light on and turn directly towards the figure preparing for a full on brawl with whatever the hell was with me. There was nothing. I was half expecting maybe an old Ronald McDonald statue, or some weird person dressed up as him. But there was absolutely nothing.

Brushing it off as my paranoia, I continued to explore the basement. The room was still dark even though I had turned the lights on. The walls and floor were painted completely black. Despite me hearing the noise of kitchen utensils, I couldn't see a single one in the entire room. In fact, the room was completely empty, except for one thing. In the center of the room was a nice wooden desk, which looked like something out of the Victorian era. It has three shelves on each side with golden handles for each one. Perfect condition. I walked towards the desk, inspecting all of its finely crafted artwork that framed the entire piece. Disturbingly, the art depicted a wooden clown, carved in the act of chasing a child with its mouth agape, as though poised to devour the young one. Freaky, but not freaky enough to stop me in my tracks. That was the second warning. Idiotically, I started sifting through each of the drawers. Old documents, bills, property details, nothing interesting; that is until I opened the last drawer on the bottom left. It contained the normal junk that was expected, except I found another button. It was hidden in the back beneath all of the documents, built into the frame disguised as just part of the foundation. I pressed it, and this is where my life changed forever. The button had revealed a secret drawer that popped out from the top center of the desk. It was very thin, and had little space to hold anything except pictures. Upon inspecting the pictures, I instantly became sick to my stomach. I had never seen anything like this. This was some truly sick fucking shit guys.

In the secret compartment were pictures of mutilated dead babies. Their arms contorted and stretched out in impossible ways, the look of horror and screaming on each child's face. These kids were about one to two years old, every single one of them meeting this ungodly fate. Blood covered each kid, some of their necks being completely torn off from their bodies, along with their limbs, all placed away from the torso as if they were building a new child from different body parts. The horror truly began when I reached the very last picture. After seeing this shit, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to trust a single American food establishment ever again. The picture was a child being thrown into a meat grinder, with its stomach slit open and very much still alive. I dropped the photos on the ground in pure horror and shock, puking all over the floor and on the desk. This was my biggest mistake; not keeping my cool. In all my terror I sprinted up the stairs leaving the light and all the evidence that someone had very well been down there.

I tried to go back down during my shift but there was no way I could do it without anyone noticing me at this point. The staff weirdly questioned where I had been for so long even though I hadn’t finished my break yet. Being in the shock that I was in, I made up a story about a family accident and left work as fast as I possibly could. I don’t know what McDonalds is doing, but they are up to some sick evil shit. Now I know the truth, and so do you. The food is not what they advertise. I’m hoping this story gets out, and I’m hoping you believe me. Don’t eat at McDonalds, whatever you do. And please, let others know, I don’t think I’ll be able to for long. I can see that smile in my room, sitting in the corner just completely void of any movement. There's been a van parked outside of my house for 3 days now. I think someone is watching me.
