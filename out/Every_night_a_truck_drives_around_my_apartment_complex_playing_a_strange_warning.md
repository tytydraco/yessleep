Basically as the title says; each night at approximately 1am (Central Time), an old white truck drives laps around my apartment complex's parking lot, blasting a weird warning:

"Caution: please remain indoors. Do not exit your home under any circumstances. Please stay calm.

Caution: please remain indoors. Do not exit your home under any circumstances. Please remain calm."

And it loops, weaves through the scattered cars and echoes around the lifeless lot along with its disembodied speaker; an old Ford F-150 with a metal overhang above its bed.

The first time I saw the truck was a couple of days after my girlfriend, Lex, and I moved in. Being off of work the next day, I had stayed up late grinding out missions in an MMO. Muffled through my headset, the now-familiar warning began playing. I walked over to the front window and took a peek. I had assumed the truck was our complex's maintenance staff responding to a late-night psuedo-emergency. It's windows were empty; black, tinted to match the void above. It wasn't until the statement looped once more that I realized it was coming from the run-down vehicle. I watched through the window as the truck slowly rolled through the lot, past my building, and began it's lap around.

My complex is basically set up like a large square, the perimeter of which is made up of various buildings, quadplex's, of varying architectural styles and times. The center of the square, it's focal point if you will, is the squat reception building, usually staffed with no more than a single employee. 

It was around this central building I watched the old white truck crawl, over and over, around and around, until finally the warning ceased it's loop, and the truck casually turned down the drive, and sped away. Lex was asleep during this first sighting, but I was sure to tell her about it the next morning.

It was only a week later when she got to experience it herself.

It was a rainy night; morning(?), when we rolled into our sad little slice of life, the car's flickering dashboard proclaiming the time to be just after 1am. I believe it was 1:12 for anyone craving specifics. We had been out with some of her old friends from college, and it was nice seeing her come out of her otherwise impenetrable shell, even if some alcohol was required. 

We weren't the type to go barhopping, still aren't, but every now and then someone convinces us to take one for the team. I had only had a couple of hard ciders over the course of the night, and as such became the unintentional designated driver for my less-than-sober partner. We were busy jamming to some nostalgic early 2000s pop songs, and the sudden silence was deafening as I pulled into my usual spot and removed the key from the ignition. 

My ears rang slightly from the music, and the engine rattled dully beneath the rhythmic thrum of rain against the windshield. It would've been a peaceful moment if not for the blaring warning we suddenly found ourselves subjected to. 

"Caution:", it began, Lex's eyes widening in the muted flourescents of the automatic interior lights. I started to say something, but was shushed instantly. "Please remain indoors. Do not exit your home under any circumstances. Please remain calm."

My girlfriend, ever-curious and always down to discuss the creepy and unnerving, reached for her door's handle. My hand instinctively snapped out and latched onto her bicep. I shook my head.

The rain came down in sheets, adding a strange pattern to the background of our scene. Splotches of dim light threw shadows across the vehicle's interior as the truck passed slowly behind our parked car.

"Caution," it began again, the sound unthwarted by the gallons of water pouring over the pavement. Blinds came down over a previously empty window on the building in front of us. 

"What. The. Fuck." She mouthed silently. 

We sat in silence, listening only to the rain and the voice for another twenty minutes or so, only exiting the car when we saw the truck's headlights fade into the distance.

About a month after we moved in, the couple across the hall from us finally introduced themselves. My partner and I are both relatively anxious people, and don't necessarily go out of our way to expand our friend group. That being said, the couple was nice enough, and after we invited them in for a couple of drinks, I got my chance to hopefully get some answers.

"So how are you guys liking the complex?" The woman, let's call her Maddy, asked between sips of a Crown Apple and Sprite. 

"Aside from the landlords," the man, Doug, interjected playfully, "we already know they're shit."

I stifled a laugh.

"It's good!" Lex said enthusiastically, "except for the laundry building I guess. Pretty sure it's been closed since we got here." I saw my chance; downed the rest of my old fashioned and took it.

"And the weird speaker system that plays at night." I added sheepishly; not smooth. Doug's smile flickered slightly. The short silence was uncomfortable. He made a show of looking left and right in faux paranoia. 

"You're not supposed to know about that." He said, and paused. The room fell silent again for a split second before he burst into laughter.

"I'm just fucking with you!" He wheezed, a dumb-as-dick grin plastered across his face. "That shit's creepy, right?"

I forced a smile, slightly annoyed.

"Damn right it's creepy! I mean what even is that? I'm pretty sure it's not even the apartment that plays it."

"No no it's a fucking truck!" Maddy cut in, suddenly interested. "An old beater of a thing."

"Yeah, tinted windows and failing headlights! We saw it out there when we got home late one night." My girlfriend said, happy to be discussing a weird topic.

Silence.

It was Doug who finally spoke up.

"Well, I mean... did you do it?" Doug swirled the drink around his glass.

"Do what?" I asked, confused.

"Go outside!" Doug roared, seemingly furious.

I sunk back into my chair, suddenly frightened and on edge.

"No! I mean, we almost did, but the truck drove away after a while."

Within a second Doug was on his feet, his glass had left his hand and now sailed across the room to the wall where it shattered in a prismatic display of ice and overpriced liquor.

"YOU FUCKING LISTEN TO THAT WARNING DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME!? YOU DON'T PLAY WITH THINGS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. FUCKING APES AND HYDROGEN COLLIDERS. THE IGNORANT DISPLAY A FACADE OF BRILLIANCE ONLY SHATTERED BY THE IDIOTIC ACT OF DOING!"

Maddy was on her feet now, grabbing at Doug's arms in an attempt to get him to stop. It seemed like he was forgetting to breathe.

"WHAT KIND OF SHEPHERD WOULD LEAD HIS FLOCK TO THE PRECIPICE OF INEXISTENCE? HOW MANY WORMS-"

Doug fell to the floor in a fit of spasms. Maddy was screaming now, slapping Doug's cheeks. 

"He's fucking epileptic!" Maddy screamed, rolling Doug onto his side and holding him still against his misfiring muscles.

"What the fuck was that about? What the fuck was he talking about!?" Lex yelled at her, coming out from behind me. 

"He has episodes!" Maddy sobbed. "He's on medication but it doesn't get rid of them completely."

"Do I call an ambulance? I asked, voice shaky. 

"NO!" Maddy said defiantly. "We can't afford anymore hospital visits. I promised him the next time it happened I'd take care of him myself."

Doug flopped there, gurgling, gasping, until finally his eyes snapped open and he lay still.

I wanted to include this report here because I truthfully don't know how else to convey the events of that despicable night. That night of which I'll be attempting to flay from the deep recesses of my mind for the rest of my life.

We sat in peeling leather chairs for over an hour before the cops sent us home. My mind was a fucking maelstrom, flinging thoughts and empty questions about my brain ruthlessly. They asked Maddy to stay longer, hoping to get some answers when she calmed down.

I don't remember the drive home, it's contents blurred by the barrage of my brain. I remember turning off the car, grabbing the doors handle, and being pulled forcebully back to the present moment.

Though it wasn't the mayhem of my mind that forced my attention back to reality, but a familiar, static-filled, whine.

"Caution" 

I looked at the time on the dashboard, tears welling up in my eyes. 1:24 A.M. Lex began sobbing. 

"Please remain indoors."

I declined my seat, climbed into the back, and pulled Lex with me.

"Do not exit your home under any circumstances."

We were both crying now, holding each other tight against the end of the world.

"Please remain calm."

We woke in the early hours of a new day, blind to the exterior movements of life. Numb, we climbed the staircase to our apartment and walked inside, careful to step over the invisible corpse which would forever rot on the floor of our solace.

Lex stripped off her clothes, now tainted with the intangible fetor of death, and climbed into the shower robotically. I walked straight into the bedroom, sat at my desk, and turned on the computer.

That leads me to now.

The reception building, if it's even staffed today, opens in less than an hour. I'm going to take a second to screw my head back on and go ask them straight. Considering the truck leaves when it's broadcast is over, I don't have high hopes for the complex staff knowing anything, but I have to do something.

I feel like I'm going mad.
