“How long till we get there?”



“Just twenty more minutes.”



He smiled and put his hand on my thigh.



Why did it feel so awkward? I used to love it when he would do that.



“So yeah, and Darren tried to make me present...”



“Oh, we’re almost there.”



“What? Are you not interested in my story?”



“I am.”



“Hm, okay.”



Jesus, Jake, how could you get offended at that? You’ve talked for an hour and a half.



I tried to ignore him and looked out.



Beautiful tall pine trees stood beside the road, overlooking the green moss-covered ground below them.



“Look, Jake, the cabin.”



It was a beautiful, freshly painted wooden house with large windows and a brick chimney.



Jake didn’t answer.



It wasn’t until after I cooked dinner and gave him some beer that he started talking again.



“And so you should have seen Jason’s face when….”



He quickly looked to the right as if someone had said his name.



“When what? What’s up?”



“Do you hear that?”



He narrowed his eyes and started bobbing his head.



“Hear what?”



Jake didn’t respond; his eyes had closed, and his mouth opened.



I started laughing.



But then I heard it too, a faint whispering. It was coming from the outside. 



I looked out the window.



 An old lady was standing there. She looked right back into my eyes.



I stumbled back in my chair.



A knock.



The whispering stopped. Jake opened his eyes again.



“Hello, neighbours. Could you open the door, please?”



“Sure.”



Jake got up, but I grabbed his hand and looked at him beggingly.



“Stop,” he whispered and walked to the door.



On the other side stood a lady, about 70 years old, dressed in a black dress with a pale face and long white hair. She was smiling, her eyes filled with kindness.



“I’m sorry, I hope I didn’t disturb you.”



“Oh, no. How can we help you?”



“Could I borrow some salt?”



“Sure.”



Jake walked to the kitchen, grabbed a bag from the pantry, and poured some into a small cup.



He shook his head at me when he walked back to the door.



“Here you go.”



“Oh, thank you so much. I’ll make sure to bring back what I don’t use.”



“Please don’t worry about it.”



She smiled and walked away.



“What’s up, Liv?”



“But, but the whisper…no one’s supposed to be around.”



“Can you stop? It’s just an old lady.”



He grunted and got back to his dinner. I gulped down my glass of wine and poured another.



That night, I kept having a recurring nightmare of a dark, shadowy figure walking through the dark forest, whispering. Each time it saw me, I would wake up in cold sweat.



In the morning when I woke up, my head was throbbing.



I looked over, and Jake was lying next to me awake, staring at the ceiling blankly.



Before I could say anything, stomach acid shot up my throat, and I had to run to the bathroom.



So strange, I only had a few glasses.



At noon, Jake went to the bathroom. Then a loud knock.



I carefully looked out the window. The old lady was standing outside.



My blood froze in my veins.



Please come out, Jake.



“Can you get it, Liv?”



Another knock.



“Liv?!”



“Um, sure.”



Grabbing the doorknob, I slowly opened the door.



The old lady was standing on the other side holding the cup of salt.



It was almost full, as if she barely used any, maybe even added some.



“Thank you so much for the salt. I brought back what I didn’t use.”



“Thanks.”



“Everything okay, dear?” 



“Yes.”



“I’m not gonna bother you anymore. You have a great stay.”



She turned and walked away.



“Was it Helen?” Jake said, coming out of the bathroom.



“How do you know her name?”



“She was here yesterday. Don’t you remember?”



At dinner, Jake stared blankly, slowly drinking his beer, barely paying attention to what I was saying. I decided to go to sleep.



I woke up in the middle of the night with my head spinning. Jake was not in the bed next to me.



Quickly, I ran to the toilet. 



I wiped my mouth and went back to the bedroom.



As I stood over the bed, I heard a sound.



Where did I hear it before?



It was the whisper. 



My ears began ringing and my vision blurred. I had to grab onto the wall.



It was coming from the kitchen.



Standing still, I listened.



The whisper kept getting louder. It had a slow, deep melody.



A smell of iron was in the air.



Jesus, where was Jake?



I looked back into the bedroom, but the bed was still empty.



Taking a deep breath, I slowly peered into the kitchen.



My feet began to shake.



There stood Jake in the dark, hunched over, dangling from one side to the other.



Before him stood Helen with her arm up in the air, moving it around as if Jake were her puppet. The look of a kind old lady was gone. Her skin was blistered and cracked. Spit formed around her mouth as she whispered louder.



Her bloodshot eyes looked in my direction.



I pulled my head back.



“Get her!” She yelled in a deep, raspy voice.



Loud footsteps.



Jake was walking in my direction.



Letting out a bloodcurdling scream, I turned, opened the window, and ran out.



The forest was bright, and its ground felt cold on my feet.



Behind me thumped Jake’s steps.



“I’m coming, Liv!”



Soon, the thumping was right behind me.



I could feel Jake’s breath on my neck.



Then his hands grabbed me and pulled me to the ground.



I tried to fight him off, but he was too strong.



He put his hands on my neck, gripping it tight.



His hands were strangely cold.



“Jake, Jake, please no!”



Something in his eyes twitched.



“Jake, please wake up,” I whispered.



He got off of me, wobbling around, staring at the ground.



I didn’t wait, got up, and sprinted away.



Soon, I reached the road. 



With each step, I was shaking, looking over my shoulder.



It took another thirty minutes to flag down a car.



The kind soul who picked me up brought me to a hospital.



I was in a state of severe shock and had bruising around my neck.



The police took my statement and searched the cabin.



Jake was nowhere to be found; our car and things were left behind.



No sign of Helen either.



He hasn’t answered anyone’s calls.



The doctors released me from the hospital today. My kind sister let me stay on her couch.



I was sitting in her apartment, writing this post, when I received a text from Jake.



It said: “Listen.”



I quickly perked up.



The whisper is coming from the hall now.



It’s saying my name.
