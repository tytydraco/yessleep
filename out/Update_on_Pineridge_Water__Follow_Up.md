Hey, Sam here again. A few days have passed since my last update, and things aren’t exactly getting easier. If you didn’t catch my previous post, here’s the gist: I’d noticed some microscopic stuff making it through the plant’s treatment, colleagues had seen it too, and the Board dismissed our concerns. I even called the local hospital to see if there was any connection to the recent uptick in illnesses, but they assured me it wasn’t related. Still, something doesn’t sit right.

After a bit of thought, I reached out to a smaller, family-run clinic here in town — Doc Marlowe’s clinic. For context, this place has been around longer than the corporate hospital. Doc Marlowe himself has been practicing here for decades, with his wife and daughter, who are both nurses, running most of the day-to-day. The clinic’s kept going because it’s cheaper than the hospital for general care and the locals really trust them. The hospital handles things like X-rays, broken bones, and serious diseases, but for routine check-ups, minor illness, or just talking things over, Doc Marlowe is who people come to. I thought if anyone could make sense of what I was seeing, it’d be him.

I sent a sample from the plant to Doc Marlowe, hoping they might at least confirm whether it was harmful. He got back to me quickly at first, asked a few questions, and seemed genuinely concerned. Honestly, it felt like talking to someone who actually cared, not just ticking boxes or defending a budget. It’s a relief in a town where most official channels seem more interested in appearances than safety.

But I haven’t heard back with any results yet. Doc Marlowe assured me he’d let me know as soon as the tests were complete, and I trust him — he’s not the type to ignore something serious. Still, I can’t shake the feeling of being in a holding pattern.

Meanwhile, the Board is continuing their little campaign of quiet intimidation. I got a personal notification this week warning me that if I keep posting about “unverified claims,” I could face suspension or forced leave. They made sure to phrase it as an official reminder about professional conduct and maintaining “consistent messaging” for the community, but it’s clear who it’s aimed at. To anyone from the Board reading this: yes, I know you’re watching. I’m not going to stop posting just because you don’t like what I have to say.

So that’s where things stand. The water is still coming through with whatever it is, some people are getting sick, the hospital hasn’t been helpful, and I’m now working with Doc Marlowe’s clinic to get a clearer picture. Any updates I get from him, I’ll share here immediately.

For those living in Pineridge — keep boiling your water. For anyone who knows someone here, please pass this along. I’m doing my best to make sure there’s a record of what’s happening, and that people can take precautions while we try to figure this out.

I’ll check in as soon as I hear from Doc Marlowe. Hopefully it won’t be long.
