Have you ever heard of Fortitude Electric? Probably not, because it's not the type of company you'd find in the headlines or advertised on billboards. I used to work there, and let me tell you, it was the most mysterious and eerie place I've ever been a part of. What was once thought to be a nuclear power plant turned out to be something far more sinister.  
  
I was just an ordinary employee, like many others, until I caught wind of the truth. You see, Fortitude Electric wasn't generating power from regular nuclear reactors; it was utilizing something far darker - a demonic pentagram reactor. Only a select group of high-class employees knew about this, and they guarded the secret fiercely.  
  
The facility itself was a colossal underground structure, massive enough to rival a bustling airport. Its mundane exterior belied the horrors hidden below. I stumbled upon the truth by accident when I overheard a heated conversation between two executives. They spoke of demons and vessels, and how Fortitude Electric had struck a sinister pact to harness their otherworldly energy.  
  
The demonic reactor was kept deep within the lower levels of the facility, shrouded in secrecy.   
For years, this unholy alliance between Fortitude Electric and the demons seemed to be going smoothly. The company amassed untold power and wealth while the rest of the world remained oblivious. But nothing dark remains hidden forever, and fate has its own plans.  
  
One fateful day, the unthinkable happened - a catastrophic leak occurred in the demonic reactor. Demons broke free from their containment, possessing employees and driving them to commit unspeakable acts of horror, including mass suicides within the facility's walls.  
  
In a desperate bid to contain the unleashed demons, Fortitude Electric devised a twisted solution. They selected a random employee to become the new vessel, capturing him and locking him away in a demonic containment chamber. The poor soul became nothing more than a conduit for malevolent entities.  
  
The company believed they had regained control, but evil knows no bounds. The captive employee, driven to madness by the demonic influence, managed to break free from his imprisonment. His wrath knew no bounds, and he slaughtered everyone in the facility, leaving not even a trace of their bodies behind.  
  
The massacre left Fortitude Electric in ruins. The once imposing underground complex turned into a tomb of darkness. The news of the company's disappearance spread like wildfire, but the true horrors that unfolded within those walls remained untold.  
  
Authorities investigated, but the evidence was scarce, and no one could explain what had really happened. The power plant location was unknown to almost the whole world. And those that knew didn't dare tell anyone where it was. All that was left were the whispers and rumors among the few who had managed to escape the cataclysm.   
  
As for me, I'm one of the lucky ones who survived. But the horrors I witnessed at Fortitude Electric continue to haunt my nightmares, and I can't help but wonder what became of the demon-infested employee who was once their vessel. God help anyone who manages to stumble into that facility, unknowing of the horrors that lurk inside.
