*ding*  


"Cabin crew please be seated for takeoff" the Captain announced over the tannoy as the plane taxied off the apron. After 30 seconds or so of screaming down the runway, we were airborne and I was well on my way home after an exhausting business trip. I shuffled my playlist and snuggled into my neck pillow to get some badly needed rest, planning to sleep for the duration of the three-and-a-half-hour-long flight.   


I was jolted awake by the flight attendant making her rounds before our descent, having left the tray table my phone and unread book were resting on unstowed. It was well past sunset so I couldn't make out much, but thought the usually light pollution-heavy city looked particularly dark. I had just woken up though, and so didn't make much of it in my still-drowsy state.  


We touched down, the Captain thanked us for flying with his airline and welcomed those of us who lived here home. The usual spiel. I smiled and thanked the two flight attendants at the door before making my way onto the jetbridge. I had flown this route at this particular time into my home airport hundreds of times by now, and so getting from the arrival gate to the baggage hall was practically muscle memory. Flight 006, the monotony of the routine had been burned into my brain. To my surprise, upon scanning the reclaim screen for the conveyor belt our flight's bags would be arriving on, the word "Delayed" sat next to the flight number in little red letters. Odd, but this flight was delayed quite often and we were actually delayed coming out of the origin airport but had made up the time to land a couple of minutes early so I figured the messaging lagged a little behind real-time for one reason or another.   


I waited around and hoped a conveyor number would pop up at some point, but after about 40 minutes I grew impatient and decided to walk to the information desk just by the exit. Upon asking about my flight, the agent responded "Are you sure this is your flight number? We've, um, been having a bit of trouble with finding out where this plane is". I replied, "What do you mean finding out where this plane is?" dumbfounded, and the younger gentleman then asked to see my boarding pass. I fished it out of my backpack and handed it over, and he was visibly shaken before saying he needed to speak with a supervisor. A few minutes passed, and whilst the original agent didn't return an older woman came to the desk and expressed her profuse apologies for the mix-up and that there had been an issue with the baggage on our flight. She said that all passengers would be e-mailed with instructions for picking up their baggage tomorrow morning or having it delivered later in the week.   


At this point, I just wanted to get home and so I begrudgingly accepted her apology and left the reclaim hall to hail a taxi. Strangely, the steering wheel was on the opposite side to where it usually is in our country. Out of a bored curiosity, I asked the driver if he had bought the car in Europe to which he replied: "No Sir, I got it at an impound about 50 miles North of here". If you're wondering about the steering wheel, I dunno either." Weird, I thought.  


An hour later, the car came to a stop outside my home and I exited with a tip and a wry smile. I twisted my key into the door and swung it open to shout my usual "Anyone home?". My wife's reply to this was always "Here, Honey!", typically followed by my two kids' - Noah and Leo - excited screaming. "Here" she called out in a flat tone. I followed their voices to our bedroom and hugged my wife, worried something was wrong. She smelled different. I couldn't quite place exactly what the smell was, but it wasn't pleasant. A slightly metallic, strange scent. Then I got a good look at her face. She was still as pretty as ever, but her skin was pale and stretched. Her eyes sunk and it looked as if she hadn't slept in years. I asked her what was wrong.   


"Nothing".  


I pressed the issue.  


"I just thought they couldn't find your flight and I've been so worried I haven't picked up the kids from soccer practice yet".   


"What do you mean they couldn't find my flight, why does everybody keep saying that??? And since when have our kids been playing soccer?"  


I might have been a busy parent and did miss an engagement or two every now and then because of work, but our two children were the furthest from sports enthusiasts and they both hated soccer because being the non-sporty ones they'd always be chosen last by the other kids during Phys Ed.   


She said that our flight had disappeared, and it was all over social media and the news. Even implored me to check for myself. With a great deal of scepticism, I did just that and was startled to find she was not playing some silly joke on me. "FLIGHT 006 MISSING" the first headline read. Just as I had with the agent at the desk earlier, I showed her my boarding pass and she also tried to pass it off as some mix-up. That I must have been on a different plane, that there is no other explanation that would have led to us having that conversation. That we were together, and everything would be just fine.  


I needed to clear my head. My way to do that was always to go for a drive. I told her I would pick the kids up in her car. After protesting and claiming I was tired and confused and should just head to bed for quite some time, she relented and gave the address of the sports field. After a brief drive, I arrived at the supposed location. I figured the kids had been in the back seat earlier because the youngest had forgotten his stuffed toy there. He hated not having that toy with him so I expected some tears when I saw him.  


There was nothing there. No sports field, no sports hall, no building of any kind. Concrete, as far as the eye could see. Just concrete. I texted my wife "Did you get the address wrong? There isn't anything here." She replied almost instantaneously "Huh. Weird". Between her dishevelled appearance and strange behaviour, I was getting slightly worried at this point. I glanced into the rear-view mirror in some meek attempt to find out if the sports field had simply manifested itself in the seconds I'd been looking away. Still no sports field. I did catch another glimpse of Noah's teddy bear. Its glistening white nose had a smear of red on it. I reached into the back seat to grab it, and the same scent my wife had been sporting wafted into my nostrils. Between the smell and the red smear, I put two and two together. It was blood.   


I frantically texted my wife again.   


"Did Noah or Leo have an accident or something since I've been gone???"  


Another instantaneous reply.   


"Honey, no. What are you talking about? Who are Noah and Leo?".  


"What the fuck do you mean who are Noah and Leo??? Where are they, what have you done?‚Äù I retorted, my head now hot and voice furiously snarling.   


"Just come home honey, we can have a nice dinner like we always do after your trips. I've already eaten but I'm *still* hungry".  


I am not going back to that fucking house.  


I don't know where I am, or what happened to the plane I was on but I do not belong here. This is not my home. I need to get out. I don't know how but I need to find my way home. To my wife. To Noah and Leo.   


Where they are still safe.
