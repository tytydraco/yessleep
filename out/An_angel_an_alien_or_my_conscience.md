I have experienced something that defies any rational explanation, an incident that transcends the bounds of the ordinary. It's a tale of mysterious intervention, an encounter with destiny that I still ponder, wondering if a guardian angel guided me through the labyrinth of life.  
  
Picture an autumn evening, the air carrying the fresh scent of fallen leaves. I found myself in the warm embrace of a friend's abode, wrapped in laughter and the soothing cadence of shared stories. As the evening unfolded, a gentle reminder of the outside world nudged me to embark on the journey back home.  
  
Navigating the quiet streets, I followed the familiar routine, traversing the same route that had become a comforting ritual. The clock struck midnight, and the outside world seemed to hush, amplifying the echo of my footsteps against the pavement. Little did I know that this ordinary night would transform into an extraordinary tale.  
  
Approaching an intersection, an imposing building cast shadows that obscured my view of oncoming traffic. Nevertheless, the traffic light beckoned like a beacon, its luminous green granting me the right of way. In the quiet of that late hour, I moved forward with a sense of familiarity, oblivious to the imminent turn of events.  
  
The soundtrack to my solitary journey was provided by a playlist of Iron Maiden, the music pulsating through my headphones, creating a cocoon of sonic isolation. The rhythmic beats urged me to quicken my pace, ensuring I wouldn't miss the fleeting green light.  
  
Then, a sudden break in the symphonyâ€”a voice, resonant and powerful, reverberating as if someone were running toward me, shouting at the top of their lungs. Upon hearing this, I yanked off my headphones and turned around, fist raised, as I was sure someone was charging at me from behind to attack. To my great surprise, there was no one.  
  
Startled, I replaced my headphones and turned around to cross the street before the light turned red, and at that very moment, a large cargo truck sped past me at a crazy speed, running the red light. From where I stood, unable to see because of the building on the corner, if that powerful voice hadn't scared me enough to stop walking, I would have been hit head-on by that truck.  
  
That day, I thanked life; there's someone... somewhere... who saved me in some way.  
  
And the story doesn't end there. Upon arriving home, I turned the corner of the street, and on my stairs, looking a bit lost and gazing upward, there was a young woman. It was the middle of the night, no one was on the streets, and strangely, there was someone on my stairs.  
  
The lamppost's light shone on her, and she seemed radiant. Seeing me approach, she resumed walking toward me, and as she passed by me, she smiled. I unlocked my door and looked one last time, but the girl had disappeared, probably turning the corner of the street and continuing her way.  
  
I've always wondered if, in the end, it wasn't my guardian angel ensuring that I was indeed alive.  
  
Anyway, I thank destiny once again for not being struck that day by that truck that had run a red light, and I wanted to share this story with you.
