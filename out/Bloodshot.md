It was the loud of July the Fourth, and I stayed up all night on my IPhone, planning a special pool party for the specific day a week or two prior to this. My parents were out of town this weekend and they left me with an array of good food I could grab in the fridge. 

I constantly reminded myself of the boundaries my parents had when I threw these parties they had no idea about. This meant the event had to be secluded to the backyard, making it a pool party. I called everyone during the day, met up with a few friends, and planned my pool outfit. I selected a choice of a Hawaiian button-up, black shorts, and of course my flip flops for the pool. Night arrived and just around 20-25 people had arrived, which wasn’t too bad. 

Fireworks echoed through the midst of the night as I welcomed friends and buddies through the backyard gate. The slide-in backyard door and the front door were both locked so I didn’t expect anyone to get in, and my parents room included a well-hidden gun safe. I set a table so that people could take shots. My friend Adam came up to me and thanked me for inviting him and asked me something I kind of hoped for. He asked if he could stay the night when the party ended. This meant not only could I throw a nice pool party tonight but I would also be able to sleep over with a good friend of mine. 

Me and Adam have been friends since 7th grade, I am now a sophomore and we still remain good friends besides the time we threw hands over a girl in 8th grade. I stepped away from Adam to take only one shot since i refused to get drunk, and as I bragged about how my now third one was light work I forgot the pool was directly behind me. I slipped and crashed in, floating down to the abyss and back up once my density pulled me up. In a sudden shimmer of the pool reflection I saw something, a figure in a red and black hood with black sweatpants maliciously staring from the other side of the pool. Fortunately, when I floated to the surface the figure was nowhere in sight. After a good 2 hours passed everything died down and the guests left. I locked the doors, blinded the windows, and activated the security. Me and Adam winded down in my room and got ready to go to sleep when I heard a crash from the kitchen downstairs.

“What the fuck?” I exclaimed, startled by the unknown loud noise. 

“Stay here Adam, I’m gonna go check.” I told him, and I pushed my bedsheets off and snuck downstairs to investigate. I grabbed the vase near the stairs and held it up. Glass was shattered on the floor in the middle of the kitchen, and that’s when I knew something was in my house. I clutched my vase tight and gazed around. I knew I couldn't make it upstairs. As I collected this thought I loosened the grip of the vase. I will never let go of the fear I had when I turned around to catch a figure with dim skin and wide bloodshot eyes in all black crouched around the corner. I screamed in fear and sprinted up to the stairs as gunshots followed just like the light that emitted from it. 

I raced into my parents room, forgetting about Adam. I called my mother over and over but not a single answer came. I frantically asked my father for the code to the gun safe through text, but still not a single answer. I sobbed as I locked myself in my parents bathroom and heard crashing and yelling. This was a planned robbery I realized. I looked up into the mirror to gaze at my final sight. Adam in all black staring at me from the closet behind me with a handgun grasped firmly.
