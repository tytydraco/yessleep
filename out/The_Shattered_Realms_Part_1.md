I don't know if you'll believe me when I tell you about this. But I swear, my father is a man of his word, and when he says it happened, I can vouch for that. 

My father disappeared a year ago, and a month ago, he was discovered dead, with wounds bad enough that I won't describe them here. We were cleaning his office, which he kept so very secret, when I discovered a set of journals, describing his life in another dimension. 

I will post the first entry, in hopes that we can piece together the mystery of his death. What happened in 'The Shattered Realms', which he called it, will forever be a question to me. I don't know how he left the place, and I am thankful to be oblivious to its entryway. I need to solve this. 

I need your help.

**THE SHATTERED REALMS, JOURNAL ENTRY (ABOUT ROBERT BLACKWOOD)**

My father was a strange man. I didn't know him, of course, but I have heard stories about him. This note, which I am about to share with you, was delivered to me during my travels, and it helped me understand a lot of what has happened to me. 

Ten years before I began my journey, my father ended his own: 

*I ripped open drawer after drawer in a frantic search for the needle. The floor became a mess, and the journal almost seemed to absorb the good in the room. I had finally cracked the code. I had finally solved the mystery, but I needed to find that needle.* 

*Then a flash of remembrance shot my brain, and I spun around, looking at the old wooden planks that made the basement floor. With a hushed excitement I ran towards the little shorter plank and flipped it up, revealing a hidden whole underneath. And there it was, a glass needle with thick red liquid floating inside. Sebastian. I thought with panic and sadness ripping my heart apart.* 

*I ran up the stairs and kicked the door open. Sebastian was sleeping quietly in his crib when I found him, and the sight was a knife stabbing me in the heart. A single tear ran down my cheek as I picked the little baby up.* 

***Robert:*** *Ten years from now, you will be great. I’m sorry it has to be you, but they will come for me soon. If only I could bear this burden instead of you.* 

*Sebastian woke up with a confused face, finding comfort in his father. I grabbed the child’s arm and took a deep breath. Then I placed the needle over the exposed vein, and injected the serum. The baby’s cries ripped my soul into a thousand pieces.* 

*Unkind knocks echoed through the room then, and a shout came from behind the door.* 

***Wallguard:*** *Deserter! Face your faith!*

*I froze for only a second, thinking about the punishment I would receive should I be caught. I leapt for the window and crawled through, barely getting out before the door was kicked open. I found my horse in the back and quickly mounted it.* 

***Robert:*** *Go!*

 *I shouted, holding my gun with one hand, and the reigns with my other. The horse galloped away, with the Wallguard right behind, climbing their horses. I looked behind and met their angry faces. Perhaps this was all a mistake.* 

*The towering walls grew nearer and nearer, and so did freedom. The guards standing by the entrance shouted at him to stop, but I raised my gun and fired repeatedly. I had stood on that place countless times and knew exactly which buttons to press to get the gate open, sparing a second to close it again. When a gate separated them, I heard the familiar voice of Commander Varian.* 

***Varian:*** *Leave him!* 

***Wallguard:*** *Why? He needs to be punished!*

***Varian:*** *Being out there is punishment enough.*

*I slowed my tempo then, breathing out in relief. Eventually, Sebastian would make them understand. The shadow of the walls grew fainter and fainter, but my nervousness grew. I entered the forest with a sense that something was watching me, and it did not want me any good. I got awfully dizzy, gripping tighter on the reigns and studying my surroundings. My heart skipped a beat when I saw a grey hand snatched away from behind a tree. The fingers where thin and long, and the nails were black and sharp.* 

*I blinked heavily, trying to get my blurry vision to sharpen, but my head started pounding. When I looked up, I faced the brown bark of a tree and jumped away in panic. I hit the snowy ground and fumbled to stand upright, seeing that my horse had already galloped away, and noticing that there was no tree in front of me. I had hallucinated, not a good sign. I felt my body shaking, fear taking over.*  
*Something was watching me, coming closer and closer. I turned around frantically, trying to get a glimpse of it, but nothing seemed to be there. I got an uneasy sensation that something touched my shoulder, and brushed it off, turning around. I fell back to the ground, with wide eyes and a wide open mouth, trying to scream. My throat was too dry, and my body was frozen in place.* 

*In front of me stood a tall, gaunt creature with a black tattered cloak. It had grey skin and incredibly thin limbs, stretching almost as long as a human body. It peeked from behind a tree, radiating fear, stretching towards my face. It clawed at me, leaving me with a burning pain on my cheek. It started edging closer, both hands outstretched, and I finally reacquired the ability to scream.* 

He managed to get away from this incident, because of his knowledge of The Horrors. The creature he encountered was a Dreadstalker, and he knew their weakness. But it wouldn't be our family's first time to face a Horror. It wouldn't be the first time at all. He died shortly after this, the people he was with told me their theories, but they don't matter all that much. Only the mystery of The Shattered Realms does.
