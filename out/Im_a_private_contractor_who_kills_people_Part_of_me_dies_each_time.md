This is one of the more fucked up things I’ve faced. Obviously I made it out okay, but not everyone else did.

----------------


I knew it was going to be a bad day when my friend died and then came back to life as some sort of vampire creature. To be honest, we never established exactly what these monsters were, other than the fact that they die when their necks are pureed into goop and they explode in the sun. [But it went from bad to worse when we found out that the rescue operation was a ruse to trap us, but it still wasn’t clear why](https://redd.it/yzb5kp). The cherry on top is that the little girl we were sent to rescue seemed like the only decent person in the whole fecal festival. I had already subconsciously decided to save her no matter what the cost when her bitch of a mother appeared outside the third story window.

*tap tap tap*

That sound is so much creepier when the person knocking on the glass is floating.

The four of us watched, frozen, as she slid the window a few inches and slipped her fingers inside. Slowly, she pulled it open. 

We hadn’t been able to see her face, because she was on the opposite side of the rising sun and still shrouded in darkness. When she finally peeked her head inside, her skin was so alabaster-white that it looked like we were watching a mannequin moving on stop-motion, spindly legs squeezing into the room like an oversized insect.

Becoming incapacitated with fear is not an option in my line of work; that mistake can prove instantly fatal. But terror got the better of me for just a moment before I forced my mind loose.

I took stock of the environment: Big Mike was near the stairs, I was on the far side of the room from him, Data was chomping on the gristly remains of the man who’d attacked us, and the little girl was in the middle of it all, calmly facing her mother. We could make a run for the steps, but we had to operate on the assumption that more attackers were waiting to bottleneck us at the bottom while Mannequin Lady crept up our rear. I was actually about to shout for us to take our chances on a run when Mike opened fire. 

Previous experience told us that these things couldn’t be killed by bullets, but once the man on your right starts shooting, you’re bound to finish things together. I pulled the trigger, and as the sound ripped through the small room, a distant thought whispered *maybe we could hurt her just enough to buy us some time to escape.*

Of course, all false hope starts as a believable spark of optimism, and this ridiculous wish was no different. Mannequin Lady glided into Big Mike’s barrage of bullets with all the difficulty of a man walking headlong into a flashlight beam. But neither of us abated, not matter how obvious it was that we were going to fail.

Then she struck.

She went for Data first, apparently pissed that he had eaten her dead husband. She moved with the speed and silence that a shadow tip exhibits when passing car headlights race past. She slid through the air, and then Data flew against the wall so hard that it shook the floor. I guess she couldn’t ‘vampirize’ him a second time, so she left him whimpering in the corner. 

That’s the time that both Mike and I emptied our last clips, which brought the fear to a new level altogether. See, people can find comfort in the most dumbshit activities if it distracts them from the inevitable. Our particular desperate act was shooting, with all the efficacy of a trembling virgin freshman who knows he’s fucking up his first chance at getting laid but has no idea why, at something that couldn’t feel our bullets.

Mannequin Lady looked at me next. Her eyes were fluorescent pink, like Pepto-Bismol pink, which just made the hair on my balls stand straight up. 

“Mike, protect the girl,” I barked as she dropped her jaw eight inches and licked her white face with a forked tongue. 

“Mom,” the girl interrupted.

Just that one word. 

Mom. 

We like to imagine what great feats we might accomplish if only handed the time and place to attempt them. But greatness is only possible due to a very real counterpressure of cowardice.

At any rate, things happened too fast for me to act. Mannequin Lady was soaring toward me faster than I could brace myself, and then a tiny black flash collided with the white blur. Little Laney Vesely was rolling across the floor with her mother, having flown across the room to protect me. 

I could only gawk as I understood that the child was nearly as strong as the parent.

“STOP Laney STOP Laney STOP!” Mannequin Lady shrieked as they flopped over each other.

I realized that mother was *also* learning, in this very moment, how unexpectedly strong her daughter had become.

I can’t say for certain whether Laney planned what happened next, but I’m pretty sure I know. Her mother, taken completely off guard by the attack, couldn’t stop the rolling. 

Me? I could only watch as the two of them twirled into the bright patch of sunlight that now spilled across the center of the room. It washed over both of them as Mom screamed. 

Laney didn’t say a word as the two of them ignited. Mannequin Lady writhed and shrieked in a way that made me want to tear my eardrums out. 

But the little girl just curled into a ball as she burned to death.

In the end, no ashes of either one remained.

I cleared a path downstairs, pointing my empty M4 ahead of me in hopes that my bluff would scare any potential threats, as Big Mike carried Data on his shoulders like a sack of potatoes. 

As Fate would have it, everyone else was either dead or gone, and no one met me on the way down. We found a blanket to cover our friend as we brought him into the daylight. 

Plenty of people would have left Data behind, but we decided a long time ago that all three of us would live, or that none of us would.

We stayed in a shitty motel that didn’t ask questions about why two armed men with $1,913 were hauling a limp body under a sheet. Those types of establishments are more common than you might think, especially when you carry cubes of cash. 

I never went back to Jolo. More lurks on earth than we know, and the only way to stay indefinitely curious is to keep curiosity from becoming stupidity.

We still work together. Data’s condition was irreversible, but we don’t let his differences bother us. Sure, he’s a nocturnal bloodsucker, but he’s still our friend.

In our line of work, his tendencies are actually quite useful. 

And he’s the only of one of us who knows programming. He may be a vampire, but the guy’s smart as shit.

Movies like to show a triumphant climax because we don’t get that in real life. This wasn’t the end of my story – not by a long shot – but it’s how this particular chapter wrapped up. 

More often than not, we’re playing a background role in a story we’ll never hear. 

There’s not much else to say beyond this: the human mind can only bear so much. When someone returns from combat, the mind doesn’t always follow the body. Vets might be seeing and hearing things that no one else can, and in that sense, [hauntings happen every day](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).
