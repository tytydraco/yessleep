Two nights ago, my town got hit by one of the worst snowstorms in recent memory. We’re situated in the foothills of the Aleutians, so even though it’s early spring, this kind of freak storm is still largely possible. While the main village got about four feet of snow, the houses further up in the hills, like mine, got almost five.  
  
My wife and I, despite our best preparation efforts, lost power. I had a generator prepared but I couldn’t get some kind of housing built for it before the snow started. Luckily, we have a wood stove, or we might’ve frozen.  
  
I spent all of yesterday digging out our front porch so I could get out and hike into town for some supplies. By the time I was finished, about five in the evening, my shovel had broken and the sun was beginning to set. We had a small dinner and went to bed early, since we didn’t really have anything to do.  
  
Last night was rough. There’s something about the chilling silence of a power outage that’s made worse with the snow. We have a bright porch light, and there’s some lights on some of the telephone poles lining our road, but without these burning, there was nothing to keep the wildlife at bay in the woods lining our house. I could hear them as they made their way through our yard, first some elk, then a pack of young coyotes.  
  
There was one sound I didn’t recognize. The animal’s movements sounded like a bear, slow, crunching footsteps, but it didn’t make a recognizable sound. The slow, huffing breath of a bear was replaced with a hoarse rasping that almost had a vocal tinge to it. I got up and went to the window, but it had already lumbered off somewhere and I couldn’t see it.  
  
This morning, I threw on some snowshoes and tied a bit of rope to a palette that was left over from the chicken coop we built last spring. The walk into the main village is usually about twenty minutes, but with the snow it was closer to an hour. However, when I made it to the main road in town, I noticed something was off.  
  
What should have been a clear street filled with people shoveling driveways and sidewalks was instead just as filled with snow as my driveway. There were maybe ten people outside of their houses, and they were all huddled around something I couldn’t quite see. As I got closer, it became more clear.  
  
That something was a snowplow. It was tipped, partially on its side, completely lifeless. The men I’d seen were working in shifts to clear the road it had slid off of so that it might be set right again. Given the progress they’d already made, I didn’t have much hope that our road would be cleared for another couple of days.  
  
There were only two buildings cleared enough for entry, and those were the hospital and grocery store. Going into the grocery store, I bought the small list of items I’d compiled that morning as well as a sandwich for lunch, since it was well past noon already and I was unnaturally hungry. There’s a little cafe area off to the side with some tables, so I sat down there to eat.  
  
My wife and I had the foresight to charge our phones before the outage, and she called me while I was eating. I answered, but before I could even get a word in, she was shakily blurting out nonsense at a mile a minute.  
  
“Honey, slow down,” I said. “I can’t understand you.”  
  
“There’s something on the porch,” she sobbed. “It’s clawing at the door. I think it got one of the chickens. There’s-” she choked on her words. “There’s blood on the window. I’m scared. It won’t go away. I-”  
  
“Calm down,” I said in my most reassuring voice. We’ve only been married for about a year, but I can tell when she’s on the verge of a panic attack and when I need to intervene. “What’s on the porch?”  
  
“I-I thought it was a bear,” she breathed. “It should’ve been a bear. I wish it were a bear.”  
  
“What is it?”  
  
She choked on a sob again, audibly weeping. “I don’t know,” she admitted shakily. “It’s so tall. Tall and thin. I didn’t see much of it.”  
  
It didn’t sound like anything that would be in rural Alaska aside from a sick prankster with too much time on his hands. “Did you hear anything?” I asked her.  
  
“Breathing. Terrible, raspy, hoarse breathing.”  
  
My mind went back to the creature from last night, or whatever I heard. I sat in silence for a couple moments, trying to collect my thoughts while listening to my wife quietly crying on the other end. “Hide upstairs in the bedroom,” I said. “Lock the door. I’ll be home as soon as I can.”  
  
“Where do you think I am?” She managed a weak laugh. That was good, at least she wasn’t paralyzed from fear in harm’s way.  
  
After reassuring her some more, I left the grocery store and began my trek back home. It was almost two p.m. at this point, and the sun was beginning to set. Days are significantly shorter in Alaskan winter than they are in other parts of the states, and I only had about an hour of daylight to work with.  
  
I retraced my footsteps from earlier that day, but as I ascended the hill to our house, I couldn’t shake this feeling of a presence. Not like I was being watched, which almost made it more frightening. Whatever was in the woods lining the roads, it didn’t find me important enough to give me any attention.  
  
A hundred yards from my house, I heard a loud snap, like the break of a branch, coming from somewhere behind me. With the sky rapidly darkening, my nerves already on high alert, I didn’t even bother turning around. Somehow finding a new surge of adrenaline, I clumsily sprinted the final distance.  
  
She was right about the blood. The creature had smeared it all over our kitchen window, and I could make out a massive, four-clawed handprint of some sort. What really stood out to me was which chicken had been killed.  
  
One of our youngest hens lay on the porch, dead. We own a rooster. He should have sacrificed his life to protect the hens, but he didn’t for some reason. When I ventured over to the coop to check on the rest, I found them all huddled in the furthest possible corner, pressing their bodies as close as possible to the back wall. None of them were making any noise.  
  
After some unconvincing reassurance that the creature was gone, I managed to coax my wife out of the bedroom, clinging to me like a scared toddler. She’s always been somewhat timid, but this was a new level of fear I hadn’t seen in her before. Whatever that creature was, it had made a lasting impression on her.  
  
It’s dark out now. My phone’s running low on battery, but I need answers. There’s no wildlife matching the description my wife gave anywhere in this state, let alone our small village. I can’t imagine it would be anything other than a twisted prank, but my mind goes back to the horrible, inhuman breathing.  
  
The snow’s starting to fall again, and I can hear the animals approaching the house again.  
  
The chickens haven’t made a sound.
