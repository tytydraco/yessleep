Two nights ago, my small town got hit with one of the biggest snowstorms in recent memory. The main village got nearly four feet of snow, while houses like mine, further up in the hills, got close to five. In spite of our best preparations, my wife and I got hit harder than we expected. I'd bought a small generator, anticipating power outage, but it got buried rather quickly and we lost electricity nonetheless. Luckily, we have a wood stove, or we might've frozen.  
  
I spent all of yesterday trying to dig out our front door. By the time I did, around four in the afternoon, the sun was already setting, and my only shovel was broken. Without power, the plows unlikely to come for at least another day or so, we were essentially on an island.  
  
Last night wasn't much better. There's a lamp on top of the telephone pole at the bottom of our driveway, but since it wasn't lit, there was nothing keeping the animals at bay from our property. All night long, I tossed and turned, listening to the wailing elk and howling coyotes. A few of them ventured closer to the house, and I could hear their cautious footsteps crunching in the snow. There was one creature that got particularly close, and I could hear its heavy, labored breathing outside my window. If it weren't winter, I'd have assumed it was a bear, but now I'm not so sure.  
  
This morning, I put on some snowshoes and, pulling a ramshackle sled behind me, made the hour-long hike over the snow into the main village to buy some basic survival necessities. When I reached the houses that were near the outskirts, I noticed something was off. The main road that ran through town remained unplowed, almost untouched except for a couple sets of footprints leading out from a few of the houses.  
  
As I got closer to town, I deduced the problem. A lone snowplow was on its side, lying in the snow to the side of the exit ramp from the interstate. Five or six men were working to dig it out, and another three or so were waiting to the side to relieve them.  
  
One of the few buildings in town that was dug out to an extent was the small grocery store a few hundred yards from the exit. Most of the parking lot was still covered in snow, but a small area near the front door was clear and someone had packed down a kind of ramp leading down to it.  
  
As to be expected, the grocery store was almost empty except for a few more workers and two or three employees. After grabbing what I needed and checking out, I asked one of the men about the plow.  
  
"Ran off the road in the dark," he explained. "There's some nasty black ice under the snow. He was driving down the exit about 5 o'clock yesterday morning and just couldn't see it. I myself just got out of my house yesterday afternoon what with all the snow."  
  
"How bad is it up on the hill?" someone asked me.  
  
"Almost five feet," I replied. "Took me all of yesterday just to dig out the front door."  
  
There's a small dining area inside the store, just off to the side of the checkout. Seeing as it was about noon at this point, I bought myself a sandwich and sat down to eat. Usually, they didn't taste this good. Maybe I was hungrier than I realized.  
  
As I sat eating and watching the ominous gray sky, my phone buzzed with a text from my wife. Since she usually sends me an exact replica of my grocery list every time I go shopping, I ignored it until more started coming.  
  
"There's something outside the coop," the first one read.  
  
"The chickens are going crazy I think it got one of them."  
  
This winter we'd already lost two chickens from our original flock of ten. Selling eggs was part of our livelihood, and if we ran out of chickens, we'd need to buy more and raise those ones as well, which was an expensive process. I kept reading.  
  
"It's coming toward the house. I can hear it breathing outside the door what should I do?"  
  
The creature from last night returned to my mind. If it wasn't a bear, I had no idea what else it would be. If it was a bear, as long as she didn't try to interact with it she would be fine. I sent her a text saying I would be home as soon as possible and to stay upstairs away from the door.  
  
Packing away the rest of my lunch, I loaded up the sled and made the trek back home. Going uphill should've taken longer, but I was anxious to make sure whatever losses we suffered were minimal. However, upon reaching our house, everything was as quiet as I'd left it. Coming from the direction of the coop behind the house, I could hear placid clucking. Everything seemed normal.  
  
My wife was justifiably shaken, but after some time she calmed down and we had a light dinner. It's getting late as I'm writing this, and I'm running out of data. I'm not sure what I should do tomorrow. We have some elderly neighbors who definitely could use some help, but I don't know if I should leave my wife alone again. I think she's starting to come down with something, maybe the flu.  
  
As I'm writing this I can hear that awful breathing outside the door - slow, labored, raspy, deep. Hopefully it's gone again tomorrow because there's a lot to be done and the snow's starting to come down again. Hopefully they get the plow dug out soon.
