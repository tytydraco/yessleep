It's ironic really a dog bred to be intelligent meeting its end in such a foolish way.  This “puppy” was a 60 pound pitbull poodle mix. His face was split down the center with a gray strip and his eyes highlighted with white like he was a black and white comic depiction of Spider-Dog. Pegasus was a strong well mannered pooch whose tail was the most ferocious thing about him. Yet he was able to obtain tools and even spot a 10mm socket from a 9 and 11mm which to this day still amazes me. He was a loyal dog and in the end his loyalty was the end of him.

Daisy loaded up into her wood paneled station wagon filled with all the dorm room necessities, donated supplies and the thoughts and prayers of our small town. Sitting shot-gun was Pegasus. The look on his face was one of pride and excitement. He was ready to start their 1000 mile journey to their new home for the next three years. As we waved goodbye reminiscent of a newlywed couple driving into the horizon the spirit of the town was high and the tears that fell only lubricated the hope of Daisy bringing a little bit of fame to our small town.

              The drive had its issues Daisy had never driven that far away on her own but did not want to deal with another heartache of a final goodbye. By the time tears had dried she and Pegasus were singing along to the music, sharing various snacks and putting distance from there once only home. Pegasus always would hop in and out of the Dukes of Hazzard style. Not to be flashy, but because the car door didn’t work. Daisy always said it gives the car character and besides it was Pegasus’s seat. He had performed this act 100’s if not thousands of times but when Daisy parked outside of her new Dorm room she lowered the window and started to make her way to the trunk the series of events took a turn for the worse.

              The window didn’t lower enough and Pegasus in his excitement didn’t notice. As Daisy pulled the suitcase from the trunk she heard a yelp and a loud snap like two broom sticks in a sword fight. Dropping the suitcase she darted to the passenger side of the car Pegasus hung from the safety handle from that damned Yale collar. pushing the plastic fastener in she released him from his hook of disaster. 

Now I will stop here to explain that no Pegasus does not die. He was named after a godly gift afterall. 

Daisy's adrenaline leveled as she saw her beloved canines chest take shallow breaths pulling out her cell phone as passerbys started to surround her she found the closest Vet office that was open. Frantically emptying out her trunk ignoring the questions from parents and students she skillfully ran a thin sheet under Pegasus and lifted him into the trunk. Removing the tie downs from the top of the station wagon she carefully strapped him down so he would slide around. Then like seeing a green light she navigated the parking lot like a formula one driver making her way to the Vets as fast as she could safely.

 Upon arrival Daisy parked haphazardly, jumping out and throwing up the trunk eyes wet with determination and denial as she confirmed Pegasus was still breathing. Shallow but visible. Running into the office's waiting room with tears in her bright green eyes like limes pictured with the backdrop of bubbling milk. 

Her steps slowed and in three steps she composed herself.  Her entrance startled many a person and animal in that waiting room today.

"Excuse me ma'am?"

Daisy held up a finger signaling she knew how she looked. Calmly skipping to the front of the line the lady with her cat stepped aside. Daisy forced a thankful smile and looked at the receptionist.

"I'm sorry for the abrupt intrusion but sir, my dog is in my vehicle and he had an accident. His collar snagged on the Oh Shit handle in the car and I heard a snap. Please help his still breathing, please save him!"




The man turned pale and then turned his desk phone and the intercom crackled.



"We have a Code Black I repeat Code black all members are needed at the front immediately"



Now I'm not sure if it was from the adrenaline or the feeling of relief but Daisy collapsed to the floor and began to sob. Fumbling for the phone in her pocket she called home to speak to one of the few inspirations that didn't have a Nobel Prize or a Doctorate.

"Hey champ did you make it you're mom and I had a bet going you would take a pitstop and get lost in a--


"Its Pegasus poppa."


" We are on the way right now. Where are yall?"
 

Daisy's family made it to New Haven in record time rotating drivers and only stopping for gas and the bathroom. 

Daisy reluctantly returned to the dorms with her mother to check on her belongings. Luckily her RA was not only attentive she was also a dog lover. Daisy's belongings were placed as neat as possible on her half of her Freshman dorm. The other have fully decorated by an obvious horror fan. And there on the bedpost was the collar. 

Daisy darted towards her beloved pups noose and threw it in the trash. After a bit of review of her articles she begged her mom to return to the vet.  

We will return to the plight of Pegasus but, the old lady's warning should have been taken a bit more seriously.

Daisy's roommate with a taste for the macabre found the Grim Reapers failed weapon in the trash and thought the object would be perfect for her creepy looking old fashioned teddy bear. She felt the collar brought out his eyes.
