[First Date](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14e0ve8/my_bumble_date_ended_up_being_a_serial_killer_our/)

People always say queer relationships move quick, but going from “oh my god a severed head” to a double homicide is probably fast, even for that trope.

I saw a lot of comments in the last post asking how she got my address, which… yeah, that concerned me too, once some of y’all pointed it out. When I asked her, she took a while to text back, but eventually admitted she rifled through my wallet and looked at my ID, in case I was discharged but needed help getting home. I wasn’t sure I bought that explanation…

…But also, if she wanted to kill me, she could’ve done it while I was out cold on her couch, y’know? 

If I was gonna die, it would’ve happened already. So I decided to just go with the flow.

I got up around 7:30 and got dressed, something simple, nice t-shirt and shorts. Nothing high maintenance, it was a morning date after all. 

Chloe showed up around 8:50, knocking on my front door. I opened it, and saw her standing there with a bouquet and a basket. “Hey, sorry, I’m a little early, just didn’t wanna be late because of traffic, but uh. There was no traffic.”

I grinned a little and let her in. She was wearing a leather jacket over a crop top and a skirt, and she shrugged the jacket off, laying it across one of my dining room chairs. “Got you some flowers… you have a vase?”

“What person in their twenties owns a vase, Chloe?”

“Right, right. Uh…”

I chuckled and got a pitcher out of my kitchen, filling it with cold water and setting it on the table. Chloe smiled gratefully and slid the bouquet into it, wiping her hands on her skirt. 

I looked at the bouquet. It was a mix of blooms, most of them I didn’t recognize. Granted, I’m not a botanist, so that’s… most plants.

“Lilies of the Valley. Those pink ones are roses, the blues are Hyacinths, then those other white ones are Orchids.”

I blinked, and Chloe smiled sheepishly. “Google said those were the best flowers for an apology bouquet, so… Yeah.”

I just nodded as Chloe sighed and walked into the kitchen, setting the basket down as she did. From it, she pulled a loaf of cinnamon bread, some eggs, a bottle of orange juice, a bottle of champagne, and a small package of bacon. “You’re not vegan or anything, right? Your profile didn’t mention it so I figured not, but…” She trailed off, getting herself acquainted with where the pans and utensils were. 

“No, I eat pretty much anything. Not super picky.”

“Good, good. Let me just… yeah.” Chloe nodded to herself as she pulled a couple smaller bottles from the basket. “My mom used to make this killer French toast, I nabbed the recipe before she kicked me out.”

“What happened for her to-”

I stopped myself as Chloe stared at me blankly, before gesturing to herself broadly. “Right, sorry. Stupid question.”

She laughed, a light, airy laugh, before going back to preparing the food. “Same thing that happened with yours, I assume?”

“Uh… yeah. More or less. How’d you know that?”

She hummed a bit as she worked, looking over her shoulder as I asked. “Oh, just… a hunch. Not far fetched for people like us.”

“I guess that’s fair.”

She nodded and tied her black hair up in a bun before getting started proper on the food. 

We made small talk as she did, but the elephant in the room just kept sitting there. Eventually, she finished up the food, bringing two plates over to the table, beaming as she set one down in front of me. 

“Bon appetit, or whatever the French say.”

I chuckled as I looked down at the plate. Three pieces of French toast, some scrambled eggs and crispy bacon. It looked, and smelled, incredible. 

“Oh, one more thing…”

I looked up and saw Chloe approaching with a champagne flute in each hand, and saw the two bottles open on the counter. “Mimosa?”

I cocked an eyebrow and took one, setting it next to the plate. She sat across from me and started digging in immediately.

I watched for a moment, hesitant. She looked up at me, a confused look on her face. “You, uh… not hungry?”

“No, it looks great. Just, uh…”

“Emma. Do you think I’m going to poison you?”

“Well it’s definitely possible!”

She sighed. “If I wanted to hurt you, you were knocked out on my couch for like, half an hour. I promise the food is fine. I’d even go so far as to say it was pretty good.”

I sighed, and started to eat. It was incredible, the first homemade meal I’d had in a long time. Longer than I could remember. Chloe smiled as I ate, clearly proud that the meal was something I enjoyed. 

I was sipping on the mimosa when she started to talk again. Her hands were resting on the table, and she looked nervous.

“So… the big thing.”

“Yeah, the big thing.”

Chloe sighed. “Look, like I said, Ems, the guy was a bastard. He had something coming, y’know?”

“I’m not doubting that… just that… I don’t know how to feel about you keeping his fucking head in your fridge, dude.”

She blinked. “Yeah, no, that’s… fair. I don’t normally do that, promise. Just hadn’t had a chance to get rid of it. Needed to keep it cold so it didn’t start to smell.”

“That’s… a totally normal thing to say over breakfast.”

“Look, I’m trying to explain myself here!”

She looked upset. Not at me, necessarily, but just in general. At the situation. 

“Like I said. I don’t hurt good people. Only pricks like that. The ones who deserve it. They wanna demonize people like us, make us out to be monsters. You’ve seen the news, Emma. You see what people think about us. What they say. I figure, if they wanna make us out to be monsters, might as well give them a boogeyman.”

She still looked upset, but determined. I finished my drink and set the glass down, looking across the table at her. I didn’t know what to think. “How do you know all these people are… evil? What if they’re good people who just… say something fucked up once and then you kill them for slipping up? Or if they’re genuinely just ignorant?”

She scoffed. “You think I don’t trail them for a while? You think I take this lightly? I make sure they deserve it. I don’t want to hurt anyone who wouldn’t hurt me, if given the chance.”

She looked agitated, and I started to get nervous again. 

“These people, if you could even call them that, need someone to remind them that we won’t take this shit lying down. We’re not doormats, Emma. At least, I’m not. This is direct action. This is showing people that we don’t fuck around.”

She got up and started to pace, and looked over at me, her scowl immediately softening as she saw the concern on my face. 

“Ah, shit, don’t… Fuck.”

She took a step towards me, and I flinched. She recoiled as if I’d slapped her.

“Look, I… Like I said before, Ems. I really like you. A lot. I don’t wanna hurt you, in *any* sense of the word. Can I just… Let me show you, yeah?”

“I… what?”

“Come along with me. I’ve got someone I’ve been watching for days, I’m ready to move on him today. I’ll show you how these people are.”

Maybe it was the alcohol, or it was the typical overlooking of red flags, or maybe it was just the fact that this very attractive woman was talking to me, but I sighed and nodded. “Fine. Let’s go.”

She smiled, relief washing over her features. “Thank you, I promise you won’t regret it. Let’s go.”

We got in her car and I rested my head against the window, not speaking as Chloe drove us off towards a future crime scene. *What the fuck am I getting myself in to, here? This can’t be right…*

We drove for maybe twenty minutes, before parking on a street corner. “Alright, we walk from here. Car’s too loud.”

I blinked and nodded, getting out of the car as Chloe popped the trunk and got out, herself. She walked behind the car and retrieved a small, black backpack, slinging it over her shoulder. “Alright, it’s the middle of the day, so most people are at work. This guy, though, does nothing but spend his days getting into fights online while his wife does all the work around the house. She’s at work now, so the house should be empty besides him. Let’s go. Follow my lead, yeah?”

“Yeah, uh… alright. Ok.”

She smiled and shut the trunk gently, before walking down the street a bit. We were in a rougher part of town, most of the houses run down with overgrown lawns. The sky was overcast, typical for the Pacific Northwest, but it felt like Mother Nature was on to our plans, and decided to set the mood appropriately. 

After a five minute walk, we stopped in front of a run down, one story house. There was a beat up pick-up truck parked in the lawn, the grass growing around it indicating the truck was less of a vehicle and more of a lawn ornament. The living room window was open, and what sounded like the news was playing loudly, punctuated by a man shouting in agreement here and there.

Chloe rolled her eyes and gestured for me to follow as she slunk down near the ground, around the side of the house. We walked around to a side door that was left propped open and walked in. 

The door led into the kitchen, which was left in disarray. Dirty dishes piled high in the sink, stains on the floor and countertops, old food left to rot on plates on the kitchen table. The smell was overpowering, and I had to cover my mouth to stop my gagging from being audible. 

Chloe seemed unbothered, unshouldering her bag and retrieving a small  plastic case, about the size of her palm. She flipped it open and retrieved a syringe from inside, tapping it and pushing the plunger a tiny bit. “This should do nicely,” she whispered, before heading towards the sound of the TV. 

We stepped through an open door, into an equally messy den. The floor was coated in grime, most of the furniture covered in hair from what looked like a dog, although there had been no sign of a pet thus far. Sitting with his back to us in a recliner was a large framed man. His shoulders were broader than the chair he sat in, and in one hand he held a can of beer. On the TV, a middle aged blonde woman interviewed a man whose face looked too small for his head, and the large man in the chair was shouting and nodding emphatically.

Chloe rolled her eyes and moved closer to the man as I looked around the room. There was a second recliner, as well as a couch, all facing the TV. The fireplace had a small urn mounted on it, as well as some photos of a man and a woman, presumably this man and his wife. Another photo sat center, the pair of them with Donald Trump, all giving wide grins and a thumbs up. 

I scowled as I continued looking around the room, my blood chilling as I saw something next to the other recliner.

Chloe stood up and jabbed the man in the neck with the syringe, pushing the plunger down as his legs jerked, his hand seemingly involuntarily clenching around the can he was holding. He stood and whipped around, clutching his neck. 

I staggered backwards as he took a step towards us. His neck seemed to be dissolving in his hands, blood and skin running down his chest, along with small amounts of a white foam. His eyes were panicked, and he tried to take a swing at Chloe, but she easily sidestepped and kicked him in the back of his left knee. The man stumbled, falling and slamming his head off the edge of the fireplace. 

The room was quiet, save for the news, which had given way to an advertisement for hip replacements. I stared at the body of the man, in shock. Chloe was breathing heavily, with a huge smile on her face. She saw my look, though, and walked over to me, gently grabbing my face in her hands. 

“Hey, hey, babes, it’s alright, yeah? Look around this place, this guy was a bastard. He would’ve done the same to us if he had the chance.”

I blinked, barely hearing her. I weakly pointed to the other recliner, and she frowned, turning around.

We both, now, saw the familiar red baseball cap, resting atop a half drank can of beer. From down the hall, we heard a toilet flush.

Chloe’s eyes went wide as she saw this, and we saw a door open up down the hall.

A wiry man stepped out, wiping his hands on his open flannel shirt. “Hey, Frank, you might not wanna go in there for a while!”

He chuckled and stepped into the living room, looking down at the man we could only assume to be Frank, then at us. “Frank?”

His confused look turned to rage as he charged us, screaming things I won’t be repeating in text, here. Chloe turned and shoved me out of the kitchen door as he grabbed her by the hair. She let out a yelp as she was yanked to the ground, and I let one out as I tumbled out of the open door.

I quickly got to my feet, looking back inside, and then down the road. I could go… I could leave and wash my hands of all of this. I could leave this to be her problem. Clearly that was her idea, since she pushed me out here. 

But… I couldn’t do that. Not to her. Maybe it was stupid… No, it was definitely stupid. I sighed, shook my head, and steeled myself as I stepped back into the house.

The man had Chloe on the ground, a hand around her neck, one near his waist. “Gonna show you exactly what you bitches deserve. You little cunt!”

He whipped his hand up, revealing a pocketknife in his hand. I screamed as I ran towards him, finding a cast iron pan with one hand. With all of the rage I could muster, rage at myself, at Chloe, at this man, at his friend, I swung the pan, striking him as he turned to look at me. 

The man slumped over, clutching his cheek. “Oh, you stupid bitch, I’m gonna have my way with-”

I swung the pan again, and again. By the third swing I was crying. By the fourth, he had stopped holding his hands up in defense. By the fifth, he was no longer moving. By the seventh, not breathing. By the tenth, his brain was exposed beneath the bloody remnants of his skull.

I dropped the pan and stood there, staring, breathing heavily. I was covered in blood. Chloe stood up, gasping, and grabbed my hand, turning me to look at her.

I was crying, still. Shaking, those big ugly sobs when you know something is broken inside of you. Chloe wrapped me up in her arms and held me tightly, whispering apologies into my ear as she ran her hand through my hair.

Despite everything, I felt safe there. In Chloe’s arms, I could forget about the pair of corpses at our feet. Forget about her almost dying, and about being soaked in blood. It was almost nice.

She pulled back a bit, offering a shaky grin. She had some blood on her, but she wasn’t thoroughly splattered like I was. “I, uh… I didn’t expect you to… do that.”

I wrapped my arms around her waist, chewing on the inside of my cheek for a bit, thinking. “Yeah, I… wasn’t sure if I was going to either. But I couldn’t let you just-”

Chloe pulled me close and kissed me then, and I let out a brief exclamation as she did. It was nice, but…

“Hey, can we maybe save this for when we’re not… y’know… in a crime scene?”

Chloe laughed and stepped back, nodding. “Good point. Let’s roll.”

“Uh… shouldn’t I wash up?”

She shook her head. “Most of these houses should be empty, nobody around to see you. If you clean up, you’ll leave DNA evidence here, more than we already might have. We should bounce, ASAP.”

“Alright… Are we gonna leave these two for his wife to find?”

Chloe thought for a moment before shaking her head. “Nah, I’ll handle that.”

She reached into her bag and pulled out a rubber glove, pulling it onto her right hand, and grabbed the cellphone from Frank’s pocket. She turned it on, and hit the “emergency call” button.

Chloe held up a finger in a “one second” gesture as the operator spoke.

“911, where is your emergency?”

Chloe’s voice dropped at least two octaves, and she sounded like a totally different person. “Yeah, I’m calling to report a domestic disturbance, sounds like a couple guys getting into a fight or something. Real gnarly from the sounds of it.”

“Alright, and where was this?”

“Uh, oh, shit, I think one of them saw me, I gotta go.”

“Ok, well, please stay-”

Chloe dropped the phone and crushed it beneath one of her Doc Marten boots, smirking. She cleared her throat and nodded. “Right, we have to go, now.”

I nodded and we set out, making our way back to her car in record time. As we were getting ready to leave, we saw a cop car lazily driving to the location of the call. No lights or sirens, no speeding. 

I chuckled a bit. “That guy is… in for a shock.”

She nodded, pulling a black hairnet from her head. It had blended in so well with her hair I hadn’t even noticed it. “Yeah, he’s probably gonna really hate us when he gets there.”

For some reason, that really did it for me, and I started laughing hysterically. Chloe grinned as we sped away, and in no time we were back at my house.

Sitting in my driveway, she looked at me, concern evident in her expression. “So… Look. That did not go as planned. Normally things go smoother than that, and I’m sorry that you had to do that. Not exactly a… glowing endorsement of my hobby, huh? But… like I said before, Ems, I really like you a lot, so… if you’re not too freaked out-”

I held a hand up, and Chloe stopped, mid sentence. “Can we just… go inside and have a normal date day? We can, and will, talk about this, later. But for now can we just… be two normal girls and go have a good time together?”

Chloe nodded, smiling slightly. “Yeah, that would be nice.”

We walked back in, and being back home, safe, secure, and in my own place, never felt as good as it did then. 

“I’m gonna go clean up, but make yourself at home. I’ll be right back.”

Chloe gave me a pair of finger guns as I walked back into the bathroom.

The blood came off far easier than I expected, only a little bit of scraping required. After about ten minutes, I was good as new. 

I stepped back into the living room, but Chloe was nowhere to be found. “Uh… you still here?” I shouted, looking out my front window. Yup, her car was still out front.

“Back here, babes!”

I heard her yell from my bedroom. I grinned to myself and shook my head. I started to walk down the hallway, but as soon as I passed the slightly ajar door, I got a crop top thrown with impressive velocity at my face.

We spent the day together, not just in bed but just hanging out together. Being in her presence really has an effect on me. It’s definitely weird for a murderer to make me feel comfortable, isn’t it?

I dunno. All I know is that I didn’t want her to leave at the end of the day, but we bith had obligations the next morning. The kiss goodbye was bittersweet, but on the bright side, we’ve got plans to get together again soon.

Her last words before leaving were,

“Next time we hang, Ems, I got something real special to show you. You’ll love it, babes. Real [special.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/LobotomyTheatre/)
