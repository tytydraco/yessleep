As I drove through the endless expense of desert, all I could think about was this dilemma I’d forced myself into - Driving out to the middle of bumfuck nowhere for someone I hardly knew; for what, I hadn’t the slightest damn idea. 

To put it into context, about a week ago, I had been going through some of my old materials in the attic of my parent’s house, looking for anything that might retain its value. As I did, I pulled out some dusty envelope. It was, apparently, addressed to me. 

When I got the chance, I opened and skimmed it. The letter inside was, from my uncle. 

I never really knew the man all that well, only having met him once or twice when I was a kid. What I gathered though, was that he odd. He wasn’t a kook, but he was bizarrely quiet in the select times I had met him. The only thing I do recall about his personal background was that he was a scientist; though I never did find out what kind. 

The letter he had sent only perplexed me more. 

*Henry,* 

*if you have received this letter, I have long gone off the grid by now. I’m sure you’re wondering by now why I am writing to you, I am aware that I am essentially a stranger. However, I cannot trust anybody else with with this burden I’ve been carrying. I have been conducting my work at a cabin located in Carlsbad, New Mexico. I’ll need you to head there by August 30, 2024. I know I’m asking a lot of you; being as we haven’t had time to develop a proper relationship. However, I promise all will be explained in time.* 

*Yours truly,* 

*Carl Wilkinson*

Immediately my first thought was why, would he want ‘me’ to help me with..whatever this was. I hardly even knew the man and he just disappears, then he openly asks me to do a favor for him? 

Yeah..no. 

Yet, even then, I couldn’t help but wonder, who exactly was he? Unable to shake my curiosity, I asked. My mother told me that Carl was, eccentric. He was a quantum physicist, and believed in things that kept him shunned amongst the scientific community. That was all the knowledge I could gather at this time. 

You think I would’ve dropped it by now, I don’t know anything about this guy; let alone his motives. Though, part of me just had to know, why did he want me of all people? The weirdest part though, was that the date mentioned in his letter; August 30, 2024, was this coming weekend.

For a full day this was all that I could think of. Unable to really give it any rational thought, I ultimately decided to go. 

I had left the Wednesday prior as the drive to Carlsbad was roughly 20 hours, fortunately with few stops. 

I’d arrived in Carlsbad early in the morning that Friday. When I got to my uncle‘s place, it was an old cabin. Not exactly a shack, but nothing grandiose either. As I let myself in, I took a quick look around. The inside was, a little nicer than the outside. It was well furnished, there was a patio with an overlook, and there was a living room with some books and a television. 

On the living room table, though, was another envelope. 

I opened it to reveal another letter from my uncle. 

*If you have opened this letter, Henry, you have arrived on the time I had requested.* 

*By now it’s practically certain you’re still eager to know by now why I’ve summoned you of all people here. I’m aware I’ve always came off as bizarre to the rest of the family. I assure you, however, this was though no fault of my own. I’ve wished for nothing more than to have been able to spend more time with you. At the same time, this is bigger than all of us.*

*In my more than 40 years of scientific study, there’s much I have witnessed that many would dismiss as the delusions of a madman. I have entrenched myself in this ordeal at the cost of being deemed a lunatic by the scientific community. In the end, I was able to prove I was right. This brings me to why I have brought you here.* 

*Outside there is a cellar, where I’ve stored my research. I’ll need you to go down there, as there are several materials you’ll require. Take those materials, and head to these coordinates:* 

**32.195205, -104.357388**

*Be there at exactly the break of dusk. As for what’ll happen when you’re there, you’ll find out soon enough.* 

*Godspeed son.*

This still didn’t explain why I was here. But the coordinates he gave me, was there something he wanted me to find?

As I deliberated, I could hear a vehicle, pulling up into the driveway. 

I walked outside to find a white pickup truck; out of it stepped a man who looked like a park ranger.

“Mornin’ sir. You from out of town?”

“I’m visiting.” I replied. 

“This cabin belongs to my uncle.” 

Reassuringly, the man seemed friendly enough.

“Well this here’s a darn nice place he’s got. You just be on alert while you’re out here” 

His smile turned to a straight face. 

“Lotta folks been seein’ some weird looking critters as’a late.” 

“What do you mean?” I asked. 

“Been gettin’ reports from a buncha people of animals that, don’t look right. It’s regional too. Word is over in southern Cali they had a big ass gator crawlin’ around beneath Los Angelos.” 

I wasn’t sure what to make of what he told me, but I did recall hearing last month about a sanitation worker claiming to have been mauled by an alligator back in late May. 

“Ya’ll be careful now.” He said 

The man proceeded to get back in his truck and drove off. 

My priority was now back on the task at hand. 

I walked around to the back of the cabin, and there was the cellar my uncle had mentioned. I gently lifted the doors, and headed down the stairs. 

Once inside, I was immediately puzzled. The walls were covered in all sorts of odd papers and blueprints. There were arrows drawn with text accompanying them, bizarre sketches of things I couldn’t describe. In the back there was a small table, with a notebook, a handheld GPS, a flashlight, and a cassette player. No doubt the materials I was referred to. 

I couldn’t help pondering - just what was he studying? What did all of this mean? What exactly was waiting for me at the coordinates given?  Was he hiding something? It was apparent that, the only way to answer these questions was to go and find out as intended. 

I grabbed a knapsack laid out on the side, and stored each object within. 

Later that afternoon, I drove South for about 25 minutes. Eventually however, I had to pull off to the side of the road and head the rest of the way on foot. That was where the GPS came in. 

As I walked through the desert I made sure to keep vigilant. A wrong step could have me on the business end of a rattlesnake’s fangs. Still, I was on the clock, being that I needed to be there by dusk, at least according to my introductions. I covered ground as quickly as I could. 

As the sun began to set, it was heralded by the chorus of coyotes howling faintly off in the distance. Soon it would be dark, and nearly impossible to navigate through the brush. Luckily, I was getting close. 

The hike took about an hour and a half roughly, but I managed to arrive at the designated coordinates. When I did, there was a large, cave-like bluff, dark red in color. Sundown was soon approaching, and light was beginning to fade. Yet, I still had no idea what my uncle brought me out here for. 

Nonetheless, I sat down atop a rock, waiting for the sun to set. 

At one point my attentions turned to the bluff. I noticed something odd engraved onto the wall. 

I walked over to get a closer look, and recognized them as petroglyphs - a type of rock art found through the southwest, carved there by people hundreds, if not thousands of years ago. 

The art consisted of several people holding what looked like bows and arrows. At the center however, I, well, couldn’t exactly describe what it was. It almost looked like a giraffe, but more slender, and its head, almost looked birdlike. Some mythological creature perhaps? 

Soon enough, the red sun disappearing behind the mountains announced the arrival of dusk. Despite everything however, I still hadn’t a damn clue why I was here. 

Why the hell did my uncle want me to walk out to a rock in the middle of the desert, there had to be some reason. Then I figured, that perhaps the answer was in the notebook. 

I sat back down, and pulled it out. The first page was titled ‘recordings’, which obviously referred to the cassette. Below was a series of oddly drawn symbols, each numbered. The first one was some sort of spiral. 

Eager to know more, I pulled out the cassette player, and pressed play. 

*My name is Dr. Carl Wilkinson. I’ve spent several decades studying the concept of quantum reality; vigorously working to prove the existence of holes in space-time. In theory, every quantum event creates an entirely new universe, leading to a branching tree of separate realities. In said realities, every possible outcome of every event happens somewhere, as opposed a singular changing universe. I had believed, however, that there was more to it. What if there was a way to access these alternate worlds? Unfortunately, I was, for many years unable to receive funding, as the mainstream scientific community didn’t take my work seriously. I was a laughing stock, but that was soon to change. During my field research I had discovered an incredible phenomenon; one I had first come across through historical firsthand accounts from across the globe. The first site I traveled to was here in New Mexico in 1984, where I struck gold.*

I paused the recording. Something didn’t feel right. 

Several minutes ago I was accompanied by the sound of the wind, of insects, and the occasional coyote. But now..now it was dead quiet. Like, nothing at all. 

Like an explosion, it appeared with a bright flash, the surprise of which thrusted me onto the ground. 

I looked at this thing for a solid minute without saying a word, just starring at it in disbelief. The best way I could describe it was a bright, white spiral. The sound it emitted was electric, but almost like a wind chime. It just..floated there. 

Immediately I unpaused the cassette player. 

*I discovered a ‘gateway’, to another reality, one that tunneled through the fabric of space-time. I was right all along. I wanted nothing more than to stick it to those who deemed me a lunatic. I spent months out in the desert, in secret, studying these holes in space-time. But then..it stopped. After months the portals simply ceased to appear. Throughout the time I had studied them they would vanish and reappear on a weekly basis, but now, they were gone for good this time. All my work, my research, now seemed for naught. I wasn’t about to give up though. I spent the next two decades researching these anomalies; calculating their trajectories, reviewing local accounts, all in order to predict when they would reappear. Finally, this year, 2004, they’ve reappeared. It would seem these ‘inter-dimensional’ passages appear every 20 or so years in the same spots, for a total of about 7 months. Whatever I do next, I’ll have to act fast.*

There I was, standing before what was apparently an a portal to a parallel reality, not even seeming to care about the fact these recordings were 20 years old. If what my uncle stated in the recording was true, just what kind of alternate timeline did this portal lead to? 

Slowly I walked over toward it. As I did I could just barely make out something on the other side. Without thinking, I raised my hand, and reached out into the portal. Immediately, I pulled it back, reassured that there were no side effects of physical contact.

Without taking the time to think it over, I stepped through. 

When I did, I found myself at the same exact bluff, only..it wasn’t. 

It was covered in, grass, that covered the whole top portion of the rock formation. In fact, the whole landscape was different instead of desert, it was a vast open prairie with long, endless grass. There were sporadic trees, that almost looked like palms. Not something you’d find growing in New Mexico, though this wasn’t the New Mexico I knew. The only thing that appeared to remain consistent, were the mountains on the horizon. The time was also evidently different, as the sun was beginning to rise, when I had just witnessed it set.  

There’s no mistake, I had entered another timeline. But, what kind of strange, parallel world was this? 

Just then a soft rumbling began to sound. Within a few seconds it began to pick up in volume; the source of the noise originating from the other side of the bluff. 

I made my way past the vertical wall of rock, looking for an incline safe enough to walk atop. Fortunately, there was a slanted tract of hill that was manageable for me to climb up. As I ascended, the sound continued to pick up in volume. When I got to the peak, I’d ran into a most unexpected scene.  

There, stampeding across the open prairie, was a gargantuan herd of large, reptilian animals running on their hind legs. They were stocky in appearance, had long, rather stiff tails, and what looked like a straight, spoon-shaped crests adorning their heads. Each animal possessed a flat snout ending in a beak, from which some individuals let out a trumpeting bellow. 

There’s no mistaking it. These were dinosaurs. 

Immediately I reached into my knapsack and took out the notebook and cassette player. #2 was apparently accompanied by a sketch of what looked like the Earth. Wanting to know more, I wasted no time listening the next recording. 

*The first portal I had been studying was located in New Mexico, just south of Carlsbad. It would not be until about a month after its initial discovery that I had mustered enough courage to enter it, and when I did, I had stumbled into a world that was simply astonishing. In this alternate reality, the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction; which saw the end of 75% of all life on Earth, never occurred. In this alternate earth, dinosaurs continued their reign; evolving into a myriad of different forms. Many of the environments we’re familiar with are also drastically different. You see each portal opens up to the same location they appear; within the universe it leads to. Southern New Mexico lies within the Chihuahuan desert, though here, it is a vast grassland, comparable to the African Serengeti. In the absence of the Chicxulub impact at the end of the Cretaceous, many forms of plant life also remained unscathed. This led to the development of floral communities alien to our own. On land dinosaurs and other ancient lineages reptiles remain the dominant lifeforms. Mammals too, continued to diversify, but stayed diminutive in size. The exceptions living near much higher and lower latitudes, where the largest species grow to the size of dogs. In the absence of humans, the natural world has thrived, as it had since the dawn of life on this planet.*

Here I was, a whole world, inhabited by dinosaurs, no humans whatsoever. Yet, one question remained. What were my uncles intentions? Could it have been that he wanted me to come here? But if so, why? 

A frightening thought crossed my mind. What if he was stuck here? Was he somehow trapped in this universe for the last 20 years? If that was the case, then why write me a letter? Not to mention, if the portals appear in the same place every two decades, couldn’t be have just come back on his own? Why call me here? 

I figured, in order to answer these questions, I had to go out and look for him. Just how I was supposed to do that, I wasn’t exactly sure. For all I knew he could be on the other side of the globe. If he wanted me to find him though, he couldn’t have traveled very far. So it was reasonable to assume he had settled somewhere regionally. That narrowed things down, but I still hadn’t a clue regarding his location. 

My first thought was that if my uncle had settled here, he would need a place that would best shield him from potential hazards. For a moment I scanned the horizons looking for anything that would fit such criteria. Then at the foot of the mountains, I picked up on what was unmistakably a patch of forest. This was likely my best option, as the cover provided would be ideal. 

One problem remained though - after a while, the portals close. While my uncle’s recording did mention the portals appearing and vanishing sporadically, it’s impossible to predict when. Fortunately though, I didn’t need to worry about being trapped here for 20 years, as the portals would be active for another four months. The worst case scenario, would be that i’d have to wait a week, if I didn’t make it back on time that is. 

Soon I began my descent down the bluff, carefully hiking down the steep hillside. 

It took me roughly about an hour to get to the valley floor, and It was quite reassuring to be walking on flat ground again. The grass was about knee-high, but thankfully not difficult to pass through. 

Eventually, I came across a stream, where I quickly proceeded to cup my hands and drink. I must’ve drank several gallons worth,  clearly being somewhat dehydrated. Not having a canteen on me made the situation all the more complicated. After my drink, I settled down to the side. This seemed like an ideal place to stop for a bit. 

As I sat there, I looked over at the horizon, towards the forest, I couldn’t help but wonder - Could my uncle actually be there? Sooner or later I was bound to find out. 

Suddenly, my body began to vibrate. The best way I can describe it was a rhythmic wave of reverberating. It continued, but was then followed by a resounding bellow - almost like the song of a whale, only on land. 

I looked off in the direction of the noise to find to find its source, and there, striding off in the distance were several mammoth creatures. A group of massive, building-sized dinosaurs with elongated necks were headed in my direction. From where I was they were at least half a mile away, but even at that distance they looked truly monumental in size. 

In total there were 8, most them were a dark grey in color, but the largest one, was a darker shade of blue, with a red throat. As they meandered, the latter individuals’s throat expanded into an oval shape, letting out another haunting, yet bizarrely soothing call. The vibrations of which I could feel shaking me up.  

Come to think of it, the notebook had several symbols resembling dinosaurs. I pulled it out of my knapsack, and next to #6 was a sketch that resembled the creatures I saw. I pulled out the player, and skipped ahead to the 6th recording. 

*Seismotitan coloseus, the Plains Earthshaker, is the largest living land animal of this alternate world, weighing in at a staggering 80 tons. They are part of the sauropod family, specifically descended from the Titanosaurs of the Late Cretaceous period. Herds typically consist of 6 to as much as 15 individuals, yet only one is typically a bull; or male, controlling a herd of cows; females. Bulls are brighter in color than cows, and posses an expandable throat sack very similar to an anole lizard. Its purpose is communication, signaling to other individuals, be it mates or rival bulls. These herbivorous behemoths are typically placid unless provoked, but during the breeding season, bulls become highly aggressive, with dominant individuals fighting off rival bulls to defend their territory and access to mates.* 

I looked on in awe of the looming giants, striding across the plains. Even the smallest individual was still larger than an elephant. 

I would soon need to continue onward, but, given my uncle’s description, getting any closer probably wasn’t such a good idea. Best to wait for them to pass. 

Without warning though, the bull’s long neck shot right up into the sky. The cows soon followed, turning their heads to scan the horizon.  

It seemed obvious that they’d caught wind of me; the last thing I needed right now was my presence putting them on edge. However their attention was directed behind them. 

Something was wrong.. 

Over the hill, something large but frighteningly quick shot out, running toward the smallest animal. It tried to make a run for it, but its pursuer was lightening fast. 

The attacker, bipedal in anatomy lunged; clamping down on its victim’s front leg. 

It was jet black in coloration, with thick, armored scales lining the predator’s back, arms that were little more than tiny stubs, and a spiky comb positioned atop its short, but menacing jaws. 

Three more darted forward from over the horizon, looking to join in the fray. Two of them went for the other legs, while one went for the neck; attempting to drag their prey down. 

Abruptly, the ground beneath me proceeded to shake. Like a freight train, the 80 ton bull stormed over to the frenzy. Swinging its neck at one of the predators and knocking them into the air, sending them crashing into the ground. It kicked another one with its front leg, while warding off the other two. 

Soon the rest rushed over to join in, I could feel the vibrations from their footsteps as they did, and proceeded to form a defensive circle to protect their injured kin. 

The marauding predators were persistent though. They got right back up and began to circle the titans, searching for any openings to exploit; only to be met with angry bellowing and swinging necks. 

It’d looked like two sides were at a stalemate; but there was one more player coming to join the game. 

Rising out from over the hill, came the largest one yet. It was nearly three times larger than the others, stockier, and more grey in color. 

The menacing beast marched over to the fray, its attentions turned to the bull. Opening its nightmarishly large jaws, it let out a fear-inducing roar. In response the circle tightened their defense around their incapacitated comrade. 

The two frontlines sized each other up. Predators and prey, jaws snapping, necks swinging, each side determined to come out to on top. 

It continued on for a good 30 minutes, as neither party would accept defeat. The carnivores repeatedly circled, looking for a chance to strike. As I watched, I took out the notebook again, and next to #5 was a sketch that corresponded. 

I once more grabbed the cassette player, and skipped back to the fifth recording. 

*Thanatovenator umbrensis, the Death Drake, is among one of the largest predators on land at this time. They are descended from the Abelisaurids of the Cretaceous, a group of large theropods that dominated the food chain of ancient South America. In this alternate timeline however, abelisaurids migrated north, inhabiting what; in our world, is the American Southwest. Males can reach lengths of up to  nearly 30 feet in length, and can run up to 25 miles per hour. Females are larger, and more dangerous, sporting a lighter coloration. Their social structure is most comparable to Spotted hyenas, with a dominant female; or matriarch controlling a group of males. When hunting, the males will run down and weaken their target, in which afterwards the female will appear, and deliver a crushing blow to larger, more dangerous prey.*

The fight continued on. The earthshakers’ defense was seemingly impenetrable, but the death drakes wouldn’t my throw in the towel; continuing to test the herd for weaknesses. 

It wasn’t long before the alpha, the female drake, was beginning to loose patience. On several instances charging the herd, in hopes of intimidation, but to no avail. 

Then at one point, she stopped. Her head lifted to sniff the air for a moment…and turned to face my direction. 

I remember that stare..I felt it. 

The alpha barked at the others, rallying them. In a matter of seconds 5 monstrous carnivores were all approaching me. 

My heart began racing, how did they just now pick up on my presence? Then I realized, I could feel a breeze pushing up against me from behind - I was upwind of them. 

They were getting closer with each second, and I was easy pickings. I needed some way to throw them off my trail. 

With quick thinking, I dropped down to the edge of the bank that overlooked the stream; covering myself in pluff mud to mask my scent. I swiftly hunkered down, slowing down my breathing. 

Before I knew it a massive shadow hovered over the edge; casted from a set of deathly jaws. I could hear her deep, slow breathing. My chest felt like it was about to explode. As I lie there, I hoped, no, I prayed, she wouldn’t notice me. 

The alpha then let out another growl, and left, the males following. 

Without haste I let out a sigh of relief. That was way too close.. 

As I got back on my feet, I surveyed my surroundings; making sure the death drakes were truly gone. Thankfully, there was no sign of them. 

The earthshakers continued their journey across the valley, the injured one limping from its wounds. 

It was time for me to move on as well. I secured my belongings and resumed on my path toward the forest. 

I hiked vigorously through the grass, traveling upstream. I made sure not to stop for anything else; given time was of the essence, and I certainly didn’t want to be trapped here for a week. 

The rest of the way there was, honestly, not so bad. The sounds that accompanied me were admittedly relaxing to hear; namely the sound of the wind rushing over the endless grass. Several flocks of birds passed overhead, calling as they did.  

In the end, the rest of the way took about an hour and a half, but I had finally arrived at the edge of the forest, the stream continuing on into the trees. 

I hadn’t the slightest clue what dangers awaited me in these woods, but finding the truth was of top priority to me. 

I headed on in, determined to find what I was looking for, braving this unfamiliar wilderness.
