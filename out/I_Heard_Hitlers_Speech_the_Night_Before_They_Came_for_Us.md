The night felt heavy. The air clung to my skin. I couldn’t sleep. Outside, voices stirred. The window was open. Every sound crept in. I lay still. My eyes stared at the ceiling. The city buzzed below. It felt tense, like it held its breath.

Rallies happened daily. Crowds filled the streets. I watched them from the window. Their faces burned with passion. They cheered loudly. It didn’t feel right. Their joy seemed empty, like a mask hiding fear. The city felt alive, but wrong. It felt electric, ready to break.

Then the loudspeakers started. His voice came through.

Hitler.

I froze in place. The sound filled the room. His words wrapped around me. Sharp, commanding—it wasn’t just a speech. It was an attack. I stood slowly. My chest felt tight. The words became clearer now.

“We will rise,” he said. “We will claim our destiny. The weak will fall.”

The words hit like a fist. My heart sank. I had heard them before, but this time they cut deeper. His voice wasn’t asking. It was deciding. It promised something dark. The crowd below roared. Their cheers rose, blending with his voice.

I moved closer to the wall. I listened. His words filled my ears. They wouldn’t stop. The air thickened. My head felt heavy. My stomach churned.

Across the street, I saw them. Torches lit their faces. Their eyes glinted with firelight. They swayed together, chanting his name. They looked like shadows, not people.

My chest tightened. They weren’t just listening. They were obeying. They belonged to him now.

Boots stomped below. The sound rose up. It echoed through the streets. It made the walls shake. I stepped back from the window. My hands trembled.

I reached the door. My fingers slid the bolt into place. The lock clicked. It sounded loud, too loud. I leaned against the door. But his voice still came through. His words still clung to me.

“Be pure. Be strong. Be ready.”

I moved back to the window. I couldn’t stop myself. I peeked out again. The crowd had grown. More hands rose in salute. Their voices grew louder. They drowned out the night.

My heart pounded. Sweat trickled down my back. I thought of my neighbors. No one spoke anymore. The halls were quiet. Doors stayed shut. Warnings had stopped days ago.

I stared at the street. This wasn’t just a rally. It was something worse. It was a judgment.

I knew the truth. That judgment was for me.

The air shifted. A knock broke the silence. It was soft at first. My breath caught. The knock came again, harder this time.

“We know you’re inside.”

The voice outside was calm. Too calm.

“Open the door.”

My legs wouldn’t move. I froze. My eyes locked on the door. The knocks grew louder. They matched my heartbeat.

I thought of running. But where? The streets belonged to them. There was nowhere safe.

I stayed silent. My chest heaved. The voice outside spoke again.

“Come out.”

The words hit like stone. I stared at the bolt. It looked small, useless. I realized then—it wouldn’t hold. Nothing would.

The knocking stopped. Silence pressed down. I waited, my body tense. Then, the sound of boots returned. They moved away, down the hall.

For now, I was spared.

But I knew the truth. They would return. Next time, they wouldn’t [knock](https://ko-fi.com/s/a4411a8628).
