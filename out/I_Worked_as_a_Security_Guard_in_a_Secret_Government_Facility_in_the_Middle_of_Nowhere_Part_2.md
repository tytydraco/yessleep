Before I could call out to him, I heard a voice say, “Hello Michael, Welcome Aboard”

The person on the swivel chair had turned around to face me. It was the same alien whom I had first spotted while using the telescope. He was over 8 feet tall with an elongated jawline and a bulbous head that protruded backwards. He did not have a nose but a triangular slit in its place. 

But the most unique feature about him however was his eye. He had only one, and it was positioned vertically at the centre of his forehead. He looked older than the rest of his crew, and it was clear that he was the one calling the shots around here

“How do you know my name?” I asked him. 

He smiled and said “You humans like putting all your details out there in the ether. Right from your government records to social media, everything seems to be just a click away.” 

He was speaking in his own native tongue but an AI program in the background was simultaneously translating it into English. 

He was wearing a large robe with a logo of a bright sun and an eye at its centre. I knew I had seen that logo somewhere before, and then I suddenly remembered the telescope. 

I softly uttered the word ‘korelo’ under my breath, but he picked it. 

“That’s right” he said.  “I am Captain Korelo, and the telescope you found belonged to me” 

He then continued to speak. “I come from the planet ZX4. The telescope was my gift to the erstwhile American President when I visited Earth for the first time in 1969. In fact, I have visited earth many times over the decades. Little did I imagine that one day, I would come into possession of it again.”

He pointed his finger at the telescope they recovered from me, when I was attacked at Henry’s home. It was sitting on his desk now.

“So you are some kind of a diplomat? Are you here representing the government of your own planet?” I asked

“No. I am a private contractor. I come here regularly hoping to get a lay of the land. Study your species. Analyse your society, gauge how you people function as a collective unit, and to keep track of the developments being made in science and technology. It is an essential part of my job. So when I do finally get the green signal, I’d like to be prepared.” He said.

“Green signal for what?”, I asked.

“To colonize your planet, and take over your resources of course!” he replied calmly. 

I just looked at him in silence. 

Then Korelo continued, “You see Michael, even in my part of the world, politics is an inevitable aspect of life. As societies get more advanced, the masses begin to grow a conscience. They become more vocal about individual rights, liberty, the right to livelihood, and those sort of things. But it’s a conscience of convenience. They are always willing to look the other way, as long as they are not directly accused of being the aggressors.”

“But the need for new lands, and new resources is never going to stop on its own.”

“When you have the ability to terraform any planet to mimic the conditions of your own home planet, it becomes easier to colonise than to have to constantly fix, and maintain what is already yours. It also reduces infighting within us because people can now simply move to newer pastures and start afresh.”

“But somebody has to colonise to make that happen. And the governments in my part of the world are unwilling to do the dirty work. So they outsource it to people like me. This gives them plausible deniability, while I am also able to make a lot of money. Everybody is happy in the end.”

Korelo then went on to add, “Infact the committee had long ago compiled a list where it was decided to colonise planets in a set order. We extract and utilize the resources of one planet before moving on to the next. Planet Earth has been green lit for colonization now!” 

I could no longer keep quiet. I retorted back at him, “You think you can just troop in here with a few spaceships and take over our land and its people? To assume that there wouldn’t be any pushback from 8 billion plus people would be a gross underestimation on your part. We might not have your technological superiority, but that doesn’t mean we can’t put up a tough fight. We are not cavemen. We are nuclear capable. If we have to go down, we will take you down with us.“ 

Captain Korelo let out a soft chuckle. 

“It’s been over a week since my arrival on Earth. I have already informed your government of my plans. The ultimatum has been given. But do you see any pushback on the ground? The average guy is still going to work, picking his child up from school, kissing his wife before going to sleep. Where is this so-called fight back?”

“Do you know why that is? Because they can't! “

“Every major defense system has already been put under lock and key. The missiles won't fire, the fighter jets can't fly, the drones won’t take off and the nuclear bombs can’t detonate. So how will your people retaliate exactly? Are you going to take your machine guns, and start firing at the sky?”

Korelo waited for that to sink in, and then continued to speak, “Also, the governments are running scared. Because they know what happened in Russia. The Russian government tried to keep pushing their luck, and I let one of their bombs detonate. With that, all forms of pushback died down.”

“Infact, I completely control all your defense systems now! Only the commercial flights are up in the air, and they are being constantly monitored. But even that will stop after tonight”, he said. 

“What will happen tonight?” I asked. 

“Cleansing!!” Korello replied. 

“What do you mean?” I asked him. 

“When I visited Earth during the 90’s I was invited on a hunting trip by the then Australian Prime Minister. We shot and killed Kangaroos for fun. He said it was important to cull them to keep the population manageable. And that is what will happen to all you earthlings too. 

“You see, this way I can avoid complete extinction of a species. It is just bad optics and would rub everyone the wrong way. But culling…. now that is considered a necessary evil.”

“Over the next 24 hours, the population of the human race will drop to 10% of what it is now. The rest will vaporize into thin air. A piece of land will be earmarked for the survivors. The list of those who need to survive has been left for the individual governments to decide.” he finished off.

“Is that what you did to the scientists at the base? Vaporise them? “ I asked him sarcastically. 

He nodded. “ And I instructed my people to leave the skeletal remains of your security friend so that it sends a message to your government as well.“  he added snapping back at me.

“So doing the same thing to my cousin Henry, is you sending me … a message, is it?” I asked. 

“Yes.” he replied in a matter of fact manner.

My shoulders began to droop even as every fibre in my body was vibrating with anger. Then I finally asked him, ” What am I doing here Captain Korelo? Why am I not dead already?”

Korelo looked at me for a moment and then said, “You remind me of myself, Michael. What you are is an agent of death. You may not know it, and you may choose to disagree. But it is what it is.” 

“I am nothing like you!” I shot back. 

Korelo then flipped his finger, and digital copies of a police report began appearing out of thin air. It was related to the car accident I was involved in as a 9 year old. 

Korelo began speaking again,” You threw such a big tantrum when your dad did not stop by your favourite ice cream parlor that he was eventually forced to turn his car around to get you what you wanted.  That delay caused your family, and your cousin’s family to come face to face with a drunk truck driver. I don’t need to complete the rest of the story for you.” 

I just sat there in shock. He had managed to prick a raw nerve in me.  I had never shared that part of the story with anybody except the police officer who had interrogated me shortly after the accident. Not with my wife. And not with Henry either.

I was afraid he would shut me out of his life for good, if he ever came to know that I was in someway indirectly responsible for the accident. The guilt was just too much for me to be able to share it with anyone else. 

But Korelo was not done yet. He continued to plunge the dagger into me. “Your wife fell sick with cancer within two years of her marrying you. Your cousin wound up dead because you brought my business to his doorstep. Your security guard friend Joe ended up dead because he was forced to take on your shift. God only knows what else I will find out about you, if I keep looking.” he finished off. 

I couldn’t take this anymore, and I just wanted it to end. 

“What are you going to do to me?” I asked him.  

Korelo said, “You are worth a lot of money Michael. I am going to sell you to one of the research groups that study people like you. They will test your blood, analyze your DNA, and pick and prod your brain to understand every minute aspect of your life. Right from what time you wake up in the morning, to the kind of dreams you experience, to how you conduct yourself in different situations, to the kind of girls you like to date – everything about your personality and decision making abilities will be studied under a microscope. They will then create clones out of you to be used as a potent weapon in war strategy and espionage related activities.” 

For the first time, I laughed out loud at the bizarreness of it all. It was all just getting a little too much. 

And then I told him, “Captain, you give me way too much credit. I might be unlucky in life. But to say all the things you just did, is bit of an overreach. I am just an ordinary guy with an unremarkable life. There are a lot people like me out there.”

Korelo replied, “That may be true. But I don’t need you to be remarkable. All I have to do is put you in the orbit of people who can do remarkable things. And you will eventually figure out a way to bring them down - knowingly or unknowingly, wittingly or unwittingly.”

I just sat there, staring at Captain Korelo. He seemed to have gotten it all figured out, and was also quite smug about it. Nothing I say was ever going to convince him. I never liked him from the beginning, but now I truly despised him. 

Meanwhile, Buster had woken up a while back and was sitting next to me. He started wagging his tail when I looked at him. That really broke my heart. My fate was already sealed. I knew that. But I didn’t want him to have to suffer. 

“Do you want me to spare your dog?” Korelo asked me, smiling. I just stared back at him. I didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of saying yes, but I couldn’t hide the desperation in my eyes. 

He then pressed a button on his armrest, and a display popped up in front of him. He keyed in a couple of commands and started slowly turning a knob in front of him. A strange kind of sound suddenly emerged from nowhere. 

Buster immediately let out a loud howl and ran across the room. It was clear the noise was hurting his ears, and was an assault on his senses. He curled up in a corner of the room, and was howling in pain. 

I tried desperately to free myself, but my efforts were proving futile. Korelo was looking at me and Buster alternatively, and continued to slowly turn the knob. He was really enjoying the show. 

Buster yelped in pain. He was really hurting now. And my not being able to help him was tearing me up from the inside. At that point, all I could remember was Adam’s little note. I was desperate enough to try anything. 

I slid my little finger to the side while the rest remained on the armrest. I tried to use the pointed edge of the armrest to create a wedge between my little finger and the remaining fingers. And then I jerked my wrist as hard as I could in the opposite direction, and my finger got dislocated. A sharp pain shot through my body, but I didn’t care. 

By this point, I was simply hoping for a miracle. Almost expecting Angels to descend from the Heavens and save our lives. 

But Buster suddenly went quiet. And then, to my horror, his body began to seize. He started experiencing some kind of major epileptic fit. 

I looked up to see Korelo looking equally surprised. Then his expression changed. 

It changed from surprise to shock to complete panic. 

He started screaming “No ….. no …..noooo!!!”

As soon as he uttered those words, I saw the lights around his spaceship begin to flicker. The first to go was the giant display in front of us. 

And then in a matter of seconds, the entire spaceship was plunged into complete darkness.

The resulting silence was only punctured by Korelo screaming a barrage of instructions to his panic stricken crew. 

The power came back a few moments later, and I saw Buster motionless on the floor. He had coughed up blood and was lying in a puddle of his own vomit. 

A reservoir of anger was building up in me, and I wanted to just explode. I looked up to see Korelo. But he was busy living his own version of hell. 

His gaze was completely fixated outwards. I turned around to look outside and could see two spaceships at a distance floating mid air. They were no longer invisible. 

“ You … you are responsible for this. What did you do?” korelo yelled with his finger pointed at me. 

I just sat there stupefied, and completely clueless. I genuinely didn’t understand what was happening around me. 

“Look. Look at that …” he said pointing to Buster’s little puddle on the floor. 

And then I noticed it for the first time. There was a small black ball lying in his vomit and it was emitting a blue light from within. 

“Where did you get that?” he asked me sounding really furious. I just gave him a blank expression. 

Korelo was then alerted by his subordinate about a new problem. A ballistic missile had been fired, and was headed straight towards the spaceship. 

He began giving instructions to his crew. I could sense they were preparing to flee. But the spaceship struggled to lift off. It simply didn’t have the required thrust anymore to get it done. It went a few feet high up in the air, and then dipped back again to its original position.

Whatever happened to Buster seemed to have somehow severely messed up their technology. I didn’t understand how or why, but I continued to watch, fully riveted. 

Korelo then issued a new set of instructions to his staff. I could see from the screen that a large force shield had been deployed around the ship. It somehow managed to contain the attack by the missile. 

But I wondered for how long they would be able to keep this up. They were sitting ducks now.

And then, I could hear a very familiar noise ringing in my ear, and my suspicions were soon confirmed. The fighter jets were also back in action.

I could see an F35 hurtling through the air headed straight for the ship, ready to take aim. 

Korelo’s crew shot at it, and it went down in flames. But more were on the way. It was only a matter of time now. 

Korelo sank back in his chair. He was just staring at me. His single eye looking vacant and lost, struggling to come to terms at how things were suddenly crumbling around him.  And like I was somehow the reason behind his current predicament. 

As much as I was enjoying the show, frankly, I thought he was giving me way too much credit. 

All I did was lean back in a large comfortable chair and bust my pinkie! 

And then he uttered the words “ Get out!”

“What …what did you say?”I asked. 

He rose from his chair, looked me in the eye one final time, and said, “Get out. Get out before I change my mind”. He then turned around and walked back to lead his crew. 

Right at that very moment, the handcuffs came off.  I was no longer confined to the chair. I got to my feet and scooped Buster off the floor with both my arms. I was relieved to find him still breathing. 

And then I was blinded by a sudden flash of bright light. When I opened my eyes again, I was back on ground level in the hot Nevada desert. 

I turned around to look at the spaceship. It was atleast 10-15 miles away. By now, multiple fighter jets were swarming around the spaceship like bees obsessed with honey. The government was clearly throwing everything at them. 

“That’s good. He had it coming!” I thought.

I kept walking forward carrying my dog in my arms. At a distance, I could see a car parked in the middle of nowhere. 

Then it started travelling towards me. When the car got close, I was kind of relieved to see Adam behind the wheel. They had come all the way to watch and enjoy the fireworks.

I bent over the window, pointing my finger at his brother, and asked Adam, “Is he an alien too?”

Adam laughed and nodded. He then told me to get in the backseat.  His brother poured a glass of water and mixed some kind of pill in it. I could see Buster getting much better after drinking it. He also nudged my finger back into its place, and bandaged it well enough for me to get it looked at by a doctor later. 

I was then asked where I wanted to go. 

“St Marys Hospital please”, I said. 

During my drive back, I gave them a recap of what happened in the spaceship. I also got answers to a lot of questions that were bothering me. The twins were part of a Universal Collective that was formed to combat private players like Korelo. So they settle down on various planets that are vulnerable to such attacks, and help local governments as and when required. Their motive is to provide technological and strategic guidance. 

This brings us to what happened to Buster in the spaceship. The ball which he puked on the floor was their technological version of an EMP device. It has the ability to severely cripple defense and aviation systems. But it can be activated only within the confines of a spaceship, and not from the outside.

So the device is designed to lay dormant and be virtually undetectable in such a state. And it can be activated only at a very specific frequency, right down to the decimal level. The chip that could emit such a frequency was inserted in my hand with a syringe gun. While the EMP ball was stuffed in a muffin, and fed to Buster by Adam’s brother. 

“But how did you know that Buster and I would end up in the spaceship?” I asked.

“We didn’t. It was only one of the many contingencies we had going on at that point. But to be frank, we never thought it would work either. It was too much of a long shot.”

“But Korelo has always been a greedy person. For someone who is already raking in the billions, he often gets obsessed with making the odd million here and there. So I am not really surprised he took the bait” he said. 

Then he continued, “In many ways, you earthlings are lucky. In other planets, when the locals did fight back and win with our help, it came at a heavy cost. People like Korelo are very hard to beat in a one on one battle.”

I nodded. We finally reached the hospital. I thanked the twins and waved at them as they drove away. When I entered the hospital, it looked as busy as ever. I walked through the corridor and entered Jessica’s room. She was awake and watching TV. She looked weak but smiled when she saw me.

“What on earth is going on? Is any of it true Michael?” she asked me. 

When I looked at the screen, I could see people were wild with celebrations. All the spaceships had gone down, and the pilots of the fighter jets were being hailed as heroes. The government had already declared it as the greatest victory of mankind. 

I just pulled up a chair and sat next to Jess. 

I don’t know what the future holds for the two of us. She stills has to fight and win her battle against cancer. But I was just feeling grateful to be able to be seated next to her at this moment. I took her hand in mine and just smiled.
