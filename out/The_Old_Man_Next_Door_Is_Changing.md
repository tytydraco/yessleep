My boyfriend let's call him Dan, and I moved in about four years ago. Our house is set on a main road and butts against a nice neighborhood. Most of our neighbors are a bit older and keep to themselves. Not many people have fences because most of them respect the property lines and stay in their own yards. Then there's the old couple. We don't see the wife too much, but the old man is a pretty typical boomer. Old, white, angry, has some money, wears a bright red hat. Sometimes I can hear him yelling on the phone when he's on his porch.

Their property has a downward slope into ours. The edge of their back yard sits against the side of ours right near our back door and porch. There's a large maple tree near the edge of their property line. The squirrels love to run around in it, and it turns a beautiful, burning yellow in the fall. He loves to be in our yard. All autumn he's out there at least once, but usually multiple times, a day raking leaves. Now, I get it. You may be thinking "He's just trying just trying to be nice and get the leaves from his tree out of your yard." I would agree if he would talk or even make eye contact with Dan or me.

Over the last four years, it's gotten worse. At first, he did what I think most would consider a normal amount of gathering leaves. Maybe once a week and mainly up around his house where it affected him more. Each year he has moved farther down. I would have also thought he was just being considerate if he didn't spend three times longer in our yard than he did his own. He doesn't even rake like a normal person. He drags his huge recycling bin around. He'll pull it down the hill, slam the lid open, rake a square yard, and slam the lid closed again. He moves the can about three feet and repeats this over and over.

Last year, he started raking halfway through our yard. This is *close* to our back door. He'd gotten as close as ten feet away. As a woman significantly younger than him, it was creepy and invasive. I work from home, so I'm near the back door a lot as it's in our kitchen. I had tried polite, simple ways to deter him. He did not take the hint. I finally had it when he ran over some of my plants. I told him "Thank you, but we do not need you in our yard. We can get our own leaves." He didn't really say anything. I don't think he made eye contact with me even then. This was the end of last fall, and I hoped that would put a stop to it.

Then this autumn came around, it was no better. Things have gotten disturbing, to say the least. There are too many regulations to easily and quickly put up a permanent fence, especially when you have an entitled neighbor who would probably throw a fit. I decided to take some bricks and stone we had around and laid them out just a bit onto our side of the property line. The first time he saw it, he stopped and stood for a few seconds, staring at my new project. He was less than thrilled but did not try to pull his bin over the bricks and stone.

I don't know if this timing was a coincidence or not. He'd gotten weirder. He would rake along the property line and usually leave the rest of his yard untouched. The clocks just changed a few of weeks ago and h started to come out around 4:30 in the evening, when it's starting to get dark. He had retired. The two of them didn't leave the house a lot. Part of the reason we wanted him out of the yard was so he didn’t fall and break a hip on our property and sue. He wasn't in great shape as he must be around 80. I've seen him slipping a bit on the leaves sometimes. He was not fast or quiet as he moved around. Even more unsafe and unusual that he was coming out when it's getting dark. We'd seen him out until 6:00 when it's full dark, still raking.

At least the bricks were working. They did do a good job of limiting how close he could get to our house. I thought it would be harder for him to see in, until things got less invasive and way weirder. Dan and I heard a commotion one evening last week. Of course it was the old man, trying to pull his bin over the tree roots in the dark, right against the line of bricks. We both watched for a minute. Why was he this way? Now that he was out of our way, he was really only inconveniencing himself most of the time. Dan left but I stood in the dim kitchen a moment longer. Only the small light above sink was light so it was easier to see out. We frequently had the back door open with only the screen door shut so our cat could see out. I reached out to double check it was locked. It rattled the door, and the old man whipped his head around to look at the noise. His eyes flashed against the faint light, like an animal. I jumped back a bit. I tried to rationalize, but he didn't wear glasses so that had to have been his eyes that shone in the dark. He quickly scurried up the hill, pulling the bin behind him. He moved without tripping and swiftly made back to his house. I had never seen him move so fast.

I told Dan what I had seen. He told me it was just a trick of the light. I told him that old guy was not nimble enough to get up the hill like that. Dan said he must be getting used to walking through the leaves. I didn't feel much better and uneasily went to sleep that night.

The old man did not come to stand by the property line for a couple days after that. I nervously hoped that I had spooked him and he would keep some distance. There's a stray cat, Louie, I'm trying catch and I hadn't seen him either. I went out to look, and he was under the deck. I took some food out and called him. Stepping back near the door, I crouched down and waited. He's not very trusting but he will sit and eat if I keep my distance. He wasn't coming out. I called him again, and he would look at me and then back out to the yard. There didn't seem to be anything there, just the crunchy leaves rustling a bit in the breeze. Louie still wouldn't come out. We both heard a branch snap loudly and I stood back up. He took off towards the back and opposite side of the old couple. My eyes hadn't fully adjusted to the dark yet and I strained to see. It was louder than any stick the occasional raccoon, opossum, or sunk could break. My eyes shot up to some barely visible movement. It was the old man. He was in the tree, and he was looking at me. My breath caught in my tightening throat. I fumbled for the doorknob and backed inside. From my view in the kitchen, I could see him slinking behind the trunk of the tree and then he was obscured by a bush. I didn't hear anything else. No branches, no leaves being crushed. I shut the storm door forcefully and locked it.

What the fuck was that? My heart pounded against my ribs, and I struggled to regain my breath. Dan got home a short time later and found me still sitting against the back door. While he seemed disturbed by this new development, I don't think he really believed me. It did sound crazy, but he hadn't seen it. I haven't been able to forget the deeply shadowed figure of the old man watching from ten feet up a tree, knees crowded up by his head and arms bent at unusual angles, eyes still shining. Then scurrying behind the tree, fully into the darkness. I eventually fell into a fitful sleep.

I woke up to the alarm at 7:00 the next morning. I laid in bed, head pounding after a night of shitty sleep and a few shots the night before. As I was willing myself to get up, I heard the banging of the recycling bin. That got me moving and I peered out the bathroom window upstairs. Both of them were outside. The old man getting the leaves and his wife with the lawnmower. He looked normal, but I knew what I had seen the night before. Before Dan left for work I tentatively stepped out to fill the bird bath, heart in my throat. They both acted like everything was normal. The old woman briefly glanced over at the movement and the old man continued his raking. Dan left, and I apologized to my cat because there was no way in hell I was leaving the door open.

Despite my nerves, it was an uneventful day. I spent most of it going over my options. Who would believe me? Dan didn't think it was true. He probably thought I was having some kind of mental break. That really ruled out any of my few friends listening to me. My family didn't live close enough to worry them about this. What would the cops say? Probably that he was allowed to be in own tree. That was true, but an 80-year-old climbing a tree at night was not normal. That evening when Dan finally got home, he told me he had another business trip coming up. It was just a state away, so he wasn't given much notice. My stomach churned at the thought of being alone all night. I decided my best bet was to try to ignore it, at least until Dan had left and returned. The old man had stayed in his yard lately, so no going out at night. I'd keep the door shut.

Another couple of days passed. I stuck to the plan and Dan prepared to leave a few days later. I could tell there was something he wasn't letting me know. Reluctantly, he admitted the old man had been out very early the last couple mornings before the sun came up. I was a heavy sleeper, and it hadn't been enough to wake me up. I was frustrated that he delayed telling me until right before he went on his trip. It's not like there was anything I could do about it anyway. Dan stayed in bed, so he never saw what the old man was up to. He asked me to keep in contact and stay safe. We said our goodbyes and he was off.

While it was daytime, I decided to check the bird bath again and fill their feeder. I would keep an eye out for Louie, but unfortunately, he would have to fend for himself for now. It was peaceful outside at that moment. Fall breeze, crunchy leaves, birds calling, a neighbor’s dog out enjoying the sun.

The evening brought a cold snap. Although you couldn't see our driveway from their house, it's like the old man knew when I was alone. Though I had resolved not to look out at night, it was hard to ignore the creaking of the deck boards once I took Merlin back to bed. Even though the curtains were closed, he did that awful thing cats do. The one where they suddenly lean to look behind you, ears flattened and eyes wide, only to return to normal when you try to see what they were looking at. I woke up overnight. Merlin was behind me. He had shoved through the curtains and sat flicking his tail around. His low growl was what woke me. I had to look. Holding my breath and trying to keep the bile from rising up my throat, I pulled the curtain back. Merlin returned to normal. There was nothing there, at least no animal or person. All that was there was a fogged area on the window. Like someone had stood there, hot breath from their nose condensing against the chilled glass. I shut the curtain tightly, pulled Merlin to me, and turned on the tv for some noise. I didn't sleep the rest of the night, but there were no more noises.

Well after sunrise, I finally looked out. The world largely looked the same. Birds waking up, the traffic getting heavier, leaves scattered on the deck. Except the ones under the bedroom window were crushed into dry pieces. I had hoped I dreamed of the fog on the glass. I only had to make it through one more night until Dan came home.

Once again, the old couple stayed away all day. I actually hadn't seen the old woman since Dan left. As darkness fell, my nerves perked up. The neighbor's dog barked in the background. I was on edge, trying not to look through the kitchen window as I made dinner. Full dark came quickly and with it, new noises. Even with the door and windows closed, they were getting harder to ignore. Whatever it was, it sounded disgusting. Loud snapping, crunching, a sickly gurgling-slurping sound. One by one I shut the lights off. I forced myself to wait few minutes and crept up to the door. Slowly I was able to open the door without much creaking. I had just enough room to crouch and slip my head between the two doors. As my eyes continued to adjust, the picture started to become clear even if my mind didn't want to see it. It was the old man. He was huddled beside the bricks, hunched over them. Something was laying on top of them. As I listened to the stomach-turning noises, I saw it was the neighbor's dog. The old man was digging though it's midsection, pulling organs and sinew up to his face, intestines and tendons disappearing into the blackness of his mouth. I sat, heart hammering, pumping so fiercely it threatened to make me lose consciousness. Blood poured over the bricks, turning them a shining black in the dim light of the moon. It flowed down the old man's neck, soaking into his thin t-shirt as he continued to crunch and slurp. His gut distended as he hollowed out the poor dog. I recoiled when Merlin jumped onto a chair behind me. As I turned back to the old man, his shining eyes were on me. He let out something between a hiss and screech, blood and bits of bone catching in his throat distorting the noise farther. Silent among the leaves and sticks, he traversed his way up the hill, all four limbs bent unnaturally.

The neighbor that had the dog must have heard or seen something. It’s the only thing I can think of as the red and blue lights bounce between the houses, dissipating as they make their way down the hill.  It must look like an animal attack out there. I’m sure as fuck not going out to check. I can’t see a point if, even the police come down here. Who would believe an old man could do that?
