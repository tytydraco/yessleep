Some say it marched out of the sea under a bloody moon, here to expel our town of all hope - a monster to punish the naive prospectors of Maple Oaks who spent their gold on false witch hunts; an avenger of the young women burnt at the pyre, drowning the land for rebirth. Others say it was summoned within the forest, rendering a body of shimmering water an ancient gateway. Not a monster, but a deity from a far-off pantheon to be used as a tool for occult ambition. It brought unrivalled life and good fortune to the woods and its creatures, warping the trees into divine guardians.

I think it was just a man. An affluent founder who built our mines, our port, and, over time, fabricated fables around his locale, concocting utter, fictitious folklore bullshit with the natives that would live on through a local museum.

And his descendants would follow suit, using fiction to hide the truth.

For most of the history class of '85, such fiction ended there - ambitious nonsense about our home's origin, with awe-inspiring malarky attached.

But for Ebony.

Oh, sweet, perfect Ebony.

A switch had flipped in her mind, and an obsession with uncovering the town's secrets had taken hold. Some ancient remnant of this 'thing', whatever it was, must linger somewhere out there, in the woods or across the shore.

Legends need some grain of truth, right?

As the sheriff's daughter, Ebony had every resource and privilege any eager sixteen-year-old could need to hunt local myths.

But, for as keen as she was, her father still set borders. Go dig up the beach and explore the woods, that's fine. But don't go too far out, don't go at night; don't go alone if it can be helped. And, like any spoiled rotten teenager, Ebony ignored all parental guidelines.

This was her quest; she was invincible.

Under the guise of the moonlight, 2 days after she hadn't returned home, by the oldest lake, they allegedly found her slumping out of the ground from where she'd buried herself in a burrow. Her legs were clawed-up and gnarled, her clothes torn, her body broken; whether she had tried to dig herself to safety after being attacked by wolves, or they came upon her while she was unearthing the mystery that lay under the dirt, remained unknown.

For a time.

'Rules' began soon after the story broke, enforced by a grief-stricken sheriff. Beyond a threshold, the woods are forbidden. Period. Yet it didn't prevent whimsical boys and girls from investigating the tantalising, freshly rumoured legend whispered quickly through the halls: Ebony's ghost haunts the forest.

Go at night, go to the lake, and you'll see the distraught phantom of a girl literally killed by her curiosity - still trying to uncover her mystery.

So they instilled a curfew. As the sun dips behind those looming, timeless hills, notoriously unkind officers of the law patrol the streets to ensure no more wayward youths trek into the foliage. And for 30 years, for every family and every home, that same curfew has remained. For those same 30 years, Ebony's story has warped and demented itself beyond recognition as another generation learns of our nocturnal, ritualistic tradition; as another generation questions what she thought she'd found to warrant wandering that far into the wild, in the dead of night. Had she seen anything at all? Or, alone in the woods, had *something* found her, and if so... was it still out there?

I was a part of the latest generation, absorbed by the gospel of the potentially abducted, lured, murdered, raped, cult-recruited, tree-fucking, or whatever sort of stupid girl she was 3 decades ago that made nightly outings impossible.

I was a child when I first truly noticed the odd, sacred hush that descended over our home - my tyke brain finally acknowledging that our life wasn't typical.

"Inside Autumn. Light's getting low." Dad had called from the porch as the sun began its lazy bleed into the mountains.

I sat in the kitchen, swaying on a stool, as my usually chipper mother locked every door and drew every blind, offering an occasional peek into the dark - her lips pressed and her eyes narrow as her stoic husband stared at the clock.

"Think they'll hit the street early again?" He asked her.

"Not likely."

Confused, I asked them both, "What're you talking about?"

My father looked at me, understanding that his little girl was now sentient enough to question what he found familiar, while Mom continued her routine checks.

"Come here, kiddo," he said, ushering me to join him by a window. "I'll show you."

Through the curtain, I saw porch lights flicker awake down the street. Neighbours called or forced their kids home with a frantic sharpness, and then, way off up the road towards town, the low growl of a car engine began - silent red and blue and purple headlights weaved between the trees, reflecting off closed windows where curious eyes met it.

"See that car? The lights?" Dad asked.

I nodded.

"A good, honest man drove one just like it... once. He kept people safe. Until one day, he lost someone very important to him."

"Did he find them?" I asked him, too young then to comprehend the cause of this rooted, collective script we recited.

A little lump formed in his throat. "He did, but-" He tossed the words around in his head. "They'd uh... gone to Heaven."

"Like Aunty?"

"Yeah-yeah, like... like Aunty. And soon after... he went to Heaven too. So now, that car and others like it, every night, carry on what he did."

"Keep us safe?"

"Exactly. They keep us all safe."

Mom muttered something profane to herself in the hallway; Dad, ignoring her, continued.

"But to do that, we gotta stay inside. They get grumpy if we get in their way. Understand?"

I nodded, slowly, as another voice spoke from the stairs.

"Do you see her?!" Sean, my delinquent older brother, who noticed, questioned, and listened far more than I did, asked our Mom.

"*Sean*." Mom hissed, finally satisfied that our home was secure. His eager eyes scanned the room until they met mine, and a wave of embarrassment washed over him.

"See who?" I asked quickly.

Dad moved to block my vision as Mom yanked Sean to one side and spat harsh, but heartfelt whispers into his face. Peeking round his frame, I could see the two enter a heated argument of both passion and resentment.

Dad moved my face to meet his, "You'll catch on when you're older, Autumn."

And older, I became.

I would come to learn that evenings belonged to the woods and whatever they held, but in our house, that created more wonder than dread. Sure, there was an unspoken caution, a yoke around our necks, but my parents never pushed panic or horror. Instead, their warnings glimmered with something closer to mischief - something my brother adopted far more than I did growing up.

As the routines were finalised, and I came of age, Mom would click the kettle, and Dad would lean back in his chair to recount stories he called 'old myths'. Stories of monsters from the sea and of Gods from the woods, and whatever other fables or fairytales he could remember.

Stories Ebony had told him, before she became one herself - a naive adventurer found half-buried in the earth.

Sometimes, I'd catch a glance between my parents - sharing knowledge, a private joke or insight once hovering beyond my reach.

They'd known her. They'd shared classes. They'd snuck out to go drinking in parks and smoke joints by the lighthouse long after dark.

They'd loved her.

And by God, they missed her - fascinated and frustrated and mortified by her decisions that night that shaped our town into what shaped us.

Sean started to keep a notebook, scribbling down half-remembered details, little theories of his own, the finales of stories that never felt quite finished. I thought it was silly, that he was becoming too obsessed like Mom and Dad's 'ghost friend', but I begged to hear more as much as he did. We'd crack Dad occasionally, and he'd spin a fresh version of some local, rumoured phenomenon or woodland oddity, and Mom would roll her eyes with a hesitant smile tugging at her mouth.

They never pretended to have all the answers, and they never pretended that it didn't frighten them or that the fate of their friend troubled them most nights, but they offered pieces - fostering a hunger in their children to fit them, maybe, one day, together.

But that hunger would starve.

When Sean became a young man, and I became a teenager, we were wise enough to sense what they were too careful to admit. This 'curiosity' would always be expecting, always listening, for answers that would never come - a puzzle left eternally unsolved - because... we *still* had a curfew to respect, we still had rules; a tradition to honour.

Be curious to your heart's content. Explore the parts of the woods where you are allowed during the day, before you reach the barbed fences. But there are borders - don't go too far out, don't go alone if it can be helped, and don't even think for a second about leaving the house at night, let alone going there. And like the good, well-raised children we were, as our curiosity grew bored - but never bored enough - we respected those borders.

Until the one night we didn't.

Until the one night I would tear my skin through bramble and feel dirt fester under my nails, warm blood on my face, and understand what it was that dwelled out there - nesting among crimson trees so foul... and so beautiful.

\-

The daytime brought its own rhythm, and outside our fortress, life moved with the familiar patterns of any town. College was an odd blend of comfort and absurdity. My crowd - a strange, but functional little crew - made such a blend bearable, and sometimes enjoyable.

There was Barney, with his bottomless backpack of books and anxious, bashful heart; always armed with some obscure pulp fiction wisdom or dusty trivia he'd dug up at 3 in the morning.

Kate, a brilliant, gothic dark cloud of sarcasm and wit, adorned in black lace and sharp eyeliner - drifting among us like a raven that had learned to tolerate pigeons. She liked to draw. A myriad of dreamlike monsters filled her sketchbook, asphyxiating me whenever I saw them, as did the wonder that could rarely leave her mouth.

Arthur, trouble on two legs, adored by every teacher he infuriated and the first to disrupt a lecture hall; a cocky shit who always found ways to get us into places we shouldn't be (excluding one obvious exception). Detentions were a weekly event with him, yet somehow, he was the charming glue that held us together in our worst moments.

And finally, me, a theatrical ginger dweeb of fluffy sweaters and radiating rambles.

A four-pointed lopsided constellation, bright in our own humble little orbit.

But then there was an occasional black hole that made its rounds, from a very, *very* different universe.

*Willow.*

She never drifted to our tables during lunch or lingered in the hallways with us. No, she floated above it all. Self-proclaimed queen bee of this backwater nowhere, daughter of the wealthiest family for miles, founder of a circle of vixens and jocks who were always on the edge of danger. If she raised an eyebrow, the room would shiver; if she snapped her fingers, doors opened.

Worse still, she was the white-haired devil whispering sweet nothings into Sean's ear, encouraging my brother to abandon all of his rules and barriers on half-baked promises.

She was not our friend. Being noticed by her was a curse, not a blessing. Her name was poison in our household, detested by our parents - many arguments spawned from the mention of her alone.

But on one afternoon, in the buzzing cafeteria of flickering lights, scraping trays and pockets of laughter, she strode in alone. I was halfway through listening to Arthur tease Barney about the disaster of a date he'd had when, for only a heartbeat, the room fell out of focus as the cafeteria door banged against the wall, damning us into silence, and in she marched - absent of her salivating little wolf pack, licking at her heels and beckoning to her every word.

Her runway-ready, head-turning miniskirts and white leather jackets were gone, replaced by baggy sweatpants and an obscenely large hoodie, the sleeves swallowing her hands. She looked and moved like... well, the rest of us for once.

And her face - Jesus, her face. No canvas of pristine makeup could hide the ugly, angry, blossoming blotch of red and purple bruising that nested under her eye.

Every soul stared as their queen, out of place in her kingdom, made her way to an empty corner table with her head ducked and shoulders hunched. For those precious few minutes, she was just another girl - battered, tired and alone - threatening to vanish into smoke if someone so much as called her name.

And painfully, achingly slowly, the room soon returned to normalcy as its new corner-bound husk lurked at the edges of our vision - something to gossip about.

Barney kept sneaking nervous glances, bewildered at the sigh. "Snowflake's looking rough today, huh?" He whispered. "Who'd you think she annoyed?"

Kate arched a brow, sketchbook balanced on her lap, pretending not to look. "Maybe her cult of plastic witches turned on her. Looking like shit does suit her, though," she muttered with a flick of her pencil.

Arthur leaned in with a grin. "Or she *finally* ran her mouth at someone who doesn't care who her daddy is... and can throw a mean punch."

Surprisingly, I found myself just feeling sorry for her. "Everyone has a bad day," I said, not sure if I actually believed it or wished someone would say that about me if I ever sported a glistening shiner under my eye.

Arthur gave a low snort. "Yeah, you're absolutely right, Autumn. But not a cunt like her."

Kate then nudged my arm. "She's looking at you, by the way."

Those words sent a prickle across the back of my neck. I timidly looked over and, true to Kate's word, Willow was staring at me from her exiled corner, her hood suffocating her face. A silence choked our table and, for a moment, time itself seemed to slow. The cafeteria and its occupants fuzzed away, and all that existed was the space between us. Then she lifted her hand, and a single dior finger curled out from under her sleeve, demanding me to approach with a tiny, effortless motion - one that sent a shiver down my spine and threatened to drag me away from the safety net of my friends.

I shook my head, and the sounds of the room returned.

Arthur snapped his fingers in front of my face. "Hello? You still with us?"

His voice was peripheral, diluted. Their concerned faces were smudges as they shot bewitching glances over at Willow.

*Willow?*

Willow wanted me.

Barney reached for my arm as I pushed back my chair, mouth full of food. "Don't! Let her sit by herself."

Kate, never one to sugarcoat, muttered, "Yeah, sit down, Autumn. Don't be your brother," all while sketching a hollow-staring shade in the margins of her book.

Even Arthur dropped his usual act, scooting to try and block my path, smug grin gone. "Dude, are you good?"

I wanted to listen, really. I wanted to stay in our planted little pond and laugh at in-jokes. But her eyes dragged me - practically led me on a leash - and I understood then how she could've charmed my resilient brother. Fuck, even looking like crap, she was mystic, humming in my veins while my better judgment screamed to shut her out. I barely noticed my body moving as I weaved around disappointed hands and disgruntled groans and sighs. Logic was gone. Whatever she wanted, whatever grim story she had, I had to know.

And so I let myself hopelessly drift to her table, into her dark mercy.

She glanced at me as I reached her, her bruised face near-unreadable, and then gave her attention to the divided room of interested and uninterested onlookers alike. No one was close enough to eavesdrop.

"Autumn, right?" She beamed as I took a seat. "Sean's sister?"

"Who did that to you?"

She didn't answer right away, just shifted, hiding herself even deeper in the folds of her hoodie. I could almost see her weighing in her mind how much to say. Her eyes then snapped to a shape coming closer, dragging a chair in its wake. I didn't need to look to see who it was as an unstoppable surge of confidence came over me.

"Was it your dad?" Sean pressed, seemingly having manifested out of nowhere, knuckles twitching, eyes flicking over the bruising. He looked over his shoulder at my confused, relieved table of watching friends, offering them a wave and a reassuring smile.

Willow's laugh was a short, bitter burst. "Oh, please, he wishes he were that brave. No, I just... fell."

"Was it Ben? You overstepped?"

She paused and then nodded slowly.

"You've been seeing him without me?" Sean asked.

"You haven’t?"

"Who's Ben?" I chimed in.

The two looked at me, as if remembering I was there, and suddenly I felt like a little girl in my parents' kitchen again.

"Local press," Sean said. "Red hair, built like a stick-" he nodded grimly towards his damsel, "-and the one who encourages this diva to believe she's above tradition."

My stomach churned. "You've been out there?! What, at night?!" I tried not to sound desperate, but the words pathetically dribbled out.

A fowl grin stretched across her mouth. "I told you she'd be keen." She said to Sean.

I almost hissed at my brother. "You too?! After everything Mom and Dad-"

"I've not even left the house *once*, Autumn... I promise."

"Is that right?" Willow teased.

"*Yes*." He spat, pleads and warnings written all over his face. "And try as you might, nothing you or that *alcoholic* says will change my mind." He then ruffled my hair, pausing the racing curiosity that began to rush through my head. "Or yours, I hope."

Willow's gaze then met mine and held it. "Y'know, I've heard things out there. You can come listen too if you're not scared-"

Sean planted a firm, but hesitant hand on the table and stood with a huff. "Catch you later, Wills. Always a pleasure."

"Oh, come on." She pouted. "I won't take her past the fences; even I'm not that stupid... well, maybe just a few feet. We could all go together, the three of us!" Her voice was thin and cold, but beneath all the bravado, I could tell she was terrified.

The word left my mouth before I could stop it. "When?"

Sean was quick to usher me away from the table with nought a word, like my life depended on it. Willow watched us the whole time, smiling from ear to ear with the utmost joy.

"Back to your friends, kiddo. Now."

"I don't... why'd I-"

"*Autumn. Now."*

I nodded, slowly, and made my way back to my sanctuary as Sean reclaimed his seat in the lion's den. Whatever they said to each other was lost to me, but they remained a pair until the bell rang. His affection became more visible - tucking a hair behind her ear, cupping her hand, all while staring ditzy daggers into her.

The rest of the afternoon was a blur. My friends hounded me, prying me with questions about what Willow wanted, what she'd said, what my brother had said, what the two of them 'were', and why in God's name I'd actually approached her. I deflected, lied, kept quiet - anything to keep them away. Yet their pestering was nothing compared to what the recesses of my own mind were doing to me.

I replayed every word of that conversation and, through it all, one name kept cycling around.

'Ben'

A man who could solve the unsolvable puzzle my parents had harmlessly planted in me.

By the final bell, I couldn't bear it any longer, and I folded. I confided in them everything I was thinking and feeling - another rant bubbling out of my mouth in disjointed sentences that, somehow, they could understand every word of.

Arthur proposed it first, stabbing a straw into his milkshake, after we'd escaped the spilling sea of student-filled halls - clambering their way outside to enjoy the rest of their afternoon - and sought refuge in a cafe booth.

"Why don't we pay him a visit?" He took a long gulp of some vanilla delight. The others looked at him like he'd killed someone.

"Visit the jittery reporter who punched Willow in the face?" Barney asked, digging into a slice of red velvet. "What could go wrong?"

"Well, either that or we break curfew ourselves and let this one," Kate began, poking me in the ribs, almost spilling my tea, "scratch her itch."

"It's not an... 'itch', Kate."

"Oh, sorry. Unresolved compulsion then?"

"Hey, back off." Arthur butted in, and I almost thanked him, until I saw the look on his face. "It's not her fault she got hypnotised by that white-haired bitch."

They laughed at my expense; the stupidity, the absurdity of it all. And I did too.

Barney pushed his glasses up. "Have you considered another outlet? Like, read a book-"

"Or get laid."

"Or write music!" Kate seemed exceptionally excited about her own idea. "I can already picture your first single: 'I Was Found Dead In The Woods At 16'."

"You guys suck."

"No we don't."

Arthur clasped his hands together. "Anyway! Suggestion still stands: we visit this guy."

Barney groaned, "I don't know, man... Mom would always say-"

"Ugh, your Mom says *anything*, Barn. And it ain't up to you, right boss?"

The three of them looked at me: Arthur, eager and giddy; Kate, curious and cautious; Barney, frightened and shaking his head. Was I really going to drag them along to a far-off part of town to question a man I'd never met about local legends and parental bedtime stories, all storming from the unsettling words a girl (none of us liked) had given me?

Of course I was.

\-

The local press office was a rundown, narrow building wedged between a dead laundromat and a fading convenience store - its red brick hull stained dark by years of rain and grime. Dusty, crowded windows made it impossible to see inside, weeds poked through the cracked pavement, and the front door barely held itself together on worn hinges.

"Yeah, no thanks." Barney squeaked, turning on his heel and walking away before Arthur tugged him back by his ear.

Kate inspected the building, eyeing it up and down like a piece of abstract art. "Did your brother mention *why* he or Willow talked to this guy?"

"Nope."

"Marvellous."

I didn't bother with knocking; I strode right up to the door and stepped inside.

Beyond an unmanned reception, a few desks packed the room - piled high with yellowed notepads, sticky notes and old newspapers. The stink of old coffee, cheap booze, and burnt rubber attacked my nose as I ventured into the rioting clutter. My boots scuffed against the fading floor as a fly buzzed in circles over an empty mug.

"Hello?!" I called.

No answer.

Kate gagged as she and the others filtered in behind me. "Ew-fuck. It smells like someone died in here."

Arthur slapped a cracked counter, fluttering a bundle of papers into the air. "Perfect. I'm ready to see a ghost, how about y'all?"

"You're more likely to see rats, Arthur." She added, trailing a finger over a dusty desk, painting lines and shapes.

I found myself drawn to a wall of photographs - a timeline of the town's many faded celebrations and events, but nothing stood out. No mention of our town intertwined with a grand fate; no mention of a lost name.

Barney, at first, hung back - overwhelmed by the smell and disorder. But even he soon found himself drawn in, and he shuffled over to a cramped bookshelf, overflowing with almanacks and faded paperbacks. "Guys," he cried, peering down at the floor, "come take a look at this."

We gathered around, not knowing this would be the pivot point, as Barney stared at thin, dark streaks scarring along the floor, half-hidden under the shelf. Arthur's hands immediately flew to its sides, and, with a grunt, he tugged hard. The unit groaned but didn't move. I chose to feel along the edge instead, searching for - there. My fingers brushed a catch beneath the lowest shelf. A soft click sounded, and the whole unit lurched, swinging open on hinges to reveal a dark staircase - stretching down into the guts of the building.

"Oh, God no," Barney whispered, with a tiny hint of uncharacteristic thrill.

"You fucking found it, dork," Kate said. "What're you complaining about?"

"And oh, God, *yes*, you mean?" Arthur joked, eyes sparkling. "Ladies first." He then added, gesturing for me to take the first step.

I hesitated, only for a moment, before taking the first cautious step into the shadows with a shit-eating smile on my face.

So quick. So easy. Far, far too easy. No time to savour the anticipation; awe eclipsed every worry, every rational thought, as the adventure unfolded before us. I soaked myself in the thrills, each of my nerves shot with reckless curiosity, not once stopping to ask questions.

It spat us out into a large, sweltering room washed in a sickly, red glow. The stink of alcohol was more pungent down here, wafting through the stale air. Strings of thumbtacks and curling, ancient photographs lined the walls: a blurry picture of an old lake, a crowd at a festival, an evening shot of a rich, starry sky; figures vanishing behind trees, snapshots of a distant woods bathed in purple light, wide-eyed faces from decade-old yearbooks.

A lair adorned with the collections of a private investigator.

Dilapidated, torn pieces of archived newspaper were neatly lined on tables, screaming local tragedies, accompanied by police forms, council records and government files that had almost bled dry of ink - margins etched with hastily scribbled notes. A cold knot formed in the pit of my stomach as my eyes darted over them. Shut away relics of decades past leapt from the pages and clamped themselves to my chest. They should've just been old stories, forgotten pains, but arranged together, they became an accusation.

'Search For Missing Hiker Continues'

'Police Abandons Search For Missing Son - Family Left Without Answers'

'Search For Missing Girl Continues'

'History Repeats? Another Youth Vanishes Near Old Mines'

'Strange Lights Spotted By Shoreline!'

'Search Continues For Missing Dog'

Dozens of absent resolutions; the words began absorbing together.

'*Search Continues*...'

Fucking search continues, search continues, search continues!

No remains discovered, nothing discovered, nothing e*ver* discovered, no one ever found, no bodies found.

Not even one.

I felt something rising in my throat I couldn't explain. The others had joined me around the table, reading the headlines we'd never known existed in silence, their faces tightening.

A myriad of unspeakable, unanswered losses mouldering for at least 50 years.

This was no adventure; this was a warning.

Did Mom and Dad know?

'Local Sheriff Disappears - Foul Play Suspected'

'Community Divided Over Nighttime Curfew'

'Who Is Enforcing The New Rules? Authorities Silent!'

Kate drifted away from the crowded table and let her attention settle on a map. "Autumn!" I ripped myself away, leaving Arthur and Barney to sift through more paper galore. The map was one of the woods (of course), riddled with illegible scrawls and red markings noting boundaries, but what had her focus was an old calendar taped to the corner - days crossed in black marker pen, others circled and annotated with different, tidier hands.

Willow's name was infrequent enough to spot.

And so was Sean's.

My fingers zipped over clustered markings, piecing together how specific dates lined with shaded areas on the map. They'd been charting, beyond the fences, but there was a threshold that even they hadn't dared cross.

That changed tonight.

The air pressed in, and I couldn't breathe. I steadied myself on the edge of a table - shaking, head spinning, heart pounding like a kick drum in my chest. I didn't know what I wanted to find here, but this was *not* it. Distant and muffled, their voices reached me and drew me back; a hand on the shoulder with some grounding words. Arthur said a joke, I think, Barney muttered something soft, and Kate held my hand - it wasn't grand, there was no fanfare, but it was enough.

When I could finally speak again, it came out in a croak. "What do we do?" The question hung heavy in the air. Too many options: go to the police (and tell them what?), go to my parents (and be put in solitary?)... or-

Arthur spoke as if reading my mind. "We could go to the woods."

"Not a chance!" Barney whined. "I've not even... *been* to the fences, none of us have; I'm not going there. And it's bear season-"

Kate couldn't believe what she heard. "Bears?" She gestured to the room we stood in. "That's your biggest worry?... *Bears?* Not the fact that we'll likely vanish into fucking-*"*

"Guys!" I shouted, for what felt like the first time in years. "Can we... not argue, please?" I then looked at Arthur. "Get a picture of that map."

Barney shrivelled up into himself. "No, we can't-"

Kate punched him in the shoulder. "We can, and we are."

Retracing our steps, we slipped back up the cracking staircase one by one. Behind the battered front door, afternoon had already begun its dwindling descent into dusk. I don't remember what we said to each other as we fumbled back out onto the street - making and questioning plans in the span of seconds - but I do remember who stood waiting for us.

Sean leaned against the hood of his car, arms crossed, jaw tight. When our eyes met, he opened the passenger door and gave a single, sharp commanding nod to the seat.

No one spoke.

Kate kept looking between us; Arthur bristled; Barney gulped, fidgeting with his pack.

I eventually forced out a small, wavering smile as a revolting, impulsive thought overtook me. Perhaps it *really* was an adventure, a quest... but it wasn't theirs. "Maybe we just go home and sleep on it instead. Clear our heads."

"Not a chance." Arthur pressed quietly.

"Arthur, it's late and I'm tired. I'll text you when I'm home. Promise." I lied.

"Are you sure?" Kate asked slowly.

I nodded, and she, unsatisfied, painstakingly gathered the others to start their walks home.

But Arthur lingered. "See you tomorrow." He said, more like a demand than a farewell.

Even Barney showed some resistance, but they soon trailed off, leaving me on a darkening street.

I slid into the passenger seat beside my silent brother, and the car door shut with a heavy finality.

He watched my friends round a corner before he spoke. "Do you want to go home?"

His question slowed the whirling storm in my head. The idea of home - its warm, routine 'normalcy' - comforted me. But it did not scratch gnawing itches. I stared out the window, watching slivers of sunlight begin to hide behind the trees.

"No."

Sean felt his jacket and produced his little, rugged notebook - its edges worn by years of restless fingers. "Last chance."

"I'm sure."

He managed a comforting smile. "Okay."

He put the car in drive, and we took off down the street.

\-

He navigated us through tucked-away, less-travelled roads before the scouts began their patrol, until we reached the town's edge. The car rolled to a stop in an abandoned parking lot infested with pine needles, the depth of the woods just looming beyond a bygone footpath.

At a threshold, the tall, stark black shapes of thick, barbed metal fences, stretching for at least an acre and far higher than any man, tried to ward us away from the wild maw they quarantined.

Not tonight.

Two figures waited beneath a flickering, dying light: Willow, and Ben - red-haired, rail-thin, and staggering slightly on light feet.

Sean killed the engine. A bird called from the trees as he made his way out of the car and towards his crew. I followed tightly behind, not sure what to feel, as Willow offered a happy wave while Ben's rickety fingers twisted around a heavy, military flashlight.

"Who's this?" He nearly slurred out.

Willow answered before Sean could open his mouth. "His sister."

"Huh. Impeccable timing, kid."

An anxious energy came over Sean. "Hey, so, maybe we don't go as far-" he pointed down at me, the pathetic, nervous weight almost attached to his hip.

Ben laughed. "Don't be getting cold feet, Seany-boy, now you got a tag-along."

Willow laughed too, and I pretended not to spot the tremble in her lip.

Sean rested a firm grip on my shoulder. "We'll turn back if you find it too much, okay?"

"Heads up!" Ben warned, as a stream of red, blue and purple lights danced over a hill and made their way down towards the lot.

We were gone by the time they found Sean's car.

Crunching over brittle grass, we snaked through the woods until we reached the monolith. It seemed flimsy up close, a patchwork of tired metal smeared with rust and graffiti, and dead, segmented searchlights adorning the tops. They found the gap easily - a ragged hole crudely carved into the sheet metal, its rim twisted and sharp.

One by one, we slipped through, and my haste earned a few cuts along my sweater.

For a mile, we pushed deeper in total silence - broken only by a clumsy step and a shiver in the wind. I caught glimpses of little 'X's' marked on some trees and rocks, as the path became rougher, revealing themselves when flashlight cones stroked over them.

I saw a 'W + S' carved into one maple tree, cuddled in a love heart.

Willow's voice nearly scared my skin off. "Listen."

Something changed - the voiding silence, gradually, warped into a series of coarse, pained echoing croaks originating from somewhere far, far ahead in the dark. The wind scratched and rattled its way through wounded, cracked bark as my ears strained and every instinct wailed at me to turn around and run.

My brother took my hand instead. And we continued.

"What is that?" I asked.

"No idea." Was all he could say.

Night fully settled over the woods, the moon and the stars obscured by dense trees. I couldn't tell how much further we walked or for how long.

I checked my phone.

Dead. Impossible.

Sean noticed. "Hope you messaged Arthur."

I hadn't. *Shit*.

Before I could think, we came upon a still, unmoving river stream - flashlights glimmering across the shallow, black water's surface. The three of them stopped. This must've been the edge of their familiarity.

Ben charged forward, producing a polaroid camera from a satchel. It was evident from the way he walked that his courage came from a bottle. I wondered briefly what kind of war waged in his head, as Willow went to follow him.

Sean stopped her. "We could leave him to it. He'll tell us anyway, whether we're with him or not."

Willow let out a tiny laugh. "You want what I want, right?" Then she looked at me. "Having fun yet?" She broke away from him and followed the bobbing head of red hair into the breach.

Sean sighed, hesitant to follow.

"I'm not scared." I blurted out.

"I know, but-"

I watched sense and reason come over him in a single moment. It hit me, too.

What the *fuck* were we doing?

It lasted only a second; this lucid cut into the adventure, telling us to go home. Then, just as quickly, gleeful shouts and exclamations pulled us effortlessly onwards.

Several meters beyond the river, one tree stood apart - a towering sentinel marred by something uncanny. A crimson mould covered its bark in thick, shulking veins, twisting and threading through its grooves like a cancer. The colour was impossibly rich, both disgusting and hypnotic, and the texture looked more like a synthetic glass.

Then it pulsed, dimly. A faint red glow breathed to life within the mould, slow and steady, synchronised... to the slow rhythm of a heartbeat.

Willow was beside herself as Ben snapped a picture of the growth. Then he touched it.

The mould trembled and released a cloud of faint, powdery spores into the air, which quickly scattered. A single red vein at the root of the tree flared to life, pulsating with more luscious light. It stretched along the ground - its visibility was a complete defiance of logic, as if the earth itself was translucent. The vein bent deeper into the woods.

Like sheep, we followed.

Every single tree was consumed in the same, lurid mass - shimmering in unusual palettes of red and garnet - some far more infected than others. Even the floor was terraformed by the stuff, puffing at our feet. The pulsing lights grew brighter as thick, euphoric fogs drifted among the trunks, sweet and dizzying and as the haze settled... the lights revealed a truth.

Silhouettes - human and animal both - curled, fetal and motionless, were encased and suspended within the bodies of the trees themselves.

"We should... probably leave," Sean said, dreary and sheepish. "Tell someone."

I cannot explain why Ben chose to rush one of the trees, tearing desperately at the mould in a panicked bid to save the person imprisoned within.

I *can* explain how the forest responded.

The ground convulsed and split open, revealing worming interconnected tunnels beneath us, and a gangling *thing* emerged out at horrifying speed. Its towering, sharp humanoid body was woven of the same pulsing red mould, and it moved with an unnatural, sinewy grace as it mercilessly lunged towards Ben.

It ripped him apart in seconds, splattering us as his flesh tore and bones snapped, his screams lost beneath the swelling, heart-throb of the woods.

The adventure was over. This was a nightmare.

In the chaos and horror, a jolt of raw clarity rushed through me - my vision sharpened, and the soft charm of the woods lifted as I held my breath. I became pitifully aware of the creature's sounds as it clicked and hissed, feeling and searching around its vicinity.

It had no face.

No ears, no eyes, no mouth.

It moved in tandem with the mould's pulse.

Sean came to the same conclusion I did as his hand found mine. He reached into the folds of his jacket and threw his notebook as far as his arm would allow. The creature spasmed and dove to where it landed, clawing and tearing into the ground, shredding the bundle of leather and paper.

Sean's other hand found Willow's, silent and stiff. And we ran.

It was a desperate flight back through the woods, Sean's grip fierce as the monster splintered and retched after us - each step we took triggered a poof of blood-red light to burst from the mould, guiding the thing to us. Every stumble, every cut and scrape, every gasp seemed to vibrate the air as it pursued, tracking our every pace, tireless and quick, but just far away enough.

Then we splashed over the river.

I spun back to see it halt amidst the thicket, shaking, uncertain, its senses dulled - the network of mould beneath it had almost broken. Then it gagged and yelped as the ground opened again, reclaiming its soldier.

The silent trudge back felt much shorter than the journey in.

As we reached the hole in the fence, a searing flash of purple light erupted around us, obliterating the dark. Out of the blur, stern men in dark suits swarmed forward, barking muted commands. They swept us up, herded us away from the woods - no explanation, just tight grips and hurried steps and lights drilled into my eyes.

It was numbing.

Everything passed like a shutter click: the lights, the door, the engine of a police car, the sirens, the walk up my porch. My parents, wild with terror, embraced Sean and me with questions spilling out of their mouths, but all I could do was collapse into their arms, unable to look them in the eye.

My bedroom has never felt this cold; this quiet.

There are slashes up my sleeves and across my hands, my knees are scraped, a gash is across my leg, and I think some of Ben's blood is stained in my eye.

No.

No, no pain pulses in my temples. Not mine; not entirely unpleasant.

I think my brother feels the same.

I see it when I close my eyes.

Not a monster from the sea, nor a God from the woods, nor a ghost girl by a lake.

Just mould. A beautiful, red mass, and a warm tree to rest my head.

Half of me is convinced to grab some kerosene and a match.

The other is a compulsion to go again.

I can go deeper, further. Much, *much* further.

Maybe I'll bring my friends.

Why can't it be their adventure, too?
