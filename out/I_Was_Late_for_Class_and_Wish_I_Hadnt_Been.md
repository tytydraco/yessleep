The blood on the ceiling never really dried. The image still burned in my mind.

I pulled a bottle of beer out of the fridge, the cool bottle kissing my hand with a cold relief.

I have a late lecture today and figure it couldn’t hurt. It’s not like I'm getting drunk. Just something to take the edge off.

It’s not like one beer could make me any dumber than my classmates. They never fail to surprise me with their stupid questions and opinions.

My brother Emmett always kept the fridge stocked so I never complain and drink when I feel like it.

I stepped over a lump of clothes, a few textbooks and a couple boxes from Pizza night making my way over to the table where my bag was sprawled out along with various assignments, textbooks and some of my brother's garbage.

I slid my Swiss Army Knife from my backpack’s strap pocket and flicked the bottle opener attachment out of its red body. I popped the cap and guzzled the refreshing golden liquid.

My brother walked out of his bedroom, his eyes fixing to the bottle opener in my hand a disappointed look forming in his dark brown eyes.

“I don't get why you keep that thing,” he said with that confident tone. The kind of confidence that cuts deep, whether it’s kindness or cruelty behind it.

“Well I don’t see a problem keeping it,” I replied a little annoyed.

“There is no point holding onto it just because it was Dad’s. He was never there for us and he made that clear until the very end.”

His words burned my ears like pouring alcohol on a fresh cut.

“It’s just a knife. And besides, it's the only good one I have,” my voice sounding meager as I bit the inside of my cheek.

“Whatever.”

He turned his back to me, piling his textbook and some crinkled papers into his bag.

“We should get to class.”

“And besides, today’s the day we finally get to show them how smart we are.” A small grin washed over his face.

I leaned my head back and chugged the rest of my beer.

I locked the dorm door and we made our way to our class which was, conveniently, on the other side of campus.

The halls are bleak and boring like usual. Think a cheap community college inside of a 1960s bomb shelter.

Yellow peeling scale-like paint barely held onto the walls.

We walked with a decent pace through the many halls which all looked bland and the same.

The lights gave off their usual buzz.

It’s not like the normal buzz that most people are used to. The kind of buzzing that causes an instant migraine.

We continued through the halls not making eye contact with each other or anyone.

We don’t really chat much.

I guess when you’ve known someone your whole life eventually you run out of stuff to talk about. But he always speaks up when I need him and sometimes when I wish I didn't need him.

He’s always been the better brother. Popular, good at sports and good looking. Most parents say that they love their kids equally, but in reality that’s impossible. Even the best parents know there's always a child you like more.

*Classroom 311.*

We walked in the open door.

The classroom was unimpressive to say the least. This was not a lecture hall full of intellectuals. Think of a crammed high school classroom with poor lighting.

I could feel the shift as I stepped through. The air turned stale and thick.

Who would invent a building with no windows?

We sat in our usual spot in the back corner which was typically either unoccupied or a couple late students would sneak in and sit there.

That made it our best bet to avoid the prying eyes of our instructor and “students” if you want to call them that. Most of them were hardly students since you’d expect college students to have intelligence above an 8th grade level, wouldn’t you?

They all stared at the instructor with glazed over eyes. This wasn't an ordinary group of young adults you see on the street. Somehow everyone at this school was ugly. I’m not sure how a school could attract only deformed, weird, and misshapen faces.

Sometimes they reminded me of rats.

Yeah, I guess that’s a good way to describe them. Rats, but obviously human — just rat-like.

The instructor finished stating the exam rules and handed out our unit one exam. I’m nervous even though I shouldn't be.

With my lucky *Number Eleven* pencil in hand I opened the first page of the exam.

The first couple were easy. But then I reached a couple of real stumpers.

I looked over at my brother who was peeking down towards his crotch. I knew he was using his phone.

I didn’t want to. I already have decent grades; way above passing.

His head turned to me a little bit, not trying to make it too obvious.

“Bro use ChatGPT.”

“We gotta get out of this shit school,” he whispered audibly. The volume shocked me as my eyes darted around for onlookers, ears ringing.

*SECTION II*

There is one bright spot, one glimmer in this sea of decay.

That's why when I finished the test I didn't leave.

I watched this girl, Maria. Every guy in the class probably thinks she's the hottest. They’re right, but those vermin don't deserve her.

I love how she dresses. She knows exactly how much to show, and how much to hide. Calculated and intelligent just like her.

The light above her flickered as my eyes meandered up her physique.

“Please turn in your tests.” I jumped.

We were one of the first ones out of the room and he pulled me to the side of the door.

“I saw you staring at her.” Eyes peering into my soul.

Even though we are not twin brothers I always felt that soul connection.

“Yeah so what.”

“You should talk to her. Please, for me?”

He’s right. But I’m not good with the ladies like he is.

I avoided eye contact with him and took a deep breath.

Students were piling out of the door like a stampede.

The whole world slowed down when she walked by.

But she kept her head down. I swear I got out a “Hi.”

Maybe it wasn't loud enough but I did!

It doesn't matter anyways — she wasn’t looking.

I turned back to him, he was clearly unimpressed.

“Well that didn’t go well,” he said, noticing my disappointment.

“She’d be lucky to have you. Don’t waste it.” He grabbed me by the shirt and pulled me in the direction she was heading.

It was easy to find her. She was wearing a blue top in a crowd of dull colors.

We kept a steady pace behind her.

I want to talk to her but I know I’ll lock up, shut down, and embarrass myself.

And besides, I’m happy watching this goddess from afar.

We continued through the halls into a part of the school I’m not familiar with. This area is even darker and the air feels moist and musty.

I will never understand this maze of hallways and how it takes ten turns to go from Building A to Building C.

They probably want you to get lost so they can charge your parents for another semester.

They couldn’t even keep the time right between buildings. Somehow when I left building one it was *5:30* and I arrived at Building B at *7:11.*

We were nearing the exit to the train station and we both knew it.

“Don’t be a pussy. Go talk to her,” he said sternly, looking at me with intensity.

I began to move my feet faster and made some distance.

Just behind Maria, a sound rumbled in my chest but all that came out was a pathetic peep.

She disappeared out the door. Her blue shirt slipping away like a day's sky into dawn, and ultimately the dark of night.

I could feel the same transition deep in my stomach.

I let out a loud long exhale.

“Good job man, I seriously thought you had it this time,” he said clearly disappointed but somehow with no sympathy.

My body vibrated. Eyes and lips twitching uncontrollably.

I heard the murmurs of students. The side-eyes. The laughter.

I felt the overwhelming urge to slap him.

Dad never minded a bit of rough-housing. I remember that day. Fighting in the hot sun. As Dad washed the blood off his hands and dug a hole.

I slapped hard. My hand, hot and full of rage.

Sometimes brothers fight.

*SECTION III*

As I looked out the dorm window, I couldn't help but notice the comical contrast of the vitality of summer and the emptiness of this place.

The semester was horrible. Even cheating barely kept our marks up.

Stress was high.

What used to be encouragement turned cynical and overbearing. But I get it — we were both under stress to get out of here.

I pulled my head out of the clouds and looked at the clock.

*Damn.*

*4:11.*

I was going to be late and still had to trek across the whole school.

I’m so fucked. Today we review for our final exam and the instructor practically tells us what's on the exam.

I leaped up and shouted towards the bedrooms.

“Let’s go, we're late!”

I vaulted over the many pizza boxes which grazed my knees.

I pulled my *Number Eleven* pencil from the dark pile that consumed our kitchen table and shoveled it into my bag.

It was my last one. Of course I could buy more, but I’ve used this same brand and color since I was a kid.

Dad used to buy them for me. Sparky would chew the erasers.

I felt my body jerk. I shouldn’t be reminiscing on bullshit. I need to hurry up.

I rushed outside without locking the door. He’ll do it.

We were speedwalking through the narrow dim halls.

Faces blurring as we sped past.

Eyes so dark and lifeless.

This really is where the dull souls go to die.

Buzzing so strong it forced its way into my throat; the metallic taste, thick blood.

We passed section C. I looked at the clock.

*4:22.*

“Fuck.”

“Why didn’t you wake me up?” his voice sounded like he just got out of bed.

We kept rushing through the hallways.

The halls are more narrow in this section.

We were shoulder to shoulder.

Less and less students passed until the halls were eerily empty.

Complete silence except for the buzzing.

But the building radiated. You could feel it — all the busy people, the failures, the hate and the drama — soaked into the walls.

*5:11.*

Are we lost?

My body flew back as he yanked my backpack.

“This is exactly why you don’t rush ahead of me like this,” he said, catching his breath.

“You're basically a lost puppy. Like you know who.”

Heat radiated out of me. My hands, burning hot. My face, tingling and aching.

I never meant to leave the door open. I was eleven years old. How would I know Sparky would run that quick?

I closed my eyes and I could see the tail lights and Sparky’s crushed skull.

“I’m so tired of this, just follow me.”

*SECTION IV*

*4:44.*

How the fuck did it take us thirty minutes to get here.

I stumbled into class knowing any minute missed could be lost GPA.

The air was foul. Not just the usual stuffy.

Putrid.

Like there was rotting garbage somewhere the janitor missed.

Our usual seat was open but of course someone was sitting close.

We quietly shuffled over.

The smell of roses lifted me up. This trespasser was not an ordinary human.

It was Maria. She must have snuck in late.

My hands trembled.

“Isn’t that the girl you like?” He smiled like a kid in a candy shop.

I nodded.

“You have to talk to her. Don’t fuck it up like usual.”

I exhaled.

“I tell you what, if you talk to her — pizza is on me.”

What an asshole.

We sat down.

One seat between me and this goddess.

My heart slowed. I’d never seen her this close. Her skin glowed in the light, her aura radiating.

I looked for a moment too long, my eyes darting away.

I’m not a fuck up. I’m not a fuck up. I’m not a fuck up.

The words repeated in my head.

I closed my eyes. I heard my brother's voice — the things I didn't do. Things I didn't say.

The mistakes.

But this… this is my time to shine.

I turned my head to Maria, with a small forced smirk.

“Hi.”

It came out quiet but it actually came out.

I was doing it.

Her head turned towards me, hair flowing with a small sweet breeze caressing the air.

Then the sky went dark. Her eyes — not blue but dark and empty.

Her gaze shot away as soon as we made eye contact like a mouse fixated on cheese.

I could barely see the instructor's face.

The shadows clung to every wrinkle, exaggerating each one until he looked deformed.

The back of everyone's head blended together.

A single pelt of fur.

The image disgusted me.

But maybe that's what I look like too.

“That was pathetic.” His big brown eyes grew dark.

“I knew you’d fuck up. You always do.” He now had a sinister grin.

“You couldn’t even save Sparky.”

I buried my head into my hands.

“You couldn’t even talk to her.”

Ringing so loud I was nauseous. My heart and hands, on fire.

“Like how you couldn’t look Dad in the eyes in his final days. You’re a pussy.”

I dug my fingernails into the wood until they bled.

The crack of a *Number Eleven* pencil made a few students jump.

I stood, hands trembling.

Eyes now on me.

The lights, hot and bright.

Without thought, only purpose. I pulled out my Swiss Army Knife.

Extended the knife attachment.

Held it to his throat.

His lifeless eyes and stupid fucking grin. He knew I wouldn’t do it.

One swift motion.

Silence.

*FINALE*

*Update — a few hours later*

I never knew him. I’ve seen him around.

Something was off. I’ve seen him talking to himself but I try not to judge.

I arrived late for class that day.

I wish I had just skipped.

The way he looked at me with those sad blue eyes before he did it.

Sometimes when someone’s jugular gets cut their blood keeps pumping until there is none left.

I learned that in biology.

It shot out like a fountain.

Covering the floor, the desks, the ceiling.

But for me?

It was a shower.

I never knew blood was so warm.

Warm and viscous.

It rained out for at least two minutes.

*Hysteria.*

Good thing I wore red that day.

The image will forever be burned in my brain.

His lifeless, drenched body; the only thing not covered in blood — a broken *Number Eleven* pencil.

I’ll be switching schools.
