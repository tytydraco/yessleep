**Three weeks ago me and my husband had our first baby. I have been dealing with terrible postpartum depression ever since. The weight of being a parent is unmountable. And in the numb state of purgatory I'm in since I haven't been sleeping. I have started connecting dots about my young adulthood. And my family. My therapist says this is a phenomenal breakthrough as I haven't been able to remember much of that last year with my family. So even though I’m going to sound crazy, I've decided to recount it the best I can remember from start to finish.** 

September 2016 

I’m sick of the road, I'm sick of this place already and we're not even here. 

We've been driving for days to Ammon, Maine. Never even heard of that place. But Dad says it'll be a great fresh start, plus the money is better. 

I miss my old room already, I miss the Georgia peach air, I miss the warmth. This place already feels cold and dead. Driving up, there were golden and red tree lines.The branches on these trees seem lifeless, The trees have no leaves here, As if it's perpetual winter.  

The roads seem vacant of any atmosphere. Why would anyone live in such a static place? 

My daydreaming had overtaken me until I heard Ethan gasp next to me as we pulled into quite honestly the most suburban house I've ever seen. The monochromatic color scheme yanked it away from the wooded landscape, the bright white concrete reflected back at you so bright it stung. Nothing out of place, picture perfect. It felt like an adult dollhouse, frozen in time. 

Ethan raced out of the car the minute we stopped, excited to see his new room. 

My dad must have caught my worried gaze as he threw his arm over me comfortably. 

“Hey love, this house is WAY bigger than the old one aint it? You have your own room, your own space, way nicer neighborhood too, just look at this place! 

He excitedly threw his hand out at the perfectly curved road ahead. Barren of all pets, people, or noise. Just the rows of houses that all looked the same as ours. 

I couldn't help but grin to make him feel better, he wanted to help. But there was something about this place. The silence, the frigid, unforgiving plain houses. Everyone's blinds were shut, no one walking their dogs, no kids playing outside. Besides the over pampered designer cars in some of the driveways I would never think anyone lived here at all. 

A sad thought rushed over me as I remembered how fast we left. And how many people I never said goodbye to. 

The frigid breeze slammed into me, as I glanced around and realized the rest of my family was inside. 

As I turn to go in I notice the house next to us, someone has parted the blinds, they’re watching me. As quickly as I had noticed, they pulled back. The hair on my arms stood on end, I brushed it off to the closing winter air and trotted indoors to my family. 

They were all gathered in the glamorous marble kitchen. My dad held a shining smile from ear to ear. Excitedly telling my mother who looked as glazed over as ever what his future plans for the dining room would be. 

He caught my eye. “Teryn! Go check out your new room!”

“Uhhhh, yeh ok”.. I responded as I begrudgingly pulled myself up the dark wood stairs. 

The stairs overlooked a huge 2 story living room, with a marble fireplace, And looming windows that swallowed up the space. 

The dark floors contrasted with the stark white walls. Despite all the lights being on, it felt so dark and gloomy. 

I saw Ethans things in the first bedroom so I opened the next one directly ahead. It was…just a room. I took a large shaky breath in trying to relax and swallow my sadness. The bright street light in front of our house showed the street illuminating all the houses around us as far as the glowing bulb could show. All of them…were dark. Was I right?? Did no one really live here?? I persed my lips, holding back my thoughts that I had to just run out of this house and never come back. Every nerve in my body felt tense. I had never felt this before, such unease. The constant feeling I was going to be sick. 

To make matters worse, something caught my eye outside. A woman. Walking out of the house next door to us, maybe she was the one watching me before. She seemed to walk with a limp, as if in pain. She looked no older than my mom, but walked like my grandma. As if every step was weakening her frail form. She hobbled past the view from the streetlight. I strained my eyes trying to see her direction after. 

I felt a hand on my shoulder and I almost shrieked. My dads worried eyes met mine. 

“What's wrong? I didn't mean to scare you!” 

I thought about telling him what I just saw, but just shrugged as I knew the woman was long gone from view. 

“I wanted to tell you Teryn, your room is downstairs. You can have the master bedroom. You’ll even have your own bathroom all to yourself.”

He could see me started to question the process-

“Your mom…she wants to keep Ethan…close..”

I nodded “Ok dad…yeah that's fine. Thanks i guess” 

I trudged down the stairs. Passing the empty living room. My brother played with his cars on the dusty floor while my mom held his shoulder from behind. She glanced up at me as I walked by, I smiled slightly at her. She averted her eyes and continued absently mindedly watching my brother play. 

The master was larger, and had a gaping bay window with a view of the woods behind. In the pitch dark of this evening, and with all the things I already saw, I quickly threw the dusty blinds closed. 

We had brought our camping gear to stay the first night as the moving truck would arrive tomorrow. 

I thought back before Ethan was born that me and my dad would go camping for the weekend. He would make the stupidest jokes I’d ever heard and would struggle to light a fire as we got eaten by mosquitoes. But it was some of the best times I remember in my life. I smiled as I drifted off that night. 

I was awoken I'm assuming a few hours later by heavy footsteps above me. My parents' bedroom. By the tone It sounded like my parents were arguing, this was nothing new. But after about a minute I realized I had only heard my dads voice. My mother hadn't said a word. I brushed it off that he was upset and she was giving him the silent treatment or something.  And covered my ear tight with my hand as I rolled over to get back to sleep. 

In the morning Ethan eagerly knocked on my door “Movers are here!”

He was just excited to get his Xbox unloaded as soon as possible. I took my time getting out there. 

As I got out to the truck my dad was heaving attempting to lift our furniture out all on his own. I was able to catch the coffee table before it smashed to the ground. 

“God dad, where's the movers? Can they help you??” 

“Yeh not sure love, the truck was just here open when I came out. No one inside. Must be on lunch or something-”

“Good Morning!!” 

A bellowing voice nearly caused me and my dad to jump out of our skin. The woman who I recognized as the lady outside last night. Mainly she was wearing the same clothes. But had seemed to lose her limp. 

“Oh why you must be Lawerance! And Teryn I presume! Peggy the real estate agent is a dear friend of mine and told me all about the new family we were going to have moving in. We are just so excited to have you!” 

My dad and I made eye contact and he chuckled nervously before turning to her. 

“Ahh yeh…..that's great. I'm sorry, what did you say your name was?” 

“Oh yes, I'm Rita. I live just next door there. She turned to point at her identical home behind her. 

“Peggy mentioned you just had the most gorgeous baby boy as well! Where is he? With his mother I imagine?” 

My dads face immediately ditched the fake smile and fell into contention. “Umm, well actually me and my wife lost our son Henry to SIDS 3 weeks ago….I’m sorry but if Peggy really told you all of this about my family-” 

Rita cut in -“Oh well that's just terrible news! I’m so very sorry, I will be praying for your family, I really should be going now!” As she turned to leave her smile had fallen. But not into sadness, more like disgust or…disappointment.” 

She scuttled off leaving me and my dad dumbstruck staring at each other. Neither of us knew what to say. I finally broke the silence. “Dang these white neighborhoods are something aren't they Dad?” He mustered a chuckle before his face turned stern once more. “Don't tell your mom about this Teryn, she already has so much she's dealing with” 

I nodded and we finished unloading the moving truck on our own, the moving crew never returned that I saw. Must have been some lunch they were taking. 

My mom had food ready for us as we finally sat down to rest. I cut into my pork chop as my father started questioning me and Ethan about our “excitement” for school tomorrow. I gave my typical nothing answers and left the chatting up to Ethan as I usually did with our family gatherings. 

Until I bit into the pork chop. The texture was normal, but the flavor tasted like it was coated in sugar. I tried to politely keep eating it, until I had to spit it out. My dad was ready to scold me until I saw his eyes widen as well when he took a bite of his. 

“Uhhh, Babe?” “What did you put on this food?” 

My mom stood there like a deer in the headlights. Before looking though all the spices she had pulled out of the boxes. 

“Oh no! I must have mixed up the spices, I just cant read these labels! I think it's time I get glasses finally!!” 

She and my dad shared a light chuckle that died off quickly as they pensively shifted back to staring off in their own worlds. 

I ate what I could of the food but ultimately excused myself early, certainly going to bed hungry that evening. 

Thinking back on this I can't believe that would really be our last real dinner as a family. 

That night the footsteps started again. They were heaving and sounded like someone with heavy boots on was pacing back and forth. It had to be my dad. But at this time of the night why was he up, pacing?. My mom would have to be in the room still, maybe sleeping. Though she was on so many sleeping pills, who even knows what she was capable of hearing. I listened for their voices again, to maybe catch if he and my mom were talking. 

I could hear a light voice. That sounded like my dad, like he was maybe talking or whispering to himself loudly over and over again. In line with his pacing. As if he was keeping time with his sentences. Right when I was about to roll over to try and get some sleep. I heard him. A voice that wasn't my dads. 

“Lawrence, What are you going to do?” 

The man's voice said plain as day. I sat bolt upright in bed. My chest immediately tightened. Who the hell was that??? I almost called out to my dad. But something in my throat basically closed up. I couldn't even speak if I wanted to. 

I chose to listen. The voice never came again. But the footsteps never stopped. The pacing continued through the whole night. A consistent cadence, nearly becoming background noise as the sun started to peak in from the blinds. 

My eyes were so tired I barely remember getting dressed for school the next day. I was finally expecting to see some life in the neighborhood, as school time encroached I was sure we would see kids rushing out of their homes to make it to the bus stop I was told was at the end of the block. But there was no one. The streets remained silent, just the gentle cold breeze whispering through the woods around us. 

Ethan talked my ear off as per the usual, I was too tired to pay attention and before I knew it we were coming to a stop at the end of our lane. I looked around for any other kids coming. No one. As the wind picked up and I braced for it, I noticed the surrounding areas were covered in a thick fog. I hadn't noticed any rain, or humidity. Yet you couldn't even see the tops of the ancient trees. 

Ethan tugged on my sleeve, I turned to him annoyed but he wasn't looking at me. He was staring into the fogged woods opposite where I was looking. He leaned forward inquisitively. “Teryn, how do they know my name?” 

“What??” I shot back.

“I never met them before Teryn, how do they know me?” 

Who the FUCK was they. I froze. 

“Ethan who are you talking about there's nothing there-” 

A loud whistle echoed from the fogged trees. Not a summoning whistle like someone calling their dog. A long drawn out call. Almost like a warning. I couldn’t breathe, my swallow caught in my throat. We had to get back home. If I could even call it that. 

The surrounding neighborhood had fallen silent, not even the gale of wind. No bugs, no distant highway sounds. Like we were in our own vacuum of the universe.. I just fixed my eyes where Ethan had, looking for anything beyond the fog, any movement. 

The whistle sounded again. This time deafening, as if it was a beam of sound directed toward us. I grabbed Ethan's hand out of instinct and went to run. In that instant the bus pulled around the corner behind us and stopped in front of us, the whistle stopping just as fast as it started.  

My heart was racing. I looked at Ethan's worried fixed stare and had to pose myself for him. I gently nodded at him to get on the bus. 

The trip to the small school was basically a blur. There were a few kids on the bus whose eyes were glued to us the moment we boarded. Ethan stuck to my side and went to turn to look at them but I pulled him back. 

As we pulled up to the school I was relieved to see dozens of other kids of varying ages walking in. It felt so much less lonely. Two people waited outside our bus as it crawled to a stop, holding signs with our names on them. A chipper looking blonde girl held mine, and our weird neighbor Rita held Ethans…

She practically ignored me and was fixated on Ethan as we disembarked. 

“Why, you must be Ethan!!” She greeted him. “I'm Rita and I’m the leader of fun here at school for all the kids your age!” 

Ethan seemed elated to see a friendly face. 

She finally met my gaze as well. 

“Oh well hey there Teryn!! I hope your family is settling in just great!” 

“Oh, we're doing fine thanks.” I tried to sound as confident as I could despite my throat screaming for tears. 

“Well I’ll take good care of your brother here and you and Rachel best be making your way to homeroom”

Rita gestured to the giddy school girl waiting patiently behind my shoulder. 

They walked off hand and hand as Rachel clearly started to introduce herself behind me, I couldnt the slightest begin to listen. I felt like I had a ringing in my ears still from the whistle. What was that! Ethan heard it too. I cant be going crazy!

“HEY!” Rachel finally grabbed my wrist and jolted me back to reality. 

“Girl you look like something my dad fished in! Did you even get any sleep last night?? New shit is always terrible man, come with me i'll show you a chill spot.” 

She still had hold of my wrist and I was in no place to refuse so I trudged aside her. 

“Ar..Aren't we supposed to be heading to a class?” 

“Ahh fuck that.” Rachel laughed, “they don't even know who you are yet we can hang a minute! You're cool to hang right??” 

I uncomfortably laughed and nodded as we wandered into the woods nearest the school. 

Once past the treeline, She plopped down quickly and pulled out a cigarette for herself and handed me one. 

I had never smoked in my life, my grandad did and the whole house always wrecked it. My dad would kill me if he found out later. But Rachel was basically the picturesque version of a teen cover girl model. Was I just supposed to make her think I was a loser on my first day?? 

I swallowed my fears as I puffed on a cigarette silently next to her. Trying to watch how she did it to make it seem like I knew what I was doing. 

“So what brings ya here?” Rachel asked. 

“My dad got a job near by apparently” I responded 

“I thought it was cause your brother died”. She shot back

First Rita, but now this girl. How the fuck does everyone in this town know about my family. 

“Well…That might have been a part of it” “How does everyone here know so much about us-”

“It’s my moms job to know everyone that comes here, she says we only accept the best so you should consider yourself lucky. Wish I could consider myself lucky, she works here at the school with the younger kids so I never catch a break. You saw her earlier, always making me greet the annoying new kids, no offense” 

She takes a long drag of her cigarette. 

Her mom was Rita?? Our neighbor?? 

How come I hadn't seen her, or anyone besides Rita for that matter?? 

My chest tightened before I could respond. I only managed a small grin to hide my confusion. Trying to piece together what was going on in this weird ass place. 

This town was scaring the living hell out of me. I didn't know how to place it, but it wasn't right and I knew it. 

“You know, I’m feeling a little light headed. I think I’m gonna get some air ok?” I shakenly said to Rachel. 

“Sure dude, I aint got shit else to do I'll be here”

I stumbled off toward the school, my vision blurring from panic. It felt like my entire world was spinning around me, but my feet were glued to the ground begging to come undone. 

As I neared the school, I saw a familiar car, my dads car. 

My heart was pounding out of my chest to begin with, now a new panic set in as I thought over my dad smelling smoke on me. 

As my dad exited the car, his concerned and determined expression erased my fears. 

“Teryn, I came for you and your brother… your mother… she's not doing well” 

“What…what does that mean dad??” 

“When she woke up this morning, she couldn't see. The doctors don't know whats wrong at all, I couldn't bear to even ask anymore questions. I just came to get you two” 

“Is…is she going to get her sight back???” I stammered. 

“Don't tell your brother the situation, we need to support her right now while the doctors figure out what's wrong” Dad said, evading my question. 

The car trip to the hospital was a tizzy, my hysterical dizziness had yet to leave. As my brother sat worried next to me. He went to grab my hand a couple times and I jerked away in discomfort. Disgusted at the time to be touched but in retrospect, disgusted at myself to be so closed off to my baby brother. 

That night as I sat awake watching my mothers breathing apparatus slide up and down. Bandages laid over her eyes, covering what seemed to be wounds where her eyes were. She really just woke up like that?? 

 I glanced over at my father and brothers slumped over sleeping bodies. Thinking over the arguing I had been hearing, the footsteps, the mysterious voice. Has someone…done this to her?? 

I immediately shake my negative sinister thoughts and focus back on my mom. 

Figuring since i couldn't sleep this would be a great time to start to repeat the prayer my mother had always taught me when I was a kid. 

The moment the first words left my mouth. The footsteps started. 

I stayed frozen, silent, for what felt like an hour. My knees were screaming from the pain of being locked in place. I could hear my heartbeat thud in my ear as I listened for them to start again. They never did. 

I slowly slid my hands out from my mothers, and trudged back toward the sterile hospital seating. The moment I took a step. There it was again. 

ThudThud. ThudThud. ThudThud. 

Right above me, in quick cadence as if pacing back and forth, back and forth. 

I turned to look at my mother as the sounds continued, my mouth fell dry as my eyes fell on her heart monitor. The steps above me were in line with her heartbeat. 

What was happening?? My breath was too choked to even speak as I tried to whisper to my dad to wake him. 

“D.. Ddd…Dad”

The thumping became louder above me. More pronounced. 

“Dad!” 

I tried to squeak out in my final attempt to get anyone else to see this. 

The stepping became stomps as the thudding became slams, as if the hits were breaking through the foundation and floors to collapse on top of us. I swore I even heard the beams cracking above me. 

I threw my hands over my ears in the rush of sounds. Tears welling up and spilling down my face. 

“JUST STOP THIS” I shrieked out. Now down on my hands and knees on the floor. Unable to even open my eyes through the sting of tears. 

The room fell silent. Nothing left but a ringing in my ears. That was how my mother died. She was the first.
