Sorry, I haven't updated in a while. I've been having to juggle other assignments between research. On top of that, I've also been dealing with personal affairs.  My birthday was the fourteenth which I hardly noticed. Lately, days and nights are blurring together.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dean has told me to cut back on the caffeine, but what I’m doing is important and if that costs me some sleep so be it. Although,  he and Stella are right in that I  need to get some sun. I’ve been cooped up here longer than I care to admit  After posting this, I should also get something to eat since I haven’t had much in the last couple days. Granted, I don’t eat much, to begin with.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, a protein bar and water probably aren’t going to meet the recommended daily nutrition quota. Actually, I need to do some shopping so I’ll have to order something in the meantime. In addition to analyzing the tapes, I’ve also been looking into other means of figuring out what Ludus is and how to stop it. While there are entities in mythology with similar behavior, none are quite like it. God, it would make things so much easier if all it took to stop this thing was a cross and some salt.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, I’ve seen too much to be that naive.  Then again sometimes all we have is wishful thinking. Anyway, I’ve rambled enough. Before I get into the real meat of the tape,  I should mention that we usually don’t figure out when the events shown take place until well into watching it. Without a stated date, piecing things together is the best we can do.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This means we're not typically viewing them in chronological order. With that out of the way, a transcription of the next tape will be provided.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**\[The contents of this tape are estimated to take place during 1982.\]**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The main focus is a teenager by the name of Albert Ritter, at least sixteen years of age. It begins with him waking up in bed due to yelling coming from his parents' room. Smacking can be heard followed by a woman screaming. He turns over in bed, reaching between his bed and his bed frame. His arm is in view and despite the low visibility, bruises are plain on it.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*From this space, he pulls out a butterfly knife. As the sounds increase, he fidgets with it. This continues for several minutes until stepping is approaching his door. Next, the doorknob jiggles. Then pounding occurs accompanied by his father,  Walter yelling at him with his mother, Pauline in the other room.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Walter:** "God damn it, Al, I thought I told you not to lock this fucking door!"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*His voice is slurred. Albert refuses to respond.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Walter:** "I know you're awake! Don't you ignore me, you little shit!"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*His strikes increase in intensity. Albert's grip on his knife tightens. The lock eventually gives, causing the door to swing open. Albert gets out of bed and faces his dad who is stumbling and has to hold the door frame for support. In his hand is a vodka bottle.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He notices the knife Albert is holding.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Walter:** "The fuck do you think you're doing?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Albert raises the knife, pointing it at his father who holds out his hand.*

**Walter:** “Give me the knife, Al.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He tries to grab for it. Albert slashes his palm.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Walter:** “Fucking shit!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*His dad throws the bottle. Albert ducks but is tackled to the floor and drops the knife. There is a struggle until his father is glaring down. The pov shakes, indicating Albert is pinned down and trying to move. Walter’s hand swipes by the screen, disorienting the view. When it refocuses his father’s face is much closer.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Walter:** “You’re going to show me respect.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Albert spits on his face. He then flies into a frenzy and brings his fist down repeatedly as Albert fruitlessly struggles. His father reaches off-frame and smiles as he holds the knife.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Walter:** “I’ll give you something to make sure you remember your place.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The blade is shown being slashed off-view from the right side. Albert screams. When it comes back into frame, blood can be seen on it.  There’s a faint sound of something light getting dragged across the floor. Albert’s dad raises the knife again.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He attempts to cut him once more. Albert brings his hand up, holding a shard from the bottle, and thrusts it forward. It goes into his father’s jugular. He falls back, clutching his wound as blood squirts from it. Albert’s breathing is rapid as he gets to his feet.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He stares down at his father who is lying with his eyes open in a pool of blood. The footage changes. Albert is standing in a courtroom. He is wearing a jumpsuit and has handcuffs over his wrists. Present with him is his mother.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He only glances at her once. She is called to the stand where she swears the oath. The prosecutor, Mel Campbell proceeds to question her.  A Judge by the name of Chase Felton oversees the case. While legally, a defense lawyer must be provided, it seemed that Albert was unable to attend his trial.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “Did you witness the incident in question?”

**Pauline:** “No, I was in the other room so I only heard what was going on, even then not that well since the door was closed.”

**Mel:** “Would you say your son has violent tendencies?  I understand he gets into a lot of fights at school.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Albert’s hands curl into fists, then he relaxes them.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Pauline:** “We did our best with him. We weren’t perfect, but we tried.”

**Mel:** “How was his relationship with his father?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Albert’s mother hesitates before replying.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Pauline:** “I  admit he could be…Difficult.”

**Mel:** “In what way? Did he ever put his hands on him?”

**Pauline**: “It was to correct him.”

**Mel:** “Did he ever go too far in your opinion?”

**Pauline:** “Maybe sometimes, but he never meant to.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Mel glances at Albert before turning back to his mom.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mel:** “Just one more thing, in the months leading  up to the incident, did you notice your son acting unusual?”

**Pauline:** “Maybe a little.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Unable to control himself, Albert yells out.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Albert: “It was self-defense! He was an abusive piece of shit and she just let it all happen!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*His outburst rattles Pauline. Chase slams his gavel and raises his voice.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Chase:** “Mr. Ritter, I will not tolerate disorder in my court. One more outburst and you will be removed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*A low sigh escapes Albert as he sits back down.  Chase sends the jury away to decide on a verdict. The picture skips ahead. The jury has found him guilty.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Chase:** “Before I sentence you, is there anything you would like to say, Mr. Ritter?”

**Albert:** “It was an accident, but I’m not sorry it happened.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*A brief yet heavy silence falls over the courtroom.*

**Chase**\*\*\*:\*\*\* “Due to the severity of this crime, your age will not be a mitigating factor in this case. You will be serving life in prison.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He bangs his gavel again.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, cases such as these do not come as a surprise to me. I’m familiar with far too many incidents where someone was falsely convicted or punished severely for minor crimes. I know it’s hypocritical of me to say considering who I work for. However, I can argue it has a tangible purpose beyond serving moneyed interests.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*When the footage cuts back in, it shows the underside of a bunk bed. Albert pulls himself to a sitting position, showing a row of metal bars. He gets up and goes to the sink and looks into the accompanying mirror. His reflection reveals several cuts on his face including a jagged one under his left eye.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

By this time, I knew to be weary of reflective surfaces being shown in these tapes. As we watched, I was on edge, waiting for it to appear. Sure enough, it happened.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The mirror shimmers. Albert's reflection conveys confusion before vanishing and being replaced by the image of Ludus.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Albert:** “Guess I’ve been hitting the pruno too hard.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus chuckles.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I like your humor, Albert, but I assure you that your eyes are not deceiving you.”

**Albert:** “Alright, I’ll play along. It’s like I got anything better to do.”

**Ludus:** “Excellent, I have a proposition for you then. First, I want you to look at your bed.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Albert does so and gasps when he sees himself still sleeping.*

**Ludus:** “Do you still think this is all a fever dream?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Albert replies, more nervous now.*

**Albert:** “Let’s say I don’t. What is it you want with me?”

**Ludus:** “A game and if you win you’ll be free from here soon after, no strings attached, and your luck will forever change for the better.”

**Albert:** “And if I lose?”

**Ludus:** “Then something will occur to make your sentence worse. You won’t know when and you’ll have no way to prepare for it, but when it happens you’ll be executed.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Albert is quiet, considering what course of action to take.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Of course, you’re welcome to decline my challenge. All you have to do is walk back to your body and touch it.”

**Albert:** “What’s the game?”

**Ludus:** “I’m sure you’ve been here long enough to know the layout of this place. The game will be simple, hide and seek with me as the seeker.”

**Albert:** “Are you serious? I haven’t played that since I was little. How would this even work?”

**Ludus:** “Well, for starters, try to grab the bars.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Albert does so and is shocked to find his hand passing right through them.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Albert:** “How is this possible?”

**Ludus:** “It’s all part of the game. For the sake of fairness, we can both only pass through bars and doors. If we could simply phase through the floor and windows, it wouldn’t make for a very exciting challenge, now would it?”

**Albert:** “I guess not, but how is this going to be  fair with you already in my cell?”

**Ludus:** “When the game begins, I will vanish from here and take on another form somewhere in this facility. I won’t tell you what it will be. That would ruin the surprise. Your goal will be to reach the front gate. Now, do you accept the challenge?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The urge to scream at those in these tapes never goes away. I understand his circumstances. It’s just that seeing what happened to Gwen and Gerard has made me know it’s not worth the risk. If only Albert knew that.

**Albert:** “Fine, let’s play.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus lets out a giggle.*

**Ludus:** “Then may the best player win.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The mirror returns to normal. Albert stands for a moment, presumably thinking about what route to take. A few moments pass, then he exits his cell. Some guards are patrolling up and down the corridor. They take no notice of him and he is able to pass through one of them who comments about feeling drafty.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was not looking forward to seeing what shape Ludus was going to take. It was even worse than I imagined.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Albert continues and eventually makes his way to the second floor. There, he finds out what form Ludus has. There’s a bark that comes from the other end of the hall. Stepping into the middle of it is a creature that vaguely resembles a rottweiler except the fur and skin are rotted with its skull exposed, giving the appearance of a perpetual grin. It sees Albert and his breath hitches.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Christ, I've seen some things, but the difference was that I had ways of defending myself from them and always had someone to back me up. Albert didn't have anyone to rely on except himself to escape this monstrosity.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Slowly, it takes one step forward. He takes a step back. It emits a low growl, lets out another bark, and charges forward. He screams and flees.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The effect of the tape made it as if I was actually there like I was the one that Hellhound was chasing instead of Albert. In fact, as it went I swore I could feel hot breath on the back of the neck and it made my hairs stand on end.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Albert’s breathing increases with his speed. Every so often, he risks a glance back to still see the dog bounding behind him. A door is ahead. He passes through it, coming to four intersecting corridors. He goes right and heads into a cell.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*There, he slides under the bed and manages to calm himself down. The paws of the dog can be seen as it trots. It sniffs. Albert holds his breath. The dog’s steps go further and then fade.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Albert crawls out when he determines it to be safe enough. More cautiously now, he continues onward,  He looks over the railing at the lower floors. It seems he is considering jimping. However, it is believed he could still experience pain even in that ethereal state.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Whenever he thinks the dog is about to see him, he hides again. His efforts get him far and eventually, he manages to reach the yard. The stretch from it to the front gate has no hiding spots with the exception of maybe some guards patrolling. Knowing he doesn’t have much time before he is noticed again, Albert steels himself and makes a break for victory.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I remember murmuring come on while watching him run, hoping in contradiction to the last tapes that this time would be different. The third time is the charm after all. If only.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The dog’s barking can be heard again, louder due to its rage. Albert picks up speed, pushing his stamina to the limit. He nearly reaches the gate only to be tackled to the ground. He is turned over and shrieks as the dog’s face barrels down on him. The footage cuts to black.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

No such luck. After the shock of viewing the tape wore off, several things occurred to us that were confusing. Namely, Ludus told Albert that losing would result in execution. In that case, why bother with such a hideous form if it didn’t intend to kill him itself? This made us think that something more was going on so we investigated the family. Unfortunately, we were able to confirm Albert’s passing, having faced his punishment a decade after his imprisonment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While this should be the end of the matter, some things just don’t sit right with me. Every tape we’ve seen always shows the death of the player. This one never did. Considering how sadistic Ludus is, it doesn’t make sense for it to leave that out unless it had a good reason. This has made me think there’s more to this we’re not seeing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’ll have to do more investigating. Something else that disturbed me about the form it took is that it looked…Familiar. It’s not merely that it was a rottweiler either. There was something else about it I can’t quite put my finger on. I’ll dwell on this sometimes which maybe isn’t the healthiest thing to do.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Anyway, I better end this post here. Before I get something to eat, I think I’ll pick up a bit. That’s another thing I’ve been neglecting lately and I’ve put it off for too long. I know our fight with Ludus won’t be over for a long time. With luck, this time it will know what defeat truly is.
