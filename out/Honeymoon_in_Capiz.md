Abbie wiped the sweat from her forehead as she listened to the *tik-tiks* calling in the darkness outside their window. The sound reminded her of what their tricycle driver had warned them about that morning on the way to the ancestral house in Capiz – how the *tik-tik* birds weren't birds at all, but harbingers of something ancient and hungry.

"The louder the sound, the farther away the aswang is," he'd said in broken English, pressing wooden rosary beads into her palm. "When the tik-tik gets quiet..." He'd left the sentence unfinished, making the sign of the cross before speeding away, his tricycle's rattling engine echoing down the unpaved road.

Now, as the humid night air clung to her skin like a shroud, Abbie clutched those same rosary beads and wished they'd listened to him. The *tik-tik* sounds had grown fainter over the past hour.

Their room in Doña Dela Cruz's centuries-old *bahay na bato* was suffocating despite the electric fan's tired whirring. The massive Spanish colonial house, with its capiz shell windows and dark wooden floors worn smooth by generations of feet, had seemed charming during the day. But night in the province was different from their home in Seattle. Here, the darkness felt alive, hungry, watching.

"James," she whispered, touching her sleeping husband's shoulder. "James, please wake up."

He stirred but didn't wake. Below their second-floor room, she could hear the ancient mother tree groaning in the garden, its massive branches scraping against the house's stone walls. The locals said the *balete* tree was sacred, that it housed nature spirits – both benevolent and malevolent. They'd seen the offerings left at its base: red eggs, cigars, and small glasses of gin that the household staff replaced every Friday.

A child's wail pierced the night, quickly silenced. Dogs began howling in response, their cries carrying a note of terror that made Abbie's skin crawl. The *tik-tik* sounds had stopped completely.

The air suddenly filled with a sweet, rotting smell – like overripe mangoes mixed with decomposing meat. Abbie gagged, pressing her hand to her mouth. Their host had served them mangoes at dinner, insisting that Capiz had the sweetest ones in all the Philippines. But there had been something off about the way Doña Dela Cruz watched Abbie eat, her dark eyes fixed on her guest's throat as she swallowed.

Movement caught Abbie's eye. The ancient mirror opposite their bed, its frame black with age, reflected something that made her heart stop. The ceiling above their bed was... *wrong.* A dark shape was spreading across it like an oil stain, and in its center, barely visible in the darkness, was a face.

Abbie tried to scream, but her voice caught in her throat as the face began to emerge from the ceiling. It was Doña Dela Cruz, but hideously transformed. Her elegant features had elongated, skin pulled so tight over her skull that it split at the corners of her mouth, revealing rows of needle-like teeth. Her neck extended like a snake's, twisting unnaturally as she descended from the ceiling.

The thing wearing their host's face spoke in a voice like dried leaves scraping stone: "So sweet of you to visit Capiz, Abbie. Not many tourists come here anymore... not since the disappearances started."

James finally stirred as a drop of something dark and viscous fell on his face from the creature's mouth. His eyes flew open, and his scream was cut short as the monster's tongue – impossibly long and forked – shot out and wrapped around his throat.

"No!" Abbie shrieked, thrusting forward the blessed rosary. The creature hissed as she pressed the wooden beads against its flesh, which smoked and bubbled at the contact. It released James, who fell back gasping.

They ran for the door, but the sound of bare feet slapping against wood made them freeze. Children's laughter echoed through the corridor – high, cruel, and hungry. The household staff's children, whom they'd seen playing in the garden that afternoon, but something told Abbie they weren't children anymore.

"The window," James gasped, pulling her back. They could climb onto the roof of the kitchen extension below their room. But as they turned, they saw more shapes pressing against the capiz shell window panels – grotesque silhouettes with elongated limbs and dripping fangs. The hunting party had surrounded them.

Doña Dela Cruz's form was still stretching, her floral *malong*now molded to a body that had grown to impossible proportions. Her joints cracked as they reversed direction, and leathery wings burst from her back, shredding her clothes. The sweet-rotting smell grew overwhelming as she leaked a black fluid that sizzled against the hardwood floor.

"We haven't had a honeymoon couple in so long," the creature crooned, its voice now a chorus of whispers. "The young ones are so tender... and their love makes the meat so sweet." Her nose twitched, and her terrible grin widened even further. "But you, Abbie... you carry something even sweeter within you."

Abbie's hand went instinctively to her stomach. She hadn't told anyone yet, not even James. She'd been waiting for the perfect moment during their honeymoon...

The children's laughter grew closer. Through the door's glass panels, Abbie could see small, distorted shadows approaching. The window behind them was filled with pressing, hungry faces – their features twisted parodies of humanity.

In desperation, Abbie grabbed the oil lamp from the bedside table and hurled it at the creature. The glass shattered, and flames erupted as the kerosene spread. The monster shrieked, a sound so horrific it made James's nose begin to bleed.

They ran into the hallway, past small, twisted shapes that grabbed at their clothes with clawed hands. The main staircase had transformed into something impossible – the steps now spiraled down into what looked like the mouth of hell itself, filled with writhing shadows and the sounds of chewing.

They found the servant's stairs, but as they descended, they realized their mistake. The kitchen below was filled with more horrors – the cook they'd met that morning was there, but her body had split open like a rotten fruit, revealing a mass of squirming tentacles. The garden boy's skin had peeled back from his face, showing the insectoid features beneath.

The balete tree's branches suddenly smashed through the kitchen windows, wrapping around James's legs. He screamed as they began to pull him outside, his fingers leaving deep scratches in the wooden floor.

"Abbie, run!" he shouted as the branches dragged him into the darkness. She heard a wet tearing sound, followed by silence.

Abbie ran blindly, her bare feet slipping in something wet on the floor. She ended up in the house's small chapel, where a cross hung above an altar lined with black candles. As she slammed the door shut, she heard Doña Dela Cruz's voice again, closer now:

"Your husband was delicious, Abbie. But you... you and your child will be a feast we'll savor for eternity."

A rooster crowed somewhere in the distance. The sound was joined by others, a chorus announcing the coming dawn. The scratching and whispering outside the chapel door turned to hisses of fury and pain.

"The sun comes, little mother," the creature that had been Doña Dela Cruz said, its voice fading. "But now I know your secret. And we have so many more nights ahead of us..."

When the police found Abbie the next morning, she was huddled in the chapel, clutching her rosary. The house was empty, showing signs of fire damage in the upper bedroom. Of James, they found only drag marks leading to the ancient *balete* tree, whose branches seemed to have grown thicker overnight.

Doña Dela Cruz appeared as the police were questioning Abbie, looking every bit the concerned grandmother in her traditional *malong,* explaining that she'd been away visiting family. She embraced Abbie, whispering in her ear: "Come back and visit us again, little mother. Your child will be so precious to us..."

They found Abbie's body three days later in her hotel room in Manila, her face frozen in a rictus of terror. The autopsy revealed she was six weeks pregnant. The only strange details were the sweet smell of overripe mangoes that lingered in the room, and the wet, black marks on the ceiling above her bed – marks that looked almost like footprints, if footprints could be made walking upside down.

In Capiz, they say Doña Dela Cruz still runs her bed and breakfast, particularly welcoming young couples and expectant mothers. The *tik-tik* birds still call in the night, and the balete tree grows ever larger, its branches heavy with dark secrets. And on full moon nights, visitors report hearing children's laughter in the garden, and the sound of something large dragging itself across the ceiling, searching for fresh meat. Sometimes, they say, you can hear a woman's voice singing an old lullaby, while something that was once a child asks, "When will the new baby come, *Lola*?"
