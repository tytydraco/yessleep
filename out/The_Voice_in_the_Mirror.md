Lately, I’ve been feeling that there’s something off about the mirror in my bedroom.  
It hangs on the wardrobe door—completely ordinary—but every night, as I sit in bed scrolling on my phone, I feel like something is watching me from the mirror. At first, I brushed it off as my imagination, even laughing at myself for being paranoid. But the feeling grew stronger, especially last night—when I heard a sound.

It was a low, muffled whisper, like someone was speaking softly right next to my ear. But when I snapped my head up, the mirror only showed my reflection. The room was so silent I could hear the ticking of the clock. I stared at the mirror for a long time, until my eyes stung, before forcing myself to turn off the light and go back to bed.

  
I couldn’t focus at work today. My mind kept replaying what happened last night. Was it just a hallucination from lack of sleep? That evening, I decided to record it. I opened the voice recorder app on my phone, placed it on the nightstand facing the mirror, and hit record.

“It’s just a regular mirror,” I told myself, trying to calm my nerves.

Night fell again. The bluish glow from my phone reflected faintly on the mirror’s surface, and I could see my face—tired and worn-out. I stared at it for what felt like forever, until I couldn’t keep my eyes open anymore.

In the middle of the night, a strange scratching noise woke me up. It sounded like fingers lightly scraping against the mirror. There was no wind in the room, and I was alone. My heart sank. I grabbed my phone with trembling hands and played back the recording.

The first few minutes were normal—just the sound of me shifting in bed. But then, at the three-minute mark, I heard it:  
“Can… you… hear me?”

It was a woman’s voice, low and fragmented, as if echoing from deep within a well. My hand froze in mid-air, my throat dry and my breath quickening.

I glanced up at the mirror—and saw myself smiling.



It wasn’t a normal smile. The “me” in the mirror had empty, lifeless eyes, and my mouth was stretched too wide, revealing rows of perfectly straight teeth. My real face wasn’t smiling at all. I wanted to move, to scream, but my body felt like it was made of stone.

The reflection in the mirror slowly raised a hand and pointed under the bed. Summoning all the courage I had, I twisted my neck and peeked beneath the bed—but there was nothing there.

“Not there,” the voice whispered from the mirror, loud and clear as if it were right next to me.

I turned back to the mirror. The reflection of me was gone. In its place was a pitch-black void, like an open door to nowhere. Just as I tried to stand up, a hand reached out from the mirror and grabbed my wrist.

The voice, filled with an unexplainable excitement, said:  
“It’s your turn.”

  
The next morning, my neighbors called the police, reporting me missing. When the authorities arrived, they found nothing but an intact mirror and a phone playing a strange recording of whispers. From that day forward, my shadow never appeared in any mirror again.
