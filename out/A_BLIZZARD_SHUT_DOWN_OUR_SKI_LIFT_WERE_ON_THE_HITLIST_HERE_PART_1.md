December 21 - Me and my pals are going for the Christmas spirit. 

We each had at least a few glasses of beer before we began demanding more from the bartender. Following his reluctance to serve us anything else, I loudly began claiming he was a greedy bastard, hiding all the beer for himself. 

He didn’t like that, frowning at my slurred speech. He waved someone over, and I soon noticed two bulky shadows making their way towards us, through the dancing purple lights and blasting music of the nightclub.   

Fully acknowledging I wasn’t going to get a better chance, I proceeded to take a jug off of our table and aim it right at the bartender's stupid mustache. Right before it hit him, he reflexively ducked under his counter as the glass smashed into the sign, “Drink responsibly”. My memory evades me after this little incident, but it did turn out the bulky figures had friends. I made sure to take a swing at one of them as my jawbone caved in, and the scene around me cut to black. 

Sometime later, I awoke in a haze. I felt my body being dragged. With some effort, I lifted my eyebrows, witnessing sequences of colorful shades. My peripheral vision was failing, I could only hope it was my friends on either side bringing me out of the bar. My eyelids began to drop as I felt a gust of a fresh wind swathe my face. A second later, I was tossed forward. 

For a moment, I felt the buoyancy midair cradle my body, and then I collapsed, falling back to reality. 

Staring upwards, I recognized red neon letters forging the words Blue Flame over the club’s entrance. I always thought they served as a beacon of light in this part of town. The few dim lamp posts that stood on the streets had long out-served their purpose. 

I felt something trickle down my cheek, but before I could assess it, I caught something odd. On the far side of my line of sight, there was a street lamp faintly illuminating an A3-sized poster taped on it in an orange light. 

I couldn’t discern many details, but I could make out the bold letters, “FBI - WANTED”. 

Below the title, there were black and white mugshots of a detective. Now I’m talking classic detective, meaning a dark trench coat hiding a gray silk suit onto which a black tie had been clipped. In both photos, his eyes were covered by a silver fedora hat matching his outfit, with only his shaven face being visible.  I didn’t have the strength to ponder on the details further. But I swear the longer I stared into the hidden shadow of where the man’s eyes were supposed to be, the more unsettled I became. I turned away just in time to feel my consciousness finally give way to sleep, as my eyes closed shut once again.

It turned out I had received most of the punishment while my friends stayed behind and negotiated with the bouncers. The place itself was shady, so they weren’t gonna risk starting a legal case against us out of fear of getting shut down themselves. Nevertheless, after paying some hefty fines, my friends were told to beat it, permanently. Safe to say, we weren’t coming back. 

Soon after, they found me lying half asleep on the right shoulder of the road. They flipped me over to reveal my shivering body. The bottom half of my face indicated dried streams of red, but I was relatively unharmed otherwise. We were happy to let that night slip into the subconscious parts of our brains. 

A month passed. One of my pals from the nightclub, Berry, called me up to propose a trip he had been scheming for a while. 

“We’re going up north,” he said, adrenaline in his very voice. “Get your old ski costume, and meet me at my place Saturday at 9:00 - sharp” he added. 

I knew what the jackass was hinting at, “No worries man, I’ll be on time.” 

When the weekends come, I leave an hour in advance to reach his apartment complex.  I take the beltway, avoiding driving through the heart of my congested city. The sun slowly began to peer over the skyline as I accelerated on the highway. I smiled on the inside, recognizing it might be the first time in a long time that I am not late. 

When I arrive, my friend greets me in his driveway. I exit my car and feel the cool briskness of the winter morning. Berry has already kickstarted his Chevrolet van, warming its engine for the drive ahead. After we each had a cup of hot coffee, we packed all our gear into the trunk of his car and left for the surprise. 

The clock read 11:19 p.m. as we pulled up to the parking garage of the hotel we would be staying at. A young blonde - mid 20’s with light makeup, greeted us at the reception. The corners of her mouth formed a smile as Berry leaned forwards toward her desk, placing his elbow on the counter in front of her. 

Revealing a grin Berry asked, “Do you have a room under the name - Bridger?”

After some ID verification, she carefully moves her eyes from him to her monitor, the receptionist clicks through some files before reviving her smile. 

“Room 106.” 

She fetches a keycard from under her desk and stretches it out to Berry. Not taking an eye off her, Berry slowly takes the card from her hand. He thanks her and we leave. I catch a glimpse of the woman biting her nail as she stares off in our direction. I gaze back at Berry, his grin having only grown wider. 

Once we reach our rooms, I put pressure on the door before it cracks open. We hastily drag our luggage inside, and it isn’t long before we collapse into bed. 

The following morning, sunshine seeps into my eyes; the scent of tea pulls me out of bed. After a big breakfast, we make our way to the reception to ask where we could find the closest skiing hotspot. Much to Berry’s dismay, a man in his thirties is now standing behind the counter, the young woman nowhere in sight. He directs us toward a gondola lift that would take us to the local ski resort. 

“Enjoy.” he finished, as we made our way toward the exit. 

Eventually, we found the gondola lift. The closest cable car to us wasn’t large - enough to hold four people. It had a bright blue stripe crossing its median. The glass doors moved forward before sliding apart, inviting us inside. A phrase lit up on the black rectangular console above the doors - “watch your step.”

We entered, propping up our gear on two neighboring leather seats. The doors remained firmly where they were for a solid minute before closing. 

I cleared my throat before looking out into the window. The sight was mesmerizing; acres upon acres of forest blanketed by a wave of white snow, a large frozen lake reflecting the sun's golden rays. Squinting my eyes, I could just make out towering mountains of stone lining the horizon. The only hint of human civilization was a red and white cell tower rising above the woods. 

I look over at Berry, expecting him to share my feeling of awe, instead, he held a concerned look. His gaze fixed on the clouds that had begun to accumulate on the horizon. The light wind which had been lapping at our faces changed in tone; it was colder, the type that makes a chill go down your spine. However, it did not solely experience a change in temperature, but one in velocity as well. It traveled in the direction opposite of the increasingly hazy sky. 

“Hey,” started Berry, his tone dancing on the line of seriousness and apprehension, “you grabbed our water bottles before we left, right?”

A moment of silence followed as I assessed the darkening landscape. “They’re in the bag.”

I began to feel the wind now steadily swaying our cabin, like a ship in the sea. A feeling of unease crept over me as brewing thunderclouds drew nearer to us, casting their dark shadow over the ground. And then it happened. 

A crackle sent our cable car violently rattling along with the others. A long beeeep came from the com speaker above us. We came to a sharp stop, swinging on the whining steel cable holding us above the ground. I peered downwards, a large pine tree was distorting my calculations on how high up we truly were. 

No voice came from the speaker. We saw only one phrase lit up on our interior console - “Don’t move.” We read those words as the last rays of sunshine fell prey to the storm. 

I heard a clunk sound to my right, and I saw a lift detach from the cable and fall. My hopes of a singular malfunction were dashed when I realized the lifts were falling in order, one by one. We sat completely still until we heard a click above us. 

We experienced weightlessness for a split second before crashing into the ground. We didn’t lose consciousness, just lay there, giving ourselves an anatomical autopsy. No bones broken. I sat up and saw Berry still slouched on one of the seats, his eyes wide. Before long, we managed to get the doors to fall off their metal hinges and plopped out onto the ground. 

Fortunately, we were hanging above a snowbank that cushioned our fall. About fifty meters in front of us was an outline of another ski lift sticking out of the snow. 

“We have to go check,” I pointed. 
“Don’t bother,” A hint of melancholy in Berry’s voice, “I didn’t see anybody on that thing besides us.”

We stand in silence as a low rumble from above echoes throughout the woods. 

“We can't be far from the resort.”
It was my turn to get wide-eyed. “You wanna tread snow in a blizzard?”
“Hey,” Berry gestures towards the ski lift, grinning, “we got all the equipment we need.”

Within a couple of minutes, we’re skiing on a trail going in the direction of the resort. Above, dark clouds continued to move in an unusual manner. The light snowfall we had met upon our crash was quickly transforming into a blizzard. Soon enough, I could barely discern my friend in the cascades of the storm. 

We ended up on a narrow pathway surrounded by woods on either side. On more than one occasion, I couldn’t tell whether Berry was shouting, or the howling wind was playing tricks on my ears. I could barely make out my own breaths as I sharply exhaled, sliding forward with my ski sticks. I turned my torso rightward and caught a glimpse of a face. I shut my eyes, bits of ice were pricking every inch of my face left exposed to the wind. I lifted up my goggles, there was only a row of swaying pine trees where I thought I had envisioned something. 

Nothing happened for minutes before we nearly crashed into something rough in front of us. I backed away and brought a gloved hand to my face, blocking out the now raging storm blurring my vision. An enclosed suit of armor towered before us, its height no less than 2 meters. The metal it wore was plagued with rust. Its face masked by a large iron helmet matching its size. By the look of the design, the armor looked to be of East Asian origin. 


“How thick’s that armor?” I heard from Berry. “Halloween didn’t end here.”
“Nah,” I smiled. “This is the new St. Patrick’s Day man. The calendar got a new holiday.”

We stood motionless for thirty seconds, the storm continuing to rage around us. And that’s when I got a good look at the thing’s features, where the face should have been. 

The mask it wore had abnormally large openings for a set of eyes and a mouth. They were deformed in a way that made their physiognomy look…unnatural. 

I can’t fully explain it.

Curiosity got the best of me and I found myself lifting a hand up. I tapped on the figure’s mask - no echo reverberated throughout the suit. 

“It's not hollow.” I turned to Berry, he pointed back at the statue. My eyes followed his stare. And that's when chills ran down my freezing spine. 

The figure’s hand had slowly begun to rise, gradually stopping once it fully covered its mask. 

 I leaned closer towards it to search for electronics or wires when its fingers clenched into a fist, latching onto its eyeholes. The corners of its mouth inexplicably widened as it slowly twisted its hand, deforming its eyes, then its face as if they were aluminum foil. A thin crack in its melting mask revealed… skin. 

Berry flipped shit.

We took off, desperately trying to get momentum on our skis. A wheezing sound was projected, it didn’t come from behind us, but from our sides. These creatures peeked out from the increasingly dense forest, pure animosity on each of their faces. They didn’t follow us, just turned their heads as we passed them. 

I stared at one for too long and tripped on something hard, immediately getting tangled in my skis. The only thing I could do was crawl forward, buying myself a few extra seconds of time. I made out the form of my friend in the endless waves of frost in the air. He was using all of his might, trying to get me back on my feet. In my futile attempts, I heard long strides being taken, the crunching of snow a mere few meters to our right. 

BAM. 

A gunshot sent ripples through the air. 

“GET UP.” someone barked. 

Pushing off one knee, I managed to propel myself toward the voice. A deafening, bear-like growl echoed around me. The footsteps I heard before now caused the ground to rumble, nearly throwing me off balance. I looked up, making out where to our savior was scattering.  

“Up ahead and to the right!” I directed an out-of-breath Berry, the storm diluting my words.
	
We neared what looked to be a large cabin, housing a set of double wooden doors at its entrance. 
I heard a snarl to my left, ducking just in time to feel something graze my neck. 

I looked up and saw the figure in front of us practically kick the doors open. He halted abruptly, glancing back at us, his figure getting ever closer as we sped to him.  We locked eyes, and a sorrowful expression crossed his face. 

Another malicious roar sounded from behind me; we weren’t going to make it in time. I spared one final look at Berry, but before I get the chance to turn my head, something shoves me from behind.   

I’m flung into the doorway, my left arm crashing into its frame, sending one of my ski sticks flying into the snow. I land on my side. As I do, my peripheral catches Berry tripping just before he reaches the door. I’m helpless to do anything, as someone slams the doors shut, yanking Berry inside at the last second. 

Something slams against them on the other side. The threshold splintering upon impact and I brace for the next blow, shielding my face. No sounds came. 

We all sat there for a minute, catching our breaths. 

“You got lucky.” a dull voice spoke. I turned to the stranger, suited in a pale green ranger’s uniform. 

He looked to be in his early forties, with a bushy mustache concealing his mouth. 

Unclipping my skis, I rose face to face with the ranger. 

“What the hell happened?” I asked, desperate for an answer. 

The stranger peered at me with tired eyes. He strode towards a window, removing his hat and neatly positioning it next to a large stack of files sitting on his desk. 

“Son, I hate to say this, but you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time.” He turned to face me, a hint of a smile in his eyes, “you want something hot to drink?”

In a matter of minutes, we were sitting at a coffee table with a kettle boiling above the fireplace. 

“The storm cut out most of the power lines,” the ranger sipped his tea, “there are a couple more outposts in the area…we lost contact some time ago,” I followed the ranger’s stare to the window, “and nobody’s going out there.”

A chill ran down my back. Barely anything was visible, a dark blue shade bathed the environment. The narrow parkway outside faced a continuous struggle with the storm. What traces of traffic signs remained had been lost to the blizzard. 

“Wouldn’t recommend looking for too long.” the stranger said. 

Berry threw a couple of branches into the amber glow of the fire pit positioned at the far center of the room. They crackled in the flames, before quieting down.   

“We’re out.” he declared. “I doubt the twigs you have left are gonna keep the fire alive.” 

The ranger leaned back in his chair, “The excess storage of wood is next to the main outpost, just a few miles from here.”

“So we freeze our balls off for the night, no problem.” Berry half-assedly replies, still panting from the chase. The ranger looks at him, almost suspicious. 

“The cold isn’t what we should fear right now, not those things either.” we all pause. 
“In that case,” I begin, “who’s taking the night shift?”
“Not you, that’s for sure.” the ranger gets up, gesturing towards the stairs, “Two bedrooms up there, get some rest.”

I should’ve protested, I should have. But I was just so tired. 

I didn’t have a pleasant dream that night. 

I found myself lying in a stairwell. The ones found past the emergency exits in large buildings. Peering over the railing, I saw stairs stretching up and down as far as the eye could see. 

My blood goes cold when I catch a figure leaning against the railway. It was one of the metal beings that ensued after us earlier. Its mouth was absent from its face, yet it still spoke. A sadistic voice that echoed throughout the stairway. 

“Having fun yet?” it asked. Its expression seemed to widen with satisfaction at my lack of a response.

 “I’ll admit, your rescue was quite a stroke of luck,” the white halogen lights above us flickered, “and it’s one you won’t get again.” 

I began to back away from the thing, glancing down at the endless abyss. The blinking lights were giving out, floor by floor, darkness ascending the stairwell. The thing’s head tilted sideways as if it was curious what I was about to do. I bolted. 

The combination of fear and adrenaline in my bloodstream would’ve normally sent me speeding up the concrete blocks; but it was as if a hundred weights were slowing my body, getting heavier by the second. My muscles were drained of their energy as the being ran up towards me, level by level. I remember dropping in the corner, seeing the thing’s helmet come into view. And then darkness washed over my floor. 

A puddle of sweat awaited me when I awoke. I rip off my covers, throwing my hands around to find a light switch. Instead, I make out the cubical shape of a small drawer. Pulling it open, I find a lighter and a pocket knife in the darkness. I decide to leave the blade, but retrieve the lighter. I spin its wheel, sparks flying out from the nozzle before a flame rests above it.

I transverse the second floor, passing a series of photographs and paintings. I reach a window,  the storm outside had started to calm. I find the stairs, and make my way down, any sudden movement creating a creak in the wood. Once I’m in the living room, I wave around my weak light source, stopping it just above the ranger’s desk. 

A pinboard was nailed to the wall, a net of color-coded string pinning countless newspapers and photographs along it. That’s not what caught my attention, however. In the center of the board, well obscured from the outside world, was the detective I saw a month ago. 

I nearly drop my lighter as the front door opens. In steps the ranger, patting the snow off his winter clothes. The icy breeze he lets in sweeps the room, the cold finally settling into my body. He glances in my direction, not particularly surprised at my presence.

“Didn’t sleep well?”
I nodded.
“Consider yourself lucky you got some.”

I examine him, now taking into account his pale face, his breathing unstable. 

“Find anything interesting, kid?” he nods to the pinboard. 
“I’ve seen his picture before,” I say pointing to the cloaked man. 

The ranger walks over, stopping next to me. A smile creeps across his face.

“Inspector Hark, Second Precinct.” 
“You knew him?”
“We had a few assignments, when he was involved, a case never went cold” the ranger stops, “up until his own.”

A deep breath escapes him as he walks to the kitchen. He opens a glass case, and fishes out a bottle of scotch whiskey. 

“In the winter months, fifty grams keep the heart healthy.”

He glances at me, I kindly refuse his offer. 

“One investigation changed him. He just snapped, went rogue. Ended up catching himself a list of charges. Then he disappeared - no leads, no traces. Wanted in the state.” He downs his whiskey. “And I think he’s not far from us.”
