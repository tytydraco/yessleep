21st Feb 2025. 7:53 PM UTC. That's when the world ends.

But not mine.

In a few days, you will all be gone. Every single one of you under 30 years old will simply cease to exist. And I will wake up again, as I always do, in my twenty-year-old body, back in the year 1995, doomed to repeat this cycle for what I can only assume is eternity.

I've lost track of how many times I’ve looped. I tried counting once just to see how high the number would go, but at some point I stopped. It doesn’t matter. Time has no meaning when you are its prisoner. I have walked every square foot of the planet, I can speak every language, I know every custom and cultural norm, and I can predict the course of history with eerie accuracy.

The small details shift; the stock market fluctuates differently, the lottery numbers change. But I have seen the patterns of the world so many times that nothing ever surprises me. I can anticipate technological advances, societal upheavals, and even the way people will vote decades in advance.

And I have met every single human being who existed thirty years ago. Every. Single. One.

That’s how long I’ve been trapped. Every adult walking the earth in 1995? I’ve spoken to them. Every child? Every elderly person? I’ve befriended them, argued with them, helped them, watched them live and die. But you... the ones born after 1995? You are my only source of change. The only new faces I ever get to see.

You are the only reason I am still sane.

Because, you see, every time my loop resets, random chance alters who gets conceived. Billions of tiny random fluctuations determine which sperm meets which egg. If you were born after my reset point, you’re new. Different. You didn’t exist in my previous loops. You are the only people that have a chance of surprising me.

That’s why I became a teacher. It’s the best way to meet you, to interact with fresh minds, to feel, even for a fleeting moment, something new. As you grow, I follow your journey. Starting in kindergarten, then moving to middle school, high school, and college… until time runs out.

Then, the world ends. And I start again.

I have tried everything to break free. Ending my own life does nothing... I wake up in 1995 as if nothing happened. I have tried changing the world in massive ways, but the loop always finds a way to correct itself. I have lived as a hermit, I have lived as a king, I have tried everything.

And so, I turn to you.

Every loop, before the end, I post this message. Somewhere, somehow, I hope that someone will recognize me. Maybe someone will reach out and tell me they are stuck too. Maybe someone new can tell me how to escape.

Because when the loop resets, those of you under thirty will be gone. Wiped from existence as if you never were. And I wonder, what happens to you? Do you simply vanish into nothingness? If souls exist, what happens to yours? Do you all go somewhere I cannot follow?

I hope that, wherever you go, it is kinder than this endless, meaningless existence I am trapped in.

And if you’re reading this and you have an idea… please, help me.
