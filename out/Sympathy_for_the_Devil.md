4:00 PM on the clock. My shift ended at the same time, as per usual, and I was driving my Subaru back to my house. The road was the same, a country road towards a small town to the east of Seattle. I don’t like to boast, but I was by no means suffering from poverty or a low middle class, as some people think when they see me going to my job. I owned a large house near the road, half a mile from the town.

It was a regular drive back home, through the wheat fields and paved road. Some cars came and went, though it was empty for the most part. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary nor even slightly off-putting. But a twisting feeling in my gut, like a stomach ache or that urge you get before you vomit, gnawed my insides as I tried to calm myself down.

Everything seemed so in place yet so unfathomably out of it. The cows chewed on the grass like they always do, but it seemed so sickeningly unusual that words failed to describe it. What was wrong with me? I don’t remember eating anything rotten. Hell, I don’t remember eating at all since last I remember my wife was, at least I could say, angry at me and didn’t pack my lunch.

I began to sweat, to my dismay, and I felt hot as if the suit I wore began to suffocate me. I loosened my tie and opened the window to let some fresh air come in. I relaxed for a moment as I took a deep breath, and then turned on the radio to let my mind wander aimlessly. I don’t recall there being much work today, but the stress almost shattered my mind with the headache it brought me. Naturally, at this time, exactly 4:22, the local radio station would play “Sympathy for the Devil”, and I quite enjoyed that song.

However, what few bits of relaxation I had faded, more so vaporized, as I heard static on the radio. Not the static of disorganized noises, but this one felt horrifically familiar. I recognized the melody in the noise, it most definitely was Sympathy for the Devil. But the lyrics were not singing, nor were they lyrics. It was some sort of muffled scream, I could tell. It was unnerving, it made me sick, and the urge to puke grew worse.

“What the fuck,” I said, swallowing back my vomit as I turned off the radio. “Just what the fuck is happening.”

I removed my tie and used it to wipe off some of the sweat that built up on my forehead. I decided to pull up, stepped out of the car, and took deep breaths while trying to make sense of what was happening. I looked around me, everything was the same, so why was I so confused? Was it the stress? Was it the fight I had with my wife? Was it…what else is there?

I shook my head, disappointed in myself, and got back inside the car. I rolled the windows down and made sure to shut off the radio for good. The breeze that blew from outside was refreshing, and it certainly helped in keeping me cool-headed for a moment. 

I drove for nearly an hour before that feeling returned, and just as I was going to stop the car, a man on the side of the road, wearing a cap and a large backpack, waved at me to stop. Hitchhikers weren’t common, but tourists once every now and then wanted to explore the American countryside. I didn’t want to deal with him but figured if he was a hitchhiker, it could keep my mind off whatever I was experiencing. So I stopped, and he joyfully came walking with a smile.

“Hey, mister!” Thank god, he was not a tourist. “Mister, could you get me to a gas station on the way? It’s a few miles ahead, it shouldn’t be disrupting your course from what I saw on the map.”

I recognized the gas station, and I nodded: “Yeah, yeah. Sure, hop in.”

“Awesome! Thanks, mister!”

He took his backpack, put it in front of him, and sat next to me. I took to the road once again, a mixed feeling of annoyance at the hitchhiker and also being at ease washed in. Strange, but I was cool for now.

“Thanks for helping me, mister. You don’t get many cars passing by at this time here, do you?”

“Uh…no, I don’t suppose.” I said, “What brought you here anyway?”

“I’m actually a YouTuber.” He said with a smile, “Name’s Liam. I’m a vlogger who goes around states, filming the wilderness and people, hitchhiking here and there. I don’t have a big channel, just a few hundred subscribers, but I’m determined to make it big. I’m trying to tour the world.”

“And how far did you get into that?”

“Not too far, I barely made it out of Washington state.” He laughed, “But hey, imagine how many more subscribers I’ll get if I go to every state?”

“Yeah, sounds nice.”

I wasn’t intending to sound so lackluster, but that’s all that came out of me at the moment. He didn’t seem upset, but the silence sure got to him as he tried to turn on the radio. Before I could realize what I did, I smacked his hand away, and my eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets as I glared at him. 

“Don’t.”

“Woah… I’m sorry, mister.” He leaned back, “I didn’t mean anything by it, thought it was a little quiet.”

“Yeah…sorry.” I said, “I don’t feel too well today, I apologize if I’m cranky.” 

“What’s the matter?”

I thought about it for a moment, then gave up and decided to get things off my chest.

“I dunno, it’s been a rough day. Ever since I clocked out of work, this killer headache and stress have been killing me. It wasn’t a good day before that too, I fought with my wife.” 

“Man, that sure sounds like a rough day.” Liam nodded, “What did you fight about?”

“Can’t remember, but all I can get for certain is that…” I thought about it for a moment, and suddenly a rage hotter than a thousand suns burnt and boiled inside my being. I was certain my face was as redder than a chili pepper as I ranted about her. “That bitch, she’s always so whinny and fucking annoying. She always erupts at the smallest things, she never lets me explain and just keeps drawing her own shitty conclusions and won’t ever let me explain.”

“Woah, woah, woah! What happened, mister?”

“I can’t remember, but now that I remember how annoying she becomes, I can’t help but dread entering the house back to her ear-drum rupturing screams. God, I fucking hate her voice.”

“Don’t you think you’re going a little overboard, mister?”

The anger boiling inside of me nearly made me sock him in the face, but I controlled myself this time and refrained from showing my anger. A feeling, similar to an ice bucket on a hot summer day, washed over me and put it me at ease just as I noticed the gas station.

“Is this your stop?”

“Awesome, mister!” He said, “Thanks a bunch, I’ll give you a shoutout in my video! And…try to settle things with your wife. Thanks again!”

He took his backpack and walked to the gas station all giddily like a child seeing a candy store. He entered the store, and I decided to fill the tank while I was at it. I did it myself, since no one was outside, and paid with my card before I got back inside. Right as I was going to drive away, Liam came knocking on the window. I don’t know what came over me, but this time, I was delighted. 

“Liam, need another ride?”

“You read me like a book, mister.” He chuckled nervously, “Mind giving me a ride ‘till the next town? Shouldn’t be far?”

“Why? What’s the matter?”

“I was going to hitch a ride from here, but the old man at the gas station told me that no car came by here for like 2 hours.”

“I see,” I said, half-heartedly. “Hop in.”

Much like before, he got in, backpack in front, and closed the door right as I went back on the road. It was silent for a few more minutes before Liam cut through the thick air. 

“So, uh, why’s it so empty today, mister?” He asked.

“Dunno, probably something going on in the city.”

“You didn’t see anything on your way out from there?”

“I can’t remember, it just gives me headaches trying to remember.”

“Sounds rough, mister.” He said, “Is it alright if I turn on the radio?”

I paused, pondered it, and nodded in response. “Sure.”

He turned on the radio, and a news broadcast came up. The voice of a news anchor, a woman, spoke in an urgent hurry.

“The Seattle PD are still unable to find the suspect despite the barriers put up on the city’s exits. If anyone holds any lead on the matter, please call the number : 0-”

I instinctively turned off the radio. I don’t know what came over me, why I had done that, but I did. Liam’s reaction was less of shock and more of confusion. He didn’t seem nervous, but he had his suspicions. 

“So, what’s your work, mister?” He asked, almost shyly. 

“I’m an accountant.” Or that is what I had hoped. My memory was still blurry after all.

“I see. You didn’t see any commotion in Seattle?”

“Not when I left, no.”

“I see.” He faced the window, “Hey, what’s your favorite song?”

“I’m sorry, I’m not in the mood to answer.”

“Are you sick, mister?”

“Sick?” I turned towards him as if I had heard that word before. “I…dunno. I think I am.”

“You got a fever, mister?”

“No, no. I don’t remember at least. Look, can you just let me drive in peace?”

“I don’t think so, mister. You don’t seem at peace.” He said, “Is something going on?”

At that moment…I decided on it. It was a horrible thought, but I decided on it regardless. The way he ran his mouth, the way his annoying little shit of a face gazed at me. I craved nothing more than to just strangle the life from his eyes and toss him outside. But a more sadistic thought came over me, a disturbing one. The stress and headache, coupled with the anger I felt, made me decide to not only kill him but also my wife. 

“Do you have any plans for when you get to town?” I asked, imagining the moment that I wrapped my fingers around his throat. 

“Yeah, I’m actually going to stay at a friend’s house. He’s not really a friend, more of an acquaintance that I happened to meet by accident. But we share the same interests, so we kinda understand each other.”

“I see. Do you know him from all this, uh, YouTube stuff?”

“Not really, no. But I want to shoot a video with him.”

“Right.” 

Silence loomed for many more minutes before he spoke. 

“Hey, mister.” He turned towards me, “Mind if you drop me off here?”

“Why?”

“Nothing, I just want to walk a little more.” He said, “Walking makes me feel at ease, I’d really appreciate it if you could drop me off here and let me walk towards town.” 

My mind raced at the moment. Two warring sides, one telling me to let him go, and the other telling me to lunge at him and rip his throat out. But at that moment, strangely enough, I felt at ease as I came to a stop and told him to hop off. He smiled at me. A warm, friendly smile as he walked out.

“Thanks, mister. Thanks a bunch.” He said as he closed the door. He then knelt down to window level and followed. “I know how you feel, mister. Don’t fight it.”

His words struck me harder than a lightning bolt. I didn’t want to ask him, I didn’t want to press him further, for I would have gone through with my plan if I did. I ignored him and stepped on the gas. Seeing his figure disappear in the distance made me breathe a sigh of relief. I don’t know what to feel anymore, I think I’m having a manic episode.

Or am I schizophrenic? Just what the fuck is wrong with me. All aches and feelings overwhelmed me, but in the end I drove until dusk, until I saw my house. A feeling of relief came over me and my knees grew weak. Right as I parked the car on the driveway, I removed my tie and opened the door. 

There it was, my house. Living room, kitchen, upstairs, it was all just as I had left it. In that moment, I craved nothing more than to lay down on my couch and relax in front of the TV with my wife. 

“Jennie! Jennie, I’m home.” I called out, but no reply came. “Jennie! Where are you?”

But no one responded. I once again remembered how she left, and I felt rage boiling inside of me. 

Stupid fucking bitch, she obviously left for her parent’s house. She always did that whenever we got into a fight, she never even warned me beforehand. Fuck her, why should I worry? Just leave her wherever she goes. 

I kicked off my shoes, threw myself over the couch, and sat there thinking for a moment about this day. Throughout the evening, starting from 4:00 PM, everything was vividly clear. But everything before it was like a week-old dream. It’s impossible to remember no matter how much I tried. 

This day was hell. No point in trying to think anymore. I’ll let the TV do the thinking. 

But right as I turned the TV, the local news shot up with a red band and BREAKING NEWS in bold, white letters. 

“So far, the killer hasn’t been caught, and it’s thought that he fled the city.” The news anchor said, “The Seattle PD are still trying to search for the murderer. But no clues have yet been found. The only piece of evidence is the police sketch provided by the description of a bystander who witnessed the crime.” 

The image was shown, and I instinctively vomited. It was me, it was a very poorly drawn picture of me, but it was me! What had happened, what the hell happened? I feel that I did something, but I can’t remember doing anything! 

Then it appeared, the building where I was working… Fuck, now I remember. I don’t work a lousy job, I’m not an accountant. I’m a manager at the car company I work at. And the Subaru isn’t mine, I remember stealing it. But why the fuck would I do that?

“The Seattle PD however has understood, from co-workers and relatives, that Ms. Katey Kensely was closely associated with the manager of the company, Mr.–”

The remote I threw broke through the TV and shards flew across the room. The mention of her name, and seeing her picture, made me remember it all. That bitch, now I know why…Katey was my co-worker, she was my assistant. I remember getting caught messaging her by my wife.

Fuck, now it all makes sense, I did the only thing that I thought would solve the problem. I felt sick, I wanted to cry, I wanted to scream. I took my phone right that instant and called my wife. 

“Please, please, please, answer,” I murmured those pleas under my breath, hoping to hear her voice until I heard her phone ringing up above. 

I dropped the phone from my hand and leaped up the stairs before barging inside our bedroom. I should’ve guessed from the smell, I should’ve known. The dizziness came back, I vomited again. The heat, the suffocation, the derealization, I felt it all as I saw her torn-apart body lying on the bed. 

Her face was cracked open, the same as with a watermelon smashed by a boulder. Bits of brains mixed with bone fragments and eyes were scattered. Her body was unrecognizable from how brutalized she was. Her torso was split open and emptied as her guts lay hanging and some stepped on and squashed on the floor. Piss, blood, and shit stained the sheets while their foul odor lingered like a toxic, lethal gas. 

Now I remember it. That morning, she fucking provoked me. She screamed at me like always, complaining that I had a mistress when she didn’t even try to show me affection. She provoked me, she made me do it…but I couldn’t help but feel shattered by the sight. I felt unfathomably angry at what she made *me* do, but I couldn’t stop crying and begging for forgiveness as I looked at her. 

“You are fucking sick! Go see a doctor, you fucking psycho!” Her voice rang in my mind, seconds before it followed up with her pained and tortured screams, and so that of Katey. 

My knees felt weak, I collapsed with my eyes fixed on her body, right before I heard something behind me. Right as I turned around, a needle was shot into my arm. I pushed back instinctively but felt weaker by the second before I smacked into the ground, motionless. 

“Man, I really thought they had a lead on me,” I remember that voice! No, I don’t…No, I DO! It was the little shit-face, Liam! But his voice was no longer shy and timid, now it seemed confident and deeper as well. “You have no idea how many bricks I shit when I heard the news. But that was you! You’re one fucked up motherfucker from what I heard in the news.”

He laughed, he laughed as he looked at me, waving a knife in front of my face. 

“I saw it in your eyes, motherfucker. You wanted to kill me.” He laughed, “I told you to not resist the urge, look where it lead you, bitch. You should’ve resisted the urge from the start or let loose completely, but now it’s too late.”

He was carrying his backpack. He opened it, fetched some tools, and finally a speaker. He connected the speaker to his phone and looked at me as he browsed his playlist of songs. He then began setting up a tripod, covered his face with a mask and gloved his hands, and mounted a camera on it before a red light indicated that it began recording. 

“Life’s pretty strange, who thought a killer would be killed by a killer? I killed a lot of people I hitchhiked with, but I don’t think I ever heard a serial killer run by another on accident. But believe me, just because I respect you, I’ll try to enjoy it real good, and your wife too if she ain’t too rotten by then.” 

Sympathy for the Devil began playing on the speaker. He started dancing to the melody as he took the knife, and crept towards me while waving it in front of my face. 

“I’ll try to replicate what you did with your wife, so hold still!”
