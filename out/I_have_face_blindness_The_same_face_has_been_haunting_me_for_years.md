I have face blindness. Due to this disorder, I struggle to put faces to names. Besides my closest friends and family, I am entirely face blind. It's been like this for a while, and I hate explaining my disorder to distant relatives and friends. They all understand for the most part, but it still probably makes everyone uncomfortable in the long run.

To help my case a little bit, I have a notebook full of pictures of people with notations of who they are. For example, I ran into my childhood friend a couple of months back and asked a kind gentleman to take a picture of us together so I could put it in my notebook in case we come across each other again.  The notebook is an affordable way to help me with my face blindness.

One particular day, I was sitting with my boyfriend and puppy at the outdoor section of a cafe, silently watching people walk up and down the Chicago streets. "Dog park after this?" My boyfriend spoke up, drawing my attention away from the street.

"Yeah, Dewey looks like he's ready to go crazy."

I turned my attention back to the people walking and sipped my coffee. Amongst all the people walking past, there was one man that remained still. I scanned the man's body, only to realize his face looked eerie and uncanny. His eyes looked soulless and oddly too small for his face. His hair was straggly and seemed as though he hadn't washed it in weeks. "That guy over there is really creeping me out." I pointed in the direction of the man, to which my boyfriend eyed the area.

"What guy?" When I glanced back at where I spotted the man, he was gone.

"He was just... Never mind, let's hurry to the park before it gets dark."

I took the leash off Dewey, and he took off running. We watched like proud parents as he struggled to play with the other dogs. Dewey, unlike most dogs, is deaf. I found him two years ago on the side of a quiet highway in the middle of the night, and we've been inseparable since.  When I brought him home, my boyfriend was ecstatic about an addition to our new family. He's the cutest little husky-golden retriever mix, and I wouldn't have him any other way.

After about 45 minutes at the dog park, the sun was starting to set. As we were packing up our things, I felt a pair of eyes on me. Thinking it was my boyfriend, I smiled in his direction. He was focused on putting the leash back on Dewey. I admired him for a bit until the feeling of being watched washed over me once more. Eyeing everything, there he was. The man from earlier, just staring. "Baby, that man over there's following us," I said, making sure not to take my eyes off the man.

My boyfriend quickly stood up and walked in front of me. He looked around cautiously before turning back to me. "I don't see anyone, Nikki."

I glanced at him in disbelief before pointing in the direction of the man, who had disappeared again. "He was right there! He must've followed us from the cafe, I swear."

"I think we should just go home," My boyfriend said as I gave him a defeated look and grabbed my keys.

At home, my boyfriend and I were going through my notebook of faces and telling stories about each encounter we had with them. "That was my favorite neighbor when I was a kid, Mr. Lin. He and his wife would give me candy every time I rode my bike to their house, and they'd let me swim in their pool every summer."

"Best neighbors ever."

We chuckled as I flipped through the pages. "This is Misty, my childhood best friend. We used to do everything together before she moved to California."

I skipped a few pages until I came across a picture of the same man from earlier. *What the hell...* I thought to myself. I flipped to a completely new page, and sure enough, a different picture of the man was taped to the paper. *I must've met him on multiple occasions.*

*"*This is the man that was following us, Rudy. I don't know where or when I've seen him, but it must've been important since I have these pictures of him."

My boyfriend sat upright, visibly uncomfortable. "I think you're seeing things, babe."

"What do you mean, these are pictures of the same man that was-"

"Nikki, those are blank pages." He moved away from me and stood up. "Seriously, are you okay? Do I need to take you to a psychiatrist?"

My eyes widened as I stared at the page. The picture of the man was clearly there, but somehow, my boyfriend wasn't able to see him. Looking at my boyfriend with tears in my eyes, I spoke in a frail voice. "He's in here," I pointed at the notebook. "I don't know what he wants, and I don't know why you can't see him, but he's there."

Rudy scoffed. "Nikki, you're crazy! I don't believe you." 

I was sobbing at this point, flipping through the pages. Every once in a while, I'd stop at different pictures of the man. "He's here! And here! And here, too! Why can't you see him?!"

Rudy went upstairs and came back with a bag in his arms. "I'm going out. I'll come back when you've calmed down."

It's been two years since then, and I haven't seen Rudy. He never broke up with me, he just vanished. Sometimes I wish I hadn't talked about the man in the pictures, but I guess I've already sealed my fate. Now and again, I'll see the man standing a ways away from me, just staring. The most unsettling occurrence in which I've seen the man was when I got out of the shower one night and looked in the mirror. He was standing right behind me, and when I turned, he was gone. 

This man's been haunting me for god knows how long, but for some reason, I've only remembered the past two years. I've tried going to the police, but they can't do anything since nothing has physically happened to me. I showed the police the pictures I have of the man, but they insist that there was nothing there. They sent me to a mental institution, claiming I was 'incapable of being normal'. My psychiatrist recommended I write out what's been happening to vent and let things go. If there's anyone reading this that knows what's going on, please don't hesitate to send me a message.
