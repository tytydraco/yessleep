I was 13 when it happened. I was in girl scouts, and the meetings always took place at my old elementary school(for grades 1st-4th). I always found it nostalgic, yet somewhat creepy. My dad often brought me early. I'd let myself in and stay in there for often up to 40 minutes until someone showed up. My dad refused to bring me at the time I told him too. He thought I was being rude. But, this one small problem would become something bigger.

 It was just after daylight savings time had happened. My dad kept telling me it was a week later, but he was wrong. Both my mom and I knew this. He brought me to girl scouts 2 hours early. Said I was only 10 minutes early according to his clock. He was very wrong. I knew that. But, I went in anyways. I found being early interesting. I remember that there was a storm coming. I thought my leaders were crazy for letting GS happen that night. The storm had already started, but it was light. Within 30 minutes though, it had gotten worse. Very worse. I couldn't see outside due to the fast snow flakes. I got a notification from the app that my troop leaders said important info from. GS had been canceled. 

I decided to call my dad, but there was no service. Wifi was very bad there. I decided to leave the school in hopes for better wifi, but to my shock the door was stuck. I cursed under my breath. I was stuck in a school I hadn't really ventured through (besides the art room 2 halls away) for 5 years. I barely remembered where the gym was, let alone any of the important spots (bathroom, my old classroom that always had a box of food in it). I had no idea how long I'd be here for. 

I decided to go back to the art room. All of my things (except my phone that was with me) was in that room. But, to my dismay, while I was on my way there the lights cut. "NO!" I shouted out loud. I was in the dark with nothing more then the slight light of my phone. I scrambled to turn on the flashlight on my phone. But, for some reason, it didn't work. My phone was rather old, and I needed a new one. "Turn on you-" suddenly I stopped talking. I had heard a click. Like a camera. That's when I got an idea. I could turn on my flash and use that as a flashlight! I would delete the photos later.

 I used that to make my way to the art room. Once I got there, I checked my camera roll. My heart dropped. There was a dark figure standing at the end of the hallway in the first photo. I quickly flipped through the photos as the creature got closer, but not close enough to tell what it was. Right before I got to the last one I got a call. 

The name was ">#*÷^(÷&÷(@<÷÷&[÷&÷÷*#^÷*#&#*#*#;#*#&#&92<3[3_3" . The number was familiar as well.  I can't tell you, because it was my friends' number. I thought maybe she was there too. Pranking me. She was in GS too, after all. I picked it up. But, all there was only breathing. It was like an old man and an old woman was both breathing at the same time in the same way. But, that wasn't the creepiest part. 

In the background, I heard my OWN heavy breathing. I mumbled "what the F" to myself and low and behold, in the background I heard myself mumble "what the F". Then, the lights came back. The line went dead. That's when I remembered. There wasn't wifi. How did I get a call? I slowly looked up. I almost screamed at what I saw. The art room's phone was dangling over the desk. I was alone though. I then remembered that there was another door. It was in the gym. An emergency exit. Always locked from the outside, but unlocked on the inside. It led into a field.

 I gripped onto my phone tightly(so I wouldn't drop it) and quickly got up. Forget my coat, earbuds, and sash. I needed to get the hell out of dodge before the lights cut again. I ran into the hallway. I had no idea where the gym was, but I remembered the doors were big and orange. I got around 2 hallways before the lights started flashing. There was snow on the power cord that was weighing down so hard that it was making the lights flicker. I felt the thing running after me every time the lights flickered off. I didn't care though, as the big orange doors were right ahead. The doors were very heavy. Either that, or I was very weak. But, I managed to open them AND actually get a look at what I was running from. I almost passed out from shock. 

There was a very thin and tall creature running at me on all fours. It was unhumanly fast. It didn't have hands or feet. Just nubs. It was slipping as it ran from not having feet or hands. It was white. It had no eyes, but a carved smile. Made from a carving knife. It's loud breathing mimicked that of the breathing I had heard in the phone call. IT HAD BEEN IN THE SAME ROOM AS ME IN THE DARK. 

I ran into the gym as quickly as I could. I almost immediately noticed the emergency door.  I ran as quickly as I could through the gigantic gym and got out. The thing followed me outside. I ran towards the fence. It was dark out, so the thing was completely there. I jumped the fence. It was specifically for small children to not be able to cross without the help of an adult so I easily jumped it. The thing on the other hand did not easily cross. The nubs did not help it. There was a police station across the road. I went in and reported it. I was laughed at in the face and told to go home instead of wasting both of our time. I was never believed and even got in trouble for getting the police involved. I don't know what happened to it afterward.I was 13 when it happened.
