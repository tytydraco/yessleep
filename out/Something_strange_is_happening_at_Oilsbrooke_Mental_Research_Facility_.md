[Part 1]

Doctor Branthor would kill me if he found out I was typing this publicly, but if something happens to me, people need to know that something strange is going on in these woods.

Plus I doubt anyone important at my job surfs online forums, so I should have awhile before I am discovered.



My employer never took the hiring process too seriously. Hence why he diagnosed and hired a paranoid schizophrenic in one sentence. Ever since, I have been working as a surgeon in an over glorified asylum, owned privately by Mister Edgar Oilsbrooke. 

Several times we have discussed the nature of my mind's sickness, and despite my suggestions, Doctor Branthor has assured me that I, and most of the inpatients here at the facility, are suffering from schizophrenic hallucinations, personality disorders and other afflictions or diseases. 

At first I disagreed with the man, but who am I to question such a brilliant mind in his field of study? Only a madman would subscribe to such a foolish belief.

The longer I worked for him, the more I saw the truth. His truth.

Oilsbrooke Mental Research Facility, to me, is paradise on Earth. It's where all the world's greatest breakthroughs in mental health and diseases were birthed, according to Doctor Branthor. 

You outsiders still believe in your own scientists, when in reality, the only truth is what my mentor tells me.

Everyone who arrives here in Lichwood is either sick, or going to become sick. It's best to just tell them how it is.

I often put my patients on edge. Something about my eyes does not instill hope in them. Not much gets to me any more, though. Doctor Branthor explained to me that I am a special case, and that the facility could "use someone with my talents." I trust the man with my life and trust his diagnosis fully.

Three days ago, I finally met a patient that made me feel how all those I put under the scalpel must have felt.

I quite like the catatonic ones, the psychos are always exciting, and those with no condition whatsoever are my favorite. You'll often hear me humming down the concrete and metal hallways of the facility, the notes falling flat, dully vibrating in some of the patient's cells.

That day, though... What I saw truly disturbed me.

I entered the front lobby after my hour long walk up the forested mountainside road. It leads a few miles up and out of the small town that is tucked within a valley with several claw-like peaks that tear imposingly into the clouds and the very heavens themselves.

Our little town in this wonderful mountain forest is called Lichwood.

Lichwood is tucked far out of civilization's prying eyes. It's a place where the devil often treads, shifting silently down the roads and through the trees. 

Weird things happened here quite often. And that day, when I went to visit my favorite patient, I was horrified at what I found.

My favorite patient, Tim Burgeons, was due for his monthly inhibitor replacement. Simply put, once a month I slice open Tim's head and skull to change out Doctor Branthor's treatment.

Tim has a severe case of hysteria and suffers crippling insomnia, often screaming through the night. I usually enjoy the uncompromising screams of despair as I make my way to his room.

Three days ago, it was different. 

I walked down the long, cold corridors lined with unpainted and cracked concrete. The smell of alcohol and cleaning chemicals in the air have stained every surgeon gown that I own, and it only somewhat masks the stench of blood.

When I walked into Tim's room, I knew something was off. He was sleeping in his somewhat ragged bed, and soundly. 

Alarmed, I went over to wake him up. He was sleeping face down, snoring softly and looking at peace. 

When I got close enough to touch his body, I recoiled. On the base of the back of his neck sat a pus filled abscess, as round as a quarter, filled with a greyish yellow substance that glowed with a bioluminescent light.

Occasionally it twitched, and when it did it jiggled like a rancid pudding cup that threatened to burst in the summer heat with a single touch.

It cast a strange illuminating light across the small hairs on the back of his neck. It pulsed just a bit, and a tingling sensation began to flood my mind. Like every neuron was being scrubbed by a horse brush. I wanted to knock it out of my head.

I knew if I reported this to Doctor Branthor, he wouldn't let me do any slicing. So like the good natured surgeon that I am, I donned my scalpel and my protective gear and got ready to operate.

I carefully inched my blade towards the slowly shaking, volatile looking pus sack that glowed dimly in the padded cell. The room was lit only by the abscess and the hallway light. Tim and his bed were the only things locked in this dark grey padded cell with me.

Just as my blade cut flesh, the overwhelming smell of rotted and wet mold or fungus penetrated my senses. I started to fall backwards, but Tim's hand shot up and gripped my hand, closing quick like a bear trap.

It didn't hurt. It mostly startled me. But his grip was like iron, I couldn't pull free. 

The light in the abscess glowed a bit stronger now, casting long shadows across my patient's face like an amorphous mask of darkness. 

My mind felt shakey... well, shakier than usual. Tim laid motionless, and yet I saw a ghostly visage of him contort oddly out of him and look at me with an otherworldly and yet warming look of caring, like a demon that wanted desperately to protect me.

It twisted it's spine with a strange, almost old camera filtered energy crackling about it. It somewhat twitched as it's body pulled itself and spun to look me in the eye.

Tim's voice, although usually filled with terror and despair, slowly reverberated calmly through every cell in my brain. 

It was like I could feel bursts of pressurized energy that pulsed through my skull, like some strange new presence shared it's confines with the other voices.

He said, plainly and bluntly, "Please don't take my Light away, Doctor Luxbury. I don't want to go back to the dark."

His ethereal body twisted unnaturally and tried to pry itself from the physical Time lying on his bed. I was staring into the lava-like yellow eyes of this strange spirit. I almost felt bad for it.

It looked warmly into my soul tried to plea to me.

"If you take my Light, I will go back to blubbering insanity. Please, Doctor Luxbury, let me go." 

His voice was soulful, full of life and newfound love for a world he never really saw in this celestial perspective before.

He let go of my hand, gently. I gave him a smile and looked him in his pulsing energy-like eyes and held the blade up to my lips.

I told him, "I'm going to take your light from you, Tim. I won't let the demons have you. Only science can fix that messed up brain of yours." 

I remember feeling so scared despite my words, watching Tim look up at me with a twinge of sadness and disappointment. Everything was slightly swirling in the back of my skull and my mouth dried as I tried to keep my composure.

Then, sighing slowly, he smiled and closed his eyes. 

The pulsing in my brain trailed along my spine and the walls of my skull like a wave on the ocean as his calm and polite voice rang out.

"So be it, Doctor. Eventually, you too will see the Nectar's Light. We won't force you to, but you will see things with clarity, in due time." 

Despite it's nonchalant demeanor, the weight of his threat was not lost on me.

Tim's crackling and ghostly form pressed back into his facedown body. With gloved fingers, I used my scalpel to slice the flesh around this abscess, deciding to try not to rupture it.

As I finished my cut and used a pair of forceps to slowly peel his fresh flesh from the back of his neck, the vile boil popped with a pressurized squelching noise. I watched the glowing yellow liquid breach the volatile flesh, spreading down the neck and back like an oozing pimple before I could use a rag and alcohol solution to disinfect it.

After disposing of the biological hazard, Tim became his old self again and started screaming madly into the padded walls that surround us. It was the first sweet symphony of many that day.

However, the conversation we had lingered in my mind for the rest of that day... And the next day, things were only going to get worse.



I decided that, despite the fact he was undoubtedly going to be furious with my actions, Doctor Branthor had to learn of my discovery.

I approached the old, gristled man early enough in the day that his black coffee was still steaming in the styrofoam cup that he clutched in his withered hand. 

"Doctor Branthor, yesterday I witnessed a peculiar lesion on my patient, and what I found may intrigue you..." 

I described the previous day's event and watched as his eyebrows furrowed heavily.

In his lively baritone voice, he asked me quite straightforwardly, "Were you just having another episode, Luxbury?" He half joked, half seriously questioned me.

"Sir, I know my demons well. This one was different. I think we may need a priest to expel the ghastly being once and for all. The sigils we drew aren't working."

Doctor Branthor only further shifted his eyes downward as he pondered deeply on my words. His breathing quickened and his eyes kept darting to the little red phone on his desk. 

On it was engraved "Oilsbrooke." It was one of those old rotary phones. Completely obsolete, which always confused me, as Branthor is a man of science and logic.

Yet he sat before me at his desk, muttering to himself that "Mister Oilsbrooke will be most displeased. Very displeased." He wrung his hands in fear and frustration, beads of sweat dripping down his wrinkled face as he stared down at that phone.

He cleared his throat, dismissing me with a wave of the hand. "Go, Luxbury. File an official report on this, be very thorough  and add as much specific detail as you can. Then bring it here, and go home."

My jaw almost hit the floor. In twenty years, I had worked every day of the week, most days with overtime. Oilsbrooke  Facility is my life. But I obeyed, grumbling as I wrote up my report. 

I have never seen Doctor Branthor worried like this in my life. The man was a mentor and acted as a father for me ever since he found me stealing cadavers in the facility graveyard as a young man. 

Certain patients die as Oilsbrooke property and are buried on the grounds for safekeeping, or sometimes, for further brain experiments or surgical practice for new employees.

That night, after resting with a book and having dinner, I found myself walking down the main hall of my home. It's a decent two story place, every American middle class person's dream.
 
The paintings on the wall usually moved about in the dark as I went (if I don't take my medicine.) Tonight, as I walked by, the woman in my lighthouse painting writhed in a mess of dripping oil paint and agony, her face following me down the hall. She always puts a chill down my spine that my other demons don't.

I decided to try and get some sleep around 3 in the morning. As I went to my stairs, I stopped in a daze at the bottom.

Up at the top of the stairs, from outside the window of the upstairs landing, I saw two glowing yellow dots, crackling softly just behind the purple curtains and glass. The light reminded me of Tim the day before. 

Tense energy flowed through my nerves as my blood pumped double time. I reached into my pants pocket, pulling out and preparing my pocket knife to defend myself. 

I have enough demons haunting my every moment, and yet this one gave me the worst feeling of all. I wasn't about to let my fear bring this vile wraith into my life.

In pure animalistic terror and anger, I screamed and ran up the wooden stairway, trying to frighten or kill this demon, or die trying.

I reached the top and without hesitation I stabbed my knife through the curtain and glass, the two orbs staring eerily warmly into my eyes as I did. 

The fabric tore, and glass shattered around my arm. As it did, I felt the bone shattering sensation of my body being torn through the arm sized hole in the window. 

My skull ripped apart against the sharp edges of the window. I felt my eyes trailing behind my annihilated corpse by the fleshy optical nerves.

My body and mind pulsed with that vibrant energy that I loathed so much by now as my body contorted violently, bones crunching as they fought to pass through a physically impossible gap, fighting within my flesh to not damage the glass further. 

I could see Crater mountain far off in the reaches of an empty void. Mister Oilsbrooke stood atop the facility that loomed across the face of the mountain like a wicked omen of death, laughing into the black abyss. 

His head was nothing but a yellow skull that floated independently from it's jaw and the spine, suspended in air. He stood tall over the whole town and kept laughing as the light from the stars above faded into his gaping maw.

My mangled and obliterated body kept falling. Now, a pit glowing with yellow ooze that lines the walls like the blood of a dead god slowly flows deep into the Earth. 

I watch as the doctor's and patients slowly plunge themselves into the depths, their happy and strangely angelic demeanors illuminated by the yellow light one last time as they splashed haphazardly into the pools of ichor below.

The pools grow bigger and bigger as I fall. Then, as I make contact... Everything is light. Warm. Happy. I don't think anymore. The world is gone.



Just when I felt the grasp of unending bliss, I was shaken back to reality as I hit the floor of my bedroom. 

I was sweating like a mad pig, fumbling along the hardwood floor of my bedroom. 

Was it all a dream? It felt so real. Like our realm had been demolished and replaced by some fucked up counterfeit reality that had no natural place in our existence.

The darkened night sky was lit only by a full moon that seemed to stare me down through the single window I had in this room. I tried to slow my breathing. 

I kept expecting the thing to come back, this time peeking into my own sleeping quarters. But he never did.

I decided to stay up that night just to be safe. I looked through some of my collection of demonic wards and sigils and painted a protective glyph at every window and door.


Either it worked, or I really am losing it now. But I didn't sleep again, staying up until the sun awoke from it's own slumber, unaware of the nightmare that shook me to the center of my being.



On the third day, I got up and around early for work. My house groaned and breathed heavily around me as I got ready. 

The grass gave me this strange wavey feeling as it swayed in the breeze. My walk to the facility was the best part of the day.

When I arrived, I was shocked to see an armed guard and a woman wearing a lab coat standing at the gate instead of the normal guardsman. 

The large armed man had a machine gun of some sort and carried a menacing pair of strained eyes and a square jawline riddled with 5 o'clock shadow. 

The woman had a kind and caring look in her eyes, and she looked at her clipboard, flipping down a couple pages.

She smiled and looked at me, her black hair twisted into a tight bun on the back of her head. She was a small woman, but she stood strong. Her name tag read "M. Shaktia." 

"Ah," she spoke in a soft and shakey tone, "You must be Doctor Luxbury!" She shot a gloved hand out and tried to shake mine.

When she saw me just staring at it, she awkwardly withdrew. "I read your report, Doctor. You did the right thing. Reporting this anomaly may well have saved many lives here in Lichwood. 

She gave me a meek but well received smile and gestured towards a makeshift headquarters set up in an emergency tent out front within the fences of the facility.

"You being the originsl witness to this outbreak, Doctor Branthor wanted you to be briefed firsthand today about what happened since your discovery." 

At first I was confused, now I was baffled. Briefed? On a pus filled abscess? 

As we approached the huge tent, a man walked out. The doctor quickly fast walked over to the gate guard checkpoint we just came through.

As he did... That feeling of electrical pressure began to scramble the back of my skull as it pulsed from him, almost encompassing everything in my sight.

No one else reacted to it at all. I was alone in the hallucinations, like usual.

Was any of this real? 

I didn't even have time to react before we were pushing through the flap doors of the makeshift triage headquarters. Doctor Branthor was studying the report with a grim look of determination casting shadows on his skin.

As we walked in, his dark demeanor wavered, and he gave me a small nod and waved us over to the corner of the bustling tent. 

"Luxbury, you look like shit. Didn't sleep again?"

I shuddered thinking about the previous night that I had almost successfully blocked out.

Before he could speak, we heard guards yelling at the gate, and a crowd of scientists in hazmat suits ran out and grabbed the doctor I had seen earlier by each arm. 

He didn't fight back or struggle against them. When they walked past the open flap of our tent, I watched the spirit-like visage of his form twist like a crackling tree being ripped from the ground by some giant monster.

It had glowing yellow eyes that pierced my mind with sadness. It's form was fizzling in and out of sight, and as he walked away, it turned and crackled, looking right at me. 

As he was brought into the other tent, the pulse came again, this time it sent my mind wobbling with fear. I wanted to run home and never return. The sounds of a screaming man bounced off of everything in sight and I had to focus on not keeping over and passing out for a moment.

Just as suddenly as the screaming fear gripped my mind and chilled my spine, after a few seconds, it abruptly vanished.


Doctor Branthor sighed, not acknowledging any of what I saw. "It's been like this since a few hours after you left yesterday. I called Mister Oilsbrooke and updated him on our situation.

After I told him, he got extremely excited and hung up. A couple hours later, miss Marya Shaktia here and her team have taken over our facility."

He motioned to the woman who greeted me at the gate and continued. 

"The problem is, ever since that call, no one has heard from Mister Oilsbrooke. We plan to continue to research and contain this outbreak, despite it showing no harmful effects to the infected yet."

When Branthor finished, Doctor Shaktia spoke up, her petite voice riding quietly above the stirring doctor's and the sounds of medical equipment chirping in our ears. 

"Doctor Luxbury, you are to lead our surgical teams in preventing the abscesses from spreading physically to others. The lesions don't seem to be harming anyone yet, but we aren't taking chances." 

I nodded solemnly. Yes, I was happy about slicing up more patients... But something about the facility shakes me to my core now. 

I occasionally feel the pulses of energy eminating from the facility and from the people around us.

It's like a searing hand is lightly brushing it's way through my head, pulling at a lid on top of my skull every so slightly each time it hits me.

Regardless, I walked right back in and got to work. We didn't have many more outbreaks after that first gentleman was caught, so I hope that perhaps we have things under control. 

And yet, as I looked into the windows on our way to the lobby, I saw it.

Two yellow orbs, shaking slowly behind the curtain. It watched me all the way up the stone path and through the door. Waiting. Watching. 

When I got inside, it had disappeared and I got to work.



I need time to process what I saw in the last three days. I plan to update you on things soon, when I have free time to log it all for you.

No sleep for me tonight. Like Charon on the river Styx, I have souls that need bringing to the lands of the underworld. 

I'll be back soon. Wish me luck. 

Oh, and stay out of Lichwood.
