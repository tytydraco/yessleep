I've never been one to believe much in the supernatural, nor would anyone call me superstitious by nature, but since a certain incident in my twenties, I’ve found myself wondering whether we really are alone in the dark. You see, I worked graveyard shift back then—hell, I still do—and I grew up in a small town in New England. I worked with a buddy of mine, and since we were the only ones in our friend group awake at those hours, he’d often invite me over late at night to hang out until the early morning. 

The thing was, even though I was in my twenties, I didn’t have a car. He’d offer to pick me up sometimes, but out of modesty I usually refused, unless the weather was bad enough to make the walk miserable. It wasn’t a long trip anyway, maybe a bit over a mile, and straight the whole way. I lived on the outskirts of a small city, if you could even call it that. At its largest, it might’ve had twenty thousand residents, give or take. 

My family had been there since the 1930s, starting with my grandmother. She never left, and my father raised his own kind of hell around that same small town through the ’70s and early ’80s. Now, twenty thousand people might sound like a lot to some of you, but in a place like that, it isn’t. In a town that size, everyone seems to know at least one other person in your family. 

The only reason I bring this up is because of what happened one random night on my way to my friend Doug’s place. I’d made that walk dozens of times before and never had any problems. But ever since I was a kid, I’d always been afraid of the dark. It’s embarrassing to admit, but even as an adult, that fear never really went away. 

The walk itself was mostly fine. Quiet streets, a straight shot down a sleepy neighborhood. A little past the halfway point to Doug’s, among all the brightly lit streetlights, was this one house that had a dying streetlight out front. It didn’t stay dead; it buzzed weakly, flared, then dimmed again, perpetually fighting to stay alive. 

I watched a lot of horror movies growing up, and at around 10 p.m., most of the houses were already dark. It always felt like I was the only soul out there. And that flickering streetlight…it scared the hell out of me. Like I said, I’m not superstitious. But there was something about that light, the way it sputtered in the quiet, that made that space feel wrong. It was the same kind of wrong you feel when the victim would enter the room they would be murdered in those old horror movies. You know, the ones with the clueless teenagers, the killer in a mask, and the glint of a hatchet just before the screaming starts. 

But when that one light went out, when it flickered and died for those few seconds, it was different. The darkness that settled there wasn’t natural. It wasn’t just shadow; it was thick and absolute, as if the darkness gave license for malevolence to come alive. For that brief stretch of sidewalk, it felt like the world just…stopped. 

Reality itself would seem to thin out until you reached the safety of the next light. I can’t explain it better than that, just that stepping through that patch of dark always felt like crossing through something. Only briefly abating between the small moments of illumination. Since the road was straight, I could see that spot from a long way off, and maybe that was part of the problem. I’d start staring at it long before I ever got close, like my brain was trying to make it into something more than it was. 

Still, the closer I came, the worse it got. A creeping dread would crawl up my spine when I got within a couple hundred feet of that patch of dark, even though it only took seconds to cross it. 

Every time, I came out fine on the other side. Nothing ever happened. But in those few moments, swallowed by that intermittent inky blackness, I always felt like something was there. Like I was in real, immediate danger—though from what, I couldn't say. 

You have to understand; this “city” wasn’t exactly thriving. It was poor. The kind of place where the sidewalks cracked and stayed that way for years, where the power lines sagged, and the roads only got patched when they absolutely had to. 

So, a flickering streetlight on an otherwise functional street? That was nobody’s priority. It stayed that way for years, maybe decades. 

God, I wish they had fixed it. 

Like I said, nothing had ever really happened there. Just that constant, gnawing sense of dread whenever I walked through. But eventually, like everything left to rot long enough, that much-neglected streetlight finally gave up for good. 

One night, it just flickered…and went out. 

If I thought the dread was bad before, it was nothing compared to when that space fell into permanent blackness. The first night I saw it dead—no flicker, no weak glow, just a void—I nearly stopped walking altogether. Every time after that, I’d slow down as I approached, heart picking up, mouth going dry. I’d tell myself the usual things: Stop being a baby. This is stupid. You’re a grown man, for God’s sake. 

But none of it helped. Standing there at the edge of that darkness, I didn’t feel like a man anymore. I felt like a kid again...small, helpless, and terrified of what might be waiting where the light couldn’t reach. 

Even then, I’d force myself to swallow the fear and just walk through it. It wasn’t far, barely half a minute at a steady pace, and every time, nothing happened. 

This went on for weeks. Same dread, same routine, same relief once I reached the next pool of light. 

Until one night. 

I’d been standing there at the edge longer than usual, caught in that same argument with myself—Just go, it’s fine, stop being stupid—when I finally stepped forward. I was so lost in my thoughts that I almost didn’t notice it at first. 

A voice. 

“Nice night, isn’t it?” 

The words were harmless enough but hearing them disembodied in that thick blackness froze the blood in my veins. The voice wasn’t close, exactly, but near enough. I squinted into the dark and could just make out the faint outline of the porch, the one belonging to the house with the dead streetlight. 

And there he was. A tall figure sitting back in what I could barely make out as a lawn chair, the faint orange glow of a cigarette the only light in the void. 

Here’s the thing—despite all the dread, despite that creeping terror that gripped me every time I reached that spot—in a town that small, you were always taught to be polite to your neighbors. 

So, when it finally registered that it wasn’t some monster speaking to me from the dark, but just a man, I forced myself to answer. My voice came out far steadier than I felt. 

“Yeah,” I said. “A bit cold, but otherwise nice and clear.” 

He didn’t respond right away. I could see the faint ember of his cigarette brighten as he took a long drag, the tip glowing briefly in the dark. After a slow exhale and what felt like an eternity of silence, he finally spoke again. 

“You’re Mark’s kid, right?” 

I froze. 

Mark was my father. Something about his casual tone implied familiarity to me.  Knowing a bit of my mom and dad's history, the realization hit me, this man must’ve known him back in his younger days. It was the only explanation, seeing as my father barely left the house anymore. 

You see, my father was what doctors call a “cardiac cripple.” That’s what they said after his last heart attack. An attack so severe it left him weak, struggling just to get around, his life permanently slowed to a crawl. 

I tried to play it off like I wasn’t startled. 

“Yep,” I said, keeping my tone as even as I could. “Mark’s my dad. You know him?” 

It was a stupid thing to say, he’d literally just mentioned my father by name, but I wasn’t exactly thinking straight at that moment. My nerves were still heightened from hearing a voice out of the dark. 

The man took another slow drag from his cigarette. The ember glowed, then faded again. He sat there quietly for a few seconds before finally speaking. 

“Yeah,” he said, his voice low and drawn out, like someone too tired and oddly sad. “Your dad and I used to party back in the day. Lived like there was no tomorrow. Though… eventually he calmed down and had that family of his.” 

I figured he meant my mom, my brothers, and me. It wasn’t strange. My dad had been a wild one when he was younger. A lot of the older folks in town had stories. But something about the way this man said it—slow, almost nostalgic—made me uneasy in a way I couldn’t quite place. 

“A shame how he died,” the man said after another long pause. “Your dad. I never expected a heart attack to take old Mark down.” 

For a second, I just stood there, not sure if I’d heard him right. Then I frowned. “Oh...no, my father’s not dead. Yeah, he had a heart attack, but he’s doing fine. Well… as fine as someone can be after something like that.” 

The man didn’t say anything right away. The only sound was the faint crackle of his cigarette. Then the ember flared again, one long inhale that seemed to stretch too long, followed by another heavy exhale. 

He didn’t respond. Didn’t move. Just sat there in that impossible darkness...quiet. 

“No,” the man finally said. His voice was calm, too calm. “He died. I remember reading his obituary in the paper. Only happened a week ago, October 16th. Coroner pronounced him dead at eleven a.m.…after his son found him.” 

I stood there, staring into the black, the words hitting me one by one. 

That wasn’t possible. 

It wasn’t even October 16th yet; it was almost a month away. My father had a heart attack four months ago, and he was still alive. Frail, sure, but alive. 

“What?” I managed, but my voice came out trembling. I wanted to sound angry, wanted to challenge the lie, but all I could feel was confusion. Somehow, hearing it in that tone, in that darkness, part of me believed he meant it. 

“Well,” the man said, his tone unchanged, smooth and unbothered, “you look like you’ve got somewhere to be. I’m sure you don’t want to be stuck talking to an old man like me all night.” 

He didn’t move. Didn’t nod or wave. Just sat there, head still, the ember of one cigarette fading as he lit another with slow, deliberate care. 

“Have a good night now,” he added. 

It was then I realized how long I’d been standing there, in that darkness I’d always hated. My skin crawled, a cold sweat dripping down my back. Determined to brush it off as something mundane, something strange. Maybe he was drunk or high and just trying to make small talk. I forced a polite, “You too,” and started walking again. 

I didn’t look back. 

The rest of the walk went on without incident. No more voices, no movement, nothing but the sound of my own footsteps and the rustling wind in the trees. Before long, I was back under the steady wash of streetlights, their soft buzz oddly comforting after what I’d just heard. The darkness behind me felt heavier somehow, like it was still watching as I walked away. 

I’ve always had a bit of a temper, and the more I replayed that conversation on my way to Doug’s house, the more it pissed me off. 

Who says something like that to a man’s kid? Who tells someone their father’s dead like it’s casual small talk? It wasn’t polite. It wasn’t normal. So why the hell was I polite back? Why didn’t I tell him to fuck off and mind his own damn business? 

I kept turning it over and over in my head, trying to make sense of it. But every time I pictured standing there in that dark stretch of road—the glow of the cigarette, that voice—something cold crawled up from my gut. That same dread I’d felt before crept back in, quiet but inevitable. By the time I got to Doug’s place, he could tell right away that something was off. I must have looked pale or rattled, at the very least. 

We walked into his tiny apartment; a cramped little space tucked behind the old comic shop his parents owned. The place always smelled faintly of paper, dust, and burnt coffee. Doug dropped onto the couch, eyeing me with that mix of concern, immediately sensing my unease. “Dude,” he said, brow furrowing, “what happened? You okay?” 

I’d told Doug before about that streetlight and how stupid it made me feel to be scared of it, even as an adult. He’d laughed it off at the time, said he sometimes went for late-night runs himself and that even he found that stretch a little unnerving. So, when I told him what had happened—the man on the porch, the things he’d said—Doug just stared at me, wide-eyed and speechless for a moment. 

“That’s a hell of a fucked-up thing to joke about,” he finally said. 

“Yeah,” I replied, though I didn’t sound convinced. “I’m not sure it was a joke. Maybe he was high, or drunk, or just… burned out enough to believe what he was saying.” 

Doug nodded slowly but kept glancing at me like he was trying to read something behind my words. And for the rest of the night, even as we talked about other things, I couldn’t shake the image of that porch and the faint orange glow of a cigarette floating in the dark. 

As our night ended, marked by the pale glow of sunrise creeping over the rooftops, I said goodbye to Doug and started walking back home. It wouldn’t have been hard to take another route, maybe cut through a side street or two, but that would’ve added time, and I was exhausted. I just wanted to get home the quickest way possible. Besides, it was dawn by then. The streetlights had gone out, and the road was bathed in that soft gray light that makes everything look harmless. I told myself the man had probably gone to bed hours ago. 

I figured I’d pass by without incident, no voices, no cigarettes glowing in the dark. Just a quiet walk home in the morning air. 

There was a steady surge and lull of early-morning traffic—commuters heading to their seven-to-fours and eight-to-fives—and for the first time in a while, I felt completely at ease. The sun was up, the world was awake, and all that nighttime dread felt foolish in hindsight. 

Then, just before the halfway point, I realized where I was. 

I was standing in front of the house with the broken streetlight. 

I’d never really looked at it in daylight before. Without the shroud of darkness, it seemed ordinary enough, just another aging house on a quiet street. Still, something about it drew my attention. I stopped walking and stood there for a moment, taking it in. It looked plain enough in the morning light, ordinary, almost. But the longer I stood there, the more I realized how wrong that first impression was.  

The house looked abandoned, though not completely derelict. It was a tall, two-story place with faded blue paint that had been chipping for what must’ve been decades. Four windows faced the street, two on the top floor, two on the bottom. The lower left one had a corner cracked out, patched clumsily with duct tape and a piece of cardboard that had long since gone soft from weather. 

If anyone lived there, you wouldn’t know it. There were no curtains, no decorations, nothing in the yard, just two old lawn chairs sitting side by side on the porch angled toward the street. I found myself staring at those windows for a long time, trying to see inside. The light was poor, the glass smeared with dust and time, but even squinting, I couldn’t make out any furniture. No shapes. No movement. 

Whoever lived there—if anyone did—either kept things impossibly spartan…or didn’t live there at all. 

Even in the daylight, that uneasy feeling began to creep back in. It wasn’t as strong as it was at night, but it was there, distant but distinct, like a faint echo under my skin. I told myself I was being ridiculous and decided to keep moving. 

Dad didn’t sleep much these days. His last heart attack had left him with a strange rhythm, three or four hours of sleep, three or four awake, like his body couldn’t decide which it preferred. This was usually one of the times he was up, so I figured I’d stop and talk with him for a bit before heading upstairs to bed. Small talk, nothing serious. Just a few words between us before I crashed for the day. 

It felt comforting somehow, the thought of walking into that warm, familiar house after the strangeness of the night and seeing him sitting in his usual spot. I stepped inside and just stood there for a moment, letting the quiet comfort of home settle over me. The speakers of my father’s computer drifted from his room, that familiar sound that always meant he was up and moving. 

“Dad, I’m home,” I called out as I hung my jacket by the door. 

“Good morning, son,” came his reply, steady and warm, unmistakably alive. 

I walked to his doorway, and we talked for a few minutes about nothing in particular. The kind of small talk that fills the space between people who know each other too well to need many words. I found myself smiling, just happy to see him there, breathing, talking, real. Standing in that doorway, it hit me how absurd the night before had been. Whatever that man on the porch had said, whatever I’d thought I’d heard, it was nonsense. My father was here. Alive. Fine. 

I gave him a hug, told him I’d see him later, and headed upstairs to bed. Within minutes, the comfort of the house swallowed me whole, and I drifted into sleep. 

I didn’t have to work that night, I kept my graveyard schedule even on days off. It made things easier than constantly flipping between day and night. Besides, it had its perks. When the weekend rolled around, I could stay out later than everyone else, long after most people were nodding off around one in the morning. 

When I finally woke up, the sun was already gone, and my phone buzzed with a text from Doug: 

“You up for hanging out again tonight?” 

I stared at it for a moment, debating. I had nothing else to do, so I typed back a quick “yeah, sure,” and hit send. As soon as I set the phone down, the thought crept in... the walk there, that stretch of road, the house, and the broken streetlight. 

A shiver ran through me before I could stop it. I tried to laugh it off, but the image of that man sitting in the dark, cigarette glowing faintly on the porch, wouldn’t leave my head. I brushed my thoughts off as absurd. My father was alive, and that was proof enough that the man’s words had been nothing more than some drunken or drug-fueled nonsense. Whatever strange, prophetic tone he’d used, it didn’t matter. He was probably just another lost soul in a rundown town talking to himself, talking to anyone who’d listen. 

Even if he was there again, I told myself I’d just keep walking. No hesitation, no stopping to chat. Just pass by, mind my own business, and leave that gnawing void behind me. 

I didn’t change anything about my usual routine. Before heading out, I checked in on my dad, he was asleep, the deep kind of sleep that comes after one of his tiring brief stints awake where he pushed himself a little too far to stay up. I made him a quick dinner, something simple he could heat up when he woke, and left a note on the fridge like I always did. Normally, I’d just scribble down what it was and what shelf it was on. But this time, without really thinking about it, I added three extra words at the bottom: 

I love you. 

I stared at it for a second after I’d written it, unsure why I’d felt the need. The man’s words from the night before had unsettled me more than I wanted to admit, like some part of me, buried deep down, didn’t want to take any chances. With that, I started my usual trek down to Doug’s house. The night air was cool, the streets were mostly empty, just the faint murmur of distant traffic and the soft scuff of my shoes against the pavement. 

And then, like always, I saw it, well before I reached it. 

That stretch of darkness. 

Even from far away, the black abyss where the streetlight used to glow was unmistakable. It loomed there, a void in the middle of the quiet avenue, like it was waiting for me. It almost felt alive, as if it were taunting me for coming back, or worse, beckoning me toward it. 

Step by terrible step, I approached, hoping the man on the porch wasn’t there again. It was 10:00 p.m., and not a soul, save me, was out on the streets. I reached the edge of the dead streetlight and paused, weighing whether I should backtrack a block and take a detour. I stared into the darkness of the porch and, after a moment, couldn’t make out anyone sitting in either chair this time. 

I built up my courage and stepped into the dark. The quiet night air was broken by the approach of a car, its headlights washing the void with merciful light. As it approached, it began to drift towards my side of the street. I thought for sure it was going to hit that broken streetlight, but shortly before it reached me, the car corrected itself and slowed down to a stop right next to me. 

I was on edge given the circumstances, but it was just my aunt. She’d seen me walking and wanted to ask how my dad was. The relief I felt in that instant, I can’t describe. I hid a sigh and told her he was doing as well as he could, given everything. She asked if I needed a ride, and stupidly I said no, since she was headed in the opposite direction.  

The greatest regret of my life to this day is not accepting that ride. 

We said our goodbyes, and no sooner had I started to traverse the dark again than that same tired voice drifted out: 

“Nice night, isn’t it?” 

To say the blood in my veins froze would be an understatement—I’m pretty sure it hit absolute zero. My head snapped to the porch, and there he was again, the same faint glow of a cigarette hanging in the dark. I told myself I’d just keep walking. That’s what I’d promised myself, just keep moving. Don’t stop. Don’t look. 

So why didn’t I? 

No matter how much I willed myself forward, I couldn’t move. It was like something invisible had wrapped around my legs, holding me there. My mouth went dry, my mind blank. What was I so afraid of? He hadn’t threatened me before. Sure, he’d said some strange, unnerving things, but he hadn’t tried to hurt me. Maybe he was just some old man, lonely and confused, maybe high out of his mind. That’s what I told myself, anyway. 

Finally, forcing the words out through a dry throat, I managed to stammer, “You know… I never got your name, friend. You said you know—knew—my father. I don’t think he ever mentioned you.” 

He took not one, but two long drags of his cigarette before answering; each one stretching the silence into something unbearable. The ember flared, dimmed, flared again. 

“Luke,” he finally said. 

That was it. No explanation, no story, no follow-up about how he’d known my father or when. Just Luke. I don’t know what I was expecting, something familiar maybe? Something that would make the whole thing make sense, but Luke wasn’t it. Despite the fear tightening in my chest, I almost laughed. The absurdity of it, the plainness of the name after all that tension was ridiculous. That brief flicker of humor didn’t last. Because the moment he said it, something in the air seemed to shift. The space between us felt heavier somehow. And though I couldn’t explain why, I got the sense that by speaking his name aloud, he’d won something—like we’d been playing a game I didn’t know I was part of, and he’d just made the final move. 

“You know, Luke…” I said, a chill running through me just for speaking his name aloud. “How exactly did you know my father?” 

Out of all the things I could’ve said in that moment, I wish to God, I hadn’t asked that. 

His voice changed. Low and wet at first, then twisting into a snarl that made every hair on my body stand up. Slowly, he rose from the chair. He was huge. Hulking, wrong. Far taller than any man had a right to be, his outline seeming to stretch beyond what the dim light of the cigarette could possibly show. 

The cigarette burned between his fingers as he lifted it to his mouth one last time, inhaling so hard the ember flared blood-red. Then, through teeth clenched around smoke, he roared: 

“ASK. YOUR. MOOOOOTHEEEER!” 

The sound tore through the air—half scream, half animal noise—and then he moved. He came off that porch like lightning, appendages twisting and bending at sickly angles as they pounded down the steps toward me, and for a second, I couldn’t even breathe. My whole body locked in place, my mind refusing to believe what my eyes were seeing. 

Then something snapped in my head, and instinct took over. I ran.  

I ran harder and faster than I ever had in my life, heart slamming against my ribs like it was trying to escape too. As I broke free from the darkness beneath that dead streetlight, I made the mistake of looking back. He was standing there, right at the edge of the void. Perfectly still. The cigarette still glowed in his mouth, but now…the glow reached his eyes. 

I remember crying. By the time I reached Doug’s place, I was a wreck, shaking, out of breath, barely able to speak. He didn’t ask questions right away, just let me inside and locked the door behind us. Once I could breathe again, I told him everything. Every detail, even the parts that made me sound insane. The man on the porch. His name. The way he changed. The voice. The eyes. I let it all come out because it was impossible to keep inside. Doug just listened. His face was pale; his expression caught somewhere between concern and disbelief. When I finished, he quietly poured me a drink and handed it over without a word. 

There wasn’t much he could say. What comfort could you offer someone describing something like that? I was trembling, half-drunk on adrenaline and fear, more terrified than I’d ever been in my life. All I could manage was, “Can I crash here tonight?” 

“Yeah, man,” he said, without hesitation. He disappeared into his room while I lay down on that tiny couch in his even tinier apartment. Somehow, it felt like it was the safest place in the world. Sleep came eventually, but it wasn’t peaceful. I dreamed of Luke, his wet, snarling voice, and those burning red eyes. 

Doug gave me a ride home the next morning. I didn’t even want to walk past that house, not even in the daylight. 

When I got home, Dad was up. He looked at me with concern as soon as I came through the door. I told him I’d just had too much to drink with Doug, and he accepted it, though I could tell he didn’t believe that was the whole story. I went upstairs, still trembling, and lay down again. Somehow, I was still exhausted, like the fear that night had drained something vital out of me. 

When I woke up, it was late afternoon. The light outside was soft and gold, but for the first time, it didn’t feel comforting. It felt like the day was running out too soon. All I could think about was Luke’s, or whatever the hell that was, last words. Ask your mother. What did that mean? He’d never mentioned her before. Up until that moment, brief as those two encounters had been, everything he’d said had been about my father. 

My parents divorced years ago. I loved my mom, of course, but we weren’t especially close. We’d talk on holidays, birthdays, and the once-a-month call to let her know I was alive. But now, after everything that had happened, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I needed to call her. I sat on the edge of my bed for a long time, debating it, before finally picking up the phone. The line rang a few times, and for a second, I almost hung up. Then her familiar voice came through, light and cheerful as ever. 

“Hi, honey, you haven’t called in a while! It’s good to hear from you.” 

For a moment, I couldn’t respond. I just sat there, listening to her voice, trying to find the words. 

When I finally spoke, I decided to just be direct. 

“Hey, Mom… I know this is kind of a weird question out of the blue, but… do you know a friend of Dad’s named Luke?” 

The silence that followed was immediate, heavy, and it didn’t end. 

It stretched on and on, so long that I had to pull the phone away from my ear just to check if the call had dropped. But it didn’t. She was still there. 

Quiet. 

“Who told you about Luke, sweetie?” Her voice had changed, sharp now, suspicious. 

Before I could answer, she spoke again, louder, almost scolding. “I specifically told your father and grandmother to never to tell you boys about Luke!” 

“Mom—Mom, wait,” I said quickly, trying to calm her down. “Dad didn’t tell me about Luke. Luke did.” 

The silence that followed was worse than before. 

“He lives a little over half a mile down the street from me,” I added, my voice shaking a little. 

When she finally spoke again, her tone had shifted completely, no longer angry, but in disbelief. “Honey, that’s…that’s absolutely impossible.” 

I didn’t say anything. 

“Luke was your father’s best friend,” she went on quietly, her voice trembling. “Back in the seventies. That’s how we met, actually. I was Luke’s fiancée.” 

I blinked, gripping the phone tighter. 

“All three of us partied together for years,” she said. “Your father, me, and Luke. We were stupid back then, drinking, drugs, all of it. But I wanted to stop, to settle down, and Luke…didn’t. Mark, your dad, was in the same place I was. He was getting tired of that life. We fell in love, and Luke couldn’t handle it.” 

Her voice cracked, and I could hear her take a shaky breath. 

“Your father and I talked to Luke, and we ended up having a huge blowout” I could hear her sniffling on the other side of the line. “He started drinking more and more,” she said softly. “Then one night… drunk, he got behind the wheel. Crashed his car into a streetlight.” 

I didn’t breathe. 

“It was right in front of his home on the same street you live on.” She finished. “But honey… that was almost thirty years ago.” 

What she said next sent a cold shiver straight through me. 

“They never fully fixed that streetlight,” she said quietly, almost to herself. “God… since the city fixed it after he died, it’s been flickering on and off every time I drive by it.” There was a pause. I could hear her breathing, faint and uneven, remembering something she didn’t want to. 

“I always tend to think of Luke when I see it,” she added softly. 

I didn’t know what to say. I just sat there. The phone pressed to my ear, as I was staring out my window at the faint orange glow of the horizon beyond the trees. That was when I made the decision that I never wanted to walk down that road again. 

Three years have passed since that phone call with my mother. 

Dad was still alive but getting worse. The times he spent awake and asleep had grown shorter over the years, until his days were little more than fragments; his brief stretches of motion between equally brief stretches of rest. When he was up, he could still move around, do a few chores, even cook a small meal. But the effort always drained him. More often, he’d retreat to his room to lie down again, worn down by his own body. 

It was in the fall when I awoke one day to the sound of his alarm. I had heard it the night before drifting upstairs where my room was but given his even more odd schedule than mine, I didn't find it odd and had fallen asleep.  

When I woke up, I could hear it going off again. For a while, I told myself maybe he’d already gotten up. Maybe he was in the kitchen, or outside for air. There were rare days when he felt strong enough to take the car out, drive down to the corner store for coffee or groceries. But when I listened closer, the house was silent except for the persistent chime of his alarm. 

I walked to his room and pushed the door open. The bed was empty. The window beside it looked out over the driveway, and there his car sat, untouched. Confused, I stepped further inside. The room still smelled faintly of smoke; Dad had never quit, no matter how many times the doctors begged him to. A small ashtray sat beside his computer, a freshly lit cigarette still glowing. It was odd, I thought, because it looked like he hadn't been there for hours. 

That’s when my foot struck something. 

I looked down…and saw him. 

He had fallen beside his chair, one hand still clutching his chest. His face was peaceful, almost resigned. But I knew. I knew the moment I saw him that he was gone. 

My hands were shaking as I pulled out my phone to call 911. Tears blurred my vision for a moment before I wiped them away to see the screen. And that’s when I noticed the date.  

October 16th. 

Luke never said what year.
