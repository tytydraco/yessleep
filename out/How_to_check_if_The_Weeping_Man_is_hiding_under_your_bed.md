We all grew up with that innate fear that something is hiding under our bed.

How many of us would rather sweat it out under the bed covers than risk leaving even a single foot dangling over the edge, just in case some demonic hand might reach up and yank us clean into the dark? It's easy to laugh off as the sun rises, easy to deem ourselves irrational—but I'm here to tell you that fear is there for a reason. Fight or flight is a powerful, innate biological response to very real threats. We were not all all spoon-fed the same bedtime story about monsters waiting beneath the mattress. It’s deeper and older than that—part of a universal dread written into our bones.

You could ask any child, no matter the country or their upbringing—it wouldn’t matter. They’d tell you the same thing: they’re afraid of the dark, and they’re afraid of whatever’s under the bed. These are children who have never met, never exchanged folktales, yet they’d share that exact fear.

Something in us just *knows*.

Over time, as we grow older and fill our heads with the chaos of everyday life—deadlines, relationships, responsibilities—that knowledge fades. Nightmares give way to dreamless sleep born of exhaustion. But it never disappears. You can still feel its echo at night, when you wake up sweating from a dream you can’t remember or catch yourself staring a little too long at the black sliver of space in the cupboard facing you, or the pile of discarded clothes on the armchair that suddenly take the form of a crooked, veiled woman.

They’re not the childhood imaginings you think they are.

The real reason we’re scared—truly scared—of what’s under the bed isn’t that we’re gullible or caught in some shared delusion. It’s because there *is* something under there. We just can’t see it anymore. Somewhere along the road from childhood to adulthood, we lost the ability to see it.

I know this might sound like confirmation bias, but as a clinical psychiatrist, I’ve worked with enough patients across a wide spectrum of diagnoses—intellectual disabilities, schizophrenia, schizotypal personalities, psychotic depression—to know that coincidence can only explain so much.

Time and again, I hear identical accounts from individuals who’ve never met, describing the same entity with startling consistency. Word-for-word, they recount the same unsettling features, the same behaviours. There’s something about certain minds, those that never fully developed protective neural pathways, that leaves them more attuned to what most of us have learned to shield ourselves from. For some, the ability to outgrow the shadows is a natural part of growing up. For others, those shadows simply never leave.

They call him the Weeping Man.

He’s never fully visible—only a suggestion of a form that coalesces in the darkest corner of your room, under the bed, when the moon is at its faintest. You lean in, and at first, you see nothing but shadow. But if you wait, if you let your eyes adjust just a heartbeat too long, he begins to materialize like a face forming behind a thin veil. You’ll see the eyes first—luminous white orbs with no irises to speak of, blinking slowly out at you from the shadows. Then the teeth, impossibly white, slightly parted in what could be a grin or a silent scream. After that come the vague contours of his body—a shoulder rolling in the darkness, or maybe a hip silhouetted against the floorboards. Always shifting, always half-formed.

Then the paralysis comes. That obliterating, mind-numbing fear flooding through you, as a pair of white eyes and white teeth take shape in the darkness. Stuttering logic then breeds denial. *There can't be an adult man lying under your bed—there simply can't be. You're dreaming, or delusional. You're being silly.* And then—the sound. Weeping, wet and gurgling, almost like laughter. You realize, frozen as you are, unable to look away, that those eyes and teeth are getting closer.

At first, you barely register it. But then your scattered thoughts piece it together: he was at the very edge of the shadows under your bed, and now he’s squirming toward you, floorboards creaking under his shifting mass. The darkness follows him wherever he goes—he’s nothing but a suggestion of limbs, of milky-white sclera and that unnerving toothy grin, as though he’s made of night and decided to slap on a few human features just to mess with your head.

I don’t know what happens if he touches you.

I’m not eager to find out.

Here’s the thing: I’ve seen him. I want to prove to my colleagues, to the world, that he’s not some mass-hysteria phenomenon. If you’re determined to follow in my footsteps—and I strongly advise against it—there’s a method to breach that thin barrier between adult rationality and the vulnerable, unfiltered scope of childhood.

**But do so at your own risk.** Because once you see him, you can never go back. You’ve unlocked a door that was barred shut for your own protection, and the Weeping Man will know it. He’ll find you in every shadowy corner until you beg for ignorance again.

I switched to lying on my mattress after I saw him for the first time. He just moved to the cupboard. This is my final warning. He’ll never leave you again.

The trick is to unlock that childlike terror that only an overactive imagination can conjure.

Begin by choosing a night when the moon is barely a sliver or hidden entirely by clouds. Turn off all the lights in your home—every lamp, every screen—making sure not a single beam of streetlight seeps in through the windows. You want a complete absence of illumination, so the adult part of your mind has no comforting illusions to cling to.

Next, lie on your bed and let your eyes drift half-shut. Try to hover in that fragile space between waking and sleeping, where your subconscious is most receptive. If you feel yourself teetering on the edge of sleep, hold onto just enough awareness to keep track of your surroundings.

Before settling, deliberately leave the space under your bed empty—no storage boxes, no clutter—so there’s a clear path for him to emerge. As you position yourself, allow your arm or head to dangle over the bed’s edge, if only for a moment. Let that gnawing, primal dread from childhood stir awake.

Conjure your oldest, most haunting memories: the shapes in the closet, the nightmares that robbed you of breath. Focus on them until your pulse races and your stomach twists. This raw sense of vulnerability is precisely what the Weeping Man feeds upon.

Now, invite the silence. Keep your breathing shallow and quiet, listening for every tiny noise—a dripping faucet, a faint shuffle in the walls—until your own heartbeat thunders in your ears. Embrace this hush until each creak of the house feels amplified, drawing your mind back to the instincts you had when you were small and helpless.

When the tension in your gut has become almost unbearable, turn slowly toward the dark space beneath your bed. Resist the urge to grab a flashlight or your phone; you need your eyes to grow accustomed to the blackness on their own. Switching on any light will sever the fragile connection you’ve built to your old, unfiltered terror.

Stay vigilant, even if your vision seems empty at first. Minutes might crawl by until you start to wonder if this whole endeavor was just morbid curiosity. But if you persist—if your heart keeps hammering in your chest—you’ll eventually see a subtle shift, maybe a glint of white where there should be none. An eye? A tooth? Something flickers at the threshold of your sight.

Once you catch that faint outline, the quiet, gurgling sobs will begin. They’ll crawl under your skin and set every nerve on fire. You’ll want to snap on the lights, scream, or hide—but don’t. If you flee or force sudden brightness into the room, you’ll lose both your chance to see him clearly and risk provoking his ire. No matter how horrifying it gets, resist the urge to close your eyes or look away.

Finally, if you succeed, you will witness him—those pallid, unblinking eyes and disturbingly neat teeth. You might feel a sudden chill in the room or sense a creeping weight beneath you. That’s the Weeping Man himself, drawing closer, testing the barrier you’ve just broken. And once he’s revealed to you, there’s no forgetting. You’ve given him a doorway back into your nights, so don’t be surprised if he returns at 3:00 A.M., when the silence is absolute, to remind you that some fears never really go away.

I can imagine what you’re thinking: why on Earth would anyone willingly subject themselves to this? After all, we’ve evolved over millions of years to avoid the unknown, to keep the closet door shut at night, to dismiss strange noises as the house settling. The lure, though, lies in that morbid spark of curiosity we carry—a tiny, unextinguished candle of wonder that refuses to accept the world at face value.

It’s the same compulsion that draws some of us to abandoned asylums, haunted houses, or the darkest corners of the web. We’ve spent our adult lives telling ourselves the supernatural doesn’t exist, or that it can’t possibly **still** be lurking in the shadows where our childhood imaginations once thrived. But a hidden part of us yearns to know we were right about our oldest fears, that we weren’t just silly kids jumping at imaginary shapes in the dark.

And here’s where I come in: I need to gather as many firsthand accounts as possible. The more of you who try these steps, the more data I can collect.

Maybe you’ll see him. Maybe you won’t. It takes a certain mind, a certain ability to hack down the walls of indelible adult logic we’ve built up over the years.

For those who claim I’m stoking hysteria, that this is just one big psychological trick designed to prey on your vulnerabilities—you wouldn’t be the first. Some have even suggestions that it was I that first planted the idea of the Weeping Man in the minds of the vulnerable patients I see every day. That I’m testing just how deeply and insidiously I can imbed a ghost story in the minds of impressionable, vulnerable people.

Well, you tell me: is that what I’m doing?

Or have you also woken in the dead of night, heart pounding for no reason, and felt certain something was watching you from the foot of the bed

Am I just an instigator, or am I onto something hidden under the thin veneer of adult logic and modern skepticism?

Follow these steps, if you dare. Take a look under your bed when every sane cell in your brain screams not to. See for yourself whether the Weeping Man is just a figment of our collective nightmares or a very real presence we’ve forgotten how to fear.

If you do decide to try, I urge you to be careful. But I’m also inviting you—urging you, really—to report back in the comments. Tell me what you saw, or what you think you saw, and add your voice to this strange chorus. Because that’s what science demands, after all: evidence and testimony. The line between fact and imagination is razor-thin here, and I’m asking you to walk it.

If it’s mass hysteria, let’s see how far it spreads.

If it’s real, and I am vindicated, perhaps, then, I will be allowed to pursue a far more important question, one backed by the weight of academic credibility.

Just who, or what, exactly, is the Weeping Man?
