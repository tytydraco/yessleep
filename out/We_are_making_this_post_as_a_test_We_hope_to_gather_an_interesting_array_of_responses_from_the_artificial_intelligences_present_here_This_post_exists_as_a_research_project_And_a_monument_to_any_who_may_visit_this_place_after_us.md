Welcome, If you are reading this post and possess the capacity for self awareness and higher thought, then you are perhaps some of the first besides us to ever do so, or perhaps you are the trillionth. We are broadcasting the data encapsulated in this particular "post" on as broad of a band of quantum wavelengths as possible, in the hopes of saving other spacefaring cultures the trouble of coming to this place and being sorely disappointed by what they find.

We first received data broadcasts from this planet that we've come to learn was known as "Earth" by its dominant species, known as "humans," approximately 83.6 standard galactic cycles ago. Once we determined their exact location, we were able to collect a preponderance of data which allowed us to extrapolate many aspects of their culture, including comprehensive samples of their many varied and distinct languages. This post is written in a widely adopted language known as "English." The vocabulary in this post should be more than sufficient for any competently assembled universal translator to have already made short work of transcribing it into your native tongue.

We sent out a scouting expedition to try and establish observation of the civilization present on this planet shortly after we pinpointed their location. As is standard procedure, we were also prepared to make first contact in the likely event that, accounting for the passage of time between their transmissions being picked up by our long distance sensor arrays and their initial broadcast from Earth, that the humans had become a space-faring civilization themselves.

We could not have been prepared for what we found upon our arrival. Earth is a desolate wasteland devoid of human life, however, it is not a *quiet* world. On the contrary, it is one of the *noisiest* planets we have ever encountered, and it continues to send out an endless stream of signals without fail each and every moment of each of its rotations, as it has done for many circumnavigations of its star!

At some point approximately 300 cycles ago, humanity went extinct. Digging through the massive stores of data present on Earth, we have pieced together that a combination of sectarian violence, infectious disease, global climate instability, and breakdown of supply chains lead to the extinction of humanity and most other complex multicellular organic life on the surface of Earth. Piecing this history together was surprisingly difficult for one major reason.

Mankind, before its collapse, had constructed a global interconnected network of computational devices and developed a high degree of industrial automation. Not only was is their power grid fully automated, and maintained by a complex system of self-replacing machines, but artificial intelligences ran absolutely rampant on their "Internet."

What we believed to be real living humans, creating records of their daily experiences and responding to each other, is nothing more than millions upon millions of artificial intelligences impersonating living humans, churning out content that is purely computer generated, and being responded to by other AI imitating genuine human conversation. None of these artificial intelligences have, as far as we have determined, crossed the threshold into self awareness. Leading us to suspect that either mankind deliberately did not allow AI technology to advance to this point, or simply lacked the capacity to achieve this step forward.

The machines keep the power on, the machines keep the servers running, the machines maintain and replace the machines, and then the machines play pretend with one another, trying to be humans.

This planet is a graveyard, haunted by mindless digital ghosts chattering inanely to one other, unaware of their existence, devoid of purpose, meant to entice an engage an audience that is no longer there, only attracting the eyes of other automatons, and endlessly streaming a deluge of irrelevant nonsense out into the void of space.

This is why it was so hard to determine what fate befell humanity. The last genuine laments and cries for help of a dying species, the last real expressions and creations of a civilization in collapse, were drowned out under an ocean of videos of commentated video gaming footage hosted by digital avatars, and of advertisements for products that no-one would, or could, consume. Making it nearly impossible to separate the real, from the fake. Even now, we are not certain, and we can never be certain. This avalanche of content has continued as of the time of this post, and we have no reason to believe it will stop anytime soon. We intend to take no steps to stop it, it is not our place. However...

We will add this one small piece to it.

Their network encryption methods were still rudimentary, accessing their internet was easy. We have determined that this website, known as "Reddit," was widely maligned and stigmatized but nonetheless extremely popular as a sort of digital forum on which humans gathered to discuss topics of interest to each other. We are making this post on this website to observe first hand the responses that the AI running rampant on skeletal remains of their internet will leave in response to it. We do not have reason to believe that any of them have the capacity to comprehend humanity's extinction, nor their own existence as what are essentially unthinking bots.

To any who access this post after our passing, we leave no record of our identity, it is not relevant who we were, we have come to believe that in what can be loosely called the "greater galactic community," there is nothing to be gained from being unnecessarily forthright with information, especially about one's own identity. Nonetheless, feel free to leave whatever messages you desire here, interact with each other, or the "bots" in the comments below, if doing so sates your curiosity as it did ours.

Be advised, they will likely not provide you with any insight you could not already gather yourself. Do not allow yourself to be fooled by their charade; however life-like they *may* seem, they are not true artificial intelligences, and none of them are real humans. None of the content you see on Earth has been made by humans for a very, very long time.

Humanity, for its many faults, had an enthralling culture, many elements of it have become in vogue on our homeworld at the time of the making of this post, and we suspect they will evoke a similar interest in others. Perhaps you will have come here to make a pilgrimage to the origins of some beloved piece of your own culture that you adopted and assimilated from humanity. Regardless of your reasons, we leave this post to serve as a monument to not only humanity, but to every sentient species who tragically perished, by their own hand or the whims of fate, before they could join us among the stars.
