Haunted World is a roadside creep show that gets very busy around Halloween time. There's a corn maze, a haunted house, and scare actors who run around terrorizing the guests. But Haunted World has a bizarre set of rules for its corn maze, and they shove them down your throat at every turn.

1. If you get lost in the corn maze, do not cut through the corn stalks.
2. On the chance that you do get lost, don't panic, it will only encourage him.
3. If you disregard the two rules above, you will die.

"What a load of crap," I say, my friend Jenny nodding in agreement. The sign before us is the one at the entrance of the corn maze. This is the hundredth time we've seen this sign since we walked through the front gate, it's posted everywhere. To me, the signs seem like a ploy to build up anticipation for the corn maze. As soon as we walk in there, some high school kid will trail behind us, popping out through the brush, screaming like a loon. I know how this works. Once you've been in one Halloween corn maze, you've been in all of them.

"You ready Jenny?" I say, turning to my friend beside me. I notice a hint of trepidation in her expression, her teeth caressing her bottom lip.

"Don't tell me the signs got to you," I say, my hand playfully slapping my forehead. Jenny peers at me through the corner of her eyes, giving me a smirk.

"Yeah right." She says, backhanding my arm and darting through the maze entrance. She makes the first sharp turn and disappears from view. Not wanting to be left behind, I run in after her. My feet crunch the drying corn husks underneath me, but as I pivot right expecting to see Jenny, the only thing before me is a long corn corridor, the stalks swaying eerily in the wind. I roll my eyes, anticipating Jenny to pop out from either side of the corn wall, inching forward, my fists balled and ready to thump her when she does.

Ten feet down the corridor, I hear rustling to my right and I shoot around ready to throw a hand. The rest of the corn stalks crackle around me. The late October wind swooshing in my ear.

'It was just the wind.' I say to myself. But that doesn't quell my nerves

"Alright Jenny, this isn't funny. You can come out now." I call out, my voice now a little shaky. Suddenly, I hear the dry foliage crunch behind me. I swing around ready to see Jenny screaming in my face, but once again, there is nothing. This time the sound is not easily dismissed, the wind has stopped and the maze is quiet. Too quiet. Not a whisper, not a murmur.

"BOO!" A figure cuts through the corn wall, scaring me and causing me to fall to my ass. When I look up I see Jenny holding her gut, cackling like a madman. I huff in annoyance, a sentiment that goes unregistered by my friend. At first, seeing her joy at my expense makes me slightly angry, but her laugh is contagious and I give a chuckle. She finally, rubs the tears forming in the corner of her eyes, and out stretches a hand.

"You're so gullible. Boo." She repeats mockingly, showing me her curled fingers, imitating a monster.

"Alright, alright that's enough," I say, waving her joke away and finding my feet. I pat the dust off my jeans, but as I do I hear some commotion from the corn. At first, I thought it was my imagination, but when I looked at Jenny, I could tell she heard it too. Her brows slanted and eyes trained on the passage behind us.

"Did you hear that?" I ask, already knowing the answer. Jenny's gaze is pensive. She slowly creaks her head in my direction and the corners of her lips begin to curl. Her worried gaze slowly melts away.

"He's here." She says in a sing-songy tone.

"Oh shut up," I say dismissively while sharing a chuckle. I wrap my elbow around hers, lurching her along.

"Come on, let's get this over with," I say. But just as we reach the first intersection of the maze I hear a neighing laugh, one that makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand. I turn my head and my heart drops as a figure disappears into the cornwoods. When I looked back over at Jenny, I could tell that she did not hear the strange laugh. I swallowed my fear, dismissing it as some scare actor, some high schooler, but the way the shadowy figure moved struck me as odd, unnatural, not human. The corn obstructs my gaze as we round a corner, but my fear lingers.

Jenny and I travel deeper and deeper into the corn maze, trying to find joy in the tall cornfield, but it is nothing more than a lame attraction and on top of it all we can't seem to find the exit. We round corner after corner, but we always end up walking by the same set of corn stalks, though I can't be sure, everything looks the same. Our feet begin to ache, and both Jenny and I were growing tired of walking the same route.

"Fuck this." Jenny huffs, grabbing my hand and trying to pull me through the wall of corn. I instantly tense, pulling her back to me.

"What are you doing?" I say, my eyebrows raised. Jenny looks back at me with a look that says, 'Isn't it obvious?'

"Getting the hell out of here." She says with an inflection in her voice.

"But... what about the rules?" I question fearfully.

"Look who's a stickler for the rules now." She teases, her eyes squinting at me in a mix of amusement and judgment. I brush off her gaze with a roll of the eyes.

"If we don't get out of here somehow, we're going to be here all day," Jenny says, countering my dismissive gesture. I look to the ground, mulling over her logic.

When my eyes return to Jenny, a smile is etched on her face. I give an agreeing shrug, and Jenny pulls me through the first wall of corn, a few ears smacking me in the face as I trail behind her. The corn stalks greet us with their crackling objections as we push them aside, but as we come into a second corridor, I notice an echo in the crunching corn stalks behind us. Jenny hears it too. We both crane our heads toward the little impromptu path we just made. My heart drops as a tall shadowy figure stares at us from the vegetation. The figure freezes, like a cat stalking its prey. A bright white smile inches across the shadowy figure's face, the smile instantly giving way to words.

"Run... now." It says while taking to a sprint. Jenny and I run for our lives, swatting away corn stalks and continuing to cut through the walls of the maze. The vegitation makes it hard for me to keep track of Jenny and I begin to lose her in front of me. The crackling of her footsteps become increasingly distant, but the ones trailing behind do as well. Eventually, I am the only one frolicking through the corn. I burst through a wall of stalks, and enter a large opening. The corn is cut into a big circle, with a misplaced cross in the center of it. I look around expecting something to jump out at me, but nothing ever does. I pan my gaze around the clearing, finding four trails leading to the same intersecting circle.

'This must be the center of the corn maze.' I think to myself. I am slightly relieved to be able to see anything coming at me from afar, but my heart still thumps in my chest. I hear a rustle in the corn and I instantly shoot my eyes to the source.

"Jenny," I call out, but there is no answer. A loud crack comes from behind me and I pivot frantically in that direction, the corn stalks waving at me mockingly.

"Hello?" I say, but I receive no answer.

Suddenly a familiar voice drifts into my ear.

"Help me," It begs. Its Jenny. I turn to my right to see no one standing in the direction of Jenny's plea, but her whimpering tone meets my ear again.

"Help me... please." She says quiveringly. The voice is drifting in from above me. My eyes meet the foot of the wooden cross, and my heart drops when I see a trail of blood streaming down its base. The blood branches off at several points as it oozes down the wood, but I know they come from the same source, the same person. Lifting my eyes up, I see a familiar set of crocs, but they are now stained red with blood. A few drops unglue themselves from her toe. Tears well in my eyes, as I continue to drift up.

I see Jenny's jeans, they are tattered, looking more like mangled rags. Behind the rips, I can see freshly opened wounds, flies already feasting on her flesh. My gaze meets her torso there is a large hole in her abdomen. I cover my mouth in shock.

Jenny's head is slumped down, her arms hung over the two protrusions of the cross. I inch in closer.

"Jenny?" I say cautiously, but she doesn't answer. Only her faint sobs are heard.

"Jenny?" I repeat, but this time she mutters something under her breath as she tries to speak.

"What is it, Jenny?" I whisper.

Jenny's head shoots up as she screams with the last ounce of strength she has.

"RUN!" She screeches. Her eyes looking at me and then past me. My blood chills when I hear the singing of metal behind me. I turn around to find a man wearing a flannel shirt, his head looking to the ground, and a hat obstructing his face. In his hands is a little scythe, he is sharpening it against a rock. I take to a sprint, dashing through the corn, plowing away the springing vegetation, but as I cut through several walls of the maze, I trip falling on my face. I shoot to my back, waiting for the hat-touting slasher to burst through the wall, but he never does. I take to my feet backing away from the wall of corn, but my back meets something slender, something hard. I shoot around, my mind sputtering as I see what is behind me, the wooden cross. I look up, expecting to see Jenny, but she's vanished. There seems to be no sign of her ever being hung from the cross's arms, not a drop of blood in sight.

I take in the view around me and find myself in the center of the maze once again. The same four paths surround the perimeter. I slump down against the cross, trying to catch my breath. My hands drape across my face trying to clear the confusion from my mind. The world is spinning and I start to hyperventilate.

'I must be going crazy.' I say to myself.

A familiar sound slithers into my ear and a chill runs down my spine, it's the singing of metal. I look up to see the scythe-wielding man holding the blade high above his head. I scream as the man brings it down into my abdomen. Blood instantly festers in my mouth, choking my scream. The man pulls the blade from my body, but he never takes a second swing.

I stammer to my feet, fighting to stay upright. This time, instead of darting through the wall of corn, I take one of the four paths on the perimeter of the circle. I look over my shoulder, to find the man is not giving chase. I scurry through corner after corner, but when I round a bend in the corridor, I run into the same clearing in the cornfield, the wooden cross in its center.

"No, no, no," I say in disbelief while holding my wound, the pain coursing through my body. The syncing of metal meets my ear and I pivot around to see the same flannel shirt flash into my gaze. This time the man pushes me to the ground. I try to find my feet, but the man kicks me down. The best I can do is crawl. The figure trails behind me, savoring the sight of my desperate attempt to get away.

He chuckles as I beg for my life.

"Please, don't kill me," I say in desperation. I reach the wall of corn stalk and start to push the vegetation aside, but before I can vanish into the brush, I feel a hot sting coming from my thigh. I look down to see the dagger protruding from my flesh. I am dragged back into the circle of corn, the man now towers above me.

The figure finally raises his gaze, and when I see what this thing is, I scream. This is no man, it is a scarecrow, with a very human smile. I kick my feet wildly, trying to get as far away from the thing as I can, the scythe cutting into my legs, and blood oozing out of my wounds. I see the scarecrow's fist balls up, lifting it high above its head. It brings it down with fury, smashing it against my face. The world instantly goes dark.

My head is pounding. Brief flashes of light start to cut through the darkness as I fight to open my eyes. The world sounds distant, muted. Faint murmurs begin to reach my brain. When I manage to open my eyes, I am looking down at my feet, but they are not touching the ground, they are swaying in the breeze.

My jeans are tattered and my legs are cut up. My abdomen continues to bleed, and I'm extremely weak. I force my head to the side, finding that my arms rest atop two wooden perches. I manage to look up and see Jenny standing in the clearing in front of me. My first instinct is to plead for help.

"Help me," I say fragilely. Her head shoots in my direction, but she fails to look up toward me.

"Help me... Please." I quiver. But Jenny doesn't understand. She begins stepping toward me, slowly, cautiously. A shadowy figure steps out of the corn behind her. I recognize the flannel shirt immediately. I try to warn her but life seems to be fleeting. I open my mouth but the word spills out as a garble. The shadowy figure pulls its scythe, twirling it, getting ready to cut Jenny open.

'If I don't warn her, she's going to end up like me.'

With the last ounce of strength I have. I lift my head and shout at the top of my lungs.

"Run!" I scream, looking over her shoulder to find the scarecrow sharpening its blade. Jenny instantly turns and disappears into the corn, but the scarecrow doesn't run after her, it steps up toward me.

It now playfully pats the blunt side of the blade against its palm. He turns his head up toward me, giving me that white smile. The blade raises above its head and it plunges it into my heart. The pain courses through my body, but the pang gives way to a warm sensation that washes over me. I look to the sky, at the clouds dancing overhead. I turn to the cornfield, the stalks swaying in the wind. I look back at the scarecrow, who now grins from ear to ear. Suddenly the world goes black, everything is dark, all is quiet.

Out of nowhere, life roars back into my eyes. I give a gasping inhale as if bursting out of a body of water after my head's been forced under for hours. The sound of thrill seekers shouting at the top of their lungs rushes into my ear. A scare-actor's chainsaw sputtering in the background. Regaining my bearings, I see the entrance of the corn maze directly in front of me. I look over to my left to see Jenny's bewildered expression. She looks in my direction, and a look of pity washes across her face as she recounts seeing my body hanging from the wooden cross, that same look on my face.

Without saying a word we turn around and start to walk away from the maze entrance, but a familiar figure steps in front of us when we do. It's the scarecrow. His button eyes look at Jenny, then pan over to me. A smile inches across his face, we stutter backward, but his gaze looks past us.

"What a load of crap," a voice says from our backs. I know that voice, it's my voice. Jenny and I turn around to see two girls who look exactly like us staring into the maze's entrance.

"You ready Jenny?" My doppelganger says.

"Don't tell me the signs got to you"

"Yeah right." Jenny's twin replies, slapping her friend on the arm.

Jenny's doppelganger runs into the maze, and the girl who looks like me follows her in. Jenny and I turn back to the scarecrow. The scarecrow starts to walk forward, splitting through Jenny and me without saying a word. When he reaches the maze entrance, he turns, giving us an eerie smile.

"Boo!" Jenny's voice shouts from somewhere inside the cornfield. The scarecrow creaks its head back around and vanishes into the vegitation.

Jenny and I stand there for a long time, replaying the horrific memories. We finally look over at eachother and each gave an understanding nod. Without saying a word we left Haunted World and never went back. I am writing this as a warning to anyone reading this, never go to Haunted World, and never go into that fucking corn maze.
