I work fire lookout shifts in northern Arizona. Pine country, high elevation. Isolation is part of the job—most nights, it’s just the crackle of the radio, the hiss of wind through the pines, and the occasional coyote. I’ve been here long enough to recognize every sound this forest makes. Or at least, I thought I had.

Two weeks ago, I saw something on the ridge west of my tower.

At first, I thought it was a hiker. Tall, lanky, moving slow through the trees. I grabbed the binoculars, logged it, called it in. That’s standard procedure. Except it was close to midnight, and that ridge doesn’t have trails. No one should’ve been there.

I kept watching. The figure stopped between two pines. Perfectly still.

It tilted its head, like it was listening.

When I tried to radio again, the signal cut into static. A second later, I heard my own voice echo back over the frequency:

“Everything’s fine. Just logging it.”

Those were the exact words I’d spoken a minute earlier.

That’s when it screamed.

Not an animal scream. Not even close. It sounded like something trying to force words through a throat that had forgotten how to use them—half-human, half-animal, all wrong. The sound clawed at me in a way I still feel when I try to sleep.

By the time I steadied my hands and looked back through the binoculars, it was gone.



The next morning, I asked the rangers to sweep the ridge. They didn’t find hikers. Didn’t find campers. The only thing out of place was an elk carcass, ribs splayed like fingers, hide hanging in strips.

The kill didn’t look clean. Not torn by wolves. Not eaten by scavengers. The cuts were messy. Almost deliberate.

That night, I kept the spotlight sweeping the treeline. For hours, nothing. Just the sway of the pines and the quiet weight of the dark.

Around 2 AM, I caught something crouched just outside the edge of the light.

Not an animal. Not a man.

Something in between.

Its skin was stretched too tight, like it was wearing something that didn’t belong to it. The face—if I can even call it that—looked borrowed. Lips crooked, jaw unhinged too far, like it wasn’t built to stay attached.

It mouthed words I couldn’t hear. But I felt them. Deep in my teeth. In my bones.

Moments later, it bolted, moving faster than anything should be able to.



Two nights later, one of the ground crew went missing.

We found his truck abandoned on a service road, headlights still burning, engine still running. The driver’s side door was wide open.

The snow around the vehicle was covered in footprints. Bare feet. Too long. Too many.

We found him three miles deeper in the forest.

He was strung up in a ponderosa pine like someone had tossed him there. Throat gone. Tongue left whole.

The snow at the base of the tree had been disturbed. Smears of blood and dirt traced into words:

“IT WEARS YOU.”



After that, I stopped sleeping.

Every night, I heard it closer. Sometimes it circled the tower, breathing under the floorboards. Sometimes it whispered my name in voices that belonged to people I knew—my brother, my old supervisor, even my own.

One night, I broke. I whispered back.

“What do you want?”

It answered in my voice:

“Let me in.”



I filed the report. Asked for reassignment. Base denied it. Said the evidence was “inconclusive.”

So I stayed. Kept watch. Waited.

The following week, venison disappeared from cold storage. Not cut, not bitten. Torn apart by hand. Fingernails embedded in the fat.

Tracks led from the locker straight to the tower stairs.

Halfway up, pressed into the wood, was a face.

Not carved. Not drawn.

Pressed. Like something with no skin of its own had leaned hard enough to leave an impression behind.

It looked like me.



That was four nights ago.

Since then, the tower has gone quiet. Too quiet. No radio chatter. No animal sounds. Just me and the trees, and something circling when the sun goes down.

Last night, I woke to the sound of footsteps on the stairs. Slow. Heavy. Pausing between each step like it was waiting for me to move first.

I gripped the rifle and kept the spotlight trained on the door.

Soon after, I heard knocking.

Not on the tower door.

On the glass right behind my head.

I froze. Didn’t breathe.

The knock came again, louder.

I turned.

There was a face pressed to the glass.

My face.

Only the eyes weren’t mine.



This morning, base called. Said they’d gotten reports of me transmitting all night long. Calm, steady.

“It’s fine,” they said I told them. “Just logging it.”

Thing is… I never touched the mic.

The radio’s been dead for days.



I should’ve left. Packed up, climbed down, and never looked back. But the forest feels wrong now—like it’s waiting for me to try.

And tonight, it’s worse.

The air is heavy. Still. The treeline looks closer than it did yesterday.

About an hour ago, I heard movement below the tower. Not circling this time. Climbing. Nails on wood.

I stayed at the top of the stairs with the rifle leveled.

Something paused halfway up, breathing like it had lungs too big for its body. Slowly, the breathing shifted—until it matched mine. Inhale for inhale. Exhale for exhale.

I backed away. Waited.

After a moment, the sound stopped.

When I checked the stairs, nothing was there.

But on the landing, scratched into the wood with something sharp, were three words:

“YOU ARE TIRED.”



Now it’s past midnight.

The spotlight just flickered. My reflection in the glass isn’t lining up anymore. It’s smiling when I’m not.

I keep catching glimpses of something tall between the trees. Something wearing pieces of me that don’t fit right.

And every time I blink, it’s closer.

Not in the treeline anymore. Not outside.

In the tower.

Standing just behind me.
