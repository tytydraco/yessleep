I love being a teacher. Waking up every morning and seeing all my students is the highlight of my days. Each student is very different from one another, and I'm not going to lie, there are certain students I do favor over the others. I have one student with whom I bond the most. She always arrives to class on time and looks very put together. She doesn't wear baggy hoodies and pajamas like the other kids. Her hair always falls perfectly with her curls neatly tamed. She always says thank you and tells me to have a good day at the end of each class. Heather is just a role model student. Every teacher wishes for students like her.

Today I went to the teacher's lounge like every other day to eat lunch. I switched who I sat with very frequently because they all tend to get boring fast. Today I sat with Mrs. Crow, a young, newer teacher. She began talking to me about how she's engaged and showing me pictures of her fiancé. 

"Are you seeing anyone," she asked

"No.” I responded not trying to entertain this conversation.

She leans towards me touching my shoulder. “Don’t worry, I'm sure you'll meet someone soon. When you know, you know, or at least that's what happened with my boyfriend, I mean fiance.” she said, letting out an obnoxious laugh.

“Have you been in any recent relationships? Sorry I'm just so nosey! Just excited to get to know my new co-workers.” she said while playfully punching my shoulder.

“I was married, but things didn't end very well after she cheated on me.” I responded, unsure why I told her that.

“Oh my god. I'm so sorry!” she responds while covering her mouth with her hands.

After she let me get a few words in she continued talking about herself. I sat there pretending to listen while reminiscing about my past relationship while it's now on my mind. I started to feel myself getting angry, then I remembered some coping techniques I learned from my support group. I got up and walked away trying to contain myself from saying something I'll regret. 

After school a few students stayed to make up a quiz. I always bring snacks and drinks for the students, I find it helps them do better. After about 30 minutes, there was only one student left.

"Are you sure you don't want some soda? It's the last one left." I asked while reaching for the sprite.

"I guess it won't hurt," she responded.

I cracked open the soda and slipped a pill in there while she was too focused to notice. I hand her the soda and she continues working.

"Already I'm all done.”

I grabbed her quiz while I asked “ You were absent Tuesday, right?” She nods her head yes.

I walk towards my desk pretending to look for the graded quizzes.

"It looks like I left them in my car. I could give it to you if you don't mind walking there with me?"

"Sure. I've got nowhere else to be." She exclaimed.

We step out of the classroom and start heading towards the side door. I look down at her, and see the top of her head with her bunny hair clips, barely reaching my shoulders. She's so cute and small, I just wanna pick her up. We finally reach my car and I unlock the door. I open the door and “accidentally” drop my keys.

"They're right on the seat If you want to start looking for your quiz," I stated while bending down to grab the keys.

As she reaches into the car I push her as hard as I can. Her backpack flips over her head forcing her into my car. Am I really doing this right now? At school? I slammed the door and drove away as quickly as possible. She started to yell and bange on the windows. Thank god for my investment into tinted windows. She started reaching up towards me and covering my eyes. I grabbed my coffee mug and hit her in the head. I didn't want to hurt her, but she left me no choice. After about 10 minutes of me fighting with her while trying to drive at the same time, she finally collapsed onto her side.

I pull into my garage and think about how to get her inside. I guess I could just carry her. She's small, right? I step inside to make sure there's no one home.

"Hello?" I asked

"Hey, how was work?" my sister responded.

"Really good," I responded, not trying to show my panic.

"I've just got a lot of work to do. I'll be downstairs."

“Do you have your group meeting tonight?” she asked

“No, tomorrow morning I think.” I responded while trying to sit Heather up.

I finally get a good grip on her and slowly carry her through the garage door and down the basement stairs. I’ve done something similar to this before, but I still couldn't help stressing. My sister never comes down here because this is technically my part of the house. I pay for the basement, and she knows I don't like when people mess with my stuff. I always lock the door and she just never bothers me. It's kind of an unspoken agreement we have.

I gently place Heather on the floor. She's so pretty when she's sleeping. I go into my workshop and grab an old chain and lock I've had. I don't want to do this Heather, but I have to, at least until I can explain what she's done wrong. I sit on the couch and accidentally doze off.

I finally wake up after about what felt like 5 hours and look over to the floor, she's still lying there. I checked my phone and it's been almost an hour. When will she wake up? She's been passed out for over two hours now. I didn't think it’d last this long. My stress has been getting in the way of my excitement, but I'm eager now. I can't wait to see her journey. The basement of my house isn’t very nice, but I hope she won't mind. I have a special surprise for her. There's one other room down here and I've spent almost a whole year renovating. I didn't know I'd be getting it ready for her at first, but as time went on I realized how perfect she'd be to bring to Father Michael. I tore out the wooden panel walls and painted them pink. All girls like pink. I hope she likes it. I remember this one shirt that Heather would wear often. It was skin-tight with a little bunny on the right side. Sometimes when she’d stretch in class her shirt would roll up and I could see her belly piercing poking out. I bought her a bunny stuffed animal because of this shirt. I hope she likes that too. I lay on the couch impatiently, thinking about how excited she's gonna be for my surprise. As I'm laying there I hear a quiet sound. 

“Hello.”

This didn't sound like Heather. Heather had a loud strong voice. My heart started to beat uncontrollably fast. What should I say? Do I sit up? Do I go up to her? I started to panic. I have to respond soon. I got up and stood behind the couch. I wanted to go to her. Tell her everythings gonna be okay. Once she sees her surprise I know she's going to be thankful. 

“Hey Heather?” That's all that I could say. What am I doing? Why did I only say that? She responded very quickly asking where we were. I didn't know what to tell her. Her new home? 

She started freaking out and kicking her leg, realizing she's chained. Ugh. I hate this part. Last time I made the mistake of bringing someone a little younger, she wasn't as mature. When I brought her here she had whined and cried for hours, I hope Heather isn't like that. 

“It's okay. I've got a surprise for you!” I unchain her leg and guide her to her new bedroom. 

“Do you like it?

She never responded.

“You don't like it.” I said, trying not to show my frustration.

“No I don't. I'm not staying here. I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with you and why you brought me here!” she yelled 

I don't like being yelled at. She should know that, no one does. Father Michael says that no woman should raise their voice at a man, and that they must be punished to learn.

I push her onto the bed and tie her arms and legs to the end of the bed posts.

“Look Heather. I don't want to do this, but people need to be punished so they can learn to never do that again.” “You understand that right? I would never want to intentionally hurt you if I didn't have to. It's Father Michaels rules. You'll understand when you meet him”.

She started to yell, which just made me more angry. I cover her mouth so she can't make any noise. I started thinking about how unloyal and sneaky she was, which made me act on my anger. I go into my bathroom and grab a pair of scissors. I slowly cut into her toe nail. I started pushing closer and closer to her skin, trying to take up the whole nail. She started moving her legs. She was resisting. The only good thing I could think about when having a younger girl is that she was smaller. Easier to tame.

After only successfully ripping off three toe nails I stopped. I put the, now chipped nail polish toenails into my pocket. I'm never going to really see her feet, so I don't mind damaging them.

“Now, do you understand why you can't be rude? People have feelings, and you hurt mine.” 

She nodded in agreement.

I sat in the chair in front of her bed. I just wanted to watch her. I didn't like watching her struggle, but I liked seeing how much she was going to change tomorrow. I decided I'm going to take her to michaels tomorrow. Last time I brought the other girl, Beth, but he didn't like her. I hope he likes Heather as much as I do.

“You better get some sleep. Tommorrows a big day.” I told her. I watched her as she fell asleep. She looks so peaceful.

I wake up from the sun shining through the corner of my window. I look at Heather. She's awake. I check my phone and it's 9:30 am. I better start getting her ready. I opened the closet and grabbed the nicely hung outfit and placed it on the bed. A flowy white dress with a pair of red flats.

“I'm gonna untie you now , but you must behave. You know how I feel about being disrespected.” I slowly untie the knots I made at the top of the head board. Once I'm done she sits up. She hasn't looked at me since last night. 

“Now I'm going to turn around while you put this on, ok? I asked

She nods yes while staring at the floor. 

After about 5 minutes I heard a whisper. “It's on.” 

I said out loud the only thing that had come to my mind. “Woah.” 

I grab Heather's wrist and start heading up the stairs, turning the corner to see if my sister's car is here, it's not.  Heather hasn’t said anything in awhile, I hope she's not sad. I lead her into the car and wrap rope around her and the seat just to be safe. I put tape over her mouth and got into the driver's seat. The drive to see Father Micheals group is around 25 minutes. On the way we pass through the desert and closer to the mountains. Heather remained calm. As we finally arrive I pull into Michaels driveway. I get out of the car and open Heather's door. Before I could even get her untied I turned around and saw Michael standing right behind me. 

“You startled me Father Michael.”

“ How have you been John, I missed you!” He says to me.

“Good, happy to be back.”

“Well look at that, she's gorgeous!” He says well, patting me on my back.

“The groups all inside, eager to start.” He exclaimed.

He reaches into the car and starts stroking her hair. I'm happy he likes her. We pick her up and bring her into the back room. The back room is a big open space that Father Michael has dedicated to our group meetings. Along the walls are pictures of our family, all 63 of us. It's kind of crazy to think that this started with just 12 of us, now our families grown. We place her in the middle of the room. The other members are all here and ready to begin.

“Now if everyone could thank John for bringing this lovely lady,” Father Michael states while clapping. He's such a good guy. He makes me feel proud of myself, I can tell he really cares about us. 

Everyone is looking around on the edge of their seats antsy to begin. I look at Heather and I can tell she's starting to freak out. Her hands are fidgeting behind her back trying to release herself.

“Now as you all know we've had 10 new members join this past month. This is their first times at a ceremony, so we're going to take things slowly.” Says father Michael.

Heather starts freaking out more and manages to roll over. This interrupts Father Michael and makes him angry. He walks towards her and stomps on her hand while telling her to be quiet. He picks her up and puts her back sitting up in the seat. He grabs her face and rips the tape off, allowing her to speak. She sits there quietly with tears running down her eyes.

“Now Heather, why don't you tell everyone why you're here.”

“I-I-I don’t know.” She stutters.

“Come on now, That's not true. John told me about your friend Alex.” Father Michael states while walking in a circle around her.

“My boyfriend?” she asks.

“Ah so you do know why you're here?” 

“N-n–no-o.” She says while sobbing

“We know what you did. John, why don't you go and explain to the group how it happened this time.”

I never got to share a story before. Most of the other members work in very different environments so they tend to have more run-ins with situations like this.

I stood up and turned to the group, “ I caught Heather being unfaithful to her boyfriend.” I could see everyone's faces mixed with anger and excitement.

“Now do you know how hurtful that is? How would you like it if someone cheated on you?!” Michael asked while his voice got increasingly louder.

Heather remained silent.

“You know I was cheated on after 5 years of marriage while having 2 kids.” 

I love when Michael tells this story.

“Do you think that's fair?! DO YOU?!”

“No, But I-.” Heather started to say with tears rolling down her face before being interrupted by Father Michael.

I hate to see Heather upset, but he's right. I was cheated on three years ago, and it was awful. Women really can't just be loyal can they? Not even for family? It's honestly disgusting.

“Now although you’ve made a mistake, we're giving you another chance.”

“You get to be our wife.” Michael said as all of us started clapping and cheering. 

I'm happy this is working out. Last time when I brought Beth there had been a mix up. I'm friends with her father and had walked in on them kissing. I knew that wasn't right because he was married. When I brought her here and explained it to Father Michael he got very angry with me. He told me that this time it wasn’t the girls fault. It was too late though. I felt bad, but how was I supposed to know? He made an exception and we had trained her to be the perfect wife. She was doing great at first, but then things took a turn… We let her use the bathroom alone after 3 months of earning our trust and she had slit her wrists. We were all very sad because this was our second wife we had lost. We've been sharing one wife with all of us, but now that we have new members we decided we needed someone else. 

I reached my hand in my pocket and started playing with her toenails from the night before. “Heather dont worry. This isn't your fault that you were born this way, but we’re here to help you now.”

Father Michael grabs her chair and drags her into a connected room. We all form a line and get ready to take our turns. It's finally my turn and I walk up holding a surprise behind my back. 

“I brought you a stuffed animal bunny. I remembered how you liked them.”
