   If the title if the only thing you read, please heed it. This is not a fictional story. This post is not for the majority who reads it, but for the rare few who will relate. If you too see 'Them', the only way to escape them is to ignore. 

   The Dark strangers, or commonly known as "Shadow People", are often seen as harmles apparitions. I've seen countless posts of users encounters with these entities. The overwhelming majority have no overall impact, or lasting damage.

   Many who encounter the Dark Strangers will only see them once, or in passing glances. They will appear once or twice during childhood, and then become hazy memories. 
   
   For the rare few, these entities will cling to you like a lingering stench. I've been desperately searching for others like me, who are afflicted with this issue. 

   The Strangers will always appear the same: A tall shadow formed, opaque body.  Black voided eyes, with no other facial features. Hands with spindly long fingers, and no distinguishable lower half. 

   I've come to notice that each person will only engage one individual Stranger. You will never see a different one. No matter the situation, or number of years. The Strangers are entities of habit. 

   My Stranger, I've affectionatly named, "Mr.Him". He has visited me from early childhood. He will come during all hours of the day. 

   I have found that each time you give them attention, it will ensure another encounter. Each encounter will always be more extreme than the last 

   After initial contact, the Strangers will begin to personally interact with you. This can range from objects being thrown in your general direction, to brief touches. 

  If you are currently at this point, I beg of you to please ignore them. You must advert eye contact, and insist that nothing is wrong. There is no one there. 

   I was not aware of how to get rid of them. I would learn this too late.  Unfortunately, my encounters would become more extreme. 

   Mr.Him was a devout shadow. His encounters began with staring contests when I was a mere 7 years old. He would then gift me with cat like scratches. 

   I couldn't help but to keep watching him. At 10, I was gifted with a bite mark. It was so severe, I was taken to the hospital. The doctor asked my mother if I had been attacked by a horse. 

   My next encounter was at 12. He spoke. Barely more than a whisper. There were no words. Honestly, he sounded similar to radio static. 

  I reached my breaking point at 15. I was hospitalized for extreme anxiety.  There, I was given medication for my "encounters". It appeared to cease further contact. 

   Mr.Him came back at 18. At this point, I chalked it up to childhood trauma.  I did not believe in the silly shadow standing in the corner. I refused to acknowledge the bites, and scratches. Or even the mangled radio talk. 
     I do not know if the Strangers feel anger or human emotions.  But when I refused their existence,  Mr.Him took offense. At 18 years, Mr.Him pushed me down the flight of stairs in my house. My grandmother witnessed it. She described me being lifted, and thrown like a ragdoll.  
  
My parents moved me to live with my eldest brother, while they had the house "cleansed".  It was as this point my brother admitted to seeing the Strangers too. 
  
   He believed he was the only one. He felt guilt for not knowing what was happening to me. But it wasn't his fault. Would you really belive someone if they told you the things I have? No. You would assume a mental health issue, or a vivid imagination.  

   He taught me how to make the Strangers go away. And which I will share with you. Even if you do not relate, or understand.  I truly believe there are more people like us. 

  You have to ignore them. You must treat them like nothing, for they do not exist. If you see them, advert your eyes. Show no emotion.  There is nothing there. 

   It is important to note you will have to do this multiple times, before you receive results. I cannot stress this enough, but it will eventually work. Your Stranger will leave. Mr.Him left me for 6 years.

   I don't want attention from this post. I don't care to validate myself or others fantasy ideas. I want to offer genuine help to those like me, who have suffered from the Strangers.  

   But I have made a mistake . I recently turned 23. It has been so quiet, so mundane. Everything that occurred feels like nothing more than a dream. 

    I have made a mistake. The shadow in the closet looks too familiar.  The hum of radio static feels like nostalgia. 

  I have made a mistake.  And I can't ignore Him in the corner.
