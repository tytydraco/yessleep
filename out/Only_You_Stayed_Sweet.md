“I was made to love you, couldn’t help it if I tried.” – Yazoo

The day program didn’t smell like syrup.

It smelled like a changing table that hadn’t been wiped down in years. Like piss baked into plastic and shame. Like someone sprayed bleach over something that had already rotted through.

The kind of stink that hangs in your nose even after you leave.

The staff were worse.

One stunk of weed and cheap cologne. The other… they smelled like they’d just fucked in the “individuals-only” restroom, wiped off on a glove, and walked back out smiling.

I was just there to shadow one client.

Just one day.

His name was Devon.

⸻

Devon wasn’t what I expected.

He was older than most of the clients—mid-thirties, easy. Tall, narrow, with a face like he’d aged too quickly and stopped halfway. His hairline was giving up. He wore a pink camisole over cargo shorts and had syrup packets jammed into both socks like they were part of his treatment plan.

He was humming the Mr. Rogers theme under his breath. Off-key. Soft. Persistent.

When I walked over and said, “Hey, Devon, I’m here to hang out with you today,” he stopped humming.

Just stopped.

Turned to me like I’d interrupted something ancient.

“You’re new,” he said. “You’re soft. They like soft ones.”

And then he smiled.

And kept humming.

⸻

They asked me to ride the bus with him back to his group home after day program.

“Easy overtime,” they said. “Just keep him from licking the windows.”

Devon sat up front on the van. I stayed two seats behind. I watched him the whole time.

Ten minutes in, he turned and looked at me over his shoulder.

“We have to check on the chest,” he said. “I have a big mouth.”

I laughed. One of those fake what-the-fuck laughs.

He didn’t.

⸻

The house was spotless. Too spotless.

Sterile lighting. All white walls. Cameras in the corners. Furniture that looked like it belonged in a dentist’s waiting room, not a home.

Devon’s room was across from the med closet. Twin bed, plastic shelf, no lock on the door. His closet was empty except for mismatched socks and two pairs of stained underwear.

I asked the night staff what I was supposed to do.

She handed me a clipboard and said, “If he escalates, redirect him. Don’t let him touch you.”

That was it.

⸻

2:11 a.m.

I woke up to dripping.

I didn’t hear footsteps. I didn’t hear breathing. Just the slow, steady sound of liquid hitting tile.

Devon’s bed was empty.

I followed the trail.

The bathroom door was open.

He was standing in the dark—completely naked—his back to me. A pair of women’s underwear clutched in one hand. The other was moving in tight spirals across his chest, dragging a puddle of syrup with it.

He wasn’t looking in the mirror.

He was looking through it.

His lips weren’t moving, but I heard his voice.

“The sweet hides the rot. They like it sweet. Don’t you like it sweet?”

The mirror fogged from the inside.

⸻

The next morning, I checked the staff files.

I didn’t find Devon’s folder.

I found mine.

⸻

⸻

That day, they told me I was Devon’s full-day shadow now. “For continuity.”

At the pharmacy, he licked the blood pressure cuff.

At the diner, he told the waitress I was his brother.

She just nodded and said, “You’re the new Devon.”

No one corrected her.

Not even me.

⸻

Second night.

I woke choking on stillness. The kind of still where you can hear your own heartbeat, and it doesn’t feel like yours.

Devon’s bed was empty again.

The bathroom door was cracked open. I pushed it.

He was sitting on the tile, cross-legged, surrounded by teeth.

Dozens of them. Human. Yellow, black, chipped. Still wet in places.

He was carving a mouth into his chest.

Real lips. Real blood. Stitched crudely with floss. A row of the teeth had already been forced into the wound like rotten pearls.

The mouth opened.

And breathed.

It spoke.

In my voice.

“You’re late.”

Devon looked up. Syrup stained his chest like a bib.

“I made a better version of you.”

⸻

I ran.

Out the door, into the night, barefoot.

No one stopped me.

People smiled as I passed. Waved.

“Devon, where’s your helper?”
“Devon, don’t run off!”

I screamed, “I’M NOT DEVON!”

A nurse stepped out of a transport van. She smiled at me like I was five.

“That’s not an I-statement, buddy.”

⸻

Now I’m in a new room.

No door handle. No corners. A plastic mattress. Fluorescent lights that never turn off.

They call it “Devon’s Room.”

They give me syrup in paper cups and tell me I’ve been “so brave.”

There’s a notebook on my lap. Half the pages are already filled out in my handwriting.

One says:

“Devon writes good. Syrup helps Devon be quiet.”

Another:

“Devon doesn’t scream. Devon builds mouths.”

⸻

I remember a birthday.

Not mine.

A white cake in a Tupperware lid. No candles. Just melting icing and a fly.

Devon—or maybe me—sat there staring while the staff laughed in the next room.

That’s the only birthday I remember now.

Maybe it was mine.

Maybe he gave it to me.

⸻

A tech brushed the hair from my face today.

She smiled like she loved me.

“You’re doing so good, Devon. Your compliance is improving.”

I smiled back.

I think I meant it.

I don’t know if she was real.

⸻

There’s something under my skin.

Tight. Hot. Stitched.

I peel back the gauze on my chest.

Teeth.

A mouth.

It hasn’t opened yet.

But it’s learning.

⸻

Final Entry – Client Note: #73 “Devon”

🖋 Scribed 4:30 a.m. in red ink and sugar-thick fluid. Tone: Compliant. Progressing.

⸻

They said I was soft.
That’s why they chose me.

I’m not soft anymore.
I’m just sweet.

There are more mouths behind the wall.
Behind the syrup.
Waiting.

I think I was someone before.
But Devon’s mouth talks louder.
And I’m learning to like the taste.
