Life can be hard. Relationships might be tumultuous. There can be a major strings of events that could lead to a nasty break-up.

  
One word comes to mind if I describe my relationship: toxic. She made me feel I wasn’t good enough and all the things I did for her were not enough. Why don’t you give me more attention? Why are you always working late? Why aren’t we going on more vacations? Every single thing I did didn’t satisfy her enough. She would wait for me everyday and yap in my ear.

  
With the passing of time, it got worse and worse and it culminated in our break-up yesterday. She threw things at me, screamed, begged I wouldn’t leave her, said she would  get better, she would do better. 

  
“I will change, I promise!” she cried, right before her nails scratched my face. She left the house with nothing but the clothes she had. “I’ll come back later when you’ve changed your mind, darling.”  


The first major mistake I did was not calling the cops. I said I’d deal with this myself. She was crazy, but she would stop at some point. 

  
She called me 119 times, sent me 452 text messages and left 85 voice messages in just two hours. I didn’t pick up and didn’t reply to any of them. I confess it scared me, but a cold shower chased the fear away. 

  
I took a quick nap because the events made me feel very exhausted. After coming back to reality from the land of dreams, the silence of this house felt too heavy on my mind and soul. It was as if living in a tomb. After all those years of arguing and not being good enough, the silence felt comforting, yes, but still would take me a long time before getting used to it.

  
I picked up the phone, called my best friend and asked him if he wanted to meet up. He told me that he had just fired up the grill and I should join him for burgers and drinks. Said and done. Got in my car and drove to him.

  
“Hey dude, you look like shit,” he said to me.

  
“Thanks, I guess.” I replied.

  
“What happened to your face?”

  
After I told him, he patted me on the shoulder and gave me a hug.

  
“It’s the best for you, dude. I never wanted to interfere or give you any unsolicited advice, but I could see that you were so fucked up,” he said. He popped two beers open and we toasted to better days and a brighter future.

  
When you have fun, time passes by in an instant

  
“Alright, dude. This was fun. Let’s do it again soon.”

  
“Always great to have you here, man. We should meet up more often. Wanna hit the movies on Saturday?”

  
“Sure.”

  
When I got home, I almost puked on the floor. A vile odor hung in the air—rotten, deathly, not from this world. I saw muddy footprints on the floor. They led up to the kitchen.

  
I said hello but got no reply. In there, all tattered and torn, my girlfriend Abigail stood motionless before a boiling pot of food.

  
“Where have you been, Michael? Where you out cheating on me with some whore?” she asked.

  
“How did you get inside, Abigail? What’s this, are you crazy? I am calling the cops right now, this is wrong.”

  
“So you aren’t denying it. I thought so. My gut is never wrong, Michael. That’s why you don’t love me anymore. You love someone else. That’s okay, though. You will love me again.”

  
She turned around holding a knife. She was… wrong. She had dirt under her nails, her bloodshot eyes moved like crazy and she had strange symbols carved on her arms. Rotten leaves adorned her hair and the clothes she had on stank as if she been dead for a week. Maybe she was? 

  
I felt afraid not only because I saw her like that, but because I sensed that something else might be in the house with us. Maybe it was inside Abigail?

  
“What is this, what did you do to yourself?”

  
“Oh, this? It’s nothing. I just went to the woods and talked with the trees there. The voices told me to get this offering on my skin for the forgotten gods there. And so I did! Now sit down. I will bring you food.”

  
“Abigail, I just ate… We need to call a doctor. You’re not right in the head, sweetheart. You’re talking nonsense.”

  
“Don’t sweetheart me. I am just upset. You are upset too, I understand. But I get you a hundred bucks this food will make you feel better. Now sit down.”

  
In a bowl, she gave a strange stew-like concotion. I could see long hairs, chicken feet, with a dash of basil. The brown liquid still boiled and its miasma felt like coming from beyond the grave.

  
I sat down, with one hand in my pocket, trying to dial 911. She got the knife too close to my neck and I gave up. She told me to eat. I said no. The blade pushed just for a bit against my skin and blood came out.

“Do you think I’m joking? Eat it and you’ll love me again. I promise you.”

  
I gave up and ate. Every bite was caustic. It made me sick beyond comprehension. It burned my throat. My stomach hurt so badly, and I felt death was just around the corner.

  
I felt dizzier. It was time to leave the world behind. 

  
“What did you put in this?”

  
“Oh, just a few drops of my secret ingredient. Go to sleep now, honey. You’ll feel better when you wake up.”

  
\*\*\*

  
Right now, he is still sleeping. I don’t know why he still has his eyes open. He is foaming at the mouth. His skin is all purple and the blood vessels in his eyes are broken. Maybe he didn’t like the way I cook. 

Maybe I put too much of that liquid in his food. 

  
Oh! Thank God, he is waking up right now! 

  
“Do you love me now, Michael?”

  
He nodded. 

  
It worked! Oh, now we’ll be together [forever](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostMortem33/)!

  
I guess every relationship has its trials and tribulations, but if the two love each other, they’ll brave any storm and make it work no matter what.
