I go to a private type of boarding school where everyone has their own small room. Its not particularly old, scary or haunted , at least that I know of, but there is a  "horror" legend that almost everyone knows. It goes that every night a demon comes and checks up on you to see if you meet some random made up "guidelines" but doesn't do anything , which probably comes from the fact that teachers used to check up on us at 8 and a half pm , and every once in a month or so, a bigger scarier demon comes and if you don't meet the guidelines it does something. There wasn't a permanent thing he does. Nobody except elementary kiddos and some early middle schoolers believed it. As a year 9 I knew it was bullshit .

I don't remember all the guidelines but there was some about not sticking your limbs out of your blanket, not having plushies showing,wearing socks or some shit like that.

I shared a bigger room then normal with my roommate , Julia , a year 10 but she was shorter then me and dumber. Her dark brown curls were mesmerizingly poufy but somehow still defined, she had a big ass so boys came over almost every day to make out with her and sometimes fuck . It was annoying at the start but i got used to it by putting on some music and headphones. I was dealing with some mental health problems at the time so I used to blur out her making out with sh. She definitely knew since one day when I came from class there was a razor on my bed. Pretty sure she put it or at least a boy that came over. It didn't matter to me since I got extremelly  angry and threw it out.

One day me and Julia came from dinner and went to bed immediately. It was maybe about 9 and 40 pm. I have insomnia so i didn't fall asleep but Jul was also awake because she was texting. There was a loud knock or maybe a punch to the door which freaked out both of us. Then the tapping on the window started. CRASH. Someone opened the door and pushed something to the floor. Julia was screaming but then she stopped. Deafening silence filled the room . I opened my eyes and saw a tall, slim black figure standing over her with some kind of rod coming from the floor puncturing her chest spilling blood everywhere. The impression on her  face was just heartbreaking even though i didn't care for this girl at all. Blood everywhere. It looked sticky. The figure turned around. I mean i don't really know if it did because it had no face. My fight or flight instinct kicked in and i reached for the razor on my nightstand and threw it at the creature. It screaked in pain and growled. In an in instant everything associated with Julia disappeared . Not just her and the rod but her stuff. The expired mascara on the floor, her KISS poster, the  victoria's secret bras next to the mascara which have not been washed since they have been bought. Everything. At this point it was about 10 pm.  I ran out the room to the girls next to us and asked them if they have seen Jul. Not just her stuff disappeared, even the memories of her too. I asked teachers, boys she came home with and everyone else i could. Nothing. It was like she never existed.

Ive moved schools since but this still haunts me,the picture of Julias bloody body,her soulless eyes filled with black.
