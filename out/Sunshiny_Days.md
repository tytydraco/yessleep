Dairy was the specialty. The Johnston Family Creamery. I was completely ignorant to it as a kid, but you’ve probably seen our cheeses in your local grocery store, especially if you live in the Oklahoma area. It wasn’t until later in life that I was made aware that the business was so lucrative that my parents could’ve afforded to put me and my sisters each through college without a loan. 

But that’s beside the point. I’m not here to tell you about my family drama, even if I personally find it more interesting than the thing outside the window. 

My first ever memory was of the thing. I don’t know what it is. It took me a while before I was even confident that it was all one entity. But I digress.

I must’ve been three or six or somewhere in between. It was bright outside, I remember that. My mom was busy cooking. I was sat at the dinner table, my back to my mom and my eyes facing the window. I was coloring mindlessly when I saw it, looking over occasionally to watch Blues Clues on the TV that sat in the living room.

It looked like a boy around my age. Brown hair, neatly combed. Piercing green eyes. Dressed in a red t-shirt. I waved at it, and it waved back. It smiled shyly at me. I don’t remember it leaving; I never do. I blacked out, I think. The next thing I remember was my mom snapping me back to reality as the Education Connection song played on the TV.

It was only years later that I questioned how a toddler like the boy I saw could’ve been completely visible from the waist up through I window that was six feet off the ground on the outside. Ever since then, I’ve been living with the thing.

The next few encounters that I remember happened all the same. Sometimes it was a boy my age. Other times it would be an old woman. A few times, it was a donkey. Once, all I saw was a gigantic scorpion tail. Every time, it was sunny outside. It would always be outside of a window, and I would never see the lower half of whatever it was trying to be. If it was in the form of a quadruped, it would still be standing upright like a person.

The first noticeable shift in the encounters that I remember was when I hit puberty. I was figuring myself out then. At first, it appeared as attractive women. When it realized that women weren’t my thing, it started appearing as men. Muscular types, flexing their biceps and grinning. Trying to appeal to whatever it thought a hormonal gay boy would want. It continued that way up until I was sixteen or so. Without fail, on a sunny day, averaging about one occurrence per month, some picture of masculinity and virility would show up at my window. Whenever it decided to leave, I’d black out and it would just be gone. The problem with that was that I lived on the second story, and there would’ve been nothing to climb onto to support it.

I only ever brought it up to my sisters. I’d ask them if they ever saw anything strange at their windows on sunny days. They both said no. Whatever it was, it was focused solely on me.

My level of concern has fluctuated over the years. There would be periods of weeks or months where I’d be unbothered by it, followed by long stretches of living in fear of seeing it again, followed by periods of being super pumped to see it.

Once I turned sixteen, it began to appear more frequently. Once a month became once a week. It would stay for longer and had more variety in its appearances, which sometimes were grotesque. One encounter that sticks out to me happened in October of what would have been my junior year of high school. From the shoulders down, it looked like a fifties housewife. From the neck up it was a giant crow. The part animal part person forms became its favorite during my late teens. A little girl with crab claws, a giant red ladybug with an old man’s head.

I guess now it would be chronologically appropriate to tell you that my mom passed when I was eighteen. She had a brain aneurysm, and my dad was so upset by her passing that he drank himself to death within a year and a half. My sisters and I sold the rights to the Johnston Family Creamery brand to some slimy investor and liquidated the cows and the equipment. My sisters moved out, but I stayed behind.

The thing may have been the reason I stayed, I’m not sure. I can’t think of any reason other than the thing outside my window to keep me in the house where my parents both died.

I never moved to the master bedroom. I just remained in my childhood bedroom.

Ever since my sisters left, the thing will appear any day when the sun is out. It’ll follow me to any window and it’s become even more experimental. Last month it showed up to me as one of men from my puberty years, but with his entrails spilling from his broken jaw as he flexes still. I don’t know why it went from trying to appeal to me to trying to scare me. I don’t even try to explain it to myself anymore. I’ve lived with it long enough that it’s just a fact of life now. When it appears as a giant wasp with fleshy tumors all over itself, I don’t bat an eye. That’s how it showed itself yesterday morning. Even this afternoon, when it appeared as my parents crudely sewn together, it didn’t really bother me.
