After the last job I was so mentally worn out I took a break for once. 

Sorta.  

Allie came by so we could start picking up trash together. It seems like he got a small place so thankfully he was off the street. He was paying for it with the funds he had made from the trash cleanup. It may sound like an easy task but it was hard work. He needed to avoid regular people due to his appearance not being fully human.  His smaller body made it hard for him to lift heavier items like thrown-out couches and furniture. I helped him cut the larger items into smaller pieces so they would fit inside his wagon. He felt bad that I was helping so much and he couldn’t pay me much. I tried to refuse any kind of fee for this work. I just needed something to clear my head.  

From the sounds of things, he was making new friends at his place and was well-fed. That took a load off my mind. I had worried a great deal about him sleeping on the streets or going into a forest for clean-up. Al was so small any threat could snap him up in one bite.   

We parted ways for the day, and I did my walk around the park near my apartment. It was spring but I still needed a jacket for the evenings. I still had a few hours of daylight to clean up the area a little bit. My name was called out by a person I didn’t think I would ever talk to let alone see him out and about with no supervision.  

“Lock?” I asked feeling a little stunned.  

He had changed his appearance a little. His long golden hair had been cut into a short bob. On anyone else, the hairstyle might not look great, but he was the type of person who could pull off anything.  He looked slightly younger than before. At first glance, it would be difficult to know his gender. Or at a second glance. He wore an oversized cream-colored sweater that exposed his collarbone and a black ring around his neck. The binding ring was far stronger than the one that bound August and April. A set of rings was also around his wrists under thin golden bracelets. I glanced down to see he had sandals on with another set of rings around his ankles.   

Lock was a very strong creature. I doubted the amount of binding was enough to keep him out of trouble.   

“Do you have a few minutes to talk?”  

Slowly I nodded shocked he was asking permission.  

“What’s up?” I asked trying to get my thoughts in order.  

“I wanted to thank you for slapping some sense into me.” He answered without a hint of shame.  

“Huh?”   

This was completely not what I expected him to be like.  

“Do you know what kind of creature I am?” He asked sounding a bit smug over the answer I didn’t know.  

I shook my head unsure.  There were so many different types of supernatural creatures. Not all the species have names, and some were called different things depending on the person who encountered them.  

“I’m a creature made of pure magic. I only take on a body to interact with the rest of your lesser flesh wads.  You meat bags have become jealous of the fact we’re so perfect you’ve sought us out and locked us away. The only reason why I didn’t take over countless worlds in the past is because I respect the balance the Silver King has created.”  

I patiently listened and fully understood why he had so easily been infected by sin.  I looked him over and noticed he had similar features to the man who sacrificed his family to bring Lock into this world expecting a promise of power.  Lock must have absorbed their bodies to create a solid form.   

“I understand you were sealed away but I’ve been wondering about that. If it was The Corporation that created the seal, then why was it required to kill someone innocent to release you?” I said and his face slightly fell.   

He had an expression I never expected him to wear. Lock was a bit ashamed over what happened. The beatdown might have given him sort of brain damage. Could a creature like him care about someone he saw as lesser?  

“That was unfortunate.  It seems like over time the wording of the requirements was mistranslated, or he was given the wrong information on purpose. To release me I needed to see someone’s pride. He didn’t properly perform what was required however it was enough to weaken the seal. I regret I didn’t arrive on time to stop that killing.”  

I crossed my arms seriously confused over his change of character. Last time I saw him he wanted to take over the entire world and almost did so. 

“Do you really mean that?” I asked wondering if he was putting on an act.  

If he had been weakened in our last fight it was possible Lock was behaving until he regained his strength enough to cause trouble again.  

“I’m not good at knitting.” He shrugged.  

I really wasn’t following his line of thought. I let him keep speaking.  

“How strange is that? I’m the closest kind of creature to what the Original Silver King was. A being of pure magic and talent. And yet, I couldn’t instantly pick up a skill that a hunk of meat can do. It’s not just that. Since I’ve been inside this body I’ve realized there are so many things I cannot do that humans, and other supernatural creatures are able. Isn’t that amazing of you all? You're not perfect like myself and yet you all have different talents. If I wiped out the entire world I would have destroyed so many different skills, I’m not aware of.  It’s a bit of a tragedy people died to bring me here. I wonder what they were good at.”  

That was unexpected but at least things appeared to have turned out fine. Lock would be a good asset to The Corporation and hopefully would value human life enough to save it. I assumed he just wanted to come by and thank me, and I got ready to end our conversation. He noticed I was about to leave and quickly cleared his throat with arms crossed to catch my attention.  

“You know, good actions should come with a reward. I have put in a great deal of effort in behaving,” He announced as if I should know what he wanted.  

He came here for a reason, and I didn’t have a clue what it could be. After all, what could a broke Contract Worker give a person like this?   

“I said I’ve been working hard on behaving.” He repeated sounding almost nervous.  

“Ok...” I replied slowly and turned to face him. “What do you want for a reward?”  

His lips appeared tight as if it was hard for him to just come out and say it. Lock glanced to the side unable to keep eye contact as he spoke.  

“My brain seems to be a bit fuzzy at the moment. Maybe you should give it a small slap to help restart it.”  

A heavy silence came between us.   

I suddenly knew why he was here but didn’t want to accept it. My hand felt dirty just thinking about his request. I considered walking away however Lock was a powerful creature. Just because the Sin infection was broken didn’t mean he was weaker. He could cause a great deal of trouble if he didn’t get his reward and stayed in line. It sucks it had to be me.  

Carefully I reached over and gave his cheek a very small tap with my fingertips. Just enough so he could feel it. Lock made a noise that made my shoulders tense up and I vowed to never give into his demands ever again.   

From the looks of things, he greatly enjoyed a lesser creature harming him. He enjoyed it a bit too much. Within a few seconds, I mentally packed all that away praying I would never need to relive this trauma.  

Lock uncrossed his arms when he spotted something behind me. I heard my name, and I turned around expecting it to be work-related.   

Instead, I got a stomach full of pain. Someone had slammed a paper spell hard against me stunning me long enough for them to get another attack in. A second spell was forced on my forehead. The magic fried my brain in half a second causing everything to go dark. Ito’s threads could heal physical damage. But I wasn’t immune to certain spells or magic overloading my system. At least Lock was strong enough to get away to alert someone of what just happened.  

I woke up in a damp dimly lit space. A thick rope tightly bound my wrists behind my back. The room appeared to be an unfinished basement with a dirt floor. A small dusty window let in orange light, so I hadn’t been out for very long. A small noise came from my side. Glancing over I stared in disbelief.   

Lock sat against the grimy cement wall; wrists wrapped with a delicate silver chain. Certain creatures could be completely immobilized by silver or iron. But you needed to get it on them first.  

“Why are you here?” I hissed at him.  

“Aren’t these your friends?” He answered back clueless.   

I held back anything I wanted to say to focus on the issue at hand. There were three other people inside the room. A man with greying hair sat at a fold-out table quietly playing cards with himself. His back was turned toward us, so I only saw half of his face when he moved to place cards down. I knew him from somewhere. He appeared mostly human. From the looks of things, he wasn’t even a half-breed.  

The other two were some sort of supernatural creatures. The one near the far wall fidgeting while staring at Lock had a long neck and limbs. His skin was a glossy pale white with hints of scales. His hair was dark and messy with long animal ears coming from it almost appearing like horns. His legs didn’t appear to match his body. They looked too long and bowed for him to walk properly.  

The other person had more of a human appearance. A black mask covered the lower half of his face. He removed it to speak and to see my reaction. His jaw had been replaced by another that already was rotting away. Dark claws scratched at the stitches as he looked us both over.  

“For a Hunter, you were easy to scoop up. Not getting enough sleep lately?” He mocked in a low raspy voice.  

It was hard for him to speak and yet he still did so. I glanced between them all trying to see what the threat level might be. Aside from the man at the table, these creatures appeared to be mules.   

There is an unknown number of different supernatural creatures. Species had long since started to breed with each other creating entirely new creatures without names. And they continued to create larger families making it impossible to ever categorize the type of creature you might come across. Most could be labeled under an umbrella term like vampire or werewolf. Even then, there are so many different breeds of werewolves. And vampires. At least for the most part if you knew the vague idea of what the creature would fall under you had an understanding of their strength and weaknesses.  

Mules are creatures who have parents that can create offspring, however their traits don’t mesh well together. Mules can rarely have children but that’s the least of their worries. Most of the time their bodies are at war with themselves. They end up with parts that don’t match or powers in conflict with each other. I’ve heard most Hunters look down on them and don’t see mules as a threat. They assume they’re not able to use their powers to their full potential. Normally underestimating them was a mistake. 

Sweat started at the back of my neck. There would be no way to know what powers these two had. It could be anything.   

Our kidnapper didn’t like being ignored.   

“Do you think you’re better than us and don’t need to worry?” He asked with a slight annoyance in his voice.  

“I assume if I had something to worry about it would have happened by now.” I answered back still trying to figure out their plans.  

“The extra one is pretty. Can we keep it?” The creature on the other side of the room asked. 

Lock shuffled a little bit closer not liking the look he was being given.   

“No, that little thing will be worth something. Not as much as our damaged goods here, but it’ll be enough to keep us fed for a while.”  

These three had no idea how strong Lock was. If they did, he would have been hauled off to be sold for all sorts of purposes. Every part could be made into a weapon or turned into pure magic as fuel. Aside from a meal I didn’t think my body had any value. So why bother going after us? Why keep me alive? The answer came through my clouded thoughts, and it caused my stomach to tighten.  

“Oh? Seems like you now understand the situation you’re in. Honestly, you should be thanking us. There will be so many different types of creatures desperate to get their hands on you. From what I heard you don’t mind that sort of thing.” He said pausing from a coughing spell that turned into laughter.  

The rumor of my bloodline hadn’t been confirmed. Yet I didn’t do myself any favors by living through so many world-ending fights. Certain families supernatural and Hunters wanted that sort of power and would do anything to get it. I’ve heard of places that would rent out creatures with desirable traits. No matter how hard The Corporation worked to shut them down, they still popped up. If I didn’t get away, I risked ending up in one. Not to mention whatever plans they had for Lock. I only hoped they just wanted to take him apart to sell.  

I needed to think of a way out of this. I might be able to take down the creature in front of me. But the other two were too unknown right now to risk it. The best idea was to try and buy some time. Lock was a powerful creature. His absence would be noticed. How long had he been permitted to be away from his handler? A few hours? A day? The creature in front of us got down to our level so he could further get under our skin.  

Lock looked worried. Right now, his strength was limited by the silver. I wondered if he would let these two do anything they wanted to him because he just enjoyed being slapped around a little. Any thoughts I had were derailed by the next sentence the kidnapper spoke. 

“After breaking and tossing away your little doll this will be a chance to get a few new ones.” He laughed the sound grinding away on my every nerve.  

I didn’t think about what to do next. A blackness came to my vision. I lost the next few seconds.  I was sitting on the ground wrists bound then I found myself standing over the man, blood flowing from his throat as he tried to gasp in air. I didn’t even recognize my clawed hand that was buried deep into his flesh. I removed it without any effort watching his bleed out, staring up at the ceiling utterly confused over what just happened.  

“Not... very fair....” He coughed then fell still.  

Dark blood dripped from my claws as I let my arm return to a human shape. Lock looked just as shocked as the creature on the other side of the room. I had just killed someone for such a minor thing. And yet I didn’t feel guilty over it. I didn’t feel much of anything at that moment.  

What snapped me out of it was the other creature crossing the room in a flash to scoop up Lock. He held him hostage with a powerful set of arms.  

“Move and I rip his head off!” He shouted words shaking.  

I didn’t doubt that. I just needed to reach them before it happened. He saw my foot move and my body was hit by an invisible force that knocked the wind from my lungs. The room turned pitch black. I wasn’t in the basement with the rest of them. What did he just do?  

A rasping noise came from behind. Turning I thought I was ready for any horror that may be ready to rip my body apart. Instead, I saw my old partner, body bloody and gasping for air. She was missing her arm, and her leg was twisted in such a way she shouldn’t have been able to stand.  

Black bile came to my throat. Unable to stop myself I doubled over hacking out a thick liquid that refused to stop. A rumbling came shaking my skull so hard I thought my brain would start leaking from my ears. It wasn’t just her that appeared. Hands came reaching out from the darkness. The people I loved and died came back silently cursing the fact I was still here, and they weren’t. 

Not just faces I knew but the ones I thought I had buried. All the people I failed to save as a Contract Worker and the ones I had been forced to kill. Some had been monsters but at this point was I really that different?   

In the middle of the twisting bodies was a person with dark hair. Someone I had long since forgotten and yet was trying the hardest to reach me. I couldn’t see their face. Who were they? And why would I be happy if they were the ones who were able to take my life?  

The scene exploded as I was violently brought back to the damp basement. Collapsing to the ground I still spat out bile unable to get my strength back. The hands still rose from the ground gripping my wrists trying to bring me down with them. Their touch burned away flesh that slowly healed back.   

Glancing up I saw the creature on the ground, half of his head missing and Lock pressed against the wall almost frightened over the dead body in front of him. The man who sat at the fold-out table stood, an unreadable expression on his face. A card between two fingers glowed with magic showing what weapon he used to kill the creature.  

“Weren’t you working with him?” I asked after I finally stopped throwing up.  

“I work for myself. They didn’t know that.” He replied in a cold voice then sat back down.  

The only emotion he showed was disappointment he used a card so now he couldn't keep his game going.  

“He hit you with a spell that causes a person's guilt to slowly kill them. Unless you get it removed, you’ll be haunted and taken apart piece by piece within a day. Puking up black stuff like that isn’t a side effect though. You should get that looked at.” He commented.  

“I’ll get right on that.” I muttered still unable to stand. “Lock, are you alright? Did he use the spell on you too?”   

Lock nodded shaken but otherwise fine.  

“He did, but it looks like the spell didn’t do anything to him.” The man explained.  

Lock was either too powerful or he didn’t feel enough guilt for it to drag him down.  Voices from deceased loved ones rang in my ears. I shook my head trying to get rid of them. He was right, if this kept up it would kill me.  

“Lock can you create a door? We need to leave.” I said slowly getting back up.  

The man turned in his chair, a steel-cold look in his eyes. The deck of cards on the table sat as a silent threat. Normally I would be able to handle him, but I could barely stay on my feet.  

“He can leave but you need to stay for a few more minutes.”  

Those words weren’t a request. As worried as I should be over what he wanted me for, I couldn't shake the feeling we met before. His jacket was a long trench coat infused with some sort of power. I could see more magic items tucked away to be used as weapons. He was decked out. Was he a Hunter? No, he wouldn’t let Lock leave or work with creatures in the first place. He wasn’t a Contract Worker or an Agent either.  

Lock was having issues getting the silver chain off his wrist. The man walked over to remove it and placed it into his pocket. I expected to be left behind, instead Lock took my arm as if we were close friends.  

“If I stay and help, will I get a reward?” He asked in a tone that made me frown.  

I don’t think the odd attraction was because he actually liked me. If anyone else weaker than him was the person to remove his sin, he would act the same way around them. I was just the unlucky one to do so.  

We got a few judgmental glances, but the man mostly ignored us.   

My head was swimming from not only the voices that still came through because of the spell but mostly from trying to remember who this guy was.   

“Don’t worry, that nasty chain is off. I’ll protect you if he tries to sell you off.” Lock said proudly.  

“He didn’t kill off the other creature to take all the profits for himself.” I explained. “I don’t think he’s looking for a fight either.”  

Lock looked confused trying to put it all together.  

“Richmond is correct. Even in his weakened state, he would be able to do a great deal of damage if I wanted to restrain him. My body is my source of income. I’m not interested in spending money for repairs.”  

At least that was a good sign. I still didn’t know why he wanted me to stay. The answer came before I could ask that question.  

The room around us exploded into action. The entire building above us had been ripped away. The man used the fold-out table to shield himself as I used my body to protect Lock. Annoyance came when I realized he was perfectly fine taking care of himself, but he wanted to be treated like a damsel. This guy needed therapy once we got out of here.  

With some effort, we got out of the pit that held the basement to face what new horrors waited outside. The sun had almost set. Countless glowing eyes shone through the trees around us. The small house had been built along a forest trail and had long since been abandoned. If we died here no one would hear.  

A stench of death came through the air coming off the creatures rustling around waiting for an order.  

The person in the middle of them was small wearing stitched together layers of cloth. Long hair with beads and bones tied into it was pulled back out of their face. They looked like a child, but I knew they were older than all of us put together.  

It took a second to figure out what type of creature they could be. Necromancers were rare. People who performed spells to raise the dead weren’t considered a true Necromancer.  Only the creatures made directly by the first Knight of the Silver King could hold that title. Due to certain cultural rules, supernatural creatures didn’t often use spells to move the dead or at least not at this scale. Either this creature was insanely powerful child of a god-like being or didn’t care about the rules that bound supernatural society.   

My eyesight was blurry. I couldn’t properly see how much magic they held or how much of a threat they may be.   

“Nice of you to stick around for me! Your body will be a perfect one to add to my collection!” The small creature spoke and raised a hand silently ordering the undead minions to attack.  

I’ve faced death so many times over. I should be used to dealing with the dead but my body tensed. If I didn’t need to protect Lock I might not have been able to make myself move.  

The creatures were abominations made from mismatched corpses. It reminded me of the same kind of spell the man that summoned Lock used. Unlike the bodies he created these were filled with rotting organs being slowly drained of every ounce of magic.   

Lock froze seeing the beast coming our way. It was a long serpent-type thing with human arms stitched along to side to use as legs. He wasn't afraid of these undead monsters. No, he was forced to relive how he was brought into this world and what his body was made up of.   

He was infected by sin before, so he couldn’t show his true feelings. The fact that the man who summoned him killed two people, one being a child paralyzed him with regret.   

The man who had been with us was also being attacked. A ten-foot undead werewolf creature fell on him. It slammed its fists down missing the man by an inch each time. He was barely staying alive so I couldn't expect him to help.  

The long monster raced towards us; the jaws open ready to come down on flesh. I pulled Lock out of the way as the monster snapped those deadly teeth shut in the air. It turned ready to try again when I placed a hand on its head. I just needed to find the spell keep it together and cut it.   

The backlash was intense. At least I lived through it. Pain crippled my arm as I needed to take a second to recover from breaking the spell. The beast fell apart causing the small leader to stomp their foot in rage.   

The other man acted too slow. He was grabbed with a large, clawed hand and slammed to the ground hard enough to knock him out. Not dead yet but we didn’t have a lot of time.   

My body doubled over as I suddenly needed to puke again. A foul stream of the black liquid refused to stop for a few seconds. Every muscle shook as I forced my head up and an arm weakly raised trying to be ready to take down the next monster.   

This wasn’t good. Phantom hands rose from the ground gripping my ankles wanting to drag me down. I needed to deal with that spell first. It was settled deep into my chest. Mentally reaching inside and prying it away hurt more than any physical pain. I was scared of dying and yet I was more scared of removing this dark spell. Deep down I thought all the pain and torment was worth it if I could hear those voices again. If I removed them, would I never hear my older partner speak my name? Or my mother? Or Ito? Was death an equal trade?  

With one last push, I ripped the dark magic out regretfully watching it disappear. I had other voices I wanted to hear again. I bet August would give me an earful if he knew how close I came to giving up again.  

The small creature reached out, magic crawling through the ground looking for a new target. Instead of us, it dipped down to take hold of the two fresh bodies we left in the open basement.  

The fresher the better. I didn’t want to think of how awful it would be trying to face a new abomination made from those two. I had a hard enough time dealing with one of them when they were alive.  

Lock realized what was happening and an enraged expression came over him.  

“Those aren’t yours!” He shouted toward the smaller creature.  

Supernatural culture can be complicated. Instead of money, they based their currency on a favored system. It has flaws due to others not seeing eye to eye on what certain tasks are worth. Something most agreed on is if you killed it, you had the right to do whatever to the body. If you didn’t kill something, then the body was only fair game if a supernatural creature needed to use it to survive.  The reason why Necromancy wasn’t more widely used was because they would need to get permission from the creature’s families to use the body in their spell work. Raising an army of dead creatures you didn’t kill to add to your strength was greatly looked down on. Oddly enough grave robbing within supernatural communities tends to only be committed by human Hunters.  

Lock was greatly offended on those creatures' behalf their bodies were going to be used for something they didn’t consent to or something the Necromancer didn’t earn. It wasn’t as if he cared about them. He was glad they were dead. But something this ghoulish happening in front of him was bound to get a reaction.  

“They’re dead! They don’t care!” The creature shot back sounding childish.  

“It’s the principle! If you’re going to kill us, do it with your own hands and not with stolen flesh!” Lock shot back in a huff.  

“No one gives a shit how I kill you!”   

The man who worked the kidnapped us this as a chance to slowly start moving from the spot he was slammed into the ground. If he could avoid the Necromancer's attention, then he could use some sort of hidden weapon. Or he would just leave, and I didn’t blame him.  

“This is why no one likes your kind! Such foul, disgusting things! You’re lower than humans! The dirt on my shoes has more value than you! I would kill you myself but you’re not worth my magic!”  

Lock was going off. I was too exhausted to stop him. All at once the creatures shot out to attack. I lashed out destroying two by cutting the spell work. The other man needed to use his entire deck of cards to rip apart the beast that came for him. He didn’t appear stressed. I wish I had his calm nature.  

The Necromancer took what Lock said very personally. They disappeared only to appear in the air in above him. A small foot came down with a great deal of power pinning Lock to the ground. Dust kicked up around them as the smaller creature pressed down harder trying to rub Lock’s golden hair onto the dirt.  

“Who’s lesser than who now?!” The creature shouted, face twisted in rage.  

Their leg came down once again harder this time. After contact Lock made a sound that caused everyone to freeze. The rage was replaced by shock. Carefully they raised a foot to see Lock’s expression. Instead of pain, his face had turned a bright flustered red.  

Within a second the Necromancer backed up to the trees in horror.  

“Nopenopenope. You made it weird. I’m leaving.”  

I should have felt better we avoided death. I just felt dirty from what I just saw.  

The undead creatures followed their leader. The ones we took down didn’t move and I wondered who would need to clean this all up.  

“I’m keeping these.” The man said pointing to the half-rotten body that had tried to kill him moments earlier.  

“Whatever!”   

With one final shout, the threat and the undead were gone. Lock got up on his own brushing himself off. We all refused to talk about what happened. Instead, the man got to work drawing magic circles to transport the bodies away.   

When he was finished, he walked over to us his hand out expecting something.  

“Do you have a spare key out of here? I used all my magic items, and I don’t want to walk.” He asked.  

I dug around in my pocket to bring out a backup office key. He didn’t take it. He just looked disappointed in me for some reason.  

“I was helping the people who were going to sell you off and yet do me a favor just like that? I told you before your forgiving nature will get you killed. I bet a person could slaughter a child in front of you but if they say they’re sorry you’ll forgive them the next day.”  

I let him vent in an oddly calm voice. At the last part, my head slowly turned towards Lock who also slowly started to turn his head away unable to meet my gaze. I didn’t this think guy needed to know how right he was. After looking back at him it finally clicked on where we met.  

“Darius! That’s your working name! It was bothering me this entire time!” I said ignoring his other statement.  

“He’s an old friend of yours?” Lock asked.  

I shook my head.  

“We worked together around three years ago. Some mimics and copycats were being sold. We were able to take down the operation, but two of the culprits got away kidnapping one of the mimics. We found the warehouse where they fled too but we never found them. Just some signs of some sort of ritual.” I explained giving a reason why I still knew his name after working together only once.  

“I bet you still blame yourself for that.” Darius said almost as an insult.  

“Of course I do...” I muttered.  

Back then my control over magic wasn’t that strong. If I had the strength I do now, then we could have saved that last person. It felt like I was never as strong as I needed to be.   

“So, you’re a Contract Worker? A bit strange you would stage a kidnapping without Richmond being in on it.” Lock pointed out.  

“I’m Trashman. I take the scraps and jobs no one wants.” He explained sounding oddly cold.   

“But you’re strong enough-” Lock started only to be interrupted.  

“I have Dragon in my blood.”  

That explained why he was doing all of this. The Corporation wouldn’t trust him to be a Contract Worker even though dragons were starting to be treated better as of late. He had too much of a monster inside his blood to live a normal human life, but not the right type to work with supernatural creatures.  

I’ve heard of the Trashman nickname. They were people who couldn’t become Contract Workers or Agents but still wanted to make money. If a Contract Worker accepts a job they couldn't do for whatever reason they can pass it on to another person. If the job gets done The Corporation doesn’t care who does it. But the person who accepted the job is the one who gets paid for it. It’s up to them to pass the payment along. Personally, I’ve never seen it, but I bet there are people out there who accept jobs, find others to do them, and keep a hefty cut for themselves. When we worked together, I assumed Darius was a Contract Worker like myself.  

Lock crossed his arms looking disgusted again. He didn’t have a high opinion of dragons, and I sighed already tired from what he might say next.  

“No wonder why you’re scavenging. You’re almost as bad as the Necromancer.” He scoffed.  

“He’s just trying to rile you up to get a reaction.” I sighed again.  

Lock’s face turned red as he sputtered out half-formed words.  

“I don’t do that kind of shit for free.”  

Lock froze up again, the gears slowly turning in his head, but he didn’t want to make it obvious. He coughed and turned his attention in my direction.  

“I stayed and helped. I should get a reward you know.” He reminded.  

Darius wanted to leave. He held his hand out for the key to get out of here. I held it up my hand but didn’t hand it over. I nodded at Lock knowing that would be enough for Darius to get the hint.  If looks could kill I would be dead within a second.  

For the next few minutes, I needed to witness Darius playing along with Lock. There was a lot of him insulting his dragon bloodline and then getting his wrists bound again with the silver chain. They kept their clothes on the entire time, but it felt like a private moment no one should be watching. I would have rather died than do this. I don’t know how Darius kept a straight face.  

After they were finished, I handed over the key feeling a bit guilty. He should have been paid more for all that.  

“Sorry...” I told him.  

He took the key mostly unfazed.  

“It’s not the worst thing I’ve done. Not all of us can be born with Hunter blood.”  

If I didn’t know better, I would think he was teasing me. Darius didn’t seem like the type though.  

I should have let him leave before he got dragged into some other horror. After he drew a door, I stopped him by placing a hand on his shoulder.  

“Thanks for helping out today.” I told him.  

“I would have sold you if you didn’t get free.” He admitted without a hint of shame.  

I didn’t mind. I just placed another hand on his shoulder so we could be eye to eye. I wanted him to know my next words were serious.  

“I’m glad you are who you turned out to be.”  

I mentally screamed at myself trying to keep my expression neutral.  I didn’t want him to hate himself because of how he was born. But I didn’t think hearing some awkward statement from a stranger would do much for him after I said it.  

“Ok... Thanks.” He slowly nodded.  

I wish I died that day for a few reasons. I let him go but he stopped in front of the doorway.  

“What happened to you?” He asked.  

We last worked together before I retired for that short while. I had looked much better in those days. 

“My partner died. You met her, right?” I started to explain.  

He shook his head with his mask slipping a bit. He sounded far more human than before.  

“Three years ago, I could tell you had some trauma. It was under the surface, and you were dealing with it. In this kind of life, we're all like that. Now, it’s like all of that is on display. And it’s more than that. The person I met three years ago could have handled her death and this job. Seriously, what is wrong with you?”  

I wasn’t sure what he was talking about. I had been having issues for well, a long while. But it didn’t feel as if it was more than normal.  

“I just have had a lot going on.” I suggested.  

He narrowed his eyes as if I was lying. Deciding it wasn’t his place he shrugged and turned away.  

“Look into it before you kill yourself.” 

I waved him off glad that Darius prolonged the fact I still needed to deal with Lock. 

He behaved on the way back which was nice. His Handler was someone I had never met before. She was convinced that she would be fired for losing him for a few hours. We all promised never to let anyone know about what happened. 

Then I took the long walk home ready for a very long nap after that day. When I reached my apartment door I stopped. Something felt off. Instead of going inside I turned around ready to leave. My neighbor heard my footsteps and opened their door. They confirmed something I already knew. Someone had been inside my place tossing things around. I thanked them for the information and promised I would call the police. 

The next trip was to a Corporation office to tell them about the break in. I couldn’t take any chances. They were going to send a different Contract Worker over, maybe an Agent to do a sweep. While I was there, I picked up new IDs. I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve needed to change my name. It might take me a few days to remember the new one, but I would still go by Richmond around people I already knew. 

I was also given some spare clothing. After that was done, I found a cheap hotel for settle in for the night. It was a shame I would need to move. I considered warning August and other people on my contact list. If anyone was after me would they really go after my friends? I sent him a text with a bit of a heads up in the situation. He thanked me and promised he would be extra alert and invited me over for dinner. I refused just in case I did have a target on my back. The best thing right now was to lay low for a while no matter how much I wanted to see the people I cared about.
