Two years ago when I was 26, me and my friends loved to go just outside our town and explore seemingly abandoned places. Sometimes we'd go on road trips and find cities that were ripe for that kind of stuff.


Now of course whenever I went anywhere I was never alone and I never brought anything sketchy on me in case I had to talk with police. We never tried to hide when a car came up and even though we had some close calls we clearly meant no harm and were let go on the few occasions it did happen.


Overall I'd say we had been doing urbex for around three years. It's honestly one the things I would have normally looked forward to the most. But now, I can't even think about it without one particular incident coming up. One of my friends who had been with us all those years had passed away unexpectedly and even now I was never sure how it happened.


The people I thought I knew so well going through all these adventures grew cold with me over time almost as if they partially blamed me for it. This happened just a month before I turned 26 and just like that I spent my birthday alone.


Even though I was still trying to recover from the loss of not just him but everyone else who turned their backs on me, I decided to keep doing urbex but this time on my lonesome. I think deep down trying to redefine it without them was my way of coping but I had no idea just what would come from that that would lead to me experiencing something so horrid.


I don't remember exactly when this was, I believe it was sometime in November before Thanksgiving as just after Halloween I was hiking out into the local forest off the established trails to see if I could find anything interesting. The town I lived in was hilly and nestled deep enough in the wilderness that you couldn't see street lights once you walked some feet away from the center.


It held a lot history and secrets with it and that alone was a massive reason why it was a great place to search for weird spots. I had already seen people in the thick of the night doing weird stuff when I was younger and sometimes when I'd see them wander it would scare me enough to block my window entirely.


Even though I never saw anything remotely disturbing in all my time there I still got the shudders from time to time until that very night. When I first set out it was still the afternoon and it was quite sunny for the time being. Though in the beginning of the month I was going off the forest trails specifically to find places, on this day I was mostly just trying to chill out and do some basic hiking.


I kept to the trails though I managed to walk much farther than I normally would and in a few hours the sun was already about to set. Normally I'd scuffle back to the town before it got that dark but I was still bearing with heavy emotions and sure enough I found myself walking off the trail somewhere deep within.


By the time I realized just how far I was I could barely discern the difference among all the trees around me which loomed high enough to form a partial canopy against the sky. I pulled my phone out to look at GPS but I had really bad signal out at the time. Just when it didn't seem bad enough I witnessed some storm clouds peek by and in just a few minutes I was pelted with rain.


I could feel my calm demeanor turn bitter and agitated as the night rolled in and I was stranded entirely. In a way I just wanted to fall asleep right there. I wanted to be taken away by the elements and never have to deal with the emptiness inside of me again. One part of me still remained frightened that if I didn't act immediately I would die out in the forest so even though I stopped for a minute I attempted to gain back direction in anyway possible.


I tried to remember which way the sun was facing and where it set. I thought if I could figure out which direction was west I could turn eastward and move back toward the town. Unfortunately, due to not really paying attention to begin with and the night having fully descended it was impossible.



Even worse, the air sapped against my skin and was quite cold and the rain only made the sensations even worse. My hands started to numb and I was ill equipped to deal with such weather. I had only intended to be out during the day and go back home. But at that point home was completely gone in every sense of the word.


No one was there to help me, the cold was invading my body and numbing my mind as I sloggishly tried to move through the thicket and find something to protect me. I started to cry, scream, and yell continuously only to hear nothing but the pelting of the rain. It was an absolute nightmare and I struggled for what seemed like over an hour just trying to escape the clutches of the woods.


Though I thought it was a miracle at the time, I unfortunately noticed a silhouette among the trees walking along a hill. I had finally found someone to help me. I called and yelled out to them for assistance but once I did they seemed to turn and look in my direction before quickly running off out of view. It was too dark to make out any features beside the shape of the body which was tall and skinny.


Like an idiot I pursued the figure marching up the hill to follow them and believe me when I say it took just about all my strength to climb up there with my numb hands, stiff legs, and weakened mind. Once I got up there I felt an immense unease upon seeing a massive Victorian style home standing just below me.


It was unlike anything I had seen in my entire life spent with urbex and though it was quite beautiful and ornate, with various lights affixed along its sprawling porch in the front, it felt far too out of place. The figure had vanished and I didn't see anyone walking near or around the place and yet it seemed to have electricity.


There were no cars parked but there was a pathway leading up to yard that seemed to stretch back out once I began walking up to it after carefully sliding down without hurting myself. There was no fence but there was a gate further out along the pathway and once I was directly standing in front of the house I could hear the roar of a generator somewhere just out of sight.


I was completely in shock at what I was seeing and conflicted on entering as in some respects it didn't appear abandoned at all yet it also looked like no one was there at the same time. I figured if anyone was there or about to be there I could explain what happened and they'd helped me find my way back home. Never in my life had I visited such a property and especially not alone and in such horrible conditions.


I was hanging on by a thread and so I felt I had no choice but to walk up to the door. Even though it did seem to be inhabitated there was still a musty smell of decay as I walked onto the porch as the old warped wood creaked. I knocked on the door and called out. No response. I did so again after several minutes. Nothing.


Then I decided to try for the door but it was locked. I felt my blood curdle when I heard a woman laughing on the other side. It didn't feel like it was directed at me rather more like to someone else who was inside with them. Even still the laughter erupted over and over and I couldn't help but feel myself shudder away instinctively.


I noticed there was a second porch just above the one I was on that also had a door. I attempted to climb up against the pressure of the rain still reeling from the shock of the abrupt laughter. I managed to get myself up there and tried for the door which swung open without much effort.


In contrast to the rough yet ornate exterior of the building, the interior was in excellent shape warm from the fireplace situated right across from a lavish bed. I quickly sat myself in front the fireplace and absorbed the heat while attempting to at least partially dry my clothing. I felt a sweet relief at least for a few minutes.


The same laughter from before reverberated under me though it sounded much like a different person. I could feel the vibrations of people moving around just outside the room which forced me to stand up. I grew tense in an instant gently moving toward the door and pressing an ear up to it. The ticking of a clock filled the space behind along with feet quickly making way past the door.


Voices rang out but they were too muffled and frantic to make out. For awhile I was petrified to even open the door a bit and peek. I mustered enough nerve to finally make the move but as soon as I did a piercing cry rang out just below the stair well. Then a violent dragging sound rippled across the wooden floors as the screaming continued.


I had to clutch at my chest just to calm myself as I peered down. The voice had been silenced and yet no one was downstairs. The space was only filled with the ticking of the clock. I could not believe the rapid change and shift that had occurred so suddenly. It was as if my mind was trying to play tricks with me.


I finally stepped out fully and descended down the stairwell overlooking a grand foyer. I could see the front doors, the hardwood floor, decadent chandelier, and vast assortment of paintings. I thought then I had stumbled into some restored rich family's mansion only to remind myself that this house was seemingly out in the thick of nature with no close proximity to the town.


Nothing was making sense and yet I couldn't stomach just what was happening with the lack of any people but seeming auditory presence of them. I could feel my mind rock back and forth as I carefully walked about the space and searched through the other rooms on the second floor. They were quite nice from the bathrooms and bedrooms all topped with a distinct office space.


Practically every space seemed lived in and yet I still couldn't find any people. I was constantly on edge as I explored knowing anyone could be around the corner. The office especially creeped me out with the large bear rug just before the desk, books and documents strewn about everywhere.


On the desk a taxidermied raven stared at me with malice as I searched through everything. An old brown stain lie just next to a dossier reeking of a foul odor as I attempted to comb through the files all of which had weird documentations on random locations throughout the world.


I couldn't make sense of it as all the documents just detailed the location in question or were damaged beyond repair. Then a dreadful presence appeared behind me. I couldn't see them but I could feel them standing there. I stood paralyzed for what seemed like forever before it got even worse.


A cold hand grasped my shoulder accompanied by the voice of my dead friend. I turned to face him only to jump back into the desk and shriek. That's when his low-pitched laugh invaded my ears as I was forced to get a good look at him. He was wearing a partially tattered suit, his eyes full, skin pale, and a fresh crimson was strewn across his face.


He didn't appear decayed at all yet he didn't remotely appear normal either. I would have sworn it was a different person entirely if I didn't hear the voice first. He walked steadily over to where I landed as I attempted to get away from him.


He giggled then began talking once more.


"Hello there Simon. It's been awhile bud. How are you doing?"


I continued to stare and shutter as he looked over me, his teeth yellowed and stained with some sort of black substance. He continued.


"I'm sorry to say this but I can't have you be here. The misses wouldn't like it. Not one bit."


"I. I will leave okay?"


"I won't have it. Not in the house and not in the streets. That is unless you want your birthday present."


The more he spoke the more twisted his expression became like a wolf staring down at a wounded lamb. Nothing he said made any sense and I felt he was poised to strike at any time yet he was so casual as he spoke. I gave him reply.


"What? I thought you died! What do you mean? What birthday present? What happened to you!"


"It's a surprise of course. You'll have to follow me to the basement if you want to see it. We're playing some games down there. Come on you'll love it. I don't know if you've seen but I've been so busy lately. But hey life isn't all about work! Let's celebrate!"


He pulled out a dagger from underneath his suit jacket and held it over me. In a soft voice he began muttering the happy birthday song to me. I could feel my entire body shake, my legs twitching as he followed me around the room muttering. I took the first opening I could get.


I ran out of the room and soon after felt his feet facing behind me. In a surge of terror I raced for the front door but it was barred from the outside and I had no time to unlock it as he chased me around with the knife laughing like an esctatic boy. Then I heard a commotion come up from below as a couple of others stormed through a door.


For a moment glancing at them I could tell they were my other friends. The same ones who never told me what happened. I could feel my sense of reality warp and shift as I ran in panic still being chased.


I clamored back to the bedroom I came in through and lept off the balcony injuring my ankles. I screamed out as the rain pelted me again and in a flash the three were on my tail shouting and screaming at me in a frenzy. Then I hurried my way to the pathway toward the gate suffering through the pain of the injured ankles.


Worse still the gate was quite tall with spiked tops but that did not deter me. I climbed it and threw myself over on the other side slicing into my chest. I continued down the path and into the darkness not stopping for a single moment as the voices continued to ring out in the distance. I just kept running for what seemed like forever until I could no longer hear them and I ducked behind a tree shivering from the cold and fresh fear.


I still hadn't eaten or drank anything in hours since that afternoon and so I found myself hiding out in the night clinging to life dearly even as I felt my ankles ache and my chest bleed. I shivered and shook for hours more until I passed out entirely. I woke up to find the bright sun shining down on me, my entire body in extreme pain.


I was still near the road and despite how dazed and deprived I was I kept going further and further out until the path came to a halt with large rocks blocking what seemed to be a separate gate. I walked around it and within another hour I finally saw the town again. I felt my body collapse again as soon as I got into a store and explained what had happened to the owner who quickly gave me food and supplies after seeing how horrid my condition was.


He called emergency services and I was taken care of at the local hospital where after a week or so I had fully recovered from the injuries. Even now after all of that I am terrified. I ended up moving across the country  to get away from not just that but from my whole past with the people I called my friends.


I'm in a much bigger city with no forests to speak of and that alone has helped me calm down after permanently having large masses of trees trigger my memories back to that. I've been getting odd phone calls and voice messages from numbers I don't recognize but that honestly might just be a coincidence and this post is just me trying to get this off my shoulders.


Honestly sometimes I am not sure if what I saw was real but that is more than likely just my mind trying to protect me so I can move on. I never want to go out on my own out in the wilderness again. Sometimes I can barely leave my house as this has had me develop a sense of agoraphobia since then.


I'm working through it the best I can and though thinking about it makes my skin crawl, I hope that people are at least more aware of the dangers of going out like this entail. It's also incredibly difficult for me to trust people anymore after this and I hope I recover from that too but that seems years in the making. I feel like the adventurer in me died that night.


If there's any message to this I could impart to you it's to be very careful in this world. you never truly know what's going on and sometimes the people you love and think you know are something else entirely.
