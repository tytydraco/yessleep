"So this is it then? This is what happens at the end of the universe?" 

Mark was confused, I could see it. In my glassbox sitting at the edge of reality and time. Earth was long gone, eaten whole by the S'zangor, the Unbound, the Overmind which consumes all. But even they were dead now.

The only thing left was me, my box, a computer and Mark , the last human left alive standing in front of a normal polished wooden door.

"What were you expecting? Fireworks blasting the universe to shreds, a congratulations from God? No. It's just me and that door."

"What's on the other side?" He asked me.

"No idea, I just sit here and watch the door."

There were only about 5 stars left in the universe now, and one of them flickered out as Mark stood there looking bewildered.

I clicked out of the Wikipedia page I was reading on my computer and leaned back in my chair.

"The place we're standing in has been around for, well, ever. Because it exists at the place where time has no meaning, I am at all times at the same time." I told him

"What? The fuck is that supposed to mean?" He asked.

"It means you have a long time to decide whether you want to go through that door or watch memes on my computer for the rest of eternity"

"Your computer has internet access?"

"Yup, you can access the internet of any time period with this bad boy. Only thing that kept me sane for all eternity. You remember that whole thing with the Cicada, yeah that was me. Oh fun times."

"That means we can warn Earth about the weird alien things that are going to eat it." He tried to push past me to do just that.

"Doesn't work that way I'm afraid. Can't interfere with the timeline in any major way." 

I saw the disappointment in his eyes and offered him a lollipop. He tossed it out of the window as another star disappeared.

"So door or no door? I mean I know you have eternity to decide but try moving a little quicker" I told him

He looked through the peephole of the door and stumbled back.

"Holy shit it's bright in there." He said rubbing his eyes.

His spaceship just outside was sucked inside an anti reality sinkhole.

"Yeah magical super doors that hold secrets of the universe do tend to be bright" I pulled out the 22nd May 1982 edition of the Times of India and started reading.

He turned the doorknob and the door swung open revealing the brightest light in creation.

"Is.... God in there?" He asked

"God? Oh he died a few millenia before humans invented the wheel"

"God is dead?" 

"Fortunately. Dude was a chatterbox. Seventh day of rest wasn't a good day for my ears"

"How old are you?" He asked me

"I've been here as long as the door has." I answered

"And how long has the door been here?"

Another star went out with a bang, creating the last supernova which was instantly snuffed out.

"The door's been here as long as I've been here" I said with a chuckle

"Can you stop talking in riddles?" He pulled up a chair to sit down with his head in his hands as another star fell out of existence.

"Talking in riddles is part of the job description. I haven't spoken to a real sentient being in a few billion years I'm allowed to be snarky." I replied 

"So what's your move? Gonna sit here forever or are you going through the door."

"Have you been through the door?" He asked me

"Nope. Nothing ever has. It's been sitting here waiting for you for all time and untime." 

"So this door was built just for me?" 

"It was built for the last human left alive."

"What will happen to me if I go through?"

"You won't be here anymore. You'll be somewhere else."

"Where? There's stuff other than the universe we're living in?" 

"I mean probably. Not in this entire dimension of existence atleast. Maybe this will wake you up from a dream or release you from the simulation. I don't know either."

"I think I'll go through" The last human alive told me

"Good choice. Safe travels friend."

He walked towards the door.

"One last question, what's your name?"

"It's Jim. Jim followed by syllables that humans aren't able to comprehend and half letters."

"Cool. Thanks Jim."

He went through the door. The last star died in the silence.

I closed the door, locked it from the inside. And walked back to my desk. Finished writing this post and sent it back to 2024. I switched off my lamp, turned off my computer, and the Universe went away forever.
