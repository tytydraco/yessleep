It’s pretty common for children to have imaginary friends, so my parents never thought much of it when I started seeing mine at the age of three. I don’t remember the first moment I saw him, but I have vague recollections. I remember falling down, and Samuel helping me up. He appeared to be a kid my age, and I didn’t think twice about it. I had a friend to play with, and that’s all that mattered.

When I was around 8 years old, my parents began to be concerned that I was still seeing Samuel. At the time, I didn’t understand why they had become more worried, considering that they had no problem believing me before. I didn’t realize that imaginary friends were supposed to be just that- imaginary. It was at this point Samuel told me to pretend he didn’t exist around other people.

Making friends wasn’t easy for me, but I didn’t really need to. Samuel was always there for me, so I didn’t see a reason to try to make more friends. Plus, it didn't feel fair to him since they couldn’t see him. We agreed it was better that people didn’t know about him anyways.

Samuel proved to be really helpful to me. Since other people couldn’t see him, he was able to look at other kids' papers and tell me their answers, or even knock balls or other things out of their hands to help me win in P.E. class. It was like having a superpower.

One day, a kid tried to bully me. I can’t remember what for, but it was something trivial. Samuel told me to punch him, but I wouldn’t do it. The kid cornered me, and I covered up to protect myself. After a moment, I looked up and noticed that he was bent over, holding his gut. Samuel had punched him.

I reached out to help him up, and Samuel kicked him in the face, sending him to the ground unconscious. A lot of other kids were watching, but none of them dared to tell on me. They must have thought I actually had powers or something, because everyone, including the bully, made up some bogus story about him tripping and falling.

Everyone was terrified of me.

Samuel told me this was good, and that everyone should be scared of us. Now we had the power to tell anybody what to do. Something about it felt wrong, but he had never led me astray, so I listened to him. People who wronged me or I didn’t like would have bad things happen to them. Nothing major, but they’d end up with some bumps and bruises.

As I got older, Samuel began to go places on his own. He wouldn’t be gone for long, maybe a few days at the most, and he never told me what he was doing. However, because of this, I had started to actually attempt to make friends and be social. Samuel didn’t like it too much, but he allowed it, as long as I knew that they were “not my best friend”.

Eventually, in High School, I had actually secured a date with a girl. 

I’ll call her Emily.

Emily was super cute. Blonde, blue eyes, pretty stereotypically attractive. The fact she was entertaining me at all was amazing to me, and she was a really sweet girl. So I really wanted this to work. 

We had agreed to meet at the theater to watch some horror movie. As I got dressed, Samuel came back from one of his “trips”.

“What are you dressing up for?” he asked inquisitively.

“I have a date,” I responded, adjusting my hair trying to make it look perfect.

“A date… why are you going on dates? Trying to get some action I see…” he said, a grin on his face that filled me with disgust. Something about his expression, and his eyes, genuinely scared me.

“Nah man… I actually… like this girl.”

His face shifted into annoyance.

“Look, I get I’ve been having to go on “business trips” more often than usual, but that doesn’t mean you need a girlfriend. She’s just gonna get in the way.”

I tried to ignore him as I got ready. I should’ve known he would be upset.

“You gonna try to ignore me? I’m not imaginary, you know.”

“I’ll see you when I get back Samuel…” I said dismissively as I left to go pick her up.

The date went great, and we decided to get ice cream after the movie. However, while in the middle of conversation, I noticed someone standing in the window outside of the ice cream shop.

It was Samuel.

He stood there, arms crossed. He looked pissed. Then, he lowered his arms, and proceeded to walk towards the door. 

Luckily, he seemed to still be bound by walls and other physical things.

I grabbed Emily by the hand, and pulled her towards the other exit, telling her there's no time to explain but we have to go. She must've thought it was just some game as she giggled and played along.

 I drove her back to her house, and we even kissed before she went inside. Overall, this was a great night and I couldn’t be happier about it. 

However, when I got home, Samuel was waiting for me.

“You have to get rid of her.”

“Get- rid of her? Samuel what are you-”

“I don’t like her. She’s not good for you. Break up with her, or I will.”

I looked at Samuel, and saw the anger on his face. The grimace it was contorted into gave me chills. That evil look in his eyes made me want to cower. But I tried to stand my ground.

“Look man… if you are gonna be like this…”

“What? Are you gonna choose a girl like her over me? Your oldest friend?”

I sighed.

“Samuel… I appreciate you man but… you have to let me make friends… and live… I can’t just have an imaginary friend forever… I'm almost 18…”

If I thought he was angry before, I was in for a rude awakening. His face contorted into something filled with pure hate, and he gritted his teeth. I swear his eyes almost looked black…

“Fine.”

I was caught off guard by that answer, and before I could respond he kicked my door off of its hinges, and stormed out.

While the whole situation was frightening, I was most worried about how I was gonna explain the door to my parents. That was, until the next day. Emily didn’t make it to school that morning.

Her body was found a week later. No fingerprints, no leads.

I never saw Samuel again.

That was almost ten years ago now. I went through a period of reclusion, but eventually was able to move on. I even met another girl, got married. Had a kid.

After I tucked in my three-year old daughter last night, I went to turn off the light.

“Daddy?” she said, right before I could hit the switch. 

I turned back to look at her.

“Yes?”

“Samuel says he missed you.”
