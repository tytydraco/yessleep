As far back as I can remember it had always been my mum and me. My old man was out of the picture and, whenever pressed, Mum would give me some dismissive comment that we were better off without him. As a child I had been curious about him; all my friends had dads, so I felt a bit weird being the odd one out. Eventually, I got to an age where it didn’t seem as big of a deal and as Mum never mentioned him I kind of just forgot about him. Since then I moved out, got a job, found a wife and have become a father myself but I still took every Sunday evening to visit mum for dinner.


Mum’s house was always so bright and vibrant, much like the woman herself.
Absolute life and soul of the party was the old girl and seldom was there a dull moment. Over the past year or so though I’d notice little things on my weekly visits.
Tiny stuff, like where the house was always immaculate, now I noticed dirty plates on the side, or where it had once been so bright, now she kept the curtains drawn. Her demeanour began to change as the year drew on as well, her fuse grew shorter and her sense of humour seemed to lessen by the week.


Around the time I began noticing these little changes was about the same time my mum started seeing a new fella, Frank.
Mum had mentioned him in passing a few times over the years so I knew they went back a fair way but I didn’t realise they were close until, one Sunday, I show up for dinner to be greeted by the man.


From the first time I laid eyes on Frank he made me uneasy. He looked normal enough, almost familiar in a strange, uncanny valley kind of way, except for his mouth. His lips were so thin they were virtually nonexistent and it had such a width to it that it was almost ear to ear, like a natural Chelsea grin.


I noticed as the weeks went on that Frank wasn’t much of a talker, except for the usual “‘ello son” when he’d open the door to me and, weirdly, I never once saw him speak to Mum. In fact, the only time I saw him so much as look at her she would turn on her heels to fetch him something- another drink, his dinner. None of this sat right with me, but the only time I could take it up directly with Mum without him there was on the phone and every time she would tell me “that’s just his way”. And so, I would smile politely and not make waves. I told my wife about these changes but she also told me not to worry and that Mum could handle herself.


On and on this went for months; each visit the house a little dirtier, darker and eventually, danker. Soon I began to dread it when Sunday would roll around. The awkward silences, off putting darkness and a stench that hung so heavy in the air I’d almost gag as soon as frank would open the door. “Trouble with the plumbing boy,” Frank would say, but I was sure it was something more. Something unnatural.


Eventually, Mum stopped answering my calls. My visits on Sunday would only go as far as Frank answering the door to tell me she was ill, busy or away for the evening. Weeks went by, then months, with no contact. I was getting seriously concerned. I even tried the police several times, pleading for them to go round and check on her, but I heard nothing back.


By the time winter came, I’d reached my breaking point. I stormed over to Mum’s and slammed my fist on the door so hard I almost broke it. Nothing. Again and again I pounded for what seemed like an age but nothing, not so much as a peep from inside. After the longest time I had to admit defeat, but as I turned to leave I heard a sound, the lock clicking.


My relief was swiftly replaced by fear as I spun round to see a dimly lit figure through a crack in the now open door. 

“‘Ello son”.


Barely a whisper, but unmistakably Frank.


He’d already dissolved into the blackness before the words could reach my lips. 


“Where’s my mother frank?” I screamed into the nothingness.


“In ‘ere, me boy”.


I stepped in over the threshold, instantly met by that putrid, festering odour.
Eyes burning, breath choked- I could barely make out my surroundings as I made my way through my mother’s once beautiful home. Waste littered what little of the floor I could make out, mould coated the walls and the air hung so heavy I could barely breathe.


“Mum?” I called out. “Where are you?”


“Through ‘ere, son.” replied Frank from the living room. 


As I entered the room I could make out two figures in the dark; one small, sat on the sofa, and one large- larger than Frank- stood by the window with the curtains closed tight.


“I’m glad you’re ‘ere, boy” the looming figure whispered. “We’re due a little chat”. 


As my vision adjusted to the dark, I saw the large silhouette begin to grow features; a strangely familiar face, nonexistent lips and an unearthly ear to ear grin. Frank. But much younger and larger than before.


Terrified, I could barely muster the words, “Where’s my mother, Frank?”. He gave no answer save a light tilt of his head toward the sofa. What I saw will stay with me for the rest of my days. 


Mum. Slumped over on the sofa, flesh ripped from her bones, innards spilled out onto the floor, half eaten. I turned to Frank, petrified.  


“Just you and me now, sonny boy!” he cackled, spit flying from his enormous lizard like maw.

How I was able to pull myself together I will never know, but somehow I regained control of my legs just long enough to run from that cesspit of a house, Frank’s guttural laughter growing distant behind me.


I told no one what I saw that day except my wife and the police. I doubt my wife believed me, I think she assumes it was a psychotic break or something.


The police went to the house but said they found nothing. It had been scrubbed clean, as if no one had ever been there.
I’ve not seen Frank since, but I did begin receiving letters not long afterwards.


Each one simply says “Hello son, love Dad”.
