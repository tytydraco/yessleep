The following script has been transcribed to a digital document, following the national park service's discovery ot a series of notes, weighed down my rocks.


I am lost.

All I can hear are the insects. They speak to me. They pester me. They buzz into my ear and remind me how clueless I truly am to find myself off the trail, a curious, large mistake.

I am alone, but I somehow feel accompanied in the empty shadows of this sunset. I have passed many tire tracks, of which the maintenance tractors left behind. Not only have I not seen a trail for 2 days, all I've been walking on is untouched forest floor. I have managed to outrun two bears and four coyotes. There is no food. No water. I am in pain. At a crossroads, and there isn't even anything to end my own life with that doesn't involve a bear mauling.

I think of my mother, my father. The girlfriend I left behind. Surely they've noticed I'm gone and have sent search parties. Oh, curse my curiosity.


Note 2
________

(Blood droplets of type O+ has been recovered from this note.)

I cut myself on a branch. I had to hop down a pretty steep embankment, I was being followed by a strange humanoid figure... Its eyes glowed. It was hungry for me. How goddamn far have I wandered? I have walked dozens of miles without food or water. I have been seeing rocks with cryptic engravings, that of a language I do not recognize to be earthly. They are chalked with a reddish-yellow substance. They are not trail markers. I feel watched whenever I stand near them.

Note 3
_______
I continue to see the same trees and rocks over and over again. I have been walking in a constant direction consistently. If I've been going in a circle, then nixon is still president. Little things change. Maybe a small hole in the ground forms, maybe an oak tree is a birch tree the next time I go by. I am stuck in a wormhole, or I am going insane.

Note 4
________
On my 53rd pass of the paradox, I see piles of headless, rotting deer. On my 55th pass, I see headless bears hanging from trees. I am being closed in. It's coming for me.

Note 5
_______
I caught a glimpse of it. It is hairless. It stands on two legs. It covers its pelvis with human hair. Its eyes glow red. I jumped into an old basement to avoid its presence and cried myself to sleep.

Note 6
_______
(This is the last note obtained by the national park service. It, too, has type O+ blood, soaking nearly three quarters of the page. The following text was transcribed from aggressively scribbled letters in blood and what appears to be oak ash.)
