**October 22, 2010: a small town in the Midwest**

*”cant wait to see you tonight”* the text read, my cheeks warmed as my heart fluttered. It was crazy to me, I actually had a date lined up. How stupid of me to think it was such a good thing. Antonio was a closeted nineteen year old guy in college and I was just a sixteen year old sophomore in high school. He told me that he thought for both of our “safety” and “well being” we’d keep it on the DL. Me being young dumb and naive I hoped for the best and was absolutely sure he was a good guy. For the most part and from what I could tell at least was that he was a good guy. Antonio was kind and gentle and knew all the right things to say to make me feel comfortable. I told my mom I was going to the homecoming football game and then told my friends that I couldn’t make it to the game because I had to work. I know, another bad idea. I shouldn’t have lied about where I was but I didn’t think anyone would have understood.

I met him at nine that night at the park on the west end of town… West Willow Park we called it. I was waiting on the swings when he pulled up in a silver Stratus, he parked near the picnic tables. I watched as he climbed out of the driver side and looked around until he spotted me and waved shyly. I waved back as I nervously got on my feet and began walking towards him. Him rounding his car and making his way to me keeping his hands in his jacket pockets. He was tall, I mean I’m not tall myself standing at 5’9” but he was I’m guessing 6’2” and had broad shoulders. He smiled a sweet and friendly smile when we met under the light, nervously I smiled back. He was impossibly cute, his smile was perfect and white his skin was tanned and his brown eyes sparkled under the street light. His shaggy dark brown hair neatly styled and a slight stubble on his chin. 

“Hey.” He said in a soft sweet yet deep voice. 

“Hi.” I responded shyly, he chuckled and held out his arms for a hug. I wrapped my arms around him and he gave me a warm embrace. 

“I’m nervous too. But don’t worry, I got you.” He reassured me as he let me go. I nodded and we began walking and talking as we made our way along the moonlit trails. He told me so much about himself and how he’s going to the community college just outside of town and staying in a house with like six other guys and how he’s in the power line program and how he’s always been curious about his sexuality but was always too nervous and scared to pursue anyone until he met me. He told me everything I wanted to hear, like how I was handsome and special and everything he ever dreamed of. I was so infatuated with him at this point and everything felt so perfect and magical.
The trail ran along the river that bordered the little town and eventually would run under the bridge that led to the highway leaving town. It wasn’t a long bridge, only a four lane road but the darkness was unsettling and I didn’t really like going under it anyway. I stopped and hesitated when Antonio took my hand and smiled down to me. My heart began to beat quickly in my chest as he led me along the trail. My fears were gone as I followed him, we stopped halfway through and his hand slid up my arm and rested on my shoulder as he turned to face me. My eyes adjusted to the darkness but I could barely make out his face however they did adjust enough for me to see his eyes looking down at me. 

“Rayven, can I kiss you?” He asked quietly, I nodded in response and realized he probably couldn’t see me well.

“Yes.” I whispered nervously, breathing deeply, my first kiss. He placed the crook of his finger under my chin tilting my face up towards him. I felt his breath as he leaned in slowly. My heart began to beat harder in my chest as I closed my eyes and felt his lips touch to mine, my hand moved to his chest as we kissed and I could feel his heart pounding. I was in absolute bliss when I felt something else, I felt him jerk forward quickly and then… a sharp searing pain in my stomach, I pulled back as the knife slid out of me and warm thick blood covered the bottom left side of my shirt, I clenched the spot on my stomach.

“I’m sorry.” He said, reaching out and grabbing my arm. I pulled my arm away from his grasp and my fight or flight instincts kicked in. I rammed the palm up and into his nose. He let out a pained scream, I pushed past him and began to run. Unfortunately I didn’t get far, as suddenly as the adrenaline hit everything began spinning and my legs became weak. I was bleeding out and fast. I stumbled after a few steps as I reached the other end of the bridge leaving the darkness, I was bathed in moonlight. I tripped over my own feet and I stumbled sideways falling off the trail onto hard jagged rocks. I tried to get up but lost my balance and fell down again rolling down the rocks toward the river. I could hear the footsteps as he quickly approached me.
 
“No please.” I whispered. Somehow I managed to get to my feet, weakly only getting no more than two steps away before I felt Antonio’s body slam into me as he tackled me from behind. We went falling hard into mud, rocks and the shallow water. I flailed and tried with everything I had left in me to get up but my hands sunk into the mud. I could barely hear him over my panic and the splashing of the water, but he was saying something I couldn’t make out. I felt the familiar pain again this time in my back. The blade was plunged into me and I tried to scream but my mouth filled with water and mud. I couldn’t see anything and I knew this was it. This is where I was going to die. I gave up and let go as my body became weaker and weaker, the pain subsided and my body slowly went numb, it got so quiet. And just for a second I felt nothing… I felt what I believed was at peace. People talk about seeing a light or hearing their loved ones calling for them but when I died I didn’t feel anything after the pain of being stabbed and drowned. I don’t see anything. There was just nothing for me… just darkness. At least until there wasn’t.
