The ants started in the summer. Nothing  unusual, just a few that crawled their way into the kitchen to snack on  bits of food. Penny had been working extra hard in the garden that year,  trying to transform flower beds into something that might produce food.  I didn’t think she was going to have a lot of luck with it, the weather  being as unpredictable as it was, but it was worth a try, given how  unpredictable everything else was. In between that and the compost pile,  we got a lot of attention from the wildlife, scroungers and feeders and  everything else that was being pushed out by the new development. I  suppose in all that digging and planting we might have stirred something  up.

The days started to get shorter, but still the  ants came, the once tiny bands of scouts turning into small riots of  black wriggling that surrounded any food dropped on the floor. It wasn’t  long before there were trains of ants marching their way up the  counters to rob the kitchen of whatever they might find there.

I admired their industriousness, but them  getting onto the counters was the last straw for me. Penny just said to  wait until the weather got colder, so I did, but that only made things  worse. The colder it got, and that autumn it got cold fast, the more  ants we found. Soon it wasn’t just in the kitchen, but any place that  they might forage.

So I bought the poison, something not  dangerous to humans, but a spreading toxin to ants and insects,  something new called Terra Meta Borax. You put a few drops of the liquid  somewhere you knew the ants would be and its sweet scent would lure  them to it. It wouldn’t kill them straight away, but rather let them  lift little toxic globules back to the colony so it would kill the nest  instead of a single ant. I wasn’t exactly sure how it worked, but it  somehow involved a molecularly enhanced boric acid, so I can’t imagine  it was a pleasant way to go.

It worked, though. The ants stopped. We’d  still see a few in the bathroom, which didn’t make sense to me – I don’t  think ants eat waste. It was the warmest room in the house, though,  sitting above the water-heater and HVAC units in the crawlspace.

Eventually, the ones in the bathroom really  started to bug (ha ha) Penny. The rare long bath she took was one of the  few luxuries in a busy life, and the ants were upsetting that small  comfort. So I cleared some space and put down poison, spattering more  droplets than I had ever used before. Finished, I backed up quick,  startled at the number of ants that came streaming out, tiny black  bodies, antenna wiggling, searching and fevered for the toxic  archipelago I had created.

Their excitement unsettled me, seeing so many  swarming to embrace a slow, chemical death. I put that aside as  childish, though, telling myself that the poison was designed to attract  them, and that’s what it was doing.

Their numbers in the bathroom dwindled until  one day Penny finished filling the tub and moments later I heard her  scream. I rushed in, an unexpected level of adrenaline quickening my  feet, but it was only Penny having quickly retracted a toe from the ice  cold water of the bath she had just drawn.

I told her I’d check the water-heater in the  morning. She wasn’t happy about it, but she was a kind enough that she  didn’t press it that night. The crawlspace might be big enough that you  didn’t have to go hand and knee into it, but it was a low, earthen  cellar. We’d put in a sump pump and gutters to route the waters that  came down in the torrential winter rains, but it was still wet and  muddy.

There was only a single light down there, and  it wasn’t reliable, and the water-heater was far beyond the reach of  whatever shard of light might sneak in past the entrance. So in the  morning I took a light when I stepped outside and circled the house,  coming to the cellar entrance, a half-door set into the house’s brick  foundation. I had to lean hard into it, pushing the wooden boards  through a shelf of mud that had built up on the inside, black muck  seeping from underneath it.

Inside was as dark as the soil. I shined the  light around, but it only lit a few yards. Our house wasn’t a big one,  but under it, the cellar was like its own cavern system.

I stepped in, my feet sinking into the sludge,  causing me to curse the handyman who had installed the gutters, certain  they and the sump pump must have failed. Grateful I had rubber boots  on, I moved forward, pointing my light in the direction I knew the  water-heater should be, but not seeing anything. There was nothing but  an inky darkness, with occasional ripples, like fragments of light  reflecting from the bottom of a deep well.

I struggled to find my way to the nearest  structural pillar, hoping to use it as a guidepost. Each was solid gray  cinder block, steady as the rock it was made of, but they all had  vanished in the dark. I found one by slipping in the mud and blindly  catching myself on it, barely balancing on the uneven ground.

My heart rate and hair rose as I tried to pull  my hand away. The ooze around the pillar held me firmly, and my eyes  widened in the lightless cellar as I felt my hand sink further into the  ooze around it, exuding a familiar sweet smell. I yanked my arm, trying  to free myself, but the dark held me fast. I lifted one foot, then the  other, trying to wriggle loose, but I couldn’t move.

I breathed through my rising panic, cutting  through the growing pressure of my own pulse to raise the flashlight to  get a better look at my trapped hand. As I did, though, the beam swept  over something deeper in the cellar.

I was far enough in that I should have been  able to see the brick that marked the other end of the foundation.  Instead, what I had taken for darkness rippled and moved, giving a sense  of immense size, like a bull from one of the local rodeos.

It didn’t move like a bull, though. It rolled  like mudslide, a wave of sediment, a lightless composition of rot. I  felt the call for help forming in my throat turn into a scream as it got  closer. I saw its surface wriggle with tiny black stalks, ants’ black  bodies. But there were other things as well.

There were bits of fur and a raccoon skull,  skin like a toad, a pair of antlers, all of them tumbling over each  other as the dark suspension rolled forward. My panicked arm struggled  to get free even as the necrotic melange swept across my feet. I dropped  the light to use both hands to pull against the pillar. It hit the  ground with a wet pop, releasing more of that sweet smell, its light  shining onto an unblinking, inhuman eye before sinking into darkness.  Behind me, something shut the cellar door.

I’m not sure who’s writing this now. But I can hear my Penny in her bath, and she isn’t complaining anymore.
