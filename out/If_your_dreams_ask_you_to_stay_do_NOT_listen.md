I was always the imaginative sort. Growing up in a concrete jungle, in a bustling city full of skyscrapers and traffic jams, I was surrounded by people yet alone. Friends? Sure, a few. But I mostly preferred my own company, even in high school.

This introversion led to the development of my interests - reading, painting, and most importantly, lucid dreaming. Chess was a favorite family pastime too, with my parents and younger sister. 

Although I adored each hobby I engaged in, lucid dreaming held a special place in my heart. The exhilaration of creating my own world, outwitting the unconscious mind, gave me a thrill that no other hobby did. It was a victory over reality, a haven where I was the master and commander. It gave me an incomparable joy. My dreams became my sanctuary. Sometimes, I'd let an entire day pass, exploring these dreamlands.

My grades, while passable, were nothing to brag about. Higher education wasn't my goal. I was fascinated by dreams, and I wanted to study them. After high school, I decided to devote myself to understanding dreams and their mysterious workings. 

A few years later, I found myself working at a research lab dedicated to dream studies. They had state-of-the-art equipment for dream monitoring and analysis. I was overjoyed to be part of something so close to my passion.

Over time, I became proficient in controlling and interpreting my dreams. I knew all the cues, the tricks to stay grounded, the signs of dream destabilization, the nuances of subconscious communication. I was familiar with every little detail of the dream realm.

Then one night, something changed. I found myself in an unfamiliar landscape in my dream. A typical occurrence, nothing alarming, until I heard a voice. This voice was different, something I'd never heard before in my dream or waking life. It was soothing, hypnotic, and it kept asking me to stay, to live in the dream world forever.

I told myself it was just a dream, just another subconscious manifestation. Yet, something felt wrong. The voice persisted, each night, each dream. It kept asking, pleading, sometimes even commanding. "Stay," it would say. "This is your true home."

Despite the unease, my curiosity got the best of me. One night, I decided to seek out the voice. I was in control, I was the dream architect, I thought. What harm could there be in exploring a bit?

I wandered through the dream landscape, following the voice's trail. It led me to a massive door standing alone amidst the emptiness. An unsettling feeling washed over me, but I pushed it away and opened the door.

What I saw shook me to my core. It was a mirror, but instead of my reflection, it displayed a monstrous, grotesque creature. As tall as a skyscraper, with eyes as black as the abyss. This was not a part of my dream design.

I was horrified. I had never seen anything like this in my dreams. But before I could react, the creature reached out of the mirror and pulled me in.

I woke up, drenched in sweat. My room was the same, the city outside my window was the same. But something felt different, wrong. I brushed it off as a nightmare and tried to resume my day. 

But things didn't feel right. The food tasted bland, the sounds were muted, the colors were washed out. I thought I was just shaken from the dream, but then I tried to wake up. I couldn't. I was trapped in my dream, in a distorted version of my reality.

I have been stuck here since then. I've tried everything I know about lucid dreaming to wake up, but nothing works. The creature sometimes shows up, lurking around corners, watching me from afar, reminding me of my mistake.

My phone doesn't work here. But surprisingly, my computer does. I managed to get this message out in hopes someone might see it, might understand.

Please, if you're reading this, heed my warning: If your dreams ask you to stay, do NOT listen. Don't let your curiosity overpower your judgment. You might find yourself in a place where dreams turn into nightmares, and waking up is an impossible feat.
