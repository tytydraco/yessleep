It streaked across the night sky, a shard of eternity slicing clean through the darkness. And there I was, staring out the kitchen window, hands submerged in soapy water, watching as something far grander than my little life decided to unfold. The view framed between the curtains looked like a painting brought to life, that fiery streak blazing its way across an endless, star-spattered canvas, as if the show had been cued up just for me.

I lived in an old house, weathered but stubborn, the kind of place that seemed almost stitched into the land itself. It had been my grandmother’s, then my mother’s, and now it was mine, though I often wondered if I was meant to want more than what they’d left behind. Out here, in the tame emptiness of Nowhere, USA, nothing extraordinary ever happened. This land was a monument to monotony, its cycles as predictable as the creak of floorboards under my feet at night.  

The days ticked by—the same cars kicking up dust on the gravel road, the same crops swaying under the same sun. Even time itself felt like it moved slower here. But tonight, the galaxy had reminded me the world was bigger than these four walls, bigger than the field stretching endlessly behind the house. And for the first time in a long time, I felt small in a way that didn’t crush me.  

This meteor shower wasn’t just an interruption. It was *the* interruption. The kind of cosmic performance that stops you in your tracks, makes you forget the pile of dishes you’ve been putting off, and lets you imagine something brighter, larger, and maybe even better.  Then my eyes caught it; one streak among many, but this one burned differently. A defiant, fiery thread, as though it had pulled free from the tapestry of the stars. 

It moved like it was alive, brighter than the others and wild with purpose. I found myself gripping the edge of the sink, leaning closer to the glass as though I could somehow touch it. I wanted to reach through the window, out past the night, and catch it in my hands before it disappeared forever.  

And then, impossibly, it changed.  

The streak jolted sideways, bending so sharply it was like the sky itself had flinched. My stomach dropped. Meteors didn’t do that. My breath hitched as the light folded into a dive, nosediving toward the earth with the precision of a hawk closing in on its prey.  

The streak disappeared behind the treeline at the edge of my family’s property, plunging into the forest with an unearthly kind of force. My heart felt like it was trying to hammer its way through my chest, beating louder than it ever had in this quiet, predictable place. 

For a moment, I braced myself, gripping the counter, waiting for the boom—the explosion. Surely, the ground would shake, the windows would rattle. Maybe a column of fire would rise into the sky like a signal from whatever corner of the universe it came from.  

But nothing came.  

No crash, no fireball, no tremor. The night remained as still as it had been seconds before. The only sound was the faint sigh of wind brushing through the trees, as though the forest had caught the meteor in its arms and hushed it back to sleep.  

 My body surged into motion, adrenaline igniting every nerve. I threw open the back door, the old screen slamming against the frame, and bolted into the yard. I didn’t stop to grab a flashlight or even think. The thoughts swirling in my brain pushed me forward faster than my boots could handle. The brittle crunch of grass and dirt underfoot echoed in my ears as I tore across the yard, the moonlight carving long, frantic shadows of my limbs against the ground.  

The cool night air burned against my throat with each breath, but I kept running, chasing the glow imprinted in my memory. That thing from the sky—whatever it was—had landed out there, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. 

My feet beat a frantic rhythm as I sprinted toward it, weaving between the familiar rows of wild grass. My chest heaved as I imagined it; a hunk of smoking rock, alien and unmistakable, something I could claim as mine. It could be valuable. No, bigger than valuable. It could be *legendary*.  

The field fell away behind me as I reached the forest's edge. The shadows deepened here, the moonlight barely making it past the thick canopy above. My steps slowed. I moved cautiously now, the dry grass transitioning into lumpy dirt and scattered stones beneath my boots. 

The clearing emerged ahead, a pale, circular space where the moon hung low, spilling its ghostly silver light over the ground. I hesitated at the edge of it, my rapid breaths fogging faintly in the cool air. Something here was wrong. I didn’t know how or why, but I felt it. The air had changed. It wasn’t just quiet; it was alive with tension, like the moment before lightning strikes.  

The woods were eerily silent.

Then the sky shifted.  

I tilted my head upward just in time to see them, a chaotic swarm of birds fleeing the treetops. Black shapes against the gray sky, their frantic wings beating like drums in an irregular rhythm. They weren’t just startled; they were scared. I could feel their panic in the air as they veered north, moving as a single mass away from the clearing.  

I swallowed hard, forcing down the nerves clawing at my chest.

After what felt like an eternity of trudging through the woods, I finally saw it, the source of the glow I’d glimpsed earlier. The faint red light flickered between the trees, pulsing like a heartbeat, drawing me closer with each cautious step. I pushed through brambles and uneven ground, my boots crunching on twigs, until I broke through a thicket and stopped dead in my tracks.  

It wasn’t a meteor.  

Nestled in a shallow crater of upturned soil and broken roots was something utterly alien. It gleamed under the faint moonlight, its surface smooth and metallic, reflecting the faint flicker of its own red beacon. The object stood at least twice my height, its sphere so unnervingly perfect it felt out of place against the chaotic wildness of the forest. Its surface shimmered faintly, like steel kissed by oil, shifting subtly as I moved closer.  

I froze, staring at the thing in utter disbelief. I’d seen meteors on TV, in books—jagged chunks of rock scorched by their plunge through the atmosphere. This was no lifeless hunk of space debris. It was *designed*. Built.  

A metallic pod, pulsing with purpose.  

My chest tightened as I edged closer, the soil beneath my boots loose and uneven from the thing’s impact. The air around it felt thicker somehow, weighed down by an unseen presence. 

Then it happened.  

With a hiss of air so sharp it made me flinch, a jagged seam split across the surface of the pod. For a moment, it was silent, the opening unmoving, holding its breath. And then, with a mechanical groan, a hatch folded open, spilling pale light across the disturbed ground.  

I stumbled back instinctively, my pulse hammering in my ears. My foot caught on a root, and I barely kept myself from falling flat. Heart in my throat, I scrambled behind the nearest tree, pressing my back against the rough bark like it might save me from… whatever *this* was.  

Peeking around the trunk, I squinted at the pod, the blinking beacon casting faint shadows that danced across the crater. The opening gaped wide now, glowing faintly from within. I swallowed hard, forcing my breath to stay quiet. My lips moved before I could stop them.  

“What the *hell* is that?” I whispered, the words barely audible, my voice cracking just the tiniest bit.  

The cold air fogged in front of me as I stood there, frozen, gripping the bark for stability. I didn’t know what to expect—not in the slightest.

From the open hatch, something began to spill—a dark, viscous substance that shimmered faintly under the moonlight. The fluid moved with unsettling intention, pooling across the disturbed soil before slithering upward, scaling the exterior of the pod in slow, undulating waves. It spread across the metallic surface like ink in water, coating the pod from top to bottom until the entire structure seemed to shift hues, the perfect sphere now cloaked in rippling violet.  

I stared, unable to move, my fingers digging into the bark of the tree. The slime pulsed, moving with a life of its own, its motion hypnotic and wrong all at once. Then, as suddenly as it had started, it shifted direction. The ooze began to retract, sliding back down the pod and pooling at its base once more with a wet, sickening sound.  

The red beacon atop the pod blinked once, then went dark.  

 Then, from inside the hatch, something began to move.  

A figure.  

At first, it was just a shape—a folded form, curled tight like an embryo in a womb. The light from the pod’s interior reflected off it, revealing a body of smooth, seamless silver. 

Slowly, impossibly, the figure began to uncurl, stretching its limbs with the eerie fluidity of liquid metal. It emerged, stepping out of the hatch with deliberate grace, its movements alien and mechanical all at once.  

My heart seized as the silver form straightened, standing tall and still as a statue. It had no eyes, no features to speak of, but somehow its polished surface gave off the impression of awareness. My stomach twisted into a knot as it tilted its head unnervingly, turning directly toward my hiding spot.  

“I can see you over there.”  

The voice cut through the air like a blade, cold and mechanical, layered with a deep, unnatural reverb that dug into my chest. 

“You’re scared, so the heat of your body makes you easy to see. I think they call it fight or flight.” 

The words sounded alien, a monotone growl paired with an echoing distortion that made my skin crawl.

It stood motionless for a moment, its featureless, silver head fixed in my direction, as if daring me to act. The air seemed to vibrate with the weight of its presence. 

My body, however, needed no prompting.  

Instinct took over.  

I ran.  

Panic surged through my veins as I tore through the woods, feet slipping on uneven ground and snapping twigs underfoot. 

I didn't dare look back.  

The forest blurred around me, shadows giving way to moonlight as I burst out of the trees and into the field, the open space offering no comfort. 

By the time I slammed the back door shut behind me, every part of my body was trembling. I locked it without thinking, leaning against the door and gasping for air, my mind reeling.  

I returned to the kitchen, I just stood there, gripping the counter and staring out the window. The yard stretched into the night, its emptiness giving nothing away. In the distance, beyond the treeline, the forest loomed silently, as if nothing had ever stirred within it.  

My eyes scoured the property for any sign of movement. Nothing. Not a glint of silver, no shimmer of violet ooze creeping toward the house. I wanted to believe I was safe, that whatever had stepped out of that pod was gone—or maybe, just maybe, had never existed. Once I was certain I hadn’t been followed, I forced myself to step away from the sink and head to my bedroom.  

Collapsing onto my mattress, I pulled the covers over me like they might shield me from the memory of what I’d seen. My mind replayed it against my will, the silver humanoid, the sound of its voice cutting through the woods, the way it had turned toward me without so much as a glance.  

“This is just a dream,” I whispered to myself, my voice small and unconvincing. “Just a weird, *weird* dream.”  

I squeezed my eyes shut, willing sleep to take me, hoping morning would bring the kind of clarity that only daylight can offer. But sleep didn’t come easily, and when it finally did, it was restless, fractured by vague, unplaceable nightmares.  

A week passed.  

At first, every sound around the house set me on edge—the groan of the old wood floors, the hum of wind moving through the chimney, the distant rustle of trees beyond the yard. I kept waiting for something to happen, for a knock at the door in the middle of the night, for silver fingers to tap against the windows, for… *something*.  

But nothing came.  

Life settled back into its usual rhythm, slow and ordinary as always. The days felt long but uneventful.

A week turned into routine. The silver figure stayed in the woods, or maybe it had vanished altogether, swallowed up by the same darkness that had delivered it. I stopped peering out the window so much. Stopped holding my breath at night, waiting for some metallic voice to call my name.  

One languid afternoon, I slouched on the faded couch in the living room, the hum of the old television casting a lazy glow against the walls. The screen buzzed with the muted chaos of a sitcom.

I wasn’t watching, not really. The cheerful noise was just a distraction, a barrier between me and the uneasy silence pressing against the edges of the room. My gaze drifted absently to a crack in the wall, the kind of crack that seemed to grow longer every time you noticed it.

And then, a knock at the door.  

It wasn’t loud, but in the stillness of the room, the sound cut through like a blade. I flinched, jolted out of my haze, a prickle of unease sliding down my spine. Out here, knocks didn’t happen. Not casually, anyway. My nearest neighbor lived a mile away from me, and even they only stopped by once a year—maybe twice if they were desperate for a tool.  

For a moment, I froze, staring at the door as though it might knock again on its own. My heart thudded faster, not out of fear exactly, but out of that strange mix of curiosity and dread you feel when something shifts out of place, when the expected rhythm of your life is disrupted. Finally, I pulled myself up from the couch, each step deliberate, my breath steady but shallow.  

I reached the door. Peeking through the peephole, I saw… her.  

A woman.  

Not just any woman.  

I opened the door cautiously, my grip still firm on the knob, and then—everything stopped. She was standing there, framed in the late-afternoon light like she belonged in another world entirely. She wasn’t just beautiful; she was *impossible*. The kind of beauty that makes you question reality itself, that warps the air around it. Her features were so precise, so flawless, that they seemed engineered—high cheekbones, luminous skin, and eyes that shimmered with a light that didn’t quite match the dim road behind her. Her hair cascaded over her shoulders in soft waves, the strands catching the sun just enough to make them seem unreal.  

And then she smiled. Not a big smile—small, subtle, almost knowing, like she already understood exactly what I was thinking. It hit me like a physical force, that smile. My tongue felt heavy in my mouth as I struggled to find words.  

“Hi,” she said, her voice as soft and smooth as velvet, with a musical lilt that tugged at something deep inside me. “I’m really sorry to bother you, but my car broke down just up the road.”  

I blinked, my brain stumbling over itself to keep up. “Oh, uh… did you need to use my phone or something?” My voice cracked—a humiliating betrayal—and I could feel the heat rush to my face.

She tilted her head, her smile deepening just a fraction. “No, actually. I was wondering if you might let me stay here for a few nights? Just until I can get someone to tow it into town. If that’s all right with you, of course.”  

For a moment, all I could do was stare at her, her words hanging in the air as my brain fumbled to process them. A strange woman, out here in the middle of nowhere, asking to stay in my house. Alone. Every rational part of me screamed that this wasn’t just unusual—it was downright bizarre. Alarms should have been blaring in my head. Red flags should’ve been stacking up like a tower. But there were no alarms, no flags. There was just *her*.  

Because nothing about her felt ordinary.  

I hesitated, my gaze flicking over her again, searching for some fault, some crack in the façade that might make sense of all this. But there was nothing. Only her perfect symmetry, her strange, steady calm, and the way her presence seemed to fill the space around her, like she was bending the world to suit her needs.  

I lived alone—had for years—and the idea of sharing my space, even temporarily, felt foreign. But then there was another thought, creeping in before I could stop it: *What if this was it?* What if she was the one? What if life, for once, was daring to hand me something extraordinary?  

I swallowed hard, clearing my throat as I tried to mask my hesitation. “Uh… yeah. I mean, why not? Sure. That’s fine.”  

The moment the words left my mouth, her face lit up with a smile so radiant it almost hurt to look at. Her teeth were dazzling, impossibly white and straight, like the glossy perfection of a magazine ad brought to life.  

“That’s so kind of you,” she said, taking a step closer. Her movements were graceful, deliberate, like she’d rehearsed every shift of her weight, every subtle glance. “Thank you so much for this. I promise I won’t be any trouble.”  

I stepped aside, my pulse quickening again as she brushed past me into the house. 

I lingered in the doorway for a moment, staring out at the empty road, half-expecting someone else to appear. A friend, a tow truck, anything to make this situation feel more grounded. But there was nothing. Just the fading daylight and the sound of her faintly humming to herself as she settled inside.  

I shut the door, the weight of it clicking into place behind me.  

This wasn’t how I thought my day would go.  

And yet, as I stood there, watching her impossibly perfect form moving through my living room, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d just stepped into something I wasn’t prepared for. Something I couldn’t fully understand.  

But then again, when life hands you the unthinkable, who are you to question it?  

We exchanged the usual pleasantries, the kind that fill the quiet but don’t say much. Names, places, vague snapshots of our lives. I told her where I’d grown up—a small, overlooked city with nothing to its name but a few dying factories and a football team no one rooted for. She smiled politely, her attention fixed on me like I was reciting something fascinating. But when I asked her where she was from, she hesitated.  

“Oh, just a small town,” she said, her voice light and airy—but hollow, like an echo in an empty room. The words felt rehearsed, detached, as if she didn’t quite believe them herself. She didn’t offer more, and I didn’t press her, though the vagueness clung to me, gnawing at the edges of my curiosity.  

It wasn’t just the way she dodged questions. It was the way she moved through the house, like a ghost learning to haunt it. She floated from room to room with slow, deliberate steps, her gaze trailing along the furniture, the pictures on the wall, the leftover clutter I hadn’t bothered to tidy up. Her silence wasn’t shy—it was calculating. Like she wasn’t just taking in her surroundings but studying them. Like she was *studying me*.  

I tried to push the thought aside, chalking it up to my overactive imagination. But the first real crack in her facade came during dinner.  

I’d thrown together a modest meal—the kind of casserole that carried the taste of nostalgia more than actual flavor, lifted straight from one of my mom’s old recipe cards. A couple of beers sat on the table, condensation sliding down the bottles as we ate under the soft glow of the TV. The sitcom I’d left on earlier was still playing—some cheap, laugh-track-laden comedy about mismatched roommates. Background noise.  

At first, we ate in silence, the clink of forks on plates the only real sound between us. But I could feel her eyes on me, watching, observing, as if trying to decode something. Every so often, she’d glance away, but not before I caught the flicker of her stare.  

Then it happened.  

The first canned joke—a predictable gag about a character slipping on a banana peel—landed. I chuckled, barely thinking about it, the laugh more a reflex than genuine amusement. And then she laughed.  

But it wasn’t a normal laugh.  

It was loud, sharp, almost violent—a *guffaw* that reverberated through the room like the crack of a whip. My fork froze midair, and I turned to her, startled. She was staring straight at the TV, her face stretched into a broad grin that didn’t look quite right, her cheeks pulled just a little too high, her eyes just a little too blank.  

The laugh didn’t belong to her.  

It didn’t stop there. Every time I so much as cracked a smile at one of the sitcom’s tired punchlines, her laugh followed a beat behind mine, booming and hollow. It was never quite in sync, always just a second too late, as if she’d been waiting for her cue. I started holding my reactions in, just to test her, to see if she’d do it unprompted. She didn’t. The ripple of laughter only came when I made a sound, like some eerie mimicry of my own responses.  

By the third or fourth round of her strange, echoing guffaws, I couldn’t focus on the show anymore. My attention was fully on her, on the way her face twitched into that overly controlled smile with each laugh. It wasn’t just the sound that was wrong—it was everything about her in those moments. The way she barely touched her food, pushing it around her plate in smooth, absent gestures. The way her movements felt mechanical, deliberate, as if she were mimicking a routine she’d seen but never lived.  

I tipped my beer back, the bottle cold against my lips, trying to settle my nerves. Maybe I was overthinking it. Maybe she just had one of those laugh styles that didn’t match her appearance. Maybe she’d never grown up watching this kind of slapstick nonsense.  

But no matter how I tried to rationalize it, the feeling lingered—that creeping realization that whatever she was doing, it wasn’t natural. It wasn’t the laughter of someone who *felt* the humor—it was the laughter of someone who *wanted* to feel it, who was trying to piece it together, like an actor who hadn’t quite learned their lines.  

The TV droned on, the sitcom’s overblown laugh track filling the gaps in our conversation. I glanced at her out of the corner of my eye, my thoughts tangling in themselves. She looked perfect, just as stunning as when I’d opened the door to her earlier, her features serene and unbothered. But now there was something beneath that perfection, something rippling under the surface.  

Something I couldn’t name.  

I swallowed another sip of beer, the realization flickering momentarily before I buried it.  

*Don’t overthink it,* I told myself.  

Then her phone rang.  

It wasn’t loud, just a soft, mechanical chime, but it shattered the fragile awkwardness hanging between us. Her hand twitched, freezing for a fraction of a second before she reached into her pocket and pulled it out. The screen’s pale glow lit up her face, but her expression was neutral. Too neutral. She glanced at it the way someone looks at a crossword clue they’re not interested in solving. Then, almost as an afterthought, she turned to me with a practiced, apologetic smile.  

“Sorry, it’s my friend. I need to take this,” she said, her voice light and pleasant, as though the moment wasn’t strange at all.  

“Of course.” I nodded quickly, almost glad for the break from the strained air between us. I watched as she stood and stepped into the hallway, her movements as fluid and deliberate as ever. The faint sound of the ringing phone echoed through the house, growing softer as she drifted further away.  

And then it stopped.  

I turned back to the TV, grateful for the distraction, but as the seconds stretched into minutes, a strange realization struck me.  

I didn’t hear her speak.  

The sitcom continued its parade of jokes, each laugh track punctuating the silence like a metronome, but I couldn’t hear anything else. No soft murmuring. No hushed explanations to her so-called friend. Just… nothing.  

My stomach tightened.  

Setting my fork down, I tried to focus on the flashing images on the screen. Maybe she was just listening. That wasn’t weird, was it? Some people pause when they answer the phone, waiting for the other person to ramble on. But no matter how I tried to rationalize it, the silence pressed heavier on me with every passing second.  

I leaned back in my chair, my ears straining for any sound. The creak of a floorboard, a murmur too faint to decipher—*anything*. But all I could hear was the canned laughter and the low hum of the refrigerator humming from the kitchen.  

I swallowed hard, forcing myself to take deep breaths. Just let it go. Just let her be.  

Except I couldn’t.  

That night, sleep refused to come. I tossed and turned, my body restless, my mind circling the pieces of the evening like a moth trapped under a glass. On paper, nothing had gone wrong—but still, something gnawed at me. Disappointment. Unease. A creeping realization that the connection I’d foolishly imagined with her wasn’t forming. I’d let myself hope for something life-changing, something extraordinary, and instead, I was left with a feeling I couldn’t shake.  

At some point after midnight, I gave up. Frustration dragged me downstairs for a smoke, the house heavy with that peculiar after-midnight stillness where every creak in the floor feels deafening.  

I padded into the kitchen, the soft light from the porch filtering through the window. It wasn’t much, just enough to cast faint shapes into the dark room. But it was enough for me to see *her*.  

She was sitting at the kitchen table, hunched over slightly, holding the carton of milk in both hands. Her head tilted back, her throat moved with greedy, almost desperate gulps, like she hadn’t had a drink in days. The milk sloshed audibly as she drank straight from the carton, her body tense, focused, transfixed.  

I froze in the doorway. For a moment, confusion and irritation wrestled in my chest, neither quite winning.  

“Uh… what are you doing?”  

She stopped mid-sip, lowering the carton slowly. Her lips were streaked with milk, glistening in the dim light as she turned to look at me. Her expression was calm, unbothered, like there was nothing unusual about what she was doing.  

“I didn’t think this would taste so good,” she said evenly, her voice carrying the same strange rhythm I was starting to associate with her mannerisms. “Considering it comes from an animal.”  

I blinked, her words catching me off guard. “What are you talking about?”  

Her head tilted slightly, as though she were weighing how to answer. “I’ve never had milk before.” She held the carton up like it was some kind of trophy, her tone matter-of-fact, like this was the most normal confession in the world.  

I furrowed my brow, staring at her. “You’ve never had milk before? You said you grew up in a small town.” There was an edge to my voice now, disbelief mixing with unease.  

She shrugged like the conversation bored her, as if the specifics didn’t matter. “I didn’t think much of it.”  

“Well,” I muttered, trying to stifle the irritation bubbling to the surface, “small town or not, it’s rude to drink out of the carton in someone else’s house. You know that, right?”  

For a moment, she just stared at me, her head cocked slightly, her expression unreadable. Then, as though remembering the appropriate response, she nodded. “I’m sorry,” she said flatly. The words came easily, but there was no weight behind them. No real apology.  

Her affect startled me, disarming my annoyance almost immediately. She wasn’t defensive, but she wasn’t contrite either. It was like she’d said the words because that’s what people say in these situations—not because she felt them.  

“It’s… it’s fine,” I murmured, the tension in my voice softening. I turned away to grab the pack of cigarettes from the counter and lit one, inhaling deeply. Smoke curled around me as I leaned against the doorframe, my gaze falling back on her.  

She hadn’t moved. She just sat there, unnaturally still, her hands now folded neatly in her lap. There was something unsettling about her composure, the way she made no effort to mask the fact that she was watching me. Her pupils caught the faint light, reflecting it just enough to make them gleam in the dim kitchen.  

I took another drag. “You, uh, planning to go back to bed soon?” I asked, trying to hide the unease gnawing at me.  

She smiled faintly, her lips curling in that same strange, deliberate way I’d seen earlier. “I wasn’t tired,” she said simply.  

I exhaled slowly, the smoke hanging thick in the air. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but something about this moment—the milk, the stillness, her whole demeanor—felt wrong in a way that disturbed me more than I wanted to admit.  

I woke in the early hours of the morning, the house pressed under a suffocating silence. The faint glow of the moon slipped through the blinds, casting thin, pale lines against the ceiling. Something was wrong—I felt it in my chest, an ache of inescapable dread, sharp and oppressive, though I couldn’t explain why.  

The air seemed heavier, colder. My breath felt loud in the stillness as I slid out of bed and crept toward the bathroom. The floor creaked softly beneath my feet, each sound amplified in the perfect quiet.  

And then I heard her.  

As I passed the door to the guest room, her voice drifted out—low, steady, and chillingly precise, words delivered with an almost mechanical perfection. She was on the phone. Actually speaking this time.  

I froze in place, my heart thudding against my ribs. The door was cracked open just enough to let her voice slip through. I leaned closer, barely daring to breathe, straining to hear every syllable.  

**“The initial data transfer is complete,”** she said, her tone detached, clinical. **“The subject’s neural pathways have been mapped. Did you receive the biometric readings?”**  

Biometric readings? My stomach churned, my skin prickling.  

She paused, listened, then spoke again.  

**“Affirmative. The integration process will commence upon arrival. This dialect is… inefficient. We will adopt the local vernacular for the duration of the harvest.”**  

Harvest. 

The word rang in my ears like a warning bell.  

Her voice was calm, but there was something unnervingly final about it. No hesitation, no inflection. Just cold, calculated purpose.  

**“This planet is… bountiful,”** she continued, her tone unwavering. **“Rich in organic compounds, readily available water, and a diverse range of… biological specimens. A truly fertile ground for cultivation. The yield will be substantial. You all will thrive here. The harvest will be plentiful.”**  

My knees wobbled beneath me, the blood draining from my face. I clenched the doorframe to steady myself, feeling the chill of the wood under my fingers. Her words were wrong—too detached, too clinical to be anything but terrifying.  

She began pacing, her footsteps soft but deliberate, her shadow shifting across the faint light spilling into the hallway.  

“Are the preparatory measures finalized?”** she asked. **“The designated areas are primed for seeding? There is no turning back from this. This world is designated for reclamation. It is ripe for the harvest. Everything we require is already here, waiting for us to begin the reaping.”

She paused again, listening to whoever—or whatever—was on the other end of the line. When she spoke again, her voice sharpened, her tone carrying an edge of authority.  

“No. Physical transport is unnecessary. The energetic cost would be prohibitive. Why expend the resources when I can translocate you directly to the surface, ready for the harvest? It is far more… economical.”

“I have already established a primary vector. A… vessel, if you will. It is ripe for the taking. Ripe for the harvest.”

She said it so calmly, like it was nothing. But that word—*harvest*—felt like a blade slicing through me. I didn’t want to know what it meant.  

When she spoke again, her voice dropped, quieter but even more resolute.  

“Understood. Await the commencement of the harvest. The reaping will begin shortly.”

That was it. I couldn’t stay any longer. My legs moved on their own, carrying me back to my room as silently as possible. My heart was pounding so loudly I thought it might give me away.  

Once inside, I shut the door softly, pressing my back against the wood. My breaths came shallow and fast, my skin clammy with sweat. I slid down to the floor, my hands shaking uncontrollably as her words repeated in my mind.  

*"This world is designated for reclamation… ripe for the harvest."*  

I didn’t sleep. I couldn’t. Her voice haunted me, replaying over and over as if my brain refused to let go of it.  

*"Ripe for the harvest."*

I lay there, frozen in the bed, staring at the patterns of moonlight splashed across the ceiling. The shadows seemed to stretch and shift, alive with the weight of my terror.  

*"Ripe for the harvest."*

I told myself to sleep. To pretend I hadn’t heard anything.  

But then, the floor creaked.  

The sound was faint at first, so soft I thought I imagined it. But then it came again. Louder. Closer.  

My breath hitched.  

The guest room door opened.  

The slow, deliberate creak of the hinges sliced through the quiet, setting my nerves ablaze. I clamped my hand over my mouth to hold in the gasp that threatened to escape.  

The hallway outside my room filled with the faint sound of her footsteps.  

I forced myself to move, inching out of bed and to my door. My fingers trembled as I turned the knob, easing it open just enough to peek through the gap.  

She was there.  

But she wasn’t *her* anymore.  

Its skin gleamed in the moonlight, a shimmering, metallic silver that caught the faint light like polished steel. Its movements were smooth, inhuman, head tilting unnaturally as if it were scanning the hallway.  

It stepped forward, it’s glowing silver form filling the narrow corridor, and turned its head toward my door.  

**“Ripe for the harvest.”**  

I slammed the bedroom door shut, my chest heaving, panic crashing over me in waves.

I ran for the window.  

My fingers fumbled with the latch, shaking so violently it took me three tries to get it open. The frame stuck at first, stubborn and unyielding. 

“Come *on*,” I hissed under my breath, yanking at it with all the strength I could muster. Finally, with a groan of shifting wood, it loosened, sliding open just enough for me to squeeze through.  

The chill of the night air hit me as I swung one leg over the sill, then the other. For a split second, I hesitated. It wasn’t a short drop. The ground below seemed farther than I’d expected, the slope uneven, littered with dormant grass and jagged rocks.  

But staying was worse.  

With a deep breath, I pushed off.  

The world blurred for a brief second before my legs hit the ground with a brutal thud. Pain shot through my body like a bolt of lightning, and I crumpled forward, clutching at my knees. A sharp, dry gasp escaped my lips. My mind screamed for me to stop, to assess the damage, but I couldn’t. Not now.  

Adrenaline surged, numbing the worst of it. My legs screamed in protest as I forced them to move, stumbling forward into the dark. Every step sent shards of pain ricocheting through me, but I didn’t care. I couldn’t stay still. I couldn’t let her catch me.  

The neighbor’s house. One mile away.  

I focused on that single thought, clinging to it like a lifeline as my battered legs carried me forward. The forest seemed endless, the shadows stretching and contorting under the faint moonlight, each one threatening to spring to life. Every rustle was her. Every flicker of movement was her.  

“Don’t look back,” I told myself. A mantra. A desperate prayer.  

By the time I reached his house, I was barely standing. The small, sagging structure sat quietly at the edge of the road, its porch light casting a weak halo against the dark. My legs wobbled beneath me, and my lungs burned with each ragged breath. I stumbled up the porch steps and pounded on the door, my knuckles wrapping against the wood with a frantic rhythm.  

Seconds ticked by like hours before the door cracked open, revealing him—the neighbor I’d only spoken to a handful of times. His face was bleary with sleep, his eyes heavy-lidded. But as he took one look at me, his expression shifted.  

He didn’t just seem startled. He seemed *alarmed*.  

I must’ve looked like a ghost—a pale, wide-eyed specter cloaked in terror. Words sprang to my lips, desperate to explain, but they tangled together in a cacophony of panic. What could I even say? What could possibly make sense of what had just happened?  

“There’s—something—I—” I gasped, clutching the doorframe for support. But the words refused to come out in the right order. How could I explain the impossible? How could I describe *her*—what she’d become, what I’d witnessed?  

He frowned at me, his brow furrowing deeply. “What the hell’s going on? Why are you out here at this hour?” His voice was sharp, layered with confusion and irritation.  

I opened my mouth to answer but stopped myself. What explanation could I give that didn’t make me sound insane?  

“Can I… stay here?” I finally choked out, my voice shaky, almost pleading.  

He squinted at me, clearly annoyed, glancing at the clock on the wall behind him. “It’s *four in the damn morning,*” he grumbled, rubbing a hand down his face. But then he sighed, his frustration melting into something softer. “Come on. You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”  

I nodded mutely, stepping inside. Relief washed over me, but it was fleeting. The warmth of his house felt like a fragile barrier, something that wouldn’t hold if she decided to come looking for me.  

He led me to the living room, where a battered recliner sat in front of a coffee table covered in old newspapers and a half-finished puzzle. He shuffled toward the kitchen, muttering something about coffee.  

I collapsed onto the couch, my legs trembling uncontrollably. The room smelled faintly of smoke and yesterday’s dinner, the kind of comfortable, mundane chaos that usually felt grounding. But all it did now was remind me how far from normal my night had gone.  

He returned a moment later with a steaming mug, settling into the recliner across from me. His bleary eyes scanned me over, his disbelief evident. “So,” he started, taking a sip of coffee. “You gonna tell me why you’re limping like that?”  

His tone was casual, almost joking, but the question hung heavily in the air. I opened my mouth and closed it again, my jaw tightening.  

What could I tell him? The truth? That the beautiful woman staying in my house wasn’t a woman at all? That she was something *else*, something that spoke of reclamation and harvests and things I couldn’t even begin to understand? That she wasn’t just *silver* now, but that I’d seen her become something alien, something *wrong*?  

No.  

I couldn’t tell him that. Not without sounding completely insane.  

“I tripped,” I mumbled instead, staring down at the scuffed coffee table.  

He raised an eyebrow but didn’t push. I could tell he didn’t believe me, not entirely, but maybe he figured it wasn’t worth pressing at this ungodly hour. He took another sip of his coffee, leaning back in the recliner.  

For a moment, there was quiet—the hum of his fridge, the faint ticking of a clock in the corner. I wanted to believe I was safe here, that I was far enough away from her. But the image of her silver skin, gleaming in the hallway, burned behind my eyelids.  

I couldn’t shake the feeling that she wasn’t far. That she was still coming.  

And for the first time, I wondered if running had ever been an option at all.
