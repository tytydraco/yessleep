Hey everyone, this is Sam. I work at the Pineridge water plant. Nothing glamorous — I’m not an engineer or anything — I just run the daily checks, log the numbers, and make sure everything flows the way it’s supposed to. Most people don’t even think about their water until the tap runs dry, but I spend my mornings staring at it through monitors and filter jars.

Normally, it’s boring work. Pineridge has always prided itself on “mountain spring water, the purest in the state.” You can even buy bottles of it at the gas station with our little town logo printed on the label. Tourists come through, grab a case, and brag about how clean it tastes compared to city water. I’ll admit, that’s part of why I like this job. Feels good to be part of something that people trust every day without thinking.

But the past week or so, some of the readings haven’t been quite right. Nothing huge, just small anomalies in the microbial counts. The Water Purification Board says everything is “within safe limits” — those are their exact words. They’re technically correct. The numbers aren’t high enough to trigger any automatic advisories. Still, they’re higher than I’ve ever logged in my six years here.

I’m not saying it’s dangerous. If you pour a glass of water from your kitchen sink, it looks crystal clear. Smells fine too. But a few locals have mentioned a faint bitterness when they drink from the tap, like there’s a penny at the bottom of the glass. I’ve noticed it myself, if I’m honest. Not always, but enough that it’s on my mind.

And maybe this is unrelated, but pets around town have been acting strange. My neighbor’s lab has been listless for a few days. A couple of cats at the edge of town were taken to the vet with stomach issues. People are brushing it off — animals get sick, it happens — but the timing feels off.

I asked the Board if we should issue a boil advisory, just to be safe. They said no, it would cause unnecessary panic. Maybe they’re right. Still, I figured it couldn’t hurt to say something myself. So here it is: **if you’re worried, boil your water before drinking, or stick to bottled if you can.** That’ll kill anything that might be hanging around in the system.

This isn’t an official announcement. The town hasn’t declared anything, and I don’t want people thinking I’m blowing a whistle or starting rumors. I’m just a guy who looks at the same water you all drink, and I’d rather be overly cautious than silent.

If you don’t live in Pineridge but know someone who does, please pass this along. We’re a small town — word-of-mouth spreads fast — but I don’t want anyone missing it.

I’ll keep doing my job and logging the numbers. Maybe this whole thing will be gone in a week and I’ll feel silly for posting. But right now, I can’t shake the feeling that something’s a little off. And when it comes to water, “a little off” is enough reason to be careful.
