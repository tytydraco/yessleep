I always wanted privacy and dreamed of having a dog. These two wishes would comfortably exist as dreams if one year ago I wouldn't have decided to move from the city. The inflation has helped the rent skyrocket, and I had something put aside to get a mortgage. After browsing and unsuccessfully visiting listings for a few weeks I have found something suitable both for my budget and dreams. A house that needed a bit of renovation but it would become a decent home.

I rarely had meddled with diy's and renovations as I work a remote desk job. So getting a fixer upper might not have been the best choice for me. But I have made worse decisions than that... For example, my lack of neighbor research has brought me a continuous stench of animal dung mixed with 2025 global political situation. As it makes me regret breathing, it feels my heart with joy to know that my neighbors are eating pasture raised pork meat, free of antibiotics and other harmful chemicals. The wonders of living in the country side make me look at life from a different perspective.

As I have started changing the floors, I have realised they needed some self leveling concrete because under the pvc flooring, the concrete was as straight as Elton John dancing in pink shorts.

I was not in the mood to drive half an hour to the city , so I gave a shot to the local hardware store. It is located in the village center, in a building who needs a bit of a facade make up. I was really skeptical about it, because before entering the store, you are welcomed by an army of rakes, wheelbarrows, barrels, a lot of plastic brooms and tools that make you think they are one gust of wind away from desintegrating. Inside, there was a long room filled with everything you needed for interior decorations, from paints to adhesives,and as I was skeptically inspecting the merchandise, a short old lady approached me:

- Hello, how may I help you?
- Hello, I am just taking a look.

Who was I lying to? You could 've read the semientitled city boy attitude on my face. I have later found out that the lady owned the shop her entire life. This was her job, her passion, her meaning. She easily realised , that I wanted to leave and go to the real hardware store in the city .

- If you are looking for Makitas, Dewalts and Milwaukees I am sorry to disappoint you but I have got none. If I make the mistake of getting them in here, they stay on the shelves and never want to leave like they own the place.

- I am just looking for some self leveling concrete. Low traffic, residential grade.

And then she ran away like she was going to bring me a 40kg bag of mortar in her old trembling hands. But she brought something better than that. Something heavier. Something more useful. Technical documentation from her suppliers. Turns out the lady knew more about construction that I ever had, do and will know. And I was a judgemental prick. As I always am.

From there on, we bonded. Every time I had a situation without a solution I would rather buy some bags of screws and anchors just to get some advice from the lady. I made a friend in this village that for me, reeks. And this friend did not reek. Yay, small win.

All was going well with the renovation and on a Friday I decided to indulge myself in some vodka redbulls on my porch. As the night started getting older, the breeze came and gently replaced the scorching heat. It was still reeking, but I started enjoying everything. I rarely smoke, but that night I bought a pack, because I was feeling good with myself. After an undisclosed amount of time, I was my friend, not beating myself up for any mistakes, not feeling disappointed about my life progress, not feeling a round peg in a square asshole. Life was good and I finally was able to feel that.

As the morning started replacing night as my drinking companion, I started hearing murmur on the street. Not the kind of murmur you hear when people are going to their homes from the bus station. Not the one that is always present when the kids are getting back from school. The one that is almost organized yet chaotic. Like an army battalion that is trying to stay organized after a hard day of training. I quickily jump from chair, driven by curiosity and steered by alcohol straight into a porch pillar. 

I sit and sigh at my clumsiness for God knows how much time, and I hear the murmur louder and louder. It transforms into the sound of a joyful party that is lacking music. People speaking with each other, chanting and feeling good. My first thought was "with the constant unplanned spending during the renovation a concussion and some days in the hospital are some of the last things I need".

I look at my phone, Saturday 6 am. I must be hallucinating, who the fuck is partying in a quiet village at 6 am. I slowly, but firmly get back on my feet and go towards my yard fence to see where is the fun at.

And them I saw the fun gang. The party people in the house. A long line of people walking on the street, dancing to a monotonous bell sound that played continuously. Somehow, that annoying bell was like a divine music to them, their movements synchronized perfectly with every bell screech, and it seemed like it was a source of hysteria. They started jumping , rocking, pushing eachother like in a badly organized mosh pit. And then, I started looking better at them. Some of them had proper tuxedos that would make you think they came to this weird redneck moshpit straight from the opera, and others had dirty rags that looked like some prop from an underfunded small city theatre. But they had two things in common, their ecstatic movements and a gray color in their pupils that would make you think this is "Cataract get together 2025". I almost shat my pants when I saw that. 

From the party gang, one participant jumps directly on my fence , and while frantically dancing to the bell , calls me by my name and says:

- Stop working so hard.. at that hhhhouse . Come and dance with us. You know I will gladly help you. I  can even open a line of credit for you.

- Hello Mrs Georgia. Mind if I ask you what is going on here? 

- I can tell you, if you come and dance with us. The locals will get to know you bet....tter , stop living.. like a hermit. Just one dance, and it is enough. I promise. Why do you ignore an old lady like myself? Was I not kind to you?

Her speech was off. Her body moved in a way I would never think it would be able to, and her attitude was not hers. From a confident and cunning merchant that would never ask you a favor directly, she acted like a desperate level 1 MLM recruit that really wants to sell you his miracle weightlossmusclebuildingppenlarging shake. Maybe I was hallucinating from a combination of alcohol, fatigue and a mild concussion. I said to myself, fuck it and headed straight to bed,without saying any goodbyes to the dancing figments of my imagination.

I woke up in the evening, my head was sorer than  a cowboys balls after a rodeo. But my magic potion would rebuild me from the ashes of my liver soon : 1 big glass of cold sprite with 2 ibuprofens. I drank it , and while I was waiting for the potion to soothe my inner pain I was recollecting my weird hallucinations/ dreams. Bad thoughts were getting the best of me so what s better than some mindless scrolling to stop the existential dread?

As I was checking my facebook feed , I am struck by an announcement from the village fb group : 
" Our village has recently lost one of the strongest pillars that supported the building industry around here for decades. In this Friday evening, Mrs. Georgia has left us for a better world. We cannot express how much we will miss you...."
