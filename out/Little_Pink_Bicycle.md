When I was about eleven or so I and a friend of mine became obsessed with sneaking out of the house late at night. It was never on a school night mind you; I wasn’t a scoundrel, just a bored, restless tyke looking for adventure. Ricky and I would just pick a random rendezvous point in class every Friday afternoon, a convenient store, a spot in the woods, or even one another’s house. The place changed, but the time was always the same: 2:00 am Saturday morning. The time was strategically chosen. Late enough that our parents would be asleep, but early enough to get back home before they were awake. An added bonus for Ricky was that I always brought along some soda since his parents were strictly against the “consumption of sugary beverages,” as he would often complain, mockingly quoting his mother.  

There was always one place I was hesitant to visit. Ricky suggested it every time, but I wouldn’t even consider it, pleading for him to quit bringing it up. It was a waste of time. I was dead set against it. It was the old railroad bridge over Mill Creek where some teenage boy had hung himself.

“I bet it’s haunted,” he would say.

“I know. You don’t play around with that stuff. You never know what’ll stick to you, what you’ll bring home,” I would advise. I thought it was sage advice and really believed it. I didn’t believe in provoking the spirits. I didn’t play with Ouija boards or spin around in front of a mirror insulting some long dead witch just for kicks. Nope, leave them things be. But his persistence paid off. Against my better judgement, I finally agreed.

I stealthily made my way out of the house that Saturday morning. In the movies, the protagonist always moves under the cover of thunder, masking unwanted sounds that could expose their whereabouts. I on the other hand had my dad’s snoring. The man was a blustering storm of snorts, gasps, and panting. My parents never heard the squeaking of the front door, or if they did, it was probably associated with my dad wheezing for air. I went to the backyard and got my bike.

I rode down Limestone Road and then turned left onto the access road to the old rock quarry. Halfway down was a dirt path to the side meandering through the woods. It was difficult to see under the nighttime shade of the trees but with a little concentration I made my way without running off the path. When I reached the edge of the bridge, I saw Ricky’s bike lying on the ground. He was standing at the middle of the bridge. Under the moonlight I could see him waving me onward.

As I started walking across the tracks a new fear began to envelop me, a fear more attached to reality. The bridge hadn’t been used in more than fifty years; its stability more than questionable at this point. The metal was rusted, but worse than that, the cross ties were rotted and loose. It was a steep fall to the water below. Falling in the creek during the day was one thing, but during the night was quite another. Nightmare scenarios flashed through my mind. I saw myself falling in the deep, dark water, and pulled under as I tried to swim to ashore by the boy who had hung himself.

“Where’s my soda?” Ricky asked as I carefully approached.

“Crap, I forgot.”

“It’s alright. Next time you owe me two.” Ricky turned and looked down into the water. “I dare you to jump in.”

“No way man,” I responded.

“Why, because that boy’s down there?”

The same nightmarish thoughts had burrowed through his head as well.

We sat down and let our legs dangle. In time the aura of fear dissipated. The cool night air and the sound of the gently flowing creek lulled us into a sense of tranquility. Then there was a loud screech from below, a sound unlike anything I had ever heard. Ricky and I jumped to our feet and ran toward our bikes.

There was no talk. We concentrated on escape. This time my journey across the bridge was swift, the fear of falling replaced by the fear of being caught. We hopped on our bikes and pushed through the forest, up the access road, and out onto Limestone Road. We peddled up the road a bit before we finally stopped, too tired to go any further.

“What was that?” Ricky managed asked after gulping for air.

“I don’t know, but I think I want to be farther away.”

It was a hasty trek up Limestone Road to our neighborhood. We parted ways not soon after getting to our neighborhood. I was far from being late; my parents were dead to the world, sleeping without any worry that their boy was not anywhere else but safe in his bed. No, time was still on my side, but I was ready to be back home.

I took a shortcut up Goodwin Road. It was a gravel road that ran alongside the railroad tracks. There used to be five or so houses opposite the railroad tracks. There was boy named Timmy that used to live on there. Kids used to visit him just to feel his house shake as the train roared by. Now there were only two houses left, one at each end of the street. The house at the end where I entered the street was abandoned. The roof had caved in and most of the paint was peeling off. For some odd reason, the house looked to me like it had a face, a miserable, angry scowl, with an open mouth and bulbous eyes. Most of the other houses were knocked down.

The street had only one resident. That house at the other end of the street was well kept. It was quaint and lively, with pruned bushes and maple trees. It was somewhat spared the rigors of passing trains since the tracks curved away from the house. It was the only house with a noticeable front yard. The other houses were simply road and a two-foot-wide patch of grass.

 As I turned onto the road, I noticed a little bicycle next to the abandoned house, not lying on its side, but standing on its wheels, with no noticeable kickstand. I was convinced that the moonlight was playing tricks on me and that surely the bicycle was leaning up against the house. Then the bicycle started to roll. I waited for it to fall over, I expected it to fall over, but it didn’t happen. The little bicycle kept rolling towards me.

For a second time that night I was fleeing for my life. I pushed against the pedals like I was stomping a snake, hoping to accelerate my bike to warp speed and well on my way home.

I got to the end of the street and turned left onto the adjoining street, crossed the curving railroad tracks and stopped. As strange as it sounds, I was curious as to where the bicycle was going.

I turned around half-expecting to see nothing, convinced that it was an illusion, an aftermath of adrenaline I had experienced on the bridge. Yet, there it was, slowly making its way up the street. It rolled with careful precision, avoiding rocks and potholes, its spectral operator seemingly well acquainted with the road it was traversing. When it passed under the lone streetlight, I noticed that the little bicycle was pink with long tassels hanging off the handlebars. It rolled into the well-manicured yard up to the front porch and fell on its side.

I called Ricky on Sunday and told him what I had seen. He didn’t believe me but was willing to check it out not next Saturday but the Saturday after that. He had to go out of town next week and spend the night at his grandmother’s.

When the Saturday after next rolled around I almost decided not to go but Ricky’s skepticism convinced me otherwise. I wanted him to see it, but I also didn’t want to see it for myself. I felt like I was tempting the spirits. I didn’t want whatever was on that bicycle following me home.

This time I decided we should camp down by the tracks near the abandoned house. If the bicycle was still there and started to move, then we would follow it. If it wasn’t there, we could explore the abandoned house. Maybe the owner of the other house had tossed it in a landfill, and we would never see it again.

Yet, when we got there, the little pink bicycle was right next to the house, upright and ready to roll.

“Dude, its leaning against the house. Your eyes are playing tricks on you,” exclaimed Ricky.

“Just wait.”

As soon as I spoke, the little bicycle started rolling out of the yard. Ricky was ready to head the other way, away from the bicycle, but I grabbed him by his shirt and motioned that we should follow it. His eyes grew wide with disbelief.

“Are you kidding me?”

The question startled me. Was I kidding myself? Where had this courage come from? I felt at ease that this wasn’t an evil entity. That it was probably a little girl, that she was lost or looking for something. I was ready to find out.

We followed at a good distance, not riding, but walking our bikes. When it got to the middle of the street the little bicycle stopped. We stopped and waited. It didn’t move. It was as if it knew it was being followed, and it did not like it. After what seemed like an hour the little bicycle began to move again, went to the front porch, and fell over like before.

We watched this play out for two more weeks. The same path, from the same beginning to the same end. We were perplexed. We wondered what happened when the owner of the house came out and seen a little pink bicycle in his yard day after day or did he. Maybe the little bicycle made its way back to the abandoned house sometime after it fell over. We had to find out, so we decided to skip the nightly escapade, and come a little bit later one Saturday morning and see where the bicycle was then. We figured around six in the morning would be perfect.

The next Saturday came and lying near the front porch was the little pink bicycle. It hadn’t moved from that spot since the previous night.

“Then how does it get back to its house,” asked Ricky.

An elderly man dressed in overalls barreled out the front door of the house. He snatched up the bike and threw it in the back of a truck. We could hear him cussing from across the street. He turned his head and saw us camped out near the railroad tracks. He surmised that we were the responsible party seeing that we were staked out observing his hilarious reactions.

“You little shits think this is funny, do you?” he yelled. “You want let me have any peace.” He sauntered across the street and grabbed me by the collar. “What’s your problem?”

“I don’t have any problem sir.”

“Why do you keep putting that little girl’s bike in my yard, night after night?”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about mister.” I lied of course but I didn’t know how to explain it.

“I didn’t kill her. It was an accident. My boy paid for it. He paid for it on that bridge. Dammit, he paid for it. He paid for it. Leave me alone.” The man started bawling and fell to his knees. He reeked of alcohol and body odor. The disheveled man was steeped in misery, never looking up to notice that we had moved on.

On our way back to my house we discussed what we had heard.

“That was his boy that hung himself on the bridge,” explained Ricky. “His boy must’ve somehow killed some kid… a little girl.”

*I didn’t kill her.* That statement kept running through my head.

“But why did he say, he didn’t kill her?” I asked.

“I don’t know,” answered Ricky.

“I think I do. That old man needs to see how that bicycle gets to his front porch every night.”

We formulated a plan. Yet another Saturday near the railroad tracks. The variety of our adventures had narrowed but I wouldn’t call it mundane.  

It was the Saturday of all Saturdays. The last Saturday of our nightly adventures. The Saturday I will never forget.

There was a threat of storms. The spirit was parading through its ritualistic pilgrimage, doling out punishment for the unlucky penitent, rolling along on tiny torturous wheels. The old man bared no cross, he carried a little pink bicycle. As soon as it crossed under the streetlamp, we ran up the front porch stairs and started ringing the doorbell and banging on the door, yelling and screaming nonsense, anything that would provoke the dead to awaken. We caused such a commotion that we were sure the old man would come out and shoot us or call the police, but we had to take a chance.

The porch light came on. The door slammed open. The old man stormed out in nothing but a pair of underwear and a white tank top.

“What in the hell is going on?” The old man shoved Rickey into the front porch swing. Thunder exploded; a train horn blared in the distance.

“Look mister!” I pointed towards the bike.

“What are you yappin about? I’m calling the police but not before I tan your hides.”

“Look down there you stupid old bastard!”

The old man cut his eyes at me, surprised at my boldness. He gingerly made his way down the stairs and stood out in the yard. Rain poured down, slanting with the brutal wind. The little pink bicycle wavered but never fell. It moved forward, directly toward the old man, deviating a bit from its usual path. He backed up, his arms and legs shaking with fright. The ground began to shake. The old man cried aloud, blustering about something. He was difficult to hear with the storm and the approaching train.

“Forgive me! Forgive me!” I heard through the brief respite in the storm.

Thunder and horn blared again. The rain picked up. The ground shook. The old man turned and ran towards the track. He paused, looked back, and then dove in front of the train. His body was thrown a good distance in front of the train, a glare of shadow momentarily blocking the engine’s headlight was the only indication that the man had not yet been run over. The train brakes squealed but the train kept on moving. By now the old man was mincemeat. It rolled and rolled forever, murdering and erasing the old man from existence. Finally, mercilessly, with a deadening finality, the train stopped, the tracks shook, and the rain stopped.

We didn’t stick around for the police. We had nothing to explain. The old man committed suicide. No one saw us. We didn’t cause it, or at least that’s what I told myself. I wanted confession, not suicide. My expectation was far less macabre. It was a lesson learned, a lesson I had already anticipated, something I had already known: Never tempt the spirits.

Some months later, on a Saturday, of course a Saturday, I woke up to find lying in my front yard a little pink bicycle. I didn’t see it as threatening. No, I think it was a thank you. Thank you for justice. I hope at least. I hope it’s not my cross to bear for what I did. If it is, then oh well. Some thirty years on, I’ve kept it. My wife thinks it strange, my obsession with this little pink bicycle, but I keep it because I don’t want her to be lonely. I hope she’s moved on. I hope those little wheels don’t ever start turning again.
