Chapter 1 What a Secret Wife should do

　　Mayer Goodwin cheated on her.

　　Gazing at the love bite on her husband's neck, Sherry Brown found her mind a complete blank.

　　She sniffed her nose, as if the fragrance belonged to another woman was smearing in the air.

　　She had long heard of the rumor about Mayer's mistress, but this was the first time she saw the evidence.

　　As the legal wife and direct victim of the man's infidelity, Sherry should have been furious and reprimanded Mayer.

　　But she remained her constant humbleness, just like nothing had happened.

　　All of this should thank to her three-year marriage, from which had she learned when to stay silent and how should she position herself.

　　A stable bed partner in the name of Mrs. Goodwin—That's how Mayer think of her.

　　"Jingle\~"

　　A prompt saved Sherry from the suffocating silence. She hurriedly picked up her mobile and checked the SMS.

　　Then her eyes dilated with shock and fear—

　　What came with this SMS was a picture of Mayer. He was lying on the bed in a hotel, with a woman intimately holding him.

　　Was this the provocation from that mistress?

　　Sherry could not help clenching her mobile, trying to suppress the chaotic clamor inside her.

　　Almost at the same time, Mayer's mobile beeped twice.

　　Driven by a strong sense of risk, Sherry cast a quick glimpse of his lighted screen and she soon regretted when seeing the content of that SMS.

　　"Miss you, honey. GOODNIGHT!"

　　Was the woman who texted him that same person who sent her the picture?

　　Reviewing the affectionate tone, Sherry could not help biting her lips.

　　She also affectionately addressed him when her love with him was at its peak, but the response she got was a cold gaze that almost froze her soul.

　　"I don't like to be called like this".

　　Mayer said at that time and Sherry serious listed the address as his taboo. 

　　Now, she finally realized the truth.

　　Mayer actually like to be called like that, but not by her.

　　How Ironic…

　　An indescribable feeling swept all over Sherry.

　　She did not know that Mayer did not love her yesterday. 

　　On the contrary, she had always been aware that the only reason Mayer would marry her was because of a convention reached by both their families.

　　They have never been in love, just as Mayer has never made their marriage public.

　　She knew this and accepted this.

　　Because she loved him.

　　Because of this love, she volunteered to be his secret wife and did everything a secret wife should do, like taking care of his life—daily and sexually.

　　It was far from easy for Sherry to run this marriage, but she enjoyed it…

　　The door of the bathroom was pushed open, by Mayer with a bathrobe on him.

　　His flawless muscles glazed with bronze glimmer, making him look like a celestial who just stepped out of the ancient Greek mythology.

　　Without looking at Sherry, this man directly went to his table and fetched a document bag to Sherry.

　　"Sign this", said him without little emotion.

　　"What's this?"

　　Sherry opened the bag with confusion.

　　Then her face turned sickly pale.

　　"A divorce agreement?"

　　Trembling with shock, Sherry turned to the man who was smoking on the bedside: "You want a divorce?"

　　"You can read, can't you?"

　　Mayer blew a ring of while smoke and then hid his face behind the cloudy white.

　　"Why?"

　　Sherry stubbornly gazed at him, and her heart tingled again when that love bite came into her sight.

　　"She's back."

　　Mayer mercilessly smashed Sherry's last hope.

　　Compared with the woman who's back, her three years of marriage was literally nothing…

　　"Move out tomorrow."

　　Mayer stubbed out his cigarette and lay on the bed: "Tom will take you to your new house."
