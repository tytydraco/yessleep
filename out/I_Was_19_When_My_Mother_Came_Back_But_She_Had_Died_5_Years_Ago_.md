I was 19 when my mother came back, but she had died 5 years ago. It all started when I moved into that house in Bangalore, hoping to start fresh. But from the first night, something about the house unsettled me. The quiet was suffocating, and there was an eerie presence, like something was waiting. I tried to ignore it, but as days passed, I began to notice more strange things.

On the fifth day, I saw it again—the words Nale Ba scrawled on the back of the front door. It had been there when I moved in, written in faded white paint, and for some reason, it made my skin crawl. I didn’t understand what it meant, but I hated seeing it. It made the house feel even more haunted. I decided I’d had enough of it and painted over it, hoping to rid the house of whatever it was.

My father was a workaholic. He’d come home late every night, exhausted from hours at the office. I didn’t mind, but on that night, something was different. The house felt colder than usual, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. I finished painting the door and then went to my room, trying to ignore the growing unease in my chest.

Later that night, it happened. A soft knock echoed through the house. I froze, heart pounding. Then, a voice. A voice calling my name. It sounded like my mother.

I stood frozen in place, unable to move. “Come to the door, child,” the voice whispered, gentle, like my mother used to speak. But it wasn’t her. I knew it wasn’t. She had died five years ago.

The knocking came again, louder this time, accompanied by the voice. “Come, open the door. It’s me, your mother.” I could hear the desperation in the voice, the pleading tone that I remembered from when she was alive.

My hands trembled as I walked toward the door. My mind screamed at me to stay away, to not open it, but I couldn’t stop myself. I reached for the doorknob, and just as my fingers brushed against it, the room around me grew cold. A sharp pain shot through my head, and before I knew it, blood began pouring from my nose. The cold sensation spread down my spine, and the room seemed to close in on me.

I didn’t open the door. But something inside me made me grab a sharp object from my desk. My hand moved of its own accord, as if something was controlling it. Without thinking, I started carving the words Nale Ba into the wood of the door. I didn’t know why. It felt like I had to, like something was compelling me to do it.

The moment I finished, the darkness in the room overwhelmed me. My vision blurred, and everything went black.

When I opened my eyes again, I was in my bed. It was morning. The sun filtered through the curtains, casting soft light into the room. My father was lying beside me, peacefully asleep. The room was quiet, just as it should be. There was no knocking, no voice calling my name. It was as if nothing had happened.

But I knew something had. I could still feel the coldness of that night in my bones. The blood from my nose had stopped, but I was shaken, terrified, and confused. I didn’t tell my father anything. How could I? I was too scared, too unsettled. I wasn’t sure if what I experienced was real or if I had lost my mind. But I knew one thing for sure—I couldn’t stay in that house any longer.

A few months later, we moved. We found a new place, away from the eerie house that had haunted me with the knocks, the voice, and the words I had carved into the door. Whatever it was, it was tied to that place. And I had no intention of ever going back to figure out what it wanted. Some things, I realized, are better left unexplained.
