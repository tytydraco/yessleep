The day I had my heart attack is one of which I'll never forget. The pain, the sirens, and most interestingly, the place I went.

It looked like a creek, that stretched infinitely. The deep blue stream twisted through trees and swamps, it's trees were barely visible with the dim sky above. 

A man, rowing a canoe approached me, his face sullen and his cheeks pale and sunken in.

"Coins." the man demanded, sticking his boney had out; his fingers cracking.

"Ah, uhm.. yes!" I nervously nod, digging in my pockets for the coins I kept. I pulled out three quarters and a dime.

"Is this enough, sir?" I ask, sticking my hand out.

"Yes." he declares after a moment of inspecting my coins. "Come in my canoe."

I nod, throwing a leg over and pulling myself into the boat, it's wooden sides creaking a I took my seat. 

"Ready?" he asks, turning his head around. "Cause' I'm not stopping after we go, got it?"

I gently nod, "I'm ready, sir."

He smiles, his pale complexion practically glowing. "Wallace Gavins, I've been expecting you." He grunts, sticking out his hand for me to shake. 

"Who are you?" I quiz, my heart thumping in my throat. 

"I am Death, Mr. Wallace." he replies, his tone cold." I'm taking you to the afterlife."

"It's nice meeting you, Mr. Death."

I reply, shaking his hand firmly.

"Good, let's continue." he replies, redacting his hand and picking up a large oak oar.

"How did I die, Sir? And how was my life?" I curiously ask.

"You have lived a life of balance, and I expect nothing less from a man as well-raised as you." He admitted, his place blue eyes landing on me. 

 "Your mother and father, Mr. and Mrs. Gavins were kindly people, they'd be pleased to see how far you came."

"Thank you, Mr. Death. It's much more relieving knowing I'm going somewhere good." I sigh, looking at the flickering lantern on the side of the man's canoe. 

Mr. Death stared at me, then at a bird flying to the canoe. 

"One moment, Mr. Wallace." he sighs, promptly sticking out a finger for the bird to land on. 

I closely look at the bird, realizing it was a Raven carrying a small sheet of yellowing paper. 

The Raven squawked, looking as if it were staring me down before returning its gaze back to Mr. Death. 

The pale man nodded to the Raven, pulling the paper from the Raven's foot. 

Mr. Death stared intently at the paper, clearing his throat promptly. 

"Mr. Wallace, you are heading back." The pale man stated, dropping the oar. 

"There has been a mix up, you must go." he frowns, glancing over the edge of the boat before throwing himself against it. 

The canoe almost instantly flips over, trapping the two of us under it. 

"What the fuck man?" I choke, thrashing in the cold waters. 

"I'm freezing my dick off in this water!" I gurgle, the boat sinking on top of Mr. Death and I. 

"You won't feel it for long." He grunts, glaring at me. 

Soon enough, the boat comes toppling onto us, trapping me in the shallow waters.

"We got a pulse!" a voice booms above. 

"Goodbye, Mr. Wallace." Death states. 

"He's up!" A soft voice sighs. 

"Mr. Wallace, I'm Dr. Heath, a cardiologist here at Mansonville Hospital."

 A man announces, striding into a room and beside what I'm assuming is my hospital bed. 

"You suffered a major heart attack, lucky you, your wife heard you." He smiled, his pale complexion glowing just as Mr. Death's had. 

A dark, plump woman sat up, placing her hand on my cheek. 

"My love, I'm happy you're awake." she sheepishly mumbles, kissing my forehead softly.

"Dr. Heath, you look just like Mr. Death." I mutter, half intending for him to hear me. 

"Hah, I get that a lot from people just like you." He chuckles, fixing his floppy blonde hair with a swipe of a hand. 

I cock a brow, "So I'm not the only one seeing Mr. Death?" I ask. 

Dr. Heath shakes his head no. "Many people see beings after death; you're not alone." He admits. 

"Hmph. That's cool." I grunt, still dazed from waking up. 

"Well, you know how to get me, push that big ol' red button. I have another patient I need to get to." He announces, scurrying out. 

I can't help but stare at him, I can't shake the feeling of Mr. Death's canoe under me.
