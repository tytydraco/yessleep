Hi there. I am a SFC (Sergeant First Class) in the army, and I just changed duty stations about a month ago. I’ve been in long enough to know the drill, and I knew it was only a matter of time before my name popped up on the duty roster for Staff Duty. I just didn't think it was going to be so different from other places, but man, was I wrong...

On December 21, 2025, at 0900, I sat down at a desk that smelled like industrial floor wax and old coffee. My 24-hour shift had just started. In front of me sat the standard DA Form 1594 (Daily Staff Journal). Beside it was my "Runner," a PFC (Private First Class) named Miller who was already three Monsters deep and scrolling through TikTok, the repetitive audio of some trending song grating on my nerves.

The NCO I was relieving, SSG (Staff Sergeant) Halloway, looked like he’d aged ten years since yesterday. His face was very pale, his eyes were bloodshot, and his hand shook slightly as he handed me the building keys.

"Listen," Halloway whispered, leaning over the desk so Miller wouldn't hear. "The Commander's SOP is in the blue binder. Read it. Follow it. But there’s a manila folder tucked behind the printer. That’s the *actual* SOP. You don't sign for it. You don't talk about it over the radio. But if you want to be here for guard mount tomorrow morning, follow the notes in red ink."

I laughed. I’ve been an SFC for a while, and I thought it was just a "hazing the new guy" thing—even for a senior NCO. But once he cleared the building, I pulled out that folder. It was a collection of loose-leaf papers, some dated back to the 1990s, some as recent as last month. The top page was dated November 2025. It simply said:

>**Rule #1: The 0100 Motorpool Check.**  
When you scan the QR code at Gate 4, the light will turn green. If the light turns blue, do not enter the lot. There is no blue LED in the scanners. If you see a blue light, it means the 'Mechanic' is under one of the LMTVs. If you hear a wrench hit the concrete, run back to the vehicle you used to drive there and don't look in the rear view mirror.

I arrived back at 2345, and the building was silent. I thought Miller was asleep in the side office, but the desk feels too empty. I just came back from the motorpool check, which I decided to knock out a bit earlier than 0100 because I wanted to get some rest later. That was my first mistake.

When I reached Gate 4, the scanner light didn't turn green. It didn't turn blue. It turned a pulsating, organic purple—a color I didn't know a light bulb could produce, nor did I recall the rules saying anything about that. The air suddenly felt thick, like the atmosphere right before a lightning strike. I didn't wait to hear a wrench. I got back into the duty van and drove, my heart hammering against my ribs in a way it hasn't since my first deployment.

I’m looking at the CCTV monitor right now. There’s someone—or something—standing in the middle of the parade field. It’s wearing the OCP uniform, but it’s standing perfectly still, like a statue. It's been there for twenty minutes. The weirdest part? The thermal camera shows the parade field is 32 degrees... but that figure is glowing white-hot, like a furnace. The heat bloom is so bright it’s blurring the digital sensor, washing out the grass around it into a stark, blinding white.

My watch just beeped. It's midnight; time for the first BN building check.

I opened the folder again to see if I missed anything about the purple light. I didn't, but I saw the note for midnight. According to the red-ink instructions, I’m supposed to skip Floor 3 entirely. The note says: **"Whatever you hear on the third floor, it’s a recording. Do not open the door."**

But as I stood up, I heard a scream. It was muffled, coming through the air vents, vibrating the metal slats. It didn't sound like a recording. It sounded like Miller.

I looked over at the side office, hoping to see him sitting there, but his chair is empty. The pile of Monster cans is still there, and his phone is still on the desk, plugged into its charger. The screen is glowing in the dark, playing a TikTok on a loop. The same six-second audio clip is repeating over and over, but the pitch is dropping, sounding more like a distorted, guttural chant every time it restarts.

I’m an SFC. I’m supposed to look after my soldiers. That’s the oath I took. But I’m looking at that manila folder, and then at the dark stairwell leading to the third floor, wondering if "Miller" is really the one calling for me.

I have nine hours left on shift. Gods help me.

UPDATE: Off-shift. NSTR.

I’m finally off the desk. My replacement is signed in, and I’ve sanitized the official DA Form 1594. On paper, it was just another 24-hour shift with a "medical incident".

Miller is at the clinic. The medics are calling it shock, but they didn’t see what I saw. He’s physically present, but the way he looks at me... it’s like looking at a photo of a person rather than the person themselves. And his name tape? ***It’s in cursive***, and none of the medical staff seemed to have noticed the regulation violation.

I’m headed to my off-post apartment now. I’ve got his waiver paperwork in my passenger seat—I'm trying to protect his career, but I'm starting to wonder if the PFC Miller I'm protecting is still in there.

I’m going to try to sleep. But I can still hear the floor buffer, and I'm not in the building anymore.
