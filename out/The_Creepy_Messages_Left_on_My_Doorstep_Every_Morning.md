Moving to the small town of Raven's Hollow was supposed to be a fresh start, a chance to rebuild my life after a bitter breakup. Nestled between dense woods and rolling hills, it exuded an eerie charm that I found oddly comforting. Little did I know that the quaint town harbored a darkness that would seep into my daily life in the most disturbing way.  
  
The first envelope appeared on my doorstep a week after I settled into the creaky Victorian house I rented. The pale morning light barely illuminated the elegant handwriting scrawled on the envelope: my name. A sense of foreboding washed over me as I tore it open, revealing a single sheet of paper with a chilling message: "I see you, even when you don't see me."  
  
I dismissed it as a prank, attributing it to the overactive imagination of a heartbroken person seeking solace in a new environment. I crumpled the note and tossed it into the trash, convincing myself that it was a one-time occurrence. But the following morning brought a new envelope, its contents more ominous: "The shadows know your secrets."  
  
Concern turned to fear, and I began questioning my neighbors. They feigned ignorance, their faces etched with confusion. Even the local police, whom I approached with my growing unease, couldn't offer much help. "Keep an eye out, and let us know if it escalates," they said.  
  
The messages, however, escalated. Each day brought a new note, each more disturbing than the last. "You can't escape your past." "The darkness is coming for you." Sleep became a rare commodity as paranoia set in, my mind conjuring phantom figures in every shadow.  
  
Desperation led me to install security cameras, hoping to catch the elusive messenger in the act. Reviewing the footage revealed nothing but an empty doorstep. No figures lurking, no shadows moving. It deepened the mystery, leaving me on edge and questioning my sanity.  
  
A particularly chilling note arrived one morning: "I know what you did." Panic coursed through me as my mind raced through every regret, every mistake. How could someone know my darkest secrets? Was it a vengeful ex-lover, or was it something more supernatural?  
  
The breaking point arrived when a photo appeared on my doorstep. It was a picture of me, taken through my bedroom window while I slept. The note simply said, "Sleep well." Terrified, I packed my bags and fled Raven's Hollow, leaving behind the nightmare that had become my life.  
  
In a new city, the messages ceased, and the fear slowly faded. Yet, the scars remained, a constant reminder that some horrors can't be escaped. Even now, in my supposedly safe haven, I can't shake the feeling that someone is still watching, waiting for the perfect moment to remind me that the past is never truly buried.
