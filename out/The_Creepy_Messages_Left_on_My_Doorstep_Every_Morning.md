The quaint town of Ravenswood became my refuge after a messy breakup left me shattered. The Victorian house I rented seemed like a haven, but soon it became the epicenter of a chilling ordeal that would haunt my nights.  
  
It started innocently enough. The first morning, I found a pristine white envelope with my name elegantly scripted on the front. Inside, the cryptic message sent shivers down my spine: "I see you, even when you don't see me." Dismissing it as a prank, I crumpled the note and tossed it into the trash. Little did I know, this was just the beginning.  
  
Every morning, a new envelope appeared on my doorstep. The messages grew increasingly unsettling. "The shadows know your secrets." "You can't escape your past." Each note was more chilling than the last. I questioned my neighbors, but they seemed oblivious to any strange occurrences. Even the police, whom I had reported the incidents to, found nothing unusual in their patrols.  
  
Desperation led me to install security cameras around my property, hoping to catch the mysterious messenger in the act. But the footage revealed nothing out of the ordinary. No shadows, no lurking figures. It only deepened the mystery, and I found myself questioning my sanity.  
  
Sleep became elusive as paranoia consumed me. I checked windows and doors obsessively, convinced that someone was watching my every move. The town that had initially felt like a sanctuary became a sinister landscape, and I was its prey.  
  
One day, the message took a terrifying turn. "I know what you did." Panic set in as my mind raced through every regret, every mistake. How could someone know my darkest secrets? Was this a vengeful ex-lover, or was it something more supernatural?  
  
The breaking point came when I woke to find a photograph on my doorstep. It was a picture of me, taken through my bedroom window while I slept. The note simply said, "Sleep well." Terrified, I packed my bags and fled Ravenswood, leaving behind the nightmare that had become my life.  
  
As I settled into a new city, the messages ceased, and the fear slowly faded. But the scars remained, a constant reminder that some horrors can't be escaped. Even now, in my supposedly safe haven, I can't shake the feeling that someone is still watching, waiting for the perfect moment to remind me that the past is never truly buried.  
  
Months passed, and I began to rebuild my life. I found a job, made new friends, and tried to put Ravenswood behind me. But just as I started to believe I was free, a letter arrived in the mail. The handwriting was unmistakable, and the message sent a chill down my spine.  
  
"I told you, you can't escape your past. I'm always watching."  
  
The nightmare had followed me, and Ravenswood's grip on my life was far from over. The town's secrets were woven into the very fabric of my being, and no matter how far I ran, it seemed I could never outrun the shadows that clung to my every step.
