People think monsters hide under your bed or in your closet. Mine lives in my phone.

It started slowly—little things. A selfie that didn’t get enough likes. A girl at school posting a photo with perfect skin and a thigh gap you could park a bike in. Comments like “you're glowing, Queen” and “wow! Drop-dead gorgeous.” I’d stare at myself in the mirror, turning side to side, and wonder how everyone else looked so flawless.

They say it’s just filters. Just lighting. Just angles.

But what if it’s not?

One night, I downloaded a new editing app someone on TikTok recommended. “Fix your flaws instantly,” it promised. “Be the girl you were meant to be.” The icon was a pink eye. It looked kinda creepy, but whatever.

I uploaded a picture of myself—no makeup, messy bun, just me. The app scanned my face, then asked, *“Want to unlock your true beauty?”*

Of course, I tapped yes.

I watched the screen as I started to shift. Skin smoothed, lips fuller, waist cinched. My eyes got bigger, brighter. Like a doll. Not me.

But better.

It wasn’t just an edit. When I looked away from the phone and caught my reflection,, my real face—it had changed.

I blinked and stumbled back, knocking over a lamp. I screamed for Mom, but when she rushed in, she just stared at me.

“You look….. nice,” she said, but the look in her eyes didn’t match her voice.

That night, I got more likes than I’d ever seen. Hundreds. Then thousands. People messaged me, asking what filter I used. If I’d had surgery. If I could give tips.

I kept using the app. Every day. My real face—my real body—kept changing. More perfect. More polished. More hollow.

It didn’t hurt. But I could feel something fading. Like every time the app “enhanced” me, a piece of who I was got carved away.

Then came the side effects.

First, I stopped needing food. I just… wasn’t hungry. Then sleep. I’d lie there, eyes wide, staring at the ceiling until morning. My reflection stopped blinking.

The app updated itself one night. New feature: *“Perfection Mode – Make It Permanent.”*

The button pulsed.

I hesitated for the first time.

My fingers hovered, but a thought whispered through me: *You’ll never be loved if you go back.*

So I tapped it.

My screen went black.

Then it turned into a mirror.

I saw myself—but not me. A perfect version. Plastic. Airbrushed. The pink eye icon blinked in the corner of the screen. My reflection smiled, but I didn’t feel my mouth move.

I tried to turn off the phone.

Nothing happened.

I tried to put it down—but I couldn’t. My fingers wouldn’t let go.

Now I’m stuck here. Online. In photos. In stories. People still like me. They share images of my face and body. They comment how “lucky” I am to look this way.

But they don’t know I’m not real anymore.

They don’t know I’m screaming behind the smile.

And every time someone downloads the app, I feel it watching them.

Waiting.

One more tap, and they’ll be next.
