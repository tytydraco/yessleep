I saw it again last night. I’ve begun to develop some sort of a sixth sense to its presence which rips me from my sleep, begging me to get up and check the door. Its not something I ever want to see, but I feel almost compelled each time to pull myself out of bed and stumble to the cheap wooden frame and peer through the tiny glass eyepiece into the dark corridor outside. Every time its the same. The weak green lighting from the exit lights dimly illuminate the small corridor, leaving the stairway up and down encased completely in darkness, and there stands the thing right outside my flat. It never moves, never speaks or makes any other sound. It just stands there outside my door and waits. Waits for me to turn the latch and let it in.

It first arrived the night my partner left. Some serious family stuff came up I won’t go into and she needed to go home for a while to be with them. I went through something similar a while back and know all about what its like. It can be difficult to remember when living in the disconnected sprawl of a major city, but family is so important and you only get one. With the door closing behind her though, I couldn’t help but already feel alone. It sounds silly living in a block of flats with tens of other people, but there’s strangely something so alienating and impersonal being surrounded by nameless faces and unfamiliar characters. Anyone who lives in a capital has felt the same way at some point, I’m sure of it. Maybe that's why it visits me, it somehow senses a need to belong and yet a fear to connect.

A broken sleep awaited me that night, filled with forgotten nightmares. I fully awoke at 2.30am, the light from my phone burning my eyes as I rolled over to check the time. Immediately I felt something was off, almost like I felt someone close to me. Humans have a strange ability to sense when someone is also present in a room or if someone is watching them, and I felt that stronger than I ever have before. Terrified, I threw on my bedside light and scanned my bedroom for signs of anyone there. It was the same as when I left it before going to sleep, though the feeling never dissipated. I briefly thought about calling out to anyone who might be there, but fear held my tongue. Instead, I crept out of bed and slowly inched into the hallway, heart thumping loudly in my ears. Nothing was there, but the sense of a presence became even stronger. I checked the kitchen and the bathroom, forcing myself to open the doors fearful of what might be on the other side, but there was nothing in either. I considered retreating back to the bedroom before I realised there was one door I didn’t open. One door I had not yet checked behind. I turned to look at the thin fire door which was the only thing separating our flat from the outside world and felt an inescapable dread. I knew that whatever was there was surely behind it. 

I’m not sure what compulsion forced me to creep to the entrance. It felt like an eternity before I stopped in front of it and slowly raised my eye to the peephole. It took a moment for me to make out what was outside. The green emergency lights really don’t cast much light at all, and the circular glass of the peephole distorts the view in that strange fisheye lens way. But there it was. Standing slightly bent, right outside my flat. I felt a horror I have never experienced before. Every synapse in my brain was on fire, screaming for me to escape, to tear away from the peephole and flee to the safety of the bedroom, but instead I stayed. I can’t say for how long I stood like that, one eye pressed to the door, staring into the dimly lit corridor but it must have been at least an hour. I barely remember even getting back into bed again, everything after that initial peek through the hole becomes hazy, as though the memory is draped in a fog. I didn’t tell anyone about it. I don’t know how to tell anyone about it without sounding insane. This post is the first step.

I didn’t go to work the next day. In fact, I haven’t been for a while. Some conjured excuse was enough to not raise any more questions than necessary and I’ve been at home since. I hear the nameless neighbours come and go during the day and during the night I’m visited by the thing outside. Every night I wake to the same feeling of a presence and each time a sense of creeping dread drags me to the front door. The past few times a new urge has seeped into my head like an intrusive thought. I should open the door, let it in. I have so far managed to salvage whatever free will remains in me during those moments to refuse to act on these impulses, but I don’t know how much longer that will last. There’s an odd, conscious part of me that does yearn to turn the latch and invite it in. Despite every rational segment of my brain, there is a small fraction that thinks that maybe it is actually him. Somehow, the figure standing in the dark outside my door really is the man I buried. He stands there exactly how I remember him in those last few weeks, frail and leaning heavily on his metal walking stick. The baggy tracksuit clothes, the hospice gown and the grey woollen hat sitting above that gaunt face are all completely the same. Maybe it really is him. Maybe its not. Maybe its something that has taken his form and is using it as a lure, like an anglerfish tricking its prey.

Its half ten at night now, and soon I’ll be heading to bed. Its surely coming to visit me again in a few hours, what should I do?
