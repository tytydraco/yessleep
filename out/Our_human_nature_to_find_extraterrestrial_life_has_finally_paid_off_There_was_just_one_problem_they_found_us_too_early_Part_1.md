"My name is Lt. Col James Brigg. If you're watching this... The world is at its end."

That was the beginning of the video I had stumbled across. I was a mere Intelligence agent in the Army, but this was being broadcasted across our entire office space. Everyone had turned their attention to the video as it continued.

"Over the past 12 years, me and my team has been timelessly working on stopping whats about to happen. The world as we know it is coming to it's end. Multitudes of extra terrestrial creatures are nearing to our planet Earth. They arent here for peace. They are here to enslave and destroy us."

Everyone was shocked. I briefly looked around, could this be true? We were all intelligence agents but no one had expected our time in the Military to come to an end this quick. Even our Commanding Officer was shocked, his face was pale, like the rest of us. 

"15 years ago, when I was an Intelligence Officer in the USSF, we recieved a message from people outside Earth. Aliens. They gave us the choice to be under their control or be destroyed, I dont know why to this day but we chose the latter. Over the years we began manning ourselves and preparing for an Extinction. We didnt know when it was happening, but we knew it would be in a few decades. We arranged meetings with all major governments and in UN Meetups, we proposed idea after idea, but to no prevail. We had only one option, to defend ourselves until we had nothing left." 

At this point everyone in the room was shocked, unable to understand what these creatures wanted and why we were here to suffer the consequences of these choices by our members. As we progressed into the video, some members stood up to leave the room and some started tearing up, knowing we were going up against a force that would destroy us. 

"If you're watching, it means that you're going to take part in the help and search for these creatures and defending our planet from these people. We have no choice. This video is coming to it's end, and if you are watching, welcome to the brigade. Our last stand..."

All of us were confused. What did we get ourselves into? How did we not know? Was our Commanding Officer aware of this? All of it was answered when a man in a black suit entered in alongside 2 MPs. 

"Looks like you've finished the video. Welcome to The Brigade. I will now continue what the Lt. Col left of at"

Why did they call it 'The Brigade'? What was this? Why us? A mere intelligence Company in the Army. All of us focused our attention to the man in the suit. 

"I'm Capt. Emit Henderson. Im sure there are some questions you all have, but for now, follow me and the two MPs to the facility." 

All of us stood up, heading over to our new office? We didnt know what we were getting into, but we just followed the men with guns.
