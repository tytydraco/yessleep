So, I don’t know if this is a confession or asking for advice or what it is. I suppose, if anything, it’s just…telling events to someone because I have no one to tell. 



I’m 28 and live alone. I’m divorced with a kid, and I see that kid on weekends. I live in a small studio flat on the middle floor, with neighbours upstairs and downstairs. It’s a small place, but it does me just fine. I don’t go out often and mostly stay in my room.



A while back, about five months ago, there was a smell. At first, I thought it was lousy cooking, that the downstairs neighbour was making something abysmal, so I scrunched my nose up and went to my flat, and I was extremely glad the smell wasn’t present there. 



Every time I went to leave, the smell was still there. It couldn’t be the neighbour's cooking unless he had no nose and bizarre tastes. But I was in that hallway for a maximum of 10 seconds a week, so it isn’t like it actually bothered me much, apart from maybe acne on my nose prickling at the scrunkle. 



Life was everyday, boring, and the smell was still there. 



I didn’t become used to it, per se, because I didn’t smell it much in the grand scheme of things, but I accepted it. The place I rent from had told me before if there’s anything wrong with the building, let them know, but…I mean, there were two other tenants here; surely one of them had already. It didn’t bother me that much. It was easy to ignore. 



About a month after the smell had started when my ex-wife was dropping off my kid, she asked, “Is something going on with the sewers or something?”



It was the first time someone else had acknowledged the smell apart from me. It wasn’t as though I thought I was IMAGINING it or something, but I suppose my thinking was, ‘If no one else cares, why should I?’. Now someone else had mentioned it, it was like I couldn’t just ignore it anymore…accept I did, obviously. But now I ignored it whilst also thinking, ‘hmm, wonder when they’ll fix it’ because that’s what life is like. A foul smell from sewer pipes was annoying, but it didn’t bother me in my flat. Life is normal. Life continues.



About a month or two after that, there was a significant amount of noise coming from upstairs, more than the usual amount from returning from work or sex. I could still sleep through it, and I often played video games in the early morning hours, so it didn’t bother me. If anything, it justified me for living the way I do. I realised they were moving out only when my neighbours said, “Bye, nice knowing you!”. The boxes on the stairs and the many noises should’ve been obvious, but I guess I just…didn’t realise. Or rather, I think I didn’t care.



When I moved in, I was so excited to have friendly neighbours. I moved in on Feb 2nd. They gave me a four-pack of beer, so on pancake day, I brought them up a stack of pancakes, and that was the last time I saw them outside of passing on the hallway. My downstairs neighbour, another dad like me, was also very friendly towards me. He always said to come have a BBQ when summer was here, and I always said, ‘That sounds nice’, and yet summer came and went, and no BBQs were had. At Christmas, however, I made a lot of jam—enough to cover all the presents I had to give at a significantly cheaper price. I don’t know if it was because I still held onto that hope I could be friends despite the fact I was the one holding myself back, but I left a jar of raspberry Jam outside his door and went off. When I returned to my flat, a jar of fancy white chocolate and pistachio spread was left outside my door. 



It meant way more to me than I could say. 

  


About two months ago, I had a knock at my flat door, something that is virtually unheard of and scared the shit out of me. I opened the door and was met with a man I’d never seen before. 



“Do you smell rotting flesh?”



It was a hell of an opening line from a man I’d never seen before.



“Sorry?”



“I’m a builder. I’m here to fix up the room upstairs,” he told me, which set my ‘freak out’ sensors to a minimum. So, I’m working upstairs, and they left it pretty bad, mould and everything, but it’s fixable. Downstairs, though, there’s this horrible smell.”



Something about him saying that made it feel like my brain was updating in real-time: sure, I didn’t smell it much, but it was still my home. I still smelt it regularly. And yeah, though I hadn’t really acknowledged it, it had definitely gotten worse. 



“Oh yeah, I agree, it’s awful.”



“Yeah, I know that smell. It’s a dead rat or something. But I had a look around, and I couldn’t find anything.”



“Perhaps it’s leaking over from the shop next door?”“Maybe. But the landlord won’t be able to rent the upstairs flat unless something is done about it; they’d walk in and walk straight back out!”He laughed, and I laughed. He said he’d talk to the landlord about it and went on his way. It definitely didn’t smell like sewers at this point. So, it was a dead rat. Grim. But at least it would be sorted soon. 



When life isn’t busy or exciting, you often live on autopilot. You ignore things that don’t matter to you, but if nothing matters, you ignore everything. The smell got worse and worse until, much to my chagrin, I could smell it slightly in my kitchen. 



My apathy turned to annoyance. For the first time in 5 months, the smell bothered me. 



I just got in, and it was hot outside. So I breathed in, and yet again, that horrible, revolting smell assaulted my nostrils. 



And I stayed put and sniffed again for the first time in 5 months. 



It was terrible—beyond anything I could describe. It was so bad that it snapped me out of autopilot, and I felt like a stranger in my own hallway. 



There were lots of letters on the floor. I’ve been ignoring them because they weren't mine. Spam, probably. The neighbours who forgot to change their address. I had no evidence; I’d just decided by myself. 



I looked at them for the first time. 



They were all for my downstairs neighbour—about twelve of them. There had been more, but the cleaners who did the hallways got rid of the giant stack of everyones unclaimed letters that were piling up, or at least I assume they did because they weren’t there anymore. 



Yet another assumption to the pile.



It was like, once again, my brain had been updated, but this time with a horrible virus from the dark web or something. When did I last see him? Was it recently? Just one single time. I tried to recall my memories but was frozen in place, and the smell consumed me.



I would usually run into him with his kid-



His kid. I’d often have to change where I left my buggy when my son was over because his buggy was in the hallway. He’d told me it was okay to leave it outside his door if I didn’t want to block the stairs, and it was easier for me. 



I’d been leaving it in front of his door when I came over many times over the last five months. 



I hadn’t even realised that I hadn’t seen his buggy recently. 



I became very, very scared. The pieces adding up in my brain merged with the smell, and I couldn’t breathe. I ran back to my flat, let myself in, and sat on my chair. 



I don’t know who to call. I don’t know what to do. 



No one else lives here. 



I opened my laptop and decided to write things out to organise my thoughts. A desperate plea for someone, anyone, to tell me what to do. 

Someone please tell me what to do.  
  
I can still smell it.
