I’ve been a cop in this town for nearly two decades, and in all that time, I’ve never seen anything like it. Sure, we’ve had our fair share of violent crimes, drug busts gone wrong, and the occasional domestic dispute that left more than just bruises. But this? This was something else entirely.

It started with the missing pets. A couple of cats here, a dog there, all vanishing from the same block in the old industrial district. At first, we thought it was some psycho getting their kicks by snatching people’s pets. Then the homeless started disappearing—folks who lived under the old railway bridge or in the factory on Baker Street. We didn’t pay much attention. People like them disappear all the time. It’s sad, but it’s true. 

But then Sarah Jacobs went missing. A sweet girl, only eight years old, with blonde hair and big blue eyes. Last seen playing outside her house, just a few streets over from where the others vanished. That’s when the station went on high alert. A missing kid changes everything.

They assigned me and my partner, Tom, to the case. We combed through the neighborhood, interviewing everyone we could find, but nobody had seen or heard anything. It was as if Sarah had been swallowed by the earth itself. As days passed with no sign of the girl, the air in the station grew thick with tension. Every officer felt it—the helplessness, the frustration. Parents in the neighborhood kept their kids locked inside. Everyone was on edge.

A week later, an anonymous tip came in, a gruff voice telling us to check out the old Dallion Warehouse. It was a relic from the past, a crumbling, red-brick building that once housed one of the biggest shipping companies in the state. Now, it was just a home for squatters and the occasional drug deal.

Tom and I headed there right away. As we pulled up, the sun was just setting. It looked like the kind of place where nightmares were born—windows shattered, graffiti scrawled across its walls, and weeds growing through the cracks in the asphalt.

“Think we’ll find anything?” Tom asked as we got out of the cruiser, his hand resting on his holstered gun.

“Only one way to find out,” I said, trying to sound confident. 

We made our way inside, flashlights cutting through the darkness. The place reeked of rot and mold, and every step we took echoed through the empty halls. We moved in silence.

As we turned a corner, the smell hit us—a stench so overpowering I had to cover my mouth. It was the kind of smell you don’t forget, a mix of decaying meat and something else. *Death*. Tom gagged next to me, turning his face away.

“That’s not good,” he muttered.

We followed the smell to a set of rusted double doors. I pushed them open, my flashlight beam cutting through the darkness beyond. What I saw will haunt me for the rest of my life.

The room was huge, probably once a storage area, but now it looked like a slaughterhouse. The floor was slick with blood, thick and congealing. In the center of the room, a mass of fur and feathers, bones and flesh lay tangled together. It took me a moment to realize what I was looking at. It was a pile of bodies—animals mostly, cats, dogs, a few birds. And among them, human remains. A hand here, a foot there. Skulls stripped of flesh stared at us with empty eye sockets.

“Oh, fuck,” Tom whispered, backing away. 

That’s when I saw her—Sarah. Or what was left of her. She was hanging from the ceiling, her small body suspended by her wrists, skin pale and lifeless. Her stomach had been torn open, entrails spilling out, pooling on the floor beneath her. Her eyes were wide, mouth open in a silent scream.

“Jesus Christ!” I shouted, stumbling back, my heart racing.

We needed to call for backup, to get the hell out of there and call for backup, but before I could say anything, I heard it. A sound like tearing fabric, wet and sloppy. I turned my flashlight toward the corner of the room and saw it.

At first, I thought it was a man, hunched over, its back to us.

I pointed the flashlight beam directly at him, shouting.

 "Police! Put your hands where I can see them!"

then it stood up, and I realized how wrong I was. The thing was tall, easily seven feet, its body thin and emaciated, skin stretched taut over sharp bones. Its arms were too long, hanging down past its knees, ending in hands tipped with claws. Its head was wrong, too. It was elongated, with no nose and large, hollow eyes that reflected the light like mirrors. And its mouth... Jesus, that mouth. It was filled with rows of jagged teeth, too many to count, all stained with blood.

The creature turned toward us, its eyes locking onto mine. I froze. I felt like a rabbit caught in the headlights, paralyzed by fear. Then it moved, faster than I thought possible, crossing the room in a single bound. I heard Tom scream as the thing’s claws slashed through his throat, blood spraying like a fountain. He went down, gurgling, his hands clutching at his neck, eyes wide with terror.

I stumbled back, fumbling for my gun. My fingers felt like lead, slow and unresponsive. The creature snarled, advancing on me, its mouth opening wider, wider, impossibly wide. I fired, the sound of the gunshot echoing through the room, but the bullet did nothing. It didn’t even flinch.

I turned and ran, bursting through the doors, my heart pounding in my chest. I could hear it behind me, its claws scraping against the concrete floor, gaining on me. I ran blindly through the dark hallways, tripping over debris, my breath coming in ragged gasps.

I don’t know how I made it out of the warehouse. One moment I was inside, the next I was out, the cool night air hitting me like a slap in the face. I stumbled to the cruiser, yanking the door open, throwing myself inside. I slammed the door shut, my hands shaking so badly I could barely get the key in the ignition.

As the engine roared to life, I glanced back at the warehouse. For a moment, I thought I saw it, standing in the doorway, those hollow eyes watching me. Then it was gone.

I drove back to the station, my mind reeling, hands gripping the wheel so tight my knuckles turned white. I kept expecting it to jump out at me from somewhere, to feel those claws tearing into my flesh.

When I got back, I burst into the station, yelling for help. Officers rushed toward me, asking questions, but all I could do was babble about Tom and the monster. They looked at me like I was crazy, and maybe I was. Maybe I am.

They sent a team to the warehouse, but they found nothing. No bodies, no blood, just an empty building filled with dust. They think I made it all up, that the stress of the job finally got to me.

But I know what I saw. I know what’s out there. And now, every time I close my eyes, I see its face, those hollow eyes staring into me. I can hear it, too, saying my name in the dark.

I don’t know how much longer I can take it. Every night I patrol those same streets, waiting, hoping that I don’t run into it again. But deep down, I know it’s only a matter of time.

It’s out there, somewhere, watching, waiting.

And when it finds me, I know there won’t be anywhere left to run.
