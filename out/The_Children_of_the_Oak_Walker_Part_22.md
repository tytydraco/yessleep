[\[Part 21\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1b28bzp/the_children_of_the_oak_walker_part_21/)

Lights flicked on, and feet pounded on the cement as knives flashed in the gloom to cut the various bits of paracord holding us all together.  
I ran behind the others, pulse roaring under the skin of my temple, and both ears crawled with the echoes of wooden legs that rang throughout the sewage system.  
*Is that from the right-side tunnel, or left? Are those more flanking us from the front? There’s too many, I can’t keep track.*  
Andrea sprinted not far ahead of me, and in the brief strobes from the surrounding flashlights, I caught how pale her already white face had grown. “The charges! Someone throw me a satchel charge, come on!”  
One of the boys in front of us tried to wrestle with his backpack, and the tip of his boot caught on a crack in the tunnel floor.  
Down he went, and the column split in two as the smugglers in the vanguard ran on, while the six of us left behind fell all over each other in the dark. I barely avoided tripping myself, and skidded to a halt beside my groaning, prostrate companions. Shadows closed in from all directions, and I no longer needed the focus to hear the onslaught of legs.  
Somone let out a high shriek of pain, and I whirled in time to see a boy dragged into the dark, his kicking shoes the last bit of him to vanish.  
“Owen, no!” A girl with frizzy brown hair lunged to go after him, but I grabbed her by the arms, and held her back inside the tiny aura of our flashlights.  
*Crunch.*  
A wet, nasty rupture cut off the boy’s cries, and the cascade of wooden legs skittered closer.  
*Bang, bang, bang.*  
Andrea yanked a handgun from her belt and fired into the abyss in a broad arc, bullets zinging as they bounced off the round cement walls. “Everyone on your feet, we have to go!”  
“Where?” A scrawny kid with freckles on his nose scrabbled backwards, and something greasy and black snapped at the place he’d just been. “They’ve got us cornered!”  
Waving my shotgun light at the darkness, I barely caught a blur on four wooden legs, bent at weird angles like a post had been split, and the rusted gleam of a green metal Mailbox. The little red flag on the side stood straight up, and a cluster of eyes reflected the beam of my flashlight for a second, before they were gone.  
*If it weren’t for the concrete, we wouldn’t even hear them coming.*  
Shouts and gunfire exploded from the tunnel ahead, and my blood ran ice cold as the noise reached a crescendo, then fell deathly quiet. The other half of our column hadn’t escaped either; to make matters worse, with none of the precious few cobbled-together radios present on our patrol, no one back at the Castle knew to come to our aid.  
Something darted at me from the abyss, and I flicked the safety of my Remington off, raising the twelve-gauge to my shoulder to squeeze the trigger.  
*Blam.*  
Fire spat from the sawed-off barrel of the aged hunting gun, and a murky shape went down in a twitchy fit of thrashing legs.  
*Got you.*  
I rested my light on it for a moment, exhilarated that I’d managed to hit one, and my eyes picked up something else across the drainage trench down the center of the tunnel.  
A door.  
It had been welded from the same rusted angle-iron as the front gate for the Castle station, but stood much smaller, about man sized and covered in dust. It looked as though no one had been in it for years, and as far as I could see, it had no other way for a creepy-crawly the size of a shopping cart to get inside.  
*Bingo.*  
“This way!” I rammed the pump of my shotgun back and forth, slinging buckshot into the shadows as the Mailboxes circled.  
Backing up against the far wall, I ran at top speed to leap across the sludge-filled trench, feet bicycling in the air. For a brief half-second, I worried that I might fall into the rank sewage in the trench, but my shoes met the other side with a hard slap to the arches of my feet.  
Wooden footfalls clacked toward me from the right, and I leveled my twelve gauge at the unseen attacker.  
*Click.*  
Fear took hold of me, the empty barrel of my shotgun wafted smoke, and I knew there was no time to reach for the shells on my belt.   
My heart stopped, the world slowed, and from the inky shadows, I watched two splintered legs rear up, and the metal lid of the Mailbox fell open.   
Black, sticky strands coated the inside, knotted together in pulsating tendons and sinews much like the Brain Shredder that had attacked me on my first night in Barron County. These grotesque bits of oily muscle stretched forth, and a set of jaws appeared, lined with three rows of needle-like teeth. The two forelegs rose in the air like enormous mandibles, ready to curl around me and draw me in for the kill. No less than four separate eyes on slimy eyestalks peered from where they sprouted out of the ventilation holes in the central box, the eyeballs colored like coal, and devoid of any sentiment whatsoever.  
*Crack.*  
Ebony goo exploded against the wall to my left, and the creature tumbled over itself to the floor.  
Andrea racked the bolt on her scoped rifle and jerked her head at the door. “Get it open, I’ll cover you.”  
With trembling fingers, I pawed at the pouch on my hip, and shoved more green plastic shells into my gun, even as a horde of legs scuttled over the cement, swarms of the creatures bearing down in a wave of silent hunger.   
I put the muzzle of my shotgun a few inches from the old lock and yanked the trigger to send bits of metal whizzing in every direction. The door gave in with a few stout kicks, and I waved my light at the others in a hoarse shout. “It’s open! Hurry, I’ll keep them back. Jump!”  
In full retreat, the others lunged across one-by-one, and I fired until my shoulder ached. Unlike some of the surface-dwelling creatures, the Mailboxes acted without any fear, throwing themselves into my bullets like mindless drones. They stacked up on their dead comrades, vaulted off the curved walls and ceiling, and galloped through the sludge in the drainage trench to snap at our ankles with their extending jaws. The twelve-gauge grew warm, steam rose from the wood and metal, but the nightmarish things didn’t stop. As soon as Andrea landed on the cracked cement, we rushed into the room and slammed the creaky iron door shut.  
From the look of it this had at one point been some kind of maintenance shop, a smaller room almost like a closet, with a few rusted sheet-metal wall lockers, an old steel workbench, and piles of grimy trash heaped in the corners. Dust coated everything in thick, fluffy, off-brown layers, and the air smelled of must so strong that it caught in my throat. The others piled in behind me, and I risked a tetanus infection to reach for one of the decrepit wall-lockers.  
“Help me wedge the door shut.” My shoes slipped and slid over the dirty floor, and I put my shoulder to the locker with all my strength.  
The rest of the smugglers joined me, and we heaped the two lockers against the bars, shoving the hefty workbench against it as well.  
*Crash.*  
Under the weight of the mutants’ assault, the door heaved, and wooden appendages reached through to feel around for us. Gelatinous black jaws gnawed at the angle-iron, scrabbling with animalistic fury at our primitive barricade. Not a sound came from the Mailboxes, not one chirp, squeak, or click, but something about their frenzied struggle made my guts squirm.  
*If these things ever got to Louisville, the city wouldn’t stand a chance.*  
A set of saliva-covered jaws slithered from one of the boxes pressed against the bars, and snapped inches from my face as we held the barricade together from the opposite side. Its breath stank of dirt and rot, like moldy earthworms mixed together and left in the sun. Driven mad by how close I was, the Mailbox leaned hard against the door, and the steel ground backward a few inches.  
Arching my neck away from the thing, I slid a free hand over my belt, drew the .45 from its holster, and brought the barrel up to the Mailbox’s teeth.  
*Bam.*  
Viscera coated the ceiling above our heads, and the Mailbox yanked itself backwards in a spasmodic jolt, releasing enough pressure to allow us to shore up our meager defenses. With the steel workbench propped at an angle, the door stayed shut, and we were able to step back with ringing ears and panting breaths.  
“What do we do now?” The frizzy-haired girl darted around the room in a panic, sweeping at the walls with her hands to knock off clouds of dust. “There’s . . . there’s no way out of here. There’s no way out, we’re trapped.”  
“How many bullets do you have left?” The scrawny boy called to his friend and clawed at the pockets of his ragged cargo pants in an anxious search.  
“I’m on my last mag.” His shorter companion slid the aforementioned magazine into his pistol with a white-faced grimace.  
One of the team, a younger girl with reddish-brown hair and rather familiar facial features sidled closer to Andrea. “We’re going to be okay, right?”  
Her pretty face coated in a faux bravery, Andrea took the girl by the shoulders and nodded, her weak smile broken by flinches as the Mailboxes slammed against the door again and again. “Of course we are.”  
The younger one, who had to be maybe twelve or thirteen at most, eyed the door, her chest rising and falling in shallow gasps. “We should have listened to mom and dad, we should have left when we—”  
“It’s going to be fine, okay?” Andrea’s words came with a bit of a bark to them, and she gripped her sister’s shoulders with a hard stare. “I promise, Lucille. Just stay behind me, it’s going to be alright.”  
*Her sister. Poor kid. I’ll bet she asked to come along on this, probably thought it would be an easy run.*  
I swallowed a dry cough and scanned the room with worried eyes. The freaks were rallying on the barricade, and sooner or later, they might gain enough numbers to move it. I’d gotten us into this mess, so I had to find a way out, but it occurred to me that my options weren’t as numerous as I’d hoped. There weren’t any mutants in here . . . but there weren’t any doors either.  
“Hannah, talk to me.” Andrea clamped a hand over my elbow and guided me to one side, her blue irises clouded with a frenzied desperation. “What’s the plan? We can’t stay here, that door’s not going to—”  
“I know.” I rubbed at my forehead with one hand, trying to think of something. “Just give me a minute.”  
*Creeeaaak.*  
“We don’t have a minute.” She hissed back, and the door groaned with an eerie tension, rust flakes tumbling to the ground as a few of the bars began to bend.  
Heart ready to smash through my ribcage, I stalked around the room to search for a crack, a crevice, anything that could give me a way out.  
*No . . . no, no, no, it can’t be.*  
Despite how much I paced, nothing presented itself, no secret grate, no ventilation shaft conveniently big enough for us to crawl through, no hatches or trapdoors. The room was a dead end.  
Cold sank through me, and I swallowed a bitter lump of fear and regret. This was it. We were going to get torn in haff by those things, eaten alive, or dragged back to their hive as fresh meat for their larvae. What if they carried venom, or some kind of infection in their fetid jaws? Would I endure the agony one more time of the roots infecting me, spreading under my skin just the same a what I’d witnessed in the mirror back in . . .  
*That’s it.*  
My eyes flew open in realization, and I turned to Andrea. “We have to fight our way out.”  
“Are you insane?” The scrawny kid jabbed the muzzle of his rifle toward the crumbling door. “There’s at least a hundred out there! We don’t have enough bullets.”  
*Screeech.*  
Our barricade drifted a few more inches across the concrete in a whine of grinding metal, and legs flailed through the gap. In one more push, they’d be through.  
I slung the shotgun onto my back and caught Andrea’s gaze. “Cover your ears.”  
Her face flickered with confusion, but she did as I said, and the others mimicked her.   
The wall lockers fell over each other, one corner of the door caved in, and the barricade gave way.  
*You are different.*  
I shut my eyes, sucked in another lungful of musty air, and let my muscles relax. Part of me wanted to fight it, to push the odd sensation away, but the stranger’s voice floated again in my mind, urging me on.  
*That’s why you’re here.*  
I could feel the vibrations in the floor from the dozens of wooden legs, smell their greasy jaws, taste the salt from my sweat. My pulse slowed, and I let the cool, calming focus sweep over me. It didn’t matter who I had been, or who I was now. It didn’t matter what I had left behind, what Jamie or Chris thought of me, or each other. I couldn’t let more innocent people die by wallowing in my own self-pity. I couldn’t let Chaos decide my fate, or theirs. That was the objective truth.  
That was my purpose.  
Stale air rushed into my lungs, the tendons inside my lower jaw stretched, the bones popped out of socket, and my lips drifted apart.  
In a piercing siren wave, the same high, alien screech ripped from me, but this time neither of my ears hurt, and all the background noise sank to a dull murmur behind it. My head filled with static, the world began to spin, and I faintly detected the warm trickle of blood running from my right nostril, down over my upper lip. Images blurred through my brain; a rain-drenched forest, dark storm clouds, and a long gravel road in the night.  
The air left my body, and I swayed.  
Concrete smashed into my knee, and I had to steady myself with both hands pressed to the cold floor. A hard throbbing inside made my skull feel heavy, and I tasted copper on my lips, lungs sore as if they’d been pushed to their limit. My legs and arms hung from me with a rubbery numbness that ebbed away by the second, and tiny whispers faded into the air like ghosts.  
“Hey.” Someone touched my shoulder, trembling hands on my back to keep me upright. “A-Are you okay?”  
I craned my groggy head back as the static fell away to reveal a world of eerie silence. No jaws tore at the barricade, no legs poked inside. The Mailboxes had gone quiet, and not even the tunnels rang with their footfalls anymore.  
*Guess mirrors aren’t the only things that hate that sound.*  
The others stared at me, their skin white as printer paper, a mixed expression of horror and fear on most of them. Andrea searched my face with a concerned, amazed look on hers, a few strands of crimson hair hanging loose around her cheekbones.  
“Hannah.” She gave me a gentle shake. “I need you to say something, anything. Come on, snap out of it.”  
“We . . . we need to move.” I croaked, my throat sore, and climbed to my feet on shaky knees. “There could be more.”  
“What do you mean *we*?” The frizzy-haired girl who had panicked earlier took three steps back from me, her eyes hardened in a revulsion that would have hurt if I’d had the energy to care. “I’m not going anywhere with you. That’s not normal, people can’t just *do* that, you’re not—”  
Andrea spun around to throw her a vicious snarl. “You want to stay here by yourself? Help the boys move that locker, or I’ll leave you here. *Now*.”  
Susan narrowed her mud-brown eyes at Andrea but did as she asked after gracing me with another disgusted look. Both of the boys stayed quiet, but I could tell by how they shuffled away that they too were uneasy. If I’d been an oddity among them before, now I was an outcast, a freak, a leper of a different strain, and nothing I could say or do would change their minds.  
*Let them be ungrateful, it’s better than dead.*  
Two sets of arms wound under mine and took the weight off my unsteady legs.  
Lucille blinked at the lines of my tattoos with curious wonder. “So, it’s true then? You . . . you were a mutant.”  
“Lucille!” Flustered, Andrea turned to silence her sister, but I waved her off.   
“It’s fine.” Stretching my legs so the pins-and-needles would leave them, I slid my right sleeve higher so the girl could see each stenciled vine, no longer feeling so ashamed of them. “I got really sick, before ELSAR captured me. They managed to cure it, but it kinda made me look funny, so they gave me the tattoos to help.”  
“Cool.” She beamed at the markings, before Lucille’s face tinged pink in embarrassment at how it sounded, and I felt something like a grin return to my face as we shuffled to the door. “The ink, I mean. I want to get a tattoo, but *Andrea* won’t let me.”  
“You’re too young for a tattoo.” Andrea growled, and poked her head out of the gap between the barricade with the caution of a gopher in hawk territory.  
Lucille rolled her eyes, and I had to smother a wider grin at how similar they acted. “Killjoy.”  
With a groan of metal-on-cement, the boys dragged the door open, and everyone gaped in awe.  
The floor lay covered in dead Mailboxes, most of them upside down, their wooden legs frozen in the last throes of death. The boxes were bent, swollen, ruptured in places, the insides spilling out in ebony clots. Many were stacked up against the doorway, and almost a hundred more carpeted the tunnel in both directions. As my strength returned, I had to clamber over the bodies with my fellow smugglers, our shoes squishing on mutant guts the entire way. It looked as though the freaks had just exploded, popped like walking zits, and even I couldn’t help but get a flicker of nervousness at my own handiwork.  
*What the heck did I just do?*  
Andrea shook her head in bewilderment at the mass-grave of mutants and nudged one of the nearest corpses with her scoped rifle. “Well, I guess we won’t need those flamethrowers after all. Tex will be thrilled. Can . . . can you hear any more of them?”  
Accepting a drink from a water bottle she offered to me, I gulped a few lukewarm mouthfuls, and sighed. “If there’s anything else out there, it isn’t moving.”  
Her shoulders slackened, and Andrea blinked hard against moistened eyes, a disbelieving half smile on her lips. “You know, for a moment there I thought we were goners.”  
I kicked at a mailbox leg, and suppressed a gag at how it curled in reflex. “Me too.”  
Andrea glanced at the others, who began to pick their way back across the mutant-strewn battlefield and looked back at me with a melancholy grimace. “Do you really have to leave?”  
Her disappointment hurt, but I knew it was for fondness, not failure, and so I hefted my shotgun higher on one shoulder. “Unfortunately, yeah. New Wilderness can be dangerous, but it’s one of the only free places left. If we want to beat this stuff, we have to start somewhere.”  
“Would you do me a favor, then?” Andrea’s eyes wandered to her sister, who had contented herself with stomping on the limp eyestalks of the dead Mailboxes to pop them like bubble-wrap. “I don’t want Lucille to spend the rest of her life in the tunnels, hiding like a rat from the Organs. She’s a good worker, she’s smart, and she’ll hate me for it but . . . would you take her with you?”  
*Yikes, that’s going to cause an argument for sure.*  
Frowning, I looked down at my gore-covered shoes and thought hard. The journey had already promised to be daunting just for me to cross the county alone. With more people, especially someone like Lucille who had never been outside the walls, it could be even more dangerous. Deep down, I knew I couldn’t say no, not when Andrea had saved my life, and when I would have begged on hands and knees for the opportunity if it had been me. Still, Lucille would be furious, no doubt, and it would be one more person for me to worry about on my trek south.  
“You could come too.” I kept my voice low and traced a grimy line on the floor with the toe of my sneaker. “We could always use a good sharpshooter.”  
Her expression fell, and Andrea made a bittersweet smile. “I can’t leave the others. Not when victory could be so close, if your offensive succeeds. We’re a team here, they need me.”  
“*She* needs you.” I rested my hands on both hips, and pointed an elbow to where Lucille continued her eyestalk-smashing campaign. “I’m willing to take her, but fresh air and sunshine aren’t as important as family. Besides, there’s a certain handsome policeman who might be very happy to see you.”  
At that, Andrea’s cheeks went red as her hair. “He probably wouldn’t even remember me.”  
*If that newspaper cutout in Sean’s desk is any indication, he never forgot.*  
“You’d be surprised.” I winked at her and pressed the point forward with a more serious tone. “You’ve done so much here, built the resistance, found the old subway station, helped rescue me. There’s no shame in moving some of your group into safe-keeping, and we don’t have cholera in New Wilderness. Just . . . give it some thought, okay?”  
She bit her lip, and Andrea’s blue eyes sparkled in what appeared to be a small gleam of conflicted hope. “I’ll think about it.”  
The rest of the journey back through the tunnels was a silent affair, more due to the pensive thoughts of the group rather than any further precautions. As for myself, I remained torn between relief, and anxiousness at the unknown future before me. I’d crossed a Rubicon of sorts, turned a new leaf in this abandoned section of the Appalachian foothills. How or where I would belong after all this was over, I didn’t know. I wasn’t sure if I ever would. Maybe I would be doomed to roam the countryside, a hermit, living amongst the birds and beasts until the day I died. Regardless, I vowed that I wouldn’t spend the rest of my days crying over what could have been, whether it involved my old hazel eyes, or the estranged affections between Chris and I. No, if I could, I would live, and help others to do the same.  
First, however, I would have to attempt what so many others in the resistance had failed to do; cross the wall.  
Adjusting my belt, I flexed my neck so it would crack, and realized how close it was to the motion I’d seen Jamie use so many times when she had tight muscles.  
*I’m coming for you, Lansen.*  
I scowled in the dark and ground my teeth at the memory of her crocodile tears as the soldiers carried me away.  
*You can lie all you want, but it won’t make a difference once I walk back through those gates. I’m coming for you . . . and I’m gonna put an end to this.*
