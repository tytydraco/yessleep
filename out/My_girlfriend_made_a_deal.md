I don't know how big a problem this is going to be in the long run, really, because it started out so uncertain, and it still is. We're both terrified, and we don't know how to get out of this.

I'm Kelar, 22, live in a nice two bedroom apartment in a lovely area of town. The neighborhood has a woodsy feel to it; the buildings are dark brown, there's a lot of tall pine trees everywhere, and the streetlamps are warm and orange in the evening.

Something about this neighborhood makes me think of Alice, I guess. I mean, this is where I met her. I'm a sales associate at NidoMax Electronics, looking for a promotion in the future, and she's a florist, expert on anything about flowers.

She's just so in love with plants and nature in general, and as there's a lot of miniature wildlife hiding in the trees, she's right at home here. Y'know, besides the fact that she lives here and stuff.

I met her outside picking up a baby squirrel from the grass at the edge of the woods, and my heart just went out to her right away. Anyone who would rescue an abandoned baby squirrel is all right in my book. I asked her if she needed help.

Long story short, I think we both fell in love that day. Less than a year later, she was already moving in with me. Well, we both switched from our studio apartments to the big two bedroom, that is. She's only two years older than me, and it felt so perfect.

Alice has always had this wonderful, soft personality. Children seem to gravitate toward her. Dogs and cats are super calm around her. Ever rubbed a cat's stomach? You know how they like it for about four seconds, and then suddenly you turn into a freakish gremlin whose sole purpose is clearly to disembowel the feline and it defends itself suchly?

Yeah, that doesn't happen with her. I swear, she could do that cat massage ASMR for a living if she wanted.

I think part of it comes from her past. She'd been abused a lot as a kid, beaten by both of her parents. Somehow, she views everything that can't defend itself as worthy of a lifetime's worth of love and compassion. I know she doesn't like to talk about it, but she's opened up to me occasionally. I understand her way better than most people.

Well, we've both always had our careers and our hobbies. She likes walking through those woods and finding little animals to help, like lifting a fallen baby bird back into its nest, that sort of thing. I mean, that's no surprise----she actually rescued a little girl from a creep at the local park once. She'll help anyone who needs it.

I think that's what started this trouble for her.

She came home one evening after a little walk around in the trees (I'd been pretty worn out from work and went right for a shower, so unlike most times I didn't join her). She looked so happy that she seemed to be glowing.

"Alice?" I called to her with a half smile. She looked as though she'd just donated a palace to a family of raccoons. She looked up at me, her eyes lighting up, and walked to me quickly and purposefully without answering. I almost said her name a second time, but she practically collided with me, rustling the towel around my waist and knocking me back against the wall, threw her arms around me and kissed me.

I went instantly rigid. She was very touchy and liked to put her hands on me a lot, but I couldn't remember the last time she'd just come and *gotten* me like that. I don't know what else to call it. I was in complete bliss as she kissed me, and her mouth tasted different than ever before. Usually she just had that normal, generic taste (no, not strawberries or something else cliche), but this time, her lips and tongue tasted like sugar. Like she'd just drank a glass of liquid sugar or something, the flavor was just like eating a pinch of the stuff right out of the bowl.

I don't think I need to be descriptive about the rest of the evening. She just seemed to get more and more lovey over the next few minutes, and it ended with us both falling asleep *very* happily in her bed.

Just before she nodded off with her head on my chest, she finally spoke. She said just one thing. "Kel?" she murmured.

"Yeah, babe?" came my reply. It was a struggle to keep my voice from trembling; part of me wanted to still try to ask her what amazing thing had come over her, as I'd tried a few times over the past couple hours, but been either cut off with something lovely or ignored as though she couldn't hear me.

"I wish you'd sleep in my bed more often." And then I felt her settle deeper into me, that sign that she'd signed off for the night.

It sounded perfectly harmless and sweet, but to be honest, our two bedroom thing wasn't just because we thought we could use the extra space.

I toss and turn. A LOT.

So I didn't really think she'd come to stand by those words if I took them seriously. I just chalked it up to her swimming in the aftershocks of our wonderful time, and fell into dreamland with her.

Strangely, when I woke up, I found myself not flipped over, not laying on the opposite end of the bed, not up on top of a skyscraper balancing a stack of plates on my head or whatever else overactive sleepers do. I was exactly as I had been.

Alice wasn't there; I could hear soft clattering sounds in the kitchen, her making breakfast.

I started to get up, but then I felt something soft and silky slide off my shoulder, like a small cloth.

I looked down at the bed next to me and frowned. A small dusting of white powder. I reached down to it and pinched a bit between my fingers, raising it to my face. It felt like powdered sugar, and it even smelled like it. I wondered if Alice had gotten up in the middle of the night for a snack, then fallen asleep on me again.

I looked down at my shoulder, and I could suddenly see a faint indent, like a nail had dug into the skin. I remembered her hand being on that shoulder last night; she must have squeezed a bit at some point. I dunno.

I swept the stuff into my hand----it was only like two or three pinches----and dumped it into the bedside can before going out to join her.

She'd made pancakes and waffles. I was pleasantly surprised; Alice wasn't usually one for such a sweet tooth. She enjoyed robust foods like rare steak, eggs and sausage (but of course she'd never tell the forest critters that).

I saw that her brown hair looked a bit lighter than before. Her skin had taken on a slight pale, almost glowing sheen that caught her in the sunlight from the window above the kitchen sink. She turned and smiled at me, and it felt like I was looking at an angel in heaven.

During breakfast, she finally explained.

She'd met someone the previous night while out in the woods. An angel, she claimed, pretty ironic since she looked like one herself right at that moment. She said the lovely woman had put some kind of a spell over her, and told her that it was a reward for simply being the kind of person she was, always looking out for the weak, always caring for those who would have died without her. Alice thought the woman might very well have been some kind of nature spirit.

But then it got weird.

Alice said the spell----the reward----had been a claim of custody. Custody over her soul, and that of the one she loved most.

She took my hands as she spoke. "Don't you see what this means, Kel?" she whispered as her eyes filled with tears. "We don't have to stay here anymore. We can leave this all behind. There's a better place for us out there. A better *world.* All of this can just be over. We can go somewhere where all of the children and animals are safe and looked after, where no one ever gets hurt, where----"

"Alice, whoa," I said, standing up suddenly. "Where is this coming from? You sound like someone told you some kind of fairy tale and convinced you it was true."

She looked at me for a few seconds, her expression wavering. Then slowly, she began to smile, and a knowing, sympathetic look came into her eyes. "She said you might be doubtful," Alice said softly. "That you wouldn't believe, that you wouldn't understand."

She stood up and walked toward me, raising her hands. "But she said that there's a simple fact of life that solves the problem of disbelief."

I noticed that there was something white under her fingernails. On both hands. "Alice...?"

"Sometimes, when you truly know better than the one you love," she whispered softly, "it's easier to do what's best for them, and then earn their forgiveness later, than let them suffer."

She turned her hands over, palms up, and opened and closed them rapidly, tapping her fingertips into her palms. As she did, white dust sprinkled out from under her fingernails. Fine, pure white. And the smell drifted toward me as she did, along with a gentle gust of warm wind that smelled like sweet bread, combining with the sugary scent.

I felt as though I might fall asleep, but I struggled to keep my eyes open. She raised her hands over my head and fluttered her fingers. I could feel the dust sprinkling into my hair. I felt mesmerized; what on earth was she doing? What did she mean? What was going on? Was this some kind of romantic roleplay?

She lowered her hands to my face and very gently began to rub the white powder into my eyes. I reflexively reached up to push her hands away, but my arms only got about halfway. Then they kind of just drooped.

That feeling when a drop of water gets in your eyes, that sting----I was feeling the opposite. It was like a dehydrated person gulping down ice water. The soothing feeling of pleasure seeped from my eyes into my head as she softly rubbed more and more of the stuff into my eyes, blurring my vision, clouding everything.

"This will help you submit," she said softly. "I'm sorry, Kel. But I knew she was right. I knew you might not accept it so easily. So I agreed for both of us. I granted her custody of my soul as she asked, and I signed yours too."

I started to gain a little sense back as she spoke. "Wait...what...?"

"We don't have to lose our souls," she said softly, her voice quivering, rubbing and smearing the soft powder into my eyes. Everything looked so pure white, so lovely, and I felt so cloudy and drowsy. "We just have to promise her control over them. So she can give us peace. That's what angels do, Kel. And she found me----she found us both----and wants to give us eternity."

She kissed me again, just like she had last night, full and deep. It went on for a little over a minute. I was on cloud nine.

Now, ordinarily I would have asked her VERY nervously if someone might have possibly drugged her out there and fed her some kind of crazy nightmare fantasy. It sounded like she was talking about dying and going to heaven.

But I couldn't speak. I think I almost fell asleep standing up there, but I still just barely managed to hang on.

After a few minutes of that...I don't know what to call it, "eye massage," she finally took my hand. The whole world was pure white as snow to me now, clean white all around, like the sheets and pillows at a five star hotel.

She was leading me gently like a lost child. Out the front door...over to the side of the building...toward a dark patch of trees that led to a particularly deep part of the woods.

"I told her I'd bring you first thing in the morning, after we consummated."

*Consummated? Last night was you technically completing a deal with some drunken stranger?* Thoughts flowed to me almost fully sharp and natural, but I couldn't for the life of me get them out.

She parted a large, leafy branch with her free hand, and I followed along obediently, barely able to see; although a bit of my vision had come back. I couldn't stop blinking, though. That stuff...that wonderful stuff, whatever it was. I felt like I'd dived headfirst into a giant pile of it. One small part of me wondered if it was crack, but THAT was taking things a consigned soul too far, don'cha think?!

Someone stood way back in the shadows of a dark clearing, waiting for us. A tall woman, with dark skin. From far away I couldn't really make her out very well, especially with the white powder clouding my vision, but...

And then she stepped out from behind a tree that had thrown a shadow over her features.

My stomach went ice cold with fear. She looked beautiful----as beautiful as Alice----perfectly sculpted like a goddess, wearing a robe as white as the hypnotic dust.

Her eyes were red. Her smile was wide and malicious.

"Come closer, sweetheart," she called out. Her voice was so gentle, and it flowed into my ears, mixing with the powdery hypnosis perfectly for a moment. "Come and join me."

But then reality came flooding back. I yanked my hand out of Alice's and quickly swiped at my eyes.

"Wh-what the fuck?" I shrieked. What had I been doing? What was I agreeing to? What deal had Alice made?

"Kel!" she yelped, startled. "Don't be so scared, she won't hurt us! It's all right! Kel!" She reached for me, but I was backing away. My vision was clearing.

I looked up at the woman across the dark clearing. Her face was twisted into a scowl. "There's no need to run, Kelar," she called, sounding as gentle and sweet as any angel. Gauzy wings, transparent butterfly wings, flitted behind her back, seeming to phase right through the robe. Her fingernails were curved into knifelike claws. And her eyes were like sharp red rubies, glowing at me as she stalked toward us both. "Alice already made the deal."

I grabbed Alice's hand and pulled her back through the trees. She protested and tried to yank back, but I was taller, stronger, I wouldn't let that thing get us.

"She's an angel! She wants to help! Kel!" Alice was sobbing now. "Why can't you accept it? We're both already bound to her anyway!" White powder cascaded from her free hand as she desperately pawed at my arm, trying to stop me running.

But whatever that woman had done to Alice, whatever spell she'd put over her, I knew it would only lead to something worse than either of us could imagine. She thought I would be as willing as Alice, but whatever that white dust was, it wasn't strong enough to put me under the same spell.

Almost.

But I loved Alice too much to fully slip under, and I was glad I'd remained wary.

She was panting heavily as I finally pulled her into our second story apartment and slammed and locked the door.

"Would you just let her explain!" Alice cried, extending her hands out at me, pacifying. "You don't have to do this, Kel! It can be over! We can----we can move *on* now!"

"I don't want to move on!" I argued with her. "I want to keep living just like we are! She's got you, Alice----you need to get her out of your head! It's a trap!"

"You don't understand!" Alice wept. "You really don't! If you would just let me..."

I'm not sure why I was so rejective to that creature's advances. Maybe some people could just sense the evil. Maybe some couldn't, like Alice. So lovely, so trusting, so helpful...and suggestible enough to take advantage of.

I hurriedly packed a bag for us both, starting in her room, then going to mine. Alice sat on the sofa in the living room, sniffling, after I'd hugged her and promised I was going to get us out of this. "Don't wanna get out of it," she sniffed, tears soaking her cheeks. "Don't *wanna.* I just want to..." she hiccupped, "be..." (hiccup) "with you..."

By the time I'd zipped up enough clothes, toiletries and a few odds and ends into the duffel bag, I turned around to find her hovering inches from my face.

"Just let me kiss you again," she whispered. "I didn't get you ready enough last time. If you just let me try again..."

"Alice," I said urgently, taking her face in my hands, "you've got to snap out of this. You've *got* to. I don't know what she is, but she isn't an angel. She's trying to...well, I don't know that either, and I don't know if we should call the cops or not, but let's at least get out of here and somewhere she can't find us before we do anything else, okay?"

She remained silent for a moment, and I could tell her thoughts were racing. Finally she spoke, "Why don't we just let her give her side of the story? You'll believe her then, I bet. Just like I did."

And then I saw it, out of the corner of my eye. In the window behind my bed. That woman. Smiling in at me. Clawed hands pressed against the window.

"You owe me," she sang softly, and began to tap her fingers against the glass.

Alice's expression shifted, became slightly dreamy, but the window muffled the voice enough to keep it from affecting me right away. "Come on," I said tensely, grabbing her hand and pulling her toward the front door. Luckily, it was on the other side of the apartment from my window, or else we'd have been stuck.

Down the stairs.

Into the parking lot.

Halfway to my car, my ears full of Alice's gentle protesting, before I heard that chilling sound ring out across the lot.

"One person can sign for another," she called out tauntingly. "It's legal, you know. For my kind, anyway. She loves you more than anything. Special circumstances, Kelar." She was marching full speed across the grass toward us.

"She's right," Alice whispered. "I love you more than anything and anyone, ever, Kelar. You're the only person I've ever met who deserved that much from me. Mom and Dad didn't, but she finally helped me deal with it."

She raised her hands again. This time, she rubbed her thumbs across her fingertips, brushing away some of the white powder.

Underneath the powder that seemed to come from under her nails like some mystical creature, I could see the crescent shapes I hadn't seen before.

Reddish brown. A tiny piece flaked off of one of her fingertips and fell to the ground.

We stared at each other, and the realization hit me like an ocean wave. I wondered just how early she'd gotten up this morning. Or...last night after I fell asleep, maybe? Or maybe somehow before she'd even come in and kissed me the first time?

My frenzied mind was going with door number three.

But I loved Alice. I knew she'd never hurt me. I wouldn't abandon her.

I took her hand and practically begged her into the passenger seat. She protested, she cried, she begged right back.

The robed woman was only seconds away by now.

"We're going to die!" I shrieked frantically. "Right now, Alice, or we're going to die!"

She blinked, flustered, and stopped talking, shaking for a moment. Then, with a sort of half-confused stutter, she stumbled right into the closed door, yanked it open, and slid inside.

My heart leaped. Was she coming back a little?

I jumped into the driver's seat, yanked the bag into the car and dumped it over my shoulder into the backseat. Hit the full lock on the door and shoved the key in the ignition.

*Tap tap.* She smiled at me through the driver side window.

I backed up, barely glancing behind me, and floored it away. Heading for a motel, a rest stop, anywhere but here. Then we could call the police, could call anyone, could do anything, just as long as we weren't anywhere near her.

The most frightening thing was how she didn't even try to stop us in that last moment. She smiled at me in the rearview mirror, raised her hand, and fluttered her fingers at me.

My heart leaped into my throat. I know we'll see her again.

"Kel?" Alice mumbled, sounding sleepy and confused. "Where are we going?"

We'd gotten out onto the highway. It was still early. Hardly any traffic out.

"Somewhere safe."

I squeezed her hand, and she squeezed back. As uncertain as she was right then, she remembered me, remembered what was real, and that was what mattered more than anything.
