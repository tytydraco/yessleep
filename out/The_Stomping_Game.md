There was recently an earthquake around where I live here in Jersey. Thankfully, other than a few broken valuables, I’m safe and my home avoided major damage. During the aftermath of it all, I had a memory resurface that I hadn’t thought of in quite some time. I’m not sure if it was the vibrations I felt during the tremors that triggered it or just the stress of the situation, but now the memory is as clear as day to me, so I figured I’d write it down before it vanished again.

It’s been a while since I was a child. I’m 36 now, if that puts the timespan into perspective. I’m single, have no children, and live alone, so childlike imagination rarely has any place in my day-to-day life. Sleep, work, eat, repeat. That’s about it. When the memory flooded back into my mind, though, it was as if I was transported back in time.

I called it the Stomping Game. I came up with it when I was around 12 years old. My mom and dad usually worked late, and my only sibling was always involved with sports and friends, so it was usually just me in the house during the summers and until late evening after school. I typically occupied myself with TV, my Playstation, or whatever entertainment I could find at the time.

One summer morning, while playing Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 and enjoying the house to myself, an idea came to me. This idea wasn’t too outlandish for a kid to muster. I simply wanted to create a game. Not a video game, but something physical, like hopscotch or duck duck goose. I didn’t have many friends, other than a few cordial buddies I only saw during the school year, so I wanted to come up with something I could play by myself. Excited to write down the details, I quickly grabbed a pencil and scribbled the rules and steps on a piece of paper. Where that paper remains today is beyond me. We moved from that house when I was 16, so the transcript was probably lost somewhere along the way. Despite no tangible evidence, I now once again remember everything written on it. Each rule, each step, down to the tiniest detail.

I am about to transcribe the written portion of the Stomping Game now. As a word of warning, I ask that if you are brave enough to try this game yourself, you proceed with caution. If you do wish to play the game, I ask that you first read my own experience, described below, before doing so. My only wish is to explain the game, not place anyone in the way of danger.


The rules of the Stomping Game are as follows:

Rule 1 - You must seclude yourself in an enclosed space. The only specifics for this enclosed space are that it must include some form of an entrance that can be opened or closed, and this entrance must remain closed during the duration of the game.

Rule 2 - You must be alone. If anyone is in the enclosed space with you, the game will not work. Do not try to trick the game and hide someone in the enclosed space.

Rule 3 - You must shut off all noise to your ears. Whether you use your hands or a device to do this is up to you. 

Rule 4 - You must not speak. Speaking at all during the game is not permitted. There must be complete silence once the game has begun.

Rule 5 - You must not open your eyes. Opening your eyes during the game will result in the game’s immediate conclusion.

Rule 6 - Once you have played and concluded the game, you may not play again.



The steps of the Stomping Game are as follows:

Step 1 - Find an enclosed, secluded area to play the game. An empty room, a tent, a playhouse, etc. can be used. The only specifics are that the space is away from others and has an entrance that can be opened and closed. If the space does not follow these specifics, the game will not work. Be advised, a larger area proves more suitable and safer for this game.

Step 2 - Cut off sound to your ears. Headphones or earplugs work the best, but holding your hands over the ears completely will also work. It is important that no outside sound makes it into your ears. To know that you have followed this step correctly, you should be able to faintly hear the beating of your heart through your ears. It is important to not speak at any point once you have covered your ears so as to not break the rules of the game.

Step 3 - Upon complete silence and seclusion, begin counting from 1 to 67 in your head. Make sure to count slowly and steadily. Rushing through the count can lead to mishaps. 

Step 4 - As you count up to the number 67, become aware of any vibrations around you. These vibrations will begin slowly, but hasten as you count down. At first they will feel like distant bumps, growing gradually into steps resonating through the base of your enclosed area. For the best chances, place yourself seated at the center of your space, so as to be able to feel all the vibrations that take place.

Step 5 - Once you approach the number 67, prepare yourself. The vibrations will begin to feel like close stomps, advancing and retreating in no particular rhythm. If the stomps appear to be advancing towards you at a quickened pace, uncover your eyes as quickly as possible, ending the game.

Step 6 - If you have made it this far, then congratulations, you have won the game.

Step 7 - In the future, you will feel the urge to play the game once again. It is best to bask in the knowledge that you beat the game and forget it exists. Do not, DO NOT play the game again.


Once I had everything written down, I wanted to try the game for myself. I was so excited and proud of myself for what I had created. Being the angsty teen I was at the time, I chose to take inspiration from spooky games like Bloody Mary and Ouija Boards. As a teenage mind tends to do, my thoughts wandered to the grandeur of bringing this game to school to share with my friends, making me popular for once.

Following along with what I had written down, I chose my bedroom as my ideal enclosed space. My parents and sibling were occupied and away for the day, so I knew the house would remain empty for quite some time. Placing the Bose QC1 headphones I used for my Playstation over my ears and taking a seat on the patterned rug in the middle of my room, I began to play the game.

I began counting up. I made sure to proceed slowly and to enunciate each syllable in my mind, as to not mess up any detail of the game. I first felt it at around 29. Knowing the game I had just concocted held zero probability of being real, I thought it was just my imagination, but it started to steadily grow with each number I counted. By 42, it felt like something was crawling outside my bedroom door. I didn’t dare open my eyes in perpetual fear, continuing to count on. At 49, thumps pattered around what I felt were the edges of my room. The thumps grew gradually and would occasionally feel closer to where I sat. I was stubborn enough to keep counting, but the anxiety of what I had started hung over me. As I made my way to 55, the stomps were like waves on a beach, waxing and waning around me. I began the final count. 64, 65, 66. Petrified, I counted 67. The vibration stopped. I could feel sweat beading on my forehead. The temptation to open my eyes and look around began to take over, but the curiosity of what would happen next kept it at bay. 

Just as I felt the relief of my game not being a reality, the stomping started up again. I could feel it moving towards me hastily. Boom, boom, boom. I felt the stomping through the floor. Right before the vibrations made it to my position, I opened my eyes. My once closed door now open was the only evidence of anything happening. Nothing was there. I took the headphones off my ears, wiped the sweat off my face, and looked around. As my auditory senses rushed back to me, my eyes drifted down to the carpeted floor. Foot impressions littered the space around me, like steps in the snow. I panicked and began to wipe away the evidence with my own foot, moving the strands of carpet back to their previous positions. As I did this, I realized that the prints left behind engulfed the size of my own. I continued to glide my foot back and forth along every square inch of the carpet until no evidence was left. 

That is all I remember from this event. Beyond that one singular memory, I don’t recall ever trying the game again. Pretty successfully, I might add, I forgot its existence until now. Moving forward, I plan to forget it again, letting the Stomping Game, my very own Frankenstein’s monster, live on in the minds of other brave participants.

Unfortunately, the urge to play again is continuing to grow…
