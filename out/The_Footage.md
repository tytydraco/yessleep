We moved to the country for peace. At least, that’s what I thought.

The house was old. Two stories, white paint flaking off its sides like dried skin. The porch sagged. A single wind chime clinked even when there was no wind. Behind it, thirty feet of yard and then the woods—a wall of bark and shadow that swallowed the sun by afternoon.

May said it was nice and quiet.

She was a writer; she ate shit like this up.

It started with a fox. Late October. The leaves were bone-dry, and the sky looked peeled open.

May spotted it near the tree line. Limping, narrow as a branch, eyes hollow.

The next night she left out food scraps.

“Just in case she’s hungry,” May said, batting her baby blues at me. "Just this once."

This quickly became a daily ritual.

By November, she’d bought bulk dog food and stored it in a plastic container with a blue snap-tight lid.

Except she was always too busy to take it out herself. So, it became my responsibility.

Every night, I’d carry it out to this rotten stump and leave it with the lid off. By morning, something had knocked it over and picked it clean.

Routine.

Until the container started disappearing. I would walk out and find the lid and nothing else.

At first, it was rare. We would scratch our heads, and May would buy another one. We joked about it. Raccoons. Coyotes. A starving skinwalker.

But the more consistently it happened, the more annoyed May became. Her eyes lingered sometimes. On those woods.

“I want to know,” she said. “I gotta know.”

“Why?”

I was standing behind her while she worked on her laptop, fingers firing away at keys.

“I can’t focus,” May said. “Unless I figure this out.”

“Whatever floats your boat.”

She bought a trail camera. Cheap. Night vision, motion detection. She insisted it would pay for itself in satisfaction.

The first night we set it up, she asked me to seal the lid.

“If it’s shut, the thing’ll have to fumble it open. That’ll guarantee the camera picks it up.”

I didn’t like her referring to it as a ‘thing’.

“Animal,” I corrected as she adjusted the angle of the camera.

“Whatever.”

I carried it out. Clicked the lid shut and left it there like bait.

The next morning, it was gone. And the camera was facing the sky.

“What?”

May stormed out into the yard. “What happened?”

“Maybe an owl hit it,” I suggested.

“No!” she snapped, fidgeting with her phone. “I’m checking the footage.”

I made coffee while May fast-forwarded through hours of footage on her phone.

“It just turns!” She shouted from the living room. “Over the course of an hour! It slowly turns up!”

I glanced out the kitchen window, swallowing the lump in my throat.

“I’ll buy another one!”

“Are you…” my voice faltered.

Through the window, I saw it.

The container was there on the edge of the woods. A twisted and broken piece of plastic.

It wasn’t there a moment ago. Something was out there.

“May,” I said. “Maybe we should stop putting food out.”

Silence.

I looked over my shoulder into the living room.

May was on the couch, staring at her phone. Her expression was blank.

“May?”

May straightened and looked up. “What are you talking about?”

“The container is out there.”

“Huh?”

She hurried into the kitchen when I didn’t answer, spotting the container.

“When did that get there?” She ran from the kitchen, appearing in the backyard a moment later. She ran across the open, ponytail bouncing.

I stared, something twisting in my stomach.

It was out there.

The thing.

She slowed to a stop, kneeling over the container. She picked it up and waved it in the air.

“Come back,” I whispered. “Hurry up.”

Behind May, the trees rustled.

She stood and ran back to the house, mangled container in hand.

Later that day, she went shopping. She came home with a new container and an extra camera.

This camera was more expensive. She didn’t tell me the specs of it.

“I’ll set it up so they’re within view of each other,” she said. “That way, whatever moved it last time can’t do it again without being seen.”

That night, May put the food out herself.

I sat on the couch, staring at the mangled container on the coffee table. It looked like it had been twisted until it simply came apart.

When May came inside, she looked content.

“I miss the city,” I said as she joined me on the couch.

“The city is for pussies,” May said, kicking the mangled container. “It’s too expensive.”

My gaze lingered on the container.

“What do you think did that?”

“I think it’s wolves.”

I peeled my eyes off the container and gawked at her.

“Wolves? May, you’re joking.”

“Nope. I think there are wolf people out there. They must be struggling to find game if they’re scrounging for dog food in people’s backyards.” She devolved into laughter as she said it.

I wasn’t even smiling.

May's brown eyes lit up. 

“Come on,” she said, taking my hand. “You want to sit out here and stew about torn-up plastic, or do you want to have sex?”

I let her lead me to the bedroom. But I couldn't get it out of my head. Were May's eyes always brown?

The next morning, May was gone when I woke up.

I found her in the backyard, standing over an empty container.

“May?” I lingered in the doorway, watching her.

She didn’t look up.

“What’s wrong?”

May’s head rose slowly, facing the woods. Her mouth was moving. Her hair shifted in a soft breeze.

The trees danced before her.

I stepped further out, squinting in the fresh daylight.

“Where are you going?” May popped out of the house behind me, holding her phone.

I jumped, whirling on her.

“May? But…” I looked back to the woods, finding nothing but an empty food container.

“It’s empty,” May said. “I already checked. Let’s see the footage.”

“May,” I said, injecting as much steel into my voice as I could manage. “I just saw you outside. Where have you been?”

May cocked an eyebrow at me. “I’ve been on the couch for ten minutes,” she said. “I literally watched you zombie walk to the door and stand there slack-jawed like an idiot.”

I stared at her. Was I half asleep?

No.

I knew what I saw.

Maybe it was someone who happened to look like May…. wearing the exact same outfit.

“Come on,” May groaned. “I want to see the footage. You coming or what?”

I stiffly followed her to the couch as she pulled up the camera app on her phone.

We watched the first camera’s footage first.

The video started ordinarily. A possum. Wind moving branches.

Then at 2:43 am the screen glitched. A splice. Like something had stitched itself into the feed.

Tall and thin. Arms that ended in stumps. Its body was static, as if the footage was being burned where he stood.

Where its head should’ve been, there was a fan—a wide, spiraling crest of human eyes, each moving on its own. Some bloodshot. Some glassy. Some wet and oozing pus.

Then, one by one, they turned. Each eye settled on the camera.

They stared.

We stared.

Neither of us spoke.

One of the eyes grew closer, the pupil splitting apart as it filled up the camera. 

It was familiar to me. I couldn't place how. 

Then the feed cut out.

A crack zipped across May’s phone. She yelped and dropped it.

I couldn’t speak.

May was grinning.

What was she grinning about?

“May.”

“We found it,” she said. “I got it on video!”

“May, what the fuck are you talking about?”

“It saw me. It saw us, don’t you understand?”

I stood slowly, backing away from her.

May barked a laugh, raising both hands to her face.

My blood ran cold.

“Now it’ll know. It’ll see us wherever we are. We’ll always be seen.”

There was a knock on the door, and I screamed.

May laughed again.

I looked from her to the door, trying to keep my breathing steady.

Another knock.

A shadow moved across the curtained window.

“Come on,” May said. “This is what I’ve been waiting for. We’ve been out here for months. Finally!”

“May, are you serious right now?”

“Shut up, the good parts happening!”

I was trembling where I stood.

The shadow returned to the window. Tall and shifting. The part that should be its head split, spreading out like a fan.

Another knock. The door rattled.

May stood and approached the window.

“Don’t you want to know?” She asked, peeling the curtain back. “Aren’t you curious?”

I closed my eyes. I couldn’t tell you why I did it; it was just a reflex. Like a child flinching when a parent shouts.

Silence.

A strange warmth.

Glass shattered.

When I opened my eyes, May was gone.

And a food container sat on the floor by the window.

Inside it was a single blue eye, staring up at me.
