This happened when I was in kindergarten. My family lived in a small apartment with two bedrooms and a living room. My parents had one room, and I had the other. Each room had one of those old redwood sofas that people buy because they last forever. They were heavy, hard, and always cold to the touch no matter what season it was.

That night started like any other. My dad came home late from overtime. He was a police officer, so that wasn’t unusual, but I still remember his face looking strangely tense when he walked in. My mom told me to go to bed right away. While I was getting under the blanket, I heard my parents whispering about something in the living room. Their voices were low and quick, and I knew it wasn’t the kind of conversation I was supposed to hear.

Nothing about that should have stood out. It was just a normal night. The only difference was that I simply could not fall asleep. I tossed and turned for what felt like forever. I wasn’t scared at first. I just felt a weird sort of restlessness, like the air in the room was too still or too heavy.

Eventually I rolled onto my side and looked at the redwood sofa. I remembered placing my Barbie doll on it before bed, so I expected to see it sitting there.

Instead, I saw a person.

A man was sitting on the sofa.

His skin was so dark that I couldn’t make out his face, and it wasn’t the kind of dark you see on actual people. It looked more like a shadow pretending to be a human. But he was wearing a white shirt, and he wasn’t wearing any shoes. He sat completely still. His posture was straight, almost stiff. And he was staring directly at me.

I froze instantly. My whole body stopped moving. I didn’t blink or breathe. I couldn’t look away from him because I felt like something terrible would happen if I did.

I don’t know how long we stared at each other. It felt like time stopped. All I could feel was this overwhelming pressure in my chest, like I was sinking into the bed.

At some point I finally snapped. I screamed louder than I ever had in my life and ran out of the room. I was crying so hard I could barely explain what happened to my parents. My dad reacted immediately. He grabbed his belt and rushed into my room as if he was going to catch someone inside. I still have no idea why he chose the belt, but maybe it was instinct.

He didn’t find anyone.

He checked the corners, the window, the closet, and even under my bed. The room was empty. He relaxed a little and started telling me it was probably just clothes piled on the sofa. He even told me to look so I could see it myself.

But when he turned toward the sofa in the middle of his explanation, he suddenly stopped talking.

The sofa was completely empty. No clothes, no toys, nothing that could look like a person. Just the cold redwood surface.

He didn’t try to explain it again. He just took me to their room and told me to sleep with them for the rest of the night.

The next morning, my mom burned incense in my room. She kept whispering a small prayer while the smoke curled up toward the ceiling. I didn’t ask why she did it, and she didn’t explain. But after that day, I never saw that figure again.

At least not in that apartment.

When we moved a few years later, something else happened. I saw someone again. This time it wasn’t a man. It was a woman standing where she shouldn’t have been.

But that’s another story.
