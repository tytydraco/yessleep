I started as a seasonal ranger at Black Hollow in late spring, when the air still held a chill and the trees hadn’t fully leafed out. The park was typical — wide trails, lakefronts, the occasional drunk camper. Not glamorous, but I enjoy the outdoors, and there’s not much paperwork.

Funnily enough, the only thing that really stood out to me in that first week was the old signage. Nearly all of it featured the same character:

Wally the Forest Ranger.

Big cartoon glasses. Green uniform. Huge shoes and a cheesy smile. He had slogans like:

“Take care of the forest and it will take care of you!”

“Stay on the trail — it never fails!”

“Leave nothing but footprints, take nothing but memories!”

You know the vibe. 

Wally’s design screamed 1960s. Bright colors, bold outlines, hand-painted lettering. They were charming in that retro way, like gas station mascots from a bygone era.

I mean, cute, I guess? But there was something about him that felt… off. Maybe it was the eyes. They weren’t drawn wrong, but they didn’t quite line up either. Or maybe the smile was just too forced, like he was trying too hard to be liked? 

As the weeks passed, I started to see Wally everywhere. Old signs located along the trails. Cut-outs in front of abandoned visitor centers. A giant fiberglass statue in the overgrown campground. I even found an old metal lunchbox in a storage shed; Wally was on it, holding a rake and trash bag.

It frustrating seeing the park run down like this, and it was certainly strange seeing this mascot everywhere. I wasn’t the only one who wasn’t a fan of Wally. My supervisor, Tanya, told me. 

“Kids hate him. Locals too.” 

“So why’s he still everywhere?” I asked.

She shrugged. “Budget cuts, man. You’d be amazed what gets left behind.”

I asked her where he came from. She didn’t know. Some old regional campaign, possibly. 

She always changed the subject. It was odd but I didn’t think much of it. I was just happy to be out in the peace and quiet. But unfortunately for me, my relationship with Wally was only just beginning. 

It started small.

I’d walk the trail near Eagle’s Ridge and pause at a Wally sign I knew well - same idiotic smile, same “Clean up your mess!” line, but something seemed… off. 

Perhaps the angle had shifted just slightly. Or maybe it was that his raised finger, always pointing to the sky, now bent a degree to the left. Toward the trees. It was subtle enough that I questioned myself. Memory playing tricks kinda thing.

Then another sign up near the old picnic area had both eyes scratched out, like someone had gouged them with a blade. I thought it might’ve been teenagers, but the only campers in the area that week were a pair of elderly birders from Wisconsin. Still, vandalism happens.

I let it go.

Same thing with the mural on the side of the tool shed. Wally had always been wearing his vintage uniform. But that morning, I swear, he was wearing the same thing as me.

I asked Tanya if someone had repainted it. A practical joke to welcome me to the job. Some lame hazing or something. 

She gave me a weird look. “That mural’s been sun-faded since the ‘80s. Nobody’s touched it.”

I was confused. A little creeped out but I moved on.

Days later, I was picking up old trash from a forgotten trail when I spotted a building I'd never seen on the maps. It was half-hidden in brush, roof sagging under decades of snow. Moss blanketed the shingles. The front door had no handle. I pried it open with my multitool and stepped inside.

It was an old visitors center. Place was filled with park information, taxidermied animals, flyers about summer programs, that sort of thing. In the middle of the room sat an old projector. It was on one of those wheeled carts every high school used to have. In front of it was a fraying screen covered in mildew. 

I don’t know what compelled me to play it. It shouldn’t even have worked. But after a loud pop and hum, the film crackled to life.

It was grainy with saturated colors. Wally stood next to a boy scout. A jingle played:

“Wally the Forest Friend says keep the forest clean! Pack your trash, douse your fire, and leave the forest green!” 

Wally’s mouth moved a little off-sync. The kid was holding a marshmallow stick.

It was all very innocent. Retro. Pretty lame, but kinda fun. Like I said, the guy was kitschy as hell. 

But then the film jumped.

One second, Wally was talking to the boy. Next second, the screen was static and then Wally was alone. Still smiling. Still waving. But the forest behind him had darkened. The colors desaturated. The sky went from baby blue to grey. The boy was gone. Then back. Wally was just staring at him. 

The boy look scared. Wally started speaking but it was hard to make out… 

And it was a good octave lower than his speaking voice. I leaned closer trying to hear what he was saying to the boy. Then the cartoon glitched again, and Wally was closer.

Looking out. 

Looking… at me?

It glitched back and the happy go lucky Wally was teaching a PSA again. 

I got a weird feeling that didn’t go away. 

When I left the visitors center, something about the air had changed. It wasn’t just that the sky was dimming early or the sudden hush in the trees. It was as if I’d stepped over some invisible boundary when I watched that film, and now the forest wasn’t interested in letting me go the same way I came. And for the first time, in all my days of being out in the woods, I was lost. 

I moved deeper into the forest. The terrain sloped downward, thick with rotting pine needles and ferns so high they brushed my chest. My boots squelched in soft earth, and even the insects had gone quiet. Every now and then, I’d hear a faint snapping sound. Like a twig breaking far off, and I’d freeze. But nothing ever followed.

Then I saw smoke.

It was faint, like the ghost of a campfire long dead. I followed it.

After ten minutes, the trees broke into a clearing. A shallow ring of scorched earth lay at the center, ringed by chunks of broken stone that might’ve once been benches or maybe some kind of fire-pit circle. The ground was blackened, cracked, ash-flecked. Whatever fire had burned here had done more than roast marshmallows.

Sitting just beyond the ring, half-collapsed under vines, was a wooden structure — an old scout shelter or amphitheater, maybe. The roof had caved in one corner, and graffiti scrawled in charcoal across the front read: “HE WALKS AFTER FIRE.”

I stood there for a long time. Then I stepped toward the stone circle. Something crunched underfoot. I looked down. Burnt plastic. Melted, but still recognizable.

A pair of shattered eyeglasses. Thick, round lenses. I knelt, stomach flipping.

They looked just like Wally’s.

But the glass was bubbled and warped, the metal blackened and twisted like it had been thrown into a bonfire. I picked them up and turned them over. The arms were gone. Nothing else nearby. Just the glasses. 

But I did see something in the dirt. A footprint. Not a boot. Not a sneaker. Barefoot. Toes warped. Blackened. Burned. Like someone had walked straight through a blaze and left the skin behind.

Suddenly, I felt like I wasn’t alone. I looked around… The empty forest stared back at me. 

But the feeling still nagged me. Was someone behind me? 

I grabbed my phone and flipped the camera into selfie mode. As soon as I looked at the screen, my stomach dropped... Behind me, way off in the distance, was a figure.

Suspenders. Round glasses. A silhouette but not quite. The limbs were too long. The head too still. He didn’t move. I didn’t either. I blinked and he was gone.

I quickly made my way out of there, and by some grace of God, found my way to a trail. 

That night, I thought I heard something crunching in the woods. I stepped out with my flashlight.

Just trees.

Just wind.

The next morning, someone had rearranged the pinecones in front of my hut. They spelled "Hi.”

I started finding Wally signs again. But it was different now. New cutouts I swore I hadn’t seen before. A sign pinned to the door of the outhouse, showing Wally pointing directly at the viewer, with red ink scribbled under his feet: “You forgot something.”

I removed it. Tossed it. But the next day, it was back.

I told Tanya. She half-listened while eating a sandwich.

“Someone probably squatting out here. Old guy maybe. Creep. Happens more than you’d think.”

I spent the next day combing the woods near the old cabin. I kept finding more Wally merch—stickers stuck to trees, Wally-themed coloring books in perfect condition, Wally’s face on paper plates tied to branches with fishing line. None of it made sense.

I couldn’t shake the feeling. Something about this place didn’t sit right.

I borrowed Tanya’s car and drove an hour to a small-town public library. In the archive room, buried among faded brochures and yellowing newspapers, I found him.

Bernard “Wally” Walcott. 1963–1972. A friendly-looking man in every photo: round glasses, suspenders, an easy smile. He’d started the “Forest Friend” initiative. Wally, the cartoon mascot, was based on him.

Then the article took a turn.

In July of 1969, something went wrong. Some suspected bullying. Others blamed the isolation out in the woods. Either way, something broke in Wally.

While leading a group of young scouts, he tied them up and set the whole campsite on fire. Maybe they ignored one too many of his safety messages. Only two boys made it out. 

The park never recovered. Visitation plummeted. 

I was freaked out. But the idea of me actually seeing this guy, his ghost or whatever? Surely the problem was my mental well being. I told myself it was stress. The mind playing tricks. 

Occam’s Razor anyone?

I started doing yoga. Breathing exercises. Took sleeping aides to get plenty of rest. Anything to reduce stress and anxiety. And it worked. I calmed down. I stopped seeing the figure. 

Weeks later, a group of campers arrived. Four guys from Chicago doing a reunion trip. Nice enough. They hiked all day, drank all night. I warned them about staying away from any abandoned structures.

They didn’t listen.

Few nights in, they complained the old shower block was “cursed”. Said they kept hearing noises at night, like metal screeching, doors slamming, kids screaming.

One guy, said he saw a figure watching them through the steam while he pissed behind the showers. Said it looked like a man, but not really. Said it smelled like “wet matches”.

I didn’t tell him what I’d seen, or experienced. Instead, I hiked out there myself the next morning to check it out. The shower block was a rotting concrete cube, windowless, half-collapsed in places. Graffiti caked every surface — all pretty harmless. Ghosts, dicks, pentagrams. You know the deal. 

But something new had been added recently. A mural, painted in a childlike scrawl across one entire wall.

It was Wally.

But not the cartoon version. Not the smiling mascot.

This Wally had empty black pits for eyes. His grin split his face like an axe wound. His hat was half-burned, melting into his skull. His arm, once used to cheerfully wag a finger, now ended in a charred, skeletal stump, as if he'd been reaching for someone in a fire.

And beneath him, in the same childish script:

"HE BURNS WHAT YOU LEAVE BEHIND"

I couldn’t downward dog my way out of this one. I was scared. 

And that night, just past 2am, something screamed from the woods behind my ranger hut. Not human. Not animal.

The place also smelt. Like smoke. Like… wet matches. 

I looked out my window. Far down the slope, through the trees, a figure stood.

Tall. Thin. Wrong.

Wearing the shreds of a ranger uniform. Smoke pouring out of its back. Head tilted to one side like it didn’t know how a neck worked. And even at that distance, I could see two glowing blank holes where its cartoon eyes used to be.

It pointed a skeletal, blistered finger at me.

I didn’t sleep. I waited. This time I knew it was not stress. I knew it was not loneliness. He was there. It was time for me to get out.  

At sunrise, I walked around the cabin. No footprints. No marks. But the pinecones were back. This time they spelled out the words “BAD BOY”. I burned them in the fire pit.

I messaged Tanya I was leaving. She offered me a ride. We agreed for her to pick me up on the main road a few clicks east. I went on my way down the necessary trail. 

The wind picked up. It blew in one direction only: toward that creepy fire ring. It hissed as it moved, dry and haze-like, carrying the scent of burning cedar.

And then I heard the jingle.

Soft. Warped. That same clunky, old-timey tune from the film reel. Only, it wasn’t coming from a speaker.

It was being whistled. Off-key. Slow. From somewhere among the trees. It took me a second to recognize. 

It was Wally’s theme.

I turned around, eyes scanning each shadow. Nothing stirred. But the whistling continued. Closer now…

I tripped over a log. And then the whistling stopped. Just silence. Then a child’s voice called out. It was all so surreal. I thought I was dreaming — until it returned. Faint, distant, but surely real.

"Hello? Hello? Mister?"

I looked around. The woods were empty. At least, they seemed to be. 

"Hey, mister! Want to make a fire?"

Again, the voice was closer.

I froze. Trying to will myself invisible. Nothing moved. Then came the sound of sticks snapping under someone’s foot. 

"Please? We can show you how. Wally says we’re really good at it now."

The voice was childlike, but strange. Like an old record someone had played too many times. Worn down. Edges warped.

I kept scanning the area, trying to locate the source. The trees seemed to be shifting, or maybe just my brain was. 

But the next second, I saw it. A fire, burning perfectly in a clearing about twenty yards away. And seated around it: six children.

All in old-fashioned scout uniforms. Their faces blackened. Their bodies completely still.

And at the center of it all stood Wally. 

His ranger outfit charred and covered in ash. His flesh looked… wrong. Like someone had put on a costume made of human skin, but hadn’t zipped it up properly. Jaw hanging way too open. 

He was holding a stick with a flaming marshmallow and he smiled when he saw me.

“Don’t be shy,” he said, voice warped with static. “There’s room for one more.”

I backed away. The children all turned in unison, heads slowly twisting like gears in a clock. Their eyes reflected nothing.

“Don’t you wanna learn?” Wally asked. “Don’t you wanna do it right?”

One of the kids raised their hand. “Show him,” she said.

And then, like choreographed dance, the six children began to mimic building a fire. In eerie harmony, they chanted instructions:

“Clear the ground. Stack the kindling. Circle the ring with stones.”

Their hands moved precisely, in a dance they’d done a hundred times.

“Light it. Feed it. Watch it grow.”

They smiled. Too wide.

“Never forget the water,” said one. “We forgot.”

“I said I was sorry,” whispered another.

“I said I was sorry!” they all shouted together.

The fire surged higher. Wally tilted his head, like he was admiring his little campers.

Then he looked at me.

“You can’t leave,” he said. “Not until you learn: Light it… Feed it… Watch it grow.”

I turned and ran.

Branches whipped at my face. Roots clawed my boots. I didn’t care.

Behind me, the voices kept calling.

“Light it. Feed it. Watch it grow. Light it. Feed it—”

I ran until I couldn’t hear them anymore. Until I collapsed. Wheezing, heart drumming.

I’d made it to the road. 

The woods were silent again. But the air still smelled like smoke.

I never went back.

Black Hollow is closed now. Last week, a “controlled burn” swept through the area I’d been in. At least that’s what the article said. I wonder if anything survived. If that’s the end of it.  

But I still dream of Wally.

And at night, sometimes when I’m just falling asleep, I can still hear it. 

“Light it.” 

“Feed it.” 

“Watch it grow.”
