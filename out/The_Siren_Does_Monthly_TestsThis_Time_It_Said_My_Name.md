I don't expect people to believe what I'm about to write, but I might as well let it all out, because otherwise, this will eat me up inside. So, here we go.

So every first Wednesday of every month, there is a siren, a very loud siren that plays very early in the morning, sorta of like if you live on an airbase, they do the national anthem every morning at a specific time. This is normal for where I live, at least I thought so.

It was the first Wednesday of May, and at around 2:17 a.m, the tornado siren said my full name: "**Ellis Jonathan M."** This time it was civilized, predictable. The pitch was wrong; instead of a hot knife through blue sky, it throbbed up through the floorboards.

**Larkspur & 39th. Go now. Don't call anyone. Bring a jacket.**

What the hell? Did it? Did it just tell me something to do? "Who the hell is this?" I said to an empty room.

**Larkspur & 39th. Go now. Don't call anyone. Bring a jacket.**

Seems as though it's on a loop... If I don't go, it'll just end up repeating it all night, and I'd rather not blow my brains out..So I decided to go.

The trestle at Larkspur & 39th holds a rectangle of bad shadow even at noon. At 2 a.m., it looks like an open mouth. As I continued walking the path, that's when I saw it. A minivan had jumped the guardrail and nosed into concrete, hazard lights blinking like it was trying to keep its eyes open.

"HEY! HEY!" I shouted, already sprinting. "Can you hear me?!"

A woman in the driver's seat had blood in her hair. The kid in the car seat coughed thin and wet. The smell hit me like a brick wall: sweet radiator-fluid reek, and something like pennies warmed in a fist.

"Ma'am? I'm here," I said, knocking out the rest of the passenger window with my jacket wrapped around my hand. "I'm Ellis. I'm not a doctor. I'm going to help you, little one breathe, okay?"

She said, thick and confused, "Where's... where-"

"Right here. Stay withmee" I slid in, cleared glass, tilted the kid's chin. "Hey, buddy. Look at me. Can you cough?" The kid coughs, "That's good. That's good." I dialed 911 with my shoulder.

"**911, what's your emergency?"**

"Yes! A minivan under the trestle at Larkspur & 39th," I said. "Two occupants. Both breathing. Driver has head trauma, possible."

**"Are you in immediate danger?"**

"Only from my own adrenaline," The kid coughed again. "I've cleared the airway. They need you now!"

"**Units en route. Stay on the line."**

"I have two hands," I said. "I need both." I dropped the phone to speaker and did what two hands and adrenaline can do. When the ambulance lights hit the trestle, it looked like a cheap disco light show.

An EMT said, "You did well."

"Say it louder," I tried to joke, and failed. A cop took my statement. "Name?" He said, grabbing his pen and small notebook. "Ellis March."

"Time you arrived?" I check my phone. "2:27 a.m., 14% battery."

He tapped his pen, scratching his head. "We had a call three minutes before you. Same location. From the payphone behind Fox & Finch Market on Rock Street."

What? That doesn't make sense.. How the hell.. "But that payphone's dead," I said. "It's BEEN dead since I was twelve!"

The cop shrugged. "Guess it's alive enough to dial 911."

Or something else is.

I walk back to my apartment, as I'm walking up the stairs, I check my phone to see my recording app, see if anyone came b. It showed a flat line between 2:16 and 2:18. Not static. Not the fan. Padded silence.

Weird.. there's usually some sorta of static noise coming from the camera..and nothing between those 2 minutes. I open my door and crash on my couch. I start to feel tired. As I begin to slowly close my eyes. I hear static.

The weather radio on my fridge, a dusty red Midland WR120 I got from dad, clicked on by itself and ratcheted the volume up one notch at a time like a polite ghost.

**Do not sleep in your bed tonight.**

"Why? Who the hell are you?" I asked because I've somehow turned to bargaining with appliances, like it will talk back to me.

**Do not sleep in your bed tonight.**

A part of me just wants to smash this damn radio to pieces, but another part of me knows that if I do and I go to bed in my bed.,something will happen.. something that I will not like. "Fine.." I muttered, falling onto my couch, closing my eyes, drifting off into the land of sleep.

3:03 a.m. I hear my bedroom closet door easing open. A soft, padded sund, like fingers on fabric. Something dragged the slats once. Twice. I whispered, "No.. hell no," to the dark, slamming my eyes shut.

In the morning, I burst my eyes open and immediately got up and looked in my closet, it had four parallel gouges at shoulder height, 9-10 inches long. Drywall dust sifted on the floor.

I called my landlord. "I think their mice in my room," I said.

"Mice?" he said. "Mice with crowbars?" He joked. "Dude, no! Can you just do something about this, please?" I plead, already feeling uncomfortable being in my apartment.

"I'll put in a work order," he said, then, quieter, "You okay, Ellis?"

"Define okay.. Just put that work order in, please." I hang up.

The radio clicked on again.

**You did well. Thank you.**

"Alright, that's it!" I speed walk to grab the damn radio and shake i. t "I'm not asking again.. WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?!" I yelled at the radio

**We are monitoring or cascading events.**

"What? What are you, the government?"

**We monitor cascading events.**

"Am I in danger?"

**Where you live is in danger if certain switches flip.**

"What do you want from me?"

**We would like to keep you, Ellis.**

"Keep me... the fuck does that mean?!"

The radio turned off..

Silence.

*END OF PART 1*

*PART 2*

It was hard to sleep that night; all I could think about was that damn radio. Keep me? I didn't understand it in the slightest. I'm just a normal dude who works a 9 to 5 job.. The hell does the siren want to keep me? Sunday morning, right as the church bells started, the radio spoke once again.

**Keep Mrs. Donocan home from the Fall fest. She puts out the paper plates. It matters that she is not there.**

"Hey! HEY!! RADIO!" I yelled at it, trying to get it to speak. Silence yet again. "Damn it..fuck.." I muttered under my breath. I walked four doors down and knocked. She opened in slippers and a cardigan.

"Kiddo!" she said. She calls everyone kiddo, guess that's the perk of being an elderly woman. "You look peaky. Come in, I have lemon bars."

I walk into the room and it's pretty much as I expected.. Small plants darted around the place, nice pictures of her and her husband. I sometimes see them going out together before I leave for work. They look happy. "So..I smelled gas by the church," I said. "On my run." I do not run. "Maintenance was calling it in when I went by."

Her face folded. "Oh, heavens. My Micah says you can't mess with leaks. I'll stay put."

"You sure you don't want me to-"

"I'll stay," she said, firm. Then softer: "Thank you, kiddo."

"It's Ellis," I said, because saying it felt like an anchor. "Ellis," she repeated, smiling like the word tasted good. I opened the door to leave, she waved bye as I waved back, and walked towards my apartment. I sit down on my couch, awaiting whatever it is that's gonna happen at the church, so I decided to turn the TV on and wait.

An hour flies by, my knee jerks up and down, anxiously waiting for something ANYTHING to happen. Suddenly, the TV automatically goes from what I was watching, and it turns into a news station.

"BREAKING NEWS! An inflatable bounce house deflated at Church Fest; Only 6 children were injured, nothing major. All stable...why is my life boring-" I turn the TV off, cutting the news reporter off.

**Thank you**, the radio said. I open the front door to see that Mrs. Donovan left lemon bars on my doormat with a note: *Thanks for looking out, kiddo.* \-Mrs. Dono. I ate two at the sink and felt worse. How is this happening? How does it know what's to come?

The requests kept coming. Small, weirdly specific.

**Text your boss you're sick on the 12th. Turn off the breaker to your porch at 8:49 p.m. Tuesday. Put your spare house key inside the cowboy boot in your hall closet. Tell the kid on the red bike not to cut through the construction site.**

And I did them, the results showed up like bullets. No porch fire in the storm. The kid kept both collarbones. MACHINE #6 EATS QUARTERS went up at the laundromat, and a stranger didn't lose ten bucks.

I didn't do the cowboot one, just to see what would happen if I didn't do what the radio told me. Next thing I knew, the world punished me. A week later, my lock jammed at 1:11 a.m. And I woke my neighbor with hammering I hated myself for.

I went to work on the 12th anyway, even though I knew something might happen, but nothing REALLY bad..right? At 11:19 a.m., a ceiling tile dropped and missed my ear by two inches.

"Holy!- are you okay?" Teresa from accounting asked.

"Y-Yea.. I think," I said, hands shaking, arms heavy.

"You should go home, take a day," she said. "Yeah, I should," I said, grabbing my things and driving back home. I can't take this anymore..

The moment I walk in the door, the radio gets bold..REAL BOLD

**First Wednesday. Noon. Siren E-13, behind your old elementary school. We will ask for two. Bring someone who trusts you.**

"No...no no HELL no!"

**We will ask again.**

"SON OF A BITCH! FUCK!" I grabbed my phone and texted my sister. If I didn't do this me my sister or I might die, so what other choice do I have?

Me: You doing okay?

Phoebe: Ah! Look who remembered he has a sister, lol. I'm fine. You?

Me: I'm fine, I just uh.. just wanted to check in. That's all, hope you're doing well.

Phoebe: I'm.. Doing fine? You on drugs or something? Since when in our family do we check in? lol

I chukled at the text. Then my smile quickly faded away at what I'm about to ask of her. I can't do it..I couldn't do it. Sure me my sister and I don't really talk much, but she's family, I can't do this to my family..to hell with this radio! I put my phone in my pocket and left for school.

I didn't bring her, I didn't bring anyone. I should've paid attention to the number. The world had already decided to count by twos; I just hadn't noticed who was being paried.

*END OF PART 2*

*PART 3*

It was 11:57 a.m. I stood at the base of the pole we used to call Trumpet Tree with a lock cutter sweating in my palm. I was scared..I don't know what's gonna happen since I didn't bring anyone.

11:59, a crossing guard walked past with her vest over one shoulder. Her terrier, Buttons, stiff-legged the leash.

She squinted. "Hey, you okay?"

"Yeah," I said, the sharp kind of yeah that means no. Her eyes went from me to the siren. Something unlocked in her face. "My daughter said your name," she said. "On the siren. Early. Yours and then hers. She thought it was a prank. Is this a prank?"

That's.. new "I don't think so." Is the siren calling out to someone else other than me? This thing is getting ballsy. Above us. The hirns rotated a fraction, like a flower following the sun.

I looked the the guard, opening my mouth to say *Leave.*

Then it was too late.. It hit noon.

The wail wasn't the test tone. Same climb and dip. But words braided under it like silt in a river. I heard my name. I heard the guard's name.

Only my mother ever said "Ellie," usually in the kitchen, cutting grapes the long way like I was still five: "Ellie, taste this first." Seven years gone, and I still reach for the wrong light switch in her house in my head. Hearing it from a pole made of horns felt like someone opened that old fridge inside my skull and let the light out.

"**Ellie**"

Buttong sat and keened. The guard flinched. I grabbed the pole like a drowning person grabs anything. Another voice, the radio voice, was suddenly behind my teeth.

**It won't take one. It has to be two to reset the count.**

"Take this," I yelled, shoving the lock cutter toward the guard, saying the most useless word, "RUN!" She ran. The dog went with her, nails skittering.

I also ran away from the tree, scared of looking behind me. I just kept running. Then the tone finished. The day wobbled. The sky stretched itself like a picture frame someone bumped. The grass did that silver flip it does when a storm thinks about it. On the walk home, traffic moved with a half-second delay.

At my door, my key was already in my hand. I don't remember taking it out.

Then little things stayed wrong.

In my bathroom mirror, if I lift my hand slowly, my reflection lifts half a blink after me. Move fast, and it snaps to catch up like a rubber band.

My phone recordings skip if I try to play them on that day. The weather radio flashes 12:00 whenever the power hiccups and refuses to be set forward. The microwave light hums for half a second after I open the door.

The neighborhood changed, too. People cross the street to avoid the siren without looking up. The crossing guard moved routes. Mrs. Donovan started locking her screen door even when she's home. Everything's so weird now ever since that night at the school.. It's the siren's doing, surely right?

Two days later, my neighbor was hauling in a flat of water jugs. I open my door slightly, "Need a hand?" I asked, he nodded, and I closed my door to put on my shoes.

The radio clicked on from my kitchen.

**Do not help.**

I froze.

"No thanks, I'm good, thanks for asking though!" My neighbor said to the door, then slipped and cracked his eyebrow on his own doorknob. He laughed it off, hand to his head. "Ouch.. my fault! I'm fine." He closes his door.

Inside, I walked up to the radio, "You're making me a bad neighbor, you fuck."

**We asked again. We will have to ask someone else if you do not bring someone who trusts you.**

"Ask me!" I yelled. "Just me! Don't bring anyone else I care about into whatever bullshit you're making me do! You hear me!?" I said.

**We will ask again.**

I think... I understand what **we** means now. Not angels. Not the government. Not demons. **We** the part of the world that wants to tidy the graph and make mistakes in math or mercy.

Like if a staircase is missing two steps, you don't replace the steps... You make people fall every Wednesday until the numbers balance.

*END OF PART 3*

*FINAL PART*

First Wednesday is almost here. Noon.

I don't know what the siren will ask. I don't know if there's anything left to give that isn't a person.

You're going to tell me to call the city. I did. You'll tell me to record it. I have neat holes in my phone's history and a mirror that lags.

You'll ask why I went to Larkspur & 39th at 2:17 a.m. Because when a machine says your name the way only your mother used to, some stupid part of you believes there's a list you can bargain your way off of.

If anyone in this town hears their name at noon. Don't stand under the horns.

I'm not being noble. I think that's what it wants... turning us into a chain, each of us pulling the next person under until the count resets to wherever it was before we noticed.

The radio just clicked on while I typed that.

**We will have to ask someone else.**

"No," I told it.

**We will ask again.**

"I'll be there."

**Bring someone who trusts you.**

"NO!" I said.

**We will ask again.**

I'm going before noon on Wednesday. Alone. If the siren wants two, let it starve. Or let it take me twice. If there's a third option, I'm too tired to find it.

If I don't write again, don't go hunting for recordings. You'll only find the gap where they should be and the way your own name sounds when you think about machines that shouldn't know it.

When the horns turn toward you, keep walking

*THE END*
