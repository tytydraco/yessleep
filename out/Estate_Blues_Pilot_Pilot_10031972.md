Okay, so I have this urge to post this here. I' not sure what else to do. It just feels like i have to, or something bad will happen to me. Okay, so a few days ago, I was rummaging through my friend's attic when I stumbled upon a pile of paper. I picked them up and noticed that they were the pages of a screenplay. I had no idea why my friend would have these, especially since he wasn't a huge reader, and these pages looked old. Like they had dust and shit all over them. They were in pretty shit shape. 

 

My friend had gone missing a few days ago, and I had been searching his house for any clues as to what had happened. I thought that this screenplay might be connected to his disappearance, weird connection, I know...I just had a weird feeling about it. I had to find out what it was all about. 

 

So I brought the pages back home to my apartment and layer them out across a desk I have in my bedroom. The air felt weird, like a strange chill had passed over the room. I wasn't sure what had come over me, but suddenly, I felt this desire and need to read these pages. So I picked up the pages and began to read through them. As I read through them, I noticed a strange chill come over me, and my body went numb. 

 

I didn't much care for this feeling, but I kept reading anyway. It was one of the stranger things I've ever read, and I've read some weird ass shit. This manuscript was the pilot to some TV show made in the 70s called "Estate Blues." I'm not really sure what the show was supposed to be about, but it wasn't like any show I've ever seen or heard of. It's sort of like a Lovecraftian horror show. 

 

Anyways, as I put down the pages a few hours ago and lay in bed now, I feel this strange need to post them here. I really can't explain it, but I felt like if I don't, some strange darkness will overtake my life. 

 

I don't think reading the pages will do anybody any harm, so I'm sure it's not a big deal. Plus, if anybody has heard of this show before, maybe they can clue me in on it. 

 

Enough of my rambling. Here's the manuscript:

 

Estate Blues Pilot. "Pilot" 10/03/1972

 

FADE IN:

 

 

EXT. MANSION - DAY

 

 

SUSAN, a middle-aged woman walks out to the large, worn down mansion.

 

 

SUSAN

 

Ah, home sweet home.

 

 

INT. MANSION - DAY

 

 

SUSAN walks in to find her butler, LARS.

 

 

LARS

 

Welcome back, Ma'am.

 

 

SUSAN

 

Thank you, Larson. 

 

 

LARS

 

Quite alright, Ma'am. 

 

 

SUSAN

 

So where are the kids?

 

 

LARS

 

Ah, they're all in the living room discussing their plans for the evening. 

 

 

SUSAN

 

Good.

 

 

They walk in to find a group of four teenagers.

 

 

SUSAN

 

(to children)

 

So, what have we been up to? 

 

 

(The children narrow their eyes before looking over at Lars.)

 

 

LARS

 

They've all been reading the lost screenplay. 

 

 

SUSAN

 

The one from the attic?

 

 

LARS

 

Yes, Ma'am. 

 

 

SUSAN

 

Why are they reading it? 

 

 

LARS

 

It has the power to drive one mad, Ma'am.

 

 

SUSAN

 

That isn't something you should be encouraging.

 

 

LARS

 

I'm afraid it is too late. 

 

 

The children, with solemn expressions, all turn to face the audience. 

 

 

CHILDREN

 

You must stop while you still can…

 

 

FADE TO BLACK.

 

 

EXT. - DAY

 

 

We hear a voiceover of Susan's voice.

 

 

SUSAN (V.O.)

 

I know the warnings, but the screenplay must be finished. 

 

 

We fade in to find Susan, Lars, and the children all gathered around the living room discussing the screenplay. 

 

 

SUSAN

 

We must keep going. 

 

 

LARS

 

It will slowly draw you to darkness. 

 

 

SUSAN

 

That is a risk I'm willing to take. 

 

 

CHILDREN

 

You cannot escape it. 

 

 

You see Susan and the children continue discussing the screenplay. As you read, the screenplay slowly begins to change, becoming more confusing and dark with each page. 

 

 

SUSAN

 

The play.

 

 

CHILDREN

 

Must not be.

 

 

SUSAN

 

Don't.

 

 

CHILDREN

 

Cannot stop them.

 

 

SUSAN

 

Their room.

 

 

CHILDREN

 

It changes.

 

 

SUSAN

 

Their mind.

 

 

CHILDREN

 

It breaks.

 

 

SUSAN

 

Their life. 

 

 

CHILDREN

 

Is ours.

 

 

But as the reader continues to read on, the screenplay changes again. 

 

 

You continue reading the screenplay, these words are flowing through your mind. You are lost. You are alone. You are afraid. You hear a strange noise from behind you.

 

 

READER

 

What is going on?

 

 

The lights start to flicker and your screen starts to grow dimmer. Your thoughts are fading you. You are obsessed with finishing the screenplay.

 

 

READER

 

I have to know how it ends.

 

 

You read on, the words seemingly generating endlessly as you continue to read. 

 

 

SUSAN

 

You must.

 

 

CHILDREN

 

Listen.

 

 

LARS

 

Finish.

 

 

READER

 

Yes.

 

 

Images of the reader slowly going mad start to appear in their mind. The reader sits motionless, their mind gone, their curse endless.

 

 

FADE TO BLACK

 

 

FADE IN: 

 

 

The reader sits motionless at their computer, their blank stare focused on the creepy-pasta website.

 

 

The reader sits in front of their computer and stares at the screen. All they can hear is the wind and the eerie typing coming from their keyboard as they write. Their thoughts have been consumed by the cursed screenplay.

 

 

Suddenly, their bedroom lights turn off, the only light coming from the dimly-lit computer screen. 

 

 

CHILDREN

 

Beware. Do not reach the end. Turn away now. 

 

 

SUSAN

 

Do not continue. Your mind will break. 

 

The reader can now feel their sanity slipping away. 

 

 

LARS

 

It will never end. 

 

The reader keeps on writing, the words flowing from their typing. The reader stares straight ahead, their mind consumed by the screenplay. The script unfinished, it must be completed. 

 

 

FADE TO BLACK 

 

 

EXT. DARKNESS — DAY

 

 

We see the reader’s body, motionless, as they sit in front of the computer, their mind gone, their fingers still typing. 

 

 

FADE TO BLACK.



Ever since reading it, I've had strange things happening. I've seen things like shadows darting around the room out of the corner of my eye, and randomly, I'll hear what sounds like muffled talking coming from the kitchen in my apartment. I know that's not possible, it's probably just in my head. I don't know it's just a lack of sleep, of my mind playing tricks on me or what. I just have a bad vibe about it all. And the weird need to post it here. I just don't know.

I don't think anything bad will come of it. It was just a manuscript, and I'm sure posting it here won't curse anybody or anything lmfao. And hey, seriously, if anybody has heard of the show before, please let me know in the comments.
