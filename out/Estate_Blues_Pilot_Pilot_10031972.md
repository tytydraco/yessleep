FADE IN:


EXT. MANSION - DAY


SUSAN, a middle-aged woman walks out to the large, worn down mansion.


SUSAN

Ah, home sweet home.


INT. MANSION - DAY


SUSAN walks in to find her butler, LARS.


LARS

Welcome back, Ma'am.


SUSAN

Thank you, Larson. 


LARS

Quite alright, Ma'am. 


SUSAN

So where are the kids?


LARS

Ah, they're all in the living room discussing their plans for the evening. 


SUSAN

Good.


They walk in to find a group of four teenagers.


SUSAN

(to children)

So, what have we been up to? 


(The children narrow their eyes before looking over at Lars.)


LARS

They've all been reading the lost screenplay. 


SUSAN

The one from the attic?


LARS

Yes, Ma'am. 


SUSAN

Why are they reading it? 


LARS

It has the power to drive one mad, Ma'am.


SUSAN

That isn't something you should be encouraging.


LARS

I'm afraid it is too late. 


The children, with solemn expressions, all turn to face the audience. 


CHILDREN

You must stop while you still can…


FADE TO BLACK.


EXT. - DAY


We hear a voiceover of Susan's voice.


SUSAN (V.O.)

I know the warnings, but the screenplay must be finished. 


We fade in to find Susan, Lars, and the children all gathered around the living room discussing the screenplay. 


SUSAN

We must keep going. 


LARS

It will slowly draw you to darkness. 


SUSAN

That is a risk I'm willing to take. 


CHILDREN

You cannot escape it. 


You see Susan and the children continue discussing the screenplay. As you read, the screenplay slowly begins to change, becoming more confusing and dark with each page. 


SUSAN

The play.


CHILDREN

Must not be.


SUSAN

Don't.


CHILDREN

Cannot stop them.


SUSAN

Their room.


CHILDREN

It changes.


SUSAN

Their mind.


CHILDREN

It breaks.


SUSAN

Their life. 


CHILDREN

Is ours.


But as the reader continues to read on, the screenplay changes again. 


You continue reading the screenplay, these words are flowing through your mind. You are lost. You are alone. You are afraid. You hear a strange noise from behind you.


READER

What is going on?


The lights start to flicker and your screen starts to grow dimmer. Your thoughts are fading you. You are obsessed with finishing the screenplay.


READER

I have to know how it ends.


You read on, the words seemingly generating endlessly as you continue to read. 


SUSAN

You must.


CHILDREN

Listen.


LARS

Finish.


READER

Yes.


Images of the reader slowly going mad start to appear in their mind. The reader sits motionless, their mind gone, their curse endless.


FADE TO BLACK


FADE IN: 


The reader sits motionless at their computer, their blank stare focused on the creepy-pasta website.


The reader sits in front of their computer and stares at the screen. All they can hear is the wind and the eerie typing coming from their keyboard as they write. Their thoughts have been consumed by the cursed screenplay.


Suddenly, their bedroom lights turn off, the only light coming from the dimly-lit computer screen. 


CHILDREN

Beware. Do not reach the end. Turn away now. 


SUSAN

Do not continue. Your mind will break. 

The reader can now feel their sanity slipping away. 


LARS

It will never end. 

The reader keeps on writing, the words flowing from their typing. The reader stares straight ahead, their mind consumed by the screenplay. The script unfinished, it must be completed. 


FADE TO BLACK 


EXT. DARKNESS — DAY


We see the reader’s body, motionless, as they sit in front of the computer, their mind gone, their fingers still typing. 


FADE TO BLACK.
