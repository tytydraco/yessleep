Lisa Sanchez followed the led line on the floor that lead her to her next assignment. She worked in a big government facility that did big government work. She didn't understand it in the slightest. Her assignments were simple. Follow the little LED on the floor, clean the room that it stops in. Start at the top work downward, When she was done press a button on the wall and the LED will flash excitedly before ferrying off to the next assignment. 

She didn't understand why they were called assignments. She was a janitor, not even a custodian. There wasn't much point in flowering the titles up, but government work with government terms meant Lisa was the new "sanitation specialist" to be taking over for Frank. 

I'm Frank, an older guy. Tall and lanky with a bit of scraggle, looking forward to my retirement. I've worked as a janitor at this underground facility near NORAD for 25 years, and I'm ready to enjoy my pension and my free time. I love my job, but I'm old and want to spend more time with family and my surviving friends. I have a wife, two kids, and a grandkid living in Denver, who I missed, and who's lives I looked forward to invading. I had gotten the government job to secure a decent retirement for myself, but I've  never been a fan of the 3 weeks on 1 week off schedule. I never let it affect my mood toward my coworkers, but It takes a toll being underground, surrounded by all white walls, and sterile florescent light with equally sterile stainless surfaces everywhere you looked. The architect in charge must have also worked for the prison system, because the designs and colors weren't all that dissimilar. I'm ready to be done.

I was singing, busily mopping a room filled with buzzing scientists, only a couple of which half heatedly hummed along, and equipment that barely interested me by now when my thoughts were jarred back to reality by a brush from Rex. Rex was my German shepherd. A loyal companion for 4 years. He was my service dog for my epilepsy, predominantly for alerting me of an oncoming seizure and staying by my side during one. Rex was also allowed to accompany me to work, as as a service animal, and I was grateful for that. Not only was Rex good to have around for his stated medical training. He was also well loved by the entire facility, and really added to my "happy janitor" aura. 

"What's up Rex?" I asked stooping to pet the dog.

Rex whined long and ended in two short yips. I knew the signal, and groaned. I wasn't excited for what I knew was about to come. No avoiding biology, he had to pee. I trained Rex to let me know in advance when nature called. Being in an underground facility means a German shepherd can't just go out the doggy door. There's only one exit, and it's a reasonably large facility. We were going for a walk. 

I pushed a button on Rex's collar and the LED responded by wandering to the door of the room we stood in. I said my goodbyes, my I'll be right backs, and my "I'll catch some sun for ya"s. We began the trek through the maze like facility. It had been intentionally designed to look the same no matter where you were. The doors were all the same palid white, and It had odd dead ends, and switchbacks, making it quite unnavigable. Rumor was some bigwigs at the CIA managed an architecture that is impossible to memorize, and I believed it, but there was more to it. Rooms would also move or be rearranged and traded. And the walls all curved like the facility was concentric circles that rotated independently of one another. After 25 years I still couldn't so much as find the bathroom without a button and an LED leading the way.  

On our way out the facility we passed several scientists, guards and suits following their own dots. I waved, and made pleasant conversation. Letting some suits stop to pet Rex who, predictably, hammed it up and rolled over with his tongue hanging out. Our dots patiently waited as I told them a joke about a man in an empty bar receiving accolades from seemingly nowhere. He asked the bartender who in the empty bar was so impressed by his suit. The bartender replied, the peanuts... They're complimentary. They laughed, and we said our goodbyes. Our dots carried on as we started after them. 

I had made many friends at the facility over the years, and knew everyone by name. Everyone knew me come to think of it. I've just always found self satisfaction to be contagious. The facility allowed for no electronics so I sang aloud in the halls and labs, and I was a decent singer, and knew my crowd. In one room of scientists I'd sing Dolly Parton to get all of the scientist and government suits in a good mood. Other labs have a younger crowd, so Bruno Mars would be the artist of the day. Some labs were filled with immigrant doctors who had no familiarity with American music. So I had them teach me Bollywood, and folk songs, and they would sing along aloud with me. I liked them best. Most of the other rooms won't sing along, but I always have some hummers. My thoughts were interrupted by a retenal scan. The man door to the facility opened. Most the time unless I get the right suit in the right mood I don't get to open the big one. 

We arrived outside and Rex did his thing. I admired the clear October sky. Musing at the fact that my 4 legged companion was the only reason I saw it regularly. I wished I could smoke on the facility, but they got rid of that in the 90s, so I had to kick it. Somehow the craving never went away. We headed back into the facility where I pushed the collar again and my dot responded in kind by marching off back to my assignment. 

After all this time I didn't know much about what the facility did, but I always assumed it was something important and noble. I had heard rumors that they worked on disease outbreak prevention, and thought that was admirable. I didn't ask too many questions though, as I respected the secrecy and security of the place. Still being there 25 years you learn what equipment is and roughly what most of it does. We had medical equipment, and testing apperatuses that would make most hospitals jealous. State of the art MRI machines, CT scanners, X rays and EEGs, centrifuges and all types of microscopes. Those burning rooms where they analyze what's in stuff based off of the colors of light coming off of it. It was obvious we did work with desiese. 

I did my usual rounds of cleaning, making sure everything was spotless, sterile and in order. I enjoyed my work, as I felt it was meaningful and satisfying. I liked to keep things neat and tidy, and I took pride in my job, and deep satisfaction in the fact that it was finally done. 

On my way out I decided I couldn't leave without saying goodbye to One more person in particular. They hadn't made it to see my in the last few days. One of my favorite people to talk to was Dr. Lee. Lee was a tenured and brilliant biologist who worked on the top-secret project that was the core of the facility's mission. I wasn't sure, but I believed Lee to be at the top of the scientist hierarchy. People seemed to revere him, and his expertise. I didn't know what that expertise was exactly. I assumed the Doctor made desiese resistant crops, but that was just what I had pieced together.  Dr. Lee was always kind and respectful to me, and he would often explain some of the basics of his work to me in simple terms. I knew he did genetic work, and could tell Lee respected robustness. He aimed to implant it into everything he worked on. But beyond that the secrecy of the place, and the heavy limits of my experience in the field made the doctors work indestinguishable from voodoo and witchcraft. 

"Hey Frank, how are you today?" Dr. Lee greeted me as I entered his lab.

"Hi Dr. Lee, I'm doing great, thanks. How about you?" I replied.

"I'm good too, thanks. I'm glad to see you're in a good mood." Dr. Lee said.

"Well, it's my last day here, you know." I chided.

"Really? Wow, congratulations! That snuck up on me. You excited?" 

"I am indeed. I'm looking forward to my retirement." 

"That's wonderful. You deserve it after all these years of hard work." 

"Thank you very much." 

"So what are your plans for retirement?" Dr. Lee asked.

"Well, you know the clice I want to spend more time with my family maybe build a boat."

Dr. Lee laughed "That sounds awesome. I'll call you captain."

"Who says you're invited on it? I jabbed, but yeah, I miss the kids a lot."

"I bet they miss you too." Dr. Lee reassured me.

"I hope so. Darla is just getting to the point where her kid wants nothing to do with her, so she's been calling more. "

"She's calling because she has the time now. Not just because she's lonely" Dr. Lee stated matter of factly.

"Thank you for saying that." I rolled my eyes sarcastically. 

"You're welcome for saying that. Does that mean I can come on the boat?" Dr. Lee smiled.

I laughed "I haven't built it yet, but when I'm done I'll text you. So what are you working on today?"

"Oh, just the usual." Lee stated. The monitor behind him black. 

"Just the usual secrecy too, I see." I joked.

Dr. Lee chuckled nervously. I could tell I hit a nerve. 

"Yeah, just the usual secrecy." He said.

I sensed that Dr. Lee was uncomfortable talking about this work, and I didn't want to push him further. So I decided to politely break off the conversation and move on to his next task.

"Well, it was nice talking to you, Dr. Lee. I hope you have a great weekend." I said, pushing the button.

"Thank you, Frank. You too. And congratulations again on your retirement." Dr. Lee said.

"Thank you very much. Take care, Dr. Lee. Say aloha to Lorraine for me. Then tell her she's not allowed on the boat." I said.

The laugh that came out of Lee on my way out told me we were good. I was glad to end on a less sour note.

I left the lab and headed to the janitor's closet, where I met up with my replacement, a young woman named Lisa. She had been shadowing me for the past couple weeks, learning the ropes of the job.

"Hey Lisa, how are you doing?" I greeted her.

"Hi Frank, I'm doing good, thanks. How about you?" Lisa replied.

"I'm doing great, thanks. It's my last day here, you know." I chided.

"I know, I know. I'm so happy for you." Lisa rolled her eyes. I had been warning her I would be leaving her for 2 weeks. She was tired of hearing it, but still smiled when I said it. Thanking her. 

"Do you have any last tips or advice for me?" Lisa asked sarcastically.

"Smile and be friendly to everyone. They'll appreciate it, and you get bonus points for show tunes" I said.

She laughed "I guess it's my turn to be the happy old fogey. Thanks for the advice."

"You're welcome, Lisa." I ignored the comment. 'You'll probably need this" I said, handing her my exit card. I had been letting myself and Lisa out of the facility as the need arose, but I knew it would take a week or several for her to requisition one of her own. So I'd just ask Dr. Lee to let me out tonight for the last time. What could they do? Fire me for losing my old one?

We hugged each other and wished each other good luck and happiness.

"Goodbye, Lisa. It was nice working with you." I said.

"Goodbye, Frank. It was nice working with you too." Lisa said.

I exited the closet and reached the hallway and saw Rex waiting for me outside. He didn't fit in the closet with two people. Rex wagged his tail and barked happily when he saw me. I smiled and petted his head.

I pushed a button to take me to the gym on the facility. It was my last chance to let Rex meet up with the group of friends he'd made at the facility. His excercise buddies would be waiting for him one last time to play relentlessly with my dog. 

We got there and his typical group of friends were there. It was bittersweet seeing him have the time of his life with his long time companions. Mike especially had taken a liking to Rex, and he him. Mike was one of the on site soldiers, stationed here for security I assumed. He and Rex wrestled and chased one another till neither could breathe quite right. Today they just rough housed. Mike would put Rex in a headlock and Rex would wriggle away and evade him. Mike had gotten bitten a lot from this, but he didn't seem to much care. They had worn one another out and were laying on the floor aside one another. 

"He's gonna miss you" I admitted, offering Mike a hand up. He accepted. 

"Yeah, I'm not worried. I'm gonna see him when you finish that boat" he said hoisting himself upright. "Besides, the grandkids will keep him plenty busy."

I chuckled a little. A mental image of Darla's little ones burying Rex in our back yard flashed into mind. I couldn't wait to get to it. 

"Yeah, they're looking forward to it. I should probably head to my actual retirement party." I admitted, the thought occuring to me as I said it. 

"Oh? I wasn't invited" Mike feigned hurt.

"Neither was I, but you I bet ya 20 bucks Ethel has the whole fam damily at the house waiting to say surprise when I walk in."I smiled wryly at him.

He laughed, and nodded in agreement "wouldn't be your wife's surprise if it wasn't predictable"

It was my turn to nod in agreement "well, thanks for everything Mike. I'll call you when the boat is done" I waved to Mike as he packed his bag. I approached Rex, who was still on his back, tongue rolling out the side of his mouth. "Hey buddy, are you ready to go home?" I asked.

Rex barked again, rolling over, then standing up. 

"I'll take that as a yes." I laughed, and scratched his ears.

So there we were were walking towards the exit of the facility, when suddenly I heard a loud siren and a voice over the intercom.

"Attention, attention. This is an emergency. The facility is on lockdown. Please remain calm. Return to your labs. Do not attempt to leave the facility. This is not a drill. Repeat, this is not a drill."

I stopped in my tracks. My dot had dissapeared. Rex stopped after and looked at me as if to ask what was happening. I looked around, confused and alarmed, and saw other people running and panicking, trying to find a safe place to hide. I could hear doors slamming themselves shut and locks clicking, sealing off the sections of the facility.

"What's going on?" I asked aloud to no one.

Panic began to set in. This had not happened before. The system had no need to tell us this was not a drill. We had no drills. The facility was fire proof, secret, underground, fully self contained and self powered, flood proof and could resist a nuclear explosion. What drills could we have?

As I wondered I decided to try to find a safe spot or someone who could explain the situation, but everyone was too busy or scared to talk. People were running every which way, but I only saw them briefly from afar as they darted across the hallway I now occupied alone. I had no lab, so I'd just have to go back to my janitor's closet and wait there until the lockdown is over. I reasoned that I just came from there. So I should be able to get back without the LED. 

Deciding this was the best course of action I turned around and retraced my steps, calling Rex. but I soon realized that I had lost my way. The facility was huge and complex, and even though I was just at the closet, the facility did it's job of making me lost.

I felt the surge of panic return to me as the reality that I was trapped in a maze of corridors and rooms that I didn't know. I looked at Rex and saw that he was also nervous and confused.

"Don't worry, buddy. We'll find our way out." I said bending to pet him.

Rex yipped and whined softly and wagged his tail, trying to cheer me up.

I smiled and petted Rex's head.

"Good boy." I said.

I walked for what seemed like hours, but was probably minutes discovering the facility remarkably empty. I couldn't find anything that could help me. Just beakers and centrifuges as far as the eye can see. Which underground isn't too far. I started to feel tired and thirsty, and I wondered aloud how long the lockdown would last, and how long it would be before I found somebody. 

"Damn it's quiet." 

I turned a corner and saw a door that was slightly open. I saw inside a large room that looked like a laboratory. I saw the familiar tables, chairs, computers, monitors, wires, tubes, machines, and other equipment that was common to most of the facility. But I also saw something else that made my blood run cold. 

A large glass tank that contained an eight foot man sat at the back of the room. It was floating in some kind of liquid, attached to various wires and tubes. He had thick and rippled pale skin with a texture that reminded me of tanned leather. It was stretched tightly over a hulking muscle bound frame that would make any pro wrestler jealous. Dark hair matted spun about in all directions with the flow of the mysterious liquid, its several feet of length proudly displaying the creature's long sentence in its test tube prison. It had eyes that were closed, but I could tell they were very large. I gazed down the naked form. This man was unlike anything I have ever seen. 

I felt a chill run down my spine as I looked at him. I wondered if he was a man at all. I wondered if it was alive or dead, asleep or awake.

I felt Rex tug on my shirt pulling me away from the hallway and the mysterious door.

"Come on buddy, let's go." I said to Rex. Heading back where we came from. 

I closed the door behind me and walked away from the room. I didn't want to see more of what was inside. I felt a mix of curiosity and fear, but I decided to ignore them. I wanted to know any more about that man in the test tube, but not nearly as bad as I wanted to retire. 

Rex came up under me, and put his head under my hand. I pet him absently, and he grabbed my hand in his mouth. 

My heart skipped a beat. "Not now boy, shit!" 

That was the signal. It was time to have a seizure. Thankfully I had a little time. Rex was a skilled service dog, and he normally gave me around a half hour of time to find a place. But this meant my search for asylum was much more dire. 

I saw Dr. Lee running towards me from the opposite direction.

"Dr. Lee!" I shouted.

"Frank!" Dr. Lee shouted back.

They met in the middle of the corridor and Lee grabbed me and pulled me running back toward the room I had just left. I decided not to ask what we were running from. As we went I made sure Rex was coming. He seemed nervous about what was behind us, and passed us quickly. 

Dr. Lee scanned a key card and got us into a lab, that housed mice. It was the breeding lab. The three of us piled in and Lee locked the door behind us. We leaned in unison on the cold steel, but were sent equally United away from the door when a loud banging erupted on the other side almost immediately. The reinforced steel plate that separated us, and God knows what showed no sign of fatigue, but I was still deeply unsettled by the inhuman noises assaulting my senses. 

I felt a tingle in my chin that spread rapidly over my body. Words failed me, and I slipped into black.
