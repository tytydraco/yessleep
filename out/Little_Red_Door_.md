Five five-year-olds not sleeping in cribs without adult supervision. 

That's how the hazy, terrifying ordeal began on Devil's Night in an after school daycare of dubious quality.

Five-year-olds do not normally sleep in cribs. 

They don't regularly nap after kindergarten.

They want to constantly explore and play and run around and scream.

Ms. White - I think her name was - didn't like noise or children. But she did like money. And booze I think. She didn't charge too much to imprison us for an hour until our parents could get off work and pick us up.

I hated daycare. We all did. We hated Ms. White too. She yelled really loud if we talked above a whisper. Climbing out of the cribs was also forbidden. I can't believe our parents left us there. Maybe they didn't know. Maybe they did and had no other choice. School let out at three in the afternoon. What full-time job ends at three?

We were stuck. The five of us basically stared at one another. John made funny faces once, and we all tried. That got us giggling. That's how we learned Ms. White was a yeller.

I'm not sure if the Devil's Night custom is anywhere else but Bridal Veil Lake and/or Ontario. So I'll explain: the day before Halloween - and the evening before - is referred to as Devil's Night. People, mostly teenagers, play pranks, throw eggs, toilet paper trees and houses, and generally get up to no good. That's the gist of it.

Some people, including my parents, took it a little more seriously. Newspapers had reported cats being taken and killed for ritualistic purposes. Not sure if it was true, but I came to regard the day with greater apprehension. I didn't want either of my cats to die. 

I'm not sure if my fear caused what happened, but it and the day itself served to etch the incident into memory.

The ticking of the ancient clock we couldn’t read marked the eternal seconds. Silence and misery and fear. What if my parents didn’t come on time? They always did, but what if a traffic jam happened and they couldn’t get me until night? Devil’s Night.

“Look,” Muzzan said. He stood up on his thin mattress, tall enough the railing stopped below his knees, and pointed to the painted concrete wall beneath the clock. A small red door had appeared. 

Trapped in this windowless room for months now, we knew the interior well. That door, shiny red, like an apple, had not been a part of it. 

“What is it?” Dixon asked. He wore an eyepatch bandaid, I don’t know why, and had trouble turning to see.

“It’s a door,” I said. Children point out the obvious honestly and without consideration for what is plainly in front of other’s eyes.

“Is it a real door?” Alison, a redhead with severe freckles, asked. 

“It’s a real door,” I confirmed without knowing anything about it. 

“Sh!” Arabella cautioned. She was the most scared of Ms. White. She’d been on the receiving end, the spittle point, of the old woman’s anger. “She’ll come in.”

“We should open it,” Dixon suggested. He didn’t wait for a consensus. Children don’t have that kind of patience. He climbed out of his crib and landed heavily on the rug, which absorbed much of the sound but released entombed dust. 

He sneezed immediately, and we stared in fear at the big door against the opposite wall. When it stayed shut and nothing but the babble of someone on TV continued, we all began our more careful descent.

“Don’t land on the rug,” I told everyone. “I’m the leader.”

No one argued. A cold draft emitted from around the edges of the red door, which didn’t seem to touch any part of the frame or have visible hinges at all. These details were unremarkable to a five-year-old, but I remember the sight vividly.

“Listen,” I said to the others. “There’s music.” It was hard to hear but true. It sounded like the electronic trill of a modern ice cream truck. We all knew that sound and began to get excited. 

I opened the little red door to another world, a dimly lit earthen floor and the cloying odors of ash and something foul we did not yet comprehend. The music continued. Despite the absence of any truck, we were sure it'd be ahead.

“I don't think we should go,” Arabella said.

With ice cream on the line, none of us listened. She followed at the back and fanned out onto a carpet of dead grass.

“It's gone!” Arabella shrieked immediately. “Look! Look!”

We did, and didn't understand what she meant. Object permanence became part of our cognitive toolset before age one. The belief in magic, however, would likely be around for at least another year. 

“It's okay,” I said. “I'm the leader, and I say the door is gone. But it will come back when my parents come to get me.” I did not know this as fact but had experienced countless nonsensical explanations from adults. The point of the words wasn't to make sense but to simply say a lot until everyone felt better or the relevant issue had been forgotten.

No one appeared to feel better in the midst of so many shadows. They moved like waves against aquarium glass, oily darkness pushing against the miniscule island, invisible against a starless sky.

The ice cream music stopped. We sensed the ruse. It showed in our glum expressions.

“Be not afraid,” a voice like vibrating static said from above and nowhere. It was not pleasant and we cowered in a hugging pile in the grass.

“Who's there?” I asked.

Seconds of dreadful silence elapsed before an answer from that horrible voice. “I am that I am, the counterpart to mercy, the one who knows the value of humans.”

This band of five-year-olds shared worried and befuddled expressions. 

“Oh,” I said. “Where's the ice cream?”

Dixon patted my shoulder and nodded. He approved of the question. I felt validated in nominating myself to lead. And then he dropped. Dead. Instantly dead. His visible eye saw nothing. He had no apparent cause of death. 

The four remaining children started to cry.

“Excellent,” the harsh voice concluded. “You only knew Dixon from inside that woman's cell. Yet you shed tears for him. I did not expect such an impact. Truly, young humans are the veal of my kind.”

Again, its words were lost on us.

But Dixon was dead. People that did bad things got in trouble.

“I'm going to tell on you,” I said.

“My dad's a police officer,” Muzzan shouted toward the ceiling or sky. He stopped crouching and wiped away the tears from his cheeks. “He's got a gun. He will shoot you.”

His defiant posture wilted under the sudden clearance above. A floating mask of tortured iron, barbed and burred, appeared as large as the island itself. Its eyes and nostrils and mouth contained a dark so dense it pulled the light from our eyes. We could not look at it for more than a few seconds, and we could not stop trying to see, to understand what it was.

We shivered, and clutched at one another, becoming a writhing mass digging for the bottom, hoping one among us would become the human shield.

“There is no conscious form of life,” it said, “that does not extract its existence from another life. The cows do not know they're meat. The bees think they make honey for themselves. And humans believe their purpose is a mystery, that they do not consistently make a product consumable by others. They are wrong.”

Somehow, I ended up on top of my friends. Dixon's dead eye searched for meaning. I couldn't express it that way then. I only knew his expression seemed sad. He wanted to know why. So did I.

“You're wrong,” I challenged it. “And, and, and Dixon's mom and dad will kill you when they come to pick him up.” The other kids tugged me down. I let them. I guess we felt safer in a pile.

“Human memory isn't so fixed,” it replied. The mouth did not move when it spoke, but heat, almost unbearable, came from nostrils obscured by a birdlike nose. Its image crudely resembled a human face. 

“You do not know your grandfather's name,” it went on, “and if you age, you likely never will except through direct effort. If it is an interest of yours. And even then you're not likely to know your great grandparents’ names and further back, it becomes more and more unlikely you will ever know who your ancestors were specifically. I can hasten this forgetting. Dixon's parents will forget they had a son.”

It talked so much. And it was scary. I hated its voice. “I don't know what you mean!” I shouted, angrily, on the verge of a nervous breakdown or a tantrum.

The mask remained immutable. “I will make you remember everything that happened here today, and as you grow, so too will your suffering for that is the one consistent product of humanity. Pain. They give it. They cause it. Out of nothing, they conjure it, even when all is well in their lives. That's what it is to be a human.”

A crack of lightning struck the island. I didn't see a thing. When I opened my eyes, the rest were all dead. Burnt and mutilated by whatever force the entity had conjured. I sobbed and begged for mommy.

The little red door appeared. My vision had been blurred by tears. I tripped and scrambled to find the handle, which turned out to be locked. I cried out some more, and it waited, and fed off my anguish until no more could be extracted.

Then it said, “Lo, when you are grown, you will become ripe for true suffering. Then you will see the door again, and walk through it willingly.”

The handle turned in my straining hands, and I fell forward, tumbling down through realities, and into my own body. 

“Wake up, little man.” My father's voice. I turned into his arms. He laboured to pick me up. “Whoa, been awhile since I got you from a crib. Come on. Got to get home before dark or we'll get egged.”

A dream. A nightmare. 

I might have been convinced if not for the four other empty cribs and the possessions of my friends left behind. Backpacks and water bottles. Enough familiar letters of Muzzan's name in sharpie on the top velcro strip of his shoe. Arabella's cotton candy tiger stuffy. Strands of Alison's red hair hung from my still trembling fingers.

Yet, no one ever mentioned them. When I did, it was attributed to the generally awful experience at the daycare. I did tell my parents about Ms. White and the little red door, but it was all attributed to not wanting to return to the old lady's house.

I never did. And after years and years of therapy and drugs and special programs, I came to believe what everyone told me: it never happened. Muzzan, Alison, Arabella, Dixon were not real people. 

Something else - probably at the hands of Ms. White, villainous daycare operator - had caused the convincing delusion.

Yet the prophecy or the curse of the iron mask entity proved to be true. The older I got, the more suffering I caused and experienced.

Only after I met my wife, Janet, did I begin to feel joy and hope again, and that was fairly late in life. Thirty-six and we were married. Thirty-seven and we had our first child, a boy, Neil, after her dad.

Sadly, the worry and anxiety I had over my son ruined much of the wonder and fulfillment commonly attached to raising a child. My memory of the little red door and what lived inside was too vivid. Oh god, what if it appeared outside Neil's crib someday?

I became obsessed with Neil's safety. I quit my job to be with him. I would not let him go to school at age four or five, especially five.

Janet grew worried too. Then she got scared. Then we divorced, and Neil stayed with her while I found a room in a basement apartment near the community college in Bridal Veil Lake. 

“The red door,” I begged her. “Don’t leave him alone.”

“Please, she begged me, “get help.”

And I tried. But nothing could penetrate the perfectly forged memory of the iron mask. I am that I am, and I truly believed that for a while, praying to it, pleading for relief.

I'm forty-four and it's Devil's Night. I just got off the phone with Janet a few hours ago. Neil wanted to paint the door to his room red.

“You didn’t let him,” I accused her.

“I did,” she replied. “I want him to know there's nothing to the delusion you've been feeding him.”

That hurt. I miss her. I love her. I suffer, and it feeds the beast. 

“Don’t leave him-”

I dropped my phone.

The little red door, as shiny as ever, appeared next to my bed, a mattress on the floor. None of its edges - the door that is - touched the frame. It floated. It does not have hinges. 

The ice cream music played, but I could not be so easily deceived. And so it ceased, to be replaced by a more familiar, far more devastating routine.

“Daddy? Daddy!”

My son. Neil. He is behind the door.

I'm sickened to admit I didn't rush in.

I wrote this first. A record I guess. A warning?

But to whom? Five-year-olds? 

They know not what they do, and they cannot be stopped.

I go now to spare my son, or at least, give him some [time](https://www.reddit.com/u/APCleriot/s/KR7AhhnBlx).
