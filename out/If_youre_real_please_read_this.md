This is real. Skimming trough the stories on here and having seen videos narrating the most popular ones, I know that 99,9% of the stories posted here are fake. And that this will probably reach an audience that maybe reads it, laughs at my amateur work and moves on. But I beg that someone who's real will read it. I hope. Or that I finally have closure that there's no one at all real but me.

If my assumptions are correct, this will fall on deaf ears anyways, so I'm not sure why I'm even doing this. If not, then I apologize for my writing. This is really just jumbled thoughts and English isn't my first language.

But let me explain. I mentioned that no one is real, right? Not in the way of dissociation. Been there done that, this isn't the same. This is not some mental issue (which I'll admit, I have my fair share of) but absolute reality. No one is real. I cannot feel their conscience. I look at them and they're like puppets. Even the ones I've grown close to, my family and friends. They're all made to act as if they're real, but they're not. If I ask them, they say they're real and sentient and all that bullshit, but I know they're not. Its useless to pretend otherwise. Expect no twist in this story. It's based on reality, or- my reality, the lonely and vacant one where I'm sure that it's not the actual reality. It's fake. It all is. I'm not sure what the real reality looks like, who I am in it, and I'm not sure I want to find out. What if this reality is a coping me chanism to deal with the real one? Then I'd rather stay in this blissful, sort of bad dream. It's not all too nice here, but on the chance that it's worse, I'm not sure I want to know the truth. Not like I can think of a way to snap out of it anyways. 

Anyways, that's the background. No one is real, the reality isn't real, I myself might not even be. But lately I've discovered something new. Ever since realizing this, I've realized more and more things. One of them and the major one being that if this reality is fake, it all revolves around me. Almost like in the Trueman show, where he's the main character and everyone flies into preplanned motion when he enters the room, acting out a life to make him believe it's real. Just that they're real people, only actors. My family and friends, I'm sure they act behind my back as well, but everyone else just doesn't. And the ones closest to me just do it to ensure I don't notice. Trueman breaks out eventually, he lives in just a small real where the show is being filmed. But I can't. Not when the whole damn reality is like this. Not when it's all I've ever known and maybe all I'll ever know. It's scary, and I try not to think about it too hard, but now and then the thought crosses my mind. What happens when I die? Can I die? I'm not sure I can. Maybe I wake up in the real reality. Maybe... I don't even know what other option there would be. Either I break it before I die, I die eventually and snap out of it then, or I just won't die, ever. The latter is hard to justify by my head or whoever put me in this, of course, as immortality isn't exactly a thing in this reality. But then again, everyone just revolving around you (and not in a good way) shouldn't be, either. 

Please, someone reply to this. It's not the usually thing on here, it's not a story, it's a cry for help. I know you all read this as I type it already, I know everyone watches and knows my every move even though they're not real. I know it, so please, someone help me. Do something. Anything. I'm getting desperate at this point.
