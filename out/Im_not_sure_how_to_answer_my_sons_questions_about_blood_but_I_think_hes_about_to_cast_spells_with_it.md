“Things are about to get messy.”

That’s not what you want to hear when your kid is the weird kid. Not when the unholy wound in your chest has stitched itself up.

Not when you’ve already befouled your underwear. 

“The sulfur smell is getting strong,” Damian said. “That means it’s getting closer.”

“Smell isn’t everything,” I snapped, adjusting my belt. “[Why the hell are you casting spells](https://redd.it/18hfd8c)?”

He flashed an exasperated look. “I don’t know, Father. Why are you making it necessary for me to cast spells?”

“Me – nope, that’s – *you’re* the weird – you can take that shit right the fuck outside!” I stammered.

My son glared at me, arms crossed, like I was the last kid in high school to stop believing in Santa. “How often have you woken up hovering above the bed?”

“Never!”

“You’re *welcome*. Though I couldn’t cleanse you entirely. That’s the reason for your morning itch.”

I scratched myself. “How do you know – I thought it was because of… something else.”

Damian rolled his eyes. “After you and Mother finish performing the Nasty Salamander, please remember that washing is always necessary.”

I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t make the words go. What are you supposed to say upon discovering that your kid remembers the one time he walked in on you?

Unless, of course, he’d been discreetly watching us every week. I wouldn’t think that about most children, but my son played in his own ballpark.

“But that’s not the source of your itch,” he pressed. “That’s entirely due to your parasite.”

I shuddered up and down my body; tremors prolonged their involuntary stay in my digestive tract.

“And that parasite is now dead. You’re welcome.”

I stared at the unmoving blob on the floor, still in awe that it had been inside of me. 

But a deeper part of me somehow knew that it was all true. Had always known.

“Um,” I shuffled. “That’s good. Right?”

“It’s good that you’re no longer possessed,” Damian answered, clutching his knife. 

My mouth went dry as I wait for the ‘but.’

“But killing the Scion has angered its parent.”

I stopped shivering at that point; the fear’s grip on me was too strong.

“It must realize by now what has happened.”

A scream tore through our house, raising every hair on my body. I’d never heard anything so hurt and angry. 

“So we’re going to have to go outside and meet it.”

My jaw fell. “How is that atop the list of options?”

“Because it will damn the house if we hesitate.”

I shook my head. “Then let him damn the house. There’s no way it can be worse than facing that thing.”

Damian glared at me, his face grave. “Do you really believe that, given what’s happening to your legs?”

I stared down, comprehending but not understanding what I was seeing. I had sunk into the floor as though it was thick mud, and it had crept halfway to my knees without me noticing it. The floor was still solid wood; the horrifying sight before me made no sense in the physical world I thought I knew. 

I yanked as hard as I could, not caring whether I broke every bone in my leg.

And nothing happened. If anything, I was slightly deeper.

For a moment, I forgot how to breathe.

“Father, would you like to escape?”

“Of COURSE I’d like to escape, you fucking weirdo!” I gasped. “I – I’m sorry, I don’t mean – well, I do – just please, help me out of here!”

“Hold this,” he answered, showing no emotion as he handed me the lit candle with ‘1913’ carved on it. “Pour the hot wax where the floor meets your skin.”

I took it from him, feeling very skeptical. “Will this hurt?”

“Yes, it will hurt you a great deal.”

“*Damn* it, Damian, you should know when to lie.”

“You always taught me to be truthful, Father.”

“Well 100 percent of all evidence we’re facing indicates that I’m a dumbass, so you should stop listening to what I say.” I lowered the candle to the place where the floor was approaching my knees. “So I just pour it directly on-”

My world turned upside down as I knew only pain. I once tore my anal lining during a particular spirited bout of diarrhea; the only comparison I can make is the wax felt like that stream of liquid horror had been pipelined into my own mouth to create an infinite loop of sphincter-rending unhappiness.

“One leg is free!” Damian’s voice floated through the pain. “Now burn your other leg.”

“No,” I mumbled. “I’d rather die here.”

“It’s the test, not the wax, that will set you free,” he explained in that same monotone. “The house will damn you by using your own cowardice. Only a sacrifice will unlock you.”

I shook my head, broken. “I – I’m sorry, Damian. I don’t have it in me.”

A moment of heavy silence passed between us. I felt the floor creeping, very slowly, up my leg.

“Jeffrey was right,” Damian finally answered. “You’ll never catch me with pornographic material simply because you’ll perish before the opportunity presents itself. Perhaps his father will be the one to shame my innate desires.”

Rage flooded through me. “*I’m* supposed to be the one to have that awkward conversation with you,” I hissed. 

I stopped thinking and poured. 

And I popped out with no pain. “What the hell? Damian, why didn’t it hurt?”

He wrapped his fingers tighter around the knife’s hilt. “It seems that the house is playing games with us, Father. One play for your body, another play for your mind.” He blinked, and his eyes had gone entirely white once more. “The creature beyond the door wants to confront us. At this point, it’s the only way to make things stop.” When he extended his hand, I could tell from several feet away that it was ice-cold.

“Won’t you join me outside, Father?”

I made it out alive, but not everyone else did. I’ll update more [when I’m feeling up to it](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).
