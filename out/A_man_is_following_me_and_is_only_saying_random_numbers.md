I’ll start off this story by saying that I live in NYC. I’ve been living here for the last 5 years so I’ve seen my fair share of shit in this city. It’s definitely not in short supply of crazy people. One time I saw a homeless guy fighting off a rat the size of a house cat for half a hot dog on the ground. That’s probably the most light hearted thing I’ve seen and I got stories for days but nothing has compared to what I experienced today. 

It was around 6pm when I left work in the financial district and I was off to my studio apartment in soho that I pay far too much for. When you think of it it’s really crazy just how many people are packed onto this small island. People with lives of their own that you’ll never know or understand. If you can’t tell I’m originally from New England so I naturally have a disdain for New York but I’m just down here for the money. Anyways as I’m marching along with the sea of people all on their own missions I notice a man that stands out in the crowd. A slightly heavier set man with a long grey beard and dressed in raggedy clothing standing still as the sea of people walk around him paying him no mind. He was muttering something to himself and as I was passing him his head shot up and his eyes met mine. 

“8 5 12 16 13 5” he said frantically and reaching out towards me 

I avoided his touch and told the guy “hey man I don’t got any money” and kind of held my hands up around my chest as a sign of not having anything. 

“8 5 12 16 13 5” he repeated and now started following me 

“16 12 5 1 19 5” he says in a shaky voice 

I turn my head around to see he’s now following me and without stopping I repeat myself now more sternly 

“I told you I don’t got anything dude”

“4 15 19 15 13 5 20 8 9 14 7” 

I start speeding up my walk trying to not show I was scared but not full on sprinting away just trying to get away from this guy. I’m nudging people out of my way working through the crowd and see the guy is still right behind me spouting off numbers.

“ 8 5 12 16 13 5” he screaming at the top of his lungs now and gaining on me 

Fuck it I start full on sprinting and get weaving through the crowd and with great luck I lose him. I don’t take any chances though and don’t stop running until I make it to my building. I run to the elevator, down the hallway, and finally make it to my apartment. I rush in and quickly lock the door behind me. 

I start catching my breath my heart feels like it’s about to pop out of my chest and I’m coursing with adrenaline. I’ve seen lots of mentally ill possible schizophrenic people on the streets all the time here but never one that tried to grab me or chase me. I finally start to calm down from this whole situation and catch my breath just as I take my back off of my door I get a knock. My blood turns cold as I look out the peep hole to see the man there banging on my door screaming out numbers again 

“8 5 12 16!” 

“7 15 4 16 12 5 1 19 5 8 5 12 16!!”

“9 20 8 21 18 20 19!!”

He starts kicking my door and I can see the flimsy wood starting to crack. 

“GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME!” I shriek almost in tears at this point. 

Seeing that the door is about to break at any second I think fast and grab a pan I have on my stove to arm myself and I run to my bathroom and lock that door behind me. I hear the front door break down and the man stomping towards the bathroom. He’s kicking and punching the door as we speak and keeps repeating the same numbers in a gurgling voice I’m not sure why

“11 9 12 12! 11 9 12 12! 11 9 12 12!”
