Throughout my childhood and young adulthood, I would often travel with my parents to become immersed in the remaining pristine lands of this country. These adventures ranged from alpine hiking in the Rockies, to treks through the maroon badlands of the Southwest, and even the dense verdant hills of Appalachia. 

Of course, life and lousy people are the banes of any person’s simple existence. When my now-former boss decided to cover her ass by picking me as the unwilling sacrifice, thus unraveling yet another chapter in my chaotic book of life, I packed it in and found a spot to start over.

With a little help from my savings and mostly-supportive family, I figured that I may as well live in as heavenly of a place as possible while going through hell. So, I settled on Ohio’s forested hill country. 

Nestled within some of the most pastoral farmland still left in this country, I found myself a quaint rental in a two-street town that itself sat just outside of a proud national forest preserve. 

That great land of woods, rivers, and hills could even rival its more well-known and deeper Appalachian cousins to the south and east. Better yet, it was comparatively less visited, making it a prime spot for me to trek through on my off days. 

I was more than a bit out of practice and out of shape, but I picked back up on the lessons I’d learned in my younger years in the wilderness quickly enough. Those first few hikes were tough, but I talked to a few park employees and rangers before my initial venture to ensure I wasn’t going to get myself on a 411 podcast the hard way. 

In fact, there was one especially cute ranger who wore her hat just crooked enough for it to be intentional that I was working up the nerve to ask out for a coffee date when my newfound paradise turned into a nightmare.

I figured at a certain point that a solo weekender in the more dense regions of that wilderness would be the ultimate remedy to my mental ailments. A nagging voice in the back of my head began whispering otherwise, but I figured that was my anxiety rather than instinct.

Hell, it started out fine. I had more than the necessary supplies, a clear route planned, and two people – including said ranger – who knew my plans and my desired endpoint. While I wasn’t so much a fool to figure that *nothing* could go wrong, I figured if I was careful and patient on the trail at least nothing catastrophic would happen.

Then I got myself lost.

I don’t know quite when it happened, but I know how. Some goofed-up combination of my GPS battery system failing and me not checking the trail map enough, going off-trail to make camp in the dark, and my own jacked-up headspace that I’d been ignoring for months now. 

After the initial panic hit, I did my best to calm the *what-ifs* and remember my training. 

*Get to the nearest elevated point, get a position, and get on a marked trail*. 

I did just that and saw that I was not as far off as I’d feared. In fact, I came across what looked almost like a game trail, if not for the slight indents of human-like prints smattering the damp earthen floor. Not stopping to wonder why those footprints were barefoot, my only concern was connecting with a main trail and hopefully finding other people. With a renewed sense of confidence, I proceeded on down that game trail.

I still had that positive outlook in mind when I heard the first howls.

Well, *howls* are putting it mildly. They were more like some wicked amalgam of the roar of a bear and the yowling of a big cat. The thing that wigged me out a bit at first was that black bears typically strove to avoid human contact, and the Appalachian cougar was either extinct or, at best, barely extant. 

Plus, I had a few defenses up my sleeve in the form of bear spray and my prized Glock-20 that my old man had gifted me the day I’d taken my first solo trip years back now. If the concentrated capsaicin didn’t deter some forest beast, ten millimeters of jacketed hollow point surely would, though every part of me hoped it wouldn’t have to come to that point. I’d *almost* take a mauling over having to kill one of those wonderful, endangered creatures.

The fact that the howling sounded like multiple creatures at once, yet none that were distinctly identifiable, led me to make camp earlier than normal that afternoon. If there *was* a bear or rogue lion nearby, the best action I could take at that point would be to do my due diligence in finding a proper site for the night and head out bright and early.

After finding a decently open spot away from dense vegetation or food sources, I set up camp and a separate cook site. All the while, I let out a few “heys!” and “hohs!” of my own to alert whatever animal might be near to mind each other’s spaces. 

The part of the strange cries that made me freeze in the middle of my dinner of re-hydrated beefy mac was, aside from how they seemed to be creeping ever closer, that the harder I listened, the more the guttural howls, grunts, and yelps seemed to sound like words. *Human* words. Nigh unintelligible words, albeit clear intonations and consonants that few animals can make or mimic. Even cougars which could sound like a female or child crying out in distress don’t actually *form* words. 

*Could be crows*, I briefly thought as I packed away my smellies in a bear canister. 

The thought calmed me for a few moments till I shook my head, remembering that even crows hardly make such deep, nasty tones.

Now at a total loss as to what was in the woods with me, I figured then that I wasn’t going to get much sleep that night, if any. I didn’t even dare build a fire for fear of attracting rather than dissuading whatever might be out there among the vast expanse of trees. As the darkest hours of the night began to weave their web of paranoia, I took refuge in my tent and some solace in my own none-too-measly defenses. 

It was not so much *if* something was out there watching me, but rather the unknown of what it could be, if not a typical member of the local fauna.

Having resolved to wait the night out and hike out in the morning, I was thankful at least that the skies were as clear as forecasted. The eternal swathe of celestial bodies made for a much more pleasant canopy than my rainfly. 

As I lay on my sleeping pad trying to recall what my father had taught me about identifying the constellations, my eyes grew heavy as they do when the serotonin of peace finally replaces many minutes of panic. That coupled with nearly three days of continuous trekking was now threatening to overtake my fear for control over my body’s natural inclinations. The gentle stillness of the forest only exacerbated that feeling.

*Waitaminute, stillness? In these woods?*

Even in those deepest hours, it was hardly ever silent. The lack of chittering of the occasional flying squirrel, the huffing of skunks, and the hooting of the barred owl were noticeable. 

That realization hit me just as the first spear tore through my tent. 

For a few seconds, I sat there stupidly, not even registering what the hell was happening until two more of the crude weapons sliced through the canvas. One narrowly avoided burying itself in my skull. I was not three times lucky however and the last thrown spear bit deep into my left bicep. 

Even as I was thrown on my back from the impact and shocked with bolts of white-hot pain, my brain didn’t register that I was under attack till the same bastardized caterwauling from earlier returned. Although now it was less of a call-and-response, and more like the warcries of the Devil’s own legions. 

I grabbed my backpack from my prone position in the tent, throwing it over me in a desperate attempt for cover as a final pair of spears tried to find their mark. I was just quick enough to get the pack up on my chest as one of those fierce weapons ripped into nylon instead of flesh.

The war whoops and animalistic roaring were nearly on top of me now. I figured that staying in my tent surely meant death, so still holding my speared pack I burst through a shredded side.

Right as I’d freed myself I fell sideways and down into the forest floor with a rough jerk. 

*Christ Alive, what now?!* 

The damn spear had caught on a torn flap and tripped me up!

*Ahh God, I’m dead man I’m fucking dead!* I thought, now seeing a pair of wild-looking humanoids approaching out of the brush with wicked gleams in their fiery orange-yellow eyes.

As the large figures approached I began to be able to make out some of their features in the bright gleam of the moonglow. 

They were indeed huge, relative to even my own six foot-one linebacker-framed self. Even in that pale dim light, I could easily tell their great size. The bastards seemed thick with hair too, far more than anyone should be. But it was those terrible yellow eyes and snarling visages that made me realize I was most assuredly *not* dealing with any ordinary human.

I heard soft pattering to my left, and another to my right. More of these fuckers were flanking me, toying with me.

*Like they’d done this before…*

Not knowing whether they wanted to simply kill me, eat me, or do something even more gruesome than what my mind was conjuring in those moments I resolved to at least die with my boots on. 

When I had fallen, by yet another miracle my pack had spilled a few of its contents that had been stopped in place by my body. Chief among those was my father’s 10mm and my own Maglite. With a maniacal grin, I exploded into movement in a way that one only can do when faced with a grim demise. 

Grabbing the Glock with my right hand and the Maglite with my left, I simultaneously swung at the rapid movement of one of the fuckers flanking me and fired a volley of shots at the two in front. 

My slashed arm ached with the swing and sent streaks of pain up through my body as the Maglite connected brutally with the strange humanoid’s arm. Howls of pain erupted as that and at least one of my bullets had found its mark. Having bought myself a few moments I pushed myself upright and back a few yards against a massive treefall, smacking the Maglite’s button on. 

Part of me, even now, wishes I had not witnessed the true form of what was hunting me that night.

My flashlight’s powerful beam revealed what the full moon could not about these…things. They were human, *sort of*, but also something else entirely. Something more. 

They stood bipedal and tall as I’d already discerned, but what I had first thought to be bunches of excess hair was actually thick but surprisingly well-kept fur of various brunette shades covering almost every square inch of their otherwise naked forms. 

Their limbs were as elongated as their torsos, topped off by fearsome knifelike claws. Indeed, it was the man-beast's faces that shook me and have thus adhered most to my poor mind.

Each of them was different, yet equally as horrible. 

One of them, presumably the leader by its frame and command over the others, was snoutlike, though more ursine in nature than his companions. It was not as natural as a bear, however, the tip of its snout curling inward in a grotesque manner as I realized it was *smiling* at me. 

Unlike the others, its eyes were a fiery, amber blaze that seemed to carry within them a tragic brew of pain and fury. It carried in his furred hand a gnarled stave that stood nearly as high as his bushy head and as solid around as its forearm. Carved with strange sigils and symbols, it made my fading mind spin deeper into madness with every passing second. Of course, the blood loss from the gash in my own arm was not helping.

All the while those cacodaemoniacal eyes stayed fixated on my own, very mortal ones.

The faces of the others were far more canine or catlike, yet all held that same malformed grin as they calmly approached their prey. I noticed to my further dismay that although I’d successfully blown multiple gaping holes in both the chieftain and the female cat-beast on his right, those wounds were fast healing. Lord knows if the shots had even slowed them down at all.

When they were within mere feet of me and I was preparing to make my final, futile stand (after pissing myself in terror and making whatever peace with God that I could muster), the chieftain held out its arm grasping the eldritch stave. Obeying their leader, its charges promptly stopped midstride and dropped to all fours, crouching as their respective natural animals would have. 

As he crossed those final steps between us, the truth – at least some of it – of what these *things* were came to light under the rays of the moon.

Still wearing that abhorrent smile, with each step the creature morphed before my petrified gaze. 

The dark brown fur covering it from snout to foot shed, its snarling animalistic visage changed back into that of a racially unidentifiable but hateful-eyed man. His tapered claws shifted back into thick, human nails. 

Muscles twisted, bones cracked, and limbs retracted until beast had become man once more.

The man wore a leather loincloth, still clutching that alien stave whose sigils I now saw matched those of the deep emeralds and woad blues painted on his face, legs, and chest. 

The beast-turned-man was now so close to me that I could almost taste his coppery breath as he lowered his head down to meet my own, those amber-blaze eyes boring into my soul. Trembling, I could not even scream or beg for mercy the fear had gripped me so tight. With a movement that surpassed the quickness of any athlete, he grasped the side of my skull with his rough, meaty hand. 

Visions assaulted me of explorers and campers both present and far past being stalked and toyed with before being ritualistically butchered and consumed in the name of deities long forgotten. Visions of treaties made then broken, warnings unheeded, and finally of the brutal consequences that followed. All of which strove to shatter my already fragile psyche.

Believing then that I was doomed, I shut my eyes in desperation hoping that I could conjure up some other, *any* other image in my mind’s-eye before meeting my Creator that wasn’t this abomination. Consciousness began to slip away as I felt my body ragdoll into the dirt.

The last thing that I remember before waking with a start in the local town hospital, a brunette-haired and crooked-hatted ranger sitting at my bedside, was the chieftain whispering…something.

“Wh–waa the…” I croaked, my throat as raspy as a lifelong smoker’s.

The ranger, Mia, twitched into consciousness from her half-asleep state. 

“Here! Here, just sip this, slowly now,” she said softly, guiding a straw to my lips.

As the cool water trickled down my throat and gave me new life, I smiled up at her.

“Guess…I should’ve stayed on the trail, huh?” I joked with a pained grin.

Mia shook her head matching my sardonic expression, her great raven mane rippling like inky waves. 

“I won’t bother saying ‘I told you so’ for now,” she riposted, “I’ll save that for our coffee date.”

Even feeling like I had crawled out of Perdition itself, my eyes lit up at her words. 

“I’ll uhh, pick you up at…at eight, just have to take care of a couple of things first, eh?”

She let out a giggle that had some of the nurses rolling their eyes. 

“I’ll say! But…weird thing is, even though we found your mangled campsite, the hiker that radioed us yesterday morning *found* you on the main trail a mile east, like you’d just laid down and slept there!” she said, turning her back to refill the cup.

“You wouldn’t happen to, eh, recall how you got there, or what happened before, *would* you?”

“ Very weird. Yeah I uhh, I don’t really remember what–” I started to reply before I looked up at her.

Mia suddenly had an intense expression on her olive-hued face that had not been there seconds ago.

“Nothing? Nothing about the *animal* attack,” she said pointedly. 

Something about her abrupt change told me that I *shouldn’t* remember. The whole ordeal was more akin to a nightmare than reality in any case, and part of me just wanted to compartmentalize the whole shitshow up to some natural explanation. 

Maybe I’d foraged the wrong mushrooms, or went into an acute psychotic episode out there. Really, I just wanted to move on as I’d already done with so much in my life, that I gave Mia the answer she and I both needed.

“Nah, not really,” I said shaking my numb head, “Only that something or someone was sure as hell looking out for my stupid self.”

Mia dropped that fervent look as swiftly as it had risen, giving me another of her warm smiles that validated the voice telling me to sequester what another voice was screaming was the truth. She gave my hand a squeeze and moved again to get the cup.

“You know Karl, I like you because you have a genuine love and more importantly *respect* for this land,” she said. “There are so many people, past and present, who think they do but have no idea whatsoever…you know some jackasses are even doing those stupid heart carvings over ancient cave drawings?”

She turned back and placed the cup in my hands before sliding me a piece of paper with a phone number.

I took both, and with a shrug said, “Guess it’s just how I was raised. And…see you soon?”

“I hope so!” she said with her usual peppiness before turning to head out. “Still, if more people had a bit of respect, maybe fewer fools would go missing, and less pristine land would disappear with each passing year.”

Hell if I could argue with that, and said as much before waving her goodbye.

She turned around once more before pushing through the exit.

“Just remember Karl, next time, stay on the damn trail. Your guardian angel might not have as much pull as you think she does.”

As she left and I lay my head back down on the hospital bed, I could have sworn on anything that I saw a faint but fiery glint of amber when she winked at me.

Did I see that? Or was it simply the glow of the sunset mixing with the discolored hospital lights?

I shoved that thought also to the recesses of my mind, resolving to stay as balanced as my will would allow. I was safe now, healing up, and even had my first real date in a while to look forward to! Mia had also taken the liberty of getting me a few personal items, my laptop here included. Plus, I had a pretty damn majestic view of the hills from my window. 

Life could be worse.

Still, a voice in my head that wasn’t quite mine kept whispering a singular, repeating promise to me, threatening to undo that threadbare sanity.

*When the Earth is sick, its Guardians will emerge to heal it.*
