Hey everybody. I do apologize for posting here. I have been dealing with this for a while, but as of late, it has become so frequent, I feel like I am going insane. I could really use your input, but honestly, just the fact you are reading is a bit of a relief. So thank you. And I SWEAR I'm not insane! My phycologist has told me so, Then again, we haven't really talked about this. Sorry, I'm rambling.

  
For a while, I've had a few issues when I first wake up. I often have very lucid dreams, that often can be labelled as Déjà rêvé- I tend to dream of the future. It isn't super important stuff- normally it is minor things like dropping my phone from my pocket in the bathroom and cracking the screen. Soooo annoying when it happened 4 days later. Luckily my phone is insured. So a lot of times, I pay attention to my dreams because they tend to have odd nuggets of the future. But again, mostly super boring, everyday events. I just can parrot people as they talk. 

  
This isn't about my dreams. What has been happening lately is sometimes, when I wake up from dreams sometimes, the dream and reality clash in a weird way. It started about 8 or 9 years ago. I fell asleep on my couch to some sort of show. It wasn't the first time, nor the last. But what I woke up to was extremely odd. An oddly thready black vortex was heading for me. It was an odd stand off for a few seconds as I tried to shake the sleep from my mind as it was still in my frontal vision- what I mean by that is I was staring at it, and assumed it was an odd sleep residual or something. But it didn't go away. It began to unravel, the threads disappearing. The image was closest to a cord protector loom, but it was bigger, about 2 feet or so in diameter. But what I found so fascinating is after I fully woke, and stood up, I could follow the vortex/cord protector as it unraveled. It ended up coming through to wall of my bedroom. I considered running to the front door to see if I could find out if it continued further. But I was a bit shaken for the fact I could walk and see it going through the wall. It wasn't a quick event, taking up a few minutes. 

  
I grew up believing in the supernatural, but I wasn't a true believer- I was a skeptic but when I could not disprove was evidence of something extraordinary. That was my personal belief, and still is. The reason I mentioned this is a first I thought it was a lingering dream. Until I stood up and the thing had dimension, depth, and a path that I could track my physically moving. Matrixing was when an object you see in real life contorts to match with your imagination, but seeing the object as a 3D mass from a few angles as I walked around it? It wasn't that. It dissolved slower than I could walk. 

  
I haven't seen that Vortex since, though that night, I wondered what would happen if I closed my eyes once I saw it, and let it physically touch me. What could possibly happen to me? Did it want to consume me? Or connect me? The cord protector loom is used as a conduit protector. Was something trying to reach out to me?

  
But that was 9 years ago. I could have posted then. Since then, the Vortex has never come back. And nothing really weird has happened. Until this year. This whole year, when I dream, and awake, certain elements from my dreams linger. At first, I thought it was an odd residual or Negative Picture illusion. But the problem is as I adjust my head, the images and items and visions are all in 3D. I can see the different angles and shades that shouldn't exist as they fade back away into wherever they came from. Sometimes, its a series of patterns, like the type you see making decorative fences. But also, recently, I saw a face as I woke up. I could look and adjust my angle on viewing the face- it was a younger face, chubby cheeks, light eyes, and a dark cloak. It faded out of vision after a few seconds. 

Some of them don't feel threatening, but the humanoid types seem to be reaching for me. And I feel insane. I know this whole story is whack, but I am up at 6 am because it feels like the dreams cannot always get me in the daylight, but then again, there were a few residuals, a few lingering trying to keep me asleep, trying to connect me to something. 

Thank you for reading this. If you need clarification, please feel free to ask- I really just have had this weighing on my mind for a while. And if you have experienced, tell me. I want to know I am not alone anymore.
