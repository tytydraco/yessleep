I dont have much time but read the whole thing and it'll all make sense


You can't escape them. They'll always find you, you can pack up your whole life and move to the most remote location. They'll find you. You can get off social media and get rid of all technology and they'll find you. And they'll always be watching you.

I don't have long to tell you about them. Because mine is watching me, and I can feel his eyes on me as I type this. What are they you might ask? I dont exactly know, what I do know is yours and mine have been watching us our whole lives. 

Whenever you thought you saw a monster in your room at night as a kid it was them. If you've ever seen a ghost it was them. Some of them are smarter than others, they disguise themselves as animals or even your pets. I don't know what they want. I don't know what they are using us for but I know they interfere with our lives and move us like pawns on a chessboard. How do I know this? My grandma told me and now she is gone.

When I was 7, I was terrified of the man-monster in my closet , it look like a man with no hair, dressed in a cloak, greyish skin, expressionless eyes and a wide smile. Every night he was there watching me and smiling. One night he decided to step out the closet so I ran into my parents room to find my dad to get him to make the monster go away to find blood splattered across the room and what was left of my parents mangled bodies on the floor, pieces of them on the walls and ceiling. I screamed and ran. I kept running until I was deep in the woods behind our house, feeling like I was being chased by the monster .

 The police found me the next day and took me in for questioning. There was obviously not much I could tell them other than a monster killed my parents. My Grandma was called in and I went to live with her. I tried to tell her about what I saw but she told me to never speak about it again. My parents murder case ran cold and everyone eventually forgot about it. 

I was put into therapy and had a pretty normal childhood or as normal as you can get in my situation. I graduated school and college with flying colours and got a pretty decent job working as a accountant in the next over town. Life was good for a time, I had friends and a boyfriend.... But it's all over now. My grandmother recently fell ill, after a life long time of smoking a box of cigarettes a day finally caught up to her she was put into intensive care. And on a mechanical ventilator. In the hospital is where she told me about them, she told me how her mother told her and her mother before. 

Our family's darkest secret, the secret of the Minders. We dont know what they are or what they want but they control us through telepathic manipulation or as you would call it intrusive thoughts, they are the ones responsible for anxiety, depression, self harm and suicide. When you stray off their planned path for you in life they get rid of you through any means possible. She told me the man-monster I saw as a kid was one of them. And that the night my parents were killed my mom had phoned her worried about me and told her about the monster. My grandmother accidentally slipped up and told her about the Minders and thats why my parents were dead. Once she told me this I took it as her losing her mind in her old age and told her to get some rest and I went home. 

I arrived home two hours ago just as I got in the door I got a phone call from the hospital" ma'am we hate to inform you but your grandma has passed away. " the receptionist said in a panicked tone " I didn't expect her to live much longer she was old"I said with a grim tone. "no ma'am someone came into her room and stitched her nose and mouth closed and unplugged her ventilator, she was murdered" she said her voice shaking. "Are the police handling it?" I asked "yes" she said. "thank you for informing me" I said and hang up the phone.

 I walked to the cupboard and grabbed a bottle of wine and poured myself a glass and went up to bed while chugging the wine wishing that my boyfriend was here. As I walked into the room I immediately saw the writing on the wall and dropped my glass it shattering against the floor, the writing read "snitches get stitches" I froze for a second and surveyed the room and saw the closet was open. I ran for the spare room and locked the door and called the police but there was no signal. This brings us to where I am now hiding in the spare room with no way to call for help and no where to run to. The closest door is creaking open and I can see him. I hope this post gets through so that you can save yourself from them somehow. 

Dont look up after reading this, yours will be there, keep scrolling through reddit and act normal. Its the only way to survive . But in the end there is no escape. They'll always find you and they'll always be watching
