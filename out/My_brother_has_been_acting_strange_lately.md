My brother, Josh has been acting strange lately. My parents don't believe in what I've been trying to tell them though I've tried very hard. So I'm typing this out so maybe I can convince them to get my brother some help.    
  
My childhood was anything but normal. I was the firstborn and was raised to be always a respectful person. My brother though, was not. At a young age, he would talk back to my parents, doctors, and even random strangers. In private he was also violent. Many times he would start to beat over small things. at the time I was 11 and he was 6. He would punch me and bite me any chance he would get. And whenever I was defending myself I would get in trouble with my parents. So I would have to live with the beatings... from my younger brother.   
  
He would constantly beat the family cat and dog, to the point where they must've run away one day because we never saw them again. My brother always got what he wanted but was the opposite of me. My parents were very strict and hard on me, but open and free with Josh. I know it just sounds like a jealous older brother rambling on, but Josh has always been the golden child. He's always been my mother's favorite, and she made sure to show it. But the kid is weird. He's never been told no in his life, and with that mixture, something bad was bound to happen.    
  
    
  
 THE INCIDENT   
  
It was only a matter of time before something would happen. I remember the day very clearly. I was around 16 at the time while Josh was 11. I woke up and got ready for school as normal. I tried making polite conversation with my brother at breakfast but he seemed a little distant that morning. Ok, I'll just give the kid some space. I thought nothing else of it. If only I knew what would happen, I could have tried stopping it. The ride to school was normal and so was half the day. To give background, our school matched the overall town we lived in. Small. Elementary middle and high school were all combined in one building. Everyone knew everyone and that's how it went. Shortly after 4th period, we received an alert on the intercom. Our school was going into lockdown. My teacher quickly got up and locked the class down as he was instructed to do. My classmates and I were all confused and quite frankly scared. My teacher too, seemed concerned. There were no drills scheduled that day. This was a real situation. In a town as little as mine, crime was a rare occurrence. The time ticked differently than normal. What was probably 10 minutes in lockdown felt like 10 hours. The quietness was strangely loud upon our ears.   
  
   
  
 We all jumped when the voice sounded over the intercom telling us the rest of the school day was canceled. As I was packing my bag happy the day had been called short, but confused about what happened, my teacher called me into the hall. I got up, sort of dazed, and walked outside the classroom. There stood the principal, the vice principal, a police officer, and my teacher. Immediately I knew something was wrong. "Son", the principal stated in a southern and concerned but stern voice. "There's been an accident involving your brother". "Your mother has been informed and is on her way," said the police officer standing next to my teacher. "W-what"? I remember stammering out. "W-w-what do you mean? Is he all right? What happened"?  "Kid your brothers, uh... well he's... he's fine, ok?" the principal said glancing at the officer. "Everything should be explained later on when your mother arrives". The next couple of hours were all a blur. A flurry of police officers and other people asking different questions about my brother. Tears falling from the faces of my parents. and no sign of Josh. I wasn't told directly, but based on the police officer's questions and the talk around town, my brother had attacked a kid. And badly. The incident was unprovoked. Josh just launched at him, biting his face and stomping on him. It took a couple of teachers overhearing the situation to pull Josh off the kid. I heard it took forever to get the blood stain off of the floors, walls, and... even the ceiling.    
  
After that, the kid was unrecognizable. His family swiftly left the town. No lawsuits, or repercussions. They just disappeared. I didn't see Josh until three days after the incident. Surprisingly he seems normal. My mother instructed me and my father to forget the whole thing. We were told under no circumstance were we to ask Josh what happened at school.  "Act like the whole thing didn't exist' we were told. My and my brother were pulled out of school and forced to be home-schooled shortly. I didn't dare protest. I knew exactly why. I have no idea if any trouble came upon my family legally. It was all kept hush-hush.

As stated before, Josh hasn't been himself lately. I know it's almost been three years since the so-called accident at school took place. Since then life has been somewhat normal, and no further incidents involving Josh with another person have happened. He hasnâ€™t showed any signs of violence yet. Of course, he's not allowed outside the house for more than an hour anymore.  But lately, I think he's been breaking mentally. The whole reason I started this journal in the first place is because of a comment he made a couple of hours ago. Josh and I were watching something on the TV when he calmly asked "How many times does it take to stab a fully grown person to death". What? I asked incredibly disturbed, one thing going through my mind. "hear me out", he said in a voice like he was discussing something normal like the weather." I hear all the time of people getting stabbed 50 or 60 times, and surviving to tell the tale. But Ive also heard of people getting stabbed less than ten times and dying immediately. "Which one is it"? "Dude that's weird", I answered. "Like really weird". "Whatever" Josh snapped back in an alarmingly hostile voice before stomping off to his room.    
  
   
  
I sat there in silence for a while which was only broken by my mother's voice. "Hey, where's your brother?" "I thought you tw-", "MOM!" I screamed in a hushed voice. I swiftly but quietly explained what just transcribed. "And then he just stormed off t-" "ENOUGH" my mom screamed.  Reasonably, I took a step back in shock. "I will not have you bullying your brother. Not after what happened. You should be a little more considerate. Get upstairs now"! I stared at her for a minute, not believing what I just heard, before I too, stormed off to my room. Passing by my brother's room I could faintly hear him talking. Now for obvious reasons, he was not allowed a phone. So he had to be talking himself. I know I shouldn't. I should've just walked away. But something inside me had to know what he could be talking about. "They never listen, they never learn. It's like they don't even know me anymore". Why was I cursed to be a part of this family? I gotta make them understand. Somehow, someway". I know it sounds cliche and fucking crazy, but this kid was literally talking to himself like a crazy person. I quietly sneaked away and started typing this in my bedroom. I don't know what to do. Obviously, something is wrong with my brother and my mom won't see the situation rationally. What do I do? I'll update you if anything else happens.
