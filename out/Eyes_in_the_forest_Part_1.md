This happened about a month ago now but I can’t stop thinking about it. I figured writing it down here could help clear my head. And maybe someone out there who reads this has answers.



For context, I live in a pretty rural area. The nearest house to mine is just short of a mile out and my house is pretty much surrounded by forest. The driveway leading up to the house is long, it's a decent drive through forest until you reach the house. Once you pull in you see our little front porch and garage. It's a nice house, little small but it's got an upstairs, two bedrooms, decently sized living room, and is perfect for me and my wife. 



We have lived here for about a year now and everything has been going great. We moved all the way out here to get away from all the family drama that's been going on. I won't get into that here. But I like to hunt, go on walks in the woods, and am generally an outdoorsy person, it's calming for me. The forest helps me clear my head, the ambient sounds of birds chirping, the leaves crunching under my feet. Many would describe the forest as silent, but trust me you will know when it's silent. There's always noises in the forest. It may seem quiet compared to the city life you're used to. Cars honking, AC blowing, fluorescent lights humming, your coworker debating with your boss about getting that raise that you were supposed to get months ago; but the forest is just as loud, but in a calming way. But when the forest falls silent, it’s time to leave. Silence signals danger; it means something is watching.

My wife is the opposite, the woods frighten her, she typically doesn't go past the wooden fence that encloses the area around the back porch. The last time she did, about two weeks ago she fell and sprained her ankle. She can’t walk while it heals so she just uses crutches for now. She tells me the forest makes her paranoid, like there is a constant danger of being attacked. She says she feels like something is watching her in the forest. I’ve always believed I knew better, that I was at the top of the food chain in the forest. The forest should fear me and my rifle; I had no reason to fear it. But, oh, how wrong I was.



This particular night was as usual, it's hunting season and I go out with my bow just as the sun starts to set. I hike about a mile into the forest to my steel post perched high in the treetops. 

When I bow hunt I typically sit in the tree with my night vision scope on my bow and scan the area for any IR readings. I wait for the sound of a deer, and once I spot it I shoot. One arrow usually doesn't do the trick, I then have to track the deer through the dark forest and then collect my winnings. 

Why do I do this at night you might ask. 

Well my father taught me that it was the best time to hunt, but in all honesty I think I just liked the thrill, the challenge, but not after tonight. 



I also enjoy my time in the post. The forest is so quiet at night, the soft breeze gently swaying the branches back and forth, the occasional owl calling into the night. It's really relaxing when you're calm, but some days every rustling of the leaves can put you on edge. 



This was one of those days. I would hear a sound, jolt up fumbling my bow in my hands and scanning the area with my IR, nothing.

This happened repeatedly until I almost made the hike back. But then I saw it, movement in the forest, pretty far in the distance, but I was certain I had saw a figure moving slowly. I was excited to hunt my first deer of the year, I felt as if I could already taste the venison, almost as if I could already smell its corpse…

As I look through my IR to line up the shot, nothing, no glow to show me there is a biological creature in front of me. But I swear—  I look down from my scope and still see the figure moving, why isn’t it showing up on my IR? I look back at my scope, nothing, I look back into the forest, nothing. 

The creature was gone, leaving me confused and frustrated that I’d let what might have been my only deer escape.

In case you're wondering, my scope highlights all living creatures in a green glow, that's how I know where to shoot in the dark. But at this moment I am convinced mine is broken, which sucks cause these things are expensive. But that can't be—I know my sensor is working. I’d spotted a few birds through the scope and could see them clearly.

 I shrugged it off, though deep down, I think I knew something was wrong with whatever I saw in the forest.

I prepared to leave, I began to put my stuff in my bag when this stench hit me. This gut wrenching scent. It smelt like a rat had died in the air vents of an office building and everyone was now breathing dead rodent, and now you know you're not getting that raise because it was your job to lay the mouse traps.  It smelt like death. 



This scent convinced me to speed up in my endeavor to get back home to my wife.

But then something made me freeze. “Ryan, can you come down from there?”



It was my wife. 



What?



 Why is she out here? How did she get out here?

I couldn't tell what direction her voice was coming from so I grabbed my bow and scanned the area through my scope. 



No glow.



I see nothing in the scope, no glow, no creature, no wife. 

But I heard her I swear. 

  


I call out to her. 



No answer.



I chuckled to myself. “Obviously she isn’t out here, what was I expecting to see?” As these thoughts ran through my brain that foul rotten stench got stronger. 

“I better get out of here.” I thought. 



I slowly climbed out of my post, listening intently for any sound that wasn’t made by me. 

My hands clung on to each rung tightly as I lowered myself, one rung at a time. I didn’t realize how high in the treetops my post really was until this moment. 

A sound in the forest. 

I froze. 

After a long moment of silence I resumed, one rung at a time. 

Once I had reached the bottom I dug intently through my bag in search of my compass. 

After about 30 seconds of quietly fumbling through the darkness I retrieved my compass and held it no less than two inches from my face in an attempt to find which way is home. 



Once I had regained my sense of direction I started my quiet hunt through the forest. Though I kept telling myself what I had seen and heard in the forest was just a work of my imagination I refrained from turning on my flashlight in fear of alerting it to my location. 

This didn’t help me find the way back home however. I felt as if I had been walking in circles for hours when I finally saw it.

There she was. My wife. 

“Thank god.” was my first thought. I finally made it back home. Well atleast I was close. She must have noticed I had been gone for much longer than intended and came out here to call for me.



I started approaching her. 

“You shouldn't be out here.” I warned although I was grateful she was. “ It's dangerous at night, and—” 



How could I have been so blind, how could I have been so stupid. 



Where are her crutches? How the *hell* did she walk out here? 



I stood there frozen mid stride, staring into her eyes. It was– so wrong. It looked like all the joy, and happiness, everything that made her human was gone. And she just stood there, staring back. And her facial expression— god her facial expression. It looked like she had no idea how to utilize any of the muscles in her face and so they fell limp. 



This was not my wife. 



This was not human.

And then. 

It started speaking.

“*What's wrong Ryan?*” Its mouth movements not matching the words it was saying. 

“*Come home with me*.”

My wifes voice coming out of that *thing* was enough to snap me out of my trance. 

I turned and ran, faster than I had ever run before. And didn’t look back, not even for a second. It was like my brain was on autopilot. I wasn’t paying attention to where I was going, but anywhere ***it*** wasn’t was better than where I was. I could hear its footsteps behind me as I ran, but that didn’t stop me. At one point I think I tripped but just got back up and kept going, I’m not sure. 



It's all a blur. And after what felt like forever I ran face first into a tree. 

This turned off my “auto pilot” and I realized that I couldn’t hear the footsteps behind me anymore. My face was burning and I felt blood running down from my nose. I couldn’t feel my legs, my lungs were on fire, and I was completely lost. 

And then I saw it.



Lights.



I force my legs to move, and get closer and closer to the lights. Through the foliage I could see the wood picket fence that surrounds my back porch. I stumbled through the fence and hurriedly opened the sliding glass door on the back deck.  



I called for her.



She answered.



I rush into the bedroom and see her lying on the bed with her crutches beside her. \\

“Where have you been, I have been worried sick!”



I didn’t tell her.



I guess the main reason I am posting this here is for answers. I haven’t slept in nights and don’t think I could ever hunt again. My wife is concerned. She has been questioning me about what happened that night. I just told her I got lost tripped, hence the bloody nose. But she knows me and knows that I never act this way. 



I don’t have any mental health problems and don’t drink, do drugs or have any history of drug use. I know what I saw. If any of you have answers or have any similar stories, I’d love to chat.



I will make a follow up post in the future so keep an eye out.
