There’s something my family doesn’t talk about. Not because we don’t believe it, but because talking about it might make it worse.

For decades, certain members of my family have had the same dream. It doesn’t happen to everyone, and it never happens to those who already know about it. But for the unlucky ones, it starts the same way.

At first, you notice a shadowy figure in your dreams. He’s always there standing at a distance, never interacting, just… watching. He wears a cap, but his face is always obscured. As the dreams continue, he gets closer. At first, he might just move into the background, a silent observer. Then, one night, he finally steps forward. He chases you. No matter what you do, you can’t escape. When he catches you, he wraps his hands around your throat and chokes you. You feel yourself suffocating your real body gasping for air. But you can’t wake up. You can only be saved if someone physically shakes you awake.

This has been happening for generations. No one knows when it started or why. But the rule is clear: if you don’t know about him, you’re at risk. Once you learn, you’re safe.

The last person to experience the dream was my brother. He had no idea about it beforehand. When he described what happened—how the figure appeared, how it escalated, how he woke up gasping after my family members shook him awake everyone in my family recognized it immediately. This had happened before. The last time was years ago, to my cousin.

That night, something happened that still unsettles me to this day. I was young at the time, doing homework in another room. My cousin had already gone to bed, but I needed to grab something from her room. I moved quietly, not wanting to wake her. As I turned to leave, something caught my eye. In my peripheral vision, I saw a dark figure standing at the foot of her bed. But when I turned to look directly at it, there was nothing there.

I thought I imagined it. A trick of the light, maybe. But a few minutes later, she started screaming. My older cousin and I ran into the room, shaking her awake. She woke up gasping, terrified. At the time, they didn’t tell me what happened. I only found out later that she had *the* dream.

My family once did a ritual, a *puja*, in a temple to put an end to this. For a while, it worked. No one had the dream for years. But now, it’s back. They’ve talked about doing another ritual, but there’s a problem: every family member has to be present for it to work, and getting everyone together is almost impossible.

I shouldn’t want this. I know I shouldn’t. But some part of me wants to experience it. I want to see him. To know if this is just a psychological phenomenon passed down through fear, or if something *else* is happening. But if the rules are true… I never will. Because now, I know.
