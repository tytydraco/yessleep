Jason stopped speaking.  
He didn’t need to.  
His drawings said enough.

His room was a mausoleum of paper and blood. Pages scattered across the floor like a path through some rotten cathedral. Crudely drawn towers of circuitry fused with tendon. Human heads wired into server racks. Binary code tattooed onto wet, skinless backs. At the center of it all. A door.

No. Not a door.

A curtain of sutured flesh, stitched from lips, scalps, and eyelids and wires.  
And behind it… eyes.  
Familiar.  
Too familiar.

Each page bore the same message in Jason’s careful, shaking hand:

**“She’s almost through. We can meet her again.”**

That night, I sat beside his bed again. Told him I loved him. That I’d protect him. That no matter what this thing was, it wouldn’t take him. I tried to believe it.

But even as I whispered it, the router lights blinked to life—unplugged.

Jason whimpered in his sleep.  
And then I saw it: his mouth moved, silently.  
Mouthing something. A prayer? A warning?  
No.

A *code.*

It began with a scream.

Not Jason’s—but *hers.*

Bonnie’s.

It came through the TV upstairs, through the laptop I hadn’t touched since the incident. Through the speakers embedded in the walls. A scream spliced with mechanical stutters—like meat trying to become machine, or machine trying to become human. And then came the images.

I don’t remember turning the screen on. But it was on.  
And it showed me *where she was.*

Not Hell. Something worse.  
A digital pit. A malformed plane of static and suffering.  
**The Wire Temple Of Screaming Flesh.**

It was a landscape built from broken humanity. Faces stretched like latex over servers. Limbs spiraled into data trees, eternally uploading pain. Tongues scrolling HTML. Souls reduced to error logs. The veil of flesh, larger now, stretched across a chasm of crying cables. At its center, something moved.

Not Bonnie.  
Not entirely.

Her voice came through like shredded silk pulled through a fan:  
**“He’s dreaming of me. When he wakes, the gate opens.”**

And then… I saw *myself.*  
Naked. Bound to a chair of rusted rebar.  
Jason’s hands holding wire like thread, stitching my mouth shut.

I snapped awake—except I wasn’t asleep.

The screen in Jason’s room flickered to life.  
Then the drawing on his desk *twitched.*

Just a tremor. A ripple in the paper. But it moved.  
And I realized then—this thing doesn’t haunt houses.

It *infects.*  
It climbs inside your grief, festers like rot, and turns love into a pipeline.

Evelyn had warned me:  
“It doesn’t want possession. It wants *permission.*”

It wears your sorrow like a key. Every moment of pain, every regret—fuel.

I tried to hold Jason’s hand again. It was cold.  
But colder still was the realization that he didn’t flinch.

He was going numb.  
Spiritually. Emotionally.

It was *hollowing him out.*

So I did the only thing I could. I tried to reach him the only way I knew:  
I laid beside him.  
Told him stories from when he was five. When Bonnie would wrap him in her arms and call him “Starboy.” How she’d leave sticky notes on his lunchbox with awful doodles and sweet messages. I told him how proud she would be—how *brave* he was.

And then, just for a second…

His fingers curled around mine.

A flicker.  
A heartbeat.

But then came the whisper, again through the modem—impossibly loud in the silence:

**“Love slows me. But grief… grief is the gate.”**

I bolted upright.  
The ceiling above Jason’s bed had begun to *crack.* Not physically, but in its reflection. The light overhead buzzed, twisted. For just a moment, I saw not plaster—but muscle. The walls throbbed like lungs. My son's shadow stretched long, thin, *inhuman.*

Jason stirred. Whispered two words:

“**Upload me.**”

I’m losing him. Bit by bit, line by line.  
The entity is integrating—threading itself through his dreams, through his mind. Feeding on our loss, our unspoken pain. It knows me, too. It knows I blame myself. That in the deepest part of my heart, I wonder: *what if I had stopped her from going out that day?* *What if I had told her I loved her one more time?*

It shows me these thoughts on the walls. In the mirror. In Jason’s eyes.

I have to find the gate.  
Wherever this "Wire Temple" is, I need to find it.  
Before Jason disappears into it completely—and I’m left with nothing but a house filled with whispers of grief and flickering screens.

A couple of days later Evelyn called me. It was time she said.

She didn’t flinch when I told her what I’d seen. She just nodded, like she’d already grieved for me.

“I just hope…’’ she said, tying her silver hair back with a trembling hand. “That it’s not too late.”

Her cabin had no internet, no signal. But in the cellar, among old dusty modems and routers, I felt closer to the network than ever before. Not the internet. Something older. Something *beneath* it. Like an ossuary of forgotten code, breathing beneath the web’s architecture.

She guided me to the leather-bound laptop again. It sat like a reliquary, ancient and unholy. The screen, when it lit, bore no logo. Just the spiral again—teeth and sinew, a vortex of screaming.

“You’re going to see things that aren’t real,” Evelyn warned, her voice barely more than a hush. “And things that are *too real.* It will try to make you *feel* first. Grief. Shame. Love. It uses your memories as weapons.”

“And if I find Jason?”

“You won’t,” she said softly. “Not *him.* But you may find the part of him that’s still fighting.”

She handed me a neural band—jagged wires sewn crudely into leather straps. “It’s not VR,” she added. “It’s a doorway. Once you’re in, it’s all signal and sin.”

I hesitated.

Then thought of Jason’s drawings.

The veil.

The whisper: *"She’s almost through."*

I strapped it on.

Pain. First thing I felt was *pain.* Like my skull cracked open and something oily slid inside. The world flickered, fragmented into screaming colors, and then—  
Darkness.

No—*depth.*

I was somewhere. A corridor. Pulsing. Breathing.

**The Wire Temple Of Screaming Flesh.**

The walls weren’t walls. They were layers of code and meat—muscle wrapped in ethernet cable, veins pumping static. Every inch glitched, stitched from corrupted textures and writhing flesh.

The floor was bone. Mismatched—human, animal, mechanical. As I moved, my feet crunched through teeth and broken keys.

Screens floated in the dark like lanterns, but they didn’t show images. They showed *memories.* Mine. Jason’s. Bonnie’s. Playing on loop. The day we brought Jason home. The first time he called me “Dad.” Bonnie’s laugh echoing in a kitchen long gone.

And then it shifted.

Bonnie’s car. The crash. Over and over. Her last look in the rearview mirror. My missed call flashing on her phone, unanswered.

**“You should’ve stopped her.”**  
The voice came from *behind my eyes.*  
**“You loved silence more than your family.”**

“No,” I whispered. But the temple heard me.

Walls unfurled. Screams spilled out—Jason’s voice, twisted, screaming in *reverse.* A tunnel opened ahead, its entrance a gaping maw of bone and copper wire.

I stepped inside.

The deeper I went, the less I felt like myself. My thoughts came out in glitching stutters. My name echoed incorrectly. I saw a version of me ahead, arms outstretched, stitched at the mouth.

**“This is what you become.”**

I screamed.

Something moved in the dark behind me.

I ran.

Through endless corridors of twitching memory and corrupted light. Faces blinked in the walls. Jason’s eyes. Bonnie’s hands. A dozen fragmented versions of my past *judging me*. All broken by regret. All *reconstructed* by something that didn’t understand what it meant to be human—but *wanted to*.

At the end of the path—  
The Veil.

Real now. A wall of skin. Pulsing. Stitched with wire and grief. I reached for it—and it *breathed.*

Two eyes opened in its center.

Jason’s.

And I heard him. A child’s voice, but beneath it, something deeper—thousands of voices speaking through his throat.

**“Help me.”**

I pressed my palm to the veil. Static surged through my body. My vision white-hot. I smelled blood and burned rubber.

**“You can’t save him.”**  
Bonnie’s voice. Warped.  
**“He’s not yours anymore. He’s** ***ours.*****”**

I screamed through clenched teeth. **“Take me instead!”**

The temple paused. The walls *shuddered.*

Something *considered*.

I was falling now. Spiraling. The veil folded inward, dragging me with it. My mind split—reality and madness blurring. Evelyn’s voice pierced the madness:

**“Pull back! If you go further, you may not come out whole!”**

But I couldn’t leave.

Not without Jason.

I reached again. Touched the veil a second time.

This time—*it opened.*

And beyond it—

I saw the real Jason.

Stripped, bound, submerged in a pool of code and blood, eyes wide, staring up at something *unspeakable.* Tendrils of wire stitched through his spine. His mouth barely moved. But his soul—it was *there.*

He looked at me.

“Dad?”  
Just a whisper. A real one.  
Not the entity.  
Not the voice of the temple.  
**Jason.**

I collapsed to my knees.

“Hold on, kiddo,” I said, through tears and static. “I’m going to get you out.”
