My life was good. I’m not bragging or whatever you want to accuse me of doing. I’m just stating a fact. My life still looks good. I have a good job, a home, I’m healthy. So what’s the problem?

My therapist is trying to frame me for murder.

Last night I was doing my regular jog around the neighborhood when I got a call from Pete. When I answered the phone, Pete went into beast mode.

“Annie, you should have never messed with me,” he said. I could feel the anger in his voice like slaps on my face. “Why did you do it?  I will never forgive you. You better watch your back.”

Pete is my colleague from my marketing job. I’m not his office wife or whatever, just a colleague. We are the heads of two different teams. Is there competition? In his head maybe. OK, we work for the same company, and sure, we are all happy with each other’s successes but there’s also the bonus thing. Whoever manages a better marketing campaign for their respective client, they get all kinds of perks including a cash bonus.

I work on non-fiction book marketing campaigns and so does Pete. Is he competitive? That’s what everyone says. I don’t really pay much attention to that kind of stuff. They call me bulldozer Annie. So honest that people get angry, so indifferent to everyone’s ill intentions I don’t feel a thing. Like a bulldozer demolishing buildings without a second thought and not giving a damn.

I don’t care. But now here I am, standing at my apartment’s front door.

My running clothes from last night? They are rolled up in the laundry basket still covered in mud and blood. The clothes I’m wearing now are clean and I’m office-ready. Muscle memory must have taken over.  All I can remember is standing in that park near my house in the torrential rain staring at Pete’s dead body.

And that wasn’t even the weirdest part.

At work everyone acts normal. Pete isn’t here of course. But no one seems to care? I don’t know. He wasn’t that unlikable. Why isn’t anyone saying anything? I’m not going to ask about him. That would be incriminating if they ever do find his body, right?

I’m going to grab a coffee. Maybe I’ll overhear someone talking about Pete or maybe someone will come asking, eager to gossip or whatever it is they do in the break room.

I got another flash of what happened last night as I took a sip of coffee earlier. I don’t think I had anything to do with Pete’s murder but I absolutely buried him. Maybe buried isn’t the right word. Pete is definitely well-hidden.

No one has come asking about anything. Not even why Pete didn’t show up at work. I’m on my way to see my therapist. I’m sure that man has something to do with all this. No. Scratch that. I know my therapist is trying to frame me for Pete’s murder. I just don’t know why or how he did it.

The worst mistake of my life was start seeing this damn therapist. I don’t want to go but I have to maintain my normal routine, right? To not raise any suspicions?
