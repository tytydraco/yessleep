**Begin transmission from \[REDACTED\], Quarantine Lvl 24**

*I’m back again. Sorry for the delay. Internet access has been spotty down here lately. For those of you new, please check my first two transmissions above.*

Colton was outside the cell. He wore a jumpsuit just like mine. His right hand was bandaged, the hand that had held the flip phone. But otherwise, he appeared unharmed. “It’s ok. You guys can come out.”

Abby emerged from her cell first. She stared at her boyfriend in astonishment, mouth agape. “You’re…”

Colton nodded.

Abby rushed to hug him. “I thought you were dead.”

Colton kissed her on the forehead. “It’s all right, babe. It was just a bad shock." He held up his bandaged hand. "I’m fine now.”

I got to my feet. “We heard gunshots.”

“I know.” Colton ushered me forward. “C’mon. I’ll explain on the way.”

I walked out of my cell. The hallway beyond was empty, nondescript and windowless, like so much else in the facility. Emergency lights illuminated the cramped space. There were a handful of other prison cells in the corridor. All of them empty.

“This way.” Colton led us in the opposite direction that Yumiko and her armed guards went earlier.

“Where are we going?” Abby asked.

“Getting the Hell out of here.”

Abby and I followed close behind, our eyes whipping in all directions, searching for other guards or prisoners.

“Were you locked up in here with us?” I asked.

“Not this ward,” Colton said. “I was in another section. But someone helped me break out. Another prisoner.”

“Who?” Abby asked.

“Ash," Colton said. "He worked here until he turned whistleblower and they locked him up. Seems even the employees were getting fed up with how this place is run.” A thin sheen of sweat covered Colton’s forehead. His eyes were wide. He looked amped, as if high on adrenaline. “Ash figured out a way to hack the locks in our ward.”

“Where’s Ash now?” Abby asked, a tad suspicious.

Colton’s face fell. I knew before he even said it. “He didn’t make it.”

“So they were shooting at you?” I thought of the gunshots we’d heard earlier. It had sounded like a war was raging in the next room over.

“A bunch of us got out at the same time,” Colton said. “Some fought back. Others ran. Like myself.”

We had reached the end of the hallway. Colton bent down and removed a metal panel near the floor. “I was lucky to make it.” He wiped the sweat from his forehead. “But Ash told me about a way we can sneak out.” He finished removing the panel, revealing a small dark tunnel beyond. It appeared to be some kind of access way full of tangled wiring. Barely big enough for any of us to squeeze through, least of all Colton.

“Through there?” Abby asked, her suspicion rising.

I crouched down. The access way was too dark to see where it led. The tunnel appeared to turn sharply to the right about a dozen feet inside. But what other choice did we have? We were criminals now and there were likely armed guards at every exit.  “Well. It’s not like we can walk out the front door,” I said.

Abby smirked. She stared into the passage. “You’re sure this was the right creepy-ass tunnel Ash had mentioned?”

“Yeah. He was real specific,” Colton said. “I know it looks tight, but…” Colton took a deep breath and squeezed his big shoulders through the entrance. Only his butt and feet were sticking out now. “If I can fit…” Then, the rest of him disappeared into the tunnel.I turned to Abby. “You go next. I’ll take up the rear. Just in case…” Abby sighed.

We crawled on all fours through the cramped passage, single file. Colton first, then Abby, then myself. I thought the drains could be claustrophobic, but this was much, much worse. The loose wiring felt like tiny snakes brushing up against my backside. I never wanted to bolt out of a place faster in my life. I kept fearing I’d get electrocuted, but it seemed none of the wires were live. Most of the building’s power was still out.

Fortunately, the tunnel didn’t last long. We rounded a few tight corners and then saw light up ahead. “Is that daylight?” I asked. I couldn’t see past Colton’s big frame.

“No. But we’re getting close.” Colton and Abby crawled out, giving me my first look at our destination. It appeared to be a vast space. There was a loud, periodic hissing noise. I couldn’t quite place it. Not until I crawled out of the tunnel.

“What the Hell?” We were in a massive chamber full of giant metal tubing. The room must have been hundreds of feet tall and God knows how wide. The endless tubing reminded me of those fun tunnel mazes you’d see in an indoor playground. Only these tunnels were made of gray featureless metal and many of them vented steam on a regular basis, the source of the hissing noise I’d heard in the access tunnel.

“Where are we?” Abby asked.

“Ash mentioned this place,” Colton said. “It’s the ventilation center. These tubes vent steam, wastewater, and various gasses from the core.”

“Where’s the way out?” I searched the area for an exit sign, but found none. There were no windows either. All light came from yellow emergency panels placed at various locations near the floor, leaving most of the room cloaked in shadow.

“Hmm… It’s…” Colton scanned our vicinity. “Through here.” He walked deeper into the room, his body disappearing behind some low-hanging pipes. They leaked condensation onto the concrete floor.

“Col. Wait.” Abby ran after him and I followed after.

“What?” Colton said, stopping.

“This doesn’t feel right,” Abby said. “It seems like we’re heading deeper into the power plant, not out of it.”

“This is the way Ash said.”

“Are you sure? How long were you even speaking to this man?”

“Our cells were right next to each other. He knows every inch of this place.”

“Jason.” Abby turned to me. “What do you think?”

Fuck! There it was again. Just like with the frogs in the drains earlier, I was the tie-breaker. “Abby, what other way would we take?”

“I don’t know. But this..." Her voice trailed off. She appeared deep in thought.

“Look, Ash knows this place inside and out,” Colton said. “Trust me. We’re going the right way.”

I looked at Abby. She seemed worried. And her intuition was almost never wrong.

“Jason. C’mon man," Colton said. "We’d be out of here by now if we didn’t stop to have his chat.”

I was still uncertain. We all stood there in silence for a beat.

Colton started walking further into the room. “You can follow if you want, but you better do it now. The guards will be searching here soon.”

As soon as Colton left, Abby pointed to a heavy-duty monkey wrench lying on the ground nearby. “Take that.”

“What?”

“Just in case...” I found it odd she didn’t ask her boyfriend to grab the weapon instead. Colton was obviously much stronger than myself. Perhaps her distrust wasn’t with Ash, but with him?

“Stay close,” Abby told me as we started to follow Colton.

I grabbed the wrench. The metal rod felt heavy and cold in my sweaty hands.

“Abby? Jason?”

“We’re coming,” Abby said.

I gripped the wrench, scared by the thought of using it. I’d never even been in a fight before. Now, here I was, holding a weapon capable of breaking bones. I won’t have to use it, I told myself. I kept repeating it over and over, like a mantra. Abby and I have been through a lot tonight. We’re just overly anxious. Colton is leading us out of here. We’re going home. My parents are gonna kill me and the cops will likely be waiting to arrest me, but I’ll deal with those things later. Let’s just get out of this creepy fucking place first.

“C'mon.” Colton sounded close, hidden behind a thick batch of tubing. His voice was slightly muffled by all the steam.

Abby was the first to pass through. I heard her gasp as soon as she arrived on the other side:

&#x200B;

“Oh my God!”

I ran ahead. Abby grabbed my arm as soon as I passed through, stopping me from going forward.

“What the…” We were standing in a charred section of the room. It was as if a massive fire had flowed through the space. Most of the tubing was melted. Liquified metal dripped on the floor.

“Colton!” Abby called out.

“Col!”

He was nowhere to be seen. It was so quiet. Too quiet. Then--

A sudden hacking cough drew our attention. It was coming from behind a nearby bulkhead.

“Colton?” We headed towards the noise. The voice sounded raspy, like someone struggling to breathe. Did Colton accidentally breathe in toxic fumes? I suddenly wished we had our N-95 masks again.

“Colton? Where are you?”

Abby and I crept toward the bulkhead. It was charred completely black, its melted surface lumpy and bulbous. As we drew closer, I saw the surface had a distinctive shape. It looked oddly familiar.

“Oh shit!” Abby jumped back. She was the first to notice.

I stepped closer. The coughing quickly turned into a pained groan, a groan of utter agony. Only then did I see a section of the bulkhead open up. A hole had formed on its charred surface. No. Not a hole…

&#x200B;

It was a MOUTH!

&#x200B;

The bulkhead had a mouth. And it was groaning. No, *screaming*! Up close, I could see the wall’s lumpy surface was in the shape of a human body. I could just make out the charred uniform with its circuit board symbol, the same symbol I saw in the drains and later in the ICU. We were right next to a power plant employee who had melted INTO the bulkhead. He was fused to the structure, but somehow still alive. A pair of bloodshot eyes opened, staring at Abby and I. Pleading for death. The SCREAMING reached a fever pitch.

“Fuck this!” Abby said.

We ran in the opposite direction, trying to get as far away from that monstrosity as possibly. But the screams followed us. There were dozens more people, all fused to the charred remains of walls and tubing. Abby and I kept turning in different directions, but we couldn’t find our way back. We were lost in a literal Hell.

“Oh, God. Colton?” Abby cried. “Where the fuck are you?”

I stared at the half-melted bodies surrounding us. Was Colton one of them? Had we entered some kind of chemical weapons testing area?

“I’m sorry you had to see this. Ash didn't mention this on the shortcut.”

Abby and I turned.

Colton was right behind us. He looked calm. Peaceful even. *But he was holding a handgun!* Colton held it in his right hand, the hand that had pressed the bomb trigger. He had removed the bandages on that hand, revealing charred flesh underneath. Colton’s burn had grown larger, creeping up his right arm.

“Oh Jesus, Colton,” Abby said, moving closer to my side.

“He didn’t mean to harm them,” Colton said. The fused people screamed louder now, as if Colton’s presence brought them more pain. “But they locked him up, torturing him day and night. Ash just wants to be free. Then, all of this will be over.”

My fingers gripped the wrench tighter, trying to keep my voice calm. “Col. Buddy… You’re— you’re unwell.”

“We need to get you out of here,” Abby said. “Get you to a hospital.”

“I’m unwell?” Colton grinned. His eyes glowed blue, like the fungus we’d seen earlier. Has something gotten into him? Infecting him? Was it going to infect us next?

“This world is unwell,” Colton said. “It’s been poisoned beyond all recognition. Look around you.” He gestured to the charred bodies crying out in the dark. “They are the sickness, poisoning everything. But we can stop it. We just have to free him.”

“Free who?”

“ASH,” Colton bellowed. “He showed me a way to end all of this. To bring the Earth back to how it was before we started destroying it.”

“Baby… Please. Drop the gun,” Abby said. “Let’s just get out of here.”

“Drop the gun, Colton,” I added.

Colton let out a heavy sigh. “Fine,” he said, squeezing the weapon in his charred hand. In seconds, the gunmetal turned into molten liquid, dripping onto the concrete floor. It was completely destroyed.

*“You can melt with the rest of them.”* Colton lunged at us.

I swung the monkey wrench as hard I could—

But Colton caught it in his burnt hand. I felt intense heat, like I’d just touched boiling water. I immediately let go of the wrench, moments before it turned to molten lead.

“RUN!”

Abby and I sprinted away, ducking under nearby tubing. We ran deeper into the maze, passing burned out sections of piping, charred computer stations, melted walls. All the while, sounds of crashing metal followed us. Colton… He was gaining on us. The ground rumbled like an earthquake.

“Where are we going?”

“I don’t know,” I said. I didn’t care. So long as we remained alive and weren’t melted into the walls like the other poor souls around us.“Jason!” Abby pointed towards a door in the far corner. It had a bright red sign over it marked EXIT. *Finally.* We beelined for the door. But we didn’t get far. Colton’s path of destruction behind us had caused a series of pipes to burst overhead, spilling hot wastewater everywhere. Abby and I tried out-running the torrent, but it quickly overtook us, causing us to slip and fall into the sloshing mess. The water was warm, dirty. And bitter. Some of it got in my mouth as I struggled to catch my breath. “Abby?” I cried out. But she was lost in the deluge. The water kept carrying me, all the way to the opposite end of the room, where a group of hulking figures stood.

A gloved hand grabbed me, pulling me out of the torrent. I briefly saw Colton charging through the flooded building, headed right for me when—

WOOOOOSH!

A huge cloud of icy smoke overtook him. Colton staggered. Ice crystals formed on his face and hands.

I looked to my side. One of the plant’s security guards had grabbed me, her face obscured by a gas mask and her body covered in tactical armor. Another guard stood beside her, holding what appeared to be some kind of massive flamethrower. Only instead of flame, this weapon spewed billowing clouds of icy smoke that enveloped Colton. He had stopped moving.

“I’m sorry you had to see this,” a filtered voice said. It was the person who had pulled me up. Her voice sounded familiar.

“Yumiko?”

The woman nodded. She was the power plant’s owner! “You can stop now,” Yumiko told her partner. The guard turned off his ice-thrower and the white clouds surrounding Colton dissipated. He had turned into a giant icicle. Everything went quiet again. The rushing torrent had finally calmed, leaving the whole room flooded under three feet of smelly wastewater.

“Is he dead?” I asked, staring at Colton's frozen face.

“No,” Yumiko said. “The entity is merely dormant. For now.”

“The Entity? That’s our friend. Abby and I… Oh God…” I looked around the flooded room, suddenly realizing that Abby was nowhere in sight. *Did she drown?* “Abby? ABBY!”

“We’ll find her,” The other guard said, his voice also filtered through a gas mask. “The wastewater drains into a series of sluice gates at the edges. She probably fell into one of them.”

“We need to find her and get the Hell out of—”

“What we need to do now is secure the plant’s core,” Yumiko said. “It’s become unstable." She turned to me. "And you’re coming with us.”

“What? This isn’t a fucking power plant,” I said, anger bubbling. “This is— this is— fucked. You’ve got people locked up in here, torturing them. Someone named Ash—”

Yumiko grabbed my arm, her voice worried. “He told you about Ash?”

“Yeah. Colton said you locked up one of your employees and were torturing him,” I said. “He wanted to free Ash.”

“Ash isn’t a person," Yumiko said. "Ash is the power plant’s core. Our fuel source.”

“Ash is some kind of fuel?”

Yumiko let out a long, pained sigh. Then she said… “Ash is a demon.”
