(Video starts rolling)

Clint: "Aaaand we are live. Cass, could you tell us more about what we're doing today?"

Cass: "Well, Clint, today we are exploring the street that may people fear at night, [REDACTED] street! This street is known for it's sightings of a man in a trench coat lurking around here. He is said to be at least 8 feet tall and stays in the shadows a lot. He wears a hat so you can't really see his face, and he leaves "gifts" for people who live on this street occasionally, ranging from toys to furniture. No one knows why or who he is, but today we'll find out on another episode of [REDACTED] Adventurers!"

Clint: "W-wait. Hold on, Cass. You can't say another episode. This is the first one."

Cass: "Ugh, fine. Just cut this part out later. Today we'll find out on the first episode of [REDACTED] Adventurers!" 

(Video shows them walking on a lonely street. No one is around except them)

Cass: "As you can see here, no one is around. A few people have gone missing or gotten injuries on this street, and many people think that it's because of this man. Locals call him the Deceiving Gifter, because although he gives gifts, he is also suspected to cause all those missing people and injuries on this street. Turn on the night vision, Clint. We're going into his territory now."

(The screen now becomes green with more clarity in the footage)

Cass: (Whispering) "Locals say that he doesn't like loud sounds, so we have to keep extra quiet when going into his abode. He is often seen in this allyway and another one down the street a few blocks. Let's see if we can catch a sighting of him."

(The camera pans around the alleyway. Numerous dumpsters can by seen)

Cass: (Whispering) "Guys, I found something. Look!"

(She holds a box neatly wrapped with wrapping paper. It doesn't seem like it belongs here, and the camera moves out of the alleyway)

Cass: "Let's open it up and see what's inside!"

Clint: "Um, Cass, I don't think that's a good idea."

Cass: "Why not?"

Clint: "What if this isn't meant for us? Like, it could be the gift he was gonna give to another person."

Cass: "Oh, don't be such a worrywart. I'm sure it's fine!"

(Cass opens the box, and her playful smile is quickly wiped away. She turns to Clint)

Cass: "Is this some kind of sick joke? Did you put this there?"

Clint: "What are you talking about?"

(Cass holds up the thing inside the box to Clint)

Cass: "This doll. Did you ask Hank to make this? As some kind of sick joke?"

(Closer inspection shows that the doll is an almost exact likeliness of Cass.)

Cass: "There's even a note in here. 'I hope you like this present. I've been watching you for a while to get the details right.' Is this some kind of sick joke you and Hank planned to pull on me?"

Clint: "Wha- no Cass, I would never do that."

(Laughing is heard. The camera is turns to find the Deceiving Gifter standing in an adjacent alleyway. The camera turns back to Cass, whose face is pale with shock.)

Cass: "Clint. Let's go."

(The camera turns back to the Gifter, who is closer now.)

Cass: "Dammit, Clint, let's go!"

(The camera shakes violently as they run. The camera stops, and it is revealed that Clint has picked up a brick to throw at the Gifter)

Clint: "Take that! Wait. Wha-?"

(The ribbon holding the trench coat together falls loose, revealing two rows of teeth set in a pitch black torso. It is frowning as if annoyed)

Cass: "Clint! JUST KEEP RUNNING!"

(The camera is dropped as we see Cass and Clint run away. The Gifter kicks the camera away while chasing them and turns it off)

POLICE REPORT:
A teenager by the name of Clint Dempsey reported being chased by an entity on [REDACTED] St. known as the Deceiving Gifter. He claimed that another teenager, Cassidy Shay, was with him, but he did not know where she was as he was focused on running. When police went to investigate, they found a camera belonging to Clint Dempsey on the street. In an alleyway between blocks [REDACTED], multiple dolls were found. Each doll was noted to capture the likeliness of a kid or teenager that lived in [REDACTED], with all the dolls being different. When Cassidy Shay's home was searched, a doll resembling her was found on her bed, which was neatly made despite her mother saying that no one had gone into her room since she left. Police are still investigating the street for suspicious characters, and missing persons posters have been put up for Cassidy Shay.
