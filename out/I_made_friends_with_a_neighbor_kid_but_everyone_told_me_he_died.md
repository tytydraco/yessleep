I have only ever told this story to very close friends of mine who I trust won't take me to grippy sock jail (the psychiatric hospital), because even I have trouble accepting that this was an experience I had.

I grew up going back and forth from my moms house in Dayton Ohio, to my dad's house in Waynesville Ohio. Waynesville is, allegedly, the haunted capital of the Midwest, and considering the multiple supernatural experiences I had at both my dad and grandmother's houses, I feel confident that they are correct. My dad's house, which he shared with my uncle and baby cousin, was incredibly old, with dark wood paneling, ramshackle wooden floors that creaked with every step, old school door knobs with the keyhole locks, and dimmer switches in every room that they had put in some time during the 90s. 
   
One day, when I was about 8 years old, my mother dropped me off at my dad's house for the weekend before she headed to work.  I was a tomboy most of my childhood, so I practically lived outside in the dirt, and that day was no different. As was my routine, I dropped my backpack on the floor, ran upstairs to change out of my school clothes, and went to the backyard. The only thing that sucked about going to my dad's was that we weren't very close and there were no other kids on my block, so most of the time I had to play by myself. 
   
My favorite backyard activity was making "potions" out of mud, water, and assorted weeds or rocks that I would find on the ground. While I was making my potion and humming to myself, I started to feel like I was being watched. When I looked up, there was a boy about my age standing on the other side of the fence. He was tan, with bright blue eyes and dirty blonde hair, dressed in shorts and a striped red and blue t-shirt. He didn't seem mean, but I can remember I  was a little creeped out that he was just standing there, fingers laced through the chain link, watching me intently. My creeps dissipated after a few minutes though, because they were replaced with excitement that I might be able to make a friend.
   
I waved at him, and he gave a shy wave back. I got up from my spot in the dirt and walked over to the fence. "What's your name?" I asked excitedly. He took a few seconds before he replied with a very soft "Robert, but i go by Robby". 
   
I asked him if he just moved in, because I remembered seeing a U-Haul truck parked in front of the house next door the weekend before. "yeah, I moved here with my mom." He said. My excitement grew. I would no longer have to spend my time at my dads alone! 

"Do you want to come play over here?" I asked.

"Sure" he replied meekly, cracking a small half smile. I met him at my gate, let him in, and we spent the rest of the day making potions and mud pies, catching bugs, talking about school and making weird noises to make each other laugh. When the sun was setting behind the trees, my dad called for me to come in and wash up for dinner. I said good bye to my new friend, and went inside for the night.
   
From then on, Robby and I had a routine. Every weekend, I would get dropped off at dad's house, and every day like clockwork, he would be standing at my back gate waiting for me to come let him in. He never went in my yard without me meeting him there, and I figured it was just because he was polite. We would play and talk and laugh for hours until inevitably, my dad would call for me to come in for dinner. 
   
I began to notice some things about Robby. He always seemed wet, which I assumed meant he had just been outside running around a lot and working up a sweat. I also never met his mom. She never called for him to come in to dinner like my dad did, and I never saw her face poking through the curtains to check on him the way my dad and uncle would do, although sometimes I would see her getting in her car to go somewhere. And although he was clearly having fun when we were together, he was always very quiet, even when he laughed. Almost as if the loudest he could physically speak was a whisper. None of this ever bothered me enough to ask him about though, because I was just glad I had a real friend. Maybe even a best friend. We went on like this for months, well into the summer. It got to the point where every Friday I was impatiently counting down the hours until I got dropped off so I could go play with Robby.
   
Then, one Friday evening, I ran out to my backyard to find that Robby was not standing at my back gate. I was confused, to say the least. I had gotten so used to seeing him standing there, waiting patiently for me to let him into the yard with his fingers twisted up in the chain link. After sitting and waiting on my steps for him for almost an hour, I decided I would go next door and get him. I walked up the front stairs to his house, opened the screen door, and knocked. After a couple of minutes with no answer, I knocked again. His mom's car was parked on the street, so I knew they had to be home. After several more minutes I decided to knock one more time, as hard as I could. Maybe they couldn't hear me the first time. I finally heard the lock twist, and the door opened just a crack. Robby's mom stood in the crack, poking her head just far enough through that I could see her face. Her hair disheveled, large purple circles set deep in nearly translucent skin, she peered down at me with confusion. She said nothing, just looked at me as if she were waiting for me to speak.

"Hi!" I said 

"Hello, can I help you?" She said, still a confused expression on her face.

"I was wondering if Robby could come out and play. I haven't seen him today." I said excitedly.

The confused expression on her face rearranged into that of horror, followed by anger. She gripped the edge of the door til her knuckles turned white.

"Get away from this house and don't you EVER come knocking on my door again." Her voice shook. 

She shut the door hard, and now my face was the one twisted in confusion. I walked back to my house, wondering why she was so mad. Maybe Robby has gotten in trouble, and his mom was in a bad mood.
The next morning, I heard a knock downstairs and ran to my window to see who it was. It was Robby's mom. My dad answered the door, and I heard them talking intensely about something. 15 minutes later I watched her walk back over to her house and heard my dad walking up the stairs toward my room. He came in and asked if he could talk to me.
  
We sat on my bed. Staring at him, I wondered why he seemed so... disturbed. My dad was not a very nice man, and we had barely anything in common, but the way he was acting was somehow more awkward and uncomfortable than usual.

"You know that lady that lives next door?" He asked me.

"Yeah!" I replied. "That's Robby's mom!"
He pinched the bridge of his nose and took a deep breath. I started to worry.

"I'm not sure how to say this, or how you know his name, but Robert passed away about 3 years ago."

My stomach dropped. There was no way. I had played with Robby every weekend for months.

"What do you mean? We play all the time!" I said with tears welling in my eyes. It wasn't like my dad to play practical jokes, that was my uncle's thing. And this was NOT a funny joke. Robby was as real and as solid as I was, had a voice as real as my own.

My dad went on to explain that the boy I new as Robby, the boy I had caught lightening bugs with, had told about my pet cats and my school bully, had met every single Friday at my gate, had drowned a few summers ago on a trip to the lake with his family. After he passed, his mom and dad were never the same and ultimately ended up divorcing. That was why she had moved next door. 

I spent the next few weekends waiting patiently on my back steps for Robby to come back. I couldn't accept what my dad told me. I felt like if I could just see him again and ask, he would tell me I was crazy and laugh and we could go back to playing together like nothing ever happened. But Robby never came back, and after long enough I stopped checking the windows and waiting on my steps.

To this day I still struggle with these memories. Did I make it up? Was my childhood so rough that my brain was projecting images of little kids to make me feel less alone and misunderstood? But then, how was I able to touch him? How was he able to touch me?

 I'd like to think I've made peace with most of it, although even now, 17 years later, I can't shake the feeling that it was real. If I close my eyes now, I can still see him, clear as day. His sweaty blonde hair pushed out of his tanned face, hands twisted up in the chain link of my old fence. I feel the warmth of that fated summer day. And I smile.
