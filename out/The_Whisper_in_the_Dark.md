But from the start I felt an inexplicable tension in the air. The hut's wood cracked to the rhythm of the wind, and I could hear the soft whispering of the trees.  
  
I couldn't sleep the first night. I lay awake in bed staring into the darkness. A strange whisper came through the walls of the hut. It was as if small voices were talking to each other, but I couldn't make out clear words.  
  
The next few days passed in a spooky mood. Again and again I heard the soft whisper, as if it would haunt me. I tried to convince myself it was just the wind or my own imagination, but the tension wouldn't let go.  
  
One evening, as darkness fell, the whispers grew louder and more urgent. It was as if it wanted to tell me something. I followed the sounds through the corridors of the hut and eventually came to a small room at the back. The door was open a crack and the whisper seemed to come from there.  
  
With shaky hands, I opened the door fully and stepped inside. The room was empty, but the whisper was louder than ever. It seemed to come from the walls themselves, from the faded wallpaper and the creaking floorboards.  
  
"Come closer," whispered a voice in my head. I felt an irresistible urge to follow her. Step by step I advanced until I was standing in front of an old mirror hanging on the wall. The whisper seemed to be coming from him, and I could see my own twisted features in it.  
  
Suddenly the whispers began to clear, as if becoming clear words. "Release me," whispered the voice from the mirror. "You locked me here and I demand my freedom."  
  
I stared at the mirror in bewilderment. "Who are you?" I asked in a trembling voice.  
  
"I am a soul trapped," answered the voice. "I was cast into this mirror a long time ago and I long for the world beyond the glass."  
  
The words echoed in my head. I could hear the desperation in the voice, but at the same time I felt an eerie darkness emanating from her.  
  
"Please release me," the voice pleaded again.  
  
I hesitantly reached out and touched the cold mirror. A stabbing pain ran through my body, as if a thousand needles pricked me at the same time. I wanted to withdraw my hand, but I was frozen, unable to move.  
  
The voice began to laugh - a sneering, frightening laugh. "You gave me freedom," she whispered. "Now I will lock you up in my world."  
  
Suddenly everything around me went dark. I felt myself being grabbed by an invisible force and pulled into the mirror. The world around me blurred into an infinite black and I felt myself slowly losing control.  
  
The days passed, but there was no more time for me. I was trapped in the dark world of the mirror, a place of whispers and darkness. My mind was invaded by the alien presence and I could only exist in an endless nightmare.  
  
In the real world, the mirror was back on the wall and the cabin was silent. But the whispers remained, an eerie wisp on the wind that reminded anyone who passed of the unfortunate soul trapped in her murky prison.
