Money was tight. Rent overdue, fridge empty, and desperation led me to a seedy listing buried in the depths of a job board: 

***Lighting Tech Needed—One Night Only. Cash Payment.*** 

The gig was on the outskirts of Prague, in a crumbling pre-war building that reeked of mildew and decay. The strange thing, it wasn’t for Woodman, LP, or any other known Czech studio. No glossy logos. This was something else entirely, something hidden. It felt off the moment I arrived, but desperation kept me from turning back.

Inside, the “set” was grotesque: tattered black curtains hung from rusted hooks, and the centerpiece was a hulking machine—a twisted amalgam of metal arms and stained gears. It looked like a deranged blacksmith’s fever dream.

The director greeted me, tipping his weathered cowboy hat—Tom Six looking goofy ass. He had this manic, oddball energy, like someone who’d been awake for days on too much Red Bull and bad ideas. 

*“Welcome to the big leagues!”* he said, clapping me on the back. 

His clothes were stained and he carried himself with the casual swagger of someone who didn’t take much seriously.

*“Don’t overthink it guys,”* he added with a grin. *“They’re here for the show. We’re just the crew.”*

The actors trickled in soon after, their jittery demeanor masked by fake smiles and exaggerated laughs. They were attractive in a typical way—sculpted oiled bodies, perky tits, dead pretty eyes—and seemed familiar with the routine. 

Strip, perform, fuck & moan. 

I didn’t ask questions when they started filming the sex scenes. It was just standard grinding fare—until it wasn’t.

The cameras caught my eye: old-school Sony HVR-Z7E units, each retrofitted with thick, black cables that snaked into the machine at the center of the room. 

*“We shoot in HD here,”* the director joked, his laugh too loud, his eyes too wide. *„There’s something about 00 bling-bling era porn aesthetic.. that can’t be replicated”*

Once the actors finished their scenes, the crew stepped in. Most were stone-faced, silent, avoiding eye contact. But a few looked as horrified as I felt, their hands trembling as they adjusted the lights or steadied the camera rigs. 

One whispered to me, 

*“This isn’t normal. They didn’t tell us about... that thing.”*

The director’s voice cut through the tension. 

*“Alright, folks, time for the final cut! Places, everyone!”*

The actors, still catching their breath from their performances, were ushered to the contraption. They giggled nervously, thinking it was some kind of prop. Then the machine roared to life.

Hooks on chains shot out, faster than the actors could react, embedding deep into their shoulders, thighs, and ribs. 

The first man screamed as the hooks yanked him into the air, his feet kicking helplessly. His scream turned to a guttural howl when a series of spinning blades extended and began flaying the flesh from his torso in long, wet ribbons.

The second actor, a woman, tried to run, but a clawed appendage snagged her ankle, snapping the bone with a sickening crunch. She collapsed, clawing at the floorboards, as the machine dragged her into its maw. A second claw gripped her by the scalp, tearing tufts of hair free as it hoisted her upright. Needles on mechanical arms jabbed into her forearms and neck, injecting something that made her convulse violently.

*“Now this is fucking cinema!”* the director cackled. 

Another man was lifted by his jaw, the hook puncturing beneath his chin and emerging through his tongue. He gurgled, blood pooling in his mouth and dribbling down his chest as the machine twisted his head at an unnatural angle to expose his throat. A circular saw descended, its edge glinting under the harsh lights, and began carving slowly through his neck. The sound of shredding cartilage and popping vertebrae filled the air before his severed head tumbled into a waiting chute.

The woman, still convulsing, was impaled through her stomach by a spiked rod, which then split apart like the petals of a grotesque flower. Her innards spilled out, steam rising from the slick coils as the rod jerked her body upward, her legs twitching spasmodically.

A crew member vomited in the corner. 

I tried to leave, but the exits were locked. The director slapped me on the back again. 

*“Don’t worry and just enjoy the show.”*

Another appendage with pincers scuttled toward the first man, who was now missing most of his skin. It gripped his ribcage, the pincers tightening until the brittle bones cracked and snapped apart. His lungs were exposed, quivering like raw meat, before they were punctured and pulled free, still faintly expanding and contracting as they were deposited into the churning pit below.

The pit itself was a nightmare—a swirling mass of jagged gears and razor-sharp teeth that ground the discarded remains into a wet, pulpy sludge. The blood-soaked slurry sprayed against the walls, dripping down in thick rivulets, as the machine processed the actors’ shredded flesh and bones into an unrecognizable mush.

One of the final actors, her arm dangling by a thread of sinew, was dragged toward a pair of opposing rollers covered in spikes. The rollers spun rapidly, catching her body and feeding it through inch by inch. Her screams were high-pitched and desperate as the spikes punctured her torso, crushing bones and squeezing out viscous streams of blood and tissue.

Throughout it all, the director stood nearby me, leaning casually against camera rigs, sipping from a flask. He occasionally shouted notes to the crew, his voice cheerful, almost jovial, over the orchestra of agony. The machine never faltered, its cruel precision ensuring no part of the actors was wasted.

When the last body disappeared into the pit, the machine ground to a halt. The room fell silent, except for the wet drip of blood. 

I stared into the camera preview to just try to keep my composure - lense still fixed on the carnage and noticed a small, engraved logo on the metal machinery. 

   
***ARTISAN TECH — Create Without Compromise.*** 

My stomach twisted. That name—I’d seen it scrawled in the margins of forums, attached to stories too grotesque to be real. But they were real.

The director noticed my expression and chuckled. *“They custom-made this beauty for us.”* He patted the machine, which groaned like it was alive.

My throat was dry, but I managed to ask, 

*“Why? Why.. do this?”*

He shrugged. *“Some rich degenerates get bored with normal. They want something… transformative. Something unforgettable. We deliver. It’s just a job. Don’t make it more than it is. You will forget bout all the touchy stuff and come back for more gigs, trust me”*

I scanned the room for allies. The vomit-streaked crew member was shaking, clutching a light stand like it might protect him. Another had retreated to the shadows, eyes darting toward the exit. But the rest? They were in on it—calmly packing up equipment, wiping blood off the lenses, and chatting like it was any other wrap.

One of them, a wiry woman with a cigarette dangling from her lips, caught me staring. 

*“First day, huh? You’ll get used to it—or you won’t. Either way, you’ll be back. They always come back.”*

I didn’t respond. My mind was racing, searching for a way out. The director called for cleanup, and two men in hazmat suits wheeled in a metal drum. They dumped the machine’s bloody remains into it, sealing the lid with practiced efficiency.

*“Alright, folks,”* the director said, clapping his hands. *“That’s a wrap! Drinks on me—unless you’re driving the drum to the drop-off point. You know the drill.”*

The crew laughed. I didn’t. I edged toward the door, trying to look casual.

*“Hey”* the director called out. My heart stopped.

He walked over, grinning. *“Listen, you’ve got potential. Just stick around, and maybe next time, you can handle the main bad boi. Artisan tech’s not for amateurs, but I think you’ve got what it takes.”*

I nodded, mumbling some excuse about needing fresh air. He let me go with a pat on the back, but I could feel his eyes on me as I slipped out the door.

Outside, the air was cold and sharp. The old building loomed behind me like a rotting tooth. I kept walking, my legs unsteady, until I was far enough away to breathe again.

I should’ve gone straight to the police, but what could I say? That I worked on a snuff film funded by dark web lunatics and powered by a machine with the Artisan’s signature? They’d laugh me out of the station—or worse, think I was complicit.

So I went home, locked the door, and tried to sleep. 

But every time I closed my eyes, I saw those actors—smiling, laughing, oblivious—dragged screaming into the machine.

And in the corner of my mind, a whisper: *They always come back.*
