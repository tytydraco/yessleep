Years have passed since that night. Years since everything stopped and, at the same time, began haunting me. I have never told anyone about this; I don’t even know how to put it into words without feeling the air grow heavier, the walls closing in around me. But I can’t stay silent anymore. This is what happened… what truly happened. I’m telling you because… I need to free myself.

Mafe and I were kids, inseparable for as long as I can remember. She was my best friend, my sister from another life. We were always together, always. Until that day came, the one where everything changed forever. It all started in a park near our homes. We had gone out to play as usual, carefree, fearless. But then we saw him: a man. His face was strange, deformed, as if pain itself had carved every line of his expression. At first, we didn’t think much of him, but his presence was… unsettling.

He approached us, and the next thing I remember is the cold. Cold on my skin, in my chest, in my mind. He took us—I don’t know how, I don’t know why. He took us to a dark, filthy place, filled with a silence heavier than any scream. We were just two terrified kids, and he… he enjoyed it. I didn’t understand what he wanted from us, why he had chosen us. But when he started to speak, everything became clearer. He wasn’t just seeking pain; he wanted something more: control, obedience… submission.

And then came the moment I will never forget, the moment that has haunted me ever since. He looked at Mafe and me as if deciding who would be his “favorite… his little kitten.” He told us only one of us would leave that place unharmed. And I… God, I was so scared. In my desperation, in my selfishness, I did something unforgivable. I begged him, pleaded with him to let me go. I told him I’d do whatever he wanted, that I wouldn’t tell anyone, but to let me leave. And then, with that twisted smile, he pointed at Mafe.

\- “She stays. You can go, but remember: you will never escape this.”

I don’t know how I got out of there. I ran until my legs couldn’t carry me anymore, until the whole world became a blur of shadows and tears. When I woke up, I was back at the park, and Mafe… Mafe was there too. But she wasn’t the same. She was motionless, her clothes neatly folded beside her head, her gaze empty. She was naked, her body covered in cuts… I lost my breath, my lungs stopped working properly. I… dressed Mafe as best as I could, holding back my tears, crying for my friend. She didn’t react, and I passed out shortly after.

We woke up in the hospital, surrounded by our families. Mafe didn’t remember anything. The adults never told us what happened. They asked me not to talk about it, to bury it for Mafe’s sake. She didn’t know what had happened… I thought it would be better that way, that she wouldn’t have to carry it, that I wouldn’t hurt her more than I already had. Mafe… she had her memories taken away, or maybe her mind did it for her. She never knew what really happened that night. She never knew I was the one who left her behind.

Life went on—or so it seemed. But then the calls began, first for me. Always the same voice, always the same words: “Remember the screams, remember the tears…” Years later, he started calling her too. That’s when I knew he had never finished with us, that this wasn’t just a game. And I… I never told Mafe the truth. I never told her that I was the one who betrayed her. I never told her that every time the phone rang, my heart stopped because I knew one day he would come for her again. And he did.

It was a gray afternoon, as if the sky knew what was about to happen. Mafe and I met in the park… she wanted answers I couldn’t give her. She knew I was hiding something, that I knew who was behind those calls. We… decided to search, to investigate… and we got too close, so close that we fell into that man’s game again. He found us, took us to a warehouse, and… I don’t know how he knew I had been keeping silent all this time. He forced me to tell Mafe everything—to confess how I had left her behind, how I had chosen to run and leave her with him.

Something in her broke with that revelation, and I don’t blame her. I know I deserved everything that happened next. The man tied me up, stripped me… using a scalpel. All while Mafe was forced to watch. He slid the instrument across my body, saying things… things I could no longer hear. Until Mafe—Mafe started approaching me. This time, she was my executioner. The man encouraged her, forced her, but there was something in her… it was as if something had shattered, and there was no turning back. Mafe, my friend, was the one who made cuts on my skin, the same cuts she had, the same suffering she had endured… now I was living it. It was his twisted way of “balancing the scales.”

Mafe made a deal. She stayed, and I was set free. She struck a deal with that man to release me, to return me to the park. And it was her who stayed with him. You can’t imagine how much I screamed, how much I cried, how much I begged Mafe to leave with me, to think of a way to escape together, to… not stay with him. But it was useless. She said she couldn’t go back after discovering the abyss he had shown her.

The last thing I heard from Mafe was: “Don’t say anything, Valeria. We wouldn’t want to have to come back for you. You know he’ll be watching you.”

They left me unconscious in the park. I woke up the next day, my clothes neatly folded above my head. Everything was blurry; I wasn’t fully awake yet. From afar, I saw them—Mafe and that… cursed man. She was holding a phone to her ear, making a call… My body gave out, and I fainted again. I remember very well how, with half-closed eyes and blurred vision, I saw them disappear among the trees, and my world crumbled.

Since then, everyone believes Mafe is missing, that someone kidnapped her, that I, by some miracle, managed to escape… An ambulance arrived at the park and took me to the hospital. I declared… I declared that a man had kidnapped us and that I… had managed to escape. Just as Mafe wanted. I have never told the truth. I have never said what really happened. And now I live with that weight, with that secret eating away at me every day. Mafe chose to stay, and she chose for me to live.

But not a day goes by that I don’t wonder if I should truly be alive, if I truly escaped, if… Mafe is still watching me, and if… that man… if that man will come for me. 

What should I do? What should I have done?
