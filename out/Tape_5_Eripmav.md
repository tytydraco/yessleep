[Part 4](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/NP6FE6W5W7)

*A fence with a metal gate is shown, an older looking man approaches it.*

*The man opens the gate and reveals a large cow pasture, there's about fifty cows walking on the pasture.*

*The cows themselves look to be very well taken care off, some of them are eating fresh grass, while the others are drinking water from the water troughs.*

*While most of the cows seem to be carefree and perfectly healthy, one of the cows is standing far away from them and looks extremely sick, it is far skinnier than the rest of the group, a swarm of flies is hovering over it's head.*

*The man approaches the ill cow, it seems to look even worse up-close, the poor animal looks like it's lucky to even be alive, the sickly cow doesn't even seem to notice the man as it stares at the fence, it's eyes are foggy and white.* 

*Sorrow appears on the man's wrinkly face, he takes a look at the nearest water trough, the water inside seems to be tainted, the liquid's color seems to be pale red.*

*The man immediately drains the water trough, then he hastily cleans it and fills it up with fresh water.*

*The man takes out a phone out of his pocket and makes a call.*

Man: It's an emergency, I need you here right now, Jack!

*He quickly ends the call and waits.*

*Not even five minutes pass, a muscular man wearing a cowboy hat and black rubber boots joins the old man.*

Jack: Hey there, Abe! What's the problem?

Abe: Well, take a look for yourself!

*Abe points at the sickly cow.*

*Jack takes a look at the unfortunate cow.*

Jack: Jesus! What the hell happened here?

Abe: I have no idea, first time I've ever seen anything like this. Bessy was as healthy as ever yesterday, now look at her! She's barely hanging on.*

*Abe takes a deep breath.*

Abe: She won't last more than a day. Please, just end her suffering.*

*Jack pats Abe's shoulder.*

Jack: Go take a rest, I'll take care of Bessy, she'll pass peacefully, I promise.

Abe: I appreciate it.

*Abe hands the gate key to Jack.*

Jack: I'll return the key to you after I finish up here, it won't take too long.

*Abe leaves the pasture.*

*It seems like a couple of hours have passed, Abe is sitting in a rocking chair and holding a glass of whisky.*

*The doorbell rings.*

*Abe quickly leaves his drink on the nearby table and rushes to open the front door.*

*He opens the door and sees Jack.*

Jack: I've taken care of old Bessy, I'm sorry it had to come to this.

Abe: Thank you, old friend. I've just opened a good bottle of scotch, why don't you join me? 

Jack: Can't say no to that!

*Jack enters Abe's home.*

*Abe leads Jack to his small living room, Abe pours Jack a glass of expensive looking scotch whisky.*

*The friends seem to enjoy each other's company, they chat about various topics and seem to enjoy the whisky.*

*Hours pass, Jack looks at the silver watch on his wrist.*

Jack: It's already so damn late, time flies when you're having fun! Unfortunately, I can't stay any longer, have to fix the old tractor, can't really do that without getting some shut-eye.

Abe: That's a shame.

*The two friends sit up and approach the front door.*

*As soon as Abe opens the door, the sound of cattle in distress is heard, the cows are mooing loudly.*

Abe: Seems like luck is still not on my side. 

*Abe goes to the living room and grabs a hunting rifle, he quickly hurries back.*

Abe: I'll bring this old thing, just in case!

Jack: Sounds good, I'll watch your back.

*The two friends quickly walk towards the pasture gate, the mooing is getting louder and more frantic.*

*Abe unlocks the gate, the two friends hastily open the gate and enter the pasture.*

*As soon as they look in the direction of the frightened cows, they are met with a dreadful sight.*

*A skinny, dark red intruder is standing beside the water trough and cutting it's wrists deeply with it's long sharp nails, even though the creature looks to be 1.8 feet tall, the creature's arms are lanky and incredibly long, if fully extended they seem to be able to touch the ground. The creature's head is humanlike, but it doesn't have even one hair on it, even the eyebrows are missing.*

*It's wrists bleed heavily, dark red blood drips into the water and slowly gives the water a reddish hue.*

*Most of the cows continue running in circles and mooing frantically, but five of them start drinking the contaminated water.*

*The two friends stare in disbelief as the cows rapidly ingest the bloody water.*

*As soon as the cows stop drinking the water, their eyes become pearly white, their pupils seemingly disappear.*

*The creature stops cutting itself and looks at the five cows, the animals obediently look at the creature, seemingly hypnotized.*

*Abe grabs the hunting rifle and skillfully aims it at the disturbing intruder, he shoots one bullet and hits the creature straight in the head.*

*The bullet passes through the creature's forehead as blood gushes out of the open wound, the five cows scramble to lick the spilled blood.*

*Surprisingly, the creature easily shrugs off the damage, it doesn't even react to the wound.*

*Seemingly amused, the creature looks at Abe while it's wound rapidly heals, not even ten seconds pass and the wound completely disappears.*

*The creature smiles while looking at Abe, it's smile is unnaturally wide, it is then that I notice a disturbing feature of the mysterious intruder, it has no teeth.*

*The creature extends it's eerily long arm and points at Abe and Jack.*

*The five cows instantly start running towards the two friends.*

*Abe and Jack exit the pasture in a hurry, Abe tries to lock the gate while his hands tremble uncontrollably.* 

*Unfortunately, he doesn't lock it in time as the five sick cows stampede through the gate.*

*The five cows mercilessly trample on Abe and Jack, screams of agony are heard as the cows easily crush the bodies of both men.*

*The creature approaches the mangled bodies of the men, their heads have already turned into a bloody mush under the weight of the frenzied cows.*

*The creature looks at the crushed corpses of the men and smiles once again, it's toothless grin remains as it starts eating the soft, crushed remains of the men.*

*TAPE ENDS*

*I stare at the screen in shock.*

*This time, instead of the usual warning, a different disclaimer appears.*

*"YOU'VE MADE IT TO THE HALFWAY POINT, A TWENTY MINUTE BREAK IS ALLOWED, CONTINUE WATCHING AS SOON AS THE TWENTY MINUTES PASS!"*

*I want to use the surprising twenty minute break in all it's glory, so I'll end this part here.*
