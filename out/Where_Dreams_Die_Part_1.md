“If you dream hard enough, the world is yours” 

 My mother always used to say that to me, but I never really understood. I do now.

As a kid when I was around 4-6 years old, I used to have night terrors almost every night where I’d wake up neurotic and crying over what I had just experienced. Theres something so frightening about being a defenseless child incapable of confronting the horrors that lie in your imagination. Every time I woke up I'd stumble my way to my parents' bedroom clinging to the stuffed bear that served to protect me from fear, and every time I’d explain my nightmare to them I’d hear the same thing, “it’s okay honey, it was just a nightmare. Go back to bed."

After some convincing that these nightmares weren’t real I would return to my room, but I could never fall back asleep, I used to sit tensely and wait until my mind couldn't hold on anymore and I would eventually drift off into the night only to experience it all once again. 

These dreams varied every night, from being in the ocean with a great white shark after I accidentally caught a glimpse of my father watching Jaws in the living room right as the kid on the floatie was devoured in broad daylight, to being lost in the woods at night and every little sound brought tension to the monster that lurked just out of vision. But one dream always remained the same and happened more often than the others. An old broken wooden door stood in front of me surrounded by a dark void that consumed every little bit of light around me, except for the door.

It towered over me as I felt powerless to its presence, the only thing I noticed about it then was the large crack down the center that shined a misty pale light from it. After staring down the door for around a minute but in what felt like an eternity to my child mind, the door would open on its own. It’d slowly creak from the rusted hinges that held it together to reveal a wasteland of decay after what seemed like a pillage, before me stood an army of creatures resembling imps sporadically dashing around clawing at everything in their path, including each other. Behind them in the distance stood a colossal shadow that looked beast-like in shape but with no discernable features to directly tie it to a certain animal.

As I stood and bewildered, a claw grabbed my entire body and lifted me up closer to the shadow, as I was engulfed in darkness. Then I would wake up; I know it's foolish but the only logical conclusion my mind could come up with at that age was that I was looking at hell, with the devil taking me. 

The night terrors occured most nights but that reoccurring dream plagued me around at least once a week, it wasn't until I was 7 years old and my Grandparents came to visit from England that they stopped. They only stopped because one night my grandma heard me crying in the darkness by myself curled up in a ball after the nightmare awoke me. I remember her face clearly in my mind; it was as if she too had seen what I had in my dream. It wasn’t a face of comfort towards a crying child but rather a face of horror and a familiar sense of understanding. She stayed with me through the night comforting me until I eventually fell back asleep. 

The next day she took me out to the Sunday market in town, on the car ride there the radio played ‘In My Life’ by ‘The Beatles’. She tried singing along at first, but the words slipped her mind as she tried to remember; she laughed it off eventually giving up and started humming the tune to focus on driving until we arrived. We wandered around the markets until she came across a stand with an elderly woman who appeared around the same age as her, they talked for a while, but I couldn’t really hear them. She bent down to get eye level with me and revealed that she bought me a light blue dreamer catcher that had feathers of the same colour dangling from it along with black beads.

She told me that it would trap my bad dreams within the strands of string like how a spider trap bugs in its web. I only questioned her about what kind of strange bird could have feathers this colour as I had only seen seagulls and pigeons so far in my life. As we got home, we hung up the catcher where it swayed and danced from the ceiling as the wind from my window floated through the crack.  To my shock I slept through the night peacefully and woke up not recalling having a dream. 

That was the last memory of her that I remember. Not too long after they moved back to England she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, I didn’t get to see her after that as visiting was expensive for the whole family to travel, and when I did that one time, it wasn't her. The disease stripped her mind of who she once was, leaving behind the husk of a body unable to recognise me or the world around her. 

She died in a care home when I was 12, I was upset but my body refused to cry, I felt like a monster being unable to express the emotions I felt about the woman who saved me from restless sleep. I only realized today that it was because I didn't really know her; my brain hadn't developed enough to make memories and interact with her before the disease took her mind. I didn't go to the funeral, but my parents did as they took the next flight to England leaving me and my 16-year-old sister alone in the house for a week.  

That night I lay in my bed looking up at the dream catcher still hanging from the ceiling 5 years on. It looked lifeless as the once vibrant colours had faded away from the sun. It didn't dance and move like the day it went up, but instead stood solitary, like a corpse hanging from a noose. I struggled to sleep that night as my emotions kept me up, not truly understanding that she was really gone now, not just mentally but physically. I eventually fell asleep, but that night for the first time in years, the door appeared once again, I stood frozen in terror as today of all days, it came back.

I hesitated at first examining the door, it was almost the same as when I was kid, the old black doorknob that looked as if it would fall off with any amount of force, the hinges rusted and decayed that barely held it upright, but this time, the crack down the middle was gone but a slight outline of it still remained as if someone or something had repaired it. 

I waited but this time the door didn't open by itself, I know it sounds stupid in hindsight, but I needed to know if the shadow was still behind the door. I felt a sense of fear and courage surge through me as I gripped the doorknob, feeling the cold metal in my palm I twisted it. But this time, instead the once brutal scenery of a barren world was now an almost empty living room that filled me with a sense of Deja vous for something I had never seen before. The walls held inexpensive abstract colour art that someone would paint in their garage during a midlife crisis. A mantelpiece held various vases filled with white lilies that emitted an intense sickly sweet perfume smell that infested my nose. But the furthest corner drew me in and made me sick to my stomach. 

Facing away from me in a swinging wooden rocking chair sat a woman, I could tell exactly who it was without even needing to see their face, it was grandma. Her hair had greyed dramatically since last I saw, her hands twitched uncontrollably as she hummed a broken rendition of ‘In My Life’ just like in the car ride to the Sunday market that lifetime ago. “Grandma?” I called out as I ushered closer to the swinging chair, but I got no response, I got within arm's reach of her when I saw a rich dark nectar dripping from her fingertips to the floor creating a pool beneath her feet.

Her face snapped to mine revealing her deformity, her face had been gouged at around her eyes leaving behind only the sockets that seemed to burrow endlessly into her face surrounded by sickly purplish green swelling that resembled more of rotted vegetation than human skin. Its mouth clicked and cracked as it tried to speak but at first the only sound it made was a deafening wailing sound, until it fixed its jaw back into place. “IT HURTS CHARLES” it cried out, “I SEE THAT NOW” I collapsed to the floor as the woman leapt from her resting place to hunch over me  “CROWN MY SOUL O DEAR BELIAL”. It got eye level with me as its fingernails rushed towards my eyes, I shut my eyes out of fear and defense, but I didn’t feel any clawing sensation. Instead, I felt my body twitch on the mattress I was resting on.  

I jolted upright, drenched in sweat screaming as the image of her rotten body lingered in my mind until my sister stormed in whilst yelling at me because it was 2:26 am and she didn't understand what I had just witnessed. She stood in the doorway complaining for around 2 minutes until she eventually left. As I went to lie back down, my eyes caught a glimpse of the dream catcher above my head. A couple of feathers had fallen off onto my bed, almost as if they had rotted away like leaves in the autumn.  

I couldn't sleep that night; my mind and heart were still racing even half an hour after waking up. I couldn’t help but think about what it was talking about, why were her eyes gouged from her face? and what is Belial? Charles was my grandpa, and I felt that he and my parents hadn’t fully told me what happened to grandma when she died, I knew I needed to ask him, I just didn’t know how.
