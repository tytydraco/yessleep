I started smashing. More or less indiscriminately, manically swinging, going from wall to wall.

I could see as the wallboard fell away that my suspicions were justified -- that there was something behind it besides framing and wiring and insulation, and I felt it in my hands too as the sculpture's heavy base went through the board not into empty space but up against something hard, something that made a crashing, jagged sound upon impact. But I didn't stop to inspect what my demolition was revealing, not until I'd exhausted myself and three walls of the bedroom were crumbled on the floor.

At first it seemed like I'd revealed a hundred sets of glowing eyes.

But no, not eyes. Lights. I approached one of the walls to confirm. Vertical banks of red-bulbed lights. Infrared, it appeared. Still lit -- the ones that weren't smashed. These banks were spaced at regular intervals all throughout the walls, so that the bulbs would've been just behind the wallboard. The gaps between and around these banks of lights were stuffed with insulation.

This discovery replenished my energy and I went out to the hall swinging the sculpture from side to side, out to the kitchen, the living room, the dining room, smashing, cursing the house with each swing: *fuck you*, smash, *fuck you*, smash. Everywhere the same banks of infrared lights, thousands of bulbs. Crumbled wallboard, splintered bulbs, everything a ruin. Into my office, swinging the sculpture. Same thing.

Which left only Nick's office. The future nursery. The former future nursery.

I walked in dragging the sculpture along the floor's engineered bamboo planks.  The lurking feeling had seemed to dissipate the more I'd frantically smashed, as if, somehow, the feeling was emanating from the bulbs themselves. Entering the office, however, the feeling returned, the lurking and the other thing, the feeling of movement, of something vital -- as strong as ever. I hesitated to raise the sculpture. Instead, I raised a hand and rubbed my palm along the wall. That sense of activity, of unseen moving, was it just my imagination or could I also feel it?

I told myself that I wasn't scared to find out what was behind these walls. But I knew that I was making excuses, buying time, when I walked out of the office. I just had to check something, I told myself.

This wasn't completely untrue. Off beyond the pantry was the mechanical room and that's where I went.

I've never been handy but during construction I'd at least managed to learn what everything was: the HVAC equipment, the water heater and filtration system, the radon vent. Now, I took my time looking it over, traced all the connections running in and out to see where they originated and where they went. Power connections, pipe fittings, ducting, etc. This took quite a while, but I managed to figure out what was what.

Which is how I was able to identify one connection that didn't make sense: a pvc pipe running to the water filtration system's inflow that didn't have a clear origin. It ran into the exterior wall and disappeared. And it wasn't the connection coming from the well -- I'd already located that.

I grabbed a flashlight, went outside, and walked around the house until I was standing roughly where that pipe extended into the wall. Just a plain, windowless expanse of composite paneling. Or so it appeared until I stuck the flashlight in my mouth and began wedging my fingers into the seams between panels, to pry at the edges. Eventually I found one that had some give to it. Inspecting it closely, there appeared to be a place where the edge had been rubbed away. I went inside for a screwdriver, came back, and wedged it there beside the edge.

It popped right off. It had evidently been designed to do so, so that the panel could be detached and reconnected via mountings in each corner.

Under the panel, built into the wall, was a screw cap with a handle, kind of like a gas cap. I unscrewed and removed it, revealing an opening that I assumed fed to the pipe. I dabbed a finger along the edges of the opening. My finger came away wet with a milky, odorless liquid.

Maybe -- maybe -- if I'd happened upon this when we first moved in, I could've convinced myself there was some good reason to create a means for someone outside the house to pour something directly into our drinking water. I couldn't, from my current perspective, imagine what might've passed for such a reason -- but maybe. Now, I was well beyond the point of making rationalizations.

The anti-seizure medication that counteracted my birth control. Whatever caused all the strange behavior at the dinner party. Who knows what else.

I felt physically sick. Part of it was knowing with certainty that, all this time, Nick and I had been target of a deliberate scheme, the purpose and workings of which I didn't understand. And, yeah, part of it was knowing what I still had to do. Sculpture in hand, I returned to the office/nursery. Before I could think better of it, I got a good two-fisted grip, reared back, and smashed. The board cracked and fell away.

Snakes.

Somehow my body knew before my brain, because I jumped back. Writhing black and dark green and brown bodies, how many I couldn't tell. A tangled mass, but only for a moment -- as soon as they were exposed they moved away from the hole, not down the wall and into the room, but behind the wall, disappearing from view. And what became visible in their absence was in its way no less horrifying. Only the horror wasn't as immediate because it took a moment for me to recognize what I was seeing.

Bones. Whitewashed bones, fit together tightly, a kind of osseous insulation with gaps just wide enough, apparently, that the snakes could slither through.

My next swing of the sculpture was less enthusiastic, more exploratory, opening up another, smaller hole. Again, the snakes. And again they disappeared from view almost as quickly as they were revealed. Another swing, more snakes, until the fact of the snakes began to freak me out less than their behavior, their coordinated retreat. I began swinging with more energy, up and down one wall, smashing away the wallboard.

Snakes retreating, bones revealed. I approached the wall, looked closely. These were human bones. As near as I could tell, anyway, with them packed all in a jumble. The skulls were human and the rest of the bones appeared to be the size of human bones.

I kept smashing, thinking at some point the snakes would run out of places to go. I went out and checked the other rooms, to make sure they weren't coming out somewhere else. I don't know why I was suddenly so intent on seeing one, at least just one, come out of the wall. Normally I do everything I can to keep snakes as far away from me as possible. But there was something deeply unsettling about their retreat, about not knowing where they were going.

When the second wall was more or less completely smashed I took my flashlight out to the deck and shined it around to see if the snakes were exiting en masse. I didn't see a single one.

I returned to the office and was working on the third wall when I heard a voice directly behind me.

"Lena!"

It was Nick. Standing in the doorway. I'd been so intent on what I was doing, what I was finding, that I'd lost track of time and hadn't heard him come in. For all I knew he could've been standing there yelling for some time.

I stepped back so that we faced each other across the room, but I didn't lower the sculpture. His eyes were crazy, jumping and bulging, the cords of his neck strung taut.

"Aren't you going to ask what I'm doing?" I said. "Aren't you going to ask what I found?"

His mouth did something strange before it managed to issue sound: "I can see what you're doing. What you think you're doing. But you have no idea."

"Did you know about all this? The bones, the snakes, the lights? And the water. They've been putting things in our water."

"This is how it propagates."

"How what propagates?"

"It's never the same, generation to generation. Not exactly. But it's built from the same constituent parts, according to the same basic mechanics."

"Building mechanics. Like the ones you've been working on?"

With this my eyes drifted toward his computer -- his monitors and tower atop the desk along the only untouched wall. His eyes followed mine.

"We each do our part," he said. "We seed it where we can."

"Nick, listen, please. We need to leave. For good. Leave this place and never come back."

"I can't do that." Still looking at his computer as he said this.

His work. He was thinking of his work. Which gave me an idea.

All his code was in his repo in the cloud. There was nothing I could do about that. But his sandbox -- the platform's staging environment -- was a different matter. Since he'd been fired he'd no longer have access to the company's cloud. Which meant he might've been working from a local copy. One that could be deleted. Or destroyed.

In almost the same moment the idea came to me, Nick seemed to get it too. His eyes shot wider and he took a step toward me but I'd already reared back.

"Stop!" he screamed, redirecting his movement with an awkward lunge so that he was between the computer and the swinging sculpture.

I couldn't stop. It was heavy and I'd already started swinging.

The solid base of the sculpture met his forearm, which he'd held up as if to ward off the blow. A loud crack as the sculpture continued its arc, its length catching him hard in the ribs. Nick cried out in pain, staggered, fell to the ground. Part of me wanted to comfort him. The other part saw a chance to finish the job.

I reared back again. This time the sculpture came down on the tower. I swung again and again, until the tower was a pile of metal and plastic.

Nick at this point was staggering away down the hallway, the effort exaggerating the awful physics that had come to characterize his movements, clasping his one ruined arm with the other, cradling it like a baby. I watched him go, heard the front door open and close. I made it to the door in time to see him reach his car. Before letting himself in he looked up at me with what I can only describe as a look of pure hatred.

I watched him pull away, hopeful he was driving to a hospital.

I bolted the door, thankful we'd installed bolts that could only be disengaged from inside. Went around and made sure the other doors and windows were likewise secured. Doing so, I clipped a corner of the hall with my shoulder, the way I'd done countless times before. This time I rectified the situation, using the sculpture to bash the corner until I'd rounded it off.

There. Fixed.

I looked at the clock. No wonder Nick had returned. It was late, much later than I'd expected, and the night's exertions hit me all at once. I was suddenly very tired and thirsty. I went to the kitchen for a glass of water. On the way, I hit my hip on the kitchen island. I found I was still carrying the sculpture; I'd almost forgotten. With one last surge of energy, I whacked at the side of the island, along its foundation, until the whole thing moved by a few inches.

Satisfied, I finally unclasped the sculpture, leaning it against the repositioned island.

Grabbing a glass from the cabinet, I filled it from the sink before remembering not to drink the water. I threw the glass over my shoulder, heard it land with a crash somewhere behind me, and went to the fridge. We had a few bottles of flavored water. I grabbed one and, on the my way to the living room, twisted off the top, let it fall to the floor. I needed to sit.

Collapsing into an armchair, I took a couple gulps and did a physical inventory. My muscles were exhausted, my whole body was exhausted. Otherwise though I felt OK. I rubbed my belly, said, "We're fine. We're going to be fine." Trying to convince myself as much as the baby.

I closed my eyes and took a few deep, steadying breaths. That was a mistake. Closing my eyes I mean. Because I fell asleep immediately, there in the armchair, my head tilted back.

\###

It was still dark when I woke up, momentarily disoriented, head propped uncomfortably at ninety degrees so that my first look was at the ceiling. Sitting up, I nearly spilled the bottle of water that I still grasped in one hand. I placed it on the side table. That was when I realized I wasn't alone.

The architect. Sitting on the sofa across the room. The only light came from what few infrared bulbs hadn't been smashed, which left him sitting in dimly tinted shadow, but he was unmistakable the moment he moved -- though his movement was subtle, a straightening of his posture upon noticing that I'd awoken.

"How did you get in?" I said. This was reflex more than anything. I didn't expect an answer.

Nor did I get one. He made a show of looking around, his head moving from side to side in its lurching, sickening way. "You've really made a mess of things."

I noticed then how hot it was in the room. So hot that I was sweating. And it wasn't just me. The architect, I saw, had placed his coat on the arm of the sofa and rolled up the sleeves of his shirt.

"What is this?" I said.

"A compelling design. Isn't that what you wanted? A design that harnesses the power of the natural and the engineered, the primitive and the modern -- arranging these things toward a unified, irresistible effect."

I wiped the sweat from my brow. "I just wanted something beautiful."

"Oh, this is beautiful. More beautiful than you can imagine."

The heat was parching. I choked, "Where's Nick?"

"Someplace you can't reach him. Not yet. Not until you understand."

So hot, so thirsty. I grabbed the water from the side table and was about to tip it into my mouth when at the last moment I stopped myself.

How long had I been asleep, the water bottle open in my hand? And how long had the architect been there? The water supply. He'd been drugging us from the time we moved in. Even before, it suddenly occurred to me. The toast that he'd made on the eve of the groundbreaking, the bubbly he'd poured, the sickness that Nick and I had blamed on food poisoning, which had laid us low for the better part of two weeks. Why? It didn't matter. All that mattered was that I wasn't going to drink the water.

I tossed the bottle at him. It hit the floor near his feet, splashing water on his shins. He'd turned the thermostat up, I realized. Had turned it up specifically to parch my throat, to pique my thirst. Everything was by design.

"It would have been easier," he said. I looked up from his splashed shins to see that, resting on his lap, one of his claw-like hands held a hypodermic needle. At the same moment, the architect stood up and as he did he seemed to -- I don't know how else to explain it -- unfold or expand in some way, becoming suddenly wider and taller than I'd ever seen him, as if the version of himself that he showed to the world was some compacted, minimized version of what he really was. He took a step toward me.

I was up and out of the chair in a flash, moving toward the front door, but he was fast and caught me with one hand, his grip fastening upon my sleeve, tearing it clean off as I kept moving. And the next few seconds seemed to elongate as impossibly as the architect's body had just moments before.

I remember thinking that the front door wasn't going to work, that I wouldn't have enough time to undo the bolt and open it before the architect caught up with me and plunged the needle in, thinking this in the merest moment, instantly rerouting, putting an armchair between him and me while turning toward the kitchen, the chair not slowing him at all as he reached out with his free hand, but he was a half-step too far away, a quarter-step, giving me hope as I reached the kitchen island, rounding it so that the sculpture came into view, I had to grab the sculpture, only now the architect had caught up and was reaching out again, extending his claw, and I wasn't fast enough to reach the sculpture, it was just beyond my grasp, the claw was closing in-

Then, rounding the corner of the kitchen island, he clipped it with his hip.

It threw him slightly off balance, slowed him down just a moment, but that moment was enough. I grabbed the sculpture, the very object I'd used to knock the island off its foundation, to move it those few precious inches -- and turned, swinging. I didn't aim so much as flail wildly in the direction of my fear. A flicker of surprise behind the lenses of the architect's glasses as the heavy base met the side of his skull.

He went down in a heap.

As did I, the force of my frantic swing twisting me around and sending me to the ground, breathing hard.

The architect didn't appear to be breathing at all. And his head didn't look exactly right. He twitched a few times, convulsively, then was still.

I ran. Straight for the front door, grabbing my keys from the bowl on the table on the way. Out of the house without taking the time to close the door behind me, into my car, starting it up, tearing down the driveway, one eye in front of me, the other on the rearview mirror, at the front door hanging open.

No.

I hit the brakes. Killed the ignition. Got out of the car, leaving it where it was, maybe thirty, forty yards down the driveway, and walked back to the house.

I couldn't leave -- couldn't leave the house behind. Not like that. If I'd kept driving I would've always, forever after, been keeping one eye on it, there in the rearview mirror, no matter where I was.

Approaching the open door, I glanced inside, saw the architect right where I'd left him, only his legs visible, the rest of him obscured by the kitchen island. I didn't dare go in but I didn't need to. I went around to the storage closet and grabbed what I needed: the lighter for the tiki torches and the big jerry can of gasoline for the landscaping equipment.

Uncapping the can, I made a circuit of the house's perimeter, dousing the walls as I went. When I got to the front door I poured what was left, about half the can, over the threshold onto the floor. The puddle spread into the kitchen, into the living room, into the hall.

One last glance to make sure the architect hadn't moved -- he hadn't, not an inch -- before kneeling down to light the gasoline. The flame blossomed and crept into the house, igniting the puddle.

A sonic cough of flame. A wave of heat through the door. Inside, an instantaneous inferno.

I walked away backwards, never taking my eyes off the house. Got enough distance from it that I could see the whole thing as it burned. Not too much distance. For some reason I wanted to feel the heat off the fire.

For a while I didn't feel anything but that heat, watching as the fire grew and spread, the flames appearing behind windows, licking at the sides of the house through the front door, the outside catching, the roof. Then I felt a wave of panic as the reality of the situation hit me. We were relatively isolated but not so isolated that it was impossible someone would see the flames, or at least the smoke, and call for help. And when help arrived and put out the fire they'd find me here, my hands smelling of gasoline, with a dead body in the house. For a moment I hoped that the architect would appear, stumbling out of the fire, to lessen my culpability.

The moment, however, quickly passed. Let him burn. Let it all burn, and whatever happened happened. I wrapped my arms around my belly and watched, letting myself finally feel relief.

The fire burned fast, stunningly so, so fast that I wondered about the materials used in its construction. The flames were low but hot, the heat's intensity pushing me further up the driveway. I listened to the popping of glass, the windows and thousands of infrared bulbs, listened to creaking and cracking as the structure collapsed into itself. There wasn't much smoke.

Dawn broke. Soon the house was rubble, burning rubble. You'd think the fire's intensity would subside as it consumed the structure, but its appetite seemed endless. It burned the house to coals, the coals to ash. It was oddly deliberate, the fire's consumption -- deliberate and rapid.

It wasn't yet midday when the flames died out. With them went the heat, and the winter cold that the fire had warded off asserted itself so quickly that I had to grab a blanket out of my car's trunk. Wrapping myself in it, I approached what was left of the house. That is, what should've been left of the house.

There should've been something, anything -- the husks of appliances or other recognizable objects amid the rubble -- but the ruin was unnaturally total, everything that had been within the house thoroughly carbonized, reduced and blackened to anonymity. There should've been embers, still burning, still hot, but the only heat coming off the wreckage was faint and residual.

If not for this strangeness I would've been more surprised when I stepped onto the concrete slab and found the ashes barely warm, cool enough to walk on. I picked my way through the rubble to where the kitchen had been and looked for some sign of the architect, a skeleton or a fragment of bone, anything. It was impossible, however, to know what I was looking at -- what it once had been. How hot did it have to be to cremate a corpse? To reduce bone to ash? And how long did that process typically take?

I continued along, navigating what would've been the hallway to the office, the nursery. There had been thousands of bones within the walls; not a single one remained in recognizable form. Thinking about the unlikelihood of this, I was pacing idly through the room's remains when my footing gave way.

The pile of debris I'd been stepping on disappeared, sucked instantly into the floor. I stumbled backwards, landing on my ass. Sat there looking at a hole in the concrete slab. Rectangular, perhaps two by three feet.

Based on its position, I judged the hole to be roughly where the closet would've been. The floor there must've been a moveable panel. The architect's toast -- the one that had made Nick and I sick, the one before the groundbreaking -- now made sense. It had provided the architect time enough to install this feature without our knowledge.

Crawling toward the hole, I peered over the ledge. Along one side of the opening were metal rungs built into a concrete wall. This wall extend in both directions, out of sight, into darkness. The darkness of the hole smelled like... a cookout.

At this recognition I vaguely recalled hearing somewhere that human flesh, cooking, smells like pig. I couldn't tell if this smelled like pig, but certainly like meat. Cooked meat. A muddled sensation: The thought was sickening, the smell was appetizing.

I groped for my phone to use its light, but I'd left it in the house when I ran out. Fortunately, I had a flashlight in the trunk of my car and quickly retrieved it. Flicking it on, I shined it into the hole, half-expecting to see the architect's barbecued body. Instead, what I saw were snakes. Dozens of dead, roasted snakes. So that's where they'd gone.

Some of them anyway. I'd seen what must've been hundreds in the walls -- thousands, even. I looked for survivors but nothing moved. Casting the light in broader and broader sweeps, it appeared that the space below had been spared the worst of the fire's effects. It was a room with curved walls, along which were mounted fixtures of some kind. On the floor were markings half-obscured by the collapsed rubble. Markings that didn't mean anything to me -- until all at once they did.

The pattern on Nick's back. The seven-pointed sun surrounded by seven circles. The pattern that Pria had promised to research. It was this recognition, this connection to Nick, that sent me down the ladder. He'd been down there. When he woke up outside, when he disappeared from his office: This must've been his way out. Just as last night it must've been the architect's way into the locked and bolted house.

I took each rung slowly, spending a minute after each step to sweep the space with my flashlight, to look for surviving snakes or other surprises, ready to retreat. One step at a time, descending into darkness.

Finally reaching the bottom, I surveyed my surroundings. The space was a perfect circle, maybe fifteen feet in diameter, the walls concrete block, the floor mortared stone. On the opposite side of the circle from the ladder was some kind of electrical panel mounted on the wall. Halfway between the panel and the ladder was an arched metal door. All along the walls were glass sconces.

Picking my way around the rubble that had fallen in, I approached the panel. There were several switches and sliders on it, and I clicked through them all, but nothing happened.

A thick bundle of wires ran upward from the panel to the foundation, disappearing into a pvc tube set into the concrete. It occurred to me that this panel must've controlled all the banks of infrared bulbs -- certainly they hadn't been running off our panel, or else we would've seen exorbitant power bills.

With my foot, I pushed aside the fallen rubble and blackened snakes to get a better look at the pattern on the floor. Its lines were a lustrous reddish brown, the color of dried blood. In the center of the central sun was a large puddle of the same color. Around the outside of the pattern, within each of the small circles between the rays, was a ring of melted wax.

Obviously the space was ceremonial. I remembered something the architect had said last night -- about harnessing the power of the natural and the engineered, the primitive and the modern, toward some effect. Whatever effect the ceremonies here were intended to have, I felt their malignant residue.

I stood before the metal door for a moment as if considering whether to open it. Really, though, I'd already decided I would, and as soon as I admitted this to myself grabbed its handle. It swung open smoothly, revealing a tunnel. Like the circular room, its walls were block and lined with sconces. I propped the door open with a piece of rubble and set off down the passage.

My progress was slow, each step punctuated by a thorough scan with my flashlight both before and behind me. The tunnel curved gradually around and downward, so that I eventually lost sight of the door. Soon after, I began to spy light up ahead -- just a sliver, but any daylight at all, down there, came as a relief.

The light was seeping through the crack around another door, or more like a panel -- a rectangular panel about the size of the hole in the foundation. It was set a few feet off the ground, at an angle, and when I pushed upon it I found myself, after the sunlight's dazzle faded and I could make out my surroundings, near the foot of the hill running down from the house.

Stepping out from the tunnel, I let the panel fall shut behind me. It was covered with long grasses and brush to blend into the hillside. I could make out the beginnings of a footpath running from the panel to the edge of the woods a few steps away. My throat tightened as I remembered lying awake in bed, hearing what sounded to me like a procession of footsteps down the hill -- how I'd ascribed it to the doings of nocturnal animals.

I followed the footpath into the woods as far as I could but it wasn't long before it became indistinguishable from the rest of the forest floor.

\###

It's been several months since the house went up in flames and with it the waking nightmare that our lives had become.

That day, I drove to Cassie's. She'd talked to her mom and was expecting me. I told her what had happened and hid out in her guest room. After a few days' recovery I bought a new phone, and when I activated it found that I had dozens of frantic messages from Nick. It was immediately obvious that whatever grip the house had on him had loosened; I could hear it in his voice.

Just to be safe, though, I arranged to meet him in public -- the same coffee shop where I'd taken to meeting Cassie. He looked like he hadn't slept in days and told me that he'd woken up in his car with his arm in a cast and no memory of where he was or why he was there or what had happened to his arm or even the day or season. He had only the faintest memories of his time at the house and none at all of our confrontation the night before it burned down. Understandably, he was freaking out.

Over the next few days and weeks I told him the whole story, and witnessed him try to make sense of it, to reconcile his sense of self with what he was hearing -- witnessed his horror, hearing what had happened and what I'd discovered. I introduced him to Pria, who led him through a series of ceremonies intended to cleanse him of any trace elements his experience may have left behind.

The final ceremony entailed burning off the symbol branded on Nick's back. Pria warned him that it would be painful; he didn't care. He was horrified that this thing was on his body for reasons he didn't know and through means he couldn't remember. Pria had finally learned what the symbol represented but told us that she strongly believed we were better off not knowing. Drawing a metaphor from our experience, she said that certain knowledge is like the blueprint for an altar, upon which evil might seek to place its offerings. We were inclined to heed her warning, as long as she could remove the symbol.

I attended the ceremony. When the red-hot brand hit Nick's skin the smell reminded me of roasted snakes.

We rented a place. An apartment. We're doing fine. Nothing's final, but it even seems like we'll get an insurance payout. The house burned so thoroughly that investigators weren't able to determine what started the fire, but the revelation of the subterranean room and electric panel was enough to suggest that we'd been the targets of something criminal.

We're selling the land. Too many bad memories. When the insurance comes through, we're planning to buy another house. Something older, with good bones and a benign history. The less distinguished the better.

The baby's due any day now. A little boy. I'm optimistic about the life ahead of us. Most of the time. Though sometimes I recall the circumstances of his conception and gestation, just as sometimes I observe Nick from a distance as he's doing something around the house, observe the way he moves -- and I wonder. I wonder if certain elements of a design, once in place, can ever be disassembled or destroyed, if certain experiences, once lived, arrange themselves into patterns that determine our fates.
