This happened when I was 13, I was attending a middle school in my home town, and had worked after school in something they called the "peer leadership program." We were working on an anti bullying campaign for the schools spirit week at the time, and I was charged with making the banner. 

At the time, I had set up in the hallway. The lay out (very important) of the hallway I was in was on the second floor, directly infront of me was a staircase that lead to the first floor and what we called "the catacombs" of the school. (below the school is a bunch of tunnels that network all around my hometown.)  Directly to the right of the staircase was a dead end hallway. There was only three class rooms on each side of the T shaped hall, and they were all remedial type classes, so extremely small. 

It was about 4:30 at the time, and most of the teachers had already gone home, the only people in the hallway were myself, and two other girls who were in the T shaped hall working on posters. 


I was in the middle of painting this giant beast of a banner when I heard a giggle so I looked up towards the stairs just in time to see a little girl with blonde hair run around the corner. She couldn't have been more than 10. For some reason it gave me a very uneasy feeling watching her run around the corner, so for a couple of seconds I just stared into the hallway. That's when she peaked her head back out and darted right back. Almost like she didn't want me to see her.

I stood up and walked around the corner to see who she was, but when the hallway came fully into view, I just saw my fellow students extremely focused on drawing their respective posters. Neither of them had blonde hair. No little girl was with them.

"Did you see a girl come around this corner?" I remember asking and one of the girls said "well yeah, you did." And laughed. 

I proceeded to explain what I had seen. They were both adamant that no one had come into the hallway before I did. Just incase, I went around checking all the doors and they were all locked tight. 

I was freaking out, and I could tell that it was freaking them out, so we all decided to just call it a day and go home after that. 

I still don't know what it was. I want to say it was a ghost, but she looked too... real for that. Like I could actually reach out and touch her. That and I've had my fair share of hauntings at home in my own house, so the fact that the spirit of a little girl would make my hair stand on end, and my heart drop was extremely weird to me. 

Does anyone know what this could be?
