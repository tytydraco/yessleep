**So, I live alone, no family, no girlfriend or boyfriend, too young for kids, anything like that, and I once had a girlfriend, but she went missing. I was sitting up on my laptop, usually just playing Roblox, and I get a call, from an unknown number. Of course, the idiot I am, answers the phone, and to my surprise, it was my mother, or so I thought. She sounded desperate, and begged me if she can come to my house, and obviously, I agreed. I hang up after a while, and close my laptop, and set up a little dish for my mother when she comes over, awaiting patiently for the doorbell to ring. I am bored, so I turn on my TV to have a lot at what is going on in life, when I see a new report. "Breaking news, there are sightings of people in black hoods, running up and down {street name}, and and they appear to be armed, stay indoors at all times." Of course this report got me crazed, so I called my mother and told her not to come, but before I picked up my phone, I heard the doorbell... I open the door and see my mother, she runs inside and sighs heavily.**  


**After a while, she told me that father had gone crazy, so she needed to stay somewhere, and I was so confused, but after a while, my mother said she thinks it's fine to go back home. I begged her no because I knew father is probably waiting to take an attack. But instead, she left. I was home alone, I think, when I go upstairs and hear a tap at my window... I was too scared to look, so I shut my curtains. The tapping got louder, faster, quicker, scarier, and it sounded like it was on the verge of braking my window! I slowly open the curtain, to see nothing there, when I get a notification of a random number, the same one my mother called me on. I read the message, and the colour from my face drained. Pale white face, message that'll haunt me forever and ever to this day. It said that, the person who came to my house wasn't my mother, instead, it was. something... Something that hid a tracker in my house, something that knows where I am, something that... Is outside my house...**

**Afraid as hell, I run downstairs and lock the door, but what I didn't see, was someone walk upstairs. As I said earlier, I live alone, so who the heck could that be? I didn't see it until I re-watched the cameras in the aftermath of the situation, but without knowing SOMETHING is in my house, I go upstairs. As I reach the top of my stair rails, I see my mother. But, is it really my mother? Instead, it's this terrifying thing that literally has a HUGE cut mouth, widest smile you'd ever see, white eyes no iris or pupils, staring deep into your soul. I twitch, shiver, and back up. This thing, took a step toward me, and I had no way out of this situation, so I ran to my room and shut the door, locking it. I hid under my bed, the worst place to possibly hide in this situation, and I take out my phone to call police. The thing outside my door, broke it down in just one kick, and looked under the bed.**

**It had the palest face you'd ever see, whiter than white itself... It was bloody as if it had killed something... My dog... I hear sirens in the distance, and the thing drags me out from under the bed, choking me, attempting to kill me! The cops break down my front door, and run upstairs, before managing to detach the thing from me, but as it did, I fell unconscious from the low amount of airflow in my body.**

**I wake up in a hospital, machines beeping, but a pain in my stomach, so I lift the thin blanket up, to see stitches on my stomach... I don't recall having something happen like that, (I watched the cameras, and I was stabbed), but I recovered myself because the room was cold. I felt uncomfortable so I pressed the call button, and something opened the door, to my surprise, it was that dreaded... Creature...**
