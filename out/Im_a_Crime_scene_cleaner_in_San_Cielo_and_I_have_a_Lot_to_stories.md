You ever been to San Cielo? It’s where I clean up crime scenes. Lately, though, it’s like there’s this heavy vibe hanging over everything, especially with "El Brujo" and his crew running the show. People talk about them like they’re more than just thugs, you know? There’s this feeling in the air, something you can’t quite put your finger on. You see it in the symbols on the walls and the artifacts left behind. Cleaning up after them—it’s not just about the mess they leave behind. It’s about dealing with all that other stuff, the kind that gives you chills even when the sun’s shining.

Before I start telling you about the heavy stuff, let me fill you in on the rules. We cleaners have a little code we live by—something we jokingly call 'The Cleaner's Creed.' It’s a mix of practical advice and superstition that’s kept us sane (mostly) and in one piece (mostly) over the years. Here’s the gist of it:

Rule 1: Gloves On, Mind Off

My first day on the job, old-timer Joe pulled me aside and said, ‘Rule number one: gloves on, mind off.’ He explained that it’s easier to get through the mess if you don’t think about the people it came from. It wasn’t until later that I realized this rule was as much about protecting our sanity as it was about hygiene.

Rule 2: Always Clean with the Lights On

I once had a job in an old factory where the lights were flickering. I ignored it and started cleaning. Suddenly, shadows started moving on their own, and I swear I heard whispers. Ever since that day, I don’t clean in the dark anymore. Lights on, all the way.

Rule 3: Don’t Look When the Man in Black Walks In

You'll hear stories about a mysterious figure showing up at scenes tied to El Brujo’s gang. They say he wears all black and has a way of making your skin crawl. Best not to make eye contact with him. Trust me on that one.

Rule 4: Carry a Lucky Charm

I’ve got this old keychain from my grandpa. It’s nothing special, just a little metal horseshoe, but it’s been with me on every job. Call it luck or call it superstition, I won’t clean without it. Whether it’s a rabbit’s foot, a St. Christopher medal, or your grandma’s old ring, having something that wards off bad vibes can make all the difference. You never know what you’ll encounter out there.

Rule 5: Salt and Sage Before You Engage

We had this one job in a house that gave me the creeps. Before we even started, Maria (a co-worker) went around with a bundle of sage and a handful of salt, muttering something under her breath. The air felt lighter afterward, like whatever was lurking had been shown the door.

Rule 6: Laugh Off the Whispers

In an old mansion, we kept hearing faint voices while cleaning. Someone joked it was the walls gossiping about the rich and famous who used to live there. We laughed it off, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that the walls held onto more secrets than we could ever uncover. That happens sometimes, walls seem to whisper when you’re cleaning. It’s just the mind playing tricks, they say. Laugh it off and keep scrubbing—that’s the best way to stay grounded.

Rule 7: Share Stories, Not Nightmares

After a particularly rough cleanup, we’d gather at the diner down the street. Sharing stories about bizarre finds and close calls helped keep the nightmares away. Turns out, laughter and camaraderie are the best therapy after a day knee-deep in someone else’s mess. It helps to swap stories with the crew. Keeps the nightmares at bay and reminds you that you’re not alone in this crazy gig.

So, there you have it—the Cleaner’s Creed. It might sound like a bunch of old wives’ tales, but trust me, these rules have saved more than a few of us from ending up in therapy. Now, ready to dive into the heavy stuff?

I’ll give you guys only one tale this time, but I Have many more and I may post here later. 

You know that old warehouse near Santa Lucea Bay? Well, Maria, Jake, and I stumbled into quite the spectacle there not long ago.It’s the kind of place you expect trouble, but what we stumbled upon was like a bad horror flick meets a twisted art installation.

Picture this: we walk in, and lo and behold, Ana (yeah, the gang's sacrificial lamb) is half merged with the damn wall. One side of her sticking out like a grotesque modern art piece, blood and all.

Turns out, this gang's got a thing for the Crimson Lady, a deity they worship like she’s the CEO of sin or something. When they suspect someone’s stepped out of line, like Ana did with an abortion, a big no-no in their rulebook—they throw a little party. Cue the blood symbols, the chanting that could wake the dead (or in this case, make 'em turn over in their graves) it feels like they’re auditioning for a horror movie soundtrack, and the grand finale: the peeling.

Yep, you heard me right. They peel poor Ana like a potato. I mean, who needs skincare routines when you've got ancient rituals, right? They strip away her skin, all in the name of spiritual cleansing (It’s their way of "cleansing" her of sins, which apparently involves a lot of blood and not much mercy). If only they knew what moisturizers could do these days.

Maria’s usually unshakable, but even she was muttering prayers under her breath as we suited up. Jake, our Mr. Serious, sets up our gear like he’s disarming a bomb, hands shaking like he’s on his third espresso. 

The vibe in that warehouse? It’s like a haunted house on steroids. Whispers in the shadows, walls that seem to have seen it all and then some. We scrubbed, sanitized, and collected every gruesome souvenir like we were hunting for the world’s worst scavenger hunt prize, collecting every bloody scrap like it was an episode of CSI: Supernatural Edition.

Back at HQ, we had our usual post-gig coffee and therapy session. Stories swapped like poker chips, and laughs cracked like old bones. Anything to keep the darkness from settling too deep. Ana’s story it’s the kind of stuff that sticks with you. A reminder that in this city, beneath all the glitz and glamour, there’s a layer of crazy thick enough to spread on toast. A world where ancient beliefs and  horrific crimes shake hands, leaving us cleaners to mop up the mess, literally and metaphorically.

And you thought your job had weird office politics, huh?
