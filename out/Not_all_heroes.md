The dashboard clock was moving slower than it ought to have. Crappy modern digital junk. 5:23 p.m. I drummed my fingers on the steering wheel, waiting for time to hurry up again. The clock still read 5:23. Being stuck in traffic was annoying on the best of days, but intolerable when there was no reason for it. Ah, 5:24. God, I just wanted to get home. Instead I get the privilege of being stuck in this line of cars that should've been moving like clockwork. The news was chattering away on the radio, but I'd tuned it out long ago. I needed a glass of scotch, but that was waiting for me at home, and I was here, waiting on the highway for no goddamn reason. Still 5:24. Goddamnit. We ought to get a tax reduction for having to put up with this.

I shouldn't have even been here in the first place. I usually took a different route entirely, but nooo, they needed to close the best local diner because someone forgot to wash their hands. Whatever happened to supporting local businesses? Now I have to buy pre-packaged meals that are anything but easy to prepare, or go to chain places that import everything from overseas. It's honestly disgusting, what they're doing to this country.

5:24 still. Christ, why was everything always getting in my way? It didn't use to be this hard. Everything used to *work*, you know? And now idiots keep messing everything up, making all of our lives harder. Selfish assholes. Like whoever had done this to the traffic. We were all at a standstill because some fool had hit a deer, and instead of just dealing with himself it like a responsible citizen, he'd decided to call Animal Control. It was apparently some kind of endangered species, so now we all had to wait for them to arrive. And they were taking their sweet goddamn time.

Endangered deer. There's no such thing. They multiply like rabbits. It was probably albino or inbred or some shit--a mutated or deformed one that really ought to be put down. But no, we all had to sit here and wait for the officials to arrive. Some "specialists" in uniform to drag it off the road because apparently no-one can be trusted to do anything themselves anymore.

5:25. This was ridiculous. I rolled down my window and stuck my head out, trying to see what was going on. A couple of folks were gathered around a big lump on the side of the road up ahead, blocking my view. Everyone was just *standing there* instead of moving the thing and letting the rest of us get on with our lives. The pickup at the front of our stationary little convoy had skidded to the side, trying to avoid the animal probably, and now there were burnt tire marks on the road. Paint was everywhere, too. Normally, I'd respect a man who works with his hands, but this idiot must have had a hundred tins of the gayest shit he could get his hands on. Pink and purple with freaking *glitter* mixed in it, sparkling away obnoxiously. The stuff was everywhere. Animal Control would probably make us pay for cleaning the asphalt. An extortion racket, I tell you.

I was never one to sit and wait for someone else to do what I could handle myself. And it was clear that everyone else was going to just stand there for the next hour until someone came and took control of the situation. Now, I'm no stranger to putting an animal out of its misery when it's necessary. Considering the taste in paint of the driver who'd hit the animal, he was certainly too much of a pussy to do the deed. So I grabbed my reliable semi-automatic .22 LR rifle from the passenger seat, turned off the engine, stepped out, and made my way down the road. A few other drivers honked their horns in relief that *someone* was finally going to let us all get home.

The deer was albino alright. I knew it. It was all mangled , barely recognizable, although the legs were unmistakably a deer's. The torso had been busted right open, and everything from the neck up was broken and bent beyond all belief. Bones were sticking out from where they had no business being in the first place. The driver must have been speeding to do this much damage.

The group of people edged away from me as I approached. They weren't even polite enough to wave or make eye contact--everyone just looked at my rifle. Probably never seen a firearm in their lives, by the look of things. And there was the driver--a girl. Of fucking course. She was barely thirty, without even any makeup and ugly as fuck. Luckily for her, I was going to clear everything up and let us all get moving again. She didn't even have the decency to look grateful.

"You- You-" she kept sputtering. Honestly, if you can't even talk, stay off the road. Leave driving to those of us who can. Some people don't like hearing that, but it's just the way things are. Getting your panties in a twist isn't going to change anything. They give licences out to anyone these days, but some people just shouldn't be driving.

"Welp, looks like you've killed it pretty good," I told her. She kept stuttering at me, wide-eyed. That look never worked on me, and an ugly bitch like her had no chance. The bystanders were standing there, mostly silent, although a few were also stuttering. Young people these days just don't have what it takes anymore. Always making a big deal out of nothing, getting traumatized and triggered. So instead of just dealing with it they went and called Animal Control because their little snowflake hearts couldn't bear seeing the dead deer.

As far as I could tell, it must have been in pretty bad shape before the collision. Its legs looked fine, but its tail... It was like a mule deer's, but maybe twice as long, and the black tip was just a big mess of white hair. Well, maybe that was just the whole albino thing. The neck was all pretzelled up, but what I could see of its head was much harder to figure out. It wasn't recognizable as a head at all, since it was pretty much folded in half and covered in that dumbass paint. But it kind of looked too stocky for its body, and it had too much hair under where I think the mouth was. Probably cancer or some shit. You know those WiFi signals they've got everywhere now? They go right through animals' bodies, and fuck the things right up. Mutate them out the wazoo, cancer and all that sort of thing. But it was hard to tell here because she'd done so much damage, and it was all covered in a thick layer of paint. At least there didn't seem to be that much blood, although that was probably just under all the paint. One thing was for sure, the meat was ruined. No-one wants that colorful shit on their dinner plate. The shape of bones were apparent where the thing had been most injured, and I could make out most of its neck vertebrae, one shoulder blade, and a lot of ribs bent out of its flank. The idiot woman had hit it so hard that a few ribs god pushed up right inside its neck. Heh, that must have hurt. One was coming out right where its eyes probably had been.

I gestured towards the small group. They all just took a few steps back from the movement of my gun. "Hey, anyone got a tarp? Let's move this thing and get traffic going. I'll make sure we can all get home nice and quick."

A young guy who probably hadn't needed to learn to shave yet looked at me like I was crazy. "Sir, that's... It's a..." I couldn't make out what he said because the cars were still cheering me on, honking their horns loudly.

"What? Speak up, son."

"That... Unique horn," he said, still pretty quietly. Couldn't even stay on topic. I decided to rub it in a little.

"Yeah, they're annoyed because they want to get home. You're making them wait. Now, do you want to stand around listening to the pretty horns, or do you have a tarp? I don't want to get that rainbow shit all over mine."

He looked at me, mouth open dumbly, before managing, "We need to wait for animal control."

It was clear that everyone here was brain-dead. I decided it was worth ruining my stuff if it meant getting past all this crap. I went back to my truck, grabbed my tarp and a rope from the back, and draped it over the carcass. No-one helped, of course, but that was probably for the best. Those kinds of people just got in the way. I kept my gun under one arm in case any of these people snapped out of their stupor and tried something they'd regret, and started to drag the beast off the road.

People started freaking out. The girl was crying loudly, shrieking and pointing at me. Yes, dear, I'm doing you a favor. Animal Control would do the same thing. This is the same, just faster. One of bones scraped loudly against the pavement with a sound like nails on a chalkboard. I ignored it, focusing on the task at hand. The sooner this was done, the sooner I could get a drink.

Finally, with a last heave, the creature was clear of the road. My tarp and rope were drenched in paint, so I left them there for the officials to take care of. If they were this tardy, it was the least they could do. I wiped my hands on my pants, but they were stained with paint. Now my pants were ruined, too. Great. For the sake getting home sooner, I did my best to ignore it and turned to the onlookers, who were all screaming and chattering at me like monkeys. Not a single "Thank you" or "Can I pay you for your time" but a bunch of "How could you"s and "What about"s and "Don't"s. That's to be expected these days. No respect or even the smallest bit of gratitude, no sir.

"There. It's out of the way," I said, gesturing with my gun again, "so let's get moving." I strode back to my car, ignoring the noise they were making.

The car horns had stopped, and other people were *getting out* of their cars. We could finally move! Why get out now? Did they want to check on the deer? Everyone's an expert all of a sudden. Now that I'd done the job for them, they wanted to find all the ways they could criticize it. Well, I had no time for that.

I settled back into the driver's seat and started the engine. I had to weave around the other cars a bit, but unlike that girl, I knew how to drive. The crowd moved out of my way, at least, although they were probably just scared of my rifle still. Snowflakes. The cars behind me, too far to see the whole deer situation, followed suit. Traffic was moving again. I turned up the radio and drove home. My scotch was waiting.

Not all heroes wear capes. Traffic was moving, people could get home, see their families, all of that, thanks to me.
