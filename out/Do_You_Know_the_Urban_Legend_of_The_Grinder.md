Hello, everyone,  
  
I was a child of the 2000s, and as one might expect, I had nearly unsupervised access to the internet. I won't blame my parents for that, as everything was still new back then (and I didn't mind at the time), but the experience I'm about to share doesn't have much to do with that. I used to enjoy visiting online forums related to creepypasta, true crime, and other content that kept me up at night. However, one of the stories I came across had such a profound impact on me that it became a true obsession for a while. As the title suggests, it's the legend of "The Grinder." 

I found this story on a well-known creepypasta site, and unfortunately, it's no longer online these days (even with resources like the Wayback Machine and the like, I couldn't find it, believe me, I tried really hard). The legend itself was rather generic: A tall figure wearing a dirty butcher's apron and wielding a rusty saw looking for people for, well, I think you can guess. I was living through childhood with a fertile and imaginative mind, and this legend etched itself into my mind in a disturbing way. I became so obsessed with "The Grinder" that I even bought a notebook and filled it with notes and detailed drawings of it.  
  
The part I want to emphasize here is that, while the description of the monster was generic, the story concluded with a detailed ritual on how to summon it. Why anyone would do that, I still wonder to this day, but it seems natural for humans to want to confront the supernatural without any gain, just like in the tale of "The Midnight Man." As I said, I was fixated on the story and took notes, even memorizing the step-by-step process of the ritual. Please note that I don't recommend anyone attempting to perform it, definitely do not. I'm sharing this information here to see if anyone else remembers, and I've omitted some parts to prevent it from being carried out in full.  
  
The ritual was chilling, and it sends shivers down my spine just thinking about it. The steps, as I noted back then, were as follows:

  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Materials Needed:  
  
\-Raw meat, preferably fatty cuts like Sirloin or pork.  
\-A small animal, such as a bird or a rat.  
\-A candle.  
\-A little of your own blood.  
\-A long, pointed object, like a crochet needle or barbecue skewer.

  
Procedure:  
  
\-Wait until it's late, really late, somewhere between 11 PM and 4 AM.  
\-Find a quiet and secluded room where nobody can enter.  
\-Sit with your back to the door.  
\-Impale the object in the small animal, securing it to the raw meat.  
\-Place the meat with the animal on the floor so that it stands upright without you having to hold it.  
\-Light the candle and repeat: "I offer you flesh, life, and blood," and, as you say the last word, pierce your finger and let your blood drop onto the mixture.  
\-Move away a bit and wait in silence.  
\-If the meat starts to catch fire, it meant that "The Grinder" was coming for you, and it wouldn't rest until it obtained the promised flesh, life, and blood.  
  
Precautions:  
  
\-Always use beef, preferably, or even pork, but NEVER fish or chicken. "The Grinder" despises white meat.  
\-Do not use an animal larger than the ones mentioned, as the larger the animal, the more strength "The Grinder" will have in its manifestation.  
\-Use your blood, and only your blood. It will know if you try to curse someone else.  
\-If you ever turn around to face the door, all is lost.

Now, you might be wondering why I resurrected a legend from over a decade ago. Well, at the end of last month, I decided to host a Halloween party at my house. When my friends and I found the notebook during the party, laughter and jokes were inevitable. After all, "The Grinder" story seemed absurd now that we were "young adults." However, soon enough, curiosity overcame mockery, and maybe a bit of nostalgia too. We decided to play with the ritual I had recorded. It was just an urban legend, right?  
  
We performed the ritual together, not taking it seriously, and nothing happened. We laughed about it one more time and returned to the party atmosphere. But in the past few days, strange events have started to occur. I was on the computer, working late at night when I began to hear a buzzing sound in the background. It was constant and low, something that might have gone unnoticed on a different occasion, but it was starting to bother me. Gradually, my ear adapted to the sound, and I could distinguish what it was: the buzz of a saw, as if it were cutting something. It might sound like a figment of my imagination, but it's been over a week, and one of my friends simply vanished. He stopped responding on all social media platforms and didn't show up for work. His mother even reached out to our group to inquire if we had any information, and that was the last straw, sending me into a panic. I asked a friend who took part in the ritual with us if anything strange had happened to her, and she also mentioned hearing the buzzing sound.  
  
I've tried to search for the original post or at least the profile of the person who posted it to find a solution, but all in vain. So, my last hope lies here. Has anyone ever heard of this legend or experienced something similar? I need answers, and any information or assistance would be more than welcome. I feel like I'm running out of time as the noise increases gradually each day. I've agreed with my friend Sarah to dig deeper somehow. I will provide updates if possible.
