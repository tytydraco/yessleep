I went to Chuck e cheese’s for a birthday signed up and got to do something. I played a lot of the games counting over 6000 tickets it was pretty fun I thought nothing could ruin it. After a while of playing I needed to go to the bathroom my mom said I could go myself because I am a “big kid” so I went. I did what I needed to do and tried doing it fast so I don’t miss the party. Just as I was about to wash my hands I heard faint screams coming from outside when I went to check I saw the Chuck e mascot dragging a kid into some room. 

  After Chuck e brought the kid into the room I ran for my life to my parents. I was just on time for the pizza party I ate the pizza and said I needed to go to the bathroom again. Of course my parents said yes I tried opening the door to the room where Chuck e brought the kid but it was locked. I heard the key clicking I backed up a little bit, the door opened and I saw Chuck e he starting chasing me so I ran for my life. The hall was definitely longer my legs were tired out but the adrenaline rush pumped me further. It was like the hall was extending I ran as fast as I could with Chuck e right behind me. I lost my breath so hardly I started choking but I was nearly at the end of the hallway Chuck e tripped me and I fell hard to the floor. In front of my eyes there was a kid saying are you okay, breathing heavily I said yes I looked behind me and Chuck E was gone with the door.

  After we left it’s like that location disappeared I searched it up but pizza pizza popped up I asked my parents about it and they didn’t remember I swear that all happened. A few years later I happened to go to that pizza pizza once I stepped in I noticed something was wrong but I couldn’t get what it was. I asked the cashier did this place use to be a Chuck E cheese’s and they said I don’t know. I ordered a medium cheese pizza and needed to go to the bathroom so I asked the cashier and they said yes. I went in the bathroom and did what I had to do I washed my hands then dried them I was done but I noticed a door.

   I walked to it and it looked exactly like the one at Chuck e cheese’s. I tried opening it then it started creaking so hardly and it opened. It was like an old storage closet but it smelled terrible like there was a dead body, across the room there was another door. I opened it and on the other side it was Chuck e cheese’s I went in thinking this was impossible unless this was some kind of portal room. I closed the door and looked around a bit and thought it was fine the kids were playing games but instead of money there was 6000 tickets in my pocket I realized it was the same Chuck e cheese’s and then I saw Chuck e, I hid for no reason but Chuck e saw me and came after me I started running Chuck e did too I ran to the door and opened it I ran back to the pizza pizza side and slammed the door.
  
 I heard the handle move so I started pulling. I had an idea I’ve knocked down doors before but never a metal one I kicked as hard as I could then finally knocked the door down Chuck e got back up but luckily that wall locked him in there. I got my pizza and left I searched the location and it said it didn’t exist what happened.
