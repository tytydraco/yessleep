Alright, It's around January 2024, I had this Really Scary Encounter



But this Is my True Story, (Not a Ghost Encounter) Some Of My Parents Dialogue was made up because I can't remember it!

  
1:00 PM

" Alright Honey, We're off to the (supermarket name I don't wanna say!) " My Mum says

  
My mum had previously yelled at my sister because she was stalling for over Thirty Minutes, So they exit.

   
SLAM! The Door shuts, And I get a little Giddy, I love being Home Alone. I open my Phone to Check my Snaps

  
" Yo billy boy. " My Bestfriend (Fake Name because I dont wanna say it) Rory said

" Howdy man! " I text back with enthusiasm

It takes him a while but he sends another

" Two Hours ago... " 

" My bad. " I said

We start up a call and begin chatting, Lets go later in the Day

I Had always had a Big Forest behind My House, And also not Important but still their was a Body found in that forest around 10 Years before we moved there...

5:30 PM

DING! An Text? no It was a Friend Request from Combs, " Wait who's that. "  I stated aloud for Rory

  
" Accept it my guy. " Rory stated

  
I accept always being the Funny Friend, So I was probably gonna make some dumb jokes and stuff, Also I do have a common last name

  
I'm half typing a Diddy Joke (Yes me and my friends made jokes bout diddy prior to everybody knowing, but we did know that he was a Trafficker and possibly a Pedo)

  
" Hey Billy (my middle name and last name). " This random guy said

  
" Bro, Who tf is this. " I scoffed aloud then typing " Bro wtf who are you... " 

Automatically Assuming it's one of our boys (we just say our boys as the default for our friend group)

New Snaps appear

I open the First one being cautious incase it actually is an Pedo who was sending me a Dick Pic, (And being cautious obviously ment I forgot to stop screen sharing)

  
A picture of my TV Reflecting in the Glass from when we were watching the Spider Verse movie 

(we had kept putting watching it off so we watched it the day before this happened)

I'm basically shitting myself, All it took was 1 Photo to scare the living fuck outta me.

" BRO. " I said aloud to Rory

" What? It's just a TV... " Rory said but he also had noticed the Little Reflection of the Samsung on the Bottom of my TV and the Profile picture of My Binge Account

" NAWWW. " He laughed like Crazy

I text my sister

" Please stop your freaking me out. " I said to her, It was likely her in my mind because she had several snapchat and discord accounts that she would troll randos with

  
" huh? " I get a text back and a picture of the store they are in attached

  
" Stop using your fake account to scare me! " I said

  
" I'M NOT!!! " She responds

  
" Then who is??????? " I said obviously pissed off now, Rory still laughing about it

No Text Back, She either got distracted or equally pissed off with me, Me and Rory then just try to forget about it

7:00 PM

Another Picture is Sent

" Oh my lord she's god damn swapped over now hasn't she--- " I stopped mid sentance opening the Photo, It's of my driveway... My mum and sister both walking to the Car.

  
" THATS FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE! " I shouted, My lungs weren't prepared for screaming due to me being in recovering from an Lung Infection

  
" Easy bro. " Rory said, But he had stopped laughing and was also kinda worried

  
" Bro lock your doors, If they were their in the Morning they might be here still. " Rory said, Making me 10x as scared

  
I grab the "Self Defence Knife" but really its an Hunting Knife I own (I am not an american thus no guns)

  
ANOTHER TEXT, Right as i'm exiting to lock the Doors

  
" Daddy ain't here to protect you bitch. " The text read, Since My dad was on an Camping Trip with some old friends, Comb's If that was his name, knew i was Home Alone...

Suddenly My Dog's Go Wild, I quickly run out to get my Dogs, This may seem weird, but If somebody hurt my dogs, I'm fucking ripping them apart, I love them with my entire life (literally was willing to risk my life for them)

  
I run out, And obviously rory is now freaking out, I just fucking dropped my phone and he can't hear me so he now thinks i'm dead or some shit.

  
I get to the Master Bedroom where they were waiting for our family, I can see the flash of a Camera and something scurry off.

  
" HOLY SHIT. " I scream, Deciding I should probably run and go grab my Phone and lock the front door.

  
So I'm running and get to my phone, the Screen Is on, I gulp...

A Picture of me and My Dogs, and me directly staring at the Camera

Rory has a sigh of relief, I freeze up... Usually I'm a fight but something about seeing this made me freeze.

" BILL. " Rory screams at me " FUCKING LOCK YOUR DOORS. " He screamed again

I Break out of my freeze running straight to look my doors. Front Door Locked, Sliding doors locked.

  
Then I run into the master room, and lock myself in with the Dogs, My hunting Knife in hand, Phone in my other hand

  
Suddenly I say, " I gotta hang up man... " I stuttered

  
" Yeah, I understand why. " Rory said

  
The Sound of me hanging up pulsing through my brain.

  
DING!

  
A Picture of My Sliding Door, " Oh shit. " I thought to myself, I locked Two Sliding doors, My house has Three...

  
The Sound of the Door opening loud and clear then

  
SLAM! The Door is shut followed up by the Ringing noise of it having to open back up.

  
This Time, I get a Call.

I deny it, then Immediately called The Police

" Help, I'm at (Home Address), There's someone in my house who's been texting me pictures of me and my family... " I whispered

  
The Operator tried speaking

  
" Please, Just come now. " I muttered out, Then hung out calling My Parents

  
" I love you. " I texted my mum

  
" Love ya. " I texted my Dad on the Verge of tears, But the Door's Handle twists and turns trying to get in, Whilst my dogs growl

  
Lights beam in, I'm so scared so I hope it's the Police but I look and It's my mum's car, They drive in, I can see the outline of them through the window

  
The Rattling from the Door stops and I hear quick running...

My Mum comes in and shes mortified, It turns out the same person was spamming my family with messages saying they were gonna kill me on an burner phone, For some reason my sister had also frozen and didn't text me at all she was crying the entire car drive back.

I stay locked in until I hear my mum running in.

About 5 to 7 Minutes later the Police came in through the Drive Way, And I show them the texts and photos...
