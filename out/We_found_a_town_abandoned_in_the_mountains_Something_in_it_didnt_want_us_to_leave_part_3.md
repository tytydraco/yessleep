“I really don’t want to go in there,” Freddy said, his old man’s face wrinkling in fear. He grabbed my hand tightly. “Please, listen to me. You don’t want to go in there either. Have you seen what’s happening in this town?”  
  
“I doubt we will survive much longer, trying to hide,” I said. “Whatever’s happening here, it seems to be speeding up. At first, it was just a few corpses, guarding the road out of town. Now it’s dozens of them, and it seems like those in the graveyard are all changed now, walking around and hunting. What will you do when it’s hundreds of corpses streaming through every building and road? Where will you hide?” He opened his mouth to say something, then closed it again.  
  
“Look, I can’t force you to come with us,” I said. “If you don’t want to, you can stay here- alone. Betty gave you the pepper spray, and I’m sure you’ll have no problem fighting off hundreds of hungry walking corpses with it, right?” He sighed heavily.  
  
“I’ll come with you, fine,” he said. “But if we get ambushed, I’m running. I should have never come to this goddamn town. I knew it. I had enough gas to get home, but I thought to myself, ‘Why not? It’s cheaper around here.’ Now my car’s totaled, I’m trapped without any way to call for help, and you want me to go into that creepy forest to inspect a bizarre light.”  
  
“You think we want to be here?” Betty asked. “Jonny’s just trying to find us a way out, or a way to survive. We already tried running, but the corpses have surrounded the roads. We tried hiding in the church, but they ended up breaking down the door. This is our last option. If this fails…” She didn’t need to finish the sentiment. We all understood what she meant.  
  
My stomach was growling from not having eaten all day, and I felt tired and weak. I ignored all of it, and immediately started walking towards the edge of the woods. After a few moments, I heard their footsteps close behind me.  
  
As we got closer to the Black Sun, the forest changed from the idyllic firs, junipers and white pine of the forest into a monstrous wasteland, something out of a nightmare. The needles of the evergreens and the decomposing leaves and dark soil of the ground transformed into a thick, scaly covering. I shone my light, kneeling close to it. To my horror, I saw what looked like blood vessels passing through, expanding and contracting slightly as some unseen heart pumped black fluid into the destroyed earth. The crust itself looked dark red, and it covered everything on the ground. I tried knocking on the crust with my knuckles. It felt slightly sticky and as hard as concrete.  
  
The trees and plants had also changed. The bark of the trees had turned a pale, ghostly white. Their leaves and needles had fallen off, and the branches stood like skeletal arms, stretching upwards to the sky. Thick rivulets of black fluid dripped from the bark and branches of all the trees. The ferns and pricker bushes and other small plants had also turned white, as pale as writhing maggots. Small drops of the black fluid fell from the changed leaves of the ferns and shrubs, dripping onto the ground.  
  
“This reminds me of kudzu, in a way,” Freddy said, standing behind my wife and me. His eyes were wide, and he kept gazing around uncertainly. He didn’t look at us, though he constantly glanced back towards Main Street, as if thinking about booking it and leaving us alone.  
  
“What’s kudzu?” my wife asked, still as curious as ever.  
  
“It’s a plant from Asia. It grows in the South a lot, and it takes over whole areas. It’s like a vine that climbs everything and suffocates all the other plants,” he said.  
  
“This looks a little different than kudzu,” I said sarcastically. I saw Freddy’s knuckles turn white from gripping the mace canister as a stick snapped in the distance. He was terrified, and it would likely only take the smallest thing to send him running. I knew exactly how he felt.  
  
The light from the Black Sun became so bright as we walked forwards that I no longer needed my phone. Trying to conserve the battery, I turned the flashlight off and put it away, seeing Betty doing the same. Fred followed behind us, hesitant. As we got closer to the source of the mystery, his anxiety seemed to grow.  
  
“You know what they say about stragglers, Freddy?” I asked, trying to break the grim mood. He shook his head. “Stragglers get eaten first.” After that, his pace quickened, and he stuck close to us.  
  
I hadn’t seen a single animal yet, or heard a cricket or a bird. There were no bats flying around the dead, bleeding trees, no owls hooting in the distance or mosquitoes swarming around us. I wondered where the animals had gone. Most likely, I thought to myself, they had fled, unlike me. It seemed to me that they were the smart ones in this decision.  
  
As if conjured by the thought, I saw movement below a thick cluster of ferns. I put my hand up, the universal signal for “stop”. My wife and Freddy paused without a word. I got on my knees, taking my phone back out and turning the light on. I shone it under the leaves.  
  
I saw a mutilated possum, still clinging to life. Surrounding it were tiny creatures. They weren’t like any lifeform I had ever seen on Earth. When the light fell on them, they started chittering, excitedly raising their voices and turning their tiny faces towards me. They were no bigger than a Barbie doll, but with dozens of them in a pack, they had apparently taken down an animal much larger than themselves.  
  
They had gray, chitinous shells with glowing white eyes. Sharp crab-like pinchers covered in fresh blood clicked open and closed rapidly. Their tiny legs curved outwards, ending in razor-like feet. Their bow-legged gait made them waver from side to side as they ran around the possum, turning their tiny heads towards me from time to time and clicking their small mouths.   
  
The possum was nearly dead, and didn’t even try to run or fight. It languidedly raised a paw, or its head, and then the attack would begin again. The light in its eyes had gone out.   
  
Dozens of deep gashes showed all over its body. Its ragged breathing would stop for a few seconds, then start again once one of the tiny creatures shoved its claws inside, opening a tiny mouth filled with fangs to suck the blood that poured out. I quickly backed away. Betty had seen it, too, and a look of horror crossed her face.  
  
“What are those things?” she asked.   
  
“I have no idea,” I said. Freddy didn’t seem the least bit interested in seeing the creatures or the dying possum. He had stayed back a few feet, constantly checking all directions as if expecting an ambush. Without a word, I kept walking, not wanting to see such a horrible and sad scene. I considered sending a bullet in the possum’s head, to put it out of its misery. I looked over at Betty, who always loved animals, and noticed a tear rolling down her cheek.  
  
I realized I could see something through the pale, skeletal trees. It looked like a clearing, and in the center, I could just barely make out a huge orb, floating and spinning over the crusted red ground. An intense, purplish-black light swirled and jumped inside of it, sending out bolts of lightning into the surrounding field. Yet there was no sound, no thunder or crashing of branches. I pointed, and Betty raised her head, her mouth agape in wonder. Freddy, apparently, had already seen it. All the color had drained from his face, and I thought, for a moment, he might faint.  
  
“I think we’re near,” I said. “That must be the Black Sun.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
As I walked out into the clearing, I felt eyes on me. I thought I caught glimpses of white eyes behind the dead trees and bushes, but whenever I turned to look, they were gone. Nevertheless, I quickly realized we weren’t alone in the clearing.  
  
It extended for nearly a quarter mile, with the Black Sun directly in the middle. Thick black blood vessels as wide as a man pulsed all around my feet, thousands of them embedded into the dark red crust of the earth. And as my eyes adjusted to the intense black light, I realized more of the townspeople were here, tortured and dying. It looked like we had found the missing.  
  
They were impaled on sharpened sticks ten-feet-tall that surrounded the Black Sun in a circle. They loomed over me, choking out blood and pleading. I saw men, women and children, all dying or dead. The one nearest to me, an old woman still wearing the tattered rags of her clothes, raised her head and looked down at me, her eyes white and dead.  
  
“Get out while you still can,” she said, coughing up blood that dribbled down her chin. The stake had been driven between her legs, and the sharp end rose out of her left shoulder. “He’s mad, he’s mad. Oh God, he’s killed us all. We should’ve done something. We should’ve tried.” Her eyelids started fluttering, and she began to shake and seize on the stake. Within seconds, she had died, her head falling down limply, still staring at me, her eerie, white eyes still open.  
  
I hadn’t noticed before, but I saw the black, pulsating blood vessels extended to each one of the victims. They had crawled up the stakes and wrapped around the feet and legs of each person. I couldn’t see the bottom of their bodies, but I saw that these nightmarish arteries had eaten holes inside each of the bodies. They seemed to suck on their blood, draining the victims as they died.  
  
“And you still think we should have come here, Johnny?” Freddy asked in my ear. “Do me a favor, please. If we get captured, just put a bullet in my head. I don’t want to end up like that.” He motioned to the old woman, who still stared blankly down at us, looking at me like some scarecrow from Hell. I didn’t answer, gazing around the hundreds of bodies that surrounded the Black Sun like the spokes on a wheel.  
  
Standing next to the orb, I saw what looked like a little boy, no older than nine or ten. But he was transformed, no longer human. His skin looked translucent. Black veins and arteries stood out on his neck and face, and his eyes were white like the others, and yet different. They weren’t the dull cataract-white of a corpse, but shone with their own inner luminosity, like twin stars floating in the void.  
  
“My name is Kindred,” the boy said, smiling. “I think you’ve arrived just in time. The Black Sun is almost done feeding for now, and it will send out its call in a moment. I congratulate you on making it so far. The others didn’t do so well. The Black Sun has a… corrupting influence, let’s say.” His grin widened at this. “But it doesn’t seem to affect you three as much. Now why do you think that is?” None of us answered him. I gripped the gun tightly, feeling my finger on the trigger. It gave me a sense of power and relief, even though I didn’t know if it would have any effect on such a creature. Betty was the first to speak, stepping forward. She didn’t stutter or tremble as she stared into the boy’s eyes.  
  
“Do you live here? Where’s your family?” she asked. The boy’s smile seemed to widen further, stretching inhumanly across his small face.  
  
“My family is dead,” he said. “Thank the Lord Lucifer for small favors. My father was a terrible man. He used to beat me mercilessly, or choke me into unconsciousness. One day he went too far, however, and he killed me. My mother covered it up.  
  
“But I was offered a way to return the favor. Lucifer came to me in a vision as I died at the bottom of the stairs, my neck broken, paralyzed from the fall. He told me that, if I gave him my soul, I could come back in power and glory. Those who hurt me would fall first. The neighbors and congregation that had ignored my pleas for help would suffer also, and the church, full of hypocrites and liars, would become a testament to my becoming, and His power.  
  
“My father, a police officer who helped to cover up my death, was the first to go. When the Black Sun appeared in the forest, it began to twist their minds. His mind, already damaged, was easy to push over the edge. Lucifer convinced him to end his own life, and he shot himself in his car.  
  
“As the Black Sun grew in power, it brought the dead back to life- an army for me to use in my becoming. Some of the townspeople tried to hide in the church, but the Black Sun put them to sleep, and I came through and cut their throats, one by one, in the pews.  
  
“Now it expands, and as its power grows, the dead rise further and further away. Soon, all the corpses in this town will follow my command- except for, of course, those needed to feed the Black Sun, these puppets on the stakes.” He motioned to the hundreds of impaled bodies.  
  
Then, he closed his eyes, and the Black Sun began to grow. Its orb grew, and the dark, silent lightning began to strike the impaled bodies and trees with a feverish intensity. I had to turn my head away, but I still saw the branching lightning strikes even through my closed eyes.  
  
Kindred didn’t flinch, but instead seemed to feed off of the energy it put out. His smile grew wider, and his white eyes seemed to burn with an inner light. It was as if I could see a fire of white flames inside his head- or, perhaps, a sun.  
  
“We’ve had to feed it,” he said, “and after it’s fed, it sleeps. But its slumber shortens with every cycle, and the energy it puts out grows. Every time it awakens, it brings back the dead in an ever-widening circle. Soon, we will have an army of fearless soldiers, soldiers who obey every command regardless of the danger of death. For what do they have to fear?”   
  
I saw corpses walking out of the forest, forming a circle around the Black Sun. The woman with the black, matted hair and white eyes I had seen earlier stood next to Kindred. She put her hand on his shoulder, and he looked up at her fondly. “My mother. She’s much more useful in death. She never could stand up to my father. But everything happens for a reason.” He said this last part wistfully, a slight smile returning to his boyish, mutated face.  
  
Then the Black Sun began to make a shrill noise, an ear-splitting siren-like sound that made me back up instinctively. I realized that what we had heard in the town was not a siren at all, but the call of this Satanic orb, spinning deep within the forest. A smell like ozone filled the clearing, mixing with the rotting odor of the dead.  
  
Kindred didn’t seem to mind the noise or the smells. His face had returned to the same placid, expressionless state it had been in when I first saw him. The siren call died down much faster this time, and soon, the forest had returned to silence.  
  
For a moment, we stared at each other, his burning white eyes meeting mine. Then he turned away, giving an apathetic wave in our direction.  
  
“Kill them all,” he said. “Feed them to the Sun.” As soon as he had turned, I raised the pistol and fired. The first shot went low, and it caught him in the knee. He cried out, a very human sound, falling onto the crusted red ground. The army of undead he had summoned rushed forwards towards us. I pulled out the knife and threw it to Freddy.  
  
“Better be ready,” I said quickly, and then they were on us. I shot the black-haired woman in the head, the one Kindred had called his mother, and she fell backwards, thick clotted blood and gore exploding out the back of her head.   
  
Freddy stabbed with the knife, hitting a tall man’s corpse in the eye. With a sickening sound, he pulled it out, sending droplets of blood scattering in all directions. But a dozen hands grabbed him, pulling down as he screamed for help. I shot the last few rounds into the heads of those nearest, but for each one I killed, another three would swarm in and take their place.  
  
I tried to run forwards, towards Kindred, but hands grabbed me from all directions. The strength of those hands quickly stopped me in my tracks.  
  
In the chaos, Betty escaped, crawling under their grasping hands and through decomposing, skeletal legs. They were focused on us, those with the weapons, and she used the opportunity to run. She sprinted towards Kindred, who was healing quickly. The blood had already stopped pouring from the bullet wound in his leg, and he was slowly rising to his feet, scowling and furious.  
  
In horror, I watched her as she tackled his small body, and they both went flying into the Black Sun. For a moment, nothing happened. They seemed suspended on the surface, defying gravity, Betty’s mouth an “O” of surprise, Kindred’s a look of pure hatred. And then, there was an explosion of light and heat, and a gateway opened in front of my eyes.  
  
On the other side, I saw a vast, terrifying landscape. Rocky cliffs extended up to the sky. Blood-red clouds rained fire and lava down on the dead rocks below. Thousands of people swarmed across the barren landscape, burning, screaming, their skin melting off and their hair on fire. But as soon as they had fallen and stopped moving, they would heal in a matter of seconds. Then it would start again, and they would rise, trying to escape the fire.  
  
Then the portal started to close, narrowing, shrinking. I screamed for my wife, telling her to get out of there, to run. But my words caught in my throat, and soon, it had shrunk to a pinpoint of violent, purplish light. Seconds later, it was gone, and the corpses holding me fell limply to the ground, landing on their faces and backs, their eyes shutting.  
  
I was alone with Freddy, horrified, screaming for my wife. But, in my heart, I knew I would never see her again. The Black Sun had taken her, as it had taken the lives of so many others. I cursed Kindred, cursed the Sun and the townspeople and his father.  
  
Surrounded by hundreds of rotting corpses, we started the long walk back to town in silence, my tears feeling cold on my cheeks.
