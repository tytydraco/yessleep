When I was young, one of our summer activities as a family was to visit my grandparents down in Kentucky. Ever since they moved there my parents made it a point to visit more often. I think somewhere in the back of my father's mind he knew the move was to experience solitude before death.



My grandparents weren't at the time in bad health, they just made the move before that inevitably took place.



Growing up in a small town in Ohio I was no stranger to the outdoors. From catching crawdads and looking for wild mushrooms, my childhood had a modest amount of "experience".



Our first visit to my grandparents' new home was not only exciting but terribly boring. It was a three hour car ride and to a ten year old the experience was that of three years worth. After countless bathroom break stops and several arguments between my parents in the front seat we had made it.Somewhere deep in the hills of Kentucky.



I wasn't sure what I expected when we had arived but it certainly wasn't what I was looking at. A small run down house with a sagging roof.



"Welcome to the love shack." My dad said trying to hype us up.



We shuffled inside with our suitcases in tow and immediately I didn't like the inside. It was small and cramped, the dust could be seen swirling in the air and it smelled like a basement.



Dad gave us the tour and showed us where we would all be sleeping. My brother and I had the first room to the left immediately inside the door. A small room with a bed flanking eachside of the door. My sister slept in a bed next to my parents in the largest room that would have typically been used as a living room.



"Alright guys, go outside and play while dad and I get dinner ready." My mom said as she motioned us outside.



In the backyard was a small fire pit that was lazily put together with mismatched bricks and stones. My older brother Blake immediately ran past the fire pit and toward the creek.



The summer was dry and the creek was void of water so its stoney underbelly was revealed. He immediately started rummaging around and flipping over larger rocks.



"What are you doing?" I asked.



"Sometimes crawdads are still under rocks if there's a little bit of water left."



This got me excited so I started to also flip rocks.



"Whats this?" My little sister Renee shouted.



My brother and I both stood up and looked out of the creek ti see her standing in front of a small hut.



"Thats the outhouse." My brother yelled.



"Whats an outhouse?"



"Thats the toilet!"



"Ew I have to come all the way out here to pee?"



I didnt say it out loud but the idea of it also turned me off. Not just the outside pooping but the idea that when the sun was down I'd be in a small box in the middle of the dark.



Before leaning back down to the rocks I noticed a trail close to the outhouse. There was a rope tied between trees blocking it off and it had scraps of orange paper hanging from it.



"What about that?" I asked Blake.



I watched his face as he looked towards the rope and saw the confusion wash over him as well.



"I dont know..."



He stomped up and out of the creek and headed toward the rope so I followed. We stood at the rope looking beyond into the woods that with every inch grew denser and darker. As a kid I didnt fully understand what it was that was scaring me. All I knew is that as I looked farther amd farther beyond something inside me was telling me to run.



"Hey!" My mom shouted from the house. The shout made my heart jump to my throat and I physically lunged forward to catch it.



"Get away from there!"



Blake immediately peddled backward away from the rope as I stood still staring.



"Whats over there mom?" Blake asked.



"Thats someone else's property so dont be going past the rope."



At the time in didn't think to far beyond it because back home we lived next to farmers and mom always told us they would shoot us if they saw us in their fields. I simply saw this as a ritual that was not strictly bound to Ohio.



The first day of being out of state slowly fizzled into an average day of being home. We played outside for a few hours and the sun slowly set. We went inside for dinner and dad brought up the idea of having a fire. After eating dad lit a small fire in the fire pit outback and gave each of us a stick that he had sharpened.



The three of us roasted marshmallows in silence. I couldnt help but notice my brother sneaking glances at the roped off path. I will never forget the way the fire light lit up his eyes in the dark.



Without words spoken between us I still knew that the feeling of fear was welling up inside of him as well. My sister on the other hand was seemingly unphased.



After a short time mom called us back inside and dad poured a bucket of water over the coals. The back yard changed from a half lit opera of shadows to sheer darkness. As we walked back inside I watched as Blake turned around quickly and peared into the dark.



"What is it?" I asked.



He didn't answer me, instead he ran inside. The sight of my older brother who I always pictured as the brave one , running in fear had jump started my heart. His fear transfered to me and I also ran in behind him. 



Later in the middle of the night I was startled awake by a howling noise. I sat up in my bed to see Blake was also sitting straight up in his bed. He had wrapped his blanket around his body and forced himself into the back corner of the wall.



"What is that coyotes?" I asked him. 



"I dont know, but its been going on for like thirty minutes."



As my eyes adjusted to the dark of our room I could faintly make out his face. His eyes were wide and locked on the doorway.



"I heard my name..." He whispered.



"Like mom or dad?" 



"No...listen."



As i sat and listened more intently i noticed that the howling wasn't from an animal. It sounded like a person mimicking an animal howl. Then it happened. I heard as one of the howls started they echoed the name Blake. long and drawn out. I looked over at Blake and couod see him shaking violently.



This continued through the night. The howls continued to echo outside and eventually I couldn't keep my eyes open despite my fear.



When I awoke the next morning Blake was gone.
