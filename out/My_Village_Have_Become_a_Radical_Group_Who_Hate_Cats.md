My fingers still hurt writing this, but I have to get it all down. From what I’m aware, there is no drug epidemic in my neighbourhood. There were no political groups, clubs, societies, or even coffee mornings for that matter. We were not a close-knit community, but that’s not to say we disliked each other. Like an unwritten rule, people would only talk to one another unless they absolutely needed to. Call it antisocial, bizarre, call it whatever. We have not been exposed to any experimental pesticides that may have influenced us, this being because we live in a suburb miles away from any farm or crop field. No one who lives in the village is diagnosed with a severe mental illness. No there is no explicit reason for the undeniable fact that my village hates cats.

 

I’m not entirely sure when the first instance was. It could have been years in the making. Things like “You spoil that cat”, I didn’t see them hit and run and “Your cat keeps climbing into my garden and digging up flowers”. Typical banter, mistakes, and friendly rivalry between man and “beast” that has trickled through generations to the scale its now become. To me, the first instance was December 14th, 2023. The roads were especially icy given the winter month’s snowstorm, and I distinctly remember my mum warning me to watch my step on the way to the shops. The local radio station nicknamed the storm “Jackson”. A name they coined from the character “Jack Frost” who they believed to be the “son” of Frost. Not the best name and hardly unique, but it was impressive nonetheless given the simple-mindedness of my village. It was tragic. There’s no other way to put it really. A delivery driver’s van had skidded across the length of the road and knocked over an old lady killing her instantly along with the driver who shortly crashed into a telephone pole trying to swerve out of the way. The news spread like wildfire, surprisingly quicker than the radio station could report it. Videos were leaked from security cameras and ring doorbells circulated online. It was Shared, re-uploaded, and liked and small podcasts equally spoke about the event applying their own spin or interpretation of what happened.

 

Lukas Wright’s podcast “Lukas is Right” garnered the most attention. Lukas’s interpretation is as follows.

 

“It’s no coincidence if you ask me! Audio listeners I apologise for this but I’m going to pull the video up for those watching at home…… You see there! Right there! That is a black cat, and you know what they say about black cats. Bad luck charms! The lad probably swerved out of the way of the cat and ended up hitting the poor woman as a result. If you think I’m wrong, then I’ll gladly debate it with you on air at the Lukas is Right studio. Catch you all in the next episode.”

 

Lukas Wright’s “studio” was nothing more than an old beaten-up shed in his parent’s back garden. How do I know? Well, that’s because I went to school with him. Lukas Wright finished school with no qualifications and no desire to find a job. In the words of Lukas Wright “Popularity will get me everywhere and everything”, it’s a shame this vision was limited to his childhood home and a teenager’s bed he’d have to squeeze himself into each night. Lukas Wright was a no-one. Deluded by the idea that he was a hometown celebrity. This was until the episode of the black cat.

 

Lukas Wright welcomed guests each week onto his podcast and debated the events of the “Jackson car crash”.  Lukas Wright was not a smart man, but it only takes one smart man to believe a dumb man for a leader to be born. Lukas additionally welcomed co-host Alex Thatcher who was introduced as a “Mythology expert”. This was the only thing Lukas stated that wasn’t a lie. Alex Thatcher was indeed a “Mythology expert” with a degree in folklore and mythology. A man with an education is not always a smart man. Alex Thatcher is clear evidence of this. Most debates would go like this.

 

Guest: “Do you really think those poor people died because of a cat? I understand the whole swerving out of the way part, but seriously? You think it was bad luck!?”

 

Lukas: “Listen buddy all I’m saying is that black cats have been known to spread bad luck for hundreds of years. If it’s gone on that long, then do you really think it’s not true?”

 

Alex: “If I may interject Lukas? Cats were worshipped by the Egyptians. Many hieroglyphics and tapestries depict this, and they are even depicted as Gods. Bastet for example is a Goddess who harbours protection and maternal qualities. A mother can be dangerous, and protection is usually in the form of inflicting suffering on an opposition to protect one’s side. A Goddess would possess great power and would not falter in the face of opposition. If this were to be passed down to everyday house cats, then do you not think the black cat seen at the “Jackson car crash” could have manipulated the vehicle to protect itself from harm?”

 

Lukas would edit the video and the audio to fit the narrative of him and Alex winning the debate every single time. This progressed over an entire month and Lukas even amassed a hefty following on multiple platforms earning him a seat at the village’s official radio station. This would provide him the credibility, but it wasn’t enough. He wanted more. He wanted to lead people, he wanted to be “the people’s voice” whether they wanted one or not. Cats were a reoccurring topic. He would seemingly shoehorn them into entirely unrelated conversations.

 

My parents would keep the radio playing during mealtimes listening with bated breath for what Lukas would say. Our family-owned a small ginger cat which we called Benji. It didn’t take a genius to realise my parents had grown distant from him. Before they would leave their bedroom door open for him to come in on an evening and snuggle down on the bed, but now they keep it closed; ignoring his whining to be let inside. His meals fell to me. My parents stopped subscribing to his premium meal plan and instead bought generic store-brand kibble with ingredients listed the length of my arm. I tried sneaking in some shredded chicken from a roast dinner to which they stook their nose up at me hissing.

 

“Don’t you think he’s gotten more than he deserves already?”

 

I was completely thrown off my feet and sent scrambling for an answer, continuously losing my footing I couldn’t give one. Paralysed with shock all I could do was place Benji’s food down for him to eat. Benji inched forward to eat licking his chops before my mum crouched down and handpicked the chicken out of his bowl placing it back on my plate.

 

“He’s on a diet. He wouldn’t want that anyway.”

 

She placed my plate back on to the dinner table along with theirs and my little brother’s as they sat down to eat. I’d lost my appetite.

 

“Sit down at once! Your mother has slaved away cooking you this meal and you look as if you’re going to be poisoned.”

 

I hesitated in the doorway fidgeting from side to side.

 

“Sit down!”

 

I didn’t eat much of my dinner. Pushing the chicken around my plate in an arrangement that made it look like I had touched it, but they knew. I thought they would forget. How wrong I was.

 

There have been countless incidents over the past few months. One night I woke to the sound of meowing and looked out my window to see a member of the neighbourhood watch walking across the street to kick a cat lying on the pavement. Every couple of weeks a Cat Café, Cat rescue sanctuary, or charity shop will be targeted in the night to be left as nothing more than shattered glass, splintered wood, and fractured dreams. Cats have been going missing as well. There are hundreds of posts on Facebook of families reporting a missing cat that isn’t limited to just my village. Villages in the hundreds in all directions from mine. Lukas Wright is a hero. A snake oil merchant who has sold his followers a lie leaving him the only one to profit. The village is run rampant and flooded with rats, and desertion of funding since no businesses want to open shop out of fear of being targeted. The only thing left for the group was to make a demonstration. A message to all that cats and cat lovers would not be tolerated.

 

“Where am I?! Hey! Hey! Where the hell am I !?”

 

I couldn’t see. A sack had been tied over my head, the stench of musk and oil smothering my nose and mouth. I thrashed against the bindings tied around my wrists and ankles, the rope dragging back and forth across my skin burning the flesh in searing agony. I screamed out for help only to receive my own pleas echoing back towards me, the pathetic whimpering sending me over the edge. I was suddenly blinded by a single light bulb overhead that swayed from left to right revealing the silhouettes of numerous people beneath.

 

“Wh- Where the hell am I!? Who are you, people!?”

 

One of the figures, a man, stepped closer bending down so his face was mere inches from mine.

 

“You disgust me!”

 

Spitting in my face as he stood back up and stepped back into the shadows. I thrashed more in my bindings rocking the chair onto its front legs in an attempt to stand. I didn’t care what happened. If I could stand then I could run and all I could do was try at the very least. A steel boot plunged out from the darkness slamming into my chest sending me crashing into the brick wall behind me and sliding down so that I was now sideways in the chair.

 

“Black magic Worshipper!”, “Feline Fellon!”, “Lukas Wright the Right!”

 

All chanting, each phrase echoing throughout the dimly lit room and reverberating in my ears. I was freezing, the chill air like knives against my naked body. I closed my eyes hoping it was all a dream. A nightmare. A terrible horrendous nightmare. I felt a warm sticky substance slowly ooze down across my face and body. I tried to open my eyes, but I couldn’t. My body sticking together, and my eyes glued shut against the ooze overcome with intense stinging that made my tears well up and drown my pupils as they failed to escape my fused eyelids. I gasped for air, the darkness and ooze making me feel as if I were drowning as the liquid rushed in to meet me. It tasted sweet. It tasted like honey.

 

I fought to see, the pain like being stung by a million bees directly into the whites of my eyes. My eyes felt as if they were void of moisture, the tears taunting me as they refused to rejoin my iris only to wet the space behind my eyelids. Still gasping for air I choked on the sudden change of fur being introduced as I inhaled sending it spiralling down my throat and scratching down the sides, my mouth feeling dry and vomit crawling up my throat. I endeavoured to see. I had to. Strands of stretching honey covered my vision as I pried my eyelids open, tears cascading down my cheeks and into my mouth the salt a welcome change. I wish I never looked. A man had crouched down before me holding a tub of toothpicks as two other men seized my arm to prevent me from fidgeting.

 

The man placed a toothpick under my fingernail, the sharp prick making me wince, before picking up a small hammer. I screamed out in agony, my vocal cords beginning to seize as the sound of an animal echoed back at me as the many lightly tapped each of the toothpicks with the hammer driving them under the nail. Like a water gun, blood burst out with such pressure it sprayed the man in the face each time as he licked his lips. With each finger he’d grin, the blood splatter staining his white teeth. Each toe he’d squeal with glee reciting the nursery rhyme of how “this little piggy went to the market” squeezing my toe playfully with blood gushing out from beneath. The men then released me giving me a moment to catch my breath before reappearing and taping my mouth shut with duct tape and placing a helmet over my head. The men untied me and stood me up still holding my arms in restraint.

 

 The sound of giggling and singing echoed throughout as many dazzling and shiny shooed feet entered the room blindfolded as the children were led by their parents. Each held a small orange paper tail in their hands as they were guided towards me. I tried to scream but the duct tape only made it come out as loud moans resembling the meows of a cat as the men spun me round to face the wall behind. The sound of light footsteps echoing closer and closer before a sharp pain pierced my lower thigh as my muffled screams grew louder and louder. The pitter-patter of feet, the agonising pain as they pierced my flesh, the paper dangling against my skin, and the giggling that followed as their footsteps grew more distant as they were led out of the room. I dropped to my knees in exhaustion, but the men didn’t make me stand as more and more tails were placed along my neck and shoulders as blood trickled down and pooled in the space between the back of my calves.

 

I fell unconscious after a while, waking up in a puddle of water in the street during a torrential rainstorm washing away the honey that fused to my skin as the fur clumped around me into little hairballs. My arms shot up to remove the helmet as I gasped for air for the final time, making sure to breathe in the whole world and more out of fear it could be the last time. Pain surging throughout my body I looked down at the helmet and the cartoonish ginger cat looking back at me. My parents didn’t question why I came home naked and covered in blood. They didn’t question why I cried every time I saw Benji or when they took him away. They didn’t question why I averted my eyes from the village basketball poster for the match against the Cheering Cheetahs. I can’t stand to look at a cat anymore. I don’t hate them, but my village does. I’m a prisoner of their beliefs. I only advise you to look out for your communities. I think I’m beyond help but I’m open suggestion.
