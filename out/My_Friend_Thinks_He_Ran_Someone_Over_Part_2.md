It’s been only a few days since I published my story and I’ve been getting a few comments on it, and one really caught my eye. It said “Have skin walkers been reported in your area? I’m not good at explaining what they are, so Google it or maybe someone later will hope on and can explain them.”

Now I’m not someone who’s big on crypto zoology, nor do I really believe in the supernatural; But reading that comment made me pause for a moment as that could have explained most of the situation. So here’s my theory. Caleb was drunk driving home one night and in the darkness hit what had looked like the girl he described, and in an act of desperation the skin walker morphed into the form of a deer. Now I know Caleb, but not that much, so he may have been experiencing some form of denial as he believed that he hit a girl. Then he went to me and we buried the deer in the woods. My question is, if that was a skin walker then why did it not revert back to whatever its original form was when it died? Now as I was mulling over these questions the answer hit me. What if it’s still alive?

Yesterday I hit that conclusion, and it was thankfully still light outside. I grabbed my keys and floored it, trying to remember the route as best as I could. It felt like I was lost until I saw the familiar tire tracks leading off the road. I swerved my car, following them, the sun was starting to set around this time and my headlights were the only thing illuminating the path. A chill went up my spine as I pressed on the brakes; in front of me was the grave, but no dirt covered the person sized hole.

I panicked, my mind racing and so many thoughts penetrating my brain. Was Caleb in danger? Am I in danger? What about the girl on the news, was this really her? Without getting out of my car I yanked the gear shift back into reverse, mud flying from my tires. I craned my neck back, racing from the trees and back onto the road. I remember the sign saying “30 MPH”, but I was going way more than that, couldn’t have been less than 50 as I sped down the winding road. I needed to know if Caleb was alright.

I eventually made it to his street, and the inner speed demon was extinguished as I stared at the scene in front of me. There had to be at least a couple of cop cars and an ambulance. Someone was being loaded into the back, it had to be Caleb. I couldn’t think straight, how did it know where he lived? Did it know where I lived? I coasted back to my street and slowly passed by my house. I’m someone who can be pretty forgetful when it comes to turning off the lights so it was strange to see that every single light in my house was off; and my front door had visible damage.

I’m currently at a McDonalds right now using the free wifi, I looked more into the girl who went missing and it seems that she lived with her parents before she disappeared. Thankfully they live only a few miles away from here so I’m going to see if I can get any answers, I’ll keep you all updated.
