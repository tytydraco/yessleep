I am convinced that there is nothing heavier, nothing more crushing, than the weight of guilt. Its pressure is greater than any underwater abyss, it's thicker than concrete, and its binds are stronger than any chain humans have ever forged. 

And for the past month, I have been its prisoner. 

My parents are second generation Americans, originally from Germany. Growing up, my cultural influences were a bizarre chimera of German, Latin, and American. 

My father was a prideful man. In that he resolved that he and his family were and would always be Germans, regardless of where we made our beds. The fatherland, in his mind, was our true home. All of us.

I wish I had the chance to tell him he was wrong. Despite the heavy influences in my life, I am not truly German. I was raised around mostly 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and even further generation Americans. I am far more like them than my father would ever care to know.

I speak the language, I know the traditions, and I have family who are through and through German. But I am not them. I'm not like my parents, and most importantly, I'm not like my grandparents. I am not and I never, ever will be. 

My grandfather had been a doctor since the 1970’s. His home is in Munich, where he lived with my grandmother until his death in 2011. I did meet him as a child, my parents took me to Munich about 5 years before his death. But honestly, I was too young to remember most of it - only his thin pencil mustache and how he screamed at my grandmother. 

She's a short woman, but her stubbornness makes up for any lack in height she could ever have. Old fashioned, too, but I suppose I cannot fault her for that. She was raised in a different time. A worse time. But am I to let her outdated dogma weigh on my life? On my happiness? 

Family always takes care of family. That's what they all keep saying. If you ask me, it's all been an excuse. Another shackle of guilt spun around my neck. 

My grandfather was a high strung man. Strict in both his work and home life. Always on the verge of snapping at someone - waiters, store clerks, my grandmother. I think that's what did him in. You can't walk around with that kind of anger, it weighs on the body. High blood pressure is what my parents told me. A heart attack in the middle of one of his golf games. 

I honestly have no idea how it affected my grandmother. She made it hard to tell. She went on with her life with the same stubbornness she always carried. 

Was she sad? The man she had married and spent over 50 years with was suddenly gone. Was she happy? It was no secret that he was verbally abusive. And it's my very strong suspicion it was more than verbal when we weren't around. She seldom spoke of it. 

I've grown to despise my parents this past month. This is entirely their fault. They've shucked their responsibility onto me while they trounce about in New York, celebrating their anniversary. Family takes care of family until you don't you can unload the burden, I guess.

Grandma had a stroke last year at her work. A big one. She survived and has needed a caretaker ever since. She was placed in assisted living afterwards while she recovered. And there, everything was fine. She had people whose job it was to take care of her. 

Everyone always pretends. They pretend to care more than they do, that people like my grandmother are more than a burden. Yet another ball and chain tied to us by guilt. No more, I've freed myself and I'm not afraid to say what everyone thinks deep inside. I was glad we had somewhere we could put her and forget about her. Like a box of old memorabilia that you lock away in your attic. 

I wish we had left her there. I wish she never made it out. 

Twice my parents forced me to go visit her. An excruciatingly long flight. And for what? A putrid facility that reeked of urine and disinfectant. A woman who could barely speak in a manner that was understandable anymore. 

And I didn't know her! That's what my parents, my father, never understood. He expects me to love this woman - this broken, hateful, vile woman just because she birthed my father? She was practically a stranger to me even before the stroke. 

What hope was there of forming a bond now? 

But nonetheless, she recovered enough to move back home to Munich. We didn't have the money for a full time caretaker. And my parents were about to go on their vacation. So, naturally, the responsibility - the chore, rather - fell to me. 

Nevermind my studies, my job, my relationship. No, those must be put on hold. It's my responsibility to the family. What a joke. My entire life put on pause to go play maid for a woman already one foot in the grave.

I should've laughed in their faces. But those shackles, those anchors of guilt, they kept me down. Kept me quiet and compliant. 

So off to Munich I went. The same flights as when I was a child. The same taxis, the same roads, the same dusty, outdated house. A relic from an older time. I wish it had stayed behind. I wish time could somehow have swallowed it up. 

I crossed the threshold and was greeted with the smell of urine and disinfectant. She had brought home her own little slice of the old folks home. That smell hasn't left my nostrils since. 

The old grandfather clock stood in the living room, loud and obnoxious as ever. I'm the type of person who has trouble sleeping with noise, and that clock has been the bane of my sleep every single night I've spent in this decrepit hell.

My grandmother had arrived from the care center only a few minutes before. The aides rattled off a series of instructions for me. Pills in the morning. Blue first, then white. A crushed half-tab before bed. Cream for the rash on her neck. Don't forget to change the dressing on her foot. Don’t let her out of bed unsupervised. Don't let her eat alone. Don’t let her near stairs.

It was a list of don’ts. Not one of them told me how I was supposed to live here, how I was supposed to stand the smell, the silence, or the way her eyes trailed me when she thought I wasn’t looking.

Then, they rushed out swiftly. Like they were in a hurry. 

I tried so hard, really I did. My guilt spurred me to put in a happy face, to attempt to make conversation. I asked her about her stay at the home, if they treated her well. She did respond. A slurred form of german, muffled by the sagging, useless flesh of the paralyzed half of her face. I had to ask her to repeat herself twice, and pretended to understand her after, making up the best response I could. 

The mix of boiling awkwardness, piercing embarrassment, and dull frustration was almost more than I could handle. 

I set her up in the downstairs bedroom.

She did speak while I changed the sheets and cleaned up, but whether it was in protest or something else, I truly couldn't say. 

And that damn grandfather clock ticked the entire time. Louder now, somehow. Like it was syncing up with my pulse.

I couldn't sleep that night. Tick, tick, tick. Then every hour, a series of painfully loud gongs. How she slept through, I'll never know. I remember staring at the ceiling that first night and thinking to myself, “30 more days to go.” I wanted to cry. 

Then the clock struck midnight. The gong rang out. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12…

13? That couldn't be right. And yet I was sure I hadn't miscounted.

I got out of bed both defeated by both sleeplessness and unsettled curiosity. I left the confines of the spare room that was mine for the month, the one that used to be my grandfather’s office before he died. It still smelled faintly of cigar smoke and that sour cologne he always wore. 

The door opened into the long hallway - dreary even in the brightest of days. But now, in the middle of the night, it was a bottomless pit, a gaping maw waiting with eager anticipation to swallow me. I shook off my fears and grounded myself in reality. It's just an old house and possibly a broken old clock. 

I entered the darkness, my eyes struggling to adjust to the inky black corridor. I heard nothing but the ticking of the clock from the living room and the labored breaths of my sleeping grandmother. Disgust filled me as I passed her room, peaking inside to make sure she was alright. Her inhales sucked on the limp flesh of her left side, creating a revolting slurping noise. I pushed down the cruel thoughts that bubbled inside me, but I couldn’t clear my disgust. I kept walking.

My fears had left me and in their place was an annoyed dread. The constant noises, that awful smell - sleep wouldn't be gracing me tonight. 

So instead, I tried to text my girlfriend. I had meant to earlier, I was sure she had left a slew of messages for me in my absence. But no, nothing. I frowned. This wasn't at all like helike her. Then I noticed the symbol in the top right of my screen. No connection. Why would I expect any different? It seemed that my time here would be completely unfiltered. There would be no escape for me into the outside world. 

I walked past the clock and into the kitchen. Maybe a cup of tea would help. Something warm, maybe it would even ease me back to sleep. The kettle was old, but solid - cast iron crusted with limescale from decades of use. It took ages to heat up, but I had time to spare. I wondered how many generations of my family had used this very kettle.

A new fear struck me - different from the unease I’d felt when the clock rang thirteen. This one came not from what I heard, but from what I didn’t. The soft wheezing sounds from my grandmother's bed had ceased. 

I ran to her room, intending to check her breathing, her vitals. I froze in the doorway. She was sitting upright on the bed, her legs hanging over the edge pale, gnarled sticks. She was staring into my eyes with an intensity I had never felt before. And her smile. How half of a face can convey such evil with a mere smile I will never know.

Naturally, I spoke to her. Called her name, even gingerly touched her shoulder. Her eyes followed me, but she gave no response. I laid her back in bed, placed the covers over her and went back to the kitchen. I turned the kettle off before going back to my room and locking the door. 

I heard a dull thump from above me. Not footsteps but something heavier. A dragging sound, slow and wet.

The attic.

I’d never been up there - my grandfather had kept it locked, and I’d never cared enough to ask. But now, the thuds came more frequently. Rhythmic and intentional.

I got up, grabbed a flashlight, and climbed the steps. The hatch door was closed but had no lock. I hesitated before unlatching it. As I opened it, warm air hit me. Humid, like breath and rotten. I shined the light inside.
Nothing but dust and cobwebs.

But on the floor, in a shallow ring of dust, were footprints. Bare, human footprints leading toward the back corner and stopping there.
I left immediately to check that my grandmother was still in bed, and she was. I went back to bed, but sleep never came. 

In fact, it rarely did throughout the next few weeks. I called the home she had been staying at before my arrival and questioned them about the incident that night. They told me it was normal for her. Apparently she was a sleep walker. 

I tried my best to bond with her, truly I did. But how could I? Half the time she was on medication, and even when she wasn’t, I could barely understand her. 

One night, she somehow managed to sneak into the kitchen cabinet and had taken a bottle of wine, which she apparently used to down her medication. I was unaware of this when I found her sitting on the armchair in the living room. I sat across from her and tried to make conversation.

She made these odd noises. Like the beginnings of a laugh. But they lacked the power to follow through the entire sound. Her eyes eventually found me and she began to speak. Quiet, guttural strings of German that sounded more like joyful sighs than speech. It was very difficult to make out, but I was able to catch 3 phrases - “Dachboden,” “Sie brennen,” and “Er kommt.”

Naturally I was unsettled. I asked her about it, but she didn’t answer. She was doing it again, that smile - half of her face curled upwards as if she knew something I didn’t -some joke, some gossip, some secret. This time, only anger filled me. I paused my life for her sake, and she didn’t even have the decency to attempt to make it bearable. 

She was dead still in her chair. I was still in mine. But the room did not lack movement. The dust-yellowed lamp cast her shadow on the faded white wall behind her. It writhed, spasming in a frenzy. The shadow’s head spun wildly back and forth, the arms flailed and twisted at impossible angles, all while her body was still as stone, staring me down. 

I was frozen in horror, my anger had drained like air out of a sinking ship. I think she could feel it. No, I know she could. It gave her immense joy. 

The slack half of her face slowly curved and wrinkled to match the rest of her face. 

Her face, once warped and drooping, now beamed with perfect symmetry. That smile - full and knowing - wasn’t hindered by stroke or age or illness. It was deliberate, controlled. 

I backed out of the room slowly, as if away from a wild animal. When I rose from my seat, she mirrored my movements perfectly. Standing without any help for the first time in months. I took a step backwards towards the front door, she took a step backwards to match me.

Behind her was that same endless black of the hallway. It was like a thick fog. Another step back, and she matched it. One more step and she was shrouded in black, as if she had vanished in front of my eyes. I saw nothing. I ran for the door, quickly covering the few more feet in between me and it. I heard her match my speed. Only she moved vertically now, as a spider ascends a wall. 

I threw the door open and flung myself into the open night air. 

I called emergency services. That got me little more than a lecture about elder care and stress-induced hallucinations. Apparently, I was the problem - not the ancient house, not the crooked smile, not the thing that scuttled up the wall like a spider. I needed to take this into my own hands. 

I knew the truth now. This was an act, a lie. This was theater - a long, grotesque performance. She wasn’t some frail, helpless woman, and I wasn’t here to help her. I was her plaything. Her prey. And I had no intention of being devoured by this monster masquerading as a woman.

The following week, I wrestled with the chains that had kept me in place. I knew what needed to be done. It was evil, it was wrong. Or so I told myself. But that, too, was a lie. I had seen wrong. I had seen evil. It had smiled at me twice.

I didn’t sleep that week. Not a minute. Instead, I turned inward, folding in on myself like a cocooned insect - waiting to emerge, not as something good, but something necessary. Something free. 

It was an eternity of struggle, and yet only a brief moment. I succeeded in breaking my shackles. I emerged slowly from the cocoon I had spun for myself. Hesitant. Awkward. Not yet the thing I would become, but no longer the thing I was.

I didn’t act right away. I observed. I studied. I listened. She was taunting me. Most of the day, like a corpse still waiting for its cue. But there were moments, flickers of something beneath the surface. A glint in her eye. A murmur too soft to catch. Once, I passed her door and heard her speaking in German - a long string of it, fast and clear, too fast for her broken mouth to manage. When I opened the door, she was asleep. 

Sometimes, I would walk by her room and see her whole face smiling at me from the corner of my eye. But when I turned to look, all I found was the sagging, half-dead mask I had come to know. I couldn’t bear it.

I told myself it was just a test. That I needed to know for sure.

But that was a lie.

I wanted to hurt her.

I wanted to strip away the act - to see what would come crawling out from behind that broken mask if I were to chip it. 

So, when I made her dinner, I added half a spoonful of white powder scraped from an old tin I found in the cellar. The label had worn away years ago, but I knew what it was. She barely noticed the taste. Just opened her mouth like a baby bird and swallowed it all down with that same blank expression she always wore. No chewing, no protest. Not even a slurred thank you. Some of it dribbled down her face. I wanted to vomit. My vision was nearly red from rage. But I restrained myself. 

I watched her all night.

She didn’t get sick.

She didn’t even cough.

She just sat in her chair, that half-paralyzed face drooping like a melting candle. 
In the morning, I checked the dish. Licked my finger and ran it around the rim.
Nothing.

No residue. No trace of the powder. Like it had never been there at all. 

I stopped giving her the pills. First, just the blue ones. Then the white. She didn’t notice. Or maybe she did and didn’t care. She didn’t speak up.

I watched her closely. Waiting for a decline, some sign of pain. Nothing. She only got clearer. Sharper. Her eyes followed me more. She smiled more.

And once, late at night, I saw her standing perfectly still in the middle of the hallway. Just standing. Like she was waiting for something. Or someone.

I went back to bed and locked the door.
The lesson I needed to take from my 2 failed attempts were clear: half measures would not do. I needed to embrace my newfound freedom completely, utterly free myself from the shackles of guilt that others had put me in. 

And that’s exactly what I did.

She was sitting in the same armchair in the living room, her back to the kitchen, where I stood scrubbing dishes. The kettle rested on the stove beside me, still warm. I looked from it, to her, and back again.

I felt no fear. Not even hesitation.

Only purpose.

That night, I reclaimed my life. With each strike, the cocoon unraveled - those silken threads of guilt, of obligation, of family. I was tearing through them.

The anchors that had dragged behind me my entire life snapped, one by one.

The blood that stained my skin was a healing balm, I’ve never before or since known such release, such joy. 

She would never smile her crooked smile at me again. Her vile eyes would never meet mine again. 

The house is silent now.

No clock, no wheezing, no 
whispers in the hallway.

Just silence.

For the first time in a long time, I can rest knowing I am truly free.
