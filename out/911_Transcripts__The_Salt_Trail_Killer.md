**Transcripts of a series of calls received by the Delacosa department of police and emergency services on 08/05/23 and 09/05/23, the series of calls lasted from 05:21pm to the final call which occurred at 10:47pm.**

*911 Dispatcher Sakkil received the initial call on 5:21pm, the call was from Lindel Brook, a 39 years old local office worker who lived alone in a 2 story house with a sizable backyard facing some dense woods. The house is near the outskirts of the neighborhood with woods on two sides of it, the main road on another side and a run down, abandoned house next to it.*

**Dispatcher**: 911, what's your emergency?

**Mr Brook**: Umm... \**Caller pauses for a second*\* I don't think it's an emergency or not anymore at least but I just came back from work and after coming inside I think there's been a break-in. Anyway, I would like someone to come here.

**Dispatcher**: What is your name, sir?

**Mr Brook**: It is Lindel Brook.

**Dispatcher**: Very well, what is your address?

**Mr Brook**: 10211, Avery Lane.

**Dispatcher**: Sir, I have officers enroute to your location, how long ago did you reach your home?

**Mr Brook**: It's been around 15 minutes.

**Dispatcher**: I see, is there any time frame for the break in which you could guess?

**Mr Brook**: I don't know for a time frame, there doesn't seem to be any damage aside from moved furniture, there is one thing that's bothering me though...

**Dispatcher**: What would that be?

**Mr Brook**: I am sure someone broke into the house but not sure how, the locks weren't broken and neither were any windows, you see, whoever broke in seems to have only stolen a bag of salt which I keep in my kitchen, it's missing and there's a very faint trail of salt along the kitchen and downstairs floor but it just leads to the bathroom and... stops. There is no accessible window in the bathroom so I don't understand where the person could've gone.

**Dispatcher**: Remain calm Mr Brook, the officers will be on the scene shortly and in the meantime I recommend you stay watchful as the burglar could've left more signs.

*The call ends shortly after, Officers Harol and Aryan arrive at the scene and conducted an investigation. They found no signs of forced entry through a door or window but did indeed see the trail of salt heading to the bathroom, after no more evidence could be found they left the scene.*

*The second call arrived at 9:21pm, 4 hours after the initial call from Mr Brook.*

**Dispatcher**: 911, what's your emergency?

**Mr Brook**: \**Sounding worried*\* Hello, I had some officers come to a few hours ago for a break in and now I think someone is roaming around the exterior of my house.

**Dispatcher**: Remain calm Mr Brook, I have dispatched officers to your scene, in the meantime please tell me about your situation.

**Mr Brook**: Alright, Alright, Around 10 minutes ago I heard some knocks on my window, I had my blinds on at the time so I quickly opened them and saw... not a person \**sounding increasingly afraid*\* but some wet white bits of a substance stuck to the window which I can only assume to be made of... salt.

**Dispatcher**: Sir, so you saw no person at the window whatsoever? Have you had any other encounters such as this?

**Mr Brook**: No, no, that was the only time it happened, the thing that scares me the most though is that my bedroom window... is on the second floor.

**Dispatcher**: Sir, was there any form of ladder or way for a person to climb there? Is it possible the substance was thrown on to your window instead of being placed there physically by someone?

**Mr Brook**: There was no ladder there.... I suppose you are right in that it might have been thrown, the knocks were so... natural though.

*The call ends, Officers Aryan and Richard arrive at the scene where Mr Brook shows them the substance on his window. They find no person around the premises but find a faint trail of salt leading into the woods, upon Mr Brook's behest they decide to take a look in the woods, the salt trail eventually disappears but upon more searching they find a considerable puddle of moist salt right under an unused water pipe, it is unknown how it could've gotten there as the salt couldn't possibly have ended up there by simply coming out of the pipe as it is not actively draining out waste from anywhere. Upon returning from the woods the officers tell Mr Brook to call if he sees anymore suspicious activity and then they depart.*

*The third call arrived at 10:34pm, this time Mr Brook appeared to be in considerably more distress than before.*

**Dispatcher**: 911, Mr Brook, is this related to your previous calls?

**Mr Brook**: \**In considerable distress*\* Yes! Yes it is!

**Dispatcher**: Please calm down Mr Brook, explain your situation.

**Mr Brook**: It's happening again and again! There are knocks on the windows, on the doors, it even looks he is banging on the pipes attached to the walls outside! But I can't see him at all Every time after the knocks there are the same patches of moist salt on the windows and doors!

**Dispatcher**: How long have these happened for?

\**A sound which could have been knocks on a window can be heard*\*

**Mr Brook**: A few minutes ago I went outside with a bat and threatened whoever it was to face me! What I saw outside? A trail of salt, but not just a crumb trail but footprints! Footprints in moist, wet salt! Please you have to come here!

**Dispatcher**: Do not panic sir, officers are already on their way, in the meantime please remain on the line until they arrive.

\**More knocks on a window can be heard*\*

**Mr Brook**: LISTEN! It keeps happening!, \**Wail*\* why is it always me...!?

**Dispatcher**: Sir, please try to remain calm, I understand that this must be horrible to experience but please try to focus. I recommend that you try to get into a secure room without any windows until the officers arrive and make sure to remain on line for the time being.

**Mr Brook**: \**Slightly calmer*\* Yes, yes of course. I... I can take refuge in the bathroom for the time being, it has no windows and I can lock myself in until the officers arrive.

**Dispatcher**: Thank you sir, I assure you, it will all be well, just wait until the officers arrive.

*Mr Brook can be heard moving to the bathroom and closing the door, the knocks which occurred every few minutes seemed to continue but quickly stopped as the officers arrived*.

*Officers Aryan and Richard arrive on the scene, they try to console Mr Brook and conduct an investigation around the house, they find remnants of moist salt on most windows and doors of the house, they noted that the salt was not on the any of the doorknobs to implicate attempted entry.*

*There is a trail of salt footprints leading to the woods, the trail was noted to look odd, the prints were very evenly spaced out unlike the way a regular person would have walked. Officers Aryan and Richard follow the trail hoping to find the criminal whilst Mr Brook locks himself in the bathroom for safety. In the woods, Officers Richard and Aryan find that the trail ends at the same water pipe which was found by officers earlier that day, the pipe had a fresh, moist, puddle of wet salt under it and the unnatural footprints ended next to it.*

*The final call from Mr Brook arrived at 10:47pm, moments after the two officers found the the end of the salt trail.*

**Dispatcher**: Mr Brook? I believe the officers are already near your home's premises?

**Mr Brook:** \*Sounding e*xtremely scared*\* Send them back to the house RIGHT NOW! Oh gods.. he's in my house! I keep hearing strange noises which sound like they are coming from in the walls! He's here somewhere and I am scared! \**sobs*\* Oh god, I don't want to die...! \**Strange echo-like noises*\*

**Dispatcher**: The officers are on their way sir, please try to remain safe, they are extremely close to your location!

**Mr Brook**: Yes, thanks, I am in the bathroo- \**Loud Noises*\*, wait-

**Dispatcher**: Sir? Are you alrigh-

**Mr Brook**: \**sob*\* I-I just noticed, salt is dripping... out of the sink...

**Dispatcher:** Sir-

*Mr Brook screams*

*Loud Metallic Noises*

**Mr Brook**: \**Scream*\* IT'S HERE! IT'S IN THE WALLS, IT'S IN THE WALLS, THE DRAINS, THE PIPES! \**Scream*\*

*Loud Crashes and screams can be heard and unhuman wails which sound almost like laughter start as Mr Brook screams, he can be heard banging at the door as wails fill the room and he screams in pain. The call ends*

*Officers Aryan and Richard arrived back at the house around 3 minutes after the end of the call, blood could be seen flowing out of the bathroom which was locked from the inside. The officers broke down the door and entered, what they saw were the bathroom walls and floor covered with smears of blood and salt as well as tufts of what appeared to be chunks of Mr Brook's hair. While there were some chunks of gore in the bathroom Mr Brook himself was not found, moist salt and blood was seen to be covering the sink and bathtub, the sink in particular was also covered in salt.*

*Upon further investigation with the presence of a professional team, the pipes of the building were found to be covered in salt and blood from the inside, upon a full search of the drainage system of the neighborhood and surrounding woods a discovery was made. An unused septic tank connected to the old water pipe in the woods was found to be covered in moist salt, along with the salt some torn packaging of a grocery store salt bag was found in the same tank, the pipes leading to the septic chamber are too small for any animal to go through.*

*Days after the discovery of the septic tank, the investigation was abruptly taken over by the federal government from the local police department.*

*This incident awaits a proper clarification or any explanation as the authorities have decided to stop all public investigation of this incident, Mr Brook's home was acquired by the government and is most likely going to remain abandoned just like the building next to it. The drainage system of the town is to face a mass survey in order to clear any possible abnormalities.*
