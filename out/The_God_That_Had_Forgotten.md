It started with a whisper, carried on the cold autumn wind that howled through the trees. No one could say when it began, exactly. Some claimed it was older than memory itself. Others said it had been born the night the stars flickered out for an hour, decades ago. But those who heard the whisper never spoke of it for long. They either disappeared or went mad, their minds shattered by something they couldn’t explain.

I was never one for old stories, but when I found the journal tucked away in my grandfather’s attic, something about the worn pages made my hands shake. It smelled like mold and damp earth, and the ink was smeared in places as if tears or rain had fallen on it. The title scrawled on the first page was almost unreadable: The God That Had Forgotten.

The entries were bizarre, dated from nearly fifty years ago, long before I was born. They spoke of strange dreams, landscapes twisted and wrong, where the sky was always dark, and shadows moved without light. There were pages filled with sketches of a figure—human, almost, but not quite. Its face was blurred, like it was being erased as he drew it. But the most chilling part was the description that followed: A god that had forgotten itself, but still lingered, wandering through the corners of reality like a broken thought.

My grandfather’s handwriting grew more erratic as the entries went on, his words frantic and desperate. He wrote of hearing voices at night, whispers from the dark corners of his room, telling him things no human should know. “It remembers now,” one line read, “and it’s looking for those who heard its name.”

By the final entry, the words were almost illegible: It found me. It remembers everything.

I shut the journal and tried to forget about it. I didn’t tell anyone, not even my friends. But the dreams started almost immediately after that. At first, they were just flickers—images of that dark, twisted landscape. But soon, they became longer, more vivid. I was walking through endless forests, where the trees seemed to bend and twist in ways that hurt my mind to look at. In the distance, I always saw that same figure, standing just on the edge of my vision, watching.

Then the whispers began.

I would wake up in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat, hearing faint voices, calling my name. At first, I thought it was my imagination. But the more I ignored them, the louder they became, until they seemed to echo in every corner of my house. And always, the same words: It remembers. It’s coming.

I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t think. Every night, I felt it closer. Sometimes I would catch glimpses of it in the mirror, just a blur of a figure behind me before I turned around and it was gone. Other times, I would wake up to find things in my room had been moved—small things, like the lamp or a book. But the worst was the feeling that something was watching me, something that had forgotten what it once was, but now knew it wanted me.

I searched through the journal again, desperate for answers, but it gave none. There were only vague warnings, cryptic notes about rituals and ancient names. Nothing concrete. Nothing that could help me.

And then, two nights ago, I heard it in the house.

It started as a faint creaking, like footsteps just outside my door. I froze, listening as the sound grew closer, each step deliberate, dragging. My heart pounded so loud I thought it might burst. And then the whisper came again, from the other side of the door, clear as day: I remember you.

I didn’t sleep after that. I couldn’t. I don’t know how much longer I have before it comes for me, before it takes me like it took my grandfather.

But there’s something I’ve realized—something terrifying. The god that had forgotten? It wasn’t just some entity drifting through dreams. It was once worshipped, long ago, when the world was younger and humanity still feared the dark. People gave it offerings, prayed to it for mercy. But eventually, they stopped. Its temples crumbled, its name faded.

It was forgotten.

But gods don’t die. Not truly. They linger, waiting, desperate to be remembered. And now that it remembers itself… it’s looking for those who forgot.

If you’ve read this far, it’s already too late. The whispers will come soon, and you’ll hear it call your name. It remembers you now.

Just like it remembers me.
