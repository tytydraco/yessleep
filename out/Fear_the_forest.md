I spent about eight years in prison doing hard time; paying for the mistakes made in my youth. Everyday I dealt with screaming guards and bloody fights between cell mates. Everyday was like living in my own personal hell. The only thing that kept me sane was what I had planned when I got out. You see, my dad owned about twenty acres of forest in Montana. When I was a kid, I found myself enthralled by mother nature's beauty. Living more in the wilderness than I did in my own home. The thought of all the gorgeous scenery and untainted air. Looking forward to that slice of paradise was the only thing keeping me sane.

When it finally came time for my release, the vast wilderness was my destination. After stepping off the bus and catching up with my family. I packed a bag, filling it with supplies and even a tent. After waiting this long, I planned to stay a few days. During the start of my trek, it was more awesome than I could've imagined. The air was so clean and pure, a far cry from the stench of blood and cold steel. The pine cones crushed beneath my feet, giving me a satisfying feeling. Different birds broke the silence with happy chirping. This was what I prayed for during those eight agonizing years.

As I continued onward, the sun started to set. Giving off a stunning orange glow that brought a smile to my face. I swear, people focus too much on the everyday hustle and bustle of life. I felt like I could stay out here and live happily. But since it was getting late, I needed to find a spot to set up camp. I wasn't picky, dirt would be better than one of those prison cots. I settled under the cover of some really tall pine trees. I had planned to build a fire and roast some marshmallows. But to do that, I needed some stray branches. That's when my trip took a strange turn.

As I walked deeper, little things seemed off to me. Like the many broken trees, not small ones either. There were thick and mighty oaks snapped clean in half. Upon further inspection, they didn't seem to be rotten. This left me dumbfounded, as I didn't remember any tornadoes in the forecast. Regardless, I pushed on in search of more wood. However this time, an awful smell caught my attention. The whole area seemed to reek of body odor or that of a decaying animal. But I assumed this sort of smell was normal in the middle of the wilderness.

Eventually I came across a small cave; it looked so peaceful and serene. Like I could throw out my tent and sleep there. But that putrid sewage like stench would fill the air even worse than before. Like someone had been dumping their trash in this cave for years. As I inched closer trying not to vomit; I saw something moving around inside. It looked like a small child, albeit covered in brown matted hair. As anyone else would have, I tried getting closer. To quell my curiosity and see what in the world this creature could be. But as I did, footsteps rivaling that of thunder started approaching me.

I tried to figure out what was going on, but before I could. Something struck my head hard, instantly sending me to the ground. My vision became hazy, and I felt something wet coming from my forehead. I rubbed my fingers into the liquid, quickly realizing it was my own blood. I glanced down to see a large rock; obviously what caused the damage. I'd try to stand up and gather my bearings. Unfortunately, this would be a moment that stuck with me for the rest of my life. Towering above me was a horrifying creature straight out of a monster movie.

It had to be around nine feet tall, covered in moss like brown hair. The creature's stench alone was enough to bring a man to his knees. Now I've never considered myself a coward. Especially considering I fought for my meals eight years straight. But standing before this colossal ape-like creature; left me with only one optionâ€¦run. I sprinted in retreat as fast as I could, knowing my life depended on it. To my terror, I could hear the creatures booming footsteps chasing behind me. I don't know what it was trying to protect, but it would've killed me before I found out.

As I ran and ran, the behemoth had no trouble keeping pace with me. It was to the point that I was sure its long arms could have reached out and grabbed me. Not only that, but the grunting noise he made with every step was terrifying. It sounded inhuman, downright demonic if I was being honest. My lungs felt like they were about to burst; but stopping for a breath was not an option. There was no way I was going from locked away to being killed by this thing. Even when the blood had nearly stolen my vision, I kept going.

Thankfully, the end of this massive forest came into view. And seeing as I was out of his domain, I no longer heard the creature. Leaving all my supplies behind, I raced back to my fathers house. I explained to him what happened; but he shook his head. Going as far to accuse me of being on drugs. That i must have taken a bad hit and started hallucinating.

Even the large gash in my head had to be self-inflicted. I was so angry, but I guess it was understandable. After all, who would believe that I saw such a monster. I've never been a fan of the paranormal, but after researching. I came to the conclusion that what I saw was the legendary bigfoot. A being that until now, I would've told you was completely fabricated. It was so unreal, I wish it were drug induced.

Fortunately I never saw that terrifying beast again. And it was safe to say that I lost any and all interest in the great outdoors. Now with a job and living the straight and narrow. I've put all that behind me; but I will never forget my encounter with the terrifying sasquatch.
