I always loved playing Sonic the Hedgehog when I was growing up. The fast-paced gameplay, colorful worlds, and catchy music always kept me entertained for hours on end. But as I got older, I stopped playing the games. I remember going for hours at a time but not anymore.

I decided to go play the old games. I was scrolling through some random website only to see a link for a Sonic the Hedgehog ROM Hack. I downloaded the game and the file's name was God Of Speed.EXE. Even though it was strange, I opened the file only for it to continue to crash. The game would only run if I have an official copy of Sonic CD. Luckily I had an old disk in my basement with the game. I inserted the game into my computer and I started to play!

I was pumped to be playing this game until it started.The game showed the SEGA logo and after that it showed the Sonic 1 screen? Why? This is Sonic CD! 

Anyways the went to Green Hill Zone but something was off.

It all started when I was playing through Green Hill Zone for the millionth time. I was breezing through the level, collecting rings and defeating enemies with ease. But as I reached the end of the level and prepared to face off against Dr. Robotnik, there was nothing, nothing but Sonic until I looked behind him.

Levitating behind him was a figure that looked like Sonic, but something was off about him. His eyes were glowing a sinister red, and his smile was twisted into a sinister grin. I shook my head, convinced that it was just a glitch. He resembled Cyborg Sonic. A glitch from SONIC 3.

But as I continued to play, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me. Every time I looked away from the screen, I could swear I saw that twisted version of Sonic lurking in the shadows.

I tried to convince myself that it was all in my head, that I was just imagining things. But the more I played, the more the feeling of dread crept up on me. As I was playing through Angel Island, the figure that looked like Sonic held what appeared to be the Phantom Ruby from Sonic Mania.

"HELLO, PLAYER," it whispered, its voice sending shivers down my spine. I tried to ignore it and keep playing, but the figure's voice grew louder and more insistent.

I saw in terror as the twisted version of Sonic stood before me, its freakish grin spreading wider across its face.I was back to the title screen when I saw him. The ring rusting away, the ocean flooded with blood and "SONIC" staring back at me while unsettling music played in the background.

The game then led me to the save screen. It showed Tails, Knuckles and Eggman all waiting to be played.

First, I played as Tails, I traversed a level called "HILL ZONE" which was a dark HELL-Like level that was mostly empty. I went to act 2 only to see "SONIC" with his eyes closed. Tails by his own starter to walk closer to "Sonic" until "Sonic" transformed into the Cyborg Sonic (That's what I will call him for now.) And started to count down from 10

He whispered:

10

9

8

7

6

5

4

3

2

1

He then laughed in an unsettling way.

I entered a burning Angel Island zone only to see 2 options:

"RUN AWAY" or "GO BACK"

I clicked Run Away only to see Tails being chased and killed. I saw his corpse fall flat on the floor covered in blood. The game than crashed afterwards. I opened the game again.

I went back to the Save screen only to see Tails now dead on his monitor. The sight of which freaked me out.

I then spawned into the game. As Knuckles. I flew into Scrap Brain Zone only to see the poor fox's corpse. Knuckles fell onto the stage with "SONIC" behind him. The choices appeared, "FIGHT" or "RUN AWAY". I chose to fight.

Playing as Knuckles, I punched "SONIC" only for him to disappear before my eyes. He Came at me from behind and Killed Knuckles. He then turned him into some sort of zombie servant.

I went back to the save screen. Only to spawn onto Death Egg Zone as Eggman. I moved forward only to see "SONIC" appear in front of him. 3 options appeared, "ATTACK", "SUMMON BADNIK" and "RUN AWAY". I chose to Run Away only to see zombie versions of Knuckles and Tails chase me down. " SONIC" then teleported above Eggman, turning him into another zombie servant.

The game then crashed again.

I opened the game again only to see a nightmarish version of "SONIC" with 4 eyes. 1 main eye, 2 eyes in the ears. And 1 on his chest. He then whispered the words, "I AM YOUR GOD NOW."

After that my computer blue screened itself and the screen cracked while the "SONIC" from the title screen appeared.

2 days afterwards, I found out the game was a troll game made for Halloween. If anyone is reading this, do not play the game! It will destroy your computer just like it destroyed mines. Anyways see yeah.
