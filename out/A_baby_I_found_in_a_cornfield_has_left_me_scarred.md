One day, I was heading home, walking between the main road and the cornfield when suddenly, a baby's wail broke out. 


At first, I jumped and looked around. I found myself to be alone. But this cry, a baby's cry, seemed to have come from the cornfield. I had no phone with me, and there was no house nearby. The autumn chilled my skin and still, the baby's cry continued on. 


I wrestled with my consciousness. It could have been an animal making a sound, or it could be *human*. And it sounded like it needed help. After several minutes, I finally made my choice. 


I never knew how big the cornfield was. It just seemed endless with yellowed towering cornstalks all around. I followed the baby's cry as much as I could until I heard a snap.


"Hello?" I paused. "Is someone there?"


Another snap and I began to back away.


The snapping intensified and I tripped. 


"Please don't–" I shielded myself. A raccoon scrambled out and I screamed. After that awkward moment, the baby's cry reminded me of my mission.


Before long, I came across a small pile of dried cornstalks and corn husks. From within that pile must be the baby because its crying was loudest there. So I didn't waste time clearing that pile. Cuts were what I got from doing that, but I didn't care. As long as the baby's safe...


Imagine my surprise to find an actual baby's bundle, wrapped securely against the cold, trembling slightly, wailing vigorously. My heart melted as I cradled the child. Its face was covered and I felt the fall weather biting my bare skin. As long as the baby's safe, my needs were secondary.


"There, there," I said gently to the baby. "You're safe now." 


The baby cooed and I wondered how could anyone abandon this child? Poor child. Abandoned. Out here all alone.


As I slowly rose on my feet, I realized something.


Have you ever been to the local corn maze? 


I had no idea how I was getting out of that place with the baby, and I was sure as heck, not going to freeze to death out there, either. So I trod on, hoping to find the way back or someone to guide us out. 


Time passed. And the baby began to wail again. 


"Hush, baby," I said, rocking my arms slightly. "It'll be okay."


Just as the baby fell silent, something snapped somewhere among the cornstalks. I looked to my left.


"Hello?"


Another snap. I remember feeling my heart beating against my chest and gripping the bundle tightly for safety. All that time was me and the baby. No one else. 


"Hello?" I said, trying to sound braver. "I--found a baby. It's been abandoned. It needs help."


But a third snap happened, followed by a dozen or so more. It grew in intensity and it took me seconds for me to realize we're not alone. Something dangerous was lurking around and I didn't waste time to find out. So I ran with all my might, with the baby in tow.


The baby's cry echoed throughout the field and the wind bit my face and hands. Tears fell from my eyes. My chest was heavy. I didn't know how far I ran, let alone how what direction I took. As long as nothing bad happened...


A few yards later, I had to catch my breath and glanced at the baby whose wail was deafening. 


"It's okay," I said. "You have me." 


The louder the baby cried, the louder snaps behind us became. The more it happened, I became more convinced it was more than one thing chasing us. They're coming.


So I forced myself to keep going. It must've been several yards until I finally spotted someone. I waved at the man for help. I was sure he's the farmer, the owner of the cornfield.


When he turned around, my stomach dropped. Hope faded.


The man had a saggy, bloodsoaked face, with buttons for eyes. His faded denim overalls were similarly stained and he dropped his pitchfork. He looked strangely misshaped. He approached us with a limp. 


I screamed as I saw walking cornstalks with humanoid faces surrounding us shortly after and I finally tripped. The baby cried louder. And I huddled with it for dear life, only to realize that it had a pale yellow humanoid face with black eyes, with a single green sprout for hair. I was lost for words, and my throat hurt from screaming. 


When the strange man came, I offered the baby in exchange for my life. 


"Take the baby!" I said without a second thought. "Take it!"


When that was done, I rolled over and crawled to get away as fast as possible. All I could remember were endless humanoid faces staring at me as I ran. I didn't look back. I dared not.


Night had fallen just as I came home. And when I checked my shoes, I noticed a patch of dirty straw on the soles. They even smelled of corn. I went to bed, trying to convince myself that it's only a nightmare, that none of it ever happened.


By the next morning, I found a big mess of straw all over my porch along with a torn piece of [bloodstained denim.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTalesofEC299?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
