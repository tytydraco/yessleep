I need to write this down because I have begun to question my sanity.

I cannot really say how long I've been stuck on these mountains. My friends tell me that it has been a week, but I know it's been more than that. I'm not sure how much I can trust them either. They've been altered in some way. They aren't how they were when we first left.

I have gaps in my memory. My friends have tried to explain what went on within the gaps, but they keep telling me things I already know.

&#x200B;

But perhaps I should start from the beginning.

&#x200B;

There were four of us: Jake, Sarah, Marcus, and myself. It was a stupid impulsive plan. Marcus's grandfather had a cabin on the Rocky Mountain range, somewhere in Colorado. I wasn't entirely sure where in Colorado, but I trusted Marcus and he seemed to know where we were going. So, on the first of October, we took to the roads, exchanging drivers every few hours. From Connecticut to Colorado, we made the journey over several days. Finally, on October 5th, we reached the foothills of the mountains.

"We need more supplies." Marcus started.

"I'll come with you!" Jake said, a bit too excited, and the pair left. Sarah and I shared a knowing look: Jake had been pining over Marcus for a few months now, and Marcus had been in love with him for a year. The two were waltzing around each other, waiting for someone to make a move while Sarah and I were left watching this sad dance.

Sarah and I were never particularly close; I always got the feeling that she never let down her walls with me in the same way that she did with the others. At first, I always chalked that up to my overthinking. However, after an incident, I realized that maybe one of my closest friends doesn't see me as a close friend. It used to put a damper on me, but I had come to accept that our friendship would never be what I had wanted it to be.

"Have you ever been hiking?" Sarah asked, leaning back in the passenger seat. I took a piece of the chocolate raspberries that she packed. She was a health nut.

"Well, not like this. I've been on hikes closer to home, and those were more trails than hikes. Also, we never went during the winter months." She nodded, falling back into silence. I could only remember all the times I would try to fill the silence but found it to no avail.

I looked out the front window and fell into old patterns of thinking. I didn't even realize that I had started to pick at my nails when Sarah manually intervened. I sighed softly and pulled away.

&#x200B;

Jake came in before Marcus did. He was carrying two bags of canned and packed food, that he began to unpack into one of the empty backpacks we brought. "Marcus is coming in with the rest and then we can start again." I nodded and started up the car again. Marcus came bustling into the back seat, carrying some more basic necessities: flashlights, some lighters, and a shotgun. "You had your license on you?" I asked.

"Funny story, I told the shop owner where we were planning on going and he gave me this."

"He gave you a loaded shotgun?"

"Yes, now let's go before it gets dark. It's already 2!" I stopped the car and looked at him for a second. Perhaps I was a coward, but a man gave him a shotgun after telling him where we were going. I had a right to be suspicious.

"Marcus, did the shopowner tell you anything else?"

"Nah, man just turned around and left." Sarah and Jake were looked back and forth between us. Did they not see the obvious signs?

"Have you been to this cabin recently? I mean, is it safe?" I questioned, as Marcus was stuffing the things into his backpack.

"Aren't these questions you should have asked before we decided to come?" Sarah asked and I tried to not let it annoy me.

"That was before the shop owner decided that it was appropriate to give us a gun because we were going there. Come on, there can't be any more obvious signs that maybe we shouldn't be going here!"

"Shreya has a point," Jake spoke out. "He did seem pretty spooked. Why don't we just go back and ask him why?"

"We could do that, or we could go up. We are losing daylight!" Marcus complained. I sighed loudly.

"Asking him won't take that much time! Maybe we missed something that he knows about."

"Are you scared, Shreya? I know you don't like mountains that much, but you can't let your paranoia get to the rest of us!" My mouth snapped shut, and my brows furrowed. Of course Marcus the idiot would blab something I told him in confidence.

"Wait, what do you-" Sarh began, but I couldn't handle her asking any questions.

"Fuck it, let's just go."

White nonsense, I bit back from saying.

I started the car, but not without saying that if I came out of that cabin with so much as a scratch, I would make sure he bought me food for the rest of his life. I pulled out of the small convenience store parking lot and drove up.

&#x200B;

It didn't take us long to get there. We had reached around five, but I hadn't accounted for the sun setting so fast. The sun was already sunk halfway across the horizon by the time I parked on the driveway. Having seen it in real life, it was far less creepy than the image I had been painting in my head. Jake was the first to get out, retching until he vomited in a nearby bush. His motion sickness and those hairpin bends did not make for a good combination. Marcus, Sarah, and I unpacked the bags in the meantime.

The cabin was made of some old wood. It was darkening from rotting and damp from the rain, and last year's snow. Despite the smell and rot, it wasn't that creepy of a sight. Perhaps I was overreacting, but there was still a sense of unease and tension. The tension in question was between Marcus and me. The car ride was nothing but unpleasant, with Jake trying to lighten the mood and failing at every hairpin bend until eventually had no choice but to rest his head on Marcus' shoulder and be quiet. Sarah remained silent for the most part, but from the corner of my eye, I could see her glance my way now and then.

&#x200B;

Marcus fumbled with the keys, the cold numbing his fingers. He finally managed to insert the right key into the hole and twist it open. There was a resounding sound from the cabin, a creaking that seemed to echo within the entire house.

Yeah, this was starting to get too creepy for my taste.

The inside wasn't particularly creepy either. It was rather normal to be honest. It wan entirely made of the same type of wood, a rosewood if I had to guess. Despite the fact that it was externally rotten, the inside was perfectly intact. There was furniture: a sofa, a coffee table, a dining table, and a kitchen. However, the most interesting thing was the paintings. There were about three that I could see from the entrance. They all seemed to be painted by the same painter because they looked like paintings in a series. They were very intricate paintings, all of them having many components to them. As we stepped inside, I was able to get closer to one of them. There was one hung over the sofa. It was rather difficult to tell the subject of the painting. This one was of many people, hundreds, running from something. Some of them were pointing, and some of them had looks of terror on their faces, but they were all running.

Except for one person. There was a singular person in the right corner who was just standing and staring blankly at the audience. It was pointing to the left corner, where I saw a tendril of a black blob.

What an odd choice for a painting.

The others were equally similar. Each had the same setup, a group of people running, a single person pointing at a black blob. In each picture, the blob was getting bigger and bigger.

I wondered if there was a single picture having just the blob. It would make sense given the series.

&#x200B;

"Marcus, was your grandfather a painter?" I asked, still observing the painting.

"Yeah, he used to paint in his spare time."

"What's this one supposed to be though?"

"Gramps was kind of weird, okay? I'm not really sure what he painted half the time. It could just be another weird one." I nodded, turning away and helping the others unpack.

&#x200B;

There were only two rooms in the cabin. Sarah and I shared one, while the other was shared by the men. The rooms upstairs were monastic: a single cot with a cleaned mattress on top, and no furniture, save a single night table and a painting. It continued the same theme as before, this time the blob making up most of the painting.

"Sarah, did you notice the weird paintings?"

"What?" She glanced up from her gaze. She was glaring at the bed, which was quite small. I frowned slightly.

"The paintings, Sarah. Did you see them?"

"No, I don't know why I would. This entire place gives me the creeps," My frown grew deeper. "I don't know why we came."

"I asked that in the car. You seemed fine with coming here. Why are you backing out now?" She sighed, sitting down on the bed. "I don't understand why you didn't say anything then."

"Look, I'm sorry. I was fine with it then. It's just that when we reached here, this entire place felt... off. I don't want to be here, and I don't think we should spend the night here."

I understood what she meant. Everything was off here. The choice of decor, to the pristine condition of the house. There wasn't even a speck of dust despite it being locked up for a year since Marcus' grandfather's death.

I sighed loudly. Sarah looked me in the eyes for what seemed like the first time in a really long time.

"Why don't we ask Marcus and Jake if we can head back? I'm sure we can convince them." She nodded solemnly.

We made our way down the stairs and to my left, I saw a painting that I missed the first time I went up them. That in and of itself was odd, because how do you miss a canvas hanging off the wall? I couldn't have missed that. But I did.

It was the painting I assumed was part of it: a canvas painted fully black, save for a little speck in the corner. The little person pointing was now just blankly staring at the audience. It was so detailed, and I could make out its features. Black hair, tan skin, dark eyes, and a little sliver of a scar on the eyebrow.

I stilled for a moment. My blood went cold, and I could feel my heart stop, and then start once again. My heart pounded against my ribcage with such an intensity that I was in pain. Goosebumps erupted on my skin and I felt myself ache all over. I gasped suddenly and sharply for air.

It was just a fucking painting.

No, this place was weird, I decided for the final time. It didn't matter how much Marcus wanted to stay here. I was going to leave his ass right there if he didn't get into the car.

"Are you alright?" Sarah reached out, holding me steady. I had forgotten she was there for a second. I held her hand, trying to calm myself a bit, so that I don't straight up lash out at Marcus and Jake.

"Dude, that person in the painting looks just like me."

"What painting? There is nothing there." My head cranked to the left and there and behold, there was no painting. I couldn't have imagined it. There was a painting right there.

"Don't fuck with me, Shreya. I'm already super freaked out."

"I'm not fucking with you. There was a painting right there. It was... What did you think I was looking at?"

"You were just staring at the wall."

My mouth went dry. Fuck all this shit, I thought. I am not staying here for a single second.

"Marcus, Jake, let's go!" I bellowed, reaching the bottom of the stairs. The two men were just staring outside. Marcus was staring in awe, while Jake, more pragmatically, looked concerned.

"What's going on?" I asked, hints of apprehension creeping in.

"It's snowing."

"What the fuck? It's October!" Sarah exclaimed, pushed herself to the window, and saw. A thin layer of snow peppered the entire background.

"Hell no, pack your shit. We are not staying here." I shouted, getting our bags and stuff and cramming our food and supplies back in.

"What the fuck? Stop that, Shreya, we can't go anywhere. We already checked," Jake came to my side and stopped me. "The ignition isn't starting. We can't go anywhere. Plus, it's already dark and this place has a population of mountain lions. We can't leave right now. We can try again in the morning." Jake's voice held a tremble, and I tried to ignore it. It only aggravated the deep rolling anxiety that was building up. I could feel the jitter in my bones.

"We can't stay here, Jake. This place is weird. I would rather be eaten by a mountain lion than stay here." I whispered. I was no hero, I knew this within myself. I was a fucking coward, and this place was only making it worse. Every creak in the wood made me snarl, ridden with paranoia.

"Okay, why don't we check the car again?"

I nodded furiously and he pulled me towards the door. Marcus silently handed me the keys and I slipped into the front seat.

The ignition wouldn't start. This car was perfectly fine an hour ago.

My breathing was becoming more shallow.

This car was fine a little while ago.

I leaped out of the car and opened the front. Maybe something had frozen. Maybe the gasoline had frozen.

"Do any of you know anything about cars?"

Sarah came to my side and began looking at the front. She went to the back. She took the flashlight and inspected every part.

"The car is fine. It should run. Let me try."

For ten minutes, each of us came in and out of the driver's seat, trying to start the car. Every failed attempt only made my breathing worse.

I am a grown woman, I shouldn't be this scared, I thought to myself the entire time.

&#x200B;

"We need to stay in the cabin tonight," Marcus said, his tone low and steady. I could tell he was trying to calm me down, but no amount of soothing was going to bring me any comfort. "We need to go inside."

I wasn't going insane. I was mentally clear. I saw that painting. I saw all of them. I wasn't going mad. The cabin light seemed harsh and yellow, as if mocking me, mocking everything I saw.

But there was nothing I could do. Not now, anyway. I let Marcus take me inside and sit me down on the couch. He handed me a bottle of water, which I downed in seconds. I was still frazzled, but far clearer.

"Sarah and I want to leave."

"We want to too, but right now there is nothing we can do. We have no way out and it's snowing. They won't send anyone up here." Marcus sat down beside me.

I thought to myself, while Jake pulled out dinner: canned refried beans, corn, and several bags of tortilla chips. It was quiet, except for the sound of chips and chewing.

"Do you still have that shotgun?" Marcus nodded, pointing to it on the coffee table. "It's loaded?"

"Yes, so if there is anything weird, I got you." He had incredible charisma, I had to admit. It was part of his charm, why everyone grew so close to him. He had a way of making you believe that he was there until the end and that everything was alright.

Of course, that was until I realized that that was a desperate defense mechanism that he used to hide the fact that he didn't really know what he was doing either.

However, I bit my tongue and relished the warm feeling that the words brought. It kept everything else at bay, for now. But the cabin seemed to breathe, expanding and contracting. I know they wouldn't believe me.

We didn't go back up to the rooms. Instead, we split up: the living room was where Sarah and I slept and the kitchen was where Jake and Marcus slept.

I sat on the couch, the nerves still biting, but not with the same force as before. I was picking at my nails, something I did often when I was nervous. Sarah ran her hand across mine and held it. "Stop that."

I scoffed and turned away. "Nothing about this is fine, Sarah. Being here feels wrong."

She nodded. "I know. We can leave in the morning. It's going to be fine. We don't have to sleep. We can just talk."

I wasn't going to get any sleep anyway. I glanced over into the kitchen. Marcus and Jake seemed to have gone to sleep right away. The lights were off and I could see their feet poking out from the covers they placed down.

I leaned back into the chair and looked at her. "Okay, fine."

"Good."

"Why aren't you comfortable with me?" I blurted out before I could contain it. I didn't even realize that that was something I wanted to ask. It wasn't even on my mind that much.

"Wh-what? I am comfortable with you."

"No, you are always nervous, and you talk more with those two. That's fine, but I just want to know why. We've been friends for a long time and I don't like that you haven't been as close with me as you are with them." I could feel the deep resentful emotions that I had kept bottled inside suddenly rushing out.

"Look, it's not what you think it is. I am close friends with you, Shreya. It's not that I'm not. It's just... I can't... I don't know what to tell you." She sighed, her head in her hands. When she looked up again, I could tell her face was flushed. It was always hard to tell with her deeper complexion, but I had known her for too long to not notice.

"I don't understand."

"I don't want to fuck up what we already have. I am really sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel like this like I didn't like you enough. I didn't mean to hurt you."

"But you did, and I just want to know why."

"I am close to them, but a lot of the time, I'm talking to them... about you," My eyes widened a bit and I started to get an inkling of where this conversation was heading.  "Not bad things, of course. We weren't gossiping."

"Do you like me? Like in a romantic way?" Her eyes shot open fully, and she was so visibly embarrassed that it was cute. She didn't even need to say anything. I giggled a bit and she hid her face in her curly hair.

"I'm sorry, I really didn't want to tell you like this."

"Were you ever planning on telling me?"

"Honestly, no. But I guess, now there isn't a choice, right?" I looked up.

I spend a lot of time in my head, I thought. I could have just asked and cleared it up sooner.

"When we get out of here, let's go on a date," I said, sliding my hand on hers. She looked surprised and then grinned really widely. I couldn't help but mirror it as well. She grasped my hand really hard, and I leaned on her shoulder.

&#x200B;

Maybe this was a good thing, coming to the cabin.

&#x200B;

I don't know when but I had fallen asleep. I could have been during the conversations I had with Sarah, but I honestly can't remember. But I do remember getting startled awake. There was a loud groaning. At first, it sounded like the groans accompanied by sexual pleasure. I jolted away, pissed off and ready to tell someone off for waking me up.

However, when I rubbed my eyes and sat up, a bit more clearly, it was very clear that they were not groans of passion. There were deep low groans, accompanied by the sound of crunching. It was a disgusting metallic sound, and it was rhythmic: a groan then a crunch.

Bile rose in my stomach as an odor wafted into the room. It was unlike any smell I have ever smelled. It smelled like carrion and shit, and industrial waste products. It wafted from the kitchen in waves, and even after covering my nose, I could feel the heat of it on my face. My eyes burned and I could feel the return of the dinner.

When my stomach was no longer strong enough, I turned and vomited, tears pouring down my face and I spilled my guts onto the wooden floor. My eyes pried open: the floor was no longer a pristine rosewood but a rotting termite-infested mess. I could see the worms turn in the wet and soggy wood. It looked like it was seconds from decomposing. My heart lurched and I turned to wake Sarah when I realized that Sarah was no longer there. In her place was a mound of swarming worms. They writhed and swallowed. I could hear them moving against each other.

My heart pounded, and it almost drowned out the slippery sounds, and the deep groaning.

There was a small gap that they didn't touch. I could see it from where I sat. In the darkness, I almost didn't see it, but I recognized the features: eyes, nose, mouth. They were being eaten away.

I wanted to scream, but there was nothing.

That was the same person I had been kissing just a few hours ago.

It was as if I was bound with some invisible rope. I couldn't control my body, and I couldn't even move. I just sat there, watching worms eat away at her.

The groaning suddenly crescendoed in volume. The sudden sound jolted me into action. I grabbed Sarah, or what was left of her. I reached into the worms, but I only felt pain in my arms. I could feel the tearing of my flesh as I bit down my tongue from screaming.

I tried to touch anything that was left of her, something to anchor my hands onto so that I could pull, but I only sunk my hands deeper and deeper until I touched the floor.

Biting my cheek, my eyes pouring out with tears, I pulled my hands out only to find them covered in red and black clots. It was as if her body had completely liquified. Tears were cold on my face.

There were a few worms attached to my skin, which I pulled out, taking pieces of my flesh with them. Shallow breathing was starting to hurt my chest.

The groaning stopped and my breathing seemed to echo across the cabin. My eyes widened.

I need to get out of here. 

I need to check for Jake and Marcus first.

&#x200B;

I crouched and crawled my way to the opening of the kitchen door, anticipating a gruesome sight like I had seen before. It was far too quiet. I could hear only the sounds of my blood rushing in my ears with every beat of my heart. 

I peeked into the kitchen, ever so slightly so that I was not seen by anything that may be in the room. 

&#x200B;

It was immaculate. There was nothing out of place, cleaner than it had been before. There was nothing that I could have expected: there was nothing at all. It was the same kitchen, stripped down to its four walls. There was no blood, no guts, or worms. Jake and Marcus weren't there either.

  
There was just nothing.

At this point, I felt like I had lost my mind. I stood, uncaring of how much in danger I was. I just wanted to get out of here as fast as I could. I spun on my heel and ran to the door, leaping over the rotting pile of worms and bounding towards the door.

The moment my hands touched the doorknob, I could feel the world slipping away. It was strange to describe but it felt as if something was being removed from me, and I was overcome with darkness, the feeling stopping as quickly as it came.

&#x200B;

"Shreya!" I felt myself being shaken and I jolted. 

There were three people above me, my friends. They were alive and well. 

"You okay? You were mumbling and started crying in the middle." Marcus asked, handing me some water.

I shut my eyes and breathed out a sigh of relief.

It was just a nightmare.

"I had the weirdest dream," I said, taking the water and downing it immediately. "You guys were there and we were in the cabin. It doesn't matter, it wasn't real-"

&#x200B;

"It wasn't a dream." They said simultaneously, their grins wide enough to show gums, mirroring each other.

The feeling of slipping away overtook me faster this time, and I blacked out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;
