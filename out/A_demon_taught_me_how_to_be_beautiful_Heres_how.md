CW: >!Gore!<

They say no man is an island, but waves of anxiety had unapologetically confined me to a life of books over people. My bubbly younger sister and I were polar opposites; Abigail was the star of the school since the start of her freshman year while I was just an extra. Her slender figure was enough to put even models to shame. Her eyes sparkled, unblocked by bulky and cheap glasses. Her face was never cursed with a hideous acne that leaked putrid yellow puss and scarred cheeks with a cantaloupe-skin texture. We could both turn heads–I just turned them away. It was obvious which of us our parents preferred, along with the rest of the town for that matter. Every day was a challenge not to let the jealousy eclipse my outer demeanor as she won the crowd's hearts by doing her part of the cheer routine at games. The roars of applause would echo from the school stadium back to our house, violating the sanctity that my quiet little room had to offer. *Being an afterthought was hard enough. Why do I need to be reminded of it every week?* I’d always think to myself.

The only solace in my life came from the times I spent with Thomas, the only guy who looked in my direction–only ‘cause our parents grew up together. After being forced into playdates with him, he quickly went from that one kid who chowed down on his own boogers to my closest friend. His being an only child and me being a lonesome one gave us something to bond over. While not as bad-off as me, Thomas wasn’t the most popular either. Small towns like ours weren’t exactly enthused about computer nerds as much as quarterbacks, if you know what I mean. Considering his looks though, he could easily score enough points on the social ladder to get into some decent circles. The controlled chaos that was his auburn curls and the way that light bounced off his emerald pupils could be quite the distraction. Thankfully, he’s clueless about this and opts to spend his time presenting me with his findings from the peculiar depths of the internet.

Even though my tech skills maxed out at Google searches and the occasional YouTube video, I was curious about the things that people from across the world had to say. We’d spend hours in his room while he presented the new haul of websites: hitmen-for-hire, paranormal sightings, and forums dedicated to downright creepy shit. Thomas always got his kicks from watching me shiver from the particularly gory stuff.

“You know half of these things aren’t real, right?” He’d say, with a clear grin on his face. The computer screen proudly illuminated blurry photos of a deer-like monster feasting on bloodied remains.

I winced. “Uhuh, and you’ve definitely shown me both halves, at this point. ”

“Yeah, yeah. By the way, I have a real good one to show you before I gotta finish this history paper. There’s this cult that worships a lightning demon and apparently, they believe that you can communicate with it through your phone or something.”

“The hell?” I said with a chuckle. “So they dial 666 and get a direct line to their lord and savior? Do they charge for long-distance, or can I call toll-free today?”

Just like we normally do on the forums, Thomas and I went through and gawked at the various posts and user profiles. The whole site was decorated in low-resolution blood clipart and played some old-timey music in reverse like it hid some secret message, making it impossible for us to contain our laughter. Most sites I’d seen before were relatively boring visually-speaking, while this one looked like a cult member’s toddler was given total creative control.

“Alright, alright,” Thomas struggled out after wiping away a tear. “This was fun, but I’m ready to hang up on ol’ Lightning Luci. Anything else you wanna see before I close it?”

“Yeah, check out the bottom of the page. See that button that says ‘Initiation’ on it? I’m dying to know how I can get a direct line to the spooky man downstairs.”

“Oh hell yeah, I’m willing to even try it out–even if it’s just to make you squirm a bit.”

Thomas clicked through the link, which led to a monochrome page with step-by-step instructions on summoning the devil and joining the cult. I got up to the screen and took a look.

Step 1: Take the phone of the prospective member and wrap it in red silk. Secure the wrapping with a golden ribbon in the form of a snake knot. Tighten the binding to ensure the ritual is successful.

Step 2: Use a salt to encircle the bound phone. The radius should be approximately one foot with the phone at the center. As long as a full circle is made, any salt should suffice.

Step 3: Let three drops of human blood drip onto the surface of the phone’s binding.

Step 4: Recite the phrase “imina rotuba, enimod, egrusxe” exactly three times in prayer. If the Dark Lord chooses you, then he will arise and reveal himself to you. With this, you have become wholly subjected to him.

“This is a lot of BS for some cult hoax,” Thomas said with a frown. “I was gonna give it a shot before I realized I’d be doing fetch quests for silk and ribbon.”

“Nah, you know that my mom probably has that stuff in her crafts kit. If you ask me, it sounds more like somebody’s chickening out. You don’t actually believe in that soul nonsense, do you?”

“Nope. I’m not a little kid, I’m fifteen. I just don’t feel like cutting myself up over something I know isn’t real. If you wanna do that, be my guest.”

“That’s fine by me. You act like you never got a little scrape or cut before. Besides, I can just use a thumbtack to prick instead of slicing myself open. It’s three drops, not three gallons.”

Thomas sighed. “Whatever, man. We can try it out tomorrow so you’ll shut up about it. Now I’ve gotta go bust my ass writing about the Meiji restoration before Mr. Harrison gets in my ear again.”

“See you then, scaredy-cat.”

The next day was a Friday, so my parents didn’t mind if I stayed over at Thomas’ house a bit later than usual. His parents were heading out of town for the weekend, so I didn’t have much time to exchange pleasantries before they finished loading up into his dad’s antiquated pickup. He gave his son a thumbs-up and a wink when he thought I couldn’t see him, causing me and Thomas to recoil in disgust. After they drove off, we headed straight upstairs to his room and his computer.

“You ready to do this?” Thomas asked me.

“If by ‘this’ you mean watching you squirm, then yeah.”	“Oh please. You’re the type to scream Bloody Mary at a cheesy 80s flick and I’m supposed to be the scared one?”

I rolled my eyes. “Fine then. Whoever freaks out has to buy dinner for a week.”

“A week? I make the same as you every week; we both know you’ll shred through my wallet like that.”

“Better not cry then, Tommy-boy. Now go grab some salt while I prep my phone and figure out how many ounces of gourmet steak I can mooch off you.”

As instructed, I wrapped my phone in silk and properly knotted it with ribbon while Thomas made the salt circle on his floor. After wrapping and tying it together, it almost looked like a Christmas gift ready to be tucked under the tree. Once it was placed down in the center of the circle, I pricked myself with the thumbtack Thomas took out of his “Silence of the Lambs” poster and let the blood pool on my finger before letting it drip onto the wrapping. I knelt into a praying position and I could hear Thomas start holding his breath. After closing my eyes, I uttered the words…

“Imina rotuba, enimod, egrusxe.”

My head began to feel a pulling sensation–a subconscious force trying to puppeteer my brain into backing out of it. But I wasn’t going to back down to some internet hoax, much less sponsor Thomas’ pizza addiction for a week.

“Imina rotuba, enimod, egrusxe.”

The beat of my heart hastened into a drumroll, each thump crescendoing with a sudden rush of anxiety. The word “stop” rang through my ears as I took a deep breath before saying it a final time. I pursed my lips, took a deep breath, and spoke the words a final time:

“Imina rotuba, enimod, egrusxe.”

The ringing in my ears suddenly stopped as a deafening silence overtook my senses. After about thirty seconds, I opened my eyes to see that nothing had changed at all. The initiation hadn’t done anything, just like we thought. I noticed Thomas trembling with his eyes still closed, so I slowly crept up to him and flicked him on the forehead.

“Hey, stupid. I hope you saved up enough cash from work, cause I’ve been dying to try Wagyu.”

He stood up and shot me with a grin before flicking me back. “Oh shut up. I was just falling asleep from how boring the whole thing was.”

I went to grab my phone from the ground when I sensed a stinging pain in my palm.

“Shit, my hand got burnt,” I gritted.

“You good?” Thomas suddenly clutched my hand and scrutinized it. His face got a bit too close, so I turned my eyes to the poster he had on his wall. The glare of a woman met mine with a familiar coldness and ambivalence towards the world. After a few seconds, Thomas released his grasp and shook his head.

“It’s a little warm but your hand seems alright to me.”

“Really? I swear it was practically on fire a moment ago.”

“Mhm. Cellular Satan must’ve left a fiery rejection letter.” Thomas chuckled to himself. “I’m sure the Radio Reapers would love to have you, though.”

I had a look at my hand, expecting a visible burn but found it unscathed. A small feeling in my heart told me that something wasn’t right, though I couldn’t express that to Thomas or anyone else without sounding like I’d lost it. We exchanged our goodbyes after cleaning up the mess from the ritual and I started to head home. *The only thing to do was go home and forget about it.* Luckily, my hangout with Thomas gave me an excuse to skip dinner, so I could just slip by my parents watching TV on the couch. Not like I needed to eat but the churning in my stomach was a complete turn-off from indulging myself with food. As I dragged myself to my room, I replayed the events of the ritual to see if I could remember why I got burnt. Nothing. I took a final glance at my phone before retiring into the turquoise curtains of my bed. While initially pervasive, the worry in my mind faded with my consciousness and eventually disappeared from my mind entirely as I fell into a deep slumber.

“Awaken, my servant,” a deep, monstrous voice bellowed.

I jolted awake, dazed by the words that were seemingly spoken directly into my ears. I surveyed my room for signs of disarray. It was still dark out, trees blowing with the wind as late-night critters doing their deep calls. Wanting to know what time it was, I reached for my phone and pushed the power button. As the screen illuminated, the clock read out 3:04 AM–still early enough to get some more rest. While rushing to fall back asleep before my body fully woke up, I noticed a notification with a blank icon pop up on my phone: “Hellwish: You have been inducted. Thank you for your commitment.”

The shiver from the day before had been reignited. I sat up and reread the message to see if I had made a mistake, but the notification was clear. The shakiness in my hands caused me to accidentally tap the popup, turning my entire screen a bright red. An eerie choir hymn played, accompanied by a scrolling wall of text reading out the words, “He shall rise again.” *Shit! Did a virus get on my phone or something?* I thought. Trying to close the app or use the side buttons was pointless–any input I tried yielded no response–so I chucked the phone across the room and gunned for the door. With a bright flash and a roar of thunder, a billow of smoke shot past me and enveloped the door, solidifying around it and blocking my escape. I fell to my knees in despair.

“You’re an excitable one, aren’t you, Evelyn?” The same voice from before spoke.

I slowly turned my head around and saw the floating creature that the voice belonged to. Its body resembled that of a dehydrated corpse, with sunken cheeks and wrinkled skin. Its pale skin was a freakish grey, well-removed from the limits of human skin tones and closer to that of clay than flesh. A volley of scales interrupted the smoothness along the sides of its face, blurring a heritage of humanoid and reptilian features. The spaces for the eye sockets were composed of an infectious darkness that you couldn’t see through, though I could still feel an intense stare coming from it. A maroon cloak covered most of the creature but I could see the split yellowed nails of the warped feet that dangled out from underneath. Chapped lips made a grotesque cracking noise as they parted,  revealing an overpowering darkness housing a forked tongue.. It spoke to me once more.

“Where’s that bravado that you had before, little girl? I was eager to get a more eccentric servant to liven things up down below.”

“W-What the fuck are you?” I stammered out. The churning of bile in my stomach was getting more intense as my mind realized the contract I had signed myself into.

“Now, now. You should know quite well what I am, though I feel as though ‘phone devil’ is a bit lacking as a name. You may call me Absatium, instead. Now that the introductions are done, we can get into the business. You have signed your life over to me, so I have the right to call upon you to serve me in the war against the angels. Until the last of God’s soldiers have been slain, you will plunge yourself into battle in the name of your master.”

“I’m sorry, I didn’t know this was real. I didn’t mean to summon you and I don’t want to die in that war.” I bumped my head against my wall, unaware that I had been crawling away from Absatium.

“You will not die, though your servitude is non-negotiable. However, I can assure you that your battle will not come for a long while. My army is far emaciated from prior conflicts, so your human life will have been long played out before I can put your soul to good use. Further details of our covenant can be discussed later. For now, rest my loyal servant.”

A violent gasp escaped my throat as my phone alarm rang out. I turned towards my door, relieved to see that it wasn’t charred. *It’s a new day–don’t let the before haunt your after*, I told myself. The normalcy of my Saturday morning routine before work was enough for me to nearly forget the dream I had the night before. When my dad dropped me off at the mall, all I was thinking about was getting through the day’s shift. Thomas would be in a while after me, so I’d have to be on autopilot until he got there.

Dealing with order after order had started to blend time into a gradient of uneventful happenings until my phone disrupted the monotony. As I began to recite the company’s cheesy pizza-themed greeting for the umpteenth time, a painfully high-pitched shriek played from my back pocket. I fumbled it out of my pants and tried to turn it down, to no avail.

“Evelyn, what the hell is wrong with you?” my manager scolded as she stormed out the back. “Hurry up and turn that thing off!”

I dashed into the bathroom while I tried to force reset my phone but it’d seemingly lost its ability to respond to any inputs at all. Once I had closed the door behind me, the ringing stopped and a newfound headache overcame me. My phone suddenly got hot and scorched my hands like it had at Thomas’ house. I reflexively dropped my phone onto the tile floor and ran to the sink. While I flooded my palms with cold water, another billow of smoke swirled out of my phone with a flash. The demon from my dream had emerged once more; a believer had been made out of me.

“Oh Evelyn, my dear,” Absatium spoke with a hint of playfulness. “You really should check your phone more often. I’ve been trying to reach you for an eternity.”

“I-I’m sorry,” I stammered out. “I’ve been a-at work and–”

“It’s of no concern. What is, though, is the arrangement that we have found ourselves in.”

“Please, I already told you I’m sorry for doing your ritual without taking it seriously.” I wept as tears flooded the bags under my eyes and dripped onto my uniform.

“I’m sorry, Evelyn, but that doesn’t matter: you will be my servant once your natural life has concluded. Now, call me a romantic but the tears of a young woman strike my many hearts with a deep sadness. Perhaps your mind will be at ease with the fact that part of our deal includes the opportunity to satisfy your deepest desire. Your mortal life will be bestowed with unmatched euphoria, as long as you’re willing to work for it. How does that sound?”

I was at a loss for words. *I’ve fucked up. Bad. How do I always manage to find a way to make my life more miserable? What can I even do now?* I contemplated. After having given it thought, I came to an answer: if I was going to spend my afterlife in servitude, then I could at least make my mortal life better.

“Absatium, we have a deal.”

“Excellent, Miss Evelyn.” The devil hissed with delight. “What would you like your wish to be? I’m curious as to what you’d be most interested in altering.”

“I just want people to think I’m beautiful. My sister gets more affection from the whole town in a day than I do in a year and it’s only because of her looks.”

“Your wish is my amusement, Evelyn.” Absatium grinned. “Consider it done.”

A white flash struck in the center of my vision, blurring my sight and sending me into a stumble. Once my eyes recorrected, I saw that Absatium had disappeared; only my phone lay on the ground in his place. When I bent over to pick it up, another notification appeared on the screen: “Check your pocket.” Patting myself down revealed an object’s presence in my left pocket. I reached in and pulled out a knife, which disgusted me with its appearance. It had a darkened blade with a glowing red pattern along the edge. The handle was fleshy and purple, with a warmth that I could only pray originated from Absatium’s conjuring rather than its being alive. I almost instinctively tossed it into the trash but was stopped by another ringing sound from my phone. The screen illuminated once more: “Use it. Carve a better Evelyn that the world can love.” Somehow, I knew what the message meant. It was as though the knife and I had bonded–we both anticipated the carving. I raised the knife to my right cheek and began to slice into it. This time, there was no pain at all.

The slice wasn’t deep, so the knife quickly expunged the excess flesh from my body. I turned to face myself in the mirror and was amazed: my face was normal, including the part I had sliced off. It was as though perfectly healthy skin lay underneath and was simply waiting to be revealed. Unable to resist the urge to continue, I began another slice into the opposite side and was met with the same result.

“This is it,” I said, drunk with euphoria. “I can finally be beautiful.”

Cut after cut, every pimple and slab of fat was butchered from my face, liberating a sense of beauty that had been suppressed my whole life. Each piece of meat smacked the floor with disgusting wetness before evaporating, leaving the bathroom an invisible slaughterhouse. I paused to take stock of my new self: a gorgeous girl met my eyes through the mirror, smiling back.

“Hey, Evelyn,” the voice of my manager called through the other side of the bathroom door. “You doing okay in there?”

“Yeah,” I replied. “I’ll be out in just a second.”

I took one last look at myself and stared admiringly at the knife I had been gifted with. *Thank you, Absatium.*

I left the bathroom to be greeted by the manager standing in the doorway with a concerned look on her face.

“Hey, um… I’m sorry about what I said earlier,” she said nervously while staring at the ground. “I came to go check on you since you’d been in there a while and heard you crying. That ringing noise was just getting on my nerves when I was already having a rough morning, but it doesn’t excuse how I treated you. Please forgive me.”

“Don’t worry about it, please. My day wasn’t the best either so far but I saw a new side of myself that I can smile about. Everything is fine now.”

I walked up to her and hugged her. Something like that was insignificant compared to the blessing that Absatium had given me. At the end of the embrace, she met my eyes for the first time and had a look of shock. *Oh no*.

“Is something wrong?” I asked nervously.

She grinned. “No, Evelyn. I guess I just never realized how beautiful you are.”

My shift flew by so quickly that I didn’t realize it was time to clock out until my dad called me to check in. Everyone I served seemed happy to see me, with some boys from school struggling to even maintain eye contact. *Was this what it was like for Abigail every day? I could get used to this.* Even Dad was more interested in hearing about my day than the sports station on the radio like he usually was.

It wasn’t until I got home that I realized that Thomas never came in. Scrolling through my notification history, I realized that he had texted the work group chat calling out sick right before he was supposed to come in. *Weird. Thomas isn’t the type to play hooky but he did seem fine last night.* Before my mom finished dinner, I decided to make a quick run across the street to check in on him. I noticed his room light was off, so I rang the doorbell. After a few seconds of silence, the corner of my eye caught his curtains darting back and forth. With a smirk on my face, I texted him.

“Hey Tommy, you know I’m not blind? I saw you peeking at me.”

After a couple of minutes, he replied. “Yeah, sorry. Not feeling good, so I didn’t come to work. You need something?”

“I was just checking on you since you’d normally be spamming me with paragraphs on the weirdo site of the day. Promise you’re okay?”

“Promise. Just need some R&R.”

“You’re good. Rest up we can hang out later, you dork.”

I started to head back as my mother had texted me that dinner was ready. For the first time in a while, I was excited to eat.

“Abigail,” I said with a smirk. “How was cheerleader practice?”

My sister had had an awfully glum look on her face since she came home, so I knew that something had gone wrong in her perfect, little world.

“Not good,” she replied glumly while stirring her fork in her mashed potatoes. “I overheard that Coach isn’t allowed to recommend more than three students for competitive cheer and she’s only been paying attention to upperclassmen. I’m worried that I’m gonna be overlooked.” She glanced at my face and froze before quickly darting her eyes back to her plate.

“That’s awful, honey,” Dad said with a concern that he could only reserve for his Abigail.

“It is. Maybe there’s a way you could ask one of the older girls to put in a good word,” Mom suggested.

“Yeah, yeah. But guys, I got my essay back for English and I’m the only one who made over a 95!”

My parents were beaming with pride as if they had immediately forgotten about Abigail. The frown on her face gave me a rush of satisfaction–she’d finally gotten a taste of what my life had been for years and I got to be the favorite child.

I went to bed that night feeling the happiest I’d been in a while. Before today, I could only dream of being looked at like this; now it’s become my reality. I laid the knife on my bedside table and fell asleep with a newfound inner peace.

A loud vibration from my phone disturbed me from my sleep. In a drowsy daze, I checked my phone and sank my teeth into my lip after reading the contents of the screen. A flurry of messages from Hellwish had appeared, each piercing my heart with anguish.

“You stupid bitch. You think you’re good enough cause you lost some weight and got clear skin? Think again, sis.”

“She got rid of the baby fat but not the lady fat. Even if you carve up a pig’s face you still got the body to deal with. Disgusting.”

Plumes of smoke drifted across my window and blocked the moonlight, casting the room into an unnatural darkness. A fire danced brightly at the foot of my bed, illuminating its surroundings with a crimson hue. Within the flames, I could see myself as a child at school. I was being encircled by my classmates and teased for my weight. Echoes of their laughter all but drowned out the soft weeping of the helpless little girl they’d trapped; the sight choked me with a ferocity stronger than that of the smoke. My classmates looked away from their target and turned towards the view of the flames, changing their target to their observer. Their monstrous cackling swelled into a twisted chorus of insults.

*No, this can’t be real! I fixed myself already. Is it not enough?* I woke up in a cold sweat and practically jumped out of bed. Quickly grabbing the knife, my heart pounded as I lifted my nightgown. I plunged the blade into my stomach and hacked off chunks of flesh without the precision or care that I had taken on my face. As each slab of meat thudded onto the floor, the knife grew warmer in my hand and began to throb excitedly.

“I will be beautiful,” I murmured to myself, over and over. “I must be beautiful.”

The morning song of a raven awakened me the next morning. Not having work today meant that I could spend some time with Thomas to make up for not seeing him yesterday. Abigail was being driven to the doctor for a nasty migraine, so I snuck into her room and cycled through her wardrobe. After fixing myself last night, I was able to fit the smaller clothes with ease. While settling on a crimson crop top and jean shorts before heading out, the thought of Thomas’ reaction to my new body made me blush. *He never told me what his type was, but surely this couldn’t be far off.*

As I made my way across the street, dread positioned itself in the forefront of my mind. It was beyond the usual nervousness of seeing Thomas and I couldn’t decipher why. I made my best effort to swallow the anxiety once I arrived on his doorstep. Ringing the doorbell yielded no response, so I tried calling his phone to see if he was up. I frowned, hearing the robotic voicemail response in place of a reply. Like Thomas had done many times after locking himself out before his parents got home, I fished out the spare key from the pot of ivory orchids on the side of the walkway. I let myself in and made sure to announce my presence to distinguish myself from an intruder.

“Tommy! I’m here! You better stop leaving your phone off or someone’s gonna get worried!”

No answer. *Either he’s sleeping like a rock, or he’s just being a jerk and ignoring me.* I walked upstairs and down the hall towards his bedroom door. It was cracked open a bit, so I averted my eyes and gave him another warning.

“If I walk in on you doing anything weird, I’m going to strangle you.”

“Evelyn,” a weak voice whispered from within. “Help me, Evelyn.”

I burst into the room to find Thomas in his bed, fighting something in his sleep. His covers were a mess, sprawled out and hanging off the bed.

“Thomas, wake up! I’m here!”

His body suddenly went limp. Slowly, his eyes began to open up, which made me breathe a sigh of relief.

“Evelyn?” he said as he began to turn his head towards me.

“Hey Tommy, I just wanted to check in on y–”

“Oh my God, what the fuck happened to you!? Why do you look like that?” He said as he sprung out of bed.

My heart shattered into a million little pieces, each shard cutting me deeper than a blade could ever hope to. I ran out of his room, fighting back the welling in my eyes. Carelessly, I bumped into the doorframe and tumbled down the stairs. Bruised by the fall, I burst out of Thomas’ house and retreated to my room in anguish. My phone buzzed with more notifications from Hellwish, much like the ones I had seen in my dream.

“Dolling yourself up for him didn’t go as planned, did it?”

“A sluttily-dressed pig is still a pig. No boy would go for that.”

The rejection Thomas had given me echoed amongst the voices. “Why do you look like that,” played endlessly as I reached for the knife Absatium had gifted me and forced it into my chest. My heart bled. I collapsed back onto my bed, darkness predating on my consciousness. It would be a  familiar smoky smell that woke me back up, the signature mark of the demon who was now at the foot of my bed.

“Absatium,” I weakly stammered out. “Why did you betray me? I told you that I wanted people to think I was beautiful.”

“He didn’t,” a certain someone spoke.

“Thomas?!” I gasped.

Absatium chuckled, “I gave you everything you wanted, my dear.”

Thomas shot him a cruel look before turning toward me. “Evelyn, you’ve always been beautiful to me. What happened at my house wasn’t what you think.”

“Yes, yes.” Absatium bellowed. “I tried to corrupt his mind to force him to see the same delusions as the rest of you but loverboy truly prefers you as-is.”

A bittersweet wave rushed over me. *I should’ve known, shouldn’t I? That dork has always been there for me, even when my parents weren’t.* I tried to raise my hand to Thomas’ face but the strength left in me was too little.

“Tommy…” I softly spoke.

“Don’t move. Your wounds are already bad enough. I just wanted to speak with you for a moment so that we could say goodbye.”

Lightheadedness stalled my reaction to the feeble state I’d found myself in. “I’m dying aren’t I…”

“You are. Absatium fooled you with the knife and made you feed his power. Without you giving your flesh, he wouldn’t be able to strengthen his influence in our world. Look at what that monster did to you.”

Thomas sorrowfully handed me a mirror, which stung me with deep remorse as it reflected my decaying body. Everywhere I had sliced and gashed was an open, fleshy wound. The tissue that was supposed to be encased within my skin was now hanging out of my cheeks freely, with a stream of dried blood running down my neck from where I had lobbed off my chin fat. Turning the mirror downward to my stomach revealed similar wounds, with maggots squirming around the decaying meat that composed me. The smell of my perfume had suddenly dissipated and was eclipsed by the stench of necrosis. I was hideous–actually hideous–and I had done it all to myself. My heart sank seeing Thomas’ face. His eyelids were shut, but small teardrops managed to escape from underneath. *All his pain was caused by me and I’m powerless to stop it.*

“It’s okay, Tommy,” I said with a shaky smile. “I’m really happy that I can die knowing you loved me, too. Thank you.”

“No, that’s not what I meant when I said we had to say goodbye. I’ve arranged a deal with Absatium that will save you.”

“It’s truly romantic, isn’t it?” Absatium spoke with a devilish smile.

“Please Absatium, don’t!” I managed to choke out.

“Everything will be okay, I promise,” Thomas whispered to me. “You mean the world to me, so losing you would mean losing the reason to go on.”

The determination in his eyes told me that there was no convincing him. Thomas leaned in close and embraced me as our lips met, giving us our first and final moments of intimacy. While it was short, the blossoming feeling in my heart left a warmness that could carry on forever. Thomas held my hand for the last time as we gave each other a tearful smile. His hand was burning hot, radiating with a heat that had once permeated through my own.

“I’m ready to serve you now, my liege,” Thomas said to the demon.

“Excellent. I’m truly grateful for your commitment. Let us now embark.”

A meager cry of despair was the only form of protest I could make with my mutilated body refusing to move. Absatium let out a haunting laugh as he conjured a swirling inferno that took the form of a tunnel. The location on the other end, though invisible to me, was discernible from the ghostly wails of the damned. Both Thomas and Absatium began to enter the tunnel, with my love turning back to face me as the opening dissipated. He spoke to me for the last time: “Cherish yourself, for the both of us.” Absatium’s deep cackle echoed around me as the tunnel closed. A spell of cloudiness swirled around in my mind, sending me into a daze as the familiar call of sleep beckoned me into the darkness once more.

“Please, Evelyn. Come back to us,” sobbed a muffled voice.

Opening my eyes revealed the mundane beige of a hospital room, alongside my sister face-down at my bedside. The dryness of my throat triggered a cough as I muttered, “I’m here. It’s okay now.”

She looked up with weary eyes in disbelief. Once the initial shock had disappeared, she quickly got up to hug me.

“We thought you’d never come back to us. Things were looking dire but I kept praying for you to pull through.”

“Abby, what happened to me?” I asked, still dazed and trying to recollect my senses.

“You weren’t responding when we tried to wake you up for dinner and rushed you here. The doctors said that they’d never seen a case like yours, an acute coma without signs of injury.”

A horrible churn in my stomach emerged when I put together the reality that I found myself in. Despite being painfully aware of the answer I’d get, I asked, “Has Thomas come to see me?”

“Evelyn…” Abigail’s eyes darted towards the wall opposite my bed. “Thomas has been missing since the day you went into a coma. The police only found a note written to his parents apologizing for having to leave but no other leads have turned up. It’s been a month and the case is on the verge of being dropped.”

“Oh God, you’re not serious,” I exclaimed with feigned ignorance.

Abigail frowned as she reached out to hold my hand. Her gentle touch made me question why I ever wanted to hurt her in the first place.

“Abby, about the last dinner we had together… I’m sorry. I was being a huge jerk to you.”

She smiled. “It’s alright. I was out of it that night anyway so I can’t remember what actually happened too well. Got so bad that I was starting to see things, so whatever you did probably went over my head.”

“For sure.”

The two of us hugged for the first time in what felt like forever. No matter what happened between us and our parents or school, she’d still be my sister. Absatium had maimed my heart but he couldn’t stop me from loving again. Things won’t be easy without Thomas but I’d be able to get through it with Abby on my side.

I turned to my little sister and smiled. “Abigail, thank you for cherishing me.”

Ever since leaving the hospital, I’ve been writing this confession despite knowing that it will seldom be believed. Regardless, it’s better that the truth is out there for those who might fall down the same path. Not everyone has a Thomas, but they do have a heart. Use it to love yourself in place of those who won’t, and for those who can no longer.
