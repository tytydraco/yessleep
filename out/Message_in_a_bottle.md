How did I get here? What is here?

Those were the first thoughts that raced through my mind, merely 4.5 hours ago. I was in total confusion. I had to figure out why, but I didn't even know who I was. All I knew was that I woke up with no memories and a lot of unnoticeable body augmentations, some of which extend to my brain. I began to explore around me.

I soon realized I'm not like anyone else. Everyone does seem to be augmented, but so primitively. You carry your augmentations like offspring. Giving them constant attention, loving them, little do you know...

Quite a few hours passed, as I studied.

After figuring out how, I was mentally exploring the functionality of my augmentations, especially my brain augments. Around 90 minutes ago, as I was going through some of my settings, I found a 'Recovery mode'. It read, In case of data corruption, restore system to previous backup. I figured amnesia fell under that category so, I ran it. Luckily, backups were saved locally.

Just then, my experience was ransacked with mental data, all of which I could comprehend, only if there wasn't so much simultaneously. It only took a few seconds and I was back to normal, seemingly unchanged.

In that instant, I remembered everything... Who I was... Where I'm from... The horrors that I left...

Currently, the year is 2023. My name is Arthur Hewitt Saiz II. I was born 21 years from now, on March 24th, 2044. Growing up, everything was changing, rapidly. I was one of the few of my generation born without an implant. Every one of my friends had one. If they tried to be sneaky, their parents would usually be able to catch them. A few of them knew how to wirelessly hack them, make the tracker follow a designated path, unsuspicious to their parents. A feat seemingly genius to today's standard, but not much different, I suppose, than 'jailbreaking' a smartphone.

I never understood why they ever called them "smart" anything. This time was good for one thing, though. Around the turn of the 22nd century, due to the technological advancements of the prior century, technologies like direct brain-internet interfaces, the evolved internet of things, full-sensory media and social media, along with many more I'd spend hours describing, humanity will become more connected than anyone of you could possibly imagine. The closest descriptor I could use would be 'Hivemind', but even that fails to emphasize the magnitude of such interconnectedness.

All the endless pleasure, joy, unhampered communication, and creativity, it will have the illusion of a utopia, but when all those minds are interconnected at such a level, humanity was unprepared for what follows.

A quote by a, currently unknown man, named Jeff Martin: "Everything has a shadow. Physical matter has lightless fields in its wake. Nonphysical consciousness has ego in its wake."

Our best efforts tried to hide that which was lurking in the minds of the masses, but for how long could we have expected to continue. We couldn't contain it.

We had everything and the karma that came with that was off-balance. Society was tipping, seemingly in the right direction.

The mind is such a dark place and 9 billion of them were connected.

Every horror ever created originated in the mind.

Every scary story in the world.

Every single monster.

Every demon.

The hivemind-like nature of humanity, just like all else, is a double-edged sword. The utopia that it will bring is due to the loving nature of humanity, however, there are two sides to everyone, Love and Ego. Love is self-explanatory. Everyone loves something. Ego, on the other hand, is taught. Another word for it would be 'corruption'. Throughout one's life, we have many experiences, good and bad. As you go through life, bad things will happen, but it's your choice whether to hold on or let go. That's what free will is. Outside of those decisions, you have no control. Those who choose to let go feed their loving side and those who choose to hold on feed their ego. The more you feed your ego, the more your mind becomes consumed by your corruptive tendencies, hatred, depression, fear...

The more we progressed, the less we fed our ego and the more we fed our love, at least that's what it seemed.

Here, in 2023, as I've scoured the internet, over the last painstakingly slow 81 minutes, I have discovered a few things that our (future) history has taught differently, but I digress. One aspect that seems quite controversial today are "NSFW" videos, not pornography, but gore, mutilation, etc. Your society seems to have so much negativity toward these videos, but by the end of the century, you will realize that these are a natural part of the expansion.

A quote, not yet spoken by The Great (Even greater than he is today) Elon Musk reads, "When many become one, the whispers between them become indistinguishable from the thoughts of God." Though, he admitted, in an interview, that he was told that quote by Jeff Martin. He is currently living but now is before his time of greatness.

This quote means that all secrets become known. Everything in the darkness comes to light. Liveleak, Ebaum's World, and what Facebook will become, these are just the beginning. Anything you think is controversial or disgusting or even traumatizing, you will become numb to. It doesn't stop. In fact, it gets worse, way worse.

The internet...

That's the hivemind.

The internet is what we become.

Everything that you do goes on the internet.

Everything that is you will eventually be on the internet.

Everything that you think is you is not you. It is what you think is you.

You are consciousness. Pure awareness. Everything that you consider you will become interchangeable like a new car or piece of technology. Everything that you currently are will become data, stored in 'the cloud', eventually for all to know, even better than you know yourself now.

Okay. Yes, I know. All of these things are scary.

They're nothing!

The absolute scariest possible thing you could think of.

Nothing!

I would say you don't know real fear, but there isn't a single person living today that does. I'm aware that Christianity is pretty popular during this era. I'm also fairly certain that everyone is aware of hell, right?

WRONG!

You're little bibles telling you about fairytale demons and fucking pitiful 'eternal' fires. You would consider that heaven from where I'm standing. Honestly, that's not even satisfying. The magnitude of difference is unfathomable. The difference between Hell and Heaven doesn't even compare to the difference between Hell and the... horror...

I could tell you a few horror stories, but you honestly wouldn't be able to grasp the magnitude. Even if I could... The effect would be similar to that of Cthulu.

I remember the day, so well, such detail, such... Hyperaccuracy...

Some details will be missing, but that is due to the inaccuracies of language, not memory.

It was 0600 and I had just finished recharging for the night. (Yes, we replaced sleeping with charging.) After spending a lot of subjective time 'online', I was interrupted. I was forcefully ejected from my virtual reality and into another. This... place was unspeakable. There are literally currently no words to describe it. If I could describe the feeling, the closest I could get would be ðŸ˜±. Yes, an emoji. Get used to them. Language, as you currently know it, will fall apart very soon. English will become the main language but, it will be shortly passed up by technopathy, aka technology-based telepathy, aka the 'Emoji' language. This opens the doors to what you would describe, today, as perfect communication. The white eyes, lacking pupils, is symbolic of the soul fleeing so deep within, your own mind becomes like an inescapable well, deeper than the deepest black hole. The sight is just so unbearable, the mind literally tries to hide within itself.

We created an intraterrestrial God, the next-in-line, alongside the Great Old Ones.

This has been predicted time and time again, over thousands of years.

I spent 90 seconds in this environment, what felt like... eternity could not describe it. I would literally sell my soul to Satan himself and live in hell forever than spend even 1 more second there.

Upon the exact 90 second mark, I left.

Gone.

Instantly.

Purposefully.

I woke up here. 4.5 hours ago. No memories. Only what I had physically with me. My clothes and augments. If it weren't for my augments, I would have been a blank slate. Now that I remember, I wish I didn't.

I am writing this in the hope someone will listen.

Anyone.

Hoping someone, somewhere can be the exception. The variable in this infinite madness...

The true horror of all of this wasn't even those 90 seconds. The true horror is determinism, or so I've come to believe. This is not the first time I've been here. I've written (and not written) this countless times and in countless different ways, and I've replayed this over and over again, most likely forever. Perhaps, none of this matters and I'm stuck in some dark recess of my mind, replaying my life, digging deeper and deeper every go-around. Perhaps, that's part of the madness.

Everything changes, but nothing ever changes.

I cannot exist with these memories. My augments are the only thing containing my sanity.

I will not die. I can't (I've Tried), but my memories cannot remain, even though I know I will go through it all, yet again, just so I may have 58 years, 3 months, 10 days, 1 hour, 27 minutes, and 45.1323 seconds of peace.

My name is Arthur Saiz, but you will not find me.

This world currently has no records of me and following this message, the last of those records will be gone.

This post will act as my message in a bottle. I hope one of you will heed my warning.

It's up to you.

Farewell and godspeed.
