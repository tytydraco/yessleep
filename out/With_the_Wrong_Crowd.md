 I came out of the bathroom at the game, and everything was wrong. 

I don’t usually tell this story because it’s true and when I think of it, even for a second, the hair on my arms stands up and I get a chill I can’t shake for days after.

But this time of year, it comes up.  Mainly because my husband is a huge baseball fan.  I’ve never cared a ton about sports.  My parents prided themselves on being the sort of “intellectuals” who were too cool to root for much of anything.   

But my husband’s entire family is paint your face, don’t step on a crack the day your team plays, crazy for baseball.  They are “true” fans.

We met in the city, after college. The team here is a winner and rooting them was easy.  His hometown team, though, had always been underdogs, and it was endearing to me how he cheered for them no matter how much they lost.  I liked the challenge of memorizing the names of the players, the stats, the history, and I enjoyed surprising him when we watched by rattling off a random fact.

The year he became my fiancée, miracle of miracles, his team made the playoffs.  It was the first time the time in nearly 50 years.  Then, they made the World Series.  I had to get him tickets.

It was the sort of gesture you make for a fiancée when you are madly in love and willing to spend half your rent to surprise someone.  Not the best financial decision, but it was worth it to see the way he lit up.

We rode the train to the game.  I’m not a big beer drinker… I’ll have one or two.  But I went a bit overboard the night we went.  I was caught up in the entire endeavor.  The energy was electric.  The team was down.  Then they scored.  Then they were down again.  Even as a new fan I knew all about the history of the stadium and the legends about “the slump.”  It just added to the drama of the whole thing.

The beers added up, and I offered to go grab us hot dogs in the hopes of balancing it out (my husband was glued to his seat).  I also wanted to hit the restroom before the 7^(th) inning hit and it got mobbed. 

I went in and it was oddly quiet, but since the game was so tight I figured no one really wanted to leave.  There was one person in the stall next to me.  A faucet dripped and the person next to me shuffled.  I happened to look down at their feet and then quickly looked away.  I didn’t want to judge or intrude.  

The shoes were sort of retro, maybe a version of Doc Martins I didn’t know? But they were large and faced out at odd angles.  The person made a noise that started as a sort of high-pitched hum and then got lower.  I was done but figured I could sit a minute and listen to the game being broadcast in the bathroom and give them their privacy for whatever was going on.

Suddenly they flushed and ran from the bathroom.  They didn’t wash their hands (I admit, I judged).  When they left it sounded, very clearly like the door clicked behind them.  It sounded like it locked.  I did wash my hands, but something kept me from touching the door.  In the back of my head, I did think it might be locked.  I reapplied lipstick and listened to the game so I could come back at least knowing what had happened.  The sound system seemed to be malfunctioning.  The game was coming in and out now with plenty of static, which frustrated me.

I was picturing telling the story of the strange hummer to my fiancée when the door opened again.  Without looking I rushed over, grabbing it before it shut.  A large person shoved past me.  They smelled horrible.  Too much beer and too much excitement.  

When I came out, things were… different.  It was still the same stadium, still packed, but the colors seemed brighter, and the fans seemed less friendly.   Since the game had been garbled, I figured maybe the team had gotten way down in runs while I was in the bathroom, there was suddenly an uncomfortable air of hostility.

A man passed me as I was scanning the concessions stands for my hotdog and a line that wasn’t brutally long.  Instead of brushing by, he shouldered me, hard.  I held back my quick reaction when I noticed he was tall, very tall.  In fact, most of the people in the crowd, standing in line at the concessions stand, were a lot taller than me.  And more muscular.  I’m a solid 5’6 but at that moment I felt like a little kid.

 I wrote the shouldering off to playoff tension and kept walking.  It occurred to me I was hoping for that smell, that hot dog on a fall night smell, but it wasn’t there.  Instead the air smelled… synthetic.  Still beefy, grilled, but slightly rotten.  I wasn’t that hungry anymore and since I knew my fiancée wouldn’t care, and the hotdog might even be a distraction, I started making my way back to our seats.  The whole stadium was vibrating with the cheers and jeers.  I tried to look quickly at one of the mounted TVs to see what the score was, but it seemed to be showing something else.

 It looked like they were doing one of those silly games mid-inning things they do:  a man was half naked and being chased by the mascot through the field.  They man must have tripped at some point before I started watching because he had some grass on his face, lots of mud on his clothes and what appeared to be cuts.  The mascot looked disheveled too.  The “head” was slightly ajar and the cute cheeky tonged that was part of the costume appeared to be jeering at the man.

 A kid ran past, me and I got shouldered again.  Everything had felt wrong, but a kid shouldering me somehow set me at ease.  Would a kid be here, acting up, if it everything were not okay? I turned away and looked again for our section.  It was more crowded now and that smell of the hot dogs was stronger.  I didn’t see my fiancée as I walked.  I may have gotten more buzzed than I intended and these big stadiums are confusing, especially if you aren’t a regular.  it seemed half the crowd turned to look at me, I assumed I was making a fool of myself.

 I looked down on the field.  Instead of green, it was yellow.  A strange shade, I though, but maybe it was for a promotion?  It was also vast.  It was hard for me to see across to the other side and what I saw there was blurry, hundreds of thousands of faces.  It’s a big stadium (FACT:  40 thousand plus at capacity), but this looked far bigger.  It stretched far up into the sky and at steepness that didn’t seem to work.  Next to me I thought I heard a growl.  

And then suddenly, there was no noise.  I looked forward again and a path was cleared for me straight down to the dugout.  I had gotten good seats but nothing near the actual dugout.  Not sure what to do, and drunk, I tried to focus on the cement and walk.  I started stepping down, tripping at first.  A small hand reached out to touch my shoe.  It was a gentle, a “there you go,” sort of gesture.  I looked down at the small hand, tugging on my pant leg.  And then I noticed the hand had only 3, long, fingers.

I gasped and looked up.  On the big screen ahead I saw myself looking shocked.  The camera zoomed in on me and the crowd started laughing.  I’ve never been on the Jumbotron before, but this wasn’t ideal.  I could see the little hand too in real time, on my shoe, caressing.  Suddenly the hand was jerked off me, by a much larger hand.  This one stained a deep red and with more fingers than I could count.  

A song started up, quieting the laughter down, the one we’ve all heard a million times, but with different lyrics

*Take me out to the ballgame,*

*Take me out to our crowd…*

 *Buy me some people and crack their necks…*

*no one will know if they ever come back…*

*Let me ROOT ROOT ROOT for THEIR home team*

*Make them grin through their shame…* 

*For its once two three strike they’re out*

*At the old ball game.*

  
A man stood at the end of walkway right by the dugout.  He wore a top hat, and like everyone else was much taller than me.  An usher waved me along and I looked again frantically for my fiancée.  Not finding him, I tried to focus on the man, on his face but it was blank apart from his lips.  The smile was wide and inviting but apart from that I could make out no features.  It was as if someone had put a nylon over it, the eyes, ears, chin all blurred together into one flesh colored mass.

My face was still on the jumbotron.  Next to me, a man crunched a hot dog that sounded like all gristle.  I thought of my fiancée and how I had only wanted to do something nice and here I was and I suddenly realized I did not even really like baseball.

Okay, I thought, okay…

I turned and I ran.  I ran up the stairs.  They started to react, but though they were large, they were slow.  I saw the blinking exit sign was and I ran for that. 

I ran into the stairwell and looked as the door started to shut, this time hoping for the telltale click.  There was a roar coming from behind the door, feet and scraping and static.  It stunk in here too, a somehow sweet smell coming from up the stairs and the synthetic horrible hot dog smell from the door.  I heard a sound in the darkness and the sound of a lighter.

The stairs were concrete, no one ever took them as far as I could tell.  Maybe just the staff. A man moved from behind the staircase, a cigarette between his thin fingers.  He smiled.

 In the light of the exit sign, I could see that he wasn’t one of *them* but his skin was grey and his hair was long.  He had a thin mustache.  He sucked the cigarette in long gulps and smiled. 

“And look at you” he said.

 “Look at me what?” I said.  I was still drunk and scared and pissed and I was in no mood for this.

“Well for one, you’re rooting for the wrong team.” He said looking at my jersey. 

I laughed. 

“Buddy I could care less about this team.  It’s my boyfriend’s team.” 

“They suck.” He said.

“Cool” I said.

“Must be true love?”

“I think it is?” 

“You people,” he said, “messing everything up.  Do you know they offered me 3 packs of cigarettes to keep you here, to open the door.” 

I shrugged.  I couldn’t  compete with 3 packs of cigarettes.

 “And Hot Dogs” he said.  “Even though theirs are gross.”

“Gross hot dogs are still hotdogs” I said.

He sighed. 

“It’s the wrong team, but it’s the best team” he said.

“1975 world champions and we could do it again” I said automatically.  “Most runs ever scored in a game. 1984?”  I laughed.

“You still lost,” he said.  “When was the only no hitter?”

“1991.  Throw me a fucking hard ball” I said, disdainful   And he did.

For an eternity he asked me.  And I pulled out every stat I had learned, every nuance of fan obsession (weird ticks the players had, walk-up songs) on and on and on until he stopped. 

“You really don’t like baseball?” he said.

“I don’t dislike it,” I said.  “I’m just not THE fan.” 

“But this is how we make fans,” he said. 

 “What do you mean?” I said.

“Well they start small, with a friend or boyfriend.  Sort of a gateway fan?  But then they build up.  Sometimes it’s years, generations even.  In this case it has been a very long time and a lot of people tonight are willing to bet an awful lot to win.  And when they bet, they generally lose.”

He wiggled his eyebrows at me.  “This sort of chance comes around only every so often.  The chance to really take a lot.  But you can win,” he said.

I thought about how much I loved my fiancée and how much I wanted him to see his team win.

“No.” I said then. 

“Well I guess I can’t do this to you,” And shrugged and ground his cigarette out and pointed up the stairs.  Then he opened the door.

What else to say?  Not “come with me” because I did not want him with me. 

As I ran a question occurred to me.  I looked down, just for a second.  “Are you a fan?” 

There was a sea of men, but to be fair also women. A lot of them wore jerseys.  Some of them I recognized as throwbacks.

They screamed.  They screamed and tried to claw up the stairs.

“They bet on their team.” He said.  “Best harvest yet.  You people.”
