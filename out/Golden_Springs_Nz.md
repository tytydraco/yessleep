Guys, I had the weirdest experience ever last night at my Koros house. 

I don’t remember falling asleep. But I remember the dream.  

Wooden carvings of babies and women, their faces twisted in silent agony, burned in a fire that gave off no heat. Smoke curled into the air, thick and suffocating, but it wasn’t black—it was red, bleeding into the sky like an open wound. Steam billowed around me, rising in unnatural tendrils, wrapping around my arms and legs like it was alive. It was warm, too warm.  

I shifted slightly, half-stirring. The warmth didn’t fade.  

I was still dreaming, wasn’t I?  

My eyes fluttered open to darkness. The warmth was still there, lingering on my skin. I exhaled, slow and shaky, blinking to adjust. The room was too quiet, the kind of silence that made my ears ring. I started to turn, to reach for my phone—  

And I saw it.  

A shape stood at the foot of my bed.  

I froze. My breath caught in my throat, my heart hammering against my ribs. My body tensed, instinct screaming at me to move, but I couldn’t. My vision adjusted, the shadows shifting, but the figure didn’t. It wasn’t just standing there—it was watching me.  

The warmth was gone now, replaced by something else. Something wet.  

A slow, creeping horror wrapped around me as I became aware of the dampness between my legs. A cold, humiliating shock that made my stomach twist. I had wet myself.  

I wasn’t dreaming.  

The figure moved. Not forward, not back, just… changed. Its edges blurred, warping, like heat rising from pavement. One moment tall, the next twisted, flickering between shapes that weren’t quite human. My breath hitched as I gripped the sheets beneath me, my fingers trembling.  

I wanted to scream. To run. But all I could do was stare.  

I don’t know how long we stayed like that. Seconds? Minutes? Time didn’t feel real. Then, with a strangled sob, I moved. My hands shook as I pressed them against my damp pajama pants, my eyes wide with terror. Slowly, I looked back up.  

The thing was still there. Still watching.  

Tears burned my eyes as I forced my body to move. My hand lifted weak, unsteady as I reached forward, trying to push it away, to make it go away. My fingers barely brushed against the air where it stood. 

And then it was gone.  

Not like a person leaving a room. Not like something stepping back into the shadows. It simply wasn’t there anymore.

I gasped, sucking in a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. My whole body shook. My hands clenched in the sheets, the lingering dampness grounding me in a way I didn’t want. I wanted to move, to turn on the light, to run to Koro’s room like I was a child again. But I couldn’t. I just sat there, staring at the empty space where it had been.  

The air felt heavy. Off.  

Slowly, I pulled my trembling hands from the sheets, my breath hitching when I saw what was left behind.  

Ash.

A fine layer of it dusted my fingertips, dark and smudged. My stomach twisted, bile rising in my throat. It hadn’t been a dream.  

With a trembling hand, I reached for my phone. The screen lit up, and my breath caught.  

It was later than I thought. I think like hours later. Dawn had set in. It was like time had eluded me.
