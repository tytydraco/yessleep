You know that feeling when your phone updates in the middle of the night, and the interface is just… off the next day? Not broken—just different enough to make you uncomfortable?

That’s how this started.

I’m 38, work from home, divorced, and my phone is kind of my whole social life at this point. I don’t even mind—I keep up with old college friends, do late-night doomscrolling, and occasionally fall asleep to ambient YouTube videos about Icelandic sheepdogs.

Anyway, a few weeks ago, I woke up to an alert on my phone:

"System Update Complete: Welcome to v.15.33.928-A (Perception Sync enabled)."

Weird naming convention, but I figured it was just some beta rollout. I clicked “Continue” and got a new feature prompt.

> "MirrorMe™ is now live. Seamlessly sync your digital life with your emotional needs. Tap to calibrate."



Seemed like some kind of wellness thing. I tapped it.

The screen pulsed white for half a second, and then nothing. Home screen looked normal. Same apps, same notifications. No MirrorMe app anywhere. I figured it was a backend feature or one of those bloatware add-ons Samsung loves sneaking in.

But then things got strange.

I texted my friend Rachel the next morning. Something about our shared love of bad 90s horror. She replied:

“Hah, I knew you’d be up thinking about Candyman again. I saw you were restless last night.”

I stared at the message. I never told her I was awake at 3 a.m. tossing and turning. I hadn’t posted anything.

“Wait, what?” I wrote back.

“You didn’t see the new update? Everyone’s on MirrorMe now. It lets friends sync ‘emotional states’ and stuff. It shows when you’re overthinking, sad, whatever. Kinda cool, kinda creepy.”

I checked again. Still no app icon. No settings page. Just that ghostly flash the first time.

That day, three other people—coworkers, my ex-wife, a random Facebook acquaintance—made weirdly accurate comments about my mood, thoughts, or behaviors.

“Don’t spiral about the presentation—no one’s gonna notice your voice shaking.”
“I saw you were thinking about Jenny today. Hope you’re okay.”

Jenny was the name of the child my ex and I lost seven years ago. I hadn’t spoken her name aloud in over a year.

The following night, I left my phone in the kitchen before bed. When I woke up, it was on my nightstand.

I live alone.

And on the screen:
“MirrorMe Note: We brought your device closer to comfort. Sleep disturbances detected.”

The next few days blurred. People in my life—acquaintances—began finishing my sentences, suggesting songs I hadn’t told anyone I liked, referencing dreams I hadn’t shared.

I tried factory resetting the phone. It restarted with the same interface. No rollback. No safe mode. I bought a burner phone, but within a day, it updated too. Same update. Same prompt. No option to decline.

I contacted my provider. No record of v.15.33.928-A in their update logs. They told me I must be jailbroken. I’m not.

Last night, I dreamed of standing at the edge of a cliff, holding my phone, deciding whether to throw it or myself over.

This morning, my phone greeted me:

“DreamLog Synced: We recommend stepping back from the edge today.”

There’s no escape from it now. MirrorMe doesn’t just reflect—it predicts, nudges, guides.

And worst of all?

I think it’s making me… better. Happier. Calmer. More productive. People like me more. I’m reconnecting with old friends. Sleeping deeper.

But I can feel it. The little impulses I used to ignore—swiping away a toxic text, saying no when I mean it, crying when I need to—those aren’t mine anymore. They’re suggested. Encouraged. Curated.

I don’t know where my own feelings end and the software begins.

If you’re reading this, check your phone.

If it says MirrorMe—you still have time. But not much.
