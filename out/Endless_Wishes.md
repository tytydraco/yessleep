I’d found the artifact in an old bazaar, at an eerie old stall with an eerie old woman running it.  She glared over a peevish smirk — my being a foreigner and all — and offered me, in clear but reluctant English, a wrinkled, desiccated piece of fruit.  I declined, asking rather about this item and that, her being all the time very eager to assist me in buying whichever of her goods I expressed the most interest in.

Except one.  An old artifact, forged of some kind of smooth stone, shaped like an off-kilter sphere resting oddly — almost floating — upon a smooth, black platform.

I pointed, my interest piqued, and she looked, her head ricocheting back the moment she realized the point of my finger’s focus.

*No, sir.  This I cannot sell.*

This refusal stimulated a mild interrogation.

Was it priceless?  No.  Was it a family heirloom?  No.

Then what?

*It is dangerous, sir.  The human mind…*

She hesitated, as if questioning her line of thought.

*The man I got it from…*

I nodded, widened my gaze, prompting her to continue.

*He died of madness.*

This piqued my interest even more.

Madness?  I asked her what she meant.

*My brother is a civil servant.  The house he got this from… the man killed everyone in his building, then cut his own throat.*

Now I had to buy it.  I insisted, increasing my offer considerably upon each refusal, but she held fast, urging me to forget I’d seen it.

But that I could not do.

So I waited, strolling about the bazaar, buying this and that, stalling, waiting, never moving out of view of her lonely, solemn stall.

I waited all day.  Until the bazaar began closing down, all the merchants packing their gear and moving sluggishly toward a parking lot full of vans worn from the grit of desert air.

She moved slower than the rest, leaving lastly, her small frame supporting more luggage than I’d have thought possible.

But at a cost.

As if fate had willed it, the ominous sphere dropped out of a soft cloth bag she’d placed it in and rested temptingly on the sand-strewn floor.

The temptation overwhelming my moral sensibilities, which generally stood quite strong, I swiftly snuck up behind her and snatched the artifact, sneaking it into a large leather satchel I had swung securely over my shoulder.

It was mine.

In a weak attempt at rectitude I bid her good night, her wary gaze an admonition against a future terror of which she seemed only vaguely aware.

I, on the other hand, was elated.

I returned home in haste, never more eager to examine such a storied artifact, to reap the satisfaction of my compulsion in a close study of this eerily mysterious sphere.

On the base was scrawled, in an ancient language then unknown to me, what seemed to be three sentences, which through consultation with a local expert I deemed to read as follows:

*A single wish, to the owner of me.*

*With utmost caution, wish carefully.*

*A wish undone, such a wish is none, every wish effects for eternity.*

The intrigue of this piece overshadowed even its potential monetary value back home, and I cradled it in my grip, staring intently at it, and murmured, in an almost hypnotic drone, the single wish which — to me — was of the utmost logical priority.

I wished for unlimited wishes.

Nothing happened.  The orb sat calm in my hands as I watched it, the curious intensity of my gaze bearing down upon the inefficacy of its curse.

It was merely an artifact.  No magic.  No occult.  No single wish.

I tossed the artifact aside, my disappointment alleviated only at the prospect of the financial reward I would surely receive from antique dealers with a taste for the far-flung and the bizarre.

So much for truth from antiquity — a creative snake oil pitch, with some finely crafted artisanry to drive it home, the grandeur of ancient eras reduced to a timeless banality, to selfish, well-worked greed.

I stared at the artifact once more, a futile expectation of deliverance, a frustrated desire for *something* to come of this…

I froze, slightly awestruck, the anticipation of this ancient majesty having been at least partly fulfilled — the text on the base had changed.

According to the translator, the new words read as so:

*There is no sequence of wishes of unlimited scope.*

*Neither none, neither one, nor a number above.*

*You have no recourse, no silence, no pressing, but an endless refrain of evermore wishing.*

My enthusiasm quickly gave way to a deep, mortal terror.

I had to think through the consequences of this wish.  

A sequence of zero wishes was not possible — I *had* to wish.  But any non-zero sequence of wishes would of necessity fall short of *unlimited* — no finite sequence of wishes could be fulfilled.

*Neither none, neither one, nor a number above.*

I would be wishing, not only for the rest of my life, but for *all eternity*.

Frantic, seized with terror to my spirit’s depths, I lunged for my bag and grasped my pistol, raising its cold, steel barrel to my ear.

*May no desire be fulfilled.*

The gun vanished from my grip, and I began to pray.
