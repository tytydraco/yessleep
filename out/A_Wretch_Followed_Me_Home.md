I didn’t mean to bring it here.

I didn’t even know it had followed me.

At least, not at first.

Two months ago, I camped through a stretch of the Allegheny I had never set foot in before, despite living near that side of Pennsylvania, all my life. The forest there is old—older than memory, older than names—but I hadn’t thought much about that when I set out. My plan was simple: a friend dropped me off at the far edge of my route, and over the next few days, I’d wind my way toward a secluded parking spot where I had left my car, waiting to take me home.

It should have been an ordinary trip. But now, back in my quiet little town, something is wrong.

There were signs, in hindsight. A wrongness in the woods. Small, fleeting things—a shift in the trees when they should have been still, followed by a hush that settled too suddenly when I passed. The feeling of being watched, of something just behind me, waiting.

I ignored them.

And now, something has followed me home.

There’s an unspoken rule among hikers: if you see someone in trouble and you can help, you do. It’s just how it is.

So when I saw her—an old woman hunched at the edge of the ravine, her ragged camping gear barely clinging to her thin frame, fishing line dipped into the water—I stopped. She wasn’t catching anything. The line just floated, still and lifeless, as if even the fish knew better than to come near.

I had extra food. It was the decent thing to do.

Up close, she was… kind. But there was something wrong with her kindness. It clung to her words like damp moss, soft but suffocating. She told me she lived nearby, liked to spend time in the forest—said it made her feel *close* to nature.

I wanted to believe her. But her matted hair, the dirt pressed into the lines of her face, the strange *stillness* of her presence made me wonder.

She didn’t seem dangerous.

But I didn’t believe her, either. 

The pauses between her sentences stretched just a little too long, like she was listening for something I couldn’t hear. All the while, she kept her eyes locked on mine—not searching, not curious, just… holding me there.

It was enough to set me on my way with a friendly goodbye.

She only nodded, then turned back to the ravine, squatting low, flipping rocks with slow, deliberate movements. Looking for crayfish.

I walked on. But not long after, I felt *off*—not lost, exactly, but like the woods around me had stretched in a way they shouldn’t have. My compass pointed true, my map made sense, and yet, something felt *wrong*.

It was the tree.

A towering thing, old and gnarled, with a hollow cavity yawning at its base, a pit leading down into the tangled roots. I noticed it the first time and made a mental note of it—hard to miss something like that. But the second time, an hour later, I felt like I had *remembered* it before I even saw it. Like my mind had conjured it before my eyes could confirm it was real.

That tree was one of a kind. It shouldn’t have been here *twice*.

And then, across a field just before dusk, I saw it again.

By then, I was too tired to make sense of it. I set up camp for my final night, but sleep didn’t come easy.

I was thoroughly spooked, but exhaustion dulled the edges of my fear. I’d been running on a minimal diet for two days, pushing myself hard through rough patches of the trail. I was worn down, my body aching in that deep, spent way that made thinking feel slow. Rationally, if there was anything to worry about, it was wildlife—I’d been on the lookout for that, not shadows and tricks of the mind.

Then came what I *thought* was a dream.

I lay in my tent, stretched out on my back, the bottom zipper flap left open to let air through the second, screen-covered flap. Outside, the forest breathed with the sound of wind through the trees—branches swaying, limbs creaking, the slow groan of old wood shifting in the night.

And yet… my tent was still.

Not a ripple along the fabric. No breeze against my skin. The air inside was stagnant, thick with the scent of damp earth and nylon.

Was it even windy?

I sat up, pulse thudding in my ears, and reached for the zipper—

Then I saw them.

Bare feet. Right at the entrance of my tent.

My breath hitched in my throat, trapped there like a stone. The skin was pale, almost gray in the moonlight. The toenails were yellowed, thick, packed with dirt that filled every crevice. As I watched, they flexed—long toes stretching, then curling back down, nestling into the earth like they belonged to it.

I couldn’t move.

Then, my instincts caught up, and I scrambled for my knife—

A giggle.

Soft. *Wrong.*

And then, the frantic rustling of something—*someone*—bolting away into the dark.

I exploded out of the tent, desperate not to be trapped inside, my hands snatching for my knife and flashlight as I stumbled into the night. My breath was ragged, my heartbeat a frantic hammering in my skull.

And then I saw her.

Fifteen yards away, hunched low, nude, her back to me.

She was squatting at the base of *that tree*.

The one with the hollowed-out cavity. The one I had seen again and again, no matter which way I traveled.

She faced the darkness inside it, motionless, her long, brown, matted hair cascading down the length of her spine like wet roots.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.

Then, her shoulders *twitched*. A slow, deliberate movement—like she knew I was watching.

My fingers went numb. The knife and flashlight slipped from my grasp, falling uselessly to the ground—

And then I woke up.

Dawn crept through the trees, painting the world in weak gold. My breath came in gasps, my body clammy with cold sweat.

A dream.

I *wanted* it to be a dream.

But outside my tent, the dirt was disturbed, my flashlight and knife exactly where I had dropped them. The sight sent a pulse of cold through my veins. I never left my gear out overnight—never. My fingers shook as I bent to pick them up, my skin crawling with the realization: something had happened last night. Something real.

I didn’t think. Didn’t hesitate. I shoved my bag out of the tent, packed my tarp and poles with shaking hands, and started moving.

My planned hike out should have taken six or seven hours.

I made it in two.

I didn’t see the tree. I didn’t see the woman.

I got to my car. I got myself home.

And for a while, I almost slipped back into normalcy.

Weeks passed. I convinced myself it had been exhaustion, stress, an overactive mind feeding into fear.

Then came the first child’s disappearance.

And the second…. The third.

Then the search parties—neighbors, friends, volunteers combing through the woods with flashlights and flyers. And then, eventually, *me*.

I told myself I was helping. That I was doing my part. **It was the decent thing to do.**

And I found it.

Not deep in the forest. Not miles away in some forgotten hollow.

Just behind the city library, yards into the tree line.

A towering thing, old and gnarled, with a hollow cavity yawning at its base, a pit leading down into the tangled roots.

It shouldn’t have been here.

It shouldn’t *be*.

A tree older than time. More sinister than I could ever imagine.

And then, the worst part. I followed the barefoot prints—small, delicate, pressing deep into the damp earth. They led past the trees. Through the brush. Out of the darkness of the forest… And onto the soft, mulch-covered ground of the playground.

The slide. The swings. The empty merry-go-round.

A single footprint pressed into the sand beneath the monkey bars, as though someone had stood there, watching. Waiting.
