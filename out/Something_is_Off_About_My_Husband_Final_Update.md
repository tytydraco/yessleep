I did it. I did it. I feel sick. I fucking did it. That *thing* is not and was not my husband. It can’t have been. It wasn’t. 



I remember it. I was digging through the cabinets like my life depended on it. My life probably did depend on it. I don’t know. I don’t know why I did this. I knew that I would need to be fast. I wasn’t worried about finding anything good, just something that would get the job done. With the way he follows me, with the way his *eyes* trace my every single step- This was my one chance. Flat iron. Hairbrush. Shampoo bottle. I landed on the hair dryer. It was heavy enough. Solid enough, too. It would have to work. It *did* work. Thank Christ. 



It was talking to me through the door. It had his voice, you know. My sweet husband’s voice on such a wretched creature. It asked me soft questions. Ones that my real husband might have asked. But it can’t be my real husband. It couldn’t have been. I wrapped the cord of the dryer around my wrist. I couldn’t afford to slip up here. 



That’s when I started to unlock the door. I was slow. I knew it would be waiting outside for me. It always was. It was always looming so, so close to me. I hated it. I did! I did! I hated the damn thing so much! I just needed to rid myself- no, *us*, of it. Once it was gone, maybe then my husband would come back to me… 



I had only barely unlocked the door when the knob started to twist. I drew my hand back. I was ready. Whatever he tried, I would be ready. I was going to get my husband back. 



It poked its head through the small gap in the door. All I could do was bring down my hand. I heard him stumble, but I felt like my soul left my body for a minute. I just had to protect my daughter and I from this impostor. I followed after him and swung again. I swung harder. 



I could see red now. I was going to win. The red meant I was winning. The red meant I would survive. He was on the ground. He didn’t even try to fight me back. I swung again, and again, and again. 



This *thing* was not my husband. It wore his skin, his clothes, his voice- but it wasn’t him. It can’t have been him. I wouldn’t have killed my husband. This thing tried so hard to be my husband but it fucking failed. I found it out and I took action. I felt sick. I still feel sick. I hope I’m right. No matter what though- I think a dead James is better than a fake one. I want my husband back and I want him put back together right. If they send me another fake one, I’ll kill it just like I did this one, and I’ll do it a hundred times over until I get the real one. 



I don’t know what to do. I keep crying. I don’t know why. That wasn’t James, I shouldn’t be so upset. I feel sick with myself. I wanted to curl up and die right there with him right after I killed it. My daughter deserves her real fathers, though. She doesn’t have to know what happened. If I’m lucky, she won’t remember any of this. I really tried to get the stain out of the carpet, and she was at school while it happened. Maybe things will finally give. 



 I spent hours cleaning up, and the dryer was completely busted. That can be replaced. The body is hidden in a place that nobody will ever find it. And nobody will ever suspect a thing. 



It’s been a few days since I wrote that first half. My daughter didn’t ask any questions, despite my husband and I usually picking her up together. She looks at the browned stain in the hall as she passes it. Sometimes, she just stops and stares. I feel for her, really, I do. I think the best thing for her right now is to just let her reach her own conclusions. 



The house is so quiet. I can hear every settlement of the house. I can hear the clock ticking. I hear the branches of our tree scratching against the siding. It is driving me insane, I think. James still isn’t back. I keep leaving the TV on in hopes he’ll show up and tell me off for it. He doesn’t. 



I sometimes wonder if maybe having the fraud around would actually be better than not having him at all. I know it wasn’t, but I miss my husband. I wish I had more reminders of him than just these pictures. Pictures don’t talk. Pictures don’t accidentally shove you out of bed in the middle of the night. Pictures don’t hold you and tell you everything will be ok. 



All I have is pictures, though. I keep going through my camera roll even now. Pictures of him laughing, smiling, playing with our daughter. I wonder if he would have been proud of me for protecting her. I hope I was right. 



The skies at night are so incredibly dull when there are no stars to shine in it.
