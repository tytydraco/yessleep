Born in a relatively small town myself making the move to an even smaller town for work was certainly no big deal. I always liked the "isolated cut off from the rest of the world" aspect of a town it meant that everyone knew everyone, and nobody was ever a stranger. That was just ok by me being a deputy sheriff and all, that meant I never had to face the uneasiness of having to meet new people and be afraid of who they might be. 

However, of course being made to move due to your job would mean I was now the outsider in a small town that nobody knew, kind of ironic am I right?

Since I had no other choice, I suppose the only option was to bite the so called "bullet" and become the stranger in this small but yet so isolated town. 

Pine Groove was the exact definition of what you would call "A town in the middle of nowhere" nothing but mountains and forest on every side of the town for as long as the eye could see. 

After hours and hours of driving past what felt like miles and miles of nothing but woods and overgrown weeds I saw it, a bright green sign that lit up the dark asphalt road like the 4th of July when my headlights fell upon it. "Pine Groove next right" the sign read in big white letters that just about jumped off the sign as I passed it.

As I made the right down the pebble infested road that felt more like a driveway that had not been paved in 20 years versus a road that belonged to a town, I noticed that I was the only car on the road. That did not really strike me as odd as to be honest it was 2am and I just assumed everyone was asleep that was until the flashing of red and blue lights reflected in my mirror interrupting my thoughts. 

I pulled over to the side of the road to only see the sheriff slowly move around my car staring me down as he passed by. I shook my head rubbing the sleep out of my eyes as I continued forward down the poorly lit pebble road. 

I took another turn on to a tiny, secluded street with only 5 houses on the entire block my house being the only one on the street that had a finished garage, I just simply chucked that up as the town not being rich enough to build many expansions to houses and simply left it at that. 

Entering the house and being able to just throw my bags down and hit the couch that the movers kindly moved in for me a few days prior to me moving in was a relief after being on the road for 9 hours. 

The sun was just beginning to peak through when the sound of my doorbell filled the nearly empty house with an echo so loud it made me jolt awake in a state of panic.

After getting my baring's back and managing to get over to the door I opened it slowly to see a man with a huge grin on his face now standing on the front porch of my house. 

"Hello there, I'm sorry to bother you so early but I wanted to properly introduce myself before anyone else got the chance it is kind of my thing when it comes to knew people my name is Scott" the tall older man said chuckling as he held out his wrinkled hand as if to firmly welcome me to the neighborhood.

"Alex" – I said taking his hand and shaking it. – "Nice to meet you so what brings you to town Alex" – Scott said keeping that same wide grin on his face. – "Well, I just transferred here as a deputy sheriff" I replied not trying to make it clear that his smile was creeping me out. 

Just as that smile appeared however it was gone when he leaned in and said with the most blankest expression, I have ever seen on anyone's face  before "You be careful now this town is not always nice to outsiders" before I had a chance to respond that same smile appeared back on his face as he turned to walk back to his house not saying another word as he did so. 

He seemed like a nice guy, but there was just something off about him that I could not place but right now I am just to tired and irritated from the long trip and just want to get a little bit more sleep before I have to fully unpack. 

After taking a short nap, I decided I would go and unpack a few boxes setting some stuff aside before going out to take a little walk to explore the town before it got dark again. After all, if I was going to be a deputy sheriff here I mise well get to know the lay of the land while I have the time to still do so as I start literally tomorrow.

I honestly knew there wasn’t much to be seen, but I wanted to get some quality fresh air before I had to slave away at unpacking boxes and figuring out where all this crap was going to go. 

As soon as I turned to leave the porch of my house a voice came from behind me, "Oh hello there" I turned around to see an elderly lady standing in front of me with a warm smile plastered across her face holding what looked to be a bowl of brownies. 

“Hello, ma’am.” – I smiled back – “My name’s Alex.” 

"Alex what a nice name" – she said moving closer to me – "I brought you some freshly made brownies from the oven, but do be careful hun they are very hot" 

She handed the plastic container to me, still smiling with that warm gentle smile plastered across her face. "Uh thank you, ma’am. That’s really kind of you.” – I said turning to open the front door and set them down on the inside mantel next to the door. 

“You can call me Barbra by the way dear” – the lady said with a much wider smile now plastered across her face. 

"Ok nice to meet you ma’am I mean Barbra" I said as I walked by her and down the sidewalk. 

Maybe living here wouldn’t be so bad, I thought to myself as I continued down the sidewalk. 

Toward the end of my walk, I looked to my left to cross the street back to my house when something in the distance on a hill just inside the town limits caught my eye. 

A blinking red light of some sorts, just shined ominously over the town as the sun began to set. 

As tired as I was, I didn’t give it too much thought and was just happy to be home and able to rest. 

I went to the sheriff's office, which was only a few minutes of a drive away from my house. The office looked exactly like how it was back home, which really made me feel at home. The coworkers welcomed me, with the same warm smiles and we talked briefly before I headed out on patrol for the first of many times. 

It was around 6pm when I returned home, and the sun had already started to set over this sleepy little town that I now called home. I got in and set my keys, gun, and badge on the mantel next to the front door when I realized shit I never got anything for dinner.

With one look back at the door I sighed as I grabbed my keys from the mantel and went back out the door as quick as I had come in. 

I drove to the nearby store which was only a 2 minute drive down the street and placed my car into park and proceeded into the store. After buying some frozen pizza and tater tots, I left the store to be greeted by my neighbor Scott and his wife who seemed to be out shopping as well. 

“Hey Alex. How was your first day here?” – Scott grinned again – “This is my wife Sarah, by the way.” 

I shook her hand and told her it was nice to meet her as Scott continued on talking to me with his usual wide creepy smile plastered all over his face. 

“So, I was just telling Sarah about you.” – he said grinning – “We haven’t seen a new face in… well, a long time!”

“It’s true.” – Sarah smiles as well – “But whoever comes here, usually never wants to leave. I guess they just love the peacefulness of this town so much. I mean, who would want to leave a town that gets no foot traffic and is always so quite anyway right?

Looking past Sarah as she spoke, I saw Barbra come out the front door of her house behind Scott and Sarah, taking out the trash. She waved and I waved back as Sarah continued on. 

“Now let's not forget honey, this town has its pluses as well.” – Scott interjected.

Just as Scott was about to continue on about the town's advantages compared to others that blinking red light that seemed to shadow the town in a coat of red was now no longer blinking it was just one solid color of red. 

I stared at the once blinking red light and asked:

“Hey Scott, what’s with that light over there? first it was blinking now it's solid.  – I said pointing at the hillside, squinting my eyes.

Neither he or Sarah were smiling anymore and were now instead just staring over my shoulder, with a blank facial expression at the solid red light that now illuminated over the town. I went to call out to Scott again when 4 black SUVs came around the corner onto the street where we were standing caught my attention.

The slowed down looking at me as they passed with a blank expression on their face as they did. Thats when I noticed everyone that was on the street including Barbra was now in this staring trance just captivated by the glooming red light. 

As the SUVs past and disappeared down the street the red light went back to blinking again and when I turned my attention back to Sarah and Scott they seemed to be back to normal, smiling again. I looked over their shoulders at Barbra and saw that she was placing the trash bag in the can and heading back inside.

“Hey Alex, are you okay buddy?” – Scott asked.

I turned my attention back to him and Sarah and just stared, trying to figure out what the hell just happened. I probably looked like a lunatic staring at them, but I did not care something was going on in this small town and I was determined to figure out what it was and how to stop it.
