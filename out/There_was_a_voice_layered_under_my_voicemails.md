Not every day do I get to spend time with my family after moving abroad. But they’ve always been loving—they call daily, check in, share little moments that feel like home. If they don’t call, I do. It’s the least I can do.

Lately, though, life had been overwhelming. Between classes and a new part-time job, my body and mind felt stretched thin. Instead of long conversations, I started leaving short voice messages in the family chat—quick updates, small comforts.

That worked… until last week, when I recorded a message half-asleep in my bed.

Around 4 a.m., my phone buzzed. Groggy, I answered. Before I could speak, her voice pierced through the speaker:

“Hello?! Darling—are you alright!?”

I rubbed my eyes. “Yes… Mom?”

Her voice trembled. “Honey… who do you live with? Who are your roommates?”

“Mom, I live alone. The landlord said roommates won’t move in until next month.”

She paused. Then, quietly: “Darling… are you sure? Because the person in your voice messages… is concerning.”

I froze, suddenly awake. “…What do you mean?”

She told me to listen to my voicemail.

Normally, I avoid replaying my recordings. I hate the sound of my own voice. But this time… my voice was the least of my concerns.

The latest message wasn’t just me talking about my day. Something else was layered beneath it.

Faint.
Breathy.
Choked.

At first, I thought it was static—until it shifted into gasping. My hair stood on end. A shiver crawled down my spine, my body locking as if it wanted to freeze itself.

I couldn’t sleep that night.

The sound was too real. Too deliberate.

What was it? I had no clue. Too vivid to dismiss.

But… what could I even do?

Exhaustion eventually won. By the next day, I almost managed to forget… until I sent another voice update.

I was sitting on my bed, heel lightly tapping the wooden drawer beneath. After recording, I decided to check—listening carefully, bracing myself.

Relief. Nothing. Just my voice.

But it didn’t last.

The voice returned.

This time, screeching. Distressed. Distorted. Like something being ripped apart. I nearly dropped my phone.

Panicked, I tried again—this time staying silent. Yet the recording bar moved on its own, pulsing like a heartbeat.

When it finished, my throat went dry. I didn’t want to press play. My mind already feared it would scream.

But I forced myself.

It wasn’t screaming. Worse. Something choking. Muffled. Like a creature trying to scream with shards stuck in its throat.

That night, I refused to sleep. Lights on, body stiff with paranoia. But exhaustion dragged me under anyway.

I woke at 6 a.m., tried to stand… and stumbled. My ankle ached. Looking down, I noticed the bed drawer was open.

Odd. I never use it.

I groaned, irritated by the strangeness of the last two nights. I got up and started my day, but my mind kept circling back to that open drawer.

At work, my barista shift gave me a brief reprieve. I even chatted with my family—something normal amid the chaos.

Later, a voice message from my mother arrived.

I stared at it, then experimented. Recorded a reply. Sent it. Replayed it once. Twice.

Nothing but my voice.

I realized… whatever was happening, it only occurred at home.

That night, back in my apartment, I tried again. Record. Listen. Silence. Still nothing.

I felt foolish. Maybe my phone was glitching. I sighed, tossed it onto the bed, and lay down with a shaky laugh. Maybe it was nothing.

Days passed. I finally had time off and decided to cook a proper dinner. Midway through, my landlord messaged: a roommate would move in next week. She asked about room details.

There went my freedom.

Hands messy from cooking, I sent a quick voice reply, then returned to stirring, thinking about the kind of person this roommate might be.

Minutes later, her reply arrived. I glanced at the screen—then froze.

“Is there someone with you? We agreed no outsiders. But… are they okay? They sound as if they’re suffering.”

The room shrank. My stomach dropped.

Slowly, I tapped my sent message.

And listened.

My eyes widened.

The choking.
The breathy, muffled voice.

Everything returned.
The roommate arrived a few days later, suitcase in hand, his presence quiet, almost too careful. He introduced himself with a nod, his eyes scanning the room as if weighing every corner. That was it—conversation ended.

We didn’t talk much. The air between us felt heavy, unspoken, like we were both waiting for something to happen.

From the start, he was clumsy in small ways. Almost knocked over the kitchen shelf, misjudged the narrow hallway. Nothing alarming—just… off.

The next day, I noticed a bandage on his wrist. A crescent welt along his ankle.

I summoned the courage. “What happened?” I asked.

He shrugged. “Must’ve caught it on a corner,” he said lightly, but there was something hollow in his tone. He moved on as if dismissing it would make it vanish.

But the marks multiplied each day, appearing and fading like bad weather—silent, stubborn, impossible to ignore.

Three days in, after we’d spent most of the day locked in our rooms, he knocked on my door first.

I opened it to find him looking worried, pale, uneasy.

“Hey… uh,” he began, hesitating, “is there a cat in here?” His voice was half-joking, half-confused.

“No cats,” I said. “No pets allowed.”

He laughed, but it was thin, fragile, like a paper fan trembling in the wind. “Really… weird,” he murmured, scratching the back of his neck.

“I… always wake up with bite marks on my hands,” he admitted. His gaze dropped. “They don’t bleed—just a little dried blood in the morning.”

I couldn’t deny it. I’d seen the same.

A week of small bites, quiet denials, and a tension that clung like humidity weighed on us both. I watched for patterns, like someone scanning traffic before crossing a busy street.

Why were we both experiencing this? The apartment was the only constant. Almost… paranormal.

I tried recording messages again. Strangely, no choking noises appeared. Relief washed over me—but instinct told me our troubles were connected.

I stayed closer to him after that, observing, trying to understand, hoping to catch whatever was hiding in the corners of our apartment.

A few days later, I noticed he was sick. Dizzy, head spinning. He could barely stand. I guessed he wouldn’t be able to eat alone, so I brought him food.

He sent a voice message in return, too weak to type.

I froze when I listened.

The choking noises…
The muffled, desperate gasping…

The voice was in his message.

I rushed to his room immediately.
He lay on the bed, one hand dangling over the edge, pale and trembling in the dim light. When he saw me, he tried to sit up, to look composed—but it didn’t matter. He looked exhausted, fragile, like a puppet missing strings.

“Everything okay?” he asked, voice barely steady.

“I think… you need to hear this,” I said, sitting beside him. I played the voice messages, each one a distorted echo of horror.

His eyes widened, fixating on the phone. “What… is that voice?”

He shifted uncomfortably, glancing at me for answers. I told him my side of the story, showing the recordings. He froze, confusion and fear etched into his face. “But… what is happening?”

Neither of us knew.

I left him there, went back to my room, and recorded while staying completely silent. Nothing.

The kitchen. Still nothing.

Finally, back in his room, I tried again. The recording bar moved. 

The voice can nove....

Something… was in the room.

He stiffened, eyes darting nervously. Whatever it was, it was hiding, waiting. I moved quietly, recording, methodical. The sound grew loudest near the bed.

We shared a look. I insisted he leave the room. He hesitated, —but I couldn’t let him stay. Not like this. What if it struck while we were both trapped?

I left him in the kitchen and returned alone.

The bed mirrored mine. A wooden drawer peeked beneath it. My suspicion was correct. I set my phone to record everything.

Deep breath.

I reached down. 
Slowly, I pulled the drawer.

A sharp pain shot into my neck before I could think anything.

Something white burst forth.

I staggered back, grabbing it and flinging it across the room.

It was the size of a large cat. Skinless, raw, grotesque. The texture was like dried parchment, yet disturbingly flexible. It was silent, moving with frantic tapping noises.

A long neck, ending in a humanoid head…
Bulging eyes that I could not, would not, stare at.

It darted toward the door, following the light.

I moved fast, grabbing him, swinging open the front door. We bolted. I wasn’t sure what it had been. But I knew it was dangerous. 

The door remained open as we escaped.

We ran as fast as our legs could carry us, away from the house, away from the neighborhood, until the world felt safe again.

Somewhat...

First priority was going to the doctor.

My neck, deep but uninfected.

My roommate… he wasn’t so lucky. Blood loss from the past week had left him dizzy, weak.

It’s been a week since that night. No recordings remain; the creature had smashed my phone in its frenzy.

But I’ll never forget it.

Those bulging eyes. That humanoid head. That skinned, impossible body racing with unnatural speed.

The bite marks on my back… I can’t stop noticing them. I can’t stop thinking about the creature.
