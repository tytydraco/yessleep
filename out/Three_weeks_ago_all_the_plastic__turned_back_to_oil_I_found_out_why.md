Three weeks ago, all the plastic in my house turned to oil. I found out why.

I woke up on March 16th to the smell of crude oil. At first, I thought there was a gas leak or something wrong with my car in the garage. But when I stumbled to the bathroom, my toothbrush had melted into a black puddle in the sink.

My phone was a sticky mess on the nightstand. The plastic casing had liquefied overnight, leaving behind the metal frame and glass screen floating in what looked like motor oil. I thought I was losing my mind.

By noon, it was clear this wasn’t just happening to me. The emergency broadcast came through on my old transistor radio – the only device that still worked since it was mostly metal and wood. “Widespread reports of plastic degradation… stay indoors… avoid contact with petroleum-like substances…”

But staying indoors was impossible. My refrigerator seals had failed, food was spoiling. The plastic pipes under my sink had turned to sludge, flooding my kitchen. My car was undrivable – the dashboard, steering wheel cover, and half the interior components were just… gone. Melted into pools of black oil that reeked of chemicals.

I’m a chemist. Was a chemist. Worked for a small lab before all this started. So when Dr. Chen’s research got leaked online three days later, I understood what had happened. And I wish I didn’t.

Chen Industries had been working on plastic-eating bacteria. Sounds great, right? Solve the plastic pollution problem. Except their modified bacteriophages didn’t just eat plastic in controlled lab conditions. They spread. And they carried something else with them – some kind of enzyme that could break down ANY synthetic polymer.

The leaked documents showed they knew it was spreading as early as March 10th. Five days before my toothbrush melted. Five days of covering it up while this thing went global.

Here’s the part that keeps me awake at night: it’s not random. The thing is smart. It targets plastic based on molecular structure, and it’s getting better at it. Week one, it only affected simple polymers – polyethylene bags, bottles, containers. Week two, it started on the complex stuff – electronics, car parts, medical devices.

Now, week three, it’s going after things I didn’t even know contained plastic. The coating on my pills. The binding in books. The synthetic fibers in my clothes. I’m down to cotton, wool, and whatever natural materials I can scavenge.

But that’s not the worst part.

Yesterday, I found a dead bird in my yard. When I got closer, I could see its feathers were… wrong. Discolored. Oily. I did some research, and about 30% of bird feathers contain synthetic materials from environmental pollution – microplastics they’ve ingested over their lifetime.

The enzyme is in the food chain now. It’s in the water. It’s in us.

I’ve been tracking the spread through ham radio networks – one of the few communication methods still working. Reports are coming in from everywhere. Cities are collapsing as infrastructure fails. Planes have been grounded since their composite materials started failing. Hospitals are running out of supplies because everything medical is made of plastic.

The government keeps saying they have a solution, that they can neutralize the enzyme. But I’ve read the leaked research. This thing reproduces. It adapts. And it’s designed to spread through bacterial hosts that are literally everywhere in our environment.

Three days ago, I noticed something that made my blood run cold. The metal fillings in my teeth have started to taste… different. Bitter. Chemical-like. I looked it up – modern dental composites contain plastic polymers.

I can feel it working inside my mouth.

The worst part? I think I know where this is heading. Our bodies are full of synthetic materials we’ve absorbed over decades. Microplastics in our bloodstream. Polymer-based medications. Synthetic hormones. Artificial joints and implants.

My neighbor had a hip replacement ten years ago. Last week, he started walking with a limp again. Yesterday, he couldn’t get out of bed.

I’m documenting this because I think I’m running out of time. The taste in my mouth is getting stronger. I’ve started coughing up something dark. And when I looked in the mirror this morning, I could swear I saw an oily sheen on my skin.

If you’re reading this, check your house. Look for the oil puddles. Smell the air. If you smell petroleum where there shouldn’t be any, it’s already too late for your area.

And whatever you do, don’t trust the government reports saying this is contained. It’s not. It’s in the bacterial populations now. It’s in the soil, the water, the air we breathe.

We created something that can break down the synthetic world we built. But we never asked what would happen when there was nothing left to break down except the synthetic parts of ourselves.

I have to go now. The oil is seeping under my door, and I can hear something moving in it. Something that shouldn’t exist. I think the bacteria are mutating, getting bigger as they consume more plastic. And I’m starting to think they might be getting hungry for something else.

If anyone finds this, tell my family I’m sorry. We thought we were saving the world. Instead, we ended it.

The plastic age is over. I just wish I knew what came next.

UPDATE: It’s been 6 hours since I wrote this. The oil is everywhere now, and it’s… moving. I can see shapes in it, like it’s forming patterns. Almost like it’s trying to communicate. I think the bacteria have become something else. Something aware.

I’m sealing myself in the bathroom – it’s the only room with no plastic. But I can smell the oil seeping through the walls. And the taste in my mouth is getting stronger.

I think I’m becoming part of it.
