So I want to preface this story by saying the names of people and the actual institution have been changed because when I asked my grandad if I could tell his story he said I could but only if I changed names. I am also gonna tell the story from the first person, this is just easier for me because I'm not really good at writing.  
  
So this part of my life began in 70s when i was 13-14 years old, I wasn't exactly a good kid, I was a bit of bully and i wasn't very well behaved at home, smoking, stealing, graffiti and other stuff I don't wanna mention, you see my family was quite poor after my father died my mother was always working and my older brother maily looked after us but he had enough headache with my other siblings who were all younger than me this gave me the breathing room to act like an asshole. Until my behaviour got out of control.  
  
A teacher at my school used to pick on me alot not like I made it hard for him to do that, well I had found my fathers dog tags that my mother hid away in her room with all of his other stuff, I don't know why but I took them and started wearing them I guess I liked the idea of father being a super strong soldier i didn't really know my father all that well so really the only idea i did have of him was a tough guy I guess, well anyway to cut a long story short this teacher ripped my dog tags off of me and threw them saying "you shouldn't wear that if you're not a soldier you disrespectful little brat!" I lost my mind and I blacked out. When I stopped blacking out I was on top of my teacher smashing his face in, my fists were covered in blood, I saw a group of teachers coming towards me and before I could even get up I was tackled to the floor...   
  
My mother decided that enough was enough, and she had gotten some brochures to send me to a ‘tough love’ school called “Goldenrod Institute”. I was sleeping in my cosy little single bed when it happened, 3 large figures stood over me, they mostly blended in with dark at first so I wasn’t even sure what I was looking at but then I felt a heavy handed grab to what felt like a demon grabbing me from by bed, was I about to be pulled into the abyss never to be seen again? Yes I was.   
  
Suddenly a light turns on, the light hits my eyes blinding me for a moment the 3 blurry beasts collectively must of weighed over 900 lbs, I then felt another heavy hand grab both my legs as they lift me into the sky, these people weren’t demons or beasts they were just 3 average looking guys, I was never the kind of kid who would cry much usually I would respond with anger when something made me upset but this time was different for some reason I just started crying uncontrollably to the point where my jaw was hurting and my face was bright red, I saw my mother, brother and sisters who all looked sad but not as much as I was, i just screamed for my mother at the time “Please, Im sorry, I’m sorry, Please don't let them, Please mommy Please mommy” but it was too late I was in the van, I felt a small prick on my arm before  waking up, it was day time somehow time had passed a few hours into the future i felt tired, slow and groggy was I drugged? No way isn’t that illegal?   
  
I get out of the van in a slow and submissive way, barely being able to walk, so I resort to dragging my feet. The sun is shining bright in my eyes before I make out a large concrete building. The place oozed suffering. Where was I? I mean this place felt superficial, it felt like a hospital, because on one hand you have the concrete building and on the other you have kids toys outside the front of the place but getting a closer look the toys were all rotted away, a graveyard of innocence how poetic…  
  
So thats all my Grandpa told me he was very vague about the rest just saying “oh yeah the rest was really bad as well a lot of violence and abuse” before getting up leaving to go make himself a coffee, I did try to pry more out off him but he was very shut off after that, I will have to try another time so sorry that the story isn’t completed yet I guess hopefully I can get more to you all in a couple days, I mean I’m guessing he doesn’t wanna talk about it because it’s messed up for him, but what to you all think about this so far? for me it's pretty messed up how they just showed up to his house when he was sleeping and they might have drugged him?
