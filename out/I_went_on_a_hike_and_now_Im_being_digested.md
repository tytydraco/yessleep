Just about another mile and a half. That’s what the view from the top of the hill I was standing on told me was the distance between myself and the thinning trail of black smoke that was my goal. Typically I don’t trek this far out from my home, but I had motivation. I live about seventeen miles away from any city at the least. Living alone can seem, well, lonely but I don’t mind it. I have nature to surround me and my small one floor home. Enjoying walks is easy when there’s no sound of humanity surrounding me, pulsing through my eardrums at all times. Again, however, I never go this far out.



Approximately two hours ago, a massive crash and rumbling enveloped my neck of the woods. Of course, I had to see what it was. Not that I had any ideas, but it had to be some people potentially in trouble. Maybe it was just some kids partying way too hard. That’s what I thought until I saw the black smoke creeping from the top of the tree line over three miles into the woods behind my property. 



Now, I am not a superstitious person. I am very imaginative though. And if I were to tell you I didn’t think for at least a second that some craft carrying little green men may be nearby and I could be the first one to make contact, that would be a lie. I didn’t believe it. Otherwise I would never have gone. I guess I’m one of those idiots in a horror movie you can’t help but scream at from the comfort of your lazy boy chair. 



So there I was, approaching whatever it may be. It’s a good thing I left when I did, since very quickly the smoke started to dissipate. I made sure to mark my way through and utilize the navigation skills I’ve acquired just from living in this area. Sure it was a tad farther than I was used to, but I could easily find my way back to familiarity. 



There it was after a couple hours of hiking. Disappointment slightly set in as I noticed there weren’t any chunks of any spaceship scattered about. That being said, there also weren’t any kids or anyone in trouble. But there was a crater. Less than one hundred feet in front of me. I hesitated. Then stepped. And stepped. Breathed. And stepped. The smoke was practically gone now. I had to see what was in the crater. A corpse of a small deer laid next to the hole. Poor thing. Its instincts didn’t help is this time. Not when a strike from the stars themselves come unexpected. 



Originally, I didn’t think much of the deer. Just a sad creature who wasn’t fast enough. As I got closer though, it made the hairs on my arm stand on end. The eyes were white and veiny, rolled back into its skull. The cheeks were sunken in. Flesh hung loosely from its face, chest, legs, pretty much every aspect. No blood. It’s almost as if it had undergone some rapid decomposition, or something. I wasn’t sure. It was fucked to put it bluntly. My motivation remained, so my eyes drifted from this ugly sight to the crater itself.



Like I said there was no wreckage, no alien tech, no little green men. Hesitantly, I peered over the edge of this hole behind my property that was at least a few feet deep. The crater was a circular hole, so I don’t think I could be blamed for making those kinds of assumptions. I looked in. Nothing. There wasn’t anything. Just a bundle of rock in the center. That was still cool I suppose. A meteor had come from outer space and landed in the woods near my home. I had heard of things like this. Usually they land in the ocean or some nowhere land, but here it was in the woods. “I guess I’m lucky,” I jokingly said to the deer carcass just feet from me. That’s when I saw it.



Movement. The deer’s head was moving. Just kind of shaking around a bit. Like it was being jostled by some invisible force. I took one step back. I should have ran. Dead-sprinted to my house, locked my doors, hid in the bathroom and called for help. I was so naive. I was downright stupid. Start screaming from that chair any time now. The movement traveled from the head in general to those horrible sunken cheeks. Another step back. Great. I was a whole three feet from this instead of two. The flesh peeked out from the mouth. A redish-pink, tendril, tentacle, I don’t know, *thing*. Slipping out from the corpse. It was small. But then there was another. And another. It grasped the rotted face and pulled itself free. A mass of these fleshy pink things curled like some sort of messed up yarn ball. The last tendril pulled free from the mouth with a slosh of meat. 



This bundle of flesh and wiry tentacles was constantly moving and rolling on itself. Nothing animal or human for me to latch onto didn’t prevent me from feeling like it was watching me. This mass, leaving me frozen from terror, began a secretion. From the tips of each of its flowing tendrils a mucus-like substance began to run down each appendage, coating it in God knows what. Does God even know of this creature? Or was this from the depths of Hell? I screamed. I tore my throat as I screamed and began to turn to run away. It wouldn’t let me. 



With whip-like ferocity, a bundle of those fleshy strings lashed out and grasped my ankle, taking me to the dirt. I tried to crawl, to grab the grass and roots in front of me to pull me any amount of distance away from this thing. Even with its size being less than a foot when all bundled up, it had strength. Enough to keep me in place as I cried and screamed and begged. But this wasn’t human. It wasn’t earthly. The universe doesn’t care for the calls of some wild animal. That’s what I was, to the universe and to this thing latched to me. I was just the deer who wasn’t fast enough to get away. I turned my head to see what was happening.



With its grip not lessening, it pulled itself up my leg. “Please, God, please anyone, please fucking help me.” I called to this thing or anything that listened. I couldn’t think. Just cry. It crawled and sloshed as it did. The thing from another world made its way up to my back, then stopped. For mere moments I was confused. Hopeful. Did it listen to my pleas? No. It was pulling up my shirt. I couldn’t turn my head too far around to get a full picture of what it was up to, but I saw enough. It wrapped several of it appendages together and fashioned some sort of point. The bundle raised, and stopped for a second. I breathed one more breath, then it plunged. Into my tailbone. The ripping. The pain. But worst of all, the sound. I could hear it worm its way into my skin. The bone crunched a bit. I squealed. I was the meat. I was the flesh. And it couldn’t have been happier. 



My vision faded. Even with unconsciousness taking me, the sounds continued. Sinew and tendon and bone snapping and accommodating its new visitor. The thing was burrowing in me. In my back, going into my spine. No thoughts came. I just moved out of instinct once the sounds had stopped. My vision faded in and out. Flashes of trees passing by. It was dark now. Stars spinning around my head. Home. I wanted to go home. Take me there body. Do this one last thing for me. Blackness.



I woke up in a massive cold sweat. Screams filled my bedroom as I remembered the sounds of invasion. I looked around. Blinked a few times. Then laughed. I laughed harder than I ever had before. A dream! Of course it was a dream. I told you I can be an imaginative person. This is beyond the norm for me but still, just a dream. I had to piss.



I wiped the sweat from my forehead as I looked into the bathroom mirror. “What the hell is my problem”, I said out loud to no one. I slapped my face in between both my hands after a splash of cold water. I went to undo my pants when it hit. Tense. I became so very tense. I straightened out, not of  a will of my own, as though my spine had been attached to some ungodly tight metal rod in its entirety. My arms outstretched. The tightness prevented any noise from leaving my lips. My mouth and eyes were wide open. I was becoming as solid as a statue. It took every ounce of strength in me to focus all my energy to one arm to lower it towards my shirt. I gripped it and let my arm return to the spot it apparently wanted to sit, lifting my shirt. I turned. I could still use my legs a bit. Or more like my feet as I had to pivot using them. I turned slowly and tensely, never taking my eyes off the mirror. My back came into view. There, at the tailbone, was a golfball sized wound. A round bit of flesh. An entry point. No blood, and the redness of meat was turning blacker by the second. It was in my spine.

“Listen, I’m not going to sugarcoat this for you, nor do I believe you would want me to.”

The doctor said this to me with a sense of utter calm, but I could tell he may have been even more shaken than I was with these heavy implications I’ve placed in his mind. My mind, however, was empty. I was in shock. By the time my nervous system had settled from being seized by an unknown entity leaving me solidified in front of my bathroom mirror, fear was an almost outdated concept. It simply was. The human persistence for survival ingrained in my DNA compelled me to get in my rusty Ford Explorer to take myself to a hospital regardless of this. 



“I think it best we start from the most obvious… affliction that you face.” His eyes were solemn. Though this man has probably faced more than two decades of death, disease and corruption, I don’t believe I could have imagined him looking any sadder than he was in this moment. He had been holding a manila folder at his side, which he hesitantly held up and pulled a sheet from that he proceeded to hand me. 



“This is your X-ray.” His tone never shifted from flatness. I looked down, each second that passed felt like an ocean, drowning me and dragging me to fathoms unreachable. Glancing it over was as plain as he made it out to be. Like a vine grown out of control, this *thing* was encasing my spine. It reached so far it looked like it could tickle my brain stem.



“We can’t remove it. This creature has wrapped itself around each and every one of your vertebrae. Essentially, to remove it we would have to remove your spine itself. It would kill you.” All I could do was lightly nod and hand it back to him. I had nothing to say. I just wanted to listen. 



“Now this next part may seem less obvious, but it will make itself very apparent very quickly.” His tone was more rigid. “Your labs came back. We ran your blood, and checked around this entry point in your tailbone. This *secretion* as you called, we think we have a bit of an idea what it was. There were trace amounts of the substance around that wound.”



“The results can’t be fully understood, but from what we can tell… its basis is salivary amylase. It’s spit. The beginning process for digestion in most creatures on our planet.” Without realizing it, my eyes had begun to well up. Droplets rained to my hand. I continued to listen. “Your blood is what concerns us the most. You have massive amounts of proteases, to the point that your blood cells are being invaded and broken down. Your tissue is being converted into amino acids.” He stopped for a moment before finishing. That broken man’s eyes never left me once. I was one with this creature now, and his look reminded me of when I had first seen those tendrils of flesh creeping out from that carcass. 



“You’re being digested from the inside out.” The words were cold and heavy, pulling me deeper into the trenches of this ocean called time. “And I’m sorry, but security has been called. You won’t be leaving. Please just stay calm and  stay pu-“, it was unfortunate he didn’t have time to finish before I grabbed the steel pan off the counter to my left and slammed it into his face, knocking him cold. I’m sure they called the authorities. I had much less than a minute before security finally came. There was no way I was spending my last moments alive in some lab being dissected *and* digested. I picked up a chair from across the room and threw it into the exam room window. Thank God the urgent care was on the first floor. As it shattered, I leapt through, lightly cutting my right cheek as I passed. More running. Straight to that rusty piece of shit Explorer. But it was the most beautiful piece of shit to me right in this moment, broken gas gauge, rust-covered underbelly and all. 



That drive was going to take me at least half an hour but I had to get home. If I was going to die it would be there. Away from people. Maybe this time it was actually partially for their sake too. The highway was just off of the main road, so it didn’t take long to merge and start cruising. My face was kind of itchy from the cut but there wasn’t much pain. I brought my finger up and scratched around that spot. As I brought my finger down to get my hand back to the steering wheel, a chunk of something flung to the windshield and stuck. 



This black chunk slowly slid down to the dash. I looked in confusion, until my eyes raised to the rearview mirror. My cheek. It was gone. You could see my back teeth. An entire section of the side of my face was gone. I could see the blackness of my rotting gum line that barely held onto my skeletal teeth showing through the lack of a face. I looked into my own eyes. The top of my nose ridge had a black crack. My nose started to peel from my face, the weight of that big son of a bitch pulling it down, making it hang by the thread of my septum. 



My grip on the steering wheel was white hot. I pressed the gas. And pressed it. No amount of speed was going to get me home fast enough. After what felt like a full odyssey, the dirt road leading back to my property came into view. I reluctantly slowed down so I didn’t spin out on the turn and kill myself even faster. Both my knuckles were white hot, until the turn. Suddenly my left arm was completely loose. It slid off the wheel and went down. I looked at the wheel before checking the status of my arm. A hand print, black on the backside was wrapped around the wheel. My skin had just peeled away, leaving the remnants in that grip eternally. It was time to check the arm.



Only horror was present there. The flesh of my arm was peeling from the gravity and pouring out of my long sleeve like a disgusting blackened fall-off-the-bone meat. The sound as it poured and splattered leaving nothing but a skeletal arm and hand was enough to make me retch. I should consider myself lucky I didn’t feel too much pain, but my body was breaking down before my eyes with each second that passed. I was conscious of it all. 



I pulled into my driveway for the last time. On the walk up to the front door, my left foot sloughed off along with my shoe, but I was determined to keep going. So this is where I am now. I’m home. Sitting in my living room, just thankful I still have one good hand to type this with. This is the last thing I’m able to do. I just wanted someone to know. When I’m done writing this, I have a plan. I’m sitting in my favorite recliner in the middle of the room right now. I’m going to get nice and comfortable. I’ve already poured the gas on myself, the chair and the floor around me. The gas gauge never worked in that Explorer. I’ve run out of gas way too many times, so I always keep a spare gallon of fresh gas in a container in the back. Guess I can use this to save the world. That thought makes me laugh, pretending to be some hero in the end.



I’m just a coward. I can’t end things myself, I’ll need help. So when I put this phone down, I’m going to grab my zippo lighter that says “KISS ME!” on it, flip it open and light it. Eventually, my right hand will rot away. Once it does, I go up along with this whole house and the thing inside me too. I just hope they get to the fire in time before too much of the woods nearby are hurt. I always loved hiking there.
