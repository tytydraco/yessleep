I met Jordan Daniels while I was in college. We didn’t have classes together or anything, in fact, I never heard him talk about going to school at all. Not that he talked much anyway. We went to the same church. In a college town, going to church is a little bit different. When I was home, I often felt like I was one of the youngest people there. In college, it was a lot more social. Me and my friends would go, and the chapels were usually full of people our age. I’m not very religious anymore, I probably wasn’t while I was in school anyway. There were some choices I made which I knew any preacher or minister wouldn’t be happy with, much less God himself, but it was college, right? Everyone did, or at least it felt like. I’d say that was probably the other part of it, I felt like I was in a room full of hypocrites and heretics, and I was the chief among them. The same people that would get drunk and high or run off with one another at house parties into the quiet confines of someone’s bedroom, would scream the praises of Jesus on Sunday mornings during worship. I knew better than to pretend I was all holy during service, but I felt myself getting disillusioned watching everyone else do it. So why did I stay? Church provided a community, hangouts, food, and friends. Deep down, I felt like there might have been someone or something out there trying to compel me to be a “good” person, but I just didn’t know if I could give up my life as I knew it to follow it. Jordan was different though. He always seemed to go to church because he wanted to. We would invite him to our parties and get-togethers, but he’d always reply with “no thanks."



He had no interest in going out to lunch, watching a movie, or even riding to church together. No one had ever been to his house, or apartment, no one really knew anything about his personal life. He would always be the first one at church, quietly sitting and listening to the silence, and my friends and I would always group around where he sat. Always quiet during the service, but he loved hanging around us when it was over. He would laugh and add a comment here or there, but would head home every time we would offer to take him to go out. He never shared anything about his personal life, he was simply just our church buddy. It seemed as though he didn’t exist outside of church, vanishing from everybody’s lives until the next Sunday rolled around.



So you can fully understand what happened to Jordan, I have to go back to a few weeks before he disappeared. I was laying on a bed, my head was pounding from the night before.



“Come on, Laura! We’re going to be late!” my boyfriend Landon called from the other room.



I groaned and rolled on my side, pulling the blankets over my head.



“I can’t, I’m sick.”



“Come on get up! You need to go church after last night.” His voice sounded closer.



I sat up and found him with my eyes. He was peeking around my doorframe, buttoning up a Hawaiian shirt. “Shut up,” I said. “You’re the one dressed like a party animal.” He looked down at his shirt and frowned.



“This? This is nice.”



“Well I don’t have any clothes to wear.” I said, pulling the blankets up over my head again. “And no time to do my hair.”



Landon came over to the bed and pulled the blankets off.



“Hey!” I yelled



“Come on!” he yelled back. I grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him onto the bed. We rolled for a second giggling until he was leaning over top of me. He kissed me and said almost in a whisper, “Or, maybe I can just stay here with you.”



“You can do whatever you want, *I* have to go to church,” I said, sliding around him and off the bed, he stayed there on all fours and I smacked his butt.



“Hey!” he called, falling on his face.



“Whose place is this anyway, I need something to wear.”



“Jessica’s, she said we can use anything in the closet in this room and the one across the hall.”



I opened the door he motioned to and found myself in a walk-in closet. “I wish I was this rich,” I said, eliciting a chuckle from Landon. I found a plain blue dress that seemed appropriate and quickly put it on. I walked into the bathroom and found a brush by the sink. I tried to brush out a few knots in the mess that was my hair. Landon came in a minute later and ran some water through his hair to mat it down. He was wearing the aforementioned Hawaiian shirt, khaki shorts and loafers. I snorted when I saw him. “You look like you are going to the country club,” I said.



“Did you really expect Darren to have anything nice to wear?” Darren was Jessica’s boyfriend. They didn’t go to church with us ever, but they let us use their house and stuff from time to time. I usually had something to wear when we had a party on Saturday night, but it slipped my mind last night.



We rushed out the door after getting ready and sped to the church building. They were singing a hymn when we showed up, and we scooted into the pew with everyone else. I sat right next to Jordan who smiled at me. I grabbed the hymnal and mouthed the words while I looked around the room. It looked like around 15 of the people at church today had been at the party last night. Small things started coming back to me. I saw Claire Richards who brought the alcohol and got completely wasted. Terry Arnold and Trisha Davis were sitting close to the front, we had to push into a private room after they made out for five minutes on the couch. David Kerry was looking down with his knee bouncing. Last night he did a line of coke and was racing cars in the street. And then there was Daniela George who I saw with tears running down her eyes to the right of me. She got so drunk last night she stripped naked and ran into the pool behind the house.



I must have zoned out because when I snapped away from my guilt or judge trip, they were in the middle of a prayer. I hastily shut my eyes and pretended to listen. Next, they handed out the body and blood of Christ. I sat there with my little cup of grape juice, reassuring myself it didn’t mean anything before swallowing it down. The pastor, David Slipps started his sermon, and I could feel my attention slipping. I pulled out my phone and opened up Instagram when I felt someone was looking at me. I looked up and Jordan’s eyes were on my phone. He looked up at me. His dark blue eyes seemed to pierce right through my head like he was reading something deep inside my soul. I put my phone down and hunched over in my seat. I didn’t understand it, but I always felt like I didn’t want to disappoint Jordan. In that moment though, I realized I had never seen him disappointed. 



The sermon concluded and the congregation clapped and shouted amen. Pastor Slipps waited for everyone to die down then made an announcement.



“I love our college students here at this church. You all are a light and life to our congregation. I commend you all, you could be out doing anything else, but you are here; not many people your age would be. My wife and I would like to invite you all to a very special activity. I have a cabin up in the mountains and we would love for you all to come for a kind of winter campout or sleepover.”



I perked up. Pastor Slipps was very well off, and I was sure his cabin reflected that. Whatever this event was, Slipps was going to go all out for it.



“We’re going to make a huge dinner, play some games, maybe even rent some snow sport equipment. Plan for next Friday, and keep your ears open for more details as they come out.”



There was an audible buzz among my friends as the band started to play. Events like these reminded me why I still came to church. After the service ended, we met up in the hallway to talk about the event. 



“What do you think we’re going to eat?”



“How big do you think the house is?”



“You should ride up with me!”



Amongst the excited conversations, Jordan stood to the side not saying a word. 



“Jordan, are you coming?” Landon asked.



Everyone got quiet as we waited for his response. 



“Y-Yeah. I think I will this time.”



Everyone cheered and Jordan cracked a smile. I smiled back at him. *He was a good guy* I thought. I hoped we would be able to get to know him more at this activity. 



After the service, some of the older ladies at the church had brought some food to share so we went over and ate with some of the others in our group. After a while, people started to trickle out and the church was almost empty. From our group, it was just Jordan, Landon, and I still there. It was getting late so I suggested we head back.



“So what are these activities like? I’ve never been to one.” Jordan asked as we made our way through the halls.



“It’s always a great time. There’s games, music, really good food. Slipps doesn’t skimp out ever.” Landon responded.



“We’re really happy you’re coming, Jordan. We always feel so good when you’re around and things aren’t the same when you’re not.” I chimed in. 



We were close to the door when Jordan stopped. “Can I share something with you guys?” he asked.



“Yeah of course,” I responded.



“I feel really happy with you guys, I really do. I’m glad all of our friends come to church, but I’m worried not a lot of them take this as seriously as it really is. It just feels like so many people here aren’t going for the right reasons.”



I felt myself getting hot in the face. I knew he couldn’t have known what happened the night before, but for some reason it felt like he did.



“I guess it isn’t any of my business, but have you ever wondered like how much sin is Jesus actually okay with? I know it’s unconditional and if you accept him, you’re saved, but like, I know there are some of our friends who don’t follow the Bible at all, and they still show up every Sunday and claim to be saved.”



“You know, I think Jesus knows the hearts of people though, right? He understands we have weaknesses and he also knows some people have no intention of following him but claim to anyway.” Landon tried to reassure.



“Yeah I guess so. I suppose I’m just worried. I feel like some of our friends are in that second group. What if I don’t see them in Heaven?”



I felt as if God himself had placed me in front of the judgement bar and was scrutinizing my current life. Before anyone could answer, the door to our left mercifully swung open and Pastor Slipps stepped out. 



“Oh hey you three. Planning to come to the cabin next week?”



We all nodded and the pastor grinned.



“Good, good! Jordan, would you like to meet with me today?”



“Y-yes of course Pastor Slipps. Bye Landon, bye Laura.”



We smiled as he walked behind the pastor into the office. I caught his gaze as he closed the door. He seemed, sad. There was something definitely bothering him. 



I was mostly silent on the ride back. I hated feeling this way, but I knew Jordan had kind intentions and he was actually worried about our salvation or something. Did I believe in salvation? Did I really care about this at all? Sometimes I wonder if I decided to push out all these feelings because it was easier to not worry about it instead of being driven by guilt my whole life. 



“That Jordan really thinks a lot huh?” Landon’s question broke the silence and snapped me out of my thoughts.



“Oh. Uh yeah.” I stammered back. “Landon? Why do you go to church?”



He shrugged, “Honestly, I like being with my friends, you, the food, I don’t know. I don’t think going to church is going to save my soul or anything. I also don’t think the Bible is some all-encompassing book with all the rules though either.”



“Yeah I guess so.”



“Hey, Laura, we’re fine okay? I really like Jordan, I do, he’s just a little extreme. I don’t think he realizes not everyone goes to church just for God.”



I nodded. I was feeling a little better, but Jordan’s words still rang in my ear and would hit me randomly over the next couple of days. I heard his words one day in class, once just watching TV, and of course, in bed with Landon. He didn’t seem to care or notice, I wished I could just be like him. I tried to rationalize myself or tell myself I was doing fine but it felt like I could never get these thoughts out of my head. 



Before I knew it, it was time for the party at the cabin.



Landon and I rode up with Terry Arnold in his Jeep. The cabin was up a long, winding road in the mountains and Terry was not taking his time.



“Dude please slow down.” Landon groaned.



Landon was sitting on my left, Jordan on my right, and Terry and Trisha Davis in the front seat. Terry sped up and took a sharp turn extra fast. Landon placed one hand over his mouth and the other around his stomach.



“Terry!” Trisha yelled, hitting him on the arm. Terry just laughed. 



Jordan was quiet as always. He just looked out the window and watched the lights of the day disappear behind the snow-covered mountains. 



“How are you feeling Jordan? Excited?” I asked.



Jordan looked back at me and nodded. He gave me a half smile that was not convincing. 



“It’s going to be lots of fun, don’t worry. Pastor Slipps always goes all out.”



Landon had his head in between his knees, and we made the rest of the trip in complete silence. As we continued to go up, the snow got thicker and fell in bigger flakes. Terry’s Jeep took it like a champ and he didn’t slow down at all. We got to the cabin around 7:00pm, and to my surprise, were among the first ones there. Landon jumped out and immediately keeled over with his hands over his stomach. I got out and grabbed our bags from the back. Jordan grabbed his small backpack as Terry and Trisha argued in the front seat. I watched as Jordan looked up at them, no signs of them letting up. He decided to grab their bags as well. 



“You need help?” I asked.



“No, I got it,” he said, lifting up Terry’s duffle bag. 



The weight lifting up shifted the contents under it and a slight clanking sound was heard. Jordan and I looked down and saw a 24 pack of Modelos. I rolled my eyes, I didn’t expect much different from Terry Arnold, but Jordan had a look of disbelief on his face. 



“They’ll be real nice and cold out here tonight,” Terry said, materializing behind us. Trisha angrily grabbed her bag from Jordan and marched into the house. Jordan didn’t even look at her.



Jordan swallowed, “T-Terry, what are you…”



Terry just laughed, “You don’t have to have any Jordan. I know you aren’t about that.”



Jordan just slightly nodded, never taking his eyes off the beer until Terry closed the back of the Jeep. We walked to the front door, Jordan was just looking at the ground, not saying a word. 



When we walked inside, Pastor Slipps greeted us. He told us he would take us on a mini tour of the place, so we knew where everything was if we needed anything. Shouts and cheers came from the living room as I noticed there was a football game on the TV with a few boys sitting and watching. We walked from there into the kitchen where Slipps’ wife was getting food prepared. I spied a large plate of grilled cheese sandwiches and the aroma from a few large pots of soup filled my nostrils. Past the kitchen was a hallway with a bedroom and a bathroom. 



“Unfortunately, I think the pipes have frozen over, but we have a few buckets of water to flush the toilets. Just fill it up in the back and it should all go down.” Slipps said. “But just let me know if the buckets run out, we’ll have to run down to the river to get more water.”



At the end of the hall was a staircase that curved around to the area above the kitchen and hall. There was a balcony overlooking the living room and two more bedrooms. 



“So yeah, make yourselves at home! I think someone else just pulled up so I’m going to go see if they need any help.” Slipps said, making his way back down the stairs.



“I told you, he’s loaded,” Landon said. I playfully pushed him and Terry laughed. I looked over at Jordan and he was looking off somewhere else.



“Hey Terry, where’s Trish?” I asked him.



“Wait yeah, where did she go?” he pondered. “Trish!” he yelled over the balcony. There was no response. “I’m gonna go look for her,” he said, heading back to the staircase.



“Landon, why don’t you go with him?” I half-asked half-told.



“Nah he’s got it,” he responded.



I snuck another look at Jordan who had walked over to the corner of the balcony, slouched over and looking at the floor. I made eye contact with Landon and pointed with my eyes over to Jordan.



“Oh!” he realized then walked down the staircase as well.



I walked over to Jordan. “Hey Jordan, are you feeling alright?” I asked.



He just shrugged.



“Was it Terry?”



He didn’t move for a few seconds before slowly nodding.



“Look, Terry’s still got a lot to figure out. It’s disappointing but you know, it isn’t our job to judge him.” The words stung my mind and heart as they came out of my mouth. 



Jordan’s eyes finally met mine. “But who was he planning to share with? Are there that many people who were planning to drink?”



I decided to play into his innocence. “That’s barely enough beer for a couple of people. I’m sure it was just for him and Trisha and like, maybe Mark Staples.” His face seemed to relax a little when we heard the door slam open. Pastor Slipps shambled in, covered in snow. 



“Hey everyone!” he called. “Derek’s arrived with a few others, but the snow’s gotten bad out there. Can we get a bunch of you to come and help push them the rest of the way? They’re stuck.” 



Jordan seemed to completely snap out of his worry and started to make his way down the stairs. I tried to catch up behind him and made my way down the hallway. As I passed one of the two bedrooms, I heard voices on the other side. My curiosity got the better of me and I slowed down to try to listen. It was certainly Terry and Trisha, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying. I placed my ear against the door, but the muffled sounds of their argument were all I could hear aside from a word here or there. I decided to keep going to help push Derek’s car out of the snow. 



The car had almost made it up to the parking area of the cabin but was stuck in the middle of the road. The emergency flashers were on and there were five or six people outside trying to push it. I found a small space in between a couple of people and pushed it along as well. After a couple of seconds, the car started to move, and we got it into the parking area next to the other cars. Everyone high-fived as Derek shut the car off. 



“I can get the bags, you all run inside and warm up.” Derek said.



“I can help,” Jordan offered.



I walked back inside with the others to the inviting, warm lights and space heaters. Landon and Terry had joined the boys watching football in the living room, and I noticed Trisha in the back corner talking to David French. I stomped the snow off of my boots and sat on the couch, pulling out my phone. A minute or so later Jordan and Derek came inside with their arms full of bags. They stuck them to the side with all the other ones and I noticed Jordan slipping back outside. I looked back at my phone for a while. Things started to get a little louder as the extra people added to the volume. A few minutes went by, and Mrs. Slipps announced dinner was ready. Everyone got up and hungrily made their way to the kitchen. I noticed Trisha and David stayed in their corner speaking in hushed tones. Daniela George was asked to pray for the food and I put my head down when I realized Jordan hadn’t come back. I quietly slipped away while she was praying and waited until I heard “amen” to open the door and step outside. Jordan was out in the snow looking down at something in his hands. I approached him.



“Hey Jordan, everyone is inside about to eat.”



He didn’t even look up at me. I got close enough to see what was in his hand. It was a small plastic bag with little green things inside. Marijuana.



“It dropped out of one of the bags I was bringing in. I don’t know whose.”



“Just throw it out in the woods somewhere, no need to worry about it.”



“What is happening Laura? How is this happening?”



“Jordan, I-“



“Laura, how many of our friends are going to Hell?”



“You can’t say that, Jordan! That’s not your decision to make!” I blurted out. 



“Laura are you…” He trailed off and put the little bag in his pocket. “Why are you defending them, Laura?”



“They’re our friends Jordan.”



“They are going to make others sin too. I need to talk to Pastor Slipps.”



“Jordan, just leave them alone. We don’t know who or why…”



“Laura.” Jordan’s face was staring daggers into my soul. His demeanor had completely changed from the happy, quiet, and concerned kid I knew him to be. “I need to talk to Pastor Slipps.”



His gaze would not leave mine. He was staring right into and through my eyes, not blinking. I swallowed. 



“O-okay Jordan. I’m going to go inside. Y-you do whatever you need to do.”



He didn’t move. I turned around and half ran to the door of the cabin. I went inside and pushed past everyone who was milling around the kitchen and ran up the stairs to the balcony. I ran into one of the bedrooms and looked out the window into the front yard. Jordan had moved. He was standing on the porch now, barely illuminated by the light outside the cabin. From inside the house, I heard a door shut. My heart started pounding as I watched two figures running around the side of the building with their hands enclosed. One of them was holding one of the water buckets Slipps had told us about. I watched as they ran out to the river, placed it on the ground, then ran to one of the cars and got in. I looked back at Jordan, his position had turned to face them and the car. 



I ran back down the stairs; I didn’t have a lot of time, but I needed to figure out who was outside in the car. I don’t know what had come over Jordan but he was freaking me out. I ran into Landon in the kitchen. He was holding a large bowl of soup and a plate with four or five grilled cheese sandwiches.



“Landon, did you see who went outside?”



“Hey, where’ve you been? Are you hungry? I’ll share.”



“Landon I’m serious! Did you see who left?”



“Uh I don’t know?”



“Anyone that you haven’t seen get food?” His face looked a little annoyed and embarrassed. “Landon please!”



“Uh maybe Trisha? Terry’s been over there watching the football game without her for a while now.”



Trisha, of course. She and David were talking in the corner earlier, but I could see they weren’t there now. I ran past him and threw the door open. I crossed the porch and started to run across the snow that hadn’t stopped falling since we had gotten there. As I got closer, I noticed a figure walking toward me. I stopped running. The figure wasn’t walking slowly. Jordan was 10 feet in front of me at this point. 



“Jordan, what are you doing?”



He didn’t answer. I stepped out of his way because he wasn’t moving out of mine. I watched him march into the cabin, leaving the door wide open behind him before he disappeared into the crowd. I stood there unsure of what I should do when I heard someone running up behind me.



“Where is Jordan!?” David yelled behind me.



“He went inside, don’t mess with him David.”



“I need you to go check on Trish,” he said.



“David, please, I don’t know what’s going on with him.” I spotted Landon peering confused through the wide open door. “Landon is right there, please go talk to him and we can figure out what’s going on with Jordan.”



I saw his tension ease a little and he walked up toward the door. I pointed at him so Landon could see, he nodded and closed the door behind David who was just then walking inside. I was torn. I wanted to see what was going on with Jordan, but I had to admit I was a little afraid. David had asked me to check on Trisha. Had Jordan done something to her?



I walked down to the car they had been in, illuminating my path with the flashlight on my phone. When I got to the car I felt the crunch of something under my boots. Glass. I walked up to the window and heard someone sobbing.



“Trish?” I called. I shined my light into the broken window of the car. Trish was lying in the backseat, covered in cuts and broken glass. Her makeup was running down her cheeks.



“Trish! Oh my- what did he do?”



“That freak!” she screamed. “David and I were here. We were talking, just talking! Nothing had happened! I-I didn’t see him. He rose up behind the window, David screamed, he smashed it. He-he grabbed my throat and yelled ‘I’m sending you to Hell, whore!’”



She broke down in a puddle of tears. 



“Trish. I-I’m so sorry. I don’t know what’s going on with him. Let’s get you back inside and cleaned up. The cold is not going to help your injuries.”



Trisha continued, not acknowledging what I had just said. “David just sat there!” she screamed. “He didn’t even try to help me! Oh Terry I’m sorry, I’m so so sorry.”



She continued to sob.



“I struggled and punched and kicked. I got him to let go of my neck and then he just stopped and walked away!”



I noticed Trisha’s cross necklace on the seat. The chain must have been snapped in the struggle. Had it come off while he had his hands on her?



“Trish, we need to get you safe. Please come with me, I’ll help carry you up.”



Finally, she stifled her cries and allowed me to help her out of the car. We walked up to the cabin, her arm over my shoulder as she leaned on me for support, she winced with every step. Her neck was different shades of red and purple. We slowly made our way up to the cabin, every step an agony for her. I started to yell.



“Hello! Please come help us!”



Trish chimed in “Help me, please!”



The door flew open, and I saw Terry standing in the doorway. He caught one sight of Trisha and came running down to her. I transferred Trisha into his arms and ran up into the house where a curious and frightened crowd had formed around the doorway.



“Landon!” I called as he separated himself from the crowd. “Where’s Jordan? And David?”



“David came up to talk to me but fell into a helpless pile. It was an ugly sight. I couldn’t do anything, and he locked himself in the bathroom. Laura, what is going on?”



“I can’t explain right now, where did Jordan go?”



“He kept mumbling that he needed to talk to Slipps. He didn’t talk to anyone, didn’t even blink. It really freaked us out.” Landon paused, “What happened to him?”



“Where are they, Landon!?”



“They’re in one of the upstairs bedrooms.”



I ran past the crowd and up the stairs. Halfway up I already heard the sound of raised voices. As I approached the right-side bedroom, I could make out more of what they were saying.



“Pastor, they were! I saw it with my own eyes!”



There was a response, but I couldn’t make it out.



“And the drugs, and the beer! It’s a church full of charlatans!”



The noise from downstairs began to quiet as the others began to hear Jordan. 



“You are the worst of them! You allow this to happen, you spit in the face of God! The Devil will torture you himself!”



There was a crash behind the door, and it sounded like something hit the floor hard.



“Help!” I screamed. 



Terry was already halfway up the stairs with Landon close behind him. They burst open the door to find Jordan on top of Pastor Slipps, his hands around his throat. Slipps’ face was a dark, unnatural red and blood was trickling from his temple. Terry and Landon got on both sides of Jordan and grabbed his arms. He thrashed and fought, landing a few blows on both of the boys. By this point, most of the group in the cabin had made their way upstairs. Two more from the crowd entered the room to try to corral Jordan who was beginning to break free from the grip of Terry and Landon. The other two grabbed his legs and held him so he could no longer move. Jordan didn’t relax. He used every muscle in his body to try to break free from the grip. Then something happened, and to this day, I still have trouble believing it. Jordan’s neck seemed to extend off his body. It grew a few inches and then a foot, twisting to the left of where Terry was holding his arm. Terry looked up in horror at the crazed face of Jordan, his piercing eyes seemed to have grown bigger on his face and their deep blue burned like a chemical fire. He opened his mouth wider than humanly possible and collapsed a row of thin razor-sharp teeth onto Terry’s hand. Terry howled and let go of Jordan’s arm while Jordan’s head writhed and dug deeper into the hand before releasing. The other three boys let go and stepped back. Jordan’s head locked eyes with mine while his body twisted to accommodate the position of it and place it back normally on his body. 



I had been standing there completely frozen. I saw his feet begin to move from the back of the bedroom straight toward me. Before he could even make it through the room, he immediately slipped on a small puddle of blood that had been collecting next to the still wheezing Pastor Slipps. He lost his balance and his head violently fell forward and hit a bedpost, sending him crumpling to the floor.



Everyone just stood there for a few seconds in silence. Still trying to process what had just happened. Mrs. Slipps rushed over to the pastor who was starting to regain his breath a little. 



“I need some gauze! A bandage, something!” 



Her comment seemed to snap a bunch of people out of their daze. 



“I’m on it,” someone said.



“We need to call the police.”



“I’ll find something to tie him up in case he gets up.”



The crowd began to stir and disperse. I backed up against the wall, breathing heavily. He had looked right at me. He was coming for me next. I watched from my spot on the wall for what felt like a minute or two, but it must have been at least an hour. Landon came up a couple of times to check on me, but I couldn’t move, I couldn’t speak. I had been seconds from death and I knew it.



It had been snowing so bad that the police couldn’t make it up to the cabin until at least morning. The roads were completely covered apparently and they’d have to get snowplows up there that were working on the bigger highways and residential areas. They found some rope in a shed outside and hogtied Jordan. They kept him in the bedroom where he had attacked Slipps and locked the door, stacking as much furniture in front of it as they could find. Around this time, I seemed to collect myself a little bit and went back downstairs. Around 11:00 pm, Jordan must have come to.



Violent bangs and loud wails came from the upstairs bedroom. It only sounded like the restraints held him for about fifteen minutes because he started to pound on the door with what sounded like superhuman strength. To our relief, the door lock held, and he didn’t get out. At about 1:00am, the banging and screaming just suddenly stopped. A couple of people went up to check on the balcony and there were no signs he had gotten out. The collected relief that you could feel between everyone was tangible. We finally began to relax until the pastor, who had been resting in the downstairs bedroom, burst into the living room.



“The window! Did he get out the window?”



There was a collective rush outside to look into the upstairs window. The snow was nearly calf-deep at this point. They had put some furniture in front of it and tried to board it up while Jordan was knocked out, but it was harder to completely block it off like the door. From the outside looking up, the window had become unblocked, and the silhouette of Jordan could be seen from the window looking down at us. He didn’t yell, or bang, or break the glass. He just stood there. We debated for a little bit but decided he must not be trying to get out through the window because the fall would be too great. It was a couple of stories, so at best he would break something from the fall. We went back inside and weighed our options. We couldn’t get off the mountain now because of the snow, we were going to have to spend the night with him upstairs. We barricaded every exit in the house in case he got out through the window and tried to get back into the cabin. Everyone found a space in the house to camp out while Slipps and his wife got the bedroom on the first floor. Nobody wanted to even try the balcony or the second bedroom on the second floor. Most of us, including myself, ended up on the floor or couches in the living room. I didn’t think I would be able to sleep, but I laid down on my spot on the floor and felt exhaustion take me.



I wasn’t sure how long I had been asleep, but I woke up to a cold chill running through my body. It was freezing in the cabin. I looked in front of me, the fireplace was still burning, and the front door was closed and barricaded. I got up and started to walk around. Everyone was asleep, it looked like nothing had been disturbed. I walked down the hallway, and paused outside of Slipps’ room. The cold was clearly coming from here, I felt it from underneath the doorway. I knocked.



“Pastor Slipps?” I called. No response. I noticed a couple of others begin to get up as well.



I turned the door handle and opened the door. The window of the bedroom was wide open and all the furniture used to blockade it was neatly pushed aside. A fresh blanket of snow covered the floor underneath. The pastor and his wife were nowhere to be seen. I walked closer to the window and saw Mrs. Slipps face down in the snow. There was no sign of anyone else.



“Landon!” I yelled as I backed up away from the window. “Anyone!”



A couple of people showed up outside the room and came in to see what had happened. Somebody screamed and panic began to set in among everyone. Someone called the police who said they would be there as soon as they could, but it would still be an hour or so with all the snow that had fallen. All we could do was sit and wait. 



Nobody dared leave the cabin until a loud scraping sound was heard outside. A large snowplow barreled its way up the hill followed by two police trucks. We all worked together to remove the barricade over the front door and  crowded around the entrance as they pulled in. The police spent a lot of time asking people questions. One officer brought a dog and she went with a group of officers to check out Mrs. Slipps’ body. I later saw them heading toward the woods and the river behind the cabin. Their search ended up being futile as there was no sign of Pastor Slipps or Jordan. They were gone, completely vanished, not even leaving behind a footprint. As soon as the police let us, we all made our ways back down the mountain and back home.



The ensuing weeks and months were overall numbing. I made a few trips down to the police station to answer questions but nothing came of the search and case. There were no identifying materials for who Jordan was. No one had ever been to his house, met any of his family, or knew anything about him outside of church. With the pastor and his wife gone, the church shut down and lay abandoned for a couple of years. Last I heard, it was bought by a commercial developer who bulldozed the lot and turned it into a Burger King. Landon and I ended up breaking up. He tried, but I just couldn’t continue after what had happened that night. I needed to forget everything that happened, including Landon. I had decided I would finish my degree and start completely over somewhere else. After I graduated, I moved out to Virginia and took a boring corporate job to kind of restart things. Things have been fine, but I’m thinking about moving again. Somewhere where it doesn’t snow at least. We don’t get a lot of snow out here where I live, but every year we do get a little bit in the winter, and every time it does snow I wake up to my bedroom window open.
