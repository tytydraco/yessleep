To introduce myself a little, I am an expat university student in Switzerland and I just got accepted there for a scholarship 3 months ago. I am studying in phycology and I just finished the first half of this scholar year.

As for the vacation we got, I didn't really have anything to do and so I opened up my computer and checked the university's private chat AKA it didn't have teachers. As I chatted some people brought it up that some colleagues are organizing a holiday trip to the woods in a log cabin.

At the time I taught it was a great idea since a cabin in the woods to relax close to a waterfall was almost a dream come true to relax after I worked so hard. I got the information sent to me in a private chat and so I decided to join them.

I packed up my things for the 2 weeks we would be spending there, locked the door and headed to the meeting place where the host wanted to meet up and take us in his mini van. We got to the place in two long hours and I met all the people there. for privacy reasons I will call the lady with short red hair M, the hosts I will continue calling host 1 and 2, my best friend R and group 2 of 3 other people who just keep to themselves.

As we arrived we were divided into rooms, a room for me, R and M, a room for the 2 hosts and one more room for group 2. I just unpacked while M was reading a book since she finished unpacking rather quickly. After I finished we (me, R and M)  went out of the cabin for some fresh air.

It was already dark but I didn't mind since I had a lantern on me and I usually took walks in the night back at apartment. As time went by we were walking back and we noticed something pale and humanoid in the woods, I assumed it's one of the owners that came to look for us so I waved at it.

It wasn't an owner I realized as I got closer that the proportions were off and the face looked unsettling, Like something that tried to look human but failed on a level that made me freeze as it started to mimic R's voice and phrases. After I managed to unfreeze myself we all ran back to the cabin to inform the others.

after explaining the hosts they rolled their eyes in annoyance and responded with "wow you still believe in ghost stories? It's night your mind just probably made it up" But I was sure it was real, when I got closer I know it was real because nothing made my heart sink like that.

I went to sleep with or door locked because I was pretty startled and I was jumping at every minor move, I couldn't sleep that night because I could hear it outside copying my breathing motions, it followed us back.

I "woke up" at 5 am and just made my morning coffee, I just knew I couldn't let anyone out, I saw it hide behind a tree in the distance waiting for something. As everyone started waking up host 1 woke up first and they started chatting with me.

"I know that thing you were talking about, I also tried telling the others in the last trip but only I saw it and they never believed me."

"Why would you come back here if you know about it too?" I said with a genuine confusion

"It would follow me back to the city, I had to pass on the vision to be free sorry."

Those apologies didn't even feel like apologies just like reasoning to doom me to that same fate, I lost all my words and stayed quiet all morning. I dragged R into our room and explained the whole thing to her. She looked shocked but sad at the same time "I saw it too". I realized the hosts both saw it and just brought us here to take over the sight.

Ever with my burning anger I managed to calm myself and tell the others that the thing was outside waiting, it was too late someone went outside already to collect water. 30 minutes passed, then 1 hour passed, then 2 hours, 3 hours. We all silently agreed that we wouldn't see the person in group 2 again.

When I was about to lock the door again, The person in group 2 suddenly returned and opened the door. They said a sentence that honestly didn't make sense it just seemed like a keyboard smash but in the human version.

Group 2 was overjoyed but me, R and the hosts knew what was happening, I couldn't forget that blank stare. A week and a half passed and nothing very weird happened except sometimes waking up to the person in group 2 staring at me a lot. I never saw them sleep or anything either, it was really creeping me and the others out.

Tonight I woke up at around 4 am to a loud white noise playing, when I opened the door the "person" was sitting down on the cabin's couch with the window open while making the white noise. It turned around and once it noticed me it jumped on me trying to push my eyeballs in but I had my flashlight on me and I hit it as hard as I could over the head.

As dark red blood spilled out of their head, some white substance also started to ooze from their wound. As I inspected more I noticed a big cut at the back of their head going all the way down to the bottom of their spinal cord. I knew it wasn't stunned forever so I called my friends. I noticed everyone disappeared except me, R and the hosts. We all sprinted to the car and got back to the city safely.

I went out of contact with the hosts even though I still see them at university like nothing happened, I called the police and informed them of the disappearance of the others. The police sent out an investigation at the cabin but nothing was found. I kept seeing it in my every day life, I passed my first year of university, the winter break is approaching again and we are hosting another vacation at the camp. I'm sorry but I can't stand their cries for help that it mimics every time I try to sleep.
