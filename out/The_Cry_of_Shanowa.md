For as long as man has existed upon the earth, he has battled the forces of nature as much as those around him. The fight for survival has always been beyond that of sticks and stones. No matter how sharp a stick can get or how fast a rock can fly, no skill defeats that of the predators that make up the food chain. We thought we had defeated the food chain, but that couldn’t have been further from the truth.



When I received the call about my father’s death, I was unsurprised. He had spent his days drinking and regretting. I assumed his liver had given out or he had taken an ill advised road trip that hopefully didn’t cause any undue suffering for anyone but himself. I would almost say I was happy. Ever since the loss of the rest of my family, I had felt alone knowing that the only tie I had to my heritage was isolating himself in a 6 inch glass and an old recliner. Now I was truly free. There was no more regret, no stains on my family tree. Just me and what the lawyer needed to discuss in person. I informed work of a sabbatical and booked a ticket back to what was once home.



Sitting in the meager office across from an individual in a cheap suit, I realized there would be no money. He confirmed the same. My father had spent every dime that he had. What he spent it on was the most confusing. We weren’t a well off family. Growing up, I remembered nights of hunger and cold. The type of hunger that couldn’t be quelled with a box of Hamburger Helper split between five and the type of cold that no kerosene heater low on fuel can warm. When I left for the coast, I swore to never put myself in that situation again. I only wish I could’ve saved my siblings from the fate that I escaped. When I saw the story in the news, it broke me. Three people, one adult and two children under ten, were found huddled together under a worn out quilt with acute methane poisoning. At least it was easy on them and they would be warm. He lived because he was at the bar. The bar never suffered from hunger or cold, but it did suffer from loneliness. The loneliness drove him deeper until there was no escape. He filled that loneliness with a desire for legacy. If nothing else, there would be a plot of land with our name on it. 



The lawyer handed me the deed to 35 Acres in the mountains of Appalachia. My father never was one for the wild, but the wildest land is often the cheapest. This land was wild. Between a plane ride, a confused Uber, and a long walk, I came upon a small cabin reminiscent of the Kaczynski estate. Buried deep in the darkness of the Blue Ridge Forest was the perfect metaphor for my life. This dilapidated building, filled with relics of a time gone by, served as the blueprint for my new life. Out here I could return to the basics and restart. I took to cleaning and sealing my new home. 



The first night was an adjustment to say the least. There was no traffic noise. No sirens. No arguments from the family next door who swore the baby would fix their problems. It was only the noises of nature. The cicadas and animals created a symphony of sound that rivaled that of big city life. I can honestly say I hadn’t slept that great in years. That is until I was awoken by the crying. The clock read 2:45 and in some far off part of the holler there was a baby crying out for its mother. The desperation and fear in it’s tiny wails turned my stomach to knots and forced me outside. Once through the threshold, all sounds ceased. For the first time since I arrived, the woods were quiet. I looked everywhere that the safety of my porch provided a view of and sunk back inside. 



In the light of morning, I convinced myself I had dreamed the whole thing up. There wasn’t a person for miles, let alone a baby. How would it even get out here? I took the trip into town and picked up the essentials. It may not be the luxury that I had grown accustomed to, but a basic bed and food supplies gave me the comfort I needed to return that evening. I thought about questioning the shopkeep about the baby but knew he’d think I was crazy. Hell, I thought I was crazy. On the ride back to my cabin, I understood the suggestion of the gator I picked up on the terrain. No car or truck could make it up this far, not with the goat trails and backways I had to take. The UTV had everything I needed and I guess it would help me learn to maintain small engines. I had taught myself to do just about everything else I needed to survive, I could surely figure out how to turn a wrench. 



That night was more of the same. Crickets singing and a cool evening breeze put me to sleep. Much to my dismay, the baby came back. Same volume, same cadence. That poor thing continued to scream for a mother that wasn’t coming. I went outside to check, this time with a flashlight, and ventured all the way to my woodline. No matter how far I walked, the screams remained. I didn’t get closer or farther, the screams were everywhere. They were nowhere. They seemed to resonate from the very fiber of all of the gray matter crammed inside my skull cavity. At the risk of losing the rest of my night’s rest, I elected to ignore the pleas and returned to the warmth of my bed. 



As the sun broke the horizon, I rose to a cup of coffee brewed over a wood stove. Something about the work involved made it that much better. As I finished the cup I went to work. Trees needed to be cleared. The outside of my cabin needed some patchwork. Land ownership turned out to be a bigger hassle than I could have ever dreamed. The work was hard, but fulfilling. Where I could be in an office pumping out quarterly reports and spreadsheets, I was out here in the thick of it creating a place to live. Whether he had planned it or not, my father had given me the greatest gift he could’ve. He gave me a greater purpose. All of that came into question when I discovered the prints.



Underneath a pile of brush were footprints. Not bear, not coyote, but human footprints. They were smaller than my own, and my feet aren’t exactly large. They were almost childlike. I took pictures and sent them to a friend of mine from college in the hopes he would tell me it’s some animal I’m unaware of. Before I could return my phone to my pocket, I received a phone call from an unknown number. A friendly male voice answered my greeting on the other line. “This is Dr. Simmons with the paleontological department of UCLA. I have been setting up an ichnological study of the native populations in the Alleghania region and I was sent a picture that you took. Do you have a second to speak?” I agreed and we talked about the area where I found them and what led me to the discovery. He urged me to preserve the site as best as I can and that he would be in touch with further information on how I could be helpful. 



With the excitement of the day, I lost track of time in the thoughts of what treasures could be on my land. Before I knew it, the sun had set. I had never been this far from the house in the dark. I quickly realized I had no idea where I was or how to get back. A storm had followed the night and apparently took all cell service with it. This is the exact situation that the old man in town told me to pick up a satellite phone for. I didn’t have time to figure out whether or not I regretted leaving that off my shopping list before I heard it.



From somewhere deeper than my eyes could pierce, I heard a voice. “Shane.” Small, echoey, and distant. The softness in that one word drew my attention and my response. “Hello? Can I help you?” From the opposite side, I heard it again. This time closer. With every hair on my body standing on edge I stepped toward the sound when it was suddenly behind me. “SHANE.” The voice had lost all sense of familiarity. Now it was hunting. I didn’t want to hang around long enough to find out what was hunting so I took off running. I found a goat trail that had recently been trampled and followed it until my legs began to fail me. I collapsed on the trail and scanned the treeline as I caught my breath. Behind every tree was a darting shadow and every birdsong seemed to call my name. I was clearly going mad with fear, so I gathered myself and began to walk back. The rain had washed away at parts of the trail and as they crumbled beneath my feet, I was reminded of my elevation. This reminder sealed itself in my mind when I followed the soil down. After two bounces, everything went black. 



The Allegewi tell tales of man-hunters in the mountains surrounding our country's founding. Tales of hideous beasts that steal the young and escape the arrows of the warbow. My minimal education wrote these off as allegories of infant mortality and disease. What they failed to teach was the true history of the range. What we know today as the Appalachian mountains exist as one of earth’s oldest land masses. In the days of fish crawling to land, there were the mountains. When magic and mystery ruled the land in days of yore, there stood the mountains. As I careened to my ultimate demise, there stood the mountains.



When I came to, I had come to rest at the base of a tree. Between the pain in my ribs and the splitting headache, I couldn’t have hated this place more. I could be in a high rise apartment preparing for my work day tomorrow but instead I lay dying against a tree that hadn’t seen humanity in its entire life. I cursed my father for saddling me with this land. I cursed my mother for convincing me to leave home. I cursed my stupidity for having fallen. As I came to my feet, I heard a scurry through the leaves. My mind went on high alert and for a moment I forgot the remnants of my little tumble. Out of the underbrush came a rabbit. It’s pure white fur glistening against the darkness of the night. It studied me intensely and went on its way. I relaxed out of my sense of survival and returned to dealing with the pain. 



About the time that I was able to try walking, I heard it. The crying began in the same location it always does. Just out of reach the infant screamed. Tonight it seemed more desperate and shrill, but that could’ve also been the concussion. I hobbled towards the sound when everything closed in. My vision tunneled to nothing more than the tree in front of me and the drums started. Broken ribs be damned, I took off running. From every crevice in the earth came the drums. Pounding. Screaming. Closing in. I ran. I ran until the drums filled every hole in my body. I could taste the aged leather of the heads and feel the strike of the stick in my bone marrow. As the drumming seemed to engulf me, I broke through the trees. 



Just as suddenly as they had started, everything stopped. I was once again alone with the crickets and cicadas in the wet night. Up ahead, I saw the lantern I left burning the previous night. I collected all of the strength I had and made my way to it’s warm safety. As I approached the porch, what I saw stopped me more than any pain I could feel. Splayed out on the first step was that rabbit. It’s fur stained a dark crimson red and a hole where that deep black marble had been. It’s neck was turned at an angle that sent a shiver down my spine. Someone, or something, left this so that I would see it. It let me get home, it left me a message, and I couldn’t help but feel that it watched me. 



I made my way inside and finally gave in to the pain. When I woke, it was dark out. The chill of the night reminded me where I was. I sat up and was reminded of the events of the night before. I made my way to what had become my medicine cabinet and filled myself with just about everything I had that involved pain relief. After giving that time to take effect, I made my way outside. The rabbit remained on my doorstep, untouched by any of the countless scavengers that surrounded me unseen. I made my way to the UTV parked outside and it roared to life. I neglected to check the fuel levels and set on my way to town. Hopefully they had a doctor or at the very least an old man with narcotics. 



Driving down the road, if you could call it that, I felt the Ibuprofen lose the battle I sent it to unprepared. My vision blurred and the pain in my side returned as I attempted to keep the vehicle steady. When the blood pumped through the swollen mass that used to be my ribs, I instinctively folded to guard the area. This sent the gator into the ravine beneath me. It came to a rest at the bottom and I staggered out. 



At the top of the hill, where there existed the only way out of my hell, I saw something dart toward the trees. It made no noise. The leaves and fallen branches seemed to move away from it. The speed at which it moved sent me back into the fight or flight that unfortunately seemed to be all too normal. I made my way to my feet and felt a rush of wind behind me. It called my name. “Sshhaaaneeee.” It almost seemed to sing and mock me. Another rush of wind. Then my name again. It seemed to be everywhere and nowhere. The voice continued to harass me as I stumbled toward the road. It circled me. It seemed to multiply and then disappear. The entire wilderness was involved in this things plan for me. I felt the eyes of an unknown predator feeling my heart race and hone in on my new weaknesses. Just as I felt it’s hot breath on the back of my neck, my feet were ripped out from under me. I was dragged back to the bottom of the ravine and the beast drooled onto my back. I buried my face in an attempt to convince myself this wasn’t happening as I felt a claw on my shoulder. 



The uncanny valley is a concept that exists in the depths of our mind. In essence, it is the idea that we are naturally afraid of those things that aren’t quite human. This has been explained away by science as a natural defense against the disease that comes from the dead. As this beast forced me to stare into it’s eyes, I understood where that fear had begun. When writers speak of the old gods and the eldritch horrors, they are unknowingly warning us of what I experienced. Between the hazel eyes that set on either side of its maw and the elongated neck, this thing did not fit any known animal that I could place. The strength with which it supported my dead weight rivaled that of the strongest man. The extended claws that wrapped around and pierced my upper arm made it very clear the inspiration of our most primitive weapons. It’s jaw unfolded and revealed a mouth of gnarled fangs that each came to their own serrated point. It’s breath burned the hair off of my face and brought a nauseous urge to the back of my throat. As I made peace with whatever would listen and accepted my fate, a sharp snap cut through the air.



I fell to the ground and watched the beast sprint into the forest with a howl. I collapsed onto the ground and heard a familiar voice behind me. “Shane, you never told me how bad this had gotten.” I turned to put a face to the voice of Dr. Simmons and breathed a sigh of relief. The adrenaline rushed out of me and I gave in to the exhaustion that had been plaguing me since my arrival. When I woke, I was blinded by the sterility of a hospital room. In the corner sat Dr. Simmons with a laptop open. He paused his typing to look up and his eyes met mine. “Shane my boy! I could have never imagined what you were getting me into. I almost feel lied to.” He let out a chuckle. “Now you rest up and we will talk in the morning.” 



After a couple of days in the hospital, I was released to my own accord. I couldn’t stand the idea of returning to that cabin, so I checked myself into the local motel. Dr. Simmons met me at the desk and I gave him full permission to do whatever he wanted with my land and donated anything found to his studies. He shook my hand and left with the giddyness of a child given permission to swim. I retired to my room, ready to sleep before figuring out how to get rid of the curse I had been bestowed. As my eyes became heavy, the darkness overtook me. As I settled in for a long night of much needed rest, I heard the first beat of the drums in the distance.
