My room is rather plain. When people are over and peek inside the cracked door they always mention how little I have in there. A bed, a desk, my wardrobe, and a few little trinkets with a plant littered around the space.

Honestly, I never really am much for interior design so I don't mind being a minimalist.

Although my friends and family always ask about my mirror. The first time someone inquired about it, I was surprised because, well, I don't own a mirror. The only one I have is in my bathroom—but everyone would insist that I do in fact have one. It's up against the wall at the foot of my bed, they'd say. "It's hard to miss!", is another common one.

I would play along after a while, sometimes chuckling about the running joke those closest to me have, forgetting about the giant mirror, so crazy!

Sometimes when it was late and I was settled into bed, I'd try to peer into the darkness to make the frame out—pitch black nothingness would beckon back. Countless sighs in frustration would follow.

"You added a drawing to the framing?" My friend Amy called from 'round the corner. The book I have in my lap shuts with a thump, I roll my eyes as I pad over the wooden flooring of my apartment to Amy, my door wide open.

I purse my lips, "No I haven't. It's the same as always," I lie.

She gives me a look, crosses her arms, taps her foot. Her rhythm in threes of fours, like a waltz.

"Seriously. I haven't done anything to it. Why what does it look like?"

Amy glances back through the doorway, her shoulders start to tense, and as she turns her face looks crumpled.

"You really don't see the drawing?" She pushes again, "It's... honestly kind of creepy. I didn't realise you had that talent."

I weave past her into my room, no mirror that I can see. Amy squeezes past me then, a blur of motion before I could even blink and then a piece of paper is pressed right in front of my face.

...I didn't even see her grab it. Yet, there it is. A piece of flimsy paper, colours swirling about in odd directions, with no sense or reasoning. To me, it looks almost nauseating.

Her hands inch away with a snap of her wrist, turning the paper towards her, "Dude, I'm like, freaked out to be honest. You got everything right, I never even told you about this."

My heart picks up at that, "What the fuck are you talking about?" Face red and warm, I start to sway and feel light-headed.

"You drew my @h3#p, Thomas," she replied, her tone thick and scratchy. Amy looked like she was going to pass out. My throat tightened.

I never really understood what Amy said. Trust me I tried to and I asked about it several times. Amy would always dodge the question though, even after I begged. She just would get mad and say to look at my own drawing. 

It was a lost cause trying nowadays. Truthfully after that I refused to let anyone into my room—I bought a lock from Bunnings and always kept it shut tight whenever people would come over. Lest I'd have to deal with the uncomfortableness and the shock like Amy felt.

It became more and more common for friends and family to visit literally the day after my lock was hastily installed. Like everyone heard a rumour that my room had weird drawings like Amy's, and they'd insist that they didn't want to come over just because of that.

The mirror. The invisible mirror. Every single time and no matter whom it was would ask to see it. For a couple of hours, William, Mum, Amy, anyone really; they would talk about nothing in particular. Updates about their lives, we'd sometimes go out or eat in. I liked it. I encouraged anyone who walked through my apartment door to be themselves, vent about anything.

The topic would always come up—sometimes an outright question, other people were more sly about it.

"Can I see your room?" Innocently enough. At first. Maybe they wanted to see my plants, or other random excuse. I just know now it's always about that goddamn mirror. I fell for it a couple of times, and everytime it happened whatever drawings they'd come across; later on they'd look at me all funny. Despite that, they'd still beg to come over for a chat or a coffee.

I was sick of it. I wanted to smash it to pieces. See the glass litter the floor. 7 years of bad luck be damned!

I wake up with my head all fuzzy, the shapes in my room blurry and unfocused. Everything usual, from what I could make out. I look at the foot of my bed—no mirror. My head hits the pillows and I groan. My alarm blares and wails in agony before my palm sinks on-top of it. The static-like silence plunging right in afterward, my eyes still trying to focus enough to read the time.

From the corner of my eye I notice a figure, my breath catches as I lock my gaze to my desk like I've been frozen by Medusa—the dark figure just standing there. Its inky fingers slowly reaching up, and up, and up, until it finds where it wants. Then as soon as I realised it, the thing ups and leaves just like that.

I've been holding my breath all this time; shaky exhales with sharp tingles burn my lungs and throat as I gasp for air.

Guys, what the actual fuck is going on?
