 Being a pizza delivery guy has its perks—flexible hours, decent tips, and sometimes you get a free slice if the customer cancels. But nothing in my wildest dreams prepared me for what happened a couple of days ago.

It all started with a strange order, the kind you don’t see often. It was late, almost midnight, and the request came from the edge of town. The address was for a place called Griffon Grove. I didn’t recognize it, but the tip? The guy had already prepaid an extra $50 on top of the bill.

So, who am I to say no to that?

I packed the pizzas—two extra-large pies. The order specifically said pepperoni, but when I checked the boxes, it was a mistake: plain cheese. I winced since I was already half way along on my route. I hoped the customer wouldn't take notice right away. Either way, I wasn’t driving back to fix it.

The ride to Griffon Grove was eerie to say the least. The streets were empty, and fog had started to roll in.

By the time I arrived, the house itself looked like it was straight out of a horror movie—huge, dark, and falling apart at the edges.

No lights on, just the faintest glow behind the curtains. I hesitated, but hey $50 was $50. So I got down from my car and stepped on the wooden porch holding two large pizza boxes in my hands.

I knocked on the door, half expecting some old dude in a bathrobe to shuffle out, but what I got was something else entirely.

The door swung open on its own, creaking loudly. I peered inside, heart beginning to pound away in my chest.

“Hello? Pizza delivery!” I called out, my voice trembling.

There was no immediate answer, but I heard something—a slithering sound, faint at first, but growing louder.

My stomach tightened, and I took a step back, but before I could make up my mind to run, the figure emerged from the darkness.

It wasn’t human.

A hulking creature loomed in the shadows of the foyer, massive and grotesque, with slimy, rubbery skin and multiple writhing tentacles. I counted six, maybe seven or eight, of them, coiling and curling as it dragged its bulbous body closer to the light. Its eyes—large, glowing orbs—locked onto me.

I froze. This wasn’t just some person playing a prank. This was… real.

One of its tentacles reached out toward me, slow and deliberate.

 Instinctively, I stepped back, but the appendage stopped short, hovering just inches from the pizza boxes in my hands.

A smaller tentacle extended from the mass and lightly tapped the edge of one box. Then, with a precise movement, it flicked the lid open.

I heard the creature inhale deeply, a long, rasping breath that made my skin crawl. It was sniffing the air, its wide nostrils flaring.

“Cheese,” the creature hissed, the sound reverberating through the walls. Its voice was low, guttural, and distinctly angry. “This is only cheese!”

“Uh… yeah, sorry about that,” I stammered. “There was a mistake at the shop. I can—uh, go back and get—”

“Cheese,” the monster interrupted, its glowing eyes narrowing. “I ordered pepperoni.”

“Listen I know, man, I—”

The creature let out a deep growl, a horrible, wet sound that made my blood run cold.

Its tentacles twitched, and I felt the air grow thick with tension. I swallowed hard, feeling the weight of its anger pressing down on me.

“You dare bring me cheese?” it snarled, its voice filled with rage. “You… insignificant creature.”

I held up my hands, trying to placate it. “Look, I didn’t mean to mess up your order, okay? I’ll fix it. Just—just let me go, and I’ll get the right pizza.”

The monster leaned in closer, its eyes burning with rage. “No… mistakes.”

Before I could react, one of its tentacles shot out, wrapping around my waist like a steel vice. I was lifted off the ground in an instant, the crushing pressure making it hard to breathe.

My heart pounded in my chest as I struggled against its grip, but the more I fought, the tighter the tentacle squeezed.

“Wait!” I gasped, my voice barely a whisper. “Please, I’ll fix it. I swear!”

The creature brought me closer, its massive head mere inches from mine. I could feel the heat of its breath as it sniffed me again, its wide nostrils flaring with disgust.

“You reek of fear,” it said, its voice dripping with disdain. “I can smell it in the air.”

I flinched as another tentacle slithered up my leg, wrapping around my torso. I could feel the cold, slimy grip tightening, the suction cups pulling at my clothes. The creature’s eyes gleamed with malicious glee.

With two of its tentacles wrapped tightly around me from the neck  all the way down to my ankles, I felt them twist deliberately—one clockwise, the other counter clockwise.

The pressure sent shockwaves through my body, each wave pushing me closer to the brink of being ripped in half. Terror gripped me as I braced myself, fearing the monster would tear me apart at the waist at any moment.

“No!” I cried, thrashing against its hold. “Please, I didn’t mean to—”

“You have displeased me,” it growled. “And now… you will pay.”

The tentacles constricted further, squeezing the air from my lungs as I was pulled closer to the creature’s gaping maw.

Rows of sharp, jagged teeth glistened in the faint light, and the foul stench of decay wafted from its mouth. Panic surged through me as I realized what was about to happen.

“No!” I screamed, but it was too late.

With a sudden, violent motion, the creature yanked me downward. I slid into its mouth, my world plunging into darkness as I was swallowed whole.

Inside its stomach, I landed in a thick, viscous liquid that clung to my skin like tar. The smell of rot was overwhelming, and I gagged, struggling to keep my head above the sloshing fluid.

The walls of the creature’s stomach pulsed around me, the fleshy chamber shifting and contracting as I fought to find my footing in the swishing sea of goo. The viscous liquid itched and burned against my skin, as if I were being digested slowly.

I worried how long it would be before I, too, dissolved to become just another meal, lost to the darkness and the creature's insatiable hunger.

At that very moment, my hands brushed against something solid—a bone, slick and jagged. I gripped it tightly, my mind racing as I tried to figure out a way out of this nightmare. I wasn’t going to die here. Not like this.

An idea sparked in my mind.

If I could irritate the creature’s insides enough, maybe I could trigger its gag reflex. It was a long shot, but it was the only plan I had.

With renewed determination, I stabbed the bone into the squishy walls of the stomach. The creature let out a low growl, and I felt the walls around me contract in response. Encouraged, I stabbed again, harder this time.

“Take that you fat slob!” I shouted, jabbing at the pulsating flesh with all my strength.

The monster’s body shuddered, and I felt the stomach convulse.

It was working! I kept stabbing, each jab eliciting a stronger reaction. The growls grew louder, more panicked, as the creature struggled to deal with the irritation.

Finally, with one last powerful jab, I struck a particularly soft area. The monster let out a deafening roar, and the walls around me began to contract violently.  The sloshing liquid swirled around me like a whirlpool, pulling me deeper into its chaotic depths.

The pressure built, and I was suddenly hurled upward, the force of the convulsion propelling me toward the exit.

 With a wet, sickening sound, I was expelled from the creature’s mouth, flying through the air before crashing onto the floor with a thud. I lay there for a moment, coughing and gasping for air, the vile contents of the creature’s stomach coating my body.

As I struggled to stagger to my feet, I noticed the thick, viscous goo had formed a slippery pathway leading all the way to the entrance of the house. I tried to run, but my feet slipped on the slick surface, sending me sprawling once again.

As I lay on my back, I looked up to see the monster looming over me like an enormous, twisted version of Optimus Prime, its tentacles raised mid-air and curling at the ends like tight fists.

The creature's large, orb-like eyes blinked erratically, opening and closing while strange sounds emanated from its throat, as if it were intermittently gasping for air.

It was as if the creature was trying to speak, making noises like an octopus, and then, with terrifying force, it brought its head down and unleashed a violent sneeze.

A torrent of putrid slime erupted from its maw, sending me sliding along the gooey pathway and crashing into the old creaky entrance door, which shattered upon impact, spilling me out onto the porch.

I heard the creature let out a frustrated screech, its tentacles flailing wildly as I finally staggered to my feet and ran for my life.

When I reached my car, I jumped in and drove off as fast as I could. My heart pounded in my chest as I tried to put as much distance as possible between myself and that cursed house.

As the city lights finally came into view, I muttered, “No more late-night pizza delivery. Next time, I’m sticking to normal hours.”

I knew one thing for sure: I’d never forget this night. As I sped away from Griffon Grove, I made a repeat promise to myself.

No more late-night deliveries. Ever.
