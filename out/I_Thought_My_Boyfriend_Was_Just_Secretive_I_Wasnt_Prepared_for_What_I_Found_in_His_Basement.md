I’ve been dating Noah for almost a year. He’s sweet, incredibly smart, and just the right amount of introverted. He’s the kind of guy who reads obscure philosophy books, makes amazing coffee, and doesn’t mind when I ramble about my weird dreams.

We met at a mutual friend’s housewarming party. He stood in the corner, petting the host’s cat like he was in love with it. I joked about him being the human version of a cryptid—cute, elusive, and probably hiding some deep, dark secret. He just smiled.

Turns out I wasn’t too far off.

We moved in together three months ago. His house—yeah, his, not a rental—was this old Victorian-style place his grandmother left him. It had creaky floorboards, leaded glass windows, and an actual cellar with a heavy iron door. The first time I saw it, I joked that he was definitely hiding bodies down there.

He didn’t laugh.

At the time, I thought he just didn’t like murder jokes.

He told me the basement was “off-limits.” Said it was unsafe, that the floorboards were rotting and there were exposed pipes or something. I didn’t press it. Everyone’s got their boundaries, right? I had no reason to be suspicious. Until last Thursday.

Noah left for a last-minute “work trip.” He’s a freelance archivist—goes through historical records, organizes weird old libraries for rich eccentrics. I never really understood the specifics, but it sounded cool enough to brag about to my friends.

I was home alone, and a storm hit—massive thunder, the whole cliché. The power flickered, then went out entirely. I grabbed a flashlight and went looking for the fuse box, and realized I’d never actually seen it before. I figured it must be in the basement.

At first I just stood in front of the door. It was so damn cold near it—like, the temperature dropped a full ten degrees. That could’ve been my imagination, but I swear I could hear… whispers. Not words. Just murmurs, like someone was talking underwater.

I tried the door. It was locked, of course. But here's the thing—Noah always leaves his keys in the ceramic bowl by the front door. Including the one he told me was “for the shed.”

I’m not proud of this. I hesitated. I did. But I took the key.

It fit perfectly.

The door creaked open, releasing a smell that hit me like a brick—rotting wood, mildew… and something metallic. The flashlight flickered. Classic horror movie stuff.

I stepped down carefully, one wooden step at a time, flashlight aimed ahead.

The basement was huge. Far bigger than I thought. It wasn’t just one room—it was a series of narrow corridors and shelves lined with boxes, books, old furniture. Nothing immediately weird… until I saw the door at the back. It was newer than the rest—steel, bolted shut, and had a keypad next to it.

Why would an old Victorian house have a modern steel door hidden in the basement?

That’s when I noticed it. A notebook sitting on a stool nearby. The pages were old, but the handwriting was unmistakably Noah’s. I flipped through it, heart pounding.

He wasn’t just cataloguing books or family history.

He was documenting people. Names, dates, sketches. Some of them looked like anatomical drawings. Some were just... eyes. Pages and pages of human eyes. With notes like:

“Subject 4: Reacts poorly to sunlight. Duration: 6 days.”

“Subject 7: Vocal cords intact. Screams incessantly.”

“Subject 12: Still alive. Contained.”


I heard something scrape on the steel door. From the other side.

I ran.

I locked the door behind me. Put the key back. I’ve been pretending everything’s normal since he got back two nights ago. He asked if the storm bothered me, if I was “scared of the dark.”

I said no.

But last night, I heard him in the basement. Not walking.

Talking.

And something—something—was talking back.
