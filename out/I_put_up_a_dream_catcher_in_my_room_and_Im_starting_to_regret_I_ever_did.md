I'm unsure how to start this so I guess I'll start from here: 

I, 25 F live with my father and my younger sister, I used to have a place of my own but due to things not really going as planned with a past partner, I was forced to move from New Brunswick back to my hometown in Nova Scotia. My town is small, not really anything to say about it, I will say that this place DOES have it's folklore and old spooky tales, but this instance has nothing to do with any of it as much as I can muster.

It took me ages to unpack all my boxes, so long in fact that I hadn't even unpacked all of them and it's been over 2 years since I've moved back to my hometown. When I was cleaning my room one night I decided to hunt for some decorations to put up in the space near my PC so that it would feel a little less barren. My walls are a weird, messed up sea-green color so finding things that look good on it is difficult unless it's a random print from a con I've picked up since those look fine on pretty much anything. 

When rummaging through the boxes, I found it. It's a dream-catcher, about the size of a small dinner plate in diameter, decorating cutely with woven white lace in the middle and some cheap-looking pink plastic rose on the side of it. It also has some dangling decorations made up of the same white lace and white tassels you'd usually see on an old curtain pully.

Needless to say, the catcher is kinda ugly. It looks like something you'd see in a sweet old woman's house. But I liked it and it was the only decoration I had in the boxes besides some resident evil prints of Leon Kennedy, so I put it up anyway. 

After putting it up, I noticed the animals in the house started to act weird. My dog Cooper sits outside of my door and whines on occasion, my cat Beau won't even come near me anymore. It's unusual for my cat to behave that way as I've had him since he was just a baby, feed him, love him and hold him all the time. Even as I'm writing this, he's hiding under my bed and making low growling sounds. I chalked it up to just not having him around all the time, my grandpa has cancer so I leave the cat with him as a comfort animal since he loves him and he reminds him of his cat that passed away. I knew Beau might get a little less attached to me and more to him over the time he spent in with him, but not to this degree, not with him hissing and swatting at me..

  
I asked my mom where she'd gotten it from just to make sure it was something new and not something that could have any sort of spiritual attachment. She said she got it at fucking goodwill, which I'm not a fan of because I would never have put it up if I knew it belonged to another person..

  
I just feel weird about it, nothing much else really happened as of yet, but when my cat looks at me it's like he's looking past me, staring at something that I don't have the capability of seeing.,,

  
I'll update you guys more on this if anything else happens, though I'm welcome to suggestions. I don't know if I should just chuck it, if that would even fix anything,,
