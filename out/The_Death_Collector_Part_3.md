It got a pretty busy with a new job recently, but I'm finally ready to share more secrets.

Well, it hasn't all been work to be honest. There was a very long night filled with nightmares about what I guess I'll refer to as "the trench coat man", but it seems to have subsided after I put everything away and put out some meat again. I was also able to get some holy water to sprinkle (carefully) on Teresa, and ever since it only came on once with a short sermon from the kind woman preacher. If memory serves, the sermons will be sparce and mild again for a few months.

Anyway, I'm glad to say I finally got my first request, for an "Alan". It's not spelled the same but I actually do have two.

The first one is short and a lot lighter compared to my other secrets, so I'll share that first.

This man, Allan, was a former butcher from Pennsylvania that was *insistent* on looking for something called a "Squonk" so he could cheer it up. I had no idea what those were going into that particular home, but after digging around a bit I found plenty of art, stories, and accounts he'd collected to try and track one down. Honestly, all the more power to him. I wanted to cheer one up myself after hearing about how miserable the poor things are. In case you're as in the dark as I am, these are wrinkled pig-like creatures with warts and moles on their baggy skin that have webbed left feet (for some reason?) and cry all the time. And I mean *all the time*. They can even be tracked down by following trails of tears and dissolve into a whole puddle of them when someone tries to catch them. Poor creatures. If I ever run into one I made a promise to try to cheer it up for Allan on his behalf, and any time I come across a puddle or trail of water where it shouldn't be I joke to myself that I must have scared off a Squonk. He only had one kid that was still in Pennsylvania and wasn't able to make to trip to his dad's house, especially with the hassle he was already dealing with getting his dad's body across state lines, but I actually gave him the collection of notes and such when I saw him and we had a good laugh about it. One of the few secrets that I thought a family would actually like to know. Last I heard from Jeffrey he still attends Squonkapalooza in Johnstown as a way of sharing something with Allan now that he's gone. I hope he ends up finding one.

But I already know those aren't the kinds of secrets you're hoping to hear. After all, they aren't the kind that I keep in the Museum to start with. Still, I hope it gave you a laugh.

Now, let's talk about Allen, AKA "Allen with an E" for the purposes of my records.

I was actually contacted in person for this case, a relative rarity. I forget why exactly I was in the office, probably doing some of the paperwork side of the job if I had to guess, when a tall woman with dark brown eyes suddenly open the door and walked purposefully to my desk. The sudden intrusion made me jump, and I remember her eyes the most because they had me pinned in place with the level of intensity she had in them.

"Um, can I help you?" I asked, unusually nervous.

She put one of cards on the desk and slid it towards me. "Callahan recommended you. Said you can clear out houses for families of the deceased."

I nodded. Callahan was in my circle of funeral homes, a timid kind of guy that was balding and wore glasses. Poor guy must have been shaking if this was how the woman always was.

"My name is Alicia. I need the house of my father Allen cleaned out."

"That should be fine, I just need you to fill out-"

I wasn't able to finish my statement, because as soon as I had the form on the desk she had taken it from me to read through. Just as quickly, it was back in my hand, with her only having filled out the consents.

"Are you sure you don't-?"

"Positive. Donate it, trash it, burn it, take it yourself for all I care. My sister should be there getting whatever paperwork we need for the estate today, so by the time you come tomorrow we'll have whatever it is we need."

Despite her demeanor I couldn't help myself, I had to ask. "I'm getting the sense you weren't close."

Her jaw tightened slightly and her mouth briefly became one thin line as her eyes hardened impossibly more than they were. "He's been dead to me and my siblings for years, his body just finally followed suit. So can you come tomorrow or not?'

"Um, yes, I just need the specs so I know how much to charge-"

"I read the form. His house is 2,015 square feet and I'm fine with paying whatever that and the cost of labor comes out to. As long as neither me nor my siblings need to step foot in there after today."

I was a bit taken aback and checked the form again. Sure enough, the number she gave me was already written down next to the information for cost per square foot at baseline. I hadn't even seen her fill it. "My mistake, thank you for letting me know. I can be there tomorrow at 10:00 AM if that works for you."

She seemed to finally untense somewhat and, with it, her eyes softened. "Yes, that should be fine. My number is the one written down in case you have any questions, but honestly unless it's money or something we missed for the estate none of us really care about what's there."

I made a note of that in the form as I double checked the number, which actually was there too despite the short time she had the form. I was impressed, she was quick. "Perfect, thank you Alicia. I'll make sure not to bother you unless it's important so you don't have to worry."

Another level of tense seemed to come off of her and she actually smiled. "Thank you."

Of course, after that kind of introduction, I was both excited and nervous to see what there was to find at this house. It wouldn't have been my first time having to bring something to the police if need be, but I was hoping that wouldn't be necessary given the level of hostility Alicia had given to just the *idea* of her father. That kind of hate combined with needing to involve the police would lead to more than a few sleepless nights spent questioning humanity and whether there's good in the world. I'd rather avoid an existential crisis if I could help it.

The house was a nice country-style old ranch house, situated within eye sight of another house on each side but enough of a walk that visiting would take some effort. The wrap around porch was cozy and welcoming, a rocking chair set out there with a small outdoor table near the door, and I had to be careful not to knock over the single plant on the second to last step. It must have been lonely here at times, but I honestly was a little jealous of this place. A note on the door let me know where they hid the key for me and had the signatures of two other people I hadn't met, presumably Alicia's siblings. Charlie and Maisy. I never had a chance to ask, but I still wonder if Maisy was short for something.

Inside was spotless aside from some disturbed dust. Either Allen himself had kept it damn clean or his kids had tried to make my job easier, but the dust made me think that Allen was the tidy one. Couldn't complain though, let me get right to work.

There were no pictures on the walls and I noticed after a few rooms that there hadn't been any before I came either, with no telltale holes, nails, screws, or off-color squares to make where they'd been. In fact, the rooms themselves seem to only have what they needed in terms of the basics--chairs, a few tables, a bookshelf or two full of poetry books with some other volumes scattered in between, refrigerator, that kind of stuff. Minimal decorations. Kind of boring, honestly. It wasn't until I went to go upstairs that I noticed the rifle by the door, almost hidden by the coat rack it was leaning against.

Damn, I'd have to turn that in with some paperwork to the nearest police department. Firearms tend to be a huge pain. On a hunch I went to find the back door and found it in the kitchen with an axe upright against the trash can. Okay, not another firearm, but almost weirder. The guy had a fireplace, sure, but keeping that *in* the house wasn't exactly the norm. I dug in my backpack for a make shift inventory list and marked down the rifle before continuing upstairs, a little disappointed with how easy this house seemed to be.

Upstairs was more of the same, another bathroom roughly above where the downstairs one was and what looked like a storage room that I planned to save for last. The only other door seemed to be the man's bedroom, so that's where I went first.

More basic furniture, all wooden, but I was pleasantly surprised to see a galaxy-themed blanket folded on the bed to break up the monotony. Nothing of note under the clothes in the drawers and a single dirty magazine under the bed that was painfully tame. As I started to lose hope that there was any discernable reason why Allen's kids hated him so much, I found a leather-bound notebook in the top-most drawer of his end table.

Jackpot.

I sat on the bed as I opened it and found, in between what seemed to be his own poetry, a few scattered entries from this year.

>They're here again. Why the hell won't they just leave me alone? I don't even answer them anymore, and yet they *Just. Keep. Knocking.* I made a big show of loading my rifle as loudly as possible near the front door but they didn't even pause this time. They know I won't open it. They know I don't want to see them. So then why do they even bother? Why are they fucking torturing me like this?!

I raised an eyebrow curiously. Maybe the hatred from his kids was more recent if they were the same "they" he mentioned in this entry. I mean damn, if someone I cared about not only didn't want to see me but *threatened me with a gun* I'm not sure how else I would react. I skimmed through a few more pages of poetry which seemed to be astronomy themed before I found another.

>They're coming so often now. It used to be months, even years between them showing up at my doorstep. Now I'm lucky if it's a full week. What do they want? I know they want in, but why me? Why do they want *me* to let them in? I'm not doing it, damn it! I don't care if I'm at death's door, they can have in after I've crossed that threshold! Even if I have to hold out for hours before they stop knocking.

Why was he being so stubborn? Was it really his kids he was so adamant against? I didn't know but it was the only option I had at the moment. Several more poems, all about constellations, and then another.

>They're trying to keep me from sleeping. They seem to be hoping I'll crack and open the door to make it stop. You can knock all night you little bastards. I'm not opening that fucking door.

---------

>It's the windows and the backdoor now too. I keep the curtains on the backdoor drawn so I don't see their faces. The windows are all usually closed at night anyhow, but the backdoor curtains are so damn sheer that I can see the outlines of them out there. I almost made eye contact with one of them and I damn near pissed myself. Please, just go away. Just leave me alone.

------

>Why won't they just leave? Why won't they stop? I don't know if it's the stress but I'm getting sicker. The doctor said I need more rest, but I couldn't tell him why I can't sleep. At least he gave me some sleeping pills.

-------

>I can't take the pills. After a few nights I woke up at the door with my hand on the handle. I don't remember if sleep walking was one of the side effects but I won't risk it. The only thing keeping me sane is writing this down and looking at all the old journals in the clutter room. It's the only reason I know that I'm not imagining this, that the cancer isn't taking my mind from me.

------

>I'm going to die soon and they can't even let me die in peace. It's rest in piece you little shits, let me rest in peace. I just want peace. After all these years, please, just let me have some peace.

------

>I'll have my peace one way or another. Either you're going to kill me, or I'm going to kill you. Either way, the next time you come will be the last. Burn in hell you little demons.

I turned the next page in anticipation but there was only a short letter.

>To my children,  
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for everything. None of this was your fault. It was them, it was always them, but they made me afraid of you. As much as I hate to say it, the truth is that they made me hate you, hate your mother for having you. But that wasn't fair. You didn't deserve any of this. I'm so sorry. I deserve whatever you think of me.

>Dad.

That was all. That was the last thing in the journal. Thankfully, I knew it wasn't the only one.

Despite my earlier decision to save what I now knew as the "clutter room" for last I needed to know who "they" were. I needed to know who the hell could make a man hate his own children and his own wife for having them. Were "they" the ones knocking? Were his kids?

After digging through several boxes I found several leatherbound journals that were similar to the one in his bedside table, mixed in with some nicer ones that seemed to have been solely for the poetry he had been writing prior to getting sick. After rearranging a half-assembled new telescope and a few boxes of pictures that were taped far too much I was able to find a place to sit as I peaked at the first page of each to find the oldest one.

It was pretty easy to find. Kids write pretty big after all.

>Deer jurnal  
Today i got u frum my mom as a birfday prezent. she sed that I shood practis my riting evre nite so i can b reddy for furst grayd next yeer. Adam sed that evreone passes kindergarden but i bet he only sed that becuz i werked xtra hard and he wants to mayk fun of me. im gunna practis lots and ill b the bestest riter in furst grayd.

>Deer jurnal  
Today i whent swiming with Adam at the pond neer Judys hows. Judy is reely nice even tho she iz a big kid like Adam. He told me big kidz dont like to play wif littl kidz becuz we rnt as smrt but Judy sed that she thawt I wuz  fun. I hope we go swiming at the pond wif Judy agn reel soon.

The next few passages were cute but more of the same. Adam seemed to be his older brother and teased him a lot, and he seemed to be developing a crush on Judy for being nice to him. There were a lot of stories of them going to the parks or the pond together, sometimes with a few other kids, and it became very clear that poor Allen didn't have a lot of (or maybe any) friends his age.

>Deer jurnal  
I had to play at home by myslf today. Adam sed that he wantd to do sumthin wifout havin to bring a littl kid. Its not fair. Lucky for me Judy wuz home and she sed she wood play wif me. we made drawins at her howse on the sydewalk wif chawk.

>Dear jornal  
I fownd a spellin book frum wen Adam wuz in furst grade and ive ben practising sum of the harder werds. But im tryin not to cheet when im writin in you so i can see how much better im doin. That way i have sumthing to do wen Adam gos to play without me.

Jesus, why did Adam hate his brother so much? This was really sad. It almost made me want to call my brother and make sure I didn't do this kind of shit when we were kids. I skipped a few entries that were more of the same, though I did notice his spelling was getting better, and found one that looked interesting.

>Dear journal  
Today I met a new frend. He didnt tell me his name but he was reely nice. We met at the park and played on the jungl Jim for a wile. He has weerd eyes but i didnt say anything becuz i didnt wanna hurt his feelings. Mom sed that if sumone is difrent not to make them feel bad abowt it. But I reely havnt seen anyone before where they had black on all of the eye and not just the middel part.

"Black on all of the eye and not just the middle part"? Does he mean like...really dark brown eyes? I flipped until I found another one talking about his "new frend".

>Dear journal  
My new frend was at the park today. We played with stiks that were on the grownd and pretended they were swords. He was reely good and I askidentily asked how he was so good when all of his eye was black. i was worryed i hert his feelings but he sed that even tho his eyes were all black he cood still see. Even with the whyte part culered in too. Thats reely cool! I wish my eyes were all blue like his were all black.

Wait...even the white part of the eye was black? I hadn't heard of that before. I mean, except for some of those internet stories about the "Black Eyed Children", but they always ask people to come in at their cars and houses. I've never heard of them just...playing with regular kids.

>Dear journal  
My new frend asked me about my eyes today and why they were so many colors. I said thats how everyone i news eyes were. He asked me if I wanted to have eyes like him instead and i said that he was being silly becuz you cant make your eyes difrent. He said he had brothers and sisters who had eyes like him and that sum of them didnt have eyes like that befor. I asked what they were like befor and he sed they were like mine but that they were biger kids so he didnt no how they did it and he cood ask if they wood make mine like his. I asked if they cood make them go bak after but he sed he didnt no. i sed it was ok to ask becuz id like them to be all black for a littel wile but if they can make them all blue insted that i wood do it even if they stayed that way.

---------

>Dear journal  
My new frend isnt my frend anymore.  
when i went to see him at the park there was a bunch of kids with him that had all black eyes like he did. he sed that they wanted to meet me. i was a littel scared but I sed hi my name is Allen like your suposed to do wen you meet someone new. They didnt say anything but they all looked at each udder and some of them noded and looked at the kid. the kid sed they liked me and wanted me to be his new brother. I said i alredy had a brother and i thawt they were gonna see if i cood have black eyes for a littel bit. he sed itd be forever but it wood make us brothers and theyd all be nicer than Adam and wood never leeve me by myself like Adam. it sownded nice but all of them looking at me made me feel all cold so I sed no. The kid got reel mad and i got scared and ran home. they fallowed me and kept noking on the door and telling me to let them in and mom was at work and i started crying becuz i was so scared. then Adam came in in the back door and asked me why i was crying. i sed i was scared of the kids outside with black eyes and when he looked they were gone. i thawt he wood make fun of me but he gave me a hug and said i cood play with him so i woodnt see them agen. i love Adam and im glad hes my brother and not the kids with black eyes.

As heart warming as that was, I felt a chill run up my spine. It felt wrong reading about such a little kid being so afraid and trying to describe what was clearly dread. And those kids...they wanted to make him one of them...I shuddered and skimmed to rest of the journal but the kids with black eyes didn't show back up in this book. Well, there were five more of them, I had a feeling they'd be in there somewhere.

It looked like he was in middle school when they showed up again.

>Dear journal,  
Today was the first time I've looked at my old journal in a long time. I had to though. I thought I was crazy. But I'm glad I did because it proves I'm not.  
While I was walking home today from school with Kyle and Owen like usual, and we were talking about the cute new girl in our math class and guessing who she was going to end up liking. I said it was gonna be me and when Kyle went to argue he stopped and was looking across the street. I looked to see why he looked so scared and I saw three kids our age looking at us from across the street. They had black eyes, and it all hit me about what happened the summer before first grade. I forgot all about it until now. But the kid in the middle, it was the same one from the park. He was older, but I knew it was him. He looked happy but it didn't feel like he was *really* happy. It felt like the way my uncle's hunting dogs look when they're chasing a rabbit.  
They started to cross the street and I told Kyle and Owen to run and started booking it home. They must have felt the same way I did because they didn't ask any questions and just ran away too. And those kids were chasing us until we split off to go to our houses. Then they just followed me and were slamming on the door telling me to open up and that they needed me to let them in. Mom was working for a few more hours and I didn't know where Adam was, probably at Judy's, but when I thought about going outside and running over to check it made my legs shake. They kept at it for a while but they gave up eventually and left, and I was so relieved I cried. I haven't cried like that in a long time. Probably since the last time I saw them.

--------

>Dear journal,  
Kyle and Owen were really weird today when I asked about what happened on the way home. They acted like they didn't know what I was talking about and when I kept trying to ask about it they got mad and walked to school without me. Why would they act like it didn't happen? We all saw those kids. I had to read yesterday and the old journal again to make sure I wasn't remembering wrong or I didn't dream the whole thing. But I know I didn't. I just want them to admit it happened. I don't understand why they won't do it.

I had to agree with Allen, why the hell would they gaslight this poor kid like this if they all saw it? At least in the old journal it looked like no one else ever saw him with the black-eyed boy, but having people you know saw it to refuse to acknowledge it must have been hard on the kid. I flipped around a bit and found another that stood out to me.

>Dear journal.  
I had Kyle and Owen stay over tonight. They're finally asleep right now, but it's almost morning. We couldn't sleep after what happened.  
We were watching a movie and eating popcorn my mom made us when someone knocked at the door. My mom asked me to go get it and when I did I froze. It was that kid. The one with the black eyes. He had this big smile that made me think of a shark and said it wasn't nice not to invite him over with my other friends. I told him we weren't friends and he and his siblings creeped me out and that he had to leave. My mom came up behind me during it and didn't seem to notice the kid's eyes because she was just talking to him like he was a normal kid. The kid said his name was Christian and that I had invited him over and that he was sorry for being so late. I tried to get her to shut the door and tell her it wasn't true but she told me I was being rude and that since he didn't have anything to sleep over he could watch the movie before she brought him home.  
And then he was inside my house.  
I couldn't stop shaking as he came in, and he just kept looking around with that shark grin like he was ready to take a bit out of something. My mom nudged me to bring him to the living room with my friends but I didn't want to. I begged her to tell him to leave, that I didn't want him here, and she yelled at me so loud that my friends came to see what was going on. They got all pale when they saw the kid and I knew. I knew I was right and they remembered the kid and they saw him that afternoon. But it didn't matter. I had to bring him in or else mom said Owen and Kyle would have to go too.  
We all sat as far away from him on the couch as we could but either he didn't notice or didn't care. Just kind of looked around when he wasn't looking at the TV and mostly looked up at the ceiling. When the movie was over he didn't say anything and just walked out into the darkness before my mom could come out and take him home. When Mom didn't come out at all I went to talk to her about it but she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. Owen and Kyle talked about what happened a little to say how creepy it was and said that after they went home tomorrow they didn't want me to talk to them ever again. I don't blame them.

---------

>Dear journal,  
Dad's sick. After Owen and Kyle left this morning we heard him coughing and Mom checked on him and screamed. Adam and I went up too and saw he had coughed up blood on his pillow and was having a hard time breathing. He's in the hospital now and mom won't tell us what's wrong with him.  
He was just fine after work yesterday. He even helped me pick out the movie for last night.  
I don't know how, but it's that kid's fault. If dad dies, I'll kill him. I'll swear I'll kill him.

Just a few days later there was a short entry, just one line and not even a "dear journal" to start it.

>I'm going to find you Christian and I'm going to kill you for what you did.

There were pages upon pages after that talking about his dad, how much he missed him, and how angry he was at that kid for taking him away. He was positive that this kid had killed him somehow, that it was the kid's fault that he got sick. I get it, he was just a kid and his dad died, and the same boy made him lose his two best friends. But he was *so sure*. He made plans and maps and diagrams about how he was going to kill this kid in between half-hearted entries. Talking about how hard his mom and brother were taking things, how angry his brother got when Allen tried to tell him what he thought happened, how alone he felt. The only bright light was that his mom apparently got a dog to help the kids heal and that the dog became his best friend not long after.

Nothing else showed up about the black-eyed boy aside from the occasional reference to his quest for revenge until midway through high school, about a fifth of the way in the third journal.

>Dear Journal,  
I found him.  
Well, okay, Blitz found him. But the kid finally showed his fucking face after all this time. I was taking Blitz for a hike with me when he just showed up, out of nowhere. I probably wouldn't have even seen him if Blitz hadn't stopped and started growling.  
Just like last time he was older, but it was him. And he had that damn grin on his face that he had the night he killed dad.  
He said it'd been a long time and asked about Blitz, but after so long I was *not* in the mood to talk. I told him that he had a lot of fucking nerve to show his face after what he did to my dad and he actually stopped smiling for a second. I don't think it was actually because he felt bad though, I think he didn't expect me to realize it was him. He said he was sorry to hear about my dad but he didn't do it, he just wanted to see his old friend and watch a movie that night. Bullshit. He knows it was his fault. I told him I didn't know how he killed dad but that I knew it was him, that maybe he was still pissed that I didn't want to be like him but that now he was gonna pay for what he did. I was so pissed off when he started smiling again, a condescending smile like a fucking adult explaining to a kid why he can't have ice cream for dinner.  
He told me that it was impossible but that he would forgive me for saying that if I went with him this time. That it would be too late soon and if that happened things would be a lot worse for me.  
That was when Blitz attacked him.  
It all happened so fast that I didn't have a chance to even react, Blitz just leapt at him and tried to bite him, maybe because he was trying to protect me. The kid's eyes went wide but before Blitz could get him he was just...he was just gone. It wasn't possible but he was just gone. And then I heard him whisper in my ear that he'd be here if I changed my mind, but when I swung at him he was gone again.  
I'm gonna make him pay on my next hike, but just in case I'm gonna leave Blitz at home. I don't want that fucker to hurt him.

A few entries passed with him hyping himself up, including a guilt ridden and righteous entry detailing stealing his dad's rifle for the grim task, before an entry in shaky writing. Another entry with no "dear journal" to preface it.

>I fucked up. I fucked up so bad. I swear I didn't know. I'm so sorry Judy.  I'm so sorry Adam. I'm so sorry Alex. I'm so so so fucking sorry. You didn't deserve this. You all didn't deserve to pay for what I did.

Before I could think about it too much, the next entry started, bookmarked by a laminated prayer card they give out at funerals. A card for a two year old boy named Alex, with the same last name as Allen. I couldn't remember the context of who that was in the older entries other than knowing that I'd seen it before, but the entry behind it was heart-breaking.

>Dear journal.  
I haven't been able to write until after the funeral. I couldn't look at those entries and remember how selfish I was. How stupid I was. I know that I didn't know any better, that if I *had* known I would have never risked doing this, but it still feels like it was my fault. Because it is. It's all my fault. I tried to apologize to Adam and Judy, and Adam started screaming at me and ended up breaking my nose after the funeral. Judy just...looked so broken. So sad. Every time I think about her face that day it hurts a little more. I don't think Adam will ever talk to me again. He doesn't believe me, and he accused me of trying to "add his loss to my insane personal narrative about that kid", but it doesn't matter. At least he won't be at risk anymore and hopefully Judy can heal.  
Considering what happens every time this kid shows up, I should probably write it down and confess my sins. No priest would forgive me anyway, and they shouldn't. I should never be forgiven.  
I went to the hiking trail and he was there. He was waiting just like he said he would. I came alone and I brought dad's gun with me, thinking it would be justice for his gun to be what took down his killer. Stupid. Fucking stupid. The kid was grinning that fucking shark grin at me and before he could even open his mouth I shot him with the rifle in the gut. His shirt turned black around the area where the buckshot had torn open his clothes and flesh, but there wasn't anything else. No guts. No pouring blood. Nothing but the clear evidence that he had been shot plain as could be in his stomach. He coughed up some black liquid that looked almost like tar and braced himself on the tree. And he...laughed. He fucking laughed at me. He laughed hard and long and said that a no would have already made things bad for me, but that I had no idea how bad shooting him was going to be. It wasn't a threat. It was a promise. I tried to level my gun again and shoot him in the head but he dropped down and I just made a hole in the tree he was bracing himself on. I ran over to try and finish him and he was gone. All that was left was some drops of that tar stuff he had coughed up and a few scraps of the shirt he had on. At the time I was shocked, confused, pissed off as all hell. I had not idea what he'd meant. I had no idea what I'd done.  
When I got home, mom was crying. Adam had called from the new place he was renting with Judy. I was confused at first because I talked to them right before they'd headed out camping for the next four days and it was only two days into the trip, Adam had even joked that if it rained that Alex had his rainboots and umbrella and they'd go fishing until the rain stopped. So how was he calling mom?  
When she managed to explain, broken up by fits of sobbing, I was pale. I felt like throwing up, and I couldn't stop the tears.  
While they were camping, Alex had managed to wander off while they were setting up the campfire for lunch. They didn't realize he was gone until they were finished, and both ran off to find him. But Alex was in his  PJs, the little brown rabbit onesie that Judy got him before the trip as a joke, and he was hard to find.  
The hunter found him first.  
When Adam heard the gunshot he ran in that direction, worried and hoping for the best, and found Alex with a hole the size of his whole torso on the ground, with the hunter sobbing and apologizing next to his body. Adam barely could tell he was there though, all he could do was hold Alex and sob himself until he threw up. Judy was close enough to hear him crying and came over and...and it was like she broke. She cradled his little body and was trying to wake him up, trying to wrap her jacket the hole in him, trying to pretend that she wasn't holding a dead toddler in her arms.  
I knew. I knew that this was what the kid meant. I knew that I was the reason Alex was dead.  
How the fuck could anything worse that this happen, huh Christian? How the fuck can things be worse than this?  
How can things be worse when I killed my own fucking nephew?

My heart dropped. I could see where he got the idea from, shooting the kid leading to his nephew getting shot too, but...I couldn't imagine that weighing on me. The idea that I killed my own family. That I killed a *toddler*. And it didn't get any better. There wasn't an entry, but another prayer card...a card for a woman named Judy, who hade been in her early 20s.
