 

I prepared my *whole* life for this moment but never did I expect “Aw fuck it” to be my signal that the world was finally ending. I had always figured it would be sirens or my dad and mom waking me up before saying “I told you so!”.

But nope.

Just the random instance of my friend and her boyfriend screwing in my backseat. I played it off since she was fast anyways. ‘*Not the first time, won't be the last*’ I thought with a small chuckle to myself. 

I was wrong. It was the first of many lasts. My last night DD’ing for my drunk friends, my last party, my last car ride, and the last phone call before everything went to hell. Thinking back on it, I remember silently praising my parents for raising me to be responsible. Because if I hadn't answered, I’d have never even stood a chance.

The phone rang. I picked up and answered.

“One second, Mom. You’re connecting to Bluetooth. Ignore the noise”

“Blair. Where are you?” She rushed out. “Get home now!”  

“I'm in the car, mom. What's up?.”

“Have you seen the news?”

“I can't see the news in the car I’m-”

“What is that noise? Are you having…” Then she cut herself off “Whatever! It's happening! You need to get home NOW.”

I knew exactly what she meant. My parents had always been “doomsday preppers”. However, they never called it Doomsday. “A backdoor to every situation can always save you from catastrophe!” was my dads favorite way to cheer someone up after they made a mistake. When my mom was around, it went to the extreme. So ever since Y2K they decided the world would definitely go through an event in their lifetime and they would be damned if they succumbed to it. 

If the world would meet its doom, someone would survive. Therefore negating the fact of it being a doomsday. So they would often refer to it as an “event” or “it.” But never would they jump the gun. It was too real for them. So when ‘it's happening’ then they’re not messing around. 

A million thoughts coursed into my head at once. Why? Who? What? Where? 

That daze quickly came to an end when I realized the gravity of the situation. 

I'm not where they think I am. “Idiot.” I blurted out loud. To which my mom responded “What? Look, honey- we’re all in the shelter. The closest silo still gives us about  a couple of minutes before impact. You need to get here NOW.”

The screwing in the background continued. I was nowhere near home. My brain was still rattled and their continued intensity in the backseat did not make this any easier. That's when I realized that Casey had probably figured it out before I did and decided that this is how they would spend their last moments.

“I'm not going to make it, Mom…”

She was silent for a while before she said “Teenagers.” I could hear her break through the phone. “I love you honey.” She said slowly. Without a bunker, safety isn't a guarantee. And even in one, there's still not a 100% chance you’d be able to make it through the aftermath. She started back up, “With all of my-”

“10 seconds.” I blurted. Cutting her off. “What?” She replied. She understood what I meant but not its relevance. The intensity behind me finally cut back. I didn't know if they finished or were finally listening. “10 seconds after detonation. That's how much time you have to brace yourself.”

I heard sirens in her background and one final "We love you, Blair." Before the call finally cut out. I knew they would be fine but I would be lying if I said I wasn't horrified.

A few moments later, those same sirens surrounded the air around me.

*Boom.*
