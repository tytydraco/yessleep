I’m gonna be honest - driving for a rideshare company was *not* my dream job. But, money is money and it’s better not to turn your nose up at an opportunity. Really, I was just happy to be making any money at all. A few years ago, my life was a *mess,* and pulling myself out of said mess has not been an easy feat. But I *have* been doing it. I’m on the straight and narrow these days. I’m turning it all around, step by step and driving for the company (which shall not be named) is part of that. 

It’s not like the work is bad either. Driving is fun for me. I find it relaxing, so the days go by fast. And some of the folks you meet while driving are pretty neat. There’s something about meeting people from all walks of life and sharing a brief connection with them during the course of a short ride. It’s hard to describe it exactly. I guess the closest I could come is calling it a positive ennui. Maybe the word is contentment? Maybe.

I dunno if I’d call myself content with where I am in life, but I’m not exactly miserable either. Like I said, it’s hard to describe and do I speak for everyone? Absolutely fucking not. I’m pretty sure there’s a lot of people out there who are gonna tear me a new asshole for having the Company’s cock jammed so far down my throat that it’s a wonder I can still breathe, and to be completely honest, I wouldn’t be doing this fucking job if I had any other options. But, when forced into a situation out of desperation, one tries to make the best of it because the alternative is extremely fucking miserable.

\*\*\*

I hadn’t really been able to sleep the night that I picked up Hillary, and I’d figured that since I couldn’t sleep, I might as well try to make some money.

It was around midnight on a Friday, so I figured I could pick up the late night bar crowd. I’d done it before and even had a few regulars I saw every so often.

As expected, my first few rides that night were from the standard bar crowd. Drunk college kids heading back to their dorms, a few old barflies going home to their wives and a couple of randos who didn’t fit either description. All in all - it was a pretty average night, up until I got the request from Hillary.

It came in at around 1:45 AM. At a glance, there didn’t seem to be anything off about it. She was near an intersection about fifteen minutes away from me, between the hospital and one of the rowdier college bars. I didn’t think anything of it as I accepted the request and made my way over.

The street was dead silent. There were a few parked cars, but everything was closed and there wasn’t a single sign of life anywhere, save for the bar down the street.

Still, I pulled over at the spot where the app told me to pull over and waited. I messaged Hillary to let her know that I was there, before looking around to see if she was on her way.

No sign of her.

No sign of anyone.

The street was abandoned… which was kinda weird. I would’ve expected to at least see some people on the sidewalks, heading out for the evening.

Then, all of a sudden my rear passenger door opened. I looked back just in time to see a shabby looking blonde woman getting in. She looked a little older than the regular bar crowd and if I had to guess, I’d say that she was somewhere in her mid to late thirties. 

She shuffled into my back seat without a word, before closing the door. I remember noticing just how stiff her movements were. Her arms were limp and seemed to hang off of her body. She moved almost like she was being dragged or thrown, and at the time I’d just assumed she was drunk.

   “Evening,” I said, although she didn’t reply. I glanced down at my phone. Her destination was an address on the east side of the town, in the suburbs. I confirmed it with her, and she just sort of gave this quiet half nod.

Good enough.

With that, I pulled back out onto the street. I glanced at her in my rearview mirror. She stared silently out the window, watching the quiet buildings pass by. I got the impression that she didn’t really want to talk, but the air in the car felt… awkward. I had to shake that off, somehow.

   “Late night tonight, huh?” I asked.

Her head shifted slightly as she looked at me.

   “You hitting up the bars?” I asked.

   *“No…”* Came her reply. Her voice was flat and relatively toneless.

Maybe she wasn’t much of a drinker? I mean, despite the way she moved, she didn’t exactly look drunk. But then why was she out this late? It technically wasn’t any of my business, but I was still curious. I mean… *technically* I don’t really like getting involved in other people's drama. It’s just exhausting and who’s got the energy for it? There’s a thousand more productive things that you could be doing! Why waste your time getting involved in other people's business?

*But…* I was also a nosy little fucker. I suppose that’s why drama always happened to find me, but I digress. I pushed her a little further.

   “Working?” I asked.

No response, but looking at her in the rearview mirror, I thought I saw her head shake slightly… and that’s when I noticed the plastic wristband she was wearing.

The kind of wristband you only get at the hospital.

*Oh.*

*Oh shit.*

Now if I was a smart man, I’d have shut my mouth. But I didn’t end up with no other employment options aside from rideshare apps by being a smart man, did I?

   “Hospital stay, huh? Hope everythings alright!”

Her eyes shifted toward me, but she still didn’t say a word. For a moment. I wondered if I might’ve just touched some kind of nerve… and then she spoke again.

   *“My husband is waiting for me,”* She said, her voice still as toneless as before. 

I quietly wondered why he couldn’t pick her up himself. Still - I tried to pry even further because I’m physically incapable of taking a hint.

   “Guess he’s not a driver, huh?” I asked. No answer.

   “How long have you been married?”

No answer.

I kept talking, but she didn’t talk back… and after a while I finally had no choice but to shut up.

We drove into the suburbs, through a rougher part of town. The address she’d given me led to an old house that had probably seen some better days, and I pulled to a stop in front of it.

The lights were off, but I could see a pickup truck out front, telling me that somebody was home.

   “Alrighty, finally home!” I said, still trying to make some form of conversation. But when I looked back, my passenger was gone. I hadn’t even heard the door open. She was just… gone…

I paused, scanning my back seat and even checking the floor, just in case she’d randomly decided to get down there for some stupid reason.

Nothing.

It was like she’d never even been there!

I checked my phone… according to it, I was offline. There was no ride request from anyone named Hillary.

What the fuck?

My mind immediately drifted back to some stories I’d read about taxis picking up ghosts… apparently it was such a problem in New Orleans that the taxi’s stopped picking people up past a certain hour. Had that been what had happened here? Holy shit, had I just encountered an honest to God Ghost? That was so cool!

And then the screaming started.

It was faint. Distant even. Definitely coming from the house I’d just dropped my ghost off at. I looked over at the house. The lights were still dark, and I caught myself wondering if I was imagining the screaming, since someone inside the house would need to be screaming pretty loud in order for me to hear them.

And that’s when I heard the gunshot.

Hell, I *saw* the gunshot. I saw the flash of light in the window as someone in that house started shooting! And immediately, I realized that something *very fucking horrible* was going on.

Immediately I got up and raced toward the door. Was that a smart move? No. Probably not. The smart move would’ve been to call 911. But I didn’t get where I am in life by being a smart person, did I? 

So I sprinted for the front door of the house. It was unlocked. I don’t really know what I was thinking of doing. I didn’t really have any sort of plan. I’ve never been much of a planner.

The moment I made it through that door… something dropped off the second floor in front of me, hitting the hardwood floor before me with a heavy thud.

It took me a moment to realize that it was a person. A man, somewhere in his thirties or forties. He gasped in pain and writhed on the ground. I noticed a gun on the ground beside him. It was out of his reach, but it was just beside my shoe… I could’ve kicked it over to him. Instead, I watched him drag himself toward it before my eyes shifted up toward a shape on the stairs.

It was Hillary.

She stared at me, eyes burning into mine. 

She was daring me to move.

I took a step back. Whatever the hell this was, my gut told me that getting involved was a bad idea.

Hillary continued to stare at me. The man on the ground reached for the gun. I kicked it away. I don’t know why I bothered… I don’t think the gun would have helped him. Looking back at it, I don’t think there was anything that could’ve helped him. 

Still, his hand froze, he looked up at me, noticing me for the first time. 

We stared at each other.

Neither of us said a word.

Something grabbed him.

It wasn’t *her.* It was just… 

…well, it was nothing.

One moment he was laying there in front of me and the next, something was dragging him, screaming into the darkened house. 

I took a step back, and I booked it back to the car. By that point, I’d seen enough to decide that it was better just not to get involved. Does that make me a coward? Maybe. Do I give a fuck? No. 

\*\*\*

I heard about an incident on the local news a day later. 

It was a real tragedy, they said… a local man had apparently taken his own life after his wife had passed away in the hospital. It wasn’t a grief thing either… Apparently the police had been investigating him for allegations of battery. 

Crazy.

I never went to the police, obviously. Even if I did, I don’t think they’d have believed me anyway.

Hell. I doubt you’ll believe me… but what the hell. I gotta tell someone, right?
