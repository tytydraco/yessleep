I moved to the Pacific Northwest with my mom, dad, and younger brother in the spring of 1989. I had just turned thirteen and was excited to “start over” in a new town. We'd just moved from a big city out east, and while I loved the city, I never quite fit in. I was the classic dweeb—short, chubby, redheaded, freckled, and wearing thick glasses. God basically tattooed a “kick me” sign on my back at birth.

I didn’t have many friends. So to say I was thrilled to leave behind the daily torment would be an understatement.

The house we moved into sat on the edge of the mountains. Every morning I’d wake to a view of towering pines and distant peaks, the crisp scent of the woods drifting in through my window. It was magic.

That summer, we settled in. My dad, a handyman who could fix just about anything, spent his days repairing our fixer-upper. The place had busted windows, rotten siding, and a roof that looked like it had survived a meteor storm. Inside, it reeked of mold, cat urine, and that musty basement smell I remembered from my great-grandma’s house. But within weeks, with help from his brother, Dad had it livable.

Upstairs became my sanctuary—two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a small living area. My brother Sebastian and I had rooms side by side. He was nine, four years younger than me, and he thought I hung the moon. I made it my mission to protect him like a proper big brother.

Which is why August 28th, 1989 will haunt me for the rest of my life.

That Monday started like any other. I woke to the smell of bacon, eggs, and toast. Mom called us down, and we raced to the kitchen. Sebastian won. I let him—like always.

We ate like kings. It was our last week before school started, so we wanted to make it count. That day’s plan was a bike ride to Hope Mountain, about twenty miles away. There was a trail leading up to its base, and we couldn’t wait for one last adventure together.

My Star Wars watch said 8:08—we were late. We grabbed our backpacks, kissed Mom goodbye, hugged Dad (not a hugger), and pedaled off.

The ride was incredible. Even now, as I approach fifty, I can remember every tree and every bend in the trail. We reached the base around 10:45 a.m., parked our bikes, and found a shaded bench to rest. We unpacked our snacks and water and chatted about what to do next.

“Can we climb a bit?” Sebastian asked. “I think it’d be cool!”

I smiled but shook my head. “Too dangerous. Maybe next time with Mom and Dad.”

He pouted but understood.

We sat and read a Batman comic together. He’d nudge me when he was done with a page. It was over ninety degrees, but the mountain breeze made it bearable.

Eventually, Sebastian stood.

“I’m gonna look over there,” he said, pointing at some bushes. “Maybe I’ll find a cool bug or a praying mantis!”

I nodded. He wobbled into the brush and nearly fell but caught himself.

“I’m fine!” he yelled.

Then… I must’ve dozed off.

A mosquito bit my leg, snapping me awake. My watch read 1:12 p.m. Nearly an hour had passed. I sat up, looked around.

“Sebastian?” I called.

No answer.

I checked the bush where I’d last seen him—broken twigs, no Sebastian. His bike was gone. I jumped on mine and took off down the trail.

About a mile later, I stopped.

Sebastian’s bike was lying in the grass. No sign of damage. It looked… placed.

I scanned the nearby woods. Then I grabbed my bag and headed in.

“Sebastian!” I yelled. “Come on, this isn’t funny!”

I expected him to jump out, grinning. “Got you!”

But the woods were still.

I kept walking until I reached a ravine splitting the forest in two. I turned right, toward the mountain. I kept calling. The only response was my own voice echoing.

Then—I saw it. A single red Converse sneaker in the grass.

“Sebastian!”

Nothing.

Then, a voice: “Caleb!”

It was Sebastian, frantic.

“Where are you?” I shouted.

“I’m over here! Near the cave!”

Cave?

I hadn’t seen a cave.

I followed the voice until I found it—tucked between two large trees, hidden by overgrowth. I stepped closer.

“Sebastian, are you in there?”

No answer.

Then—a stench. Rancid, suffocating. I gagged. My gut screamed to turn around. But I called out again.

“Sebastian!”

A reply came—but not in his voice. It was low, raspy.

“Come closer.”

My heart thudded. I inched forward. Then I saw it.

A long, bony arm stretched from the darkness—its fingers like brittle branches. A pale, round head peeked out. Its eyes were inky black voids. It stared directly at me and beckoned me with one crooked finger.

Then—“Caleb!”

Sebastian again.

I turned toward the voice.

Suddenly, a grip around my ankle. The creature's hand. Its fingers wrapped like vines. It dragged me toward the blackness.

I screamed. I clawed at the ground. My fingers dug into the dirt—nothing helped.

Then—I found a rock. I smashed it into the hand. Once, twice.

The grip loosened.

I broke free and ran.

I ran blind, heart pounding, until I found the ravine. Then the trail. Then my bike.

I rode home like hell was on my heels.

I got home just before five, collapsed in the kitchen. Mom was there instantly.

“What happened? Are you okay? Where’s Sebastian?”

I couldn’t speak. I told her everything.

Dad didn’t believe me—but he got in his truck and drove to the mountain.

Mom and I waited.

At 6:15, the phone rang.

She answered. Her face went pale. She slid down the wall, sobbing.

Dad came home around nine. His eyes were red. A police officer was with him.

“May I speak with your son?” he asked.

They nodded.

“Caleb,” he said. “I’m Officer Braddock. Can you tell me what happened today?”

I told him. About the mountain. The comic. Falling asleep. The cave.

His pen froze.

“A cave?” he asked. “Could you lead us there?”

I nodded.

We drove back. Sebastian’s bike was still there, behind yellow tape.

I led them into the woods, near the ravine.

The trees were the same. The thick stump I remembered was there.

But the cave was gone.

In its place—one red Converse sneaker.

Officer Braddock examined it. Blood on the laces.

My mother wept into my father’s chest. He pulled me into his arms, too.

The search went on for weeks. Then months. Then years.

It became a cold case.

The only evidence: a bike, and a single shoe.

Officer Braddock called less often. Then he stopped calling altogether.

But I never stopped going back.

Every year on August 28th, I return to Heart Mountain.

Hoping to find Sebastian. Hoping for answers.

Sometimes, I hear his voice in the wind.

Sometimes, I see the cave again—deep in the woods.

“He’s in here,” it whispers.

Maybe next time, I’ll go in.

Maybe I’ll see my baby brother again.

Until then, I only have his memories—

and the weight of my regret.
