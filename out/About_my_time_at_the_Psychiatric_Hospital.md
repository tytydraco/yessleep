My work situation had fallen apart. The city’s economy had gone to hell, largely because of the mass layoffs that came just a couple of years after the pandemic. One option disappeared after another until, by a strange combination of chance and necessity, I found myself working at a psychiatric hospital.

The first days were unsettling—not because of the patients, but because of the staff. They were, quite literally, a pain in the ass. There was a constant, almost obsessive need among my coworkers to resemble the people who were institutionalized, as if proximity were contagious. It made me question my own sense of self, asking myself over and over what exactly I was doing there, and how long it would take before I blended in.

Some of them believed in aliens. Others were so consumed by the drugs they used that they openly talked about admitting themselves. From where I stood, there were only two options: stay and adapt to the shared madness, or leave and gamble on another job that probably wouldn’t be healthy either. I stayed.

Time passed.

My role as an aide was simple on paper: assist nurses and medical staff with basic tasks—most of which, conveniently, were never mentioned in the original job description. Another part of my work was listening. For hours. While we colored, cleaned, walked in circles, or assembled puzzles meant to keep their minds busy, the patients talked.

And I listened.

I’m good at gossip, and even better at letting it pass through me without holding on too tightly. Still, their stories accumulated. Carmen told me how her obsession with dolls led her to dress up her nieces, tie them to the table, and host elaborate tea parties. Tony described the beating his father gave him—so severe it left him with permanent tinnitus in his left ear—and how the sound of a man’s dress shoes was enough to trigger panic. Martha told me about being kidnapped and held inside a hippie mansion by members of a cult. Emile fascinated me with his account of walking out of the Central African rainforest, crossing borders until he reached Italy by boat, and then Canada.

Their stories seemed endless. I felt pleasure listening to them, studying them, realizing that beneath the diagnoses and the paperwork, what we kept reflecting back to them—over and over—was something painfully familiar: humanity.

Two, three, four, five years went by. The hospital became my home. Their stories became mine.

Then came Germain.

Germain was power made sick. A delusional macho who belonged in prison, not in a low-security psychiatric hospital. He was rude, arrogant, openly hostile to the staff. There were only two ways to deal with him: sedated or restrained. Exactly like in the movies.

He complained constantly. About the lights. The music. The food—too cold, too hot. Everything offended him. He was a narcissist, deeply manipulative, and almost completely incapable of empathy.

One night, I was assigned to watch him.

He seemed calm, almost cooperative, but I could feel it—that pressure in the air that tells you something is wrong. I was working the night shift, and adrenaline lingered in the corridors. It felt inevitable.

Around two in the morning, with the ward quiet and most of the staff distracted, Germain started complaining about the heating. The building was ancient; the temperature was controlled manually from inside the room. I approached carefully. As I reached for the valve, he injected me.

We struggled. I managed to scream and trigger the emergency alarm. I remember thinking I had done enough. Then the drug took hold. My body went heavy. I felt him lift me by the neck—his strength absurd compared to my 164 centimeters, my 58 kilos, my father’s brittle legs passed down to me like a curse.

After that, everything fractured.

I woke up the next morning in a hospital bed, surrounded by coworkers. They explained that Germain had stolen a sedative from a nurse and used it on me. By the time security arrived, he was already in the elevator. He escaped the building, hijacked a school bus, and crashed it into a bank—straight out of a movie, one with a man in a suit and a psychopathic clown.

The police shot him. He survived.

They brought him back to the same hospital, restrained this time, while legal teams decided what to do with him.

I needed hours to process what had happened. Eventually, my supervisor and I agreed that I should request medical leave. A couple of weeks. The shock was impossible to define—fear, anger, disbelief, something close to shame.

And yet, only a few hours into my leave, I realized something unsettling.

I already missed the night shifts.

I missed the corridors, the silence, the voices. I missed the people who had almost killed me—not Germain, but the others. The ones who told stories. The ones who reflected me back to myself.

That’s when I understood the most dangerous thing about the hospital.

It wasn’t that the madness was contagious.

It was that, at some point, it felt like home.
