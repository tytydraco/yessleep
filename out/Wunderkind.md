*My name’s Will. I got this story from my late grandfather. He grew up in a small town in Maine called Bernice. Don’t bother looking it up; you won’t find it, not any place like what my grandfather talks about. You see, Grandpa Mark was found at age 13 in rural Maine wandering aimlessly. He was covered from head to toe in blood, soil, and ash. He was recorded as having a blank thousand-yard stare. According to doctors at the time, he looked like he had crawled straight out of the Somme. He didn’t talk for two weeks, and barely ate or slept. He had to be placed in a hospital for that time. After he was allowed to leave and was placed with his aunt and uncle in Pennsylvania, he gradually overcame his trauma. Even then, though, he didn’t speak much about it. Recently, I got curious and asked about his upbringing and why he never talked about what happened to his home. It didn’t take much to get the story from him; he seemed to want to get it off of his chest. Still, in the following retelling, it was clear that it affected him deeply. I will only be including what he said, since any comments I made during the story are largely irrelevant.*


Is it on? Okay, good. Ah, damn. Sorry, Will. Just… Just getting a little shaky, is all. And when it comes to the kinda thing you’re asking about? Yeah, it’s really difficult. I’m a tough old bastard. I can tell you what you wanna know, I’ve just had a hard time trying to figure it out myself. Though some things are harder to think about than others, I guess.

Right, so, you wanna know about Bernice? And about Johnny? Alright, guess I’ll start from the beginning. So Bernice was a tiny little place in Maine. Real beautiful place to live, everyone knows each other, y’know how it is. Had all the essentials, couple of restaurants, a church, a supermarket, etc. The neighborhood where everyone lived was just outside the town proper, backing up against the woods. Lot smaller than what you’re probably used to seeing what with all of them big suburbs they have nowadays. A-anyway, Johnny. Sorry, I got a bit distracted. 

Johnny showed up in the neighborhood in 1970. I just turned thirteen the day he arrived. Heh. Fate has a helluva sense o’ humor, don’t it? The year my life went to shit was when I turned thirteen. So I was havin’ my birthday party outside. My friends and I were all outside when all of a sudden this kid just waltzed outta the woods and joined in. He must have been about twelve, looked like some kinda choir boy, dressed all nice and fancy. He was blonde, had freckles on his cheeks, and the most blue eyes you ever saw.

This kid, h-he didn’t look real. I mean, he looked like he walked off of some kinda Andy Griffith episode or something, know what I mean? Most kids, they got something up with them. Some bruises from roughhousing, messy hair, stains on their clothes, stuff like that. But not Johnny. No, Johnny was perfect, for lack of a better word. Too perfect. Second he walked into my yard he was saying hi to everyone, shaking their hands, really minding his Ps and Qs, know what I mean? Here’s the thing, though: I’d never seen this kid before in my life. Not ever. And as far as I knew, nobody else had met him. But the second he came out of those woods, all of the adults were acting like it was completely normal, like he’d been in Bernice as long as everybody lived there. When he walked up to me and told me happy birthday… Even then, when he looked at me and just said, “Hi, Mark. Happy birthday,” I was breaking out in chills. His eyes looked so damn empty, and his smile… It didn’t look happy. How do I put it? Y’know how some animals will “smile” to show you their teeth? That's what it felt like. Nobody else was remotely creeped out, or so I thought at the time. 

See, for the next few months, Johnny showed up at people’s houses completely at random, usually when they were having dinner or during a party or something like that. Sometimes he would attend church service, and even the pastor would pay more mind to Johnny than to his sermons, often asking Johnny to come up and lead the choir or do a reading. Nobody objected, nobody tried to stop him; they all just welcomed him wherever he went and whatever he did.

Yeah, I can tell this is weirding you out, kiddo. But that was just the beginning. Here’s where things began to take a turn. See, every town has its share of punkish teens, even a nice place like ours. There were four guys, Mike, Ed, Tyler, and Rick, all from, eh, 14-16. I mention that because it seemed like kids were the only ones in Bernice who weren't affected by Johnny’s “spell.” May 23rd. That was when things changed. See, Johnny was out, just strolling along the sidewalk in the afternoon and happened to come across those four smoking in a parking lot. I don't know what set the match to the grass, but Johnny said something, looking kinda smug when he did, and Mike went pale at first, like he’d seen a ghost. Then he got mad. He grabbed Johnny by the collar, and that was when it happened. One of the cars in the parking lot just… It turned itself on. It slammed into Mike at about sixty miles per hour, damn near crushed every bone in his body to paste. Johnny, meanwhile, was no worse for wear, and still smiling, and he just walked down the sidewalk. Then God as my witness, Mike pulled himself out from between the car and the wall he was pinned against. He didn’t even seem to understand how. His entire body was all twisted, bloody, and mangled, and he was crying. He didn't so much “walk” as “limp,” if even that. His friends couldn’t do anything, they just watched. I could tell they were scared shitless. Here’s the kicker, though. The whole night, he wandered those streets, crying and wailing for someone to help him, and eventually to kill him. Nobody did a thing, not even the cops. I couldn't sleep that night, obviously, not with hearing something like that. 

In the morning, he was gone, like Johnny’d gotten bored of him and thrown him away. Nobody talked about Mike except us kids. I asked my mom about what Johnny had done to Mike, and she just grabbed me and covered my mouth. “Johnny had to send Mike away for a while, sweetie,” she whispered, giving me the same smile she always gave when talking about Johnny. But that was day I realized that all along, she and all the other adults were afraid. Johnny hadn’t hypnotized them; he’d scared them to the point that they completely bent to his every whim. This kid, this happy, well-dressed kid had all of the adults so scared that he could have told them to run their dogs over, and they would have done it. 

After Mike, Johnny began changing the way he did things. Whenever a tyrant encounters even the smallest resistance in one person, he sees it in everyone. That was the case with Johnny. He would talk with people at the store, in church, on the sidewalk, and in their own homes, giving them this knowing look. He began asking very personal questions, very revealing questions. For example, Mrs. Hannigan two doors down was eight months pregnant. She wanted to keep it a secret for the time being. Johnny asked her during a neighborhood BBQ how little Carl was doing. Apparently, that was one of the baby names she was considering. His tone was very casual, but the way he looked at her and how pale her face became… Even when she smiled back and told him things were coming along nicely, I knew she was terrified. I didn’t know what about at the time, of course.

Then a month later, kids began vanishing, one by one. Ten kids aged 13 and under, *Poof!* Gone in the dead of night. And nobody said anything publicly. As far as the town of Bernice was concerned, those kids never existed. No photos, no evidence of anything. I tried asking my parents, but they acted confused about what I meant. I tried to press the issue, they snapped at me, saying the kids I was talking about didn’t exist and I needed to stop making up stories. They both had the look, though. They were both scared. 

One day, I was out biking and Johnny stepped right out in front of me. I damn near crashed into him, but I braked so hard my tires almost popped. Anything to avoid becoming another Mike. He looked at me with those damn eyes, and began talking about the missing kids. He was so damn casual, like he was talking about the weather. I knew just from the look he gave me that it was him. He did something to the kids, though I didn’t know what. But I remembered how terrified the adults looked, and I just pretended I didn’t know what he was talking about. He just chuckled and patted me on the shoulder. Then he said something that’s always stuck with me. He looked me dead in my eyes and his face became blank for the first time since he got there. Then he muttered, “Right. How could I forget? There never were any kids with those names. How silly of me. It’d be really silly to talk about kids that never existed, right, Mark?” He squeezed my shoulder just a little bit, but his grip… When I say it felt like he could dislocated my shoulder with just a tug, I’m not playing around. I nodded and agreed with him, and he just smiled, released me, and said to have a good day, and that was that. 

Things really began to go south when one of the kids that hadn’t vanished, 10-year-old boy by the name of Scott Lincoln, decided to throw a rock at Johnny. His brother was six, and he’d gone missing, so naturally he blamed Johnny for it. Unlike the rest of us, though, he was either more brave or foolish. Take your pick. Anyway, Johnny was just on one of his usual strolls through the neighborhood when all of a sudden a rock beaned him right in the forehead. Little Scott just started screaming at Johnny, tears running down his cheeks as he demanded that he give him his brother back. With how small the neighborhood was, we all saw it. We saw as his parents ran out all too late and picked him up to take him inside, but Johnny just told them, “Stop.” 

The skin on his forehead was split, and blood was leaking down his face. He wasn't smiling this time. He glared at them. Those eyes, kiddo, those eyes. If you’d told me the Devil was staring at them through Johnny, I’d have laughed at you. That wasn't a Devil; whatever was looking through Johnny’s eyes, it was something that would have brought Satan himself to his knees. That's the only plausible explanation for why he did what he did next. He walked up to Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln and said something too quiet for us to hear. For the family, though, it was clearly horrific. All three of them started crying and begging, but Johnny just pointed at their house like a parent telling their kid to go to their room. They all filed in, meek as sheep to the slaughter.  

When they were inside, Johnny yelled at them, “Turn it on!” Of course, we didn’t know what he meant until after the fact. Then he said the words that ended our town. 

“Light it.” 

All at once, the house went up. We all watched as the Lincolns’ house caught on fire. Before long, the windows were belching torrents of fire and smoke. We all heard the screams of the family inside. I’ve got a hunch he made them turn on the gas in their house, then strike a match. Johnny just turned his back to the house and looked at the rest of the neighborhood. We could all see him, grinning in front of that burning house like he had just lit up the damn Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, blood running down his face as his eyes gleamed with something unholy. 

That was also the night my mother explained to me in a hushed whisper why they had been so afraid of Johnny. Apparently, he came to town every twenty-three years. He would select ten kids age 13 and under to abduct at random, take them somewhere—the woods, maybe—and choose from one of them to use as a vessel. The rest he would leave on their families’ doorsteps as a skull covered in ashes. The body he was using now was her younger brother, she told me. I asked why she was telling me this now. She didn't answer, just kissed me on the forehead and told me she loved me. 

That night, I woke up to the sounds of mayhem. I looked outside and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Our neighborhood had formed into a mob, and they were all beating on Johnny. I guess seeing him bleed had emboldened them. Rocks, hammers, baseball bats, crowbars—you name it, they were beating him with it, screaming at him to bring their kids back. But no matter how hard they beat him, his bruised and bloody face kept that smile and those damned eyes just kept on shining. Then it happened. They all stopped. Then the parents among our neighbors walked back into their houses carrying their weapons. I heard kids screaming and immediate silence. The remaining neighbors began to beat on each other. Soon, the entire neighborhood, save for my own mom and dad, lay dead on the street or in their homes. He raised his hands like some kind of demented conductor, and every house erupted into flames except mine. He went up to them, grabbed my dad’s head and wrenched it from his shoulders. As my mom stood in silence, in shock that something wearing her brother’s skin had just murdered her husband. Then she got on her knees and began sobbing, begging him for something. He looked up at my house, but she stood in front of him. That was when it dawned on me. He’d been chummy with the other neighbors, but my family… He’d always been closest with my family during his stay. 

He wanted me for his new vessel. My mother kept begging him, and he seemed to consider it. Then he nodded, and she seemed to relax. I couldn't move. Not until Johnny strolled into my house, humming a birthday song, and came into my room. He told me, “Come on, Mark. I know it's really late, but I have a present for you.” My body went limp, and then I felt it move on its own. I began walking behind Johnny out to our woodshed. I—my body—picked up an axe. Johnny and I walked back around to my mom. She just sat there on her knees, then looked up at me with tears in her eyes and a smile on her face. She told me she loved me. She just barely got that sentence out before I chopped her with the axe. It wasn't until I was drenched in her blood that Johnny released whatever hold he had on me. I cried harder than I ever had. I kept hugging my mom, as if I could put her back together or something. 

Then Johnny exclaimed, “Surprise!” 

My grief turned to rage and I lifted the axe and buried it in his skull. Unaffected, he pressed his fingers to my forehead. My mom had made a deal with him: in exchange for allowing me to leave Bernice alive and without him possessing me, she would let him control me to kill her. I don't know why that satisfied him, and he still seemed annoyed that he couldn't use my body as a vessel, but in any case, he pulled the axe out of his head like he was pulling a thorn and said I needed to hurry. Then my house went up in flames, and in the split second I had turned around to see it, Johnny was gone. Just like that. So as Johnny’s fire destroyed Bernice, I just left. It felt like I was on autopilot. When I asked people about Bernice, nobody knew what I was talking about. My aunt and uncle always said I’d been involved in a very dangerous auto accident, that I was lucky to make it out alive and to have walked so far, but my mom and dad weren't so fortunate. Johnny not only destroyed an entire town, he erased it for everyone but me. I was the only survivor. 

You can make whatever you want of this story, Will. But I remember what I saw. I know Bernice existed. And I know Johnny is out there somewhere. Maybe he’s haunting another town. Who knows? I don't really know what morals or lessons you can take away from this story. Maybe there isn’t one. I guess I just wanted to tell it to someone Johnny hasn’t corrupted yet. 

*My grandfather died two years after this recording. It wasn't sudden; lung cancer caused by a lifetime of smoking, the doctor said. Here’s the weird thing about that: I never saw him pick up a cigarette my whole life. But everyone else said the same thing: my grandfather was a smoker until the day he died. Memories of Grandpa Mark had been altered for everyone but me. I quickly pretended to go along with it, though; the last thing I wanted was to be committed because I didn't think my grandfather smoked and a demon child poisoned his lungs with fumes from his burning hometown. That brings me to the reason I’m writing this. Grandpa Mark’s funeral was a week ago. It was a small, simple ceremony, since he had requested that his funeral not be extravagant and packed with everyone who ever knew him. There was one oddity about it, though. During the ceremony, I saw a kid who wasn’t accompanied by parents or any other guardians. When he saw me, he smiled. He had impeccable blue eyes and a perfect complexion, save for an old wound that ran down his forehead. When I asked around about who the kid was, he’d vanished.*

*Who or whatever “Johnny” is, I now know he’s real. I know he wiped the memory of my grandfather’s town. I know he’s responsible for innumerable deaths in Bernice alone. What I don’t know is if he’s decided, with Grandpa Mark’s death, that I should be next in line for his torment. I’m terrified about that, though. For the sake of my wife and my three-year-old daughter, I’m terrified.*
