I spoke too soon. I thought getting my experience about the wild animal and the dark round object out would put this to rest, but I was so wrong. On Wednesday at around 8 PM, I was PMed by a Redditor who claimed they had the same experience back in March 2018. Here's what their message read:


“I read your post about your friend, Samuel, and all that chaotic stuff with the police and that animal that attacked you. I'm glad I'm not alone in this. In March 2018, I was sitting in my backyard when a circular dark object landed feet away. It was within the shine of my backyard's light. It was just jet black and shiny. I didn't have the exact same experience as you though. Instead, I woke up in a hospital bed and was told I was found passed out and bleeding heavily on the sidewalk outside my house. I had no idea what happened, so after being released from the hospital, I asked each of my neighbors if they saw me outside that night. They each told me the same thing. That they slept peacefully the entire night. That they hadn't been woken up by a single thing.


Your post reminded me of that, and it's something that's always stuck with me. Hopefully you'll find out what happened to you and your friend.”


On Thursday, I found a USB drive with an attached sticky note lying on my doorstep. Here's what the note read:


“Play me”


Did Anthony give me this? I should play whatever's on it so my house won't be haunted by a three headed ghost. Back in my living room, I took the drive inside then inserted it into my phone. A video file popped up. I tapped it, then it began to play.


A wrinkly bald-headed man was speaking in what sounded like a mix of English, French, and Korean. There were English subtitles along the bottom of the screen. There were some light translation-related errors, but here's what they read:


“Hello. This may not seem within the ordinary, but here it is. On September 1, 2003, you were subject to unfair treatment by a few individuals and a dog. You may recall a fellow named Samuel Furtado being arrested by unmarked men in tactics gear. If you remember this event, write the word “Yes” on the sticky note attached to the drive, make sure the sticky note is still attached to the drive, then leave the drive where you discovered it. You must arrive at a spot 500 feet from Ninevah Road, one mile away from North Road Ridge East. Passing notes is easier under our current conditions. If you cannot meet at that spot at the designated time, write a good time and location on the sticky. Then leave the drive, with the note attached, where you found it.”


They knew Samuel?! They have answers?! Yes, please! I followed the instructions, then continued on with my night. I looked the location up. It was in the middle of a field outside of town. The next morning, I checked my doorstep to find the USB was gone. No sign of the sticky note either. Hopefully this would lead somewhere good and conclusive. I need Samuel back. There's so much to catch up on with him.


I texted two of my friends, Charlie and Anthony, telling them about the USB… the video… then asked them if they wanted to meet me in the spot I agreed to be in. I had already told them about the night Samuel was arrested… the website he looked at… the night I was bitten and encountered that round object… Anthony was enthused about the object and the website. It inspired him to write fictional CIA articles about aliens, higher dimensions, and alternate realities. He showed me you don't need a narrative to make something interesting, but I am hungry for more. Charlie isn't a believer in aliens, and thinks the UAPs in those videos the Pentagon released are balloons… because the military is dumb enough to misidentify a balloon, right? I can't convince him, but he's so good on the defense side of things, I need him in case this is something else. They both responded, telling me they have time and they'd meet me at the spot.


We arrived at around 11 PM. It was pitch dark, aside from the flashlights from our phones. All I could hear was the chirping of crickets, until Anthony spoke. “You sure we're about to see a UFO?”


I chuckled. “It's crazy, I know.”


Charlie scanned the field with his light. “What should we do while we wait?”


We each talked about our day, no big deal. Anthony started talking about aliens... The discussion lasted around half an hour before I picked up on something strange. I looked behind me, then back at my friends. “You guys, the crickets stopped chirping.”


Charlie scanned the field again. “Yeah, it's so quiet right now. It's weird.”


I was then startled by a bone-chilling growl. Anthony and Charlie jumped and looked in the direction of its source. The grass was being ruffled with, which was when all three of us started running back to the road. As I ran through the cornstocks, I felt something breathing along my lower back. A pit formed in my stomach.


Around what had to have been 20 feet away from the road, a bright white light flashed into the corner of my eye. I tripped over some object, then landed on my right arm, in the dirt. What the hell? God, no… Dread overtook me as I anticipated a painful attack. I attempted to get back up, but it was as if every inch of my body was frozen. I tried to yell my friends’ names, but I couldn't speak.


The animal sniffed my legs, then my arms. Being unable to move makes an adrenaline rush so much worse. The animal sniffed my face, then it growled. As I anticipated the worst, I heard the loud pop of a gunshot. A second later, the animal fell onto me. Anthony spoke to himself.


“Is it dead?”


I couldn't speak. Anthony walked up to the animal with his phone's flashlight on. He aimed the light at the thing's midsection, then its head. Its head was touching my jaw, so Anthony’s light was shining right in my eyes too. He gasped.


“Oh my god.”


He kept the light on my face, remaining silent. After about 10 more seconds, I twitched. I was able to move my toes, my fingers, my hands, my head… Anthony sighed. “Okay, good. Dude, I thought I got you too. Something told me you were somewhere behind me.”


As I picked myself up, a bright flash of light caught my attention. I looked up and could make out the faint outlines of two round objects hovering by each other. My heart sank. I took a few steps back. Anthony aimed his light at each of them, only barely illuminating the things.


“Holy crap!” Charlie said.


One of the round objects started moving closer to me. I turned back and gunned for the road. Once I reached it, there was another flash of light. A loud boom followed, leaving me with ringing ears and heightened adrenaline. I sprinted across the road, then into the field of corn stocks. There was another flash, along with another boom. Then another. They got quicker, but I could only run so fast. Soon enough, each of the explosions were getting quieter. I looked back to see the two round objects chasing after each other. One of them was flaming, then got hit with an explosion. They're… fighting? I was told to be in this spot. Or, well, in a spot north of this spot. What was I supposed to do?


The flaming object hovered towards me. As I prepared to continue running for my life, it was struck again, then fell to the ground… making a metallic thud as it landed. The object that won was still in the sky, while the object that lost was burning away in the field.


“I did not expect to see anything like this. What the hell is happening?” Charlie said.


“I knew they were real! Fuck yes!” Anthony said.


“I've… never seen anything like that before. I thought I was about to die…” I said, trying to process the fact I just witnessed two objects from who knows what planet warring with each other.


As I contemplated getting the hell away from the area, I heard a voice like my own inner voice, but deeper. “Hello. We apologize. We were subject to an act of terror we had to defend ourselves from. We will ensure this will never happen again. You will be given the support you need at another time. We'll give you a sheet of paper so you can write a time and location that both respects your mental wellness as well as our guidelines for visiting this planet under our current conditions. Distance yourself away from this location as soon as possible before the crashed vehicle gets any special attention from your local governing agencies.”


I took their word for it, then called out to my friends. I found Anthony standing 20 feet away from the fiery wreck, filming it with his phone. Charlie, holding a gun of his own, put his hand on Anthony's shoulder and told him it was time to go. I would've started filming too from where I was standing, but I felt the need to get away from the area as soon as possible. Soon enough, Anthony was done filming. We then made our way back to the road, found our car, then started making our way back to town. A minute down the road, flashing red and blue lights started moving in our direction. Soon enough, two police (or SWAT?) vans zoomed by us.


Charlie, sitting in the passenger seat, looked at me. I thought he was about to say something to me, but he then looked backed down at his phone. Anthony, in the back, sighed. “Another coverup.”


Once I got home, I checked my doorstep. Nothing yet. I came up with a good time and location, then carried on with my night. I'm glad my friends and I are safe. I'm not sure what those extraterrestrials want from me. It's bizarre I'm even in this situation to begin with. Also, Anthony told me he scooped up a small piece of dark metal in the field before we left. Now he's figuring out what he should do with it. Time will tell what happens next.


Also, I still don't know where Samuel is. However, whoever telepathically spoke to me gave me this hunch… one that doesn't feel like it belongs to me. A hunch that somebody will post information on here that will give me an answer. That better be soon.
