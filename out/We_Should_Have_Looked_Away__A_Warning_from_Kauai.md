We’ve been coming to Kauai for nearly 40 years now, ever since our honeymoon in 1983. This island has always felt like our second home. We’ve traveled here every year, stayed at the same quaint little cottage near Hanalei, where the mountains meet the sea. Hawaii has always been our paradise, our sanctuary. We’ve always felt at peace here, embraced by the island’s beauty and serenity. But this time… this time was different.

My wife, Margaret, and I are both in our early 70s now, retired, and we thought this would be just another peaceful getaway. But something was different this time - an uneasiness in the air, like the island was holding its breath. We couldn’t put our finger on it, but we felt it from the moment we arrived. The locals, who usually welcomed us like family, seemed distant, almost afraid. We should have taken that as a warning, but we never asked what's wrong.

Three nights ago, we woke up to the sound of drums. It started as a low, almost inaudible thrum that vibrated through the air. I checked the clock, it was 2:13 a.m. Margaret stirred beside me, and we both sat up, listening.                         The drumming grew louder, more insistent, like a heartbeat echoing from deep within the earth. It was coming from the beach, the place we had always gone to watch the sunset, to feel the breeze in our hair.

“I don’t like this,” Margaret whispered, her voice trembling.

But I was curious. I had heard stories over the years, tales of the so called "Night Marchers", the ancient Hawaiian warriors who march through the night, bound to protect sacred lands. They say if you hear their drums, you must never go to them, never look at them. But what were we supposed to do? Just stay inside, trembling like children?

I told Margaret to stay behind, but she insisted on coming with me. We grabbed our flashlights and cautiously stepped outside, drawn to the sound like moths to a flame. The night was eerily still, the usual chorus of frogs and crickets absent, as if the island itself was in mourning. We made our way down the narrow path through the jungle, the drums growing louder with each step. The air felt thick, heavy with a tension that pressed down on us, making it hard to breathe. When we finally reached the clearing, we saw them.

A procession of figures, marching in perfect unison across the beach. They were dressed in ancient Hawaiian garb, their faces painted with something that seemed to absorb the moonlight rather than reflect it. Some carried torches, their flames unnaturally bright against the dark sky. Others held spears, their tips glinting like they were  ffreshly sharpened.

And then we made the mistake that would seal our fate. We looked into their eyes.

I can’t describe what we saw in those eyes. It wasn’t just the glowing, ember-like intensity; it was the feeling that something ancient, something far beyond human, was staring back at us. It was as if the night itself had come alive in those eyes, filled with a cold, unrelenting rage. They were the eyes of something that never stopped existing, even when the world moved on. Margaret gasped, and I reached out to pull her back, but it was too late. The drumming stopped abruptly, and the night fell into a silence so deep it was like the world had been muted. The Marchers halted, their heads all  snapping in our direction. All at once, the torches flickered out, plunging the beach into darkness. We couldnt move. We couldn’t breathe. It was as if the air had been sucked out of the world.

 And then they started to move towards us.

I grabbed Margaret’s hand, and we ran. We ran like we were running for our lives - because we were. The drums started again, faster this time, chasing us back through the jungle, their rhythm matching the frantic pounding of our hearts. The path seemed longer than before, twisted, as if it was trying to trap us. We burst into the cottage, slamming the door behind us, but the drums kept coming. We could feel them, inside our heads, vibrating through our bones. Margaret was crying, muttering prayers under her breath, but I knew it was no use. We had looked at them. We had seen them. And now they would never stop hunting us.

The following day, we tried to leave, but our car wouldn’t start. The roads out of Hanalei were blocked by landslides that hadn’t been there the day before. We were trapped, with nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Last night, the drumming started again. It was closer this time, just outside the windows. I could see shadows moving at the edge of the curtains, and I knew they were waiting for us. Margaret hasn’t spoken since. She just stares at the wall, her eyes wide, unblinking, as if she’s already been claimed by them.

I don’t know how much longer we have. The drums are louder now, relentless, like a death march that’s leading us to our doom. We made a terrible mistake by looking at them. I don’t think they’ll ever let us go. If anyone reads this, please, listen to the warnings. Don’t be curious. Don’t be foolish.

And whatever you do, ~never~ look into their eyes.

Because once you do, you’ll never escape. They’ll take you too, just like they’re taking us.
