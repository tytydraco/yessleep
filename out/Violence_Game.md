While writing this story, Storm Bert and Storm Darragh made their passing over the UK, where I live. It's been some of the most violent weather I've ever seen.

I live on top of a hill, so I'm used to the wind. But it's been *really* windy.

I vape and I'm not allowed to smoke in my building, so I step outside. One morning, I exit to a horrendous howling. There are leaves flying, the stream from the garden fountain is disintegrating. Everything is warped by the tremendous energy.

\-an apt metaphor for how it feels to be a child.

**Tremors**

I can't start my story without first mentioning Will. This was my mother's boyfriend at the time.

I don't recall how they met or anything like that, I was too young to pay attention to those details.

He was a tall, broad-shouldered man. Ethnically white, but with that holiday-tanned skin, if you know what I mean. He was handsome, I suppose. Though, his face was weathered with some indents.

I was a small, brown-haired, brown-eyed boy when me, him and my mother moved into a new house together, when I was seven.

Me and my mother had lived in a few places up to that point. Sometimes with family members, but most recently in a council house.

This new place was a step up from that. It was a privately-owned, detached house in a quiet cul-de-sac. A fresh new building.

It wasn't particularly big by the standards of most homes, but it was to me and my mother - at least three times the size of what we were used to.

But it was also unfinished. There wasn't any paint or wallpaper or carpets inside.

Will was a carpenter. The idea was that he would be taking time off work to fix it up and make it more liveable, and mum would help him before they both went back to employment.

Despite the work needed to be done, we moved in immediately. We had beds, and that's all a house really needs when you break it down.

At first, I didn't think much of Will. He was just an extra person in mine and my mother's lives.

I recall the first few days we stayed there going fairly smoothly. Will and mum were working on the house while I played with my toys or expended my energy moving around in the empty spaces. All while grainy sun rays passed through the glass of the newly-fitted windows.

Bad things don't always happen quickly; that might be what makes the headlines, but what about all the things that happen behind closed doors?

In truth, a lot of bad things happen very quietly, at low frequencies. They are like barely detectable tremors, not always dangerous in themselves but act as warning signs of what is to come.

For me, that was my arm being grabbed a lot tighter than I was used to. Or a grunt of disapproval with no opening for criticism or explanation. A whack on the shoulder that made me cry and also confused as to what I had done wrong.

It seemed Will did not like me. Not a bit.

He played the early game well, masking his dislike for me so subtly that not even I - the target - could tell what was going on. Certainly my mother couldn't tell.

In the beginning, she may have made a comment or two about him being less rough with me, but that's as far as it got. And he - knowing she disapproved - made sure to space out his little attacks on me so it never became a topic of discussion.

I'm unsure how long this phase lasted, before it got worse. It's difficult to say. But I remember there being a tipping point, where the game reached its next level.

There was a moment in the kitchen. It was evening.

Me and Will were sat at the dinner table. It was a small, circular table, barely able to fit all of our plates. My mother was facing away from us, doing something over the kitchen counter.

We were both finishing our meal, when he moved his hand across the table and tapped my plate.

When I looked up, his face contorted into something genuinely frightening.

It was one of those faces that was guaranteed to make a baby cry, but for a seven-year-old it was more perplexing than anything.

*Why is he doing this?*

Like a deer caught in headlights, I found my eyes glued to his face. His jaw, strenuously contorted into a vision of rage and malice. His eyes, wide with wrath.

For almost a minute, he kept that face, unflinching, staring directly at me from across the table, and by the end of it, I wanted to cry.

It was only because my mother asked a question that his face returned to normal. Then, he got up from the table with his plate and walked over to her, as if nothing had happened.

I think seeing the fear and confusion in my eyes that night, really gave him a taste for it. Because it may have been as soon as the next day that the face returned. And it would keep returning.

It was always when my mother was distracted or in another room. He'd lean on the wall, staring at me. Or, as he walked past me, he'd turn quickly and flash a vision of horror so close to my face that it was almost a headbutt.

I found this experience very unpleasant, as you can imagine, but he was always very good at making things seem like not a big deal.

I think I may have even mentioned the face once or twice to my mother, but Will was always there to offer an explanation; it was a joke; it was just us messing around.

Think of those horror films where only the main character can see the ghost, and no one believes them. That's how it felt.

The snarling teeth and bulging eyes communicated terrible things. Sometimes it felt like he was moments away from breaking out into a frenzy, and if I so much as breathed too loudly, I was dead.

The faces were only the beginning. They were tremors.

**My Broken Lighthouse**

My mother conceived me when she was just twenty, through a caesarean pregnancy. Yes, that doctor sliced open her belly and yanked me out into the world. I must have been crying and screaming and so confused.

I don't even remember how she met my dad, but I know they were both party heads; drugs, alcohol, sex. This was in the late 90s, not that every generation isn't exactly the same.

I think it's safe to say it was an accidental pregnancy. Neither of them were prepared to bring a child into this world. *My father was so not ready that he didn't want anything to do with either of us.*

Young and dumb.

I can't say what it's like to have a child at that age. I've told myself that I would do whatever it takes to make sure my child was safe and happy, but you never really know how you're going to behave, do you?

We all have some idea now through the popularization of psychology how generational trauma can operate. People infect those around them with their fears and paranoia, who in turn infect others.

Our family had a lot of problems. It still does, and will do probably long after I'm dead.

If I had to describe her soul I'd say it was in a state of agitation. Sometimes free and content, even serene, but too often trapped in a state of irritation and upset. It didn't always take a lot to trigger her.

Because of this, she wasn't the easiest person to get through to. And being distracted by her inner turmoil gave her blind spots to reality.

She held na√Øve beliefs that this man we'd moved in with would cure her of all her problems and we'd live happily ever after.

It was in those blind spots that Will looked for his opportunities. I remember how he'd bring her flowers and act like a sweetheart.

She may have been infatuated with him. Nonetheless, I knew the safest place for me was always by her side.

That was the first "trick" I learned in this game between me and Will: stay close to mum. Of course, it wasn't a mind-made trick, but one borrowed from an ancient instinct. From a mysterious time where predators and monsters lurked in the shadows.

*Where are you going? Can I come too?*

I didn't think about it, but Will must have known there would be a time when me and him would be left alone. Where he would be called upon to babysit me, even for an hour. And that's what happened, eventually.

Maybe it was two weeks after we'd moved in, maybe it was four, I forget.

It was another evening. There was an energy in her, a restlessness. I could sense her wanting to leave the house.

I don't remember the reason for it. Maybe she was meeting a friend.

I was not comfortable with her decision, yet I couldn't fully articulate why, me not being aware yet of the grave danger I was in.

"Please don't go, mummy. I will miss you!" But she had to go. She had to be free of me and this house for a while.

After she left, I played with some toys I had in the living room as the last of the sun burnt its way across the sky. The house was quiet, apart from Will working upstairs.

I distinctively remember the thud of his work boots descending. Slow and paced, as if choreographed.

The light coming through the front door cast his shadow through the hall, until he appeared in the doorway, holding a tool and a dirty cloth.

He stared at me with a devious smile carved onto his face.

And then he did something terrible to me.

It wasn't anything sexual, but it was something awful I wouldn't soon forget. And afterwards, he made me wear a long-sleeved t-shirt to hide it.

My mother walked back in through the front door a couple of hours later, oblivious to the whole thing.

I was planning on running up to her and giving her a hug, but Will immediately went to greet her in the living room.

By the time I peered in to see what she was up to, they were watching TV together.

**The More the Merrier**

It had been one month since me and mum moved into the house with Will.

The carpets were down, the paints were spread, the doors were hinged-on. The only place not yet totally finished was the kitchen, where half of the floor tiles were missing and a wooden frame of a wall yet to be built stood erect almost in the centre.

Yet, the apparent increase in homeliness did not serve to soothe the ESP that now lurked. On the contrary, the whole place felt more eerie and empty than ever.

The approaching night drained the house of all its colour. The pervading silence was only disturbed by the war cries of distant birds.

I felt the pangs of despair while playing with my toys on the new carpet. While looking out of the window. While eating dinner at the small circular table we hadn't yet replaced.

Every day dragged on, though there was at least a reassuring reliability to it. Will and mum were always either working on the house or watching TV. And somewhere in between these things, we'd all sit for dinner once a night.

The bruise on my arm had faded by then, but it still hurt to touch. I'm not sure if it occurred to me then that it could happen again, but perhaps the monotony of the proceeding days had made me forget. Forget how brutal Will had been to me, how he silently promised me terrible deeds.

Maybe I was confused by the fact that he seemed to be acting normal now. It had been a week since he cornered me in the living room, and in that time he had not shown me that horrible face. Nor had he handled me roughly, or even spoke to me that much.

I think a part of me may have even believed, in a na√Øve hopeful way, that the worst was over.

Another few days passed by fairly uneventfully. Then, a surprise visitor arrived - one of mum's friends.

I remember the feeling of relief that came with having someone else in the house. For a moment at least, the eerie energy seemed to evaporate, giving way to a cosiness that I'd long-since forgotten existed.

I recall her being quite friendly, crouching down to give me a hug and a kiss as she walked through the door.

It was fascinating to see Will interact with a person that wasn't me or my mum. Even at my young age, I could tell he was putting on an act.

As he walked around with my mum and gave this woman a tour of the house, I knew something wasn't quite right. He seemed a lot nicer, more energetic. I'd never seen him smile at me so kindly before, as I did in the presence of that woman.

For the entire time she was there, we were living in a completely different world.

Then, the front door shut, and I remember a wave of unease spilling across my body.

As the disparity in feelings echoed back and forth in my mind, I suddenly realised what I had to do.

I needed to get more visitors.

Unfortunately, what seemed like it could have been the solution to my problem quickly curled into a dead end, as my mother rejected my enquiries into possible guests with one rational explanation after another.

We were just too far away from all of our old friends, and this lovely visitor we'd had, who had brightened all of our lives, was just a passerby - an exception to this law of isolation that had somehow been imposed on us here.

It appeared we weren't going to get any other visitors for the rest of this week, and dates for the foreseeable future lay bare.

It was a bleak revelation, one that put the chills back into my spine. But there was hope that this lady's presence had changed Will for the better.

I was about to learn the hard way.

It was as soon as the very next day.

Mum had gone out on a shopping errand and left me and Will in the house together again. So much time had passed now with Will behaving innocuously that I had forgotten the game we were playing.

I didn't realise the house around me transforming into a hellscape of nightmares, with a demonic warden who was coming to get me.

This time I was in my bedroom, and he came in unannounced. He said some mean words, then he started hurting me. There was no foreplay, so to speak - just a blur of pain and horror.

Before, when we were in the living room, I had whimpered and sobbed. This time, I was screeching, begging him to stop.

I was beaten, burned, shoved, thrown and punched. And he let me know that it was my fault.

I was a "thick skull", a stupid kid. I was always getting in the way.

He left me crying on the floor of my bedroom for a long time, only returning to tell me to keep my mouth shut, and to remind me that these bad things wouldn't happen if I wasn't such a bad, stupid kid.

When mum came home, I didn't even go downstairs to say Hello. I thought maybe if I stayed in my bedroom she would sense something was up, and check in on me. Then, maybe she'd recognise my broken body. She'd get cross, confront Will, and we'd leave together immediately.

None of that happened.

Instead, her and Will unpacked the shopping bags together and went into the living room to watch TV.

I was left believing the only thing I could: that everything Will had said was true.

I was vermin.

**The Safe Place**

*Hickory dickory dock. The mouse ran up the clock.*

After a couple of months the house was almost complete, and my mother now had a job, which was due to begin soon.

This meant it was time to face Will one on one, since he would be babysitting me while my mother was gone during the daytime.

You'd think with how helpless and useless and stupid I was, I hadn't prepared a tiny bit for this moment. However, you'd be slightly misinformed.

Even though I was a cowardly rat relying on mummy rat's presence, I wasn't about to die because she had to leave the house.

Ever since forever ago, when we'd first arrived together in this house, it had been ruled by the house cat. Through private intimidation and violence.

It's the house cat's house, and he'd played by its rules. So much that his own world had been warped.

There was a catch, though; no, a latch - on the door of the bathroom. It was the only door in the house with a lock.

That was, at least, something real. Something tangible in an otherwise incorporeal landscape made only of fear.

And little ratty had been rehearsing. Not physically, not really mentally either. But some unconscious part of him had been calculating his survival while he stared at the white paint on the back of that door.

I didn't understand why. I didn't understand when. But I just knew it would come in useful one day.

I knew that as soon as my mother left the house, I needed to be inside the bathroom with the door locked. I knew I needed to pretend to be on the toilet. And I knew I needed to stay inside until she got back.

So, I sat on the lid of the toilet seat with my heart thumping. My mother, miles away, with only me and Will in the house.

And, it worked. Will never came up.

It also worked the second time, and the third; the house cat barely made a sound.

In the meantime, little ratty kept a close eye on mummy rat. He hung out on the stairs, parallel to the living room doorway, and listened. Listened to their conversations, checking for any sign of mummy rat disappearing.

One time, she was about to leave, but ratty knew and was already in the bathroom by the time she left.

It became his sixth sense. Knowing when mummy rat would go away.

Little ratty managed to clear a full week before the house cat became restless.

He heard the house cat making its way up the stairs slowly, until its shadow peeked just underneath the gap at the bottom of the door. Sometimes it breathed heavily and made strange demonic noises.

Ratty was terrified, but with a piece of wood between them, physically unaltered by these exchanges.

For a short while, the game of cat and mouse was coming up mouse.

In the evenings, while the rat mother was home, conversations about sending little ratty off to school were moving forward. The sun shone a little brighter through those windows.

The simple trick of hiding behind a locked door had empowered ratty and given him hope. He even got so comfortable to bring his toys in the bathroom with him so he could wait out the day without being bored or consumed by anticipation.

Ratty wondered, as he had done a few times before, if the game was over now.

Just as he did so, the bathroom door creaked open.

The monster known as Will was standing there, his expression the amalgam of a hundred ancient beasts. 

He grabbed ratty by the scruff and plunged his head into the sink, trying to drown him, but somehow ratty slipped away and ran down the stairs.

The house cat pursued with lightning speed, practically leaping the whole flight of stairs to catch him.

The chase continued into the back garden, where ratty found himself cornered by two tall hedges.

He begged the house cat not to eat him, but was swiftly silenced and dragged back into his cage.

Ratty saw the monster, and he saw his family behind the monster. He tried to ask them to help him, but he could no longer make a sound.

With the bathroom door sabotaged, ratty was forced into a horrific cycle of near-death experiences for the next week while his mum went to work during the days.

He was electrified, severed, crushed, and bound to the furniture for interrogation purposes.

Why was he such a worthless rodent? So terrible at making people happy. Irritating and shrill.

Even so, ratty didn't want to quit. To concede would be death, and despite everything he was still committed to being alive.

Mummy rat come home soon. I'll be in my room.

*Hickory dickory dock.*

**The Truth**

My mother had failed me, but so what? A bridge sometimes collapses. Train tracks warp and cause accidents.

We expect so much of people, when they're really not that well-equipped. So blind are they. So distracted.

Barely alive. Barely conscious of what they're doing.

I could barely speak, barely eat. It's his sore throat, Will said.

Most of my toys had been destroyed and trashed, not that toys could distract me anymore; the danger and the terror had escalated to a point beyond that.

I left the house while they were watching TV one night. Took a walk down a wooded path. Found myself taking off all my clothes to let the rain hit my burns.

To this day, I don't know why I did that, but it was the sanest thing I ever did. I spent some time burying my head into the leaves and crying. Though my face was covered in dirt and I was stinging all over, I felt peace and solace.

I returned quietly with neither of them noticing I'd been gone for over an hour.

I walked straight into the living room and sat between them - my mother and Will.

"Mum, I have something to tell you." I said, over the sound of the TV.

Will looked over with his mouth poised to interrupt, but before he could -

"I love you." I said, wrapping my arms around her.

"I love you too, darling." She replied, kissing me on the forehead.

The next day was a weekend day. In the living room was me and mum, where everything shone in the early light. Will was in the kitchen, attempting to finish his job.

I decided spontaneously in that moment to tell her everything. As Will was out of earshot, I told her all the things he had done to me and promised to do.

Then she summoned him into the living room. As he stepped through the doorway, somehow he didn't seem so powerful anymore.

As mum repeated what I'd said, and pushed him on it, he seemed to do little more than shrug.

Their relationship ended right there and then.

The game was finally over.
