**We stood, all** of us, staring at the lump of skin and bone beneath the blanket—the small cot that served as his near-final resting place. Once he had been strong, a man who commanded labor and obedience with the iron of his voice and the weight of his hand. Now he lay crumpled, rasping like paper torn by the wind, and all of us knew his hour was at hand. None spoke of it, though each of us owed him our breath, for his will had ruled this house like scripture carved in stone.

The air sagged heavy with silence. The walls still bore the memory of his voice, sharp as the crack of a whip, and of the terror that lived here—quiet now, but not gone. The house groaned against the night wind, timbers shifting like tired bones, and outside the window the black fields pressed close, as though the land itself had come to listen.

The woman who sat at his side—our mother, our grandmother—kept her eyes to the floor, the tears shining on her wide cheeks. She had walked beside him, given him her beating heart, and still she gave it now, even as he lay dying. But his last words to her had not been of blessing, nor remembrance, but accusation. *Guilty*, he had called her. *Guilty…*

The clock tolled in the plain room where God was meant to dwell, but the sound rang hollow, as if even heaven had withdrawn. No herbal medicines stood on the shelves, no worldly thing to soften pain or prolong life. He had forbidden such comforts. We had lived apart, set against the world, clothed in restraint and suffering, because he willed it so. Yet tonight the silence was broken by thoughts we dared not confess—the things we could have done but did not do, the ways we might have saved him had we chosen otherwise. But each of us knew the truth: to save him would have been her sentence.

“He drove me to it,” she cried, voice low and ragged. “Would he have shown mercy to an old woman? *No*. He would have turned me over to the elders. You know it. You have seen his anger, you have felt it. Not one of you was spared his hand. Not one. And yet I stood before him, again and again, so that his wrath might fall upon me instead of you.”

Her words fell heavy, but they did not sound like confession. They rang like invocation, as though she spoke to powers older than the Book itself, powers that had listened long in silence and at last had answered. We could not answer her. We knew the truth of it, though we longed to turn away.

So we stood and watched him bleed and gasp, and none of us lifted a hand. His sin had met its end upon the staircase, brittle bones snapping as judgment finally caught up with him. Yet as his breath rattled out for the last time, the clock struck once more—though no hour was due—and the sound clung to the rafters like a curse.

It was not the first time a father had died in this house with anger in his mouth, and we feared it would not be the last. His shadow lay long across the floorboards, and in it we saw our own faces reflected—hardened, unyielding, waiting to rise when our turn came.

 **I turned** to the clock to see if the face was true, and it was. Yet my own reflection looked back at me, pale and painted in fear, and a chill threaded through my spine. Margaret clutched at my arm.

“Is the thing possessed, Edward?” she whispered, careful that the others should not hear her—the others who wept and wailed and mourned around the cot. My heart was breaking too, for the love I bore my grandfather was pure, and I had never held ill toward him. Yet this chill I felt could not have seeped through the walls. We sweated through our clothes, the fire’s heat hammering against our skulls, the flames leaping like demon-fire, as though the pit itself had been stoked and risen into our room.

“Steady, Margaret,” I whispered back, though my voice carried a harshness I could not temper. The air seared my throat, every breath a mouthful of ash. “Come—we must leave this room of torment and death. It shall be upon us soon enough.”

When I stood, a host of stares fastened on me—my family, their names carved upon my heart, their faces fixed in hopelessness. I would never forget their eyes, nor the way the fire painted their grief into masks. I looked from the motionless body of grandfather to her, to grandmother, and I asked gently, “We must have some air. If nothing else, the cold will help us. Will you join us?”

The woman shook her head, her tears shining. “Soon enough I will be no more, Edward. Let me rest with him a little longer—God rest his soul.”

So Margaret and I fled to the door and stepped out onto the wooden porch. The night struck us at once, cold as water from the grave. It clung to our damp clothes, needled our skin, and our breaths burst into clouds that twisted and vanished into the dark.

There, outside the threshold, she clutched me fiercely. “I’m sorry, Edward, but I am glad to have you. Promise me you will remain true, and good, and kind, as you always have been-that is why I fell in love with you.” Her eyes pleaded in the starlight. The grief had undone her, yet in her words I heard more than grief. It sounded like a vow, heavy as any scripture, as though heaven and earth leaned close to hear whether I would keep it.

I held her, my arms firm around her, pressing her trembling body against mine so she would feel the twitch of every nerve. In that moment, she was not merely my wife but a soul bound to me by chains unseen. I kissed her there beneath the stars, our breath mingling in the cold.

“I swear to it, Margaret,” I told her. “I will stay true. I would sooner die than bring you harm. I will not live as my grandfather lived, for he is not me, and I am not him. His sins have brought ruin enough to her—to us all.”

“Is there nothing to be done now, Edward?” she whispered.

I shook my head, the motion felt against her cheek though the darkness hid it. “No. We must go inside and give our farewell. If we do not, they may follow us home—the dead may linger over us, pressing their thoughts into ours through the walls.”

“I would never endure that,” she breathed. “I would rather die.”

“Then remember this, Margaret—when death comes, shelter your eyes.”

We kissed once more, then turned. The door groaned as it opened, and the fire greeted us with a violent swell, as if it had been waiting for our return. Inside, the faces of my kin flickered in the glow, hollow-eyed and gaunt, their shadows stretched thin and long across the walls, like a procession of the damned.

 **Only the** crackling of the fire and the low sobbing of women filled the room. The light flickered across his face—his eyes sealed tight, his nose jutting like a broken peak. I remembered the stories he had told me when I was small, the stories of how that nose came to be.

Once, he said, a giant had chased him through the forests of the motherland, a beast older than Christendom, older even than the first word spoken into the dark. He had hidden among the roots while the brute tore the woods apart—ripping trees from their beds, snapping trunks between its black gums, grinding them into splinters and dust. The air was rank with rot, with the stink of carrion and damp earth, and above it all a red eye burned in the gloom, dripping snot and spit as it raged.

He had lain there silent, unseen, though the crash of its steps shook the soil against his bones. The smell of death pressed close, hot and sweet, but the monster passed him by. When it was gone and the forest stood broken and still, he opened his eyes and found himself alive. Only then did he discover his nose had grown—a gift, he claimed, to scent out harm long before it struck.

And he would always end the tale the same way: lifting his head, drawing a long, rattling breath, and sniffing the air for signs of the old giant who still, he warned, lingered in the shadows of the world.

But there was another part to the tale, darker still. He would whisper that he had not survived by his wits alone. Something else, something older than he, had hidden him—had cloaked his scent from the monster’s searching maw. A friend, he called it. A friend older than the sun and moon.

I felt it now in my pocket, the little thing he had pressed into my hand as a boy, claiming it was that same friend that had kept him safe. My fingers closed tight around it now, and I drew it out for Margaret to see. “Take it,” I told her, pressing it into her palm. “Hold it tonight. It will keep you as it kept him.”

She stared, wide-eyed, as though the object carried a heat of its own.

And then we heard it. A sound that split the night. At first like the bray of a horse, yet drawn out, sharpened, until it became a scream—a shrieking cry that pierced the marrow. It came from beyond the fields, yet it seemed to pass through the walls and the fire alike, and with it came the certainty: the reaper had arrived.

**Fear and murmuring** crowded the room, but the voices of my kin were hushed at once. A moan escaped Grandmother as her strength gave way, and she clutched at the corpse of the man who had been her shield. He remained still beneath the sheet, his sweat gone, his mask of pain fallen away. Peace alone lay across his face.

Then the footsteps came. Hollow. Deep. Not footsteps, but something heavier — the shifting of earth itself, the weight of the world pressed thin. The Collector approached. None could escape it. It was poison made flesh, ruin to the touch. We knew it lived beneath the crust, listening for us, for the beating of hearts like drums that must, in time, fall silent.

“Do not look upon it,” I whispered into Margaret’s ear. “Else it may choose you. Promise me.”

She pressed her face against my chest, nodding, trembling, while I bowed my head over hers, covering her with my chin. Between us she clutched the gift, and my hand pressed over hers, sealing it tight.

The room stilled. The fire crackled once, then dimmed. And the Death Keeper passed through the door. Not like a man entering, but like a draft seeping through rotten wood. A sound followed — a nail drawn slow across timber, splinters burrowing beneath our skin. The cold did not move; it froze, heavy and sharp, pressing into every corner.

Then we heard it breathe. A rasping, cavernous pull, like air dragged through broken reeds. Pain seared through us, needles driven into the bone. Margaret shuddered in my arms. I held her, but the torment did not relent.

And then the voice came. Croaking, rigid, but vast — echoing in my skull as though the very marrow had become a chamber for its words.

*“Who among you… has been named?”*

We held our breath. None dared to whisper. None dared to cry out.

The needles pressed deeper. Pressure bloomed behind my eyes, as if my skull would burst.

*“Who has stolen… from me?”*

Grandmother wailed, her voice breaking. “I—I have! Oh, have mercy on me!”

Her confession tore through the silence, but it came too late. She had waited, she had made Death ask twice. And in her hesitation, she had nearly doomed us all.

*“You are the accused?”*

Wind roared through the room, battering us, filling our ears until the sound became agony. My senses reeled; the world bent and fell away. We were no longer there. We were elsewhere — in a place without walls, without fire, without breath.

*“Then gaze upon death… and join me.”*

The voice rolled like thunder across the void, and I knew we were suspended in Death’s realm — a blackness vast and eternal. We did not look. We dared not. To see would mean solitude unending: a drifting, hollow absence, where even memory could not survive.

For this was Death’s punishment. This was its curse. Solitude without end. Death knew no laughter, no light, no touch, except when it was summoned to carry the dead. Only then could it feel again. Only then did it taste something other than the silence of eternity.

And to steal that moment from it — to cheat Death of its joy — was to invite its wrath.

I fought the urge to look, to see — oh, how strong it was, that pull to gaze upon Death without fear, to know its face. But I smothered the thought, buried it deep, while my legs drifted weightless in the void. Margaret clung to me, and I to her, as we floated in nothing, in the black house of Death itself.

Then something in my ears gave way, a crack, and the rush of wind flooded in. The silence broke like a dam. I felt the weight of my body again, the press of my feet against solid boards, the ache of my legs beneath me. The warmth returned all at once, scorching, as the fire snapped and roared, biting into the logs with its sharp red teeth.

The wailing rose up around me — my kin crying, torn by grief, mourning not one but two. Grandfather and Grandmother, gone both, their poor souls carried off together. One in peace, the other in punishment. For though it is noble to suffer, to bring suffering upon others is a crime even Death will not pardon.

I looked down at the cot. Grandfather lay as before, his face slack in eternal rest. But where Grandmother had sat — weeping, praying, pleading — there was nothing. Not her body, not her shadow. The chair stood empty as if she had never been.

I turned to Margaret and uncurled her hand. In mine, I opened my palm. Together we gazed upon the stone — the black rock, the strange gift Grandfather had once pressed into my hand, telling tales of giants and unseen friends older than the sun. Its surface was cold as river-ice, yet it pulsed faintly in my grasp, as though it had remembered the void and resisted it.

The talisman had spared us. It had hidden us, sheltered us, when Death walked the room. And now it bound us. Margaret and I would carry it forward through our days, through our labor, through our suffering. Whether it was blessing or curse, I could not yet know. But I knew this: it had chosen us.
