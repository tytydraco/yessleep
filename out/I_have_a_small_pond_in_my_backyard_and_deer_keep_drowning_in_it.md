Firstly, I just want to clarify something. I don’t care if you believe me; that’s not why I’m posting this. No, I’m posting this in the hopes that it can act as a sort of proof for the story I’m about to tell the cops. By the end of the day I’m writing this, I’m sure I’ll be charged with murder. But that’s skipping ahead a bit. The first deer stuck its nose in my pond about one month ago now. 



It’s not a huge pond, but big enough to go for a bit of swimming. I think it’s about six feet deep in the center, but I’ve never measured it. Just like it has every year, it froze over this winter and thawed back out in the spring. Unlike every other year, though, the first day the ice was gone, the deer filled in.



I’m no stranger to seeing deer in my backyard; in fact, I love looking out my window with my coffee in the morning and just watching them peacefully. I used to do the same thing when I was a kid, living in this old house with my dad. Something about the way these deer acted, however, was wrong. It was unnatural. 



They'd linger in front of the pond, just standing at the edge. They watched their own reflections in the glassy surface, lowering their heads closer until they dipped their noses into it. But they never drank it. They’d keep their noses under until I’d see a little burst of bubbles, then they’d skitter off.



I figured it was odd, but not anything to be concerned about, and it wasn’t every morning either. It was less than a couple of weeks until I woke up to the sound of a deer groaning along to the splashing of water. My clock said it was around two in the morning, and I heard it through the closed window beside my bed.



I groggily rolled over and tried to ignore it, but the noise continued. Grunts and bleating sounds, broken by the splashing of water, as what I was already sure was a deer found itself too deep in the pond. I dragged myself out of bed with a groan and peered outside. It was too dark to see any details, but through the shimmer of the moonlight, I could see some amount of movement in the dead center of the pond. I saw the water splashing, and the shape made one last cry before sinking with a gurgle. 



I felt bad, of course, but there was no way in hell I was going outside at two in the morning to try and save it. I didn’t even know how I *would* drag it out. I’d just call someone about it in the morning. So thinking nothing more about it, I went back to bed. 



After my first cup of coffee, and signing into my computer so my boss thought I was working, I gave animal control a call.



“-and how deep is the pond, sir?” The animal control worker asked, partially interrupting me as I explained what happened. 



“Uh, about six feet.”



“Okay, not a problem. We’ll send a truck over, but unless it’s an emergency, we won’t be able to get the deer out until it starts to float.”



“Oh, that's alright, I guess, no emergency. Why send a truck over, then?”



“Just to grab a sample of the water, with your permission. Shouldn’t take more than ten minutes of your time. He can give you more accurate information on when and how he can return to take care of the deer.”



“Alright, sounds good, thank you.”



“Of course. He’ll be over in between one and two hours from now. Have a good day, sir.”



They hung up before I could respond. 



I did whatever work I could, periodically peering out my windows to see if any deer were by the pond. None came today, and if I were a more superstitious man, I might have taken it as a sign. But I just drank more coffee, with a splash of cheap bourbon as my “creamer”, and did whatever busy work my boss had assigned me.



About three hours after I made the call, the big animal control truck pulled up beside my house. It was too loud, like it had a broken muffler, and rattled the glasses on my shelf. I opened my front door to greet him, and the man stepping out of the truck had a small look of surprise on his face.



“Oh, afternoon, sir! Sorry I’m a bit late, hope I didn’t keep you waiting.” He said, with a far too chipper attitude. I plastered a smile on my face and greeted him back.



“Good afternoon, it’s all good. I work from home, so I was just taking care of stuff on my computer. Here, the side yards are a bit iced over still, you can come through the house.”



“Thanks, just let me grab my test kit.” He walked over to the back of the truck and opened a compartment that held a few odds and ends I had a hard time distinguishing. He popped out what looked like a little plastic bucket, not dissimilar to a tackle box. “How’d you know I was here?”



“I think the whole county knows you're here,” I responded, nodding my chin up towards his truck.



“Ah, sorry about that. Been so long that I don’t even register the noise anymore. So let’s see this pond of yours.”



I led him through the house and out into my backyard. He saw the pond and all the weeds poking up around it and gave a low whistle.



“Bet it's beautiful in the spring, yeah?” he said, bending over the water and peering into it.



“Yep,” I responded. I’ve never been good at small talk, and I hoped I didn’t sound rude. 



He crouched down on one knee, still looking into the muddy water's surface. I saw his face in the reflection, looking back up at him, and if he thought I was rude, he didn’t show it. He sat there for a moment, then another, just looking into the water. After an awkward amount of time where I tried to think of something to say, I realized I should ask about the odd behavior the deer had been showing, but before I could, he startled me with a sudden question.



“You like seafood?” He asked. He pulled a cup out that looked like a cup you would piss in at rehab. I stood still, a little stupefied at his question, losing my train of thought.



“Yeah, it’s alright. Why do you ask?” I responded. He slipped on a pair of gloves and dipped the cup into the water, filling it before putting on a lid and placing it back in the bucket. Next, he pulled out a roll of thin, white paper.



“Just chatting, I suppose. I grew up on the East Coast, in a small town called Calabash, located more down south. Used to love the seafood there, especially the mahi mahi. Shrimp was my favorite, though, used to go right up to the fishermen's boats and buy bags right from ‘em. Freshest fish I ever had.”



“I never lived anywhere near that, but my dad loved fish. Whenever my mom wasn’t home, he’d make something with fish, I think mackerel. What made you think of seafood? I don’t keep the pond stocked.”



“I’m not sure. Just an old memory popping back up, maybe. Your mom doesn’t like fish?” He pulled the strip of paper out and segmented a piece. The man dipped it in the water and held it for a few seconds before pulling it out and giving it a little shake. 



“She didn’t, no.”



He looked up at me with a small smile and a raised eyebrow, like he expected me to continue. I didn’t.



He stood up and held the paper, now a different color, up to the roll where he could compare it wth a small chart of colors. 



“Hmm, alright. Doesn’t seem like anything’s off with the water, so that’s good. We’ll see what the lab says about the sample, though. I can get out of your hair now, Mr. uhh…”



“Wilson.”



“Mr. Wilson! Once that deer starts to float, give me a ring. Here’s my card.” He said, handing me a warm, slightly damp business card from his back pocket. “It’ll be easiest if I can back my truck up to the pond, if that’s alright.”  
  


“Yeah, that’s fine, thanks…” I looked down at the card, which only had his first name, “Jeff. I’ll give you a call again soon.”



He smiled warmly and reached his right hand to shake mine. I awkwardly looked down at my one hand holding my coffee mug, and my other hand holding his card. I tried to swap the mug into my other hand, but before I could, he noticed my predicament and gave me a gentle fist bump, almost making me drop it. 



“Have a good day, sir!” He said boisterously, cautiously making his way through the side yard. I took another look back at the pond, stepping close to the edge to see if there was anything in particular he was looking at. I couldn’t see anything, and it wasn’t until I heard his loud truck start up again that I realized I forgot to ask him my question. 



The rest of the day went no differently from all the rest, Jeff’s appearance the only unique thing about it. Once the rest of the hours blended into each other, and my work was done, I signed off and watched TV with a beer in hand until I eventually fell asleep. 



Maybe it’s because it was already on my mind, or maybe because I hadn’t eaten dinner, but I dreamed of food. Seafood, more specifically. I dreamt of the sizzle of the mackerel on the grill, the smell wafting in through the house's open windows. The crinkle of the foil as my dad wrapped it up to steam, with a sprig of parsley and a slice of lemon. How brightly my dad smiled when I said its eyes scared me. How fast his smile fell when my mom came home, yelling about the house reeking of fish and olive oil.



I woke up with a pain of hunger in my stomach and the cold feeling of a spilled beer in my lap. I stood up from the couch, shivering as a breeze blew past my body. The window was open. Finishing whatever dregs were left in the can as I walked, I looked out of it. Even in the dark, I could see there were no deer by the pond. 



I grunted and shut the window, feeling moisture on the sill as I did. There were a few small drops of water at the edge of the window, as well as on the floor of my house. I looked up at the sky outside, seeing the faintest glimpse of a cloud passing by the moon.



“Must’ve rained…Must’ve…” I tried justifying to myself. I’ll be honest, it left me a little shaken, not just the water, but the window being open at all. While the pond had thawed, it was still well below freezing after the sun went down, and not much above it while it was up. I hadn’t opened a window since before last Thanksgiving. I would have assumed it was an intruder if it weren’t for the lock.



Trying to tell myself I must have suddenly started sleepwalking, I cracked open a new can of medicine. Trying to look for something to eat, I settled on two packets of, funny enough, shrimp-flavored ramen. I changed into some new pants while the water heated up and attempted to enjoy the rest of my night. 



The next day, around noon, I could see the back of the deer begin to float in the pond. If I didn’t know any better, I might have confused it with a small, furry log. I gave Jeff a call, and he told me he and his coworker would be over in a few hours. As the course of the day went on, I peeked out the window whenever I walked by it. I saw the back of the deer slowly rise closer to the surface and begin to twist, to lie more on its side. It looked inflated, ready to burst.



By the time I heard Jeff’s truck driving down the road, the body of the deer was totally on its side. The head was mostly still underwater, as well as the bottom half of its legs. Jeff briefly introduced me to his coworker, Keith, and they backed the truck through my side yard up to the pond. 



“Damn, Jeff, you’re so *right*!” Keith exclaimed after taking a deep breath near the pond. 



“Right? I told you!” The chipper man responded as they both slipped on a pair of gloves and dragged some equipment out of the truck. It looked like they brought some rope, a pole with a hoop on the end, and some kind of collapsible cot. 



“Right about what?” I asked. 



“The smell,” He explained, reaching the pole out over the pond. Keith talked effortlessly as he looped it around the animal's head and began to pull it to shore. “You know?”



“N-no, I don’t?” I took a deep breath, trying to smell anything out of the ordinary. I didn’t catch a whiff of anything, not even the bloated deer, as the man cautiously rested it on the mud on the pond's edge.



“I couldn’t place what reminded me of fish when I was here yesterday, but on the way home, I managed to get it. Your pond smells like the ocean, Mr. Wilson. You don’t smell it?”



“No, can’t say I do. Just smells like mud and grass to me.” I responded. Jeff began to lay the cot out flat in front of the deer as Keith unhooked the deer from the pole. He placed it back in the truck and began to tie the rope around the deer's legs.



“Hmm, maybe you’re just used to it?” Jeff said. He stood up straight, looking deeply into the pond. “Kinda reminds me of a shucked oyster, that almost mineral scent.”



“I’ve never had oysters before,” I responded. Jeff continued to stare into the pond, wearing a puzzled expression on his face. “Actually, I had a question for you guys. Forgot to ask it, last time.” Jeff didn’t answer; he just kept looking.



After a brief moment, Keith caught that Jeff wasn’t planning on responding and gave him a confused look. “Ask away, Sir.” He walked to the truck and grabbed hold of the hook attached to the small winch.



“I’ve actually seen a bunch of deer acting strangely by my pond lately. They walk up and just stick their noses in until they need air, but they don’t drink it like they used to anymore.”



“Could be blue tongue. In fact, I’d be willing to bet; the deer doesn’t look injured.” The man said, walking the hook over to the deer and clipping it onto the rope.



“Blue tongue?”



“It’s a disease; most animals with hooves can get it. I forget the technical name, but I think it can come from a few things. Other animals with it can pass it on when they mate, little tiny flies can give it, or it could be infected water. That’s why Jeff here took some of your water back to a lab yesterday, for testing.”



“And that can make them drown themselves?”



“Sure,” He said. He walked back to the truck and rested his hand on the winch. “I’m sure Jeff can get more specific, but I think it makes them get a bad fever, and their instinct is to go in water to cool themselves off. Sometimes they stay in the water too long, exhaust themselves. Then they drown, right?”



Jeff still stood, his mouth slightly parted, and his brow was furrowed like he was focused on something. I took a step to the side so I was more within his field of view, trying not to get too close to the deer.



“Are you alright, man?” Both Keith and I stood still, watching him for the few seconds it took him to respond to me. He slowly turned his head to me, but his eyes didn’t seem to meet mine. I saw his lips were moving slightly up and down, and I swear I saw him lick them. 



“Y-yeah! Sorry, I got lost in thought for a bit there,” He said, perking up suddenly and letting out a hearty chuckle. He walked back over to the cot and held it firm, lifting the side opposite the deer like he was getting ready to scoop it up. “Go ahead, Keith.”



Keith and I made eye contact, both of us looking puzzled and a little worried. Without a word, he started the winch, and the deer was slowly dragged onto the cot. “Good!” Jeff said when it was about to slide over it. Keith turned off the machine and walked over with his back facing the pond.



Together they heaved up the deer and lifted it into the back of the truck. After a few minutes of strapping it down, tagging its ear, and giving me a small amount of paperwork, they were ready to leave. 



“Alright, Mr. Wilson, we’re all set here. Thank you very much!” Jeff said, this time actually managing to shake my hand. 



“For what?”



“Oh, um… letting us work? I was just trying to be polite.”



“Ah, sorry, my bad. Of course, and thank you for getting that deer out. Will you let me know if anything turns up in the water?”



“Of course, but it might take a little while. Just be sure to let us know if anything else happens in the meantime, okay?” 



“Alright, sounds good, thanks. Have a good day.”



They both waved at me and wished me a good day in return before getting in their truck and driving off. I could see the very top of the deer's belly jiggle as they drove from the back. It wasn’t even dark outside before the deer came back to the pond. 



I closed all my blinds and just tried to ignore them, not wanting to think about deer, my pond, or any other body of water for a while. For another week I did a pretty good job at it, too. I didn’t hear from animal control at all about the lab results, but if they didn’t decide to call me about my water, that was fine with me. Keith was alright, but Jeff had sufficiently weirded me out.



Unfortunately, my peaceful coexistence with my strange deer couldn’t last forever. One night, I woke up to hear the same noises again. The sounds of splashing water and an animal bleating. I wrapped my pillow around my head, trying to block out the noise, but to no avail. The grunting and panicked cries of the animal still found their way into my head, playing themselves on loop long after the gasps for air turned from gurgling to silence. I managed to fall asleep once more, but even in my dreams, I heard them.



After a restless night of sleep, my head broached the surface of my sheets, and I crawled out of bed. I stepped in a puddle. My bare foot slid slightly, and I caught myself on the windowsill next to me. It was closed, but also had a thin layer of water coating it, slightly more than last time. Jolting wide awake, I looked up at the lock on the window to see that it was still firmly in place. I drew my gaze to my ceiling to see that it was bone dry, no dripping leak to be found.



At this point, I had to force myself to calm down. I threw on some clothes and grabbed a drink before coming back to my room and looking around a little more closely. I checked under the bed, I checked my other window, and I even checked by the bathroom toilet. It was all dry, the water was only by this window, and on the floor on the side of the bed that I sleep on. 



I ran my finger through the water, bringing it up to my nose to smell it. It didn’t really smell like anything, and before I even considered what I was doing, I brought it up to my mouth to taste it. My finger stopped right before my lips as I realized what I was doing and just how stupid it was. I wiped my finger on my clothes and decided I would call a plumber or something. There just has to be a leak somewhere, there has to be.



While I was distracted by the water, I almost forgot about the deer's body at the bottom of my pond. I considered letting it stay there, if only so I didn’t have to call animal control. Unfortunately, I decided that, too, was stupid. I gave them another call after cleaning my floor. This time again to the main number, not Jeff.



After another short talk with an operator, they told me they'd send someone over to take a sample of the water, then they could pick the body up at a later date.



“Wait, hang on, you guys already got a sample of the water. Over a week ago now, you really need another one?”



“I’m sorry, sir, it doesn’t appear on record that we have a sample in our lab. Are you sure the worker got one?”



“Yeah, he filled a little cup with it, and had a strip of paper that he dipped in it. He even said he’d let me know when the lab results come in.”



“I’m very sorry about that, but it seems he must have forgotten to leave it at the lab, that or they just forgot to file it. I have it marked down that Mr. Brawly was at your address, correct?”



“Jeff?”



“Erm, yes, Jeff. We apologize for your inconvenience. If it works better for you, we can just have him take the sample at the same time as when they retrieve the deer. Is that okay?”



I considered for a moment asking if I could have a different worker come to my house, but I decided that explaining why just wasn’t worth it. He was odd, but probably not enough to report him to his company. I’d just stay inside the house when they came next, then I wouldn’t be bothered.



“Yes, that works for me. Should I call you guys back when the deer starts to float?”



“Yes, sir, he should have given you his card. You can just call him at that number and he’ll give you a time frame for when he can arrive.”



“Okay, thank you,” I said, hanging up the phone after a curt goodbye. The day went on, just like any other, but I couldn’t get that puddle out of my mind as I worked. I didn’t really catch it at the time, but in my memory, I swear it smelled faintly of the beach. That didn’t make sense to me, and I told myself I was just imagining it. I couldn’t help but wonder, though, if that was the smell that Keith and Jeff were talking about.



“We’ll be right over, sir, thank you!” Jeff said before hanging up. I had called him the next day, as soon as I saw the back of the deer begin to float to the surface. Sure enough, only twenty minutes went by this time before I could hear his truck down the road. Once more, he backed it through my side yard, giving me a small wave as he did so. 



“Hey guys, thanks for coming back. Were you already in the area?”



“Yeah, was real convenient,” Keith said as he walked around the truck.



“We actually were just grabbing lunch a few roads over when you called. Sorry about the water, by the way. I dropped it right in the lab's parking lot, can you believe it?” Jeff didn’t look at me as he talked; he instead gazed at the pond. I would have just thought he was looking at the deer if it weren’t for how he stared at the pond before. This time, I knew better.



“No need to apologize, it doesn’t really affect me, I think. Listen, I have to get some work done on my computer. Do you mind if I stay inside while you guys work?”



“Sure, not a problem,” Keith responded to me. I nodded at them both and returned to the warmth of my home. I wasn’t lying; I did need to get work done, and mindlessly I did so. I almost forgot about them until about an hour passed, and they hadn’t left yet. Last time it took thirty, maybe forty minutes tops. I got up and peered out my window to see how the progress was going, just in time to see Jeff taking the first step into my pond. 



The deer was already out and bundled up on the truck, and Keith stood at the shoreline with his back to me. Jeff wore long, rubber boots up to his hips and waded a few more steps into the water. I slipped on shoes and stepped outside, confused as all hell.



“What, uh, what are you guys doing?” I asked. Both men looked startled for a moment, as if they had forgotten they were on my property. 



“Oh, just grabbing that water sample, hope that’s alright, sir,” Jeff responded, craning his head over his neck to see me. Keith had turned to look at me when I talked, but turned back to the pond to gaze into it.



“And that sample needs to be from further in?”



“Well, both the deer have turned up in the same spot, right? The very center?” Jeff asked, taking another step. The water was just above his knees.



“They were, sure, but if that spot’s contaminated, shouldn’t it spread to the whole thing?”



“Not necessarily, Mr. Wilson. Sometimes the contaminants can make the water a bit dense, causing it to sink low. Sort of like how some flammable gases can sink low to the ground, the fresh air sitting on top.” He took another step.



“That doesn’t make any sense, Jeff. Not even how that works, I think.”



“Then don’t think,” He said. Keith nodded his head gently in agreement. “I know.” Another step took Jeff to waist height in the pond.



“Don’t you have to ask my permission before you can just walk in?” Neither of the men responded to me. “You aren’t even holding the cup!”



At that, Jeff stopped, slowly tilting his head down to his hands. He held his palms open, as if showing off to himself that they were empty. “Ah, shit…” He muttered. He took one more look at the center of the pond before turning around and walking back to us, giving me an obviously forced smile. “Must have forgot it!” 



“Right. Hey, if the contaminated water sank in the center, how the hell would the deer even get to it? And besides that, I already told you guys that the deer haven’t been drinking the water anyway.”



Jeff, after a moment of silence, stepped back onto dry land. “That is a… great point, Mr. Wilson. Sorry I hadn’t considered that,” He said, with a small laugh that I didn’t believe for a second. He walked over to the truck and reached into the same compartment as before, grabbing his little plastic box.



Keith still stood transfixed by the pond. I stood outside, shivering without a jacket, for the rest of the time they were there. I didn’t want to let them out of my sight again. When they had their sample they gave me some papers to sign and drove right off. No handshake, no “good day”, just a mumbled goodbye. I decided before they even left, there was no way I was letting them back into my yard.



In between the deer showing up at my pond and the first deer that drowned was thirteen days. Between the first and second deer drowning was about eight. The third deer drowned less than a week after that. I still didn’t hear back from animal control about any kind of lab results. 



During the night of the third deer drowning, I wasn’t able to fall back asleep after waking up. The splashing, the cries, and the feeling of panic all seemed to linger just outside my window. It felt close, oddly personal. I looked out the window, seeing the dark shape moving in the pond just like before. I watched for a while this time, instead of lying back down.



The deer struggled, but even in the waning moonlight, I could see the shape only going up and down in the middle. It never made any movements towards the edge of the pond. Even as the creature splashed and struggled, the deer remained in the very center. Like something was holding it there.



Sleep escaped me after I had that thought. The idea of something being inside my pond was insane. It wasn't deep enough, I never stocked it, and it was frozen solid after a brutal winter. But I couldn't get it out of my head that maybe I was wrong.



I didn't go much in my own backyard after that night. Anxiety swelled in me whenever I thought about the pond and what I saw. The morning after, my eyes puffy with fatigue, I looked for a private animal removal company. There weren't many in my area, unfortunately, but I made a few calls to the two that were.



The first one sounded great at first, saying they could retrieve it the same day instead of waiting. Then, when I asked how, the cheery receptionist told me the workers would wear wetsuits and wade inside the pond. Even if I couldn’t properly explain it to the worker, there was no way I was letting anybody set foot inside my pond. I didn’t hire them.



The second company was a little less professional-sounding; the person on the phone sounded less like he wanted business and more like he wanted to be left alone. But he told me he could come by when it floated and pull it out for me. I told him thank you, to which he grunted and hung up.



Unfortunately, I didn’t think to ask for a price when I was on the phone. Taking the deer's body went much the same as the first time Jeff was here. The heavy, bearded man took one, lingering look at the pond before coming to his own senses. He had no coworker; instead, asking me to hold the cot in place while he dragged the carcass over it without a winch.



“Shit!” The man grunted. As he dragged it over the rough ground, the hide of the deer lagged behind a few inches, then sloughed off from the body. The bloat in its torso slowly deflated, releasing a scent so thick it felt as if it coiled like a snake inside my nostrils. It was unlike the smell I would expect of a rotting deer; instead, it was much more familiar to me.



It smelled like low tide. Briny foam and spoiled shellfish. Sun-bleached fish bones and long-dead clams. The deer smelled like the ocean, and all the death it carried in it. I turned and retched immediately, and the man swore again.



“Hold the cot steady, the smell ain't gunna kill ya’.”



“Why the hell does it smell like that?” I asked, trying to breathe through my mouth. I just wanted this man and the deer to be gone as fast as possible.



“Like what?”



“The ocean, man!”



He glanced up at me with a puzzled expression. “Just smells like fart and iron to me, son.”



I bit my tongue. I could smell the ocean scent; he couldn’t. Without anything more to say besides a few grunts, we got the deer up and into the back of his van. He gave me an invoice, said I could pay by cash or check in the mail, and drove away with the spoiled deer. The whole time he navigated his van around my side yard and back onto the road, I stood mouth agape at the invoice. I couldn’t afford to call him back if another deer came; I could hardly afford this one.



I turned back to look at the smear of a stain the deer left in the grass where it burst. The smell of brine and decomposition still tickled my nostrils, and I tried to think about where to go from here. I had no doubt in my mind now, something was wrong with this pond. I didn’t know what, and I didn’t much care to find out. I walked back into my house and logged onto my laptop, frantically searching for a new place to move out to.



With a healthy amount of drinks, the fear I had was shifted into the background as I looked for open houses. It was oddly a little fun, if only because I was drunk and not thinking about the prices. As the night went on, the houses I looked at stepped away from small homes for me and inflated to millionaire mansions I could never dream of owning. To the sight of theater rooms, tennis courts, and outside kitchens, I dozed off. 



I dreamed I was drowning. Water filling my lungs and the surface above my head. I tried to swim with all my might, but it felt like the water was thick and far too heavy to move my arms and legs. I sank lower, the sliver of a moon in the sky fading more into darkness. Somehow, I knew I was in my pond, but it was too deep. My arms were over my head, and the surface was still higher, as if it was at least ten feet deep. And yet I sank further beneath the surface, falling like dead weight.



Something was pulling on me, tugging me from the hips down further. I looked down into an abyss underneath me and saw something looking back up at me. An eye, with its pupil far too large for the thin, pale blue ring around it. It was a fish's eye. Just as soon as I caught it, another eye opened besides the first. Then another, then a fourth, and more eyes after that. I saw no body, nothing holding my waist to drag me, just the eyes. As my lungs burned and my heart beat inside my ears, the entire pitch black space underneath me filled itself with eyes.



They took up everything in my sight, and stretched into a distance impossibly far away, incomparably wide to the mouth of the pond. My body thrashed and twisted in panic, bubbles escaping my lungs. I knew I had to be dreaming, but I couldn’t wake up. I tried to suck in any air, but none came, and the burning in my chest spread throughout my body. The tips of my fingers grew numb, and my limbs slowed down. My brain began to go foggy, the moon above me disappearing from view. I was helpless, struggling against a thing I couldn’t begin to understand. 



My heart beat still pounded in my ears, but it was slow, weak. I was fading. My thrashing had stopped, and all the eyes underneath me were drawing closer as I sank. I turned my head back to the surface, feeling the last of my strength leave me as I did. It was no more than a pinpoint in the distance. The last thing I saw was the final few bubbles escaping my mouth as I lost control of my body. My vision went black, and my muscles relaxed as I gave up the struggle.



“HELP M-”



I stood up from the couch, leaping onto my feet. My laptop fell in a wet slam on the ground. Adrenaline coursed through my body, the feeling of dying still lingering inside my head. I thought I heard someone shout out. I couldn’t tell if it was me or someone else. Was it just inside my dream, or was it real?



The sound of splashing came through the open window, carried underneath the roar of an untamed engine. The sound of something in the pond, and the sound of a vehicle with a shot muffler. 



I sprinted to the window, slipping and landing hard on my side. All across my floor was a thin layer of water, ocean muck, and foam coating the surface like an oil slick. I dragged myself to my knees and crawled to the window again, gasping for air as I did. My vision tunneled on the sky outside, on the sliver of the moon just above the pond. I heaved myself up, leaning on the soaked sill for support, and saw exactly what I hoped I wouldn’t.



Inside my backyard was the animal control truck, still on and running. It was driven right up to the edge of the pond, and its headlights illuminated who was inside it. The splashing in the pond wasn’t a deer; instead, it was Jeff. His head barely rose above the water, and our eyes met.



“Help me, please!” He shouted before going under for a second. I watched, paralyzed as bubbles rose to the surface before he broached again. “I’m sorry! I can’t get ou-”, and back under he went. I took a shaky step back and looked around my house. Every surface was damp and slick with a foul slime. All of the windows I could see were wide open, and my breath steamed out in front of me when I breathed. 



I made my way to the back door, not bothering to close it when I stepped into my backyard. My toes and fingers were numb, and the ground was frozen underneath my bare feet. I moved toward the pond until I was just a pace away. I could feel a few drops of water land on my face as the man splashed. One last time, Jeff rose, just barely enough for his eyes to lock onto mine. He was afraid; he knew he was going to die. There was no way I was stepping into this water to save him, and he could see that. Down again he went, the last few bubbles rising just a short moment later. The man was dead. 



That was a few hours ago now, and the sun is just beginning to crest over the horizon. I stood by the edge of that pond for a long time, I’m not sure how long exactly. All I know is I think I have some frostbite, and my fingers still barely function even after I held them by a burner on my stove for a while. I needed them warm so I could write this up before I went and called the police. But before I did that, I had something else I needed to do first.



After Jeff’s body went under for the final time, I kept looking at the pond. I felt like I was expecting something, some kind of reward or surprise. I’m not sure what, but I felt like I had to stand there and watch; I had to see what came next. So I did, and while there wasn’t anything more for me to see, something did come next. From the surface of the pond rose another smell, unlike the one of the deer but familiar all the same.



Sizzling mackerel, with garlic, parsley, and lemon. Fresh shucked oysters, and their minerally clean scent. The odor of fresh squid, lightly charred on the grill, slathered in a chili pepper and tomato sauce. A great big pot of clams and mussels, steamed with shallot and a freshly cracked beer. It smelled like a dream, like every meal of fish my father had ever cooked, but it was different than how I remembered it. This time, there was no abrupt end, no scorning words to cut the memory. I felt my stomach ache with hunger, and for the faintest moment, I wondered what I would get if I reached inside. Like there was something fantastic and enticing, held back under the surface and just waiting for me to free it. 



I’m not stupid, of course. Like I said, I do plan on calling the police. I know what I saw in my dream, the fear I’ve felt, and how everything that steps into that pond has not walked out of it alive. But I need to know. Before I call to report the drowning, I need to see what’s inside the pond for myself; I absolutely have to. I feel as if I’d die if I left here not knowing, like I would be leaving a piece of myself behind inside the water. 



It’s a beautiful morning, and the birds are chirping. All of the drowning, my dreams, the water appearing in my house, all of it has been at night. Obviously, that means it’s safe now, during the day, just like any other pond. I can feel that it's the right time, somehow. So I’ll go take a quick look for myself, then when I get back, I’ll update this post with what I find. Then I’ll call the police, though I’m still not sure how this will all make sense to them. If you have any advice, I’m all ears. In the meantime, however, I’ll be right back.
