“Daddy, why did you forget about us?” My 4-year-old threw his arms around me before I could make it half way up the front steps to the old colonial I used to share with Vicki.

He grabbed fistfuls of my shirt in his tiny hands, and clung tight when I tried to straighten up.

“I could never forget about you.” I peered over his shoulder. My ex had her arm around my daughter, who looked down on me from the porch with cold eyes, and a scowl. “Either of you.”

“Mommy said you didn’t have time for us anymore,” my son said.

Out of the corner of my peripheral vision, I saw it: a wicked grin flashed across her face, before she could stifle the expression with her hand.

I glared at her. “Kids, go wait in the car, would you?” They obeyed — my son with an immeasurable amount more enthusiasm — leaving me alone with Vicki.

“I know what I did hurt. But I can still be a good father for them,” I said. “Filling up their heads with bullshit about me not loving them doesn’t just hurt me.”

“It’s not bullshit. You really don’t have time for them anymore,” she said. “How’s that repayment plan treating you?” She gave a mischievous smirk. The same look would’ve set my heart racing just a year ago. Now it made my blood boil.

“Forget me; this isn’t fair to them,” I gestured toward the car. “They need a dad.”

Vicki folded her arms. “They have a Dad. A real one.”

“Who?”

“Thomas.”

Of course, Thomas — the friend Vicki told me I never needed to worry about —  who moved in less than a week after I was served with Divorce papers.

I clenched my teeth, and turned my back on her. I’d have my day in court.

I had a lot to think about during that weekend; try as I might to enjoy the time with my kids, as R advised.

I had a million questions still swirling in my head. Jacob was the only person with the knowledge to answer them, and he seemed I’ll-equip to do so.

Being dragged into the domain of lawyers seemed to have been a traumatizing endeavor.  Jacob went catatonic after R left, stinking into his arm chair and staring at the floor.

“You saw the other place?” I asked.

Jacob nodded, his eyes vacant. After some gentle prodding, he provided a description: a sprawling labyrinth of courthouse corridors, windowless legal offices, and filing cabinets.  The realm seemed full of creatures, all nearly identical to G — though according to Jacob: “You can tell them apart by their ties and cuff links.”

All hallways seemed to lead, impossibly, back to the same courtroom, where a monstrous magistrate looked down from his bench. “Eyes, so many eyes,” was all Jacob could manage.

After dropping off my kids on Monday night, I called the number on R’s business card.

The my phone rang once. Then:

“I’m glad you called.”

I whipped around to find R, speaking not from the phone, but sitting at my wobbly card table. 

“Hello,” I stammered.

“I’ve been busy these past few days, working on your behalf, crafting a killer strategy.” He tapped his briefcase. “You just need to trust me. Can you do that?”

I nodded.

“Good. We’ll be going then—got a meeting with your ex for a settlement.”

“Right—“

Before the words could leave my mouth, my body was ripped apart. My entire frame spaghettified from the head down. It felt as if my essence itself was torn to ribbons and cast into a surging, silent river rapid.

My body reassembled itself into a high backed chair, a scream of surprise still on my lips. Across from me, sat G and Vicki. R sat to my left.

He touched my elbow. “Let me do the talking; the less you say the better.”

I gave a meek, “yeah,” before folding my arms.

“You’ve come to talk about a settlement, I doubt it can beat the deal I’ve already worked out with Evan,” G said.

“It’s better than nothing— which is pretty much what your client will get if I file this motion.” R took a sheaf of papers from his briefcase, and handed it to G.

“What the hell is this?” G adjusted his spectacles. “You’d seriously consider filing for Moral Bankruptcy?”

That didn’t sound good. I nudged my lawyer, but he brushed me off. Vicki wound up asking my question for me:

“What’s Moral Bankruptcy?”

G turned to face her. “I’m repossessing Evan’s time, because he wasted yours, right?”

She nodded.

“He’s prepared to claim he’s such a piece of shit; a long, long list of other people have claims to his time too.”

“And that you’re unfairly draining all of it,” R jumped in. “Moral bankruptcy would shield Evan from any time repossession attempts, until the court could track down every person he’s ever wronged. Then they would split up his remaining time between all of them.”

“That could kill him,” G said. 

“Maybe.” R shrugged. “Either way, your client might walk away with a couple days for her trouble. That’s a lose-lose.”

“Then what do you propose instead?”

“One year. Lump sum. Taken from the end of his life span. He dies a little early. Your client still gets a piece of the pie.”

“And what, Evan gets to walk around, playing with the kids… living unpunished for decades?” Vicki asked. “No deal.”

“He’s right, Vicki. You’ll get seconds on the minute in a bankruptcy proceeding,” G said.

Vicki shook her head. “I don’t give a shit about the time.”

Both lawyers, and myself, looked at her in shock.

“Then what do you want?” I demanded.

“For you to walk away from *my * family. Thomas and I will raise the kids; I don’t want you to ever see them again,” she said. “Waive your custody rights, and I drop any claims to your time. You can go back to fucking what’s-her-name, and leave us in peace.”

R turned to me. “Well?”

“Well what?”

“Do you want to take the deal?”

“Have you lost it?”

R beckoned for me to lean in close. “Look, if she isn’t really after your time, I don’t have any leverage here. This deal gets you your life back. Most of it, anyway.”

Did I really deserve this? Would my children be better off raised by someone else—no switching weekends or splitting holidays, just one normal home?

“R, I’d like to talk with you in private for a moment.”

“As you wish.”

The same excruciating sensation took hold of me as my body was ripped across time and space, transported back to my studio bedroom.

“Maybe next time we drive,” I muttered.

R joined me at the card table, leaning back in the folding chair. “You know, you’re going to have to choose.”

“I don’t want to give up my kids,” I said.

“Well, in your agreement with G, you never specified which of your hours he can take, correct?”

“Right.”

“Then the way I see it, you’ve got three options.” R held up a finger. “One: I restructure your existing deal a bit so that you can still have some weekend time with your children.”

He raised another finger. “Two: you accept the settlement. No more dealings with the Tribunal.”

“No more kids, either,” I said.

“Right. Which brings me to option three.” He raised a third, bony finger. It looked like a knotted, gnarled up locust tree.

“Which is?”

“Fight in court, which isn’t as hopeless as G would have you believe,” he said. “We would have an uphill battle to be sure. But your ex wife’s behavior back there leads me to believe there may be some other vicious tendencies. We can use that to insinuate she is not an innocent party.”

I thought on this for a moment. “You’re my lawyer. What would you advise?”

“Look, I’m damn good at my job. But this is a tough case,” he admitted. “Few deserve the treatment you’re getting. But you did screw up. The court will see that. There’s a chance you could lose your kids, and your life.” 

He let out a long, wheezing sigh. “I would be tempted to take the deal. Though my species—we’re not like humans. We don’t believe in sentiment or connections; time is everything.” 

“Jesus, R.” I buried my head in my hands. 

“I can buy you a few days to think on it, but I’ll need to bring an answer to G, before the end of the week.”

That was a couple of days ago. I couldn’t tell you how much sleep I’ve lost over this decision since then. My deadline with R is tonight, but this will have to be my last post.

If this goes to court, R told me it would mean a total gag order: no talking or sharing updates about the case whatsoever. If I don’t go to trial, well— I would be too ashamed to admit I took that offer.

My thanks to those of you who have provided words of encouragement and advice. If I could provide a bit of my own in return, it would be this:
