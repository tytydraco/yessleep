**The End of Safety.**

Folks don’t often hear these words.

We are so very used to the world being nice and connected. You have your cell phone signal, you have your roads, water and your electricity.

The End of Safety is the last true wilderness on this planet, also known as: The Darien Gap.

There are no roads, power lines, charted rivers or rescue routes. It is a section of untamed and protected land between Central and South America.

You can visit, if you so chose to, but doing so means you’re on your own. 

Truly on your own.

Guides you hire will carefully lead you through pre-planned routes they have established - but to do so without a guide is often a fool's errand.  

My name is David, I’m a traveling medic and missionary.  

I’m basically a pastor, with first aid knowledge.

When this all happened, I was working in Panama. 

This is the last city between here and Columbia.

The last place north of nothingness.

So, it really was a shock when someone came stumbling out of the underbrush.

At first, the rest of the staff and I were certain it was some staff member who had wandered off from the hospital compound. But, she wasn’t employed by the hospital, nor a volunteer 

A quick call to the Parque Nacional Darién confirmed that there were no tours at the time. It was the wet season, after all. The wet season is especially inhospitable in the untamed rain-forest. It’s treacherous even for the most skilled guides.

So, here we had a mystery woman, sitting in the hospital. Covered in days worth of sweat, mud, scratches, sap stains and stink from her travels.

I questioned if she was indigenous, at first. But that wasn’t likely. She had Asian traits, her skin darker than most. She was far taller than any Asian woman I had ever seen before, standing about 188cm tall. She was clearly built to take care of herself, her body was well toned.  

She had some possessions which she wouldn’t let us touch bundled up into a trench-coat, as well as a pair of red-tinted-glasses she refused to let us near.

Her pants might have been white at some point, but now were browned and dirtied by the jungle underbrush.  

She wore a sleeveless turtleneck and finger-less leather gloves.  

Her hair was brown and she had a scar on her left cheek that looked older than the other scratches on her body.

I was in charge of the initial intake for the mystery woman.

“Colombiana?” I asked her as I did my best to clean and dry her wounds.

She turned from me when I attempted to dress the small scratches.

I rolled my eyes, “My name is David, I’m a missionary here at the hospital. I’m trying to help.”

When she didn’t respond, I tried again in Spanish.

In Spanish, she admitted, “I don’t have a problem understanding you, I just don’t want to be waiting around here.”

What struck me as odd was her accent.  

Not Asian or Latino in the least. She sounded almost Mediterranean. Having traveled all over as a Missionary, I was pretty well versed in accents.

“You don’t have to stay long, we just want to help you,” I explained.

“And *they* want to help too?” She asked, motioning to the police who stood near the doorway.

I heaved a sigh.  Police never make any medical situation better.

The police were here because, as far as they knew, she was on the run. 

Panama Police were not keen on letting anyone come out of the Gap who didn’t have papers, and she did not have papers.

“Could I at least get your name?” I asked, “I gave you mine.”

“You’re not my type,” She hissed.

“I’m not trying to hit on you,” I grumbled in frustration, “I genuinely want to help.”

“Bullshit,” She growled, her light brown eyes appearing to flash red as she did so, “No one ‘genuinely’ wants to help. Everyone’s after *something*. Sooner or later they let you know what that is. I like to skip all the betrayal bullshit and just avoid getting mixed up in everyone else’s problems.”

“Most folks are out for their own goals, sure. I can tell you, I’m not,” I glanced at the police near the door, “But, I’ll be honest: I can’t speak for the local authorities.”

She gave the police the side eye and then glanced over to me, her eyes scanning over the scrubs which were sealed in plastic and waiting for her on a nearby table.  

“Why don’t you wash up?  It seems like you’ve been through hell,” I pointed to the shower stall in the far corner, “We’ll have your clothes cleaned. Then you can be on your way.”

“Those fuckers come near me I’m going to break their hands,” She threatened as she grabbed the scrubs I had offered.  She tossed her long hair to the side and as she did, I spotted a few small twigs which had gotten stuck in her mane of hair, “My name is Cassara, by the way.”

“Nice to meet you,” I said with a weak smile as she walked off to the shower.

The local police turned to me, one officer approaching, “She’s co-operating?”

“Minimally,” I informed.

“You get her to confess anything?” One officer asked, “Drugs? Is she an escaped sex slave?”

I chuckled, “Yes, she came right out and told me her whole life story the moment I asked,” I rolled my eyes, “Does she *look* like a sex slave?”

The second officer shook his head, “She’s bad news. I can see it in her eyes. She's part of the cartel or some kind of fugitive from the law. No one runs through the Gap unless they have nothing else to lose.”

After some time Cassara walked out of the shower, her hair mostly dried. Her long mane of hair made a noticeable wet spot on the paper and plastic scrubs she wore. 

Cassara plopped her clothing, which reeked, in front of me, “It’s your ass if I don’t get this back like *new*,” she warned me.

“After we search it,” The first officer said approaching Cassara, “And you, for contraband.”

Cassara narrowed her eyes as the two officers surrounded her, “Do *not* touch me,” she threatened.

The first officer shook his head, “We can do this easy or hard. What is it going to be, chica?”

Cassara’s eyes narrowed as I watched her fist clench so tight her knuckles went white.

The officer moved forward, reaching for Cassara’s arm.

Cassara’s eyes tracked the officer as he approached her.  Once he was within range, her arm moved in a blur, wrapping around his bicep the other on his wrist.  With a sickening snap, Cassara hyper-extended his elbow.  

I watched in shock as the bone popped up under his skin as his arm bent backwards

The officer dropped to the floor in pain.

In a panic the second officer whipped out his pistol, “Stop right there!” He shouted, both shaking hands trying to steady his pistol as he took aim at Cassara. 

Cassara spun on her heel, grabbing his wrist with an outstretched hand and forcing his hands up as she rushed towards him. She proceeded to deliver a firm hit to his liver sending him tumbling backwards, his gun still in her hand.

I froze in place, eyes wide as I had watched Cassara shutdown both officers in a few blinks of an eye.

The second officer was laid out on the floor, either unconscious or pretending to be. Either way, I didn’t envy him.

The first officer was babbling in pain as I rushed over to him.

“Shit…” I looked over his mangled arm and called out for a doctor.

As nurses and doctors rushed in, the sound of a pistol hitting the floor drew my attention.

I turned and saw that Cassara had dropped the gun, grabbed her clothes and was making her way toward the window.

“Wait!” I called out, “I said you could use the laundry, didn’t I?”

Cassara stopped by the window, lifting her eyebrow up at me, “Aren’t you going to freak out and arrest me? No thanks.”

“You acted in self defense and warned them,” I shrugged, “And they’re still alive…” I cleared my throat, “Please, just… I still have to address some of those injuries.”

“They’re flesh wounds, I’ll be fine,” Cassara growled.

“Flesh wounds can become infected,” I reminded.

“Fine,” Cassara took a deep inhale through her nose and turned back to me, “But the second this laundry is done, I’m out of here.”

With that, I managed to collect her clothing, as well as pick up the second officer who had woken from his stupor.  I escorted him out of the room.

I locked the door behind me, my heart pounding in my chest.

The second officer glared at me, “Being chummy, eh? Why didn’t you help?!”

“I’m a missionary!” I hissed under my breath, “Turn the other cheek and help people, that’s all I do. What about you two? She said not to touch her!”

“She could be a drug mule or cartel! You saw how she fought us off! I am calling for back-up,” The second officer whined.

“Listen,” I shook my head, “She just wants to go, why is that so difficult?”

“Leave the law enforcement to us, okay?” The Officer grabbed at her clothing, rifling through it.  After a moment or two he found a small wallet and key-chain.

I groaned, certain Cassara wouldn’t be too pleased to find out I let the officer do this. Not that I could have stopped him.

The officer grinned as he pulled out a pair of ten US dollar bills, which I thought was odd. Sure, some folks at shops wouldn’t mind taking US currency, but it sure as hell wasn’t something I’d expect a traveler from the south to have.

The officer pulled out an ID Card next.  He examined it carefully.

He gave it a confused look after a few moments, “What the Hell is this?”

He inspected the ID, and showed it to me.  

I could understand his confusion as I tried to make sense of what I was looking at.

“Can you read this?” The officer asked me.

The ID was hers.  It had a photo of Cassara, some numbers written here and there.  I think one had to be height as I saw “188 cm” and something else which said “27”, I assumed her age.  The rest was all strange words and letters.

The only word at the top that I could remember was Πενθεσίλ.  I’m not even sure what language that is, let alone what alphabet. There was one last symbol in the corner as well, it was this: ⟴. 

All in all, the ID was beyond strange. It didn’t look like any passport or ID I had ever seen, yet it appeared official.  

It had some numbers across the top, a holographic image of some marble bust of a regal woman’s face was printed on what felt like metal.

“I’ve never seen anything like that,” I remarked.

The officer just took the ID, pocketed the money and then placed everything back in the wallet.

He grinned at me, “Keep her in there. I’m going to run this.”

As he walked off I just let an exasperated sigh out and I headed towards the Hospital laundry room.

I tossed Cassara’s clothing into the wash, keeping her wallet in my pocket as I walked away.

The fluorescent lights flicked for a moment before they went out, which happens a lot. Mainly when the dryers go off, however, not so much the washing machines. 

I pulled out my phone to use as a flashlight, looking around for the hallway leading to the fuse box.

That’s when I heard the footsteps behind me.

I turned around, and found nothing. I squinted into the darkness, holding my phone up, “Hello?” I called out, “Who is there?” 

No answer.

“Officer?” I called out again, concerned about who, or what, could be wandering around in the dark, “Cassara?”

Just at the edge of the light I could see a pair of feet, with black boots like the first officer’s.

“Officer? Is that you?” I called out.

They didn’t move.

I took a step forward, hoping the light would illuminate further.

The light moved and within the shadow, so did the feet.

I swallowed hard, “T-This isn't funny… I have to flip the breaker…” I said softly.

I turned and started walking down the hallway again.

The footsteps started to follow me again. I whipped around and there, again, right at the absolute edge of my phone’s light, were the same boots.

I took a few steps backwards.

The boots followed, one step, two step, always right at the edge of my light.

“O-Officer!” I called out, “This isn't funny!  S-Stop this!”

I tried taking a few steps forward, but now it appeared as if the hallway itself was stretching away from me, taking the light with it.

I stopped, the boots remained.

This time I turned down the hallway and ran.

I could hear the footsteps keeping pace with me.

I kept running as fast as I could down the hallway.

As I did, I saw the hallway turn to the right.  Even though it was dark, and I was panicked, I knew that was where the breaker box was.

As I turned and rushed down the hallway, those ominous footsteps continued right behind me.

Finally, I reached the machine room. I pushed past the heavy door, opened up the breaker and spotted the levers that were tripped.

I flipped the breakers just as I heard footsteps near the door. 

With my finger still on the last breaker, I heard the door creek open. 

The lights came back on as I turned to the doorway.

Nothing. Just the door.

My heart hammered in my chest as I made my way to the door, peeking outside.

“Hello David,” The voice of the first officer caught me off guard.

I jumped a bit, turning to him, “Was that you?!”

The officer narrowed his eyes on me, his arm in a sling, “I saw the lights off. So, I came here. What were you doing?”

“Fixing the lights,” I said, looking at his feet.

They appeared to be the same boots that were following me.

The Officer’s left hand fell heavily on my shoulder, “Listen… David…” He began, his breath hot and musky, “Get the girl’s trust and we’ll treat this little aiding and abetting thing without a thought. Okay? Just keep her here.”

“You attacked her Officer-” I was cut off.

“**Adikia**,” The Officer said softly.

“Sorry?” I said as I gave him a curious look. Maybe the drugs the doctors gave him for his arm were affecting him.

The Officer looked confused for a moment before he shook his head, “I said: I’m Officer Aguilar, Understand?”

“Sure,” I said, clearing my throat, “But as I was saying: *You* attacked *her*.”

“Attacked? We did no such thing.  We merely attempted a standard cavity search,” Officer Aguilar grinned, “She’d likely have even enjoyed it, if she let me. I’m good with my hands.”

I was growing increasingly uncomfortable, “Listen, I’m going to head back to do my rounds.”

“Before you go,” Officer Aguilar showed me the strange ID removed from Cassara’s wallet, “We’ve made copies, but here’s the girl’s ID, put it back where you found it,” Officer Aguilar instructed.

I sighed, taking the ID, “Fine,” I announced as I started to walk away.

“Don’t forget,” Officer Aguilar said as I made my way down the hallway, “Keep the girl here.”

I furrowed my brow, but all I could do was continue my rounds.

As I did my routine, I would occasionally check in on Cassara.  

The first time, I noticed that Cassara was sitting on her cot, her legs crossed, doing some kind of breathing exercise.

“Hey,” I called out to her.

Cassara opened one amber colored eye, the light playing tricks on me it seemed, “What?”

“Clothing is in the wash, should take a good couple of hours, okay?” I informed her.

“Fine,” Cassara said as she closed her eyes, “Let me know when it’s done.”

“Well, okay then,” I chuckled. I turned and headed out of the room, stopping in the doorway just in time to hear Cassara say something.

“Thanks,” Cassara said under her breath.

I smiled, “You’re welcome.”

Cassara didn’t say another word as I left.

My next check-in as my rounds continued was after dark.  I wasn’t too concerned to find Cassara sleeping.

With nothing odd to consider, and with her not trying to leap out of the window again, I went back to move her clothing over to the dryer.

I considered the sort of person Cassara was as I moved her clothing over.  It was pretty sparse clothing, and she didn’t even have a packed backpack or anything with her.

I wondered if that was intentional, or if she lost it in the Gap.  I also considered whether or not Cassara would even tell me if it was.

Cassara didn’t seem the sort to open up or trust anyone. She was certainly a loner.  While I was mildly paranoid about her running off in the middle of the night, I hoped that her clothing was enough to keep her in her room for the short term.

Whether or not I would have any of my questions answered at the time remained a mystery.

Man do I wish that mystery remained.

It was hours later as my rounds continued when things took an even more chaotic turn.

It was towards the end of my shift when I heard the smoke alarms go off.

My first instinct was to check the laundry room, as I thought I had set the dryer on for too long.  Cassara’s clothing would have been dry some time ago.  My thought was that, perhaps, the old dryers failed to click off and had started to burn clothing or start a fire.

I discovered that wasn’t the case in the least.  

As I rushed down the hallway towards the laundry room, I passed by Cassara’s room.  There, coming from her doorway, I saw smoke!

I rushed inside and my eyes went wide at what I saw.

Cassara was laying on the bed, her eyes closed tightly. She was struggling, somehow, as if having a terrible dream.

But that wasn’t my biggest concern.

Her sheets were one fire!

Cassara’s hands raised up and I could see fire wrapped around her arms up to her shoulders!

I rushed to the hallway and grabbed the fire extinguisher, dashing in and spraying the sheets down.

Cassara sat up as the foam covered her and I staggered back as she let out a cry of pain.

In a final burst of some sort, a ball of flame flew out of her sheets, knocking the foamed and burned fabric to the floor.

Cassara’s eyes were wide open and appeared red in the dark light.  

I quickly flicked on the light and grabbed the burn kit from the nearby first aid station.  I rushed to her side, pulling out everything I’d need to dress a burn wound, snapping on a pair of clean latex gloves.

“It’s okay!” I shouted as I noted that her scrubs were burned on either hip.

Steam rose off of Cassara's hands and I quickly reached for them to examine the extent of the damage.

“Let go!” Cassara snapped.

“I know it hurts!” I called out, “Calm down. I need to treat your burn wounds, we’ll get you something for the pain!”

Cassara’s eyes darted back and forth as she looked at the burned sheets and her burned clothing, “Shit… No No…”

“It’s going to be fine,” I took her hand gingerly, looking it over.

To my shock, there weren’t any burn marks. Even as I looked over her trimmed nails, which had a rough coat of black-nail polish, her skin looked unharmed. All the way up to her shoulders, though the scrubs she was wearing were singed, her skin unmarred.

My eyes traveled up to Cassara’s, and her reddish eyes locked on mine, a sincerity in her voice as she spoke, “I’m sorry.”

I was beyond bewildered as she asked her next question: 

“Are my clothes dry [yet?” ](http://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple)
