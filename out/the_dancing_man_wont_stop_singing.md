I have felt him my whole life. He was there when i was a child and he is here now. His presence first so innocent, now creeping in the back of my mind and vivid dreams, unpleasantly.

Let me start from the beginning. When I was 7, my grandfather passed away. No need for condolences, it’s a long time ago. The night after my grandfathers funeral was when I saw him first.

I saw a dream, where my grandfather was dancing in the corner of my room, singing the old lullaby my mother used to sing me. It was silly, I never saw him dance during his time alive. In the dream he was smiling at me, urging me to come and dance with him. Of course I did, we danced and sang the whole night. I thought he was coming to send his final goodbyes.

But the next night he was there again. Same happened on the second night after the funeral. I always danced with him. After a month of dancing and singing all night, it started to become clear, he wasn’t leaving anytime soon. I was tired of it. So after it I started to ignore him. For a long time it worked. 

Fast forward I was 15. He was still dancing and singing in the corner of my rooms darkness. Now his happy face had turned into a look of agony. His eyes were watery and red, singing sounded forced and tired. Every year his eyes got more red, more stretched open. His mouth was a gaping hole in his face, forced on a big smile. His pleas for me to come and dance were more urgent every night.

Once I turned 20 last year, I got terrified of the thought of going to sleep. His eyes bloodshot and wide open, his mouth hanging on a big forced smile that had made his cheeks bleed open, his jaw hanging by a thread. He started to dance very fast, and took steps towards me which he has never done before. The lullaby rings in my head constantly, sounding more like a horror movies ending scene than a children’s tale. 

A month ago he escaped my dreams. He started to follow me, dancing 10 feet behind from me. I had to start listening to pop music every second of the day on my headphones the lullaby is making me insane. He stopped singing it because of his dislocated jaw but i can still hear it inside my head 


First he appeared outside my dreams at night time. I was walking up to my room when I saw him dancing up the stairs with that gaping horrible look on his face. He yelled at me to come and dance but, the sound was caught up in his throat and only thing that got out was an awful mumble like a scream of someone who doesn’t have a tongue. I screamed and ran away from my house, as he was following me with dancing movements, screaming like someone was trying to eat him.

I got in my pick up truck as fast as I could locked the doors as I saw his dancing shadow getting smaller and smaller in the side mirror of my car. I have been driving around for a day. Until tonight. My car ran out of gas in the middle of nowhere. I can now see his shadow far away, dancing as fast as he can and he is getting closer. I can already see the bloodshot eyes and a hanging jaw. Its dark and no one is around. I am having a  sudden urge to dance.
