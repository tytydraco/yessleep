She gets in the car and already I want to plug my ears. Her voice is a high-pitched nasal trill. The kind of voice where someone can say three words and you already know they have the IQ of a brick. She tells me she just finished a job interview; she doesn’t want to get her hopes up, but she’s pretty sure she got the job.

I try to tell her that’s great, but she won’t stop talking long enough for me to get a word in. No one ever lets me get a word in.

“So like, at the end of the interview he told me that honesty is super important at their company, and he just needed to know if my tits are real or not. I said, ‘I promise they are’ and he said, ‘would it be okay if I ask you to prove it?’ I’m not embarrassed or anything, so I told him sure and he said to take my shirt and bra off. He squeezed them a couple times and said he believes me. So, I think he’s gonna call me with a job offer soon.” She paused, looked out the window and then at the floor. “I hope I get the job…” 

The funny thing is that, as stupid as this girl is, there’s a certain sadness in her voice, like she knows the truth but *chooses* to be dumb. 

I don’t wanna be the guy to tell her that she got molested, so I just say, “Congratulations. I’m sure you’ll get it.”

She perks up and starts telling me about her birthday plans.

When you’re an Uber driver, it always feels like you’re a guest in your own car. People jump in, lean the seat back, and tell you where to go. They use your charger and play music on your radio. They decide what you talk about, or if you talk at all. Eventually, you drop them off and they go on to something fun, exciting, or important. Meanwhile, you go to pick up someone else. 

I wish my passengers knew that I’m just as important as them. They depend on me, don’t they? When you step into an Uber, aren’t you hoping that your driver is going to be a normal person? Not dangerous or whatever? When passengers get in my car they’re putting their faith in me. Otherwise, they’d be driving their own cars.

The next guy wears an expensive suit and keeps his sunglasses on even after sitting down. I vaguely think about slapping them off his head, but I only say hello and confirm his destination. He starts to tell me about his law firm.

He speaks quick, as if it’s an elevator pitch. “We brought in seven figures last quarter alone, and we’re only getting bigger. You’ve probably heard of most of my clients. Sorry, but I can’t name drop to just anybody. You get it, right?”

“Of course.”

“But the new receptionist I just hired is smoking, man. Guarantee she’d be the hottest girl you’ve ever seen. Blonde, blue eyes, big tits. She was so desperate for the job that she practically offered to suck my dick during the interview.”

I’m not sure why he feels the need to tell me all this. Maybe I just seem like a loser: the Uber driver who’s just lucky to be in his company. Maybe he wants to fill the silence and he can’t think of anything else to say. Whatever the reason, people just have a tendency to spill their guts when they get in my car, and that’s alright with me. Long as I get paid.

“But I always wait to do that kinda thing until after they’re hired,” he continues. “That way she can’t say I made her do it to get the job. When you’re a lawyer, you think about those things. You play it safe.”

We come to a stop at a red light and I stare directly into his sunglasses. “And what happens if she says no after you hire her?”

“I can always hire someone else.” He laughs and puts his hands behind his head. “I always get what I want.”

I act like I’m genuinely curious—impressed even. “And what if she tries to sue you after you fire her?”

“Easy enough to explain that she got fired for poor performance. Not a hard sell when you hire shit-for-brains.”

“It’s no wonder you're such a success.”

He doesn’t catch my sarcasm. “Thanks, pal.”

Soon enough I’m dropping him off at some bar. He hands me a business card and steps out of the car. “For when someone tries to fuck you over,” he says. 

I thank him and drive off. I have time for one more ride.

The last guest of the night is an elderly lady who plops down in the back seat. She’s going to the theater to see her son’s first movie.

“That’s cool,” I say. I should probably be more interested than I am, but it’s been a long day and I’m tired.

“He’s not an actor,” she says, holding up an open hand as if to tell me not to freak out. “He just helped with the special effects, but it’s what he’s always wanted to do and I’m proud of him.”

“Uh-huh.”

Neither of us speak for a while, but every time I look at her in the rear view mirror I can see that she’s smiling. Something about that softens me, and I start to drive a little slower.

“Are you always this happy?” I ask.

“Why wouldn’t I be?”

“A lot of things in this world aren’t so great.”

“But a lot of things are,” she pauses for a second, opens her mouth and then closes it, as if debating whether or not to tell me a secret. Finally, she continues. “I’m going to have a granddaughter soon.”

I drop her off at the theater and tell her to enjoy the movie.

Instead of going home I just keep driving. No more rides. Just me, alone. I go on back roads where I know there will be hardly any traffic; for a few minutes I drive so fast that my car shakes, then I slow down and go so slow that I’m not sure if I’m moving at all. 

I drive for hours, but as long as I drive and as far as I go I can’t stop thinking about that old lady. Will she always be happy? What if something happens to her granddaughter? What if she interviews for a job with an evil man, or, God forbid, she get hired by one, or if she dates one, or has the misfortune of just being around one at the wrong time. Will that old lady still be so happy? Will she still be so content?

After a while I start to get an itch for a habit I thought I kicked. I drive back home, and that night I lay in bed and stare at the business card until I fall asleep. 

When I start driving the next day I find myself circling familiar streets. I look at all these tall, sleek apartment complexes in the heart of the city. I think about what kind of people live in them, what kinds of things they had to do to get there.

I pick up a passenger and I’m talking before he can even sit down. Nothing important, maybe not even anything coherent. I tell him that I ate cereal for breakfast, and I spare no details. I say that the first bite was heaven, the fifth bite was a little mushy, and that I ended up throwing away about a third of it. I tell him that I’m going to get a pizza for lunch, a large one just for me and that I’m going to eat the whole thing. I keep talking and talking, and when I realize I don’t have plans for the upcoming holiday, I make something up. 

“I’m going to my beach house for a nice getaway,” I say. “And maybe after that I’ll spend a few days abroad. I’m planning a trip to the moon for Christmas, and maybe next year I’ll go see Antarctica.”

I keep talking until we reach his destination; he’s reaching for the door long before I come to a stop. I imagine that later he’ll tell his wife about the Uber driver who wouldn’t shut up. I’ll be the main character in his story.

Not much later I get a notification to pick up a familiar name, and I practically race to his address. 

“Hey, it’s you again,” he says when he gets in the car. He’s still wearing those sunglasses. He starts talking about his firm, his weekend plans, and the expensive trips he has planned. I don’t say anything and he still keeps on talking, doesn’t even seem to notice my silence. Does he know that a conversation takes two?

He barely acknowledges me until I drive past his destination.

“Hey,” he says. “You missed my turn.”

I press harder on the gas.

“Turn around,” he says, and then, as if I’m dumb, “u-turn?”

I tell him that I’m going to the moon for Christmas.

“I’m calling the police,” he says. “This is ridiculous. You’re insane.”

But we’re already on my favorite backroad. 

As I’m pulling over I take a knife from my pocket and stab him in the stomach. I do it again and again until I’m sure he’s no longer breathing. I take his phone and use his face to unlock it. I dump him in a ditch and drive back to his destination, a sleazy bar. I click the button to confirm that he’s been dropped off, and then I throw his phone out the window. 

I know I won’t get caught; I’ve done this before.

My clients have a habit of spilling their guts when they get in my car, but I don’t mind. As long as it’s [on my terms.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ConnorIsaacWriter/comments/1poetct/thanks_for_reading/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
