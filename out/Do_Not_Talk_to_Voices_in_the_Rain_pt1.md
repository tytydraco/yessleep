Can people change? Make sure you have the right answer because this is a life-or-death situation. Think about it as you hear how we met a creature named Omertà. She might still be out there, so if you meet her here and she decides you're an enemy, here's my advice:

Avoid Water. Do Not Go Outside When It Rains. Do Not Bathe. Do Not Shower. Do Not Even Drink Bottled Water.

Do not be persuaded by the safety other people have. Once Omertà hates you or someone you love understand she’ll want to kill you all—one by one.

Benni's dad, Mr. Alan, didn't believe me. Mr. Alan would be alive if he had. 

Finding ten different cases of water in his attic sent my head spinning, but my body went fear-driven still. It took a minute for me to recompose myself and my hands busied themselves to get rid of the danger, the danger being the cases of water. 

We warned him. His daughter warned him. Fine, don't believe me, but trust your daughter, man.

The first hours of our arrival at his home were spent warning him, calming him, searching his house, and detailing why. That same day, we tossed cups away, recycled bottles, and only used drips of faucet water to put on a washcloth to bathe.

And we lived! They all were alive when they listened to me! 

That evening to keep us all from an early grave, I got to work burying the packs of water bottles. There was no need to be angry with Mr. Alan; the request did sound insane. There was a need to panic though. Mr. Alan's legendary temper wouldn't stand for a guest in his house burying his newly bought water in his backyard. 

His daughter and I weren’t a couple or anything, just friends, who needed a place where we could avoid most forms of water. Mr. Alan’s home was the last option left.

Mr. Alan and Benni would be back soon. If I dug fast enough, potentially I could bury the bottles and fill the hole back without him even noticing. My arms ached at the thought—shoveling is grueling work. I considered Benni and her graciousness in convincing her dad to let me stay here. Yeah, I could do it.  

Shoveling through a patch of dirt proved to be harder than you'd think. Dirt stained my clothes. My hands tore. My shoulders burned and groaned with the task, and my biceps begged for a break. It felt like the shovel itself was gaining weight. Ignoring all of this, I let the calluses form and pain persist because I really, really, really did not want to cause any more problems for Mr. Alan and Benni. The dark clouds were my only comfort in that hour—shade through the pain, I thought—but in actuality, they were heralds readying misery's reign.

It was an hour straight of grueling work to make a hole large enough to fit all ten cases inside of it. Obviously, they couldn't be poured out and risk making a God-forsaken puddle.

The sound of the door opening behind me shook me from the rhythm of my task. Mr. Alan and Benni were home. My friends describe me as shy, and they're right. So, Mr. Alan launching every four-letter word and variation of 'idiot' at me would have stopped me in the past. But the necessity of the situation made me resist this time. I never turned to face him. I just kept prepping.

"Oh, dear," Benni said. No need to look at her either. The cases needed to be buried. I hefted the first case, anxious to avoid a tear and anxious to avoid Mr. Alan.

"This is your friend, Benni. Your friend! You fix it." Benni's dad said, and he slammed the door.

I hefted another box into the hole and talked to Benni.

"Sorry about that, Benni," I said. "I know your dad can be a handful at times. I know you're scared he bought this water too."

"Nooo, Jay," she said. "He's not the handful."

"Well, I know I'm no angel, but you know what I'm doing is for our safety, y'know." I hefted a second case into its grave.

"Jay-Jay," she said. "My dad's getting real close to kicking us both out. I don't want to be homeless. Please, come inside. I'm begging you."

"Not yet."

"Now."

"No."

"Jay..." Benni's words came out slow and soft, like she was babying a child. "Omertà was our friend. I don't think she'd really hurt us."

That stopped me.

"People change," I said.

"Not that much."

"I think you'd be surprised. And anyway, anyway," it was hard to speak; exhaustion kicked in. The words got caught in my teeth. "There's a decent chance she might have always been like this."

"That wasn't what our friendship was like with Omertà, and you know it."

"Do I?"

She didn't answer.

"Jay-Jay," she said. "There's a hurricane coming. I bought those cases because we could not have access to water if this gets bad."

"Thanks to Omertà, if a hurricane gets bad enough, we're dead anyway."

Circling us, black clouds haunted the skies like vultures on a corpse.

Mr. Alan rushed outside, sidestepping his daughter, rushing to me, facing me, and swinging a large purple metallic cup in front of his face. The cup overflowed with water.

"Yes, I have water in a cup," Mr. Alan mocked. "Ooooh, scary." He took a swig. "And yes, it's a Stanley."

Guess what? He smiled. So, I smiled. I guess he was safe, and that made me happy. He frowned in surprise at me. What? Did he think I wanted to spend a day burying water bottles? I shrugged. If we were fine, I'd need to put the water bottles back in the house and start to board things up again. But first, if we were safe, I would take the warmest bath possible.

A white hand popped out of the Stanley and grabbed Mr. Alan's throat. It squeezed. Benni's dad looked at me, eyes big, scared, and wanting... I don't know.

The pale hand flicked its wrist, and Benni's dad's neck cracked. He fell with an unceremonious thud. 

Dead.

His unbelieving eyes stayed open and the red, angry, pulsing, handprint on his neck looked to be the only part of him that was still alive. 

But he also knocked over the Stanley Cup. The water spilled on the floor as did the hand. I leaped back to avoid it and fell into the hole and onto the bottles of water.

CRACK

CRACK

CRACK

The water bottles cracking might as well have been gunshots into my chest. Panic. My hands and feet slammed into water bottles, cracking more open. Omertà’s many hands materialized from the water, defying the logic of men, daring the brain to break into laughing and insanity at the horrifying impossibility of the matter. Scratching through our reality, one hand squeezed mine at first, not unpleasant because the calloused feminine hand breathed familiarity despite its lack of mouth. The hand clutched mine. 

That hand helped me up mountains, that hand had pulled me from a stream and saved me from drowning, that hand walked with me through life when I needed a friend; a week ago, it was us against the world. 

Like the saying goes: "All this hate was once love."

The hands went squeezing and scratching into me; my own ankle went cracking. Bones broke. By reflex, I reeled, destroying more water bottles, birthing more calloused, petite, and strong hands wanting to break me so that place may be my burial.

The hands blossomed from the wet dirt like flowers and demanded my death like herbicides. Longing for my death through suffocation, one worked on my neck with great success, two groped in my mouth and one kept my mouth open, while their companions dug in the earth, tossing dirt, worms, rocks, and sticks inside. 

The other hands clapped for themselves as joyous as I was drooling. There was so much mass, mass, never-ending mass, only limited by their tiny hands and my assailants' need to gloat.

My eyes swelled as my past with Omertà shrunk until only this moment mattered.

Tears fell as my body was lifted, lifted as the hands that had once protected me searched under my body for more ways to torture me.

Four hands punched into my spine, hoping to break it. Powerful thumps slammed into me in a straight line up my back, weakening it with every blow. My spine giving way. My last moments would be that of a paraplegic, and that was petrifying. How long would she make me live, only able to blink? 

The whirl of a chainsaw brought me from oblivion. Like a horror movie villain, Benni stood above me, and with fury she never showed before, she sliced at hands as they rose from the ground. Omertà's silver blood dripped and then poured from the hands as Benni hacked away. I sputtered and spit out all the nonsense they put in my mouth. Benni pulled me up; silver blood covered us both.

Limping together, we made it inside, but her dad's dead body did not. Instead, that great white hand of Omertà was slowly dragging it into a puddle with her.

Unfortunately, Benni went back out to save the body. A valiant effort from a good daughter. But of course, it was all a setup.

"Wait, wait, wait," I mumbled, still attempting to get control of my mouth back. Benni still didn't get it. She didn't understand the limitlessness of Omertà's cruelty.

Omertà had no use for a dead body. Benni dived for the body. Omertà tossed it away and with a vice grip grabbed Benni's diving hand and pulled. I knew Omertà was yearning to kill Benni, to drag Benni inch by inch into the puddle and into Omertà’s realm and once Benni was there she would end her life.

Benni kicked hoping for impossibility, to anchor on air. Leaping, then falling, then crawling, I reached for Benni. Her dad’s dead eyes yelled at me to save his daughter. His empty mouth hung as if anticipating another failure on my part.

Benni piece by piece disappeared in the puddle, alive and screaming loud enough to travel across worlds. Her hair vanished. Her head swallowed. Her chest chomped by the water. Her hips, owned by Omertà. Her legs leached away in a lightning flash.

Her feet were mine. I saved her. I grasped her white sneaker! 

And it came off in my hand. 

Benni’s whole body went through the puddle.

That was an hour ago; Omertà has tossed Benni's dead body back up to taunt me.

The sight of Benni's pale, drowned body makes me want to die. A slow, stagnant, shadowy death with meaning stripped and motion nonexistent, with starvation's gut punches killing me or dehydration's choke—whichever comes first.

Benni was the sweetest girl I knew and so hopeful. She's gone now, so I can be honest: I wanted to die of old age with her by my side. We wouldn't die peacefully; we'd die arguing and laughing and pretending we were not flirting with each other as best friends do. Our grandchildren would surround us and shrug at our love that didn't mature as our bodies did.

I wish I could wake her up and tell her how much I admired her passion for serving others, that I only send her videos when I'm beside her so I can see her smile, and that all of our friends were right—we were meant to be together. But I can't even look at her after what Omertà did.

“You’re fault,” is written in blood on Benni’s forehead. Omertà's native language wasn’t English, and she didn’t bother to understand grammar. Still cruel, though. It’s amazing how much hate old friends could have. Omertà and Benni have known each other since kindergarten. I met Omertà in middle school.

If you want to know why she hates us so much that’s really where the story starts. I will tell you about how we first met.

Middle school was rough. Kids that age are either mean or sensitive; adolescence doesn't allow for an in-between. I tried to be tough; however, my teacher mocking my voice and calling me a bitch in front of everyone for complaining about another kid hitting me stretched the boundaries of my soft and doughy resilience. 

Tears popped into my eyes, and awareness of how bad things could get if the other kids saw me cry caused me to flee the room. Tears still almost trickled down. A couple of kids ditching class almost saw it. The school wasn't safe. Ramming through the front doors, I burst outside and entered a storm. The wet and blurring world hid me. 

Dark clouds spat on the world, maybe to the level of a hurricane. Regardless, my legs willed me forward, wandering and begging to be left alone.

Running in circles, lost in the rain, and scrambling through the streets, horns blared at me, forcing me to the sidewalks. Pedestrians pushed me to the side, searching for their shelter. And at one point, the wind even joined the barrage, lifting me and tossing me to the floor. I crawled under an awning for shelter. With only myself around, I held myself for comfort.

The cars left. The tourists evacuated. Acting as my only companion was the rain. The way it beat against the sidewalk reminded me of a punishment I knew I was sure to get at home. But at least it was finally safe to cry.

"Jay-Jay, can you come out?" 

I leaped back and pushed my back against the wall. While sniffing and wiping away tears in a desperate attempt to hide that I dared to cry, I searched for the person who called my name. There was no way to tell where the sound came from. 

They know my name. My parents... my parents saw me crying in public and skipping school. They'll kill me.

Steeling myself, I sucked up every tear and faced the rain. My lips curled tight in stoic resolution, and my mouth parched, dry from crying.

"Yes," I said. 

"Jay-Jay," the rain said. The rain spoke to me. As the raindrops slapped on the sidewalk, it created a tune-like music but certainly not music to be clear it was like a witch's-broom singing. Yes, I know that doesn’t make sense. She made my brain hurt at first. I had a strong feeling it was a she. She not as in wife, mother, or friend but she as in a storm-filled sea or a tiger.

"I just want to hug you," she said.

"How are you doing that?" I asked. "How are you speaking?"

"How do your lips move?" 

"My brain tells my lips to move."

"Oh, what a smart boy. You were just supposed to say you don't know and I would say the same. But since you're such a smart boy, shall I tell you the truth?"

"Yes... please." 

"Of course, I’m not really rain I’m only speaking through rain. I’m magic." That scared me more than anything. My religious parents taught me magic was quite real and it should be avoided at all costs. My parents had a point.

"Magic's not real," I said.

"You lie and you know it."

Tears found me again because I was a kid caught lying, and that meant punishment would follow.

"Hey, hey, hey," her droplets choired against the sidewalk. "It's okay; everyone lies sometimes. Would you like to know a secret?"

"Yes," I said.

"Everyone's lying because everyone can hear us when we speak in the rain. They just ignore us. In fact, I think you're better than them for not ignoring me. You're honest and kind."

"Yeah?"

"Yes, you heard a voice and replied. Everyone else ignores us."

"That's mean of them."

"Yes," water flooded from the sky in an unprecedented amounts.

"Them being mean hurts, doesn't it?"

"So much," she crooned out, trying to control herself and failing. The rain fell in uneven bursts.

Abandoning the awning, I walked into the rain for her sake. Through her magic, the water warmed my skin like summer sunshine and tapped me into giggle-filled tickles. My need to cry left. She hummed to me, a song of her people, a low and echoing ballad. Soon, the humming was warped by words, words my mouth couldn't make. But I danced for the first time. The shy kid too afraid to speak danced alone in the rain until I was too tired to move.

Exhausted, I laid on the ground.

"Do you know why you could hear me?" the rain said, tapping my body like a little massage. "Because you're honest, you're sensitive, and that's a good thing. And you listened to your hurt, and it told you someone else was hurting, so you found me."

"Will you stay with me?" I asked.

"Forever and ever, but you just have to ask. Say my name and ask, and I'll be with you forever."

She told me her name, and then I made the worst decision of my life. 

"Omertà, please stay with me forever."

The rain stopped. The world went silent around me. I was alone again.

"Hey," I asked the sky. "Come back. You said you wouldn't leave me alone. Come back."

Nothing answered me but my footsteps...

SQUISH

SQUISH

SQUISH

For the first time, I became aware of water soaking in my shoes, and embarrassed awareness froze me to my spot. My face flushed. That rain trick was another prank pulled on me. One I had fallen for wholeheartedly; this was worse than when Maggie White pretended to have a crush on me for a whole week. Just like back then, I knew someone somewhere was snickering behind my back as I talked to the rain and danced with it. My crush on Maggie ended with her telling everyone my secrets and calling me gross in front of everyone in the cafeteria. Would this be a worse conclusion?

Water leaped from the gutter across the street from me.

I jumped. It was so intense, like something thrashed and splashed in there.

"Jay-Jay," a voice said from the gutter, and I froze. No, I couldn't get pranked again. I wouldn't be fooled again.

"Jay-Jay," the voice said again.

"Leave me alone," I yelled back with all the rage a child could muster.

"Please," the voice said, "I need your help." 

I groaned and relented. I stomped to the drain, and inside of it, I saw a mermaid floating and a guy and girl about my age. They would be my three best friends for years to come Little John,  the now-deceased Benni, and Omertà.

Sorry, that's it for now. I'll tell you more soon. I have to go board the house up. The storm's getting worse.
