The longer you're in a strange situation, the more your brain just numbs itself to the insanity of it. It was strange at first, waking up to sometimes see Rocky at the foot of my bed. His appearance was sporadic. He'd appear and disappear as he saw fit. The longest I recall him being gone was about a month and a half. I almost thought he had left for good. Maybe he went to heaven? Then he came back, as if nothing had changed.

After a time, it became weirder when Rocky wasn't around. I'd still see spirits, now and again, but I hadn't seen anything like Rocky since he came into my life. I kept him a secret from my parents. Coupled with everything that had happened, I thought I was an adult now at six and too old for an "imaginary friend". It's laughable what children think maturity is and to my younger self's credit, Rocky wasn't imaginary.

At the beginning, I merely tried to introduce him to my hobbies and interests. It was through this way that I found Rocky couldn't see electronics that well. He could make out movies, video games and TV shows, but he told me they were often muted and filled with static. When I tried to introduce him to video games, he just didn't comprehend it. "A show that you play. It doesn't make sense,". Board games he seemed to respond better to, though I'd have to read the rules and explain them.

It was a friday night that I finally asked about him, alone in my room when I should have been sleeping. Mom and Dad din't know, plus my door was locked. "Where do you come from?" It was a simple enough question, open-ended.

"I was like you."

"You were a person?"

I flipped a card for Rocky. Pass go. I'd move his piece for him and place the money in front of him, though he didn't seem particularly interested. Rocky just seemed to enjoy being treated like a person as opposed to...whatever he was.

"Yes."

"Do you remember your life?"

"I was a...person. I don't remember much of the before time. I remember that I was a...soldier. Yes. I did things. I killed people."

My brow furrowed as I flipped my own card. Go directly to jail. Gross. I moved my piece. "Is that why you're how you are?"

Rocky craned his head to better look at my eyes. He liked to make eye contact, even though he had none. "It is a rule I found out about the after. When you kill, when you take a life personally, you become more like me."

I stared at him. It was a heavy topic for a child, much more so with the frankness he presented it with. "How do you know?"

"I've found others like me. I can smell when its close. When someone is close to dying. The smell...what's your favorite food?"

I moved his piece but I did so half-heartedly. My attention was elsewhere. "I like pizza with onions."

"Imagine that. But you haven't eaten in years. Imagine the smell. The aroma. So close. So delicious." It was the first time I ever saw two slits open on Rocky's face, just above that mouth, a wheezing inhalation sound. "You couldn't understand it. How hungry you get. How you'll do -anything- for it."

My mind had finally linked what had happened with Mr. Raymonds. "...But you only chase after bad people, right? Was Mr. Raymonds a bad person actually?"

Another wheezing. This one, however, was more of a laugh. "No. I don't know. I don't care. I simply need it."

I frowned. That wasn't a good answer. It was cruel and callous, even to a child. "But you should only chase after bad people."

"Life and the after don't care about such things." Rocky's gaze locked harder with mine. "Look at me. Understand me; Fairness. Justice. Morality. They do not exist. When you are in the after, you do what you need. You fight. You thrash. You eat. You survive. Because that is all there is here."

It was times like this, looking back, I don't think Rocky truly grasped how young I was. I don't think he had known such words would bounce off a child's head. I only remember them now because of what would come after. "What if you just...didn't?" I'd ask, rolling my dice. Not out of jail.

Rocky wheeze-laughed again. His head tilted further down, twisting his neck until he was almost looking at me upsidedown. "I need to eat. I need to."

"But—"

"You like games," Rocky interjected before I could finish. "Do you want to play a game -I- made?"

The room felt just a bit colder but I wasn't going to back down. "Uhm. Sure?"

"It is a simple game. You are the player. I will watch you. For five days. Only five. You will not eat. Water is fine. But no food. You tell me to stop, but you will show me first. Five days only. If you can do so, I will stop feasting." Rocky raised those five, knifelike fingers. "Do we play?"

Five days without food is the sort of challenge a monk would do. Five days without food as a child is borderline neglect. I was certain however. Call it arrogance, call it wanting to be "the hero" in this story, call it my hope that I could stop Rocky from "feasting". "We play."

Rocky offered his hand to shake. I took it, my smaller hand passing through his. It was only then that I noticed Rocky's entire hand could wrap around my torso if he was in the room with me.

Those five days were difficult, though I had my tricks. Mom asked if I wasn't feeling well during breakfast but I shrugged her off. I told her I just wasn't hungry. My tummy hurt. During dinner, Dad thought I was sad or upset, but I assured him it was nothing. I don't think either of them believed me but they were simply watching. Surely if I was hungry, I'd at least grab a snack, and it was easier to be mad at a child for only eating sweets and treats as opposed to meatloaf.

What made it far easier to distract myself was Rocky. True to his word, Rocky followed me everywhere. Usually he'd stay at home when I went to school or would disappear to do his own thing. Trying to learn about multiplication tables or the proper use of puncuation is a sentence was hard as you could see this crimson behemoth, looming in the room.

The one brief note was that as we were walking to lunch one day, Rocky stopped. I didn't say anything and kept walking but he seemed to be drawn to another classroom. My school went from kindergarten to eighth grade, Rocky focused entirely on a history class watching what I think was a war movie. His head tilted to the side, breaking away from me as he went to look through the window. It occurred to me now that I could cheat, I could have something quick. It was day three now and water had begun to not cut it. I needed more. Just one quick snack?

No, I'd think to myself. The Power Rangers wouldn't cheat and neither would I.

Rocky would rejoin me later after lunch. It was during recess now and I was distracted playing kickball. Rocky followed me, watching children play, as I guarded the outfield. "...Did you eat?" he'd ask bluntly, not a hint of trust in his voice.

"No."

"Good. I woul—"

Rocky stopped what he was saying. Those slits on his face where his nose would be opened up, drinking the air of the after in deeply. A low, gutteral groan rippled from his throat, his words stopped. Every muscle on his body flexed, growing taut, his fingers writhing as he smelt something. "Rocky?" I whispered, confused.

He didn't respond to me. I don't think he even knew who I was. He dropped to all fours and began to sprint. It was exactly as I saw him when Mr. Raymond died; a wild, charging behemoth. The worst part of it all was how silent he was. That silence made it easy for me to hear the braying of something in the distance. The direction of which Rocky had begun sprinting towards. It was feasting time.

"IDIOT! THE BALL!"

I was so distracted that I hadn't noticed that the kickball had landed in my field. The other kids were pretty upset at me about it. We'd finish the game but I wouldn't see Rocky for the rest of the day, nor for the next three days. At any time, I could have cheated, but I was too stubborn. I was too prideful and too assured in my victory. Rocky would come back, see that I had won, renounce "feasting" and he'd...I don't know. Go to heaven? Stop being a scary monster? I didn't know what "victory" was.

By the fifth day, I felt lethargic and sick. Water wasn't enough and I felt dizzy when I got on and got off the school bus. I wondered if Rocky had quit. Had he left because he knew he'd lose? I don't think so. Did he just not want to participate anymore? I didn't care. All I did know is that when I got home with mom, Rocky was there. He watched me enter, following me as I passed the living room. Only a few more hours to go. Smugly, I thought he was scared to lose.

It happened just as he said it would.

The smell hit my nose first, immediately making me salivate. Reflexively I breathed deeply. Dad was still wearing his work clothes, on the phone with someone having a serious conversation. "We can afford that, yes, we— Hold on one second." He'd put the phone to the side as he'd look at me. "Hey buddy. Mom and I were pretty worried about you. We figured this would help?"

In hindsight, it was their last ditch effort to get me to eat before taking me to the doctor for my makeshift hunger strike. Loving as they could be, they knew my favorite food well: Pizza with onions. Mom didn't like pizza, Dad liked his with cheese only. This was for me and me alone.

I'm not proud of how it must have looked. I didn't even bother with a plate. Six year old me, running to the box, tearing it open, and immediately beginning to stuff my face with pizza. I was too hungry. It had been days. I was ravenous. Grease stained my hands, cheese on my face, the crunch of onions as I'd bite down. It was exactly what I wanted and needed. I ate my fill and then some but that wasn't what gave me pause.

In the corner of the room, Rocky sat there. That hole he had for a mouth taking an oblong shape, as if he was pulling it in two long directions. More jagged teeth and fangs, displayed to me. I swear I saw some stained with blue, but I think I might have just been starved and was seeing things. But I wasn't hallucinating his expression or the shape of his mouth.

Rocky was smiling at me.

I ended up throwing up about two hours later. It turns out almost five days without food and your only sustenance being greasy pizza doesn't go well on your body. But that didn't bother me. What did bother me was losing. As a child, I was never one to like losing. It felt bad. It didn't help that I was so close to winning, stolen from me by my stupid parents getting me my favorite food.

After mom and dad helped me back to bed, bidding me to rest, I'd stare at the ceiling. I could see Rocky out of the corner of my eye, waiting until I heard mom and dad's room close before I'd speak: "Stop smiling at me. That was cheating."

"I told you. There is no fairness in the here nor the after."

"I could have done it."

"Maybe you could have."

"...I was so hungry."

Rocky, however, stopped smiling. He'd slowly claw his way over to me, sitting by the bed parallel to me. "Now you know why I cannot stop. That hunger. That pain. I feel it all the time. I need it to stop. I need it to end. Even now, I am in agony. Talking helps me forget. But it never goes away. Be it napalm or be it a campfire, it's still fire. It's always there, burning me."

"I'm sorry it's like that for you," I'd say.

"If I could stop, I would. But I don't act through hate or vengence or spite. I do this because I need to."

It made me feel sad for Rocky. He couldn't help it. But sadness would last for only a moment. He couldn't help it. He'd probably never stop. Could Rocky die? Was it possible for him to die and pass on? Could something bigger and meaner than him come along? I don't know. I didn't want to know. Rocky was scary, yes, but the idea of something bigger than him was scarier. "Rocky?" I asked.

"Yes?"

"...If I died, would we still be friends?"

Silence. Complete, dreadful silence. It was almost as if for the first time, Rocky wanted to be picky with how he worded things. After that dead air, he finally spoke: "Do you truly want the answer?"

Now it was my turn to be silent. I didn't want to know, but I knew. Nothing last forever. Nothing lasts eternally. One day, things die. In a way, my silence was my answer.

My knowledge about the after had once given me peace. Now it made me reconsider everything. I couldn't be near Rocky when I died. But what if there was an accident? What if a meteor fell on my house tonight? What if I got hit by a car? And what if Rocky was there?

These were things a child shouldn't have to think about. Rocky watched me sit in contemplation, opting to join me in it. Those long, sharp fingers resting on boney knees as he'd stare forward. How many times had he watched me sleep? How many more would he? Could I run from him? What if I went to space? Maybe then I could escape him? My "friend" became much less of a friend, much more of an omen with each passing thought and fantasy of how to get away from him.

I was so focused on myself that I hadn't considered death may come for someone else close to me.
