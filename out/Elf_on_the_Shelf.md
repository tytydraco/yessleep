December in Ridgewood was always perfect. Lights on every house, wreaths on every door, and the faint smell of pine in the crisp winter air. I loved this time of year, and so did my family.

We were unpacking decorations when Emma, my wife, pulled something from the bottom of the box. It was an old Elf on the Shelf, its red felt clothes faded and its painted eyes staring up at her.

“Where did this come from?” she asked, holding it up.

“Maybe your mom put it in there?” I suggested with a shrug. “Just put it out. The kids will love it.”

Emma hesitated but eventually placed the elf on the mantel above the fireplace. Max and Lily, our kids, were thrilled.

“What’s his name?” Max asked.

“Jingles!” Lily announced, clapping her hands.

Emma gave a faint smile, though she looked uneasy. Later that evening, while we were settling down for the night, she grabbed her phone and read aloud, “There are rules for these things, you know.”

“Rules?” I asked.

“Yeah, it’s part of the Elf on the Shelf tradition. Kids aren’t supposed to touch it, or it loses its magic. The elf moves to a new spot every night, and it’s supposed to watch the kids to make sure they’re behaving. It reports back to Santa.” She shuddered. “It’s kind of creepy if you think about it.”

I chuckled. “It’s just a toy, Emma. Don’t overthink it.”

But I couldn’t deny there was something unsettling about it, something about those painted eyes that felt too watchful.

The first night, Emma woke me up around 3 a.m.

“I heard something,” she whispered.

I groaned. “It’s probably nothing.”

But she insisted, so I followed her downstairs. The Christmas tree cast a warm glow over the living room. Everything looked normal, except for Jingles.

Emma froze. “Did you move him?” she asked.

“No,” I said, frowning.

The elf was leaning forward on the mantel. I couldn’t remember how Emma had positioned him, but she was certain he hadn’t been like that.

“The kids probably touched him,” I said, trying to calm her down. But her unease lingered, and to be honest, something about the way Jingles’ eyes caught the light made my skin crawl, too.

At 2 a.m. on the second night, Max woke up screaming.

I ran to his room, Emma right behind me. He was shaking, tears streaming down his face.

“It was him!” Max sobbed, pointing to the corner of the room. “Jingles! He was here! He was staring at me!”

I turned and saw the elf sitting on Max’s dresser, his painted grin illuminated by the moonlight.

Emma looked at me, her face pale. “How did it get in here?” she whispered.

“It’s just the kids messing around,” I said though my voice had a hint of doubt. I grabbed Jingles and brought him back downstairs, tossing him onto the mantel.

As I set him down, I swear I felt resistance, like his tiny arms clung to my fingers for a moment before letting go. I didn’t tell Emma. She was already rattled enough.

The next morning, Emma tried to convince me to leave. “Something is wrong, Greg,” she pleaded. “We should go, at least for a few days.”

I almost agreed just to keep the peace, but when I checked our bank account, I realized leaving wasn’t an option. Christmas had drained us, and we didn’t have the extra money for a hotel. “We can’t just leave the house,” I said. “We’d have to pack, and where would we even go?”

Emma pressed on. “What about my sister’s?”

“You think the kids will want to leave all their decorations and presents behind?” I countered. “Plus, your sister isn’t really a huge fan of me so I’d rather not spend Christmas constantly arguing with a brick wall. You’re just stressed, Em. It’s fine. I’ll take care of it.”

She reluctantly dropped the subject, but the tension in the house was unbearable.

At 3 a.m. on the third night, I woke to Emma screaming.

I ran into the kitchen and froze. “Merry Christmas!” was scrawled across the walls in jagged, crimson letters. At first, I thought it was paint, until I saw the bloody pawprints leading to the backyard.

Snowball, our cat, lay in the snow, her neck twisted at an impossible angle. Emma collapsed into my arms, sobbing.

I called the police, but they found nothing; no signs of a break-in, no footprints other than ours. Absolute squat. 

“It’s probably just some sick prank,” the officer said, though he looked me up and down with suspicious eyes.

When we came back inside, Jingles was sitting on the kitchen counter. His head was tilted slightly, his smile wider than before.

“Greg, we need to leave,” Emma said.

“We can’t,” I replied, feeling the weight of it all. “The cops are already suspicious, and what do we say? That a doll is doing this? They’ll think we’re crazy. We’ll figure this out.”

The power went out around midnight on the fourth night. I woke to the sound of faint, childlike giggles echoing through the house.

“Did you hear that?” Emma whispered, clutching my arm.

I grabbed a flashlight and crept downstairs, my pulse pounding in my ears. The beam of light swept across the living room and landed on the wall.

Scrawled there in jagged letters was:

“He sees you when you’re sleeping…”

My stomach twisted. The couch cushions were slashed open, stuffing spilling onto the floor.

Then I heard it: a soft scuttling sound behind me. I spun around and froze.

At the base of the stairs stood Jingles.

He wasn’t sitting anymore. He was standing.

His painted eyes gleamed in the flashlight beam, and his grin, it wasn’t the harmless painted smile I remembered. It had stretched into a jagged, open maw, revealing rows of needle-like teeth.

Emma screamed behind me.

By the fifth night, I was at my breaking point. I begged Emma to take the kids and leave, but she wouldn’t. “We’re not leaving you. We all leave or none of us do,” she said.

At 2 a.m., the screams started.

I bolted to Lily’s room and found her bed empty. The window was wide open, snow blowing in and covering the floor. Outside, small footprints led into the woods.

“No,” I whispered, panic clawing at my chest. “No, no, no!”

I ran to Max’s room. His bed was soaked in blood, the sheets a crimson mess. I staggered backward, bile rising in my throat.

“Why are you doing this?!” Emma screamed from behind me.

I turned to see her staring at the doorway.

Jingles stood there.

But he wasn’t the doll anymore. He was life-sized, his red suit darkened with blood. His painted eyes glinted with malice, and his mouth stretched wider than should have been possible. In one hand, he held a razor-sharp candy cane, the tip dripping with blood.

He tilted his head, his painted face twisting into something alive and cruel. “ ‘Tis the season,” he whispered.

I lunged at him, grabbing the fireplace poker and swinging with everything I had. The blow sent him flying into the wall.

For a moment, I thought it was over, until I heard Emma scream.

I turned to see Jingles standing behind her, his twisted grin even wider. He raised the candy cane high, and I ran toward her, shouting, “No!”

But I was too late.

Her scream was cut short as the light in her eyes faded. I dropped the poker, my hands trembling as Jingles turned toward me, his mouth curling into a silent laugh.

I don’t remember much after that. Just darkness.

When I woke, the house was quiet. Emma was gone. Max and Lily were gone. The only thing left was Jingles, sitting on the mantel, his painted eyes gleaming with satisfaction.

And in the corner of the room, I noticed two new dolls—one with Max’s brown hair and one with Lily’s blonde curls.

I stumbled out of the house, tears streaming down my face, with the sound of a high pitched giggle echoing behind me.  

I don’t know why Jingles came to our family. I don’t know what purpose he came with, I just know that the last I saw, Jingles was still in that house…and he was waiting for his next family….
