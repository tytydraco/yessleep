I recently recorded a story for a [podcast that I will share here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ceipQKqnTLzgH8JyGyA0W?si=Z2V3eaKHS-ys4oiq-4Df-Q) It’s something that has always given me the creeps and put me off ever returning to that location. 

I was dating my high school ex at the time and staying with him and his family in Oregon. We were up on some lookout area right around sunset and grabbed some fastfood and were eating in his jeep. It was getting dark, and there were these lights that were motion sensor when it was dark, so people coming from the trail to the parking lot could see. The sensors were at the edge of the trail, and one by one the last of the hikers left the trail coming to their cars. It had to be something big like a person to be able to set off the sensor too, wouldn't go off for just anything. 

We were the last ones there, and being horny we wanted to hook up. But I had this really weird feeling, like we were being watched. There was literally no one else there though. I didn't want to get out of the car even to shuffle the stuff in the backseat to put it in the front, this feeling was so strong and eerie. I made him stay in the car to move stuff around. We crawl into the back of the jeep and start kissing. 

That’s when the sensor light’s lit the entire car with blinding light. I jumped off the top of my boyfriend and looked around our surroundings. No one was in sight, they would have walked straight past us by now. I remember it feeling like a temp drop too in the car. We go back to hooking up and before long the same thing happens again. We are blinded by the lights a second time. The lights just kept turning on then back off. It was like someone was messing with us but for the life of us we couldn’t see anyone or anything. I was starting to really freak out (and it wasn't a general we are gonna get robbed sort of feeling - my ex had like 6 different black belts in a couple different martial arts). It got to the point it felt like whatever was watching us just felt closer. I could not explain it, and I just started to panic. Now at this point I’m on high alert and feel like my senses are really heightened. The next thing that took place sounds crazy and makes no sense, but it happened. We hear something outside of the car start to say my name. Not a normal person calling out to get my attention but something sinister.

The story gets a lot darker from this point on if you want to listen to my account in my own words please do so. I’m not the best with my written skills so I find it much easier to go into the detail that I feel the story deserves in my recording.
