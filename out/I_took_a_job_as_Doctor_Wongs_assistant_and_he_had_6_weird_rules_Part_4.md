Later that night, as darkness settled in, I found myself engrossed in a conversation with Doc. His words were mesmerizing, yet chilling, as he shared tales that defied logic and reason. It was then that he unveiled a hidden truth—the existence of an otherworldly entity known as The Void. Doc and his customers revered and obeyed it, referring to two known entities within it as The Judge and The Giver. The Giver granted wishes, while The Judge extracted a price, often taking away something valuable in return.  
  
One particular customer sought wealth and became a billionaire, paying the cost of just one year of her life to The Judge. However, the tragic twist was that she only had one year and one day remaining in her newfound riches. The Judge's fairness seemed cruel in its own way.  
  
Doc, with a hint of wisdom, whispered, "To outsmart The Judge, you must maintain a delicate balance—something it holds dear."  
  
Driven by love, Melissa, Doc's beloved wife, selflessly traded herself to The Giver, saving Doc from his battle with cancer. As a result, Melissa became The Giver's assistant for a lifetime. To restore the equilibrium of their lives, Doc offered himself as an assistant to The Judge, ensuring they would be reunited in their next life, walking the same path together.  
  
Over time, The Giver and The Judge developed a peculiar fondness for making deals with humans, particularly those from Earth. It was this realization that led Doc to establish his not-for-profit business, which acted as a conduit for these mysterious transactions.  
  
I couldn't help but inquire about the rules and the enigmatic tattoo that adorned Doc's skin. He explained that the rules regarding dogs and cats were indeed genuine, as these creatures served as overseers or entities connected to The Void. As for the tattoo, it symbolized my involvement in his and Melissa's journey—an invitation to enter the realm of The Void and return. However, the simplicity of my circular symbol puzzled him, as his tattoo was a bridge—a symbol representing the connection between two worlds.  
  
With a hint of humor, Doc remarked, "Thankfully, our business doesn't require a logo, or it would be quite dreadful."  
  
Grateful for his honesty, I expressed my condolences for Melissa's fate. However, I couldn't help but ponder my own desires and the future of my employment with Doc.  
  
"Thank you, Doc, for being so forthright. And I understand about Melissa. But, is it possible for me to quit this job? I don't have any specific wishes, but..."  
  
Before I could finish my sentence, Doc swiftly covered my mouth with his hand, his eyes filled with caution.  
  
"Don't say anything more. We will discuss this later. Just fulfill your commitment for the first month, as we initially agreed," he whispered in a hushed tone.  
  
On this particular day, the visitor was an elderly male who shared a friendship with Doc. As soon as he settled into his seat, the Cat exhibited its customary intuition, leaping onto his lap. Recognizing the cue, I guided him towards the Chamber—a place where mysterious transactions unfolded.  
  
As we neared the Chamber door, he turned his attention to me, his expression a mix of curiosity and scrutiny. "Why have you found your way here, young man? Has Doctor Wong woven some tricks within your mind? By the way, my name is Gary," he inquired, his hand gesturing towards the enigmatic door.  
  
With a steady demeanor, I met his gaze head-on. "Doctor Wong's is very kind, I am here of my own volition" I replied, my tone resolute.  
  
His gaze continued to search mine, as if seeking an answer beneath the surface. "You possess potential at this young age, son. Do not confine yourself to this place, much like the old man. Consider a different path—join my enterprise. We could harness the courage of a man unafraid to embrace opportunity. Here's my name card; reach out when you're ready to step beyond your comfort zone," he proposed, extending the card towards me.  
  
I accepted the card gracefully, yet my loyalty remained steadfast. "I am grateful for your offer, Mr. Gary, but for now, I am committed to aiding Doctor Wong."  
  
A knowing smile played upon his lips as he studied me. "Very well, then," he acknowledged, his demeanor hinting at a deeper understanding. With a final nod, he crossed the threshold into the Chamber.  
  
In that fleeting moment, the weight of choices and their subsequent repercussions echoed in my mind. Each encounter, every decision, felt like threads being woven into a grand tapestry of fate—a tapestry that I was still deciphering, one offering both intrigue and uncertainty.  
  
The following day, as I awoke with lingering questions, I felt an overwhelming urge to consult the notebook for answers. Something felt amiss, as if Doc had only divulged a fraction of the truth. Setting out to Doc's house, I discovered it empty, with no sign of his presence. Determined to proceed, I began preparing for the day's tasks outlined in the notebook.  
  
According to Doc, the only rules that held true were the ones concerning the Dog and Cat entities. While skeptical, my instincts warned me of dire consequences should I dare to defy those rules. As the first customer of the day, a familiar elderly friend of Doc's arrived. The Cat leaped onto his lap the moment he sat.  
  
The encounter with Mr. Gary had left a mark on me, a hint of both intrigue and caution. While I remained committed to my role as Doc's assistant, the name card from Mr. Gary lingered in my pocket, an unspoken invitation to a different path. As I navigated through the day's tasks, my thoughts frequently drifted back to the enigmatic notebook that now resided in my possession.  
  
Doc's instructions echoed in my mind: "Use it anywhere, anytime you need but never let the Visitor know you can use its power." Those words seemed to imply that the notebook held a power beyond what I had initially perceived. However, my attempts to replicate any of the notebook's previous effects had been met with disappointment—it remained stubbornly ordinary.  
  
Later that evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, I retreated to my room, the notebook in hand. Its pages seemed to call out to me, a silent invitation to explore its potential further. Determined to understand its true nature, I began writing a series of questions, each carefully crafted to unveil the secrets I so desperately sought.  
  
"Why do the Judge and the Giver interact with humans? What is their purpose? And what lies beyond The Void?"  
  
I watched as the ink dried on the pages, anticipation building within me. But once again, the notebook remained unchanged, its secrets guarded against my prying inquiries. Frustration gnawed at me, mingling with a sense of awe for the unseen forces that dictated its responses.  
  
Exhausted from the day's revelations, I laid down on my bed, the notebook resting on my chest. As I closed my eyes, sleep quickly overtook me. In my dreams, I found myself standing on a vast and surreal landscape—a sea of swaying grass under a purple sky. It was a realm caught between two worlds, an uncanny in-between where reality and uncertainty merged. As I walked forward, a sense of foreboding crept over me. I could feel a presence behind me, yet when I turned, there was nothing but emptiness, a void stretching into oblivion.  
  
"Don't turn back!" a voice warned, both familiar and haunting. Startled, I awoke in my bed, beads of sweat clinging to my skin. The notebook lay open beside me, a message etched upon its pages: "DON'T TURN BACK," a stark reminder of the dream's urgency.  
  
With trembling fingers, I turned the page once more, revealing a tiny inscription tucked away in the corner. The words read, "Knowledge is the curse" It was as if the notebook itself had acknowledged my presence, acknowledging me as a participant in the intricate dance of deals and desires.
