After Set

A Poetic Cry For Help

1

A Hum Of Light

Backstage at the Ha-Ha-Hut is narrow and familiar. Metal stairs rise near the center, each step lined with yellow stickers reading “Stairway to Heaven.” A few green doors and one orange mark the comics’ green rooms, one jokingly labeled “Oops, ran out of paint, be back soon.” A hidden door leads toward the bar, tucked behind curtains so performers can slip in and out unnoticed. In the center, the painted stage door waits, worn and creaking. Push it, and the stage is there.

A roar of cheers breaks through the walls, muffled but growing louder. Then the voice cuts clear through the haze of smoke and light: “You know him! You love him! Stephen Thompson!!!”

I climb the stairs and step through the door. The room opens around me. Smoke drifts lazily in the still air, curling over round tables scattered in neat rows, each crowned with four chairs and a single lamp casting a warm glow onto sticky leather drink menus. One menu still lists a cocktail no one makes anymore: The Jester’s Revenge.

My gaze sweeps from left to right. Red velvet curtains sag where rips have been patched with more curtains, layered like bandages over old wounds. Tiny tiki torches flicker faintly behind folds, ghosts trapped by remodels long forgotten. Theater lights rise from the floor toward the ceiling like a hesitant marquee; some bulbs are dead, their absence noticeable only if you look for them. The hand-painted beach mural stretches across the back wall, a crooked seagull forever forgetting how to fly.

The kitchen hums softly, pans clanging, wings sizzling, beer cans hissing—all muted here, softened into the background of the room. Every detail feels like a familiar note in a song I know by heart: the squeak of a chair, the flicker of a lamp, the faint tang of cleaner mixing with ash and fried food.

And that’s the difference. This is mine. Every table, every lamp, every curtain fold, every crooked seagull—it fits together like pieces in a Lego set. I can follow the instructions, understand the mechanics, and predict what happens next. Up there, in the circle of light, I know exactly how to move, where to place my weight, when the laugh will come, when it will fade. The chaos outside the walls of the Hut—the bills, the dead-end jobs, the things I cannot control—does not exist here. Here, there is only rhythm, pattern, precision.

I duck slightly under the fake palm trees scattered across the stage, their fronds hanging low enough to make me feel fourteen feet tall, a jungle of humor and light. Sweat from the beaming lights makes my thick black glasses slide down the bridge of my nose. I push them back up, and the motion is almost ritual—tiny reset, a reminder that I am here, in control, steady in the rhythm of the room.

And then, just like that, it’s over. Thirty minutes of laughter, motion, mastery—and the spell is broken. The lights, the smoke, the familiar pulse of the Hut, the world bending exactly to the rhythm I know—all stripped away as I step back through the painted beach-themed door. Heaven collapses into hallway air. The green rooms wait silently along the wall—three green, one orange—cool, dim, and unforgiving. The LIVE sign glows faintly above, a quiet echo of the circle I just left. My fun, my control, my small kingdom of rhythm, all pulled from me. I am back to the other side, back to myself, back to the small, narrow world behind the stage.

I start walking down the corridor toward the green rooms. The door looms ahead, painted like part of a sunlit beach, but I know what waits on the other side: shadows, the dim hum of muted lights, the scent of old wood and cigars. The Hut’s laughter has faded, and I carry it with me only as a memory.

Between Sets    

I close the painted beach door behind me, the faint echo of applause still vibrating in my chest. The circle of light, the smoke, the rhythm, the control—all gone. I am stripped bare. Back here, the green room waits. Four walls, one small couch, a desk with a mirror, a single bulb strung from the ceiling. The yellow warmth of the Hut is replaced by a harsher glow, tinged blue and green, cold enough to remind me that I am not out there. Not now.

I lock the door. The click is louder than I expect, final in its own way. I sit on the couch, hands gripping the edge, knees pressed together. Silence stretches in every direction. It moves differently here—slow, heavy, unfamiliar. Every thought is louder. Every heartbeat counts. Without the stage, without the lights, without the controlled chaos, I am hollow.

I stare at the mirror on the desk. The face looking back is mine, but not quite. The mask is gone. I can see it now. The shell trembles. I don’t know who I am outside of that room, outside of the warmth, outside of the laughter. I am nothing. A boy in thick black glasses, frozen in the echo of applause that has long faded.

The minutes crawl. I think of things to do—count the cracks in the wall, the dust on the desk, the faint burn of the bulb—but none of it fills the absence. I pace, sit, pace again. My mind claws at itself. I think of what I could do to pass the time, to fill the void, but nothing exists here to guide me. I am unmade.

I yearn for the stage. I long for the light, the smell of smoke, the hum of the kitchen behind the crowd. I want it back so badly I can taste it. This green room is a cage. I am trapped in a body that can’t perform. The Hut was my world, my heaven. Here, I am not even human. Here, I am the waiting, the longing, the shadow of myself.

I close my eyes and dream. I see the stage. I feel the lights. The audience laughs in waves that shake the walls. I stretch my arms wide, take the floor in my hands. I am fourteen feet tall again, ducking under the palm trees, the circle of light moving as I move. The world bends to the rhythm I know. But the second I open my eyes, the green light stabs at my skin. The floorboards are just floorboards. The couch is just a couch. I am just me, and I am not enough.

Reflection

The green light hums above me, faint, constant, unforgiving. Its glow pools unevenly across the walls, leaving shadows that creep like water. I sit at the desk, staring into the mirror, my own face staring back. And then—it isn’t just mine. Not the Stephen Thompson who walked the stage moments ago. My eyes widen as I trace the hollowing of my cheeks, the tremor in my lips, the way my skin seems almost translucent under the cold light. I cannot look away. The mirror pulls me in. It swallows the edges of the room, the walls, the bulb above, and all that exists is me, me, me… and them.

I hear it then. The call. The roar of cheers, muffled but insistent, the same voice: “You know him! You love him! Stephen Thompson!!!” My chest pounds. The lights, the smoke, the warmth, the rhythm—I crave it like air. I lunge for the door. My hands grip the handle. I push. I pull. I slam my shoulder into it. Nothing. Locked. Final.

And then I see them.

The first sits huddled in a corner, knees drawn up, ribs sharp, skin stretched tight over bones that jut unnaturally. Its eyes are wide and wet, reflecting nothing, yet somehow everything. I watch and cannot look away. Time passes and it does not age normally—it withers, shrinks, collapsing in on itself like candle wax melting too quickly. Fingers curl, nails cracking and falling, skin cracking with every breath. Hair loosens in clumps, scattering across the floor like brittle leaves.

Another stands in the middle of the room, moving the desk with jerky, mechanical motions. It positions it, centers it. The dangling bulb sways slightly. The figure steps forward, wraps a rope around its neck, and kicks, struggles, gasps, head crimson, eyes hollow, the body twitching violently until the motions repeat again, endlessly.

More emerge from the shadows. Some are younger versions of me, waiting, hands pressed to the wall, staring at the door as though it will swing open for the call that will never come. Some are older, skin sagging, eyes sunken, nails long and curling, hair gray or gone, trembling. They do not move except to watch, except to wait. I see one slowly collapse in reverse, becoming thinner, skeletonized, chewing at its own hands until nothing remains but bone and dried sinew.

I glance at the mirror again. My reflection splits, fractures. The versions of me behind the glass move independently, gesturing, screaming silently. Their mouths shape words I cannot hear. Their eyes bleed shadow. One touches its own throat as if to scream, another rocks gently back and forth on the floor, eyelids fluttering like moth wings.

I try to retreat from the mirror, from the shadows, from myself. My hands shake violently. My legs are weak. My heart hammers so hard it hurts, echoing in my ears like the muted applause I long to hear. The door remains locked. The painted beach door—my bridge to warmth, to life—is unyielding.

I open my eyes. The green light stabs at my skin. The floorboards are plain wood. The couch sags. The bulb swings lazily. The mirror reflects my hollowed face—and the dozen others staring back. Their eyes are empty, their hands twisted, their mouths moving in silence. My stomach knots. My hands go cold. My knees shake.

I am trapped. Locked behind the painted beach door, surrounded by impossible shadows, with versions of myself that are fragments, failures, witnesses, and warnings. Whispers curl around the walls, murmurs I cannot place, laughter that isn’t mine, and yet I feel it in my bones. The Hut—the warmth, the rhythm, the audience—is gone. My fun, my control, my identity—they have been stolen. The green room swallows me whole, and I can do nothing but watch, listen, and wait.

I sink to the floor, back against the wall, staring into the mirror until the reflections blur, until the light hums in rhythm with my pulse, until I can no longer distinguish my own breath from the gasps and twitches of the ones who have been waiting for years, for decades, for that call that will never come.

And then—soft, tentative, almost polite—a knock at the door.

Deal

The knock rattles the green room door again. Harder this time.

“Stephen,” a voice calls, low and stern. No warmth. No name. Just a command.

My chest seizes. I push myself from the couch, legs unsteady, palms clammy. The door groans as I lean into it, forehead pressed against the painted wood.

“Time,” the voice says, firm and final.

My hand finds the knob. Cold. I twist. This time it opens.

Light pours through, golden and hot, wiping the sweat from my skin, washing me clean. For a moment the Hut returns—smoke drifting lazily, the lamps glowing like halos, the hum of laughter just out of reach. I step forward and the stage embraces me, erasing the green, the cold, the mirror. For one fragile moment, I am whole.

But the room is silent.

Every table is full, every lamp lit, every seat taken, yet no one laughs. Rows of eyes glint in the dark, wide and glassy, staring through me. My throat tightens. I clear it, force a smile, raise my arms, and begin my rhythm. But nothing. Not a grin. Not a twitch. Just a sea of faces, frozen, their silence heavier than stone.

Minutes pass. Hours. The lamps dim, the smoke thickens, the air curdles. I pace the stage, my voice cracking as I beg for sound, for life, for anything. My heart scrapes itself raw. My skin prickles. I can feel the color draining from me, my hands turning ashen, my cheeks sinking, the warmth leeching out.

“Is it not enough?” I scream, voice shredding. “Am I not enough?”

Silence.

Tears rise unbidden, hot and shameful. They streak down my cheeks. The weight of my sobs drags me to my knees. And then—soft, quick, sharp—a chuckle.

I freeze. Wipe my eyes. The laughter dies. I cry again, deeper this time, shaking, desperate—and the sound grows louder. Dozens now. Then hundreds. A roar of amusement that rattles the floor beneath me.

The crowd leans forward, faces warping, teeth glinting. Their joy is a knife.

“Is this what you want?” I wail, voice raw. “A painted pig? A jester? A show monkey dancing for your hunger?”

They erupt, howling, shrieking, pounding the tables, delighting in my collapse. The roar swallows me whole.

I crawl backward, pressing myself into the fake palm trees, clutching at their painted trunks like a child. I ball myself tight, curling smaller and smaller, trying to hide, to vanish, to silence them.

The door slams open.

I crawl back through it yearning for this feeling to end.

And I am back in the green room. Alone. The bulb sways. The mirror watches. My breath scrapes shallow, shallow, shallow. I sit, shaking, unable to tell if my body ever left the chair.

Maybe I never stepped onto that stage. Maybe the stage stepped into me.

Why?

The door slams behind me, and the bulb overhead swings like a pendulum. It creaks as it sways, back and forth, a low, scraping rhythm. Ha… Ha… Ha… It sounds like laughter, thin and cruel, leaking from the ceiling itself.

I stumble forward and collapse onto the couch, hands clutching my face. The sobs tear out of me in jagged bursts, each one louder, wetter, more broken than the last. My chest heaves. My throat burns. I don’t want to breathe anymore. I don’t want to sit here anymore.

The green room was never comfort. The stage was my sanctuary—the lights, the noise, the heat. That was where I lived, where I could disappear. This room was just a place to crawl into, a corner to hide in, somewhere to escape when the stage became too much. But now even this feels wrong. It’s cold and blue and stale, pressing down on me until I can barely move.

What is this feeling? What’s happening to me?

Why doesn’t it work anymore?

I punch the arm of the couch. Once. Twice. Harder the third time. My knuckles sting. My temples throb. Rage bubbles up so hot I can taste it, metallic and bitter, filling my mouth until I gag.

The Hut was supposed to save me. The stage was supposed to fix me. For half an hour I was alive—a god with smoke and light bending to me. And now? Now I’m rotting in this room, sobbing like a child, weaker than ever.

“You’re pathetic,” I spit at myself. My voice echoes back, harsher, like the walls are sneering.

I look at the mirror.

It looks at me.

The face staring back isn’t mine anymore. The skin sags. The eyes are sunken. The lips curl, mocking. It’s me, but it isn’t—it’s every failed version of me I’ve ever feared.

I scream and lunge forward, fists crashing into the glass. It shatters with a shriek, shards exploding across the desk and floor, slicing my skin. My reflection splinters into a thousand Stephens, each jagged shard holding a twisted piece of me: wide-eyed, toothless, laughing, crying, aging, decaying.

Blood runs down my knuckles, dripping onto the wood. I don’t care. I want them gone. I want me gone.

My sobs return, heavier, hoarse. My chest rattles with each broken breath. The shards glitter on the ground like stars I’ll never reach.

I sink back into the couch, shaking, staring at my bleeding hands. I whisper, over and over, “Why doesn’t it work anymore? Why doesn’t it work?”

The bulb swings above me. Ha… Ha… Ha… The shards stare up from the floor. The green room waits, patient, silent.

The Painted Pig

Silence. The bulb above me has stopped swinging. It hangs dead, casting a sickly green glow over the couch, the shards, my hands. I stare at them until the blood dries and flakes, until I can’t tell where the cuts end and my skin begins.

If someone came to the door right now, I don’t think I’d answer. Not even if they called my name. Not even if they told me it was time. Why would I? What’s waiting for me out there besides another thirty minutes of pretending?

Beyond the Hut, there’s nothing but a clock-punching life — a dead-end job where they say if I work hard, swallow my pride, do everyone’s slop, maybe I’ll move up someday. A cookie-cutter man in a uniform smile. Shaking hands. Nodding. Swallowing my words. Then coming home to sit in the dark, staring at the clock until it’s time to do it again. A mule walking in circles, working the field, waiting for a drink of water that never comes.

And they tell me to get help. “You’ll get better,” they say. “You’re not alone.”

Where the fuck are they then?

Where are they when I’m here, staring at the mirror, bleeding onto the floor? Where are they when I’m onstage, dancing like a painted pig for their hunger? Laughing when it’s convenient, vanishing when it’s not.

Words are just words. Promises are noise.

I’ve always been the one they forget about after work. The afterthought. The filler act. The man they laugh at onstage and forget on the way to their cars.

The Hut used to feel like mine. The stage used to feel like heaven. But now even that feels like a joke I can’t stop telling, a punchline I never wrote.

I stare at the door. The paint looks thin now, brittle. If I opened it, would there even be a stage left? Would there even be a world?

I sink deeper into the couch. My hands tremble in my lap. For the first time I can remember, I don’t crave the stage. I don’t crave the light. I crave nothing.

The bulb buzzes faintly, like a fly trapped in glass. Ha… ha… ha…

I close my eyes. I don’t answer. I don’t move.

Where Next?

The green room holds its breath. The air feels heavy, thick, as if the walls themselves are closing in. The smell of sweat and old wood lingers, sour and stale. A faint hum from the ceiling light buzzes in and out, not rhythmic, just aimless — like static crawling through my skull.

This was never my sanctuary. The green room had always been a cage I crawled into to escape the stage. The stage — that was supposed to be mine. The light, the noise, the smoke. That was where I belonged. That was where I could breathe. Now even that feels like a stranger. Now the green room is all I have, a place I hate but cannot leave.

I drop onto the couch, fists pressed to my eyes until they ache. I can still see the crowd’s faces, blank and cold, staring through me. Every set is a funeral, every laugh is a phantom. I want to scream but my throat is shredded. Instead, my hand twists and I slam it into the couch cushion, over and over. The stuffing bursts at the seams like a wound. I keep punching until my knuckles sting.

“Save me,” I whisper. “Fix me.” My voice is gone, more breath than sound. Nothing answers. Not God. Not the Hut. Not me.

My eyes drift to the floor. A shard of glass glints under the weak ceiling light — a sliver of mirror left from my own fury. I pick it up. It’s cold. Heavy. Alive.

I cross the room to the desk. My hands shake as I set the glass down, fingers trembling like someone else’s. I pull a scrap of paper from my pocket, smooth it flat, and begin to write. The last joke.

“With a room full of people laughing and pointing, I am but a mere escape for them. But one cannot truly escape oneself. Like a poorly drawn bird, I am forced to fly always. Never resting.”

I put the pen down. My hands hover over the glass. The cut across my wrist is shallow, theatrical — a performance wound. Blood beads and runs down my arm, pooling dark on the desk. Not enough. Not yet.

The stress of life is too much for a simple cry for help. No stage, no laugh, no applause. Just me. Alone.

I lift the shard slowly. Higher. My breath hitches. The edge touches my neck. Cold. Sharp. I draw it across.

Warmth spills. My vision blurs. The green room sways. I hear the faintest echo of laughter somewhere behind the walls — high, warped, inhuman.

Fraud

There is no darkness.

I should be gone. The blade slid across my throat. The warmth of blood, the final breath. That should have been it. But instead, I open my eyes. The couch. The mirror. The bulb overhead. All still here.

Only it isn’t the same.

The walls breathe. The paint shifts like oil on water, green streaks bending into faces that never quite form. The couch sags under me, deeper and deeper, as though it’s trying to swallow me whole. The mirror is cracked — not just a single line but spiderweb fractures radiating from its center, each shard catching my reflection in pieces.

I stand but my legs feel wrong, too light, too far away from me. I look down. My shirt is clean. No blood. No blade. No wound.

“Fraud,” a voice whispers. It’s not coming from the door. It’s inside the room. Inside me.

I stumble toward the desk where my last joke still lies. The words are there, but rewritten in a hand that isn’t mine:

You wanted escape. You wanted applause. You wanted forgiveness. But all you ever built was a cage.

I back away. The green room’s door stands open now, but what’s beyond it isn’t the Hut. It’s a hallway of mirrors stretching into black. Each reflection shows me at a different stage: performing, sobbing, bleeding, smiling, dying.

I press my palm to the doorway but it’s like cold glass. My own reflection presses back, smiling a false smile.

“You’re not Stephen,” it says. “You’re what’s left when Stephen is gone.”

My knees go weak. I don’t know if I’m alive, dead, or somewhere in between. The only thing I know is that the Hut — my heaven, my limbo — is gone. And all I have left is this echo of a room that looks like comfort but isn’t, filled with a thousand versions of me, all rehearsing the same joke.

You Know Him…

The green room is gone. In its place: a cavern of ice, walls veined with frozen cracks, a ceiling so low it feels like the sky is collapsing. Frost climbs the furniture until the couch looks carved from marble, the desk a tombstone. The air cuts my throat with every breath. My fingertips sting.

The mirror still stands, but its glass has turned opaque white. No reflection, no room, just a faint shimmer like frozen water under moonlight.

And then — the door. It stands open across the room, warm light spilling out. Golden smoke drifts through, curling like fingers, carrying laughter with it — soft, nostalgic, promising. The Hut. The stage. The one place I used to know.

My heart twists. My body leans forward before my mind can stop it. I could go back. I could step through and be washed in that light, let it stitch me back together one more time. For a moment I imagine it: the warmth on my face, the glow erasing my sins, applause filling the cracks in me.

But I stop. My shoes grind against ice. My hands tremble at my sides.

It’s a bandage. A single stitch on a severed arm. A stage, not a sanctuary.

I whisper to no one: “It won’t fix me.”

The ice creeps higher, wrapping my legs, my ribs, my throat. The Hut’s glow flickers. The laughter thins to a hiss, then a crackle, then nothing at all. Only the mirror remains, its frost clearing just enough for me to see myself — pale, hollow, eyes open.

For the first time, I don’t reach for the door. I turn toward the mirror instead. My breath fogs its surface. My own eyes stare back, steady and unblinking.

I want the warmth. God, I want it. But I know now what it is.

The door swings shut on its own, muffling the last ghost of laughter. The room darkens to blue, then black.

I sit on the frozen couch, hands folded, waiting — not for applause, not for a knock, but for whatever comes next.

Explain

This was never just a story about a man named Stephen. This was never just a dive into a crumbling stage, a green room, a crowd of laughing ghosts.

This was me. Spencer Toy.

This was how I feel, day after day — the swinging between wanting to be seen and wanting to vanish, the ache of being a shell, the warmth I crave and the cold that always comes back. Writing Stephen was my way of making the inside of my head visible, of showing what it’s like to live in that space between heaven and hell.

This is my cry for help. My way of saying, “I’m here, and I’m hurting,” without a punchline to soften it. I don’t have the answers. I don’t know how to wrap it up neatly. I only know that I’m still here, still breathing, still writing.

If you’re reading this, know that this isn’t fiction. It’s me.
