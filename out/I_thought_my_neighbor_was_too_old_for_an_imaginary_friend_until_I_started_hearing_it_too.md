Prior to this morning, I hadn't seen a doctor since I was nine, so I can't help but wonder: is it normal to feel this defeated after receiving lab results? I only stopped by the clinic because I recently got health insurance and wanted to take advantage. Here I was thinking of myself as some indestructible specimen, too fit to waste my time with so-called preventative care, meanwhile I've got the lab results of a sickly Victorian child and a middle-aged alcoholic all rolled into one. Elevated liver enzymes, anemia, borderline blood pressure, high cholesterol, low vitamin D, you name it.



Needless to say, it was an unpleasant start to the day. I swung by a grocery store to pick up some food and vitamins that my doctor had recommended, and the exorbitant prices only added to my foul mood. I grabbed a bottle of Jack as a consolation to myself, but for the sake of my liver, I'll take a break from drinking once I finish it off. Pinky promise.



Anyway, today's a national holiday, which meant that I had all day to drink, feel sorry for myself, and reflect on how I might've turned out different if it weren't for one particular friendship I forged in my youth. I figure, since I've got nothing else to do, why don't I try jotting it down for the first time? 



Although I am happy to call California home these days, I grew up in northern South Dakota. My hometown was full of natural beauty, and I often find myself reminiscing about long days spent traipsing through the prairie. However, my county also had a lot of poverty, and my family was one of the poorest in town. It didn't help that my mother struggled with hoarding (which is a story for another, longer post), and my inability to invite kids to my house made it difficult to make friends.



When I was eight years old, a new family moved into my neighborhood, and to my selfish delight, were quickly eschewed by the rest of town. The family was composed of a father, a mother, and their eight-year-old son, Cooper. Unfortunately, I can't remember the parents' names, but I remember what they looked like. The father was a giant, burly guy with a thick head of red hair and a long beard to match. By my guess, he was somewhere in his mid fifties. The mother had dark brown hair and green eyes, an athletic build and a permanent scowl. Cooper had his mother's brown hair and his father's brown eyes, and a cheerful disposition that I can only assume skipped his parents' generation. 



The family moved into a decrepit Queen Anne a few blocks from my house, and seemed to have little intention of fixing the place up. In just a few months, the father established himself as a bit of a creep—a label corroborated by the fact that his wife looked about twenty years old. The women and girls in my town gave him a wide berth, and the men disparaged his condescending attitude and propensity for bar brawls. Despite the family's reputation, I regarded their moving to my town as a stroke of good luck: Cooper, after all, was not only my age, but had been born only a day before myself. I did everything in my power to befriend him, and since he had as few options as I did, the two of us were thick as thieves in no time. 



Given his dad's reputation, I never told my parents about my friendship with Cooper. For months, the two of us would meet up after school and play catch or soccer at the park until the sun went down. He was a real energetic kid, and I was always exhausted after spending an afternoon with him, but he was also cheerful and kind. After a while, we'd grown close enough that he invited me over to his house for dinner, and I accepted. 



Cooper's parents were none too pleased to have me over, but at least they didn't say anything to my face about it. Dinner was some bland, frozen meal that, notably, wasn't all the way thawed in some places, but I was just happy to be sitting down at a real table that wasn't piled up to the ceiling with junk. I spent a lot of that first dinner stealing glances at Cooper's mom. The town gossip was right—she really did look half her husband's age. Even at eight years old, when everyone over sixteen seemed ancient, I could tell that there was a significant age gap between the two. It made me question how old she was when she gave birth to Cooper. 



After dinner, hoping to score some points, I volunteered myself (and Cooper) to clear the table. Just a few seconds after his parents left the dining room, I heard a series of strange sounds from directly above my head: two soft *thuds* and then a light dragging sound. I heard that sequence three times, and then someone turned on the television in the living room, drowning out whatever was going on upstairs. I shot Cooper a questioning glance. The only way one of his parents could have reached the second floor so quickly was by sprinting, which I'm certain we would have heard from the kitchen. 



"What was that?"



"That's just Lady. She lives upstairs"



"'Lady'? What is she, a dog?" 



"No, just … A woman who helps take care of me. You know, like a live-in nanny."



I had only ever heard the word "nanny" used when poking fun at rich folk. I thought, *man, Cooper must be richer than I thought if his family can afford a nanny*. I was so swept up in fantasies of Cooper's secret wealth that I didn't consider *why* the family needed a nanny. His mom didn't work, and Cooper spent most of his days at school or outside with me. I didn't spend much time thinking about it though; I was too focused on enjoying an evening with my first real friend. I walked home that night with a skip in my step, already looking forward to the next time I would see him. 



Christ, down to the neck already. I should stop at the label. I don't see how I'm gonna finish this otherwise. 



After that initial dinner, I visited Cooper's house often. Though it wasn't particularly cozy or clean, I loved being in a home that wasn't filled with clutter. We generally stuck to the first floor of the house, playing video games or simulating elaborate battles with my friend's action figures. I caught a few brief glimpses of the second floor when retrieving a game or toy from Cooper's room, but I didn't get as much opportunity to snoop around as I would have liked. 



One day, while Cooper was in the downstairs bathroom, I went upstairs to grab one specific action figure, then lingered in the hallway. There were four doors on the second floor, not counting the one to my friend's bedroom. I knew one of them led to Cooper's dad's office, and one opened to a small linen closet. Curiosity getting the better of me, I decided to take the rare opportunity to explore the remaining two. 



As quietly as I could, I walked down the hall to the first mysterious door. Thankfully, despite the rusting hinges, it opened without making much noise. The room was just a boring half-bathroom. The only vaguely interesting thing in it was a bottle of dark brown hair dye on the sink. I figured it must belong to Cooper's mother, and found myself idly wondering what color her natural hair was. 



Afterwards, I exited the bathroom and made my way down the hall, stopping in front of the other closed door. I assumed that door led to Cooper's parents' room, as that was the only room in the house that I hadn't yet accounted for. I reached out an arm and placed it on the doorknob before something gave me pause. 



There was, without a doubt, something inside the room. Not only could I hear faint movement, but I could also *smell* something damp and deeply unpleasant within. I took a step back, unfortunately stepping directly on a creaky floorboard that alerted whoever was inside to my presence. The noises ceased immediately, and I waited in silence for a minute, unsure what to expect now that I'd been caught. 



*But who caught me?* Cooper's dad was at work and his mom was downstairs in the kitchen. It must've been his elusive nanny, who I was still yet to meet. But why was she in Cooper's parents' room with the door locked? 



*Thud thud. Drag. Thud thud. Drag.*



I turned around and hurried toward the stairs. Once I got to the landing, I put a hand on the old wooden banister to steady myself and descended a few steps. Then, to see if I was being followed, I glanced over my shoulder to see if the bedroom door had been opened. 



The door was still closed, and yet, there was someone staring at me. Directly in my line of sight, peeking through the slit beneath the door, was an eye. 



I ran down the rest of the stairs so fast I almost tripped and rolled down them. Once I reached the bottom, I caught my breath and tried to compose myself. I had to walk through the kitchen to get back to the living room, and didn't want Cooper's mom to know that I'd been snooping around in her house. I cast one more glance at the top of the stairs. When I saw no one, I took a deep breath and walked into the kitchen. 



Cooper's mom was leaning against the kitchen island, smoking a cigarette and reading the paper. Apparently I didn't have half the poker-face that I thought I had, because she immediately asked me, "Everything alright, Ethan?" 



"Yeah," I said in as disaffected a tone as I could muster. "I was just saying hello to Lady." 



She studied me for a moment, eyes narrowing. 



"To who?" 



" … Uh, to Cooper's nanny? To the woman in your bedroom?" 



I watched a series of emotions flicker across her face: annoyance, confusion, and finally, fear. She stubbed out her cigarette on the countertop and ushered me into the living room, telling me to stay downstairs. Then, she turned and made her way toward the stairwell. I heard her cautious footsteps on the old wood as she ascended. 



My friend was back in the living room by the time I returned. He asked me what was wrong, and I relayed the situation to him. Every few sentences, I would pause and strain my ears, trying to hear what was going on upstairs. For a moment, I could've sworn I heard someone talking. 



"What's going on, man? Your mom acted like she didn't know who I was talking about." 



Cooper stared at his shoes, obviously conflicted. He seemed to be mustering up the courage to say something, but before he had the opportunity, his mother re-entered the living room, the anger plain on her face. 



"There's no one up there," she snapped at me, then focused her attention on her son. "Were you scaring your poor friend with this 'Lady' business again?"



When my friend remained silent, his mother gave an exasperated sigh. She told me that I ought to head home, and for once, I was happy to oblige. The air inside the house had adopted a kind of heaviness that refused to dissipate, even after Cooper's mom confirmed that the three of us were alone in the house. My friend remained silent even as I bid him goodbye and walked through the front door. 



Cooper's mom followed me out to their porch, gently placing a hand on my shoulder. I thought I was about to be reprimanded, but instead she said:



"Cooper's a good kid. He just … He can't quite let go of his imaginary friend. She's been around since he was a baby—following us to every house we've ever lived in. His 'white-eyed lady'. I don't know where he got it from, but I hope you're not too mad at him for misleading you. You're his best friend, you know." 



She gave my arm a squeeze and turned around, walking back into her ramshackle house. I thought about stopping her, about telling her exactly what I'd seen, but I didn't know how to communicate that despite her insistence on imaginary friends, I too had seen Lady. And moreso, even though I had never been given a physical description by my friend, the eye I'd seen under the door had indeed been a milky bluish-white. 



God, my head hurts. Forgot what I said earlier, about the label. The warmth is nice, at least. It was always so cold in that fucking house.



After that day, I stopped hanging out with Cooper. I didn't meet up with him at the park after school, and I certainly didn't go to his house for the biweekly dinners that had become part of our routine. 



I wasn't mad that he had lied to me; while I'd never had an imaginary friend, I knew how real they could seem for some kids. Even if he was a little old for one, I didn't think his stories about Lady were born from malice or deceit. I was mad at him because in telling me about Lady, he had opened some door in my mind that I couldn't seem to shut. I started having vivid, prolonged nightmares in which I was chased through my home by a woman with white eyes. I started hallucinating faint knocking sounds in my house, either from behind my headboard or from the ceiling directly above me. I had never been a superstitious kid; I never even believed in Santa Clause. And yet, I couldn't help but wonder if my friend's old house was haunted somehow, and if whatever was in that house had followed me home. 



This intermission didn't last very long. Not one week after the incident, Cooper showed up on my doorstep, looking like he was about to burst into tears. He apologized profusely for tricking me, professing that he would never do so again and asking if we return to the way things had been before. I forgave him, of course. What other choice did I have? He was all I had, and I knew I was all he had, too. 



We slowly settled into our old ways. For months, we solely hung out outdoors, venturing further into the grasslands outside of town with each new expedition. The onset of autumn made this increasingly difficult, and by the end of daylight savings, Cooper's mom enacted a strict curfew. Rather than spend my evenings alone at home, I started returning to Cooper's house. 



For weeks, everything was fine. Sometimes I would smell or hear something that I couldn't place, but Cooper always offered a reasonable explanation. "Just the house settling," he'd say. Or, "Must be time to take out the trash." He never mentioned Lady again. I guess his parents finally told him that it was time to grow up.



I spent Thanksgiving at Cooper's that year. In some ways, I felt like I had been adopted into the family, but in others, I felt like his parents harbored a deep distrust toward me. His father in particular, who had always intimidated me, watched me like a hawk every time he was around. I was thankful that he was usually out of the house when I came over. 



On December 13, 2011, I had my first and last sleepover at Cooper's house. The 13th was Cooper's ninth birthday, and the 14th was mine, so the sleepover was a special treat. We had begged and begged his mom for the chance until she finally relented, with the caveat that we couldn't leave the bedroom after 10 PM. My friend explained that this rule was enforced so as not to disturb his dad, who had to be up early for work. Those days, my friend had an explanation for everything. 



My friend didn't have a blow-up mattress or even a spare sleeping bag, and the floor was pretty disgusting, so I just slept on the bed with Cooper. It was spacious enough to easily accommodate the two of us, and not long after I laid down, I drifted off to sleep. 



Some hours later, I startled awake. I was lying on my back, on the side of the bed that was pushed up against the wall. It was still dark outside, and my friend was fast asleep next to me. It took my sleep-addled brain a few minutes to realize what had woken me up, but when I heard it, I felt a chill run down my spine.



*Thud, thud. Drag.*



The sound was coming from the hallway, and judging by the steady increase in volume, whatever was making it was getting closer. After a few seconds, the doorknob turned, the bedroom door swung open, and then the source of the sound moved deeper into the room. I didn't see anyone in the doorway, but my field of vision was partially obstructed by Cooper's body and the rest of the bed. This meant that whoever or whatever had just entered the room was either, (a) the height of a small child, or (b) crawling or walking on all fours. Its strange, plodding gait sure didn't sound like a child. It didn't sound like anything I'd ever heard before, human or animal. To my horror, the thing continued to draw closer and closer, until at last, it moved right under the bed. I could hear it shuffling around beneath me. Not knowing what else to do, I shook Cooper awake.



"What … What the hell, man? What's wrong?"



"Under the bed," I hissed. "Something's under the bed!" 



My friend looked at me for a minute, and then he gave me a small nod of recognition. He sat up, swung his feet off the side of the bed, and hopped onto the floor. Then, he crouched down, disappearing from my view over the edge of the mattress. I crawled onto his side until I could see him again. For a second, I thought I was gazing down at his decapitated body on the floor, but then I realized he was just sticking his head beneath the bed. I heard a whisper, and then he pulled his head out. 



"It's only Lady." He said. This was his first mention of her in months. I shook my head. It couldn't be. Lady wasn't real, but whatever was under the bed was. I could hear it too clearly for it to be a product of my imagination. I had even felt the bedframe shake as it crawled under. Though it was hard to see in the darkness, I saw my friend giving me a sympathetic look. 



"Don't be scared; she's not gonna hurt you. She knows you're my friend." 



Seeing how little that statement did to comfort me, Cooper made a suggestion: he said I ought to kneel down next to the bed and shake Lady's hand, so she could see that she could trust me. I remember thinking how strange his wording was—that *I* had to prove myself to Lady and not vice versa. The idea of sticking a limb anywhere near the thing terrified me, but I was even more terrified at the thought of it not liking me. *What would it do*, I wondered, *if it decided that I was a threat?*



"It's ok," he whispered, and I didn't know if it was me or Lady that he was speaking to. "It's all gonna be ok." 



Slowly, I got off the bed and kneeled down on the cold floor. I leaned forward, squinting into the darkness beneath the bed. All I could make out was a shape, pressed up against the far wall. Whatever it was, it was big. 



I swallowed and reached out my hand. 



"H-Hello?" I whispered.



The thing shifted closer. There was a sound, almost like a sigh. 



And then teeth clamped down on my hand. 



I saw white. The pain was sharp and immediate as the teeth plunged into the soft web of flesh between my thumb and forefinger and compressed the nerve there like a vice. Screaming, I tried to jerk back, but the thing held fast, biting even hard somehow, yanking me forward. I felt Cooper's arms wrap around my torso and pull me backwards with all his strength. For a few seconds, I was caught in an awful game of tug-of-war. I could feel the soft flesh of my hand ripping as the thing twisted and pulled. After a few seconds, Cooper won, and I wrenched my hand out of the thing's jaws with a tearing sound I will never forget.



I hit the floor hard. Hot blood poured down my wrist and I couldn't move the fingers of my right hand. Cooper's face hovered over mine, wide-eyed and horrified, his lips trembling like he wanted to say something but couldn't. He looked as if the world had just come apart in front of him.



Seconds later, Cooper's parents tore into the room. The light snapped on and his father's enraged shouts filled the room. Cooper's mother grabbed me under the arm and pulled me to my feet, muttering something sharp and low under her breath. I saw Cooper standing frozen, tears streaking down his face, and then his mother hauled me out of the room. Downstairs, she ran my hand under the kitchen faucet, then wrapped it up in a towel. Loud, violent sounds echoed overhead as she worked—banging, muffled shouting, doors slamming. After wrapping my hand, she snatched her car keys off the counter. 



The ride to the hospital took twenty minutes. Cooper's mom white-knuckled the steering wheel the whole time, her face unreadable in the glow of the passing streetlights. She didn't say a word to me, but I doubt I could've responded even if she had, lost to the pain as I was. When we reached the hospital, she didn't park, just pulled up a little ways from the entrance. 



Before I could open the door, she turned to me. This was the closest I'd ever been to her. I could see, for the first time, the color of the roots growing in from her scalp: red.



"Listen to me, Ethan," she said, voice soft but firm. "You got bit by a possum. It was stuck on something outside. You tried to help, but it bit you and refused to let go. That's all that happened." 



I blinked at her. "But—"



"That's all. That. Happened. Don't you go telling everyone what you *think* you saw. Don't go telling stories about imaginary friends. You'll only scare people, and that'll cause trouble for Cooper. You don't want that right? You're his best friend, you know."



I nodded, even if I didn't understand, and she gave me a tight smile. She exited the car and helped me out of the passenger's side, but she didn't follow me to the hospital entrance. By the time I got up to the doors, her car was already pulling away, headlights vanishing into the dark.



I was in the hospital for a few days. The bite had gone straight into the web of my right hand, deep enough to sever part of the radial nerve. It was a nasty, messy wound. I told my parents and doctors I'd found a possum stuck under a fence and got bit hard while trying to free it. For good measure, I even said it had hung onto me while I flailed my arm around, trying to shake it free. The radial nerve damage left my thumb and index finger weak and tingly for months, and even now, years later, I still favor my left hand for most tasks requiring fine motor control. 



Cooper never visited me in the hospital, but I understood why. Him coming would only compromise my story and get both of us into trouble. And so, once I was discharged, I waited patiently for the chance to slip away to his home.



When I finally got my chance, I was greeted by an empty house. I would never see or hear from Cooper again, and the last memories I have of him are that expression of shock and sadness, and the way he seemed so small next to his father. For years, I mourned him like he had died. Even now, when people ask me if I have any siblings, I still have to stop myself from telling them that I used to have a brother. 



The family had moved away while I was in the hospital, so abruptly and so thoroughly it was like they had all simply vanished into thin air. The house sat empty until it was eventually condemned. It was torn down when I was in middle school and as far as I'm aware, there is only an empty lot today where it once stood. 



At times, I thought I imagined them all. I had told so many lies that fact and fiction began to blur together. Maybe, for all my censure of imaginary friends, I had created one so vivid that it haunts me even now. Maybe the scars on my hand really are from a possum. But then again, that wouldn't align with what my nurse told me back then, when she slipped into my room when my parents were gone to ask me what had really happened. She never managed to wrench the truth out of me, but she did let slip why she was asking. Apparently, the teeth marks in my skin were less consistent with the jaw of a possum, and more so with one of an adult human. 



I'm sorry, Lady, and I'm sorry, Cooper. I hope that wherever you are now, you're alright, and that you forgive me for not believing you about your imaginary friend.
