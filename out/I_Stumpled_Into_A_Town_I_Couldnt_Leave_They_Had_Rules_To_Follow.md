I stumbled into a town where no matter how far I drove, I kept ending up right back where I started. The people there were terrified and begged me to follow their strange rules—stay quiet, hide, and never, *never* make a sound. I thought they were paranoid… until night fell and I learned why.

I had no idea when the world started to feel off. It was subtle at first—an odd flicker at the corner of my eye, a faint sense of déjà vu that washed over me every time I glanced back at the town in my rearview mirror. But then, things took a turn.

It started with the road. The road I had been driving on for hours, straight and clear, suddenly didn’t seem to go anywhere. I thought about stopping, checking my map, but the eerie feeling gnawed at me. Something inside urged me to keep going. Maybe it was the need to prove I wasn’t lost. But as I looked ahead, the town I’d just driven through was once again in my sights. The town, with its narrow streets and looming buildings, hadn’t moved. I hadn’t either.

“Damn it,” I muttered to myself.

The engine hummed steadily beneath me, but my mind raced. I had just passed through this stretch of road a few minutes ago. There was no way I could be back here. Maybe I was just tired, I thought, too many hours on the road without a break. But that didn’t explain the feeling of disconnection—how the town didn’t seem to change, no matter which way I turned.

The steering wheel felt unfamiliar in my grip as I turned down another street, hoping to break the loop. The same houses, the same overgrown yards, the same gray clouds hanging low in the sky.

I slammed my fist against the wheel. "Come on, where the hell am I?"

I glanced at the clock. How could I have been driving for so long, and yet everything felt like I hadn’t gone anywhere? I wanted to pull over, get out, and scream into the wind—but something inside me told me not to. Instead, I kept driving, straight ahead, hoping that the next turn would be different. Hoping that maybe this time, I wouldn’t end up in the same damn place.

But I did.

The moment I pulled into the town’s square again, the sense of something wrong grew stronger. This time, the air seemed heavier. The buildings loomed even taller, as if the entire town were closing in on me. My tires screeched as I came to an abrupt stop. The square was empty, save for a few figures lingering near the far edges, their faces hidden in the shadows. They watched me silently, standing motionless like statues.

I shivered. There was no sound. No birds. No cars. Not even the wind seemed to stir.

I sat frozen in my seat, staring at the people who had not moved. Something in their eyes told me they knew exactly what I was feeling: fear.

"Hey!" I called out, half-expecting them to respond, to give me some sort of direction, some explanation for the madness I was experiencing. But none of them spoke. They didn’t even flinch.

One of them—a man, older than the rest, with a face covered in a tangle of gray whiskers—began to walk toward my car. His eyes were hollow, dark pits beneath thick brows. The sight of him sent a wave of unease through my chest.

“Are you lost?” he asked, his voice low and crackling, like something scraped over gravel.

“Uh, I… I don’t know. I keep ending up here,” I said, the words slipping from my mouth in a rush. My eyes darted around, but no one else moved, and the silence around me felt even more oppressive.

“You shouldn’t be here,” the old man whispered, leaning in closer. His breath was warm on my face, and I recoiled instinctively.

I nodded, gripping the steering wheel tighter. "I was just passing through—"

“No,” he cut me off, his voice now sharp, almost panicked. “You need to leave. Get out of the car. Now.”

Confused and growing increasingly paranoid, I hesitated before finally unlocking the door and stepping out onto the cracked pavement. I looked around, but the square was still eerily quiet, everyone staring but saying nothing.

“Follow me,” the man urged, his eyes flicking nervously toward the shadows. “I’ll get you somewhere safe.”

“Safe?” I repeated, my mind reeling. “What do you mean by safe?”

The man didn’t answer. Instead, he tugged at my sleeve, pulling me in the direction of an alleyway between two tall, crumbling buildings. I didn’t want to follow, but the fear that tightened around my chest made me do it anyway.

We passed through the narrow passageway, the walls on either side covered in moss, their surfaces slick and damp. The air smelled stale, a mix of mold and something foul that I couldn’t quite place. The man kept walking without a word, his pace quickening as if he were running from something. I couldn’t help but feel that we were being watched, and the weight of those unseen eyes pressed on me like a vice.

Finally, the man led me down a set of worn stone steps that descended into darkness. He gestured for me to follow him, and I did, feeling my way along the cold stone wall with trembling hands.

The space we entered was small, dimly lit by a flickering lantern. It smelled musty and damp, but the air was cool and gave my overheated skin some relief. There were several other people in the room, all of them sitting in a tense, hushed silence. Their eyes were wide, their faces pale. Some of them looked as if they hadn’t slept in days.

“Why am I down here?” I asked, my voice tight. My pulse thudded in my ears.

The old man motioned for me to sit down against the far wall. “You need to hide,” he whispered, his voice barely audible. “The hunters will be out soon.”

“Hunters?” I repeated, my voice rising despite myself.

“They come at night,” he said, lowering his voice even further. “And if they hear you, they’ll come for you.”

I stared at him, the words not making sense. “What do you mean, if they hear me? Who are these hunters?”

He didn’t answer right away. Instead, he glanced around the room, checking that everyone was paying attention, that no one was speaking. The room was silent except for the sound of breathing. The tension was palpable.

“The hunters are blind,” the man said finally. “They can’t see us, but they can hear. And once the sun sets, they come out, searching for anything that makes a sound. We don’t know how they find us, but we do know that they hunt by sound.”

I was speechless, trying to make sense of what he was saying. Blind hunters? How could that even be real?

“They’ll come for you, just like they did to the others,” the man continued. “You need to stay quiet. Don’t make a sound, or they’ll hear you.”

My heart thudded harder against my ribs. I could hear my breath in the stillness of the room, and it felt like it was growing louder with each passing second. I looked around at the others, all of them sitting with their backs pressed against the wall, faces taut with fear.

“What are they?” I whispered. “What kind of creatures are these hunters?”

“They are…” The man’s voice trailed off. He seemed to hesitate, then shook his head. “There’s no word for them. But trust me, you don’t want to be caught by them.”

The lantern flickered, casting long shadows on the stone walls of the cellar. My skin prickled as I sat on the cold ground, the damp air clinging to my clothes. The others in the room didn’t speak, their faces etched with a deep, resigned fear. I could feel their eyes on me—wide, unblinking—but they said nothing.

I couldn’t stop thinking about the man’s words. *The hunters will come soon. They hunt by sound.* The idea seemed impossible. Hunters that didn’t need to see… how was that even possible? But there was something in the old man’s eyes—a kind of terror—that made me feel like every word was true.

I glanced around the room. A woman in the corner clutched her knees to her chest, rocking back and forth in a rhythmic motion, muttering to herself. A young boy sat near the doorway, his wide eyes darting nervously from one person to the next, his hand clutched tightly over his mouth, as if he were afraid even his breathing might give us away.

The room felt too small, too suffocating. My throat tightened as I tried to breathe, but the air felt thick, laden with the weight of fear.

The old man sat across from me, his eyes never leaving me. He didn’t speak again, just looked at me with that same terrified expression. I could feel the silence wrapping around us like a shroud, and every tiny noise—every creak of the floor, every intake of breath—seemed amplified in the stillness.

“Why do they only come at night?” I whispered, my voice shaking. “What happens to them during the day?”

The old man didn’t respond right away, and for a moment, I thought he hadn’t heard me. Then, in a voice so quiet I could barely catch the words, he spoke again.

“They… they live in the caves. The dark caves beneath the earth. They can’t come out until the sun sets. They’re blind—born that way, I think. But they can hear everything. Every step. Every breath.”

I shivered at the thought. Blind. And yet, they hunted by sound. It didn’t make sense. I had seen no sign of these creatures when I first arrived, but now I felt their presence hanging in the air, pressing down on me, even though I had never seen them with my own eyes.

“What do we do when they come?” I asked, my voice barely more than a breath.

“Stay quiet,” he said, his eyes flicking nervously to the door. “No noise. No movement. Just wait. When they come, they don’t care about you. They care about the sound. If you’re quiet, they’ll pass by. But if you make a sound…”

He didn’t finish the sentence. He didn’t need to. The implication hung in the air like a curse. I couldn’t even imagine what these creatures would do if they heard us.

I wanted to ask more questions—wanted to understand everything that was happening, why I had ended up here, why no one was willing to explain fully. But the tension in the room was too thick. The others looked as if they, too, were waiting. Waiting for the night to come, for the monsters to wake.

Time stretched out, each second feeling like an eternity. I could feel my pulse quicken, my breath coming in shallow, ragged gasps. The stillness was maddening, the weight of silence pressing against me like a physical force. I shifted slightly, trying to adjust my position, but the slightest noise made me freeze.

A heavy, muffled sound came from above us. It echoed in the dark, reverberating through the stone walls. A distant thud. It could have been anything, but in that moment, it felt like the heartbeat of the entire town. The others in the cellar stiffened, their bodies rigid, eyes wide with panic.

The old man slowly raised a hand, signaling for us to be still. His eyes were wide now, filled with a kind of primal fear that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. He glanced at the door, then at the windows, checking for any signs of movement. But it was the door that had his full attention, as though he were waiting for something—or someone—to come through it.

“Don’t make a sound,” he hissed, his voice barely audible. “Do you understand?”

I nodded, but it didn’t help. My mind raced, spinning with questions and half-formed thoughts, none of them making sense. How long would we have to hide like this? How could I survive a night like this, knowing that something—something terrible—was lurking just outside the door?

I glanced at the others again. The woman in the corner had stopped rocking. Her eyes were fixed on the doorway now, her body stiff as a board, her fingers twitching nervously. The boy, too, was staring at the door, his eyes wide with terror.

The air felt heavier now, charged with an unbearable tension. It was like the room itself was holding its breath.

Then, the door creaked.

The sound was so faint, I almost didn’t hear it. But it was there. A quiet, unsettling noise that made my heart jump in my chest.

The old man’s eyes flicked to the door. He didn’t move, didn’t make a sound. We were all frozen, like prey, waiting for the next noise, the next sign that the hunters were close.

Another creak. Closer this time. And then—footsteps. Faint, but unmistakable.

My pulse thudded in my ears. My throat felt dry, and I had to swallow repeatedly to force the air into my lungs. The footsteps were growing louder, closer. Whoever—or whatever—was outside was getting nearer. I could hear the slight scrape of claws against the ground, dragging like nails over stone. And then, the worst sound of all: a low, guttural growl.

I tried to swallow the rising panic that clawed at my chest, but it was impossible. My hands were shaking, my heart racing out of control. I could feel the walls closing in, the darkness around me pressing down harder with every passing second.

The door creaked again. Slowly. A pause. And then—nothing. Absolute silence.

The monster was just outside, listening. Waiting for any sound. Any movement.

My breath was too loud. I could hear it, feel it in my chest, as if it was the only sound in the world. The others in the room were just as still, just as silent. The woman in the corner had her hands pressed to her mouth, trying to stifle even the smallest of noises. The boy’s face was pale, his eyes wide with terror.

And then I heard it. A low scraping sound—closer now, as if the creature was circling the room. My heart pounded in my chest, and I could almost feel the heat of its presence, the sharpness of its claws dragging along the floor just beyond the door. It wasn’t even a sound anymore—it was an oppressive, suffocating presence. A heavy weight that settled in the room, choking the air from my lungs.

The seconds felt like hours. I didn’t dare move, didn’t dare breathe too loudly. I had no idea how long we’d be stuck like this—waiting, hidden, terrified.

And then, a crash.

A loud bang from somewhere outside the room, followed by a terrifying screech. The creature—whatever it was—was closer now, its breath ragged, its claws scraping against the walls, its growl building into a full-throated roar.

The crash outside sent a tremor through my entire body. It was like a gunshot, loud and unexpected. The walls seemed to vibrate with the force of it, and for a moment, the room fell into complete silence once again. Every breath I took felt too loud, each heartbeat hammering in my chest, echoing like a drum in the quiet space.

I glanced around, my eyes wide with fear. The old man’s face was drawn tight with tension, his knuckles white as he gripped the edge of the stone step. His eyes were locked on the door, and I could see the terror in his face. It was as though he was willing the door to stay shut, to keep whatever was outside from breaking through.

The others in the room didn’t move, didn’t make a sound. The woman in the corner had stopped rocking. The boy was trembling, his fingers still pressed tightly to his mouth. Even the air felt frozen, like everything in the room was holding its breath, waiting for the next moment to arrive.

The scraping sound came again. It was closer now, unmistakably. It was as if the creature had circled the room, seeking out the smallest sound, the faintest tremor of life. The sound of claws scraping across the stone floor was agonizing in its intensity, sharp and jagged. It seemed to come from all directions at once, reverberating off the walls, making it impossible to tell exactly where the creature was.

I could feel it—closer, much closer now.

The door shuddered. A violent slam echoed through the room, and I flinched, instinctively pulling my legs tighter to my chest. The others didn’t react. They had learned long ago that every movement, every breath, had to be carefully controlled. They knew what would happen if they made a noise. They knew what the hunters could do.

I closed my eyes tightly, willing the sound to stop. The scrape of claws, the low growl from outside—it was all getting too much. The room was spinning, the air too thick, suffocating me. I felt the weight of the silence pressing down on me, more oppressive than any physical force. I wanted to scream, to run, but I couldn’t. I had to stay silent. I had no choice.

I heard a soft, breathless whimper from the woman in the corner. Her hand was shaking, her eyes locked on the door, her face twisted with fear. I knew she was on the verge of breaking, and the fear that had been building in my chest was beginning to spill over. I wanted to say something to comfort her, to tell her that everything would be okay, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t even move.

Another scraping sound, louder this time, as if the creature had come right up to the door. I could almost hear it breathing—heavy, slow, deliberate. My heart pounded in my chest, so hard I thought it might burst.

And then—silence.

The absolute stillness of it was more terrifying than any sound. The creature was waiting, listening for any sign of life. It was out there, just beyond the door, and I could feel its presence like a weight pressing against the room.

I didn’t dare move, didn’t dare breathe. I stared at the door, my eyes wide, my chest tight. The sound of my heartbeat was deafening in my ears. If I made even the slightest noise, it would be over. I knew that. The hunters didn’t need to see. They could hear everything.

I glanced over at the old man. He was still watching the door, his lips pressed together in a thin line, his expression one of absolute fear. He didn’t look at me. Didn’t even acknowledge my presence. All of his attention was focused on the door. The silence stretched on, and I could feel my body starting to tremble from the strain of holding still, of holding my breath.

Then, a low growl erupted from the other side of the door. It was deep and guttural, vibrating through the stone walls. I froze. Every muscle in my body tensed in fear. The growl grew louder, and then, just as suddenly as it had begun, it stopped.

I barely dared to breathe. My eyes flicked to the others. They hadn’t moved, hadn’t reacted. They were just as still, just as quiet, as if they had become part of the darkness itself.

The scraping sound returned, but now it was different. It was more hurried, more frantic, as if the creature was becoming agitated, sensing something, perhaps hearing something. My heart hammered in my chest. I was sure it would give me away.

Suddenly, the door rattled violently.

It wasn’t the wind. It wasn’t some animal brushing against it. This was something trying to force its way in.

I gasped. I couldn’t help it. My chest tightened, and the sound slipped from my lips like a breath caught too late. I froze, my eyes wide with horror, my hands pressed to my mouth. It was too late. I had made the sound.

The door groaned under the pressure from the outside, and I could feel the creature’s presence growing stronger, more intense. It was outside, right on the other side of the door. I could hear it moving, scraping against the walls, dragging its claws.

Then, the door splintered.

A crack appeared along the wood, and the force of the creature’s strike caused the door to shudder violently. My heart was in my throat. It was going to break through. It was going to—

A voice broke the silence.

“Move!”

It wasn’t the old man. It wasn’t anyone in the room. It came from outside, from the darkness beyond the door. A loud, desperate shout that was followed by a sound like a door slamming open. The scraping stopped. The growl turned into something else—a confused, almost panicked sound.

The old man bolted to his feet, grabbing my arm with surprising strength. “We need to run. Now.”

Before I could react, he yanked me toward the far corner of the room, dragging me along with him. I stumbled, my mind racing as I tried to process what was happening. There was no time to think. No time to question.

“Follow me, and stay quiet!” he hissed urgently, pulling me through the darkened cellar.

I had no idea where we were going, but the air felt different now—more oppressive, like the whole town was closing in around us. The sound of the creatures outside grew louder, a terrible, primal growl that made my blood run cold.

We reached the far wall of the cellar, and the old man pressed his palm against it. There was a faint click, and part of the stone wall shifted inward. A hidden door.

“Go!” he barked.

I didn’t hesitate. I scrambled through the opening, my mind spinning, my heart pounding in my chest. Behind me, I could hear the sound of claws scraping against stone, the growls of the creatures closing in.

The old man followed me through the doorway, and I barely had time to take in my surroundings before he shoved me forward into a narrow passageway. The walls were close, the air thick with the smell of earth and mildew.

We didn’t stop. We couldn’t stop. The sound of the hunters was growing louder, the thudding of their footsteps vibrating through the walls. Every second felt like an eternity.

“Stay quiet,” the old man whispered, his voice strained. “We’re almost there.”

The passage wound deeper into the earth, and I stumbled, my legs weak from the tension and fear. My thoughts were scattered. All I could focus on was the pounding of my heart, the terrible sound of the hunters coming closer.

And then, ahead of us, I saw the faint glow of light.

The light ahead was faint but unmistakable, flickering like a distant star against the suffocating darkness that pressed in on us from all sides. I could feel the air growing colder, the smell of damp earth thickening with each step we took. The old man’s grip on my arm tightened as he hurried me forward, his breath quick and shallow, as if every second mattered.

Behind us, the sound of claws scraping against stone grew louder, closer, like the hunters were right on our heels, their growls growing in intensity. Every step I took felt heavier than the last, my legs trembling with exhaustion and fear. The walls of the passage were so close now, I could barely move without scraping against them, but there was no time to worry about that. The hunters were close—too close.

The old man didn’t slow down. He pulled me faster, urging me to keep moving. “Hurry,” he whispered, his voice tight with panic. “We’re almost there. Don’t stop.”

I didn’t need to be told twice. I pushed forward, heart pounding in my chest, my breath ragged in the cold air. The faint light ahead was no longer a distant glow—it was real, tangible, and with every step, I felt like I was inching toward a lifeline.

Finally, we reached the source of the light—a narrow, stone doorway that opened into a large cavern. The air here was different, fresher, though still thick with the musty scent of earth. There was a low, distant hum, like the heartbeat of the earth itself, vibrating through the ground beneath my feet. But more than that, there was silence—an oppressive, unnatural silence that made every footstep feel like an intrusion.

The old man paused at the entrance to the cavern, glancing back nervously. “In here,” he muttered, pulling me toward the mouth of the cave. “Quiet now. We mustn’t make a sound.”

I wanted to ask him what was happening, where we were going, but my voice caught in my throat. It felt like even thinking too loudly might give us away. The sound of the hunters was still too close, and I could almost feel their presence, like a weight pressing down on the air. I glanced over my shoulder. The narrow passage we’d come from was swallowed by the darkness, and all I could hear was the distant growl of the creatures.

“Quick,” the old man urged, pulling me deeper into the cavern.

We descended into the cave, the walls growing tighter as we moved further in. The air was colder here, and the walls were slick with moisture. The sound of dripping water echoed around us, but the silence was more unnerving than the distant growls. There was no sound of footsteps here—nothing but the soft hum beneath the earth and the eerie stillness.

The old man led me to a small alcove, hidden away in the shadows of the cave. He motioned for me to stay down, lowering himself onto the cold stone ground beside me. His eyes were wide with fear, constantly scanning the cave entrance.

“Stay quiet,” he whispered again. “Don’t move. Don’t make a sound.”

I nodded, my heart hammering in my chest, my mind racing. There was no sign of the hunters yet, but I could feel the tension in the air, the oppressive silence that surrounded us. The hum beneath my feet seemed to grow louder, and I had to swallow hard to keep my composure. I didn’t understand what was happening—why we were hiding in this cave, why the hunters couldn’t find us in the darkness, why the silence felt so unnatural.

The old man sat still beside me, his eyes fixed on the entrance to the cave. His fingers twitched, but he didn’t speak. The weight of the silence pressed in on us, and every breath I took felt like an intrusion. I could feel the world outside closing in on us, the hunters still out there, searching, waiting for any sign of movement, any sound.

Minutes passed, or maybe hours—I couldn’t tell. Time seemed to stretch out in the cave, the silence amplifying everything. The faint hum beneath the earth was the only thing that kept me anchored, but even that felt like it was slowly fading.

Then, I heard something.

It was faint at first—a soft rustling sound, like the movement of fabric against stone. It was coming from the entrance to the cave.

My breath caught in my throat, and I froze, my body tensing in fear. The old man’s head snapped toward the sound, his eyes wide with alarm.

“Don’t move,” he whispered, his voice barely audible.

I didn’t need to be told again. I held my breath, straining to hear. The rustling grew louder, and then the unmistakable sound of claws scraping against stone echoed through the cave. My pulse raced, each beat a drum in my ears. The sound was so close now—closer than I had ever imagined.

The creature was just outside, listening, waiting.

I could feel my heartbeat in my throat. The hunters were here, so close I could almost reach out and touch them. The silence seemed to stretch on forever, and yet every second felt like an eternity. The sound of claws grew louder, closer, as the creature approached the entrance to the cave.

I felt a cold sweat break out on my skin, my hands trembling in the stillness. Every muscle in my body screamed to move, to run, to do anything—but I couldn’t. I had to stay still. I had to remain silent.

The creature paused at the entrance. I could hear its breathing, ragged and deep, like it was savoring the moment. Then, another scrape. Another step closer.

I could feel it just outside the cave, its presence oppressive, like a shadow that loomed over us, ready to strike. The air was thick with tension, and I could barely contain the panic rising in my chest. The silence felt like it was pressing against me, suffocating me.

And then, the growl came.

It was low and guttural, vibrating through the walls of the cave, sending a jolt of terror through me. I wanted to cover my ears, to block out the sound, but I couldn’t. It felt like it was inside my mind, twisting everything I knew into something dark and terrifying.

The growl intensified, and for a moment, I thought the creature was about to enter. But then, just as suddenly as it had started, the sound stopped.

I could hear its claws scraping against the stone again, moving away, retreating into the darkness. The tension in the cave slowly began to ebb, but my heart was still racing, my body still trembling. I couldn’t understand what had just happened—why the creature had stopped, why it had left so suddenly.

The old man let out a breath, slow and steady. “It’s gone,” he whispered, his voice barely a murmur.

I couldn’t speak. I just nodded, my throat too tight to form any words. I didn’t know if it was really gone, if we were safe. The silence had returned, but it felt fragile, like a thin veil hanging over us, ready to break at any moment.

I looked at the old man, but he wasn’t looking at me. His eyes were fixed on the entrance of the cave, his face drawn tight with anxiety. The faint glow from deeper in the cavern cast eerie shadows on the walls, and I could feel the weight of the silence pressing in around us.

“What now?” I managed to whisper.

The old man hesitated for a long moment before answering, his voice low. “Now… we wait.”

The silence of the cave was suffocating, the oppressive stillness a constant reminder that danger was always near. I sat motionless in the darkness, my muscles aching from the strain of remaining absolutely still. Every breath I took felt like a betrayal, every heartbeat a drum that echoed too loudly in my ears. The old man beside me didn’t move, his eyes fixed on the entrance, his face taut with concentration. But I could feel his fear, like a heavy weight pressing against the air.

Time seemed to lose its meaning in the cave. We hadn’t spoken in what felt like hours. The only sound was the low hum of the earth beneath our feet, vibrating through the stone, a constant reminder that we were not alone. Somewhere out there, beyond the cave entrance, the hunters were waiting. They were always waiting.

I tried to steady my breathing, forcing myself to focus on the low vibration beneath me, on the faint hum of the earth. I had to block out the fear. I had to stay calm. But the silence was becoming unbearable. The longer we waited, the more it felt like the darkness itself was closing in around us.

The old man shifted beside me, his eyes narrowing as he stared at the cave entrance. I could feel the tension in his body, the muscles in his back taut as if ready to spring into action at any moment. He opened his mouth, his voice barely a whisper.

“They’re close,” he murmured.

I didn’t ask how he knew. I could feel it too. The air was heavy, the silence too deep. It was as if the world was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

I glanced over my shoulder, but there was nothing. Just darkness. The narrow tunnel leading deeper into the earth was empty. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was out there, watching us.

Then, I heard it.

A soft scraping sound, almost imperceptible at first, but unmistakable once it caught my attention. It was coming from the entrance, from the passage we had come through. My heart skipped a beat. The hunters were here. They were already inside.

I held my breath, my whole body tensing as the sound grew louder. Closer.

The old man reached out, his hand gripping my arm with painful intensity. His eyes locked onto mine, his face a mask of fear and determination. He didn’t need to say anything. I understood. We had to stay silent. We had to stay still. We couldn’t give away the others hiding in the cave.

I nodded silently, my throat dry, my heart pounding in my chest. I pressed myself back against the stone wall, as if trying to melt into the shadows. My fingers dug into the rough surface of the cave, the texture biting into my skin, but I didn’t dare make a sound.

The scraping stopped.

I could feel it, the weight of the silence again. The creature was just outside, listening. Waiting. My breath hitched, but I forced myself to stay as quiet as possible. My body trembled with the effort. I could feel my pulse racing, the blood pounding in my veins. My eyes darted to the old man, but he wasn’t looking at me anymore. He was staring ahead, his face pale, his eyes wide.

The scraping sound resumed, closer this time. It was deliberate now, the creature testing the ground, moving with purpose. I could hear its claws clicking against the stone floor, the sound sharp and jagged, like the scraping of metal against metal. It was just outside the cave.

A low growl echoed from the entrance. It was deep, guttural, the sound of a creature that knew exactly where we were, but couldn’t see us.

And then, without warning, the growl turned into a scream.

It was sudden and shrill, a scream that seemed to reverberate through the walls of the cave. My heart slammed into my chest, and I instinctively flinched. The scream was a signal—a call to the others, a warning that the hunters were closing in.

I looked at the old man, but he was already moving. His eyes were wide with panic, and his hand was reaching for mine, pulling me toward the darkness of the cave’s interior. We couldn’t stay here. We couldn’t risk being trapped.

But as I moved to follow him, something changed.

The scraping sound grew louder again, but this time, I heard something else—a low, guttural sound, like a snarl. It was right behind us. A sharp, sudden pain shot through my side.

I gasped, my body jerking in shock. The pain was immediate and overwhelming. It felt like something had slashed through my ribs, deep and brutal, like hot metal slicing into my flesh.

My legs gave out beneath me. I crumpled to the ground, clutching at my side. Blood soaked through my shirt, warm and sticky, pouring from the deep gash. The pain was sharp, but there was no time to scream. No time to react.

I bit down on my lip, forcing myself to stay silent. I could feel my blood pumping through the wound, the hot fluid spilling down my side, but I didn’t dare make a sound. The hunters were still out there. They were close. If I screamed now, if I gave away our location, it would be the end.

I clenched my teeth, my whole body trembling with the effort to remain silent. The old man was beside me in an instant, pulling me to my feet. His hands were firm on my shoulders, but his eyes were wide with fear.

“Shh,” he whispered urgently. “You can’t make a sound. They’re still out there.”

I nodded, my vision swimming as the pain in my side flared up again. I had to stay quiet. I had to survive. I couldn’t give them away.

I forced myself to take a shallow breath, wincing as the sharp pain in my side cut through me like a hot knife. My fingers clenched into fists at my sides, trying to ignore the blood that was slowly soaking through my clothes. I couldn’t focus on that now. I had to stay still. I had to survive.

The old man glanced over his shoulder, his face pale as he surveyed the cave entrance. The sound of the hunters was still there—distant, but unmistakable. They were hunting, searching for any sign of life, any sound that would give us away.

“Come on,” the old man whispered, his voice tight with urgency. “We have to move. Now.”

He helped me limp deeper into the cave, his arm supporting my weight as we moved through the narrow passage. My body screamed in protest with every step, but I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t afford to stop.

The sound of claws scraping against stone echoed through the cave again. The hunters were closing in. They were relentless.

I could feel my strength slipping away, but I fought to stay upright, to keep moving. Every step was agony, but I couldn’t afford to slow down. Not now.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, we reached another alcove. The old man shoved me inside, his eyes darting nervously around the cave. He crouched beside me, his face a mask of fear.

“Stay here,” he whispered. “Don’t move. Don’t make a sound. They’re close.”

I nodded, my vision blurry from the pain. I pressed my hand against my side, trying to stem the flow of blood, but I knew it was futile. The wound was too deep. I couldn’t ignore it. But there was nothing I could do. I had to survive. We all had to survive.

The growl of the hunters grew louder again, and I clenched my teeth, willing myself to stay silent.

They were close. And they would never stop [hunting...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02ype80IWRE)
