As I descended deeper into the murky waters of the Mississippi River, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was watching me, different than other dives I had gone in. My partner and I were on a mission to recover the bodies of the unfortunate souls who had perished in a recent wreckage. The wreckage was deep below the surface of the extremely murky river, and it was our job to bring closure to the families of the deceased.

As we swam deeper into the abyss, I started to feel uneasy. The darkness around us seemed to grow thicker, and the water felt colder. 

Suddenly, a strange sound echoed through the water. I turned to my partner, but he gestured for me to keep moving. I couldn't help but feel like we were being followed. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and my heart hammered in my chest.

As we approached the rusty wreckage, I saw something move out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but there was nothing there. I shook it off as my mind playing tricks on me. We continued to search the wreckage, but we found more than just bodies. 

There was something else down there, and it was hunting us.

We heard the sound again, but this time it was closer. We both turned to look, but this time we saw it. It was an unidentified life-form unlike anything we had ever seen. There were simply two bright, glowing eyes staring at us from fifty feet away, hiding in the shadows and murky water surrounding us. I couldn't make out anything else other than the extremely unusual eyes which couldn't have belonged to any underwater creature. 

It reminded me of old videos I had seen, of wolves and unknown animals in the forest at night, how their eyes reflected the light, the only sign they were even watching, nothing else discernible about the beasts.

I tried to keep my composure as I signaled to my partner to back away slowly. But the creature seemed to know what we were doing, and it started to move towards us, slowly at first, then with increasing speed. It was like nothing I had ever seen before; it moved with an almost supernatural grace, its long limbs reaching out in a blur towards us.

As we started to swim away, the creature followed us relentlessly, its appendages brushing against our legs. We tried to out swim it, but it was no use. It was too fast, too powerful. We were trapped, and there was nowhere to go. Despite how well I tried to stabilize my body, calm down, and get a look at the creature, I was unable to even get a clear glimpse, besides the two glowing eyes and arthropod-like appendages.

I could feel my partner's fear rising as we both realized that this was it. We were going to die here, deep beneath the Mississippi River, at the mercy of this strange, otherworldly creature. And then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, the creature vanished into the darkness, leaving us alone to contemplate our fate.

We both swam back to the surface as quickly as we could, gasping for air as we broke through the water's surface. We looked at each other, both of us pale and shaken. We knew that we had encountered something that defied explanation, something that should not exist in our world.

As we made our way back to shore, we couldn't help but wonder what else lay hidden beneath the murky depths of the Mississippi River, waiting to be discovered. And as for that unidentified life-form, we knew that we had encountered something beyond our understanding, something that would continue to haunt us for the rest of our days.

From that day on, I quit and never went diving again.
