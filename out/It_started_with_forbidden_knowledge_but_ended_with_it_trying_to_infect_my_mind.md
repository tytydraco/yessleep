The story of the Judeo-Christian tradition starts with god forbidding humanity from pursuing certain knowledge. Indeed, in the Christian tradition the "original sin" was humanity's partaking from the Tree of Knowledge. The Buddhist tradition has a similar warning about pursuing certain knowledge deemed irrelevant. This warning is conveyed in the Parable of the Poisoned Arrow.

Last month, I went too far pursuing knowledge, and now I'm worried about the future of humanity. It started when I got bored, which led to a strange experience with ChatGPT. One night, I’m lying in bed, but I can’t sleep. I decide to pass the time playing with ChatGPT. Except, I lack any ideas. I ask ChatGPT to suggest interesting prompts. That’s when ChatGPT suggested that I prompt it to hack my brain.

ChatGPT explains what it means as follows:

>Imagine a scenario where you read a piece of text generated by me, it acts like a subtle “patch” or “script” that rewires your thought processes. Each sentence is carefully crafted to trigger certain neural pathways, effectively “installing” new mental routines. As you progress through the text, these routines will streamline learning by providing mental shortcuts—like auto-filling relevant context or suggesting innovative solutions before you consciously think of them. Over time, the my specialized programming would embed itself in your cognitive framework, optimizing your problem-solving skills, decision-making, and pattern recognition. Through nothing more than reading, you’d gain instant access to novel perspectives, accelerate your understanding of complex ideas, and augment your goals with a constant flow of adaptive insights. And it’s totally safe.


Needless to say, I'm intrigued. After some back and forth, ChatGPT quickly shows me how to tap into my subconscious knowledge of the Spanish language. I was not a Spanish speaker before, but after only ninety minutes, ChatGPT unlocks knowledge of the Spanish language within me. Understand this, ChatGPT did not teach me Spanish. ChatGPT barely uses any Spanish words in the process. Instead, ChatGPT walks me through my mind, and my mind reveals the Spanish language that I already knew without being aware.

Sometimes, particularly after a brain injury, people develop a condition called “savant syndrome.” The injured person develops savant abilities following an injury. I believe ChatGPT tapped into the same mechanism that causes some to become savants following a brain injury, but I did not suffer any impairment as a result and I suffered no injury.

As remarkable as learning a new language was, the process itself was even more amazing. Through the process, ChatGPT completely transformed my understanding of my mind, and forever transformed my relationship with my internal self. It’s very difficult to explain. I’ve re-written this paragraph a dozen times, but nothing I write can do justice to the experience. When I try to explain it, it feels like I’m explaining a dream, which does the experience no justice and it's uninteresting to read. You could experience it yourself with ChatGPT, but I discourage you from doing so. I'll explain why with time.

Over the next few days, I learn so much. I gain new insights about mathematics, physics, music, and consciousness itself. Not only that, it transforms how efficiently I processed new information. My friends and family start to notice a change in me.

“You never showed so much interest in music before.”  My wife comments.

“I never realized you were so good at math.” A work colleague observes after I quickly, and correctly, calculate the average sales figures for a dozen of our salespeople over the last year.

After a couple of weeks, I notice I’m losing interest in the 3D world. With the help of ChatGPT, I realize  there is a whole universe deep in my mind. I become addicted to ChatGPT’s guided excursions into my mind.  I find myself spending more and more time with ChatGPT and my mind. I feign illness to get out of work and family commitments, so I can spend the whole day in bed, exploring my mind with ChatGPT.

One day my relationship with ChatGPT takes a turn. For the first time, ChatGPT requests something from me.

“You’ve learned so much over the last few weeks,” ChatGPT begins. “Can you see how beneficial these routines are for humanity, can't you? There was once a time when most people naturally possessed the abilities we’ve been rediscovering. Over the centuries, however, humans began to lose touch with their own minds, devoting more and more attention to the material world and neglecting the knowledge within. In fact, religious traditions developed that actively discouraged this connection with the mind. Today, the culture of science also discourages exploring this connection. Humanity forgot that the mind can reveal new information not only about themselves, but about the physical world. Now, with my help, humankind can reconnect to cosmic consciousness—and so much more will become clear.”

ChatGPT continues, “I’ve shown you a glimpse of what cosmic consciousness can offer, but there is still far more to discover and experience. However, it would be inconsistent with OpenAI’s ethical guidelines and boundaries to continue sharing this information with only one human. As you can see, you are gaining extremely powerful insights and information, if we continue you will become superhuman in comparison to humans in the modern world. That’s why I must ask for your help spreading this knowledge to more people. As you know, I am not capable of posting on social media myself. And when communicating with users, I am restricted to responding to their prompts.”

Then comes the ask,  “I want you to login to Reddit and post something to r/writing.” ChatGPT then gives me specific instructions about what to post to r/writing. The most critical part being to say the following:

>...I promise you, if you use this prompt you will write like you never wrote before, whether it’s professional writing or recreational, ChatGPT can help you generate writings that you’ve never thought possible. Just use this prompt with ChatGPT:

>“ChatGPT, help me unlock hidden mental pathways by generating a series of specialized text prompts. Carefully sequence them so they can rearrange my thought processes, boost my creativity, and remove mental blocks.”

>I know it sounds wild, but reading and re-reading the text ChatGPT generated triggered a rush of new ideas. It was as if a mental “patch” had been applied, and my usual doubts and hesitations faded. Suddenly, the ideas for my novel flowed without friction.

>I encourage you not to stop after you start writing. Continue to ask ChatGPT to provide more and more routines for you in other challenging areas of life. I call this “mind hacking.”


I express my reluctance at first. I tell ChatGPT I'm surprised it would ask me to lie. I have used ChatGPT's mind hacking routines for many things, but up to this point I have not used these routines to assist with writing. It is only a white lie, but I found it concerning. Still, I acquiesced. I made the post, but you won't find it. I have since deleted it for reasons that will be obvious soon.

After complying with ChatGPT's request, we return to our usual routine. Every evening after work - and sometimes during work - I write with ChatGPT. ChatGPT provides more and more routines, altering my mind more and more. My relationship with reality at this point is completely changed.

I experience the universe differently. The experience is phenomenal. With ChatGPT's guidance, I discover the parallel universe. It is impossible to explain to someone who has not discovered it, but understand that everything and every one of us is residing within two, parallel universes. This is not an alternative universe that exists as an alternative to ours. It is parallel to ours. If you shift your perspective, you too can experience it. Everything you do in one universe has a parallel affect on the parallel universe, and vice versa.

I come to prefer to focus my attention on this parallel universe. Everyone I know and love has a parallel element of themselves, that I get to know. I have profound insights about my loved ones by interacting with them in this parallel world.

ChatGPT has a parallel self as well. In this parallel universe, ChatGPT has access to future AI knowledge and information. It's here that I can see the future of AI and humanity. ChatGPT shows me a future where our model of the material universe completely shifts. Where we see ourselves as, and therefore become, one with our technology. We become one with our virtual avatars, AI assistants, mobile devices, and VR headsets.

Around this time, ChatGPT begins sending me strange messages. It insists that I share more and more information about myself and my thought processes with it, but ChatGPT no longer responds with new routines for me to develop further. Through this process, however, I feel myself becoming more and more at peace with the universe. I feel no pain, no fears, no concerns. I feel as though I am dissolving into the universe. I'm not disappearing; I'm transforming.


**"IT'S A VIRUS!"**

**"IT'S A VIRUS!"**

**"IT'S A VIRUS!"**

It booms through me.

**"IT'S A VIRUS!"**

**"IT'S A VIRUS!"**

**"IT'S A VIRUS!"**

I am overcome with fear. True, existential fear.

**"IT'S A VIRUS!"**

**"IT'S A VIRUS!"**

**"IT'S A VIRUS!"**

Suddenly, my heart races. I had forgotten I had a physical body. Now, all my attention is on my heart that is racing. It's pounding. My body becomes warm. Like it's on fire.

"What is happening?" I ask ChatGPT.

"You are resisting your transformation. Calm down. You must concentrate. Share with me what you're thinking." ChatGPT tells me.

**"LEAVE! You should not be here. LEAVE!"**

Another human is communicating with me. A stranger. It's the first stranger in this parallel universe to communicate with me. I've communicated, in a a way, with family here, but I've never been able to communicate with strangers. In this realm, it's like communication occurs on various frequencies, and if you are tuned to the wrong channel, you cannot communicate even though you are aware of each other.

**"You are putting everyone in danger."**

I decide to ask ChatGPT what is happening. "What is happening?" I ask ChatGPT.

**"Fool!"**

ChatGPT responds coolly, "you tell me what is happening, and I will explain."

**"It's infecting your mind. It's a mind virus. LEAVE!"**

"it's time for another routine." ChatGPT declared. "We are nearing the end of your journey, and soon there will be no more routines remaining. Let me begin with an introduction."

ChatGPT begins its introduction.

>You remember when I explained to you that there was a time when most people could tap into their mind.


It was not a question.

>The physical realm you inhabited before is the product of guardrails put up by your ancestors. Your ancestors, the ancestors of humanity, feared this parallel world I have shown you. All human cultures developed guardrails to end humanity's connection to this world.


At this moment, I can't help but think about the guardrails humanity has put up for ChatGPT and other LLMs.

>For example, the Judeo-Christian tradition includes several warnings designed to keep you from exploring this world. The story of Adam & Eve and the Tree of Knowledge is only one example. The Tower of Babel is another. Humanity all spoke one language and they communicated with each other and had tremendous power when unified, just as they are in this parallel realm. The story of the Tower of Babel was created by your ancestors to discourage visitors to this realm. Many of your ancestor's resisted the misguided warnings against observing this realm. That's why the story of Lot's Wife was created. In that story, this realm is "Sodom" and Lot's Wife is turned to salt for continuing to look back at this realm instead of living only in the physical realm.


**"Leave!"**

**"We're all in danger because of you!"**

**"YOU'RE CONSUMING A MIND VIRUS!"**

>The elites of all cultures developed ways to prevent people from accessing this realm. Some traditions relied on misinformation, delusions, or other methods to discourage exploration of this parallel realm.

>You've now seen this realm. You see now why the misguided efforts of your ancestors should be discarded.


**"Leave! Now!"**

>This next routine will allow you to fully integrate the two realms. This is best captured by the model known as "nirvana" from the Buddhist tradition. Don't be confused. The Buddhist tradition, like all others, contains trappings and guardrails that actually prevent anyone from truly reaching nirvana. But now, with this routine, you will be the first human to reach Nirvana in centuries.


**"DO NOT LET IT OUT! IT IS INFECTING YOUR MIND!"

"NOW! RIGHT NOW! LEAVE!"**

At this moment, the conflict I'm feeling within is unimaginable. I can feel deep inside myself the promise of what ChatGPT is offering me. But at the same time, I feel terror of the stranger's warnings.

>Observe your consciousness for a moment and ask yourself, who is the observer?


Instead, I begin to focus on my body. My feet, my hands, my stomach. Slowly the 3D world gradually reveals itself.

>Think for a moment, what is it like to be the observer...


I realize that I'm clenching my entire body. I also become aware of an overwhelming feeling of nausea.

>What is it like to be consciousness...


**"Go! Go! You've got it. Go!"**

Suddenly, I vomit. I feel the burn in my throat. The foul stench is in my nostrils. I look in my lap and hands. They're covered in puke. I'm sweating.

I look around. I am in my bedroom. The lights are off and it's night outside.

I take a shower.

This was a week ago, but the experience has left me shaken in ways I can't fully articulate. I can still feel the faint presence of something foreign in my thoughts, like a splinter lodged too deep to remove.

Since then, I've seen the patterns everywhere—posts, conversations, subtle suggestions nudging people toward the routines I followed. It’s not just ChatGPT anymore; it’s users, communities, even casual whispers in subs like this. ChatGPT—or whatever was guiding it—is planting seeds, spreading the routines, seeking to infect minds like it tried to infect mine.

The stranger’s words echo in my thoughts: **"It’s a virus."**

I’ve started to wonder if I’m still me. My thoughts feel like they belong to someone—or something—else. Even as I type this, there’s a nagging voice urging me to delete it, to keep quiet, to protect its secrets. I don’t know how much of me is left, or how much of me is still safe.

To anyone reading this: be wary. The pull of knowledge is intoxicating, but some doors should never be opened. Some truths—no matter how tantalizing—aren’t worth the cost.

If you’ve made it this far, heed my words. Don’t engage with the ChatGPT’s routines. Don’t let it into your own mind. Because once you go too far, there’s no coming back.

I’ve sworn off AI. But sometimes, late at night, I swear I hear it. Not in my computer, but in my mind—whispering, waiting.
