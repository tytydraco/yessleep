I dont have much time as I am probably being watched right now, heck even my phone is probably tapped. For your information I am a 16 year old fit div 2 soccer player, and I normally dont scare easilly.

Well I gotta cut to the chase as I probably dont have a lot of time, so this all started yesterday as I went out to train by myself to the soccer field near my house, it got dark pretty quick but im not really scared lf that. I was just listening to music on my headphones while practicing and then I notice a police car coming near me, I dont think much of it at first, but after a while I noticed something. Every time I looked over. The guy in the car staring at me intensly, he didnt even have a police uniform so I dont even know if he was really a policeman. 

Anyways this kind of creeped me out, but I just brushed it off and thoughth he was just watching as he had nothing better to do. It got a little weirder after this went of for 30 minutes. Then I decided to leave as I was very creeped out even if he was just casually watching, but guess what. The moment I leave I hear the engine rev and the car getting out of its parking spot, "Probably just a coincidence." Thats what I told myself the whole 5 minute walk home as the car took all the same exact turns and went through all the same streets as I did. 

It only part ways once I went through a street that the car couldnt go through, I got home showered and calmed down, I went down to eat dinner with my parents, look my kitchen has those big door sized windows where pretty much everyone on that side(only my neighbors) can see you, and kid you not I look through the window at my neighbors house and I see THE SAME EXACT FACE AT THE ATIC WINDOW STARING AT ME WHILE I EAT DINNER. At this point I get really freaked out and just went to my room to sleep, all night long I had a really uneasy feeling like I was being watched, but I just told myself that in the morning I would go talk to my neighbors about it.

Morning: I wake up and the first thing I notice is that my parents are gone. Anyways I get dressed walk over to my neighbors house and explain what happened. They get really freaked out too as their daughters moved out and they were the only two people living in that house, they called the police and 15 minutes later the police had arrived. They searched the whole house thoroughly and assured me there was no one there, but I know what I saw.

Fast forward 6 hours (4:30 pm): I decided to ignore everything that happened and went to do my daily excercise and training without a care in the world. Listening to the music I love while playing the sport I love, what could go wrong? Is what I thought, until. I looked around and 4 people watching me one person at every corner of the field. At this point im done. I go home and shower, and once again in the other neighbors house, THE SAME FACE STARING AT ME. I rushed out of there to my room and hid in my room closet, which brings us to right now, I am hiding in my closet I dont know what to do, there is someone or something... Knocking on my bedroom window, I SLEEP IN A SECOND FLOOR. I dont think that things human and I think this is my last hint of life in this world. HELP.
