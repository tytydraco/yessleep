My eyes were transfixed on the circular structure erected in the center of my basement. It hadn't been there the day before, the sudden appearance of the construct perplexed me. I leaned over the wall of the apparatus. A hole. 

Rather, a well. Cold, wet, deep, dark. It breathed an icy breath from its stone esophagus. I shivered. For weeks it sat in my home, demanding my attention, hollowing out the curious part of my mind. 

I told nobody about the strange well, I had no one to tell. I continued my life as normal, eyeing the basement door occasionally, never venturing down. At night I hear voices, whispers. Their words are incomprehensible, but the feeling they communicated was undeniable. 

I knew they emanated from the well. Beckoning me. I felt a strange force of gravity ever increasing. 

Sunday I mostly forced the thing out of my mind. 

Monday I thought of the well more, and strained to listen to the whispers. 

Tuesday I put my hand on the basement door, shying away at the last moment. 

Wednesday I got down the stairs just enough to spot it, then quickly ran back up. 

Thursday I approached it once more, placing my hands on the wet stone and peering down. 

“Hello?” I called out. The well repeated me. The darkness was thick like black jelly. When I went to bed that night the whispers increased in volume and frequency. I swear I could even make out what some were saying. “Out there… frightening.” They cooed. “Safe, come to us. Safe down here.” 

Friday I returned to the well with a light. Its pitiable beam barely bore a dent in the black abyss. 

If I wanted to see what was down there, I would have to go closer. It might've been wise to get other people involved, call my ex husband, call my children. I doubt they'd speak to me, let alone help. How selfish of me to expect such a thing. 

Do not pity me for my estrangement, for it is my own fault. I'm not writing this to be pitied. 

Do not pity me. 

Saturday I bought a lot of rope. A ludicrous amount of rope. I couldn't place it, but something gave me the feeling that I shouldn't underestimate the depth. 

I approached the vertical tunnel with all the equipment I needed, tied the rope securely, and threw it down. The sound of the incredibly long rope whacking against the walls of the well reverberated ceaselessly. 

I didn't consider that the well might not even have a bottom. I didn't care. I shimmied over the wall, fastened my harness to the rope, and began my descent.

10 meters. Step, step, step. It was rather easy to find a rhythm, I would lower myself on the rope with my feet planted to the slippery stone wall. 

Step, step, step. My rhythmic steps echoed above and below my position. 

Step, step, step. I took a second to catch my breath. The light above was still clearly illuminating my path. I hesitated to look down, for I knew I would only be met with darkness. I have a long way to go yet. 

Step, step, step. 

50 meters. Step, step, step. Now, the light of my dwelling was only visible when I gazed upward. It was very difficult to see where I was planting my feet, and I turned on the flashlight clipped to my chest. That's better. Step, step, step. 

100 meters. I huffed a frosty breath, halting my descent for a moment. My hands were sore and calloused, my feet and ankles stung from the constant pressure. 

Looking back up at the world above, now only a distant light, it's hard not to feel a sense of… peace. The large echoey chasm I found myself in was cold and isolated, but lacked scrutiny, anger and judgement. 

There was nobody to answer to, nobody to take care of. It was just a well. Step, step, step. I wonder however, if this is the right place for me to be. 

Step, step, step. 

200 meters. I noticed green moss growing in the cracks of the moist stone. I stopped again. Green reminded me of home. Far, far away now. My shoulders moaned in soft discomfort, they would have to strain a lot more if I intended on getting out of here.

I gazed again back up at my home, a speck of light. This well doesn't seem like it's ending any time soon. Maybe I shouldn't be here, I thought. My doubts and fears were suddenly combated when I heard the familiar voices, the calls in the night that visited me in my dreams. 

Whispers that once spoke in mumbles now called clearly to me. “Heidi… keep going. It's safe, down here it's safe. Out there is frightening.” They beckoned. 

250 meters. Step step step. I picked up my pace, the drums of my descent marching faster. Step step step. That voice…this well…I trust it. Step step step. It is safe down here, my own burrow below the world. 

Step step step. 

This tunnel of stone and moisture is my new birth canal, a womb birthing my new existence in the second world. A world where birth is a miracle, not a ripping and tearing malediction permeating your life. 

The world I leave behind wed me to an incompatible partner, who violated me with ungrateful blighted spawn. 

My body is ruined. Through this crevice I can be reborn. In my solitude, I am whole again. Step step step step, step, step, step…step…step…

What was I doing…? I released heavy, exhausted breaths. My strained muscles were on the verge of snapping. My saliva tasted like metal, and I felt my heartbeat in my head.

500 meters. Darkness flanked me on both sides. I had underestimated the pit’s depth. I thought if I didn't turn back now, I might have lacked the energy to climb back up.

…

Step, step, step.

I continued downward. 

Step, step, step. 

People are always scandalized when you wish to leave the world. 

Step, step, step. 

They try feebly to keep you tied to it with empty promises, wishes that won't come true. 

Step, step, step. 

When their hollow attempts to tether you to them fail, they move on to guilt. 

Step, step- THUD. 

I froze in place. My consistent rhythm of steps was thrown off by a loud noise. It echoed from below, the sound of something smacking stone. My heart raced. 

My own footsteps had put me in hypnosis, and the sudden interruption was a shock to the system. I cautiously gazed down. Silence. I hung near breathlessly in the air, shadow engulfing me in both directions. 

That's when I felt it, a tug on the rope. Not from below, but above. I yelped in surprise when the tug increased into a powerful yank, the rope I was attached to began to ascend with me on it. 

Something was pulling the rope from the top. I felt immense fear as I was slowly dragged upward, for one reason or another, I was intensely opposed to being forced back up to the surface.

490 meters. I panicked, scraping my feet against the stone. It was enough to anchor myself inside the well, preventing my capture. The strength of the pulling increased however, and my ascent continued.

450 meters. I struggled in vain to resist the pull, whatever was yanking on the rope had seemingly inhuman strength, my only option was to slide down the rope faster than they could pull. I gnashed my teeth in pain as I slid down the rope, my hands on fire. 

460 meters, I couldn't slide any longer, my scoured hands already started leaving a red coating of blood along the rope. And something else, I looked down at the abyss below, beckoning to me. 

I feared the rope would soon run out if I continued to descend without really getting any deeper.

400 meters. The pulling force of the rope was now incomprehensibly strong, I felt cold wind stinging my face as I flew upward. 

The stone walls streaked past in a grey blur. I could no longer fight, I instinctively clung to the rope like a babe clinging to its mother.

250 meters. In less than half the time it took me to get down the well, I would be forcibly returned back out.

100 meters. I squinted my eyes, I could see the light above, I could hear the sound of the rope scraping against the edge of the stone.

50 meters. My blood fermented in my veins, I could feel petrifying fear stabbing at my rapidly beating heart.

25 meters. I shut my eyes tight. “STOP IT STOP IT!!!” I desperately screeched. “I DON'T WANT TO RETURN! LET ME BE!!”

10 meters. To my surprise, the pulling gradually slowed, then came to a complete stop. The rushing sound of wind faded. The sound of the rope's friction against the stone ceased. 

Even the echoing sound of my heartbeat and breathing seemed to fade into the background. For a moment, there was complete silence. I fearfully looked up at the surface, I saw the lights of my house illuminating my basement ceiling and the base of the well. Then, it spoke.

“There is nothing for you down there.” A deep, powerful and incomprehensible voice said from the top of the well. “Don't be foolish, had I not rescued you, you would be lost.” 

The voice didn't sound human nor animal, when it talked there was no echo, no discernible origin of its speech. It was as if it somehow spoke without the physical vibrations of our world. 

“Who are you??” I questioned. I tried to look up at the surface, hoping whatever was pulling the rope to show itself, yet I saw nothing.

“I am a passing spirit, nothing more. I come not from your world nor the world you attempted to enter. I warn you again, what lies below is not meant for you. 

Return to your life, and I will correct this blemish in your dwelling.” I pondered the Spirit’s vague words. I wasn't satisfied with its answers.

“What do you mean? Why is this well here? What's at the bottom??” I demanded to know. “And why does it whisper to me so? Don't you dare tell me it's not meant for me, they beckon me!” I shouted. The spirit didn't respond for a while.

“...don't be foolish.” It said softly. Without another word, the rope slowly began to pull me up once more. 

I felt a primal instinct at the core of my soul, I had found something beyond our world, discovered an unexplainable, chaotic experience, and now it was being taken away. 

I greatly feared returning to the surface, being stripped of something that disrupted the miserable inescapable order of the earth.

“NO!!” I yelled. My instinct took over, and I let go. My hands released from the rope and began to descend. Slow at first, then fast. Wind blew past my face, my flashlight ripped off my chest and I was wrapped in shadow. 

A terrifying free fall in the dark. Down, down, down. The light above disappeared.

“Took you… long enough…” The voice, the one I heard in my dreams, said to me sweetly.

50 meters.

100 meters.

150 meters.

500 meters.

2000 meters. 

5000 meters. I fell for minutes on end, eventually relaxing my body and adjusting to the harsh and rapid descent. How long will I fall before I hit the bottom?

??? meters.

??? meters.

??? meters. I fell for what felt like hours, I lost 
track of time, I lost track of how far I fell. I fell for so long I had to convince myself it was a dream. This wasn't really happening right? A bottomless well in my house? Whispers? Spirits? Those things aren't possible. I'm asleep in bed. I continued to fall.

??? meters.

??? meters.

??? meters. I fell for what felt like days. Days of feeling the terrifying sensation of gravity yanking me downwards in complete darkness. I was starving, my skin felt numb and dry, my eyes burned so much I kept them closed. 

“FUCK!!!” I hollered, the well repeated me. I cursed myself for choosing to go down here. I'm a miserable, irrational and desperate moron. How could I be so fucking stupid?

??? Meters.

??? Meters.

??? Meters. Days turned to weeks, my hunger and thirst eventually subsided. I had barely any physical sensation anymore, only the feeling of falling. 

Only the feeling of guilt. Falling. Weeks turned to months. I couldn't speak, my voice long gave out, yet still I tried to speak with my soul. “Spirit!! I regret it!! Please save me from this!!” I begged. 

The Spirit's presence was long gone. “Whispers! Voices! Why did you beckon me?? Let me out of this hell!!” The voices didn't respond. Though they spoke through my dreams, calling me to this fate, now they said nothing.

??? Meters.

??? Meters. 

??? Meters. It had to have been years. Years of descending into an infinite void with no signs of it ever ending. I no longer desired to leave, to return to the world above, I only wished for the misery to end. 

Why was I still alive? The brief moments I spaced out and let my consciousness completely fade away was my only respite. It never lasted, I would soon return to my new reality, stuck in a free fall, and all that existed in my mind was misery. 

I didn't write this for you to pity me, it's my fault that this happened. I destroyed my own life, maddened by the chaos and complications that came with it.
I felt that nothing ever went my way, I couldn't control the world in my image and I wished to escape it. This well was perfect order, absolute order. Nothing complicated or chaotic ruled here, nothing to frustrate or confuse me. I got my wish. I sobbed.

??? Meters

??? Meters

??? Meters… I don't know how long it was. Centuries? Millennia? Eternity? My mind had oozed into the walls of stone and rushing air, I had spent more time down here than I have in my life above. 

My consciousness didn't fade, it only diluted. I had been stretched into an infinitely thin strain of existence, now fully accepting that this well was my new home, my new universe, the reason for my creation. 

All time and all space turned to darkness, after my mind had been scattered, indistinguishable from the air. 

Then, I reached the bottom.

“We meet at last.” The beckoning voices sang, now louder and clearer than ever. 

“You've finally submitted yourself to the perfect order, and you will be my vessel of your world. Together, we can collapse all that exists. We can create a cold through absence of temperature, a darkness through absence of light, a dark and eternal evil through absence of goodness. Then, and only then will everyone finally be safe.” The voices chanted.

“There will be no more discerning one thing from another, through our will all will be unified, all will be objective and unchanging forever. We are the endless end, we are the darkness in the gaps between the stars, we are perfect. Go now, continue your human existence and await our command.” 

I understood. Next thing I knew, I was back in my basement. The house once familiar to me was now a distant passing dream left a thousand lifetimes behind. 

I had finally returned to the surface, yet thoughts and feelings of longing for my human existence were not even a particle in my eternal mind. I don't write this for you to pity me. I write this as an invitation. 

The well will open up in your house, one day or the next. Jump in. Eventually the world and all existence will be uniform, we will carry out the task of perpetuating an all encompassing oblivion. 

It will arrive whether you choose to accept it or not, you can kick and scream and cry, but it will come. 

I deliver this message to you so you know the truth, all you fear and avoid, all you love and hold dear, all will be scattered into atoms and exist naught in a corner of the vast eternal nothingness we will inhabit. 

So get it out of the way, join us and do what I did.

Jump in the well.
