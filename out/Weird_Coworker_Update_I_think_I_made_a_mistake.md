Good news: we did not commit arson. 

Omar wasn't at work for the rest of the week after we [broke in](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/8FoM2agyue). Ramy had been keeping an eye on him, looking for an opportunity to catch him off guard. Apparently, Omar was keeping his talisman on him at all times, seemingly becoming more and more paranoid by the minute. 

(If you haven't seen my previous updates, click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/NWJnO2Gtx1) to see my life fall apart in real time.)

Where the situation took a turn was when I came home to find Ramy in my kitchen, a bundle of paper towels clasped to his cheek as blood oozed from three long gashes across his chest. 

"Oh, hey!" He greeted me cheerfully. "Do you have tape?"

"*What happened?*" 

"I think Omar is sick of my shit." Ramy said with a particularly devious smirk. 

"You- uh, hold on, *tape?*"

"My cheek is falling off. It'll reattach in a few minutes, but in the meantime, the flapping sensation is driving me up the wall, so if you wouldn't mind getting something to stick it in place, that'd be fantastic. Superglue would probably be alright, too. Or staples, I'm not picky."

That last suggestion made my stomach turn. Without another word, I went on a frantic search, trying to remember where I'd last seen my roll of tape. The most recent time that I'd used it was to pack up before moving in. I ended up finding it on the bathroom floor, of all places. Ciri must've been batting at it. 

I couldn't look as Ramy taped the skin over his cheekbone back into place. Once he was done, he looked down at his shredded torso, muttering that he was glad that he'd worn a shirt he didn't care about. 

Naturally, I had questions. Many questions. 

"So fun fact about ghuls," He began, leaning casually against the counter as if he didn't look like he'd just crawled out of a blender.  "You stab them once, they die, but if you stick 'em any more than that, they come back to life stronger than before. Unfortunately for us, Omar seems to have used that to his advantage."

I couldn't think of a better way to phrase my next sentence, but I wanted to make sure that I understood correctly, "So, Omar forced the hoofed jinn to evolve?" 

At first, Ramy furrowed his brow, but then a smirk started to pull at the corner of his mouth, "Is this about that Pokémon thing again?

I sheepishly admitted, "Yeah. Sorry. It's my best reference."

He chuckled softly with a shake of his head. I don't know how, but somehow, I think I've tricked him into thinking that my idiocy is charming. 

"Anyways," He continued. "Yes, the ghul is stronger, now. It's not going to be as easy to get rid of it."

"You mean to kill it?" That made a chill settle in my chest. "Isn't there some way to free it?"

"Sure. Kill Omar, steal his talisman, release it from servitude ourselves."

Was that all? Easier said than done, especially since the hoofed jinn apparently got an upgrade. I know that thing tried to eat me and seemed to hold a grudge about me having the audacity to defend myself, but when I saw it in Omar's house, it had been sapped of any cognizance. It was reduced to a marionette of flesh and bone. Nothing deserves that. 

Truthfully, I also couldn't stop thinking about if the same thing were to happen to Ramy. The idea of everything that makes him *him* being siphoned out simply to make him nothing more than a weapon...

Was that what Omar's goal was? To use both jinn as weapons? Or was he planning to just stop with the hoofed one? 

My troubling thoughts must've shown on my face because Ramy added, "We'll make it happen, alright? We'll only put it out of its misery as a last resort. Sound good?"

I agreed. Without warning, he then ripped the tape off of his cheek. To my relief, it stayed in place, with only a jagged pink line left to indicate where the injury had been. Soon enough, even that would disappear. 

He ran a hand through his hair thoughtfully, frowning when he found a lock that was clumped together with blood, "It's on its way for round two, so I'll try my best to incapacitate it. In the meantime, Omar will be unprotected."

*Round two?* The now too-familiar sensation of dread settled in my gut. I asked how he knew that the hoofed jinn was coming. He'd gotten the ghul to bite him and was using the same sixth sense that we had for each other to keep track of its whereabouts. 

"I'm guessing while you're dealing with the hoofed jinn, you want me to..." I trailed off, not wanting to finish that thought.  

Noticing my hesitation, Ramy said, "You don't have to kill Omar. All I'm asking you to do is get in, cover up the wall, get out, then you can leave the dirty work to me. Alright?"

I took a deep breath before stammering, "You know... I'd appreciate it if you could tell me in advance when you've got an evil scheme. You might be a walking Nokia, but I need some time to prepare myself before getting into this kind of shit."

He snorted, "First, I'm a Pokémon, now I'm a cellphone. You give me the most romantic pet names, you know that?"

"*Ramy-*"

"Okay, it was a last minute thing. The ghul came at me, I saw an opportunity, and I took it. It's called thinking on your feet."

I sighed, "You're so..."

A playful glimmer appeared in his eye as he came forward to pull me into him. "I'm so *what?*" 

"You're a shithead, is what you are." I replied, setting my hands on his shoulders. 

"You're on a roll with these nicknames." He whispered before leaning in to trace his lips along my throat. 

Unable to think of anything even remotely intelligent to say, I lifted my chin up for him. Connie picked that moment to hop over, staring up at us, her little head tilting up and down as if we were confusing her. I stared back at her. She bleated. I don't know if it was from nerves or her impeccable timing, but I burst out laughing. 

Ramy smiled down at her, "Do you mind?"

She bleated again. I think that was a 'no.'

The moment was spoiled when Ciri began to growl. Her back was arched, eyes slitted towards the door, her fur on end, ears back. Connie had begun to back away from the front door as well, low to the ground. A tall, skeletal silhouette was visible in the doorway, its head tilted as if listening for us.  

Hold on, was the hoofed jinn *taller* than I remembered? 

Ramy sighed. "Time for me to go greet our guest."

He exited through the side door. The silhouette's head snapped in his direction, then with a screech that made my teeth clench, it disappeared. 

With a shaky hand, I peeked through the blinds, seeing only brief glimpses of  Ramy's eyes from the direction of the lake in the early morning darkness. If the hoofed jinn was *that* quick after Omar 'evolved' it, I'd have to wait until they got a good distance away before it'd be safe enough for me to make a break for the PT Cruiser.  

Taking a shuddering breath in, I held my keys tighter in my grasp. I hadn't seen anything for a while. Did that mean it was safe? 

Steeling myself as best as I could, I threw the door open and dashed for the car, not giving myself the chance to look around like a scared rabbit. I don't know if it was paranoia or premonition, but I had this odd feeling that if I hesitated even for a second, that would be *it* for me. 

I got to the car, locked it, and started it in a matter of seconds, but that wasn't fast enough. When I pressed on the accelerator. The PT Cruiser's wheels spun as if the car was caught on something. *No no no no!*

The plastic wrap covering my broken back window ripped. Instinct told me to duck and not even a second later, a bony hand brushed against my hair from behind, barely missing me. In retrospect, I think what happened was that the hoofed jinn was holding my car in place with one hand, using the other to try to pull me out. It had gotten *that* strong. 

The hoofed jinn shrieked and the car rocked violently as its hand was suddenly withdrawn. I threw the car in reverse and stepped on the accelerator again; this time, the car slammed into something. 

Immediately following the collision, Ramy's annoyed voice came through the back window, "*Really, Lab Rat?*"

Oh my god. I *hit him with my car!* Mortified, I shouted an apology as I hurriedly put the car back into drive. 

Something moved from the corner of my vision. The hoofed jinn's mutilated face was right next to my passenger side window. It was missing an eye, its teeth showing from lips that had been clawed into nothing but jagged scar tissue. That particular injury looked too old for Ramy to have been the one to do that. 

I don't know what sound I made then, but it was somewhere between a yelp and a scream as I put the pedal to the metal, my tires screeching as I peeled off. The car shuddered as its tired, old engine tried to keep up. My 'check engine' light blinked. The hoofed jinn, on all fours, bound after me, gaining quickly. 

*Come on! Come on!* The car trembled again as something bumped it, then it veered in a way that felt as if something heavy was stuck to it, dragging it off to the side. In the faint red glow of my taillights, I saw that the hoofed jinn had grabbed onto my bumper. I slammed on my breaks, causing the hoofed jinn to run into the back of the car with a smash, making me lurch against my seatbelt from the impact. Luckily, my airbags didn't go off. 

I checked the mirror in preparation to back up again (wanting to make sure I hit the correct jinn this time) but Ramy already had the lanky creature by the throat, dragging it away from me. That was my cue to leave. 

This time, when I burned rubber, nothing grabbed onto my car. It took me getting halfway down the road before my heart rate fell back into a reasonable rhythm. To my relief, the 'check engine' light had stopped blinking, though it hadn't disappeared. I *really* should get a new car sometime. 

Now that I wasn't in immediate peril, I had to think. There was a 24 hour Wal-Mart where I could get some paint; anywhere else would be closed by this time of night. I had to be quick, though. I had faith in Ramy to incapacitate the hoofed jinn, but I didn't want to risk it getting away from him. It was definitely faster and stronger than it had been before. 

Once I parked, I saw that my poor PT Cruiser has taken yet another beating. The back of it had a huge dent, lined with a few drops of blood. I felt ashamed once again when I realized it could be Ramy's. 

He thinks it's hilarious and had no hard feelings after the fact, but I still can't believe I did that. 

When it came to getting supplies, I'm embarrassed to say that Splatoon logic took over. In the end, I bought a paintball gun. I also got the ridiculous idea to grab balloons and fill them with black paint. The thought process I'd had was that it'd be better if I were able to hit the wall from a distance, especially if Omar put up a fight. 

After a rushed, messy session of filling up balloons in the parking lot, it was time to unleash my inner woomy. (I may be cringe, but I am free.) And yes... I was covered in paint, by that point. 

I know this was a stupid idea, but stupid has worked for me quite well in the past. 

Feeling somewhat clownish with my paintball gun and paint balloons, I crept through Omar's backyard. His gate was locked. This time, I didn't have Ramy here to let me in. I had to climb. Somehow, I managed not to hurt myself as I scaled the fence and surprisingly, none of the balloons popped. 

Another thing that surprised me was that the back door was unlocked this time. Weird. This wasn't a trap, was it? 

Raising my paintball gun like it was a real weapon, I slowly entered the house. Inside, the kitchen was dark. The whole place was silent. Unease set in. This felt *very* much like a set up. 

When I turned the corner into the living room, I found Omar sitting on the stairs, head in his hands. As soon as he spotted me, he jumped up, eyes wide as he shielded the scripture with his body. 

"Wait!" He shouted. "I didn't mean for things to get like this! Please, just hear me out!"

This wasn't right. Regardless of what he'd done, holding him at gunpoint (even if it was just a paintball gun) while he quivered in terror made me feel sick. 

Omar sounded desperate as he kept going, "I'm in over my head, alright? I admit that! I should've just stayed out of it! Now, I don't know how to get out!" 

Guilt clenched at my chest and tightened my throat. It had been easier with Matthew and Aanya's ex-husband. With them, I had the assurance that I'd done what I needed to do to defend myself. If Omar had done as they did and chosen violence, it would've made everything so much simpler. 

But he kept pleading, pausing only to swallow nervously, "The incident in the animal facility showed me that I'm not nearly as prepared as I thought that I was. I thought I could use the jinn to fight back against the old ones around here, the ones that think they own us. But now, I just... I just don't want to die."

His voice broke at the end, as if he was near tears. 

I stammered, "This-this isn't a real gun."

He swallowed again, "It may as well be. You cover up that wall, I'm dead and you know it."

I knew it was entirely possible that this could all be an act. That I was being manipulated. If it was, then *God,* was it convincing. 

Taking a deep breath, I reminded myself why I was there. The hoofed jinn was forcibly transformed, and its will was stripped away. Ramy had been exorcised, putting both him and I in a terrible position. 

With all of that in mind, I retorted, "You didn't give the hoofed jinn much of a choice. And how can I believe anything you say when you sent that thing after Ramy?"

"He was following me," He replied with a fearful quake in his voice. "I didn't have a choice!" 

Shaking my head while keeping my eyes on him, I said, "I'm going to need you to prove it. Prove that you're not... I need to know that you're not lying to me." 

"Whatever you need, Lab Rat. Just please..."

"Release the hoofed jinn from its service."

Omar nodded quickly. "I can do that. And if I do... you won't paint the wall? You won't let the ifrit kill me?"

"I can't guarantee anything. I don't have any control over Ramy. Once he makes up his mind..." 

"So no matter what, I'm dead, is what you're telling me." He said shakily. 

I thought quickly. Swallowing to try to get some moisture in my dry mouth, I said, "You could try to leave town. I could... I could at least get you a head start. That's the most I can do, Omar."

Nervermind the fact that Ramy came all the way to Ohio from Iraq to hunt down two marines. Omar had to already know that was a possibility. That Ramy might not give up if he tried to run. 

Omar nodded again, "It's better than waiting to die."

He withdrew the round talisman that he'd used to trap the hoofed jinn from his pocket. His hand trembled as he murmured in Arabic, glancing warily between it and me. 

I hated this. I hated feeling like I was holding him hostage. I hated making a man beg for his life. I hated having this much power over whether or not someone lived or died. 

"It's done." Omar uttered. "Now, can I-can I go?"

I questioned, "How do I know that you didn't just recite a tuna casserole recipe in Arabic instead of the incantation?" 

Omar held the medallion towards me, "Take the talisman. You're its new owner. If I'm lying - which, I'm *not*- you'll be able to free it yourself." 

I wasn't sure if I was making the right decision. Even now, I'm not sure. I just knew right then that if I'd painted the wall as he pleaded for his life, it would've haunted me. Maybe I'm a coward for that. I don't know. 

When I reluctantly told him to go, he cried, thanking me. I couldn't look at him, the guilt of the situation eating me alive. 

Once I heard his car make a hasty exit out of the driveway, I set the talisman he gave me on the patio table, wanting to get it out of the house. After giving him five minutes to get some distance, I unloaded my paint arsenal on the scripture. 

Not even a moment after the deed was done, Ramy's voice was behind me, "What happened? How did you get him to release the ghul?"

So Omar hadn't been bluffing. He'd really done it. 

When I faced Ramy, I saw he was once again, covered in blood and not all of it was his. At least all of his body parts were attached this time. 

I started to explain, "So... don't hate me-"

He let out a short laugh. "That's a promising start to this conversation."

"I let Omar go."

His eyebrows raised with a mild, "Huh."

Anxiously, I continued, "I didn't know what to do. He was here, he was scared, he asked for help... I-I couldn't do it."

Ramy's expression was thoughtful, hands on hips, eyes lowered. He calmly told me to slow down and take a deep breath. 

I didn't follow that advice, fully committed to my nervous ramblings, "I told him that if  he let the hoofed jinn go, I'd let him get a head start. I didn't promise anything other than that, so... I don't know what you want to do with that, but-"

"Now that he's not right in front of you, do you think he was sincere?" Ramy suddenly asked me. 

I ignored the pounding in my head that would inevitably turn into a stress headache later, trying to think back. Truthfully, I wasn't sure. I'm still not. The only thing that I was convinced of was that Omar's fear was real. I was honest with him and told him that. 

As unruffled as ever, Ramy assured me that he wasn't angry. 

"Lab Rat, I think you've been had." He said gently. "Can't say I blame you. You're not accustomed to things like this."

"People begging for their lives, you mean?" I muttered. 

His casual response made my eyes go wide. "Exactly." 

I care about him and all, but sometimes, I forget how frightening he can be. 

Eyes still lowered in contemplation, he eventually said, "I'm guessing he didn't give any indication where he was headed?"

I confirmed that he didn't. 

Once again, he still didn't appear to be angry, just slightly frustrated. "Alright. I guess Omar's getting away with it, for now."

Something occurred to me then, which I spoke aloud: "Omar's going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for you. He has to leave everything behind. He *isn't* getting away with it. It's just a different type of penance than you had in mind."

Ramy appeared to consider what I said. After a moment, he gave me a small smile, "If I didn't know better, I'd think that you felt bad for him."

"I don't. Just thinking, is all." I uttered. 

He informed me that the hoofed jinn was still in my yard. Apparently, once it was released, it had simply stopped moving, collapsed to its knees, and examined the self-inflicted scars on its arms as if for the first time. He left ahead of me, wanting to make sure it wouldn't do anything reckless. 

When I arrived, I found that Ramy had managed to get it to sit on my porch steps. Faintly, Ciri's growls and hisses from inside were audible. The hoofed jinn had its ridiculously long arms looped around its knees, crumpled into itself with its head down. It didn't look up when I approached. 

The poor creature looked like it had been crushed. I imagine that it must be similar to the way I'd felt after Matthew possessed me. The unmatchable violation of having control of your own body ripped away. 

I spent too long trying to figure out what to say. Asking it how it was doing would've been stupid. Asking if I could help it in some way would sounded contrived. In the end, I decided it would probably be best to say nothing. 

Without raising its head, the hoofed jinn finally spoke, "I made a mistake."

Ramy's voice was gentle as he asked it, "What do you mean?"

"Participating in the human world. If I hadn't coveted..." Its childlike voice suddenly quieted. 

I don't know if this helped, but I hope it did. I assured it, "I don't know exactly what you're going through, but I know what it's like to have your autonomy stolen. It's horrible. You feel responsible for whatever your body did, even if you weren't the one doing it."

Ramy's hand comfortingly stroked my back as I spoke. 

I continued, "Just... know that you didn't deserve this. And if you feel anything like how I did, I also want to let you know that you'll feel like you again. In time, your body will feel like yours again."

It's hard to describe what happened afterwards. Previously, the hoofed jinn had sometimes appeared to be made of wet cement as its appearance changed rapidly. This time, its body was reduced to a pulpy, porous texture as its flesh contorted. It gradually became smaller until it was similar to the size of a raccoon. The first things to emerge from the cement were hooves, followed by a cat's fuzzy grey head, and a long tail. 

Once its metamorphosis was complete, the hoofed jinn ran off towards the treeline. I glanced at Ramy. He made no move to follow it. He simply patted my shoulder, announced he needed a shot, then led me inside. 

That was all a few days ago. We haven't seen any sign of the hoofed jinn since. I hope that whereever it is, it's okay. Omar hasn't [returned](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/AejCBgz8Se). There was a moving company at his house. I suppose he wouldn't want to take the chance of collecting his belongings himself.
