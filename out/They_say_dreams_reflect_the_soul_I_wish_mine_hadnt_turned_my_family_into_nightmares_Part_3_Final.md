I am so sick of this feeling in my gut, constantly reminding me of why it feels that way. This weakness like I do not have all of my blood, like I teeter on needing to puke and not needing to puke. I can’t even watch my life go by in the television in front of me where concentration keep wavering.

I keep seeing things. Things I’m not sure if they’re really there or a trick of the sleep deprivation I have placed upon myself. As soon as I find that sweet spot in comfort where weakness temporarily leaves me, I notice something at the corner of my eye. A form of something I do not recognize.

It became clear that I was seeing my wife, as the warmth I felt in the smell in the air when something hugged me from behind.

When it happened, I was on the phone with my mother who had been trying to convince me to leave my house. It was her voice on the other end, asking me if I was still there that had brought me out of my stupor. The engulfing relaxation I felt as those invisible arms wrapped around me.

I don’t cry much, even when she passed, my way of dealing with it was to shut myself away.

But when I turned around and realized I could not kiss my wife. I hung up the phone and broke down in the middle of my kitchen.

And for the first time in a while, I fell asleep. Something I desperately needed, except for the dream that came with it.

Usually, when I lucid dream about the family I had lost. There was a little prep work that had to be done beforehand. But this time, as I opened my eyes in the hospital chair, I knew it was not real. I knew the familiar bed before me, the lump under the covers, was Olivia. Her beautiful face staring out the window as the falling sun brightened her face like the angel she was.

When I raised my head, her eyes full of love turned to me. Her weak smile as her greeting, like nothing had been wrong. Like her curly black hair had still been on her head, and we were in the park playing in the grass.

“You need to stop overexerting yourself Mrs Williams, what if you fell in the hall? No one would’ve seen you all night, and then what?” The doctor had been near the door, a stern look on his face while he lectured her.

“I AM in no condition to leave my bed you know,” she said back to him as if she was the doctor.

When the doctor had left a few minutes after this, Olivia had pulled something from her bedsheet and was showing it to me, “I watched it float down from the window, I thought she might like it if I couldn’t bring one in.”

“I’d hope you wouldn’t bring in a whole bird for her.” I laughed a little.

I took the white feather from her fingertips and held it in my own. Olivia was staring at me again, “Bring it to her, won’t you?”

I nodded, getting to my feet, “Her rooms gonna fill up completely at some point.”

Olivia smiled at this and continued watching life move out the window. The corridor I moved into had a sterile smell to it compared to her room. The frequent and random art hanging on the wall every few feet now just another part of the copy and pasted scenery. The door I stopped at had a small 28 in its middle, pictures of flowers and birds drawn in crayons taped around it.

Every time I entered Billie’s room my heart had sunk. The girl looking up at me from her bed brightened weakly as I entered. The older woman sitting in a corner of the room hung her head as she slept. Christy, Billie’s hospital sitter was quietly snoring to herself as I crept past her and knelt beside the bed. Billie looked about to squeal aloud in joy at my face until I put a finger to my lips.

Silently, I pulled the feather up and into her view. Billie, who had previously begun to visit my wife during the day, had told her how much she wanted to play with the birds outside her window. She gasped when she saw it, eager to hold it herself, I handed it to her.

Her small hands ran down its side with only a delicacy someone holding a fine treasure would use. She looked at me quickly as she plummeted her hand under her blanket and retrieved a single piece of paper.

When she handed it to me enthusiastically, I looked it over. It was drawn in various colors of crayon, its tip was a curly, dark purple witches hat roof, the walls at odd angles with triangle windows. Three stick figures stood beside it.

“Can you build this for me?” She said shyly.

I looked up at her, unsure what to say. Her eyes looked more tired each time we’d seen her, her visits less often from her volunteer growing ever more hesitant to let her move. “Of course,” I whispered, holding out my palm, “five bucks.”

Billie giggled and made the old volunteer snort a little. I quietly sucked air through my teeth at this, making Billie smile again. When I went to stand, I felt a tiny grip on my shirt. She was holding onto me, looking with those green eyes of hers. “When will Olivia come visit?”

My heart sank at this, her pleading eyes desperate to see her best friend. I knelt back down, placing my hand on her head, “Soon buddy, she hasn’t been feeling too good lately.”

“Is her head still hurting?”

My eyes fell for a moment, “Hey, you sure you want a purple roof here?”

When I came back to my wife’s room, she was smiling up at me again, “She’s such a sweetie isn’t she?” she said.

I nodded. My mind elsewhere.

When I moved closer to her, she lightly touched my hand, “Asher?” I looked at her, the thoughts emptying from my mind, “I was wondering, when we get out of here, I was thinking about letting her live with us.”

I smiled at her, warmth growing in my chest, “I think she’s got the same idea,” I said, handing her the drawing.

When I reached out to her, I noticed the bed was empty. The sheets pulled off to the side.

I stood up, looking around the now dark room. The only light inside was that from the moon watching me from the window. “Olivia?” My voice was hoarse, panic quick to my lips.

I flung the door open to the corridor on the other side. The few lights in the ceiling doing a poor job in making the place look less haunted. I called out loudly for help, uncaring which resident woke from my cry. No one was coming, no one was doing their jobs.

Again.

What the doctor had told him, the warning he had given him. I had to find her, to bring her back. I jogged down the hallway, watching the closed doors pass my eyes as the pang in my heart grew ever harder and the weakness throughout my body reached my head.

My shoes jolted still as something caught my eye, a thin light was stamped vertically on the wall near a turn in the hallway. I ran over to it, slowing as I took its turn. Sprawled in front of a door was a woman, still, unconscious.

I bent down, the inevitable that had been creeping in these past weeks finally gripping tightly, finally ripping at the skin.

I called out for someone that wasn’t there, for a force that kept us in that hospital. Her body drooped as I lifted her head, the only breaths coming from my own broken lungs. The hand that had fell was clenched in a loose fist. A perfect white flower in its middle, a lily. One of the same flowers outside Billie’s window. I looked up, room 28 had loomed over us.

Through the crack, I could see the little girl, sleeping soundly in her bed like the screams from where I knelt was only a whisper.

I only felt anger. I know I shouldn’t have.

“Help us Asher,” came a voice and even before looking down I knew who’s it had been. “It hurts.” those veins were splitting from the pores on her face.

I opened my eyes slowly, the feeling of dried tears sore on my cheeks. I never wanted to close my eyes to that day again, the worst of it. So painful was the memory I felt like death had come back for me as well.

A single picture flashed before my eyes as clear as anything else for months. A white piece of paper, scratches of crayon forming into a colorful house, three stick figures standing beside it.

Billy’s face looked so happy then, she expected so much from me, from her. She was waiting, I turned to the picture beside my bed, reached out.

Olivia’s smile that I alone got to see greeted me. Even then, I wished for that picture to move, to talk. Just so I could hear her voice one last time.

She’d tell me everything would be ok; she really loved me.

Again, I closed my eyes, taking control of the nightmare that awaited me.

It wasn’t long before I was standing in my bedroom, watching a bird dance across the trees. The room I was in was contorted into a box of rust and torn wallpaper that revealed the black wall behind it. At my feet was a thin carpet of feathers and flowers. If it wasn’t for the dirt caking over everything, I would’ve thought it was snow.

The same went for outside, as feathers floated gracefully in droves from the grey sky I could not see. Around the moldy room I had occupied only days ago now accompanied semi melted furniture. The ground crunched as I walked towards the door, the dry feathers and petals breaking from my weight.

When I got to the open door, what sat on the other side was not what I expected. The room before me was the same decrepit site as before, yet what should be my hallway was now a large room, nothing but darkness and dead air inside.

My resolve felt as if it could snap at any moment like the footsteps crinkling in my ears. Throughout the room were dark corridors, splitting off into different directions. None of them the same size or shape as the one next to them. All of them, as silent as the rest. The echo from each of my heavy breaths crawled back into my mouth where they belonged.

This place, it felt like the part of hell that the devil forgot, smelled like what only I could imagine burning flesh to be like. The emptiness in each corner wide enough to deceive its very statement and as I moved closer to any of them, the weight pressing over me grew until my legs could hardly carry me.

Yet, all I could do is press on into one of those entrances, into the maze. To be so lost for so long, finding my way felt so impossible. Until something had changed, something had moved.

As I stood in the middle of the room, trying to decide which hall to take, a beep scratched its way through the air. I turned towards it, the old beep of her hospital monitor methodically sounding inside one dark entrance, growing louder and louder. The beeping was quickly accompanied by steady crunches of footsteps as a single green glow hummed on and off with each beep. It soon ignited the figure’s silhouette, getting larger each time it flashed until the thing sprouted from the veil of shadow and into my room.

If its skin had been any tighter to the bone I would’ve thought it was a walking skeleton. The legs, red and beaten, limped towards me. Its pale flesh was so tight to its ribcage that each step looked as if they would each crack and cave into itself. White hands had been covering its face, covering the green light that lit through the bony fingertips. The face was long like the hands that hid it, the few strands of hair dangling by clotted blood from the top of its head.

The beeping grew sharper in my ears as I stood there, frozen to the rust on the ground. The way it didn’t scream, didn’t cry, didn’t breathe kept me there.

Beep

Beep

Beep

I closed my eyes, the sound pulling at my reluctant mind. She’s such a sweetie, isn’t she?

The crunching footsteps stopped, the image of curly hair, a reflection of the sun in Olivia’s glasses vivid behind my eyes. The fist clenching the air around my body eased.

Asher? Can you tell them to turn off that monitor? Its driving me crazy.

I opened my eyes to the monster’s bony spine limping away from me, slowly on its way to a single corridor. I watched it reach an entrance and stop there, the beeping the only thing that remained.

Hesitantly, I moved towards it, the weight from before pressing down on me the closer I got.

When I finally reached it, it continued forward, disappearing down the unknown of the entrance beyond. The large room was alone except for myself and the rust peeling off the walls. Continuously, the green light in its head slowly showed the faintest silhouette growing more indistinguishable by the second.

A moment passed before I finally drove myself after him, letting the darkness swallow me whole.

Beep

All I could see was the momentary flash of pale skin as we walked through the corridors of this maze. Turning so many lefts and rights, or so i thought, he would be in front of me one second, then off to the right the next. I had walked so long, I didn’t even notice how the thing began to struggle, the passing light blinking less often as we went.

Beep

Each step turned into a dragging, ripping sound. Whenever I saw him, it looked as if he wasn’t moving at all. And soon, the black hallway gradually let in some light from somewhere unseen.

The same rust and mold littered the floor and walls, the ceiling looking as if it could come crashing down on the two of us at any second. The first thing my eyes had caught was the way the thing I followed now moved. Its legs dragged across the floor, treating the carpeting of dirty flower petals and feathers as tracks of footsteps in the snow.

My eyebrows furrowed at the sight of its feet. The way they dragged was due to them being ripped from the ground. Each step pulling away hundreds of connected strands of those hairlike veins. They snapped with every tug, lying loosely on the ground as I cautiously stepped over them. Reary that they would come alive and squirm towards me.

Beep

Ahead of me, the thing had succumbed to its efforts and fallen to the ground. There was no instinct to help it up as it had immediately started crawling with the same strained force as when it walked. The veins that had apparently eaten away at its feet were now sticking and breaking at its hands, knees, stomach and soon, parts of its face. Whatever part of it that contacted the ground stuck like velcro.

As it pulled its way around one last corner, the air had changed. The rust on the walls peeling off and falling, the moldy feathers slowly rising, floating in the air like dust in a long-forgotten room.

I turned around, my heart choking in my throat. From behind me came the last huff of breath as it expelled down the hall. I stood there for some time, my mind wiped from any thought I had.

Then, what sounded like a bag of wet fungus being slammed violently on the floor came rushing through the corridor. My muscles tightened at the suddenness of it; I turned and ran around the corner to the leader of this maze as the thudding of whatever lurked behind me rose in volume.

When I went around the corner, my eyes widened. On the other side was a room larger than any other, a mountain of gesticulating veins that reached up towards the ceiling. The pale leader had crawled to the foot of it, reaching up its path as it was leached onto by the mountain.

Beep

Behind me came the hurried sound of incoming danger.

Up the mountain was a light, swirling like a vortex with something dark in its middle. I didn't have to strain my eyes to know who it was, but it made her name whisper from my lips.

“Olivia.”

Down at my feet, the pale monster lied there, moving no more, beeping no more.

Thump

I slowly turned around, the sound no longer an echo.

All my eyes could do was widen in such a shock I have never known.

My panicked body drove me up the squirming mountain, towards the sleeping image of my wife. Away from that monster, its huge jaw slack across the floor it moved on.

I felt a weak tug at my ankle, stopping my ascension. The pale figure had reached out and grabbed me, its face halfway showing its long, noseless face, where its eyes should have been was a single deep, jagged slash that showed the meat beneath.

Beep

I stared at it, momentarily glowing green under the thin skin. From over its head the thing that followed me groaned and thudded in my direction.

I'm not sure why I did it, why the invading veins suddenly puncturing my skin down to the muscles didn't bother me. I didn't understand why I picked him up, tearing him from the mountain I began to climb.

Harder and harder was the journey. The skin from my shins ripping from my bones first, the feeling of minuscule hammers beating into my bone marrow only to rip away at what attacked me to be introduced to newer enemies. A numbing feeling quickly followed as I found myself wishing it were a positive sign. My stomach grew exponentially lighter as my front hit the invaders and tore me open.

Beep

I lifted the body in my hands above my still devouring body as I pushed myself to the top of the mountain. My wife only feet away from me now.

“Asher? Don’t leave me here Asher.” the wailing voice did not come down from Olivia, but up from the monstrous blob from below. I looked down at it, dead flowers sprouting from the broken and dragging mouth as it stood meters away from me.

Billie’s face flashed behind my eyes as I stared at it, wondering how her parents could abandon such a little angel.

“I won’t.”

I dove up to my wife, wrapping her in such a tight hug. Her limp frame hanging in my arms as the pain spilled from my soul. All the memories we shared, the love we made, the tears we shed were all ones I’ll cherish for the rest of my life. And if I could, I’d die a million times with you. It would only mean I got to spend that much time with you.

Olivia, I know I’ve been gone. Hiding behind a false world I knew could never be. You don’t need to suffer anymore. I’ll love you throughout all my lives until I finally reach wherever you are.

The pale figure lied beside me, veins wiggling up and through its body. Its skinny arm was reached out, clinging dead to a wire leading into the side of the living mountain.

I placed my hand over his, taking one last look at the monster below as it looked up at me, tears falling from its melted face.

I pulled on the wire.


This brings me to now, as I write this all out for whoever can take from my experience. To hopefully learn from the mistakes of a man god took half from. To not run but continue, fill the missing part of yourself. Don't live for one person, live for as many as you can.

And before I finish the roof of our new home, the curvy point at the top being the most difficult part almost done, I need to find a good place with a lot of sun. I'm planting a lily garden, and I need the best view. Olivia’s picture would look nicest there, I think. She’ll be able to look down from wherever she was to watch the newest member of our family come home from her first day of school.

I hear little Billie calling for me now, I think you would’ve liked her new hair pin I made for her. A tiny little feather.

Your feather.

It's funny, when I looked up just now Billie was already standing in the perfect spot. Sun shining down on her like you were placing a hand on her shoulder. She was cranking the little music box in her hands until the melody tinkled from it.

I wonder where she found that.
