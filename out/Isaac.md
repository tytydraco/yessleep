Hello. I am Alex. I work at the ***error***. I don't think I have much time left. So I'll go against my NDA and share this information.
Two days ago my team had been ordered to reinforce a SWAT team in, what at first seemed like a usual 911 call. When we arrived to the scene we saw SWAT agents alongside police officers surrounding a house. I have been working at my department for 19 years. I knew this wasn't just your usual emergency.
I knew better than to ask questions tho.


My orders were to ensure everyone's safety and to examine. And so I did. I circled the empty house once, then twice. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. That wasn't normal for my job. When I circled it the third time, I noticed a door that wasn't there before. Then a window that wasn't there before. Then a whole room on the same side the forth time. I noted it all and told my supervisors that the house was changing. They already knew that. That's why no one went inside. ... Well... Some did... But no one got out.


"So what's this mess even about?" My colleague Mark asked a SWAT member.
The guy shrugged "apparently a 911 call... Some guy lived here for years... Adapted to the changing house... He reported that some people broke in tho."
"Yikes" Mark said trough gritted teeth.
"Armed? Is the guy alive?"
*The SWAT guy shrugged.*
"No signs of forced entry. No signs of any entry actually... The guy that lives is named Isaac I think. No signs of him either. No record of him at all."
I intervened, moving Mark from the officer before he learned too much for his own safety.


But then a voice was heard from the house
"Enter. Help."
The cops recognised it as Isaac's voice.
And we were sent in first.
Don't get me wrong, we have dealt with changing houses before. But something was off here.
As we walked trough the hallways, rooms seemed to change behind us. Not before long we couldn't see the front door anymore. I started getting worried.


"So... You're here",I head Isaac , or his voice at least, from the room we were in. No. It boomed from every room at once.
Before Mark was able to rise his gun I heard a thud. I saw the colleague who was standing in front of Mark just drop to the floor lifeless.
"Gun down." Isaac's voice said
I took Marks gun and dropped it onto the floor, sliding it away from us
"Smart" the voice said.


Then I heard a creak. I would fail to describe the agonising noise that was heard. But it sounded like stairs squeaking under pressure. Only problem? This was a one story house.
A guy, middle-aged, breathing heavily, appeared in the room in front of us.


"I invited you because I was bored. I already killed everyone you sent in." Isaac said, his face still obscured by the darkness.
"What stops me from killing you too?"
I froze.
I didn't even reach for my gun. I found it pointless. "There was four of us tho. We could overpower him." I thought. And with two thuds everyone except me and Mark was on the floor.


"Please. Just... Let us leave."
Mark pleaded.
Isaac turned, smiling. I saw his face now. He was bearded, his face was awfully uncanny. My gaze reached the place where his eyes should've been. I saw only gaps. Endless hollow gaps where his eye scokets should've been. 
He raised a finger up, only one.
"Only one." He said.
I looked at Mark. He looked at me. And, I admit. I shamelessly ran towards the exit. There was something about that man... Isaac... That scared the hell out of me.


But where I should've found the exit. I found a wall. I sat against it. Tired out. I felt like I had been running endlessly.
Two days had passed. I'm still in this house. But I'm not dead. Which leads me to believe Mark isn't either. I'll be the one who leaves.
