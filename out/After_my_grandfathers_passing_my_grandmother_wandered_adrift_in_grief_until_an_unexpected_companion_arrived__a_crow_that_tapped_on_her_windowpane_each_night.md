I had always loved my grandfather, even though he was a stubborn old man who refused to get vaccinated or use his oxygen tank. He had been through a lot in his life, losing his farm and most of his family in a fire twenty years ago, and my mother something later.  
He was never the same after that, but he tried to make the best of it. He was kind to my grandmother, who took care of him day and night, and he tolerated me, his only granddaughter, who was paralyzed from the waist down and liked to bring girls home. He even started to grow some crops on the small piece of land he still owned, and I helped him by installing some sensors and cameras to monitor them.  
Things were going well, until one day he got very sick. He was coughing up blood and having trouble breathing. We rushed him to the hospital, but they said there was nothing they could do. He had contracted a rare virus that was resistant to all treatments. They sent him home with some painkillers and told us to make him comfortable. He didn't have much time left.  
He spent his last days in his bedroom, with my grandmother by his side. Sometimes he would knock on the wall to get her attention, or to ask for something. It was a weird habit he had developed, but we didn't mind it. We knew he was suffering, and we wanted to make him happy, and we did that for him as he passed on.  
I felt trapped living with my grandparents for so long. Ever since the accident, I had to use a wheelchair to get around, and we never had enough money to work on the home’s refitting. The stairs, the narrow hallways, the high shelves - everything seemed to mock me and remind me of what I had lost. I missed being able to walk, to run. I missed feeling normal.  
But I wasn't the only one who was suffering. My grandmother was depressed and withdrawn, barely eating or talking. I tried to have dinner with her every night, but she would just push the food around her plate and stare into space. I wanted to help her, to take her to therapy or to a support group, but I didn't have the time or the energy.  
My job at the bank was demanding and stressful. I had to meet high targets and deal with difficult customers every day. My boss was constantly breathing down my neck, threatening to fire me if I didn't improve my performance. I worked long hours, often coming home late and exhausted and I barely had a life, beyond getting drinks somethings, or hiring someone.   
I didn't know how to cope with all the pressure and pain. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of problems, but things started to look up one night.  
Things at dinner began to change with my grandmother – she gained her appetite back, and ate more then I had seen her eat in decades, but she still looked sickly. I always tried to talk of my grandfather whenever I could, but she always brushed it off and always changed the focus of our conversation to my work.  
The pressure at work had been too much, and I was unable to tell her I got axed earlier in the month, and so I just convinced her I had been working from home. I spent most of my time building out the drone system, I had promised my grandfather some years back. He had always been fascinated by technology, and he wanted to see the world from a different perspective.   
Since I spent much more time on the garage till late in the night, I noticed something strange that happened every night at 10 p.m., I began to hear a tapping sound on my grandmother’s window. Whenever I headed to sleep too, the crow would come by window, and tap on the pane too, strangely in the same pattern my grandfather had used to do, against the wall.    
A week passed by as ignored the sound, as I neared the completion of the drone system, But as I headed to my room one night, I would hear her giggle in her bedroom, and another faint voice too. It sounded like a man, it sounded like my grandfather. He had the deep, raspy voice he lost nearly a decade ago, that made me shiver. I wanted to think it was the TV, but the sound was too clear and too close. I would push my wheelchair against her door, but as soon as I did, I would hear something else: a tapping on my own window.  
I headed to my window, and found the familiar large black crow perched on the sill. It stared at me with its beady eyes, and then tapped its beak once on the glass. I ignored it, and closed my curtains as it flew back to my grandmother’s pane, tapping the window gently, as I heard my grandmother's window open up.   
As my drone project finished up and I had more free time to myself, and got more restless laying in my bed, curiosity got the better of me that night. As I decided to sneak out of my room and peek into hers. I oiled my wheelchair, careful not to make any noise. I reached her door, which was slightly ajar, and pushed it open a bit more, and found her naked, as the crow had laid perched on her back. She quickly turned to me, and rushed nakedly to shut the door.  
The next morning, she acted as if nothing had happened. She smiled at me and hugged me and made me breakfast, and didn't mention anything about the night before, or the crow, or the man. Instead focusing on why she hadn’t seen me working on anything, while at home. I came clean, and she began to mention how much my grandfather and her loved me so much.   
I wanted to ask her about it, but I didn't know how. I was afraid of what she might say, or what she might do.  
I noticed something strange about her eating habits. She would devour everything on her plate, and then ask for more. She would snack on cookies and candies all day, and never seem to be full. She would even sneak into the kitchen at night, and raid the fridge.   
Yet, despite her voracious appetite, she kept getting thinner and weaker. Her skin was pale and wrinkled, her eyes were sunken and dull, and her hair was falling out. She looked like a skeleton with a thin layer of flesh. I knew I had to take her to the hospital.  
I kept pressuring her to head over to the hospital. She finally agreed, and as we headed out, I found another notice tucked neatly into the door; they would foreclose on our property if we didn't pay up soon. I had hidden the notice from my grandmother, hoping that I could find a way to solve our problem without worrying her.   
The truth was, I had no idea what to do. I had been trying for months, but I couldn’t find anything.  
I loved our home. It was the only place where I felt safe and happy. It was where my grandmother had taught me how to read and write, how to cook and clean, how to garden and sew. It was more than just a house, and I couldn't let it go.  
The doctors had felt that her decline, was naturally for her age, and insisted I stick to supplements and prepare myself. I tried to mention everything else going on, but they just ignored me, but I just couldn’t accept my grandmother's late-night conversations were innocent, and I found myself eavesdropping outside her door.   
I was tired of it, and driven by a mix of disbelief and curiosity, I decided to confront the source of the eerie communication myself, it still tapped on my window before it headed to my grandmother’s window. So I was planted on my wheelchair that night, as I waited for the crow to approach, as it did. It tapped on the pane like my grandfather did, so I decided to tap back.   
“Open up for me sweetheart, its your grandfather.”  
I stumbled out of wheel chair, pushing myself away from the window, as it repeated the same thing over, and over again, begging I open the window for it. It was surreal, almost too good to be true. A mix of emotions flooded through me—fear, confusion, and a lingering sense of disbelief.  
I gained the strength to talk back to it, but it couldn't comprehend the details I was sharing, and the confusion deepened when it struggled to remember my name, it just wanted me to let it in. That’s all it kept on repeating.  
I wanted to believe it, because my grandfather had struggled with a cognitive decline before he passed, but I just couldn’t believe he became a crow and suffered from the same problems.  
I kept silent as it begged on, I didn’t know what to do, so it left to my grandmother’s window. The strangeness didn't end there, with my drone system completed and having set up some sensors around the yard, some days earlier. I decided to review the farm sensor footage captured near my window, it only captured certain parts of the light spectrum. What appeared near my window wasn’t a crow, rather a distortion of all the sensors near my window and my grandmothers. It was just static.  
As I looked over the image, I heard the crow tap incessantly on my window, but more frightening was my grandmother began slamming her head on my door, telling me I was upsetting my grandfather. I got to her in time before she could damage her head, but it meant another costly visit to the unfriendly doctor, whose recommendation was for her to be put away. I had enough of the crow, so I bought some poison bait I laid on our windows, and on roof to make sure I wouldn’t have so many problems to deal with.  
As we sat down for a meal some days later, her condition was unpleasant to look at, her flesh almost seemed to be melting of her skin; she wore more skimpy outfits for ‘him’, as I could see her skin wrapped against a rib cage like a lose elastic. She mentioned her conversations with my grandfather more openly, as she ate an entire pork shoulder herself, but as I asked about if she really knew it was my grandfather, she pulled away from the table, before nearly fainting vomiting out a disturbing mixture—the pink-dyed poison I left for the grow, animal faeces, and twigs.   
In the middle of her vomiting, she calmly informed me that my grandfather had baked her a pie, and scrapped some of her vomit, to offer me.  
I tried to find a rational explanation for what was happening. I called a plumber, an electrician, a pest control expert. I searched online for possible causes of paranormal activity. I even contacted a psychic, who told me that our house was haunted by a malevolent spirit that wanted to harm us. He said he could cleanse the house for a hefty fee, money I just didn’t have.   
I realized that there was no solution, no way to fix this. The only way to end this nightmare was to leave. I decided to let the bank take the house. I didn't care about the money, or the credit score, or the legal consequences. I just wanted to save my grandmother, and myself, from this hell.   
My grandmother, refused to leave, she at one point told me she would squat, but I made sure the bank understood the would have to use ‘force’ to make us leave, so as I packed our bags and loaded them into the car, the deputy held my mother in his van for assault and public indecency. I took one last look at the house, feeling a mix of sadness and relief. I hoped that whoever moved in next would have a better luck than us.  
Soon after parting ways with the haunted house, life took an unexpected turn. I found a temp job and, to distance ourselves from the unsettling past, we moved into a rundown part of town. The change of scenery was a welcome relief, but as we settled into our new surroundings, grandmother had changed.   
Dinner with my grandmother seemed strangely ordinary as first, especially considering she had managed to regain the weight she had lost and dress more modestly. However, ever since the crow disappeared, she was more reserved.   
I didn’t think too much of it, until One morning, I awoke covered in smoke and surrounded by the fire. I stumbled out of bed, found my wheelchair and managed to get out of the house, it was then I found her with the crow perched on her shoulder as if it was some twisted accomplice.   
"Grandma, what have you done?" I cried. "Why did you do this?"   
She turned to face me, her eyes gleaming with madness. "Your grandfather said so, my dear," she said  
The small-town police wasted no time responding to the emergency. Given the tight-knit community and the awareness of our past struggles, our story became a focal point, especially with the ongoing mayoral campaign. It turned out that helping a wheelchair lesbian, and her grandmother was considered the honourable act. The bank, possibly swayed by the public sentiment, extended an unexpected offer—we could reclaim our old home, and nothing else…  
We were back were we started again. Everything burned in the fire, but a nearby vacant farmhouse, had the same exact 1950’s furniture as ours. So, our life together returned to what it was, she lost he weight again, but became happier…Happier than ever.  
I lost my job again, and decided to put an end to it once and for all. I remembered my grandfather had an old hunting rifle in his closet, so I sneaked into their room and grabbed it.   
I used the sensors, to time when the anomalies would appear and waited by the garage for the crow to return. On time as usual, it landed on my still first, as I aimed the gun at it and pulled the trigger.  
But nothing happened. The gun jammed. I cursed and tried to fix it, but the bird didn't waste any time. It flew off the branch and landed on the ground, right in front of me. It tilted its head and opened its beak.   
"Put down the gun, honey. It's me, your mom.", and I dropped the gun.  
My grandmother hasn’t managed to get out of bed for the past week, and now my ‘grandfather’ spends most of his time with her. I haven’t wanted to look at what she’s become; It's tough to watch because she's slowly starving herself, but she seems happy, and I can't bring myself to interfere. What should I do?
