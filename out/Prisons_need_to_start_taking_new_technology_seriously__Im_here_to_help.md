We need to start being more serious about applications of VR. With the Meta Quest 3 and the Apple Vision Pro on the market, it's time to start developing some real applications that will have a positive impact in the world. My company has been working hand-in-hand with private prison companies to do just that. Here are some of our latest innovations.

Private prisons have been a hotbed for unethical behavior for decades, creating terrible conditions for inmates. But we don't want that to remain. Despite the allegations, the private prisons are hard at work to improve conditions and make prison more like a rehab than a dungeon. Fixing this is hard - so to get it right we should focus on providing better experiences for the inmates. This is where VR comes in! Imagine - we could design specific scenarios and lives for inmates to live through. Whatever lessons they need to be taught could easily be transferred to them as direct experiences. But don't take my word for it, here are a few great examples:

Inmate A is in prison for domestic violence. He beat his wife, then he beat his children. Uh oh, sounds like solitary confinement is needed! Thing is, nobody learns anything from solitary confinement. It's just a padded room, where you sit for a while until you get released and you go and repeat whatever heinous thing you did before. But what if instead of a padded room, it was a curated VR experience? Now inmate A is no longer just biding his time. He's reliving the pain and horror of what he did over and over. He's forced to rewatch his wife and children sobbing, begging for a way out, watching his own hands deny them of that. And this can just replay for weeks, months, years. Lesson learned, criminal! The whole world is about to learn a lot of empathy. If only we had this sooner.

Now take for example inmate B. B is a serial killer. A real psychopath with no feelings for others. We're not going to get through to inmate B with any emotional experiences. But not to worry! We've got something perfect for inmate B. A simulator where the inmate has full roam of a house, but someone in the house is trying to kill him. He can try to escape for as long as he wants... but don't worry, we've programmed it so that eventually, he will be caught. And we don't want the VR killer to be limited to VR tools - we've implemented all sorts of real-world consequences that the VR killer can activate - pepper spray, loud noises, tazers, needles - all things to make the killer really afraid of their VR death; without actually puting them at risk!  Using these tools, we can rehabilitate killers in ways that we never thought possible before. 

Now to inmate C. C is a white-collar criminal - in the past just inelligible for solitary confinement. But with our new system, VR confinement is appropriate for everyone! We can put them in a small room, but give them a luxurious prison loft that every white-collar criminal deserves. And don't worry - we'll still be focused on teaching them a lesson. In this simulated environment, they can make investments but they'll always tank. They can hire help, but the help will never clean their room enough, will rearrange their stuff, and will often steal small items they grew attached to. Take that rich criminals! And the best part is - we don't have to keep it comfortable. If they're not learning their lesson - we can switch to zaps, blunt force, drugs, and more to keep them in line. There really are no creative limits, and we're open-sourcing some of our torture algorithms to make sure they're always effective and appropriate!

So how do we do it? With our patented AI, we just decribe the crime, and the appropriate punishment that will prevent that person from ever committing that crime again comes out! The prison system has never been so efficient - graduate from your bespoke course and we guarantee you will never be willing to commit your crime again. No one who comes through it will be capable of being a repeat offender. And if they are incapable of graduating - they just won't be able to come through it! If you can't learn, it will kill you. No longer does the death penalty have to be a controversial topic! We've solved it down to a science.

So far, all of this has been about criminals. But it would be criminal to prevent society from taking advantage of this technology. So we invite you - send your troubled teens to us! Just describe what bad behaviors they're exhibiting, and we'll have a course ready to prevent that from ever happening again. We ask that you send them to us and refrain from checking in for 3 weeks. At that point, we guarantee the changes will be mind-blowing! And if you're not completely satisfied, we offer a full refund. There is literally no reason NOT to take advantage of this as soon as possible!

I hope, by now, you fully appreciate the value of everything being offered here. In the age of VR and AI, it would be foolish to continue trying to manually solve problems. What I've given here are just a few examples of what we can do - but in reality we're ready to take on ANY and ALL problems you might think you have. The solutions are all here - call today!
