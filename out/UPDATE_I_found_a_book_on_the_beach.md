hey all. It’s been awhile since my last update - I’ve mostly tried to focus on other things, mainly kayaking. I bought a used kayak at a local shop and Ive been taking it out on nice days, which has kept me pretty busy (thanks global warming?) I haven’t found any other books - and until yesterday - I hadn’t seen anything out of the ordinary or worth writing about. 


Yesterday I checked the weather report - sunny and 65 - so I went out around 2 or 3 pm (between high and low tide…so i dont get my ass kicked by the waves trying to get into the kayak at high tide and I dont have to shuffle in 1 feet of water for half a mile at low tide). For about 25-30 minutes, I just paddled around the harbor, enjoying one last beautiful fall afternoon before the absolute shitshow that is the new england winter. As soon as I started getting into a solid rhythm, a crazy strong wind picked up and it went from cloudless and sunny to literally the foggiest (is that a word??) ive ever seen in my entire life. 


The wind quickly died down but the fog really stuck around. Given I was like…half a mile from shore on almost all sides, I wasnt initially worried. But visibility was shit and Im not a super experienced kayaker so I figured Id head back to shore. I paddled and I paddled and i paadddlllleeed. No shore. No boats. My phone compass just told me northeast, regardless of which direction I faced. I recorded a video of myself at this point, which ive attached here, mostly just to keep myself calm and kinda “talk it out” with myself.

(language warning - i swear alot when im nervous. its a bad habit, i know)

 My phone stopped keeping time around this point as well - I lost service and the time stopped changing. I dont think thats a thing that usually happens when you lose service? But maybe it got wet and freaked out, I dunno.


 Regardless, Id say…after a few hours, I started hearing this SUPER loud deep banging and almost mechanical groaning in the fog so, believing that I was purely lost, started hauling ass toward the direction of the noise (granted, in the fog, it kinda sounded like it was coming from everywhere…but it seemed to concentrate slightly more in a specific direction). I paddled for *another* hour or so (and remember, I literally just got this frickin kayak so my arms are dust by now) until i saw it, what i think was making the sound. I attached a photo I took here.

 I should have taken a video in hindsight but like, words cannot describe the fucking *panic* i felt and i just wanted to use what little strength was left in my scrawny arms to go as far as I could in the opposite direction. It wasnt really moving when I saw it, it was just standing there, swaying slightly. Birds flew around it, at least I think they were birds - they sounded just like seagulls. It made a bubbling sound? Not sure how to describe other than it was like blowing bubbles into water with a straw, but far deeper - i could literally feel the sound in my chest. And it creaked, and groaned, which sounded like being in the hull of a giant ship (or atleast, what movies make it sound like). The smell was, if you can imagine it, like the worst low tide smell I’ve ever experienced. Sweet but rotten. Salty. All encompassing - it didn’t matter if I breathed through my mouth or held my nose, i could taste the air. I can still sorta taste it, if I think about it. 


So at this point, I turned my kayak as quietly and quickly as i could and just paddled in the other direction as it receded into the fog. I assumed it would hear me and chase me and I’d be broken apart like some sort of debris caught the in the wave of a tsunami. But it never moved, beyond it’s shuddering-like sway and I’m not sure it ever noticed me - or if it even hds the capacity to “notice” me. i suppose at the time it didnt really matter either way, because it was large and i am small and that was enough for me . Eventually, the groans and bubbling and creaking became quieter until it disappeared entirely. And it was just me and the fog again. I really cant overstate how oppressive thick fog can be, which i never realized before - theres nothing for your eyes to look at and there arent really any sounds. And when youre lost and you maybe just hallucinated a giant sea thing, it feels suffocating. I have asthma so i started getting pretty panicked that id suddenly have an attack and just die out there in the fog. It’s terrifying. I wish I were a better writer because the sense of doom you feel when there’s nothing, truly nothing, around you is distinct and sharp. 

I should also point out that the sun sets in new england at this point by like…5ish. And id been kayaking for hours and it was literally the same brightness as when I started, far past when the sun should have fully fucked off. So hours later, despite the brightness, I fucking terrified the sun is going to set and ill be stuck out in the blackness and the fog and the absolute silence and Im convinced im like 500 miles out to sea by now, which is why I havent seen land yet. I’m starting to wonder if I already died and this is some purgatory, like I’m just stuck here, forever. It’s insane now but like, it felt almost like a relief that there could be an explanation (although in hindsight, some shitty afterlife of pure gray nothing doesnt seem like a huge relief)

So I start panic kayaking. Like, I’m drooling through my teeth I’m kayaking so hard. Just desperate and cold and hungry and tired and scared and wholly done with being on the ocean. And as Im kayaking into oblivion, I hear a splashing sound behind me. Im thinking its the giant fucking crab thing and that Im totally dead (see: crashing tsumani of doom) but it’s just a small seal, staring at me with its pitchblack little eyes. And despite all this horrific shit, ive never seen a wild  seal before so im pretty mesmerized. We kinda stare at each other for a minute and it dives down to swim. This is the first normal thing Ive seen in hours and I start crying because I dont want to lose this lil dude and be all alone again. I can see the “trail” it makes in the water as it swims so I just follow it as fast as I can. So here I am, fucking balling my eyes out, like really ugly crying - snot all over my beard - chasing after this seal in the fog. 

The seal comes up after awhile and we stare at each other again and it dives down. We do this for awhile - how long, Im not sure. My arms stop hurting, i stop crying, and im basically just numb. We go and we go and we go and we go. The routine almost becomes a trance, i stop feeling almost anything other than the coolness of the fog.
honestly, this could have continued for 10 hours or 15 minutes - its almost like a blacked out from the sheer panic. All I know is there was an increase in wind and I saw the silhouettes of houses on the horizon, which snapped me out of it. I use the absolute last of my strength to push towards the silhouettes and the sun start streaming in, like some fucked fever dream. By the time I reach the houses, the fog has totally dissipated and Im back near the beach where I started. 

The seal pops up like, 15 feet from me,  and we stare at each other and i start fucking balling all over again because im so happy to be back but im also so confused and not sure if im just losing my mind and i know people are walking by the shore line seeing this dude just fucking sobbing in his kayak staring at a seal and i know it looks totally insane but i feel like if i even move ill fall into the ocean and ill never come back.  eventually, the seal kinda turns and does its little dive thing again and i paddled to the beach. 

i went back to my car and immediately vomited all over myself. and then i just sat there and stared for awhile, too fucking tired to even clean the vomit from my lap. 

So yeah, if anyone wants to buy a used kayak, let me know. 

But seriously - has anyone experienced something like this? Schizophrenia *really* runs in my family so i havent ruled that out yet, i guess. But that photo means something, right? Like, thats not just me imagining it? That I book I found had a whole section on deep sea gigantism and the implications for medical personnel on ships. I don’t know whats happening to me.
