I was desperate for money and had accepted a job as a housecleaner for an old man named Douglas, who had helped me out after my car had broken down.

I had my car in the shop being worked on, so he came to my apartment to pick me up.

As I arrived at the man's house, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease that washed over me.

The overgrown lawn and peeling paint only added to the foreboding atmosphere.

I hesitantly followed the old man to the door, where he invited me in with a sickening smile on his face.

The moment I stepped into his house, I knew I should have turned back.

It was dark and cluttered, with strange artifacts and pictures of nude women hanging on the walls.

I tried to ignore the feeling of dread that washed over me as he showed me around the house, and I began focusing on my housecleaning duties.

As I was cleaning, I came across something that made me feel sick to my stomach: a pair of my underwear and my diary.

He must have stolen them when he asked to use the bathroom at my apartment.

I hid them both in my coat pocket, hoping he wouldn't notice that they were missing while I was there.

The old man then came in and watched me closely and began making inappropriate comments and touching me in ways that made me feel uncomfortable.

I tried to ignore his advances and focus on my work, but he continued to follow me around and make advances.

I couldn't take it anymore and decided to leave.

I turned around only to see the old man standing there, leering at me with a wicked grin.

Before I knew it, he had lunged at me, cornered me, and pinned me up against the wall, trying to have his way with me.

I managed to get free of him, but as I tried to make my escape, the old man grabbed an axe and chased after me.

I screamed and ran for the door, my heart pounding in my chest.

I could hear his footsteps behind me as I stumbled down the steps and into the yard.

I didn't stop and had tears streaming down my face as I ran.

I kept running down the street, not daring to look back until I was miles away.

I finally made it to a gas station, where I stopped to catch my breath and calm down.

I reported the incident to the police and then called a taxi to take me back home.

I never went back to that house, and I never told anyone about it, but the thought of what could have happened if I hadn't escaped still scares me to this day, and the memory of that creepy old man chasing me with an axe will forever haunt me.

**Please note that this story is based on true events**

I did take on a job as a housecleaner for an old man named Douglas, who once assisted me when my car broke down. 

During my time cleaning his house, I discovered that he had numerous explicit pictures of women displayed throughout his home, and I also found some of my personal belongings, including my diary and a pair of my underwear. 

While he did make inappropriate comments towards me, I am thankful to say that he never attempted to make any physical advances or chased me with an axe, unlike the scenario in this story.
