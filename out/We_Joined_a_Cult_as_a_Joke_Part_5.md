The room was opulent. An ornate chandelier hung from the ceiling, casting a soft, golden light over the room. The walls were lined with rich, dark wood paneling, intricately carved with symbols of ancient rites and rituals. Heavy velvet drapes in deep crimson framed the tall windows, blocking out the night.

Tim and I were tied to heavy wooden chairs, our wrists raw from the ropes that bound us. Voss sat behind a desk, gently smoking a cigar. Chloe sat beside him, her eyes empty and distant, as if she had become a part of the darkness that surrounded us. My heart ached to see her like this, a shell of the woman I once knew.

Chloe’s aloofness was a dagger to my heart. She sat there silently, not even glancing in our direction. Her vacant stare spoke of submission, her spirit seemingly crushed.

"Now, gentlemen," Voss began with false warmth. "I am a reasonable man. This situation has escalated far beyond what I intended. I offer you a chance to walk away. Leave this place, and let my dear Chloe live her life in peace."

Desperation clawed at my insides. Every part of me wanted to fight, to tear Voss apart and reclaim what was mine. But I knew it was useless. Voss held all the power. Walking away felt like a betrayal, but staying meant certain death—and for what? To watch Chloe remain a prisoner to this monster?

"I have a counteroffer," I said, my voice resolute.

Voss raised an eyebrow, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Oh, this should be good. Let's hear it."

"I recorded everything tonight," I declared. "There's a camera hidden in my collar. Every word, every action—it's all on video."

Voss’s amusement vanished, replaced by a cold fury. He gestured to Wilcox, who stepped forward and ripped the tiny device from my collar. With a swift, brutal motion, Voss crushed it under his heel, the sound of breaking plastic echoing in the chamber.

"So much for your leverage," he sneered, his eyes narrowing.

"Does the name Kelly with GSNN mean anything to you?" I asked, struggling to keep the excitement out of my voice.

Voss froze mid-drag, the cigar smoke lingering like a ghost. "Journalists today have some impressive tech. That wasn’t a recorder; it was a transmitter. Kelly has a live feed of everything—including you murdering two men in cold blood."

For a moment, silence hung in the air. Voss’s face contorted with rage, his eyes blazing. He took a long, deliberate drag from his cigar before exhaling slowly, the smoke curling around his head.

"You think that changes anything? Chloe belongs to me. She will always return to my side, no matter what. Should she release the tapes I have ways to make it disappear. You have no power here."

"I’ll stay then," I said, my voice steady. "Let me go through the initiation. If this is what she wants, then I’ll go through it too."

Voss’s eyebrow arched, a smile curling at the edges of his lips. He savored the moment, his eyes gleaming with twisted delight. "Alright," he said finally, his voice dripping with mock sincerity. "But first, I expect confirmation that the tape has been deleted."

"Yes, of course," I replied, "But you also have to let Tim go. He was just trying to save his sister."

Voss considered for a moment, then nodded. "Right. That seems acceptable," he said.

Before anything else could happen, Chloe’s voice sliced through the tension like a knife. "I never took you for the religious type."

The entire room turned to her in stunned silence. In one swift, decisive motion, Chloe’s hand darted forward, seizing the ceremonial dagger from the table. With a fierce, guttural cry, she plunged it into Voss’s chest. Blood sprayed from the wound, splattering the floor as Voss staggered back, his eyes wide with shock and pain.

For the first time in what felt like an eternity, Chloe’s face showed a flicker of emotion—fierce determination, a blazing fire of resistance that had been rekindled.

The doctor lunged at us, his knife flashing in the dim light. Tim, despite his unsteady state, summoned a surge of primal strength. With a guttural roar, he crashed into the doctor, their bodies colliding with bone-jarring force. The knife slipped from the doctor's grasp, clattering to the floor as Tim’s raw fury overwhelmed him.

What followed was a blur of unrestrained rage. Tim’s fists pounded relentlessly, each punch landing with a sickening crunch that echoed through the room. Even with just one hand, he pummeled the doctor, transforming his face into a grotesque, pulpy mess. Blood sprayed in violent arcs, splattering the floor and walls.

Gasping for breath, Tim stood over the lifeless body, his chest heaving with exertion. I turned to Chloe, confusion and anger swirling within me. Grabbing her shoulders, I searched her eyes for answers, desperate to understand.

"Is it really you? Why did you do that to me?" My voice trembled.

Chloe met my gaze, her eyes swimming with guilt and sorrow. "George, I... I'm so sorry. I knew we didn't stand a chance. If I had shot him on that stage, they would have killed us all without hesitation."

Her voice wavered, barely holding back tears. "I thought if I kept up the act, if I played along just a little longer, you and Tim might leave. You could escape and have a life. The thought of you dying because of me... I couldn't bear it."

Chloe’s eyes searched mine, brimming with deep sadness. "I wanted you to be safe, to be happy, even if it meant losing you forever. I wanted you to live."

"But why now? Why fight back now?" I demanded, tears welling up in my eyes.

Chloe’s expression softened, her remorse evident. "Seeing how hard you fought... I couldn’t stand by anymore. I’d rather die trying to escape than live as his pawn. You gave me the courage to fight back."

I embraced her, the warmth of her skin grounding me in the reality that she was truly with me. For a moment, we held each other, the chaos around us fading into the background.

Tim’s fists clenched, his anger simmering just beneath the surface. “You don’t get it. We were risking everything, and you—” He glanced down at his mangled hand.

“I know what you were risking!” Chloe interrupted, her voice breaking with emotion. “Every day I played along, I was risking my life too.”

Tim’s shoulders sagged, the fire in his eyes dimming. “But you seemed like one of them,” he muttered, the betrayal still evident in his voice.

Chloe stepped closer, her eyes pleading. "I had to make them believe I was loyal. It was the only way to protect you both. I never stopped fighting for a way out, even when it meant hurting you. Please, understand."

Tim looked away, his anger slowly ebbing. The tension in the room began to ease as he processed Chloe’s words. Finally, he nodded, the betrayal in his eyes giving way to a weary acceptance.

A flicker of movement in the shadows caught my eye. A cultist stood there, eyes wide, face pale. He had been hiding, witnessing everything. Stumbling back, he knocked over a candelabrum, the candles spilling and igniting a small fire.

For a moment, time stretched. The cultist’s gaze darted between the bodies on the floor and us. Tim stepped forward, growling, "Don't move a muscle."

The cultist’s chest heaved, sweat beading on his forehead. The room felt like it was holding its breath, only the distant echo of footsteps and muffled chants breaking the silence.

Tim lunged at the cultist, aiming to subdue him. The cultist’s robes slipped through Tim's grasp, the slick fabric giving him just enough leverage to escape. He stumbled backward, eyes wide with terror, and bolted down the hallway.

"Voss and Wilcox are dead!" His voice ricocheted off the stone walls, reverberating through the corridors. "They're dead! They're dead!"

A chill shot through me. "Fuck, they’re onto us. What do we do?" My voice barely masked the panic rising in my throat. The sounds of hurried footsteps and shouts grew louder, crashing towards us like a tidal wave.

Chloe’s face tightened, a blend of resolve and fear. "We need to move, now," she urged, eyes flicking to the corridor. "We're out of time."

A roar erupted from the corridors, a wave of alarmed voices. Footsteps pounded the stone floors, growing louder, more frantic. The cultists were mobilizing, their shouts echoing like a battle cry.

“Voss is dead! Wilcox is dead!” The cries repeated, each iteration driving a spike of dread deeper into my chest. The noise grew closer, the footsteps merging into an ominous rumble.

Chloe’s eyes darted around. “There’s a secret passage behind that tapestry,” she said urgently. “I’ve seen Wilcox use it.”

Tim and I exchanged a quick glance. “How do you know about this?” I whispered as the sounds of the crowd grew deafening.

“I’ve been locked in here for weeks,” Chloe replied, her voice steady despite the chaos. “I’ve observed everything.”

We rushed to the tapestry. Chloe pushed it aside, revealing a narrow door. She tried the handle, but it didn’t budge. “It’s locked,” she said, frustration creeping into her voice. Then her eyes lit up. “The key—Voss must have it.”

Without hesitation, Chloe ran to Voss’s lifeless body and rifled through his robes. She pulled out a small, ornate key. At the same moment, I grabbed the ceremonial dagger from Voss's chest, its blade gleaming wickedly in the dim light.

Chloe returned and inserted the key into the lock. It turned with a heavy click, and the door creaked open, revealing a dark, narrow passage.

We stepped into the passage, the air immediately cooler and damp. The walls were rough-hewn stone, closing in around us. Faint, musty smells of earth and decay filled the space. The only light came from the open door behind us, casting long, eerie shadows.

Chloe led the way, her hand trailing along the wall for guidance. “Stay close,” she whispered, her voice echoing softly. We moved deeper, the sounds of chaos fading, replaced by the soft drip of water and the distant scurrying of unseen creatures.

The passage twisted and turned, leading us further from the mansion’s heart. We passed small alcoves with forgotten relics—old books, rusted tools, and decayed cloth. The path was uneven, forcing us to watch our steps.

The air grew colder, the walls closing in. It felt like we were descending into the bowels of the earth. The oppressive silence was broken only by our breathing and the occasional creak of the ancient structure.
