The room was opulent. An ornate chandelier hung from the ceiling, casting a soft, golden light over the room. The walls were lined with rich, dark wood paneling, intricately carved with symbols of ancient rites and rituals. Heavy velvet drapes in deep crimson framed the tall windows, blocking out the night.

Tim and I were tied to heavy wooden chairs, our wrists raw from the ropes that bound us. Voss sat behind a desk, gently smoking a cigar. Chloe sat beside him, her eyes empty and distant, as if she had become a part of the darkness that surrounded us. My heart ached to see her like this, a shell of the woman I once knew.

Chloe’s aloofness was a dagger to my heart. She sat there silently, not even glancing in our direction. Her vacant stare spoke of submission, her spirit seemingly crushed.

"Now, gentlemen," Voss began with false warmth. "I am a reasonable man. This situation has escalated far beyond what I intended. I offer you a chance to walk away. Leave this place, and let my dear Chloe live her life in peace."

Desperation clawed at my insides. Every part of me wanted to fight, to tear Voss apart and reclaim what was mine. But I knew it was useless. Voss held all the power. Walking away felt like a betrayal, but staying meant certain death—and for what? To watch Chloe remain a prisoner to this monster?

"I have a counteroffer," I said, my voice resolute.

Voss raised an eyebrow, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Oh, this should be good. Let's hear it."

"I recorded everything tonight," I declared. "There's a camera hidden in my collar. Every word, every action—it's all on video."

Voss’s amusement vanished, replaced by a cold fury. He gestured to Wilcox, who stepped forward and ripped the tiny device from my collar. With a swift, brutal motion, Voss crushed it under his heel, the sound of breaking plastic echoing in the chamber.

"So much for your leverage," he sneered, his eyes narrowing.

"Does the name Kelly with GSNN mean anything to you?" I asked, struggling to keep the excitement out of my voice.

Voss froze mid-drag, the cigar smoke lingering like a ghost. "Journalists today have some impressive tech. That wasn’t a recorder; it was a transmitter. Kelly has a live feed of everything—including you murdering two men in cold blood."

For a moment, silence hung in the air. Voss’s face contorted with rage, his eyes blazing. He took a long, deliberate drag from his cigar before exhaling slowly, the smoke curling around his head.

"You think that changes anything? Chloe belongs to me. She will always return to my side, no matter what. Should she release the tapes I have ways to make it disappear. You have no power here."

"I’ll stay then," I said, my voice steady. "Let me go through the initiation. If this is what she wants, then I’ll go through it too."

Voss’s eyebrow arched, a smile curling at the edges of his lips. He savored the moment, his eyes gleaming with twisted delight. "Alright," he said finally, his voice dripping with mock sincerity. "But first, I expect confirmation that the tape has been deleted."

"Yes, of course," I replied, "But you also have to let Tim go. He was just trying to save his sister."

Voss considered for a moment, then nodded. "Right. That seems acceptable," he said.

Before anything else could happen, Chloe’s voice sliced through the tension like a knife. "I never took you for the religious type."

The entire room turned to her in stunned silence. In one swift, decisive motion, Chloe’s hand darted forward, seizing the ceremonial dagger from the table. With a fierce, guttural cry, she plunged it into Voss’s chest. Blood sprayed from the wound, splattering the floor as Voss staggered back, his eyes wide with shock and pain.

For the first time in what felt like an eternity, Chloe’s face showed a flicker of emotion—fierce determination, a blazing fire of resistance that had been rekindled.

The doctor lunged at us, his knife flashing in the dim light. Tim, despite his unsteady state, summoned a surge of primal strength. With a guttural roar, he crashed into the doctor, their bodies colliding with bone-jarring force. The knife slipped from the doctor's grasp, clattering to the floor as Tim’s raw fury overwhelmed him.

What followed was a blur of unrestrained rage. Tim’s fists pounded relentlessly, each punch landing with a sickening crunch that echoed through the room. Even with just one hand, he pummeled the doctor, transforming his face into a grotesque, pulpy mess. Blood sprayed in violent arcs, splattering the floor and walls.

Gasping for breath, Tim stood over the lifeless body, his chest heaving with exertion. I turned to Chloe, confusion and anger swirling within me. Grabbing her shoulders, I searched her eyes for answers, desperate to understand.

"Is it really you? Why did you do that to me?" My voice trembled.

Chloe met my gaze, her eyes swimming with guilt and sorrow. "George, I... I'm so sorry. I knew we didn't stand a chance. If I had shot him on that stage, they would have killed us all without hesitation."

Her voice wavered, barely holding back tears. "I thought if I kept up the act, if I played along just a little longer, you and Tim might leave. You could escape and have a life. The thought of you dying because of me... I couldn't bear it."

Chloe’s eyes searched mine, brimming with deep sadness. "I wanted you to be safe, to be happy, even if it meant losing you forever. I wanted you to live."

"But why now? Why fight back now?" I demanded, tears welling up in my eyes.

Chloe’s expression softened, her remorse evident. "Seeing how hard you fought... I couldn’t stand by anymore. I’d rather die trying to escape than live as his pawn. You gave me the courage to fight back."

I embraced her, the warmth of her skin grounding me in the reality that she was truly with me. For a moment, we held each other, the chaos around us fading into the background.

Tim’s fists clenched, his anger simmering just beneath the surface. “You don’t get it. We were risking everything, and you—” He glanced down at his mangled hand.

“I know what you were risking!” Chloe interrupted, her voice breaking with emotion. “Every day I played along, I was risking my life too.”

Tim’s shoulders sagged, the fire in his eyes dimming. “But you seemed like one of them,” he muttered, the betrayal still evident in his voice.

Chloe stepped closer, her eyes pleading. "I had to make them believe I was loyal. It was the only way to protect you both. I never stopped fighting for a way out, even when it meant hurting you. Please, understand."

Tim looked away, his anger slowly ebbing. The tension in the room began to ease as he processed Chloe’s words. Finally, he nodded, the betrayal in his eyes giving way to a weary acceptance.

A faint whisper reached my ears. I turned, eyes scanning the room, and noticed a flicker of movement. In the shadowed corner, a cultist stood, his eyes wide with fear and recognition. He had been hiding, silently witnessing the carnage. The room seemed to close in around us. The cultist's gaze darted frantically between the lifeless bodies on the floor and us, as if trying to decide his next move. Suddenly, he knocked over a candelabrum, the candles spilling and igniting a small fire.

He fumbled backward, tripping over his own feet, giving Tim a moment to lunge at him. The cultist scrambled up, his eyes wild with panic, and bolted towards the door, knocking over a chair in his haste.

"Voss and Wilcox are dead! They're dead!" he screamed, his voice rising to a panicked wail. As he reached the door, he swung it open with such force that it struck Tim, causing him to stumble back, clutching his side.

The cultist’s screams echoed through the stone corridors. The sound of hurried footsteps and frantic shouts grew louder, a wave of chaos crashing towards us. Chloe’s face tightened with resolve and fear.

"We need to go! Now!" she urged, her voice cutting through the rising din.

The noise from the cultists swelled, the sound of impending doom that pressed in on us from all sides. An ominous chant began, echoing through the corridors.

Chloe’s eyes darted around the room, searching for an escape. "There’s a passage behind that tapestry. I've seen Wilcox use it," she said urgently, pointing to a heavy drape hanging on the wall. We rushed to it, and she pushed it aside, revealing a narrow wooden door. She tried the handle, but it didn’t budge. "It’s locked," she muttered, frustration creeping into her voice. Then her eyes lit up with realization. "The key—Voss must have it."

She ran to Voss’s lifeless body and rifled through his robes. Her hands trembled slightly as she searched, finally discovering a hidden compartment in his cloak. She pulled out a small, ornate key. An object fell from his cloak and rolled to the floor - the heart shaped stone from the ritual. Instinctively, I grabbed a cloth and wrapped it up before placing it in my pocket. I had no plans on what to do with it, but I did know it was valuable to them.

She inserted the key into the lock, and with a heavy click, the door creaked open. We quickly stepped inside, the air immediately cooler and damp. The rough-hewn stone walls pressed in around us, their surfaces slick with moisture and covered in a thin layer of moss. Strange, glowing symbols pulsed with light on the walls, casting an eerie glow that seemed to dance in the corners of my vision. A musty smell filled the air, mingling with the faint scent of decay. The passage was narrower than expected, the walls almost brushing our shoulders. I slammed the door shut, catching one last glimpse of the small fire catching on a tapestry.

Chloe led the way, her hand trailing along the damp, cold wall for guidance. The chaotic noise from above gradually faded, replaced by the soft drip of water and the occasional scurrying of unseen creatures. The passage twisted and turned, its narrow confines making it easy to get lost. As we moved deeper, the walls seemed to close in, and the air grew colder and heavier.

We passed small alcoves filled with forgotten relics—rusted tools, decayed cloth, and crumbling books that hinted at the passage's ancient history. The floor became increasingly unstable, with loose stones and creaking wood underfoot. Each step echoed in the oppressive silence, broken only by our breathing and the occasional creak of the foundation. Each moment filled with the fear of what might lie ahead or pursue us from behind.
