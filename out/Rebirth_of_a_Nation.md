It's been 3 years since we (the Pop Punk Rebirth Party, we came from middle-class to upper middle class backgrounds) successfully took over the Philippines and turned it into a powerful, prosperous country. Why is our party so named: most of us love pop punk and our suggested Party member attire is "emo glasses", a pop punk merch shirt and flannel (tied around our waist outside buildings, worn with an open front inside buildings, Chuck Taylors or Vans as shoes, and body armor underneath our attire.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Corrupt politicians (and their scions) are gone (they suffered a Romanov-style fate). We constructed a floating structure at the permanent snow line (positioned at 15,800 ft) that is also a giant supercomputer, cooled by cold air, kept aloft by geothermal heat and computer waste heat; this allows Filipinos to experience snow. Circumcision is a procedure done to consenting adults; the barbaric tradition of using it to reify masculinity in non-consenting minors is gone with our campaign to modernize the country. The traditions of anti-intellectualism and "Filipino pride" (insecurity) was also abolished. Abortion (and use of fetal tissue transplants), no-fault divorce, prostitution and all recreational drug use was fully legalized. Comprehensive sex ed became mandatory in schools, and school uniforms and school haircut policies were banned by the state, allowing children to express themselves. We also taught children the abuses of the previous administration (such as how the previous government let in criminal syndicates set up "scamming factories" were people were tortured if the trafficked persons didn't scam successfully enough). Simple possession of firearms was decriminalized, and the Philippine National Police was defunded, funds being reallocated to the DSWD (the organization that helps abused children). Abused children are given free money.

&nbsp;

We were intelligent, so the people's worries of brain drain are gone. We also automated the jobs of the lower class and gave them UBI and free housing. We were so intelligent, we have two nuclear warheads right now, with more to come, built in secret, away from the prying eyes of the United States.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

We have empathy to many people, and like many humans, our empathy was selective, and we were vengeful and unforgiving to some people. Due to this, we conducted torturous human experimentation (the deadly ones were done on persons convicted of heinous violent crimes such as child abuse, the less fatal/"safer" ones on persons that were "obstructions" to our revolution such as priests, conservative parents).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

But anyway, we'll tell you a dirty little secret: **how we turned the worst "human beings"/abusers into our toys**.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Take for example the "beat experiments". We hit child abusers various times and in various locations in the head with various blunt instruments and see how long it took for the traumatic brain injury to kill them (hours, days), and noted them. We also hit child abusers in the limbs to see how long the rhabdomyolysis killed them. We sent all medical information to head doctors affiliated with us. "Snuff" style videos of these were taken, with the convicted offenses being in "ticker tape" form at the top and bottom of the video. We also did "slash artery save" experiments in which we would slash an artery (such as the neck or femoral) that can cause exsanguination, and then immediately save the abuser with a soldering iron (without anesthesia).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

In addition to this, we did dementia research experiments using vCJD and experimental anti-prion medication. "Control" subjects died within the year, their brains fatally lobotomized by the dangerous proteins. We are getting closer and closer to finding a cure for Alzheimer's every day. We also experimented with various prion denaturing techniques. Gunshot wound time to death, gunshot wound treatment, Chlorine trifluoride weapons and other weapons experiments were done.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Yet another series of experiments are head transplantation, injecting stem cells to repair the brain, and, how to keep brain cells from dying after blood flow is interrupted (useful for stroke but also we're working on a way to keep the brains of our supersoldiers (yes we have a supersoldier program) from being damaged after being decapitated), as well as asphyxiation experiments that involve artificial nanorobotic blood cells and faking being strangled or smothered to death.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Our more "benign" experiments included PTSD and CPTSD treatment to make the traumatized person "happy at any cost", up to including sex and drugs and free concerts, as well as "Third Wave" style social experiments at schools, so that children can learn to prevent people worse than us from being in political power in the future.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Yes, we (the Pop Punk Rebirth Party) did a lot of work after the takeover, so just because we took over, it didn't mean we're gonna be "lazy monarchs". We know many things we did were evil, but we won't whitewash our names in textbooks; our chosen successors will also ensure that a full record of our human rights violations will be published, something some of us call "the receipt".

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

We hope that one day, good citizens that respect human rights will replace us.
