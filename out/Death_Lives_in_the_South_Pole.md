Madness as a concept, in my opinion, is widely misportrayed in some modern media. Padded rooms and mindless actions are not always the form that madness takes. Einstein defined insanity as the repetition of the same action paired with the hope of a changing outcome. I don’t disagree necessarily, but I do believe he was talking about a different kind of insanity than what I have become familiar with. I think that madness can be logical in and of itself. That is, I believe someone can be changed so deeply that their concept of what is logical no longer fits the expected societal norm. This is the type of madness that I have become familiar with over the past few years. I believe it to be far worse. Far more sinister. Far more dangerous.

I’m an ex-military man. I’ve never been quite the brightest, but I can take orders and I’ve got good survival instincts. I joined the army right after high school, not knowing what else to do with myself. It was a temporary fix, but when I got out, I was just as lost as I was before. I ended up taking odd jobs that I figured would be close enough to the military that I’d be competent at them. Mostly, I’ve worked as a bodyguard for various B-list celebrities. I make a decent enough living, though, and I’m not unhappy with my life.

But 2 years ago, I got an email from someone I didn't recognize—a Dr. Fitz. Not the medicine type of doctor, he was an archaeologist. I looked him up; he’s pretty well known and respected—the rich philanthropist type. Or, was, I guess. His email was pretty vague—he introduced himself and invited me out to dinner the next day. It was some fancy Italian place I never would’ve stepped foot in otherwise, at least not as a customer. We chatted for a bit, exchanging pleasantries and making jokes. I didn’t expect him to be, but Dr. Fitz was a nice guy. He had a good head on his shoulders—something that I find to be rare among famous people. Admittedly, I was about four drinks in at this point. Not drunk, but loose and comfortable.

After we finished eating, his demeanor shifted. He leaned in, voice lowered,

“I’m sorry if I’ve breached your privacy. But I had some of my employees look into you. I wanted to be sure about you and now that I am, I’ve got a job you’d be perfect for. You’ll be paid well. From what I understand, I’d estimate I can offer you the equivalent of what you normally make in a year.”

I sat silent for a little, taken aback by the change in conversation.

“You ran some kind of background check on me? Why?”

“Yes. Like I said I needed to be sure of you. From the sound of it, you seem like someone who can keep quiet when needed. And I need protection."

“Protection from what? Aren’t you an archaeologist? I thought you guys just dug up dinosaur bones. If you want me to take this job of yours, you’ll need to stop being vague.”

His eyes scanned the nearly empty restaurant—just a couple of people left across from us. Apparently satisfied, he leaned in and spoke again, still hushed,

“I found something big. Honestly, the less you know about it, the better for both of us. But what I can say is that, if I’m right and if we can find what I’m betting on, it’ll rewrite human history.”

Needless to say, I was skeptical,

“Listen, Dr. Fitz. My dad taught me that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. I’m no super soldier. Why would some famous doctor buy me dinner and then offer me a hundred grand for one job?”

He smiled,

“I don’t need super soldiers. I need people who can do as they’re told and can keep their mouth shut. Correct me if I’m wrong, but you seem like just the man for the task.”

I couldn’t disagree. In most things, I would say I’m painfully average. But what I have always excelled at, from childhood until now, is doing what other people tell me. And, honestly, his offer was tempting. Not just because of the money, but because of what he had said. If I was a part of some job that could change history, I could finally tell myself that I’m somebody. That I did something with my life out of the ordinary—something that stood out in a sea of thoughtless mundanity and monotony. I don’t have kids, not yet at least. But this was a chance for me to show future generations who I was. A chance to be remembered. I was surprised that I wanted this. I had never sought recognition before but maybe I just never believed I could accomplish it. But here it was, the chance staring me in the face. I couldn’t say no.

I held my hand out to him across the table. He smiled and shook it.

“When do I start?”

Still shaking my hand excitedly, the young doctor spoke more excitedly than he had our entire conversation,

“Tonight. You won’t be needing anything so don’t worry about packing. You and I are heading to the airport right now.”

I wanted to protest. But he had checked my history. He knew as well as I did that I had nothing waiting for me at home. So, we did as he had said. One of his employees drove us to the airport where we met up with another group of people. Taking a headcount, it was me, the doctor, a gruff middle-aged man and a young woman. They introduced themselves as Vince, a demolitions expert, and Dana, an anthropologist and linguist. We all got along well enough, but they were a quiet bunch. Fitz and Dana spent the first hours of our flight chatting about things I didn’t really understand. I caught words here and there: “Ruins, carvings, artifacts.” Nothing I could really make an inference off of without any context. After 3 hours of flying, I knocked out. Sure, I wanted to know where we were going. But I had already taken the deal, it’s not like I was gonna turn back now.

When I woke up, we were already descending. I looked out the window to see nothing but mountains, ice, and snow. I recognized this place from nature documentaries I would watch late at night when I couldn’t sleep.

“You took us to the North Pole?” I asked, a bit outraged.

Dana answered,

“The South Pole, actually.”

I stared at them both, confused and more than a little annoyed.

“What the hell does an archaeologist want with snow and penguins?”

Fitz smirked, a little too pleased with himself.

“It’s not snow or penguins we’re after. It’s history.”

I wasn’t in the mood for his games.

“Just tell me what we’re doing here. What exactly is it you’re after?”

He exhaled slowly, like he was weighing his words.

“If I told you, you wouldn’t believe me. But you’ll see soon enough. Just be patient.”

Again, I was frustrated. But what was I supposed to do? Swim back?

We touched down on a tiny airstrip at the base of a mountain range. The base consisted of five buildings that I was told we would be staying in until we were ready to depart the next day. From the sound of it, we were going up those mountains. There was no objection from me. Like I said before, doing physical labor at the behest of others is how I’ve made my living up until now. A hike through the snow wasn’t enough to scare me off, but I wish it had been.

I made myself at home in the room they assigned me, showered, ate, and then drank with Vince. He’s quiet, like I said, but a few shots loosened him up slightly. Like Fitz, I thought he was a good guy. He told me he had been in the French military and that’s how he got into his profession as a demolitions expert. That’s really all I could get out of him.

My alarm woke me early the next morning and I got ready for our trip. I’ll spare you most of the details—it’s pretty much what you’d expect. The South Pole is beautiful the same way a desert is. The vast expanse of nothing has its own charm but, at that moment, I was cold and tired and not much else mattered to me. We hiked for most of the day—from 6 a.m. until 5 p.m.

I figured we’d make camp, but the group wasn’t stopping. After we summited yet another peak, I got a view of the valley below. Dr. Fitz had been right, this was going to change human history. Below us, in a valley surrounded by these steep cliffs, was a city. It looked foreign—I didn’t recognize the architecture or even the materials it seemed to be made out of. It was dark—a jewel of onyx resting on a blanket of snow.

Dr. Fitz, seeing how dumbfounded I was, slapped my back and said,

“Told you so.”

I had a million questions all at once, but I only asked two.

“What is that place? Who built it?”

Dana, unable to contain her excitement, spoke before the doctor could,

“We don’t know the answer to either of those questions. That’s what we’re here for. An artifact surfaced a few years ago that suggested a lost civilization in the Arctic, one that may have even been from an advanced—”

“That's enough, Dana. Sorry, Clay. The less you know about this place, the better it is for us all. All you need to know is that we’re headed there for information. And you’re here to keep us safe.”

That was the very thought that had been forming in my mind.

“Safe from what?” I asked quietly.

“From rumors.”

I could tell by his tone that he wasn’t going to elaborate. So, with a newfound caution and awe, I trudged with the group down the mountain until we made it to the city. The group had provided me with arms—a rifle and a sidearm. Along with this, Vince had a handgun and a backpack full of explosives. I felt prepared enough. Unless that abandoned city had a functioning army, we’d be just fine.

Up close, the city was even more bizarre than I had thought. The walls and streets were lined with strange markings and symbols. I didn’t recognize any of them, but Dana and Fitz were all over them. There was a juxtaposition that was almost funny. The two of them were like kids in a candy shop while Vince and I were on edge and uneasy. The roads and buildings were made of the same materials: smooth, dark obsidian and dense, weathered basalt, their cold surfaces reflecting the harsh environment around us. More than that, the city gave off this warmth that’s hard for me to describe. It felt living, like the heat that comes off of a person.

But more than just the stones they were made of, the buildings themselves were alien to me. Tall, angular structures that made no sense. Towers trailed up to the sky only to blossom into pyramids or some other geometric shapes that defied reason. Mazes of obelisks formed a forest of stone towards the heart of the great city. Following Fitz and Dana, our group trudged cautiously through the city with silent awe.

Everyone had been silent for a good while now, too in awe of our surroundings to speak. Dr. Fitz and Dana took pictures, samples, and jotted notes furiously as we went. I spoke up,

“We got what you guys wanted? We can turn back now, yeah?”

Dr. Fitz seemed almost offended,

“Turn back? We are at the greatest discovery in all of human history. We are not turning back until we see the end.”

The group didn’t speak up and I took their silence as agreement. So, on we went.

I’ll warn you, reader, that this is the part where things stop being nice. If you’re squeamish, maybe consider stopping here.

The obelisk maze went on and on for what felt like longer than it should have. Honestly, I was convinced Fitz had us going in circles. By now it was around 9, but light wasn’t an issue. Antarctica, as I learned, has what is known as a polar day. Meaning the sun doesn’t set for months. But it was still dim—the mountains encircling this place blocked the sun’s rays, shrouding us in a veil of shadow.

What was an issue were the noises. Bubbling, like a boiling soup, paired with slithering and squelching came from every direction. Vince and I scanned our surroundings constantly, pointing our weapons nervously back and forth across our field of vision.

At some point, Dana stopped. Her footsteps had made a sound that didn’t align with those that had preceded it. Instead of a rocky click, her step had made a sickening squish. We all looked down to her foot, which was now ankle deep in a greenish-black, semi-solid sludge. We followed the sludge with our eyes to reveal something that still haunts me. It started midway up one of the obelisks, where it sat like a slug. An amorphous being of yellow eyes and dark jelly-like biomatter. Its body trailed down the obelisk to the floor where Dana’s foot had been caught like a snare.

At first, it seemed like nothing. For a brief, tense moment, nothing happened. Then, Dana made the mistake of trying to yank her foot out. My guess is that these things work a bit like a spider’s web. Motion must trigger them to action. Because as soon as she did this, she began to scream and flail desperately, trying with all her might to free her foot. Vince and I tried to pull her out by her arms, but this only sped up the process.

The sludge was crawling up her leg, now reaching just below her knee. And worse, it had begun to eat away at her. When I was a freshman in high school, I took a biology class. The only thing I can remember from it is a video about white blood cells and how they kill germs. It’s pretty brutal: they engulf whatever it is they’re after and digest it with enzymes—a mix of suffocating and dissolving. At that moment, that video was all I could think about.

I fired off 4 rounds into the blob with no effect. The bullets pierced a hole through its surface only for it to be filled in again—like a stone dropping into a pond. I could see the bullets melting inside of it. By now, Dana’s foot was mostly gone—only loose bone was remaining. Her calf was quickly following suit; I could see her muscle melting off like cotton candy in water.

I don’t know if she was lucky or unlucky, but her leg came off below the knee. She was in shock, of course, but she was free from the monster. Vince immediately used his belt to tourniquet her leg, but we would need to carry her. I turned back, ready to guide us out of here, only for my heart to sink to my stomach. I don’t know if these things could talk to each other or if they just heard us screaming, but we were caged in by scores of those amorphous things. Going back the way we came wasn’t an option. Fitz leading the way, Vince and I carried Dana in between us until we reached the middle.

I wasn’t sure what I was expecting, but it wasn’t this. There was a hole in the middle of the city. One so deep and so dark that I couldn’t see the bottom. But we all knew what was behind us. The choice was being melted alive or risking death by falling, and it was an easy one. Fitz was the first to jump, but the rest of us followed suit quickly after. We fell for a long time. I’m not sure how long, but it felt like hours.

I collided with the ground below with violent force. It was almost the strangest thing that had happened that day. I felt my body hit the floor with enough force to make me a pancake, but I wasn’t hurt. My body, as far as I could tell, was unharmed by the fall. I got up, brushing myself off, to see Vince holding an unconscious Dana and Fitz standing dead still, looking out over our new surroundings.

“What the hell were tho—”

My words died in my throat.

We weren’t in some dark cave—it was brighter than it had been outside that day. We stood in what I can only describe as an enormous throne room. Please don’t misunderstand. When I say enormous, I mean that after what must have been miles of space, was the end of the room. There, at the end of the cavernous chamber, was a throne the size of a skyscraper. It shifted and moved impossibly. It seemed like smoke or liquid the way it writhed, yet I know it was solid. It was dark, yet it exuded an unnatural light. Still, I almost didn’t even notice it.

Its occupant was not something I could look away from. It drew my eyes in like a black hole. To me, it took the form of a beast—three heads, each covered with glowing eyes of every color, and four draconian wings that spread out far enough to touch the walls of the room. Its skin was covered in dark, leathery scales. Every piece of it changed constantly like the throne it was seated on. Fitz was transfixed, staring at the beast with reverence.

Reflecting on it now, I’ve grown to understand details about the events that followed this. Ones that I believe give me a deeper understanding of why this happened. Stories exist of monsters like this. Of supernatural powers that are too much for a human—that merely looking at these beings can rip your sanity from you. But that isn’t true. You see, you can look at them and be unharmed. I did, after all. What drives one to insanity is the understanding of it.

You see, in the same way that an insect can observe a work of art, a human can observe these things. The insect has no understanding of it—it doesn’t understand the love, hatred, passion, grief, or any other emotion that a work of art may portray. But if the insect were, for just a moment, to grasp the meaning of beauty and emotion—if higher knowledge were forced upon it in a fleeting instant—its entire understanding of purpose and logic would be irrevocably altered. Having seen this higher existence, it would give anything it could to regain this understanding. Its past life as an insect would be inconsequential in comparison to its new goal. I believe this is exactly what happened to Dr. Fitz.

I don’t know what he saw, and I don’t ever want to know. Whatever it was, it changed him. He didn't care about fame, money, or even history anymore. His only drive was to see what he had been shown once again—to understand once more what his mind wasn’t capable of understanding.

Calmly, he turned and approached Vince, who was still caring for Dana, the latter of which had become semi-conscious. He took the handgun from the holster at his side and, without hesitation, executed Vince. Dana screamed with fresh horror.

I aimed my gun at Fitz, who didn't pay me any mind. I yelled with as much conviction as I could muster,

“Drop it!”

Still, I got no reaction from him. He fell to his knees and began to scoop up Vince's blood from off of the floor. Using it, he drew symbols on his own face, torso, and arms—the same symbols that decorated the city above.

In a panic, Dana crawled on her back away from the doctor, kicking against the floor with her one leg. This proved to be a mistake. She had positioned herself immediately below the cavern we had come down. Like a hellish rain, the amorphous cells from the city fell around her. Her screams crescendoed until they were cut off by the mass that fell on top of her. She was encased completely, silently screaming as the flesh melted from her bones. Soon, Dana had vanished completely.

I wasn't sure where to go; away from the monsters and towards Fitz, or the opposite. The being sitting on the throne let out a deep, earth-quaking rumble. Fitz smiled at me calmly. The creatures slithered by me, but didn't seem interested in me. They surrounded the doctor, but didn't digest him like they had Dana.

They encased him, fusing onto him like metal being welded together. Dr. Fitz changed again, this time more than mentally. His skin became darker, more like that of the thing on the throne. Shifting, yellow eyes littered his body, forming and reforming unceasingly. I could smell the hair and flesh being seared off of him.

Whatever he was now, he was looking at me. He lifted his arm, pointing at me with a gnarled, shifting finger. Tendrils of black ink and bile rushed forward from his outstretched arm and pinned me to the wall by my shoulder. I cried out in pain. The force of the impact had dislocated my it.

The thing that was once Dr. Fitz stared me down with his body of eyes. There was hatred in them—pure, unyielding rage towards not just me, but towards our species as a whole. He was disgusted by what he once was and he yearned to be more than human once again.

My clothes began to smoke and hiss. I felt a slight stinging. Then burning. Then white-hot pain flooded every corner of my mind. My shoulder sizzled and bubbled. My clothes had been burned through, and layers of my skin were following suit.

The feeling is something I don't like to relive. Imagine peeling off individual sticky notes from their stack. But instead of coming off neatly, the layers of my flesh slid away from my bones in an emulsified jelly.

The intensity of the pain didn't stop, but its spreading did. Fitz’s eyes had shifted from me to the entity behind it, still sitting on its throne of shadow and smoke. His tendrils retracted from me and I collapsed to the floor. I could see my own connective tissue struggling to hold my useless arm to my torso. Fitz’s hundred eyes shifted back and forth from me to the enthroned monster.

His voice bubbled out of him, a raspy wheeze burying his old voice,

“Go. Tell them.”

I blacked out. When I came to, I was on the surface again—laying on the obsidian streets of the great city. Using the first aid kit in my bag, I did what I could to save my arm. The place once again seemed abandoned, but that gave me no comfort. After what I had seen, I knew this place only as Hell on Earth. I ran through the streets and out of the city. I went as quickly as I could up the mountain. Even injured, I must have halved our time from the original journey here. I didn't stop until I reached the base.

I rambled to the workers about what had happened, but none of them understood or believed me. They rushed me to the medical center where they, like I had, did what they could with the limited supplies we had. But I would need a real hospital in the near future.

In the end, the loss of the other team members was chalked up to getting lost in the mountains. I was flown back to the country the next day where I was treated at an actual hospital. With time and some skin grafts, they were able to save it.

Months went by and no one would believe my story. So I stopped telling it and life carried on.

I spent a lot of nights wondering about why I had been spared—why that thing took Dr. Fitz’s mind but not mine. Writing this all down, I think I finally have an answer. It didn't take his mind. We weren't important enough for it to even notice us, let alone for it to consciously do something to us. The reason Dr. Fitz went mad and I didn't is simply because he happened to be a smarter insect than me. He was able to understand more than he should have.

I believe he’s still down there with it. Whether he’s studying it or worshipping it, I don’t know. I’ve started seeing him in my dreams, his twisted, morphing body and his thousands of eyes. The words he spoke echo in those dreams—“tell them.” I'm not sure who he meant, but this is my attempt to fulfill his wishes. I don’t want to find out what happens if the thing on the throne is displeased.

Don't go looking for this place. There's nothing there for us but death.
