It started in 2010 I was a boy back then 5 or 7 maybe thats not important here what's important is that mid June night. We lived in a joint family then, my mom and dad slept in the same bed with me I am always in the middle they are overprotective of me. Just when I finally drifted into sleep I saw light I creeped out and jumped out of bed only to realise there was no bed, no room nothing just darkness everywhere.


It took me lots of crying, whining and throwing tantrums to realise there was no one coming to save me I legit thought that I was kidnapped by a devil or dinosaur. I started running I tripped fell and stumbled upon a big black gate it was so black it almost merged with the darkness everywhere.


I opened the door there *klatch* *kluk* a spotlight was upon me it gave me some relief thought the feds arrived or something but that hope was crushed when no one came. I took a few steps and then with a shuddering sound the path lit up but strangely the light didn't reflect on the surroundings it just glowed like someone took pity and showed me the way. I started walking some time passed but it didn't look like it was going to end, the surroundings changed without me realising I was now in a maze there were walls that wasn't visible just pitch dark.


 I started tracing through the area *click* *clack* *click* *clack* the footsteps were getting closer I thought maybe I am saved but it was a kid his head to shoulders were black almost like someone censored it. 
"Hi are you new here?"he said with joy in his voice.
"Yes did you get kidnapped too." I said whimpering
"Well sort or maybe not its like we spawned here dont worry you will wake up if you fulfill your daily objective".
 he said while wearing glasses and a notebook in hand almost like he was an NPC but still humane enough not like the ones in my dads games.


"Let's party up till you get the rules. My name let's say it's Jin and **Rule 1 never tell your name to the players**".

Jin: "**Rule 2 if you see a green light above a player he is a noob, if its red he is a hunter if yellow he is the prey**".

Me:" I am Zee then nice to meet you big bro".

Jin: I am not a bro, well ok I'll be your bro Zee hope that's not your real name. 

Me: it isn't.

Jin: then **Rule 3 beware footsteps** 

**Rule 3 when you are getting promoted don't move**

Me: okay...

*Click click click click click click*

Jin: footsteps run NOW RUN...

I started running it seemed like the footsteps were too fast unusually fast "they are catching up shit Go on Zee i dont like this but we have to split" said Jin.

I didn't like that idea I was scared to my bone Jin pushed me away to the right path he went left I heard screaming I kept running I kept running I didn't stop...
