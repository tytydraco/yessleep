I work night shifts in a near-remote five-star resort. I have worked here for over two years and had recently transferred to the night shift because it paid better. For the past few days, strange things have been happening. Before I start my account on what’s happened over the past four days I’d like to mention that the names of places and people in this post have been changed for privacy reasons. I am in an Asian country (not one of the glamorous ones) but I am not a native. The names you see here have been anglicised.

At around two in the morning, the music in the lobby had turned off for some reason. Ethan went to check, but couldn’t turn it back on. We’d already finished most of the jobs for the night, so I decided to take a drive around the property in the golf cart. The resort was less than half full, so a couple of the buildings had no guests in them.

As I drove past Building 2, which was closed because of the low occupancy, I saw a light on the 5th floor. I decided to check, as I had the master key with me. I got to the fifth floor and checked the room in which I had seen the light in, 2508. The room was empty and dark, and didn’t have a key card inserted into the socket inside, and hence, no electricity. I chalked it up to one of the late night technicians checking something, and went back to my drive.

On my way back, I passed building 2 again, and the light was still on. I went to check again, and same thing. This time though, I opened the door and went inside.  I slid a keycard into the socket and the lights clicked back on. I inspected the room for anything out of the ordinary. Nothing. I took the keycard out. The light stayed on, it took a few seconds for it to turn off. Right before the light flicked off, I saw a figure in the balcony of the room, looking outwards. Confused, I put the key card back in the socket and went to the balcony. Nothing.  I finished up there and went back to the reception. On the way back, the golf cart felt heavier, as if someone was sitting in the back seat. I didn’t mind it as much then.

When I was back the music was back on. I asked Ethan how he managed to fix the speakers, and he shot me a look of confusion. I admit, there’s a language barrier here. Ethan’s English is no better than my command over the local language, so I didn’t think too much of it.

Nothing happened for the rest of the night, I finished up my shift at 08:00 and went to bed at around 08:30.

It was another slow day. I was done with my reports around half past two. I was browsing YouTube shorts on my phone, trying to keep boredom at bay. Usually, I’d listen to horror podcasts or creepypastas during this time, but I didn’t feel like it that day.

As I was scrolling through, I heard footsteps approaching me from the right side. I turned my head to see nothing. I went back to my phone, but the footsteps started again. This continued in a loop for a few minutes. At first, I thought it was Ethan, going in and out from the back office. But Ethan was sitting in one of the couches out front, scrolling on his phone. I decided to investigate. The path on the right led to the retail shop inside the hotel, and after that it extended to Building 2. I checked the shop , and found nothing. I thought of going to Building 2 to check what was happening, but then the phone rang. I walked over back to the front desk, but the ring had cut by the time I reached. I checked the history to see where it was from, and it said Room number 2508. I looked over at Ethan, who was still on his phone. He didn’t seem to have heard the ring. I tried calling back to the room but got no response. A few minutes later, the phone rang again. It was the same room. I picked it up.

“Good Morning, you’re connected to the front desk, How may I assist you?” the words came out by habit.

“Oh.. Hey.. Good Morning.. Can we get a couple of water bottles to the room?” It was a woman’s voice. “We’re in the room – Honey what room are we in? – uh  2508.”

“Of course ma’am. We’ll send them right away.” I hung up the call. I checked the systems to see if there were any guests in 2508. There weren’t. I checked the call history again to check the room number, to see if I had misread it, but I had not. Still confused, I asked Ethan to man the counter while I delivered the water bottles to the room. 

Once I reached building 2, I could see the lights on the fifth floor. I climbed up and rang the doorbell to 2508. A woman opened the door.

“Thank you very much. I’m sorry to be a bother.” She said, it took me a second but I recognised her. She had stayed in the same room two or three weeks ago. She had made a similar call then as well. She must have really liked the room.

After I got back to the front desk I checked the systems once again with her name, which I had fished up from last month’s reports. Strangely enough I found nothing. I made a note for the day shift to follow it up, and went on with my night.

When I came to work for the day, Dani told me that she found no guests in 2508. She worked the afternoon shift that day, and had checked the room herself. It was busy that day, I couldn’t get a breather until five in the morning, and even then, guests started to come check out one by one. At around 05:40, I got a call from 2508 to collect their luggage. I went to the room and rang the doorbell multiple times, only for no one to open the door. I opened the room with my master key card and there was no one there.

I started for the elevator but suddenly I heard sounds of footsteps and luggage rolling behind me. I turned around , and for a split second, I swear I could see myself, rolling three suitcases towards the elevator. I stood there, staring until the ding of the elevator brought me back to my senses. I quickly went down to the golf cart and drove to the lobby. The golf cart was heavy, similar to what had happened a couple of days ago, but it felt much heavier this time. When I reached the front desk, Ethan asked me what was wrong. Apparently I had been sweating like crazy.

Nothing strange happened for the next couple of days, which brings us to today. Today was probably the weirdest of them all, which is why I decided to write this.

It was another slow day. After finishing work,  I defaulted back to my favorite pastime, driving the golf cart around. I paid close attention to building two, but everything seemed normal. We actually had guests occupying several rooms in the building now, but not on the fifth floor. As I was driving through, Ethan called me and told me that a guest had requested a golf cart to building 8. Building 8 was at the other side of the hotel, but I didn’t mind a good drive. When I reached the building, the guests were already at the ground floor waiting for me. They were a sweet old couple, who I had helped check on the previous day.  I parked and helped them get comfortably seated. Then I reversed the car to get back on the path, but I heard a loud thud.

I turned around to check, and the old couple had disappeared. I got out of the cart to check, and realised it was raining heavily. How did I not notice that? Like I couldn’t remember when the rain started, it was just there. I made my way over to the back of the golf cart to see what I’d hit, only to find a child, about four years of age, fallen down and passed out.

To say I panicked is an understatement. I tried to get myself under control and picked the child up. The rain in my eyes didn’t help at all.  He was completely passed out, and I didn’t see anyone else nearby. I laid him down on the front seat of the golf cart. Now completely drenched, I started the golf cart back up. As my foot pressed down on the accelerator, I heard the rain stop, as abrupt as it started.

“Is everything alright Mark?” I heard a familiar voice from the back. I turned to see the old couple I picked up. I looked to my left and where there was the boy, there was now no sign of him. It took me a moment to realise that me, and the surroundings were now completely dry.

“Y-yea I uh.. I thought I hit something.” I said and drove to the front desk. The rest of the night was uneventful.

I woke up around four in the evening to a call from my girlfriend. She had gotten a job in the same area, and was coming over in a week.  I am excited about that. Anyways, I also saw a notification in the employee group chat about an accident. Apparently one of the bellmen hit a young boy while reversing the golf cart at building three. I clicked on the image to get a better look.

It was the same boy I saw last night.

That’s all for now. I have to eat something and get ready for my shift today. It has been a weird couple of days at work, so I thought I’d share it somewhere. It’s pouring right now, which is a pain in the ass for me. I’m out of water, I’ve to go buy some more. Anyways, if you know what the hell is going on in my resort, please let me know. I hope I don’t have to write another one of these.
