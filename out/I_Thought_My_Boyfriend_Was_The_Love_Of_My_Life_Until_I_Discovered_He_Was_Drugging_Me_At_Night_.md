Lately, I’ve been waking up still exhausted. Even if I went to bed early I’d wake up feeling like I haven’t slept in days. 

Trying to get out of bed for work was almost impossible, which was strange for me because I was always a high-energy sort of person. A few hours of sleep and I was always good to go.

I was at a loss as to what was happening. After a barrage of tests, even my doctor couldn’t find anything wrong with me. 

The only recent change in my life was my boyfriend who had moved in and I was sharing a bed for the first time in my life. 

Stephen was the first love of my life and this was my first serious relationship. I didn’t want to spoil things by making him sleep in the spare room. 

I liked having Stephen around. He made a real fuss over me and he would me camomile tea every night before bed. 

The pain in my hip was sharp and pulsated up the right side of my body.  I jumped from my bed and nearly collapsed to the floor as I struggled to get to the bathroom. 

“Stephen, can you get in here,” I cried. 

A big dark bruise covered my hip, as If I was assaulted in my sleep with a metal bar. 

“What’s wrong,” Stephen said as he came rushing into the bathroom. 

“Did I fall out of bed or something?”

Stephen had a weird expression on his face. I could swear he looked guilty about something.

“Probably, I don’t know.” 

His response was dismissive which sent my brain spiralling with all sorts of thoughts. 

“This is not normal, Stephen. I think there’s something wrong with me.” 

“You should probably see a doctor then,” he coldly said before quickly leaving the bathroom. 

My doctor was still at a loss and suggested I should see someone who could rule out anything nefarious. 

Stephen was still dismissive of me as we drove to the hospital.

“I’m sure it’s nothing. You're probably just stressed from work.”

People don’t wake up with bruises, over stress,” I angrily thought to myself.  

The doctor at the hospital took my blood and did all sorts of tests on me including a stress test. 

I should have been happy when the tests came back clear, but it only made me feel like I was losing my mind. Something was definitely wrong with me.   

“I would prescribe you sedatives, but your blood work shows you are already on nitrazepam,” explained the doctor.

I was dumbstruck and wasn’t sure what the doctor was talking about. 

“ I have never taken so much as a painkiller in my life.” 

The doctor's face looked how I felt. 

He took out his charts and looked over them again. 

“No, you definitely tested positive for nitrazepam which is a powerful sedative.” 

Later that evening as I sat in bed a million different thoughts ran through my head. “How was that even possible,” I thought to myself. 

As I sat there Stephen walked in with my camomile tea, and just as I was about to put it to my lips I was struck by the most unnerving thought. The realization that my boyfriend was drugging me hit me like a ton of bricks and filled me with a dread I had never felt before. 

I emptied the contents of the cup down the sink in the bathroom before jumping back into bed. 

“Was it hot enough for you,” asked Stephen as he jumped into bed beside me. 

“Perfect as always.”

I felt as if I was lying beside a complete stranger. “Had I ever really known him,” I thought to myself as I lay there terrified he was doing unimaginable things to me while I slept. 

I must have drifted off at some stage because when I woke up the room was a mess and Stephen was nowhere to be seen. My body ached all over, and it felt like I was in a fight. 

“What the hell was he doing to me in my sleep,” I thought. I had made the decision to go to the police but I needed evidence, or it was just my word against his. 

I had purchased a hidden camera and set it up in the bedroom, pointing it towards the bed. 

I woke up exhausted as usual, which unfortunately meant you had done something to me while I slept, but I had it on camera. 

I opened my laptop to check the footage. For the first couple of hours of sleep, nothing happened. For a moment I had hoped I was imagining everything until I watched myself Jolt from the bed. 

At first, I couldn’t believe what I was doing. It felt like I was watching a horror movie as I watched myself crawl up the bedroom wall like some possessed demon. I continued to crawl up the wall onto the ceiling looking down over Stephen like I was ready to pounce on him. 

Stephen woke and it was strange watching him because it was like he was prepared for what was happening and didn’t seem fazed by it. He took a stick out from under the bed as I pounced from the ceiling above and he spent the next hour fighting me off. 

I watched as he subdued me on the bed before pulling out handcuffs and cuffing me to the bed. 

I looked at the marks on my wrists which made sense now. 

As soon as Stephen came home from work I ran and threw my arms around him. “Why didn’t you tell me what you were going through every night.”

Stephen shrugged his shoulders.

“I thought you knew, and usually the drugs I was giving made things a little easier.”

“Why are you even still with me?”

“My last girlfriend was a jealous psychopath. You’re a walk in the park compared to her,”
