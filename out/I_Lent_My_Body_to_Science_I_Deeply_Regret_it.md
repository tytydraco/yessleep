The windows were boarded up with rotting wood, the big decorative tooth that used to hang above the front door was long stolen and the wiring in the hall had been yanked out leaving jagged scars across the entryway. The old building was systematically stripped of all history and value until it was just a concrete husk of better times.

The only thing that still remained was the dentist’s chair. It sat in the middle of the room, surrounded by makeshift lights plugged into a generator that hummed impatiently in an adjacent room. After a brief questionnaire, I was asked to sit. Bits of flaking upholstery from the chair clung to my arms like depressed glitter.

Neither of the scientists introduced themselves. All I had to go off of were the nametags on their lab coats. Dr. Barat seemed to be no older than forty, but his face was wrinkled like that of an old man. He had a mop of dark unkempt hair and conducted our interview in a similarly disorganized fashion. He asked many of the questions multiple times and seemed frustrated at any amount of pause I took before my answers. As I spoke, one of his eyes kept on drifting towards the unlit corners of the room, as if someone were judging his performance.

Dr. Alieva, a stout stern-faced woman of about sixty, spent the initial part of the interview in complete silence. As I answered Dr. Barat’s repetitive questions about my medical history, she stood by one of the blinding light towers at the far end of the room. It was only once Dr. Barat asked me to sit down in the dentist’s chair that I heard her speak.

‘Strong specimen,’ she told Dr. Barat when he went to confer with her. ‘This is acceptable.’

Once I was sat in the chair, Dr. Barat drew my blood, took a saliva sample and then, with complete disinterest, checked my teeth. He didn’t seem to know what he was looking for and approached the inspection with the gentleness of trying to fish one’s keys out of their pocket. When Dr. Barat was done digging around in my mouth he asked if I had any dentistry work done; fillings, extractions, things of that nature.

With some amount of pride, I told him my teeth have always been in perfect health. My answer moved none of the wrinkles on Dr. Barat’s face, yet it seemingly pleased Dr. Alieva.

‘Good,’ she said from the edge of the room. ‘Scan him.’

The machine that Dr. Barat brought out fit over my head like a helmet. It was heavy and carried within its confines a sharp smell of disinfectant. Neither Dr. Barat nor Dr. Alieva inspired any confidence, I was uncomfortable all throughout our interaction, yet it wasn’t until the helmet was on my head that panic seized me.

My ears filled with a shrill sound that echoed dial up internet. A blinding green light passed across my face, twice. Had it passed a third time, I would have ripped the headpiece off, but instead the light went dark.

Soon, Dr. Barat was taking off the helmet and offering me napkins to dry my face.

Soon, Dr. Alieva was handing me an envelope filled with money.

Neither of the scientists thanked me for participating in their study. Dr. Barat just lead me through the stripped hallways, walked me to the door and reminded me that if I told anyone about being paid for my contributions to science, my earnings would be subject to a national research tax.

The sunlight and reasonably fresh air lifted my spirits. No longer fearing meeting my end in an abandoned dentist’s office I even found a trace of humor. With a wink and a smile, I told Dr. Barat I don’t recall partaking in any study.

He did not find my joke funny.

The initial invitation to be a part of the research project came to me in the form of a flier glued to a rusty lamp post. Aside from the address and the promise of payment there was scarcely any information about the nature of the research. My head was buzzing with questions on my way home, but by the time I locked the door and counted the money in the envelope they were washed out with bliss.

The money I got paid to be ‘scanned’ wouldn’t amount to much in the West, but it was a boon in my corner of the globe. I still didn’t know what sort of scientific pursuits I had aided, but I did know I was paid enough to satiate my landlord and keep my belly full for a couple of months.

For about two weeks after the ‘scan’ I found my tongue going numb from time to time, but I didn’t make much of it. The pay from the experiment was good enough to not worry about slight discomforts.

I hoped that I would find some steady employment in those months of leeway, that as long as my bout of unemployment was it would come to an end eventually. It didn’t. No steady source of income presented itself and week by week I was finding myself slipping into a dire financial situation once more.

Kurban and I used to build sandcastles together on the playground when we were children. Our friendship had waned since the days of grade school, but I still kept in touch with the man through social media. Kurban’s financial situation was not much better than mine, but every couple of months he would be tasked with recruiting labor for under-the-table construction work. When I saw him post up a call for twelve men to join him for a project I didn’t hesitate.

I needed the cash. An invitation to the sites which Kurban organized never came with any additional details but what Kurban lacked in information he made up for in cash. Usually, tools would be provided by our employers. As I left the house, however, I grabbed a hammer I inherited after my grandfather passed. The tool was worn and nearing the end of its usefulness but having it in my jacket made me feel safe.

I considered it more of a good luck charm than anything else.

The crew gathered in a parking lot at the edge of the city early the next morning. Judging from the faces around me, I could tell that none of us were having a good year. We were all eager to get to work and get paid, yet when our means of transportation arrived the resolve of the group faltered.

A gray transport truck coughed its way into the parking lot. The driver wore a faded leather jacket and had a scar on his face that turned his right eye milky. He unlocked the back of the truck and, without any introduction or pleasantries, ordered the construction crew to get in.

The man with the scar carried himself with the sort of bravado that made connections to organized crime a certainty. Some of the workers didn’t like that. When they tried to leave, however, Kurban eased their qualms.

The job, much like every other construction job he ever offered, existed in a legal gray area. It paid so accordingly. Whatever worries they had would be forgotten by sundown when they were walking back home with an envelope full of bills.

I have worked my fair share of shady jobs and had little worry about the man in the truck, but I was impressed by how quickly Kurban soothed the resolve of some of the more nervous workers. Within less than a minute even the most vocal of Kurban’s detractors were calmly sitting in the back of the truck. They worried about the gruff driver and the cryptic nature of the construction project but Kurban eased those worries with just a few sentences. The man had a way with words.

Little did we know that by getting into the truck we had passed a point of no return.

The forty-minute drive in the back of the truck was kept lively by stories and song. Not long after we had set out, one of the workers produced a flask of homemade moonshine that was passed around the group. On the first round Kurban partook himself, but by the time the canteen of jet fuel made its second lap around the group, he suggested the drink be put away. A bit of alcohol was good for the soul, but too much would make us careless and clumsy.

When the door of the truck finally opened the group once again found themselves troubled. We were dropped off at the edge of a dirt path leading through a forest. Two guards wearing military fatigues and riot helmets which obscured their faces flanked the construction crew. The driver of the truck did all the talking.

Casually, as he chewed on a hand-rolled cigarette, he told us that we were to travel to the construction site in the company of our escort. When some of the men protested these strange conditions, the driver simply shrugged and suggested that they shouldn’t have gotten on the truck to begin with.

Kurban, once again, spoke to the group. I must admit that even I was uncomfortable with the presence of the armed men, yet Kurban put my mind at ease. He himself only knew that we were hired to replace a set of stairs. The money, however, was well worth it. He laughed at the prospect of the job being dangerous and, softly, a couple of the men laughed with him.

Kurban’s words had calmed the group but the merriment that we felt in the back of the truck never returned. The guards were silent and only used their rifles to communicate the desired direction of our march.

We walked through the forest for what felt like an hour before the trees started to change. At first, the wood around us was healthy and lush, yet the further into the forest we got the sicklier our surroundings grew. I had scarcely noticed this change of scenery when the man walking in front of me started to panic.

At first his discomfort presented itself through barely audible mumbles but the further we walked, the more barren the land around us turned — the louder the terrified man became. What started off as a whisper soon turned into raving madness.

The man was screaming about the Ғылыми қондырғы.

I had heard of the place before, mainly through stories told to me when I was a young boy. The Ғылыми қондырғы was a place of unspeakable horrors, a corner of the globe where history did not pass and where experiments which taunted God were conducted. As a young boy I believed in these tales. When my uncle threatened to send me to the Ғылыми қондырғы if I did not behave, I would immediately rectify my ways. Whenever that horrible place was mentioned, I, without question, cleaned my room and did my chores and washed behind my ears.

As a child there was nothing scarier to me than the Ғылыми қондырғы yet as I grew taller and found hair sprouting on my chin, I lost all trace of that fear. To me, the Ғылыми қондырғы became a fabulation, an old wives’ tale told to keep children obedient. Occasionally, I would hear the horrid name whispered in pubs or around the barrel fires where the homeless congregated but by then I considered belief in the existence of the Ғылыми қондырғы to just be a cruel byproduct of alcoholism.

I was certain that the Ғылыми қондырғы did not exist, yet watching the man in front of me be brought to tears by the mere thought of being taken there gave me pause. The grown man wept, screaming to the heavens that we were being taken to a place from which none return.

Our faceless chaperones did not like the panicked man screaming that horrid name. Neither did anyone else in the construction crew. Kurban attempted to calm the man as we walked, but even his silver tongue could not ease the tension. When words did not work, Kurban finally seized the man by the shoulders and shook him.

This, for a mere moment, seemed to calm the panicked soul. The man apologized to Kurban, the rest of the work crew and even the guards. Instead of continuing down the path, however, the man dropped to his knees and started to busy himself with the cold earth below. He lay prostrate for a moment, but then, with deadly swiftness he rose to his feet and leaped at one of the guards.

Armed with a fist-sized stone the man managed to crack the glass of the guard’s helmet. That is all he managed. The guards were both strong specimens, within seconds the panicked man was lying on his back and being pummeled with their fists. Were it not for Kurban’s interjection, the man would have been beaten to death.

Kurban managed to calm the guards with promises of obedience, yet they spoke nothing in return. They simply lifted the bloodied worker by his arms, pushed him back into the file and motioned with their rifles for us to continue our walk. The sudden burst of violence had made me grip the hammer in my jacket, but something else quickly seized my attention.

Only a part of the visor was missing, but a part of the guard’s face was visible.

The face was hauntingly familiar.

As we walked, the trees that towered above us became bare and frail. With each step towards our destination the forest grew sicklier until it finally gave way to a wide-open plane.

The bloodied worker in front of me groaned in discomfort.

At the center of the dead clearing sat a cement shack. Before it stood two more armed guards of similar stature. A couple meters from the shack was a perfectly circular moat of foul-smelling water with a singular board of wood for crossing. It was as if whatever disease had spread through the forest had originated from the moat. Even the earth beneath our feet lost color and turned into fine gray sand as we approached the horrid smelling water.

Our environs were beyond inhospitable, yet as we walked towards the cement shack, I kept my eyes on the guard’s broken visor. I was scared of the prospect of our destination but what scared me so much more, what terrified me to my very core, was the guard’s face.

It was so hauntingly familiar.

At the entrance of the cement shack, another familiar face presented itself. With disheveled hair and visible irritation, Dr. Barat greeted the construction crew. The scientist began to detail the construction project we were summoned for. Apparently, we would take an elevator underground into a scientific compound where we would be tasked with replacing a set of metal stairs that had collapsed. Dr. Barat started to explain how the construction would have to be kept completely secret, until he suddenly went silent.

He stared at the bloodied man and demanded an explanation.

Dr. Barat aimed his questions at the guards, but they did not speak. Kurban, with the slightest tinge of nerves in his smooth voice, explained the situation — one of the men had simply had a nervous episode through the forest, the unprofessional behavior would not repeat. The bloodied worker let out another pained grunt, as if in agreement.

Dr. Barat scarcely paid any attention to the injured worker or to Kurban. His focus was solely on the two guards that accompanied us through the walk. He viewed them with absolute disdain. Halfway through Kurban’s peacekeeping explanation Dr. Barat simply sighed and waved us into the cement shack.

The scientist’s one good eye stayed glued to the masked guards, yet as I passed him, he ordered the group to stop. He recognized me. Dr. Barat recognized me and he was not pleased.

He held out his arm to stop me but struggled to come up with words. Finally, he mumbled something about how I should have stayed at home and waved the rest of the crew towards the cement shack.

When Kurban saw I was left behind, he cautiously stepped back to Dr. Barat and attempted to speak to him. The scientist waved him off and told him to follow the rest of the crew to the elevator. Kurban looked like he was about to make another attempt at finding out what would happen to me but after one look at the rifles the guards carried, he changed his mind.

The rusted doors of the cement shack shut and I was left alone with the scientist and his quartet of armed guards. Dr. Barat stared at me for a while, at a loss for words. Finally, he mumbled something beneath his breath and grabbed the nearest guard by the hand. The scientist dragged the guard a couple meters away from me as if he were a petulant child and then, after pulling the guard down by the shoulder to his eye level — he spoke.

The scientist was too far away from me to hear, but he enunciated each word as if he were speaking for a child.

The guard the scientist had selected was the one with the broken visor. As Dr. Barat spoke to the man, I could see the guard’s jaw open and close, as if mimicking his superior’s words. As I watched, I found my own lips moving.

‘Do you understand?’ Dr. Barat asked, once he finished his explanation. He spoke as if he were speaking to a seven-year-old with brain trauma. ‘Can you follow instructions?’

In response, the guard let out a grunt.

This seemed to both disgust and satiate the scientist.

‘On behalf of The United People’s Institute of Science, I apologize.’ His eyes shifted to me and his speech attained the pattern of speaking to an intellectual equal. ‘You should not have been allowed to get this close to the facility. There have been changes in leadership roles recently, you see. It is no excuse though; you have our sincerest apologies.’

Before I had a chance to make sense what the scientist was talking about, I was shoved towards the moat by the guard with the broken visor. He motioned towards the plank with his rifle.

I didn’t argue.

I walked across the plank and tried to convince myself that the guard would simply lead me back to the edge of the road and send me on my way. Those thoughts, however, didn’t stick. In my jacket pocket, my knuckles ached.

A few short steps from the plank I was shoved to the ground and put on my knees. Before I even had a chance to look behind me, I heard Dr. Barat’s furious voice.

‘You moron! Not here! Not in front of the facility!’ he screamed from the cement shack. ‘The woods! I said take him to the woods!’

The guard had his rifle out. He had it pointed square at the back of my head. Dr. Barat’s shouts, however, had dissuaded him from pulling the trigger. With the tip of the rifle the guard motioned me to get up.

Once I did, he shoved me towards the forest.

By then I had no illusions about what Dr. Barat was apologizing for. Initially, in a burst of adrenalin and instinct, I wanted to swing at the guard and try to wrestle away his rifle. Yet there was only one of me and the guard had three armed colleagues within sight. I had little faith in subduing the man on my own as well.

I’m a big guy, but the guard was just as big.

Instead of fighting back and getting shot, I spoke to the guard. I asked for him to let me go and promised I would never tell a soul. I spoke of my childhood and struggles and the cat I had waiting for me back home. The guard was deaf to all my attempts for eliciting sympathy. When I slowed down my pace to buy time, he would prod me forward with the muzzle of his rifle.

We passed the dead earth and sickly trees and soon enough the forest was green once more. It wasn’t far from the spot where the worker struck the guard that he stopped me again. He grabbed my shoulder this time. With a firm grip he forced me to my knees.

I tried to wrestle the guard to the ground, but just ended up falling on my ass. The guard took two steps back and raised his rifle. He didn’t shoot though. He kept pointing with the tip of his rifle as if he wanted me to turn around.

He wasn’t comfortable seeing my face.

Babbling in fear, I begged for the guard to raise his broken visor. He continued pointing for me to turn around but his lips moved along with mine. The wider my mouth would move the lower his jaw would drop. I quickly realized the reason for the familiar man’s silence — he had no tongue.

A panicked memory of the scientist shot through my skull and I elected a change in tactics.

With clear enunciation, as if I was speaking to a child, I ordered the guard to lift his visor. I had to repeat the order three or four times, but eventually, the man relented. With a discomforting swiftness he moved his left hand from his rifle to his visor and back.

Completely void of emotion, yet strangely full of life — I saw a familiar face.

I saw my own face.

Memories of a blinding green light passing across my face twice, but not thrice, filled my heart. I begged for an explanation. Once in all earnestness and then for uncountable times as if I was speaking to an infant. None of it worked. The guard simply stared at me and pointed with the tip of his rifle for me to turn around. When I tried to get off the ground, he pulled the trigger. Next to me, kindling shot off the side of a tree.

The motions of his rifle were becoming more aggressive. I feared that the guard would not wait for me to turn around to take another shot. I had to act.

The visor was still up, but I had never been much of a marksman. My aim worried me, but what worried me much more were the eyes staring back at me. They were completely void of emotion but I had seen them in the mirror far too many times. I feared they would make my aim waver.

They didn’t.

The hammer hit the familiar man straight in the nose. When he went down, he dropped his rifle. I kicked the weapon away and, while the familiar man was still reeling from the hit, I killed him with the hammer.

It’s been years since conscription but I grabbed the rifle regardless. I feared that there would be more guards hiding in the woods, also bearing my face, waiting to stop me from getting away.

There weren’t.

I ran until I could breathe no more. With far off sounds of cars coming from behind the forest, I shed the rifle. Running around with a semi-automatic would attract far too much attention. The air was frigid and burnt in my heaving lungs, but I shed my jacket as well. It was drenched in blood.

I was certain I would call the authorities when I got home, but once I had the phone in my hand, I was less certain. Whoever had access to military grade weaponry and the sort of science that could clone a man would also have sway over our impoverished police department. I’ve tried contacting Kurban for an explanation, or at least for assurances that he made it out of that strange place alive — yet it’s been two days and I have heard nothing.

I fear for Kurban and for the rest of the construction crew, but what I fear the most is the consequences of that afternoon I spent in the abandoned dentist’s office. I had not seen beneath the visors of the other guards, but they too were tall and unable to speak. I fear that the clone that I killed was not the only one out [there](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/q2qjz1/%D2%93%D1%8B%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%BC%D0%B8_%D2%9B%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B%D1%80%D2%93%D1%8B/).
