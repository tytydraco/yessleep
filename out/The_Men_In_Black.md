you may remember them from a movie. well what you dont know is, the movie was based off a true story. yes, this is about the MIB. they have been around since before you can remember. i shouldnt share this with you, but i am. there has been many sightings of the men in black, but here is my own experience.

this world is more interesting than you may think. you may say, ''there are no such things as aliens or ghosts,'' but you would be wrong. the movie was trying to warn us. they were telling us there are higher powers. if you recall, at the end of one of the movies, there is shown an advanced alien race bigger and smarter than us just outside a locker door. 

my goal is to warn you if you find anything unusual.

i was at home watching tv at about twelve o'clock. i heard something coming from another room. it was in my room. i investigated and found it was coming from under my bed. i looked and you wouldnt beleive what i saw. it was some big furry thing with elftype ears and his body looked wide, the fur was orange. i was scared to death and went to get a broom to wack it from a long distance. i didnt know what it was, and i had no idea who to call. i called my friend so he could come over and we just sweeped it into the bathroom and shut the door. i soon saw something outside. it was a car not like mine or my friend's. i saw men dressed in black suits come from it. they knocked on the door but we didnt answer. they knocked a few more times but we just hid in my room. i then heard a loud noise come from the door, like some type of loud revving up then an explosion. we were terrified. we heard footsteps getting closer and closer until a man shot down my door and entered. he showed us a small silver stick and then it flashed a bright blue beam, and then he told a story of what he wanted us to think happened while the other man was going to collect the creature. I somehow didn't get effected in the memory wipe process but I think that's because i covered my eyes. i think the reason he didn't notice was because he happened to be looking at my friend who was a few feet away from me.

while he was telling the story i acted as though i was effected. (i see its worth mentioning the reason my friend didnt close his eyes is because the man did it too quick for my slow friend to react.) they left and replaced the doors with some sort of time gun that reverses the destruction. i told my friend about it multiple times but he doesnt beleive me. 

i personally think the reason they knew my location is either they knew activity was happening or they noticed my phone call was about mysterious action that needed to be contained.

the men in black are real.
