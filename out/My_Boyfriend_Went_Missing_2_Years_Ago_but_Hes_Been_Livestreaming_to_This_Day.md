Two years ago, Nathan disappeared. No note, no sign, no warning. He left for work one chilly February morning and never came home. For weeks, I held onto hope, obsessively calling his phone, refreshing his social media accounts, and walking the streets near his usual routes. The police assured me they were investigating, but as the months dragged on, it was clear they had nothing to go on.

Nathan was simply gone.

That’s what I believed until last week when I received a text from my friend Clara.

“Isn’t this Nathan?” she asked, attaching a screenshot. My heart dropped as I stared at the image. It was a livestream—grainy but unmistakable. Nathan’s face stared back at me.

The livestream was hosted on an obscure platform called FlickStream, one I’d never heard of before. The stream’s title read: “Nightlife With Nate.”

Clara was right. It was him—same dark hair, same crooked smile, same mole near his temple. The background was stark and unfamiliar, a dimly lit room with blank walls. He was speaking, but the screenshot didn’t capture any audio.

I clicked the link.

The stream was live.

The First Encounter

Nathan sat at a table, a microphone positioned in front of him. He was talking about something mundane—his thoughts on movies, music, and food. It felt oddly casual, like a podcast, but there was no audience interaction. No chat. No likes.

“Nathan,” I whispered, my fingers trembling as I typed in the stream’s chat box.

“Nathan, where are you? It’s me, Emily.”

He didn’t respond. He didn’t even glance at the chat. Instead, he continued talking as though nothing had happened.

My heart raced. Could it be a pre-recorded video? But why would someone livestream old footage of Nathan? And who would even have it?

The stream abruptly ended after exactly 42 minutes. No goodbye. No fade-out. Just static.

I sat in silence, staring at my laptop screen. It felt like the ground beneath me had shifted.

Digging Deeper

The next day, I dove into FlickStream. The platform was an eerie corner of the internet—far removed from mainstream sites like YouTube or Twitch. It catered to niche content creators, many of whom seemed more interested in shock value than substance.

Nathan’s channel had been active for the past two years. The livestreams occurred every night at precisely 8:00 p.m. Each video followed the same format: Nathan sitting in that same dimly lit room, rambling about random topics for 42 minutes.

The videos had no comments, no likes, and no apparent followers—aside from me.

I downloaded several streams and analyzed them. His speech patterns were normal, his gestures natural. It was undoubtedly Nathan. But something was off. His eyes lacked their usual warmth, and his voice carried an odd flatness, like he was reading from a script.

Then I noticed something chilling: the timestamps.

In one video, Nathan talked about a movie that had been released six months after his disappearance. In another, he discussed a news event that occurred just last week.

This wasn’t old footage. This was current.

Seeking Help

I took the evidence to the police. Detective Alvarez, the lead on Nathan’s missing person case, listened patiently but was skeptical.

“Ms. Wright, livestreams can be manipulated,” he said. “Deepfake technology is advanced these days. It’s possible someone is using Nathan’s likeness.”

“But why?” I demanded. “What’s the point?”

He shrugged. “It could be a prank or someone trying to mess with you. We’ll look into it, but I suggest you don’t engage with the channel.”

Unsatisfied, I turned to Clara for help. She was a tech whiz, and if anyone could uncover the truth, it was her.

We spent hours scouring FlickStream, trying to trace the source of the broadcasts. The streams were routed through multiple VPNs, making it nearly impossible to pinpoint their origin. But Clara discovered something disturbing:

The metadata for Nathan’s videos indicated they were uploaded from a device registered to his name.

“How is that possible?” I asked, my voice shaking.

“I don’t know,” Clara admitted. “But whoever’s doing this has access to his personal accounts.”

The Livestream Escalates

The next night, I tuned in at 8:00 p.m. sharp. This time, the stream was different. Nathan wasn’t sitting at the table. Instead, the camera was positioned in a hallway, its walls lined with faded wallpaper. The lighting was dim, casting long shadows.

Nathan’s voice echoed faintly, but he was nowhere to be seen.

“Nathan?” I typed in the chat.

No response.

The camera slowly panned down the hallway, stopping in front of a door. A low creak filled the air as the door opened, revealing a staircase leading down into darkness. The stream cut off.

I stared at the blank screen, my chest tightening with dread.

The House

Desperate for answers, I revisited Nathan’s case files. Buried among the documents was an address—a cabin he had rented for a weekend getaway shortly before his disappearance. It was located in a remote area, hours away from the city.

Clara insisted on coming with me. Armed with flashlights, a crowbar, and a portable hotspot to stream the trip, we set out early the next morning.

The cabin was decrepit and abandoned, its windows boarded up. Inside, dust coated every surface, and the air smelled of mildew.

In the living room, we found a laptop. It was old and covered in grime, but when Clara booted it up, it worked.

The desktop background was a photo of Nathan and me, smiling at a summer barbecue. My throat tightened.

Clara navigated to the hard drive and found a folder labeled “Broadcasts.” Inside were hundreds of files, each corresponding to a past livestream.

“This is it,” she whispered.

But as she clicked on one of the files, the screen froze. The laptop emitted a high-pitched whine before abruptly shutting off.

“What the hell?” Clara muttered, jiggling the power button.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed. It was a notification from FlickStream.

Nathan’s livestream is starting now.

The Basement

We followed the weak signal from my phone’s stream, which led us to a door in the cabin’s kitchen. The door opened to a narrow staircase descending into the earth.

The air grew colder with every step. At the bottom, we found a small, windowless room.

The setup was simple: a desk, a chair, and a webcam pointed at the center of the room. A microphone rested on the desk, connected to a tangled mess of wires.

In the corner of the room was a pile of clothing. Nathan’s clothing.

My legs gave out, and I collapsed to my knees.

Clara nudged me. “Emily, look.”

She pointed to the webcam, which was recording. The light on the camera blinked, signaling it was live.

On my phone, Nathan’s livestream showed the same room we were standing in.

But Nathan wasn’t there.

Suddenly, the door at the top of the stairs slammed shut.

The Truth

A voice crackled through the speakers connected to the webcam.

“You shouldn’t have come here.”

It wasn’t Nathan’s voice. It was deep, distorted, and mechanical.

“Who are you?” Clara shouted, her voice trembling.

“You wanted to see Nathan. You’ve seen him. Now leave.”

“What did you do to him?” I screamed.

The voice laughed—a cold, hollow sound. “Nathan isn’t here anymore. But his image? His voice? That’s mine to use.”

Clara frantically worked to disconnect the webcam, but every attempt was met with resistance. The wires were tangled and fused, as though they were part of the room itself.

Then, the stream on my phone changed. The camera showed the hallway from the previous night’s broadcast. But this time, Nathan stood at the end, his face blank and expressionless.

He raised a hand and pointed directly at the camera. At us.

The lights in the basement flickered. The air grew heavy, suffocating. The walls seemed to close in, their surfaces warping and pulsing.

“We need to get out of here,” Clara said, grabbing my arm.

We sprinted up the stairs and slammed against the door, which refused to budge. Behind us, the mechanical voice grew louder, repeating the same phrase:

“You shouldn’t have come here.”

Escape

Clara used the crowbar to force the door open. We stumbled out into the daylight, gasping for air.

The cabin was silent, as though the events in the basement had never happened. But my phone continued streaming.

On the screen, Nathan was still in the hallway, his face filling the frame.

He whispered one word: “Help.”

Then the stream ended.

Aftermath

We reported everything to the police, but when they searched the cabin, the basement was gone. The staircase led to solid earth, as if it had never existed.

Nathan’s livestreams stopped after that day. FlickStream deleted his channel, citing a violation of their terms of service.

But I still see him.

In the shadows of my apartment. Reflected in mirrors. Always staring. Always silent.

Nathan may be gone, but something else took his place. And it’s still watching.
