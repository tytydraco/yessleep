Do you put stock in dreams?

Do they truly mean something, or are they just our minds conjuring fragments from the scattered information that bombards us when we sleep?

I never believed dreams meant anything more than my mind forging a story from the brief memories of the day and mixing in an innate emotion of fear, love, or comedy. I knew this was the rational answer, the less mystical one.

But now I see they can mean something else entirely.

\*\*\*

When I got the diagnosis, I didn’t know what to feel. One moment I was running and the next I was gasping as my whole body went numb, like it was rebelling against me. The doctors called it dilated cardiomyopathy, a failure of the heart’s major chamber. It’s idiopathic and can happen to anyone, they said, with no rhyme or reason. I remember staring at them and wondering if that was supposed to make me feel better. As if randomness was a comfort.

They told me I had maybe a few years if I was lucky, a few weeks if I wasn’t. I kept nodding, pretending I understood, pretending I cared about their timelines and percentages. It all felt like bullshit anyway. Numbers meant nothing when you were the one they were being pinned to.

I went home with documents full of instructions and warnings I barely read. All at once, my body felt like a borrowed thing, fragile in a way I had never considered before. Every heartbeat felt too heavy, like it was struggling under the weight of its own responsibility. I found myself lying awake at night, listening to it, wondering which beat might be the last clean one before everything fell apart.

When they placed me on the transplant list, that was the moment it became real. Not when the doctor said the word failure, but when they handed me a form that quietly admitted I could not be saved by anything other than someone else’s heart. I tried to tell myself that being on the list meant I had a chance, but the truth settled in quickly. A list is just a waiting room for the dying.

It wasn’t long after that, somewhere between resignation and panic, that I ended up having one of those slow, existential conversations with my friend Rachel. Her twin sister, Beck, chimed in over speakerphone, the two of them volleying concern the way only siblings can. They were the ones who nudged me toward alternatives, anything that didn’t involve sitting still and waiting to die.

In that numbed state of acceptance or defiance, I threw myself into searching for alternatives. I scrolled past the usual mystical heal-all remedies and bizarre esoteric rituals, even a few articles rambling about “cellular memory” and how a donor’s traits could somehow cling to their organs. I didn’t believe any of it, of course. I was just desperate enough to read it.

That was when I stumbled on a private startup surgical company that specialised in transplants.

 It felt impossible that such a highly niche practice existed within travelling distance of my home. The reviews claimed almost perfect satisfaction, with waiting times measured in weeks and rejection rates below 0.1%. They boasted top surgeons and outcomes that seemed almost unrealistic.

The more I looked, the more I caught myself lingering on the smallest spark of hope, even if it was fleeting. I compared their wait times against mine. I compared their cost against my life. It did not take long before the numbers began to weigh in their favour.

Twelve hours of driving, another three hours of waiting, and I finally met the clinic’s doctors to discuss how this would all work. A spark of anxiety hit me as I stepped into the doctor’s office. The pleasantries were brief, and the doctor went straight into it.

“Mr. Thomas Sallow, age 28. Blood type AB positive. Dilated cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular ejection fraction at twenty percent. NYHA class three. Life expectancy, optimistically, two years. No medical insurance.” He put the papers down and steepled his fingers. “You are, a very typical case. But we will ensure you will get what you need efficiently and safely.”

I swallowed hard, my mouth dry. “And… what are the next steps?”

He gave a small nod. “We perform a full pre-transplant evaluation. Blood panels, imaging, psychosocial screening, infectious disease checks. We need to know you are stable enough for surgery, and that post-operatively you can adhere to treatment. Once complete, a suitable organ can be matched within two weeks. Our success rates are excellent. Post op survival is above ninety-nine percent.”

My eyes widened at that. I almost asked how many patients but stopped myself. “How is it so high while being so fast?” I asked instead.

“We’ve optimised every stage. From evaluation to surgery, there is no delay. Our protocols are designed to minimise waiting time without compromising quality. We work with the right team who get what we need. That is how we maintain high success despite the speed.”

I hesitated. “And the cost?”

“As you have no insurance, we do offer arrangements, of course. We have simple payment plans that can fit into anyone’s budget, especially in cases like yours. This is a premium service you must understand. As you’ve heard, you would not be waiting months or years for a false promise.”

I tried to digest it. The figures, the timelines, the detached calm with which he described my own failing heart. Somehow, hearing him speak, knowing someone could fix this, I felt hope.

“And the procedure itself?” I asked.

“Standard transplant surgery,” he said, as if discussing an everyday office visit. “We remove what is failing, we replace it with what is functional. Routine monitoring and standard recovery follows. Nothing to worry about. You will be in good hands. We service dozens like you every month.”

I nodded again, my pulse uneven, my chest tight.

The papers were signed, my details exchanged, and the pre-tests performed quickly, the only discomfort coming from the blood they drew. As I went to the receptionist to finalise everything, she handed me a bottle of pills.

“Take twice a day, once before sleep and once at midday.”

“What is this?”

“These are a new compound to ensure high comparability with your new transplant. Please see the instructions for more information. Have a good day.”

I left the office with the paperwork in hand, the instructions tucked under my arm, and the strange sense that I had just stepped across the threshold into something I could not yet name. But the hope began to burn bright, and for the first time in weeks, I let myself believe I might survive.

That night, I dreamt of pain.

A heartbeat woke me. My pulse thrashed in my head, forcing consciousness into me like someone dragging me upward by the skull. Faintness mixed with a rising, primal fear kept me aware, that something was very wrong. My heart hammered, not fast, but heavy, like each beat was trying to break through bone.

I breathed in air that felt moist. It clung to the inside of my throat, thick and warm, filling my lungs with something that tasted wrong. Acrid, chemical, metallic. Like breathing in heated oil fumes.

My body felt feverish, the heat rolling under my skin in waves that made my nerves twitch and curl. Pain threaded through every part of me like my insides were bruising with each breath.

My vision blurred, as if my eyes had been closed for days and were only now remembering the idea of light. Shapes smeared into each other. Colours bled. And through it, against the far wall, I saw something. A texture. Wet. Sinewy. Hugging the surface like it had grown there instead of being placed.

Something red. Something raw.

I jerked awake in a chill so violent it almost hurt. Fear crawled cold through my body, the kind that didn’t fade once the room came into focus.

I wished it had been the only time. But night after night, my mind returned to the same dream, as if whatever I’d seen was waiting for me behind my eyelids.

I tried to explain what I saw to the nurses over the phone, but they simply dismissed me. They gestured vaguely to the ‘symptoms’ of the medication I was on, as if that answered everything. When I described  in detail what I saw, they dismissed that out of hand, barely listening before reassuring me it was all perfectly normal.

But I couldn’t let it lie. By the third night of sleep, I could paint the dream so vividly. I could describe it in such detail. What I saw, what I smelt, what I felt. The heat, the moisture, the rawness clinging to the walls.

I could see the pain around me.

I could feel the horror.

The red room stared at me though a blur. A haze of congealed blood, mixed with some chemically infused vapour, clung to the walls, ceiling, and floor, shading the space with a fog of gore. The air shimmered with a damp, metallic heat, as though the very atmosphere had been distilled from raw flesh. It tried its best to hide the shapes behind it, but the veil would slip. Beneath the fog, the walls pulsed. Slow, damp, rhythmic, as if the room itself had veins.

I breathed in through a hole in my face. Not a mouth at all, just a wet opening, soft around the edges, working like a gill. No teeth. No tongue. Only a hollow space sucking in thick, spoiled air. Each inhalation dragged something viscous down my throat, burning with a sour tang that coated the inside of me like oil. The air didn’t fill my lungs; it scraped them, as though drawn through needles, each breath stitching pain into the lining of my chest.

And then the tearing began.

A pressure deep in my core, pounding like fists against the inside of my torso. A hammering intending to break me open from within. Nerves flared. Muscles convulsed. I felt things shifting, rearranging, shaping themselves without my permission. As if something were creating a habitat inside me.

If I could have gagged or coughed, I would have. If I could have screamed, I might never have stopped.

But I simply could not.

When I woke from them, I was glad to be gone. But it followed me outside of my mind, I could feel its presence in the waking world. Something unfinished, something breathing just out of sight, waiting for me to close my eyes again.

Almost like the first time I suffered the heart attack, I would feel a beat stutter in my chest, then another. As if a second heart tried to pulse in place of my own, an alien thump struggling to match my natural rhythm. Sometimes the two beats aligned for a moment before slipping apart again, sending a faint vibration through my ribs like plucked strings trembling out of tune.

Every time I inhaled fresh air, I would exhale foul taste. The gore-thick vapour from the red room. It coated my tongue with the coppery sting of blood that wasn’t there. My nerves buzzed beneath my skin in tiny, frantic sparks, as if something just under the surface was testing each strand, humming along them like someone running fingers across exposed wires.

And sometimes, without warning, a phantom warmth bloomed across my torso, thick and suffocating, the same oppressive heat from the red room seeping through my skin as if my own flesh remembered a climate my waking mind rejected.

At other times, I would glance down and find one of my arms hanging uselessly at my side, limp and numb, as if it no longer belonged to me. I would try to lift it, command it, will it to move, and nothing would happen. The dead weight of it would send a cold spike of fear through me, a split-second conviction that the limb wasn’t absent because it failed to obey, but because, on some level, it simply wasn’t there.

The urge to gag, to cough, clung to the base of my throat, a reflex trapped behind a body that refused to respond. My lungs would hitch, hesitate, then drag in air with a strange, uneven pull, leaving a prickling after-burn that lingered.

These moments would strike suddenly or creep over me in slow waves, settling into my muscles, nestling behind my ribs. They would find me as I tried to work, or rest, or play. As I tried, in whatever small ways I could manage, to continue living.

One moment I was sitting in the park, sunlight warming my skin, the mundane chatter of the world all around me… and then I blinked. The pulse of red screamed through my ears as the trees blurred into wet silhouettes. My stomach clenched, sour and hollow, as if blood‑bile were rising in my gut.

“Yo! Thomas!” a voice cried from behind.

A face appeared in my periphery, one I knew all too well. I could tell which one it was by the nose piercing that the other one lacked.

“Hey Beck.”

“I know you got your surgery all lined up and everything but god you look, shaken. You all good?” Beck sat on the bench next to me, shouldering my arm for a reaction.

“Oh, yea… I’m fine really. I just…” I couldn’t find the words to explain what I was feeling. “Maybe it’s weird to say but, I’ve been having these dreams lately and I’m starting to think that it’s affecting me when I’m awake.”

“Like how?” 

“Well, sometimes it feels like I need to clear my throat, or my heart almost skips a beat. Not in a heart failure sort of way.” I try to joke. “Like, there is a second beat.”

Beck looked at me with a curious expression. “Sounds like Rach and I.”

“What?”

“It’s a twin thing, sometimes I feel a presence or a feeling which isn’t mine. But somewhere deep inside I know it’s her. Maybe she was worried about a car payment and I would sense her anxiety or if I just ran a marathon she would be exhausted. That sort of thing.”

I smiled at her explanation. “Sure, but I don’t think it’s that.”

Beck rolled her eyes. “I know, I was just trying to describe what I sounded like.” She paused, tapping her boot against the path. “Could be nothing. Some people swear organ donors and recipients get… connected somehow. Like echoes. I read that once.”

I shook my head. “Yeah, no. That’s not what this is.”

She shrugged. “Fair enough. I can’t relate to many people other than Rach. You get it.”

Honestly, I didn’t get it at all.

The dream returned, but this time it was no drifting blur. It came on with weight, like something lowering itself onto me.

Heat rolled through me in pulsing waves, each one heavier than the last, as if my own blood had been replaced with something thicker. My chest rose in short, desperate bursts, each breath dragging through me like it was being pulled through foreign wires. The air felt wrong again, dense and wet, but now it burned with a sharpness that tore at the inside of my throat.

I tried to cry out, or gasp, or do anything to relieve the pressure inside me, but I had no mouth. No lips. No proper shape to form sound. Only the instinct, the frantic, animal certainty that something inside me needed to scream. The groan that leaked from the hole in my face sent tremors of fear cascading through the room.

My lungs ached, craving more air than they could pull in. Each inhale felt like drawing breath through syringes, thin, painful streams of oxygen stabbing into tissue that wasn’t ready for it. My chest tightened in rhythmic spasms. I felt the urge to cough, but my body couldn’t. There was no mechanism for it, no release.

In the dream, it always started with the pain of existence, and then my vision would slowly build to reveal the red room.

But this time, it didn’t drift into focus. This time it was immediate, an unfiltered, raw stare that made my vision feel exposed. Everything was too bright and too raw, as if my eyes were fresh, forced to see before they were ready.

I saw a ceiling above me, or something like a ceiling. It rippled faintly, as if it were breathing, as if the structure itself inhaled with me inside it. I tried to look away, but my head refused to move. It felt like trying to drag a bruised muscle, a muscle detached from the bone, limp and useless.

Shapes swam at the edges of my vision. The walls were close, hugging inward with a strange, pulsing warmth. Their colour shifted subtly, beating in time with something I felt more than heard. A deep, wet throb vibrated through me.

My heart responded in kind.

Pain bloomed through my body suddenly, a hot, starburst ache that flared from places I couldn’t name. It felt like something beneath me was growing, stretching, pulling itself into shape. Each shift pressed into me, forcing me into a form I didn’t recognise.

With powerful strain, I managed to move my head, limp as it was on its perch. Something tore inside me as I pulled, a slow drag of tissue stretching past its limit. Then came the sound, sharp pops, wet snaps, the peel of flesh separating from something it had fused to. When I finally tore free, my head sagged forward, heavy and useless, dangling from strands that felt too thin to hold it.

And I could finally see my body.

There wasn’t one.

Instead, a garden of organs sprawled across the ground in front of me, glistening under the red light. Wet, bulbous sacks pulsed gently, each containing a vital piece of what had once been my human life. They were arranged without logic or anatomy, sprouting at odd heights and angles, stitched to the masses of meat carpet by ropes of veiny sinew. Veins ran like climbing vines, looping and knotting, binding everything into a trembling mesh. A nervous system stretched out like a fisherman’s net, every strand quivering with faint electrical life.

The muscles, what remained of them, hung in long, stringy curtains. Some were still twitching, spasms rippling through fibres that no longer belonged to anything. The lungs looked atrophied, inflating and deflating in slow, obedient rhythm, long spinal tendrils drilled into them to support their structure. The spine was splayed open and hung crookedly, suspended from the wall and floor by ligaments that had fused into stiff, branching tendrils. And my heart, sat where it should in proportion to the rest, each artery attached and draped into small orifices, the flesh walls greedily sucking from its life giving energies.

Everything else was refuse. Scraps. A butcher’s sweepings arranged into a shrine of meat.

I tried to recoil, to scream, to do anything, but my form could only spasm. The nerve net shivered violently, sending lashes of pain knifing through me. Each twitch peeled back another layer of agony, like nerves being flossed with barbed wire.

I wanted to close my eyes. I wanted that more than anything.

But they stayed open.

They did not so much look as receive, forced to drink in the shifting, living red around me. Another pulse of pain climbed what should have been my spine, but was now a writhing column of nerves. A cord of hardened muscle tightened suddenly and yanked my head back, slamming it into the pulsing mound behind me. Something soft burst under the impact, warm fluid trickling down my neck as my head was shoved into its original place.

My too-sharp vision took it all in at once, like a television suddenly in widescreen. The once cavernous room now felt smaller, filled with the red mass cradling me with its disgusting essence.

The final thought of that dream was simple and terrifying: was the room getting smaller, or was I getting bigger?

The dream ended the moment the pain peaked, a white-hot spear stabbing through my consciousness. I woke in my room gasping, sweating, clawing at my own face just to feel the relief of eyelids closing over my eyes.

And I could still feel phantom heat lingering under my skin.

I lay there for a long moment, chest heaving, the phantom heat crawling under my skin. Eventually, I forced myself to sit up. The room was quiet, normal, or as normal as my bedroom could feel after what I had just endured.

I rubbed my face, trying to convince myself it had been just a dream.

I did my best to focus on life for those weeks but the feelings left me hollow. A fear, rational and patient, was waiting for me. Always there when I slept. 

Soon, a donor was found and my surgery was scheduled. They were professional and prepped me quickly and efficiently.

When I was on the table, with the surgeons standing around me, all I could think of was that the red room  was waiting. Once I went under, I would be there again, unable to scream, unable to move, witnessing the vile deconstruction of myself again.

The doctor reassured me as they placed the mask over me, my heart beating at an irregular rhythm. 

Everything was going to be alright.

\*\*\*

It’s been a month since my surgery, and I no longer think about the red room. I recovered flawlessly, barring the payments I now have to live with for probably the rest of my life, I am free to do what I want. I can breathe freely now, each inhale smooth and full, no longer stabbing like syringes through my lungs. I can blink without pain, the simple act of closing my eyes a relief so intense it feels almost ecstatic. My heart beats as it should, steady, strong, completely my own.

These memories, even though they are mine, belong to a life that wasn’t.

I’m glad I was able to escape that place. I’m glad I was the one to be here.

I thank you for what you did. You saved me.

And for that, I’m sorry Thomas.
