I actually just came across this subreddit, so i'm not a hundred percent positive if everything here is fiction or nonfiction. So I will preface this post by telling you that this did happen to me and this is a true story.

It was a dark, muggy night in June 2020 when I found myself traveling to the depths of the badlands of Kensington, leaving a recovery house and battling a vicious addiction to heroin and fentanyl. As I stepped off the L train at Kensington/Allegheny, the familiar pangs of dope sickness began to grip my body. Desperate for relief, I quickly scored from a dealer on the block, but little did I know that the events about to unfold would forever alter the course of my life.

As I crossed the street, I passed two young black men engaged in what seemed like a friendly conversation. Suddenly, the air erupted with flashes and a deafening pop, followed by a series of muffled shots. I whipped around to see one of the men clutching a nine-millimeter, his hand pumping round after round at the other guy, who was now sprinting in the opposite direction. Instinctively, I dove onto the sidewalk, my face pressed against the concrete as I watched the scene unfold.

At first, I thought it was just fireworks, a common occurrence during the summer months. But as the shooter emptied his clip and disappeared into the darkness, the reality of the situation hit me like a freight train. The intended target kept running, seemingly unscathed, until someone yelled out, "You're hit! You're hit!" As if on cue, the man's body went limp mid-stride, and he collapsed to the ground, sliding nearly ten feet before coming to a stop.

As I lay there, our eyes met, and in that moment, I witnessed something I could never have prepared for. He let out a gurgling breath, and his body seemed to deflate, melting into the ground. It was a sight that no amount of violent movies could have ever adequately portrayed – the raw, unsettling reality of death.

Within minutes, a pool of blood began to surround him, and a Philadelphia Police squad car came screeching around the corner. The officers quickly loaded the man into the back of the vehicle and sped off to the hospital, leaving me sitting there, frozen in shock.

For the next three hours, I remained in that spot, staring at the place where he had fallen. Police officers asked me what had happened, but I remained silent, knowing that in the heart of the Kensington badlands, speaking up could mean sealing my own fate. I sat there, using, but couldn't get the energy to leave and just sat there in silence for hours until the investigation ended and the police dispersed. 

That night, something inside me changed. A part of me died, but another part was born. Looking back, the optimist in me believes it was all part of my journey to sobriety, while the pessimist whispers that I have unfinished business with hell.

I could write a book on the hellish things I witnessed in my year on the streets of Kensington's worst areas. I had seen death a dozen times since then during that year, includibg my own, but this one was different.

Today, I stand twenty-seven months sober, but the memories of that night in Kensington will forever be etched into my soul – a stark reminder of the darkness I've overcome and the strength I've found within myself to forge a new path.
