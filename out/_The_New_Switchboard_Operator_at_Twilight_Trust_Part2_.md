[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1f2xwta/the_new_switchboard_operator_at_twilight_trust/)

By the time I reached home, I was exhausted, and dawn was just beginning to break.

Upon entering the house, I found my sister Kylie asleep on the couch, probably waiting for me to turn up. A smile tugged at my lips when I saw she had already prepared lunch for Kevin and herself, leaving it packed and ready on the kitchen counter. I had told her that with my all-nighters, she would need to handle more household chores and look after our younger brother. And Kylie was already stepping up to the responsibility.

She also looked relieved to see me when I gently woke her up, and I then helped get Kevin ready for school. Once they were both dressed, Kylie thanked me for the lunch, which made me raise an eyebrow—was I so exhausted that I was hearing things, or was she just being her usual polite self?

Either way, she didn’t wait for my reaction. She quickly bolted out the door, taking Kevin’s hand as they hurried to catch the school bus. I waved from the front porch as I watched them climb aboard, then headed back inside, collapsed onto the bed, and fell asleep almost immediately.

When I returned to work the next day, the first thing I noticed was that a new portrait had been installed on the wall in the same place where the older one existed.

It was a beautiful picture that featured a close up shot of an insect perched on a twig. Even though it was only my second day on the job, I did wonder for a moment when it would be my turn to receive the portrait as a token of appreciation when I finally left the company.

However over the next few days, I began to notice strange things happening at both work and home. I couldn’t exactly pinpoint what, but it was a number of little things that seemed off. For instance, for my second ‘Task Hour’ assignment, I was required to write an essay on Ernest Hemingway’s ‘*The Snows of Kilimanjaro’*—a story about regret and missed opportunities faced by a man confronted with his own mortality.

What really unnerved me was that I had won a small prize in school for writing an essay on this very story. Was this all a mere coincidence? I couldn’t  say for sure, but it certainly felt like the company knew more about me than I did about them.

Then, when I returned home, I found my bed as though it had been slept in, but I couldn’t recall if I had made it after waking up—a habit I usually stick to. There were other oddities too, like my toothbrush being moved to the other side of the sink or my wardrobe being slightly rearranged.

Kylie confided in me that she’d been feeling unsettled too, especially at night, though she couldn’t pinpoint exactly what was wrong either. She said it often felt like she was being watched, so she started sleeping in the living room to keep an eye out for Kevin, who slept in the adjacent room.

Oddly, she mentioned that she’d been falling into an unusually deep sleep shortly after, which was strange given she’s always been a light sleeper, easily woken by the slightest noise. I tried to reassure her, saying it was probably just her imagination and that she was still getting used to me not being home at night. But deep down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.

On the fourth day, I woke up with a headache and noticed blood coming from my nose when I looked at my reflection in the bathroom mirror. It was probably just the cold weather and a lack of proper sleep catching up with me. But it did leave me a little startled.

Otherwise, I felt fine overall, though a lingering sense of melancholy persisted. It seemed to be a pattern with this job—by the end of each shift, a wave of heaviness and blues would inevitably settle in.

But the thing I found most peculiar about Twilight Trust was the way the work was managed here. There was no visible chain of command. There were neither team leads to manage the customer executives nor daily briefings, yet the work always proceeded like clockwork.

The only point of contact between us and the upper management was Mortimer, who regularly provided circulars on updates or any other requirements. Otherwise, the crew simply kept their heads down and worked with astonishing efficiency. I’d never seen anything like this anywhere else.

But I was beginning to personally struggle at work, constantly feeling weighed down and it was taking a toll on my mental health. I began craving answers. I couldn’t help but worry for my safety and that of my family. So,I attempted to start conversations with some colleagues during breaks, but they mostly preferred eating in silence. I eventually started to consider breaking some of the rules.

Maybe, for starters, I could answer one of those blocked calls and see why they keep calling in. It might provide a clue about what’s going on here. I could even pretend it was a mistake, given that the calls come in at random.

The following day, I reported to work and went about my duties as usual, after performing the customary rituals. A couple of hours into the shift, I watched the screen flash in red with a call coming from a blocked number.

I hesitated for a moment on whether to pick it. In a split second of indecision, I clicked connect and a voice suddenly burst through from the other end.

“Hello there, a very good evening to the disgruntled employee of Twilight Trust.”

“So who am I speaking with today? Is it Tom, Jack, Stella, Cathy or Macy?”

 The voice at the other end sniggered, even as I could tell he didn’t really care either way.

“Good evening Sir. This is Ryan. May I know who’s on the line?” I replied, trying to remain professional.

“Well.  Ryan it is then.”

 “So tell me Ryan, what happened to your colleague Cathy? Did she make it?”

I hesitated; uncertain of whom he was talking about. The only person I knew was Patricia, but I couldn’t be sure if he was referring to her.

“Come on, boy. Don’t leave me hanging. You know Cathy, right? The soft-spoken woman, very maternal, always caring.”

“Sir, if you’re talking about Patricia, I’m afraid she resigned a few days back. I’m here as her replacement.”

“Oh. So she made it then. Good for her! But poor thing, paid quite the price for it….”

“Sir, what do you mean by that?” I asked, leaning in, fully aware I shouldn’t be engaging, but unable to resist.

“So tell me Ryan, did you have one of them nosebleeds yet?” he asked, deflecting away, unbothered to answer my question.

I sat there in shock wondering how he could possibly know about that.

“Boy oh boy. Your bosses are really upping their game, aren’t they?”

“I gotta give them that. Credit where credit is due. That’s a lot of progress in how long?  3 to 5 days?”

“The same thing would have taken a couple of weeks in my time,” the voice continued, as if sharing a casual observation.

My head was spinning with so many questions, but I also felt like I was being baited now. This started to feel like an ambush. Part of me now understood why the company had blocked a number like this. And it certainly wasn’t in my best interests to overshare with a random stranger. However, I didn’t want to disconnect, not yet.

“Well, Sir, I’m afraid you’ve got it wrong. It’s just a normal nosebleed, probably weather-related. It’s pretty cold out here.”

“Oh Ryan! Is this how we are going to play it now? Make me the bad guy in all of this! Alright, because I am in a good mood, I will play along for your sake.”

“So tell me something. Do you notice the mirror on the wall? Is it turning a deep shade of gray?”

I slowly turned to look at the mirror and swallowed hard. He was right! The mirror had indeed turned a deep shade of gray.

“But how could he possibly know that?” I quietly asked myself.

“Your silence says I am right. Anyways, let’s move along, shall we?”

“Now tell me Ryan, does the mirror turn blue when you are busy attending calls all day?”

He was right again. The mirror had indeed turned blue for long periods while I spoke with callers.

“But how could you know this? What is going on here?” I asked him, no longer able to bear the suspense.

“Have you heard phrases like, red with rage or green with envy or pink with embarrassment?”

“These are all emotions that people feel from time to time, but the mirrors which are present all around you, have the ability to tap into that energy. “

“When you feel complete panic, the mirror turns a pale yellow, but when you feel a mix of both exhilaration and panic, it shifts to gray.”

“Even when you speak normally in a measured and calm way, like how you speak to a customer on call, the mirror can tap into that energy, which is when it turns blue. “

“But when emotions are heightened— that is while you are feeling intense anger, happiness, anxiety, sadness or jealousy—the energy pours out of you in torrents. Similar to a lamb bleeding out on the floor after its throat’s been slit. And the mirror manages to capture every bit of it. “

“But why? For what purpose? What do they hope to achieve by doing all of this?” I asked

“Because you are giving away your life energy, Ryan. They are being drained from you so that it can be given to feed someone else. What else do you think the Bank is giving out as loans to its customers?“

I felt a cold shiver run down my spine as his words sank in. The idea was so absurd, yet something deep inside me recognized a twisted logic to it.

The voice on the other end slowly started whistling, the haunting tune from his lips now filling the void in the room as he reveled in my silence.

The whistling only fuelled my anger though, a mocking reminder of how little control I had. Suddenly, I felt an overwhelming urge to confront the person on the other end of the line.

Who are you ? Why are you doing this? What is your agenda here?” I finally demanded, my voice wavering between fear and frustration. The whistling stopped abruptly, replaced by a low, sinister laugh.

“An agenda, you say? And here I was thinking that I am doing an act of service for the likes of you. Forging a necessary disruption in your world, with the hopes that your fate turns out better than mine.”

“I’m only here to give you a warning son, to let you know the clock is ticking. To heed or not is entirely up to you. “

 “You don’t have to believe a word of what I say. But you still want definitive answers, do you not? Then go find them yourself.“

“Go to the fifth floor in your building and see for yourself.”

“That should help you figure out what my ‘agenda’ is,” he sniggered.

For the first time, I felt like my back was against the wall, unable to think of anything to say.

“But that floor is off-limits. Employees like me aren’t allowed up there,“ I finally added, almost meekly.

“Talking to me is off limits as well. Didn’t seem to stop you now, did it?”

After an awkward pause, I asked him, “What do I call you in case I need to speak with you again?”

“You can call me anything you want. Zorro, Robin Hood or Mr Fawkes. I simply don’t care.”

With that, the call abruptly went dead, leaving me clutching at my headset in stunned silence.

I closed my eyes and leaned back in my chair as a hundred thoughts raced through my mind. I looked at the clock and realized there was less than 20 mins left for the task hour. So I attended a few more calls and finally put the system to mute.

Once Task Hour started,  I opened the leather bound journal and started reading.

 

Dear Gavin

We’ve been very impressed with your performance over the past few days, so the management decided to reward you by making today’s‘ Task Hour’ a light-hearted affair.

Instead of the usual routine, we thought, why not turn this into a fun session where you can learn more about our company?

All we ask is that you take a back seat and relax while we take you on a trip down memory lane.

Our hope is that this will give you a better grounding in who we are, and what makes us tick as a company.

But I can tell you right now what makes us tick: it’s you, Gavin.

Yes, you and every other employee who has worked at Twilight Trust. For the next hour, we want you to learn more about the people who have been part of this place before you.

Just for today, the locks have been removed, and you’re free to pull up any file of your choice from the filing cabinet. We believe this will give you a unique insight into the fabric of our organization.

Take your time, Gavin—explore the stories within those files, and let them guide your understanding of what it means to connect with our past while helping you see where you can fit into our ongoing story in the future.

And please note, due consent has been obtained from every single personnel whose file is open at your disposal.

So, what are you waiting for, Gavin? Dig in, and let the stories unfold!

 

I have to admit, the timing couldn’t have been better. Having been rattled by the blocked caller, my mind had been looking for answers all along.

I walked towards the file cabinet with anticipation not knowing what to expect. Opening one of the drawers, I began scanning through the files under ‘M,’ searching for Malone’s file. I barely knew anyone here, so I figured Patricia would be a good place to start.

It didn’t take long to find her file, and I quickly returned to my seat to take a closer look. The first page was, as expected, a work profile of Mrs. Malone, detailing her designation and role in the company. What followed were various Task Hour-related documents, along with some personal photos she had attached—probably part of the Task Hour requirement as well.

The photos spanned her life, from her toddler years to her teens, marriage, and the family that followed.

One picture, in particular, stood out: a young Patricia, beaming at the camera, with her husband and two small kids on either side, during what looked like a visit to the cinemas. There was something endearing about the way her motherly qualities shone through even on film, and I couldn’t help but smile.

But then something about the photo triggered an alarm in my mind. At first glance, it seemed perfectly normal—Patricia appearing to be in her mid twenties, flanked by her children. But then it hit me. The film poster in the background—it was for *Top Gun: Maverick*, a movie that was released barely two years ago.

“How is this even possible?” I whispered in shocked silence. “How could anybody age so quickly in just two years?”

I then frantically turned back the pages to go back to her work profile and checked her birthdate. She was born in 1994, which made her only 5 years older than me!

I became even more alarmed when I came to know she joined the company in 2022, which was hardly two years on the job.

Mrs Malone  had turned 30 only this year but in reality looked like she was already pushing 50.

Suddenly, Mr. Fawkes's call made a chilling amount of sense, and I struggled to suppress my panic.

I hurried back to the cabinet and quickly located Mortimer’s file. As I opened it, my gaze was immediately drawn to his profile. My throat tightened upon seeing his date of birth: 1906.

The black-and-white photo of Mortimer in his early twenties—ruggedly handsome, dressed in a military uniform with a confident smile, perfect teeth, and thick blond hair—made him seem like a completely different person.

By this point, glancing at the mirror—now tainted with an unsettling yellow hue—had become a habit. As I sat there, a wave of anxiety washed over me, and I struggled to make sense of the disturbing information I’d uncovered.

 Part of me wanted to dismiss it as a bad dream or a prank, but I couldn’t ignore the nagging feeling that something was seriously wrong with Twilight Trust.

Taking a few minutes to compose myself, I realized the only way to find answers now was to investigate the fifth floor. I decided to wait until the Task Hour ended to confront whatever lay ahead.

When the clock finally struck 1:00 AM, I grabbed my coat and headed for the elevator. My heart raced with every passing floor, each ding of the elevator adding to my mounting apprehension.

When the elevator doors opened to the fifth floor, I was greeted by a long, narrow, dimly lit corridor with a sharp right turn at the end. As I stepped out, a peculiar energy filled the air, making the hairs on my arms stand on end.

It felt as if an unseen force was drawing me in, pulling me toward something I couldn’t yet see. But I kept moving forward, each step more deliberate and cautious than the last, my breath shallow with anticipation.

As I approached the turn, I noticed a large nameplate on the wall that read “The Vault.”

Turning the corner, I found myself face-to-face with the largest vault I had ever seen in my life. Just then, a sharp pain shot through my head. I clutched my forehead and noticed my shirt getting stained, as droplets of blood began quickly trickling down my nose.

 As I stood there in shock, trying to stop the bleeding, I felt a sudden hand on my shoulder.

I jerked back in fright, only to see Mortimer standing behind me, staring intently.

Panic surged through me, not because he had caught me trespassing, but because of what was happening to his face. He looked nothing like the Mortimer I knew. Instead, he increasingly started to resemble the old photo I had found of him in the filing cabinet.

Those hollow cheeks and dead set eyes were rapidly being replaced by those of a youthful man with perfect teeth and rich blond hair. I watched in horror as his face seemed to heal and repair on its own, transforming before my very eyes in a matter of moments. And this sent me into an even higher state of panic as I found blood gushing down both my nostrils now.

Mortimer simply grabbed me by the collar of my shirt and started dragging me away from the vault with a firm and unyielding grip. I stumbled backward, barely able to keep my footing as he hauled me back towards the elevator. By this point, the blood from my nose was streaming all over my face.

The bleeding began to subside only when the doors of the elevator finally closed and it started its descent back to the lower floors. But I was quite not done with the horror show since Mortimer began to transform again.

As I lay with my back to the wall, the elevator lights began to suddenly flicker and finally went out, plunging us into total  darkness. The only illumination came from the mirror, now glowing a deep shade of yellow, casting an eerie silhouette on his face.

 I watched in terror as his features began to shrivel, as if being devoured by the sands of time. The musty odor around him grew stronger, thickening the air and amplifying my claustrophobia, completely trapping me in the confined space with him.

While I expected to face some serious repercussions for my trespassing, Mortimer watched me slump to the floor with an almost amused expression.

When the elevator doors finally opened on the third floor, he gave a casual wave, as if to say, "You first."

I needed no further encouragement and scrambled out of the elevator and struggled to regain my footing. As I turned around, expecting him to follow me back to my office, he simply stared at me, a smile curling on his lips as the doors closed again and the elevator resumed its descent.

I felt some instant relief to see him not trail behind me and I immediately headed to the restroom to wash off all the blood. I splashed my face with water multiple times, its chillness serving as a welcome distraction on my skin. When I slowly opened my eyes and looked in the mirror, I noticed a lock of hair on my head had turned fully white. 

But for some strange reason I didn’t panic anymore. Instead my heart began to steady, its beat gradually slowing to a normal pace, as if ready to accept the reality in front of me. I exited the restroom and walked back to my office.

As I settled into my chair, the events of the last 15 minutes played itself over and over again in my head.

My gaze shifted to the system in front of me, where I saw that I was still marked as ‘On Break’ and that someone from the support team was obviously continuing to cover for me. I leaned forward and took back command of my station.

I then traced the blocked number I had received earlier in the day, and made a return call. The line connected within a couple of rings but the voice on the other end didn’t burst through this time. I was instead met with silence, as if he was waiting for me to make the first move.

“You were right Mr Fawkes ” I said finally leaning into the microphone. ”I saw it for myself. I went all the way up to the fifth floor and saw it with my own eyes.”

“Everything you said was true.” I eventually confessed, hoping for some kind of acknowledgement from the other end. But I was only met with more silence.

“Mr Fawkes are you there?”

“What should I do? How am I supposed to deal with this?” I asked finally, unable to mask the desperation in my voice as the reality of my situation pressed in on all sides.

I expected the voice on the other end to deliberate for a moment before offering a strategy to help me.

Instead, he replied swiftly, “Follow the rules, young man. Follow the rules!”

“And Ryan….”

“Yes?” I responded, holding my breath, hoping for something—anything—that could guide me through the chaos.

“And that would include not picking up my calls in the future,” he added, before the line went dead.

I barely had time to process the call with Mr Fawkes before the phone started ringing again.

I leaned back in my chair, watching the screen light up with multiple inbound calls. I knew they would keep coming until the end of my shift. But oddly enough, I didn’t feel the panic I had earlier.

Now that I understood what I was up against, I could feel my body gradually settling into a determined rhythm—a sense of purpose driving each action, no matter how difficult the path ahead might be. So I went back to work, answering the calls as they came in.

Once my shift was complete, I followed all the rules that were expected of me, including sealing the red cord in a bag. As I turned off the lights in my room, my eyes automatically gravitated toward the mirror on the wall, which had turned a light shade of blue.

While exiting the building, I saw Mortimer seated in his usual place, and broke into his usual smile when he saw me.

“I would like to quit my job. This is not working for me. How can I get in touch with HR?” I asked, looking at him.

Mortimer didn’t look surprised. Instead, he calmly opened a file and handed me a document.

“Fill out this form. I will hand it over to my superiors,” he said, in a matter of fact manner.

As I completed the form and handed it back, I told him, “I’m giving you a month’s notice, as was mandated by the company when I took on this job.”

Mortimer offered no acknowledgment but filed my paperwork in a separate folder.

When I returned for work the following day, Mortimer was already at his post. In fact he had an update ready for me.

"Congratulations, Mr. Lockwood. The management has approved your request. However, they’ve extended your notice period by four weeks," he said, sounding sympathetic as he placed a newly printed document on the desk.

"But why?" I asked, my frustration mounting.

“Let me check,” Mortimer replied, licking his lips as he retrieved another document from a separate folder.

“The extension is due to penalties incurred during your time on the job. One extra week for picking up a call from a blocked number. Another week for tracing and dialing the same blocked number. And two weeks for trespassing.”

“Normally, trespassing alone would result in an eight-week penalty, but since you’re new and still learning, the management felt they should go easy on you,” he finished, breaking into a warm smile.

I stared at him in disbelief but I wasn’t really surprised at the development. Not anymore. All I could think of were Patricia’s final words about “following the rules.” I closed my eyes for a moment, then nodded in agreement and turned to walk toward the entrance.

“Mr. Lockwood,” Mortimer’s voice rang out, stopping me in my tracks.

“I need you to sign this document to confirm you’re in agreement with the new terms over the extension,”he said, with a slight shrug of his shoulders. “This is a professionally run company, you see. We need to adhere to our protocols.”

I simply nodded and signed the document before handing it back to him.

“Thank you Mr Lockwood,” he responded as he carefully placed the signed paper in the folder and closed it with a decisive snap.

With that, I quickly turned and walked past him, my mind still reeling from everything that just happened. But it only strengthened my resolve to see this through to the end.
