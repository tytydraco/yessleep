(please dont be harsh on me this is my first story/post ever)



 I never thought something like that could happen, better said, i didn´t thought it could happen to me. I´m a 29 year old man who lives in a small town in germany. I finally got to life a normal life after both of my parents died in a Boat accident. The things i remember from my childhood are blurry, but i know that i always was a very guarded child. I never got to play outside or made any friends. In school no one would talk to me, not even the teachers, but i always passed my classes even though i said barely anything. From an early age on, my parents took me to see different therapists, i don´t even now why. It was just usual to me. As i was 13, my parents gave me a medication, they said a therapist, [~Mrs.Schwarz~](http://mrs.schwarz/), had descripted it to me cause i had a rare form of ADHD. I question a lot of things now, mainly cause i never saw that therapist ever again. Wouldn’t it be weird to give a random child serious medication that you only talked to one time? But i believed they all wanted only the best for me and my health. I was the only one who attended their funeral.

Yesterday was like usual, after dinner, i took my medication and had fallen asleep at 10AM. I always do, it´s like my ritual. I sleep really good since i got that medication. No awaking, no snoring, its perfect. I also awake 7AM, which is great when i have to go to work. Maybe a little annoying on the weekends. I never thought it was a big deal. No one ever questioned me about it. Since the incident i have been living alone, i never had a roomate or a serious relationship. And i´ve never felt like im interested in something like that either.

I always felt lost around people and never knew how to behave. No surprise, no one ever taught me to.

Today was an exhausting day. I popped some frozen lasagna in the oven and fell on to my couch. I didn´t felt good. A little bit sick maybe. I watched the news and then I got up and searched for my medication. I just wanted to rest. It´s always in the same place, but tonight it wasn´t. I paniced a bit. After i demolished the lasagna, i searched everywhere. I felt so dumb as i realized that i didn´t even knew the name of it. What could happen if i skip taking it tonight? I thought. Nothing. It was just some medication, i said to myself. I would go to the Pharmacy tomorrow and ask if they had a neon orange box of tablets for ADHD. But as time went on, i paniced even more. Everything was so unusual. I sit now here like frozen with my phone in my hand. It´s 10.30. It´s weird, i don´t even feel real anymore. The clock is ticking louder than i ever heard before. Tick Tack. It sounds like i´m in a never ending loop. There´s someone standing behind my courtain breathing loudly, please help me
