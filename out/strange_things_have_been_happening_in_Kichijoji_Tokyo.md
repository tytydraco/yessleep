One sunny afternoon in Kichijoji, Tokyo, a strange phenomenon began to occur. People, dozens and dozens of people, started to go missing. At first, the authorities and the media thought it was an isolated incident, but soon they realized that something much more sinister was going on.

The disappearances seemed to follow a pattern. They always happened in broad daylight, and the victims always appeared to be ordinary people who were going about their daily routines. No one knew what was causing these strange disappearances, and the police and the government were helpless to stop them.

As the weeks turned into months and the months into years, the disappearances in Kichijoji showed no signs of stopping. The number of people who went missing kept increasing, and the authorities were at a loss as to what to do. No one knew where they were being taken to, or why they were being taken. A sense of fear and panic began to spread among the people of Tokyo, as they wondered whether they would be the next to be taken away.

The disappearances in Kichijoji went on for years, with no answers in sight. And as the years passed on, the city of Tokyo was left reeling from the unexplained disappearances of so many innocent people. Years of investigation led investigators to uncover a massive conspiracy, one that had been operating under their noses for many years. The disappearances in Kichijoji were being orchestrated by a secret cult, whose leader had been able to remain hidden for so long because of their connections to the elite.

As the authorities began to unravel the cult's intricate web of secrets, they discovered that the cult had been using advanced technology to vanish people into thin air. They had developed a method of opening up portals to other dimensions, and they were using these portals to transport people to another world. The elite had been paying the cult a hefty sum to keep their dirty secret under wraps, and so the cult was able to operate with virtual impunity for many years.

With the cult's secret finally out in the open, the police launched a massive crackdown on its members and its operations. The cult's leader was arrested and tried for crimes against humanity, and the cult itself was disbanded. The disappearances in Kichijoji finally came to an end, and the people of Tokyo could breathe a sigh of relief. As the dust settled following the arrest of the cult's leader and the disbandment of the cult itself, some residents of Kichijoji started to report strange sightings in the area. They claimed to have seen monstrous creatures roaming the streets, and there were even rumors of people being attacked by these entities.

At first, the police tried to write these sightings off as simple hallucinations or mass hysteria, but as more and more reports came in, they couldn't ignore the possibility that something was going on. They launched an investigation into the matter, and what they discovered was even more frightening than anyone could have imagined.

It turned out that the cult's leader had been conducting experiments with the alternate dimension technology that they had developed, and these experiments had gone horribly wrong. The portals to other dimensions that they had opened had unleashed a flood of eldritch monsters into the world, and the people of Kichijoji were now being terrorized by these creatures.

The authorities were forced to call in specialized units to deal with the crisis, and a massive operation was launched to exterminate the monsters that were ravishing the city. It was a long and difficult battle, but in the end, the city was able to drive the monsters back and reclaim their home. As the monster attacks continued to intensify, the authorities were forced to take drastic measures to protect the people of Kichijoji. They declared a state of emergency in the city, and ordered a complete lockdown.

All roads leading into and out of the city were blockaded, and all non-essential travel in and out of the city was prohibited. The military was called in to assist with the evacuation of the citizens, and a strict curfew was enforced to prevent anyone from leaving their homes.

The lockdown lasted for several weeks, and the city was transformed into a virtual ghost town. The streets were deserted, and the once bustling streets of Kichijoji had become quiet and empty. Some people managed to evade the authorities and escape the city, but most of the population was forced to remain within its borders.

As the lockdown continued, the monster attacks began to subsided, and the authorities eventually lifted the lockdown. Kichijoji was slowly able to begin the process of rebuilding and recovering from the horrors that it had endured. As the events in Kichijoji began to fade from memory, some people began to speculate that the entire situation had been a massive conspiracy, one that had been orchestrated by the government to distract the people from their own corruption. They claimed that the monster attacks, the cult, and the disappearances were all part of a grand scheme to keep the people of Tokyo from learning the truth about the government's shady dealings.

These conspiracy theorists pointed out a number of inconsistencies in the official narrative of the events, and argued that there was a much bigger conspiracy at play than anyone could have imagined. They claimed that the government had made a deal with the cult, allowing them to operate under the condition that they would carry out these attacks to distract the people from the government's own corruption.

Many people dismissed these claims as nothing more than crazy conspiracy theories, but some people began to take them seriously. They began to investigate the claims, and what they found painted a much darker picture than anyone could have expected.

It turned out that the government was indeed engaged in a massive cover-up, one that involved many highly placed officials and powerful figures. The truth about the government's corruption began to come out, and the people of Tokyo were left reeling from the revelations. As the truth about the government's corruption began to surface, the people of Tokyo were understandably outraged. They took to the streets in massive protests, demanding answers and accountability from their leaders.

The protests were huge, with tens of thousands of people rallying in the streets. They carried placards and chanted slogans, calling for the corrupt officials to be held accountable for their crimes.

However, just as the protests were reaching their peak, something strange began to happen. People started to disappear, one by one, in the midst of the crowd. At first, it was just a few people here and there, but soon the number of disappearances began to increase rapidly. Before anyone could react, the entire protest had vanished without a trace.

It seemed as though the government had once again managed to carry out a massive cover-up, this time using some supernatural power to disappear the protestors. The truth about the government's corruption was once again buried, and the people of Tokyo were left wondering what would happen next. I witnessed this with my own 2 eyes, I posted this soon before the Japanese government can shut down my internet. I might as well disappear myself soon
