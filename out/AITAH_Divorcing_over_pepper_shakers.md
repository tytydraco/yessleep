I'm not even sure I care at this point. I'm starting to forget what it was that interested me about this man.

​Basically I replaced our salt and pepper shakers because the old ones just looked... old. And dirty. I just wanted to make the kitchen look a little nicer.

​Anyways that sparked this whole rant of his. I honestly have a hard time remembering what he said but I do have the texts just so other people can see that I am not crazy. Here was the convo:

Babe: What happened to the salt and pepper shakers?

Me: I replaced them

Me: Do you like the new ones

Babe: They're nice

Babe: What happened to the old ones?

Me: I threw them away

Me: Before I took out the trash 

Babe: Ohhh that's not good

Me: What why?

Babe: I have to tell you something

Babe: Those were not just shakers

Babe: They held the fabric of our reality together

Me: What are you talking about?

Babe: Our world is but one of many possibilities. It exists because every other possibility is being "filtered" out, basicslly, through an interdimensional lens

Babe: That lens was in the pepper shaker

Me: You're joking

Babe: I wish I was

Me: What's going to happen 

Babe: Well... Poverty may lessen. So may human aggression. People will become more attuned to nature, rhythms of the earth. Technology will evolve, but it won't just be AI. Groups will come together to create significant advances in medicine. Life should improve for most creatures on Earth.

Me: Wth. Why were you keeping the shaker? Why keep the world more dystopian than it needs to be?

Babe: Because... this was the only reality in which we could be together

Babe: I know... it was selfish of me

Me: God dammit Jerry

Me: That's so messed up

Me: But so romantic

Me: But why did you keep it in such an unsafe place?

Babe: I'm part of a secret group. We're called reality keepers. They would know if I hid something. I had to keep in hiding in plain sight. It was the only way not to get caught

Me: So we like have to break up? Can't we just decide to be together

Babe: Well dear

Babe: For you

Babe: It will no longer feel as though being together is worth it, or even desirable

Me: That's ridiculous

Babe: I'm sorry. I love you. I will always love you

Babe: This won't matter to you soon, but the years we spent together will always have a special place in my heart

​But I just... haven't been feeling him lately. I finally decided to file for divorce and, since I have, things have been great. I got a promotion at work, my social life has been amazing and I even met a wonderful man. I don't want to talk too much about him because I feel guilty, but things could not be better.

​I just feel a little bad because my husband seems crushed. It's not like he did anything wrong, I'm just not in love with him anymore. Like at all. I actually can't wait for the divorce to be final. Gosh I sound like such a monster. But am I the AH for divorcing him even though he wasn't a bad husband?
