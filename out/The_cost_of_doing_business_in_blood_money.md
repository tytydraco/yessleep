When you have a skill in life it’s often in your best interest to put that skill to work in a field you’ll thrive in, and will gain the most benefit from. At the end of the day, despite how much we’d like to claim  otherwise, it doesn’t matter how good or bad of a person you are. All that matters is what you're capable of, and how much power that capability can bring you. I’ll be the first to admit I’m not a good person, simply a skilled one. Now that’s not to say I have no moral code, after all every professional needs  to set a standard for themselves, it’s what separates us from the bloodthirsty schmucks who wanna make a quick buck off of their bad habits. For starters no children, I mean christ I may be a gun for hire but even I have boundaries. No cruel or unusual punishment, it’s an execution not a torture session, I prefer quick and clean. I also prefer to know details about both whoever I'm working with, and whoever I'm being sent to take care of, to judge for myself if their actions deserve the consequences I bring. Of course if the clients pockets are deep enough I'm not against the no questions asked policy.

It’s one of these Clients that have brought me to writing this. A young woman with a vengeful rage and a loaded purse to rival bruce wayne who met by the name of Jess, likely not her real name but real names are never often given to begin with. When she hired me for the job we had met at some crappy bar in the middle of near nowhere. I had never met her before but yet she gave off a strange sense of deja vu, and I could already tell she didn’t choose the place for a couple of rounds and small talk before giving out the details, a point proven to me when I took a seat at the booth she was in and offered to buy her a drink as way to break the ice, only to be told she doesn’t drink alcohol. It soon became clear to me she chose the place due to her connections with it, being on a first name basis with the staff and what I assume to be regulars. I found this strange because despite choosing a location she was familiar with, her outfit would make you believe she was trying her hardest to hide her identity. A long coat, a large hat to keep whatever possible hair on her head hidden, and a pair of sunglasses so dark they almost swallowed the light. 

One waiter in particular kept checking in on us, possibly a brother, maybe boyfriend I had thought. A tall pale lanky son of a bitch with shaggy hair and a gel’d goatee, who was surprisingly well dressed for a bartender in a back alley shithole. He kept asking things like if I was the guy, if she knew what she was doing, and other questions along those lines. Enough to conclude he was very aware of, and seemingly even in on the job. I tried to ask some questions about it all but she quickly made it clear she wasn’t there to share details about her life, simply give me a target, or I guess I should say targets

It was here things first started getting strange. I'm no rookie, I’ve dealt with my fair share of multi hit jobs, but with every past encounter I had a good enough amount of details before going in, but when I asked for the targets, she didn’t give me any, not even a single name. Simply a small post-it note with 2 room numbers for a hotel they had been staying at, rooms 714, and 833, along with the instructions to take the elevator up, claiming the cameras didn’t work on them. which also revealed where I’d be going. Not exactly alarming, but what was off was the location in question. A small town in Kerry, Ireland. It could damn near be considered an unnamed landmark, and for your safety, will remain just that. Now going overseas wasn’t the concerning part, this job has taken me all over the world, to all different towns in all different countries…but never the same town in one of those different countries, let alone a place this small and underpopulated, and especially not…not that town. her minimalist way of dealing with the situation, along with that rather off putting coincidence was causing me to have my second thought on the whole job. That’s, of course, when she showed me just how deep her pockets were. With that, along with a rather hefty downward payment, it wasn’t long until I found myself on a private jet with little more questions. 

When I arrived at the hotel my targets were both located in, it was immediately apparent how out of place the building was. A 10 story modern 5 star Atlantic city style hotel and casino, right in the middle of what can best be described as a shanty fishing town. granted It had been years since I had seen the place, and I was only there for two days, not exactly for sight seeing either, quite frankly I tried to forget the time spent in this town…but anyways, the point is it didn’t look like much else had gotten any renovations. It was like a bright shiny palace surrounded by little log cabins. It boggled my mind to the point I had to stop a few feet from the door to think about what this titan of capitalism was doing in a place with maybe 50 residents, tops. I began to think perhaps my client had a hand in the place’s construction. She certainly had the funds for the project, and it could explain how she knew both the elevator cams were busted, and two separate targets were staying in the same place. If only I knew how right I was, probably would’ve turned around and left…Then again perhaps what followed was for the best. 

Instead I chalked it up to some business partners she grew some bad blood with and wanted out of the picture, so I shrugged it off and entered the hotel. As soon as I entered I noticed, much like the hotel’s appearance in this town as a whole, everything looked out of place. The lobby, bar, and gambling area, while still nice, were more fitting of the 1920s, right down to the staff uniforms and music. Even the restaurants and shops were thrown through a time machine, and given a historical theme like cowboys, vikings, WWII soldiers, and ancient pharaohs . I swear it felt like the history channel was smacking me across the face. After a few moments of admittedly getting lost in this maze of confusion, along with possibly trying my hand at a game of blackjack or two…or three, I finally found myself to the elevator, and began making my way to my first target, Room 714. As the elevator doors opened I quickly stepped in and went to press the button for floor seven, but as I did I noticed the elevator had been one giant wall of mirrors, and staring back at me was my reflection…my reflection from about 20 years ago.

I slowly approached the elevator wall as it began to ascend. I was undoubtedly looking at myself, and it was undoubtedly a reflection coping my motions and facial expressions, but the me I was looking at was one from years ago. My hair was longer, and much darker. My face had far less facial scruff, and fewer scars. I was so mind fucked by what I was looking at I had completely failed to notice the elevator had stopped to pick up someone else…until they spoke to me. 

“So this is how it ends, huh Jackie-boy?” A gruff, male voice said to me from behind. It was a line I had heard multiple times in my head, mostly when I try to go to sleep. Before I could even think I was reaching for my gun. I didn’t even want to, my body just moved on its own to draw my weapon, turn around, and place it under the chin of…Dante. A mentor to me of sorts, one who took me in at around 13 after he caught me trying to lift a pack of smokes off him at a gas station off of 8 mile. taught me almost everything I know.  Not exactly a shining example of a parental figure, but still a hell of a lot better than the drug fueled, wannabe street gangsters I used to call mom and dad. We worked together almost 15 years, until of course he ended up crossing some real powerful people we were employed to at the time. Once he was found out he had to be dealt with. This was a personal matter though. We couldn’t let some outside man deal with him, if someone in the family stabs the rest in the back, it’s up to the family to return it, and the higher ups saw this as an opportunity to test my loyalty, but more importantly, to absolve me of any suspicions to being an accomplice, by giving the job to me.

I tried to stop myself, drop the gun, tell him to run, but just like when it went down that night all those years ago, I didn’t do any of that. He flashed one last, smug prideful grin before my fingers pulled the trigger, and a bullet sprayed the inside of his skull across the elevator walls.  Much unlike that night however…he didn’t stop talking, despite having half his jaw blown off. He grabbed the barrel of the gun still resting under his chin, before twisting what was left of his mouth back into that smug grin, a thick silver substance spilling out the corners of it. “Killin a man with his own iron? That’s cold Jackie, real cold.” He said with a sinister laugh. His face was left completely mangled from the bullet, but his words were no less clear than when he was alive, as he continued to speak. “Looks like you took my lessons to heart huh kid?” He asked, almost mockingly, as his grip tightened around the barrel. “At the very least, you took lesson 1 to heart…Now this hole you just put through my brain here is leaving my memory a little foggy. So you mind reminding me what that lesson was again?” He asked in an overly sarcastic tone 

All I could do was stand there in a wave of confusion and fear as the dead man began to laugh in my face, that thick silver sludge spewing onto my face with each gargled cackle. It had the consistency and smell of house paint, but it was warm and tasted like a coppery flavor I’ve grown accustomed to in this line of work, blood. I was broken from my state of shock by Dante as he continued to push his line of questioning. “C’mon kid don’t get soft on me now, answer the question.” He demanded, a sharp hiss in his voice that sounded almost inhuman. I was able to steady my shaky hand and calm myself before taking a deep breath. “Trust only yourself.” I replied trying to hide any emotion. His quickly rotting grin stretched even wider, causing patches of flesh  to tear and release more silver blood. “ Atta boy!” he cheered out, a twisted sense of pride filling his voice. Moments after he spoke those final words a soft ‘ding’ filled the elevator, and as if on queue, the moment the sound faded Dante’s living corpse dropped to the ground and went limp as the elevator doors slowly began to open, bringing me face to face with a large oak door, the numbers 714 deeply carved in. 

My first thought was to make my way back down the elevator and get the fuck out of this place. No amount of money was worth continuing whatever it was I just witnessed, however I quickly came to learn this place wouldn’t let me leave that easily as I rushed to the elevator buttons to find them all gone, nothing but a smooth golden panel in their place. It was soon made clear finding a stairway was also out of the question, as stepping out revealed the only door on this entire floor was the one in front of me, all other rooms and exits seemingly sealed off by some sort of black brick. After about ten minutes of trying to find a way out, I realized the only thing I could do was move forward, so I took a deep breath, readied my weapon, and grabbed the doorknob. I didn’t even get to turn it, the moment my hand touched the handle everything went dark, and when I came to I found myself seated at a bar counter.

I quickly began observing my surroundings and it didn’t take long for me to realize where exactly this bar was. A safe haven of sorts for hit men and mercs, hidden in the heart of Vegas, and the closest thing to a work place I’ve ever known. Despite the fact I knew the place like the back of my hand, it would be made clear to me this was only my first visit to the place as I felt a rough but playful pat on the back, and an all too familiar voice speaking cheerfully from the stool to my left. “Told you I'd bring you up to the big leagues kid, and what a hell of a way to make an entrance eh!?” I looked over to see Dante once more, this time slightly younger, and far more alive. “taking out the fuckin Esticardo twins, those drug smuggling fuck wits were the biggest pains in the ass this place had.” He went on, the whiskey breath making it clear he had been doing his fair share of celebrating. Before I could even begin to explain myself another voice joined in…her voice. 

“He’s not wrong, you’ve definitely earned your spot here with that little stunt.” a woman's voice said from across the bar. I quickly looked back to see a short brunette covered in bright tattoos pouring a shot of Jack in front of me. A soft smile painted across her face, and piercing green eyes that struck you with a strange dangerous blend of caution, and temptation…She really was just as beautiful as I remember. “Jackie-boy, this is Miss Natalia Shadengale. Best bartender in this whole sinful desert, and what a rack on this one one eh!?” Dante let out in another drunken cheer before being abruptly cut off by a 9mm handgun to his temple. “And don’t forget, the girl who doesn’t put up with old pervs bullshit.” she said with a cheeky smirk before slowly returning the gun back under the counter. She definitely wasn’t lying, she didn’t put up with anyone’s shit, except mine for some reason, and for once I found someone who brought me out of my shell, made me experience more to life than trading heads for checks. She was the first and only woman I have or will ever call my lover, and she remained that for 4 years. 4 golden years of me and her. Our own place, date nights, hell we even got a dog. We were far from a normal couple, but for someone like me, there was nobody else in this world who could bring a sense of normalcy to it but natalia, and it was the closest thing to perfect someone like me could wish for…then she got pregnant. 

She was nothing but smiles, struck hard by baby fever. We spent the whole night dancing, partying, browsing through baby names, the whole nine yards. Even when we finally got to bed she spent hours going on and on about how she wanted them to look. “They have to have my eyes, no acception.” “If it’s a boy I bet he’ll grow up super tall” “I bet we would have the cutest girl” “you don’t think they’ll get bullied do you?” it wasn’t until about 2am she finally drifted off to sleep…and that’s when I left. You can judge me all I want, quite frankly I hope you do. I’ve done a lot of fucked up things in my life, and stained my hands with a lot of blood. Nothin felt worse than walking out of that door, but I couldn’t stay. My job brings a lot of enemies, their lives would be in danger, but it’s the only thing I know. I didn’t even go to pre school, and i’ve had more than enough run ins with the law to stop me from getting any real job that could support a family, plus I just…I couldn’t risk it if the kid turned out like me. I just wasn’t fit to be a dad, and I didn’t have the heart to tell her. So I just left, without a word. Not even a fucking letter, just a stack of unmarked bills on the coffee table. The plan was to never see her again, go completely off her radar…unfortunately I was only half right.

“I’m-fuck kid, fuck i’m sorry. I didn’t know…Jackie you know if I knew it was her I would’nt have-fuck Jackie i’m sorry kid” Before I could reminisce on the happier memories anymore I was brought back to reality by Dante once more, his voice trembling…As we stood over Natalias body, A bullet hole directly centered over her heart, thick silver blood pouring out, almost illuminating the dark kitchen. It didn’t take me long to realize where I was, as much as I tried denying it. A small cottage in the same town that god forsaken hotel stood, the night a hit was placed on Natalia for how loose her lips were about some of the business that happened at the vegas bar after leaving…and the night Dante and I had been hired to handle a rat from the same bar. We weren’t given a name or face, Just a location and a large amount of money in cash, up front from someone we considered a close partner. Before I could pray not to, I heard it. The small traumatized cry of a child. I could feel tears flood my face as I turned around to meet the equally tearful gaze of a little girl, no more than 7 or 8. dark curly brown hair just as messy as her fathers, and piercing green eyes just as beautiful a her mothers, eyes overflowing with tears as she pleaded to know who I was, and what we did to her mom. As I began to break down completely I was swiftly dragged out by the arm as Dante began babbling various forms of “sorrys” and “fuck” while we ran for the woods. 

It wasn’t for a couple hours until Dante spoke again while I was busy vomiting through my tears, nothing more than a sobbing mess in a pile of dirt and branches. “Never wanted to see you like this again kid…get why you shot me.” He muttered solemnly. I slowly looked up to see he looked much like he did moments before I exited the elevator, however the process of decay had seemed to take hold of him at a rapid pace. Flesh eaten away by rot to reveal muscle and bone, that silver blood now stale. More akin to frozen than stale really. Shiny, silver icicle-like shards hung off his face and surrounded his wounds. “Eye, for an eye and all that. Then again her bloods on your hands just as much as it was on mine.” He continued as a small smirk began to spread across his decaying lips. “No, no stop trying to fuck with me! You were the one who always had an itchy fucking trigger finger you old bastard! You shot her! you shot the moment you saw something move! that’s how you always fucking shot!” I yelled, lashing out in a symphony of rage, grief, and denial, only to be met with a calm sigh “Kid I've had more than enough time in this place to make my peace with the devils we danced with on this, and every other night. Never gonna truly forgive myself for it, but I’m able to accept it, and it’s time you do too.” He said, slowly taking a seat on a nearby rock as he Fished out a pack of smokes from his breast pocket, quickly lighting one and taking a long deep drag before continuing.

“I pulled that trigger, you're right, but you’re the one who decided to take the job, with no information on the target. I gave you the wheel on this one and you had your eyes set on that pile of unmarked Ben Franks, and it led us here. Someone put a bounty on her head, and we decided to collect the reward, plain and simple kid. whether we knew it was her head we were collecting or not, it doesn’t matter now. Hindsight doesn't mean shit in our occupation son. Can't change the past, all you can do now is make peace with it as best you can.” He said, looking at me with more emotion than I thought dead eyes could show, before taking another long drag. I slowly stood up and began brushing the dirt and puke off of me, before looking at him again. “Who are you?” I asked cautiously. 

He laughed through a puff of thick smoke before looking back at me. “Damn kid, how much of my face you paint across the walls?” he asked in that overly sarcastic tone I’ve come to miss hearing after all these years, taking another quick drag before continuing. “It’s really me Jackie. I ain’t some spirit, or demon, guardian angel, magic elf whatever the fuck else fantasy creatures you can think of, or hell maybe I am. Quite frankly I don’t know what I am now…” he began to trail off, a vast wave of emotions running across his face before recomposing himself. “The point is, whatever you are talking to right now is still the same old man who taught you how to hold a gun, and your liquor.” he finished with another small laugh as he put his smoke out and stood up, staring up to the night sky, speaking once more in a tone with such clarity that for a brief moment I completely forgot everything I had just gone through “When I first got here, the only thing I could think of was slitting your skinny fucking throat with a rusty pocket knife. The boy I take in under my roof, AND my wing, putting a bullet through my head with my favorite .45, and trust me I got to relive those final moments plenty of times…but then I got to relive other moments…” He looked at me, tears slowly falling from his long dead eyes. 

“Closest thing I had to a son, hell closest thing I had to any family…and I treated you like nothing more than an attack dog you get too attached to. I’ve wronged a lot of people when I was alive Jackie, some worse than others, and worst of all was you. You certainly weren’t an angel, but you had hell of a lot more potential to make something of yourself than me, and I fucked it up. Took a street kid off the streets and turned em into a cold blooded killer when I could’ve turned…no, raised you into a man this world would look at with respect and admiration instead of fear and disgust. I had the opportunity to make you a father to that little girl, and I used it to make you the very weapon responsible for tearing her from her mom. I deserved that bullet Jackie, deserved a lot more, after all I'm the one who taught you.” He said with a defeated smile, before slowly turning away from me and walking deeper into the woods. “Time to face your demons Jackie-boy, and best get moving quickly. The devil don’t like to be kept waiting.” He shouted back with a small wave to follow him forward. His words and tone filled me with such emotion it felt like I had almost blacked out again due to everything I had been told, and by the time I was able to truly process everything I was he said, Dante was well out of sight. I quickly followed the directions he had gone shouting for him to wait, but rather than coming across my old friend again…a door stood in his place, door 833 to be exact. 

I could only stare at it for what felt like hours. Debating what the hell could be behind this door, but it didn’t take long for me to realize I've already relived the worst of my past hands down. so whatever it was couldn’t even come close to the shit I've already gone through. I took one last look behind me, couldn’t tell you why exactly, maybe hoping to get one last push from Dante, but no, like he told me…it was my turn to deal with my demons, and I was gonna have to do it alone. So with one last deep breath I prepared for the worst, grabbed the doorknob, and stepped through. The moment I stepped through, I felt myself forcefully collapse to my knees as if all the emotions and stress built up throughout the ordeal gained physical weight to the point I couldn’t even turn my neck, only being able to stare down at what looked like marbled floor tiles, and listen to the sounds around me. Clinking glasses, multiple separate conversations, muffled sports broadcasts, all the telltale signs of a bar during rush hour. “So it really is you…” a woman’s voice spoke, successfully lifting my paralysis and allowing me to look up and see who had been speaking to me, only to see the very client who sent me through this all to begin with…and suddenly it all made sense, the moment as she removed her sunglasses, and my eyes locked onto to hers…a pair of emerald green eyes looking down on me.

I didn’t need to ask who she was, I didn't really need to ask why she put me through what she did either. I wasn’t gonna plead for forgiveness, I knew I didn’t deserve it, especially not from her, and I wasn’t gonna attempt to spill my guts to her with my sorrow and guilt. The look in her eye told me she didn’t need to hear it. The only thing I could manage to get out was a confused and desperate “how?”. She didn’t answer, or more so couldn’t. She Just looked down at me as a vast array of emotions flashed across her face ranging from hate, to disgust, to pity. Instead, someone else came to answer for her, the waiter from where we first met. “Impressed? What can I say I am quite the artist am I not.” He said with charisma as I the man seemingly manifested from thin air, appearing right next to…my daughter. “Granted I’m not normally a family counselor but what can I say Jackie, your little girl's story really tugged at my heart strings.” He said in a mocking tone as he wrapped his arm around her shoulder and squeezed it with great exaggeration. 

The moment his hand made contact with her, something snapped inside of me, as I managed to break from my paralysis I lunged at the man, only to be pushed back to my knees by some unseen force with a single point of his finger. The man began to cackle like a drugged hyena. “So now you choose to be a dad? I hate to break it to you Pal, but you’re about 27 years late to the job.” He let out another laugh, the mockery in his voice only growing as he pointed his finger toward the ground and I was quickly forced down farther onto the floor. It felt as if a thousand pounds had been dropped on my back, slowly crushing me. “What the hell are you!?” I yelled out in pain and confusion as the pressure on my body grew. “Well I’m glad he asked, '' he said with a cheeky hint of pride in his voice as he did, and with a literal snap of his fingers, I suddenly found myself sitting in a diner booth, the strange man sitting just across from me. 

I frantically began to look around the empty diner before returning my attention to the mysterious man. “Where is she? What did you do to Jess?!” I half demanded, half pleaded. He scoffed in my face before answering. “Jess? That’s what she told you her name was? Not like you were ever around to learn her real one.” He said with a malicious grin before continuing. “Not to worry Jackson. Your daughter is safe and well. Like I said, me and her made a deal, and I am nothing if not a good salesman.” He said with confidence. His words lead me to ask him the same question as before he transported us to this diner. “And what exactly are you?” I asked slowly, fearing the answer I might get. His cheeky grin spread far wider than ever before, wider than what should be possible for a person. “Why I’m many things. In some worlds I’m god themselves, in others…well I’m the very thing that kills him, and burns the heavens out of the sky.” He said with a chill to his voice so cold and twisted I could feel it chilling my soul. “I am as human as the average man, and I’m as eldritch as the ancient ones.” He continued, and as he did his face began to morph. Taking the shape of famed historical figures, long extinct animals, and beings that can only be described as unnatural, before quickly returning to the face it took when we first met. “But to you, I’m no more than a debt collector.” He finished 

I could feel my heart race as my mind tried to comprehend what he was saying, along with the things I’ve just seen. It was clear whatever this thing was…It was far more powerful than it was letting on. I slowly steadied my breath, before finally asking another question. “A debt collector?” I said with more caution in my voice than ever. His grin somehow grew wider as he eagerly began to explain himself. “Precisely. You, in a sense, owed a debt to your daughter, pain. She wished for nothing more than for you to feel her pain, but not just that, to endlessly feel her pain. What you witnessed just a few moments ago was nothing more than a sample. Thanks to the deal her and I struck, once your life has officially ended you will be mine again.” He said, in a way so matter of fact I could tell this was far from the first time he’s told someone this. I was caught off guard by how casual he was, and didn’t even really take in what he said, but when I did I felt my heart stop for a moment. 

“And…and what was this deal?” I asked, trying my best to stay calm. It seemed this was the question he was waiting to answer, as the moment he heard it his eyes lit up like a kid on christmas. “A soul for a soul Jackie.” He said with that twisted grin only continuing to grow. When he did, the feeling of a running freight train blasted me in the gut as the room began spinning. I began to internally panic, which quickly broke out into external panic…and that’s when he sunk in the hook. “Of course, I am nothing if not a good businessman. Another deal can always be made.” He hinted with little subtlety. I didn’t hesitate, if I had an opportunity to protect her, and for once in my pathetic life, at least attempt to be a father to my daughter I had to take it. “Tell me, what do I have to do?!” I asked desperately. His response was to place my gun on the table between us with a sinister smirk. “Two souls in the distant future…Or one right now.” He said, tapping his fingers against the trigger. “I’m a busy person Jackie, and frankly I don’t have time to sit around and wait for some humans to kick the bucket.” 

I looked at him for what felt like hours, then down to my gun, then back to him. “So I give you my soul now, and you never come back for hers. That’s the deal?” I asked as a thousand thoughts ran through my head. He nodded, slowly sliding the gun closer towards me. “Simple as that, no strings attached.” He said. I took one more long look between him and my gun, before slowly picking it up. 

Now I’m writing this, my final words if you will. I'm not sure if these words will ever actually reach someone but the stranger has allowed me a few moments before I complete our deal, and with how few my options are, it seems this to be the most fitting way to spend my final moments of mortal life. I’m leaving this world a bad man. I know this one good action isn’t enough for redemption, but it’s the most good a bad man can hope to do. Forgiveness isn’t something I’m looking for, and I’m well aware of what awaits me on the other side. The best I can do is hope she’ll be okay, and that’s the cost of doing business in blood money.
