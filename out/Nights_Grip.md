At 18 years old, I worked the night shift at Coles, a grocery store in Australia. My hours ran from 7 PM to 11 PM, and while the work itself wasn’t particularly glamorous, it suited me just fine. Night shifts brought a certain quietness that I appreciated, as the hum of the day gave way to a more subdued rhythm.

One evening during my shift, I stepped out for my break. Armed with a simple sandwich, I headed to the back of the store. The area was dimly lit, relying on an old, cheap motion sensor light that flickered awake whenever it detected movement. Beyond this little patch of cement and metal, there was a small, scraggly forest. It wasn’t much—a cluster of trees and dense bushes—but it always felt like a world apart from the fluorescent hum of the store.

I found a spot on an old bench, the sandwich already in my hands. The motion light hesitated, its dim glow barely spilling into the edge of the forest. The crickets were louder out here, their sound rising and falling like a wave. As I took a bite of my sandwich, a slight breeze stirred the trees, making shadows dance on the concrete.

But it wasn’t just the trees that were moving.

I froze, every sense on high alert. The swaying shadows seemed to take on a life of their own. Slowly, I stood up, bracing myself for what I wasn’t sure. As soon as I rose, the movement stopped, leaving the forest eerily still. For a moment, I wondered if my mind was playing tricks on me, but my unease refused to fade.

Deciding to head back inside, I walked to the door, only to find it locked. Panic bubbled just beneath the surface as I glanced around, hoping to spot another entrance. Instead, I saw nothing but the darkness creeping closer from the edge of the forest. I began to walk, circling the store in search of another way in. The motion light behind me flickered one last time, then went dark.

Heart pounding, I bolted to the front of the store, desperate to escape the oppressive darkness outside. As I pushed through the door, I was greeted by an unsettling silence—the lights were off, casting the aisles into deep, shadowy voids. I glanced down at my watch: 9:30 PM. An hour and a half before closing.

Where was everyone?

The quiet gnawed at me, amplifying every creak and groan of the empty building. My breath quickened as fear crept in, tightening its grip. Then, from just beside me, a sharp crack shattered the silence—a stick breaking. My body froze for an instant before instinct screamed at me: *Run.*

I didn’t wait to see what caused the noise. I bolted through the parking lot, feet pounding the asphalt toward my car. But as I reached for my pocket, dread washed over me—my wallet and car keys were still on the bench outside.

My mind raced, torn between two impossible choices—should I run back to retrieve my wallet and keys, or hide behind my car and hope whatever was out there would pass me by? Before I could decide, a new sound shattered the night—a pounding, heavy rhythm, unmistakably running. But this wasn’t just a footstep or a branch breaking; it was something larger, something massive.

The ground seemed to tremble beneath the weight of its approach, and it was coming closer with terrifying speed. I froze, paralyzed by fear, my body betraying me as I felt the chill of sweat soaking my clothes. Every instinct screamed at me to move, to act, but I couldn’t.

Finally, adrenaline overtook my fear, and I dashed around the building, barely aware of my own frantic movements. I grabbed my wallet and keys from the bench with trembling hands, not daring to glance behind me. The heavy, thudding steps thundered closer, but I forced myself to keep moving. Reaching my car, I fumbled with the keys, unlocking the door and throwing myself inside, my breath ragged and chest tight with terror.

I slammed the car door shut, locking it with shaking hands. My breathing was shallow, my chest heaving as I strained to hear over the rush of blood pounding in my ears. The heavy footsteps slowed, shifting to a methodical pace, each thud reverberating like a drumbeat in the dark. It was circling me.

I flicked the ignition on, the engine roaring to life. My headlights carved through the night, illuminating the parking lot—but there was nothing there. The oppressive darkness remained unbroken beyond the reach of the beams, swallowing the edges of the forest.

Summoning every ounce of courage, I shifted into reverse, but just as I began to back out, something darted through the edge of my vision—a shadow, massive and impossibly fast, vanishing into the treeline. My stomach churned as the weight of my own terror pressed down on me, but I didn’t wait to see what it was. The car screeched as I sped out of the lot, tires screaming against the pavement.

The store disappeared in the rearview mirror, swallowed by the night. Even as the lights of the city began to flicker into view, the pounding in my chest wouldn’t subside. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I hadn’t outrun it—that whatever was out there had seen me, marked me.

That night, I quit my job at Coles. I never went back to collect my last paycheck, nor did I return to retrieve the belongings I’d left behind in my locker. Some things are better left untouched, left in the dark where they belong.

But sometimes, late at night, I still hear it—the steady, heavy thud of footsteps, echoing in my mind like a nightmare I can’t escape.
