We lived in a small, long-past operational logging town called Kurtwood tucked away near the mouth of a river. Every mother and father in Kurtwood told their children the same phrase as soon as they were old enough to understand what it was they were saying, the words that clung to the back of every mind in town like a parasite, echoing among the streets day after day, year after year.

  


***Beware the hungry Woodsmen.***

  


A sliver of a poem known to everyone in Kurtwood. The four simple words were enough to keep the unruly in check.A poem some in town based their entire lives around, treating the words themselves like holy iconography.

  


I, however, did not. Everyone my age had their beliefs and skepticism about the Woodsmen, yet most spent the day glancing over their shoulders or looking deep into the treeline on the edge of town wondering if they’d angered the Woodsmen today.

  


By the time I was fifteen, I’d heard the stories a thousand times. Everyone my age had. Some believed them outright, weaving their lives around the warnings like talismans. Others laughed them off but still made sure to tread lightly when they walked beneath the trees.

We were always told that the Woodsmen lurked in the treeline watching, waiting for someone to provoke their wrath.

  


It was one of those oppressive summer evenings where the air felt thick enough to choke on, the humidity clinging to your skin like an unwanted jacket. I’d been kicking a rock down the cracked pavement of Main Street when I saw Tommy Carter. He was leaning against the old post office, taunting some younger kid who looked ready to burst into tears. Tommy was always a bully, and his sneering face was a constant presence in Kurtwood’s narrow streets. He had it coming, or so I told myself later.

  


I’d meant to shove him, just to get him to back off, but the moment my hands hit his shoulders, Tommy’s foot caught on the edge of the cracked curb, and he went down *hard*. His head bounced off the pavement with a wet *crack*. The younger kid screamed, bolting down the street without looking back.

  


In that moment it felt like time froze, like everything around me crept to a halt. All I could hear was the faint rustle of leaves from the treeline and the distant hum of cicadas. I dropped down and rolled Tommy over, lightly smacking the side of his face, *praying* he woke up. I resorted to shaking him by his shoulders and shouting his name. A few moments passed, and Tommy groaned, rolling over, blood trickling from a large dirt-covered gash on his forehead. I was lucky he was conscious. My chest heaved as panic clawed at me; it felt like my throat was closing and my heart was going to *burst* from my chest.

  


“You *idiot*,” he rasped, his voice trembling. “You’re gonna get us both *killed*.”

  


He stumbled to his feet. I tried to reach out a hand to help him steady himself, but he brushed me off, using the brick wall of the post office to brace himself.

  


“I-I-it was an accident,” I stammered, but even as I said it, I felt the weight of the words falter.

  


As he regained his composure, I was expecting him to lunge at me. Instead, he looked at me with more panic than anger, his usual boisterous demeanor morphed into a small dog with its tail between its legs. I glanced toward the woods, where the tall, dark pines loomed like silent sentinels. I only glanced toward the treeline, but my eyes felt locked on the shadowy canopy on the edge of town. I couldn't have been looking for more than a minute, but by the time I broke from my trance, Tommy was already unsteadily jogging back towards his house, presumably fighting off the pain and dizziness of the recent head wound.

  


I stood at the corner of the post office, unsure of what to do. Did I go tell my parents what I had done? Tell them that I attacked Tommy and nearly *killed him*? My mind raced as I looked up and down the street, realizing just how *empty* and *quiet* everything had become. I could've sworn I saw dozens of people out and about, walking up and down the street just moments before, yet now there was *no one*.

  


The whispers started then. Faint at first, like the rustling of wind through leaves, but unmistakably *voices*. They carried a cadence that made my skin *crawl*, words I couldn’t understand but somehow felt. My stomach churned as the air seemed to grow colder, the oppressive heat vanishing in an instant.

“This is *bullshit*,” I thought, feeling my breath start to increase rapidly. “It's not real, it's all bullshit.”

  


I kept glancing back over my shoulder, and with every glance, I thought I'd catch something peeking from behind a tree or the corner of one of the nearby buildings.

  


I was *not* going to let a story scare me.

  


I started to walk as fast as I could towards home, the entire time reminding myself that the Woodsmen did not exist. As much as I tried to tell myself I had nothing to fear, I broke into a slight jog as I got closer to home, nearing the edge of town. We lived by far closest to the woods themselves out of any other family in town. This was the first time in my life I cursed how secluded our home was.

  


The treeline shifted the closer I got to home. At first, it looked like the trees themselves were moving, bending unnaturally. As I made my way up towards the door of the small two-bedroom cabin, I tried to rush inside, expecting it to fly open. My shoulder clashed with the heavy oak door, causing me to bounce back a few steps towards the front steps.

  


“What the *fuck*,” I muttered under my breath, taking in more air in between each exasperated word.

  


As I went to try the door handle again, *hoping* the door had somehow unlocked, I felt the sudden lurch of my stomach jumping into my throat. Immediately I could hear my heart beating louder and louder in my ears.

  


I could see something *right* outside my line of sight, peering ever so slightly from behind one of the towering spruce trees on the side of my house...

  


In a moment of fear and stupidity, I turned my head in one sharp motion, locking eyes with *whatever* lurked beyond the trees.

  


*Immediate* regret filled my mind as I saw the six figures now emerge from behind the trees. Their faces were obscured by masks of bark and moss, each looked to be carved into the same big wide smile and dark *hollow* eyes. Their limbs were *unnervingly* long, stretching an unnatural length around the *thick* trunk of the spruce trees, hands tipped with claw-like fingers that looked almost like they themselves were made of burnt wood.

  


I let out a *desperate* yelp as I began to shake and pull on the door violently, *pounding* my balled fist into it as if to punch a hole clean through.

  


"Mom, dad!" I started shouting, my voice wavering and breaking as the panic set in. "*Please*, this isn't funny, open the door!"

  


I looked back towards the tree line, *praying* and hoping the Woodsmen chose to stay where they were. To my dismay, they had moved, although it was only a few feet. They were now out from behind the trees. I could hear the sound of trees creaking and *groaning* as if they were about to fall with every step the Woodsmen took.

  


I started to throw myself into the door, using every ounce of strength I had to get inside and away from the *monster* that lumbered toward me. As my pleas became louder and more frantic, I heard a low, *grainy* voice echo from inside the house.

  


The voice emanating from my home was that of my father. His words *hammered* into my skull, filling me with a sense of dread. His tone was unlike *anything* I’d ever heard from him—cold, distant, almost full of *malice*. It was as if he was looking down upon a lamb before slaughter, unfazed by the act of dooming his own flesh and blood to these *beasts* that lurked in our woods.

  


My feet were rooted to the spot, as if the very *ground* beneath me had risen to hold me in place. The figures drew closer, their movements *unnaturally* smooth, as though they floated *just* above the ground. The whispers grew louder, a chorus of accusatory tones that made my head *pound*.

  


The largest of the Woodsmen stopped just a few feet away, its hollow gaze fixed on me, Its tall, malformed body hunched down close enough now where I could see the patches of flesh of what was once a man, disfigured by the gnarling and twisting roots fighting every which way *bursting* out from underneath his skin, bringing to life a snarling, drooling beast made of both timber and flesh. One of its hands reached out, the claws curling slightly as it pointed toward me letting out what I can only describe as some sort of animalistic chittering. My breath hitched as I realized it wasn’t just looking it was judging.

  


"*Please*," I choked out, the word barely audible. "It was an accident. I didn't mean to hurt him, I *swear*."

  


The Woodsman’s head tilted in a *slow*, deliberate motion that felt more predatory than curious. I pushed my back into the door, sinking further and further down, now mere inches from the ground. I saw the Woodsman slowly extend the *long*, spindly fingers up towards me.

  


I squeezed my eyes shut, heaving and clutching the sides of my face as hundreds of thoughts *raced* through my mind on what my fate would be at the hands of the Woodsmen.

  


It was then I felt a *searing* pain in my shin. I let out an agonizing screech and looked towards the source as I felt my back hit the floor and the ground starting to move under me.

  


A long wooden splinter emerged from the Woodsman's hand, embedding itself deep into my leg with a meaty *pop*. Now dragging me off my porch and towards the shifting canopy of the trees, with every *bump* and jolt, a new flash of excruciating pain shot up my leg from *deep* within my bone, like the splinter was expanding and traveling up my femur—as if roots were snaking their way up my skeleton, finding purchase in my joints.

  


My attempts to *claw* at the earth, digging my nails into the dirt and roots, *tearing* my fingers to shreds, grasping *desperately* at anything that could be my salvation—I felt some of my nails rip from the tops of my fingers, falling into the dirt. I screamed out for help until it felt like I had swallowed shards of glass. It was all for *nothing*. If anyone had heard me, if anyone had seen me, it *wouldn’t* have mattered. I had angered the Woodsmen, and they were *hungry*.

 



I watched the daylight begin to fade as I was dragged deeper and deeper into the *impossibly* dark forest. I had gone limp, in defeat and acceptance of whatever fate awaited me—I’d given up, and as the sunlight disappeared in the deep depths of the woods, I felt myself dragged through large clusters of bramble bushes, feeling the sharp spines *shred* my clothes and what remained of my hope.

  


Hearing the whispers of the Woodsmen now grow into a dull hum as I was dragged into *whatever* depths these beasts lived, I could not help but remember the poem I had so foolishly chosen to *forget*.

  


**Beware the Hungry Woodsmen,**

*Their eyes pierce through the veil.*

*With splintered bone and hollow groan,*

*They hunt without fail.*

*The shadows twist, the brambles bind,*

*No soul escapes their hold.*

*Their whispers creep where silence sleeps,*

*And drag you to the cold.*
