I heard it again last night. They are calling out to me. No one understands it because it’s meant for *me*. I think I will join them.



I liked my uncle, he wasn’t that much older than me and he always made me feel included whenever we were together. He bought me my first gaming console and taught me how to play dungeons and dragons. I remember being told by my mother that he was ‘gone’. She wouldn’t talk to me about it, wouldn’t even let me *ask*. I didn’t hear anything more about it until I was twenty and received a knock at my door from his lawyer. Apparently he had left detailed notes about his inheritance and he had finally been ruled dead after all this time. I remember thinking the lawyer looked strange, but every time I think about him I can’t put my finger on what threw me off. He was wearing a nice black suit and he looked old. But that was it, he had no other notable features. I remember expecting a few knick knacks and games maybe so I was surprised when the only thing the old man handed me was a small, ancient looking radio. It was a handheld thing with a flat profile, a long metal antenna and some much abused dials. I remember it being cold to the touch as I took it from the lawyer, something like relief crossed his face. I thought it was some kind of joke at first, like my uncle had orchestrated this whole thing just so he could disappear to another country and this was just the cherry on top. 



I called my mom immediately and apparently the lawyer had visited her too with her portion of the inheritance. When I told her about the radio she seemed equally confused, she had just gotten some money and his old beat up car.



That evening I sat down to watch a movie; nothing special, just some comedy schlock. About half way through it I started to hear a sputtering fritzing underneath the sound emanating from my TV. At first I thought it had started raining hard, and I was hearing the droplets of water dash themselves against my windows, but as I glanced to my left I saw the sky was clear. I tried to ignore it. It was probably just my shitty TV acting up and I didn’t want to find out that I needed to buy another one, but as the movie went on the quality of the noise changed. It was static, that much was clear now, but it shifted in pitch and tenor every few moments. I used to have bad migraines as a kid and the only way I can describe that noise is that it sounded like how migraines feel. Agonising and fundamentally *wrong* in some way. I decided to turn off the movie and head to bed early, but when I shut the TV off I realised the sound wasn’t coming from it. It was coming from an object I had placed on the console beneath it. The old radio my uncle owned. It must have turned on by accident when I set it down. I didn’t even think it would work to be honest, but hearing that strange noise coming from it I decided I’d play around a bit.



I walked into my room and sat down on my bed, fiddling with the dials on the ancient piece of technology. The noise shifted and changed like an animal being prodded until I could finally make out some noise. It was a local radio station hosting a dreary sounding quiz. Satisfied with my progress I got ready for bed and headed to sleep. I don’t remember what I dreamed of that night, but I recall waking up to a tear-stained pillowcase and feeling the smooth afterglow of a shot of adrenaline. The radio was still playing I realised, but it had gone back to that strangle warbling noise.



In the weeks that followed the thing became just another object in my increasingly cluttered apartment. I talked to my co-worker and best friend Andrew about it at the time because he is a big analogue tech nerd and he said that my uncle might have willed it away to me because it’s a rare model that was discontinued pretty soon after its release. I idly thought about selling the thing, but it felt like a slap in the face to the memory of my uncle. It slipped from my mind entirely by the time it intruded on my life once more. I was disturbed awake by the static coming from the radio. I was reaching over to take the batteries out when I heard something in the cacophony of noise. It was a voice. Feint, barely even a whisper at first, but I could certainly hear a voice. My blood ran cold. It was probably just a snippet of a broadcast it was picking up, but as the voice clarified in the static, I knew that to be false.



*“-work harder than him. You know it”* It was Andrew’s voice, unmistakably. My hand hovered over the radio, stopped in its tracks. 



*“He’s been with the company for years”* The voice was that of an older man. My boss. I couldn’t wrap my head around what was happening. Was this some kind of prank? I checked my watch and it was three in the morning. My boss was not the man to pull this kind of joke.*“And he does fuck all for it. You know I’m a better fit for this position. You’ve seen the stats.”* I could feel as my stomach dropped. I knew when this conversation took place. I had walked in on them talking that day and they had seemed a bit awkward. But that would be impossible. Was someone recording them? Why would they play this for me? Beyond the confusion and terror, I could feel the embers of rage begin to smoulder within me. Everyone knew I was due the promotion after my manager quit. Was he trying to weasel his way in?The static cut out abruptly and I grabbed it to start fiddling with the dials to get it back. I heard nothing but static.



Over the next few days I saw Andrew talking with our boss more and more. He tried to start conversations with me but I knew his game. How he was only being nice to me because he pitied me. I wouldn’t fall for it. I could hardly get anything done that that, all I could think about was the radio and Andrew. I spent all week trying to find the frequency on the radio that led to it dispensing its secrets, but it just wouldn’t work. On Friday my mom called me.



“Hey sweetie” It was a relief to hear her voice. I didn’t realise how stressed I was, but the week had really taken a toll on me.



“Hey mom”“Your friend Andrew called, he said he was worried about you, that you were acting strange in work” My blood all but boiled. He was talking to my mom now? I stopped myself. Taking a moment to breathe, I reeled in my thoughts. All of this caused by a radio message I could have dreamt up?“Yeah, it’s just been a really rough week” I responded, holding my head in my hands, feeling the weight of exhaustion pulling me to places I didn’t want to be.



“Well sweetie, if there is anything you need to talk about, just let me know”



“Thanks mom, love you”“Love you too, take care of yourself” She hung up.I took a moment to centre myself after the call. I resolved to go to sleep early and apologise to Andrew in the morning. 



I opened my eyes and I was already sitting up in bed. The pitch black of my room was only punctuated by the stars that speckled my window. There were so many stars out that night with no moon to hide them from me.



*”He’s never been with it Tom”* It was my mothers voice coming from the radio this time. I pressed my hand to it. I could almost feel the static through the hard cold metal. Like something was trying to reach out to me. *“You need to stop coddling the boy, he's an adult now”* My dad’s voice was rough.*”I just don’t want him to end up like my brother”* What were embers of rage ignited within me. I knew this wasn’t a dream. I could feel just how real everything was. I could taste the blood in my mouth from biting my cheek, smell the strange ferrous rust odour that seemed to waft from the radio and most of all I could hear the static in my ears, like a choir of angels.



I stayed awake that night. Waiting until I knew my mother would be awake. I called her and she answered quickly.“What's wrong Dennis?” She answered with what I knew to be faux sincerity.



“Never been with it? End up like your brother? I didn’t think you’d sink that low mom” I bit back with as much venom as I could muster. “What are you talking about I-” The line started to break up a bit. But I soldiered on.“I know what you were saying to dad. I know what you really think” Tears of rage were streaming down my face by this point.“I don’t know what you are talking abo-” Static replaced her speech. A comfortable, keening static. One that promised to wash away all of the painful details in my life.I hung up with the assurance that at least someone had my back. I took the radio and put it in my bag as I left my apartment. The assurance the weight of the device provided carried me through the hall down the stairs and to my car. I nearly dropped my keys several times before I could start my car. I didn’t even realise I was trembling.  



Andrew’s home was a small terraced house near the center of town. This early in the morning traffic was almost non-existent, so getting there was easy. All of my car’s radio channels produced static. I parked along the footpath and hopped over the small fence leading to his house. I was going to get the truth out of him no matter what. I knocked on the green wooden door so furiously the hinges started to shake. When he opened the door bleary eyed and frightened I started to lay into him. Shouting at him about how he was a horrible friend. How he ruined my life. How I would never forgive him for what he did. The look of confusion on his face made me want to put my fist straight through it.



When he spoke, his mouth blurred and distorted. His face started to fritz and fill with tv static as his words turned to the sweet chords of my angel’s song. The radio was protecting me from his lies. I knew what I needed to do now, it was all so clear. Without another word I turned and left in my car.



When I got home it was night time. I didn’t even question it. It seemed *right*. When I entered my home I could see countless stars piercing through the night, shifting and twinkling against the black. Pixels of white and black dancing in an endless waltz across the cosmos, all for me.



Even as I write this, the radio is calling for me. They want me to join them. No one else in my life has ever wanted me so wholly. I know what happened to my uncle now, and I think I will follow him.
