My name is Maxwell Simmons. I'm a heavyset 32 year old man with a prominently receding hairline, and I just quit my job.

I get up at seven in the morning on every weekday and go through a practised routine that I've come to be dependent on before I go to work at nine. I'm a butcher at a local grocery store in the centre of town.

The place is good, but the customers are annoying.

"Can you cut it thinner?" When I've had to resort to using a knife instead of a clean spiralling blade.

"I want it lean, but not too lean. You get me?" No I don't get you, there's a thing known as centimeters.

It's fine on most days since most of my job involves cutting up the product in the back, away from the counter. The days I'm forced to interact with people who don't understand the difference between fillet and loin is sadly not as sparce as I'd want it to be.

The other butcher at the meat station, Jenna, she's an older woman who seems like she'd want to jam a cleaver somewhere else than between the joints of fresh cow on the best of the days. It wasn't easy becoming acquaintances with her, but overtime I think I squeezed past that rough exterior with my dedication to being punctual and relieving her of the night shift. She hates the job, but admits the pay is surprisingly better than expected.

Although what keeps me there isn't the money, it's my fascination with the meat between my fingers. I can't help but smile as I grab chunks of shoulder and break it apart with practised blows, each smash cracking the bone like porcelain under the hammer's head.

I have to admit, my favourite animal is pig. Fresh batches of swine always come on Tuesdays, and it never fails to bring me a smile on my face as I get to hear the satisfying eruption of wet flesh flop onto metal slabs where I get to start cutting, ripping and tearing into pallid pink skin. But I can't help but gag every time blood begins to gush forth from my fevered incisions.

It's incredibly ironic for someone who loves being a butcher. Jenna gives me shit constantly about it, she's always irritated when I ask for her to drain the carcasses, but I make up by taking over at the counter in the meantime. But whenever I'm alone at night, I'm forced to do it myself and I swear those pink sacks of flesh contain so much more of that sickeningly crimson fluid than they should.

I think I was proven right last night, when a new batch came unprompted on a Saturday afternoon.

It was a slow day, with most of the usuals leaving for the holidays to visit their families on Christmas.

Jenna and I were working late into the month. I was saving up a bit more so I could purchase a beautiful standing rib roast with it's perfectly marbled and tender texture that seemed to steam up in the frigid air of the freezer room. Jenna didn't have any family to go back to and whenever I tried to ask, she held her knives tighter.

It was an average shift in all honesty, and I couldn't even muster the same passion I had when I got to tear chunks of chicken breast apart like paper. What surprised us though was a message from the store's manager of a new delivery coming into the loading bay.

Usually there was at least a skeleton crew of stockers who managed truck loads, but they got sick this week and since we weren't expecting anything it was assumed it would be fine not to have anyone there for today.

Jenna gave me a blank stare with a sly grin from her leaning position on the glass counter.

"Aren't you going to get it?"

I gave her an equally blank stare back, as I was shoulders deep in a plastic bag and gently transferring an intestinal track into a bucket.

She chuckled and sauntered off to loading bay.

Bitch.

It must've been 20-30 minutes before she came back with a pushcart and a single refrigerated box on top.

Jenna was a stern person with a tight lip, so it sort of shocked me to see her with such a pale face when she pushed the cart into the cold locker.

I tried to brush it off, as maybe the cold air of outside just gave that effect on her face but that didn't make sense. I think it was hopeful wishing at the time, as I really didn't want to drain whatever was in that box.

Most grocery chains have a track leading from the bay to the fridge, so butchers can easily hook up carcasses from the truck and pull them to the meat lockers. Our store was the smaller type, so we had to manually lug it to the room ourselves.

It was only until I heard her scream did I jump up from the counter and slam my way inside.

She was there with her face pursed up in a rictus grin of pain, clutching her shoulder with an iron grip as the shoulder strap we usually wore laid unravelled on the ground next to a insurmountably large mass of bulging flesh.

I stood there in the doorway with my eyes transfixed on the pink experience in front of me. That was until I heard Jenna swear and call my attention.

"The hell are you doing you lump, help me up!"

Forcing my gaze away, I knelt on the ground and pulled Jenna up easily but not too ungently.

"FUCK!"

I pulled her into my hands to assess the damage, and sighed in relief before telling her what I saw.

"Thankfully nothing's broken, so you should be fine. Just press an icepack to your shoulder and it won't bruise so bad."

Pushing me away to orient herself, I heard her mutter "Of course you'd know how much it'd take to break." before she ripped off her gloves and stomped over to the door.

As she was leaving, I asked "What about the pig!?"

"Handle that fucking thing yourself!" Was what I got back.

I grimaced before going to get the right gear needed for hanging a pig on the hooks.

Slipping on cut-resistant gloves and pulling a support belt around my back, I grabbed another shoulder strap to help me lift it.

The pig was incredible.

Despite being dropped, it retained a tight figure fitting for a stronghold of meat and bones.

Slowly moving to savor the moment, I wrapped my hand around its hind leg tightly until I felt it soften underneath the warmth of my touch. I felt my throat twist at the sensation of blood sluggishly shifting through dormant jugulars, but pushed through the nausea.

I wrapped the strap quickly around its mid section, before bending my knees carefully and heaving it upwards against my chest. I relished how I could feel the organs within undulate against my form with every step towards the meat hook, the ribs clattering inside at the swine's inevitable destination.

Plunging the curved implement through it's left tendon allowed me step back and take a breather.

'The hell was Jenna thinking trying to lift that by herself, it nearly weighed 120 kilos.'

Dreading the next step, I picked up a long straight knife and approached the carcass to exsanguinate whatever thick slurry remained in it's veins.

In the cold room where gusts of steamed air bellowed out from my mouth with every breath, I assumed it have some resistance when I plunged the blade into the carotid arteries in the pigs neck.

But the knife slid in like it was warm butter, enveloping the blade with a satisfying slurp. It was so wrong but the noise tickled my brain in a way I can't exactly describe.

I quickly stepped back to avoid any of it splashing onto my steel toed boots, and shuddered as a torrent of blood ripped its way from the pig's wound.

I looked away as it finally ebbed into a slow drip, and shuddered with each coagulated drop that slapped against the tiled floor.

Flinching at each heavy slap, I approached the pig to move it along the rail before I heard something else.

It sounded like the ocean.

Before I could even think to scream, the swine on its hook engorged a wave of blood from its neck, enveloping my entire body in it's red grasp.

It was so cold. Like sinking into frosted mud during a winters day, except I sank up to my neck in it.

My large form was flung against the door as the gushing finally stopped and the carcass stopped swinging on its hook.

I puked on the floor. Chunks of thick pieces that had became solid like phlegm had found its way into my throat.

Before I was done getting it all out of my system, I heard it again.

I tried to shut my mouth this time, but the blood wormed its way into my nostrils instead. I couldn't breathe, I was being suffocated by the thing I reluctantly drained into buckets for a living.

My back smashed against the door with a resounding thud again, I could feel my bones creak with the pressure my body was being subjected to.

I could hear Jenna now, shouting through the door and tugging at the steel handle.

It wouldn't open.

The swine itself was defiled. Nothing on this world should be capable of storing that much blood and it showed.

It had shrunken, except the flesh atop its bones was sunken in like an empty balloon. The skin around its neck was elongated and stretched like taffy, drooping down onto the wet slippery floor.

The swine's head contorted around the extra flaps of meat that found themselves pushing outwards from the wound I stabbed into its neck like a cabbage of dead skin.

I was never disturbed by the eyes of dead carcasses from the various animals I butchered every week, but the eyes that stared at me from behind puckered sockets were so alive and so tired.

I laid in a fetal position on the ground, that same red slurry still creeping out from my ears and nose. I silently begged and prayed it was finally over.

I didn't hear anything else after that.

Jenna opened the door and found me crying like a child and huddled against the wall. Cold crimson liquid decorating every wall and trailing out of the fridge when it was opened.

It must've been a sorry sight but I couldn't care. I was done.

I quit the next day after that.

I completely changed my diet to never have anything related to that swine near my mouth.

It's been a few days now and I have to write this out. I'm scared to open the fridge in my kitchen.

I hear waves behind the door.
