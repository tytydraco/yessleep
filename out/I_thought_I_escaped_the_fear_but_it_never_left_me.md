This happened when I was in my first year of high school. My life was completely ordinary — classes, friends, studying. Nothing strange. Nothing scary.

Then, little by little, I started hearing whispers. A voice, low and close, like someone leaning in too far. It happened even when I was completely alone. I told myself it was just my imagination, but it kept happening… and it was getting harder to ignore.

One evening, I was getting ready to go out. I leaned into the mirror to fix my hair, and suddenly a hymn. Soft at first, then clearer, as if someone was standing right behind me, singing into my ear. It sounded like a church choir trapped inside my bedroom.


I froze. My breath caught in my throat. My skin turned cold and prickly, like every hair on my body was standing straight up. I couldn’t move for minutes. Later, I told my mom. She brushed it off: “You watch too many horror movies. It’s just in your head.” I tried to believe her. I really did.

After that, I forced myself to ignore any voice calling my name. But then I had a dream about Jimmy — a close friend of my dad, someone who treated me like his own daughter. In the dream, he got into a car accident and died.

I woke up sobbing, shaking so badly I could barely hold the phone when I told my mom we had to call him. When we did, we found out he had been in an accident, but he was alive. For now. I couldn’t stop trembling, but my mom refused to see any connection. A month later, Jimmy really did die in a car crash.

That’s when the nightmares started coming true. In one dream, a massive black anaconda chased me down and coiled around me until I couldn’t breathe. Days later, I got sick a sickness that clung to me for almost a year.

I’m a believer. I pray on time. I try to live a good life. But I stopped telling anyone what was happening because no one would believe me. Strange things piled up: I’d leave something on my desk and find it across the room. Once I rolled over in bed and saw a figure sitting right in front of me. Silent. Watching.

I kept praying, begging God to protect me. I told myself it was just the devil trying to scare me and, for a while, I got better. My life felt normal again.

But now, five years later, it’s back. The whispers. The fear. The dreams. I feel like I’m slipping into the same darkness I barely escaped before.

I’m terrified. Terrified of getting sick again. Terrified of collapsing with no one there to help me. As I write this, my hands are shaking, and I can’t stop crying. I just wanted to share this because I don’t know what’s happening to me.

I’m thinking about seeing a psychiatrist… but I can’t help wondering if that will be enough or if something else is coming for me
