I was driving down a desolate road in the middle of nowhere, coming home from a two-day business trip. I was starving; it was 1 PM, and I'd been on the road since 6 AM. I figured I wouldn't find anything to eat for the next 50 miles or so, but to my shock, something appeared in front of me. It seemed like a hallucination when first seen, but as I was walking closer, I found that it was an old-fashioned diner, and the sign hanging outside read "Haven's Diner" with very faint neon glow in a dense fog that was swallowing the endless road.



Inside, it was quiet but for the very faint hum of a jukebox playing some tune I almost recognized. The smell of burnt coffee and grease hit my nostrils, but I sensed something else, a metallic tang that I couldn't place. The place was deserted save for a waitress stationed by the counter with a smile a little too wide and eyes nailed to me like she had been waiting for me.



I slipped into a booth by the window, and just as I hadn't yet bothered to request the menu, a waitress came by, set down the steaming plate before me, and walked off again. Staring at that food in revulsion made my stomach roll up. It was mom's meatloaf recipe—overcooked edges, an exact shade of gravy, to the point she hadn't prepared that dish for over ten years, since her death.



"How did you know…" I began to ask, but the words caught in my throat. The waitress merely cocked her head, still smiling, and headed back to the counter without a word.



I should have left right then. I was too hungry, too tired, and something about the smell of that meatloaf drew me, filling me with a bittersweet nostalgia I couldn't fight. I picked up the fork and took a bite. It was perfect, just like I remembered it from when I was a kid. But as I chewed, a strange sensation crept over me, like I was being watched by someone I couldn't see. The hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I glanced around the diner. It was still empty, except for the waitress, who now stood completely still, her back turned to me.



That’s when I noticed the clock above the counter. It was stuck at 3:33, the second hand twitching but never moving forward. My appetite vanished, replaced by a cold knot of unease in my stomach. I stood up, leaving the half-eaten plate on the table, and headed for the door.



Leaving so soon?" a voice said behind me. It wasn't the waitress. It was a man's voice, low and raspy, like he'd smoked a pack a day for years. I turned around, but no one was there. The booth where I had been sitting was empty, the plate of meatloaf gone.



I ran for the door, my heart pounding in my chest, and flung it open. Outside, the fog was thicker than before, pressing against my skin like a damp shroud. My car was gone. In its place stood another sign, smaller than the one out front. It read:



"You're always welcome at Haven's Diner. See you soon."



I started walking, hoping to find the road, another car, anything. But no matter how far I went, I ended up back in front of that damned diner. And each time I returned, the same plate of meatloaf was waiting for me, steaming hot and just the way Mom used to make it.



I don’t know how long I’ve been here. Days? Weeks? The clock inside still says 3:33. The waitress still smiles that too-wide smile. And the jukebox keeps playing that almost-familiar song on a loop. I can’t leave, and I’m afraid to eat again. But sooner or later, I know I’ll give in. The smell of that meatloaf is stronger now, and my hunger is growing.



If you ever pass a Haven's Diner along the side of the road, keep going. No matter how hungry you are. No matter how tired. Just go.
