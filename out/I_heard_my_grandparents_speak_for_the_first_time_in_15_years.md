I don’t know how to talk about this, but I feel like I have to mention it or it’ll fade like a distant memory. I live by myself in my childhood home out on the edge of our city. It was built by my great grandparents and my own grandparents lived in it until my grandfather passed. Today, for the first time in 15 years I heard my grandparents speak. 

I was in the living room going through one of their old wall units taking a look at all the keepsakes my grandparents had. My right hand had just passed over a strange ebony statue when I heard this ringing in my ears. It wasn’t uncommon for me to hear this and I figured it just happened to everyone. I just stared into the hollow eyes of the statue as I waited for the ringing to stop. As the sharp pinging continued I could’ve sworn the object emitted a faint glow. That’s when I heard his voice.

“Come downstairs Liana, our Berry is here to visit us.”, said my grandfather in the same warm tone he always used when we visited the house. I half expected to hear the familiar footsteps of my grandmother coming down the staircase. After a second I realized the voice hadn’t been a figment of my imagination because it started up again.

“Liana! He’s waiting on you, says he’s got a present for us from New York!”,  shouted my grandfather. I was in the front hallway to the house before I realized I had moved. Before turning the corner I envisioned seeing my grandfather as he was, a large man with salt and pepper hair, large square glasses, a bushy mustache and a plain tee with some dirty jeans. My mouth was spread in a grin as I prepared myself to see him again. All that met me around the corner was the front door. 

Immediately my heart sank into the pit of my stomach. The man who I so desperately wanted to see again would have to stay secluded to my mind and the images I had of him. I heard once that it was bad to reply to a voice calling your name, but did that apply to voices you knew? 

I chose to test my luck. I called out, “Grandpa? Are you there? Grandma?”. The call for my grandmother I directed to the top of the stairs. The many times I saw her come down those stairs blinked into my mind. 

“Berry?”, my grandmother called down. 

I was shocked, but I chose to shoot up the stairs. I almost fell on the last step but remained on my feet by grabbing onto the railing. I reached for the doorknob hoping to see her curly white hair, her black eyebrows, red lipstick and flowery sweater that she wore nearly everytime I saw her. 

I yanked the door open hoping to catch her, but I was blinded by the light contained in the room. My ears began to ring again and I collapsed onto my knees. I shut my eyes but even that couldn’t keep the light out. It felt like the ringing had spread throughout my whole body when I felt something wet and slimy touch my right forearm. I went to jerk my arm back but it wrapped itself up my arm and pulled me towards the light. It squeezed me with incredible strength and I couldn’t loosen its hold. It felt like wrestling a 200 pound slug off myself. I reached in my pocket and pulled out the pocketknife my grandfather had given me on my 13th birthday. I slashed towards my arm hoping that I didn’t hit myself with my blinded swings. Luck was on my side because whatever it was let out a deep noise that sounded like a frog mixed with a whale. A horrible bellowing that I haven’t forgotten since I heard it. Whatever this thing was it let me go and the light disappeared. I opened my eyes and saw a huge black outline like an ink cloud in the middle of the room. I could see the tendril that had lashed out at me retreating and heard the ringing blare back to life in my eardrums. It disappeared during the ringing, like a television being turned off. 

I ran to my car, this time I did fall down the stairs. Clutching the black stained knife I turned the key in the ignition and found the battery had died. I called the cops using my cellphone which, thankfully, still worked and let my friends know what happened. My official story is that I found an intruder and defended myself when they attacked me. My friends got here before the cops and then when they arrived they took my statement. It’s been three days and I haven’t noticed anything else. I was able to stay at a friends place since the incident but I don’t want to overstay my welcome. I’m heading back today. So just a word of advice, don’t answer the voices that call your name even if they sound like a loved one and especially if your ears start to ring. My grandparents told me that.
