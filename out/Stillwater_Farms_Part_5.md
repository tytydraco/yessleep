***— Day 4 —***

I woke to the sound of water.

It wasn’t dripping, not exactly, more like something breathing through the walls. Slow, steady, as if the earth itself had lungs. The air was damp, thick with rot and iron. My wrists ached before I realized why.

Chains.

Heavy, rusted, bolted into stone.

Nick sat beside me, slumped against the wall, his head tilted toward the floor. His hands were bound the same way. His shirt was stiff with dried blood. Not his—Hailey’s. For a second I thought he wasn’t breathing. Then I saw his chest rise once, shallow.

We were underground. The air was wet and close, the walls built from rough stone mortared by hand. Wooden braces crossed the ceiling, low enough to brush with my fingertips. A butcher’s table sat in the center beside a drain cut straight into the floor. Along one wall, two iron bedframes stood side by side, their thin mattresses covered in folded wool blankets. A toilet sat exposed in the far corner, a pipe running down into the floor, the bowl cracked but clean. Shelves lined the back wall, stocked with jars and canned food. Beside them sat a washbasin and a jug of cloudy water. Someone had built this place to be lived in, not escaped from.

I tried the chains once. The sound echoed like a scream.

Nick stirred. When his eyes opened, they were glassy, lost somewhere I couldn’t follow. He blinked slow, then focused on me.

“Where is she?” he asked.

I didn’t answer. He already knew.

He turned his face away and started to shake. Not the kind that ends in tears—the kind that goes deeper, like something breaking where no one can see. He didn’t speak again. I didn’t either.

Time passed, or didn’t. The lantern on the wall burned low. My body cramped, my throat dry. I counted my own breaths until the door above us creaked open.

Footsteps.

Soft ones first, then heavier, dragging.

Mae came down the stairs, lantern in hand. Harlan followed behind her, carrying two bowls that steamed faintly. His eyes didn’t rise from the steps. His clothes were clean but his hands weren’t.

Mae smiled like a hostess greeting guests late to dinner. “Good,” she said. “You’re awake.”

I pulled against the chains. “Where’s Elenor?”

“She’s safe,” Mae said. “Resting upstairs. You’ll see her soon enough.”

Harlan set the bowls at our feet, thick stew with bread torn into chunks. His shoulders hunched like he expected to be hit.

I looked at him. “You killed your own daughter.”

He didn’t move.

“Clara,” I said. “That was her name, wasn’t it? She trusted you. And you just—”

“Alex.” Mae’s voice cut through the cellar like a knife. “Mind your tongue. You don’t know what you saw.”

“You made her a martyr,” I said. “Gutted and drained. And for what? That thing in the well?”

Mae’s expression didn’t change. “She gave herself to the water, as many before her have done. My parents. My sister. The land takes what it needs.”

I spat on the floor. “You call that land? That’s murder, you crazy bitch.”

Anger rose in me like heat from the floor.

Mae crouched so her eyes met mine. They were steady, the same calm she’d worn when she offered us pie. “The Stillwater keeps us whole. But in keeping us, it takes something in return. To drink from it is to lose the gift to create life. So we borrow where we must.”

“Borrow,” I said. “You mean steal.”

She smiled—almost sadly. “Life is borrowed by all, dear. You should be honored. Few are chosen to give so much.”

“Where is she?” I asked again.

Mae stood. “Elenor is safe and being well cared for. You’ll see her soon, when it’s time to fertilize the soil. Until then, you’ll stay here. Privileges will come through obedience. Contest all you wish, but this is the way it has always been.”

My voice came out low, raw. “What about Clara? Was she not obedient enough?”

Mae’s hand stilled at her side. For a moment I thought she might strike me. Then she said, “The water chooses, and takes what it’s owed. When one fruit is cut, another must grow.”

She looked at Harlan. “Unchain them.”

He hesitated.

“Now.”

Harlan stepped forward and unlatched the bolts one by one. His hands were calloused, trembling slightly. The chains fell with a dull thud.

Mae brushed the dust from her skirt. “You’ll find resistance is useless here. The land knows you now. It remembers.”

As she turned to leave, I spoke again. “You’re sick.”

She paused halfway up the stairs. “No, dear,” she said softly. “We’re eternal.”

The door closed, and their footsteps faded.

The cellar filled with the sound of breathing again: ours, the earth’s, and something else deeper still, moving in the dark.

***— Day 5 —***

I didn’t sleep that first night.

The cellar was too quiet to trust. The kind of quiet that seems to listen back. Every shift of the walls had a pulse to it, every sound some proof that the world above still moved.

Nick lay on the cot beside mine, staring at nothing. His body twitched sometimes, small jerks that came without warning. I could hear his teeth click together every few breaths. Neither of us spoke.

I tried to count the seconds, then gave up when I realized I’d been doing it for hours. My mind kept slipping back to the well—then to Hailey. I could still smell the iron on my hands, though there was nothing there.

At some point the lantern flickered out.

We sat in the dark for what felt like the length of another life.

When light finally came again, it wasn’t from the lantern. It was from the door above, opening just enough to let a stripe of gold down the stairs. Dust floated through it like ash.

Footsteps followed: slow, steady, deliberate.

Harlan.

His shoulders brushed the narrow walls as he descended. He held a sheet over one arm, something heavy folded inside it. A smell came with him: meat and earth and something sweet, already turning.

He laid the bundle on the butcher’s table. The wood groaned under the weight.

The sheet slipped just enough for a lock of hair to fall free.

Hailey.

Nick made a sound I’d never heard from another person. He stumbled forward, caught himself on the edge of the table. His hands hovered, shaking, as if touching her might undo what had been done.

Harlan didn’t look at him. He moved around the table, slow and methodical, his breath catching in his throat every few seconds. He unwrapped her, folding the sheet with a care that made my stomach turn.

Her skin had gone the color of clay. The punctures from the stag were clean, black pits, ringed with dried blood. Her mouth was open slightly—a final word that hadn’t found its way out.

Harlan crossed to the wall and took down the tools one by one: the saw first, then a cleaver, then the long, narrow knife with the bone handle. He laid them out beside her, metal touching skin. The sound was soft, almost reverent.

He touched the saw to her shoulder, then to her hip, then her neck—showing us, without words, what was expected.

When he finally spoke, his voice came from somewhere far away.

“Work or not, everyone contributes here. We don’t waste what the land gives us.”

The words broke something in me.

I moved without thinking, grabbed the saw, and swung.

It never made it halfway. Harlan’s hand came up, bare, stopping the teeth mid-swing. The blade dug into his palm. Blood welled and ran, but he didn’t flinch.

Then his other hand was at my throat.

He lifted me off the ground like I weighed nothing. The world went narrow: his face, the black smear of blood down his wrist, the smell of sweat and iron.

His eyes met mine. And in them I saw—not anger, not hate. Just the emptiness of someone who had long since buried both. Behind it, something deeper: sadness, heavy as the earth that surrounded us.

His voice cracked once. “It’s better to obey.”

He dropped me.

I hit the floor hard enough to lose my breath.

He placed the saw back on the table beside Hailey, blood dripping from his fingers in slow, steady beads.

Before he left, he paused at the top of the stairs, as if he were about to say something. Then the door shut.

The silence afterward felt alive.

Nick sank to the floor, his back against the wall opposite Hailey’s body. His face had gone hollow, eyes fixed on her like he was waiting for her to move.

I watched the drops of blood dry on the floor.

Time passed, or didn’t. I don’t know.

When I finally stood, the air felt heavier. I walked to the table and reached for the saw, knowing that doing what was asked might be the only way to give Hailey peace.

My hand barely touched the handle before Nick grabbed my wrist.

At first, I thought he was stopping me.

Then I saw his face.

“I’ll do it,” he said. His voice wasn’t angry. It was steady, like something already decided. “It has to be me.”

“Nick—”

“Sit down, little brother.”

He took the saw and turned toward her. The sound it made against her body was too soft to seem real at first. Then louder. Metal through flesh and bone. The rhythm of something that was no longer work, no longer mercy, just the only thing left to do.

I sat against the wall, eyes closed. The air was thick with salt and rust, and the only sound was my brother gagging as he carved what was left of Hailey.

In the end, I really had failed her.

***— Day 6 —***

By the time I woke the next morning, the pieces of Hailey were gone.

All the tools were gone too. Someone had come in the night and taken them both. Only the dark stain on the table remained, shaped like a shadow that wouldn’t leave.

Nick sat rigid on his cot, hands limp in his lap, eyes hollow and rimmed red. He didn’t look at me when I sat up. I didn’t speak. There was nothing I could say that wouldn’t make it worse.

The air was colder, heavy with damp stone and old meat. I listened for footsteps above, for chairs scraping or boots, but the house stayed silent. Somewhere in the walls the earth breathed on: slow, steady, patient.

I tried to scrub the table with the rag from the basin. The stain only smeared darker.

Nick watched me for a long time, then said quietly, “She wouldn’t want to be here.”

“I know,” I said. It was all I could manage.

The door above creaked open just long enough for a tray to be set on the top step: two bowls, two cups of water. No one came down.

I ate because there was nothing else to do. The stew was thick and sweet with root vegetables. I chewed slowly, thinking about where they’d been grown. Nick didn’t touch his. When he finally did, it was only to shove the bowl away after I’d placed it in front of him.

Hours slid by like another life. The lantern guttered low. The weight of everything pressed down: soil, stone, guilt, air. I wanted to say something that would reach him, something that would make the world tilt back into shape, but words were useless things in that place.

When the door opened again, it wasn’t Harlan this time.

It was Silas.

He came down with his usual grin: sharp, knowing, the grin of someone who’d never once been afraid in his life. His boots hit the floor like punctuation.

“Morning, boys,” he said. “Sleep well?”

Neither of us answered.

Silas smirked, clicking his tongue. “Guess not.” He let his eyes wander around the cellar, taking in the butcher’s table, the stains, the beds. “Cozy little setup, huh? Beats the dirt.”

He stopped in front of us, resting one hand on his belt. “Alright then. Time to see the girl.”

I stood automatically. “Elenor?”

He nodded. “That’s the one.”

I started toward the stairs, but he lifted a finger. “Not you, boy.” He pointed at Nick. “Him.”

Nick blinked, slow to understand. “What do you mean, me?”

Silas tilted his head like it was obvious. “Means you’re up first.”

Nick’s voice cracked open. “Up for what?”

Silas grinned. “Mae didn’t tell you? Damn woman always talks in riddles.” He leaned in a little. “You’re gonna fuck that girl til’ one of you gives me a new baby brother or sister. Simple as that.”

Nick went white. “No. No, I’m not doing that. That’s Alex’s—no. Never. You fucking monster.”

Silas shrugged. “We don’t give two shits who the father is. We gave up that privilege when we drank the water. Once that baby’s born, it’s Stillwater through and through. Don’t matter whose blood it got.”

He gave a crooked smile. “Hell, my blood daddy’s deep under this house right now. I’m sure you’ll join him soon enough.”

Nick stepped forward. “I refuse.”

Silas’s hand dropped to the knife at his hip. “Then option two is I kill you where you stand, and your brother chops you up just like your girlfriend. We only need one of you; we’re being generous letting you both ‘contribute’—might speed things along. But hey, your choice.”

Nick froze. His breath came fast, shallow. He turned to me, and in that look was every impossible thought at once: disbelief, anger, fear, and a silent plea for this not to be real.

Silas watched us, amused. “If it helps,” he said, “the girl knows. Be flattered—she’d rather fuck you than kill you.”

Something broke in Nick’s face.

I stepped closer. “Nick,” I said quietly. “It’s okay.”

He stared at me like he didn’t recognize me. “You can’t mean that.”

“They’ll kill you if you don’t,” I said. “El only would’ve agreed if they threatened her too. Please—come back. I can’t watch anyone else die.” Tears tracked down my face, but my voice stayed steady.

The words sat between us like something poisoned. Then, finally, he nodded once, stiff, mechanical.

Silas clapped his hands together. “Alrighty then. Y’all done with the soap opera? Let’s get moving, boy.”

Nick turned toward the stairs, every muscle locked. As he passed Silas, he muttered, “Don’t call me boy, you fucking brat.”

Silas’s grin vanished. In one motion he grabbed Nick by the hair, slammed him against the wall, and pressed the knife under his chin. “I bet I’m older than your grandaddy, boy. Know your place.”

He shoved him forward toward the stairs. Nick stumbled once, then kept walking. Before the door closed he turned and met my eye—there was an apology in it I have no language for.

I stayed standing long after the door shut. The silence pressed in until it felt alive, pulsing through the stone. Somewhere above, the house creaked, and I pictured the room they’d taken him to: the bed, the quiet, the way El might turn her face away just to survive. 

I wanted to hate him, to hate her, to hate anything that would make the thought bearable, but there was nothing left to blame. Nothing but the family, and the water that hummed all around me.

\*\*\*

Time moved wrong after they left.

I sat on the cot, counting my breaths, but the numbers slipped away from me. The lantern’s flame bent and trembled until it was little more than a pulse. The air felt even heavier now, close and wet, like the cellar was sweating along with me.

Sometimes I thought I could hear them upstairs: the dull creak of floorboards, a voice muffled by wood, a sound that might have been crying or might have been nothing. I didn’t know which was worse: imagining it or not being sure if it was real.

I pressed my palms against my ears, but the silence had a voice of its own. It came from the walls, from the pipes, from the earth that held us. The sound was soft, rhythmic. Like water speaking through stone.

I lost track of time again. Hours passed. The lantern burned out.

Then the door opened.

Nick came down the steps one at a time, slow, deliberate. He looked smaller somehow, like the air had been beaten out of him. His eyes were fixed on the floor, and when he reached the bottom, he didn’t look at me. He walked straight to his cot and sat.

He stayed like that for a long while.

When he finally spoke, his voice barely existed. “She didn’t look at me.”

I didn’t answer.

He rubbed his hands together, staring at them like they were someone else’s. “She didn’t cry. Not once.”

The words hung there, twisting in the damp air. I wanted to hate him. I wanted to scream. But when I looked at him, I saw only the same thing I felt: shame, loss, and the quiet understanding that none of this would ever leave us.

So I just sat across from him, my hands shaking in my lap, trying to swallow the heat in my throat.

“How does she look?” I asked finally, still unable to meet Nick’s eyes.

He thought for a moment. “Clean. Healthy. Clearly getting better treatment than us.”

“Good.” I lay back on the cot and stared at the ceiling until my eyes blurred.

If I couldn’t save myself, I’d save her. If that failed, I’d make the family answer for everything they’d taken.

***— Day 7 —***

The cellar settled into a rhythm of breathing: ours, the earth’s, something else deeper, almost whispering to us. When footsteps finally came again, I was sitting on the floor beside the drain, tracing the cracks in the stone with my thumb.

The door opened without warning. Light spilled down the steps in a narrow stripe, thin and yellow as old bone. Ruth stood at the top, hands folded neatly in front of her.

“It’s time, Alex,” she said.

Her voice carried no malice, no warmth, only the weight of something practiced.

I followed her up the stairs. The light stung my eyes; the air felt too clean after days of stone and rot. The hallway above was scrubbed spotless, as if nothing foul had ever touched it. A kettle hissed somewhere distant. Someone laughed: soft, domestic, almost human.

Ruth didn’t look back as she walked. “She’s been asking for you,” she said.

We passed closed doors, the smell of soap and bread, the ghost of ordinary life. She stopped at one near the end of the hall—a door I hadn’t seen open before.

“She’s inside,” Ruth said, and stepped aside.

The room was bright in a way that hurt. Curtains drawn open. White linens. A vase of flowers already beginning to wilt. A homemade candle that smelt like blackberries. And on the bed, sitting straight-backed with her hands folded in her lap, was Elenor.

For a second I thought she was someone else. Her hair was clean, brushed until it shone. Her skin looked flushed with life. She wore a cotton dress that didn’t belong to her, soft blue with small buttons down the front.

She looked at me as if she wasn’t sure whether I was real.

I crossed the floor without remembering how my legs worked. When I reached her she stood, and we held each other. No words at first—just the sound of two hearts beating out of sync.

“You’re okay,” I said.

“I’m alive,” she answered. Her voice was thin but steady. “They said I’d see you soon. I didn’t know what that meant.”

“What have they done to you? Have they hurt you?”

“No—no, nothing like that.”

I cupped her face with shaking hands, as if I had to touch her to believe she was real. She looked beautiful. She looked like home.

Before I could speak again, Ruth’s voice came from the door. “You have an hour.”

Then the lock turned.

The quiet that followed was thick, almost physical. I could hear the faint drip of water somewhere in the walls, steady as a metronome.

We sat together on the bed. For a long time neither of us moved. Her hand found mine, cold and trembling.

“They said it had to happen,” she whispered. “That the land needed life to make more.”

I didn’t answer. There was no language that could make sense of what they’d turned us into.

When it happened, it didn’t feel like touch. It felt like labor—a ritual, a test, something done to us rather than between us. The room stayed quiet except for small sounds of movement and breath. Love felt distant, buried under everything we’d lost.

Halfway through she went still, tears welling. “They said they’d kill you if I didn’t agree.”

I couldn’t speak. Her breath hitched once, then she said, “Please don’t hate me. Please don’t hate him.”

“It’s okay,” I said, as sincerely as I could. “We do whatever we have to do to keep you safe. I will never hate you.” Despite my words, rage that I couldn’t properly direct bubbled in my chest, sharp and useless.

After, she lay with her head on my chest, staring past me toward the ceiling. The smell of blackberry had turned sour in the heat. I told her I’d find a way out—that I’d burn the whole place down if I had to. She didn’t respond, just kept tracing slow circles on my arm with her finger until Ruth came back.

When Ruth opened the door again, the air from the hall felt cold. She didn’t look at either of us, only said, “Time’s up.”

I didn’t move. I stared at Ruth, calculating how fast I could cross the room and smash her head in. Logic fought my wrath; even if I could kill Ruth, it would only make the family angrier and put El at greater risk. If we were going to get out, it had to be planned. I had to stay alive for her.

I kissed El’s forehead, once, and stood. Her eyes followed me but she remained still.

As Ruth led me back toward the cellar, I heard it again—the sound beneath the floorboards. Louder now, closer. Not water dripping, but something moving through it.

Something beating with life.

\*\*\*

When Ruth led me back to the cellar, the air felt colder than before.

Nick was awake, sitting on his cot the same way I’d left him: elbows on his knees, eyes somewhere past the wall. He didn’t look up when the door shut behind me. The latch clicked like a period on the end of a sentence we’d both been avoiding.

The smell of soap and blackberries still clung to my skin. I wanted to wash it off, but the scent felt too deep now—a reminder of everything upstairs, everything wrong.

I sat across from him, waited for him to say something, but the silence only grew thicker. Finally, I tried, “She’s safe. She—She doesn’t blame you. I don’t blame you.”

Nick’s jaw tightened. He nodded once, a motion more reflex than belief.

We stayed like that for a long time. The cellar breathed around us: soft drafts through the vent, the groan of old wood, the steady drip of something hidden in the walls.

Then his voice broke the quiet.

“You were right about them.”

I didn’t answer.

He rubbed his palms over his face, fingers trembling. “If I’d just listened… if I hadn’t been so fucking stubborn… she’d still be alive.” His voice cracked, swallowed itself. “I let her die, Alex. I let *you* down. I’ve fucked up everything since the day we got here.”

I shook my head, but he kept going.

“I should’ve stopped them. I should’ve protected her. I’m supposed to be the one who keeps everyone safe, but I couldn’t even keep—” He caught his breath, his whole body shaking now. “Every night I see her face. The way she looked when—”

“Stop,” I said quietly.

He didn’t. “She was all I had left, and I ruined it.”

I stood, crossed the space between us, and grabbed his shoulder. He tensed like he expected a punch.

“You didn’t fail her,” I said. My voice came out rough, but steady. “None of us stood a chance here. You hear me? None of us.”

“You did. You knew something was wrong from the minute we got here. I’m so sorry, Alex, you’re nothing like mom, your—your everything I wish I could be.”

He stared at the floor, breathing hard. I squeezed his shoulder once, grounding him.

“You’re my big brother, Nick, everything I am wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for you,” I said. “You’re still here. That’s enough.”

For a moment, he stayed rigid. Then his shoulders slumped, and he let out a sound that was half a laugh, half a sob. We sat together there for a while, side by side on the cold floor. No words, just the small mercy of company.

Hours drifted. The lantern dimmed until everything was the same dull shade of gray.

Nick eventually lay back on his cot and fell asleep: deep, dreamless, the kind of sleep that only comes from exhaustion, not peace. Sometimes he muttered under his breath. Sometimes he said Hailey’s name.

I couldn’t sleep.

I lay awake, staring at the beams above me, listening. The air shifted differently now, pulling through the cracks like it had found new lungs.

Then I heard it again.

At first it was only the sound of water: slow, rhythmic, alive. But beneath it came something else. Faint. A murmur rising and falling with the pulse of the earth.

I sat up, heart pounding, straining to hear.

The whisper came again, clearer this time.

*“Alex.”*

My name, pulled through stone, stretched by distance and something deeper. The sound wasn’t cruel or kind—it was lonely. Ancient. And it sounded like… Hailey.

I pressed my hand to the floor. A faint draft slid through a crack and brushed my wrist.

There was water beneath us, running somewhere close, whispering through the dark.

Where there was water, there would be tunnels.

The water whispered my name again. And I wasn’t sure if it wanted saving or company. Maybe it was a way out. Maybe it was a promise to drag us down with it.

***— Day 8 —***

Nick woke first.

He didn’t speak, just sat there rubbing the heel of his hand against his forehead like he was trying to erase a dream. The lantern had burned out sometime in the night, and the room looked smaller in the thin gray light seeping through the vent.

I told him what I’d heard: the voice, the way it said my name through the stone.

He didn’t look at me while I talked. When I finished, he just laughed once under his breath, no humor in it.

“In case you forgot, I butchered her with my own hands. There’s no way it could be her,” he said, sarcasm laced with grief. “And if it was her, why the hell would she call *your* name?”

I hesitated. “Because I promised her I’d have her back.”

That made him look up. The light caught in his eyes, red-rimmed and raw. “You and her had promises?”

“It was stupid. Just something we said out in the field before… everything. Just that if anything happened, we’d look out for each other. That’s all.”

He stared for a long time, breathing through his nose like he was steadying himself. Then, quieter, almost gentle.

“You always were the responsible one. Thanks for lookin’ out for her, little brother.”

That hit harder than anything else he could’ve said. 

We sat there for a while, the silence filling back in between us.

Later, he reached for the tin bowl I’d set aside and forced himself to eat a few bites. Small progress, but it felt like breath returning to a body that had already gone cold.

***— Day 9 —***

The door opened early.

Ruth came down without a word, the key already turning before I’d even sat up. She took Nick first, like always.

The silence that followed was dense. I counted the drips in the drain, traced the same cracks I’d memorized days ago. The cellar’s breathing changed sometimes: slow, like it was waiting for something.

When Ruth came back for me that evening, I followed her up the steps. The air outside the cellar stung my nose, so clean it hurt.

They shoved me into the shower. Clean clothes were left on the counter, and Ruth stood just beyond the door—silently guarding the windowless room.

Then they brought me to Elenor’s room. The curtains were tied back, sunlight pooling on the floor. Someone had changed the bedding, laid out flowers in a chipped vase. Elenor sat on the bed, wearing a pale green dress I’d never seen before. It fit her perfectly.

She smiled when she saw me—small, uncertain—but it was real.

We talked at first, about nothing. About anything except the situation that we were in. Every word was a thread back to something human, something normal. 

When we touched, it wasn’t desperate. It was careful, like we were both afraid of shattering what little of ourselves we still had left. Between movements, she whispered, “Do you think anyone’s looking for us?”

“Even if they are, I don’t know how’d they find us,” I said.

She nodded, like she’d already known that answer.

She traced my hand with her finger. “It’s easier if you don’t think of me as me,” she said softly.

“I can’t do that.”

“Then it’s just going to hurt worse.”

We did what we had to do.

When Ruth came for me again, Elenor didn’t say goodbye. She just smoothed the blanket over her knees and looked out the window like she was memorizing the light.

***— Day 20 —***

Another ten days passed in the cellar. The marks I scratched into the wall lost meaning after the fifth; they could’ve all been the same day for how little changed between them.

Harlan came once with blankets and a tin of salve, eyes on the woodgrain instead of us. His hand brushed the beam beside the stairs like a man checking for rot. “Roots find their way,” he murmured, and I couldn’t tell if it was comfort or a message.

Abel followed with cornbread that smelled of sunlight. He studied the room like he was appraising a structure that might collapse. “Patience keeps a place standing,” he said. He wasn’t cruel about it. That made me hate him even more.

Ruth became routine: taking Nick first each morning, bringing him back silent and hollow-eyed, then fetching me at dusk. The house above was always spotless, the air sharp with soap and lemon. They cleaned the rot but never the guilt.

Elenor was dressed differently every time. Pear-colored sleeves one night, cream the next, each dress softer, more delicate, as if they were trying to make her into something fragile enough to worship. We talked about anything except the truth. She said the birds outside sounded like the trees were singing through them. 

Once she asked whether time passed the same for us. I told her it only moved for me when the door opened.

We never said goodbye anymore.

Nick and I fell into the same rhythm—eating in silence, sleeping in shifts. He started talking in his sleep, half-conversations with people who weren’t there: Hailey, our mother, sometimes no one. I counted the breaths between his words so I’d know he was still alive.

We tried to make small talk once, sitting on the floor with the last crust of bread. He reminded me of the time we jumped the creek and I split my chin. We laughed—really laughed—for the first time since Hailey. It didn’t last.

I dreamt of the stag, its hooves sank into black water, its lungs expanded with the room. When I told Nick, he said he dreamed of Silas—standing over him, grinning, knife glinting like a second mouth.

One day, Elenor was reading a mystery with a cracked spine, she loved to read, I was glad. She smiled without showing her teeth. We did what we had to do.

That night Nick asked if the water had a heartbeat. I told him yes. He didn’t laugh.

By the tenth day, Ruth’s knock had gone soft, almost polite. Elenor’s new dress was white, her knuckles split and healing. Someone had made sure she wouldn’t raise her hands at them again. She smiled when she saw me: small, practiced. When it was over, I told her I’d get her out. She turned toward the window and said, “Don’t make it worse.”

***— Day 35 —***

Fifteen more days passed.

The door hadn’t opened for the last four.

We stopped counting after the second. There was nothing left to measure except the sound of our stomachs and the slow trickle through the drain.

Before that, the days had blurred so perfectly they could have been copies of each other: Ruth’s knock, the clean clothes, the silence afterward. Nick and I spoke less, but what we did say carried more weight. A single joke felt like rebellion. He’d started carving shapes into the beam beside his cot—nothing clear, just restless motion made permanent.

Sometimes I think they wanted to wear us down to the grain, to see what shape we’d take when everything else was stripped away.

Elenor had changed too. Each visit she seemed smaller inside herself, her voice softer, her eyes turning glassy with the same distant calm the family wore. I told myself she was surviving. I think she was surrendering.

One afternoon Mae was there with her—sitting next to Elenor like a shadow cast in daylight, their hands clasped together. They spoke in low voices until Mae looked up and saw me. “You see?” she said, smiling. “She’s learning peace.”

I asked what she was telling her. Mae only said, “That kindness will outlast defiance.”

When she left, Elenor whispered, “She’s cruel, but she’s not wrong.” I wanted to shout, but the words never came. Instead, I sat beside her and held her hand until Ruth returned.

Now, with the door still closed above us, I couldn’t decide what was worse: that they had forgotten us, or that they were waiting for something. Maybe they wanted to see if we’d start eating the jars on the shelves, or each other. Maybe they were listening through the vents, waiting for the moment we stopped speaking altogether.

Nick thought it was punishment. I thought it was a test of endurance. Either way, the cellar had grown quieter. Even the water seemed to hold its breath.

I kept dreaming of movement beneath the floorboards—a pulse deep and patient, like the earth remembering our names. If we were being forgotten, it wasn’t by the land. It still knew exactly where we were.

***— Day 41 —***

Elenor was pregnant.

It was the only answer that made sense. Our usefulness had run out, and now they were letting us starve before they carved the rest of our purpose out of us. Breed, then butcher. That was the rhythm of this place.

The hunger worked its way into everything. It lived behind my eyes, kneaded itself into my ribs, made the floor tilt if I stood too fast. Nick tried to ration the jars on the shelves, but even counting them felt pointless. The water in the jug was nearly gone too, though the sound of it moving under the floor never stopped: steady, taunting.

We didn’t talk much. Words took energy. But we stayed close, leaned back-to-back on the cold stone so we wouldn’t drift too far into our own heads. Hunger made solitude feel like drowning.

I must’ve slept—really slept—for the first time in days, because when Nick shook me awake, I couldn’t tell what hour it was. The lantern had burned out. The only light came from the blue cold leaking through the vent.

His face hovered above mine, gray and drawn, eyes too wide.

“I heard her,” he whispered.

My stomach dropped. “Hailey?”

He nodded. The movement was small, but desperate. “She said my name. Not like a dream. Like she was right under us—calling up through the floor.”

I sat up, the cold cutting through the fog in my head. “You’re sure?”

“I know the difference,” he said, voice cracking at the edges. “I know what I’ve made up. This wasn’t that.”

Something in him steadied when he said it—like an anchor finally hitting the ocean floor.

I pressed my palm flat to the stone. The draft through the cracks brushed my wrist, colder than before. The whisper wasn’t there now, but the *movement* was. The pulse.

Nick let out a shaking breath. “She’s down there, Alex. I don’t know how, but… she’s down there.”

He didn’t have to finish the thought. The family hadn’t taken Hailey’s body to bury it. They’d taken it *somewhere*. And the tunnels ran under everything, that was the only hope we had.

It was Nick who found the way out. Once he focused, his carpenter brain kicked in like a second heartbeat. He crawled under the butcher’s table, tapping along the floor with his knuckles, slow and methodical.

“Here,” he said after a minute, voice low with certainty. He pressed his knuckles to a seam in the stone. The sound changed—hollow, like breath caught in a throat.

We pulled the table aside. The legs screeched against stone loud enough to make us both freeze, listening for footsteps. Nothing came.

Together we pried at the seam with our fingers, then a broken spoon handle, then the thin hooked end of an old wrench that had fallen behind the shelves. The slab shifted first—just a millimeter. Then more. The air that rose through the gap smelled like cold iron and wet roots.

Nick leaned over the opening, breathing hard. “There’s space. A tunnel, maybe. I can feel air moving.”

Air meant passage. Passage meant a way forward.

I knelt beside him, staring into the black.

“We’ll get her,” I said.

“Both of them,” he answered.

For the first time since the cellar door closed behind us, he met my eyes without looking away.

We didn’t smile. We didn’t celebrate. We didn’t speak again.

We just kept widening the gap, our fingers bled as we worked. Two starved brothers carving an exit into the belly of the land that had swallowed us whole.
