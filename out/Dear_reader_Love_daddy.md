Dear diary, 
I found this strange list of rules framed in a wooden box in my bedroom. I feel connected to it in many different ways, it feels too familiar to my brain, and I have been thinking about it ever since I read the letter. The letter read: 

Dear reader, I am excited for you to finally read these list of rules for being my daughter/son. No matter what age you are in real life you will be 9 years old here, and you will age like normal here but you will not age in your reality. The rules for entering this reality are:

1: You go to sleep thinking about how you will get a new family.

2: You will not tell anyone about these rules or what your about to do.

3: If you get a nightmare, you succeeded.

4: You will wake up from the nightmare inside your new room.

Be aware that if you are willing to enter all your problems will go away, if you have depression, anxiety or anything else it, it will all disappear while your here, if you survive until 18 in my house, all your problems will not disappear when your back to your reality. If you survive till your 21 all your problems will disappear in your reality. Keep in mind the fact that if your die at any point during your stay, you will die in your reality.
Now for the people that will live in the house.

MOTHER: Mother is a character that will not take disrespect, if you do not do everything she wants you to do, she will injure you are even kill you.

BIG SISTER: Big sister will help you if mother is angry, but if you go into her room when she's not in it, she will snitch on you to mother, then she will not help you.

TWIN SISTER: Her birthday is the 1st of December, DO NOT WISH HER HAPPY BIRTHDAY. 

FATHER (ME): There are no rules for me yet you will understand me later when your finally here.

FAMILY DOG: The dog doesn't like you, don't try and be close to it.

Eventually me and mother will get into a argument, you will be age 13-15 if your any younger or older, kill yourself, your faith is way worse if you stay here. I hope that you decide to visit me for the 9-12 years you will be here. 

LOVE DADDY

What the fuck is that list, should I try this, no I don't know. 
Maybe I should, my anxiety is way too strong to not do this, I'll give it a try....
I'll probably try this at night.

Dear diary, 
I am about to try the thing the letter was talking about. I am in bed right now thinking about my new family while writing this, they will be so nice to me, I have not told anyone about these rules yet, I am hoping this will work, but I despise being scared.

Dear diary, 
I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE LIST OF RULES AND I WAS THERE FOR 12 YEARS, I DIDNT HAVE ACCESS TO MY DIARY THERE BUT NO TIME HAS PASSED HERE. THE AMOUNT OF TIMES I HAVE ALMOST DIED FROM MY MOTHER GETTING ANGRY. I AM NOW OFFICIALLY FREE FROM MY ANXIETY AND MY ABUSIVE MOTHER, SHE IS NOW NOT ABUSIVE.
