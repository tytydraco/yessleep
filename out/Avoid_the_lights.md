Avoid the Lights

Throughout history, humans have relied on stars to guide them home. They are reliable. They fascinate us. Light is supposed to be safe, and the dark is where the unnatural things happen. But when you walk in the forest at night, you need to avoid the lights. Not the stars, the lights.


Morgan was on a camping trip with her friends. It was a beautiful area, mountains everywhere and forest cover as well. She noticed something weird as she was driving into the area. At night, no one had lights on outside or in the house. It was like the town had a curfew. 

When Morgan and her friends went to town for a meal, the closing time for the diner was 30 minutes before twilight. Although there was a campsite, it was poorly tended abd there were no outside lights for the bathrooms.

It was very unusual. Why didn't they have any lights for night time? Were they afraid of putting lights up at night?

Morgan finally decided to question a local about it, because she was so curious. They were very tight-lipped and wouldn't answer her questions. Finally, after a lot of pestering, she got a response. "The lights are dangerous. They are territorial, and they get jealous". It sounded crazy. But the local looked dead serious. The tone of his voice was chilling. Morgan asked "what are you talking about? Is this just a legend to spook tourists?" The man just responded with, "don't use a light in the forest, and don't follow the lights if you see them". 

Morgan was unnerved and didn't know what to think of this new information. It sounded like a joke or an urban legend, but the local was so serious. Her friends completely laughed it off. Still, no one used a flashlight at night.

A couple nights later, Morgan had to pee really badly. So bad that she couldn't hold it in anymore. All the nights before she was able to hold it and stay in the relative safety of her tent. But she couldn't this night. She grabbed her phone and went into the dark to go to the bathroom. When the bathroom was in sight, she tripped and fell. She knew her leg was cut but she couldn't see how bad. She didn't know if she should walk on it or not. She had to look at her leg, so she convinced herself that the story was superstition and turned on her phone flashlight. Her leg had a large cut, but it was good enough to walk on.

She stood up and started to walk back to her tent, when a light flashed brightly in her peripheral vision. She got scared so she started to walk back. She suddenly heard whispers and then there was another flash of light. She sped up, but more flashes of light started blinding her and the whispers got steadily louder. She started sprinting. But the voices were getting louder and louder, and the lights were flashing non stop so brightly. She could only see small a small tunnel throughout the light. It was almost like the flashes were directing her somewhere. All of a sudden, the flashes stopped as well as the voices.

Morgan spun around in a circle. She was in the middle of the forest, completely lost. She was terrified, panting and trying to catch her breath. It was pitch dark. All of a sudden, the whispers started up again. At first, they were quiet whispers. "Don't look at the light, don't look at the light". "Why did I look at the light?" Then there was a quiet panicked shout. "Close Your Eyes!" Morgan did. 

And then there was a flash of the brightest white light behind her eyelids. The voices got louder. Some were cries of despair, that they looked at the lights. Others were pleads not to open her eyes. Then there were light suggestions to just release the pressure on her eyelids, because her eyes were getting so tired from being squeezed shut. The voices escalated until they were screaming. Deafening cries. "HELP ME!!" "DON'T OPEN YOUR EYES!!" "WHY! WHY DID I DO IT?!" "LET ME LEAVE!!" "OPEN YOUR EYES!!!! OPEN YOUR EYES!!!! OPEN YOUR EYES!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Morgan stood with her eyes squeezed shut for what felt like an eternity with the voices screaming relentlessly. She thought she would go insane. The voices wouldn't stop and the light was so bright, that it hurt even with her eyes closed. It was hours, days, years that she stood there with her eyes closed. She tried her best, but she just couldn't take the screaming anymore and she opened her eyes.


Morgan's friends couldn't find her in the morning. They searched everywhere. They finally found her phone dropped in a clearing in the woods with the flashlight on. That was all they ever found of her. They reported Morgan as missing. She was never seen again.


Don't use a flashlight in the forest. Don't follow the lights. If they flash, don't open your eyes. If you follow the lights, you will hear a soft voice say, "don't make the same mistake as me, don't open your eyes".
