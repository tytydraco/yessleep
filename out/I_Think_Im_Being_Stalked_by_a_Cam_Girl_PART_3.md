Where have I been for the past 3 weeks? God, even reading that question is forcing me to relive the past week all within a fraction of a second. I’m sorry I’ve had to leave you this long but forgive me for saying I don’t feel sorry for holding onto the hope that I wouldn’t have to update here again. For those of you who haven’t read my previous posts, I'll include the links below. Still, with how long I’ve been away I suppose we all need a refresher of the events thus far including me. When I was 14, I was messaged by a Cam Girl with the username “Rebecca69XOXO”. I was added to a group chat with 36 other people from my school and unbeknownst to me, this would begin a 6-year-long saga of mental torture and the decline of my physical well-being. Rebecca has continued to contact me with personalised messages all in accompaniment of a link. It’s now reached the frequency of 2,000 messages, 1,000 emails, and now recently 30 missed calls. Rebecca is a chatbot. At least that’s how her messages came across. I’ve been holding on to the belief that she acts biologically despite being shackled to the boundaries of all things electrical or internet-connected. Coincidence or not, the fact that Ian “tripped” in a pile of cables and was choked to death by the entanglement speaks volumes to me after the memory of him yelling about pressing a link has left me in a perpetual loop of restless nights and frequent nightmares were I instead take Ian’s place.

 

Ian’s funeral was for lack of a better word, desolate. His mother held herself together as best she could, but after discovering quickly that I would be the only guest outside of their family she broke down in a puddle of tears wailing for her son to come back. I only hope she won’t be made a target for Ian as I am. He continues to message me every day, at least whatever’s taken over his account is. In comparison to Rebbeca’s messages, however, Ian seems to be in his infancy as he is yet to adapt to the art of personalised messages and instead relies on the frequency of the same message.

I fix computers same day and to an exceptional standard, click the link to visit my page :)

 

As for the phone calls left by Rebbeca, I’ve never answered them. The habit of not answering the phone unless I have it saved has done me wonders up until now. I have, however, listened to the voice messages left by her. All of them appear like this, and all of them are always read by the monotone robotic speech pattern of most scam call centres or automated systems.

 

“Please…Message…. please message, Pl- Mess- Message, Be- leave Me-, Pl- Mess- Message.”

 

All your comments on the previous post have really put me at ease, and for a while, I believed most of you who said I wasn’t in any danger. I take that all back now.

 

My university organises a skiing trip each year at the Lombardy Ski resort in Italy. Seeing how worn down I’ve become over the past few weeks and given how hard I’ve been working this year on my engineering course; my parents gifted me the money to attend the trip as a job well done. When they told me, with money in hand, I couldn’t help but cry tears of joy hugging them both and running upstairs darting around my room gathering things to pack. I decided that I would use this trip as an excuse to get away from my phone for a while, hence the reason I’ve been away for so long. I left my phone in my suitcase the entire trip except for now. With no confirmation of a “read” alert, Rebecca has found another way to reach me.

 

I never realised how hard skiing was, and I never realised until now how utterly shocking my level of balance was since I couldn’t last all of 3 seconds on the slope without barrelling into a tree or one of my classmates. However, after two weeks of none stop skiing day in and day out, I’m proud to say that I’m off the beginner slopes and on to the intermediate alongside two of my classmates who I’ve quickly made friends with given our shared relatability of having a face full of snow every few minutes. James was a first-year studying the History of Art, and Liam was a third year studying Sports Science. Put us on campus and we’d likely, and probably already did, walk past each other without a second glance or fleeting thought. I didn’t tell them about Rebecca. This trip was supposed to be a pallet cleanser if you will. A detox of all things electronic, despite having to grin and bear the countless pictures James took of the three of us for his Instagram. Yet, that’s not to say I didn’t learn anything. One of the evenings Liam managed to steal a couple beers from the hotel lobby bar while the bartender was busy flirting with one of our lecturers. He told us the whole story about how he was leaning across the entire length of the table holding her hand and turning the ring from side to side making it glisten in the light all while she glared at him disgusted making numerous attempts to withdraw her hand. We all laughed knowing that Mrs Green would likely use the situation to flex how she still looks youthful despite pushing 50.

 

“Come on Mat tell us who you like.”

 

“Yeah!”

 

We were all severely blitzed by this point with Liam making occasional re-supply runs back to the bar all while expanding the never-ending rolodex of the bartender’s attempts to flirt with guests.

 

“Come on guys, seriously?”

 

“Yeah! First it was me then it was James, now it’s you”

 

“Fine, fine……Tracy Lin”

 

“Ohhhhh dude, don’t let Brad hear you say that. That guy’s gone completely psycho over that girl.”

 

“What? Seriously?”

 

“Errr yeah! Didn’t you hear?”

 

“Hear what?” James said perking up.

 

“You didn’t hear it from me, but I heard that Brad stood her up at a restaurant and then ghosted her for a week. They said she hadn’t messaged him for a while since…. I don’t know, it was something about how she didn’t think she should be the one to message first because he was the one who was in the wrong and blah blah blah. Anyway, she did eventually message him only now he won’t stop messaging her about his OnlyFans and trying to get her to visit his page.”

 

My blood ran cold.

 

“And did she?”

 

“No, no, she started dating a new guy though. I can’t remember the name. Says she’s being messaged by Brad’s girlfriend though. Some girl called… Rachel? Rose? Re…”

 

“Rebecca?”

 

“Yeah, that’s the one! Says she’s been ignoring them both but they’re both just as crazy as each other stalking her page and whatnot.”

 

“Man, that’s sick!” James said reeling in his seat and laughing, his rosy cheeks a beet-red under the lamplight.

 

I tried shaking away the thoughts that she was dealing with the same Rebecca as me. Sweat dribbled down my temple, wiping it away, and sitting back I nervously laughed along with James all while my mind was waging war drawing lines and filing away new evidence for my theories.

 

I didn’t sleep well that night. Something that would later lead to my downfall on the slopes. In a lapse of judgment, my head throbbing from last night, I raised my hand when the lecturer asked who wanted to go down the expert slopes that morning. My thoughts jumbled up in a cloud I barely registered the nervous eyes James and Liam threw my way as I clumsily picked up my skis and stumbled over to the ski lift not questioning why they didn’t join me. Only when I reached the top, my classmates and lecturer already speeding down the slope, did the fog lift and my vision clear as I stood eyes wide staring at the frozen mouth before me. My stomach sank, and the sudden sensation of needing to go to the bathroom caused my legs to buckle as I hopelessly watched the out-of-reach ski-lift which remained empty for miles down the line.

 

“HELP! HELP ME!”

 

There was no way I was going down the slope. The rock formations, sharp and jagged erupted from within the snow like the unlined teeth of the already bone-chilling mouth littered with cavity pitfalls at odd intervals. My eyes darting along the tree line that lined either side of the slope I made out the low red glow of the emergency lights highlighted to us by our instructors. They told us that if we were to ever lose our way off the slope then we should look to the red lights and follow their trail for the cables should lead us back to sanctuary within the resort.

 

Stumbling through the snow, the biting frost stinging my cheeks and lips which were beginning to grow numb I trudged my way beneath the canopy. Providing little shelter, it failed to shield the relentless force of the wind as it sent the top layer of snow spiralling up into the air and cascading over the spines of the tree branches. I endeavoured to keep my eyes open leaving my snow goggles behind in my drunken stupidity as the wind picked up and the snow continued to spiral into a whirlwind of blinding despair. Each step I took felt as if I was escaping quicksand, the settling snow burying my feet and beginning to reach my calf. My whole body shivered against the cold, creating a disjointed jigsaw of unmatching pieces of piercing cold and the beginning of what I believed to be the start of hypothermia as parts of my body broke out in such intense heat I felt as if I were melting. I understand now why my classmates left so quickly. Why no one else braced for the summit. I was in the jaws of the slope. I was in a blizzard. It was likely unforeseen, but I don’t know how much I missed with how dazed I was earlier.

 

I had now passed lamp post number 12, the red glow of number 13 barely visible as frost doused my eyelashes and obscured my vision.

 

“Help!”

 

I felt my body beginning to give up.

 

“Help me!”

 

“Please!.....” A woman’s voice broke through the tempest. The following words were dragged away down the slope by the roaring wind.

 

My heart ignited with hope my feet bulldozing through the snow towards the lamp post sending piles of snow flying through the air.

 

“I’m Here! I’m here!”

 

“Please!....”

 

“I can't hear you!”

 

“Please!...”

 

The remnants of my vision drove my feet towards the light I squinted to see as I pushed through the remaining branches that obscured the base of lamp post 13.

 

“I’m here! Oh thank Go-“

 

Rooted at the base was a girl in a grey tank top, everything below her waist buried in the snow. Her short brown hair curled at her shoulders only highlighting further the unnatural orange tint of her skin, almost as if someone had taken a picture of her and increased the exposure. She remained frozen in place without any protective gear or a sliver of discomfort against the elements. She didn’t shiver, she didn’t blink, she didn’t frown. Her large brown eyes remained fixed on me as if swallowing me whole, her uniform pearl-white teeth a constant reminder that she was happy to see me.

 

I retreated falling over in the snow, my heart pounding out of my chest, my eyes fighting to widen against the wind. My body could barely react. Every sense, muscle, and fibre was frozen in time numbed by the cold; all I could do was cry but even that added another element of frost to my already battered face.

 

“Pl- Mess- Message!”

 

Press message. She was trying to say a press message. My stomach was close to falling out of me as I scrambled to stand.

 

“Please! Please! Please!”

 

Her robotic voice like a rattlesnake shaking its tail in my ear ignited every reaction of my flight or fight response, but my body couldn’t do anything as all passageways remained blocked off. I couldn’t handle it anymore.

 

“What the hell do you want!? Why can’t You just leave me alone!?” I balled my fists with what effort I could muster taking a single step towards her.

 

“Please!”

 

She raised her hands wide ready to embrace me.

 

“Jesus Christ! What the hell are you!?”

 

Unhinging her jaw her teeth separated for the first time revealing a dark bottomless abyss. My hands shot up to my ears the noise piercing my ear drums reverberating throughout my body, her eyebrows narrowed along her unchanged eyes in fury as she screamed. It was supersonic, static even, it cut through the ensued chaos the red light intensifying until it burst showering glass down from above and cutting the backs of my hands and cheek. I screamed as loud as I could, I didn’t know what else to do but try and scare her to stop. We were at a stalemate, screaming atop the slope the blizzard all around until a hand was placed on my shoulder. She didn’t stop screaming. The red high-vis jacket of the rescue officer brushed past me in a panic carrying a blanket and darting over to Rebecca placing his hand on her shoulder. I didn’t have any time to react. He remained motionless obscuring Rebecca from view as thick black cords wrapped around his arms and legs his screams rivalling her own. The cords wrapped around his limbs like snakes coiling and tightening in thick knots causing a sudden violent display as his wet bone popped tearing through his jacket in a spray of blood across the pure white snow. He… he asked me to help. I couldn’t hear him over Rebecca, but I knew he was screaming for help his head thrashing around violently amidst the tangle of cables. Finally, two cords raised high above the lamp post plunged down sharply into his head and out of the back wrapping around it entirely and in one quick motion dragging him beneath the snow along with Rebecca.

 

The rest of the team found me shortly afterward and carried me down the slope on the back of their snowmobiles. I didn’t know what to tell them. They asked if I had seen their colleague, and I just told them that I saw what looked like a red figure fall in the snow. I didn’t tell them about Rebecca or the cables. I didn’t tell them how their colleague… their friend… died. They would never believe me. It was better for them to believe their friend died in the blizzard than be made a mockery by me telling them about what really happened. They would have thought I was knitting them a lie. A thank you present for saving me. Truth is I don’t think I could face telling them the story even if I tried. So this is it. A tribute to the officer. A man who showed willingness and courage to save others even at the cost of his own life.

 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve asked you for help and you’ve given me the world and more, but I think your solutions have run dry. All I can do now is report back to you. Maybe then I can get the word out. Maybe then I can save some of you. Since writing this I’ve noticed that I’ve been tagged in all of James’ posts on Instagram alongside countless messages by Rebecca. I think she used James to track me.
