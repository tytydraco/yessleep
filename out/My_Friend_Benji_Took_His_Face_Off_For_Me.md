“Hey…” Benji said looking down at the ground. “Do you want to see something?”  
Benji had been my friend for as long as I could remember, we had been friends since diapers. Our parents, even longer than that. We had been through everything together, happiness and heartbreak, terrible times and favorite memories, Benji was more than my friend, he was my family.   
We first met on the playground in the second grade, I was proudly showing off my yugioh collection when he walked up and challenged me to a duel. After that we became inseparable.   
Years had passed, girls had come and gone, college and careers had started, and through all of it Benji and I were always at each other's side. He stood up in my wedding, and I was there to help when his Mom passed, he was the only person I felt I could truly trust.   
“Yeah dude, definitely, what’s up?” I replied.   
I would give anything to take back those words, to have told Benji I needed to leave actually, and continue my life as a happy normal person.   
Instead, I said “yeah dude, definitely whats up?” and the moment those words left my lips Benji smiled.    
He reached his hand up to below the jawline, and then he began pulling away at his own skin. I was confused at first till I heard a small wet “pop” and saw his olive colored skin pull away from his jawline.   
I felt my pulse quicken and I felt like I was about to throw up. I couldn’t even comprehend what I was watching, it was wrong, perverted.   
Benji’s expression shifted to a blank emotionless stare, not at me, but through me. It was like he couldn’t even see anymore as he pulled harder and harder, loosening up more and more of the face I once knew.   
I tried to get up out of my seat but couldn’t move my legs, I was locked in place unable to look away as everything I thought I knew was slowly peeled away.  
The wet pop’s and squelches continued as more of the flesh was pulled. I could start to see what was underneath my best friends face, but I didn’t understand what I was seeing. I thought it’d be faw flesh and bone but no, there wasn’t anything at all. It was completely smooth, not a single blemish or wrinkle. Just tan, flesh, so flat and reflective that I could see the edges of my own reflection in my best friends head.   
And in the dead center was a hole.   
I stared directly into it.   
I couldn’t take my eyes away from the single whole that bore deep into my best friends skull. That’s when I heard it, at first I thought it was someone knocking on the door but after a moment I realized it was coming from the depths of my friends crater.   
“Dok… dok… dok…..”   
Benji rang towards me.

  
“Dok… dok… dok… dok..”   
The noise started to get more frequent, more aggressive.   
“Dok. dok. dok . dok.”  
I felt paralyzed, I couldn’t lift a muscle, all I could do was stare and listen.   
“Dokdokdokdokdokdokdokdodokdokdokdokdokdokdokdokdokdokdokdokdokdokdokdok”  
Benji suddenly pounced at me and I felt my entire body suddenly shift back into reality as I braced myself.   
We slammed to the ground with Benji on top, the empty nest where my friends face once laid less than few inches from my own.   
“DOKDOKDOKDODKODOKDOKDOKDOKDOKDOKDOKDOKDOKDDOKDOKDOK”  
The sound was deafening, it felt like it was layering on top of itself, like there was multiple Benji’s screaming at once. Thats when I finally noticed what was making the strange overwhelming sound, deep inside the hole was a silver thin rod slamming against the sides of the tunnel inside my friends face. Each time it hit the walls of his flesh it would make the sickening “DOK!” sound and it was getting closer to the entrance of the whole.  
I panicked harder than I ever have before and somehow mustered the strength to throw Benji off me and back onto the couch. He flew back and slammed hard into the arm rest and suddenly the “DOK” sound stopped, Benji laid there slumped over now.   
Time seemed to last an eternity before I could get up the strength to run out the door. I ran as fast as I could down the block and locked my front door behind me.   
Suddenly I was alone.   
I collapsed right there and woke up several hours later in the hospital. The paramedics said my wife found me unresponsive in our living room.   
When they asked me what happened, I just told them I didn’t know. The truth is that I didn’t, how could I ever explain that my best friend pulled his own face off and what was beneath it.   
After about an hour of checking vitals and running test, the doctors said I had a visitor. My wife came rushing in sobbing and screaming at me for scaring her so badly. I wanted to comfort her and tell her I was okay. I wanted to, but I couldn’t.   
Because right after she collapsed into my arms, someone else walked in behind her.   
“You scared me dude! I thought I almost lost you there.” Benji said as he walked in and flashed a smile so fake that I could swear it was made of plastic.
