My son, Leo, is just shy of two. He’s at that age where he’s exploring everything, constantly chattering in his own little language, and still needs a nap every afternoon. We got him a video baby monitor, the kind with the pan and tilt camera, mostly for peace of mind. Our house is old, with thick walls, and sometimes it’s hard to hear him from the other end.

For the first few months, it was a godsend. We could see him settling down, watch him stir, and know when he was truly awake. Then, about a month ago, the static started.

It wasn't constant. Just little bursts, like someone was briefly rubbing two balloons together near the microphone. At first, I chalked it up to interference. We live in a fairly populated area, lots of Wi-Fi signals flying around. My husband, Mark, messed with the antenna, moved the receiver, the usual troubleshooting. It helped for a day or two, then the static would creep back in.

It was always during Leo’s naps, or late at night after we put him down for the night. Never during the day when he was awake and moving around. That was the first thing that made my skin crawl a little. Like something was only active when he was vulnerable, asleep.

The static gradually got… different. It still had that initial crackling sound, but it started to have a texture to it. Almost like a low hum underneath, a vibration. I know it sounds crazy, describing static like that, but that’s the only way I can explain it. It felt *heavy*.

Then came the voices.

Not actual words, not at first. Just indistinct murmurs buried within the static. Like a radio station fading in and out, too low to understand. I’d strain my ears, turning up the volume, trying to make out what was being said, but it was always just on the edge of comprehension. Mark said I was imagining things, that the static was just messing with my head. He’d listen, shrug, and say he heard nothing but noise.

But I heard it. And it was getting clearer.

One afternoon, Leo was napping. The static was particularly bad, that heavy, vibrating kind. And then, for a split second, cutting through the noise, I heard it. A whisper. Raspy, like someone with a sore throat. It sounded like it was right next to the microphone.

“Closer…”

That’s all it was. One word. But it hit me like a punch to the gut. I ripped the receiver off the nightstand and ran to Leo’s room, my heart hammering. He was sound asleep, curled up with his teddy bear, looking completely peaceful. I checked under the bed, in the closet, behind the curtains. Nothing. Just a quiet, sunny room.

I tried to convince myself it was the static playing tricks, a random sound that my overactive, sleep-deprived brain was interpreting. But the dread had taken root.

The whispers became more frequent. Sometimes it was just that single word, “Closer…” Other times, it was snippets of phrases, always hushed, always just on the edge of understanding. “He’s so… still…” “Just a little… touch…” “Don’t… wake him…”

I stopped telling Mark. He’d started looking at me with concern, suggesting I was stressed and needed more sleep. I didn’t want him to think I was losing it. So I suffered in silence, listening to the growing chorus of whispers in the static, each one a tiny ice pick to my sanity.

Then, the camera started moving on its own.

It would be subtle at first, just a slight shift in angle. I’d think I’d bumped the control dial accidentally. But then it became more deliberate. Slow pans across the room when Leo was sleeping, lingering on the empty corners, the shadows stretching on the walls. Sometimes, it would zoom in, slowly, agonizingly, on Leo’s face, his closed eyes.

I’d find myself glued to the monitor, watching the static dance and listening to the whispers, my finger hovering over the pan and tilt controls, trying to counteract the unseen hand guiding the camera. It felt like something was observing him, studying him.

Last night was the worst.

Leo had been restless, waking up a few times throughout the evening. Finally, around midnight, he settled down. I was exhausted, but I couldn’t bring myself to sleep. The static had been relentless all night, the whispers more insistent.

Then, I saw it.

On the monitor, in the corner of Leo’s room, something shifted in the shadows. It was subtle, a fleeting movement, but I saw it. A dark shape, elongated, almost like a hunched figure. It was too dark to make out details, but it was there.

And the camera started to move. Not panning, not tilting. It was rotating, slowly, deliberately, as if whatever was in the room was turning its head to look directly at the lens.

The static intensified, a roaring wave of white noise, and the whispers became a chorus, overlapping, frantic. I could almost make out words, but they were garbled, distorted, filled with a malevolent glee.

Then, one voice, clearer than the rest, cut through the static. It was right next to the microphone, that same raspy whisper I’d heard before.

“He smells so… fresh.”

The camera stopped rotating. It was pointed directly at the corner where I’d seen the shape. And the shape was gone.

But the static remained. And the whispers continued. And now, when I listen closely, I can hear something else mixed in with the noise. A faint, rhythmic sound.

Breathing.

Not Leo’s gentle, childlike breathing. This is slower, deeper, heavier. Like something large is standing just outside the range of the camera, its unseen chest rising and falling in the darkness.

I haven’t slept properly in weeks. I watch the monitor constantly, even when Leo is awake, terrified of what I might see or hear. Mark thinks I’m unraveling. He says it’s just the monitor malfunctioning, that we should get a new one.

But I know better. It’s not the monitor. It’s something else. Something that’s drawn to the vulnerability of sleep, to the innocence of a child. Something that’s hiding in the static, whispering its intentions, watching, waiting.

And I’m starting to think the static isn’t interference at all. It’s a way to mask its presence, to hide the sound of its breathing, the rustle of its movements in the shadows. It’s a way to communicate, to let me know it’s there, that it’s getting closer.

I can hear it now, even as I type this. The low hum, the crackling, the whispers just beneath the surface. And that slow, heavy breathing, a constant reminder that I’m not alone. That Leo isn’t alone.

And I’m terrified of what will happen when the static finally stops. When the whispers fall silent. When all that’s left is the sound of that breathing, growing louder, closer…

Because then, I’ll know it’s finally here. No more hiding. No more whispering.

Just… action. And I won’t be able to see it coming. Just like it wants. Just like it planned. Hidden in the static, until the very end.
