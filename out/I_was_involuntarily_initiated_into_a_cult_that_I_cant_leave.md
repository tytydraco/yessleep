Content warning: domestic violence, child abuse





My ex-boyfriend, Bobby, had post-traumatic stress stemming from a childhood spent in a cult. At first, he seemed like he had it under control. But after a while, he started to talk endlessly about a demon this cult would summon called Choronzon. Choronzon would disintegrate personalities and leave people questioning who they actually are, creating chaos and confusion where there was once order and clarity. On top of this, to summon him, the cult would ritually sacrifice children.





I’d implore him to go to therapy and see someone about medications. But he refused. He insisted he was fine. I didn't want to, but at a certain point, breaking up with him was my only choice. He genuinely frightened me whenever he’d get flashbacks.





Bobby freaked out when I told him our relationship was over. He even went so far as to lock me in the bathroom. He refused to let me out no matter how hard I banged at the door. This was new. He had never been violent like that before. He was crying, telling me Choronzon was after me. He kept telling me to remember my name and who I am. It was so heartbreaking. I had no choice but to call the police on him, and they took him to get involuntarily hospitalized at a psych ward.

I moved out of his apartment and went to stay at an AirBnb owned by a woman named Rain. She was an aging hippy. She had the number 333 tattooed on her neck. Her house was filled with crystals, tie-dye tapestries, and incense sticks placed before small, unfamiliar statues. It was a fairly cozy house. Hardwood floors, a fireplace, and a warm, rustic smell.





Almost every night I was there, I kept dreaming of a man at the foot of my bed. He had long, wiry gray hair and eyes that were disturbingly animalistic. He'd just stand there, at the foot of my bed, smiling menacingly.





\*\*\*





After a month, I moved into a room I found on Craigslist. It was in a house belonging to a woman who was moving to Europe for a few years. Single story, two bedrooms, a safe location, a big yard with a deck, and a view of the mountains. She said there was another woman moving into the other room with her son.





I was given this other tenant’s phone number. Her name was Laura. We agreed to meet before moving in with each other. 





We met up at a café. To tell you the truth, my heart was beating furiously when I first saw her. Golden hair and sultry blue eyes. I'd never been attracted to another woman until I saw her. She had an eight-year-old son, Leo, who clung to her side the whole time. He was quiet, black hair with a slight olive complexion, and a shy smile.





She explained she was at a domestic violence shelter. Her eight weeks of allotted time was coming to an end, and no one else wanted to rent her a room for herself and her son. She was thankful to find this room, as it was one of the few places she could actually afford.





She was so stunningly beautiful, I was actually nervous while speaking with her.





\*\*\*





The landlady left. A week later, Laura moved in.





Her parents helped her. It was funny because I recognized them immediately. They were friends of Rain. They used to visit her, drink wine, and sing by the backyard fire. Laura’s mother drove me to work that night, my first shift actually. I had just gotten a job working nights at a small hotel about a mile away. I noticed Laura’s mother had 333 tattooed on her neck just like Rain.





\*\*\*





Everything was going smoothly at first with Laura. We actually became quite good friends fairly quickly. We'd watch movies together. We’d sit on the deck out back wrapped in blankets and drink tea while staring at those beautiful mountains before us. She told me about her ex, how controlling he was, how she finally found the courage to leave.





I told her a little bit about Bobby, though I kept the cult stuff vague. I didn't want her to think I was crazy for dating someone like that. 





Laura still talked to her ex, the man who put her in the shelter. I’d hear her talking on speaker phone with him. I actually felt proud of her. She didn’t sound scared of him. He, rather, sounded scared of her. She kept telling him not to come around, and if he did dare show his face, she’d be sure to have him “taken care of”. The truly bizarre thing, though, was that her ex's voice sounded remarkably like Bobby's.





\*\*\*





Laura started getting close to me. Really close.





She’d hug me for too long. Brush her fingers against my arm. Compliment how I smelled. One night she sat next to me on the couch, and said, “You’re beautiful.”





I laughed it off, nervously. But she wasn’t laughing.





The next day, I woke up to her standing at the foot of my bed, watching me. I was startled. But when I realized it was her, all fear vanished. She said she heard me crying in my sleep. I kept repeating someone’s name. I told her I was fine. She got into my bed. She started kissing me. Something happened; I fell into her embrace. I kissed her back madly and passionately, like I was dying of thirst in a desert and her lips were an oasis I could swim in.





She lay in my bed with me until I had to wake up later in the afternoon. We were just holding each other. I woke up to find her drawing “333” on my shoulder with a black marker. She said it was a lucky number, and she was drawing it on me to “protect me”. 





\*\*\*





I called Bobby at the hospital he was in, asking if he was okay and doing better. A part of me really missed him. He told me the doctors felt he was improving significantly and that he’d be released soon. He even thanked me for forcing him to get the help he needed. This made me so happy to hear. I told him where I moved to. I told him about Laura, leaving out the fact that I was starting to get romantically involved with her.





"Laura?" he said. There was a long pause. "What's her last name?"





"Why?” I asked.





Another pause. "And she has a son?"





"Yeah, Leo. He's eight. Bobby, what's this about?"





"You two aren't kissing, are you?"





I laughed off the suggestion, but, internally, I was perplexed about what prompted that question. 





Before I could ask him anything else, he said, "I need to go," and hung up.





\*\*\*





A few days later, I came home from work and found Laura in the living room. And she was in the living room with a man. He had his back to me. I noticed she was holding him at gunpoint.





“Who’s this?” I asked. “What’s going on?”





“It’s my ex,” she explained. “He broke in.”





She pointed over to a broken window in the living room.





I was shocked.





“Wait a minute, he’s not the one that put you in that domestic violence shelter, is he?”





“Yes,” Laura said, “he is actually.”





He turned around. I was speechless. I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was my ex, Bobby. Laura looked up at him. She could tell how startled I was.





“You know her?” she asked him.





He shook his head. “I never met her before,” he responded.





He was looking at the ground, avoiding eye contact. He looked nervous. He was scared of Laura.





“Bobby?” I said. “What are you doing? Of course you know me.”





“My name’s not Bobby,” he said. “It’s James.”





He had the same voice, the same eyes, the same everything as Bobby.





“Maybe I just look like this ‘Bobby,’” he said. 





“Sometimes we see things that aren’t there,” Laura said. “It’s better to not trust your judgment especially if you aren’t sleeping well.”





Her eyes pierced me. I felt like staring deep into them sent me into a trance. I told myself maybe what she said was true. I was probably imagining things. After all, I never truly adjusted to working nights and sleeping during the day.





“He was just about to leave,” Laura said.





Laura shot an angry glare at James (or was it Bobby?). “I am done with your abuse!” she snapped. “I’m taking you to the bus station, and I don’t want to see you ever again!”





They both left. He looked back at me, concerned. I just went to my room and shut the door. I was beyond exhausted. I felt like I was losing my grip on reality. There was no way that was Bobby, right? If it was him, why would he deny it? Also, I’m fairly certain I didn’t even give him my address. Or did I? When I spoke with him? I couldn’t remember. I closed my eyes. I started falling asleep.





\*\*\*





An hour later, there was pounding at the front door. I answered. It was James (or Bobby). Laura was nowhere to be seen. I was trying to wake up and make sense of the situation. I couldn’t even hear what he was saying at first, as I was still groggy and confused. It wasn't long before the police showed up.





James (or Bobby) at first looked relieved. “Thank God, you’re here!” he said.





One officer asked me if I knew this man without realizing what a complicated question that was.





“We’ve received reports he was physically abusing a woman at the bus station,” the cop said.





“Well,” I said, “this man put my roommate into a domestic violence shelter, and she actually was just taking him to the bus station. I don’t know where she is currently.”





They put handcuffs on James (or Bobby).





“Please!” James (or Bobby) pleaded. “Let me explain! This isn’t what it looks like! I was trying to free myself from her!”





Then James (or Bobby) froze in fear. He started stuttering: “What’s that?”





All the officers had 333 tattooed on their necks just like Rain and Laura’s mother. They ignored his question and told him it was time to go.





As they were leaving, James (or Bobby) turned to me and said: “Leave, I’m begging you, just leave!”





The officers told him not to talk to me. They put him in the back of one of their cars. As they drove away, I could see him through the window, still trying to mouth something to me.





\*\*\*





Laura came back after they left. Her face was bruised.





“Did Bobby do that to you?” I asked, shocked at her appearance. “I mean, James?”





She limped over to the couch and fell down on it.





“Are you okay?” I asked.





“Don’t worry,” Laura said, blankly staring into the distance.





“The police were just here. They arrested James.”





“I hope they keep him locked up for a long time.”





“Do you need to go to the hospital?”





“No…” 





I sat next to her. I stroked her back. She started to cry in my arms. Her body was shaking.





“I just need you…” she said.





I kissed her forehead. She started to kiss me, and I was instantly consumed. We sat there desperately kissing each other. There was a tingling sensation running up and down my spine.





I pulled back and wiped the tears from her eyes. 





“Are you going to be okay?” I asked.





She nodded. I gave her one last kiss and went back to my room. 





\*\*\*





I fell asleep and dreamt of the man again. The one I’d dream about in the Airbnb. He was standing at the foot of my bed. His teeth gleamed in the dark as he laughed. He did something he never did before: he started walking towards me. He reached out his hand to caress my face.





When I woke up and started getting ready for work, I realized Laura and her son were nowhere to be found. I didn’t think much of it. Perhaps they were out somewhere.





But then, when I was at work, my landlady called and told me I only paid part of the rent. She then told me if I have trouble covering it, I could get a roommate.





“I already have one,” I said.





“Wait,” she said, her voice turning sharp, “you’ve been living with someone this whole time and you never told me? And they haven't signed a lease, paid the deposit, or the first month’s rent!”





 “You introduced me to her,” I shot back. “If she hasn't done the paperwork, that's on you.” 





My landlady paused. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”





I didn’t even know how to respond. I just asked if we could talk about this later, as I was working.





\*\*\*





I went inside. There was no one. Nothing of Laura’s was there. I knocked on her door. No answer. I opened it and found…it was empty. No bed, no drawers, no clothes. Nothing. Also, I saw the window that James (or Bobby) broke was completely fixed.





I was confused. Did I imagine everything that happened? Was it all a hallucination? I decided to go to sleep and try to figure it all out when I’d wake up.





But I couldn’t sleep. Every time I started to doze off, I’d feel Laura’s lips on my mouth.





I gave up after a while. It was my night off, so I dragged myself to the living room and put on the TV. I was too exhausted to think about everything that happened.





Then I thought I saw Leo staring at me from the corner of my eye. I turned to look, and he was gone. I picked up my phone. I saw it was 3:33 am.





The TV suddenly shut off.





A low, electric buzzing filled the room.





And then, clear as if she were right behind me, I heard Laura’s voice ask me in a mocking manner: “What happened?”





I froze.





When I turned around, the room was empty.





I checked the locks. Checked the windows. No sign of forced entry.





I even went into the basement. The attic. Every room. No one.





But when I went to the bathroom, there was that low, electric buzzing sound again, but this time it was much louder. I looked in the mirror. I didn’t see my reflection staring back at me…





I saw the man from my dreams.





I panicked. He was laughing. I started shouting: “No! No! This can’t be real!” He was laughing at me uncontrollably with a crazed look in his eyes. “Please, stop!” I cried, tears streaming down my face. 





\*\*\*





I woke up in my room, sat up, and looked around. I was relieved. It was just a nightmare. My phone was ringing. I answered. “Laura,” my landlady said, “I wanted to continue our conversation from the other night.” I was taken aback. “Did you just call me Laura?” I asked. 





“What?” my landlady said.  “That’s your name isn’t it?”





“No,” I responded, confused. “That’s my roommate’s name.”





“Are you okay?” she asked.





Then I tried to think of my name. But I couldn’t remember it. I just hung up without even saying goodbye. A cold sweat broke out on my neck. I was terrified, not knowing what was happening. What was my name? Why did she call me Laura?





I got my driver’s license and found it said my name was Laura.





I called work, and told them I wouldn’t be able to come in tonight.





“Um,” the manager of the hotel said. “You don’t work here.”





I hung up in shock and disbelief. Then the doorbell rang. I hurried to answer. And guess who was there? Laura. Before I could even say anything, she immediately began to scold me, telling me I needed to look after my son.





“My son?” I asked. “Wait, Laura? What are you doing?”





“Did you just call me Laura?” she asked. “That’s not my name. That’s your name.”





And from behind her, Leo appeared. The woman I could’ve sworn was Laura left saying, “Laura, I really don’t have time for this. Your son has been wandering around completely unsupervised.”





I noticed she had that 333 neck tattoo. I never saw this before on this woman who I thought was Laura.





I grabbed Leo’s hand and brought him inside.





I was speechless. He then started to use chalk to draw 333 on the living room floor.





I looked out the window. There were hooded figures standing around a bonfire in my backyard.





Leo looked up at me. His eyes glowed red.





A few of the hooded figures came inside from the back door. They grabbed me. They took me outside. They were chanting. Someone tilted my head to the side. I felt the sharp sting of a needle. I was given the 333 tattoo on my neck.





\*\*\*





When I was finally released and stumbled back into the house hours later, I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.





There it was. Fresh and still slightly red. 333 tattooed on my neck. I touched it. It was real.





In the mirror's reflection, I could see Leo standing in the hallway behind me, watching.





"Welcome home," he said.





Then he went limp and fell down. Out of his mouth, a spirit emerged that morphed into the man I had dreamt about. He was laughing again. And the worst part? The part that made my blood run cold? I was frightened and wanted to scream, but against my will I laughed with him. Which made me want to scream even more.





The light went out and turned back on. I was holding something in my arms…it was the corpse of Leo. He had been stabbed. Then I realized in my right hand, I was holding a knife that was covered in blood.





I could see the man standing behind me in the mirror. I felt his arms around me, but when I looked, he was nowhere to be seen. I looked back at the mirror. He was still there. He whispered, breathing against the nape of my neck: “There is no exit.”
