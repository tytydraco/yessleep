I always loved my cat, Skittles. We got her when I was eight, a sleek, black kitten with piercing yellow eyes that seemed to see right through you. From the moment I saw her, I felt a connection. Skittles was more than just a pet; she was my best friend. But over the years, strange things started happening, things I couldn’t explain.

It began with little things. Skittles would disappear for hours, only to reappear in places I was sure I had checked. At night, I’d sometimes wake up to find her sitting on my chest, staring at me with those unblinking eyes. It always felt like she was studying me, trying to understand something.

One night, when I was thirteen, I woke up to a soft noise. My room was dark, but I could see Skittles sitting by the window, her eyes glowing faintly. She was making a strange, low growling sound. I’d never heard her make that noise before. It sent chills down my spine.

I sat up and whispered her name. “Skittles?”

She turned to look at me, but something was different. Her eyes were too bright, almost like they were glowing from within. I reached out to her, and she backed away, growling louder. I felt a cold wave of fear wash over me. This wasn’t my cat.

The next day, I tried to shake off the feeling. Maybe it was just a bad dream, I told myself. But things only got stranger. I started hearing whispers in the middle of the night, faint and unintelligible. They seemed to be coming from everywhere and nowhere at once. Skittles would sit in the middle of my room, staring at me with those eerie eyes.

One evening, I decided to follow her. She slipped out of the house through a small gap in the back door, and I quietly trailed behind. She led me to the woods behind our house, moving with a purpose. It was dark, and I could barely see, but I kept going, driven by a mix of fear and curiosity.

We reached a small clearing, and Skittles stopped. She sat down and looked at me, her eyes glowing brighter than ever. The whispers grew louder, filling my head. I felt dizzy, like the ground was shifting beneath my feet.

Suddenly, Skittles stood on her hind legs. Her body started to change, stretching and twisting into something unrecognizable. I watched in horror as she transformed into a shadowy figure, still with those glowing, yellow eyes. The whispers turned into a chorus of voices, speaking in a language I couldn’t understand.

The figure spoke, its voice a low, raspy whisper that seemed to come from everywhere at once. “You have seen too much, David. You should not have followed.”

I tried to run, but my feet wouldn’t move. I was rooted to the spot, paralyzed with fear. The figure moved closer, its eyes boring into mine.

"Skittles?" I managed to whisper, my voice trembling.

The entity tilted its head, almost amused. "Skittles was never real. She was merely a vessel, a way to watch over you."

I felt a surge of cold terror. “Why? Why me?”

The entity's eyes glowed brighter, and the whispers around us grew deafening. “You are special, David. You have a gift, and I have been sent to guide you.”

I wanted to scream, to escape, but I couldn't move. The shadows around the entity seemed to grow, enveloping me in darkness. I closed my eyes, praying it was just a nightmare.

When I opened them, I was back in my room, lying in bed, drenched in sweat. Skittles was gone. The house was silent, but the feeling of being watched never left me. I never saw Skittles again, but sometimes, late at night, I still hear the whispers.
