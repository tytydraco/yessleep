I couldn't believe when I got an email invitation from a big YouTuber, ( let's call him Jack for now ) requesting me to join for a hide and seek game. I generally enjoy watching entertainment videos of mrbeast and others , so when I got the email , I was already excited about the game. Anyway , Jack is a kind of YouTuber who is known to give a sour thumb to the losers but somehow people still like him. In this hide and seek game he is giving away a million dollars , so I instantly accepted the invite. I filled out a form and then I was given a date, time and venue. I felt that my life was going to change after this event. 

I reached at the football field a bit earlier. Cold breeze brushed past my hands as I tried to warm myself by rubbing them. I went inside of the stadium where I saw a big crowd near a small dome. I got myself checked and met with Jack for the first time. I will be honest with you , this guy is soo cold that I felt a shiver down my spine. He has this particular aura that made me repulsive towards him. But he spoke fine with everyone, so I thought that maybe it was just me. 

Jack then stood up the stage in front of the crowd and told us about the game. Everyone was very excited. He told that this game will last for 24 hours and that we should abid by all the rules. We were all handed a list of rules and told to read it twice. They were somewhat to serious about it. I had barely started to read it when Jack announced , "You have 15 minutes to hide. Find a safe spot for yourself and pray that we do not find you hah. Your time starts now. " The crowd start to rush towards the stands so went behind them as well. I thought maybe I should read the rules first and opened the slip. The rules were somewhat weird:- 

1) You should find yourself a safe spot to hide.
2) Do not hide in the safe room , it comes with  a one side window from which one can easily get a clear view. 
3) Do not hide in the toilets because you won't be able to escape from there. 
4) Do not trust someone who is offering you a secret place. That might be a trap. 
5) You are not allowed to leave until the event is over . Disobeying will lead to instant execution of the person.
6) If you are found out by me , you will be killed as per the contract you have signed.

A chill ran down my spine after I read the last rule. I am pretty sure there was no such rule. I saw people around me laughing and running to hide. I wondered what would happen when the read the rules. I couldn't even go out now. I cursed myself for letting me get caught in this hellhole. I started to find a good place for me. By now most of the people have hidden in  different places. I was starting to sweat because I was not able to find a good spot till now. It was at that moment I found few boxes. I thought I might stand on them and jump to catch the container and hide behind them. After a few unsuccessful attempts ,I was finally able to reach the spot. From this place , I can easily scan the hall area without being spotted. Soon , I booming voice on the speakers  announced , " I AM COMING FOR YOU !!!!!! ". The way he said I felt like he was some kind of maniac. Soon I started hearing gunshots. And screams of people. I wondered if we just signed for a shooting willingly. I saw people jump from their hiding places and run for their lives. There was blood everywhere and Jack was just shooting in the air , laughing as he saw people come out in front of him. If I was to survive this pure nightmare , the best thing I could do now is sleep. But I won't be able to sleep when people are dying out there. Then I heard a slight voice , calling my name , telling me that he can see me and that he has a place to hide and I should follow him. But I was not able to spot the guy . He kept calling my name in his deep rasp voice and I felt like I was having a breakdown. I hugged my legs and put my head between them hoping that this would stop soon. But when I looked at my watch, I realized only an hour has gone since the start.  

I was starting to get restless, when I started to hear footsteps. Lots of them , excited about  finding something were filling in my room. On the other side were the toilets were no one was hiding , so it was possible that somehow they know where I am. Suddenly they start to call my name . The more nearer they got to me the more louder they got . I now have changed my position to the other side of container and crouching behind boxes. They have sealed my room and there are few men looking for me . I don't know where to go now. There are windows to my far right , toilets on the left and behind me is a wall. I am not able to look in front because of the container. Please if you are able to help me , suggest an idea so I can leave this hellhole. And please , if you get an email stating that you are invited to a hide and seek game , just ignore it.
