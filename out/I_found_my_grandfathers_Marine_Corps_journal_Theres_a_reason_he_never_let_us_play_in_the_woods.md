My grandfather passed away two months ago. When we were sorting his things, we found a box he’d duct-taped shut and shoved behind the insulation in his garage attic. Inside were a few medals, a half-rotted helmet cover… and this journal.

The journal isn’t complete. Whole sections were torn out. Some pages look water-damaged. A few were folded so many times the words are nearly gone, like he kept trying to hide them even from himself.

My dad said Grandpa didn’t like talking about his time in the Marines. He told me once, “Some training scars stay with you for a reason.”

Most of the journal reads like normal field notes and letters to my grandma — until the entries from April 19th to May 2nd, 1981. Those pages were tucked between two cardboard sheets as if he didn’t want them bending or tearing.

I typed the entries below exactly as they were written.

I’m not trying to entertain anyone. I’m hoping someone here might know something about what he went through, or what this creature could have been.

Because the handwriting changes in those last entries. The pressure on the page changes. And they don’t read like someone writing to the woman he loved.

They read like someone who was trying not to be overheard.

Here’s what he wrote.

April 19th, 1980

Cateyes, a funny word for the patches we sewed on our helmet covers. The little rectangles look like a pair of off white eyes during the day. Hence the name. But at night, the faint glow from the reflective tape is enough to follow the man in front.

I’m thankful I have it, for nights like last. Patrolling in the forest at night, you’ll take anything you can get. Under the canopy, even during the day, it's dark and wearing camouflage doesn’t help. I almost lost sight of Radcliffe yesterday!

I’m exhausted, I’ll tell you all about today once it's over. Goodbye.

April 20th 1980.

We had to execute our lost soldier plan today. Snowberger got lost somehow when we moved patrol bases. His battle buddy, team leader, squad leader somehow didn’t catch it until we were at our new site. The platoon sergeant is pissed! He nearly threw the squad leader off a cliff and only simmered down when the Lt and Filipino Marines looked at him sideways. 

Of course this meant another hike through the jungle. Jesus I’m tired of being tired. And wet. Lt and the Staff Sergeant made us search in full kit. Babe, let me tell you how much this all weighs…

Well, we found Snowberger, or at least 2nd squad did. They say he was curled up, tucked in a hollowed out dead tree shivering in the heat. Luckily he had his gear so we didn’t look for that. But I heard he fell and knocked himself out, I’ll have to ask his battle buddy. Funny thing is, his helmet was mangled or at least that’s what Sergeant Triplett said. Something slashed the back but my sergeant said, after inspecting the helmet, something took a bite. 

That’s all I heard from that, Staff Sergeant told us, “Shut up! Look away!” But the Filipino Marines were whispering to each other. They were the only ones talking but Staff Sergeant didn’t have the gall to shut them up. 

Once we got back to the patrol base, they put me on the gun. I couldn’t ask around to see what truly happened to Snowberger. Which is why I am writing to you. I hope your day was better than mine. 

I love you!

April 21st

For once, after 4 days in, we didn’t patrol today. Lt told us to unscrew our BFAs, the red metal things on the end of our rifles. They allow for hot gases to be contained so our weapons can cycle properly and stop live rounds if loaded on accident (we don’t have that). Well, anyways, as a boot like myself, you don’t question anything. 

Rumors have been going down the line. All patrols stopped because of what happened to Snowberger. Lt moved Snowberger to be with him and the radio operator. Staff Sergeant has gone up and down the line telling us, “No fucking talking. If I hear one word, if I catch you sleeping, I’ll smack you the fuck down.”

Sergeant Engle told us only fireteam leaders and up are allowed to talk. The Filipino Marines keep talking, in low voices to Staff Sergeant and Lt. I don’t know, maybe it's an end of exercise thing? I’m about to go on watch, I’ll write again!

April 22nd

 Lt has been working the radio for nothing. Sergeant checked our helmets and chewed out those who didn’t have their cateyes on or helmets strapped properly. Sergeant made us function check our rifles and took any pryro we had. All smoke grenades, hand flares, and illumination rounds went to the Lt. I can see Snowberger is a nervous wreck. 

We are moving out soon. I’m chaffing so much, it's goddamn wet. Ok, I’ll write soon.

April 23rd

We are on a hill now. If I wasn’t so miserable it’d be kinda nice. Lt is working the radio and we are still rotating a defense, I don’t think the OPFOR is out there. 

We did a movement to contact to the new patrol base. It was slow and painful. I know you don’t know what that is but just know it sucks when you do it. I could tell Sergeant was on edge, he normally keeps cool but he hissed orders. Every movement in the brush beyond us he told us, “keep away, stay close to where I can see ya!” He moved up and down our formation as we patrolled through. 

The echoing thunder of a single round broke from the right flank. “Get down,” Sergeant said and then he had us take sectors. Someone shot a M60 round into the jungle. Rumor has it was Lance Corporal Petermann. He’s a boot killer, a real mean son of a bitch, while I hope the rumor is true, I don’t believe it. 

Rumor has circulated throughout the patrol base. Some say he shot at something, out there in the jungle. He told people he heard something “crumpling and heading toward him.” I think it's just the senior lances and corporals fucking with us. 

Well the rest of the movement to contact was uneventful. I walked through so many spider webs, stepped over endless logs, and now I am writing. Goodnight, I hope you’ll get this soon.

April 24th

I didn’t get much sleep last night. I went through about all my dip so please send more. Someone tripped a trip flare on 3rd squad's side of the triangle in the patrol base (I know you will ask, we get into a triangle with a squad making the sides). No one shot, no one knows who did it but we all pulled 100% security and remained in stand-to. I think it was some dickhead who went out to take a piss. The Filipinos began shooting star clusters and parachute flares. The whole sky was lit up like some grand firework show! Most of us abandoned our sectors of fire and looked to where 3rd squad was. It was funny hearing the hollering and angry voices of their sergeant and team leaders yelling, “Hold fire!”

However, the firework show came to an end as I heard Lt shouting, “No more, no more! Check fire! Stop, we need to save the rest!”

God, what a show.

Throughout the day, the forest was quiet other than noise we made. Some of the guys say they can see people moving in the tree line but I haven’t seen anything. Staff Sergeant tore into me today because my helmet was covered in mud and he couldn’t see my cat eyes. Oh man. I couldn’t hear a word he said as his hot breath pelted me with phlegm. I was so tired and stunned I nearly fell asleep. His hands formed a knife that kept thumping me in my face. 

I cleaned my helmet off in front of him and then my sergeant and team leader got on me and the cycle repeated! Yep, I ain’t staying a day longer than my enlistment.

April 25th

Something ain’t right. Last night, Lt and staff sergeant let us break light discipline. We were allowed to smoke and use red-lights as long as we were awake. They said we need to keep quiet however. I don’t think we are training anymore.

Staff Sergeant plopped himself next to me last night and began smoking. I said nothing at first and looked straight ahead into the forest. Radcliffe said nothing too, and tried to remain as still as possible to not catch any flak. Staff Sergeant began smoking and said, “you know why we wear cateyes?”

“No Staff Sergeant,” we answered. Obviously to see each other at night but we were too scared to give an answer.

“In Korea, Marines would go missing on patrols every now and again. Same shit happened in Vietnam. Everyone always said, “It’s VC or the communists.” Marines that wandered off a little too far or knelt down to get some water, out of sight, seemed to go missing,” he pulled from his cigarette.

“We eventually got wise and took from tigers you see. Fake eyes on the back of your head makes whatever’s out there think twice.”

That line made my heart beat like drums. My body went cold in the hot jungle as goosebumps went up my arms. I felt for my cateyes.

“How can— Staff Sergeant, what’s out there? In both Korea, Vietnam, and—?” Radcliffe asked.

“I don’t know. When I was a boot, they used to tell that story. They said there’s a reason why man grouped up in towns and made cities, why farmers from everywhere are always skeptical of strangers.”

He dragged that cigarette in some sort of silent contemplation. Radcliffe and I decided it was safer to say nothing. The forest near pitch black.

He left us and Radcliffe and I couldn’t make sense of it. Our team leader asked us what Staff Sergeant said and we told him. Nothing seemed to make sense but nothing happened that night. I think we are leaving soon. 

April 26th

I don’t know if I’m going to send you this. I’ll keep it simple as I don’t know how else to explain. Today, me, Radcliffe and two others from each of the other squads grabbed everyone’s canteens and headed down the mountain. Staff Sergeant gave us all a single flare and told us to only use it if we saw something. We were all boots and we just nodded.

“Stay close! Don’t fucking wander,” Staff Sergeant told us when we reached the water’s edge. Bushes traced the edges of the stream and I barely saw Radcliffe even though he was about a yard away. I thought the footsteps and movement in the brush was Staff Sergeant so I didn’t pay much attention.

As soon as I heard something like construction paper crumble, a pressure squeezed my head and yanked me away from the stream. I thought my neck snapped as I looked up at the jungle sky. Radcliffe was calling for me.

“Here! Here!” I said and unslung my rifle. I nearly blasted Radcliffe with molten gas when he found me. Staff Sergeant came to us with the rest of everyone. He spun me around. I felt him touching my helmet. 

“Take that shit off,” he commanded. He looked at my helmet. It had 4 dents. Two near the top of skull and two at the base. The camo cover was ripped. Staff Sergeant shoved the helmet in my chest. 

“Didn’t I tell you to fucking clean your cat eyes!” 

“Yes, Staff Sergeant,” I said wide eyed. He checked me for a concussion. Staff Sergeant did a head count and shot his rifle. The gas splattered the leaves and shook the bush he shot at. Like a musket, he chambered another round and fired. Cocked, fired, cursed, and cracked a flare. The damn guns don’t cycle properly without a BFA.

“Who was that? Huh? Why the fuck did you let him get close! PFC he was next to you!” He looked at Mendez. Mendez looked shocked and checked behind him.

“Who, staff sergeant?” Mendez asked. There were no other words when we formed a ranger file and began our trek up the mountain. Staff Sergeant radioed on black gear (walkie-talkie), “Contact, I don’t know what the fuck it is, I thought it was one of us, heading up.”

Our canteens rattled, we tried to silence them but Staff Sergeant told us to let the things clang. The point man and rear guard lit flares and used everyone else’s as we traveled. I couldn’t stop thinking about how something took a bite and dragged me to the forest floor. 

Bushes seemed to sway as if something moved through them. With our fatigues swishing as we moved I swore I heard that crumpling paper noise. “Keep moving!” Staff Sergeant would yell and then fire a blank into the sky. For about 30 minutes we trudged up the mountain. 

“It’s us!” Grumbled Staff Sergeant as we approached the defense line. We handed out the canteens back to the Marines. I overheard Staff Sergeant explain to the Lt and Filipinos, “… I swear, hand on the Bible, I counted 8. There was only 7 of us…” he whispered the rest after he saw us all looking. 

Sergeant inspected my helmet and showed it to the other Squad Leaders. They said nothing and just looked at me. That was the first time I saw fear in their eyes. 

I’m about to go on watch, at the apex of the triangle. “Everyone stands watch,” my team leader told me. They’re putting me on the gun. I’m leaving this notebook on my pack, just in case.

April 27th

More flares were triggered last night. Lt and the Filipinos used the last of the illumination. Every five minutes or so Staff Sergeant fired a blank into the air, scanning the forest. We could hear rustling, circling us. The crumpling noise from yesterday came from the direction of where we drew water. The other gun fired from it’s apex. Thump, clear the jam, thump, clear the jam. I waited for whatever was in the bush to come to me. I could hear smoke grenades pop from where the other gun was. It was like Lt and them were doing anything they could to stop whatever was out there.

Wind rustled the brush and a gust rattled through the trees. The paper-like noise was so loud we had to shout. Cool wind flowed over me as snarling made my ears ring. And then nothing. A loud rip bellowed out in all directions. Like someone ripped paper down the middle.

The forest was quiet. I checked my watch, 0333. Squad leaders did a headcount. Then another one. I could hear Snowberger crying. Another headcount. I heard a thwack as if someone swatted their rifle against a tree. Sergeant Triplett let out a scream and fired his rifle before it jammed. 

“It’s in here! It’s here! Look!” He yelled. It was so dark we couldn’t see much beyond his red light. Lt told us to use white light.

“I fucking hit it! Mendoza it looked you I fucking swear!” 

Lt pulled in the defense closer. Now we were almost shoulder to shoulder. We were told to pack up and be ready to move.

End of exercise was called at 0800. Lt said we have to hump 5 kilometers to a pick up point and that, “trucks are waiting for us.” We did another movement to contact. Some of us slung our rifles and pulled out knives. It was futile but it at least gave us some sense of safety as we went through the jungle. I’m getting this out while on a halt.

May 2nd, 1981.

No one said much for days. I was questioned by the Operations Officer, Major Mundi, and some other man who didn’t wear a uniform. I told them what little I knew. 

“So you didn’t see anything?” Major Mundi asked.

“No, sir.”

“And you don’t know what happened to PFC Alvarez during your trek to the cars?” 

“No, sir.”

The two men looked at each other and whispered to one another. Major Mundi left the room. The man whipped sweat from his brow and sat down in front of me.

“Communists guerillas," he sighed and stacked papers. 

“Son, when the dust settles here, keep out of the woods for the next 5 or so years. You’ll be transferred to a POG job, you ain’t going in the field anymore, okay? I’m serious, steer clear of the woods or any forest for a long time, okay?” He shot me a serious look.

He pulled an elastic band from his trouser pocket. It was a green band with off white rectangles on the back of it.

“New cateyes, gonna have y’all start wearing this,” he chuckled to himself and then shoved it back in his pocket.

I nodded. Snowberger got the same treatment. That was 3 days ago. I was on a flight home the next day. “Head injury sustained during training” is what they want me to tell people. Any slip of anything “Dishonorable Discharge.” 

Goddamnit. 

—————————————————————————————————————————-

That was the last entry in the journal.

We found nothing after May 2nd — no follow-up, no explanation, not even a signature. But tucked into the back cover was a folded piece of paper, brittle and yellowed. On it was a typed statement:

“Head injury sustained during scheduled training evolution. No further details authorized. Unauthorized disclosure is punishable under UCMJ Article 92 and Article 134.”

It was signed by Major Mundi… and someone else whose name had been blacked out with marker so heavily it bled through the page. The strange part is that the marker is still glossy. It couldn’t have been from 1981.

At the bottom, in my grandfather’s handwriting—shakier than the entries—were five words:

“Don’t go in the woods.”

Nothing else.

My dad doesn’t remember Grandpa ever mentioning a training accident. He definitely never talked about someone named Alvarez. And he sure as hell never let us play in the forest behind his property. He always said, “Stay where I can see your eyes.”

I thought he meant it as a protective joke.

I don’t anymore.

If anyone knows what he was talking about… or what happened in the Philippines in April of 1980… please tell me.

Because tonight, I can hear someone crumpling paper in the woods.
