I trudged through the narrow, bustling streets of Kathmandu, my breath visible in the frigid morning air. The city was alive with a cacophony of sounds—street vendors hawking their goods, horns blaring, and the ceaseless chatter of the city's inhabitants. But to me, it all blended into a background hum, a constant reminder of how alien I felt in this vast metropolis.

I had left my small village in the hills of Nepal, driven by the hopes of a better future that my parents had instilled in me. They had sacrificed everything to send me here for a better education and a promising job. Yet, the reality was far from what I had imagined. The city was cold, not just in temperature but in spirit. The people were distant, their eyes devoid of warmth. Every day, I returned to my rented home on the outskirts of the city, a small, decrepit house I had managed to find for cheap. It sat at the edge of a dense, foreboding forest, where the chill seemed to seep into the very walls.

My life had become a monotonous routine—endless hours at the office under the scrutiny of my cold, demanding boss, followed by solitary evenings in my desolate home. The only company I had was the cold, frozen food I managed to scrape together, eaten in silence at a small, wobbly table. And the doorknob, an old, iron fixture, was always icy to the touch, as if it too rejected my presence.

"Levi!" my boss would bark at me, devoid of any warmth or affection. His voice was harsh, slicing through my thoughts like a knife. It was the same everywhere. The landlord, the shopkeepers, even the neighbors who occasionally crossed my path—they all called my name with an edge, a chill that mirrored the city itself. No one called my name with the love and care I remembered from my village. My parents' voices, filled with pride and love, seemed like a distant memory, almost unreal in the stark reality of my current existence.

One evening, as I sat shivering in my dimly lit room, my phone rang. It was a call that shattered the last remnants of warmth in my life. My parents had been in an accident while coming to visit me. The words hit me like a physical blow—dead on arrival. I cried that night, a deep, wrenching sorrow that seemed to freeze my very soul. I contemplated ending it all, but the thought of my parents' memory being lost forever kept me from the edge. I had to endure, if not for myself, then for them.

Days turned into weeks, and my life grew even colder. I became a ghost in my own life, moving through the motions without purpose. I would hear my name called in the office, "Levi, get this done!" or "Levi, report to me immediately!" The cold, impersonal tone grated on me, a stark contrast to the warm, loving way my mother used to call me.

One particularly cold night, after a long, grueling day at work, I returned to my lonely house. The door seemed to groan as I pushed it open, the familiar chill greeting me like an old enemy.

I reached out to close the door, but as my hand touched the doorknob, I recoiled in shock. It was warm. Not just warm, but almost hot, as if someone had been holding it from the other side. I stared at it, disbelief washing over me. The warmth was out of place, wrong somehow, in this house of perpetual cold.

Then I heard it—a voice, faint at first, but growing louder, more insistent. "Levi!" It was my mother's voice, but there was something off about it, something that made my skin crawl. It was too warm, too inviting, as if trying to lure me in.

"Levi, come here, my son," the voice cooed, sickly sweet. I backed away, heart pounding in my chest. I knew my mother was gone, and this... this was not her. The warmth of the doorknob was now a searing reminder of my loss, a perverse mockery of the love I had known.

As I stood there, paralyzed by fear and sorrow, the voice changed. It became distorted, a chilling blend of my mother's voice and something else, something ancient and malevolent. "Join us, Levi. It's warm here. No more cold, no more pain."

In a moment of clarity, I realized I had to leave. I couldn't stay in this house any longer, couldn't let the cold and the darkness consume me. I grabbed my coat and fled, not daring to look back. As I ran through the forest, the voice echoed behind me, growing fainter with each step I took.

I stumbled through the city streets, my mind a whirl of confusion and terror. I sought refuge in the company of people, hoping to escape the malevolent presence. I spent hours in a crowded café, nursing a cup of coffee, but even there, I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. The warmth of the café did little to thaw the icy grip of fear that had taken hold of me.

As the night grew deeper, I knew I had to return to my rented house. I couldn't avoid it forever. With trepidation, I made my way back, the city lights flickering in the distance like dying embers. The forest loomed ominously as I approached the house, its dark silhouette a stark contrast against the night sky.

I paused at the door, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The doorknob was cold again, as it should be. I let out a sigh of relief, chastising myself for letting my imagination run wild. I stepped inside, closing the door behind me, and leaned against it, trying to calm my racing heart.

But the relief was short-lived. As I moved through the darkened house, I noticed something was off. The air felt thicker, the shadows darker. And then I heard it—a soft, barely audible whisper. "Levi..."

I froze, my blood turning to ice. The voice was coming from the bedroom. I took a hesitant step forward, each footfall echoing ominously in the silent house. The door to the bedroom was ajar, a sliver of darkness beyond it. I pushed it open, my hand trembling.

Inside, the room was empty, but the air was heavy with an oppressive presence. The whisper came again, louder this time, more insistent. "Levi, come here."

I turned to flee, but the door slammed shut, trapping me inside. Panic surged through me as the temperature plummeted, my breath forming frost in the air. The shadows in the room began to move, coalescing into a dark figure. It was tall, its form indistinct but terrifyingly real.

"Join us, Levi," it hissed, its voice a grotesque mockery of my mother's. "There's no escape."

I backed away, but the figure advanced, its presence filling the room with an unbearable cold. I felt my strength ebbing away, my vision dimming as the darkness closed in around me.

In my final moments, as the cold consumed me, my thoughts turned to the overwhelming grief and despair that had haunted me since my parents' deaths. The oppressive cold had been an external manifestation of my internal torment, driving me to the edge of sanity.

When the police found my body the next morning, they discovered me slumped against the wall, eyes wide open in terror. The room was unnaturally cold, the doorknob still warm to the touch. The official report listed my death as suicide, noting the empty bottle of pills on the nightstand and the hastily scrawled note in my handwriting: "Forgive me, I can't bear the cold anymore."

But those who knew me whispered of something more sinister, something that had driven me to madness. The house remained empty, a cold and silent witness to the horrors that had claimed my life. And on certain nights, if you listened closely, you could still hear it—a voice, faint but insistent, calling out from the darkness: "Levi... Levi..."

Years passed, and the house fell into disrepair, shunned by the locals. Yet, every now and then, a curious soul would dare to approach, drawn by the eerie tales. They would feel the biting cold even in the peak of summer and hear faint, chilling whispers calling for Levi. Those who stayed too long often reported nightmares, seeing a tall, dark figure with eyes that burned with icy fury, forever searching for the soul that had escaped it once. The story of the house became a ghostly legend, a reminder of the darkness that can consume even the most hopeful of hearts.
