TW: child abuse

It’s me, Doctor Dayna Danworth. Your anti social neighbourhood monster dentist, back again. 

Wow, that was a mouthful.

I’m sorry to keep leaving you all hanging, we’ve reached parts that are difficult to relive. 

I don’t even know what to say. [I was as confused as all of you were by the sudden change in the Beast of Cordyline Hill](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/j6ptxn/im_a_dentist_for_monsters_its_time_we_talked/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) at the end of our appointment. I wish I could provide satisfactory answers, but that would mean there were answers that I deemed satisfactory. 

I could understand his reservations; a long and soiled history with humanity, a deceased family and the idea of someone with no biological monster connection raising a child he felt was rightfully his. 

Regardless, that didn’t explain the aggression he showed me, especially not after our polite and cordial prior interactions.

I was baffled. If I hadn’t been so dumbstruck I’d have tried to speak to him at the time. To calm him down. But if you’d seen the look in his eyes you’d have frozen just like I did. The Beast could’ve snapped me in two without giving me time for a last breath. 

That aggression, that look in his eyes, the speed he flipped... whatever caused it didn’t matter. It showed me that he wasn’t fit to care for Pearl. 

My use of the term monster, that he claimed had been the issue was never intended to offend. It was laughable. I don’t think that was the issue at all. *I was the issue*. Tolerable until I affected him, he couldn’t get past one thing.

I was human. 

He had hatred for us; that much had been apparent long before he spotted Pearl’s photograph, although somewhat more subtly. I suspected that hatred, however, lay somewhere with jealousy and that gave me an inkling of hope that some of his human self, Edric, was left behind. 

After he left and some time had passed for me to babble an explanation to Coco, we locked up and got straight in the car, she sped the entire way to my flat - nothing new but somehow more urgent than usual. In the car I was hysterical, unsure what to do.

The Beast knew where I worked but as far as I knew he didn’t know my home address. Still, I found myself shaking as I fumbled at the door, struggling to zone in on the keyhole, desperate to see my baby. It was ridiculous and unnecessary.

Pearl was fine.

Of course she was. She was home, giggling over a baby TV show that Evan had put on to entertain her while he cooked. The pure love I felt as I saw my sharp toothed daughter melted a lot of the anxiety away. She may have had the Beast’s teeth, but she had a beautiful spirit. 

The Beast said he’d find her, but he hadn’t said when. A monster of his proportions in the city wouldn’t have the luxury of waiting and following. The more time that passed and the less I feared the monster turning up at my door demanding *my child*, the more of a plan started to formulate in my mind.

“Dayna! Wasn’t expecting you back so early, Pearl’s... what’s wrong?” Evan’s face dropped as he turned and noticed the look of horror in my eyes. 

I sat down and hysterically told him the same story I’d struggled to tell Coco back at the practice. 

“Where did he go?” Evan asked, Pearl now sat on his knee as he bounced her gently. She warmed my soul.

I stuttered. Realistically I didn’t know where he’d gone. I had speculation but no assurance. Coco had been certain we weren’t followed on the way home and I suspected the Beast would need to make inquiries about me to get any further than the practice. 

If he had killed me he couldn’t get to Pearl and I think he knew I wasn’t going to lead him to her after his outburst. That’s why he fled. I didn’t think for a second that he was going to turn up an hour later and rip me to shreds. 

The monster in him couldn’t keep in his rage and the human didn’t want to let it explode. 

Like I mentioned, The Beast of Cordyline Hill didn’t have the option to walk around waiting either, he stuck out too much in such an average part of the city, visiting me had been enough of a risk. If my office hadn’t been so close to a Connected station he would have been a home visit for sure. Maybe that would’ve been best. 

If he stalked me he’d be lynched. As long as he didn’t know where I was going home to, we were safe. Pearl was safe. 

“He left... I don’t know. I know he took the train here, connected railways. Maybe the station?” I babbled again, trying to get my head straight.

“And you weren’t followed?” Evan continued, gripping Pearl so she didn’t wobble and fall, he was so good to her. 

“I made sure.” Coco rebutted seriously. I wasn’t sure how she could be so certain but I didn’t doubt her. 

“That’s good, did he see the car?” 

Evan presented a point I hadn’t thought about, Coco’s car was innocuous yet distinctive, full of charms and dangling things and always parked directly outside the practice. If the Beast *had* made the connection it was now a beacon, Pearl’s car seat in the back the treasure.

“He probably did.” I answered, noting Coco’s panic as she realised the same. “We have to presume he did.”

“What are we going to do?” He asked. 

The “we” was poignant. It felt good to know that Evan was on side, protecting my daughter. Not many babysitters would be willing to help shield a baby from a Beast without severe renegotiation of pay. I made mental note to give him a rise regardless.

“We’re going to hide her, and I’m going to talk to him. He didn’t give me a chance and I will get my turn to speak. But Pearl can’t be anywhere near the situation.” I slowly forced out. “I’ve met worse monsters than him.”

That was all the plan I had. I thought of the Beast’s story, the revelations about the Harakungu and the hypocrisy of monsters rejecting humanity. The death and the hatred didn’t benefit either party. The words I’d accidentally shared with the ancient monster in his underground palace at the paranormal services convention sprung to mind. 

This plan was... *painfully human.*

“You can stay with me if you like, my flats small but you’ll be safe. Then if he looks for Coco’s car it’s still here but you aren’t. My car’s parked two streets away and if he’s considered that a nanny might exist he’ll go back to no more nightmares first to try and get information out of Armand.” 

“He’s right Day, you should call Armand.” Coco looked genuinely frightened. She never did. Something about seeing her like that and watching Pearl smile up at me changed something in my head. Removed all the fear. 

“No! I can fix this. Thank you Evan, we’ll stay with you tonight just as a precaution but tomorrow I’m heading to Cordyline Hill and I *will* fix this. Coco can deal with the patients and Pearl can stay with you. He was angry and emotional. There’s a person in there and I will get through. I’m not raising Pearl running.” 

Both of them looked at me uncomfortably but I didn’t care. I was determined that Edric Miller would be reachable, reasonable and the *person* that I’d known right up until those last tense moments. 

“You aren’t going alone Day, don’t be ridiculous.” Coco piped up.

“I have to. He has to know I’m not scared.”

That was it. It was risky, full of potential problems and came without a contingency for failure. It was also non negotiable and both of them knew that. So we packed some things and we bundled into Evans car. 

Passing Mrs Pepperbottom’s car I was relieved to be going. I doubted the Beast would be so brazen, but I didn’t need my neighbours subjected to a world they knew nothing about. 

“How far do you live?” I asked, realising I didn’t even know what Evan went home to. I felt a pang of sadness at my own self interest and made a conscious note to pay better attention to others. 

“Oh I’m only down the road from to practice, just opposite the opening to the park. The big tower block.” 

I cuddled Pearl to my chest; we’d had to leave her seat in Coco’s car and I’d wrapped her in my jacket in an attempt to keep her safe and hidden. 

I didn’t have much practical knowledge of the Beast and his abilities, did he have acute scent? Tracking abilities? Or was he just a poor, misunderstood, angry healer? I’d packed my journal that formed part of my database in my bag. Despite the stakes, I still hoped to learn something. 

I had more than a few patients who lived in the same block as Evan and I was familiar with it by mention only. Thinking about those patients I wondered if Pearl would even be a spectacle at all in that building. I’d suspected we lived in somewhat of a hotspot for a long time and Evan’s block had made me a hell of a lot of money. I struggled to hold in a burning question.

“Evan?”

“Yes Dayna?”

“Are you a monster?” 

There was a silence. Coco cringed, she’d always hated that question, probably one of the reasons she was such a difficult receptionist. She thought I threw it around far too easily. From the backseat I couldn’t see Evans face, focused on the road.

“Well, how did you even know about the job you were applying for? And that block - Coco how many times have you written that address on patient forms? It’s a valid-“

“I’m not a monster.” Evan replied sincerely, his smile still audible but a slight sadness in his voice. Unbothered by the response either way, I sighed with relief that I hadn’t caused major offence. I had to stop doing that. “I grew up in cordyline hill, my mother is Carla Parks, she was recruited from a normal university just like you were.” He finished. 

“Carla is your mum!?” Coco exclaimed. 

“Parks isn’t my surname, people don’t often make the connection. It isn’t something I advertise.” Evan answered, solemnly.

I didn’t respond to his revelations. I was reeling. Carla Parks was head of one of the most controversial services in the monster industry. She lead the so called *Ethical Organ Collectors*, an organisation steeped in scandal and conspiracy.

It was originally set up to provide sustainable, ethically sourced food for monsters that exist solely on organ based diets. It isn’t a huge market of monsters but the consumption from that market is positively enormous. 

I hadn’t met him at this point in my tale but looking back I expect Mosaph Eurastix, who first prompted me to share my story, was a regular customer of Evans mother. 

TEOC, as Carla’s organisation was commonly known, claimed to contact those who were terminally ill and near to their final breath, asking them to voluntarily donate their organs to save the lives of a *new species.* It was sketchy and not a whole truth, but TEOC marketed it brilliantly, focusing on the long and fulfilling life the human lead. 

I’d always struggled to think of humans as if we were free range chickens. 

In reality there were stories of a black market style organ harvesting ring. The worst of the stories involved kidnapping and sourcing humans as live prey for monsters to play with, the best of them involved manipulating dementia patients on their death beds. Either way, The “ethical” organ collectors made my skin crawl. 

Evan felt the same. That much was obvious; he remained quiet after his admission until we pulled up on the familiar road, my office just yards away from the towering block of flats we were next to. 

“Home sweet home!” Evan chirped, helping me out of the car with Pearl.

“It’s just one night. I promise.”

“Well you’re welcome for as long as you need.”

I was grateful for Evan, I really was. But I couldn’t shake the thought of his mother. The mentally invasive theory that maybe, just maybe, he worked for her. That we might be walking to our deaths. I didn’t want to feel that way, paranoid and desperate. Fearful of someone who had been nothing but a friend for months by this stage. 

I had always taken pride in my decent judge of character but after the Beasts appointment, that confidence had been shattered.

I will only admit this once, here. But prior to his freak out, I had genuinely started to liked Edric Miller, the Beast of Cordyline Hill. 

I shook aside my paranoia and followed Evan into the looming building, noticing a small but well manicured patch of garden to the side of the concrete and one small bench facing away from me. A young girl sat on it alone in the dark, just watching the garden, she could only have been in her early twenties. 

My thoughts turned back to Evans home and my fascination with its inhabitants that had *already* made it into my database. I was certain there were plenty more in the building that weren’t on my books. I silently cursed myself for not bringing a few business cards. 

Clutching Pearl I made a beeline to the lift that stood perfectly opposite the main door. 

“No Dayna, we’re taking the stairs, I’m not too far up, don’t worry.”

“She’s too lazy for stairs.” Coco giggled back at Evan, mocking my inactive disposition as she bounded towards the cold metal doors with me. 

“No honestly... it breaks down all the time. Come on. I’m only on floor five.” Evan looked sincere, serious even and I wasn’t prepared to argue with someone showing me such kindness. 

I sighed and readjusted my baby on my hip, making sure the blanket covered her face and in turn, her teeth. We started to climb the stairs. After what felt like a few too many steps - a symptom of my poor fitness I’m sure - and passing more of those bald cats than I’d ever seen in one place, we reached a landing with a large painted number 5.

“Don’t mind him. He’s never been a bother.” Evan piped up, in response to Coco approaching a still man in the stairwell, so astoundingly human and average that I was sure he couldn’t be human at all. 

“What’s the deal with this place?” I asked, trying and failing to take in the man’s facial features. I remember getting close to him, inches away, and I still couldn’t tell you what he looked like. The man didn’t flinch. Not even a blink. “Who is he?” 

“I don’t know. Does it matter? We’re all just... living.” Evan answered, nonchalantly. 

I was a scientist. I’d never been satisfied with any answer containing the word *just*. Mr Average, stoic in the stairwell, was a type of monster I’d never seen before, a catalyst for my natural curiosity. I parted my lips to speak again but Evan had already opened the main door to the hall of flats and was ushering Coco through.

I considered one last glimpse at Mr Average but decided that interestingly, it would be fruitless. A note that would later make its way into my journal. 

Evan’s flat was small but neat and clean. We set up Pearl’s travel cot that we’d bundled into the boot of the car and our host set up the sofas for Coco and I. Once we settled, I nursed a cup of tea and cuddled my sleeping daughter as the other two looked at me disapprovingly. 

Everything felt so surreal. A few months prior to that moment I would never have imagined myself with a baby, let alone hiding with her from a vicious beast as an unknown monster stood just metres outside. In the home of the most controversial woman in the industry’s son. 

“How long has that man outside been there?” I asked, trying to break the silence.

“About six months now. He never moves, never does anything. Just stands there.”

“And no one is this building finds that strange?” 

Evan just laughed at my question. It was a warm laugh, one that said he’d probably heard that question asked about different things a thousand times. He seemed so comfortable around the unexplainable though, I could swear he smiled at the walls. 

“Not everything needs an explanation, Dayna. There’s no humans or monsters here, no one’s that self aware. I like it. Have you ever considered just sharing your world with monsters? Not separating the two; no experiments or notes, just existing? It’s peaceful.”

I paused, thinking about his words. I thought about the man, not too far from the flat door. 

“You sound like a hippy, you know?” Coco butted in before I could respond. Evan, exasperated at her inference, sighed.

“You sound like my mother.”

*Eurgh.* Coco cringed as she thought of Carla Parks, practical supervillain and former university colleague of ours. She realised her visible reaction and the look on Evan’s face and steadied herself. “I’m sorry, it just..” 

“It’s ok. I get it.” 

“Are the stories true?” I asked. 

Evan lowered his eyes and scoffed solemnly. “Which ones?” He responded. “The human trafficking or the live stream events?” 

“I haven’t heard anything about a live stream.” I answered, mind racing, feeling queasy at the thought of what sick entertainment her business must have made. 

“That’s because most people don’t know the half of it, they think it’s all just conspiracy so no one looks into it. I’ve tried to talk to people, but no one takes me seriously. Carla never advertised the fact she had a kid, so I sound like another lunatic. It’s been that way since I left. She doesn’t even deem me enough of a threat to come after.”

“When did you leave?” 

“I left as soon as I thought I could survive on my own. I’ve been alone since I was sixteen. This was the only place that didn’t ask for a guarantor, the neighbours were strange, but they’re nice. I didn’t have to put up with... help with....”

“I’m sorry Evan. You must have seen some real shit.” Coco interrupted, taking a seat next to him and placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. “I always thought there was something creepy about your mum, even before the Organ Collectors started.”

I tried to fight my insatiable curiosity. I tried to let Evan and Coco have their emotional moment. I did. Motherhood bought with it a level of restraint I wasn’t sure I had but it couldn’t quash that remaining fascination. I’d always had it and I always would, it was my hubris. 

“What does she live stream? What happened to make you leave?” 

Evan looked visibly sickened. It was instantly apparent that I’d unlocked something quite traumatic. I felt bad but I had to know. *I had to.*

“I held the camera for a long time. She puts on a real performance; hosting as if it were some kind of sporting event. Human hunting. Those monsters... the ones that only eat people... they aren’t the fluffy creatures her marketing guys make them out to be. They’re predators. And they pay a lot of money for prey they can hunt without risk or human interference.

“My mother provides that. She owns land all over the country where she hosts these events, an entire shadow staff of *retrievers*, who collect the type of prey she’s looking for. 

“The weak mostly; sick, disabled, dying. Her ethics aren’t entirely a lie, just twisted. Well... I thought so.” A single tear rolled down Evan’s cheek. Coco moved her hand from his shoulder to around his neck, holding him close. 

Pearl gurgled a little and I gestured for him to wait a minute as I got up and bounced her gently for a moment before placing her back down and taking my seat. 

“I’m sorry, carry on.”

“The few months before I left things had started to escalate. Some of the customers were making tougher and more disturbing requests. Carla was more than happy to oblige. 

“The night I left was a major event, she claimed it was being streamed at a prestigious club night in Las Vegas. The hunter for the night was some kind of big deal in the monster world and he’d handpicked his own prey. We were there just to give him the private space to hunt and to film it...”

The tear that had escaped turned into another, which turned into a whimper and an inability to continue his story. I could see the guilt written all over his face, the disgust that he was ever party to what went on. 

“You don’t have to-“ I started.

“No. I do.” He cut me off, took a deep breath and continued his story. “He was only about four foot tall, with this sickly blue skin and claws that could slice through metal if he tried. I don’t know who he was but he was excited when he arrived.

“He stood in the tree line and I put my eye to the camera. I focused on the cage, waiting for the prey -people- to get let out, mother said the people in Vegas would want to see their scared faces.

“The collector waited for the sound of the starting gunshot then released the door of the giant cage. Two people piled out, one teenage girl about my age and an older man, about sixty. It took them a few seconds to realise they could run but they ran. They took off so fast I struggled to pan the camera quick enough to catch it. The monster didn’t run after them though. It waited. I couldn’t work out why and I wish I never had. 

“Carla hit me from behind and pointed back at the cage without a word so she wouldn’t interrupt the stream. I panned back to see the third victim. The little girl.” 

Coco gasped, I felt my heart sink. For years there had been whispers in the industry about Carla’s sketchy behaviour but no one took it seriously, no one listened and no one suspected the level of evil it was at. 

“She couldn’t have been more than six.” Evan sobbed, unable to steady his emotion any longer. “The fear in her eyes was the worst I’d ever seen. She wasn’t dying. She wasn’t sick. She hadn’t signed away her organs to a friendly hospital visitor. I felt every lie I’d ever been told smack me in the face in that moment.

“She was a fucking terrified little girl and my *mother* was prepared to watch her torn apart for money. And she expected me to film it.” 

My throat filled with bile. I’d never been extra sensitive to the suffering of children before. All suffering was suffering, right? But imagining a girl like Pearl, only a few years older, being hunted by Carla Parks set off a special kind of hatred I didn’t know I could feel. 

“What happened to her?” I asked.

“I don’t want to know.” Coco interjected, knowing that her protest wouldn’t stop me asking.

“It was so fast, the monster took one look at her and started to sprint. I dropped the camera and I just ran. For the sake of filming I was just that much closer that I got to her first. I threw myself in front of her and took the claws while she ran into the woods behind the cage. 

“If Carla hadn’t stopped him I’d be dead. She had just enough sway to get that creature off me. There must be a heart somewhere in that cold bitch, she couldn’t watch her own son die. But she was angry. She told me to go. Said I could find my little friend and a new place to stay. That she wasn’t prepared to keep a liability around.”

Evan stood up and slowly lifted his t shirt, revealing thick, deep, purple scars across his back confirming his story. They’d healed badly, with raised lumps and indented flesh. 

“I looked for the little girl but I couldn’t find her. Honestly I probably just spared her from a monster to hand her to the elements. I was on the streets for a while until I could get a job and afford this place. But it was all worth it to be away from her. I thought I’d take down TEOC but I didn’t stand a chance. She’s bulletproof.” 

Coco and I spent a while comforting Evan but it was difficult to know what to say. We were shocked. I wanted to think of a way to help him, to take down Carla, but I had to focus on one issue at a time. 

Until I’d fixed my problems with the Beast of Cordyline Hill, the Ethical Organ Collectors had to stay off my radar. I didn’t need to make anymore enemies or put my friend and babysitter in danger at the hand of his abhorrent mother. 

After Evan retreated to bed and Coco began to snore on the sofa opposite the one that would be my bed for the night I laid awake plotting my journey to the village Edric Miller called home. I’d never taken a train with connected railways and I couldn’t be certain my miserable plan would work. 

I wish I’d saved myself the hope and admitted I already knew that it never could.

A faint noise from outside got my attention, some sort of minor kerfuffle coming from the park opposite. As I sat up to peer down from the window to the street outside I felt the air [knocked from my body.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)

There he was, staring up at me. [The Beast of Cordyline Hill.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePickledGnome/)
