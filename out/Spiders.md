I recently moved my room from first floor to the basement in the family house. Twas a decision from my parents, given the fact that me growing necessitates me having more privacy, but also implies that I get to have more independence. It was a bit disorienting at times, since my ex-room is now one of my brother’s, but in the end I’m happy to sleep and geek downstairs, I can scream all I want too (with moderation, still) !

Problem with the downstairs rooms tho is that being so dormant since last my uncle lived there, every looks and is vetust, as it is a house we bought from an old, now deceased, colonel. (side note : we have suspicions he might have a secret stash hidden underneath the stairs leading to the basement but it’s just a suspicion).

Since it was so dormant, insects also settled before me. Exclusively spiders. I admit that I do fear them, and my reaction towards them is quite… passionate (bad).	The first a spider was in my room, it was on my desk, behind the screens. In the tangled mess I wouldn’t dare call “cable management”. I had a hard time killing it, calling it slurs along the way, of course.	  
The second time was actually in the small restroom that is adjacent to my room.I remember precisely how long it took me. 2 weeks. First time this one showed up it was on the piping, along the ceiling, out of reach. I cursed it, called it names and simply left, impotent against his possession of the high ground. After a while it left too, letting me use the toilets, but he did come back a few times during the 2 weeks. But one evening, when I thought it wasn’t there as I leaned towards the toilets to prepare myself to use them, it crawled up from behind it. I was terrified at first, half petrified, but I then realised it was finally in reach ! And so, I took my shoe and smacked it as hard as I could. I then picked him up with toilet paper, threw his corpse in the toilet bowl, used the toilet and finally flushed.

Since then I hadn’t had any spider problems for a while but I couldn’t help but feel uneasy in my own restroom, so much so that I started using the toilets upstairs as often as possible. After some time had passed, I managed to convince myself that it was just me overthinking stuff and watching too many creepy videos late at night. But when I went back there to use the throne, something was definitely not right. The air was heavy and there were more cobwebs than usual at some places.	

When I had just finished wiping and tried to go back to my room, I felt something on my left shoulder. I didn’t have the guts to turn my head at that moment. The toilet’s tank lid was slowly lifted, from what I could see from the corner of my eye, by what seemed to be two long spider legs, delicately extending themselves to the side of my right shoulder and arm. The spider legs were as big as my arm. The lid slid off onto the floor and shattered loudly. The huge spider continued to lay its legs upon me as I sat there, petrified by the sheer size of it. Another leg passed over my right shoulder, putting itself onto my liver.     


Some other more all over my left arm. “I was wondering when you’d come back” whispering gently the spider’s soft voice. “Ever since you killed another of my sons, I wanted to see you in person.” it said. The voice was rather “feminine sounding”, leading me to believe it was the broodmother of the spiders I obliterated. “Have you ever had two of your own childs killed ? While you couldn’t do anything” she asks. In fear of what this question could have meant I turned to her. Countless eyes, more than what a normal spider would have, were all facing me. Two large fangs, inches away from my neck, glinted from the restroom light. “I believe not, you look rather young for a human.” she remarks. Fearing for my life, I tried to answer, to muster even a semblance of an answer, but I was cut short. “I won’t harm you over this, but as a mother, I deserve to know why you murdered my children.”
