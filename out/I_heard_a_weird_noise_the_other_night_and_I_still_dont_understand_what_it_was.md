I’m freaked out. Something really weird happened, and I need to vent. I need someone to listen and maybe help me figure this out.



I was home alone this past Sunday. I live with my parents, but they were on a trip for the weekend so I was by myself. I’ve never had trouble with that, but I do get a bit jumpy at night sometimes. It was late, like 1 AM or so, when I started hearing this weird noise. I don’t really know how to describe it. It was kind of like a tapping or dripping sound, but it was scratchy, or muffled, sort of. I didn’t think much of it at first. I thought it was my freezer — the ice maker makes this raspy sound sometimes. The noise kept going, though. I checked the freezer, but it was quiet. I went back to working at my computer, but the noise didn’t stop. I tried to ignore it, but my curiosity and fear of the unknown kept eating away at me until I couldn’t stand it anymore. I got up and started checking around different rooms to see if I could pinpoint where the noise was coming from. In certain areas of the house it sounded ever so slightly louder or quieter, but it was a really subtle change, not enough to figure anything out. I paced around for a while, contemplating whether to give up or not, but I couldn’t bring myself to. I kept getting deeper in my own head about this noise.



I hadn’t checked the basement yet. I’m not normally scared of going down there, but when something else is already freaking me out, it’s definitely not a calming place to be. It’s cluttered full of random crap, tools, pipes and wires running across the unfinished ceiling, and there are cobwebs everywhere. There’re a lot of places to hide down there. I put my ear up to the basement door but didn’t notice any change in the tapping sound. I opened the door and crept down the stairs, trying to be silent, just in case. I couldn’t see anything in the basement. I put my hand on the light switch. I was afraid to flip it on, but I did. 



My eyes darted around the room frantically, searching for anything out of the ordinary. I could hear the blood pumping through my ears. Everything seemed normal, but I didn’t move, unsure of my own senses. I stood alert for probably a full minute, breathing slowly and gathering my courage. There were still two rooms in the basement to check. I slowly walked toward the laundry room. As I turned on the light, I felt something fuzzy crunch beneath my foot. I gasped and jumped back, wiping my foot on the carpet. It was a dead rat. I told myself it was nothing to really worry about and kept moving, but I had to look over my shoulder more times than I’d like to admit. It was just a rat, but it felt like an omen. Again, I’m not one to get scared of stuff like that usually. I don’t put much faith in superstition or anything paranormal, but when I start getting creeped out, that stuff starts to bother me.



I checked the rest of the basement without event. There was nothing. The noise stayed the same. I thought for a while and wondered if it might be coming from outside, so I put my ear against the wall. I almost fell over. It was louder, and clearer now. It wasn’t something dripping or tapping — it was a voice, making a gentle “ta” sound over and over. It wasn’t really *saying* “ta,” it was just making a “ta” sound, almost like how you might imitate the sound of dripping water. Actually, it sounded like multiple people, but they all had the same raspy voice. I didn’t know what to do. I thought I might be going crazy — I mean, I was hearing voices in my walls. I was stunned. I just kept listening, but nothing changed. There was a chance this sound was in my head, but there was a chance it was real, too. If it was real, I thought, it was probably outside. A person couldn’t fit in the walls in this house. Hell, we barely had room for insulation. There was no way I was going outside by myself, though.



I went to the front door and looked out the window, just barely peeking out to avoid being seen by anyone. Everything seemed normal — the empty driveway, the cold street lamps, the other houses with their lights out. I still heard the sound and still couldn’t tell what direction it was coming from. I sat down on the stairs and got out my phone. If I wasn’t going to go outside, I could at least try to get some peace of mind. I wasn’t quite sure who to call, but settled on the police non-emergency line. Really, I wanted to call 911, but I tried to be rational and told myself I wasn’t in any immediate danger — if this person, or people, wanted to hurt me, they could have done it already. I told the police what was happening and they sent some cars over. They stayed with me on the line, which honestly made me a bit uneasy. If the cops thought I was in danger, maybe I really was.



The police cars rolled in. As soon as the first car’s door opened, the sound stopped. It was immediate, not like a person, but like an audio file cutting off on a computer. At that moment I felt a chill throughout my entire body. I felt like something was wrong, like something horrible was about to happen. I leapt to the door and threw it open, and shouted at the cops to get back in their cars. They looked up, startled, and one of them pointed his stun gun at me. I realized that shouting at a bunch of cops probably wasn’t a great idea, so I put my hands up and apologized. 



I tried to explain to the police that something bad was about to happen, but I couldn’t justify it. It was just a feeling, after all. They calmed me down and checked around the house, inside and out. They found nothing and eventually left. They had calmed me down quite a bit, but as the soft rumble of the cars’ engines and the tires on the asphalt died off into the distance and I turned to reenter the house, my fear returned, stronger than ever before. I hadn’t realized it because of the cops’ cars and their talking, but it wasn’t just the strange voices that had stopped. The crickets, frogs, wind in the trees… they were all gone. It was dead silent, except for my beating heart and shaky breathing.



I stood on the porch, staring at my door. I felt like there was something behind me, but I was afraid to turn back around. I began to shiver. I reached for the doorknob and started to open the door, but I stopped. I had to know. I had to turn around. I took a deep, quivering breath and spun around to face out to the street once more. Still nothing. Nothing. Then, something in the distance.



“Ta. Ta. Ta ta ta ta—”



The voices were faint, but I heard them. I heard them getting louder, or getting closer. I wanted to run inside and hide, but I couldn’t. I was afraid to move, afraid that if I turned my head a single degree to the side I would see something awful. The voices kept getting louder, and more numerous. Before, it sounded like there were maybe three people, but now it was like ten, then like twenty, fifty… It got unbearably loud, not like the people were speaking loudly, but like they were all muttering in my ear at once. I fell back against the door, barely holding myself up. The erratic intervals of the voices started to become more regular — they started syncing up, until they were all saying “ta” at the same time. They chanted it every second or so, then they got faster, faster, chanting at an inhuman speed. They chanted so fast it became a buzz, then a distinct tone that rose in pitch.



Then, from houses all along my street, dogs started barking and howling, presumably at the sound, which had gotten so high I couldn’t hear it anymore. It was an aggressive, beastly, primally angry barking, nothing like anything I had heard before. Lights started to come on, and eventually the dogs quieted down. At this point, I was sitting on my ass, holding my knees and shaking. I heard a sound and slowly turned to see my neighbor poking his head outside. He looked the other way, then in my direction, and he noticed me sitting there. He asked if I was alright, and I timidly replied that I was. It was a lie, but I didn’t even want to try explaining what had just happened. Then, my neighbor asked if there was something going on that the dogs were reacting to. I said that I didn’t really know. I said they might have been hearing something we couldn’t. My neighbor looked up at the sky and squinted, and asked if I saw any aircraft. I said no. He thought it might have been a military vehicle.



“Hm. Well, have a good night!” he said. I mumbled a response as he went back inside. I sat there for a while longer. The sounds of animals and the rustle of trees in the wind had returned to the night. I slowly began to stand up to go inside when I heard my neighbor’s door open again. I glanced over to see my neighbor standing there, staring out at the street. He turned to face me.



“Hello?” I called out, but he didn’t respond. He just stared, blinking occasionally, scratching his nose, shifting his weight, but never changing his blank expression. I called out again, and I can’t really be sure because of the darkness, but I think his face twitched a little. Then, slowly, extremely slowly, he began to open his mouth. He only opened it slightly. Without moving his head, he glanced toward the street before looking back at me, and with a jolt of his head he muttered a quiet but unmistakable “ta” and disappeared in a single instant. I couldn’t help but cry out at the sound. I rushed back inside, locked the door, and turned on all the lights in the house. I lay down on the couch in the living room and put on some comfort shows on the TV, but I couldn’t get to sleep. I kept telling myself that I’d be safe once it was morning, but there wasn’t really any reason to believe that.



My parents got home the next day and could tell I was shaken up. I told them what happened, and they said they believe me, but I can’t tell if they really do. They kept asking me if I was drinking or pranking them or whatever. Honestly, I might have convinced myself that it was all in my head if it wasn’t for the dogs. The whole neighborhood was talking about it the next day, apparently. I haven’t heard the noise since then, but I’m on edge all the time now. I have a hard time getting to sleep, and whenever it gets quiet, I can’t help but hold my breath and listen.



If anyone has experienced anything similar or has any advice or questions, please let me know. I’m afraid I’m going to be paranoid about this for the rest of my life.
