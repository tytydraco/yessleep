The marrow had been a door, after all. I understand that now. It wasn’t about its singing or its silence but the way it cracked open, the way it let something crawl through. You could almost call it a gift—if gifts were made of splinters and rust. But no one tells you what to do with a gift that doesn’t stop growing, that stretches and spreads until the spaces it leaves are more unsettling than the thing itself.

The teeth didn’t stop at the edge of the clearing. I thought they might, hoped they would, but they didn’t. They trailed on, winding paths through the trees like a map that no one could read. I tried not to follow them, truly I did, but the clicking wasn’t just sound anymore. It was a rhythm, an ache in my ribs, pulling me forward. Each step I took felt like I was giving something away—breath, time, pieces of myself I didn’t even know I still had.

And then I saw it. Or what I think was *it*. A shape so vast it swallowed the edges of my vision, a thing that felt more like absence than presence. It didn’t move, not in any way I could measure, but its weight was unbearable, pressing down on the earth and making the air taste of ash. The teeth had gathered there, not in piles but in patterns, spiraling and intersecting like the notes of a song I was too small to hear.

I tried to turn back, but the ground had learned how to hold me. Not with roots or hands, not this time, but with a knowing. The same knowing as the hands that had reached from the walls, the same knowing that had always been watching. It hummed beneath my feet, a frequency that made my bones shiver. It wasn’t asking me to stay—it was telling me that I already had.

The sky peeled further that night. I didn’t think it could, not after the first time, but it did, and what was underneath wasn’t void anymore. It was something else. It shimmered, slick and writhing, like oil and light trying to become one another. It didn’t burn, but it left a heat behind, a kind of fever that curled at the edges of my thoughts. The wolves were there again, or what was left of them, circling and gnashing at the air. Their ribs still hummed, but the notes were sharper now, almost words. Almost.

The teeth began to sink, one by one, disappearing into the ground like seeds. And then the ground moved. It shifted in ways that ground shouldn’t move—up and in and out, folding itself like shadows, the way shadows shouldn’t fold. Wet, yes, and heavy, like it had been holding its breath for centuries. And then it spoke. Not with a voice, not really, but with a sound that crawled into my ears and stayed there, carving space as it went.

“This is where you begin,” it said.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. My tongue was heavier than it should have been, my teeth aching as though they, too, wanted to move. The thing in the ground shifted again, closer now, pulling itself through the spaces it had made. The knowing pressed harder, wrapping itself around my chest like hands—or roots.

The sky kept peeling. The wolves kept circling. The marrow kept singing, soft and low, a sound like chewing.

And the shape beneath the ground? It smiled. You’d think it couldn’t, but it did. You’d think it wouldn’t, but it does. Still.
