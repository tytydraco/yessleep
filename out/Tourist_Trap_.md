Have you ever been driving on a long stretch of road? Who am I kidding? Of course you have! If you're from the Midwest, you know that it's always better to drive for 10hrs than to fly for 3hrs! Well, since we both know you have, have you ever been in the middle of nowhere and seen a sign that says “Mystery Spot! Only ten miles!” before? If you have, and you had a family like mine, then you've been to places like that. A rundown tourist trap full of monkey torsos sewn to fish tales, jackalope mounts, and rooms built to look level but are actually on an incline. These hokey horror houses were my bread and butter growing up. 

Every year my mom, dad, and I would stop in for a couple hours of middle class fun. I could never figure out how they managed to get a ball to roll uphill, or why their “mermaid” wasn't on the news. Now I know that everything in those places were fakes and illusions, but when you're a kid, you vow to get to the bottom of these mysterious marvels. Now that I'm a 24yr old man, I've found true horrors. And now I wish I hadn't. 

It all started when my favorite Mystery Spot went on the market. I went to the bank, got myself a predatory small business loan, and bought the place. The predatory nature of the loan didn't bother me. I was gonna make millions. 

It was set back about a quarter mile from the road. The place was collapsing on its own weight. That wasn't what I was there for. I was bound and determined to be the first person to capture the Michigan Dogman. Dead or alive. Was it a werewolf? Was it a creature forgotten by mother nature? I didn't know. This creature has haunted me since I was in highschool. I'll never forget the night my nightmares became my waking life. 

In November 2017, I was a 17yr old football player. If you're from the North, you know just how dark it gets by 5:00PM. So at 7:00PM, it was DARK DARK. My dad had dropped me off at practice that afternoon, so my coach gave me and a few other teammates a ride home that night. 

We stayed late that night to strategize for the semifinals, so we left at around 7:00PM. Coach loaded five of us into his minivan and we shoved off. Shane was the first person to be dropped off because he lived in town. Then it was Devin. Then it was Bryson. Once it was down to Wayne and I, we started to drive down some back roads. We both lived off the beaten trail. 

Wayne lived close to the border of Hiawatha National Forest on a windy dirt road. Wayne and I were getting pretty rowdy in the back talking about how we were gonna dominate in the semifinals. Coach, as a joke, kicked Wayne out of the van. 

Coach: “Alright! You gotta walk back from here!”

As a willing participant, Wayne threw up his hands and got out of the car. The plan was that coach was gonna drive around the bend, turn around, and pick him back up. 

Coach and I were laughing as we drove away. Then we turned around. As we were driving back to Wayne, we saw in the headlights that he was hauling tail back towards us. The look in his eyes was of pure terror. 

I threw open the van door. 

Wayne: “DRIVE!” 

Coach spun the van around and hit the gas. That was when the entire van started to shake. Wayne was screaming and crying and coach was using some very colorful language. I turned around and looked out of the back window. I saw glowing cherry red eyes. It looked straight into me. And I swear I heard it sat “Brent.” Did it know my name? 

Once it finally let us go, and we got back to Wayne's house, we all got out and that was when we noticed Wayne's leg. There was a huge bite that was leaking like a sieve. There was a matching bite mark on the rear bumper. 

Needless to say, coach lost his job. He was ticketed for $1,000.00, and sentenced to one month in jail. Everyone knew Coach and knew that he wasn't being malicious, but the law was the law. The judge gave him the lower end of the sentencing or else he would have been disbarred. Coach is still friends with Wayne's family all these years later. 

About a month after the initial incident, Wayne went missing. Unfortunately that wasn't uncommon. Older teens and young adults constantly ditch this town. They hop on the freight train and try to make their way to Detroit. This was different. Wayne was my best friend. He never mentioned to me that he had any big city dreams. It was quite the opposite. He never planned on leaving. He loved this town. No one listened, but I know it had something to do with the Dogman. And I dedicated the rest of my life to finding it. And Wayne. 

Wayne's parents assumed he was another victim of drug abuse. In our small town, you had three options. First, get a job at the paper factory and never leave. Two, skip town and look for a better life in a bigger place. Three, choose a substance and abuse the crap out of it. Unfortunately option three was the most common in our town. Heroin and alcohol practically flowed through town like a river. 

Every year someone would be found dead at the bottom of the dam just outside of town. If they managed to not die, they'd return to their families crying and begging “please forgive me” not knowing just how much they'd killed their families. How much this destroyed them. This is what Wayne's family thought happened to him. I believed something else. 

Unfortunately, I was the one who spiraled into the sinkhole that is substance abuse. After I lost my best friend, I tried everything. Shrooms, LSD, cocaine, and heroin. It was during one of my binges that the idea struck me to buy the Mystery Spot. I had a “vision” of myself triumphantly displaying the beast that destroyed my life. My drug fueled brain began to concoct the plan. The plan to capture the Michigan Dogman. 

The whole reason I bought the Mystery Spot was to show the world the true horrors that lurk in the forest, not these P.T. Barnum style scams. I was hell bent on capturing the cursed Michigan Dogman that took my friend from me all those years ago. I had become obsessed with the idea that I could overpower it and put it on display for all the world to see. 

I'd studied the Michigan Dogman. And from my studies, there were three possibilities as to what this beast was. 

1: A creature that has evolved alongside us. Possibly an undiscovered subspecies of wolf. 

2: A genetic marvel where somehow a bear and a wolf (probably in a lab) were crossed. This theory would explain why the prints left behind share characteristics of wolves and bears. 

3: As unlikely as it may be, it could be a victim of lycanthropy. 

I prepared myself for all of these possibilities. I'd built an enclosure that was fit for a Kodiak bear. It was based on the Kodiak pen at the Toledo zoo in Ohio. And inside, I had a silver chain. 

Making the silver chain was no small feat. Months of finding silver dollars, thrifting actual silverware, and buying damaged jewelry. I bought a forge and as many crucibles as it took. This creature was gonna make me millions from ticket sales and inevitably when the government decides to pay me to study the beast. I was certain that I had made a foolproof trap. I couldn't have been more wrong. 

It was a cold night in February. The moon was full, and I was at the last place I saw the Michigan Dogman. I was armed with a rifle loaded with elephant tranquilizer and I was walking down Wayne's old road. The moon was full and bright. The stars paled in the brilliance of the silver glow. With the snow in the woods and on the road, I had no problem seeing. Tied to the back of my belt, on a 15ft length of rope, was a sack full of deer entrails. I was dragging it behind me the same way a bass fisherman trolls a lake with a plowjocky. 

I heard wolves howling in the distance. They knew where I was, but I hadn't gone there for them. I was after the bigger fish. I was so consumed with my hatred for the beast. Overwhelmed with my desire for revenge. Blinded by my pride and love of money. I was going to win. 

Then I heard it. A cross between a bear’s growl and a wolf's howl. I felt a tug on my rope and I stopped. My heart pounded. Not with fear, but with anticipation. A craving that I can only compare to the craving for another hit of tar. I turned and saw the Dogman holding the sack in his paw. Although his expr6was hard to read, I felt as though he were smiling at me. I smiled back. Euphoria sinking into my bones. The world slowed down. I felt higher than a kite. 

Me: “You're coming home with me.”

Then it spoke. 

Dogman: “I'm not going anywhere with you Brent.”

There went the naturalistic explanation. 

I know what you're thinking. You're probably thinking, “Brent you idiot! Why are you doing this?” And I would answer back to you, “Why do you drink when even one damages your liver? Why do you smoke when you know it'll damage your lungs? Why do you smoke weed when you know it damages your brain?” It's because you think you're special. That you're the exception to the rule. I wasn't. You're not either. 

I laughed as I raised my gun. I pulled the trigger and the tranquilizer dart slammed into him with a SHOONK! 

The beast took a step forward. 

I fired again. SHOONK!

Two more steps. 

I fired some more. SHOONK SHOONK SHOONK!

The Dogman faltered. He took a knee. He got back up. 

I unloaded. SHOONK SHOONK SHOONK SHOONK SHOONK SHOONK!

Although he was knocked out, I was extra careful. I put a silver muzzle on his mouth, silver shackles on his arms and legs, and chained him to the nearest tree. I walked back to my truck, drive back to him, and used my winch to get him in the bed of my truck. 

The next day, after I'd caged him, I called my family, coach, and Wayne's family to come see. I thought that if this was a werewolf, he'd turn back into a human? But I guess over the centuries details had been changed. Apparently the wolf form was a permanent change. 

When they all arrived, I brought them to the enclosure that I had dramatically curtained. 

Me: “After all these years, I found him. The one who destroyed our lives. The one who took Wayne from us!”

With a flourish, I tore the veil from the cage and they beheld the Michigan Dogman!

The look of horror when they laid eyes on the monster filled me with jubilation! That was only interrupted when I heard Wayne's mom Jenn speak. 

Jenn: “Wayne?”

I spun around and there he was. Wayne. He was entirely naked. He was chained and bleeding. He was crying. 

I immediately swung the gate open and unbound him. 

Me: “Wayne! Are you ok?”

Before I could hug him and get him a blanket to cover up, he began to laugh. His skin sprouted fur. His bones began to snap and crack as he stretched into a horrible shape. The skin around his mouth tore as it elongated into a snout. He grabbed me by my throat and flung me into the cage. My head slammed into the wall and everything went black. 

When I awoke, I saw a bite torn into my thigh. I then looked out of the bars and saw the mess. My family's, coach's, and Wayne's family's bodies were twisted and gorred. Their entrails were woven into a grotesque message. I vomited as I beheld the scene. I stood back up and read the bloody message. 

“Please forgive me.”
