Does anyone here still remember Furbies?

I’m not talking about the new ones that have the screens for eyes, or the small miniature ones I see on the shelves and in the bargain bins these days. I’m talking about the *original* ones, the ones from the late 90s.



I wanted to preface by saying I know quite a few crappy stories have been told about these things before, stupid crap like them saying “die” and other impossible things they’re actually incapable of doing. I found out about them while trying to rationalize what I’ve been experiencing, but to no avail. Looking to rationalise the things that have been happening has only led to making me more paranoid about my …situation,. as nothing I’ve come across sounds even remotely possible, or similar to what I’m experiencing.



What I have for you today is probably one of, if not the only, REAL ghost story involving one of these little bastards.



To preface this story, I’m a toy collector and repairer. I’ve come across many different and very similar toys to the one I’m about to describe. Hell, I even have a small collection of Furbies, not… possessed by a demon, like I’ve come to believe this one is, but *other* normal ones. Just plastic, and felt, gears and motors… this is to say I have experience taking them apart and putting them back together, I know what they are, what they’re made of, and what they’re actually capable of, THIS is the primary reason why I’m so damn spooked about this particular one.



What has been happening to me as of the past four days goes against EVERYTHING I know about these things, and just… the laws of nature in general. What it’s been doing, what it… might be doing right now, I don’t want to remove my headphones to listen, I would rather live in blissful ignorance whilst writing this, should be, electronically speaking, impossible.



This all began four days ago when I received, what I thought, was just *another package* in the mail, like normal, I had bid, and won, a job lot of vintage Furby on eBay, for those who don’t know, the 90s line had two primary categories, the “original” line, consisting of eight generations, six in each, and the “babies” line, which I’m less familiar with, but recall having four generations with six in each.



Now, depending on the generation and color, these things can go for a damn fortune online once repaired and restored, but this particular lot was nothing too special. It had three originals, and two babies.



While none of them were particularly special, or so I thought, I did as I usually do and threw a couple dollars in for each of them, with five in the lot, it equaled out to about $37. This isn’t a bad turn out, as once repaired, I expected to get about that price *per unit*. So overall I was pretty excited to have gotten a good number of them for so cheap. However, this wouldn’t last very long.



A few days later the package arrived in the mail in the last few hours of the mail run, upon opening it as I did so many others, something right off the bat looked a little… off. Each of them were wrapped in a few layers of bubble wrap, enough that they comfortably fit the box and fit snugly between each other, all except for one; yellow, with red and green polka dots (named "Confetti" officially). On the listing, this one didn’t seem like anything special, the only particularly noteworthy thing about it was that it was a little bit dirtier than the others, having some nasty brown staining on its once white belly. But other than that, nothing special.



I didn’t really think much of it, you know. Maybe the seller had run just short of enough bubble wrap, as someone who sells things all the time, it had happened to me more times than I’d have liked. Looking back, I think they might have wanted to spend as little time touching the damn thing as possible, and I don’t really blame them.



Skipping forward a little, I’d already cracked open and repaired one of them, a black and white one, and had called it a night as I had work the next morning, that, and my fiance had long since gone to bed. (She gets huffy when she falls asleep alone.) Once I turned the TV off to get some sleep, I kept thinking I could hear a noise. Just this quiet… almost drilling sound. I tried to tune it out and ignore it, but the longer it went on, the more everything else seemed to quieten down around it. I had to get up and pee anyway so I finished up quickly and marched towards the source of the noise to investigate it.



It was coming from the garage.

For context, that’s where I work on my hobbies and repairing, so the first thought that came to mind is that maybe something had shifted in one of my toolboxes and was pressing on the button of one of my dremels.



Barging into the garage, not wanting to spend any more time in there than I needed to due to the ice cold floor, I flicked on the sconce light by the door and tiredly walked towards the direction of the noise, opening the toolbox with the dremel inside… I found it sitting in its place, nothing pressing on it, not moving at all. It then became apparent to me it was hard to pinpoint where the noise was *actually coming from* as it seemed to bounce off the walls and resonate in the room, but eventually, my ear caught the source of the noise.



It was coming from the repair bin, a small storage crate which I kept the things that were up next for fixing, this stopped me in my tracks for a moment, nothing in there should have any source of power, opening it up, that droning whirring noise filled the room, it was coming from one of the Furbies. Wouldn’t you have guessed it, yellow with polka dots, the one that hadn’t been wrapped up.



The cause of this now annoying sound was the motor inside the thing, usually, they’re programmed to use the motor very briefly to turn gears which cause it to animate, but sometimes they can sometimes enter what’s called a boot loop, in this state the motor runs without direction from the boards causing the toy to just cycle through its movements,



I took a moment to look at it, mouth open, close, open, close, blink, ears down, ears up; repeat, repeat, repeat. It didn’t even occur to me, until watching it cycle through these movements a few times, that it shouldn’t be doing this, as far as I was aware, it didn’t have any batteries in it.



Being too tired to listen to the noise, I plucked it out of the box, took a screwdriver, and opened the battery door. It fell to the ground with a loud clatter, startling me. Looking inside, four heavily corroded batteries sat, caked in a thick turquoise gunk along with the inner terminal of the toy. 



The moment I touched one of the batteries, the motor stopped running. I thought that it was a little early as the batteries were still inside, but assumed perhaps me touching it had moved it just enough to break what was likely already a very unstable connection. With that, I removed the batteries, and haphazardly underhand tossing the toy back into the parts bin. 



Fast forward to the next day, nothing seemed out of the ordinary in the morning, I woke up, ate breakfast, kissed my fiance on the cheek and left. Everything went forgettably at work, until I felt a buzz in my pocket. Opening my phone, a voice note was left from her.



It said, to the best of my memory, *“Hi, just wanted to let you know we’re having casserole for dinner, so don’t fill up on junk at work. Also, I wanted to ask if you could turn that thing off when you get home, I could hear it after you left for work, so I peeked into the garage and it's just… moving its little ears and eyes, I know you probably have a reason for it, like you need to break it in or whatever, but the sound is really, really annoying. Have a good day!”*



This immediately put me off, it was in the parts bin, and it was moving again? I’d removed the batteries before I went to bed, though… thinking back on it, the odds of them working being so damaged was low anyway. I sent her back a voice message, simply telling her okay and that I’d turn it off when I got home.



That night when I got back after what felt like the longest day of my life, the first thing I noticed when I opened the door was the pure… silence. The house was dead quiet. Though the smell of the dinner filled my nose, I called out for my fiancé. A few moments later, I heard a door open across the house, and there she was, hair wrapped in a towel, she must have been in the shower while dinner simmered.



She kissed me on the cheek, but stopped and looked at my face with a slightly confused expression. *“What’s wrong?”*, she said, a small hint of paranoia in her voice. I was surprised, but I guess after so long she could read my face like a book, *“It’s quiet”*, I said, “*What happened to the noise?”*



She stopped for a moment, looking around, then towards the garage door, *“Oh… it stopped?”* She said, seeming to now just realise the lack of that droning motor noise. *“It must have stopped while I was in the shower.”* She said, turning back to me. “*Why do you say it like that? You sound… weird. Like you’re weirded out.”*



*“I am, I took the batteries out of it when it started doing that last night too. It shouldn’t be moving, it’s impossible.”*



She looked a little more confused, then turned back towards the door, *“You left it running to break it in, right?”*, she looked back at me, waiting for her explanation to be validated. 



*“No, it had dead batteries inside of it that I threw away last night”*, I walked over to the open bin by the kitchen counter, looking inside, they sat at the bottom, now buried under various vegetable peels.



She looked into the bin, then back up at me, *“I swear it was moving.”*



It was at that point the curiosity that had been in my mind all day shifted into paranoia too, for context she’s a very light hearted person, so I went in with the mentality that she was trying to mess around with me or something, but the way she said that, “I swear it was moving”, it was either the most convincing tone I had heard her lie in before, or she was actually being truthful.



Trying not to worry her, I headed straight for the garage, opening the door the first thing that caught my eye was the Furby, or, the lack thereof. 



*“Where’d you put it?”* I half-shouted out of the room so that she could hear me.



*“What? I didn’t touch it?”* she shouted back.



The reply put a rock in my stomach, that sinking weight feeling you get when something’s wrong but you don’t know exactly what.



I opened the parts bin, rummaging through the others I’d bought, and various other electronics waiting their turn, but couldn’t find it. In retrospect, the one thing I did notice while leaving the room was that the garage was noticeably warmer than it was the night before.



That night there was almost this… thin tension in the house, we still joked and laughed watching TV, which helped ease the mood, and helped each other wash up after dinner, but there was this air, this presence in the room, it was clear that the abnormality of what happened, that given what I'd done the night before, made it impossible, and yet it had still happened, unnerved us both. She didn’t ask any more questions about it, I assume because it would only further freak her out, I didn’t blame her, I think knowing so much about how they, and electronics in general work, contributed more to my nerves than the thing itself. 



That night, my fiancé clung to me a little tighter than she usually does, she was a bit of a scaredy cat, and I think the lack of confidence in my voice about what was going on was freaking her out a little. I was glad she was anyway, as it was a pretty cold night, enough that I kept my arms under the covers where I’d normally have them on top of it.



I slowly drifted off into a peaceful relaxing sleep, until we were woken by the loudest thing I’d heard my life, the sound of the smoke alarms, blaring throughout the house woke us both up in a jolt of adrenaline, the house was pitch black, and I couldn’t smell any smoke, I jumped out of bed and rushed throughout the house, looking for any signs of fire, but there was nothing.



I went to the garage, swinging open the breaker box and flipping off the switch powering the alarms. The house fell into total silence, except the ringing in my ears from being shredded by the alarms. Once the ringing subsided, I heard it again… that quiet… motor droning.



Having had enough of this already, I immediately opened the drawer, no sign of it, opened all the crates as a matter of fact, no sign of it. That was until I calmed down for a moment long enough to track where the sound was coming from, it was under the car.



I must have driven over it as I pulled the car into the garage, I got on my knees and reached under, I could hear it, but I couldn’t see anything, I reached further then felt that grimy dirty fur, being ready to end this craziness, I grabbed it firmly and went to stand, I could feel the vibration of the motor inside racing, as I got from my knees to my feet I felt a horribly sharp pain which caused me to drop the thing reflexively.



It hit the cold concrete floor with a *thunk* which caused it to erupt into electronic screeching, its motor whirring as its eyes and mouth rapidly opened and closed, looking at my hand, there was a thin cut on the webbing between my finger and thumb, looking down at it, horrified, I noticed something which made me go from panicked, to outright terrified, looking past my fingers, I could see the toy on the floor still, the battery door was still missing, the terminal was empty. It was moving without any batteries in it.



I followed my first instinct, which was to kick it as hard as I could back under the car. It made a skittering noise as it rolled along the concrete, then a harsh bang as it hit the shelving units opposite me. When it hit the shelf, the motor stopped whirring, and it began to move in short bursts, similar to how these things are normally supposed to operate, in a very electronically distorted voice, it simply said “No, no, No. Me scared!”, in its little voice, before seemingly crashing once more and returning to that… boot loop state.



It was then I realised, from the faint light of the door of the garage behind me, and my fiancé standing in it, that I could see my breath in the air, it was only in that moment I realised how damn cold it was in there.



Suffice to say, I fled and locked the door behind me, locking it inside there. I ran my hand under water for a while, relieving some of the stinging.



It was hard to sleep that night, what the hell can you say or think to justify something like this? There was still some… part of me which rationalized all of this as just, a lot of creepy coincidences, or cheap explanations… What if the seller installed a battery inside the thing which turns on and off at random… maybe I cut my hand while reaching back out from under the car… that sort of thing.



The line where this all became undeniable was when, later that night, after we had finally settled down after spending most of the night in the living room, glancing at that damn door every minute, we finally got back to sleep.

I woke up to the feeling of my fiancé shuffling, quietly groaning as she seemingly tried to kick the bedsheets off herself, she mumbled, telling me to stop before opening her eyes slightly. She looked at me for a moment, and there was this moment of understanding between us that I wasn't doing anything, before her eyes shot open, she screamed, kicking her legs hard and rapidly, the bed sheets fell into a pile at the end of the bed, then, with one last kick, a small object shot across the room, rolling along the floor and into the doorway of the bedroom. Both of us stared; laying face down, was once again, that damn thing. The moment we both locked our eyes onto it, it was seemingly yanked into the darkness of the hallway by some invisible force.



So far, that has been the last we’ve seen of it, it goes without saying that we didn’t sleep for the rest of that night. Once daylight broke, we searched the house together to no avail. The garage too, nothing. It’s been two days since then and we’ve yet to see any sign of the damn thing. Though we still haven’t shaken that horrible dread feeling, that presence is still in the house. So chances are it’s still here, we just haven’t found it yet.



*From what research we’ve been able to do through the following sleepless nights, we’ve come to the conclusion that it might be some kind of poltergeist. Knowing this has brought us a little comfort, being aware of what the hell has been happening, and from some articles we’ve read, they apparently aren’t always evil. But I’ve got to say I’m starting to have my doubts about whatever has latched onto that thing being anything but demonic. I think once we find it, I'll dismantle it.*
