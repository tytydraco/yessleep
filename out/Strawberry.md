  “Please… please, you don’t have to do this!”

  “Hate to say it, sweetie, but we really do.”

&#x200B;

A gunshot echoed through the construction yard and the sound of it made me flinch. Everett Ashby on the other hand kept a straight face. The gun had jumped slightly in his hand and he hadn’t even blinked. The girl in front of him hit the ground with a final thud, her eyes staring up into oblivion. Her name had been Sabrina, I think. She couldn’t have been older than 16 and Ashby had just shot her square in the chest. 

&#x200B;

  “Angelo, Brock. Get rid of her,” Ashby said. His voice was calm. Devoid of any emotion, as if he were talking about an inconvenient spill and not a dead teenager. With that, he turned away and stuffed his hands into his pockets, heading toward the black Bugatti parked several feet away. Through the tinted windows, I could see the shadow of a massive, toadlike woman sitting patiently inside. Diane Edwards. I shouldn’t have been surprised that she’d come to oversee this personally. 

&#x200B;

Brock was already rolling Sabrina’s body into the tarp we’d laid out nearby. I let him do the work. I’m no stranger to dealing with corpses, but something about touching that kid just felt wrong to me. She reminded me a little bit of my own sister, Olivia. It was the glasses mostly. Sabrina had worn the same square rimless glasses that Olivia did. Add in the fact that they had similar long brown hair and that Sabrina’s outfit was the exact sort of thing that Olivia would have worn, this suddenly felt too much like staring down at the corpse of my own sister.

&#x200B;

  “You gonna help me or not?” Brock asked, looking up at me. He pulled the tarp over Sabrina’s body, thankfully obscuring her face.

  “Yeah, sure thing…” I said quietly before quietly approaching the body. I helped him secure the tarp and tie it closed. Then, once that was done I helped him carry the body to the shallow grave we’d dug earlier. In a few days, it would be paved over and the office jockeys who’d one day work in this building would be none the wiser to Sabrina, rotting away beneath the tires of their expensive cars. 

&#x200B;

We tossed her in unceremoniously and Brock went to grab the shovel.

  “Think we should say a few words?” I asked. He just scoffed.

  “Yeah, sure,” He said. “Here lies a dumb bitch. If she’d kept her nose in her own goddamn business, she’d still be alive.”

  “Come on, man. It wasn’t the kids fault we had to waste her! She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time!”

  “Yeah and that ain’t our problem. Now grow a set of balls, get me that shovel and help me.”

&#x200B;

I grimaced but didn’t argue and around fifteen minutes later, Sabrina was laid to rest. As we patted down the soil, my eyes couldn’t help but wander to the spot where we’d buried Andy about last night. If it hadn’t been for that rat bastard, none of this would have happened. Unlike Sabrina, he actually deserved an unmarked grave underneath a future parking lot. 

&#x200B;

There’s one rule in our line of business. One golden rule that you never break, if you know what’s good for you. The Italians call it ‘*Omerta*’ and the translation is pretty simple. ‘*Don’t turn rat.*’ If you work in the kind of business I do, you don’t talk to the police. You don’t sell out your own. Andy Knox broke that rule. It’s why Diane had Ashby blow his goddamn brains out and I had no intention of losing any sleep over Andy’s death. The bastard got what was coming to him.

&#x200B;

But Sabrina never did a single thing wrong. Hell, it was technically Ashby who’d fucked up! It’d been his idea to kill Andy at *‘Il Cuoco Grasso’*. Anyone with a brain should’ve realized that using Diane’s restaurant to conduct that kind of business was a bad idea! But Ashby always said he liked the privacy. ‘*No witnesses*’ he said. 

&#x200B;

Sure. No witnesses, except for some kid coming in on a Sunday night to make a delivery. That’s why Sabrina had been there. Diane’s chefs bought in their dessert menu from this local bakery. A place called ‘*Strawberry.*’ As far as I knew, her sister owned the place. Sabrina just handled a few deliveries part time. 

&#x200B;

On the night we’d killed Andy, she’d probably just found the door unlocked and come in, thinking nothing was wrong. If she hadn’t screamed when we’d wasted that rat bastard, we probably never would have known she was even there. But she did scream, and Ashby didn’t want witnesses. So we’d dragged the poor girl off the street the next day and brought her here… to her death.

&#x200B;

I heard the roar of an engine and turned to see that ugly fucking Bugatti driving off, leaving us alone with the body. Beside me, I noticed Brock lighting up a cigarette. He slung his shovel over his shoulder, unconcerned with what we’d just done and made his way off to the edge of the construction yard, where he and I had both parked. Just another day on the job.

  “You coming?” He asked, “Or are you gonna write a goddamn eulogy for the bitch?”

I didn’t dignify that with a response. I left the grave, put my shovel back where I’d found it, and drove home. I didn’t sleep.

&#x200B;

It was two days later that I saw it on the news. A body turned up in an alley a few blocks from my apartment. They reported it as a stabbing and I didn’t pay much attention to it at first. Bodies turn up all the time in my city. People are fucking savages out here. From what I heard, it sounded sort of like a mugging gone wrong. Nothing all that special.

&#x200B;

It wasn’t until I went into work that evening that I realized who’d been killed.

&#x200B;

Brock and I were supposed to be meeting with some guys to pick up a package. It was a fairly standard operation. Two or three guys would come, we’d have dinner and when they left, one of them would ‘forget’ his briefcase under the table. We’d take that briefcase out back, we’d leave it for Ashby and then we’d go home. Easy peasy. 

&#x200B;

Naturally, I’d arrived at *Il Cuoco Grasso* early to grab a table. The place marketed itself as more upscale Italian dining, so it was usually pretty busy during the dinner rush. Grabbing a table early was just good business. Diane didn’t give us any special reservations. She comped our meals and that was it. Once I got our table, I texted Brock to let him know I was there and made myself comfortable. I ordered myself a soda, and some breadsticks to pass the time.

&#x200B;

From the corner of my eye, I could see Diane herself at a table on the other side of the restaurant. That wasn’t an uncommon sight, and she was just about impossible to miss. She didn’t look like the kind of woman you’d find in this business. She was pushing 60 with dyed blonde hair, too much makeup, gaudy jewelry, and cat eyed glasses on a chain. She looked more like an aging receptionist than someone half the criminals in the city were afraid of.  

&#x200B;

Sometimes during our deals, she’d be out there going over her books and sipping on a margarita. I occasionally wondered if she was only out there to watch the deal go down from afar, but I couldn’t be sure. Either way, she didn’t acknowledge me and I wasn’t supposed to acknowledge her. Most bosses like to keep things on the down low, but Diane was the kind of woman who’d kill you for the smallest slip up. Before she’d killed Andy, we’d worked with a guy named Terrance. She’d killed him about six months prior for speaking to her in public. He hadn’t said much. Just ‘hello’ but I guess that had been more than enough to justify punching his ticket in her eyes. 

&#x200B;

As I sat at that table, waiting for Brock to show up and snacking on my breadsticks (the ones at Diane’s restaurant were admittedly pretty good) I noticed someone going to join her at her table. For a moment, I wondered if the guys we were supposed to meet with had arrived early and felt a small jolt of panic in my chest. But the person pulling out a chair across from her wasn’t one of the guys we usually met with. Hell, it wasn’t even a guy. It was a girl with neck length hair that was dyed hot pink and tied back into a ponytail. It took me a few moments to recognize her. 

&#x200B;

That was the girl who ran *Strawberry*. I think her name might have been Hailey? Yeah, Hailey!

&#x200B;

Watching Diane from the corner of my eye, I could see her break into a big sympathetic smile. It was a little uncanny, considering the fact that her usual expression was a death glare that could give God a moments pause. I watched her cradling Hailey’s hands and could see her mouth moving, probably offering some words of hollow reassurance. She was probably kissing up to her after her sister's tragic disappearance.

Kinda sickening, considering how she’d been the one to cause it in the first place.

&#x200B;

  “If she catches you staring, you’re a dead man,” A voice said beside me and I looked over to see Ashby sliding into the seat beside me.

  “Sorry,” I said under my breath.

  “Don’t apologize to me. Just don’t try to apologize to her if she catches you,” He said matter of factly before stealing a breadstick.

&#x200B;

  “Brock hasn’t showed yet,” I said.

He paused, giving me a look out of the corner of his eye.

  “You didn’t hear?” He asked.

  “Hear what?”

  “Last night. Someone jumped the poor bastard in the alley down the street from his place. Way I heard it, the cops had to clean him up with a mop…”

&#x200B;

What Ashby said suddenly clicked with the news report I’d seen earlier.

  “That was Brock?” I asked.

  “Keep your voice down!” Ashby hissed, “Yeah. Not sure who ganked him. But somebody must’ve really hated him. Diane’s all on edge about it. Me? I’m not so sure what to think.”

&#x200B;

  “Mugging gone wrong?” I suggested.

  “While leaving that kinda mess behind? No. Someone wanted him dead. Just not sure if they were only after him, or if this is a more general thing,” Ashby said. “I dunno if you noticed but Brock didn’t exactly have a lot of friends.”

  “No shit,” I murmured. 

  “Just keep cool. That’s what I told Diane, and it’s what I’m telling you. And stop fucking side eying her. You’re too obvious about it.”

&#x200B;

I hadn’t realized that I’d been doing it again and tore my eyes away from her.

  “Sorry. I was looking at the bakery girl,” I said.

  “Yeah. She’s smoothing things over with Toussaint tonight. ‘*Oh, we’re so sorry about what happened to your sister. I hope they find her soon! How terrible!*’ Blah, blah, blah. Like she ain’t the one who gave me the goddamn order in the first place.”

&#x200B;

I caught myself raising an eyebrow at Ashby but kept my mouth shut otherwise. He just shook his head.

  “Guess I can’t blame her. The cakes from that Strawberry place are pretty damn good. Shit… now I want dessert.”

As soon as he said that, I noticed the usual guys coming in. 

  “Order some more of these,” Ashby said as he wolfed down my last breadstick, “Let’s get this over with.”

&#x200B;

The deal went down as it usually did. We ate dinner together and made small talk. At the end of it, our associates left their briefcase and went on their way. Ashby stayed behind and ordered himself some cake. I told him I didn’t really have any room for dessert and just went home.

&#x200B;

The next morning, *Il Cuoco Grasso* was all over the local news, although not for the briefcase of cash we’d had dropped off the night before as one might expect.

&#x200B;

No.

&#x200B;

The cameras panned over the ruined storefront. Someone had smashed through the front window and ripped the door right off its hinges. Inside, the booths had been slashed at. Tables had been flipped. Someone had even started a goddamn fire in the kitchen. From what I’d heard, two people were dead although they didn’t release any names. Diane clearly wasn’t among them, considering how the news was able to interview her about the damages. 

&#x200B;

  *“It’s a real tragedy. It’s horrifying to me just how quickly this neighborhood has gone downhill!”* She said, her voice cracking as though she were about to start crying. *“I’ve put everything I have into this business, and the idea that someone can just come along and do this with no rhyme or reason, it really bothers me and I won’t stand for it! My customers won’t stand for it either!”*

&#x200B;

God, I really couldn’t help but roll my eyes at the whole production. How awful, the crime lord with the ugly as sin Bugatti got her storefront smashed up. If I didn’t work for the bitch I’d probably have been laughing. I suppose it was only fitting that I got a text from Ashby right as the segment was being aired. I barely even needed to read it to know what it was about. First Brock’s death, now this. Something was clearly up.

&#x200B;

The message read: *‘My place. 9 tonight.’* 

&#x200B;

I just sent a quick response, confirming I’d gotten his message. There wasn’t much else to say. 

&#x200B;

I’d only ever been to Ashby’s place a few times. Any meeting called at his place was generally pretty serious business, so I was grateful for that. Unlike Diane with her eyesore Bugatti and that nice suburban dream home of hers in a comfy gated community, Ashby lived fairly modestly. His house was nice, but it wasn’t in the nicest neighborhood. 

&#x200B;

I didn’t park on his street. I parked at a convenience store a few streets over and came around the back, as per the instructions he usually gave us. I opened his back gate and stepped into his yard. I could see light from inside his detached garage and could hear a few faint, muffled voices. I pushed open the door to find a bunch of familiar faces inside. Other co-workers, four in total and most of whom I usually didn’t interact with much. Ashby was the only one I knew by name and he leaned against the old Pontiac GTO he’d been fixing up since the dawn of time with a beer in hand. If it weren’t for the grave expression on his face, you almost could’ve mistaken this for a social gathering.

&#x200B;

  “And there’s Angelo,” He said once he saw me. “That it? Everybody here?”

  “Everybody except Diane,” One of the other guys said, “What? She’s too good to join us?”

  “Hey, as far as you’re concerned Emilio, *I’m* Diane. With all the fuckin heat on her today, she couldn’t afford to come out here even if she wanted to. Now, unless anyone else wants to be a smartass, we’ve got business to discuss.”

&#x200B;

  “Yeah, like what the hell happened to the restaurant!” Someone else said.

  “And to Brock!” Another chimed in.

  “Yeah, I’m looking for some answers on those myself, guys.” Ashby said. “Let me start with getting us all on the same page here. As most of you already know, Brock is dead. Rest in peace. What an asshole. Yadda, yadda. The question is, why? Who killed him? The honest answer is - I don’t know. If I did, they’d already be dead.”

&#x200B;

  “So what exactly do you know?” Someone else asked.

  “I know that I’m gonna beat your ass if you take that fucking tone with me again, how’s that for a start?” Ashby snapped, “We know that Brock was targeted. This wasn’t some random mugging or anything like that. Whoever killed him, went after him specifically and they ripped that poor bastard into little pieces of meat. Odds are, they were trying to send a message. We also think that whoever killed Brock also trashed Diane’s place. Aside from the obvious timing, there’s also the damage that was done to the furniture. We think the same type of knife might’ve been used.”

&#x200B;

  “Who’s we?” One of the guys asked. I think it was Emilio. 

  “Diane’s got a guy in with the cops. He’s been passing her some information,” Ashby said. 

  “That said, the trail runs pretty cold after this. We don’t know who’s behind this, but Diane wants us to be keeping an eye out for every possible suspect. Anyone we’ve had run ins with in the past. The Russians, the Irish, the local small time gangs. They’re our prime suspects right now.” 

&#x200B;

  “Any ideas on how we cover our asses until we find out more?” I asked, “I mean, I can’t be the only one thinking I need to watch my back out there, right?”

  “The fuck do you mean ‘ideas’ on how to cover your ass, Angelo? You either cover your ass, or you die. It’s pretty simple.”

&#x200B;

He shook his head and took a long swig of his beer.

  “I guess for the sake of security, you’d be better off working in pairs from here on out. If you guys wanna extend that past working hours, be my guest. But for now, nobody does anything alone and if you see something, you go straight to me. That clear? I’ll see what I can do about-”

&#x200B;

There was a loud thud from somewhere outside the garage and Ashby fell silent. Every single head jerked in the direction of the noise.

  “Emilio, check it out.” He said.

On cue, Emilio pulled a gun from his waistband and inched toward the side door of the garage. He poked his head out before stepping outside, gun drawn. I saw Ashby putting a hand on the butt of the gun tucked into his own waistband, his eyes narrowed and intense.

&#x200B;

For a few moments, everything was silent. 

&#x200B;

Then we heard it, a distant voice.

  *“Oh fu-”*

Emilio never got to finish that sentence. His words seemed to be cut off abruptly. 

&#x200B;

Ashby pulled the gun from his waistband in the instant before we heard the sound of something landing on the roof of the garage.

  “The hell is that?” I heard another guy murmur. 

Heavy footsteps sounded from the roof. Ashby tracked them with his gun, but didn’t pull the trigger. A look of utter confusion was written all over his face.

  “Rick, Walt. Guns. Outside, now.” He said under his breath. 

Two of the guys around me fumbled for their guns but hesitated at the prospect of stepping outside.

&#x200B;

Whatever was on the roof let out a huff. It sounded almost like a bear, or something. But there weren’t bears out here, were there? I’d sure as hell never seen one!

Ashby grimaced before firing two shots up at the ceiling. Whatever was up there snarled. I could hear it moving, jumping off the roof, and disappearing.

  “Go! Find it!” Ashby snarled. There was a strange panic in his voice that I’d never heard before. The order wasn’t just directed at Rick and Walt. It was to all of us. 

&#x200B;

I reached for my own gun. A few of the other men were pushing the garage door open and I flocked together with them, hoping that the size of the crowd might deter whatever was out there or at least give me a chance to shoot it before it got to me. Together, we inched outside. Ashby’s yard was silent and shrouded in shadows, leaving infinite places for something to hide. But as far as we could tell, there was nothing out there.

&#x200B;

I kept my gun at the ready all the same, looking for some sign of movement. Anything at all.

  “Holy shit…” I heard one of the others scream, I think it was Walt.

I turned just in time to see something dark and massive crashing down on him. I only got a quick look at it, but I could’ve sworn it had pounced on him from the roof of the next house over. 

&#x200B;

The shape crashed down onto Walt, crushing him underneath it. I saw Rick shooting at it, but it fell on him before he could get more than a single shot off. It swung one massive arm toward him, and with one giant claw ripped the face clean off his skull. I could see flaps of skin and broken fragments of bone in the light from the garage. Rick was dead before he even hit the ground. Some of the other guys shot at it, but I couldn’t even think of firing my weapon.

&#x200B;

The dark shape sprang upwards, revealing Walt's broken body beneath it. His limbs had snapped like twigs and there was a look of petrified horror on his face. The shape snarled and tore along the roof of the garage, almost oblivious to the bullets being fired at it before it dove down toward us again. This time, it landed only a few feet away from me, tackling another man.

&#x200B;

I stumbled back, eyes wide with horror as the thing sank its claws into his chest and pried him apart with a sickening pop.

&#x200B;

Up close, I finally got a good look at the thing that had come for us. It had a long, canid snout and pointed ears. Its entire body was covered in shaggy dark fur but its structure of it looked more human than animal and the fur did nothing to hide the raw muscle of its physique. Its snarling mouth was lined with row upon row of fangs, and every finger of its disturbingly human-like hands was tipped with a hooked claw. The creature looked up at me, dark eyes burning into my soul and for a moment, I couldn’t help but marvel at just how human those eyes looked. I realized that I wasn’t looking at some dumb animal. Whatever this thing was, it hadn’t just come to feed. It had come for us. 

&#x200B;

The sound of gunshots brought me back to reality.

  “Angelo, shoot!” I heard Ashby cry. He stood a few feet away, unloading his gun into the creature. It turned toward him, lips curling back into a snarl. His gun clicked. No more bullets.

&#x200B;

He stared defiantly into the eyes of the creature as it raced toward him. He had just enough time to open his mouth to swear before it crashed into him. I heard a crunch as his skull popped between its jaws and finally, my senses returned to me.

&#x200B;

A few other guys were still mindlessly trying to shoot the creature, but I’d already realized the futility of it.

&#x200B;

So I did the only sensible thing and I ran like hell. 

&#x200B;

I vaulted over the back gate, taking off at a sprint as the gunfire behind me fell silent. As I raced back to my car, I looked back and was greeted by the shadow of the creature standing behind me, lit by the light from Ashby’s garage. I just pumped my legs faster, thinking vainly that if I could just make it back to the car, I’d be safe. But the creature was so much faster than me. 

&#x200B;

One moment, I could see the small concrete path leading to the convenience store parking lot ahead of me. The next, it was blocked by a shadow. I skidded to a halt, collapsing in a tangle of limbs on the ground, and struggled to crawl away.

&#x200B;

The beast approached me, eyes burning into mine and claws still wet with blood.

  “Wait, WAIT!” I called, “Y-you wanted us, r-right? There’s still Diane! *There’s still Diane!*”

The Beast paused, eyes narrowing at me. I could see it thinking over my words. 

  “S-she’s the one running the show!” I said, “Whatever we did, it was her who ordered it!”

&#x200B;

The Creature’s lips flared back into a snarl, exposing pink gums to me although there was less anger in it than before. Finally, it let out another huff.

&#x200B;

Then it began to change.

&#x200B;

It advanced on me slowly as it did so, its body shrinking to more human proportions. Its dark hair faded away and was replaced by neck length, vibrant hot pink human hair. She was completely nude, and her body was covered in scars. Her clothes had hidden them well when I’d seen her before, but now I could see her for what she really was, they told me all I needed to know about who I was really dealing with. 

&#x200B;

Hailey Toussaint grabbed me by the shirt, baring her teeth at me as she did. They still looked sharp enough to rip my throat out.

  *“And where do I find Diane?”* She hissed.

&#x200B;

There’s one rule in this business.

&#x200B;

One golden rule.

&#x200B;

You don’t talk to the police. 

&#x200B;

Well, technically speaking Hailey wasn’t a cop. 

So I gave her everything. 

&#x200B;

I’m not proud of it. Hell, I wasn’t even dignified while I did it. But I sold Diane out, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. I told her about the night we’d shot Sabrina and I told her where we’d buried her. Then, when I was done I waited for Hailey to kill me.

&#x200B;

Instead, she just let me drop to the ground.

  *“If I don’t find her, it’ll be your head next,”* She said. *“Because mark my words,* ***I will find you.”***

“Y-yes, of course…” I sobbed, “I promise, y-you’ll find her! I promise!”

&#x200B;

Hailey just gave me a final look of disgust before turning away. I saw her body begin to change again. I noticed a hint of pink on her head now, where her hair had been, and watched as she took off into the night. In an instant, she was gone, and after I took a few minutes to pull myself together, so was I.

&#x200B;

The next morning, they found Diane’s ugly ass Bugatti totaled on the side of the road a few kilometers away from that gated community she lived in and they found Diane herself strewn across a three mile strech of asphalt. 

&#x200B;

I saw some videos of the crime scene on the news and found some photos online later. They reported her death as just some tragic accident and I guess that seemed like the most logical explanation for it. I can’t imagine they knew of anything else that could turn a woman into ground beef and smear her all over a highway like that. The way I heard it, they needed a powerwasher to get enough of Diane to bury and I don’t know a single person who showed up to the funeral. 

&#x200B;

As for Ashby and the others… that got put down as some kind of mob hit. 

&#x200B;

Neither story made it far past the local news and within a few weeks, both Diane and Ashby were forgotten. I was the only one left.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’ve found other employment with a more reputable organization these days. I’ve left my old life behind completely. I think I’m better off that way.

&#x200B;

I’ve only ever been into Strawberry once since my last run-in with Hailey, and even then that was a work errand, not a personal visit. I was half hoping that I wouldn’t be recognized when I walked in, although the moment I stepped through the door, I felt those familiar intense eyes on me.

&#x200B;

The woman behind the counter still had her hair dyed hot pink and there was a quiet hostility in her gaze.

  “I’m here to pick up an order, under Geoffery…” I said quietly.

  “It’s in the back,” She replied before opening the door behind her.

  “Sabrina, order for Geoffery!”

&#x200B;

Sabrina?

&#x200B;

That name made my blood run cold. 

&#x200B;

A moment later, a familiar girl with long brown hair and square rimless glasses emerged from the back, carrying my order. She fixed me in a cold look, almost identical to the one her sister had given me but didn’t say a word. She just handed me my order and left. I looked at Hailey, struggling to find the words, and caught a wry smile crossing her lips.

&#x200B;

  “It takes a little more than a bullet to kill one of us,” She said. “My sister's a bit of a late bloomer, but that much still applies to her. Now was there anything else?”

  “No…” I said quietly, “That’ll be all.”

  “Good. Be seeing you around, then. *Keep out of trouble.*” 

I gave a hasty nod and then left without another word.

&#x200B;

I haven’t been back since, and if I can help it, I won’t ever be back. I still don’t fully understand what I saw that night, or what those girls really are. I don’t think I want to understand.

&#x200B;

I’m alive. They allowed me to have a second chance. Best not to look [back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)
