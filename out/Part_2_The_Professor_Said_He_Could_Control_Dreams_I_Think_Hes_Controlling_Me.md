It’s been over a week since I last saw Alice—my ex-girlfriend, I guess. I’ve tried texting, but nothing goes through. My messages hang there, dead on the screen, like I’m sending them into an abyss. The phone calls end abruptly with a recorded message: “We’re sorry, the number you’ve dialed…” Then I just hang up. It’s strange—no one even seems to care that Alice is gone. No one remembers her. It’s like she never existed.

Things are different now. Van den Berg isn’t just some professor running a study. He’s something else. I’ve continued working with him, and strangely, he’s the only one who remembers Alice. It’s… comforting, in a way. His presence is the only thing still tying me to her. Even people who just days ago talked about Alice moving away don’t remember her now. They don’t know anyone by that name.

\---

A few days ago, after we finished the rounds with the participants, I asked Van den Berg about Alice. I still had the picture—the one from her time in the first Cohort. I couldn’t bring it up yet. It felt like I was holding onto forbidden knowledge, something I shouldn’t have. I wanted to wait for the right moment.

“Sure, I remember her,” Van den Berg said, a smile flickering at the edge of his lips. “She was a great student. You two were close?”

“We were.”

I let my gaze drift, staring into the Penopticon. Van den Berg stepped away, rifling through the file cabinet nearby, humming to himself as usual.

The Penopticon flickered. All twenty-five screens tinted red. I leaned in and saw participants in their beds tied down with leather restraints. Cables poured from their heads, feeding into the dark corners of the room.

Then, two participants started to struggle against their restraints. Their veins bulged as the red light on the Penopticon blinked faster.

I looked at the light, then back to the screen. Everything was normal.

“I need a favor of you,” Van den Berg said. He rhythmically tapped on his clipboard. It took a moment, then I realized I was holding my breath. “Nothing serious. Recall the file room downstairs. Go grab me the file Renault, A. I think it’s worth a review.”

My mouth went dry. I nodded, stood up, and turned to leave. I glanced at the Penopticon again—nothing was amiss.

“And take this,” Van den Berg said, holding out a keycard.

It had my name and photo printed on it. I didn’t remember posing for any photos, much less taking one like this. The lighting in the picture was dim, casting an odd, placid expression on my face—almost beatific.

With a hesitation that felt too long, I slid the card into my pocket and made my way down to the basement.

\---

I pushed the button to call the elevator. I heard the car ascending, the buzz of the machinery growing louder. But when the doors chimed open, they didn’t move. I jabbed the button again. Nothing. The buzzing sound persisted, straining, failing.

Then, a hand landed on my shoulder. I froze.

“I suppose you’ll have to take the stairs,” Van den Berg’s voice drifted into my ear. “Sorry. The technician won’t be here until tomorrow.”

He pointed down the hallway with a relaxed gesture. “The lighting in the stairwell’s not great, so do be careful.” He added, almost as an afterthought, “I must go check on Subject 6. Apologies.”

I wasn’t sure why, but I felt compelled to obey. There was a strange sense of purpose inside me, like something inside me was telling me I had to do this, that it was important. Logically, I knew I should resist. I should question this strange request. But it was hard to argue with feelings when they felt so overwhelming, like they were guiding my every step.

\---

I creaked open the door to the stairwell. I’d never taken this route before. Dim would have been an understatement. The stairwell was barely lit, the faint glow of a single, bare bulb hanging from the ceiling—struggling to light even the first flight. Below, the stairs descended into total darkness.

With my phone light trembling in my hand, I started my descent. The basement level was deeper than I had expected. After rounding the second set of stairs, I was greeted by another set. How far down does this go?

Leaning over the railing, I aimed my phone’s light downward, but it was futile. The beam seemed to vanish before it could touch the bottom. Why were there no lights further down?

Looking back up, I saw the bulb above me—faint, struggling, a distant glow in an endless spiral of concrete. I didn’t realize how many flights I had descended. Ten? More? My legs felt surprisingly fine. But everything else—everything else felt wrong.

At last, I saw it. The door.

It was painted white, but there were flecks of paint missing, revealing a startlingly bright wood beneath. It was a jarring contrast to the rest of the lab—like it didn’t belong at all.

I reached for the handle. It didn’t move.

I looked at the card reader beside it, blinking a harsh red. Swiping my keycard, I heard the familiar click of the door unlocking. It was clear now—this was not the file room I was expecting.

Something deep inside me clicked, too. This felt like the culmination of something much bigger, like I had been walking down a path I was never meant to find. It was like Hercules visiting the underworld, but I didn’t feel bravery. I felt small, insignificant—like I was about to encounter something that would obliterate me entirely.

I opened the door.

Inside was a room bathed in diminished red light, the color of something decaying. I could hear nothing but the pounding of my own breath and a strange buzzing, like a wasp nesting in my skull.

In the center of the room, an empty bed sat—vacant restraints hanging loosely on either side. The carpet beneath my feet was old, worn, and unsettlingly soft. I took a few steps toward the bed, my body moving as if compelled.

And then—I woke up—back in the Penopticon.

\---

“You were clearly a bit shaken from going down there alone,” Van den Berg said, his tone casual, like he was talking to a student who had missed a question on a test. “And, to be honest, you’re completely sleep-deprived. I should know—I saw you nearly pass out when you came back. Basically delirious.”

“Stop!” I shouted, my voice louder than I meant. “No, I was down there, and… it was different. I saw it on the monitors. I’ve seen it before, too.” I tried to explain, but the words caught in my throat. I couldn’t convey what I felt—not clearly.

Van den Berg didn’t respond immediately. Instead, he reached over and grabbed a file from the desk. He flipped it open, revealing the tab. Renault, A. The name seemed to burn on the page.

“Here’s your proof,” he said, flipping the file toward me. “You got the damned file. What more do you need?”

He sighed, almost bored. “It’s simple, really. You dreamt bad. It happens to all of us. Go take a few days off. Rest.”

I didn’t know what to say. I just turned and left the lab.

\---

That night, I didn’t recall any dreams. But as morning broke, I couldn’t shake the feeling that what I’d experienced was nothing more than delirium—a side effect of sleep deprivation. After all, I’d barely been sleeping.

Still, the feeling of wrongness lingered. There were fragments of the night I couldn’t quite piece together.

I had a break from the lab now, but my mind was still racing. I kept thinking about Alice—about where she was. How could someone just disappear like that? I tried to hold onto the thought, but it kept slipping through my fingers like sand.

Can I even hope to find her without Van den Berg’s help? What if he’s the only one who has the answers? What if—no, I couldn’t go down that path. I couldn’t rely on him.

But what else was there?
