 So recently my friend moved out of his parent’s place and moved into a small apartment in town. We're from a small town, but the rent is still outrageous currently, when he found this place, it was a steel. $300 a month and the landlord lived out of state so they wouldn't be a bother to him.   
It was a small place made up of 2 rooms mainly with the bedroom/living room as one in the dining room/kitchen in the other and a small bathroom that was connected to the kitchen.  
For the sake of the story, we'll call my friend Josh, my other friend Grant, and myself, Dylan. \[not our real names for legal reasons\]   
So, it all started last week. I got off work and Grant was there to pick me up. And he wanted to show me Josh's new place. We rushed over and Josh was excited to show us all around.  He showed us the kitchen and the small pantry. The bathroom and then the “dining” room that was only separated from the kitchen by a bar where he had placed a couple of bar stools from Walmart.   
Then he made his way into the bedroom area where we saw his mattress on the ground and a dresser that was pushed up against the closet door.   
I thought this was weird because he was blocking the door, but hell, it's not my place to tell him how to decorate his apartment, even if it did look like shit.   
We decided to go out and get dinner to celebrate this new “adult” purchase. When we got back and Josh opened the front door the lights were out, which was weird because he had left them on. He assumed that maybe they were on some sort of timer or were motion activated. We grabbed some popcorn while we were out and settled in to watch a movie. But when we went into the bedroom area where he had his tv set up we noticed the dresser had moved. It was slightly jutting out from one corner. Josh’s demeanor instantly shifted. He was acting nervous and quickly asked us to leave.   
We said goodnight and then left.   
  
The next day was a Saturday, and we didn’t have any plans, so we decided to go back over to see how Josh was doing. We knocked on the door and he didn’t answer at first, but we knew he was home because his jeep was in the driveway. After like 20 mins of knocking, he finally opened the door but was a wreak, his hair was a mess he was sweaty and looked like he hadn’t slept.   
Grant and I just thought maybe he invited a guy over from grindr after we left, and they had a long night. We came inside and Josh stepped into the bedroom to change his sweat covered shirt and when he took it off, I could have sworn he had what looked like bruises and cuts on his back.  
We sat around and played Mario kart. Josh apologized for kicking us out the night before. I told him it was fine and that he could have just said he had a guy coming over. He was confused by this.   
“What do you mean, I didn’t?” he said.   
I just joked back at him, “well how else did you get those bruises?” and then he paused the game. He was confused and acted like he had no idea what I was talking about. Even going so far as to lift his shirt and then show the bruises and cuts. He was shocked. He had no idea where they had come from.   
We were all a little spooked by this and I mentioned that maybe he fell out of bed or something in his sleep and he just didn’t remember. But Josh wouldn’t take his eyes off the closet door.   
Finally, he stood up and told us he wanted to show us something that had been creeping him out since he moved in.   
He pushed the dresser to the side and opened the closet doors and inside he had his clothes and then he pushed them aside and there was a door.   
It had been painted over to match the color of the wall and there was a red cable that was tied around the doorknob that Josh had put there just for his piece of mind. It had four screws at the top where someone had something drilled through on the other side.  On the other side of the closet on the floor was an old vintage safe. Grant instantly was planning on trying to crack into the safe, but Josh was still focused on the door.   
Josh told us he thought someone was living in there, on the other side of the door. he thought maybe they had been coming into his apartment when he was gone or asleep, which is crazy, but he mentioned how he had come home a few times now and his stuff had been moved.   
  
He was misplacing things and he swore that some of his food had gone missing. I told him maybe he just lost somethings in the move, but he didn’t want to hear it.   
So, what do three gay boys in the south decide to do… we are going to open that door.   
We aren’t sure how because we think that the screws are connected to a lock of some sort, but it can’t be that hard to open it.  
We are planning on getting some tools to get into it. I took a bunch of videos and pictures but I’m not sure how or if I can post it on here. If someone could explain how I could link them I’d appreciate it. I’ll updated in a few days when we get the tools… for now take care and I’ll talk to yall soon.
