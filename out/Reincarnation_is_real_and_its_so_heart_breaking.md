Im a 31 year old scottish man who has been having health problems all my life . One night in my dream angels came to me saying they are angels in the form of men . They told me that there is 150 types of their race and they sleep just like us and that Allah( who they call God )does not sleep. From that day onward my life changed forever . 


Every night in my dreams angels would test me to see if I I believe , they would shapeshift into the form of a beaitful women to try and seduce me then when I fall for the bait they would pounce on me with torture equipment torturing the shit out me while screaming stop sinning against Allah . Sometimes they will take the form of my old friends and offer booze and drugs and when I take the bait they torture me again and again . 

Every night for 4 years i have been running away from angels, Gods military enforcers who enforced a serious ass whoopin on me .they stapled my lips shut , stuck pool cues and swords up my ass , raped me  , they set lions bears tigers sharks on me , they screwed a coat hanger to my head and pinned me down while using an electric drill to drill through my head as I was screaming . Each time this happened verses of the Quran( the muslim holy bookk)  would appear after the torture me warning me  each time . 


Then one night i was in my dream running away from the angels I seen these 2 guys and told them quick I need to hide from these bloody angels , as i turned away they said '' we are angels'' then he came from the sky , Azrael the angel of death, the harvester of souls  spoken in christianity and Islam , he was angry and filled with rage  pulling me close to his face , he had wings and looked like he was made from concrete '' you have thousands of sins ! The next time you sleep im taking you! Im taking you !! . I woke up shaking panicking dreading the sleep the next night . 


The dreams kept happening over and over again then one night this angel said their is God and pointed to a ufo up in the sky , the ufo came down to me and opened up and no one word of a lie  it was God almighty right infront of me . He just looked at me angrily  not saying a word then I woke up . 


The tests keep hapning and I keep forgetting these are angels testing me . But one night it got worse . I died in my sleep , and i was in a huge line with other dead souls waiting to be reborn into a new family , I was confronted by 2 angels and they said '' only muslims are going to heaven to be with family and the rest are reborn into new families, so walk down that staircase and you will be reborn again . I started panicking tears rolling down my eyes ' not again not again '' i said . I was about to go down the staircase until i rememberd my mother . No Allah no Allah ! Send me back!!  . I woke up covered in sweat crying .


 Years went by with the tests every night , then one night the angel showed me my mother and family from my previous life from alabama ( im scottish) , " how are you son said this women with a big smile as she hugged me, i missed you so much " I was shocked looking at all my prevous family members round me smiling . They asked me when I was born and I told them " 24th of march 1992"  they were all amazed as that was the day I died in my previous life . The angels then took me for a walk and told me straight , to break the chain of reincarnation you must believe in Shahada ( the muslim declaration of faith ) that there is no God But Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah . After wards my mom smiled at me and said "you are too pale lets go out and get you a tan" . I Woke up in tears .

 I been praying 5x a day like a muslim but cant  have true belief . Each passing day  is when im going to lose my mother and siblings forever . The dreams kept happening " your going to be reborn if you dont believe the angels say over and over again. I pray and i pray hoping to have true belief so I can die and warn my family in their dreams  so we can be in heaven together for eternity . 

As each day passes it dawns on me that no matter how much i pray and try I just cant believe !!! '"Why God why !!" I scream to the heavens . Why cant I believe when I seen you face to face ? . The dream the folllpwing night broke me . It was my mother (my current mother )she was sitting infront me and she said " its okay if you dont see me again son" . I woke up straight away screaming no !!!!!! No !!! . My mother the only one who loved me and helped me in life . The only thing that i love in life is going to be taken away forever !!!. I FAILED I FAILED I failed to become muslim and guide my family . Im losing my family forever . 

2 nights ago in my dream a little redhaired girl came upto me and said " hi , im julia im going to be your new mom''

Its only a matter of time before im reborn again and if you dont see me post again on reddit it means I died and was reborn back into this life ,losing my family forever . I cry myself to sleep every night and on my prayer mat  begging God to not take my family and to make me a true believer 
But his decree rules over all.

The reason babies cry at birth is not because of pain but because they lost their family from there previos life forever . 

The light that a muslim sees at death is heaven paradise with their family waiting for them 
but the light that a non believer sees at death is  the hospital room light , being reborn again back into this world into a new family
