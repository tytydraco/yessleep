I’m a reasonably well-known musician, but I won’t reveal my name on Reddit; a tricky feat, so I may unwittingly provide details which hint at my identity. I’ll try to be as vague as possible. That’ll protect me.

But it won’t protect you.

After my last album underperformed, my record label issued an ultimatum: record a hit that finally makes you a household name, or we’ll drop you.

The problem, in this era, is that everybody’s consuming something different. There are so many different platforms. So many ways to discover music. Too many ways. In turn, there are successful newcomers to the music industry, but no new household names. There is no monoculture anymore. My parents have never heard Chappell or Sabrina in their circles, but Beyoncé? Everyone knew, and knows, her. Things were different twenty years ago.

The point is: I was facing an impossible challenge. Even if my song *were* to go viral on TikTok, so what? People over the age of twenty wouldn’t care. I wasn’t going to become a “household name”. I was screwed. My record label was going to drop me, no matter how well this song performed, because they didn’t understand the industry. Of course, perhaps I was getting too old as well; I mean, I turned thirty not so long ago. Perhaps I should have accepted defeat.

Then none of us would be facing this nightmare.

I just need you to understand the factors at play.

I need you to understand my level of desperation.

*Oh, boo-hoo. The poor musician. Fan those eyes with your wads of cash.*

There. I’ve typed the mean comment for you.

But I’m not rich. Again, remember, I’m not a household name. There are plenty of successful musicians with average salaries, and I’ve always been one of them. With that in mind, I was an average Joe, looking at losing his job. I needed the label because I didn’t have the foggiest as to how to go it alone. I was sure I wouldn’t succeed as an independent musician.

The only solution, in my deluded mind, was to write the greatest song known to man.

*That* would make me a household name, even in this impossible new industry.

I’d written a handful of decent songs for my next album already, but those wouldn’t cut it. They were decent. They would please my fans, but the label had been quite clear: write the next big hit.

I spent two years slaving away. Pouring myself into one song. Letting my other tracks gather dust. Begging the record label for another month, and another, and another. Strangely, they allowed me that extra time. I sent them snippets of ideas, and they were intrigued enough to give me extensions.

*Well, I must be on the right track*, I kept telling myself. *Must be*.

That’s the thing. I’d never wrestled so much with a song before. If it doesn’t work, ditch it. That’s my motto. But this one was different. Have you ever felt your brain tingle when listening to a beautiful piece of music? They call it frisson. Imagine frisson across not only your brain, but your very heart; across your fingers, as you plink the ivories of your grand piano.

That was what this song was doing to me. Every day. It had nothing to do with personal or profound lyrics, and everything to do with the melody itself.

It was the perfect melody.

I realised that this morning when I finally finished. It had taken months and months of tinkering, and knowing that I was “close” to perfection, but then, sometime around breakfast today, something clicked. I’d done it. Every note was in its right place.

The song was complete.

I welled up as I sent off the finished demo, entitled *Fields*, to my label around midday. It was a track not about heartbreak, or strife, or any astute topic. It was simply about the beauty of the rolling pastures visible from the window of my home. *Fields* was built of ordinary parts. No otherworldly instruments. Just a man and his piano, with some synths and other flourishes added to the demo I’d emailed. But, at its heart, it was a simple piece.

There was no great secret to creating the perfect melody.

Or perhaps that secret remains a mystery to me.

“Let’s hear it, then!” said Uncle Jeffrey earlier this afternoon.

Today was my son’s third birthday party, and the living room was filled with my relatives. I didn’t want to steal Freddie’s thunder, but my wife, Carla, nodded to say that it was okay. Jeffrey didn’t have to do much pushing or prodding to get me to sit down at the piano; I’m an artist, after all, and even the nice ones are a little self-absorbed and obnoxiously performative.

“If you insist,” I said with a theatrical stretch of my hands.

I played the simplest of arpeggios and sang the simplest of melodies, but it wasn’t complexity that made *Fields* so intoxicating. And I, smug as can be, knew it was intoxicating before there even came any external validation. First was a murmur of ecstasy that Aunt Linda let out only ten seconds into the song. Then some of my relatives began to clap, only twenty seconds into the song.

*A little much, isn’t that?* any sane person would think.

The thought crossed my mind, or my gut, and I should’ve listened to it. The niggling feeling that had been there since even the early days of me composing the barebones framework of *Fields*. When it was nothing but a vocal melody in my head, from a dream; as if I were McCartney penning *Yesterday*.

I don’t remember that dream now.

Part of me thinks I don’t want to remember it, for there is a black space in my memory.

I’ve always felt as if the song had a life of its own. That frisson I felt in my brain, my heart, and my fingers wasn’t necessarily *euphoric* frisson.

I just hadn’t admitted that to myself.

I only started to admit it about sixty seconds into playing *Fields* for my family.

The clapping became frenzied; too frenzied, even for the greatest song ever written. The slapping of flesh sounded, in fact, so vigorous that I imagined it must be painful. Above all else, it was starting to drown out my playing and singing. There was laughter too. Joyous laughter. It mixed with what eventually became, quite distinctly, the sound of crying.

Uncle Jeffrey and Aunt Linda were crowding me, their stale breaths on my neck as they leant over my shoulders, and I could hear Carla blubbering behind them. My own wife. She’d always loved my music, but *crying*? She’d never cried before.

It was then that I paused and took a look over my shoulder, unnerved by the reaction of the audience.

The moment I did, the clapping stopped.

My aunts, uncles, cousins, and even my own wife and three-year-old son were eyeing me in the most uneasily disparaging manner.

“Keep playing,” whispered Uncle Jeffrey, face nearly touching mine, then he shouted, *“NOW!”*

I let out a horrified yelp and a trickle of tears, and I swivelled back around to face the piano. I didn’t know what was happening. Fear paralysis had struck my mind, so I simply did as I was told. I played. I sang. I picked up from verse two.

The clapping started up again, and Uncle Jeffrey placed a hand on my shoulder, startling me into singing a note a little sharp, or a little flat. I’m not sure. All I know is that, simultaneously, the dozen or so people in the room let out a conjoined shriek of pain, as if part of a hive mind wounded by my error.

And I let out a shriek of my own as there followed a brief but burning pain in my shoulder.

Uncle Jeffrey had bitten me.

*Deeply;* I could already feel the blood staining my shirt.

He clasped a hand over my mouth to stifle my screech. “No. There’ll be none of that. Keep playing, and do not make a mistake again.”

He released my lips, and I took a few shaky breaths, shoulder throbbing in agony and face damp from such profuse sobs. My uncle hovered over my shoulder, puffs of breath coming hotter and heavier against my face by the second as I stalled. I needed to collect myself. I didn’t know what would happen otherwise.

*Another mistake might be the end of me*, I realised.

I didn’t dare turn around, not even to look at my wife or my boy. They seemed, like everyone else, to have changed in some unnatural way.

They saw not me, but a performer.

I managed to continue playing, and the room lightened every so slightly. I finished off the song without any more slip-ups. Not sure how, but I did. My loved ones wailed, as if grieving, after I played that final note. They clapped, but it was furious applause; far less complimentary than before.

They were angry that the song was over.

Carla was crying so much that she went out into the garden with Freddie to calm down.

I’m glad of that, considering what happened next.

Cousin Bobby lamented, “We’ll never hear *Fields* for the first time again. Why go on living when nothing else will ever be so… so…”

“*SHUT UP!”* screamed his sister, Loretta.

I struggled to focus on more than my throbbing shoulder and my shirt sticking to the bleeding wound. I still didn’t have the courage to turn on my seat, lest I suffer the wrath of Uncle Jeffrey again. Instead, I hunched down and watched my family from the reflection of the piano, its mahogany front serving as a mirror.

The squabbling started with Bobby and Loretta shoving one another, whilst my other relatives stood and watched. The others were mumbling incomprehensible words of rage, frothing at the mouths. And then, with the same unison as that earlier cry of disapproval, they hurled themselves at one another.

I screamed as fingers clawed at eyes, faces, and any exposed flesh. Blood was painted across bodies as my own family members, who had loved each other five minutes prior, ripped one another apart. Tore as if digging through the flesh. Only Uncle Jeffrey did not engage in the violence.

He was standing and looking at me, meeting my gaze in the reflection, with a dour look on his face.

“We need more,” he whispered to me.

Then the balding man threw himself at me.

I don’t think I even screamed. I choose neither fight nor flight, but to freeze to the stool and ready myself for the end. Ready myself to be massacred like my other loved ones.

But Aunt Linda caught Uncle Jeffrey by the waist. Caught her beloved husband and threw him to the carpet with ease, for she was a decade younger and far more agile than the doddery seventy-something-year-old.

I knew I shouldn’t lean forwards to get a look in the reflection, but I did. I watched Aunt Linda push her thumbs into her husband’s eye sockets; blood trickled from his, and tears trickled from hers.

I let out a soundless cry, and my sweetheart of an aunt looked at me with a wonky smile.

“I did it for you,” she said. “Now… Now play us a song.”

“Yes,” said Cousin Jack, face scratched and mouth filled with blood. “Play us… another one…”

I shot up from my seat, shocked that I wasn’t frozen after all; that I was able to flee.

Heart feeling as if it might spring from my throat, I dashed past my relatives; most twitching in bloody puddles on the carpet, and one or two not moving at all. Then I rushed up the stairs, pursued by cries of dismay and fury up to the second floor.

I made it to my bedroom as footsteps started up the staircase, but I managed to barricade myself with a chest of drawers before there came pounding on the door.

“*WRITE US ANOTHER SONG! NOW!”* begged Cousin Jack as Aunt Linda sobbed; perhaps coming to grips with what she had done to her husband.

But I fear she was sad only that *Fields* had come to an end.

*They’re not human anymore. What have I done? I need to make sure this song never sees the…*

*The demo*, came an interrupting thought.

The one I’d sent that morning.

I checked my emails to find a very disjointed and alarming response from my manager.

*More. More. More. More. FUCKING more. NOW.*

For hours, I’ve been hiding in my room, listening to the thumps, and guttural shrieks, and near-incoherent pleas of my surviving relatives beyond the door. They won’t quit. I keep thinking of Carla and Freddie in the garden, praying they haven’t hurt one another.

And I just received an automated email from my label: they’re going to release my song. There’s usually a process. I’d have to record a polished version in the studio. But not this time. There is no polishing perfection.

*Fields* will go live on all platforms this evening.

That’s not its real name, and I want to warn you properly, but I don’t want to give myself away. I’m sorry. If you or your loved ones hear my latest song, forgive me.

I pray it won’t be a [hit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
