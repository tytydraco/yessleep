It's been several days now since I found that message. The rain washed the chalk away and turned the dirtbed to mud by the time the police got to my house. I showed them photos that I took of the incident, but even so, they weren't of much help. The officer who responded to the call said there wasn't anything they could do on account of the lack of evidence and identifying information. Since no one had gotten hurt, there wasn't anything anyone could be charged with. The best the police could do was file a report and advise me to install some more security cameras. All I could do now was wait for something else to happen. 

So I waited. I installed more cameras on the sides of my house, I updated my computer security, I went back to working on my videos, and I waited. Every evening, I would log onto my computer and sort through my emails. What was once a monotonous task that I postponed til the end of each week transformed into an insidious thought constantly gnawing at the back of my mind. The idea would pop into my head, for no reason, at inopportune times, and immediately send my body into fight or flight. I would get this overwhelming feeling that I had to go look, I had to stop whatever I was doing and check my email at that moment. And I would do this over and over for the past several days only to find an empty inbox and a tenuous sense of relief each time. This relief was always short-lived, however, lasting just until the next moment the thought of the dreaded inbox came across my mind.

It was yesterday, Monday morning, that I would get that thought again. I had stayed awake all night. Something about being awake while the rest of the world still sleeps may seem disquieting, but to me, it's almost reassuring. It seems that horrible things tend to happen at night, so if I am awake and alert then, at least I won't be caught with my guard down. In the early morning hours, before the birds awoke, I fixed up a lovely breakfast, sat and ate at the table with my tired wife, and, as dawn rose, I gave my wife a kiss goodbye before she headed out the door. As soon as that door closed, my mind switched like a light, and I felt that sense of dread loom over me. I opened up my email app on my phone, anticipating the wash of relief, but this time, my heart just sank lower.  

To understand, I need to tell you about a case that I've been researching for a few weeks now. A young girl, who I'll call ‘Teresa’, had gone missing years ago from an area not far away from where I live now. Teresa was in her teens when she went missing and she would be somewhere in her early 20s now. Back then, she was the quintessential “it” girl; blonde, pretty, popular, had it all together. She got good grades, held a part time job, and even volunteered in her spare time. Despite being such a popular girl, she didn't seem to be on anybody's bad side. In fact, she was very well-known and loved in the community, and her disappearance deeply affected everyone in her circle. It was especially shocking because, out of nowhere, Teresa seemed to just… vanish. 

According to police reports, Teresa's mother had woken up late one morning and rushed into her daughter's bedroom to wake her for school. Upon seeing her bed empty, her mother called over to the school, called over to her friends' houses, and even tried calling her father, who had been on a business trip out of town. No one had seen or heard from Teresa since the day before. Her mother called 911 in a panic to immediately file a missing persons report, but the police hesitated, believing it to be just another teenage runaway. A week went by with no word before an investigation would finally take place, and although latent, police would comb the area, interview dozens of people, go over CCTV footage, and still turn up nothing. It was as if she disappeared off the face of the Earth. It's been over ten years now and Teresa’s case has gone cold. 

So, while I sat there on my living room couch in the dim light of the morning sun, you may now understand why I felt the world spinning all around me as I looked at the new email I had received from Catherine, which was simply titled, “Teresa.” The email read: 

“Stop. Stop what you're doing. If you know what's good for you, you'll back the hell off and go research a real crime. Trust me. You have no idea what they did to her. You have no idea what they'll do to you.” 

I was nauseous. Some part of me knew, I just knew that this was not over and done with. I knew I would get that second email, but I had no idea it would be this. I paced back and forth in my living room, locked my doors and windows all over my house, closed the blinds, and found myself anxiously circling the couch. How did they know I was researching Teresa? I don't post this stuff on social media or even talk about it with friends until after I upload my videos. I do my all of my research in silence, I keep to myself, I don't bother people. How did they know what I was doing and, more importantly, what the hell were they doing? 

My knees felt weak and I dropped myself back onto the couch. I wrung my hands as I tried my best to steady my breathing and think rationally. Somewhere along the way, I must have put my information into some website when I was looking at case files or maybe I had accidentally made some vague mention of the case in one of my livestreams. However this person made this connection, they had to have been watching me very, very closely. While I sat there viciously ruminating, my phone buzzed beside me. Another email came in, a reply to the one Catherine had just sent. 

“Don't believe me? See for yourself.” 

Attached to the reply was a file containing two photos. The first was an older photo, one that had to have been taken by an actual handheld camera. It was of a girl who looked to be 15 or 16 years old, with disheveled blonde hair, sunken eyes, and bruise marks all over her arms and legs. She was wearing a stained t-shirt that hung down to her mid-thigh, and she looked skinny to the point of frailty. Her eyes were glazed over and someone just off-camera appeared to be assisting in holding her up. 

The second was a much newer photo, undoubtedly taken by a smartphone camera, featuring the same girl. In this photo, she was older and she was no longer disheveled or bruised or bone-thin. She was smiling from ear to ear and holding a bottle of champagne in her hands. Her eyes were bright and she looked healthy. The girl in both photos was unmistakably Teresa. 

I couldn't tell you how long I stared at these images. There was no way these were real. They had to have been edited, to try to scare me, to try to silence me. If they were edited, whoever did it did a damn good job. After ages of scanning over what I was sent, I set my phone aside and stared off into the distance. I thought about all the events of the past year. That strange Youtube account, the creepy comment, the weird emails. I thought about how my channel had grown and amassed so much recognition and so many viewers. I thought about my house, my dog, my wife. 

I thought about Teresa. This girl that I didn't know at all, yet she felt like someone everybody knew. She had this pristine, picture-perfect life with a loving family and wonderful friends, but, could it all have been a lie? Such a story was all too familiar. I'd seen it time and time again in my research. Still, after having read the public records, the police reports, and watched the numerous news interviews with her friends and family, I just never got the sense that any of them were malicious. No one had anything bad to say about her, no one acted suspicious or off-putting; everyone involved just seemed heartbroken and genuinely concerned for Teresa. 

The smart thing to do would have been to hand it off to a real detective who I already had a contact for. But I couldn't shake my inner conflict over the whole thing. On one hand, Catherine was incredibly creepy and concerning all on her own. On the other, I had to consider what she was saying at face value. If I went forward with reporting this, would I be unwittingly putting Teresa in danger? Would I be putting myself in danger? I weighed my options and decided my safest bet would simultaneously be the riskiest thing I've ever done. I took in a deep breath and hit Reply.
