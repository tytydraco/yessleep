Hello, my name is Mary and I am currently 19 years old, I have to share what happened to me weeks ago here because it is my last hope and no one believes me.

I'm studying nursing at college and my friends and I always have lunch at a restaurant that's right in front of the college during lunch because it's very convenient.

Two weeks ago, when we left the restaurant, there was a popsicle cart, with a very kind and polite elderly gentleman selling them. Something I should mention is that I live in Brazil, what makes it summer here, and my friends and I were very sweaty.

As you can imagine, we all bought popsicles, I specifically took strawberry, I can't remember exactly what each one took but I remember two of them, Pedro took apple and Ana took Blueberry.

First I will tell you what happened to me since that day, for the first 3 days I had terrible headaches and dizziness, I was so confused and hadn't thought it was the popsicle's fault initially.

After the 3rd day, the dizziness got worse, I almost fainted a few times, and now it was pain all over my body, and I didn't felt like getting out of bed.

But the worst thing happened this last week, I started having insomnia, sleep paralysis and hallucinations, I'm already so confused that I don't know what is real and what my mind created.

In addition, I am going through a deep mourning, Pedro died, his body was found near an apple plantation, the police said that there is no sign or clue but that his body was too disfigured to be suicide, and some of them even had to go to therapy after seeing the body.

I didn't dare to look at his body, but now I'm seeing hallucinations everywhere with blood and especially his face, I hear laughter that is not human saying that I am the next condemned and that my fate was ready.
I don't know how I see his body if I've never seen his body physically.

On top of all this, Ana is missing, she was last seen in a square during the early hours of the morning, she disappeared the day after we tried that popsicle and there are no clues so far and the police have stopped investigating. The only thing they found was a blade with her blood and her fingerprints on it, she was probably cutting herself but she had never done that before.

I contacted my other 3 friends recently, Julia, Oliver and Sophia, but they are isolating themselves just like I was, they barely respond to messages or leave the house, all i know is that oliver is vomiting a lot and basically can't eat, julia is very paranoid and scared of everything including us and sophia has become very angry and mean out of nowhere and now wishes harm to me and others and refuses to speak.

For me, the situation was already clear that there was something very bizarre about that popsicle, even though it didn't have a strange taste or appearance, it was too much of a coincidence that everything had happened. 

I told my parents, the police, but none of them believe me and the police said if there was a man matching that description in town they would have his files, but there is no man that sells ice cream with such appearance.

I started looking around the city, also staying hours in front of the restaurant to see if you showed up, but nothing happened so far.

I had already thrown the paper packaging away but since there is only one landfill in the city and it is the only place where the garbage goes, I decided to go there because the packaging could have a number, a logo, something that I didn't notice before but it would give me more information.

I couldn't actually get in there with permission, so I broke into the place early yesterday night. I searched for hours and the smell was unbearable, but after a long time I actually found it.

The funny thing is that I was next to several boxes with rotten strawberries, but I was too nervous to pay much attention, so I picked up the package and left. 

When I got home, no one was there, so I went to my room to examine the packaging, the ingredients looked normal and there was nothing obvious that would incriminate them, but there was also a company logo, I took my cell phone and recorded the packaging to show as evidence to the police.

So I decided to research the company on my phone but somehow there was no information about it online, When I was about to give up, there was a blackout in the city in the middle of the night, I had locked all the doors but I started hearing footsteps, I checked the video of the packaging I made but for some reason the video was completely black and didn't show anything.

I started recording the environment again and the same effect happened, I hid under the bed while I heard slow footsteps towards my room, then a strong wind started, even with the window closed, the package I was holding fell out of my hand, and then the blackout ended and I didn't hear any more footsteps.

I searched the whole house several times, I drove around town looking in dumpsters and again at the dump, but it was nowhere to be found, I decided to take a break at home so I came back.

The house was bizarre, dark as if the sun was not coming in and the lights were flickering, as soon as I took a step, I smelled rotten meat with fruit, I walked into my room and there was an apple and blueberry popsicle with blood stains on it and it said, "Do not enter where you are not called". I froze in fear and ran outside, I ended up tripping on blood that wasn't even on the floor when I entered, I tried to look at the popsicles again but they were gone too, when I looked forward, the blood in front of me wrote: "You're next".

I'm running around the city begging for help as I write this but everyone treats me like a crazy person, I don't know how much time I have left but please, someone help me.
