The scream of his brother watching him fall to his knees, blood gouging from his throat will forever be stuck in my head.

Everything felt so real, i was in the game, playing it live.  Shooting, dodging and jumping. Until I got hit and was sent back to the lobby until the next round. 

The waiting area was weird. It was like a blend of a forest, and some abandoned ancient civilization. The vines spreading over the maze-like map, the massive stone pyramid and the dark and foggy weather only made the eerie map more than perfect for a gamer of my caliber. Nothing beats a good mini game while waiting for the next round.

An odd noise came from the entrance of the maze. I swear I saw someone. My assault riffle was gone but no big deal, I am a super soldier, my fists can tear through steel and my armor has kept me safe for nuclear blasts. Plus it was just a mini game while waiting to go back to the real deal 

I followed the shadow as it progressed through the unsettling tunnels of the maze. "A normal human would have died of shear fear in this maze" I laughed to myself while sprinting with all i had to catch up with the shadow.

The why I was chasing the shadow was a mystery. It was calling me, challenging my inner and outer warrior, although the only sounds i heard were soft and quick footsteps.

Corner after corner, i finally made it to a caught up to the shadow.

There he was, the slick who believed he could get away with taunting me, stuck at a dead end with no other option than to fight me.

No a single word was uttered by either of us. I felt the burning rage in his eyes and his posture clearly meant business. "What a weird being i thought". The worn out Feudal Japanese warrior attire he wore made it clear he was no joke.

I had fought multiple squads in waves upon waves, and yet never had felt this feeling in my guts. I shouldn't be afraid nor excited nor perplexed. The ACES inhibitors we got injected as kids during the augmentation should have been preventing that.

By all means I knew this was my biggest foe. 

I was sharp and ready to rip him apart.

"Don't do it!" The child cried behind me.

Without even realizing the retractable blades in my arm deployed, i instantly turned and sliced his throat clean. 

As I dragged the blade away from the kid's throat, his little brother appeared behind him. His eyes, they were full of blood and tears.

I stabbed him in his heart.

In less than two seconds i had killed two children.

Then I heard it. The scream of the Samurai. I could see him scream, i could hear it. But it all made no sense. Why is this happening? How? This was just supposed to be a game? Who are this people? 

I had lost control, I would never do this, it must be a dream. 

Everything faded to black, and I felt conscious again. It was just a dream. I felt warm and satisfied, my worries were gone.

Then the stench hit me. 

My eyes opened.

The two children were lying next to me, rotting. The maze was on fire. The pyramid had crumbled. It was all real. 

Then the realization settled in.

It's not a dream. It's not even real life.

I am in hell.
