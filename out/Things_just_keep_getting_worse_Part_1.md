July 20.

I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this—the rules are confusing to me on whether posts need to be fictional or not. But I’m not sure where else to turn, so let’s just call this “based on actual events”. Because if I can just get the right person to understand the TYPE of terror I’ve been dealing with, maybe s/he will leave me a note about how to deal with it. It’s kinda like… surreal or psychological maybe… idk, I’ll just get right into it.

I recently signed my first lease—a studio apartment in a town just on the border of two northeastern states. I’ve been here about three months now. It’s not in a normal apartment complex; think more like boarding house vibes. It was once a big Georgian style home, but has since been split into four studio units. There are two slightly larger units on the first floor, and two smaller places upstairs. I’m in Unit C, upstairs, where the front windows overlook the street we’re on. There’s a dark, narrow side street out the windows on the western-facing wall, and the opposite side has my entry door, which is directly across a VERY narrow hallway from Unit D’s entry door. Dave lives there. D for Dave, haha…

I like Dave, but I did wonder at first if he was behind some of the freaky incidents I’ve been experiencing here, at least at the beginning. He’s an IT guy by trade, and has been an adjunct professor at one of the schools around here for about three years, I think he said. Now I’m not trying to stereotype here, but Dave is not your stereotypical Geek Squad looking kind of guy. He’s a 6-foot tall, 30-something, muscular Italian American with a great tan, and tattoos on one side from neck to wrist. He usually seems easy-going, but he’s apparently in some ongoing conflict with someone named Angel, and I can hear it when he loses his temper over the phone every so often. Thin walls, narrow halls, you can imagine. 

So I didn’t really get to know Dave for the first couple months I lived here. And it wasn’t fair for me to be suspicious of him just because he’s all big and muscly and occasionally hot-tempered. But he knows what he’s doing with the IT stuff—which is kind of how my troubles here started.

Back in June, I was on my laptop one night finishing up the latest post on my website. I run a site that connects people dealing with physical and mental health issues with support groups, doctors, insurance advocates, etc. Anyway, as I went to save my work onto my thumb drive, the screen went black. I was so upset for a second about not having saved it yet… and then a message flashed on the screen that said, “Eye Sea Ewe,” before disappearing and returning to my normal screen. I was too shocked to move for a second, but I quickly saved my document and shut my computer. I decided I’d post it the next morning. I took an edible and went to sleep.

The next day I woke up feeling like I’d dreamed the whole thing. I called my sister, who is more tech-savvy than I am, and told her what happened. I was hoping for an explanation that made me feel better about it, but she thought I was making it up. I let it go and tried not to think about it. I had a shift at my day-job from 10-6, and by the time I was headed home I actually felt pretty good leaving the previous night’s events behind me. Until I got within about a half-block from my apartment and saw my side window was partially open with the bottom of the curtain hanging out. I had the AC unit in the other window running all day, so I definitely did not leave that open. 

I didn’t know what to do—calling the police felt like overkill. I could’ve rang Unit A, where Mrs. Lovetts lives, since she’s been here the longest and is kinda the “mom” of the building. But I didn’t really know her well yet, and didn’t want to bother her with “my window’s open will you help me.” So I started up the stairs and felt a little better when I saw my door was still completely shut. But something about this building and its dark corners and claustrophobic halls makes normal things so much harder… so I knocked on Unit D.

Dave opened his door and I told him about the window. He nodded and waited for me to unlock my door, giving me a look somewhere between smug and friendly. He went in ahead of me and looked around before clearing his throat loudly and saying, “Ok looks like we’re all good here. I didn’t need the Glock after all!” He winked at me and gave another thorough look around before heading back to the door. 

I was suddenly terribly embarrassed and apologized for bothering him for that. He said “Don’t worry about it. Coulda been something, right? Don’t be embarrassed. I see you.” He winked again and closed his door behind him. I couldn’t move. What the hell? Is that something people say? He was just saying he understood me and my actions right? But why say it that way?

So thinking logically here—if my computer hadn’t had that message the night before, I never would’ve even thought anything about Dave’s choice of words. Which technically means that I shouldn’t have assumed it was connected. But the IT guy that likes to wink and lives RIGHT NEXT DOOR said the same thing that some hacker or something wrote in a weirder way on my computer THE NIGHT BEFORE. Wouldn’t I be crazy not to connect it?

Well that’s just the start. It’s not much, and it’s nothing compared to what started happening a couple weeks later. I think this post is already running long though. So I’m going to continue this in a day or two when I get some time to organize and write out my thoughts about what all has been going on here.
