15 years. Hard to believe it’s been 15 years since all of that. I’ve managed to scrounge up all of my journal entries during that time. It wasn’t an easy job, but someone had to do it.

 

It’s just like the title says. I couldn’t tell you exactly how it came to be, but I can try. I believe it was a Monday when Jarvis asked me the question.

“Hey man, you want to hunt demons together?”

I was shocked from the sudden question and looked over at him.  

“Hunt? Demons? You want to hunt demons?”

“Yeah. I’m bored and it sounds like fun.”

And that was how he roped me into it. Now, you may say that I don’t have enough of a spine or that I should have said no, but do you think an 18-year-old you would have declined the invitation? Right, didn’t think so.

Anyways. The first step in our operation was, well, finding demons to hunt. Jarvis had the brilliant idea to scour forums and local groups in our hometown.

It was a rather simple solution, but you have to understand that two guys trying to hunt demons aren’t exactly Einstein.

“So, what do we ask them?” Jarvis was thinking really hard, and I was too.

“Wait.” I said, Jarvis looked at me as though there was an imaginary lightbulb above my head. “We can just ask them if they need any demon problems dealt with!”

Like I said, not exactly Einstein.

We both made accounts for the respective forums. I made the first post.

I didn’t exactly know what to say, so I put together the best post I could.

“HELLO!!! We are first-time demon hunters trying to find our way in the occult world. If you have ANY demon related problems, reply in the comments and tell us about it! We await your call ; D.”

I personally thought it was genius, but Jarvis laughed me off.

“Mark, you numbskull. That’s not how you do it.” He pulled up his phone and showed me his introductory message. “THIS is how you do it!”

I looked at his phone and tried to stifle my laughter.

“Erm, y’all got any demons you need hunted?”

I looked at him, a mile wide grin making its way across my face.

“Dude… that’s… so garbage.”

He pushed away from me and made a jerk-off motion with his hand.

“Better than yours, balls-for-brains! Anyways, mine *sticks* with the lingo of today.”

I looked at him, puzzled.

“Now just what does that mean?”

“Gen Z, Marky, they get me.”

“Nobody has responded yet, idiot. Mine is absolutely better than you—.”

***DING.***

We both diverted our attention back to the phones on the table. A notification rang out on… MINE!

“HA HA!” I said, pointing at Jarvis. “Mine DID work!”

“Whatever dude. When you’re done blowing yourself, I’ll be waiting to see if it was a response to your question.”

After I calmed down, I picked up my phone and opened up the notification.

“I saw your post. Is what you said true?”

I looked at Jarvis.

“Job number one, baby.”

“Don’t call me that.”

I brushed him off and began to reply.

“Yes, we are newly formed hunters looking for business in our local dump of a town.”

Oh, I should probably mention that we don’t have the proper equipment to hunt demons, huh?

“—And we don’t have weapons yet, so I’ll get back to you ;).”

 I looked over at Jarvis.

“Hey man, what do we have for weapons?”

He looked around quizzically.

“Well… I’m not sure. I’ve got a hatchet and a handgun at my house.”

“Cool, wait. I C—.”

“I already have dibs on the handgun, moron.”

“Fuck.”

We headed over to his house to get the weapons. Our next step was to get them into demon fighting condition. It was time to do some research.

 

What followed were several caffeine, 5-Hour Energy and frozen pizza fueled nights as we toiled away at our computers, looking for ways to enhance our weapons.

On the 4^(th) night of what was likely to destroy our bodies, we found our mark.

Well, I guess it’d be more accurate to say Jarvis found it, but still.

We could have a priest bless our weapons.

We decided to do it the next day.

“No—no, we’re not here to attack anybody. Listen, I know what it looks like but we’re actually here to have these weapons blessed!”

Smooth was I with the words.

Surprisingly enough, it worked, and the priest brought us to the back room.

“You two. Young men. Are you sure about this? Demon hunting is a dangerous thing to do.”

“Yeah, I’m sure. Don’t know about that guy though.” I said, pointing to Jarvis.

A look of betrayal spread across his face. He stammered and spoke.

“N—no, I—fuck.”

“Language.”

“Sorry, yes, I’m sure as well.”

“Okay, that’s all I needed.”

He grabbed a container filled with what I assumed to be holy water and dipped the hatched in it.

II didn’t have to worry about water damage considering it was a stainless-steel blade and a carbon fiber handle. He closed his eyes and spoke.

“To this tool. May Almighty God Bless you, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.”

The container began to glow.

And then it *flashed*.

When my vision cleared up, I saw that the once black steel of the hatchet was now a divine white color with golden accents and a handle the same color.

“Woah.” Jarvis said, handing the priest his handgun. “Can you do that for me?”

“Yes, but allow me to explain the properties of the axe now. Since I blessed it with holy water, it can hurt demons. In addition to that, no mortal force can damage it, and it demons can do very little to it either. That does not mean they can’t hurt *you*, though.”

“Awesome.” I said, taking my hatchet.

The priest did the same thing with Jarvis’s gun, putting it in the water and saying the same phrase.

“To this tool. May Almighty God Bless you, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.”

It glowed, erupted in light, and soon donned the same color scheme as my axe.

“This pistol,” The priest said, “has an interesting property to it. Not only can demons be harmed by the bullets that come out of it, but it is nearly indestructible.”

“Sweet!” Jarvis said. “But uh, what’s the ammo situation?”

“Oh,” the priest said, “I nearly forgot to mention; it has an infinite number of bullets contained within it.”

Jarvis and I looked at each other. We were thinking the same thing.

“So. Fucking. Awesome.”

The priest looked at us.

“Lastly,” he said, pulling out two golden objects, “these are talismans of protection. They will allow you to receive non-fatal damage when fighting demons. I’ve configured them so you can use them as necklaces.”

We took them and put them on.

“Thanks, Mr. Priest man. Oh, is this gonna cost anything?”

“$100 for the whole thin—.” The money was in his hand, and we were out the door before he could finish talking.

 

By the time Jarvis and I got to my house, there were hundreds of replies in our comment section. We decided the best way to go about taking care of them would be to simply tick em’ off one by one.

And that’s just what we did.

It’s getting late, and I have work tomorrow, so I think I’m going to log off for now, but I’ll write about our first demon encounter as soon as I can.

This is former demon hunter Mark, signing off.
