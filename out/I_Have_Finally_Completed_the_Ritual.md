“What the fuck are you doing here, Morgan?”

I turned my head around at the awful, shrill voice. My sister, Vanity, stood at the door with a fearful look. She stormed past me to the small window of the attic. “You’re gonna suffocate Uncle Max if this smoke gets downstairs!” She pushed up the sash, letting in the hot New Orleans morning air of Cajun and rain. 

“Don’t get your thong in a twist, Vanity,” I said. “It’s just some candles.” I almost forgot Uncle Max was spending the day in our house. He had shat all over our toilet this morning from last evening’s party and had to nurse a stomachache on our couch. His asthmatic lungs didn’t do well in unclean air, but I didn’t think some light candle-smoke would do much harm to him.

“The fuck do you need *candles* for?” Vanity turned away from the window. Her eyes went wide when she saw the ground. “And what the hell is *that*?!” She pointed to the symbol I knelt next to. It consisted of one large circle with the name Andromalius and a smaller circle inside with four “I” letters arranged to form the corners of a square, the letter “S” in the upper middle space, and vertically intersecting lines with ornaments.

“That’s none of your business, fuck off,” I said and lit up the last candle to finish the circle of five candles around the sigil.

“Bitch, it *is* my business if you plan on burning the house down or some shit.” Vanity crossed her arms at her chest. “Tell me or I’ll call mom and tell her you stole her bath salts. I can see them on the ground.”

I rolled my eyes but gave in, because I had no intention of explaining to my mother why I needed her lemon rosemary and dead sea bath salts. The devout Christian she was, she would not approve of my plans.

I thought I had locked the door…

“*And,*” Vanity bent over and peered at the book in my hand, “is that Mrs. Mondale’s book of herbs? Did you *steal* it from her?”

I was tempted to scare my little sister away using one of the candles as an approaching bogeyman—since she was afraid of fire—but I didn’t want her to tell mom. I had to keep Vanity here and feed her information. That was always what she craved and what shut her big pubescent mouth after she was full.

“No, Vanity,” I said. “I didn’t steal the book. Mrs. Mondale gave it to me a year ago.” That was a lie. Mrs. Mondale shared her grievances about the loss of her book with me the day after I took it, and I stood there on her porch, nodding and faking condolences. Fortunately, she didn’t voice any suspicion towards me or my sister. She was too fond of us for that. We were of great help in her garden each weekend, pulling out weeds and watering her many fruit trees. Our mother forced us to help Mrs. Mondale with her gardening endea~~v~~ors because she was old and helpless. Helpless, my ass! A helpless person couldn’t ride a bike like she was racing the Tour de France.

“All right, but what are you doing with her book of herbs in here?” asked Vanity and pointed to the ground. “And what the fuck is that symbol?”

I gnawed at my lip in mock ponder. “Well, you see, Vanity…” I leaned over my knees toward her and whispered: “I’m summoning a *demon*.”

I expected Vanity to be spooked, which I then planned to take advantage of and prevent her from telling mom. But instead of fear, my sister’s face twisted in disbelief. “Come on, quit the jokes. What are you *really* doing?”

My mischievous smile fell. “No, seriously,” I said. “I’m about to summon a demon.”

“Demons ain’t real, Morgan,” she said annoyedly. “Stop this shit.”

I pursed my lips. I was getting really pissed, but I had to admit she had no reason to believe me. Our mother, though herself bound by the Lutheran faith, let us grow up freethinkers, and we chose not to believe in God or anything supernatural. But a year ago… I saw some shit. And when I then glanced into this book while Mrs. Mondale was busy in her kitchen, I realized the ‘shit I saw’ could help me. It took me ten months to carry out the ritual and I was finally finishing the *last* step.

“All right.” I eased my juicy ass back on my feet. “What evidence do you need to believe me?”

“Well, show me the demon,” Vanity said.

“Bitch, I don’t have one yet, I’m about to conjure one.”

Vanity scoffed. “Okay, then show me the conjuring. And *then* the demon.”

“You really wanna stay for this? You’re usually spooked from everything *remotely* scary. You want to see a *demon*?”

“There’s not gonna be any demon,” said Vanity and went around the sigil to sit next to me. “I just wanna see you make an ass of yourself doing some voodoo shit.”

I didn’t know what got into me. Maybe it was her disbelief and smugness that drove my lukewarm belief in the supernatural into certainty. Now I could almost see the horns and the head of the pet snake of the Earl emerging from the center of his sigil, and I haven’t even recited the words yet.

A grin graced my lips. “All right, Vanity. *Watch* and then *piss* yourself.”

Vanity scoffed again, but I saw her eyes follow every movement of my hand. She watched as I put thyme in between each of the five candles.

“Why are you using a book about *herbs* when you want to summon a demon?” Vanity asked.

“Well, turns out, it’s not a book of herbs," I said. "It’s a book of candles and sigils—an occult encyclopedia.” I closed the book and pointed at its front cover. “This here isn’t just some new age bullshit herb symbol. It’s another symbol for Lucifer aside from the pentagram.”

“And what’s it about?” Vanity asked.

I opened the book again and got to the page I was working with. “It has information about the Goetia demons. I don’t expect you to know what that is, and I don’t have enough patience to explain it all to you. The important part is this.” I tilted the open page towards her and pointed to the picture of a man dressed in a cape with a snake around his shoulders. “This is Andromalius, the Great Earl of Hell,” I said. “He is one of the 72 Goetic demons. That’s basically Hell’s nobility.”

Vanity scrunched up her nose. “And you *really* believe this shit?”

“Yes,” I said. “That man I told you I saw on the street one night in the French Quarter? That was *definitely* a demon. You can think whatever, I know I’m not crazy.”

“The crazy never thinks he’s crazy,” said Vanity.

I rolled my eyes. “Shut up and watch if you wanna see.”

“But why that one?” Vanity asked. “If there’s 72 two of them…”

I sighed and said: “Because this one ‘is to bring back both a Thief and the Goods which be stolen,’ as the book says. And I want to get back grandma’s money.” Before she passed, our affluent grandma left me, Vanity, and our mom a great fortune. Nothing for Uncle Max though, he was a gambler and was addicted to collecting beer cans.

“Morgan, that was *two* years ago,” said Vanity annoyedly. “Just get over it. We’ll never know who stole it and we won’t get the money back. No magical dude is gonna bring them back.”

“I’m not giving up on those three million,” I said. “Have you ever entertained the life we could have had with them? I could have gone to a private school—maybe Tulane, maybe one of the Ivies—not this pathetic community college shit I had to resort to.”

“Wow, you really *are* desperate,” said Vanity with a contemptuous scowl.

“Desperate,” I said, “but about to get my three million back.”

“Those weren’t only yours, all three of us were supposed to share them *evenly*,” Vanity said, but I ignored her whining and closed my eyes. I breathed in and out. Then I opened them, held the book out in front of my face and recited the words. I hoped the ritual wasn’t strict on pronunciation, because I definitely butchered most of the words. The book was written in English, except for the parts of the spells under each demon. I assumed they were in Latin. Or maybe it was Hebrew. Either way, I had no idea what the right pronunciation was, and neither was there any guideline to that. Vanity said nothing during the recital, but mocking giggles escaped her here and there.

I stopped. Anticipation brewed inside of me like a hot cauldron, my eyes glued to the sigil. Nothing was happening so far, but I had a strong feeling something would occur soon.

“You’re insane.” Vanity laughed and stood up. “Just stop this shit already. You see? Nothing happened. I’m going back downstairs.”

But she didn’t even take a step towards the door, for the sigil glowed, and we both froze. Among the glow emerged black dust. I stood up with overjoyed gasps as I waited for Earl Andromalius to emerge from the sigil, with his majestic horns, robust build, a snake boa around his waist and arms, setting his wise eyes on me, asking me what my wish will be…

No horns rose from the ground. Rather, the black dust swirled into height and puff! It receded and, in the circle, stood a man with a yellow snake tail for his lower body. He looked young, yet his style was reminiscent of a forty-year-old farmer. He wore a white shirt and a brown cowboy vest. His brown hair was lush but unkempt and he had a thick mustache.

I looked at Vanity. She stood like an ice statue, with her mouth agape.

The man took out the cigarette from his mouth and puffed. “Yo. You got some smokes?” He had a Southern accent punctuated by a drunk slur.

My shoulders slumped at the confusing sight. “What?” I asked.

“Cigarettes, dumbass.”

I stared at him. “Are you… Andromalius? The Great Earl of Hell?”

“*Fuck* no.” The man scowled. “Do I look like some fancy fucker?”

My eyelids fluttered. “Who *are* you then?”

“Your former president Hoover,” he said and then burst into a hissing laughter. “Nah, I’m just fucking with ya. I’m an avarus. One of the snake demons from the Ring of Greed, to make it easier for ya. But Hoover’s in Greed too, by the way.”

“What?” I couldn’t believe it. Not that Hoover was in the Ring of Greed—that was a totally befitting fate. But I expected a majestic, powerful Earl, and what I got was some redneck-looking snake man. “How come you appear so… well… *human*?”

“Oh shit, do I?” The man took a drag from his cigarette. “Well, I guess livin’ with four Sinners does that to ya. Prices are fuckin’ sky-high in Greed if ya ain’t a rich fuck. So, I’m rentin’ my flat.”

“Sinners?” I asked.

“Yuh. Humans who made deals with demons when they were alive. You end up in the Ring the demon you tethered yourself to is in.”

I shook from the terror and puzzlement.

“Stop tweaking like you a Hawaiian doll on a car desk, I ain’t doing nothing to you,” the man said.

“But… but… I don’t understand.” I said. “I was supposed to summon *Andromalius*.”

“Oh, yeah. Andromalius. Crazy man. We crossed paths one day. He didn’t want to keep bein’ summoned anymore so he sold me his sigil. Didn’t give me no extra money though, pompous Goetic asshole.”

“So… Are *you* going to fulfill my wish?” I asked.

The man barked a laugh. “Oh, hell nah! I can’t fulfill no wishes. I’m just a lowly avarus.”

I tried not to cry as I realized that my months-long effort proved unsuccessful. I have poured so many hours into that ritual; I have checked every little thing to make sure I haven’t fucked anything up and all I got was… *this*.

“So, you got smokes or nah?” the man asked.

“Why would you want a cigarette? You already have one.”

“But I want more. You got some or nah? Yes or no question.”

“No, I don’t sm—”

“Well, in that case, I’m out! See ya!” The man slithered past me and Vanity. My little sister yelped and threw her arms around me. I instinctively caught her, but then we looked at each other and realized what we did. We quickly withdrew from each other.

The snake man was at the attic door.

“W-Wait!” I called. “Where are you going?”

“Out,” he said. “To see if the mortal world is really like what my roommates described. And to get s’more smokes.”

He pressed the handle but then turned back to us. “Where we at, by the way?”

“New Orleans,” I said.

His face lit up. “*New Orleans?* *Really*? My roommate Cole is from New Orleans! He used to be a voodoo enthusiast. But wait, why am I tellin’ you this shit? You ain’t no use to me. Ya just a lil’ bitch.” He shook his head, opened the door, and disappeared behind them.

I looked at Vanity, whose eyes were wider than my ass and skin whiter than the White House. I wanted to tell her: “See, bitch, I told you demons were real,” but I was too paralyzed by whatever the *fuck* I just saw was to speak.
