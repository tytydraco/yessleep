I’ve never been particularly good at anything. You know that feeling you get when you try something new and it just ‘clicks’, everything makes sense, you’ve got a real knack for it? Yeah, I’ve never really had that feeling. I’m unathletic, painfully average in my studies, not great at music or making friends or getting girls, nothing. 



If you’re sharp, or, I guess, nitpicky, you’ll be asking yourself “how does he know what it feels like to be a natural at something if he’s never experienced it?” Well, because for once in my life, three weeks ago, I finally did. It was so wonderful, I was elated. Now, though, I wish I never had that feeling. I wish I’d stayed in ignorance, blissful, blissful ignorance, I wouldn’t be cursed with knowing what I now know. 



Anyway, I should explain before I get carried away. 



Monday three weeks ago, I walk to school like it’s any old day. I’m struggling because I’ve been up playing playstation until 2 am as usual, so the lights are on upstairs but nobody’s home. I trudge into class and take some half-hearted notes, stare a bit at Elle Lamonte in front of me, when my friend, Ari, taps me on the shoulder and begins the conversation that will seal my fate. After seeing the bags under my eyes and recoiling a little, telling me I need to get more sleep, he says he read something interesting online: “Jamie, you’ve gotta try this,” he insists. He tells me that with a bit of practice and awareness, a normal person can experience *lucid dreaming*, which I’d always thought was some sci-fi thing, but he promises me it’s real, anybody can learn to ‘wake up’ inside their own dream, and do whatever they want. He tells me he’s not great at it yet, but he’s managed it once or twice. Not full awareness, he says. He realises he’s dreaming, but part of his brain is still sleeping, so he’s not really thinking logically or in any complex way, but still, he says the experience is really cool.



I take it with a grain of salt, to be honest. Ari has been known to tell a few tall tales, so my hopes aren’t particularly high, but still, I figure there’s no harm in looking it up when I get home that afternoon. My initial searches show me that there may have been truth to Ari’s words after all. I read up on some basic techniques, how to check if you’re in a dream, that you should never make the *assumption* that you’re in reality. I check if there are any serious risks, which apparently exist, but are rare. Sleep paralysis sounds kind of scary, and a few people complain of irritating headaches for a few days after they lucid dream, but I don’t come across anything too horrendous. 



Anyway, the websites all say not to expect results too quickly, and it’s a slow burn, so I rush through my homework, eat dinner and play playstation for a few hours before heading off to bed at 9, which my mum does think is a bit weird, but she doesn’t question it, just happy to see me getting a decent sleep for once, I guess. 



I know it said not to get my hopes up, but I admit, I did. Before long, I drift off to sleep, and then it happens. 



As if from nowhere, I awake. I’m at home, playing playstation like usual, but even without doing any tests or checks, I realise it: I’m in a dream. 



 I remember what Ari told me, and what I had read online: that it takes time to gain proper awareness in a lucid dream; at first it’s a sluggish train of thought, struggling against the brain’s natural inclination to shut itself down while asleep. I feel nothing like that, though. I feel incredible, more awake than when I’m *actually* awake. I look at my hand and marvel: my vision is crystal clear, my movements smooth and fluid, I stand up, feel infinite possibilities course through me and smile uncontrollably.



Remember that feeling I talked about? Of being a “natural”? Well, this was it. I knew this was finally it, something I was genuinely *amazing* at. I had full control of my dream. I snapped my fingers and my dingy room was at once replaced with a gorgeous sparkling beach, pearl-white sand and aquamarine ocean stretching out to the horizon. A banquet sprung up before me, covered in fried chicken, bacon-and-egg sandwiches, everything I could ever want. I looked behind me and there she was: Elle from class. 



Clad in a black two-piece that contrasted starkly to her seashell-pale skin, she grinned and pulled me into an embrace, closing her wonderful round, blue eyes wordlessly and kissed me. 



It was exactly how I had imagined it. Well, perhaps owing to the fact that I *was* imagining it, but still, it was so *visceral,* so *real.* I could feel her warmth, hear her voice exactly as she sounded in real life, it was uncanny. 



I pushed her away for a moment, smiling slyly, and conjured up with a mere notion, Richard Wrenn. I haven’t mentioned Richard until now because, well, he’s fundamentally quite unimportant, but just trust me on this: he’s a dick. And so, I took great satisfaction in directing him to stand ten metres from me, levelling my arm at him, and transforming my arm into a plasma cannon that proceeded to blast a two-foot-diameter hole in his torso. You might think this was a little cruel, and yes, maybe it was, but it wasn’t like he was *real*. He was just in my imagination. If he’d made me suffer a whole bunch in real life, I figured a little dream revenge that couldn’t actually hurt him wasn’t so bad in return. 



After watching him suffer for a moment, I vanished his burning corpse, and returned to my banquet, and to Elle.



I won’t bore you with the details of the next few hours, but just take this for my word: It was genuinely the most fun I’d ever had. Any wish that occurred to me, whatever I wanted, it was instantly granted. 



The only thing that bothered me was… this little feeling. The best way I can describe it is: sometimes when I’m playing playstation and my mum isn’t home, I feel this sensation like she’s watching me from behind, and I turn around, even though I know she’s out and can’t possibly be there. It was a bit like that, like even though I was totally alone, like there were eyes burning into the back of my head. 



It was a little thing, though, and I only felt it briefly, once or twice, so I just ignored it. Eventually, I felt the dream start to fade as my sleep cycle naturally ended, and I woke up to a new day. 



It was an odd concoction of emotions: on one hand I felt incredibly well-rested. Most mornings I could barely drag myself out of bed, but today I felt revitalised, energetic, totally ready-to-do-it. I attributed this partly to actually getting a good night’s sleep for once, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that the lucid dream had something to do with it as well. Not only was it a great time, but it seemed to be like super-sleep, I was totally refreshed. 



Anyway, I walked to school more peppily than ever before, even having a little swagger in my step for a change. It felt odd seeing Elle in real life after my dream, but I played it cool and waved to her as I walked in, and to my surprise she gave me a big smile and waved back. It wasn’t uncommon for her to just blank me, so this was actually pretty big. It wasn’t making out on the beach, but still, a nice bonus to my already great morning. 



I couldn’t help but tell Ari how great I was doing, and how amazing my lucid dream was after I sat down beside him in class. 



“Well, that makes one of us,” he grimaced back at me. 



He told me he’d had another sort-of half lucid dream last night, but now he had a splitting headache. I nodded and told him I’d read that could happen, he must’ve got unlucky. He seemed kind of jealous when I told him how incredible my dream had been, but I think he wasn’t entirely sure I was telling the truth, which I thought was a bit rich coming from him. 



Anyway, the next few days were sort of a fuzzy blur. I won’t go through every little thing, but I’ll give you the highlights. In short: they were awesome. Every night I had an amazing, full awareness lucid dream: I hung out with Ari, with Elle, feasted, explored the world and even the galaxy, it was genuinely too perfect to describe. In real life, too, I can’t fully explain it, but I think because I knew I could get whatever I wanted in my dream, I stopped worrying so much about the little things in day-to-day life, and so it all just flowed more easily. I was bursting with energy every day, I started talking to Elle for real, having lunch with her a couple of times. I even ran into Richard Wrenn in the corridor one day, and he just sort of winced and walked off without even hurling an insult at me! Everyone told me I was looking great, the bags under my eyes were gone, I even aced a maths test that I’d thought I’d be lucky to escape with a C. It was all coming up roses. 



There were little niggles, though. That feeling… The one of eyes burning into the back of my head, it didn’t really go away. Every night, I’d feel it for a little while, before it went away. I considered that I was imagining it, but part of me thought it stayed a little longer each night. 



I looked it up on the forums, but nobody else ever described anything like it. One thing I noticed, weirdly, though, was that a *lot* of people were complaining of severe headaches after lucid dreaming, just like Ari had. I searched old posts, and it turns out that these complaints had only started up in the past few months. At first, it was a few obscure mentions of mild headaches, but now there were multiple every day about real severe ones, so bad the people considered never trying to lucid dream again afterwards. 



I did think it was weird that the posts seemed to come out of nowhere in the past few months, but it wasn’t like it had anything to do with me. Even if I wanted to put my tinfoil hat on, the posts complaining about the headaches well pre-dated my starting to lucid dream, so it was impossible that they were related. 



Anyway, maybe a week after I started to lucid dream, something a little… weird happened. 



I was chilling as always in dreamland, when just for a moment, everything faded to black, and I heard something. 



… 



“Arm the… tachyon cannons.” 



… 



“Are you sure, sir?’ 



… 



“Yes, we’re… doing them a favour. It’s for the best… Do it.”



…



The voices had a strange cadence to them, and the words of the conversation were seared into my brain, I couldn’t have forgotten them if I tried. 



My dream world was back afterwards, only having been gone for a few seconds. It was a little disconcerting, to be sure, but normality returned soon afterwards, and I felt just as amazing as usual the next day. 



I chalked it up to an anomaly, maybe too many sci-fi video games kicking around in my thoughts. It was certainly a preferable side effect to the horrific headaches that kept popping up in the forums. I didn’t think much of it. 



At least, for the next few days. 



The forum posts about the headaches came with increasing frequency, but what *really* made me take notice was the next week, when I saw on tv: a news story. Several people had slipped into comas in their sleep, many were young and healthy, it was totally unexplained. 



I think I may have been the first to put two and two together when I realised: a very frequent poster on one of the lucid dreaming forums, a great helping hand to newcomers, out of nowhere, had simply vanished. 



Now, I’ll admit, this scared me a bit. The risk of a headache was one thing, but a coma was another entirely. I considered trying to let the authorities know about what I’d noticed, but less than a day after I’d realised, they cottoned on, too. Official medical advice was issued across the globe: The medical causes were not entirely understood, but several people had lapsed into comas from which they had not awakened, due to lucid dreaming. 



Now I was properly frightened. I decided enough was enough. I’d had my fun, the dream world was fantastic, but it wasn’t worth the risk. Besides, my real life was going so great, I didn’t really need the dreams anymore anyway. Ari had been spooked by the news, but he and I were getting along great, and Elle and I had even hung out after school a few times, I was bucking up the courage to officially ask her out. Richard Wrenn hadn’t really shown his face, but my least favourite teacher, who I admit had appeared in my dream world a few times, had transferred schools a bit out of nowhere. I didn’t want to kill the golden goose, so I decided: I’d stop lucid dreaming, and focus on pressing my advantage in the real world. 



And, well, that should have been the end of it. I came to this decision about a week and a half ago. Goodbye, then, Jamie Aster signing out.



… 



Except, of course, it wasn’t that simple. 



When I went to bed that night, I woke up on that same wonderful beach. The sapphire waves, the fine, white sand. There was a totally different air to it now, though. 



I was aware. I was lucid. 



It was one thing to *choose* to lucid dream, it was another entirely to realise that the habit had become so ingrained that you couldn’t shake it. 



I shrugged my shoulders and figured, well, I did the crime, I might as well do the time, and so I had my fun. 



The mood was a bit dampened by the fact that I was honestly a bit scared that I’d slip into a coma and never wake up. That being-watched feeling hadn’t left, either. If anything, it was almost constant now, to the point that I was so used to it that I barely noticed it anymore. 



As per usual, though, the dream eventually faded, and I woke up in my bed, feeling fresh and new. I couldn’t help feeling, though, that the irrepressible energy coursing through me was just slightly less than it had been the previous day. I attributed it to the stress, and walked to school as usual. 



The next few days, things really started to get unsettling. Sorry if you’ve been enjoying the feel-good mentions of daily school life, because you won’t be getting many anymore. Everyone was worried now. Dozens, then hundreds of people worldwide were slipping into comas, every day, and it wasn’t just lucid dreamers anymore. They’d go to sleep, perfectly healthy, and then never wake up. People everywhere went back and forth between talking and speculating endlessly in a paranoid state, and burying their heads in the sand and pretending it wasn’t happening. 



I didn’t know what felt worse: worrying myself sick over something I didn’t understand and couldn’t stop, or pretending it wasn’t happening and sleepwalking into my potential oblivion. 



That might sound a little melodramatic, but it’s true. Every day, thousands more fell  into comas, people panicked: it was all the news could talk about, mum came in and gave an increasingly forlorn and emotional “goodnight” each evening. 



Elle even texted me before bed for the first time. 



“*Goodnight, Jamie. I… hope I see you again at school tomorrow. I’ll be honest. I’m scared.”* 



Again, I remember it word for word, because even as worried as I was, it still felt amazing to hear from her. I called her up to reassure her, then went to sleep as always. 



I’d put on a brave face for my mum, and for Elle, but as uneasy as my waking life had become, I think I still preferred it over what my nightly inevitable lucid dream had become. 



What had once been paradise had become purgatory: A flat world where I simply could not shake my own paranoia, my growing fear. 



Any attempt at escapism felt hollow and I simply could not, no matter how I tried, force myself to be even a little distracted. As a result, I simply existed passively in the dream, awaiting the moment it would finally fade with anticipation that grew with each passing night. 



Also aggregating with each subsequent dream was the general feeling of uneasiness, and even dread, that permeated the atmosphere of my own dream world. I found, as my own mental state deteriorated, so too did my ability to maintain a pleasant environment in my dreams. 



Each night, the beach, which had become my default dream setting, seemed to grow a little darker. The sand grew grimier, the water more turbid. At first I thought I was imagining it, but after a few days I stood under a stormy sky, on filthy  sand strewn with rubbish, beside water choked with debris and spiny seaweed. 



Four days ago. That’s when I fully realised it. The daily coma numbers had reached the tens of thousands. People were staying home from school. There was even talk of shutting them down. Everyone I knew was panicking. I could barely focus on my playstation, let alone my homework. I went from living in fear each day, to living a nightmare every time I closed my eyes. I still felt rested and rejuvenated each morning, but even that sensation was fading. It felt almost like a cruel joke at this point, like my body was at odds with the world around me. 



It was that night. Three sleeps ago. I sat, inert, inside my decaying dream purgatory. A few nights prior to this I would have been panicked, trying to stop the rot, but I was resigned at this point. I retreated further inside my head, suppressing my own awareness. I would wake soon, I thought. That would at least bring some release, even if it was only through a different sort of torment. 



As if it were a great bolt of lightning, striking a desolate stretch of silent, dead Earth, it appeared. 



Richard Wrenn flashed before me, and turned to face me. 



I realised, as soon as I gazed upon his visage, that these were the eyes that had been watching me, ever since my first lucid dream. 



I also realised that this was not simply Richard Wrenn. As soon as he entered my eyeline, as soon as his mental presence came within proximity of my own, I felt an overwhelming sense of panic overcome me. It was not ordinary fear. No, what I felt was akin to the sensation one feels when a bright torchlight is pressed against one’s eyelid. Even though the eye closes, and the body does everything it can to cope, it is simply powerless to repel the sheer force of the entity it is confronted with. 

My dream world felt as if it were a pea inside its pod, faced with a supermassive star forcing its way in. I screamed, and fell to the floor, managing to perceive, even as I clawed at my own eyes, Richard Wrenn smile grimly as I writhed in agony. 



“Quail, feeble one, at the deliverance, in the form you so fear, of the World Eater.” 



Hearing it speak, in a voice that was certainly not Richard’s, assaulted my senses through their inability to comprehend it. The words made sense, but each syllable seemed somehow pregnant with meaning fathoms beyond my brain’s paltry capacity. It was this night that I truly came to realise the pettiness of my own existence, the inadequacy of my cognition and senses, the truly inconsequential nature of every action I had ever taken, every ambition I had ever possessed. 



As soon as he had arrived, he flashed once more and my dream world returned, although I had not. 



I remained on the tainted sand, hyperventilating, my mind struggling to form a coherent thought in the face of the firestorm with which it had been faced. It took hours for me to recover my senses, and when I did, I simply sat, knees pressed to my chest, and quivered with terror. That is how I wiled away my sentence that night. I am not certain how many hours I spent in the dream in that state, but when I woke, I was overjoyed. 



It superseded every joyful awakening sensation I had ever felt after a lucid dream. Every petty pleasure within the dream world, every previously treasured success in the real world, each one paled pathetically in comparison to the pure bliss of awakening shivering, cold, and in pain all over. 



Of rising to find blood dripping from my eyes, cold sweat oozing forth from every pore, shudders wracking my whole body. Every movement was ecstasy, simply for having escaped the dream world where I had faced that horror. The World Eater. 



Since then, it is difficult to describe my experience, difficult as the language developed by us human beings was intended to explain things that could reasonably happen in our lives. “Suffering” is viewed in the lens of suffering within normal human existence. As such, I cannot so easily describe the next two days: I lay, catatonic in my bed, bleeding from my eyes and from where my fingernails had scratched into my skin, for I scarcely felt even the slightest stimulation from waking pain anymore, and rather than attempting to scratch myself I merely failed to notice when my nails had rent open my flesh. I paid no heed to my mother’s concerns, nor to Elle or Ari’s texts or calls. I did not play my playstation, nor even consider going to school, I merely lay in bed quaking with fear until I inevitably could not force myself to stay awake any longer. 



My waking life was bliss compared to being tortured by the world eater during my sleep: subjected to a phantasmagoria of images beyond the furthest fathoms of my reckoning, and yet nonetheless capable of evoking unimaginable pain, terror, and despair in my mind, feeble as it was. 



The World Eater did not speak to me any further. It had no need to, I gleaned understanding of its thoughts through its ransacking the every entrail of my psyche. I felt its growing boredom with drawing the human race into an eternal oblivion of nightmare, and its ponderings on finding a new civilisation to annihilate. Its subtle glee at discovering the alien spacecraft that tracked it, and planned to annihilate Earth with tachyon weaponry to save us our eternal damnation, only to be conquered by the World Eater themselves, its mockery and disappointment at seeing humanity’s most gifted at control within the unconscious world utilise it for such petty reasons and activities. Most of the World Eater’s feelings towards Earth and humans were mere notions, he felt that they were inconsequential, but there was a severity to his resentment for me in particular, and this was made clear through my suffering, though only a normal night’s sleep in the real world, it seemed for all intents and purposes to me to last for countless aeons. 



There is almost relief now, as I lie awake writing this, slipping inevitably towards sleep, that this will be the final time. I know. Somehow I know. After I fall to the World Eater’s domain this time, I will never wake. I have managed to rise to drink as much coffee as I can stomach, I have blasted music in my ears, I have bitten the insides of my cheeks so hard I taste my metallic blood with every swallow. I can stave off sleep for no longer.  I can hope only that death will eventually claim me, and save me from the eternal nightmare. 



That is, if even death himself can supersede his grasp.
