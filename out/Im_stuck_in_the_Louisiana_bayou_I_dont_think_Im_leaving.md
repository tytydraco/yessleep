I hadn’t been back to my grandmother’s house since I was a teenager. I didn’t realize how long it had been until my mom mentioned it over the phone. Back then, she still made me go with her, long drives and long nights in a house that always felt like it was swallowed by the swamp. Somewhere along the way, the visits just stopped. Life got in the way. My mom called me on a Tuesday evening.


“She’s still living out there by herself,” she said. “And she isn’t doing like she used to.”


Grandma had been widowed for ten years. Grandpa passed quietly in his sleep, and she never left that house after. Neighbors came by to check on her, bring groceries, help with chores. But she wouldn’t move. “The land won’t let me,” she told my mom once, and I never really understood what she meant.


“She’s been asking about you,” my mom said. “You should go see her.” So I did.

The drive from New Orleans took longer than I remembered. Streetlights got fewer and fewer until they disappeared. The paved roads turned into dirt roads that got narrower the farther I went. The swamp felt like it was pressing close on both sides. Spanish moss hung from the trees, heavy and still. Water puddled in the low spots. The smell of mud and wet plants stuck to the air and my clothes.


I had to park my car about half a mile from her house. The road past that point had turned into mud so soft it would have swallowed my car. I grabbed my bag and started walking. My shoes sank a little with each step, and the wet smell of the swamp stayed in my nose.


Her house was at the edge of the water, lifted on cinder blocks so it looked like it was floating above the swamp. A narrow wooden dock stretched out from the porch into the dark water. I could hear it creak under the wind. The house itself looked smaller than I remembered, like it had been settling into the swamp for decades. She opened the door herself.


She was thinner than I remembered and bent in ways that made me worry, but her eyes were still sharp. She leaned on the doorframe and reached for me. She stood long enough to hug me, her hands gripping my shirt like she needed to make sure I was real.


“Lord, child, you done let the years slip by.” she said, her tone in that classic grandma nag. “I didn’t forget,” I told her. She laughed softly. “Mm. That’s what they all say.”

Inside, the house smelled like old wood and dried herbs, with something sharp underneath it all. The curtains were drawn even though it was still daylight. I noticed little things without really thinking about them. White lines near the doorframe, a small cloth bundle pinned high on the wall where only the eyes could reach it.


I didn’t ask about them. Something told me not to.


That night, after the neighbors had gone and the swamp swallowed the sun, the night sounds came alive. Frogs called across the water. Insects buzzed thick in the air. Somewhere deep in the distance, an alligator bellowed, long and low, the sound rolling through the ground like it was alive under my feet.

Grandma sat in her chair, listening. “They stirred up tonight,” she said. “It’s just noise,” I said. “Same as always.” She looked at me for a long moment. “Baby,” she said, “you ain’t been here long enough to know what always sound like.” I laughed lightly. I thought she was just teasing me like she used to.


I’m not laughing about it now.
 

That night, I couldn’t sleep. The heat from the day hadn’t left, and the air was thick with cicadas screaming so loud it felt like it was shaking the walls. Somewhere in the swamp, water splashed against something, maybe a branch, maybe a fish. I kept turning over in bed, listening, but the sounds only made it worse.


I got up to grab a glass of water, hoping it would settle me. The hallway was dark, the floorboards creaking under my weight. I stepped out onto the porch, the night thick around me. The deck smelled like wet wood and moss, the swamp smelling sharper than it had during the day. I leaned against the railing and tried to breathe. That’s when I saw it. A little glint of light, far out in the water, reflecting the moon. I squinted. It was down there at the bottom, just barely visible through the dark water. I leaned closer, curiosity winning over caution. It looked like some kind of pendant, maybe old and made of brass or silver, tangled in weeds.


I reached for it, and then I froze. A low bellow rolled out from the water, deep and menacing. My heart jumped. I whipped my head toward the sound. From the far edge of the swamp, something massive moved through the dark water. A bull gator, thick and huge, pushed itself into the shallow part near the deck. Its head broke the surface, glinting eyes catching the moonlight. The water rippled as it moved, slow and deliberate, like it knew I was there.


I tried to step back, planning to get away from the edge, but one of the deck planks groaned and gave out under me. I fell through.
Water hit me fast and cold, I was never a good swimmer. I kept thinking about that gator, just below me somewhere, waiting.
Somehow I was able to grab the deck and pull myself up. I looked down at the hole where the plank had broken. The bull gator slid past slowly, scales glinting under the moon, just where I had fallen. My hands shook and my was heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst.


I went back inside, dripping and shivering. Grandma was in the kitchen, calling out my name. “You all right, baby?” she said. Her voice was calm, but her eyes were sharp when she saw me. “I… yeah. I’m fine,” I said, dripping water onto the floor. She shook her head, a little smile on her lips. “Those planks were going to give out some day anyway. It’s all right. Go get yourself changed.” I did as she said, but I didn’t sleep much after that. 

Every sound from the swamp kept me awake, the cicadas, the water, something moving just beyond sight. I kept thinking about that pendant at the bottom and the bull gator, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had only just begun to notice how alive the swamp really was.


The next morning, Grandma sent me into town. She gave me a short list written in shaky handwriting. Milk, bread, her blood pressure medicine, and the kind of coffee she liked even though the doctor told her not to drink it anymore. The town was small, just a single grocery store, a gas station, and a few buildings that looked like they had been there longer than anyone alive.


The drive was quiet. Trees crowded the road on both sides, and the swamp followed me most of the way, water flashing between trunks. I felt better being away from the house, like I could finally breathe again. The city had taught me to trust noise. Silence always made me uneasy.


The grocery store was cool inside, the air smelling like old fruit and cleaner. There were only a few people shopping, all of them quiet, moving slow. I grabbed what was on Grandma’s list and headed to the counter.
That’s when I noticed the clerk’s necklace.
It was small, hanging on a thin chain, but I knew it right away. The shape was the same as the pendant I had seen in the swamp. Same curves, same strange markings carved into it. My stomach dropped.
“Hey,” I said, trying to sound casual. “That necklace. Where’d you get it?”


The clerk stopped moving. He didn’t look up at first. Then his eyes lifted and locked onto mine. They were flat. Empty. Like he was looking through me instead of at me.
For a second, I thought maybe he hadn’t heard me. I opened my mouth to repeat myself, but before I could, he rang up my items and said my total. His voice was normal. Calm. Like nothing had happened.
I paid and took my bags, my hands sweating. As I turned to leave, I felt it. That crawling feeling on the back of my neck. Like someone was watching me. I glanced back over my shoulder. The clerk was still staring at me.
I pushed the door open and stepped outside, the heat hitting me hard. Even then, I didn’t feel alone. I walked to my car with that same feeling following me.


That night is when things really started to feel wrong. The sun went down, bleeding through the trees before the swamp swallowed it whole. Grandma went to bed early. She always did. I could hear her radio murmuring through the thin walls, gospel low enough to feel more like a hum than music.
Outside, the cicadas had been loud all evening. Screaming like they were trying to tear the night open. I sat on the edge of the bed scrolling on my phone, trying to ignore how tight my chest felt.


Then, all at once, the noise stopped.
Not faded. Not slowed down. Just gone.
I froze. I grew up in Louisiana. I knew the swamp never went quiet unless something was very wrong. Even the city had its sounds at night. Sirens, cars, people. Silence like that felt heavy, like pressure on my ears. I got up and went to the kitchen for a glass of water. My hands were shaking, and I told myself it was just nerves. Long day. Not enough sleep. That’s what city life teaches you to say when things don’t make sense.


I stepped out onto the deck for air. The moon was high, shining down on the water. The swamp looked flat and still, like black glass. No frogs. No insects. Nothing moving.
That’s when I heard the whispering.
It wasn’t loud. It sounded like voices carried underwater. Soft and layered, like a crowd speaking all at once but too far away to understand. My skin prickled. I turned around.


They were standing at the edge of the yard, where the grass gave way to mud. At least five of them. Maybe more. They wore old clothes, the kind you see in history books. Long coats, dresses hanging loose and heavy with wet. Everything about them was dark and soaked, like they had climbed straight out of the swamp.


Their heads weren’t human. Each one wore the rotted head of a gator, skin peeling, teeth showing through torn flesh. Mud dripped from their jaws. Around their necks, every single one of them wore the same pendant I had seen in the water. The same one the clerk had worn. It caught the moonlight and gleamed. They didn’t move. They didn’t speak.
Then, all at once, they raised their arms and pointed at me. That’s the last thing I remember.


I woke up in my bed like nothing had happened. Morning light was coming through the thin curtains, pale and gray. For a second, I thought maybe I was back home in the city. Then I heard the swamp. Water shifting. A bird calling far off. The house creaking the way it always did.


My clothes were dry. My body felt sore, like I had slept wrong, but there was no mud, no water, no sign I had ever been outside.
Grandma was already up. I could hear her in the kitchen, moving slow, dishes clinking together. When I came out, she was standing at the sink, leaning heavy on the counter.
“You up now,” she said without turning around. “Good. These joints ain’t what they used to be.” I took her place and started washing. The water was cold. Everything was too normal. I kept replaying the night in my head, every detail sharp like it had just happened.


“I had a dream,” I said finally. She hummed, like she already knew. “A bad one,” I added. “Real bad. Felt… real.” She didn’t answer right away. I scrubbed a plate harder than I needed to. I told her about the silence. About the people. I didn’t say gator heads at first, but the words came out anyway. I told her how they pointed at me. How I woke up shaking.
She set a dish towel down slow and looked at me. Her eyes were cloudy with age, but sharp underneath.


“Dreams don’t always mean something.” she said. I laughed a little, tried to shake it off. “I know. Just saying it felt different. Like it wasn’t just in my head.” She was quiet for a long moment. Outside, something splashed in the water. “Spirits got a way of speaking when they want to,” she said softly. “They don’t always use words.”


I looked at her then. “You saying that wasn’t a dream?” She shook her head, just a little. “I’m saying some things don’t come for you until you step back where you belong to.” I waited for her to say more, but she didn’t. She picked up her coffee and rolled herself toward the table, leaving the rest hanging in the air.
I stood there with my hands in the sink, watching the water, wishing she’d just say it plain. But Grandma never did things that way. And somehow, that scared me more than if she had.


I didn’t sleep much that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt like something was standing just outside the house, waiting. Grandma’s radio was off, which made it worse. I laid there listening to the water lap against the dock and the house creak, telling myself I was being stupid.


Sometime after midnight I got up. I didn’t have a plan. I just knew Grandma knew more than she was saying. The way she talked that morning, the way she cut herself off. It sat in my chest like a stone. Her room was dark, the door cracked open. I could hear her breathing, slow and steady. I stayed quiet and went into the small sitting room instead. She kept most of her things there. Old drawers. Stacked boxes. Nothing locked.


I started with the dresser. Old letters, folded so many times the paper was soft. Church programs. Receipts. Normal stuff. Then I found the photo album. It was heavy, thick leather cover, worn smooth from hands. When I opened it, the first pages were what I expected. Black and white photos of family members smiling stiffly at the camera. Sunday clothes. Front porches. Names written in faded ink underneath.

I turned the page. The clothes changed. Older now. Dresses longer. Men in suspenders. The dates written in the margins said early 1900s. My last name was still there. Same blood. Same family.That’s when I saw it.


The pendant.


One woman wore it around her neck, clear as day. On the next page, a man had it tucked into his shirt. Then another. And another. Every few pages, that same symbol showed up again, always close to the skin. My hands were shaking by the time I reached the back of the album. Tucked into the last pages were newspaper clippings. Yellowed. Brittle. Headlines about men found dead, names matching the ones in the photos. I didn’t read too close. I didn’t need to. I knew what they were talking about. My stomach turned.
“What you doing in my things?” I nearly dropped the album. Grandma was sitting up in bed, her robe hanging loose, her eyes sharp despite the hour. “You know something,” I said, my voice coming out rough. “You’ve known something this whole time.” She looked at the album in my hands, then back at my face. Her mouth pressed into a thin line.
“Put that down,” she said. “No,” I said. “Not this time. You need to tell me what this is. What’s been happening to me.”


The room felt smaller then, like the walls were leaning in. Grandma stared at me for a long moment, fear flickering across her face before she hid it. Somewhere outside, the swamp shifted, slow and heavy. Grandma sat down hard in her chair like the truth weighed more than her bones. She didn’t look at me at first. She just stared at the floor, hands folded tight in her lap.


“This was a long time ago,” she said. “Back when the law didn’t see us as nothing worth protecting.” I didn’t interrupt her. She continued.“Our family lost three men and a lil boy,” she went on. “Taken right out the parish. Left hanging like warnings.” Her voice stayed steady, but her fingers shook. “It broke us. Folks were scared to leave the house. Scared to speak too loud. Scared to breathe wrong.”
She swallowed.


“One of the women back then, my grandmother, she couldn’t live like that no more. So she went into the swamp. Went where nobody else would. She prayed, but not to God alone. She asked anything that would listen to keep our blood safe.” My mouth felt dry. “And something answered,” Grandma said.


She finally looked at me then. “It promised protection. Said no more ropes, no more mobs, no more men taken before their time. But nothing comes free. That spirit wanted its due.” I asked it before I could stop myself. “What kind of due?” I said, still confused. “A hundred years,” she said. “That’s how long it would guard us. After that, the bargain was done. Whatever hunger it had would be loose again.” The room felt cold. I thought about the dates in the album. About the way the figures had pointed at me.


“The people I saw,” I said quietly. “That was them?” She nodded. “Your ancestors. They stayed close to the water after death. Watching. Waiting. Trying to warn you.” My chest tightened. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
“I wanted to see you,” she said. “Wanted to have you here, safe, before the time was up. I didn’t know it would come so soon.”


Her voice cracked, just a little. “I thought maybe the spirit would pass us by. Maybe it already took enough.” Outside, something moved in the swamp, slow and heavy. Grandma reached for my hand, her grip weak but urgent. “You need to understand,” she said. “The protection is gone now. And it knows your name.” Grandma squeezed my hand hard, harder than I thought she could.


“You need to go,” she said. “Right now.”
“What?” I said. “No. I’m not leaving you here.”
Her eyes flashed at me. “That thing is awake,” she snapped. “And it’s hungry. My time already done. I lived long. You ain’t.” I went to her chair, tried to push it back. “I can get you in the car. We can-” She interrupted me. “Boy,” she yelled, loud enough to make me flinch, “get the hell out of my house.”
I froze. I had never heard her raise her voice like that. Not once in my life.


“It wants the blood still walking,” she said, breath shaking now. “Not the ones already half gone. If you stay, it’ll take you. If you don’t, maybe it won’t follow far.”
The house creaked. Something heavy shifted outside, close enough that I felt it more than heard it. “Go,” she said again. Softer this time. “Run.” I grabbed my keys and didn’t even think about shoes. I burst out onto the deck in my pajamas, the boards slick under my feet. The swamp was loud again, too loud, like it was breathing all around me. I ran. I’m not a runner. Never have been. My lungs burned, my legs shook, but I didn’t stop.


I made it to my car, hands slipping as I yanked the door open. It started on the first try. I didn’t look back. I drove too fast down the narrow road, trees whipping past. Then something jumped out in front of me. A deer. Big. Close. I swerved. The car slammed into a tree so hard my head rang. The engine is dead and smoking now.


I've locked the doors. My hands are shaking like crazy. Now I’m sitting here and typing this while I still can. I don’t know exactly where I am. Somewhere outside New Orleans, deep in the bayou. My battery is low. I’ve got barely any service. I can hear it out there. A deep bellow rolling through the water.


It’s getting closer.
