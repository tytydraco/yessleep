I've always been a creature of habbit. Wake up at 5 AM, protein shake, code until lunch, then hit the gym before driving home to finish my workday. Two months ago, I splurged on my dream car—a midnight blue 1967 Mustang Fastback I'd been saving up for since landing my programming job at this tech startup that honestly pays way too much for what I actually do lol.

There's something about classic cars that modern vehicles just can't match. The weight of the steering wheel, the rumble of the engine, even the smell of the leather seats. Fuck those new Teslas man, give me that American muscle any day. But what I didn't expect was what I'd start seeing in the rearview mirror.

It began three weeks ago during my drive home from the gym. Hair still damp from the shower, muscles pleasantly sore from my workout (hit a new PR on deadlifts btw). I adjusted the rearview mirror and caught a glimpse of something odd—a woman sitting in my back seat.

I nearly swerved off the road before realizing it had to be a trick of the light. When I looked again, the back seat was empty. Just my gym bag and a water bottle. I laughed it off, blaming it on exhaustion from my new workout routine. Or maybe that pre-workout was stronger than I thought.

The next evening, I saw her again. This time, I could make out more details—long dark hair, pale skin, and these intense eyes that seemed fixed on mine in the mirror. Total 10/10 if she wasn't, you know, a freaking ghost or whatever. When I whipped around to look at the empty back seat, she was gone. But in the rearview mirror, there she was, staring back at me.

What disturbed me most was her midsection. Her shirt was slightly raised, exposing her stomach. And her navel... it didn't look right. It seemed too deep, too dark, like a hole rather than a natural indentaion. I've always noticed belly buttons (yeah I know that's weird but whatever, we all have our things), but this was just wrong.

By the third night, I was prepared. I set up my phone to record the back seat while I drove. Twenty minutes into my commute, I felt a cold sensasion on the back of my neck. In the mirror, she was leaning forward, her face closer to mine, her hand resting on her exposed belly button.

When I checked the recording later that night, the back seat was empty the entire time. No woman. Nothing.

I'm a programmer. I deal with logic. Cause and effect. This defied all rational explanation. I began taking different routes home, thinking maybe the road had something to do with it. I tried driving during daylight. I even had my buddy Jake come with me once, but he saw nothing in the mirror while I could see her clear as day, now sitting directly behind him, smiling at me over his shoulder.

Yesterday, things escalated. As I was driving, I felt something cold touch my shoulder. In the mirror, her arm was reaching forward from the back seat. I watched, paralyzed, as her hand moved down to my stomach, her finger circling around my navel through my shirt. Not gonna lie, in any other context this might've been hot, but I was freaking terrified.

I couldn't feel it physically, but in the mirror, it was happening. When her finger pressed into my belly button in the reflection, I felt a sharp pain in my actual stomach.

I pulled over immediately, hands shaking. When I lifted my shirt to check, I discovered the small freckle beside my navel—the one I've had since childhood—was gone.

Last night, I parked the Mustang in my garage and covered the mirrors with towels. I told myself I would sell the car in the morning. But at 3 AM, I woke to the sound of an engine idling. My bedroom window overlooks the garage, and I could see the headlights were on.

I know I didn't leave them on. I know I took the keys upstairs with me.

I'm typing this now from my bedroom. The car's headlights are still glowing through the garage windows. Every reflective surface in my house is covered—mirrors, TV screens, even the glass in picture frames.

But I can't stop thinking about what I saw in the reflection of my phone screen just before I covered it: my own face, but my eyes didn't match my movements. And my hand... it was lifting my shirt, exposing my navel, which looked deeper and darker than it should be.

Something's wrong with my reflection. Something's wrong with me. The woman from the back seat—I can feel her underneath my skin now, centered around my navel. And when I press on my belly button, it feels... deeper than before.

I have to go check on the car. But first, does anyone know—are belly buttons supposed to pulse like this? And why does mine feel like something inside is pushing back against my finger?
