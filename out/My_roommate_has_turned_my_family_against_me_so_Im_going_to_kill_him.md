It’s been a day. Maybe two? I’m not sure anymore. As soon as I’d finished writing my last bit, I’d grabbed the laptop, thrown all my stuff in the car, and got as far as I could, as fast as I could. Some of ya’ll have said I shouldn’t fear Mike, my weird roommate.

But you weren’t there, trapped in my bedroom as he made his demands through the door. You didn’t see him destroy my closest relationship in a few choice words. He’s a monster, and he’s trying to destroy me. After the events of today, I’ve decided I’m going to kill him first.

I’m staying at some crappy motel about an hour and a half north, right up near the Oklahoma border. I’m still not sure why I went north. My parents have a house about a half hour east, though I promised myself I’d never go back to them. That I’d stay away from this area as long as I lived. But, with Jen having cut me off completely, I guess my parents’ was the only place I had left to go.

The conversation with Dick had gone smoothly, or so I’d thought. I called him that first night, when I stopped.

“Hey, Dick.”

“Hey there sport, better not be calling out sick for tomorrow, it’s looking like we might have a no-show.”

“Look, man, I’m real sorry, but I’m dealing with some, uh, heavy personal stuff at the moment, y’know?”

Dick’s voice returned after a distant grumbling. “Well champ, that ain’t exactly being a team player, is it? It’s about trust. If I can’t trust yo-“

I cut him off, “Look, Dick,” my mind raced looking for an excuse. “I don’t want to do this, but it’s my roommate. He’s deep into some serious shit, a drug dealer or something. He’s tried to kill me. I already called the cops, but I need to lie low for a few days.”

I paused as I cast my mind about. “You say it’s about trust? Well, I trust you Dick. You can’t tell anyone where I am, or that I called you. Just give me a few days and keep quiet and I’ll have all this sorted, I swear, man.”

Silence, for nearly a minute.

“Well god damn, sport.” There was surprise in his voice, but no doubt, at least through the phone. “Look man, I knew you had a rough past when I hired you.”

“I know man, but I’m out of that life, I haven’t done anything wrong. This new roommate has brought it all back down on me. All I want is to work hard, be successful, like you, Dick.” The lie came with sickening ease.

There was a supportive edge to Dick’s voice, almost a pride. “You’ve come a long way. I dare say you’re about the best assistant manager I’ve had. You deal with your thing; I’ll keep shit locked down here.”

I sighed in relief, some shred of pressure finally letting me go. At least I’d have a job to go back to when I sorted out this nightmare.

“Thanks Dick, that really means a lot man, I won’t let you down.”

“Anytime, son,” he said, “and thanks for choosing Whataburger.”

And that was the end of that.

By this point it was nearly 10 at night. Luckily, there was a crummy diner still open, just a few minutes’ walk down from the motel. The land was flat and barren under the black shroud of the night, inter-spaced with the sickly amber glow of humming streetlights.

Nothing accompanied me on the walk. Cars passed occasionally, heading through on to places brighter and less lonely, no doubt. A wind howled across the scrub-land, and approaching the diner, I turned my head out the wind, and saw that opposite was a little church.

A humble place, just a brick building with a peaked roof and a big white cross on the side, lit by some floor lights. It stuck out to me though, as I ducked into the empty diner and settled in a booth with peeling red vinyl on the seats, resting my hands on the sticky table top.

As I ordered there was nowhere to look but that church, standing by its lonesome on the wrong side of a nowhere highway in an arid and unwelcoming part of the world. I’ve never believed. Not really. My parents do, of course, but I was always more influenced by Jen. Her aloofness just made the whole concept seem so… childish. Who needs stories and belief when you can just be sensible and life will work out?

When I was younger, I’ll admit, I wasn’t sensible. I made dumb mistakes to impress a girl, and I lost her anyway. Gained nothing but a few months in rehab and an end to my formal education.

We went to church, our family. I’ve heard the sermons, sat through Exodus and the Psalms. When I was a kid, looking over to my big sis, arms folded and smirk on her face, it was reassuring. It made the good book seem like nothing but a scary story to get little boys and girls to obey their parents and their preachers.

Now I wonder. All that stupidity I did, those regrets I have, that secret.

The chicken tenders arrived lukewarm and under-seasoned, dry as the arid wastes around the diner.

I choked them down with the diet coke, as I choked down my fears with cold reason.

If there is someone up, there, judging me, then that’s his business, and it’s for later. Maybe not much later.

I couldn’t help but look back across to the church.

And there he was. Still as the grave¸ standing at the bottom of the cross like Longinus himself.

My roommate. He was watching me, and it almost made me itch. The Honda was parked at the motel, basically next door, just a few seconds’ sprint. It might as well have been on the moon. I dropped a few crumpled notes on the table and bolted for the door. If there had been anyone at the counter, they might as well have been invisible, so focused was my vision.

His even across the street I could feel it, how our gaze was locked. To describe his eyes as unnatural would be an understatement, like describing the fires of damnation as uncomfortably warm. He could see me, and with his seeing of the body came the seeing of the soul. I felt exposed, like a hare in an empty field with eagles above.

My legs were carrying me backwards, towards the motel, and he was just standing. Gray hoodie and cargo pants, most normal fella you’ve ever seen. Except those piercing eyes.

My calves touched something behind me, and I was free, the connection broken. I was in the parking lot of the motel, backed up against the bumper of my trusty, rusty Civic, and right then I felt I would have fallen to my knees and kissed the scuffed spot where its H badge had been stolen. But I was still panicked, hurrying. I instead dove into the driver’s seat and slammed it into drive as the 2-liter roared to life.

I flicked on the lights.

And there he was. At the end of the motel parking lot, just after the speed hump and before the main road.

He was looking my way still, eyes fixed on me.

I didn’t make eye contact; instead I focused on his mouth.

I couldn’t hear it, but I could see it.

“Confess.” He said, over and over again.

He was saying it as I dropped the parking brake.

Still he said it as I shot down the parking lot, barrelling towards him.

“Confess, he said, as I bounced high off the speed hump, momentarily losing sight of him as my headlights ramped up.

And when the front end bounced down at nearly 50 miles per hour, when I should have smashed into him and shattered his bones, he was gone.

I nearly under-steered into the church as I speed off east out of town, like a man being chased by the devil himself.

 

………

 

My parents lived in a big old ranch, and I made the trip in less than 22 minutes. It was dark, there was no-one around, and I drove with my lights off, just in case I was being followed. Parking the Civic up besides my Dad’s F-150 made it look comically small.

The whole ranch had that effect. A big, three-story house, with a wrap-around porch, the old stars and stripes hanging by the lone star of Texas. As typical as could be. It wasn’t an actual farm, hadn’t been since long before my mom and dad bought it and moved in.

I had to sit there for a while, engine off, breeze rattling through the night, hands resting on the cracked old dashboard. The lights were on, in the living room, but the curtains were drawn.

I was reflecting. Maybe he just dropped down next to the speed hump, or threw himself aside at the last second. There had to be a sensible, non-mystical answer for all this. I was still reflecting when my phone buzzed.

11:54pm. An email. From Whataburger corporate. My heart was doing its rib-beating routine, as I read through the email. I was fired, in short. Panic started to fill me as I flicked through apps, and there, in my texts, I found it.

A few messages I’d missed. Under the name, DICKhead (boss).

10:22pm: Call me, it’s urgent.

10:26pm: You lied to me champ. Call me now. URGENT

10:49pm: He’s told me everything. I’ve already called the police, told them all that crap you told me.

10:49pm: You ever show your face around here, you’re DEAD

10:49pm: 👍

10:50pm: Didn't mean to send that

That was it. That fucker had taken my apartment, my sister, and now my crappy job. He wouldn’t even let me eat bland chicken in peace. I might have gone to my dad’s house looking for help, maybe somewhere to stay, to plan. But this was it. Clearly my roommate wouldn’t stop until he’d taken everything from me.

 I was out the car and halfway to the porch when the door opened. There, silhouetted from the light behind like some deific phantom, was my overweight father, holding a shotgun.

With a pang, I recognized it. An old, wood-furniture Remington 870. My dad had picked it up for $70 not long before I was born, and I’d shot my first hog with it.

“Jen called.” His voice growled as I looked up into the light, eyes struggling to adjust.

“She said you might come. Also said I shouldn’t let you step a damn foot in this house. That I should just call the police and be done with you.” He stood still as a rock, shotgun across his chest, not quite as threatening as if he was pointing it at me. Still a very nasty thing to do in front of your own son, though.

“Yeah, not surprised. Things’ve gone to shit a little, Dad.”

He didn’t move.

“I dunno what she said. I could make excuses. Wouldn’t matter. You wouldn’t believe me.”

My dad lowered the shotgun at that, letting it dangle from one hand.

“Heck no, I wouldn’t.”

I nodded. “What’s she think I’ve done this time?”

“No idea. She was crying though. I don’t like it when you make my daughter cry.”

I shrugged, remembering which of us had made her cry more. But I let it go.

“Me neither. I wish I knew what I did.”

My old man tensed at that. “Can’t remember? You back on the smack?”

I shook my head, wounded by the statement. “No Dad, I haven’t touched that shit in years, not any drugs. Haven’t had so much as a beer in a few days.”

My father finally seemed to settle, to deflate a little, and I saw how old he looked. His beard, which I remembered as a big black bushy thing, had gone to gray, and his eyes were haggard, face lined with a hundred little wrinkles.

“She said you were sober. Told me that much, at least. Besides, I can hardly imagine you driving all this way high. What do you want? We don’t have any cash, so even ask.”

It hurt a lot.

I’d come a long way, a really long way, in the last 5 years. I’d sobered up. I had gotten a job, stuck with it, made it to my counselling, and even moved out of sister and her girlfriend’s apartment.

But my dad still just saw a heroin addict, looking for money for another hit.

My breaths came ragged and my cheeks stung, though whether with rage, or embarrassment, or anger, I had no clue. I was a vortex of pain and rawness just then.

It took me a long, lingering while to collect myself, to gather some sense of composure.

“I’m going away, Dad. Far away.” I yanked out my wallet, showed him the wad of cash in here. I’d withdrawn everything, every last dollar, from an ATM on the way out of town. It was at once an impressive stack, but also so little. About 9 thousand. My whole worth, every scrap I’d saved over the years I’d been fixing myself.

“I don’t need any money, Dad. Just wanted to make peace with myself, say goodbye to the house, to mom. That’s all.” I almost believed my own lie as I said it.

“Gonna… make a new life somewhere? Head north? Cross the border, maybe?” There was an edge to father’s voice.

“We’ll see.”

He nodded, and let me in. Whatever the bible might say on suicide, clearly he thought I was already damned.

The house hadn’t changed much. Same polished wood floors and ugly green wallpaper. My mother was sat in her old chair, there in the living room, but I didn’t approach. I stood at the bottom of the stairs.

“Mind if I go say goodbye to my old room?” I asked.

My father is a lot of things. And in a lot of ways, we couldn’t be more different. He’s a homophobe who kicked out his own daughter, a man who used his voice or his strength to get his way, thought differing opinions equated to a lack of respect. And, of course, he was deeply devout.

But in one way, we couldn’t be more alike.

My dad is a fucking idiot.

And being an idiot, he nodded, before settling down in his own chair in the living room, shotgun lying by his feet.

On the third story were the three bedrooms. Mine and Jen’s, left and right, opposite each other. I walked past, didn’t even spare them a glance. The master bedroom hadn’t had a lock in my childhood, and that clearly hadn’t changed as I let myself in. The walk-in closet was still on the right. And, with barely 4 foot of that for my mom and dad’s Sunday best, the rest was dominated by the same massive, 6’ tall safe.

The last time I’d been here, I’d been on the cusp of the biggest mistake of my life. This time, I hoped things would be different. I had come so far. I would never fall back to what I had been, that I promised myself.

The old digital keypad looked as it had, 9 years ago, when I’d left this house, thinking that would be the last time. As I went to type in the code, I realized what a long shot it was. Surely my dad would have known someone had been through his safe, would have changed the code?

1219. Jen’s birthday.

The idiot.

The safe clicked, and I swung the door open.

 There was my dad’s other pride and joy. Shotguns for birds, shotguns for hogs. AR15s, AR10s, semi-autos and lever-actions of nearly every configuration, bolt-actions from Winchester, Springfield, CZ, Tikka, Mauser, and Ruger. Some were new, others had served in wars long past. Cartridges were piled high, boxes of everything from 12 gauge to .410, from .22 Long to .50 Browning.

My father’s horde of ordinance, his shrine to his own saints, John Moses Browning and Samuel Colt. In many ways, I truly believe my father might be the most Texan man ever born. More than 40 long guns, and yet my head looked passed them all.

On the door there was a rack. And on that rack was my dad’s handguns. And among his fancy and historical pistols, between a 1911 my great-grandfather had carried in the war, and a .44 magnum of Dirty Harry fame, my hand was drawn to a single, unassuming Glock.

There were other guns just as good, if not better. A couple of H&Ks, a CZ, but either my hand was moving of its own accord, or some part of my mind has a very dark and ironic sense of humor.

I took that Glock 20, grabbed its polymer holster, a box of 10mm Speer Gold Dot ammunition, and a couple of spare mags, and quickly armed myself. Felons are not allowed to own firearms in the state of Texas, but ‘borrowing’ from family is something of a gray area.

The inner-waistband holster hid the big gun even on my skinny frame, and my rear pockets and jacket hid the mags and ammo well enough. A quick peek in the mirror, and I looked no more suspicious than I normally am to my father.

Back downstairs, I turned and looked at what was left of my family. My father, big and gray and angry. And my mother. She’d always been a small woman, in both stature and character, but now she was practically skeletal. Shrouded in a blanket the color of dirt, her eyes were sunken in her head, those big pale eyes. She looked pathetic. The last thing Jen had said, before she’d been forced out in the middle of the night, was that mom was a coward for staying, that dad would suck all the life out of her.

Jen was right, like usual, and my mom looked like more of an emaciated addict than I ever had. I wanted to pity here, but this was the woman who’d sat by as her husband had thrown out their children, driven away her side of the family, and shunned his own. She could have left. All that he was, he was never physically violent, not to his family.

But no. She’d always been weak. She was in a hell of her own making, and she could walk through the door at any time. I don’t hate her.

Worse, I feel nothing for her.

“Goodbye.” The words came without feeling, without meaning.

And I left.

 

………

 

As I was pulling the Civic back onto the road, I glanced in the rear-view mirror. My stomach dropped, but I’d half expected it. There was Mike, my good ol’ stalker roommate, standing on the porch, having an animated conversation with my father.

I turned out, and was picking up speed, as the first shots came from behind. My dad, at the edge of his fence, was shooting at me. I was already a quarter-mile gone and picking up speed fast, and whatever birdshot or buckshot he had loaded was coming nowhere near me.

Still, it’s an unsettling feeling, having your own father shooting at you. I noticed as well, Mike was nowhere to be seen, and he hadn’t come in a car or anything. I would have seen it.

Whatever the hell he is, he has a date with the gold folks of Speer Ammunition, and I wasn’t going to keep him waiting. It wasn’t like I had any else either. Everything I’d ever worked for, whoever I’d had to rely on, had all been ripped away by my oh-so-normal roommate. Thinking back, I’m sure it was Jen who picked him in the first place.

There had been others who could’ve been my roommate, lots of them. I remember more about them than Mike anyway. There was a Chinese postgrad student, liked playing League of Legends. Some European guy, must’ve been 6’7”, just kept smiling and talking about how he liked American girls. A half-Indonesian, half-Jamaican wannabe rapper, he’d seemed fun. And who could forget, some guy from Dallas who was convinced his grandfather had been the second gunman on the grassy knoll.

All this was rushing through my head as I drove nearly aimlessly. I’d taken a right out of my dad’s place. Instead of heading back towards town, I was pressing into the wide expanse of north Texas.

At Perryton, I headed south, cutting through the wide desert plains under the light of the moon and the stars. Nothing but me, the road, and my memories.

At Pampa, nearly 1am, I stopped at a Taco Bell. It was the only place still open, and they gave me a shitty look, as they were closing in about 5 minutes.

So I drove on, with my crunchwrap supreme congealing in its wrapper, and my baja blast growing warm and diluted.

East I went; seemingly taking no notice as the world passed me by outside.

I couldn’t tell you how I was feeling. There was something tranquil about that night. The road stretched on forever, and it felt like I had all the time in the world.

And yet, I knew now there would be no escape. Whatever was happening was beyond my ability to control or to understand.

Jen gets stressed, when that happens. She gets all anxious, starts biting her nails, picking at her hair. I’ve never really been like that.

As I see it, you should only care about things you can control. If it’s something bigger than you: war, politics, news, even workplace drama you ain’t the center of, why care?

Maybe that’s what made me so susceptible to drugs back in high school. It was something I could do, at that time in your life when you have no control, no autonomy, at school or at home. Drugs are a conscious decision. It’s a way of striking back at the man.

And then you’re in the grips of addiction, and your priorities get fucked. Getting high isn’t a choice; it’s the most important part of your day. School, hygiene, friends, it all comes in a very distant second behind drugs, and the harder the drugs the further back those other priorities fall.

I stopped, somewhere over the border, in Oklahoma. Some nameless patch of dirt on the roadside. I ate my crunchwrap and chugged my baja blast, and it was the best thing I’ve ever eaten.

I’ve thought about this, about what’s coming. This morning, either I’m going to die, or Mike is. It’s a good feeling, having something that final to look forward to. Every minute out here, under the moon, feels like an hour of bliss. If I don’t write anything else, know I’m dead and rotting in some nameless ditch somewhere in Oklahoma.
