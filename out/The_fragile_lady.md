It was an eerie night, the pitch darkness had shattered all over the place. Since I live in a village, it doesn't feel that abnormal, but something felt unusual today. I don't know what, but my heart was pounding; I could hear my own heart racing because of the loud silence. Even little footsteps made noise. My gut feeling told me to stay alert, because even the loud and arrogant street dogs from our town did not let out a single screech of howl.

I had just been out for a night walk. I personally enjoy the feeling of being all by myself, but today I didn't like it. And the flickering street lights that I walked past were engulfed in the darkness too. After listening to some pop songs, my mood went calm again. I sat at a bench nearby in the park (I know that I shouldn't have, this is the start of every horror movie, but don't blame my stupidity; I am just a casual guy who doesn't overthink too much).

I sat there on a nearby bench for more than half an hour. I was just going to head back home as it had started raining down heavily all of a sudden. The rain felt like sadness; the drops almost resembled tears.

As I was running back home, trying to save myself from the rain, I saw a woman down the crosswalk. She had an umbrella, so I tried to wave my hand, but she was looking at the other side, so I shouted from the distance in the politest way possible:

"HEY THERE, I KNOW THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE STRANGE TO ASK, BUT CAN YOU PLEASE DROP ME NEAR MY HOME IF YOU DON'T MIND? IT IS JUST 5‚Äì10 MINUTES AWAY."

She turned to look back at me. I don't know why, but I got a shock looking at her face. She had long black hair and a pale white face. She looked very pretty, but her eyes‚Ä¶ looking at her eyes felt like they were empty, devoid of light and shimmer. Although she looked kind, the shock I felt was unexplainable ‚Äî just my bodily reaction of some sort.

But then thinking back at my stupid decision, I realized that she might feel scared that a man is asking her to lead him home at night, especially on this creepy and uncanny night. I realized how terrified she might feel and how bad it looks, so I was just going to say: ‚ÄúActually, don't mind me. I will just walk it out in the rain.‚Äù But she gave me a smile. It was wide but restrained, radiating politeness. She said sure, plus my home is on the way to her destination. I was very glad. I thanked her as I reached under her umbrella.

We talked for a while. I explained my situation, and she was actually very understanding. As our conversation was going, I just hit a thought: since the woman was heading in the opposite direction from mine, why did she say that my home was on the way to her destination? Just as I was trying to recover from the shock I had received and pretend to be normal so that I could think about what to do next, a second thought hit me: how does she know where my home lies? This was the final blow to my calmness. A shiver crept down my spine.

I had been stunned, and as we were talking through the walk, the woman noticing that I was stunned finally realized she had moved past me. The raindrops poured on top of my body, just enough to bring me back to my senses. She asked me from a couple of steps down, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing there behind in the rain? You might catch a cold.‚Äù

I knew that I could not outrun her if she really was a supernatural entity, so I covered the distance up and continued to walk with her. Now knowing that I am probably going to die, I actually didn't hesitate much. I have always been a little bit of a Stoic believer. I knew that if death is going to come, there is no running back and that I must accept my fate. This is a natural process and it has to happen one day or another. Although I didn't know I was going to die in a way like this, my fear had actually faded along the way. A silent smile of realization hit me. I said it was a life worth living for.

The woman asked what I actually meant. I explained to her that I had already realized that she is a ghost/spirit and that I am probably living my final moments but that I have accepted my fate. The rain had stopped already. The woman was a little astonished herself hearing what I had said. But she actually gave me a smile ‚Äî not creepy in any way, but the understanding one.

She said that she is not just any kind of spirit; she only haunts bad people who have evil intentions in their mind, those who might try to take advantage of her frailness. She said in a strong and pleased voice: ‚ÄúYou are a kind soul. It reminds me of a person that I had met a few years ago.‚Äù As she said this, she handed the umbrella to me. I felt her cold and wrinkled hands (it had already stopped raining, but I just now realized it).

As I looked back to thank her, she had already vanished into thin air. I felt a sense of sadness. Even though my life has been spared, she looked like a nice and kind-hearted soul. I wondered how it turned out that she is the way she is now. But remembering what had just happened, and what would have happened if I was not the person I am now but if it was someone else‚Ä¶ I could not predict if someone else would have survived. Judging by what she said, that I resembled someone she had met years ago, clearly meaning she has not spared a soul in years, it's safe to say that the chances of my survival were very meek but never zero.

At the end, I reached my home, now feeling like an eternity had passed by, still holding the umbrella she gave me tightly in my hands as a sign of proof that my encounter with the spirit was real. It was an experience that I could never forget, but the one thing I would like to say ‚Äî which I will always remember ‚Äî is that no matter what the circumstances might be, it is always better to be calm rather than hectic. After all, everybody has their own fate, and you have to do everything to overtake/ride it rather than running away from it. :)
