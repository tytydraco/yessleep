tucked myself in, cozy with life.
I closed my eyes, but a thought crept in:
The look of her mortified face—what a grin.

As she snored softly, I tapped her shoulder,
To my dismay, she didn’t smolder.
This will ruin my prank, I thought with dread,
So I dropped the tissue box near her head.

To her fright, she woke, jolted and turned,
Her wide-eyed stare, a reaction I earned.
Her gaze met mine, my smile so wide,
A freakish grin with my eyes opened wide.

She screamed aloud, and I laughed so strong,
“You’re an asshole! My heart feels wrong!”
Her words, though shivered, filled the air,
But I exhaled my laughter without a care.

“You should’ve seen your face,” I said,
With tears of joy, my humor fed.

The next night came, the same ordeal,
She’d sleep, and I’d sit to scheme and steal.
This time I’d nudge her with my elbow slight,
And meet her gaze with my mask of fright.

It worked again—her dismay was clear,
But no scream, just silence, laced with fear.
I chuckled low, but no words came,
Her face looked different—was it the same?

I thought she missed my horrid grin,
Or grew annoyed with the prank I’d spin.
So I called it a night, let the matter fall,
And slept with ease, no care at all.

But morning came, and she wasn’t there,
Her absence pulled me from sleep’s sweet air.
I found her pacing, the phone in her hand,
Her voice shook softly, hard to withstand.

“Mom, I’m scared,” she whispered low,
“I think he’s possessed; I don’t know.”
She paced again, her tone grew weak,
“Please, I can’t—” her voice did squeak.

A click of silence; her mom had hung,
She crumbled to the floor, her body unstrung.
I stood in shock but held my tongue;
She treated me as though all was young.

That night, I swore, one last time,
A prank so bold, it felt sublime.
I’d lie in wait beneath the sheets,
And give her a fright she couldn’t beat.

To sleep we went, and I feigned my rest,
A ploy to settle her weary chest.
She’d stir to pee, as I knew she would,
And I’d reveal my face from under the hood.

Hours passed, the moment near,
Her movements came, I stifled fear.
She shifted once—my time to rise—
HORRID FACE ACTIVATE before her eyes.

But to my dread, her face met mine,
A twisted mask, grotesque design.
Her smile so wide, her lips stretched thin,
As if her face were tearing within.

I chuckled weakly, “Heh, what’s this?”
But her gaze held steady—a doll-like abyss.
“Marie?” I asked, my heart now tight,
“Marie?” she whispered in the dead of night.

Her voice was mine, yet not quite so,
My stomach knotted; my fear did grow.
“What is your name?” her question fell,
A haunting echo, cold as a bell.

My throat grew dry, my words came slow,
“What are you playing at?” my voice did low.
Her smile stayed, her lips unmoved,
As if her face no longer approved.

“So you’re the husband,” she softly spoke,
“Shame—I thought you were…” she broke.
Her laugh then came, a low, cruel groan,
A sound that rumbled from marrow and bone.

I panicked, fell from the bed’s embrace,
And looked again at her borrowed face.
Her gaze locked mine, her eyes held hate,
A rigid mask, my love replaced.

I ran, though legs felt made of stone,
She grabbed my ankle, a grip unknown.
I kicked her off, and I broke away,
But her presence lingers to this day.

It’s not safe, but suffice to say:
My prank turned on me, and now I pay.
