I recently moved into my grandparents’ house. It’s a long story, but to sum it up, they moved into an assisted-living community after my grandpa’s dementia got worse and my grandma could no longer take care of him due to her health. Their move coincided with a horrible breakup with my boyfriend, who proceeded to kick me out of our apartment when he decided he wanted to date my best friend instead. She decided dating him was better than our friendship. With no other options and the generosity of my parents managing my grandparents’ affairs, I moved from Portland to backwoods Northern California where I could work my stable nine-to-five job remotely.

I keep a strict sleep schedule. It helps me focus on work even if I stare at a computer all day. I shower, brush my teeth, apply my night-time skincare products, brush my hair, put on my PJs, spend fifteen minutes reading a romance novel, and then do five minutes of breathing exercises before I put on my sleep mask and go to bed. It takes about five minutes for me to fall asleep, and I sleep soundly breathing through my nose for exactly eight hours before my alarm wakes me up. It made me kind of a homebody and a buzzkill in my friend group in Portland, but I never minded. I’m the kind of person who can shut off a movie ten minutes before the conclusion and not think about it until I feel like watching the ending again. I compartmentalize.

I hoped the move would help me compartmentalize my breakup. It didn’t throw off my sleep schedule. I continued to get my eight hours the day I arrived, even with virtually nothing unpacked. New place, new bed, didn’t matter. It helped that the place was move-in ready, and I had visited my grandparents there as a kid with my parents and brother.

The house was nice. Surrounded by pine tree forests, it was in a small logging town. My grandpa had been a carpenter who never truly retired, and so almost everything in the house was done by him. All original cabinets, comfortable homemade furniture, and an aesthetic perfected by the log cabin exterior and my grandma’s homey sensibilities made it comfortable and nostalgic. The place even smelled like pine and my grandma’s tea. The moment of walking through the door hit me with a wave of comfort.

On the two-week anniversary of my arrival, I woke up without my alarm. Lifting my sleep mask, I looked over to my clock to see something I hadn’t seen in years: 6:59 am in bold digital orange lines. Hearing the beep start as the clock changed to 7:00 am was surreal, and I reflexively reached out and shut it off.

The rest of my morning felt slightly off. My orange juice seemed sourer, and my eyes kept drifting away from my computer to the forest outside. Maybe it was the flood of childhood memories this place brought back or the fact that my grandparents no longer lived here that disturbed me. But I did what I did best. I compartmentalized it, put it behind me, and focused on my work for the afternoon.

I fell asleep that night with ease, again setting myself up for success with a perfectly executed nightly routine. My romance novel was extra cozy. The stress of the move melted away as I drifted off.

Imagine my frustration upon waking up in silence to remove my sleep mask and see 6:59 again taunting me. Twice in a row. I didn’t know what to think, so I tweaked my nightly routine. I started earlier, read for five minutes longer, and did more breathing exercises. It was what I had done in the past when I had weird dreams or got woke up by noisy neighbors in my old apartment.

All the effort didn’t pay off. 6:59 greeted me again as I ground my teeth in the morning silence. Frustrated and determined to not let this affect me too much, I went to my desk and began the day early. By 10:30, I was struggling to stay awake. Thankfully, my 10:45 meeting was cancelled, and I could visit the local coffee shop to get some caffeine. Getting my bearings in the local community also seemed like it could help.

Driving around the one-stoplight town flooded me with memories of when I was a kid. My family used to live in San Francisco, and we would come visit my grandparents up north for little getaways. There was the dollar store where my grandma would get me and my brother a box of candy and a bag of popcorn for a movie night. Next to it, the bakery with fresh rolls my grandpa picked up every Saturday. Across the street, the fire and police station, well equipped for wildfires and search and rescue. They had torn down the old school next to them and built a new one, but the playground still had the same swings my brother and I sat on as kids.

What had once been the diner was now a nice little coffee shop with a few brunch options. It was funny to see the Wi-Fi password tacked on the old corkboard over the classic linoleum countertop, which now had a rough wood visage covering its previous ugly yellow particleboard façade.

There was a handsome lumberjack behind the register who greeted me with a smile.

“New to town or just passing through?” he said, as he made my latte.

“Just moved here. I’m in my grandparents’ house now that they’ve moved to a retirement home.”

“Who are your grandparents? Bet I know them.”

“Grant and Luella Kopetsky.”

“They moved? That’s sad. I’ll miss them. They used to be regulars before Grant’s health got worse.”

“Really? Wouldn’t have expected them to frequent this place if it didn’t still have pecan pie.”

“Oh we do – my dad used to own the diner before he retired to the coast. I just gave it a facelift.”

“Well I like what you’ve done with the place. Feels a lot homier.” I gestured to the antique and mismatched wooden chairs, as well as the exposed wood beams on the ceiling.

“Thanks,” he said, handing me my latte. “I’m Chris, by the way.”

“I’m Abby,” I said, heart fluttering a little as I met his eyes, then falling into my stomach as I accepted my latte and saw the ring on his finger.

“Let me know if you need anything since your move. Always love to be a good neighbor. My wife and I live a couple miles down the road.” Chris said, smiling.

I turned to go. “Will do.”

“Watch out for Timber Walkers!” he said with a grin.

“What?”

“Timber walkers! Our local cryptid. Like Bigfoot.” He held up a crochet plush toy about eight inches in diameter that had been sitting in front of the cash register. It was midnight black with six appendages, big white button eyes, and no visible mouth.

“Yeah, ok, thanks, you too!” I said, awkwardly. I turned and walked out the diner door into the eleven o’clock sun, shaking off the silliness of cryptids and drove home.

The rest of the workday was productive enough. I had finished my tasks by 4:30 with the caffeine boost and just decided to shut down my laptop and call it for the day. I sat at my desk and gazed out the window into the sunlit evergreen forest across a small patch of grass. The birds were chirping. Light streamed through cracks in the canopy to color the pine needles on the dusty forest floor dusty green and bright orange. It was beautifully still.

I spotted a glint past some overgrown branches that had overtaken a crude path. It was the tin roof of the treehouse. My grandfather had built it for me and my brother when we were young. I was seven, my brother was five. My brother and I had loved it. I still remember the first time he surprised us with it.

Our grandpa had made us stay inside the morning after we arrived, which was strange because the sun was shining and the breeze was perfect. His eyes were full of life when he came inside around eleven and told us to follow him.

We walked out into the treeline and up the incline into the forest. Watching our step on the needle-covered ground, my grandpa helped us around roots and brush. There, attached to a large pine tree at the top of the hill, and sitting on two stilts five feet off the ground, was a treehouse, ten-foot square, with a short roof. It had a single gable tin roof. A ladder on one side led up to the door. The freshly treated siding had a light brown hue. One open square window sat in the center of each wall with flap to close over them. Leo and I both expressed our excitement and wonder as we ran our way to the ladder.

Grandpa hoisted us up, then stood watching as we admired his work. The inside had similarly furnished wood walls and a short homemade table and chairs, perfect for a five- and seven-year-old.

“Wow, this is so cool!” Leo said.

“I’ve got two more things for each of you.” Grandpa said. From his front overall pocket, he pulled out two small pocketknives with blades slightly larger than a box cutter and two small green leatherback books. He held out the knives to us, but before placing them in our hands, his face got very stern. “Now Abby, Leo…these pocketknives are tools. But I warn you, never carelessly swing them around, never throw them, never try to kill any animals with them. And never, never, never point them at one another. Ok?”

“Yes grandpa,” we said solemnly in unison.

“You can whittle with them, you can carve with them, but you must be careful with them. Ok?”

“Yes grandpa,” our tone the same as before.

He placed the knives in our hands. We carefully admired them, heeding his warning. He picked up the books. “And these are for you to read.”

I turned mine over, feeling the smooth leather against my fingers and the oil smell that still makes me think of my grandpa. In yellow lettering the front cover read:

“My first survival guide,” read Leo, out loud.

“There’s a lot of fun things you can learn about with these. I even learned a thing or two.” My grandpa smiled in a way that just made me love him. We both gave him a hug from our elevated standing.

“Now a couple rules for the treehouse. Don’t try and climb on the roof or out the windows, I don’t want you to fall on your head. And you can only be in there when the sun is in the sky, just so that you don’t get lost wandering back in the dark. Got it?”

“But I’m not afraid of the dark, grandpa,” said Leo.

“I know Leo, but I want you to be safe, ok?” said Grandpa.

“Ok.” Leo was already reading his book and turning his closed pocketknife over and over in his hand.

“Now I’m going to go take a nap while Grandma fixes lunch, so you two have fun, and I’ll call you back inside.” Grandpa walked down the hill and left us to our imaginations.

The next hour stretched out like a joyful infinity, as my brother and I discovered and conquered our new domain. Real and imaginary creatures alike roamed the woods as we explored. After a while, we retreated to the treehouse, where we made imaginary feasts of pine needles and cones. Tired out from sheer enjoyment, we laid on the floor of the treehouse.

“I wish I could stay in the treehouse forever,” said Leo.

“I do too,” I replied.

Grandpa hollered into the woods that lunch was ready. I got up and made my way down the ladder with my knife and book. Leo stayed laying on the floor.

“Are you coming, silly?” I said.

“Do we have to go?” he whined.

“I think grandma made mac and cheese with hotdogs!”

“Yay!” Leo cheered, then sprung up, bolted down the ladder, and ran through the woods, book and knife (thankfully closed) in hand.

The breeze picked up as the aromas of pine swallowed me. I followed him down the hill.

Leo was gone now. I didn’t want to think about him anymore.

In the evening, I finished my romance novel early, but didn’t feel like getting out of bed to find another. In the darkness of the room, my mind began to wander. I thought about Chris. Maybe his wife was nice. Maybe I’d have a friend if he introduced me. Slipping deeper into sleep, my thoughts shifted to the woods. Timber walkers. Weird. That plushie though. Why’d he bring that up?

I breathed deeply, compartmentalizing, and went to sleep.

I awoke to silence and early morning glow again. 6:59. With a frustrated grunt, I preemptively switched off my alarm. The stress of the previous day must have manifested while sleeping because my face was tight and my jaw hurt. Steeling my mind, I decided I wouldn’t let it affect me today. No matter my sleep schedule, I couldn’t let one minute of sleep throw me off.

Closing the blinds, I removed the distracting memories of the treehouse and got to work. With white-knuckled strength, the day came and went. By the time my shoulders were going to explode from tension, I had to admit the weird sleep was affecting me. In deep frustration, I decided some yoga before bed was in order. I closed every window in my house, got out my mat, and listened to peaceful zen for most of the evening. With my tension released, I started a new romance novel. Dreams called to me, but one more idea flashed itself before I gave into my pillow. I flipped my alarm to 6:59. How clever of me. Minutes later, white noise and blankets swallowed me into sleep.

One stupid extra digital line greeted me when I stirred at 6:58. Frazzled, upset, and unable to get the tangles out of my hair, I elected to keep my webcam off during any meetings that day.

An angsty lust for caffeine overcame me when my 10:30 meeting got cancelled, and I jetted off to the coffee shop as soon as I could.

“You look horrible,” said Chris. “Everything ok?”

“Thanks. I haven’t been sleeping well.”

“Mm. Makes sense. New bed, new place, toss and turn to get used to it.”

“No, it started out fine. I have a very robust nighttime routine before bed. I just keep waking up one minute before my alarm goes off.”

“Weird. You tried moving it up a minute?”

“I did. It still happened.”

“Well that sucks. Don’t let it affect you too much.”

“I’m trying not to.”

“Maybe your weekend will help. Take a load off, get comfortable, spend some time outside. The weather’s supposed to be nice this weekend.”

“Whatever you say.”

That stupid little plushie was looking at me. I left a little less upset.

The weather that weekend was, in fact, not nice, as it rained for what seemed like a day straight, from sunup to sundown on Saturday and periodically on Sunday. Instead of producing the cozy vibe of childhood from the soft warmth of my grandparents house, it was dark, cold, and musty. On top of that, I slept in an hour later and woke up not only at 7:59, but also to several damp spots throughout the house, with no discernable leaks from the ceiling. I stayed in and continued to unpack. Movement in the trees drew my eyes to the windows as raindrops made the branch twitch. Even a cup of my grandma’s tea couldn’t release my stress. It’s aroma of ginger and orange brought a hollow nostalgic warmth.

Sitting in the living room and sipping my tea, my eyes were drawn out the window to the rust speckled shine of the treehouse roof. The rain combined with the sight made a memory crawl out of the mud.

I was laying on the floor of the treehouse, twisting a pine cone in my hands, feeling it scratch my palms. A little sap made my hands sticky.

Leo fidgeted while laying on the floor across from me. “Do you have any food? I want a snack.”

“I’ve got some roast squirrel. Here.” I held out a stick with pretend squirrel impaled on it.

“No, I mean a real snack.”

“Grandma’s making cookies, remember? She said she’d call us inside when she was done.”

I glanced out the window towards the house. A grey sky hung above the trees. My grandma bustled around in the kitchen.

Something was crawling on my leg. I jumped up and shrieked. “Get it off!”

“What?” said Leo.

“It’s crawling on me!”

“Hold still! Let me look!”

I stopped brushing myself off as Leo plucked a spider off my back.

“It’s just a little spider.” He let it crawl around his hand.

“How can you let that thing crawl on you?”

“He’s a friend. He likes to catch bugs.” Leo went over to the window and let the spider crawl off his hand onto the sill. “I wonder if it’s going to rain.”

He ran his fingers of one hand along the sill, then drummed them across the wall.

The same pattern drummed on the roof.

“Did you do that?” I said.

“Hmm?” Leo looked at me confused.

“The roof.”

“I can’t reach that.”

“Hmm. Maybe it’s a squirrel.”

“They’re probably mad you roasted one of them.”

We giggled. I took the pinecone to the window and stuck my hand out. “Here squirrely! We’re friends!”

“Yeah, we’re friends!” Leo stuck his hand out the window, palm outstretched. We laughed.

A pinecone fell off the roof and hit Leo in the hand. It tumbled to the ground. We laughed harder. “Maybe it is a squirrel!” he said.

Raindrops started to plink against the roof. Some of them sounded like the drumming noise Leo had made.

Then the unsteady drumbeat across the roof drowned out our thoughts. Before long, the noise was almost deafening, as thousands of tiny feet raced across the roof. I looked out the window to see the torrential downpour turning the path to the house into a mudslide. My grandma was standing at the back door, waving and calling, though the rain drowned her out.

“Grandma says to come inside.”

“Why? It’s dry here.”

“I bet the cookies are ready.”

Leo’s face lit up, and he scrambled down the ladder. He was soaked by the bottom rung. “COOOOKKIEEEES!” he yelled over the rain as he slid and skidded down the slight decline.

I ran after him, dodging tree roots and puddles, mud caking my pink sneakers. Rain sheeted off my hair as I made it out of the trees. Before I knew it, I was under the roof’s overhang. My grandma made us take off our shoes and stand outside as we waited for her to get towels. Leo gave me a toothy grin as he shivered, mop of brown hair now plastered to his head. I returned his smile, and we giggled as grandma wrapped us in towels. As we waddled inside, I turned back to look at the woods. I could have sworn something was splashing through the puddles behind me.

I shook the memory out of my mind and decided I’d go back to unpacking. A few more boxes later, the sky was dark. A box of mac and cheese later and I was down for the count. After almost dozing off during Spiderman, a rare occurrence for me, I paused the movie twenty minutes before the end and started my nightly routine. Feeling so tired from unpacking, I skipped my novel and went straight to bed.

I woke up at 7:59 again. My covers were all bunched up at the foot of the bed, and the door of my room was open. The door latch was old, and I probably didn’t latch it properly. Temperature change from the rain had already made the floors squeaky; I wasn’t surprised if the door frame was slightly warped. The sky was still grey with the added sag of the previous day’s rain. The beige ground was now deeper brown, and pine needles flowed on the banks of microrivers in the hillside.

My alarm snapped me back to reality, and I again soaked my sock in a puddle with no visible leak above it. After a breakfast of half-hearted pancakes, I went into town, only to discover that nothing except church was open on Sunday. Not even the gas station.

The rain forced me to retreat back to my grandparent’s house, and having nothing to do after finishing Spiderman, I decided to take a nap on the couch. Little rays of sunshine broke through the clouds as I drifted off, warming the small of my back through the front window.

Something banging on the door woke me up. I gasped as the reverberating thud made me flinch. I turned to look out the window and saw Chris standing on my porch. A short blonde woman stood next to him. She had a wide mouth and big blue eyes. His wife.

Blinking away sleep, I went to the door. My filter materialized as I resisted the urge to curse him.

“Hey Abby!”

“What are you doing at my house?”

“Are you ok?”

“Yeah I’m fine. I was just napping.”

“Oh sorry, we didn’t see you inside, so I kept knocking. We thought you might be in the back, so I knocked a little too loud.”

“Hmm.”

“Anyway, sorry to intrude, but we were in the neighborhood walking and we thought we’d stop by and see how moving in was going. Abby, this is my wife, Tina.”

“Nice to meet you, Tina.”

She smiled widely and shook my hand. “Nice to meet you, Abby! Welcome to the neighborhood. We should get coffee sometime.”

“Ok, sure.”

“How’s unpacking going?” asked Chris.

“I’m basically done. I didn’t have much to do since my grandparents left all their stuff here.”

“That’s great! And you work from home?” said Tina.

“Yeah.”

“I saw your desk through the window. Very ergonomic. And such a lovely view!” She should be scaring away the rainstorm with how much she was smiling.

“Is that a treehouse?” Chris said, pointing into the woods.

“Yeah my grandpa made it for me and my brother when we were kids. It’s a bit decrepid now.”

“Hopefully not infested with Timber walkers,” said Chris.

“What?” I said.

Tina shot him a dirty glance. “Chris, don’t try to scare her with stuff like that. The woods can be creepy enough when you’re by yourself.”

Chris smiled and relented. “I’m kidding, I’m kidding. They’re fictional…allegedly.”

“Chris just likes to talk about it so people buy the plushies he made.”

“Yeah I saw them.” I gave him a cold look.

“Come on, it’s just some lighthearted fun so that people have a campfire story. This town needs some character.”

Tina rolled her eyes. “If you call stories about giant spiders lighthearted fun.”

“Honey, you know they aren’t spiders. They have six legs, and they aren’t invertebrates.”

“Have you seen one?” I said.

Chris smiled slyly. “No, but I hear about them from everyone in town coming into the coffee shop. It’s like an adrenaline shot.”

“Anyone ever taken a picture of one?”

“No, they’re super elusive.” His smile grew wider. He looked like a kid explaining how many Christmas gifts he was getting. “No one’s ever been attacked by one and lived to tell about it.”

“No one’s ever been attacked! Chris, you’re going to freak her out!” Tina scolded lightly.

Chris held up his hands. “I kid, I kid. Most of the time people just see movement in the forest or something looking in their window. A couple people think the walkers have gotten in their house, but that seems farfetched to me.”

Shivers ran down my spine as I imagined some giant monster standing in my kitchen or looking in my window.

“Just lock your doors and you’ll be fine.” Chris was still smiling. “It’s just an overactive imagination in most people or older folks with failing eyesight.”

“Did my grandparents ever talk about it?” I asked.

“They were skeptics for years, but in the last couple, they’d come in for a piece of pie and mention strange stuff. Power issues, missing stuff, weird smells. Not to speak ill of them, but I just chalked it up to them getting old.”

Tina tried to rescue the tone. “They were always lovely and welcoming. We were sad to see them go. This is such a great home, and they were such fun neighbors.”

“Well thanks.”

“Were you close with them?”

“I hadn’t really been back here in ages. Not since I was a kid. Maybe 8 or 9.”

“Wow! That’s a long time.”

“Yeah we moved out of California around then. My…yeah.”

“Hmm. That’s too bad.” Tina’s large eyes widened with sadness.

“Yeah.” The wind blew in the trees.

Chris sighed. “Well, we’ll leave you to it. Have a great weekend!”

Tina turned to him. “We should have her over for dinner! You should come over for dinner!”

Chris emphatically agreed and I was taken aback. Before I knew it, I was shaking my head yes, exchanging numbers with Tina, and agreeing to have dinner with them on Tuesday. After an extended apology and goodbye, Chris and Tina walked back towards the road. A cloud went over the sun as I stood on the porch and watched them crunch down the gravel driveway. The whisper of a breeze made me flinch as I looked at the woods.

The feeling faded as the sun emerged again. I brushed the cobwebs from my mind and finished the evening with a strong enough ethic to put all the boxes in the garage. I drifted off to sleep with a lot more work done.

I awoke to silence. With my sleep mask still covering my eyes, I reached over to switch off my alarm.

A subtle rush of air over my skin was enough to give me goosebumps on my whole body. I recoiled and drew my feet to my chest. As my ears adjusted and my bed stopped squeaking, I could have sworn I heard a faint thudding down the hallway, unrhythmic, like something falling down wooden stairs.

I tore off my sleep mask and looked around the room for anything, but it was all perfectly in order. The bedroom door was open again. I crept through the house. All the locks were as they should be.

I felt on edge all day. As night approached, I was afraid to see the darkness creep through the forest. I watched the moon rise above treetops, some giant eye watching me through the window. The soft glow reflected off the rusted roof of the treehouse as the remaining orange light faded from the sky. My mind wandered to the past.

As I sat in the treehouse drawing, Leo clambered up the ladder with one hand while holding rocks in the other hand.

“Don’t fall!” I said, watching him rock back and forth as his hand jumped between rungs.

He dumped the rocks onto the floor and scrambled up the rest of the way. “I found flint!”

“What?”

“It’s from the book. You use it to start fires.” He emptied his pockets of pine needles and twigs and swept them into a hasty pile.

Leo had been reading his pocket survival guide constantly, while I had barely touched mine. He was smart for only being 6. While I struggled to figure them out in second grade, Leo was already reading maps and diagrams.

Opening his pocket knife, Leo started shaving sticks into the pile and got the rocks together.

“How’d you find them?”

“My forest friend showed me.”

“Who’s that?”

“He’s a big spider.”

“I hate spiders.”

“He’s nice.”

I figured he was just making something up. “You’re not going to actually start a fire, are you?”

“I just want to see if I can make a spark.”

“Ok. Be careful.” I scooted back.

Leo picked up a rock and struck it against the back of his knife. It didn’t spark. He did it a few more times, then picked up a different rock. On the second strike, it made a spark which caught on the dry kindling. It roared to life. In less than 10 seconds, there were flames a foot high.

“Leo! You’re going to burn down the treehouse!”

“What do I do?” He yelled.

“Put it out! We need water!”

“I don’t have any!”

“Go to the house!”

“Wait, use the table!”

He grabbed the small table and flipped it over onto the fire, then jumped on top of it, smothering it with the tabletop. After we flipped it back over and there was no visible flame, the table had a large burn mark in the center that wouldn’t go away as we wiped at it. Leo insisted on peeing on the ashes, which stunk up the place.

We both climbed down the ladder, the smell making me gag and soot blackening our faces.

“I’m sorry. I didn’t think it would start so quick.”

“It’s fire. You should be careful!”

“Please don’t tell grandpa! He won’t let me go back in the treehouse!” He looked at me with big puppy eyes.

I sighed. “Ok. I won’t.”

“You promise?”

“It can be our little secret.”

“Ok. Our little secret.” He smiled as we walked back to the house and washed our hands and faces with the hose.

The thumping noise was absent when I woke up the next morning, and I chalked it up to a drafty house and squeaky bed.

Tuesday came and went. Before I knew it, I was climbing into my sedan and navigating a gravel backroad to get to Chris and Tina’s house. Tall pine trees surrounded the road before opening into a clearing. A nice one-story ranch style with dark wood siding sat contentedly in the middle of the clearing. Flower beds adorned a gravel walking path to the front. It was quaint and cozy.

Tina and Chris both walked out to meet me, where we talked for ten minutes, before moving to the mudroom, where we talked for twenty more minutes, and by the time I sat down by their kitchen bar I felt like we were old friends. Chris made me a drink, whatever it was delicious and floral, and then as we sat down to dinner, I felt like I knew their entire life story. He was a former college football player; she had played softball. After a lot of friendly conversation, he had asked her out, and they were engaged within four months. They had a relaxed and inviting banter like they had known each other forever, something my ex’s temperament didn’t really allow for.

Following a fabulous dinner of pasta and wine, we sat in the living room decorated with animal furs, antlers, and handmade furniture. I was feeling at ease, probably from the alcohol. One of those plushies was sitting on the coffee table. I picked it up.

“How long have you been making dolls?” I said to Chris.

He settled on the couch next to Tina. “They are not dolls.”

“Looks like a doll.”

“It’s just a fun thing I started doing in the past few years. They’re a hit with tourists, and we’ve made a few bucks off them.” Chris face lit with a mischievous smirk. Tina laughed.

“I’m sure we’ve spent more on them than you’d care to admit,” she said, winking at him.

“So is it just wood walkers, or whatever they’re called, that you have around here?” I asked.

“Yeah, that’s most of the weird stuff. A couple people who’ve gone missing on hikes in the area. Normal disappearances, considering the traffic we get,” Chris said.

“What about that one ghost story from the school?” Tina chimed in.

“Oh yeah, I almost forgot about that. Teachers kept saying they were counting an extra kid sometimes in their classes, but they could never tell which one didn’t belong. Rumor was that some kid must have died at the school a while ago and been haunting the place. Most of the kids never noticed.”

“Woah. That’s weird.”

“Yeah, it went away when they tore down the old school and built the new one. The ghost must not have been very committed to its education,” Chris chuckled. “You ever see any weird stuff in Portland?”

“Well maybe not to the level of that. Druggies taking a dump in public parks. That’s a spooky view on the morning commute. And there are some pretty weird coffee shops,” I said, appreciating the distance between here and Portland.

“Hopefully our coffee shop isn’t like that,” said Tina, shooting a faux-scared look at Chris.

“No, honey, you’d definitely scare all the ghosts away,” Chris teased. We had a good laugh, and Chris kissed his wife and got us glasses of water from the kitchen. As we settled back in, Tina spoke up.

“Abby, what does your brother do?”

“Oh…um.”

“Oh sorry, is it a sore subject?”

“Um…no…it’s just that…” Compartmentalize or not. I took a deep breath. “Leo disappeared. When we were kids.”

Both their mouths fell open. “Oh my, I’m so sorry,” said Tina.

“It’s ok. It was a long time ago.”

We sat in silence for a little while.

“Do you want to talk about it?” Tina said.

“I mean, like I said, it was a long time ago. Yeah, I guess. What do you want to know?”

They sat for a moment.

“What do you remember about it?” Chris said, gently.

“A lot, actually. I mean, that night plays in my head a lot if I let it.” I felt like I had just crossed the tree line for a long hike. “It actually happened here.”

“Oh my gosh,” Tina gasped.

“Yeah, um, it was when we were just kids. I was maybe 8. He was 6.”

As I started to tell the story, I slipped into reliving it. Their house faded away.

Leo and I had been playing pretend in the treehouse all day, and in the late afternoon, took pretend naps that turned into real naps. We were supposed to go inside before the sun went down, but now we awoke to find any sign of the sun gone from the western sky. We gave each other panicked looks as we realized our mistake. Frozen in that moment, I looked passed Leo’s head out the window to see a shadow shift on the windowsill.

“Abby?” he whispered as he saw my face change.

“We should go back to the house.”

I peeked my head out of the door of the treehouse into the beams of moonlight cascading diagonally through the trees, creating an eerie pattern across the forest floor. The way to the house was clear, and I could see the light on, its dim orange glow the only hope of self-rescue. I scrambled down the ladder and turned to see Leo peering into the woods.

“Leo, come on.”

“I don’t want to go.”

“It’s ok. Hold my hand.”

A twig snapped in the woods. Leo’s gaze shot into the darkness. I grabbed his hand, and he turned to me, moonlight making the whites of his eyes glow.

“Come on!”

He scrambled down the ladder, missing the bottom rung and falling on his butt. I picked him up, grabbed his hand, and started running down the decline.

We padded quickly through the chasms of shadow. I strained my eyes to see the tree roots I knew were hiding in our way. Leo’s hand gripped mine tightly as I led us, his weight pulling at my shoulder as we jerked and stumbled our way to the orange light.

Wind picked up in the trees. They creaked, shifted, and groaned. I tried to pull Leo faster.

My heart pounded in my head. The sound of our footsteps seemed to multiply and echo throughout the forest as the wind picked up even more. I was afraid to look back. We were close. The backyard was right there. A few more steps.

Leo’s hand slipped out of mine so fast I barely had time to squeeze. So close to the tree line, I turned around expecting to see him scrambling up after tripping over a root. But I couldn’t see him. His eyes didn’t show in the moonlight. My heart constricted as I heard what sounded like footsteps every which way through the forest. They were running away.

I turned to the glow of the orange light just as my grandma opened the front door and saw me.

“Abby, oh good, it’s time to come inside. Sorry, Grandma dozed off. Where’s Leo?”

I started to cry as I turned to look back at the towering forest, now silent and still.

By this point in the story, the waves of memory had broken me down to tears. I clutched at the tissues as the pain I had pushed down for so long reared its ugly head.

Tina and Chris just sat there. Their faces were pools of sympathy. Without a noise, Tina glided over to me and gave me a hug. Chris got me another box of tissues.

“I’m really sorry that happened Abby.” Tina said, rubbing my back.

Chris sat. “Did they ever find him?”

I wiped my eyes and cleared my throat. “They searched, but it was like he got picked up and carried away. My grandparents kept searching. They mapped and searched everywhere. My grandma never gave up hope.” A sad smile tugged at the corner of my mouth. “She’d leave baked goods outside every so often in hopes Leo might get hungry and come out of the woods. But she was probably just feeding the raccoons.”

The night kind of fizzled after that, but I was happy that Chris and Tina mentioned having me back again. They invited me to church even. Falling asleep was the easiest it had been in a while.
