Last year, my friends and I decided to do a three-day hike on the Ouachita Trail. Ben, Sean, and I had done multi-day hikes together on different parts of the roughly 210-mile trail before and were hoping to knock out another section before the summer was over. The section we decided to hike this time had a public camping area at the base of the trailhead that led to the Ouachita Trail proper, which we had decided to take advantage of.



We had parked Ben’s car at the ranger station near our endpoint and carpooled in mine to the camp. When we arrived, the sun had started to set but the place was bustling. Kids were riding bikes around the footpath and families were sitting around grills, enjoying the scenery. Places like this weren’t really my cup of tea; I preferred more secluded, quiet areas to set up camp, but something about the communal atmosphere gave rise to a sense of nostalgia for the times my family took me camping at places like this.



By the time we set up our tents, night had fallen, and the crackling of dozens of campfires filled the air. We ate a quick supper of roasted hot dogs and a few beers before heading to bed.



That next morning, I awoke to distant shouts echoing through the campsite. I sat up onto my elbows and listened, trying to make out what was being said. Before I could determine what was being yelled, I was startled by a quick slapping at the front of my tent. Worming my way out of my sleeping bag, I unzipped my tent flap and poked my head outside. Shivering at the cold morning air, I saw Ben and Sean in front of their tents, pulling on their hiking boots.



“Get your clothes on, man.” Ben said as he saw me.



“What’s going on?”



“A kid’s missing, probably wandered off last night.” answered Sean, cinching his boot laces tight and standing up.



I turned back into the tent and started getting dressed. My heart sank as I heard the shouts become more abundant as other campers joined in calling out the child’s name.



“Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!”



I hoped that she was just in the shower room or had woken up early to go to the playground nearby, but I couldn’t help but think of the countless stories I’d heard of kids being abducted or disappearing into the woods, only for their bodies to be found miles away or not at all.



Ben and Sean were already a few campsites down from ours and calling out to the woodline when I came out of my tent. I hurriedly tied my boots and joined them.



“Do we know what she looks like?” I asked.



“Brown haired, blue-eyed, eight-year-old girl named Sarah.” Came a voice from behind us.



I turned to see a college-aged guy walking towards us ahead of another guy and a girl who were around the same age and wearing packs.



“Any idea which way she went?” Sean asked.



“No, her dad said she was asleep in her tent when he went to bed around eleven last night, and was gone when they woke up about thirty minutes ago. Said her shoes and flashlight were missing.”



“I’m guessing they’ve already checked the bathrooms?” I asked, looking towards the brick structure at the center of the campground.



“Yeah, we checked...” Said the girl, “...no luck.”



“Listen, we’re going to head to the trailhead to look while the rangers get the main search organized. I asked them and they gave us the go-ahead. Do you guys want to help out?” the first guy asked.



“For sure…” Ben said, looking to me and Sean as we nodded in agreement, “We’ll grab our packs and meet you there in five.” 



We made it back to our site and threw some essentials in our packs. I realized that I had left my water bottle in my car, but Sean, being the prepper that he is, gave me a spare. Once packed, we strapped on our packs and headed towards the trailhead, leaving our camp set up since it was clear our trip had been delayed.



The shouts had tapered off as people began to gather around a park ranger at the center of the camp area. Walking towards the trailhead, we heard sobs coming from a campsite just off the path – a park ranger was sitting beside a woman, who could only be Sarah’s mother, crying into a pink pillow in the shape of a unicorn, while a deputy stood attempting to speak to the girl’s frantic father.



We glanced at each other as we moved past the heartbreaking scene. The expressions on each of our faces were of sorrow-tinted determination.



James, Kristen, and Paul were the names of our new companions. They were each outdoorsy types like we were and were just as well-equipped.We met at the trailhead just outside of the camp area and gathered around the large wooden map, and formulated a plan.



There were several offshooting trails which snaked through the valley; “Main Street” was the eight-mile circular trail which returned to the trailhead and connected to the Ouachita Trail at the top, “Baker’s Falls” was a cutback trail which led to a waterfall four miles from the trailhead, and “Vista Trail” lead up the mountain five mile to the North.



We decided that it would be best to split into groups of two in order to hit each trail while staying as safe as possible. Paul and Kristen volunteered to take the Vista Trail, Sean and James decided to take Baker’s Falls, leaving Ben and I to take Main Street. It was agreed that we would meet at the trailhead in seven hours, giving us time to be thorough with our searches and be back before nightfall. We knew cell service would be spotty if not altogether nonexistent, but we exchanged numbers on the off chance we needed to contact each other and ensured we each had the ranger’s station’s number.



When we set off, Paul and Kristen headed North at the split and began their arduous trek up the side of the mountain while the rest of us hiked East towards Baker’s Falls. We didn’t talk much, aside from occasionally calling out for Sarah – we were afraid that by making too much noise, we might miss hearing her and didn’t want to distract each other and miss any sign of her.



Just before Noon, we arrived at the split for Baker’s Falls. Sean and James headed down the mountain while Ben and I continued on Main Street. It was a nice day given the circumstances If it were any other time, I would have been greatly enjoying myself, taking in the cool air and absorbing the majestic scenery, but, for obvious reason, I didn’t pay any of that much mind.



After a while, James and Sean’s echoing calls faded away as we made our way towards the intersection with the main trail. We took our time, listening intently between each callout. The trail began to turn North up the mountain at a sharper angle, slowing us down quite a bit. It was fairly taxing and I found myself calling out less as I began to run out of breath. It had been a while since I had last hiked with a pack. I noticed Ben starting to struggle as well so, I suggested we take a break, after all, we had been going non-stop for several miles at this point.



We found a shaded spot next to an outcropping of rocks just off of to the trail, took off our packs, and pulled out some snacks. We sat silently eating and listening between deafening bites of granola. 



At first, it sounded like a bird. In the distance behind us, a ways off of the trail, I heard a shrill cry. I stopped chewing and tapped Ben.



“Listen… You hear that?”



After a moment, it echoed again. A muffled cry that was almost certainly that of a child.



We both jumped to our feet and called out.



“Sarah!”



The cry responded.



“Shit! She’s up there!” Ben cried as we both made our way around the outcropping, leaving our packs where they sat.



“Sarah! Keep making noise! We’re coming!” I yelled



The cries became clearer as we trudged our way up the mountain off the trail, slipping on loose rocks and sticks. We were getting close.



Ahead of us, we saw what appeared to be an opening on a small plateau through the trees. The vegetation began to thin out, and the ground became saturated with flat, rough, gray stones, which were much different than those that we had seen so far. As we made our way to the opening, it became evident that the crying was that of a little girl.



The trees gave way to a large glade of gray stones – no trees or plants in sight.



“Sarah! Where are you?” Ben called, straining to catch his breath.



“Down here!” a small voice squeaked from somewhere in the glade.



In the middle of the opening was a small rise in the stones. Once we were about fifteen feet away, I saw that it was the raised lip of a large hole about seven feet across and blacker than night, a short way down.



“Jesus… Sarah! Are you in there?” I called down into the abyss.



“Yes!” she replied through her sobs.



Her voice echoed up towards us. She was a long way down.



“Are you hurt?”



“I… I can’t stand up…” she cried.



“Dammit… Ben, did you put any rope in your pack before we left?”



“No, did you?”



“No… Sarah, are you bleeding?”



“I don’t think so…” she said weakly.



“It’s too dangerous to try and climb down there. These rocks could come loose and cave the whole thing in,” said Ben, testing the edge of the pit.



I pulled my phone from my pocket and unlocked the screen, but found there was no service. Ben did the same and shook his head.



“Ben, get back to the trail and get help. I’ll stay here with her.”



“Alright. I’ll be back.” He said before running back into the trees.



“Just hang tight, Sarah, we’re getting you some help.”



Silence fell over the glade as Ben’s footfalls faded into the distance.



“Sarah?”



Her sobbing had stopped and several seconds passed before she made another sound.



“Please come and get me…” her voice was weak and pleading, “... It’s really dark in here.”



I turned my phone light on and held it into the opening. It illuminated a few feet down but no further. I still couldn’t see her.



“I promise we’re going to get you out. It’s not safe to come to you right now, I don’t have the tools and I don’t want you to get hurt any more than you already are.”



I knew she must have been scared and I felt horrible that she had to stay in that hole a second longer. I thought about dropping my phone to her for light or to play a game, but it might break and be of no use to either of us. I thought about my pack and hated myself for leaving it at the trail. I had a head lamp in the front pocket and some paracord I could lower it down to her with.



“Sarah, I have a flashlight and some snacks in my backpack on the trail. I’m going to go and-”



“-Don’t leave me!” she screamed.



It was a loud, tormented, almost angry scream.



“Okay, okay… I won’t go anywhere.”



Silence returned to the glade.



Looking at the opening and the rocks surrounding it, I noticed something odd. The rim of the pit was nearly a perfect circle – it definitely wasn’t a natural formation. The rocks appeared almost as though they had been deliberately stacked.



“Sarah, how did you get in there?”



“ I fell…”



“Did you fall from up here or is there another way in somewhere?”

There was no response for a moment.



“I slipped and fell from up there.”



There was no sign of collapse on any side of the pit. I thought that maybe it was a stable structure after all.



“I can’t climb out, my leg hurts really bad.” She groaned. “Can you please come down here with me? I’m really scared.”



I really considered it. Even if the structure was stable enough to hold my weight without collapsing, the hole was too wide for me to brace against the sides and it would take a skilled rock climber to safely climb down with as small as the cracks and ridges of the walls were.



“I really wish I could, but it wouldn’t be safe for either of us.”



There was no response.



“Are you thirsty?” I asked, remembering the water bottle I had clipped to my belt.



“Yes.”



I unclipped the bottle and held it at the side of the opening.



“Sarah, can you see me?”



“Uh huh.”



“Good, I need you to move as far as you can against the wall, I’m going to drop this bottle down to you, okay?”



“Okay.”



I listened for movement but heard nothing.



“Sarah, can you move against the wall?”



“I did.”



I paused for a moment.



“Sarah, are you sure? This is kind of heavy and I don’t –”



“-- I moved!” she screamed.

“Jesus… alright,” I mumbled as I dropped the bottle into the inky blackness.



I waited for a thump and a cry or it to clatter against the floor, but no noise came.



“Did you get it?”



She didn’t respond.



“Sarah, did you get the water bottle?”



Still no response.



“Shit… I knocked her out…” I mumbled. “Sarah!”



“I got it.” she said, breaking the silence.



I breathed a sigh of relief.



“Don’t scare me like that!” I laughed as I pulled out my phone. 



Still no service. It had been nearly an hour and a half since Ben left. I did a quick calculation and estimated that it would be at least another hour before he returned with help. I sat next to the edge for a while, letting a sense of relief and accomplishment wash over me. We had done a really good thing here, and I was more than happy to sacrifice a hiking trip to help find this girl.



I sat for a while longer, waiting for the sound of the cavalry rushing up the hillside, but was met with a bloodcurdling scream from the pit.



“Sarah! What is it?”



“Peter, there’s something in here with me!” another scream.



“What is it? Sarah? What is it?”



“I don’t know! Please come down here! Please! Please!”



“Sarah, I’m gonna drop my phone down to you! Use the light and see what it is, okay?”



She continued screaming.



I pulled my boot off and removed my sock, turned the light on my phone, and slid it inside, layering the sock on it for more cushion.



“I’m dropping the phone! Try and grab it!” I yelled over her screams as I let the phone fall.



I watched as the dim glow of the light through the sock disappeared into the darkness. A few moments later, the screaming stopped.



“Sarah! Did you get the light? What was it?”



Again, nothing.



“Sarah! Answer me, please!”



“I got it.” she said calmly.



“Is the light on? I don’t see anything.”



There was a long pause.



“It broke.”



“O… Okay… That’s fine, but you’re alright now?”



“Please just come down here, Peter…” she said in a whimper.



“I’m really sorry, but I told you its not sa…” I froze.



“Sarah, how do you know my name?”



There was no answer fo a while.



“Answer me, Sarah. How do you know my name?”



“It's on your bottle, silly.” she giggled.



“That’s not my bottle. Se… a friend let me borrow it.”



There was no way she could have known my name, at the very least my full first name. I didn’t think Ben had called me by name in the short time he was there, and, even if he did, he calls me Pete.



“Come down here.” she said in a raspy whisper.



“No.”



“Come down here!”



I stood and started to back away from the pit.



“Down here! Down here! Help! Help me!” the voice screamed changing pitches.



I stumbled back and fell onto the rocks as I heard what sounded like bone scraping against stone from within the pit.



“Down here! Help! Here!” the voice no longer resembled that of a child’s, no longer that of a human.



I stood and ran. I ran as fast as I could down the side of the mountain as unearthly screams bellowed from behind me. I fell again, this time rolling forwards, striking my hip against a stump sending a wave of dull pain through my body. I stood and ran as best I could back to the way I had came.



I wasn’t sure where I came out on the trail but I knew which way the trailhead was. I ran until I couldn’t hear the screams and kept running until I met a ranger coming up the mountain towards me at a jog.



“No! Don’t go up there!” I shouted breathlessly.



“Calm down, you’re safe. Are you hurt?” he asked.



“I’ll be alright, but you can’t go up there. That’s not Sarah… I don’t–”



“-- It’s alright, Sarah’s safe. Your partners found her halfway up Vista Trail.”



He took me by the shoulders and started guiding me down the mountain.



“Where’s Ben? Did he make it down?”



“Yeah, Ben and the rest of your crew are down at the campsite waiting for you. Y’all did a good job. Really appreciate your help.”



We walked for a while before I was able to calm myself.



“What is that glade up there, that pit? What the fuck is in it?”



He sighed and gave me a quick glance.



“Nothin’ that you gotta worry about.” he said with an uneasy smile.

  


We made it back to the camping area and I met up with Ben and Sean who both understandably, had a few questions, however, I didn’t have time to answer them since the rangers were shutting down the camping area and the trails and we had to leave. We packed up our things and loaded my car just as they were closing the gates.



On the way back to Ben’s car, I told them what happened at the glade. Ben said the ranger freaked out when he told him what we had found and told him to stay at the campsite until he came back with me. Apparently, when Kristen and Paul found Sarah, she told them her mom was calling her from the woods when she went to the bathroom that night, so she followed her voice up the trail but got lost.



Sean thinks to this day that we’re pulling some wild prank on him, but Ben and I know what we heard, what we saw.



I haven’t gone hiking since, and I don’t think I will for a while.
