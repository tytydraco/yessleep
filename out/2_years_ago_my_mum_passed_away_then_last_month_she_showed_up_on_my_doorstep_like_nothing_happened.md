It was 2 years ago, during the height of the pandemic that my mother was both diagnosed and shortly after passed away from aggressive pancreatic cancer. I live on the other side of the country and so I wasn’t able to see her from when she was diagnosed up to and including when she passed away, because of the lockdown rules and the fact that I didn’t want to potentially pass COVID to my immunocompromised mother. Ever since then, I’ve always felt an immense sense of guilt and regret because I feel like I let my mother down by not being there when she needed me the most. She ended up dying alone in a hospital, because my dad and my sister wasn’t able to stay with her, but at least they got to be around her as she approached the end. I never did.

The regret I felt at not being with her and telling her that I loved her one last time and thanking her for everything she had done for me, well it led me to going off the deep end a bit. I probably didn’t seek the counselling that I should have done and instead drank excessively to get over the grief. This went on for a year and really put a strain on my relationship with my girlfriend Sam. But Sam, to her credit stuck by me and helped me get over it, to an extent. You never really get over a parent dying, especially when one is taken in circumstances as cruel as aggressive cancer.

But I got my life back on track, I was under performing at work and the office was starting to exhaust it’s tolerance for my circumstances, so I knuckled down, made some big improvements in my employment to the point where I was starting to end up as one of the top performers in the company. We had a late service for my mother once the pandemic was over and it gave me some sense of closure.

Then last month, she showed up. 

It was a normal day, I was working from home and on my lunch break so was using this as valuable time to play Hearthstone on my phone when I heard the doorbell ring. Sam was at work, so I went to answer it and then I saw her. Mum. Standing there.

“Hey Rob, I hope you don’t mind, I was in the area and I just thought I’d pop round and see you”

“What the fuck, you died”

“Oh that, no I just needed some space that’s all”

“What the fuck is wrong with you? You died, you had cancer, Dad and Emily saw you dead after the hospital called to say you were about to pass”

“No they must have been mistaken, I went to another hospital and they sorted me out”

“Get out”

“Excuse me?”

“Get the fuck out!”

“Is that any way to talk to your mother?”

“You’re fucking sick, my mother died 2 years ago and it’s staying that way”

“Well, I’m staying at the Red Lion and when you want to apologise you know where I am”

And then she left, I couldn’t believe what had just happened, I immediately called Emily to tell her.

“This really isn’t funny Rob, it’s actually sick”

“No I saw her, I swear to God I saw her”

“Rob are you drinking again?”

“What? No! Emily I saw her”

“I’m not going to tell Dad what you said to me, but I’m really not impressed with this Rob, not at all”

I was about to call Sam, but I knew she wouldn’t believe me either. I needed proof, so I called up my boss and told her I was feeling sick and needed the rest of the day off, then I drove straight to the Red Lion.

“Hi, is there a Rebecca Jones staying here?”

“No I’m afraid not”

“Oh, how about a Rebecca Laten?”

“Rebecca Laten? Oh yes, she booked with us this morning, but she’s not yet checked in”

She was using her maiden name.

“Oh thank you, when she does show up, could you just tell her that her son Rob said he wanted to speak to her?”

“Of course”

“Thank you”

I drove back home and waited, I didn’t know what I was going to do, but after just a few minutes of me getting back, my phone rang

“I’m sorry mum, it was just the shock of not seeing you, I was out of order”

I needed her to think I was truly sorry.

“It’s okay, I forgive you”

“I’ve got the rest of the day off work, can we talk?”

“Of course. Meet me at the park bench next to the football pitch”

I immediately texted Sam

“I need to see you straight way, meet me at the football pitch, can’t explain why”

“I can’t just leave work babe” she replied

“Just make up an excuse, please it’s important”

“You won’t even tell my why”

“I need this babe, please”

“Okay I’ll see you in 20, I’m not happy about this though Rob”

She’d understand, when she got there she’d understand.

I waited for Sam to arrive first, before I would confront my mother, when she saw her, she’d believe me and then… I don’t know what, but at least I would have the proof I needed.

“Right I need you tell me what the fuck is going on Rob”

“Okay, this is going to sound insane, but my mum is sat at the park bench right now”

“Oh for fuck sake”

“No I know what this looks like, but you’ve just got to trust me please”

“I can’t keep doing this Rob, you were doing so well, but I told you, you need to get some help Rob, serious help”

“Please just come with me Sam, I promise you she’s there”

“When she’s not there Rob. I swear to fucking God, you are getting some serious help or we’re done”

“Okay, okay I promise, just come on”

We walked over to the bench and there she was sat there like nothing happened.

“Oh my God” I heard Sam say

“See I told you”

“You’re messed up Rob, you need help”

“What, how am I the one in the wrong here?”

“Rob I love you, but I need to call the police”

“Why?! Why!” I screamed 

“You’re scaring me Rob, oh God I think I’m going to throw up”

Mother just sat there, not acknowledging us.

“Mum say something for fuck sake!!” 

I ran over to her.

“Fucking say something!!”

Sam ran away from me. The police arrived shortly after and arrested me for desecrating a grave, but my family didn’t want to press charges. I was placed in a psychiatric ward, none of my family have been to see me since other than my mum. She comes every day.
