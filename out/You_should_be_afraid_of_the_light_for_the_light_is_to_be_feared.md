Most people are afraid of the dark, and sometimes I can understand. In the safety of my home the dark doesn’t scare me, I know what lingers there. The cats at my feet, the dogs barking in the neighborhood. It’s safe, normal.   
  
When people ask if you’re afraid of the dark they usually ask in the sense of wondering if you need a nightlight to sleep or if you’re scared to walk the streets at night. I’ve never been afraid of the dark in my own home or the dark that’s never so dark under the streetlights and lingering lights from surrounding businesses.   
  
I’d always been afraid of the darkness in the countryside, where there are no street lights or buildings lighting up to ensure you’re able to see the things around you. In the country you don’t know what lingers behind the trees or hiding in the fields you can’t see. I’d never dare to walk *those* streets at night, there is no darkness quite as dark as that made without light pollution.   
  
But now, I’m not nearly as afraid of that either. Don’t get me wrong I would still never dare to walk those roads at night and certainly not alone. But now, I’m afraid of the light. I know what it sounds like, but I’m not afraid of the day. The day is where it’s safe.   
  
It’s the lights that do appear at night that we should be afraid of. I think something sinister is behind those lights. I’ve never been one to fear the things I dream, they are after all figments of our own mind. But something was real about this one. People always say your mind makes things up, but one thing people forget is that the mind is incapable of such abilities.  
  
Sure, in the creative sense our minds are capable of creating so many things, that’s why books and movies and poems and any forms of art work or literature exist. Our minds are powerful beings, far beyond our own comprehension. It works in mysterious ways.  
  
But one thing for certain, our brains are not capable of creating faces. There might be people in your dreams you can’t recognize but something is always familiar. Whether it be the eyes or the face shape, our minds pull from the people we’ve seen, even if for a split second the paths have crossed. We might not remember, but the mind always will.   
  
The people in these dreams were real. I’d seen them before but I cannot for the life of me think of where I’ve seen them. If they were actors or writers or someone I’d seen on social media I’d have known. These were the kinds of people we read about in books, where you just look at them and you *know* in a past life you had met them before. Except it wasn’t a past life, it was a current one, and I was destined to find out what it all meant.   
  
I suppose I should start from the beginning, with the dream. If it can even be called that anymore.   
  
  
  
  
I found myself wandering the quiet halls, something you’re not allowed to do. I had been wondering quite awhile, but time worked differently here, I’m not sure how long it had truly been. But the clock on the wall, although it strained me trying to read it, said it was nearing 2am, so I made it back to my room knowing the night would be starting soon.    
  
Few minutes passed by as I sat in the room listening to all the lights clank off, the buzzing you hadn’t noticed until it was gone had disappeared. In the day there are no cameras, you can do as you please within the allotted hours. At night there were rules, rules which held dire consequences should they be broken.   
  
I received my duties through the piece of paper slipped under my door, and carefully studied them. Things weren’t normal here. Each night we got a name, the name corresponded to a color and a section of the facility. Mine that night, was Luna.   
  
Luna is black. Black means the darkest part of the facility, the one that is the most unsafe. And with black of course came the clothing. You had to blend in with the night, for the light was to be feared.   
  
The name of course also corresponded to a person. Luna was the opposite of what was grouped with her. She was everything her name meant in the literal sense. I’m sure we all know by now that the name Luna means moon, and with that comes the descriptions of the brightness in the dark, the spirituality.   
  
Luna is bright and smart and so unbelievably kind. She hated that she was meant to be grouped into something so dark and fueled with fear. In front of the cameras she was Luna, but when it was just us, it was Lulu.   
  
She hated what they made her name out to be, she was not surrounded in the dark, she was the light. Maybe they did it that way on purpose, to spite her bright nature. So for the cameras, it was Luna. But to me, she will always be Lulu, until we can find a way out of this place and she can steal back her name and be all that she’s destined to be.   
  
Luna’s was the only name not surrounded by the literal sense of the meaning. We’ve all heard the saying ‘Roses are red’ and they are. Rose meant red, the furthest end of the facility, cleanup. Violet, despite the other half of the saying is not blue, is purple. I’ve never been to Violet, and I’ve heard it’s one of the worst places to be stationed.   
  
I’m sure you get the idea by now. A name, a color, and a place. Luna is black. The wardrobe for Luna is of course black, everything has to be black. If your hair is not black it is to be covered as it will stand out in the dark. Your clothes all the way down to your undergarments must also be black.   
  
It is not as strict in other sectors of the facility but black is high risk, without the reward. You must under any circumstances blend in with the dark, for the light is to be feared.   
  
I’d made my mistake that night with wardrobe. I can’t remember how or why it happened, but my white underwear were never switched for the black pair. I’d been too late in realizing my mistake. Once the bell rang it was time to go and head to our stations, the previously empty hallways now flooded with people in differently colored head to toe clothing.   
  
I’d made my way hastily through the building to the black sector, covering my hair as I went. The hallways became quiet and still, I thought I’d have time. My mistake was simple and thinking back was so completely avoidable. I popped into the nearest bathroom, and it had to be quick so I made it so.   
  
I didn’t finish pulling up my pants before I made my quick exit from the bathroom. I thought I’d have more time. The light caught me just as I pulled them up the rest of the way. It didn’t move again. I looked to my right at Lulu, the fear and sympathy screaming in her eyes, I knew I only had one choice. So I ran, and I didn’t stop.  
  
  
  
I woke up in the hospital days later. Except it wasn’t days, it was nearly a year from the date and the last known date in my memories. 10 months, 17 days. But I’d only been in the hospital for three, slept all of them. The hospital has no explanation for my short hibernation. They tested my blood, urine, even my hair. They found nothing that could explain why I had slept for so long. My only injuries were the bruises littering my body, for which I had no explanation.   
  
I thought nothing of the dream at first. The details I shared with you, I’ve slowly began to remember since my return home from the hospital. I only remembered a fraction of it upon my awakening that day in the hospital.   
  
I accepted the short term amnesia that doctors diagnosed me with and went home to continue living my life. I figured over time I’d remember anything that happened in the ten months I’d lost, but I never did. The only thing that became constant were the dreams. Each one longer and filled with more detail than the last, but always the same.   
  
They started to feel more real, I started to feel a real connection to the people in them, I *knew* who they were. I felt it in my bones that I knew these people and I had met them before. So I started looking for them. All missing persons that matched the names of those in my dreams. For 2 months I couldn’t find anything that lead me to believe they were real people and I had almost given up, until three weeks ago I saw Rose on a missing persons poster.   
  
Rose was not Rose, she was Rachel, and she’d been missing from her small hometown for a year and a half, no trace of her since. It was that moment I realized that the dreams were memories slowly resurfacing, and I changed my tactics. I no longer searched for names in the missing persons, I searched for faces.   
  
I may not have had anybody in my life that would’ve noticed I was missing, but Rachel did, and others might. So I kept searching and I found two more. But the light found me.   
  
It was two weeks ago I first noticed it, making the short walk from the corner store to my little apartment. It seemingly came from nowhere, no apparent reason or source, it just followed me.   
  
In these past two weeks the light followed me anytime I left the house at night. Sometimes I see it lingering in my window before bed. Someone or something knew I remembered, and they knew I was searching for everyone they’ve taken.   
  
I might not remember what it was they had us doing in that facility or why, but I know it wasn’t willingly. I won’t stop searching for them and ways to find them and help them, but I know the light won’t stop following me either.   
  
But I will keep hiding from it when it comes, for the light is to be feared. *I just wish I could remember why.*
