I write this as my last resort as it seems that whenever i bring this up with other forums i either get called a conspiracy nut or get called a troll or a fucking ARG or something similar to that and i just want to rip my hair out at this point.  


At this rate i'm starting to think of making this thread as a blog or something to note the whole situation down because i'm just unsure of what to do 

I know it might sound crazy at first but i think that something happening in my town, like something relating to the government type of crazy, Ill try to write things to the best of my ability, since my memory is currently foggy and i'm just freaking out rn  


A Couple of weeks ago we had some issues with the local pipe system, which wasn't surprising since we live in a town in bum-fuck nowhere so a lot of the utilities weren't renovated since like the 1940 maybe 50s it didn't help with this fucking heatwave were having,

since again we lived in the middle of nowhere it would take a while for people to fix it so we had to use bottled water, it isn't really fun to carry an entire pack of bottles trough the Nevada sun.

One of my neighbors, an old ex-military veteran, had to go out of town, something business related, i cant remember the exact details, what i do remember is that he didn't return that night or the next one, so her wife had to call a missing persons report, we spent what felt like ages searching trough the dusty roads

it took us 4 hours before we found his truck, it was halfway in a ditch the front of the hood looked like it hit a moose

So we began to search the fallowing area, the guy looked like he seen a ghost, talking about something running in-front of the road, he wouldn't explain why he left the car he just kept rambling about this large ugly devil

I think that two days ago these unmarked military vehicles just showed up i dont know if they were actually associated with the military or anything else they just began propping people around the outskirts of the town ive tried to talk to them but they just told me off,

We aren't even allowed to leave the town anymore, they're saying that were under quarantine for something?? they wont even specify for what

Some of us actually tried to leave the town heading for the city but they either turned them around or just fucking dragged them off to somewhere im not even sure were 

Ive tried reaching out for my Dad but the calls wont go trough its been like this for days i think they cut the cell service 

and the water is back on but it dosent seem right like its not actual water it smells flowery

I'm not sure how to put it into words but it just looks off and tastes off, ive tried my best to just drink as little as possible 

please send help
