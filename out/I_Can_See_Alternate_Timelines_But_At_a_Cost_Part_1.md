I was about eight years old when I first realized that I could see, and even choose, alternate timelines, though I could never manipulate them. At the time, I had no words for what was happening to me, only the growing sense that reality wasn’t as fixed as everyone else believed.

It was an ordinary day. Mom had just returned from work and wasn’t feeling well, nauseated and fatigued. I sat beside her, anxious, watching her closely. Dad was out of town, and it was just the two of us at home. After a while, Mom asked for a glass of water.

The moment I stood up, everything froze. The room I was sitting in split into two identical versions of itself. At first, I thought I had fainted, that I was watching a dream unfold. But it wasn’t a dream, and I knew it with a certainty that scared me.

In one room, I walked out, fetched a glass of water, and returned, only to find Mom dead. In the other, I stayed exactly where I was. The air thickened, the room filled with a pale haze, and Mom was healed.

I was immediately drawn to the second outcome, but I didn’t know how to choose it. Just as panic set in, two doors floated towards me, one marked by a dead mother, the other by a living one. Of course, I chose the door where Mom lived. Everything remained frozen except for one of my hands, which alone could move to make the choice.

The instant I did, I found myself waking up beside Mom, as if I had been dreaming. She stirred moments later, smiling as she stroked my hair. She looked healthy, alive, and completely unaware of what had almost happened. But something was wrong. Her eye color had changed. They were slightly grey, dull.

From that moment onwards, it began.

At school, whenever bullies harassed me, timelines would appear, and the doors would show up. I would choose the one where I was saved, where the situation dissolved before it could hurt me. The next day, those same bullies would act friendly, too friendly. Their eyes would be light grey, and their grins wider than ever.

At the same time, I began to feel something deeply unsettling. I would find myself present somewhere else while frozen in the real world. The first time I helped Mom, I had been frozen only until I chose the door. But from the second time onwards, things changed drastically. I would remain frozen for minutes, my body locked in place.

Once while driving a car, I had almost gotten off the cliff. But then the timelines appeared, and then the doors. Choosing the one in which I survived left me frozen for an hour or more. While driving off, I saw an oncoming truck, the driver had grey eyes.

During those times, I was never present as myself in the real world. I was somewhere else entirely. I remembered things I had never lived, experienced events that had never happened to me, and did things that weren’t humanly possible.

But greed had caged me.

The timelines became a habit. The world became my playground. Whenever I felt anxious or afraid, the timelines appeared to rescue me. I stopped asking why they came and stopped caring what they took in return.

This went on for fifteen years. I was given countless opportunities and lived countless lives in parallel, slipping between versions of myself without hesitation.

Then, abruptly, it stopped.

And the ones who had been touched by the timelines began to change, becoming something they had never been before.
