It felt like years had passed while I was in that room. It croaked and cooed, trying to mimic my team's voices, and was getting better. When it initially tried to mimic, it sounded like a parrot, but over time it got better. It was torture. I couldn’t sleep; even though sleep was tugging at my mind, my fear kept its hands at bay. After what felt like decades, it stopped talking and stopped trying to get me out. I looked out the window; it was morning already. The storm was finally calming down after 4 whole days. I heard something quiet, and I had to focus hard on it to hear it.

It was the radio; it was finally working. I had to call help. But that meant traveling outside to see that thing and what remained of the guys I was close to. But I had too. I waited and waited for it to be safe. I walked out and heard nothing but a low rumbling. I walked past the cafeteria and looked in to see Garret, it was a horrible sight I won't describe fully, but his head looked like shitty chilly with large ground beef chunks.

That low rumbling was persisting, but I paid it no mind at the time. The air was still and freezing. When I finally got to the radio room, I saw that the headset wasn’t plugged in, which was why I could hear it. 

“Base xxxxx this is Quebec-01, are you ready for pickup?” A voice yelled through the radio.

I rushed over and grabbed the radio. 

“Yes, Yes, we need immediate evacuation.” I said, sweat falling down my face even though it was freezing. 

“Okay, okay, we’re on our way, no need to worry.” Quebec-1 said from the other side.

I felt a huge weight lifted off my shoulders, so I turned the radio off soon after. The only other noise was that low rumbling, the constant noise. I listened closely to understand what the hell it was. When my heart dropped, I went from feeling fear to pure dread. The worst feeling I've ever had. It was breathing, I was hearing breathing, and it was fucking behind me the whole time. I didn’t want to turn around, my neck felt stiff, and my body fought against me. I had to use all my might to force my body to turn. I saw it. Towering over me in the doorway, it had been following me. It was hunching over to fully fit into the doorway. It looked into my soul, it had no pupils, just jet black. 

It reached for me and I tried to duck and run, but it grabbed my leg and lifted me up. Its tightness was inhuman for its arm size. I felt my bone begin to buckle, and my muscles were being crushed. In one swift moment it tightened its grip and crushed my bone, pulverizing the muscles, I felt my tendons snap and tear. The leg was destroyed. My whole leg was in searing hot pain and I felt blood start to travel down my leg.  It plopped me onto the ground head first. I slammed my head into the ground, not helping the headache I had from slamming my head into rocks. It grabbed my other leg and pulled me across the floor. It dragged me across the base and into the cafeteria. I was picked up by my neck and tossed into a wall. 

It then just left me. It was saving me for later, it crushed my leg so I couldn’t run away. I sat there for hours, the pain was searing, and my leg was still bleeding. After a while I thought I was going to die, but I finally began to hear the helicopter. I had to try to pull myself up, but my leg bent forwards and right at the same time. I had to push through the pain and hell I was feeling to hobble to the helicopter. I eventually made it outside, and I saw the helicopter with its blades assaulting the snow filled winds. It figured out what was happening. I heard it behind me, calling for me in Jamie's voice. 

“John, don’t go.” It squealed.

It was forming its own sentences with the mimicked voices. I had to hurry. I was rushing to the helicopter. I saw the pilot and the co-pilot get out. 

“Where’s everyone else?” The pilot asked before looking at me fully. “Holy shit— Alan help me get this guy into the helicopter now! Grab the rifle!”

The co-pilot, Alan, grabbed the rifle from the back where I'd be placed as the pilot rushed to help me. Alan is a black man with a mountain man beard, he is well-built but still skinny, he had snow stuck in his beard. The pilot was a pale guy, he was blonde and shorter than Alan, he had longer curly hair like you’d see on a 80s actor—if you read the first part you’d know who I was referring too.

The pilot grabbed me and dragged me the rest of the way to the helicopter, thankfully right as my leg finally fully gave out snapping and ripping the leg into shreds some more. Alan began shooting at it with the rifle. 

“The fuck is that thing man!” The pilot yelled as he looked back.

“No clue! Hurry his ass over here so we can leave, it isn't going down!” Alan said as he shot another 2 bullets into its core. 

Eventually I was fully dragged into the helicopter. The pilot grabbed a first aid kit and applied a tourniquet onto my leg. Afterward the pilots quickly jumped in the cockpit and started to take off. 

“What if there are others?” Alan said as he looked down from the cockpit. 

“I doubt anyone else is alive, they would’ve come with this guy, well at least I'm going to hope that.” The pilot said as he cocked his head back at me.

I felt tired so despite the deep pain I laid my head back and closed my eyes.

"Trust me, I'm all that's fucking left." I said but my voice was quivering, tears had began to well up in my closed eyes.
