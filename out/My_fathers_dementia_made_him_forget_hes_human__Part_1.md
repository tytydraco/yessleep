They say a person is just the memories they make along their journey. I agree. That’s what makes Alzheimer’s all the more cruel. A person's loving family slowly fades into obscurity, and then nothing at all. Wife, daughter, son. Disappear into oblivion. The victims of such a disease used to look at you. Now they look through you, completely unaware of your presence. For a thousand-yard stare to be cast into the never ending distance despite your wasted breaths. Birthdays, anniversaries and holidays are of no use to an empty husk. Hopeful memories fall on deaf ears. A warm hug replaced with a cold shoulder. For the last three years, this had been my dad’s fate. 

In the beginning, it wasn't noticeable, just small things here and there, forgetting to lock the car door, leaving food out of the fridge. After a few months, he would often go into a room and forget why he was there. Soon after, the symptoms started to snowball. They became more apparent at an alarming rate. My dad would get up in the middle of the night for no reason. My mother would find him wandering the halls, or simply sitting in the living room with all the lights off, boring through the walls with his eyes.

Eventually, he began to forget names. He would look at you and stumble over his words, embarrassed he could forget something so important. We always reassured him and made sure he understood we didn't hold him accountable.

Things got bad when my mom fell. She collapsed on her way to the kitchen one night, breaking her hip. She got surgery but was never able to walk properly again. My family and I unanimously decided to relocate my mother to an old folks home. Initially against the idea, she quickly reconsidered after tasting the meals. My mom enjoyed having meals made for her. She would always cook for us when we were younger, so I think she liked the change of pace.

That meant my dad had to find somewhere to go. It made sense to put him into the nursing home, but I know the nurses tend to overlook the ‘zombie-like’ patients because they can get away with it. My mom was fine there because she was still compos mentis enough to give the employees a piece of her mind should her meals be delivered lukewarm instead of piping hot. My father was a different story. He would need closer attention. My Sister lived three states over and had a busy life (or so she says.) which meant the job fell on me to look after my dad. And the easiest way to do so was to move him to my house.

Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t mind looking after him, and my mother still got to see him anytime she wanted, it was just… a lot of work. The first week was a real shock to the system. My dad would wake up confused and in a panic. He would try to wander around the house, wondering where he was. When dealing with such a problem, stairs become lethal. Broken sleep becomes a habit. I bought a pressure plate mat beside his bed that sent a beeping alarm to my room should it be stepped on. I also installed two more at the back and front doors to make sure he never left the house unsupervised.

After a while, the dementia became so bad, my father had to be taken to hospital. He spent eight months there, deteriorating. By the end he had forgotten how to do the simplest of things, like walking, using the bathroom, and speaking. My family's names and identities were long gone from the void that was his mind. Sometimes you would be able to get a word or two out of him, but he always spoke to you like he would a stranger on the street. The connection had been lost. The doctors had told us he didn't have long left. A couple of months at most. His brain had shrunk to a third of its normal size. There was nothing the doctors could do, so I decided to grant my dad one last mercy and release him from the hospital back to my house.

The entire journey home he remained quiet, staring into space. I wasn't sure if he even knew where he was, but I continued to talk to him regardless. I tried to reminisce about my treasured memories in a desperate attempt to relight the fire behind those eyes. I reminded him about the time we went fishing when I was little, and the only thing I was interested in was rocking the boat. In the end, both of us ended up in the lake, with $20 of bait dissipating into the surrounding water. I recalled the time we had agreed with Mom that we would go running every afternoon during the summer while she was at work, but really we sat inside and watched TV together. I wished to even see the slightest movement in his lips, showing some kind of acknowledgment. Nothing.

After setting up his room again, I dug out the pressure mats and placed them in their old spots. Even though my dad couldn't walk anymore, I didn't want to risk him remembering and taking a tumble down the stairs. Plus, it made me feel a little better. As if it were eight months ago when his health was a little better. But I knew it wasn't.

Annie, a girl I've been seeing recently, stopped by soon after to make sure everything was alright. I loved the way she brushed her jet-black hair to the side whenever she spoke. Like she was making sure her face wasn’t obscured. She offered to help out with my dad but I declined. She was nice enough, but I figured she would end up making things more difficult.

Later, in the evening I made dinner for the two of us. (I made spaghetti, his favorite.) After helping him eat, I sat him in front of the TV while I washed up and unpacked his things. When I finished I went back downstairs to take him up to bed. I hadn't thought about it, but lifting my dad up the stairs every night wasn't a viable option. I needed to get a stair lift. As I approached the living room, I heard him snoring over the TV. My dad was always guilty of falling asleep whenever we watched anything. His snores had always been a thing to laugh at in our family. They were just so comically loud. I smiled a little bit as I entered the living room. As I got closer, I noticed his snoring was different from usual. It was a deeper, guttural sound. I approached the couch. Going around to get a better view, I saw my dad, eyes wide open staring out of the window into the darkness. I shook his shoulders, waking him from whatever dream he was so engrossed in. It seemed to work and he snapped out of his trance. My dad looked at me and half smiled, I think for a brief moment my father recognized me.

That night I was awoken by a noise in my room. The motion mats beeped violently downstairs. It was coming from the front door. I jumped out of bed, a shiver running down my spine. Someone was in the house. I could hear skittering on the floorboards coming from the darkness at the bottom of the stairs. It must’ve been an animal. But how? I peered down the stairs, but couldn't see the bottom. If there was an animal running around in the darkness, it sounded big. And whatever it was, I could hear its claws tapping away at the wooden floor as it patrolled the ground floor of my house. I decided to close the door to my father's room and then hid in my own. Not my proudest moment, but if there really was an animal down there, I didn't want to face it myself in the dead of night. My door never left my line of sight while I called the police. I explained the situation to them and they told me they would send a patrol car to investigate. I sat for what felt like hours in my room, listening to the beeping of the front door mat, then the back, then the front again.

Over and over the mats beeped, until I heard a car pull up outside my house. The beeping stopped. A rhythmic thump became progressively louder from the stairs. It was getting closer. It was just outside my door now. A long, shallow breath inhaled from under the crack of my door. It could smell me. There was a faint clawing at my door before silence. A knock on my front door almost gave me a heart attack. I was too scared to leave my room, so I opened the window and told the officer where to find the spare key. He entered the house, and I could hear him searching for at least ten minutes before knocking on my bedroom door.

“Hello, sir? I’ve checked every room of the house, there doesn't appear to be any trace of an animal here.”

I opened my bedroom door slowly. How could that be possible? My gut wrenched when I looked over the officer's shoulder and saw my dad's door open. I pushed past the officer and ran into the room to see him sound asleep. No traces of any animal in here either.

“As I said sir, no traces of any animal. Are you and your father okay?”

I told him we were fine and asked him to do a once-over of the house. Still nothing. I didn't get any sleep that night.

About a week or so later, I had begun to put the incident behind me. I slept with my door unlocked for a couple of nights, but still kept the nightlight on. I hired a nurse to come in twice a day when I was working to check on my dad. He was still unresponsive most of the time, although I'm told the nurse got him smiling occasionally. One day when I arrived home, I was preparing dinner when I stood on something hard. It ruthlessly stabbed into my skin, making me jump. I looked at the bottom of my foot, to see a small white tooth sticking out. I checked my dad's mouth and sure enough, he was missing a tooth. I suggested we might need to look into getting him dentures if any more teeth fall out.

A few days later when I arrived home from work the nurse was waiting for me. She seemed concerned. She held out her fist to give me something. I extended my hand to meet hers, and when I did, she sprinkled about a dozen teeth of various sizes into my hand. To say I was shocked was an understatement. I felt like throwing up. She said she found them lying around the house. I wasted no time taking my dad to the dentist. I was reassured that this happens to many elderly people, just not usually at this fast a rate. The dentist took scans of my dad’s mouth and took a mold for a pair of dentures. Oddly enough, the dentist remarked, there were calcium densities in his gums. Like there were malformed teeth that had never come down. The dentist told me not to worry about it and to come back if I started to notice anything strange.

In the week I waited for the dentures to arrive, I had a few more incidents during the night. In the first instance, I found my father standing, undressed in the corner of the room, facing away from me. My dad had always been a tall man, but in that moment he seemed more slender, more - imposing. He seemed to still be asleep. His eyes were open but unblinking. They were transfixed directly ahead. I ushered him back to bed and tried to put the experience to the back of my mind. The next night was worse.

I lay awake in bed, still bewildered by my dad's sudden loss of teeth. I just couldn't wrap my head around how that had happened. I was worried something was wrong. Sleep continued to elude me when I heard a low growl coming from the other side of my bedroom door. There was no animal in my house. I had it checked. I checked it myself again just for good measure. It couldn't be my dad, could it? He had made that growling noise before, but this was different. It was louder. More sure of itself. I tried to convince myself I was crazy. Of course, I was. Any animal that makes that sound would have to be BIG. The size of a large dog at least. It had to be a burst pipe or something. I’ve watched enough horror movies to know a cliche when I hear one, but those movies all had something in common. They weren't real. This was. It couldn't be some predator in my hallway. It just couldn't. Regardless of my reasoning, I was still unable to sleep.

 

The sound started to die down around sunrise. I managed to take my mind off the noises by getting dressed for work. Carefully, I peeked around my door into the hallway and saw nothing out of place. I calmed my nerves and stepped out of my room. My foot squelched into the carpet. Something cold seeped into my socks. Upon further inspection, I could smell the ammonia. Either I was right about the pipe bursting, or it was time to move house. I ruled out the possibility of my dad getting up during the night and having an accident, as the mats would’ve picked him up. I snuck my head into his room and found him asleep right where I left him. The nurse would be in shortly to look after him for a while. I decided to also call a plumber to check the pipes.

On the way to work, I nearly fell asleep at the wheel at least three times that I can remember. I was late, but It was a damn miracle I made it there in one piece at all. I found myself zoning out all day, either worried about home life or just simply trying to catch a few. Normally, my responsibilities at work are keeping people together and making sure they don't touch anything they aren't supposed to. On the way out I received a call from the plumber. What he said woke me up properly for the first time in a while. There was no burst pipe. None of this made any sense. When I got home the nurse was just leaving from her last visit of the day. She told me I should consider taking my dad to the hospital. While I was working, he had been sitting on the couch taking in quick, deep breaths through his nose. Over and over again. After thirty minutes of this, he cocked his head and stared at the nurse. It unsettled her, but she assured me that she knew my dad was harmless. The nurse wondered if maybe he had some sort of mini-stroke. Regardless, I checked on my dad when I got in, and everything seemed normal. If anything he seemed happier. He smiled his gummy smile and I reminisced with him about the time our cat had fallen into the swimming pool.

The next day the dentures arrived. I tried to fit them, but they wouldn't quite go. I checked his mouth and saw there were small, sharp fragments of teeth protruding from his gums. He struggled when I tried to take a closer look, but it was clear they were firmly placed. The other day when the nurse gave me his teeth (yes, I'm aware of how weird that sentence sounds.) there were no signs of cracks or splinters. They had just fallen out. The thought crossed my mind to just leave the fragments, seeing as they didn’t seem to be causing him any pain, but then I pictured the idea of them getting infected, which was enough to justify the trip to the doctor's office again.

The doctor said there didn't appear to be anything unhealthy with the small shards, but to keep an eye on them. He said if I was still worried I should make an orthodontist appointment. I obliged.

A few days passed, and I continued to check on my father's mouth. On Friday I got home from work to take my dad to the orthodontist. He was alone in the house staring blankly at the television. The nurse must’ve already gone home. I checked his mouth for any signs of the shards falling out and felt a surge of dread wash over my body. The shards were longer. I rushed my dad to the orthodontist. The Orthodontist told me it was like nothing he had ever seen. They weren’t fragments from his old teeth, but new teeth entirely.

I didn’t know if I should be worried or confused. I decided on both. I had no idea what to do. My father had something wrong with him. The Orthodontist recommended keeping an eye on him and not giving him anything too hard to eat. None of the advice helped calm my nerves though.

Sleepless nights were beginning to be the norm for me. My manager, Phil, warned me of the consequences of my late arrivals.

“You know, this ain’t some store. You can’t be late to a job this important.” I worked as a tour guide at a museum.

“You better get your goddamn act together. I don’t care what’s going on. If ya keep this up, there won’t be a place for ya here.” I tried to keep silent. “What was yer excuse again? Your pa?” He scratched his ass then wagged his finger dangerously close to my face. “Why don’t you just shove him in a home for Christ's sake? He’s not helping anyone, least of all me with your shitty attendance!” I clenched my fist. Phil noticed. He eyed my balled hand and stepped back, but still kept his serious composure. He reached for the stress ball on his desk and tossed it to me.

“Here. that better cheer you up. You’re on thin ice buddy. Thin ice.”

Three days had passed since the Orthodontist appointment, and my dad almost had a full mouth of fangs. I’d never been scared of my dad before, but I didn’t know what else to do. Was I a bad person for wishing his illness would take him faster? I felt like a horrible son, but whatever was happening wasn’t normal. I called my dad's carer countless times, but she wouldn’t return my calls. Still, my dad sat in his chair, zoned out to his surroundings. He began to refuse the softer foods I usually bought for him. The only food I found he wouldn't spit up, was raw pork.
