I should have returned to my cabin before dark. That rule was drilled into me on day one. *“Leave at sunset. Never stay out after nightfall.”* But that day—*that* day—something pulled me in. A child’s voice, echoing from the forest’s depths… Not laughter, but a fractured cry, closer to a sob. Maybe a lynx. Or wind rattling the trees. I fed myself rational explanations, but my legs dragged me toward the sound anyway.

My name is Emir. I work as a seasonal ranger in the Black Pine Reserve. It’s labeled a “protected biodiversity zone” on maps, but locals call it the **Echo Forest**. When I first arrived, I asked an old man at the gas station about the name. He stubbed out his cigarette and said, *“Don’t chase the voices, son. You’ll hear what it wants you to hear.”*

Now, as I trudged deeper into the woods, a nagging detail clawed at me: There were no birds. Not a single chirp. I’d logged *“Rich avian activity”* in my morning report. But all I heard now was the crunch of dead leaves under my boots and… breathing. Not mine. Something close, like a presence hovering just behind my shoulder.

The voice came again. Clearer this time. A child’s scream: *“Help me!”* I ran. My old knee injury flared, but I didn’t stop. When I finally stumbled into a dry creek bed, I saw it: a small figure curled at the base of a pine tree, back turned to me. A red jacket, smeared with mud.

“Hey! Are you hurt?” I called. No response. As I crept closer, I realized the jacket wasn’t red. It was *white*—stained with something wet and glistening.

The child turned.

It had no face.

I returned to my cabin past midnight. My boots caked in mud, hands trembling. As I bolted the door, my phone lit up: 22 new messages. All sent by **me**.

**“GET OUT NOW.”**  
**“CAN YOU HEAR ME?”**  
**“IT’S REPLICATING.”**

The timestamps read three days ahead. I hurled the phone against the wall. The cracked screen reflected my face back at me. But my reflection was smiling.

Morning brought false normalcy. Sunlight pooled on the cabin’s wooden floor; the coffee pot hissed cheerfully. Then the radio crackled to life.

*“…warning…forest…escape…”*

I flipped open my logbook. The entries for the past 48 hours read:

*“Oct 12: Routine patrol. No anomalies. Note: GPS malfunctioning, weak signal.”*  
*“Oct 13: Child’s corpse found near creek. Facial deformity. Failed to notify authorities (comms down). Body gone.”*  
*“Oct 14: Comms offline. Food supplies low. Attempting exit.”*

Today was October 11th.

I slammed the logbook shut. The ink on my fingers was still wet.

By noon, I found it: the red jacket snagged on a broken branch. When I touched it, images exploded behind my eyes—

*A man. Older, but with my face. Running. Footsteps behind him—too many to count. A scream like splintering wood. Then—*

I dropped the jacket. My palm was smeared with crimson. Not blood. Something amber-thick, reeking of burnt hair.

Nightfall broke the rules. I stepped outside. My flashlight beam carved shadows into monsters as I walked. Every ten steps, I glanced back. Something was watching. *Hungry.*

The creek bed had changed. The water had vanished, replaced by thousands of white stones. Each the size of a human tooth. When I picked one up, a voice hummed inside:

*“You found me.”*

The stones began to clatter. *Click-clack-click.* A rhythm. A heartbeat. I ran. My boot caught a root, and I fell. The flashlight died. In the dark, I felt damp breath against my cheek.

I woke in my cabin at dawn. Clean clothes on my body, hair soaked. A note on the counter:

*“DON’T LEAVE.”*

The handwriting was mine.

Days blurred. The radio looped the same phrase: *“Echoes never die.”* My food ran out, but I felt no hunger. Just… fullness. As if something inside me was growing.

One night, I stared into the mirror. Small white stones nested in my hair. My teeth wobbled. When I pulled one free, there was no pain, no blood. Under my bed, I’d started a collection: 32 teeth, 17 fingernails, 2 glass eyes…

Finally, I understood. The forest wasn’t hungry. It was *lonely*. It fed on our echoes—our fears, memories, darkest thoughts—all festering here, rotting into new shapes.

The night I burned the cabin, I saw them in the flames: faces writhing in the bark, handprints in the soil. And far off, a small figure in a red jacket, dragging itself toward the creek…

I’m writing this now. Maybe someone will find it. But listen: If you ever hear a child’s voice here, **don’t answer**. Because the echo will wear your voice. And once the forest claims something real, it never lets go.

*P.S. Please come to the ranger station. I’m so alone. So hungry. Please—*
