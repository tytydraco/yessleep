“A blanket?” I couldn’t keep the tone out of my voice as I looked at the ratty patchwork quilt in my mother’s arms. “And that’s supposed to help my situation, how?”

  
“A security blanket.” My mother corrected, but she seemed to hesitate for a moment. Then she stepped in close to brush my hair back. Her eyes, the same green as my own, flashed at the fresh bruises along my jaw, overlapping the older, yellowed bruises near my eye. “It’s been in our family for generations. It’s helped me before, it’ll help you too.” 

  
I started to protest again as she pushed the blanket into my arms. “Hush now. Just get a good night’s rest with this, sometimes a problem doesn’t seem so bad after you’ve slept on it.” 

  
With a gentle kiss on my unbeaten cheek, she turned and left my room. I eyed the blanket and sighed before spreading it over my bed. It was the weirdest looking quilt I’d ever seen, all the patches seemed random. There was a square of handsome red plaid, next to a really old faded piece of denim. There was even a square that looked like fur of some kind, and another faded scrap of flowery cloth. With a sigh I fell back on my bed and began touching the different squares, feeling the different textures. The blanket smelled good at least, like a combination of my mother and lavender. 

  
I suppose I did feel calmer, but I still didn’t see how tomorrow would make things any better. I closed my eyes and thought about my situation.   


  
My situation. Trenton Hodge. He lived down the street from me and we both had to walk home along the same secluded dusty stretch next to the train tracks. He was a few years older and at first mostly just ignored me. Then he started walking home with friends, filming stupid stunts as they went. I guess the stunt videos weren’t getting enough likes, because one day they started throwing rocks at me, calling names, the usual bully stuff. It must have given them what they were looking for because it escalated to taking my backpack, pushing me down, trying to humiliate me on camera any way they could. 

  
I didn’t want to involve my mom. It’s just me and her, and she’s been picking up double shifts more frequently to get a bit ahead. If I told her about this, she’d have to get me a sitter or not be able to work late. I didn’t want to do that to her. So, I tried to ignore them, then I tried to be friendly. I even tried running home ahead of them, but their legs were faster and stronger than mine. I dreaded the walk home.   


  
Then one day they weren’t there. I hurried along the road, not wanting them to catch me. My stomach sank when I heard a giggle. Before I could turn around they’d grabbed me from behind and dragged me up onto the tracks. Trenton’s friend filmed while they wrestled me to the ground with my arms behind my back. I tried to scream but Trenton’s meaty hand shoved my face into the gravel between the tracks, hard. Trenton’s friend’s laughed as Trenton put on an old-timey villain's voice, pinning me onto the tracks as he talked. 

  
“What the hell are you kids doing?” I heard a loud voice behind us exclaim. It was our neighbour, Mr. Roberts. Trenton scrambled off me, excuses tumbling out of his mouth as he hauled me up off the tracks.

  
“We were just messing around with Triston, right Tris?”

   
Mr. Roberts didn’t buy it for a second. He drove me home and when my mother got home told her what happened. She called the school, against my pleas. I watched as she spoke icily to the principal, fingering a small scar on her forehead. She only did that when she was really upset. The next day I heard that Trenton and his friends had been suspended. I stupidly hoped that might make them leave me alone. A few days went by and the bruises on my temple began to fade. 

  
My reprieve was short. Once they were back at school they came for their revenge. The beating they gave me was awful, but even scarier was the look in Trenton’s eyes. Like he didn’t want to stop. Finally, his friends stepped in and said I’d had enough. The look in his eyes promised more to come. They left me crumpled on the side of the road, cheering and whooping like victors as I cried hot tears of shame into the pavement. 

  
I shivered again at the memory and wrapped the quilt around me, cocooning myself in it. I drifted off to sleep thinking of my mother. 

  
I opened my eyes, then realized I was still dreaming. At least, I must have been. Only it wasn’t like a dream I’d ever had before. I floated above my bed, staring down at myself wrapped loosely in the quilt. I saw myself mutter and roll to the side, the quilt slipping to the floor. I watched with fascination as the quilt began to move, all on its own. Slithering like a snake, it made its way to my open window and slipped out into the night. Attached, like a tethered balloon to a string, I followed. 

  
It was hard to spot in the dark grass, but for the bright red plaid square. I didn’t understand how I could feel the cool night air on my arms, or smell the sweet grass in a dream, but I savoured the sensations anyway as I watched the quilt slide smoothly over the ground while I swooped through the air above. It felt like pure freedom. Eventually I saw it stop and turn up a driveway. I felt my blood turn to ice as I realized we were at Trenton’s house. 

  
I watched helplessly as the blanket wound its way up the eavestrough and into an open window. I floated in after it, frantically trying to figure out how to get it to come back outside. I gasped as I floated in the room after the blanket and realized we were in Trenton’s bedroom. He snored loudly from his bed, dressed only in checkered pajama pants. 

  
The quilt silently slid onto the bed and draped over Trenton. NO NO NO I screamed over and over in my head, terrified that he’d wake up and see me. Terrified that he’d hurt me again. It didn’t matter that I was dreaming, and that none of this could be real. I didn’t want to be anywhere near here. Anywhere near him. The quilt raised itself up and seemed to look back at me, then softly settled over Trenton’s face. 

  
A few seconds passed, then he shifted under the quilt. Then shifted again. Then he began to thrash around under the quilt as it squeezed him tighter and tighter. Finally the limp cocoon that contained Trenton collapsed onto the bed and was still. 

  
Slowly, the quilt unwound itself from Trenton. His face was obscured by shadows, but I could see his eyes, blankly staring off into the distance. The quilt quickly slithered across the room and back out the window. 

  
Back in my room, my quilt crept across my room and settled across my sleeping form. For a horrible moment, I thought it was going to do the same thing to me that it did to Trenton. Instead, it snuggled gently against me. Against my will, I felt myself slide back down into darkness. 

  
The next morning when I woke there was a new square filled in on the quilt, with the exact pattern of Trenton’s checkered pajama pants. 

  
“I think it’s best if we both stay home today.” My mother spoke softly, shattering our silent breakfast. I looked up at her, trying to see what she knew. We’d both heard the ambulance race past our house first thing this morning. After breakfast, she asked if I still needed the security blanket. I silently shook my head. She smiled and said “I knew you were ready to use it wisely.”

  
“Did-did you have to use it like I did?”

  
She looked like she was about to cry, and rubbed the small scar on her forehead before replying softly, “Just once.”  


  
We folded it up and carried it to the trunk in the attic where she stored it. When she opened the trunk I gasped, inside was a jacket with the same bright red plaid as the quilt. I reached out to touch the material hesitantly and looked at her. She offered me back a sad smile.  


  
“That belonged to your father.”
