Point Freemark is a lighthouse at the most northern point of my country, it sits at a turning point for ships when they are travelling through the ice limit. I was supposed to remain an automated lighthouse but kept failing forcing the town to revert it to a manned lighthouse. I was the first one selected to man it before finally reverting it to a semi-auto version. What I experienced there still haunts me and my residence in this asylum does not make it easier. I am writing this now because I can feel the nights getting darker and there are shadows creeping everywhere.

When I moved into the lighthouse it was quaint and given that there was still a lot of equipment from when it was an unmanned lighthouse, I barely had space to put my things. The first few weeks involved me arranging the old equipment and making sure the light was working and so were the warning horns. It was tiring work but I managed with the help of a couple of workers who would keep asking me how the night went and I would repeat my answers and nothing happened.

I was when the seventh week passed that I noticed something odd about the place, during one stormy night that I saw something odd when looking to the sea. There a few rock outcrops that are the reason for this lighthouse and on one of them there was something standing on top. I used my binoculars to get a clear look at what it was but when I managed to focus the place was barren. The storm also was not making things easy as the wind and rain made seeing anything out there clearly difficult. I stayed awake the whole night as I had received warnings of passing ships, the whole night I kept feeling like there was something out there and I just could not figure out where it was. I would keep checking on that outcrop but there was nothing, that was until at 4 am when I saw something standing at the edge of the cliff near the lighthouse.

The figure was clad in black and just stood there looking at the open sea, I called out them to let them know of the danger of standing there. The air was frigid and the salt concentrated to the point where even sticking my head out for a couple of seconds I could taste the salt at the back of throat. I hurried to the bottom of the tower and ran out to the cliff edge only to find it empty, I spent about 10 minutes looking for the person but did not find them. Returning to the tower I looked up to check on the light and saw the figure standing at the top, how did they get up there. I checked the door before I entered and it was locked, the windows were also locked so how did that person get up there. I hurried back to check only find the place empty with no indication of there ever being. I was confused and decided to write it off as fatigue and waited for the storm to finally end so I could turn in sleep.

I spent the better part of sleeping and a person was called in to watch in case of any emergency. The drive to the lighthouse was 2 hours so I had to wait for the temporary stand in and give any instructions for them before getting some rest. The night was calm but it saw the figure again and this time decided to take a photo as evidence, when I checked the photo there was nothing but a blur. Confused I tried again and still got the same result, I checked the camera and it was in working order. I then tried to keep the figure in sight I took the stairs down and all the way the figure was there and when I left the tower they were gone and found a way to, for the lack of a better term, fly to the top of the tower. This was getting worse for me as the nights progressed the same figure remained there, I could not figure what was going on.

After a week the figure was then joined by more and I began to feel like there was something wrong here, I began to see the sky move in a way I have never seen. The clouds moved like snakes across the sky and the sky itself flowed like the water surface. The darkness sunk down to the lighthouse like a curtain, I felt like my mind was going mad. The figures remained where they were but I could see their heads were now turned to me, I saw a dark emptiness where they faces would be in the hoods.

I tried to hide from the visions all round me and the light from the lamp could no pierce the darkness outside, I tried to radio for help but all I got was static. I rushed down to the house to find something defend myself but all I had was a flare gun, running back up I returned to find everything normal. It was like I was in a waking dream, the light worked as normal and there were no figures at the cliff edge. The night was normal again. I stepped outside and the cold sea air was as it had always been, cold and salty.

The next few days were calm, and I felt like that night was just my brain telling I should get some rest. I tried to check on the history of the lighthouse but there were no anomalies, I checked for shipwrecks but there were no recorded wrecks off the coast. There was one thing that did capture my attention, 40 years before the lighthouse was built there was a ship containing pilgrims that sank of the coast, no recorded survivors and no complete wreckage. The ship was called The Anne Claire, it belonged to a shipping magnate of that time, other than that I could not find anything.

Then it happened, the night started calm and there were no storm predictions, so I settled in for a normal night. At about midnight I saw the wind pick up and the sea get rougher, I tried to radio in but all I got was static again. I felt the fear crawl back from my stomach, the night was getting darker and the smell of rotting fish. I tried to hide again holding tight to flare gun, I did not want to look out the tower. I heard the door at the base burst open and I looked down to see the shadows moving up the stairs, I began to sweat and I picked up a lens cleaner staff as protection. I watched the shadows moved up and up closer to me and my breaths were coming faster and faster, my chest felt tighter with every breath. The darkness outside was creeping in and I felt it infect my vision. I watched as a figure emerge from the stairs and I stood back to defend myself, it came closer and I swung only to find air. I tried again and again finally running to the stairs, through the dark figures step by step I fought the fear and paranoia as I ran through the cold shadows.

As I emerged from the tower I found my self standing at the cliff edge looking up at the tower and then I heard the roar. Behind me in the sky was a figure larger than anything I had ever seen, eyes that were massive voids and the thunder that illuminated a squid like head I froze. This was not happening and I felt like I was loosing grip of reality and fell over the cliff. I was falling down to the rocks below, I could feel the air rushing past me and I blacked out.

I was swimming in a dark ocean and could see the fish around me, massive whales and sharks swimming past me. I was dreaming but this felt real and when I looked down the ocean bottom was dark, I tried to swim up but could not move my hands fast enough. I felt the tremor from the bottom and I looked down, there was the massive figure looking up at me and the panic set in. I began to shake uncontrollably and the air from my lungs was rushing in bubbles, then I awoke to see 3 people standing over me. I was lying near the front door of the tower covered in carcases of fish. I coughed and asked what happened but they told me that because I hadnâ€™t reported in last night they got concerned and tried to rush over to find me in this state and the lamp shut down. I tried to explain what happened but they wrote it up as prolonged isolation. I was moved out and they decided to go ahead with the plan of making the lighthouse semi auto.

So here I am in an asylum, I still have the drowning dream and wake up in a complete panic. I can see the dark outside calling me back. The dark is getting bolder and is now creeping in to the room and I feel the cold ocean air following it in.
