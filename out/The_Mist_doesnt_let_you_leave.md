I’ve hunted things all my life.

Not men — things. The stuff that lives in the cracks of the world. The kind that don’t leave bodies behind, just silence, blood, and the sense that something is watching you even after you’re buried.

But Naporia... Naporia still haunts me.

It’s a village out in the Beartooth Mountains. You won’t find it on most maps — just a few dozen cabins rotting under thick pine, surrounded by fog that doesn’t lift. The trees there don’t whisper; they breathe. And lately, people had been going missing.

A merchant reached out — said the whole village had pooled everything they had. Old coins, rings, trinkets passed down from dead grandfathers. “They don’t want revenge,” he told me. “They want to survive the winter.”

I’ve done dozens of hunts, more than I can count. But something about this felt... off. Too quiet. Too desperate. The kind of fear that tastes like rust in the back of your throat.

I took the job.

I arrived at dusk on the seventh night of Fogfall. It was colder than it should’ve been, the kind of cold that slides into your bones and stays there.

Naporia was half dead already. A few homes were boarded up completely. Others still had smoke curling from their chimneys, but none of the villagers looked me in the eye.

They stared from behind curtains. The dogs didn’t bark. They just whimpered.

A man in a fur-lined coat met me in the square. Called himself Jarl Wern — village head, I guess. His hands trembled when we shook.

“How many are left?” I asked.

“Fifty-two.”

I nodded. “How many when this started?”

He hesitated. “One-twenty-seven.”

I didn’t say anything. Just looked toward the tree line.

“Does it leave bodies?”

He swallowed. “No. Not really. Blood sometimes. Bits of bone. One time we found a tongue nailed to a door.”

I set my bag down and pulled out a small, thorn-wrapped charm. “You’ll keep everyone inside tonight. No fires past midnight. No opening the door — no matter what they hear.”

Wern nodded. “You think it’s human?”

I shook my head. “Worse. It mimics.”

The local inn had one room left. Top floor. Owner didn’t even ask for payment — just handed me the key with wide eyes and muttered something about “the priestess never came back down.”

I boiled a pouch of ashroot in the hearth and watched the smoke turn black. Good. If it turned blue, I’d have walked out then and there. Black meant it was still bound to the forest edge — for now.

I didn’t sleep. I sat on the floor and flipped through my codex, a stitched-together monstrosity of warnings and rituals. Page after page of things that don’t belong in the waking world.

Then I found it — a sketch of a tall, eyeless figure with bark-like skin and too many joints. Mouth stretching to the sides of its skull. The page was old, cracked. The entry was faded but I could still make it out:

The Nameless Mist
“They do not eat to live. They live to eat.”
Bound to fog. Freed by breath.
Do not speak its name.
Do not breathe its breath.
Avoid: Beartooth Range.

Fuck.

The next morning, Erlin the Miller was gone.

His wife said he woke in the night — said he heard her calling from outside. But she was asleep next to him.

He opened the door anyway.

By the time I got there, the door wasn’t broken. It was peeled open — like someone had taken a claw and slowly unwrapped it.

Blood on the floor. No body. Just the faintest dragging trail leading to the forest line, then stopping abruptly. Clean. Too clean.

The air smelled like pine needles and iron.

I crouched and dipped my fingers in the blood. Still warm.

“It was here,” I muttered.

Wern stood behind me, shaking. “What does it want?”

I looked at him.

“It’s not about want. It’s about remembering.”

I spent the rest of the day setting up wards.

I carved runes into trees with a bone knife, dipped pine branches into goat’s blood, and placed silver nails in the earth at the four corners of the village.

At dusk, I went back into the woods alone. I had to see if it was circling.

The air shifted about ten minutes in. It felt... thicker. Heavier. My breath started fogging even though the wind had stopped.

I heard something.

Not a growl. Not footsteps.

Breathing.

Soft. Raspy. Like an echo of my own, but just... off.

I spun around, ready, but saw nothing. Just trees. Mist. And the faint smell of rotting bark.

Then I heard it. My voice. From somewhere deeper in the fog.

“Help me... I’m lost...”

It sounded exactly like me. Right down to the way my voice cracks when I haven’t spoken in hours.

I didn’t answer. I didn’t move.

I waited.

A few moments later, something stepped out from behind a tree.

Not a creature. Not fully.

It was tall. Taller than any man. Its skin looked like it had grown from the tree — pale green, textured like pine bark, but wet. No eyes. No lips. Just a wide, sunken face with an almost childlike grin carved across it.

I held still.

It tilted its head. Then slowly, it backed into the mist.

Gone.

When I returned to the village, I didn’t tell anyone what I saw.

I just went to the inn, sat by the fire, and wrapped my fingers with salt-soaked twine.

This thing — the Mist — it’s not just feeding. It’s remembering the people it takes. Their voices. Their warmth. Their breath. And it’s circling now because I’m here.

Because it knows I’m not like the rest.

I don’t know how many more nights Naporia has left.

But one thing’s certain.

It knows I’m here.
