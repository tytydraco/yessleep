I'm reaching out for some advice because I've started a new job at a motel as a concierge, and things have taken a strange turn.  
  
This morning, after dealing with the usual concierge stuff, I had to make my rounds and clean. I'll spare you the details, but things got strange when I got to Room 203. Reggie told me some big shot got the room and was huffing and puffing about being 'Big Ted' and how we were 'lucky to get his business' â€” you know, typical businessman entitlement. Anyways, I got to his room, and it was clean. The strange part was that his baggage was still there, and even a suit had been carelessly left on the floor. Maybe he had gone to get breakfast, so I did a light cleaning and then got to the bathroom.  
  
The light flicked, thanks to our new motion sensor lights to save money. What was weird was that shampoo bottles were scattered on the floor, and there was water everywhere. The strangest part, though, was the fist-sized hole in the wall and the faint red stain from the hole. Freaked out, I left the room and called my supervisor, James.  
  
James is a cool guy, and when I called him to the room, he could tell I was rattled. He told me to wait outside while he checked things out. After what felt like an eternity, James came out looking calm, and I knew something wasn't right. He didn't seem surprised at all, and that made my skin crawl.  
  
I asked him what was going on, and he just shook his head, telling me not to worry about it. According to James, weird things happen in motels, and he's seen his fair share. That hole in the wall? He said it's nothing to lose sleep over.  
  
"Sometimes," he said with a sigh, "things just get a bit strange around here. Just ignore it."  
  
He warned me that if I ever hear scratching in any of the rooms, I should leave immediately and not ask questions. And if I ever come across a hole, I'm supposed to let him know right away. It felt like something out of a horror movie, but James seemed so unperturbed about it that I couldn't help but wonder how many times he'd dealt with situations like this.  
  
A weeks gone by and I don't think that the cops got involved. James hasn't mentioned it since he checked 203. It struck me as odd, but James insisted there was no need to get law enforcement involved. The whole ordeal left me feeling even more confused and unsettled.  
  
Now, I'm left with more questions than answers. What happened to Big Ted? Where did that hole lead? And why does this feel like some messed-up puzzle I never signed up for?  
  
I'm sharing this here because I need advice. Has anyone else experienced anything like this in a motel or any workplace? I'm feeling lost, and any guidance would be appreciated. Stay safe, everyone.
