it is a real story, it is from depression community, and it is too amazing so I post it here:

I am glad that you can see the post, I may send it on other relevant communities if it works well. It is relevant about something can't explain by science, you may not believe it. It's okay, I will still tell you how to get out of depression: go down and when you see capital letters you can start to read from there.

Now let me introduce myself basically, I am 20 and a freshman in China. I have been suffered by depression many years. When I was young, some of my classmates hated me and bullied me, I only had a few friends but they were also away because they were also afraid to be bullied. At the same time there was something bad happening in my family, my mum was ill suddenly and even died, she lived in hospital a whole year to survive. My family didn't notice my experience actually, I was afraid everyday, the school, the family, no one loves me. Just as many plots in books, the child became more lonely, she hated everything and felt that the cosmos deserted her.

The depression started from that time, although I got some love in high-school I still couldn't believe in it. I was afraid if I would be deserted if I did something a little wrong, I thought they didn't love me, they did that just by manner or something else.

When I was 19, namely last year, I decided to suicide. Before that I had had serious self-harm behaviors and even the delusions. Luckily I did something to help me last time, I committed a gap-year request.

You know how hard to get the courage to be a gap if you know well about my country! People think it's normal for students to suicide and abnormal to gap cause it will delay the study process. My family can't believe it and view me as a shame.

So I started my gap year in my little room and miracle happened when I was totally overwhelmed.

Warning: the experience below is too amazing, and may relevant about religion, you may didn't believe in it. You can trust it or not, but I will thank you all as you have seen here.

I have no religion and I always didn't believe in any god. But something can not be explained by science happened.

I felt that there was a figure (may girl) accompany with me, I can't see or hear her, just feel. That may delusions I think. I didn't notice her but later I even tried to make friends with her cause I was too lonely. I asked who you are and she didn't answer, she just companied, made me feel calm and warm. May be the peace environment or something others, I felt better really. It took about 3 months.

One day, she suddenly embraced me, I felt the unbelievable calm and happy, the energy came from body to my head! And at that moment, I heard her voice echoing in my brain first time also the last time.

"我就是你“

it means " I am you".

then, she left.

At that moment, I realized that that's not delusions cause the energy the embrace had is so huge, holy, warm and peace. I can't explain it and I never had feelings of such extents.

I have to say, the "delusions" hugged my soul.

I have to say, I realized that my soul changed at that moment.

The change is feelings and conscious, I realized something changed in my thinking but I can't explain by words.

I always want to share my amazing experiences with others, but you know people around me won't believe such things even the past me won't! I am afraid that I will be thought as a mad. So I didn't say it util now.

remember the change is "feelings and conscious"? After such moment, the figure left and I started to study the supernature to explain what happened on myself.

the aliens, soul, time travel, future, human origin and so on. I found something supernatural is my "feelings and conscious"! I believe in there is really some bigger things after the universe we know.

YOU ARE BEING LOVED BY THE UNIVERSE AND YOU ARE ALWAYS LOVED NO MATTER PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE.

here I recommend three (may be only one) channels to help you realize the love:

1. the youtuber[ 老高与小茉](https://www.youtube.com/@laogao) , a channel full of love, but it only has Chinese now.
2. the "toism" , the ancient book of my country "道德经“
3. the book "conversations with god", (right that's the only way working well I think)

"conversations with god" is a book about love, it gives you new perspectives about life and soul.

it says death is none, only life

it says hell is none, only heaven

it says we are all "god" and can be "saved"

it says god gives unconditional love, and explain why the depression happens and how to solve it

it helps you accept your depression and shame cause they are all special and cute

it makes you love yourself

it says "I am you"

I don't want to tell too much because the content deserves you read by yourself.

you can don't believe the god, don't believe any supernature, and don't believe me, but I still want to give the book to you ——— just view it as a story for fun, it's also okay.

So what the relevance between the book and my strange experience?

the "feelings and conscious" I got is not much, but it is the same as 道德经, it is the same as the book "conversations with god"

You see, amazing right? the cosmos doesn't want you to be lonely

I am you, I love you
