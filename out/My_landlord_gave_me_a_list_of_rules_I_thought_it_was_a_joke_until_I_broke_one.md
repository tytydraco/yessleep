When I moved into the basement suite, I wasn’t expecting much. It was cheap, had a private entrance, and came semi-furnished — rare in this part of town. The landlord, Mr. Halberd, was in his late sixties, a wiry man with thick glasses and a voice that always seemed to whisper, even when he wasn’t.

He handed me the lease, and with it, a single laminated page. “Read these rules carefully,” he said. “They aren’t negotiable.”

I half-laughed. “You serious?”

He didn’t laugh back. “Yes. Very serious.”

I read them on the walk downstairs. There were only five:
	1.	Do not open the windows after 11:11 PM. No matter what you hear outside.
	2.	You may hear footsteps upstairs between 2 AM and 3 AM. I live alone. Ignore them.
	3.	Do not look at your reflection in the bathroom mirror after 3:33 AM.
	4.	If you hear knocking at the back door between 1 and 4 AM, do not respond. No one should be back there.
	5.	On the last day of every month, sleep somewhere else. Do not stay in the suite that night.

I folded it up, thinking it was some kind of weird joke or maybe just the eccentric ramblings of an old man. I moved in on the 29th.

The first night was quiet. Cold, a little musty, but not bad. On the second night, I went to bed around midnight. At exactly 2:08 AM, I heard footsteps.

They were deliberate, slow, and heavy.

I remembered rule #2 and froze in bed. They didn’t sound like someone walking to the kitchen for water. They sounded like someone pacing. Back and forth. For almost ten minutes.

I texted Mr. Halberd in the morning:

“Hey, I heard footsteps around 2 last night? Everything okay?”

He replied a few minutes later:

“Yes. I told you about that in the rules. Please follow them.”

The third night, I stayed up with headphones on. I didn’t want to hear the footsteps again.

On the fourth night, I broke a rule — not on purpose.

I was brushing my teeth before bed and glanced at the clock: 3:34 AM.

My stomach dropped. I looked up — and met my reflection.

It was me, but… not.

The thing in the mirror was grinning. Not smiling — grinning. A wide, too-big smile that pulled up past the eyes, like a slit carved into its face. And its eyes were wrong. They were my eyes, but there was something moving behind them, like smoke or insects.

I looked away, heart pounding, and turned off the light. I slept with the blanket over my head like a five-year-old.

I tried to convince myself it was a trick of the light. Maybe I was just tired. Maybe I was messing with myself.

But the next night, things got worse.

At 1:57 AM, I heard knocking at the back door.

Soft at first. Then louder. Louder.

Whoever — or whatever — it was didn’t knock like a person. It was too fast. Like a frantic, uneven rhythm.

Knock-knock-knock-knock-KNOCK.

I sat on my bed, holding my breath. The door was just down the hall from the bedroom.

Then I heard it.

It whispered my name.

Not yelled. Not moaned. Whispered.

“Ben…”

Long and slow, like it was tasting the name.

“Beeeeen…”

I didn’t move.

I didn’t sleep that night.

In the morning, I confronted Mr. Halberd. He didn’t invite me in — just opened the front door and talked through the screen.

“I broke two rules,” I said. “What happens if—”

“You broke them?” His expression didn’t change, but he pushed his glasses up like he needed to think. “Then you need to leave. Sleep somewhere else on the 31st. Or it won’t let you.”

“What won’t?”

But he just shut the door.

I planned to stay with a friend that night. But around 11 PM, I made the stupid decision to pack a few more things before leaving.

I told myself it was fine. I’d be out before midnight.

I was wrong.

At 11:58 PM, the power went out.

Everything went dark — except the bathroom light.

It was on. Flickering.

And the mirror was glowing. Not brightly, but enough to see the shape standing in front of it.

I hadn’t gone in there.

It was my reflection again, smiling. This time its head tilted slowly to the left, then all the way back, like its neck was broken. Then it walked out of the mirror.

I ran. I didn’t grab anything — just bolted for the stairs.

But the suite door wouldn’t open.

I turned and saw the bathroom light go out.

Something moved in the hallway.

It was in here now.

I locked myself in the bedroom and called my friend. I didn’t know what to say, just begged them to come get me. But all I could hear on the other end of the line was static.

Then the knocking started again.

But this time, it was on the bedroom door.

Slow. Rhythmic. Knuckle on wood.

And the voice — now it was inside the room with me.

I didn’t sleep that night.

In the morning, the door opened fine.

I left. I haven’t been back since. Mr. Halberd didn’t even ask for the keys. Just texted me one sentence:

“It doesn’t forget.”
