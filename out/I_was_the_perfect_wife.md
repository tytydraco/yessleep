My husband, (I will call him Dean) and I have been married for about 5 years. We were the perfect couple. I was 25 and pretty much a stay at home wife. Dean was 10 years older than I was and very successful. He was also incredibly good looking. He had a great built and dark hair and eyes. He looked younger than his 35 years.  I did all the things a stay at home wife would do. I cooked all the meals. I did all the laundry. I made sure everything was perfect when he came home from work. I had my own ambitions. I was always saying I was going to go back to nursing school, but the truth was I enjoyed being a housewife. I got up when I wanted to in the morning. Did some light cleaning each day making sure the house was immaculate. Exercised, and then spent the day waiting until Dean would get home. 

Dean was a successful businessman of some kind. Truthfully, I am not even really sure what he did except that it involved loans and real estate of large businesses. It sometimes made for long hours. His secretary, Maureen was frequently the person who called me. "Dean is going to be home late today. Save whatever you are making. I am making him a dinner order. We have so many last minute things that need done. Plus we have a 2 million dollar deal closing tomorrow." These were frequently the conversations we had. Dean would get home late, sometimes I had already gone to bed and would just be cleaning up his clothes and items the next day from whatever time he had made it home. 

I felt like a lucky wife. There would be social events that we'd attend. They were semi formal and my favorite part was dressing up for them. Dean was always told he was so lucky to have such a pretty wife. I was told I was lucky because Dean was such a good guy, good looking (whispered to me by other much older wives - you know, the ones called cougars), and so funny. Dean's secretary, Maureen, was always close by following us around. When she hung around us at these social events thrown by the company, I always figured it was because she didn't really have anyone else to be around. She was just a few years younger than Dean and unmarried. I didn't mind her being around until things started to get weird. I could recall more than one night Dean would get a call from her. He'd usually get up from his chair, look at me, and say, "let me um, head to my office. I will pull that file." He would come back a little later and say that one of his important clients needed some kind of information early and first thing in the morning. "I am so lucky to have Maureen. She's so on top of everything and so good." Sometimes at first, I thought it was a little odd the way he spoke of her, but figured if I had a personal secretary maybe I would feel the same way. I knew he had many people who counted on him. However, I started to get woken up at night from his phone and when I looked over I would see texts coming in. They appeared to be coming from Maureen. They were coming at 1 a.m. Not wanting to wake him, I got up, grabbed his phone but he must have changed the password because I couldn't get in. I meant to ask him about them, but if I needed to know he'd tell me. Right?

We had just gotten home from a social function one night. It was a little late, but it had been a great time. I had socialized with a lot of people. Maureen sat with us at dinner. The conversation was pretty normal at our table until one of the clients accidentally referred to Maureen as Dean's wife, and neither moved to correct him. I was the one who corrected it. "Excuse me, I'm his wife." There was a pregnant moment that lasted a little too long followed with the old guy apologizing. Then trying to stammer his way out of it by saying, he was sorry and he was so used to hearing her on the phone, it was an honest mistake. Why were Dean and Maureen smiling at each other, and they didn't make a move to correct this guy. Also, why was Maureen between Dean and I? I hadn't noticed that. I went back to eating my soup. It tasted a little bitter. Maureen smiled at me, and said, "Eat your soup. It's good, isn't it?" For the most part I put it out of my mind, and now I am wondering if I was wrong to do so. I wanted to talk about it on the way home but my mind was a little hazy and I hadn't even had any alcohol. It was the usual flurry of activity when we usually got home. The type where you are both tired, desperately want to change, and relax to get to bed.

"These shoes have got to come off!" I complained.

"I am so glad that one was over. It's late. I really liked Maureen's dress tonight. What did you think?" Dean asked.

"What do you mean? You never said you liked my dress?" I was caught off guard by the question and suddenly a little more alert remembering what I wanted to talk about.

About that time his phone rang. "It's Maureen. Hello, Maureen. We just got home," Dean answered.

I walked over to Dean turning around so he could unzip my dress and as soon as my back was turned I had a stabbing pain to my stomach. It was so bad I let out a small cry and grabbed my stomach. Dean didn't even seem to notice. Just kept on talking. I said, "That really hurt, I don't know what's wrong" and another stabbing pain hit me. Dean shushed me! I started walking toward our bedroom while he kept talking. I got by my closet, and started taking off the dress, kicking the shoes in the closet, and was hit with another stabbing pain that was doubling me over. Dean was behind me. I realized he was talking to Maureen in hushed tones. I only realize this now, but didn't realize it then. "Uh, huh, I will call you later," I remember hearing him say. 

"Dean, I don't feel good," I started to say. I wasn't sure but I thought I might throw up and my whole body was shaking. I started to make my way to the bathroom to figure out what my body wanted to do. Dean was silent. 

"Dean?" It came out as a whine.

I could tell from his voice he was right outside the door. "Yeah?" was all he said.

"I don't feel good, my stomach is stabbing me. I am not sure if I am going to throw up. It came on like when you unzipped my dress." I shakily said. 

"Hmm. Maybe it was the soup," he sounded totally unconcerned. "Let's just get you to bed."

I came out of the bathroom. I was trying to get to the bed. I had a goal in mind: the bed. My body wasn't cooperating. My vision was coming in and out of focus, and my legs didn't seem to want to work.

"I'll help you get there," is the last thing I recall Dean saying. It sounded like he was far away in a tunnel, his voice was distorted and garbled. I must have passed out. 

Now I have a new problem. I woke up this morning, got out of bed. I can't find Dean. I went through the house, calling for him. No answer. Then I realized he must have gone into work for something. I was thinking how I felt better, but still not quite right. Something is really off. I headed back to the bedroom to grab my phone and send him a quick text. Then I stopped dead in my tracks. Someone was in my bed. I tiptoed over to the side of the bed and a strangled cry escaped my throat. She looked like me? Was it me? I tried to grab my phone and my hand went through the phone. I tried again unsuccessfully before letting out a little cry, and sitting down on my vanity chair. I tucked my knees under my chin and stared at the bed. I looked at the body. It looked like me. That was my hair, I think. My eyes were slightly open, and there was some kind of white frothy substance coming from the side of my mouth. I looked for breathing, but there wasn't any that I could see.

Then I heard Dean come home. I went running to the door and Maureen was with him. I almost said his name then noticed them embracing and kissing passionately. "How did it go?" Maureen asked. 

"I don't think she knew what hit her," Dean replied. I ran back to the room too scared to confront them. I am not sure what to do. I am going to try to listen in on them from the bedroom. They sound like they are coming this way. I will try to update later if I can. But who is in that bed??
