The door was wide open. I was just walking by, minding my own business, and I wouldn't have even bothered. But the door was wide open! And inside I could see all the treasures. I was tempted. Surely you would have done the same.

When I noticed the open door to my right, I also noticed the two overly friendly store clerks to my left. They were chatting away. They probably didn't even like each other, I thought. They were likely just distracting their stimuli-seeking-brains and killing the time left until close instead of actually working. Although normally this type of behavior would repel me away, this time I got an idea. I looked back inside the open door and into the vacant shop. On a pedestal, glowing, and singing my name was bottle after bottle of top shelf liquor. I couldn't help but think of what Fred and Amy's faces would look like when I pulled out a bottle later.

With my mind already made up I turned to go into the shop. I really thought the two clerks were too distracted and indulged in their conversation to notice me approach the store. I would sneak a bottle or two in my backpack and then be on my way. No harm done. Turns out, their conversation was as fake as their personalities. The store clerk broke off the conversation and came jogging over. Just as I was getting to the door! I had already gotten my hopes up, and just like that they were shattered. I didn't have the money to pay for a bottle.

As the clerk jogged in front of me, slowing down, cutting me off, and slightly out of breath from jogging all of seven steps said, "what can I get ya bud?" Then proceeded to tap me on the back. So at this point my hopes of getting free liquor for the night were crushed and all of sudden this guy was my best fucking friend. Yeah... I don't think so. Did I mention I had a hatchet? I pulled the hatchet from my back and in one sweeping motion across my chest landed the pointy part right above the clerk's collarbone. His eyes nearly bulged out of his head, his knees buckled, I pulled the hatchet out of his neck and and that was that. His torso fell to the dirt, that he quickly made mud.

This of course caught the attention of his best friend. And since he is apparently a super hero he came running over shouting and furious. I didn't catch what he said though. I wasn't listening. He squared me up, all too concerned with what I was going to do with the hatchet. So, I kicked him in the knee, absorbed a decent blow to the body, then stuck the hatchet in his eye. There was something about the other clerks eyes bulging out the last time that I didn't want to experience again. It's like, oh, don't act so surprised.

Coming to, I began to realize what just happened. I grabbed the hatchet out of the mans eye who now lay on his back in the mud and ran inside. I looked at the hatchet, back outside through the open door to the two lifeless bodies, and panic began to set in. With my hands shaking I put the hatchet in my backpack and decided I would quickly choose which bottle to take. All I wanted was one! Look what they made me do. With my thoughts spinning on what would happen if someone noticed the two bodies outside, it made it hard to see the labels on the bottles. My vision was fuzzy. I couldn't read. I didn't recognize any of these bottles. I know I like dark liquor, so I grabbed the darkest bottle with a green label and stuffed it in my bag. I nearly stumbled my way out of the back door. I began sprinting.

What a rush. I breathed in the outside air as deep as I could. Still sprinting, I heard the sirens start behind me. But I was gone. They wouldn't catch me. I did it.

It was dark by the time I met up with Fred and Amy. And boy oh boy was I excited to surprise them. I knew they were going to be so excited and we were going to drink and dance late into the night. We greeted each other how we normally do, made a fire, and shared the food we had gathered from the day. At the end of the meal I decided this was a good time to share my surprise with them. So, I said, "Oh, I did get one more thing." And this caught both of their attention. Anything we can come by is typically intriguing nowadays. Times are tough. So I pulled out the bottle, and their faces... well... their faces weren't quite what I was expecting. More so of raised eyebrows and the, "how did you come by that?" look. They knew I had no money.

So, Fred asked, "Did you come across a vacant shop?"

"No", I responded, "Not vacant."

"You trade for it?" Fred asked. His face turning serious.

"Uh, no... I - I killed him." I responded. Deciding to come clean as I smiled, actually quite proud to say it aloud.

They were disgusted with me. Never have I seen them so angry as they were with me now. But why? I thought they would be thrilled by this! I had done it for them. I got this bottle for them! And this is how they repay me?

"The door was opened!" I said, "I mean wide open! and the shop, the shop was completely empty. You would have done the same! You should have seen inside. I mean just spectacular. The store clerk just surprised me. Surely you would have done the same!"
