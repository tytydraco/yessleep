It was an ordinary night, and like any fan of classic cartoons, I started surfing the web in search of rare or "lost" episodes of series that I had seen in my childhood. I've always been curious about those episodes that never aired or disappeared without a trace. That night I found something that would change my life forever.

On an obscure forum, someone mentioned a lost episode of SpongeBob SquarePants. They said it was so scary that even the creators decided not to air it. My curiosity got the better of me, so I decided to download it despite the warnings.

The file only had the title: "SpongeBob_FinalClip.mp4". At first, I thought it was a joke, but once I opened it, I knew something was wrong. Very badly.

The episode began with the typical SpongeBob SquarePants intro, but the song sounded slow, as if it had been distorted on purpose. The image was blurry, and everything seemed to be shrouded in a strange fog. When the camera zoomed in on Bob's pineapple, something was different. There were no bright colors or happy laughter. The sea was dark, almost black, and the pineapple looked old and dilapidated, as if it had been abandoned for years.

The interior of the house was completely destroyed. Furniture overturned, the floor covered in marks and scratches, and most disturbingly: there was no sound except a subtle humming in the background. Then the camera panned to the bathroom. The door was ajar and a dim light flickered.

When the camera came in, there was SpongeBob, but not as I remembered him. His body was thin and disheveled, as if he hadn't eaten in days. His eyes…his eyes were the worst. They were huge and completely black, without a trace of pupils. He was sitting in the corner of the room, cradling himself and mumbling unintelligible words.

The scene suddenly changed. Now he was at the Krusty Krab, but it was night, and the place was deserted. Bob was in the kitchen, cooking something on the griddle. The camera slowly zoomed in and I could see that what he was cooking were not the typical Krabby Patties. They were…body parts. Arms, legs, and worst of all: there were disfigured faces piled up in a corner. One of them had Patricio's face, but it was deformed, with its mouth open in an expression of indescribable pain.

SpongeBob turned to the camera, with that same smile he always had, but there was something sinister in his gaze. "There's no more laughter," he murmured in a deep, hoarse voice. "There are no more games." Suddenly, the hum in the background became louder, almost unbearable. The screen went black, but I could still hear the sound of knives being sharpened and what seemed to be muffled screams.

The final scene showed Bob's pineapple from the outside, while a voice I didn't recognize whispered: "Bikini Bottom is dead. They killed him. And now, he's out for revenge." The last frame was a close-up of SpongeBob's empty eyes, with tears of blood running down his face.

When the episode ended, my computer turned off by itself, and since then, I can't get rid of that image in my mind. Every time I close my eyes, I see those dark eyes, and I feel like something, or someone, is watching me. I haven't been able to sleep well since then. And sometimes, when the house is completely silent, I think I hear whispers calling me from the darkness.

Don't look for this episode. Don't download it. There are things that are better not to see. Things you can't undo once they enter your mind."
