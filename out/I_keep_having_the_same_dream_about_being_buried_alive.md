I am not sure how much more I can take. I've seen doctors, every different type of spiritual healer, and have even tried an exorcism. But no matter what I try, I cannot stop having the same dream every night. 

I close my eyes at night. In my dreams, I wake up buried alive.

Every night, it goes like this. 

By the dim light of a match that was quickly burning out, I could see wood surrounding me. I am underground. When I press up on the top of the wooden coffin, nothing moves. The earth is packed tight around me, and the ground does not yield an inch in my efforts. I scream and thrash to only succeed at cutting my skin on ragged and rusted nails sticking out where time had shifted them out of their place in the wood. My cries for help go unheard by nothing other than the worms that lay beside me. But unlike myself, they are at least granted the freedom of movement. This wooden tomb is hardly bigger than my own body. It takes what feels like hours for the match to burn out. When it does, I'm plunged into darkness. And then, I woke up.

Every time I have that dream, I wake up gasping for breath, like the earth from my dreams had settled its way into my lungs. Once I can catch my breath, I brush my teeth because I can taste soil on my tongue. I've never been especially claustrophobic, but after the first time, I cannot go anywhere smaller than my bathroom. Otherwise, it starts to feel like the walls are closing in on me.

I've had vivid dreams before, but I've never had dreams that lingered in the way that they do. I remember every detail of being underground. Maybe it's because of the frequency of the dream, but it feels more like a memory. Over time, I learned the place of every nail, every plank of wood, and grain of dirt is placed in that coffin. I know what it feels like to be squeezed underneath the weight of six feet of packed dirt and rock and the breath in damp, stale air until I am dizzy from lack of fresh oxygen. The only thing that changes is the amount of time it takes for the match to burn out.

At the beginning, it only takes a few minutes. It doesn't last longer than any other dream, in the sense that it feels like hardly any time passed at all once I was awake. But as I keep having the dream, time becomes more concrete. I am in the coffin for 10 minutes, then half an hour, then an hour, then two. I count the seconds in the dreams, and I remember where I left off when the match goes out and I am awake. The counting gives me something to do. It keeps me sane.

It takes two months for it to reach 8 hours, like I'm having the dream in real time. I wake up sore and cramping, like I've actually been lying in a tight box for 8 hours. 

It crosses my mind more than once that someone has been kidnapping me every night just to bury me underground. I would sincerely believe it if I weren't for the match.

I've tried to put out the match myself to wake up faster, but it's always just out of reach. It doesn't make sense. There's not enough room in the coffin for anything to be out of reach. But when I move to smother the flame, it's always just on the edge of where I can stretch. It burns more and more slowly every night.

Another month passes. One night, I was in that horrible box for 16 hours. I was only asleep for 6 hours on the night it reached the 16-hour mark. During my waking hours, I desperately searched for answers. But so far, no one has been able to give me any. I am not religious, but I try different prayers as earnestly and faithfully as I can manage. Doctors give me sleeping pills, but I'm scared to take them. The longer I'm asleep, the longer I am in the box.

I don’t sleep. I can't stand to have the dream again, so I do what I can to avoid sleeping. Of course, it catches up to me fast. My mind started to break. I began to forget little things at first. Then I started to see things. They started out as dark and formless things at the edge of my vision that darted away when I tried to focus on them. I heard what sounded like my name being called, but when I turned towards the voice, there was no one there. I sleep in short bursts to keep myself running. No longer than 15 minutes, if I can help it. I don’t dare let myself slip into REM sleep. Of course, sometimes I’m so tired that no amount of alarms will wake me up. But I sleep for as little as I can get away with.

I stopped going out, stopped working, and stopped taking care of myself. I told my job and my family that I was sick. And when they asked for details, I shut down the conversation.

Yesterday, is when I realized that I was running out of time. 

I found a hole in my backyard. 

It's not that deep, but I don't remember how it got there. It was only after I saw it that I noticed that there was dirt caked under my fingernails. My arms ached like I'd been lifting something heavy over and over. I do not remember digging that hole, but I know that I am the one digging it. I know I am sleep deprived, but I should not be losing such large chunks of time yet. I shouldn’t even have the energy to spend digging up the dirt with my bare hands.

I ended up sleeping for 5 hours last night, according to the clock. But I was buried for so much longer. I'm not ashamed to admit I spent the entire time crying and begging for help, gasping and choking on stale air. And even when I finally woke up, I still lay on my side for a long time, begging for help from anything that might hear me.

There was soil in my sheets. Beetles and earthworms scattered and writhed across my skin. I could picture my body melting into the earth itself, becoming no longer a home for my own soul, but for the forgotten things that lived underneath the ground. I could only hope that I would cease to be, rather than stay tethered to the spot where I would continue to rot until the end of time.

When I gathered the courage to climb out of bed and look out at my backyard, the hole was bigger. 

I stared at it for a long time. I don’t know how long. The hole seemed to stretch on endlessly. I felt that if I fell down into it, I would be swallowed. The earth would seal over around me and the grass would grow like I had never made a mark at all. The earth would no longer be my home, but my prison and my devourer.

When I washed my hands, the sink ran brown and red, and I could see where the skin around my fingernails was split.

I am writing this during the brief period of lucidity I get after waking up from that dream. If anyone knows why this is happening to me, please, tell me how to fix this. When I look down into the growing pit in the earth, I see my fate staring back at me, and I cannot stand it.
