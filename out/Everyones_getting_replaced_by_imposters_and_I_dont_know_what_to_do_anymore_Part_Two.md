I remember once I read an article. I don't remember that much of it, I think it was like a persuasive essay I was peer reviewing for English or something? Anyway, I think it was about the existence of aliens or something. The only reason I remember it is because the author- whether it was my classmate, or somebody else- had this really chilling point tossed in near the end. 'There is a fairly well-known psychological phenomena called the uncanny valley. It describes the uneasiness that is felt when viewing something that looks close to a human, but is not quite human, such as a doll or some forms of CGI. The very fact that the uncanny valley is something that occurs so widely-spread in humans implies that, at some point in human history, likely early evolution, humans had a reason to fear something that looked like them, but was in fact not.' It was spooky, but at the time it didn't keep me up at night or anything. Now I can't help but wonder if these imposters are what early humans had to fear.

After I posted yesterday, I went to bed. This morning I went to school and told Wes about what happened last night. I didn't go too much into details because I was so shaken still, and trying to tell him before Beck showed up, but I gave him the gist of it. Cyndi went crazy and tried to kill me and Andy.

He nodded after I finished. "Well... that sounds a little far-fetched..." He said slowly. I felt my face go hot.

"It happened, okay? I'm sore from sprinting and dragging Andy's dead weight before doing a proper cooldown, and Andy's arm is like all scratched up-"

"Hey, Cal, calm down, okay? I'm not saying I don't believe you, just that...well... people who can actually do something about it wouldn't believe it."

I nodded, rubbing my arms. "Yeah. Okay." I bit my lip. "Did anything like that happen with Beck last night?"

He shrugged. "Nothing that dramatic, that's for sure. Just more small things. If it weren't for-"

"Hey guys! What's up? What'cha talking about?" Beck slung his arms around our shoulders, walking in between us, and we both jumped. I laughed nervously.

"Uh- nothing- we're just-"

"Talking about how I'm gonna fail History." Wes jumped in smoothly with a groan. "I do fine on the tests, but the homework and stuff just is NOT working for me."

"Well, make sure that you're keeping up, Wesley, because we need our star striker for the game Friday!"

"Thursday. Tomorrow." Wes said, staring at his 'twin'. "And I'm goal."

"*I'm* striker." I said, glancing at Wes. He looked at me and gave me the faintest of a shrug before Beck jumps in again.

"Right, that's what I meant." He said, his grin widening.

Nothing else really happened the rest of the walk to school. In fact, not much happened the rest of the morning. In study hall, Wes came and sat next to me again. "Cal, look what I got!" He said, holding up two library passes. I stared blankly at him. He rolled his eyes. "So we can research? See if...whatever this is has a history of happening."

I nodded in appreciation, grabbing the other pass. We practically sprinted to the library, and once we got there we split up after a quick game of rock paper scissors to determine who gets internet research (I lost). After about 20 minutes of tedious digging through books- most of which were very unhelpful- I went over to Wes again and dropped the three books I had found next to him.

"Here's all the books I found- are you playing Solitaire?"

"Yup, because I already found all I needed to." He grinned, pulling up a YouTube video. I raise an eyebrow.

"Invasion of the Body Snatchers?" I roll my eyes. "Come on, Wes, this is serious!"

"Right, right. I *am* being serious. It's aliens. It's gotta be."

"No. What real evidence do you have for that?"

"None, but we have no real evidence to actually suspect anything weird is actually going on."

"Really?" I counted off on my fingers. "Beck being disrespectful. Beck not whining about his injury. Him calling you 'Wesley'. Him getting the game day mixed up- you can't seriously think he would do that. He circles them on his calendar! Also, him getting our positions mixed up! No way he would normally do that! Add that to Cyndi acting weird and trying to KILL ME AND ANDY-"

He quickly shushes me. "Okay, okay, fine. We have *some* evidence. What do *you* think it is if not aliens?"

I shrugged. "I have these three books, one says ghost possession, one says doppelganger, one says wendigo. I-"

The bell rang, cutting me off. I frowned. "Okay, try to do more research on them, and we'll meet at my house after soccer, okay?"

"What about your drama class?" I held up my phone.

"Called in sick. Andy's doing the same. We're staying as far from Cyndi as possible, at least until things calm down some."

He nodded. "Good plan. Hey, we should cut through the woods together. Get some talking time in without Beck following us around."

There was a small patch of woods behind our houses. Beck, Wes and I all used to play in there, until Beck stepped on a hornet's nest when we were ten. Since then, he's sworn up and down that the woods are too dangerous, and he stays out of them. I grinned.

"If he doesn't follow us, we can talk without him. If he does, we know it's not him. Win-win."

He nodded again, more enthusiastically this time. "Exactly!"

I'll just skip over the rest of the school day- nothing really happened, other than Beck grinning at me creepily during practice. I can't be sure, but I thought I saw the same grin on other people throughout the school day. As soon as practice was over, me and Wes practically sprinted to the woods line, getting in as fast as possible so that Beck wouldn't follow. We slowed down once deep enough inside that we couldn't hear Beck if he were calling for us.

"Did you see Caleb had that same creepy grin?" Wes asked quietly as we were paused, catching our breath from the sprint in.

I nodded, breathing hard. "Yeah. Lily did too."

He shivered. "I hope we're just reading too much into nothing, cause if we're not-"

I shook my head, starting to walk. "Don't. I don't even want to think about it."

He nodded, walking beside me. "We should come up with a codeword. You know, like we do in soccer. To see if we're us or not."

I sigh. "Fine. Just please don't pick something stupi-"

"I solemnly swear I'm not a bloody crank." He said cheerfully. I almost tripped over a tree root.

"Wes what the heck- stop- that's too much to remember, dude!"

"Harry Potter, then Maze Runner. Not that hard." He grins mischievously. "Unless you want me to change it to plea-"

"NO THANK YOU" I rolled my eyes. "You're unbelievable."

"My favorite, then yours. Easy to remember, but hard to guess."

I nodded reluctantly. "Fine."

He grinned triumphantly, then his face lit up. "Oh! Also! I don't think it's ghosts. It'd either have to be one powerful ghost or just a super insane coincidence."

I shrugged. "Okay, whatever you sa-" My sentence got cut off by a rather undignified scream on my part, in sync with my left foot sinking into something and me falling over. Wes snorted and I scrambled up- or at least tried to. A burning pain shot through my leg, and I fell back again. Wes hurried over, starting to help me up. He paused, brushing away some leaves, and then recoiled with a curse under his breath.

"What-" I got up, leaning heavily on him and hopping on my non-injured foot, and caught my breath.

I'm not great at descriptions, but I'll try my best. I had stepped on a oblong mass. It was a pale, pulsing purple, with lighter purple webbing attaching it to the ground and a nearby log, and it had a relatively hard shell, which I had cracked when I stepped on it. It was decently well hidden under dead leaves and small bushes, and the webbing covered large parts of it, but I could see what looked like a person floating inside. Wes leaned in to get a closer look, and his expression changed. He lunged forward, tearing leaves off, and paused, breathing heavily.

Without him to hold on to, I fell over again, and pulled myself closer. "What? What's-" I gasped. The face of the person inside was more clearly visible. It was Beck. His hood floated around his dark hair, and his eyes were closed.

"I- I need to get him out of there-" Wes said, and raised a fist to try to punch through the shell. I caught his elbow before he could swing.

"We don't know what's wrong with him! We don't want to hurt him!" He paused a moment, my words registering.

"I am going to kill the fake him." He said coolly. "Then we're going to go to that girl you know, Cyndi, and make her fix him."

"Hey, calm down-"

"No! He's my *brother*, what do you want me to do? I need to save him-"

"I know. Trust me, I'm as upset as you-"

"Oh, no you're not Cal. You're not even close. You don't get it, I would burn the world down for him." His eyes blazed with a cold fury I had never seen in him before. I backed away, wincing as my foot bumped against a rock and pain shot up my leg again. 

"Okay, I hear you, but being reckless isn't gonna help him, okay? It's gonna get you killed. That's not gonna help him. Let's wait a bit, and try to figure out what's going on, okay?" Desperation was starting to creep into my voice. He must have heard it, because his shoulders slumped, and he turned around with a sigh, helping me up. 

"Fine. But I am coming back for him."

"I know. And I'll help you when we're able to make sure he's safe, okay?" He nodded, then looked down at my foot. I followed his gaze and see it covered in the same purple goop. "Eeuch." I scraped my foot against a rock to get the most of it off, gritting my teeth against the pain, and then we walked back to our houses. Wes helped me over my fence, and before I hopped down I turned to him.

"Remember. Nothing reckless, okay?" He nodded, his face stormy, and then I dropped down, crying out from my foot. 

I took like five showers and threw out my socks and shoes, but I still feel icky. And I can't feel my foot unless I put weight on it, and then it's the same burning pain shooting up my whole leg. I hate this. I called Andy, told her what happened. We've decided that the two of us will meet up tomorrow afternoon. I'll update if anything else happens. Until then, if anyone has any tips to get through this- especially if someone has gone through something similar- please give them to me because I'm beyond freaked out at this point and any help is welcome.
