It’s quarter to five. I sit patiently at my desk, the towering skyscrapers outside my window looming like silent, steel giants. The faint hum of the office AC and the rhythmic tap of keyboards are the only sounds that break the otherwise stifling silence. I work a typical nine-to-five in a small office department. No wife, no kids, and I pay monthly rent on an overpriced apartment- that I can barely call home. 
By every definition, I’m just an average guy. But no one is really average. We're all full of details, oddities, dreams we keep hidden. I've got mine, and I keep them locked tight. I live quietly, but inside, I'm constantly dreaming. Fantasizing. Wanting. Something more. Something else. Each morning, I watch the others arrive-colleagues shuffling in with ghostly faces and automated greetings. Coffee poured, same seats claimed, keyboards clicking in the same dull rhythm. It's like watching mannequins practice being human. The whole thing moves like a machine with no soul. An endless loop. A hamster wheel spinning toward nothing. At 5:15, almost every day, I leave the parking lot. My boss won't release us until 5:07, and even then, there's always small talk and fake goodbyes. But after that, l'm out. A few left turns, a few rights, and I arrive.
The auditorium.
It screams of neglect. Velvet seats ripped and stained, dust thick in the air, as if the place has been holding its breath for years. But to me, this place pulses with possibility. Every broken chair is a relic of the magic that once lived here. This place feels sacred.  

I've been preparing for this moment for months— rehearsing in my mind every night, obsessively chasing perfection. This is it. My shot. My dream.
Since I was seven, l've wanted to be a magician.
It started at my seventh birthday party. My parents hired one.
A real showman. Flashy tricks, booming voice, applause that shook the room. I was mesmerized.
My classmate cheered, laughed, screamed in amazement. In that moment, I knew-this is what I want. That adoration.

And I've never really let go of that dream. Not once. It’s always at the back of my mind. Before bed, in dreams, during lectures and meetings, Commuting to work, l imagined it all. My audience. Their cheers. Their love.
Even if we bury it, even if we fear it, we all crave it: to be something more. To be someone special. For me, it was magic. 

If this goes right tonight, maybe everything will finally make sense. Maybe I'll be fixed.
The lights go down.
Curtain rises.
I step onto the stage and speak into the mic:
"Presenting... Mikey the Magic Man."
I start with the basics. Sleight of hand. Coin vanishes. Cards reappear. They clap, but it's not the right kind. It's too polite. Too soft. Not the kind I need. 

I pivot fast, heart thudding. The saw act. The one from my birthday. The one that made the kids scream in wonder. It's simple. Classic. I've practiced it endlessly. I know every movement.
I begin.
The saw slides cleanly through her pulsing figure. Her body splits, just as planned. The illusion is flawless.
I glance at the crowd, waiting for the applause.
Nothing.
Just silence.
Then-twisting faces. Horror. Eyes wide, mouths open. I see disgust, not amazement. Something's very wrong. 

I turn back to the stage-and I freeze.
She's not moving.
Her body isn't an illusion. It's real. It's wrong. Blood gushes out. Guts tumble onto the stage floor like wet rope. I choke on the deathly smell-sour and metallic.
My stomach turns. My grip looses the saw. It thuds against her chest-right in her still pumping heart.

I stagger back.
Screams erupt.
Chairs crash.  Greasy Popcorn flies. Someone throws a drink. It hits me like carbonated wind. 
The crowd tramples the stage, howling in panic. I raise my hands. I beg. I plead. But the words come out broken. Useless.
I did everything right. Didn't I?

Everything unravels. My mind spins. My chest caves in. Did any of it ever make sense? Or have I always been spiraling, mistaking obsession for purpose? What was once complete, was then incomplete, now completely broken. The revolving door-it never stops. Round and round. Until you step out.
But I can't.
I drop to my knees and scream. The pain bursts out of me, flooding in agony. I claw at my scalp, nails digging into skin, ripping out tufts of hair. The screams become a chorus. I sob until I can't breathe. Until it feels like something inside me splits.
Then I go further.
My fingers dig into my eyes. Bright white and blue. Then red.
Then black.
Next is my skin, peels sliding off of me like a bad sunburn, what was once my face laying on the stage, holes dug in like a rotten fruit. The stark, white bones of my shattered dreams remain on my decrepit body. My mangled skeleton figure is still being trashed by the crowd,No spotlight. No applause. Just the ruin of my dream, shattered and still.
I've reduced myself to nothing.
To nobody. 

8:37 A.M 
Then comes nine.
Same fruitless greetings, same stale coffee, same beat-down desk, same everything. 

I’m back at the hamsters wheel. Running again and again, trying to catch something I never can. 

At 5:07, We’ll be dismissed. 

At 5:15, I’ll leave. 

There may be small talk in the parking lot.

After, I’ll disappear time after time. Just to fail once again. Rinse and Repeat. The revolving door keeps its orbit, and I am still inside.
