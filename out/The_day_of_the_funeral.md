It was the day of one of my best friends funeral. Unfortunately she had passed away in a car accident. I’ll call her B

I was hanging out with a different group of friends who didn’t know her casually before the funereal that day and was invited out to a water park a few hours away for a party. I had to decline due to my later commitments to attend B’s funeral. 

So I went to another friends place for a bit while I waited for my friend (we’ll call M) to pick me up as he was my ride to B’s funeral. I napped for awhile while there but woke in a panic in fear of missing it and I panicked to check my phone for the time and any texts from M. Turns out he was going to meet me here and walk with me to the location instead of driving, weird but okay. 

So I end up going outside and we start to walk to the location. Just casually talking to M I noticed something strange. I looked up in the sky to see what seemed to be a small ball of clouds far enough to where the moon should be in a bright sky. Then the clouds parted away (sorta like the hands on the moon in the film coralline near the end of the movie) and behind it I saw what seemed to be the earth. 

Confused and anxious feelings rushed through every inch of my being and I asked M if he could see what I’m seeing while I pointed to the earth like moon. He laughed as he said “see what?” almost as he knew something I didn’t. I kept asking him more panicked each time and then it got even weirder. 

The colour around us started to change almost as if a lens filter was put over the sun itself and the world almost seemed to melt around us in an array of colour and psychedelic patterning. I looked up at M once more and his eyes started to grow and bulge as of being manipulated by some sort of editing software and his smile growing up the sides of his face like the Cheshire Cat. He started directly at me and all he said was “welcome to the plane of reality”.


“What the fuck”
It was the first time I ever woke up from a dream and actually said something out loud, despite every dream I have being hyper realistic and indistinguishable from reality. This dream felt different though, it felt way to real to just be a dream. It haunted me for the next few hours and I just kept repeating the words “welcome to the plane of reality” and repeating my post awaking exclamation of “what the fuck” after each replay of the dream in my head. 

Thankfully I had to stop myself from thinking about it for awhile because I finished up getting ready and got the call that M had just arrived at my house to pick me up to head to B’s funeral.
