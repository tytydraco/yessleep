The puppeteer had been a professional of the highest grade. Long before things had changed, him and his family had warded homes all across the south. From the mountains to the bayous, at least one in every thousand houses had heard his name. Many had personally requested from him a puppet of the finest make, and those who did not consider his work to be a mere novelty begged of him boons and wardens to protect their homes from evil.

The first misconception was that all things that shied in the presence of his puppets were evil. The second was that the puppets had no souls.

The puppeteer would swish a glass of whisky in one hand, prop himself up with a cane in the other. Every time he worked his magic, whittled a new guardian into being, he’d go to the window and gaze out at the world beyond its frame. “Make not of yourself a fool, child of the earth.” His accent would ring thick, and his posture would cry dourness. “If you ask someone to protect your life with all of their being, you must recognize them too as a life. Else, there’s little they can do for you.”

He was not speaking of himself, but only a fraction of those who sought his miracles understood this. Only a tenth truly took his words to heart, and these wise folk adorned their puppet scarecrows with wood engravings, small jewelry, and slips of heartfelt prayer. As such, when all the world’s most secret doors opened, when all the paths twisted and all the walls were battered and broken, only a handful were truly protected.

The puppets did not need love to come to think. And so, as all the demons, spirits, forgotten enemies and strange neighbors of the lands near and far gathered, they cried out. “Give us strength to save you!” They begged. “Show us just an ounce of love, so that we can get up and be your shields!”

But not many folk did. Many ignored them, and instead of prayers they plastered them with curses. They, too, fell to the label of beast. How can you trust something made from things not meant to live? How can you trust the tools of a man who looks so unlike us, who carries himself like he knows everything? And they burned them. Carved them up, chopped them, defaced them and ruined their beauty before it could bloom.

They did not understand that this made the world only the angrier. That even the beasts that would tear you in two loathed that which had no heart, and the most fiendish of monsters loved discord and degradation. The puppeteer and his great, wide net of family ties all cried out in unison. “We tried to give you wardens, we tried to teach you how to save yourselves. We’ve done it for generations, and we’d meant to do it for more to come. And this is what you do?”

And so it was that they were branded devil worshipers. Accomplices to the devil’s damnation, even long after they’d all forgotten the name of the devil they were accused of giving fealty to. And so it was that-

“Is that why I can’t move?” Asked the puppet.

The old man smacked his lips, took a shot of whiskey. His failing eyes took the puppet in, with their dress of prayer slips, the engraving lines that swirled all across their skin, and the wardrobe’s worth of jewelry that glittered on their person. He walked out to the lobby window, looked out past the frame at the world beyond.

It’d gotten so narrow, in these last years. There was always something watching from the dark between the trees across the road. There was always something skittering in the walls, a whisper on the wind. “Half of it. The other half of it is I can’t remember how to redo the charms.”

The puppet held a sign in its hands. It read: **THE WORLD FOR KNOWLEDGE.** So far, it had failed to be enticing enough. Might’ve been the hotel being ratty, honestly. Wasn’t even a hotel, in the first place, was a motel. No second floor. It had plenty of rooms, but every corner had dust, a third of the other crevices had cobwebs, and the pool constantly had to be shut down because it got too grimey.

“Why not?”

The old man thought for a while, smacked his lips. “Don’t know. Maybe I traded it away, at some point.”

There was silence, for a few minutes. The old man watched the treeline. Counted the eyes. He was expecting a special guest today.

“Will I ever move?”

“Yeah. You will.”

“When?”

“Soon.”

“Okay. I’m glad. I don’t like it when they walk by me and I can’t do anything.”

Something shadowy whispered past the old man and the puppet. Something creaked and groaned. Something shuffled and choked. A soul slithered, a demon walked. A man limped. Not one of them stopped, except to nod or glance. The reception cleared them, the rooms were assigned, and never once did the motel become full.

Only when the old man could no longer see the eyes in the woods, only when he could barely hear the noises passing him by, did someone finally stop. The devil was taller than him by several hand widths, his coat was clean and tatterless. His beard was thick and dark, and his eyes were full of pity.

“Not a single soul?”

“Not one. Maybe you’ve harvested all the good ones already.”

“That is not my responsibility. It never has been my burden.”

“Maybe it’s time for you to try your hand at it.”

The puppet’s sign had been taken down. It now sat in the dumpster behind the motel, having served its purpose. It did not see the puppeteer work, having been turned to face the lobby doors, but it felt his chisel work symbols into its back. It watched the person at the reception desk tremble as they held the phone, slowly put it down and turn away. It heard the puppeteer cry out, felt his hands shake, but when it was turned to face the trees again it did not see him.

It stood on its own legs. It took a step forward, thinking to go find him, but it stopped. Somehow, it was sure it would never find him. Instead, the new master of the motel walked out from the forest, wearing a coat splashed with splotches of red. The devil looked down at the puppet, gave it a name to wear over its old one like a second skin, and took it by the hand. It guided it through the doors, and led it to its very own room.

It had never felt less safe that night than it had dawn and dusk sitting outside the motel. The eyes had never felt more heavy. The skittering in the walls had never been so clear, and the whispers outside the window had never been so loud.

Footsteps pounded, dripped, pittered and wandered down the halls outside its room. None of them were familiar, now. It stayed where it was for hours, until the sun disappeared. Eventually, something with long fingers stuck its nails in the door. It moved them up until it could jiggle the latch. The small metal bar flipped upwards, and the door slowly pulled back.

The puppet no longer knew when it was passed by evil.
