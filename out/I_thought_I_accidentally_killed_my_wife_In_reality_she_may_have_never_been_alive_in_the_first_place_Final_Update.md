*“I was wondering when you were going to show up,”* Maggie remarked. I had prepared myself for anger, but received something else entirely. Her tone was bitter, maybe even apathetic, and the ragged quality of her speech betrayed exhaustion. Overall, though, she came off cool and composed.

She sat at the far end of my grandmother’s vast study, her tall, skeletal frame behind an enormous L-shaped desk. Maggie did not let my arrival became an interruption. As she spoke, her attention bounced between her notepad and the various papers scattered across the desk’s surface. Gave me the impression that, in the grand scheme of things, Maggie perceived me as a negligible source of irritation. An unexpected pothole on the way to work, but not much more than that, and certainly not a threat.

*“Did you bring Camila with you, dear?”* she said, eyes still glued to the rustling documents.

I stood in the doorway, letting her words echo around the cavernous room without a response until they faded into nothingness. My silence was partially a continuation of a previous strategy - empty air seems to extract information from her more often than not. But it wasn’t completely tactical this time around. A lot of energy was being diverted from responding to keeping myself vertical, woozy from blood loss after excising the God Thread from my flesh.

\------------------------------

The operation went as well as could be expected, I think. Honestly, my surgical skills weren’t the problem. The taser was the problem. Body wide muscle spams reconstructed me from living person to meat boulder, despite setting it to deliver the lowest voltage possible. I don’t know how long my petrification lasted, sprawled out awkwardly in the backseat of my car. Don’t feel like the two shots of vodka did much to dilute the experience, neither.

Control returned in tiny increments. First a few fingers, then the whole hand a few minutes later, and so on. When I was finally upright, I examined myself from head to toe, feverishly praying that the electrocution wasn’t a wasted effort.

My left ankle’s concerning new geography confirmed the shock’s usefulness. A thin line of tented skin now wrapped around its curvature, looking like there was a garter snake slithering just under the surface of my skin, progress halted right as it was rounding the corner on its way to my foot.

I took a swig of vodka, applied a smear of antiseptic cream to one side of the parasite, directly above the ball of my ankle, and made my first incision. As I dug through skin, I could feel the God Thread vibrating, but I couldn’t see an iridescent gleam. Pain began to incite frenzy, and my cuts became wild. The more I gave in to the frenzy, the more I could ignore the pain. I wanted the damn thing out of me at any cost.

When the blood loss transitioned from intermittent sprays to a steady ooze, concern broke through my hysteria, and I dropped the knife onto the makeshift surgical field next to me. I had broken something important, apparently. Dabbing away the gore, the source of the leak became clear - the blade had sliced into a vein. I rotated my head around the injury to assess whether it was completely severed or just damaged.

That’s when I saw it - a tiny shimmer from inside the mangled vessel. In retrospect, it makes sense. According to the mining records, God Thread can’t breathe outside of water. If a sliver of it could survive anywhere in a human body, the plumbing system would probably be its best bet.

With a firm hold on the stunned invader, you’d be surprised how easily I slipped it out. When it was all said and done, I pulled half a foot of limp God Thread from the open wound with a pair of dollar store tweezers and dropped it into an open water bottle.

A nearby emergency department patched up the area the best they could in the time I allotted them. When I returned to the car, ready to confront Maggie, there was subtle movement from within the God Thread’s plastic cage. The creature spiraled up and down the container, reawakened. Maybe looking for a new host, I thought.

Which gave me an interesting idea.

\------------------------------

*“Is this how it’s going to be, Jack? You chip my tooth, leave that fucking mess at your apartment for me to clean up, go missing for two weeks, ignore your wife when I send her to find you, and after all that, when you do finally crawl out the goddamned woodwork, you give me the silent treatment?”*

Maggie’s frustration was mounting. It started with her tone changing, syllables now sharp and punctuated. Her breathing then became strained, huffing and puffing with rage.

*A few more seconds, I thought. Don’t say a damn thing.*

The room remained empty, completely void of sound, save her labored breathing and the noise of pen meeting paper. Maggie’s note-taking became more furious until it devolved into maddened scribbling. She violently dragged the tip of the pen up and down the legal pad until it tore through, at which point she threw both of them onto the desk and proceeded to slam her open hands down against the surface. In the time it took for the resulting thump to dissipate, Maggie had steadied her breathing.

At long last, she looked up from her work and met my gaze. Once I knew I had her undivided attention, I spoke.

*“Where’s Camila, Maggie?”*

An explosive sigh poured from my mother’s lungs. She closed her eyes and tilted her head down, using her index finger and thumb to massage the bridge of her nose. After a moment, she chuckled and muttered something I wasn’t able to hear.

*“What did you just say?”*

Another vicious, mocking laugh escaped her lips. It was quieter than the first. Once it fizzled, the room was silent. I inhaled, preparing to ask once more, but before I could vocalize anything, Maggie leaped from her chair, sending it tumbling backward. As it hit the ground, she screamed two simple words.

***“Who’s Camila?”***

The question caught me off guard.

“*No I mean it, Jack, tell me -* ***who*** *is Camila? Or better yet,* ***what*** *is Camila? Are you even asking the right questions? God, it’s like Angie all over again. The whining, and the goddamned melodrama. You’re not seeing the forest through the trees, boy.”*

She moved from around the table and started pacing the length of the study, anchoring herself to its perimeter. In response, I did the same, but in the opposite direction. As Maggie marched towards the entrance, I tread towards the back of the room. It’s like we were both spinning around a central axis, remaining equidistant from each other as we swapped positions.

I knew ignoring the question was a surefire way to amplify her outrage, so I simply repeated myself. The more incensed she was, the more distracted she'd be. For this to work, I needed her distracted.

*“Maggie, tell me where* ***my*** *Camila is, or I swear to God…”*

\*“\****JACK.*** *There is no* ***your*** *Camila. The thing you married was artificial intelligence crammed into the Alloy. It’s not human, it never was human. That was the whole point. You were* ***supposed*** *to bridge the gap. In a sense, you’ve been contractually obligated to bridge the gap. I needed you to conjure some humanity out of that fucking shell.”*

Almost where I was a few minutes ago, she paused her diatribe to knock over an end table. The ceramic lamp it held didn't break when it the ground, but it definitely added to the cacophony, and I think that was her intent.

“*Now, if you’re talking about the* ***version*** *of Camila that you married, that shit is long gone. Has been for weeks, now. Sure as hell went down swinging, turned one of our best security officers into rice pudding splattered all over your apartment. But we smelted down that Alloy, erased the consciousness on its Antihelix, too.*

*“Good riddance, fucking Bon voyage.”*

A lump formed in my throat.

I had my suspicions over the last two weeks. I’ve contemplated the possibility of Camila being truly lost countless times, thought being realistic about it might soften the blow.

When that moment came to pass, however, it didn’t mitigate the pain. Instead, the grief just felt familiar. But the agony of great loss sent shockwaves of blistering heartache through my body all the same.

Maggie observed my anguish, but the time for mincing words was apparently over. She walked forward from the entrance of the study, placing her hands on top of an ornate leather recliner in the middle of the room, stepping over the fallen end table.

*“Don’t let this be Angie all over again, Jack. What you had is replaceable. More than it is for most people. Count yourself among the fortunate.”*

Her voice and her features relaxed, but not out of sympathy or pity. There was an ask coming. I’d agree to whatever negotiations she laid out. I just needed her to turn around first.

I was exactly where I wanted to be. Now, it was all down to luck. I’d either get an opportunity, or I wouldn’t.

*“Credit where credit is due, I’m not sure when ‘your’ Camila slipped a little bit of God Thread inside of me. They can do that, you know. Slip inside you. Painless process, I’ve been told. Like when a leech draws blood. It anesthetizes you, doesn't want its prey to know* it's *been infiltrated."*

*"Hard process to get them out, but it can be done.”*

No kidding.

*“The deception and the coercion certainly ran in opposition to her coding. But when we looked at her Antihelix, you know, her port, it certainly made sense. Don’t know what you did to the thing, Jack, but you really fucked it up."*

Camilla did ram her body pretty vigorously against the closet door as she was escaping from under it that first night.

*"We don’t normally design them with their Antihelixes on the outside, but she was a new model. When the devices are internal, they can be harder to reset. We thought the change had potential, but like everything, it was a double-edged sword.”*

Another callous, hyena's laugh erupted from Maggie.

*“You bypassed our fail-safes, too. We designed the Alloys to deactivate if they break and collapse on themselves; a completed circuit is created when the interior makes contact with itself. Electricity keeps them docile, a fact I’m sure you’re now aware of. Those records don’t prove a goddamn thing, by the way, so don’t consider them leverage.”*

Maggie produced a lighter from her breast pocket, flicked it open, and put a cigarette to her lips.

*“So here’s the conundrum, Jack. Your lovely grandmother, the person who gave me everything, and by extension, gave you everything, had one stipulation about the inheritance.”*

*“Nana wanted her bloodline to pioneer the next step of human evolution. If I don’t make that happen, this all goes away.”*

Plumes of smoke billowed out of her as she raised her hands to showcase material evidence of her current profane wealth. The things she was so deathly afraid of losing. My anxiety rose, but I maintained vigilance. She hadn’t moved towards me, reducing my chances of success, but she hadn’t turned away and given me an opportunity, either.

*“She found the Living Alloy at the perfect time, right as her mining operation started to fail. It was an easy pivot once she found the correct conglomerate to merge with, a biotechnology company based out of Portugal. As her health faltered, however, it became about more than just savvy business decisions. Nana wanted to exist beyond death, spread herself through the gene pool like Ghengis Khan.”*

*“The world is dying, Jack. These bodies aren't doing us much good, not anymore. Not in the face of imminent destruction. We need something more resistant, pliable. Teflon physiology. If humanity can inherit the Alloy’s immortal genetics, an interspecies communion, maybe we can outrun global warming. Live to see the end of time and all that. But of course, this is Nana we’re talking about, so it had to be her ancestry at the forefront of it all.”*

“*Long story short, we own base material, the Alloy, the biotechnology company owns the Antihelix, the device that forces humanity on the Alloy. The artificial uterus, now that’s a joint venture. Personally, I don’t give two shits about any of this. But my inheritance rests on top of a house of cards. The biotech people want their Antihelix back if we can’t produce communion. By order of her will, only Nana’s genetics are even allowed to participate in communion. And you’re the only living male in our bloodline.”*

“*So, before we both run out of time, let me make a proposal.”*

Maggie put out her dying cigarette, carelessly spilling embers onto the floor. Slowly, she turned around, walking to close the study’s doors.

The moment her eyes were not on me, I spun around as quietly as I could, and gently inched a book out of the bottom shelf of the bookcase that stood behind Maggie’s desk, creating a small pocket of space. My hand reached into my coat pocket and produced the water bottle containing a sliver of God Thread, careful not to alert my mother by crinkling the plastic with my grasp. I uncapped the half-filled container, slid it over the book, and nestled it against the wood of the bookshelf. Finally, I pushed the book back in as far as I could, hopeful that its slight bulge wouldn’t raise any eyebrows.

When I flipped back around, Maggie had just closed the doors with a soft thud. When she turned back around, she appeared none the wiser.

Smiling, she offered her terms.

*“I can rebuild your life, Jack. For a time, at least.”*

\------------------------------

Things were never going to work out for me and Camila, that much I knew. But in the end, I was able to give her something she’s never had before, and I am proud of that. A bittersweet, microscopic victory, but a victory none-the-less. I was able to give Camila a choice.

I gave my love some control.

Maggie’s deal was straightforward. Return to my old life, or leave with nothing. She had already orchestrated the details. New identities for me and Camila, a fresh apartment down by the coast. We certainly couldn't return to our previous apartment after the massacre that occurred within its confines.

My wife was already there waiting for me, she said. I believe the exact words Maggie used were:

*“Go home and pretend it’s real, until it is. The more real it becomes, the more time you’ll get with her.”*

*“I’m told the uterus should work now.”*

When I finished the drive out to that new “old life”, Camila was waiting for me on the porch, as radiant as the day I met her. Before I could get too lost in the nostalgia of it all, I told her I’d be right back. Lugging the box of mining logs through the front door, I asked her to meet me in the kitchen. She told me she had questions, and I let her know I had a few answers.

She was reticent at first. Said it didn’t feel right. I implored her to fight through that feeling, letting her know I had her interests at heart.

Camila had difficultly finding words to describe how she felt. The internal conflict was a dynamic one. At times, it seemed like she forgot everything she learned. Reverted to some factory-standard version of herself. Reminding her felt cruel, and certainly hurt like hell to do it, but I knew it was right. After a few reminders, things began to stick, as well. She was an artificial consciousness, constructed from ancient stem cells and superimposed onto liquid metal. Whatever body she manifested, it wasn’t really hers. It belonged to someone else who had been lost to time, their marrow removed and added to the Living Alloy’s collection.

When she seemed ready, I presented our options.

We could follow Maggie’s proposal: live inside this mirage, try to suppress the horrors, maybe even have a kid. It wouldn’t be simple, but I was willing to try.

Or, we could burn it all down.

When Camila asked what I meant, I told her we needed to test something first. I instructed her to focus on Maggie. Imagine she *was* Maggie.

She thought for a moment and then responded.

*“Well…I don’t really need to focus. I already am her, in a way.”*

As I hoped, the God Thread I planted in my mother’s study had located a new host. Found its way into her when she was least expecting it.

I explained that Camila could exert control over Maggie, but only if we broke her modifications, like we did the first time. She could remove her from the equation entirely. If she was disposed of, no one would be looking to detain her, at least not for a while.

If we did that, however, we couldn’t be together. She would revert to her natural form. Camila would lose her consciousness.

I reached for her hand and put it into mine. She contemplated the options well into the night, asking questions here and there, but mostly considering the choices internally. I tried to savor the quiet peace that came with indecision, living in the gray with my wife one last time.

*“I think I want to go home, Jack.”*

As I type this, Camila has already returned to the sea.

It took a few hammer swings to damage the “Antihelix” that was now embedded inside her chest wall. At first, I wasn’t putting enough force behind it. But she pleaded with me, and I grew bolder. My actions weren't heroic, and they didn't rectify the terrors. They were symbolic, though. I let her go, through the impossible pain. It was a testament to something real between us, and that meant the world to me.

Once her features started distorting, I knew it was time to go.

There was a definite irony to Maggie’s choice of relocation for me and Camilla. A self-fulfilling prophecy, perhaps. Right now, from my window, I can see my mother. Marching into the depths, hypnotized by the delicate whispers of the God Thread coursing through her. Camila was calling, and she had no choice but to follow.

*Bon Voyage, Maggie.*

Before I realized what I was doing, I found I had carved the mercury adjacent symbol into the back of my hand with the same knife I used to excise the God Thread from my veins. The physical pain was a welcome distraction, but as I stared at it, certain thoughts started blooming within my skull. Notions as deadly as they were beautiful.

*Maybe one day I’ll follow her call, too.*

*Unify myself with Camilla. Intertwined through God Thread, cradled by the Alloy and its God Mother.*

*I mean, I already have the map.*
