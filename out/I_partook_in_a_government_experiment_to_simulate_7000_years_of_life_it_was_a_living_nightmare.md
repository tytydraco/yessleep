Back in 2023 I was living on the streets, addicted to crack and constantly trying to get money to fuel my addiction, I even tried to kidnap people to sell them.

One day I was approached by 2 men in suits, who offered me a lot of money to participate in a government experiment, they said that I'd be doing the experiment with 3 other people, and that we'd be monitored by an AI who would make sure we were safe

The experiment was to simulate 7,000 years of life to see how an average person would deal with all that time, we were told our memories would be temporarily altered to give us new lives within the simulation, and we could forget about what happened in the simulation at the end if we wanted to, so the four of us went in to do the experiment 

When we went in, we were all neighbors living on a city block, we each had families, except for me, I was living on my own, alone.
I didn't have anyone, I resented the others, I had no memory of my real life during the experiment, so I didn't know the families were fake.

I heard a voice in my head "kill" over and over and over for 3 years straight, until I snapped... I killed the fake families... but was unable to do anything to the other 3 real people, the voice was toying with me, making me feel hatred for those who were given better lives

I was put in a prison for the murders, everyday I heard "kill"

Suddenly I didn't remember anything, I woke up in my bed, thinking it was all a dream.

I went outside, seeing the 3 on their yards with their families, i decided to go to my job in the simulation, when I entered my place of work... everything was off, I was the only one there, the doors and windows suddenly vanished, I was entrapped in a building with no exit, I ran through the seemingly infinite hallways, for what felt like an eternity, hearing the same voice on repeat "kill" that 1 word... what did the voice want from me? I already killed, my victims came back.

I then saw something on the floor, a sharp knife.

"Kill" i heard

"Kill what?!!?" I replied, acknowledging the voice

Nothing.

I came to the conclusion that it wanted me to kill myself, so I put the knife to my throat and I woke up, in that same bed, this time I looked out the window.

The outside was a wasteland, no houses or people for miles, I stepped foot outside, looking around to see nothing, suddenly I felt a sharp sting at my knee, there was this thing wrapping itself around me, it wasn't a tentacle or a snake it looked like a grotesque arm, I tried to get away but it pulled me underground, where I saw the other 3 people, held in cages, all inflicting some kind of torment on them, spikes, fire, gas... it was awful.

I was placed into a cage where my skull was penatrated by a knife over and over and over, the same knife I attempted to take my own life with, for many years straight that's all I felt when suddenly... I woke up, back in the government facility, the memories of my real life coming back to me.

We were told 1 week passed in the real world, we were all traumatized by what happened, we were given our money and escorted back to where each ove us individually lived.

It's been 2 years since this incident, the 1 good thing to come out of it is that I got my life back together and kicked my addiction.

That brings us to today where I'm typing this, I want to share my story with all of you, and to hopefully find those 3 who were in there with me.

I then placed down my phone, only to hear a familiar voice... "kill"
