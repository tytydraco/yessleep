Welcome! We are so glad you decided to pick us for your holiday, now before we can let you run off to have fun we have a few house rules to keep you and all our guests safe and happy! We know it seems long but we promise it is very important you read it all. 

Rule 1 : Bedrooms
Your villa is shared between you and some of our other guests, due to this we ask that you do not under any circumstances enter the bedrooms before 5pm, They are sleeping and they will be very angry if you wake them 

1a:  you may enter your bedroom between 5pm and 12am you must be in your bedroom with the door locked by 12am, we cannot guarantee your safety if you are not, do not make noise, if you cannot sleep then pretend too. You may leave the room at 5am

Rule 2: Common areas of the villa 
Please keep areas like the kitchen, lounge and bathrooms as tidy as you can,  they get very angry if you don't. 

2a: under no circumstances shall you open the fridge, it is not a fridge, it is their meal. Even if you hear screams DO NOT OPEN IT

Rule 3: Alarms
 In the unlikely event that an alarm goes off please pay attention to what it sounds like, this is vitally important for your own safety, also note that alarms will only sound between the hours of 1am and 4am, if you hear an alarm at any other time leave immediately. 

3a siren alarm, If you hear this alarm that means you must evacuate immediately, only exit through the window, NEVER USE THE DOOR

3b high pitch ringing, This is a trick, close your eyes and hide under the blanket, if you haven't locked your door we are sorry but we cannot help you

3c low hum, The other guests have taken a like to you and wish for you to join them, you have two choices, pretend to be asleep and hope you don't make them angry, or join them and become one of them.

Rule 4: Food
Despite the fact your accommodation has a kitchen we don't recommend using it unless you are willing to tidy it spotlessly after, lucky your holiday includes acces to any of our restaurants there are some important steps to follow

4a, when you enter one of our restaurants be sure to give your villa number to the member of staff that is waiting on you, they will repeat it back to you, if they get it wrong politely correct them, if they say anything else stand up and leave and try a different restaurant

4b when your food arrives make sure that it looks exactly like the picture on our menu, our staff are trained to follow these exactly for your own safety, if it doesn't match DO NOT EAT IT, send it back and we will remake it for you, if you eat it we are sorry but we aren't able to stop them from taking you

Rule 5 Swimming
As you know we have a wonderful swimming area included as part of your holiday, for everyones safety please be sure to keep the following in mind

5a Swim attire cannot under any circumstances be the colour red, if you have red attire head to our swim shop and we will happily give you something of a different colour free of charge, Red angers them

5b if for any reason you start to bleed in our pools get out as quickly as you can and find a member of staff, if your blood turns black, we are sorry, they have traded places with you and you will never leave.

5c the cafe in our swim area isn't for you, please do not try to buy anything, the food will not be to your taste. 


Rule 6 Other guests, 
Please be mindful that there are many other guests trying to enjoy their stay, some of them cannot leave and are just trying to have fun, don't stare at anyone, especially if they seem taller than they should, if you anger one of our permanent guests you will end up like them. 

6a ONLY READ IF YOU ARE ONE OF OUR NEW PERMANENT GUESTS. If you become one of our permanent guests, rest assured we will try out best to take care of you and your new needs. The fridge in your assigned villa is free for you to use at any time, if any guest angers you be sure to mark them for us and they will join the fridge to help ease your new found pain, If you enjoy the any specific guest be sure to let us know so we can invite them to join you! We know the thirst is bad but we promise that we will do all that we can to help you cope. 


We hope you enjoy your stay here! Stay safe and have fun!
