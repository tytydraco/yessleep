My dad has a room full of old tapes, cassettes, and antiques. Next to every item is a piece of paper with a number on it. That number can be found in 2 large binders that are on a table beside the wall, describing what the item is. The first item is a composition book. The writing inside is not like my dads, or anyone i know. It is a summary of what happened to someone one night while they were in a park tower. This is what the book says.

I miss her everyday. I have spent so long working that i didn't realize the repetition in my tasks. She would ask about everything i did and i would be so vague. I wish she was here again so I could tell her what it was like. Staring up at the night sky. The fog hiding the trees below. The music on the radio. I should have taken more time off work. I'm so tired. I've been sitting here for so long.

I worked with two other towers at the park. We would call in every hour to make sure we were doing fine. A mandatory mic check. Half past midnight, Tower A wasn't responding. My friend in Tower C said he would go check on them. Which is highly forbidden but he went anyway. I never did hear back from either of them. Eventually the radio made a sound and i jumped over to answer.

"Hello? Tower C?"

Nothing.

"Tower A, this is Tower B, respond."

A slow wheezing voice that dragged its words, like an old man who heavily drank and smoked his whole life replied.  
"Goneeeeee."

"Repeat? Hello? Who are you?"

"A deceiverrrr. Like themmm."

"Okay you can stop fucking with me now. You got me!"

"They will responddddd."

I was going to say something else but then i heard it. The scream of my late spouse, out in the woods below. Far off. Possibly from tower A. I ran through the door that lead to the tower balcony. A place to look down for any hikers or other park rangers. Before i had even grabbed the railing, a voice came through the radio. Her voice.  
"I'm lost, Aaron. Help me."

I turned and walked back to the radio. I sat at my chair, angry. Like this was all a prank.  
"This isn't funny. Tower A? Is this you??" I say with some irritation and worry.

"I think I am trapped here. My soul. How we used to walk these trails together, Aaron. You never were the spiritual type."

I sat there in a stunned silence. I felt the tears gather in my eyes. I didn't have to ask for proof it was her. She gave it herself. She never spoke to anyone besides me about being spiritual. She felt embarrassed by it.  
"Where are you?" I say into the microphone.

"I am in a tower like yours. But it's empty. You showed me those floodlights once. Turn them on so i can find my way back to you. This fog is so dense."

"Your way back? You're dead. You've been dead for so long." I say despite my tightening throat.

"Oh honey, I'm so sorry. I know we can't meet again. But i think my soul can move on if-"  
And her voice stops. I shout into the microphone "Hello? Hello??" before the old mans voice returns.

"What are you doingggg?"

"Who is this?? Put my wife back on!"

"Your wife is not hereee."

"Then who is that?? Who are you?!"

"A deceiverrrr. Like-"  
I shut off the radio and walked back out onto the balcony. I had never shut the door and hadn't noticed the cold air leaking in until just now. I turned on the flood lights. I went back to the radio and turned it back on, to hear her voice mid sentence saying "-it! I see it, Aaron! I'm on my way!" She sounded so relieved. So happy. Before i could answer, the old mans voice returned once again.  
"You are a foool."

I shouted in angered denial.  
"That's my wife! I know it!"

"You know nothinggggg. You will dieeee here."  
Every word he spoke sounded like it hurt him physically. But i heard no grunts of pain.

"Give me a straight answer then! Who are you?? How is my wife here!??"

"Old. Oldddd. We are Oldddd. Your wife is dead. Deaddddd. They lie to youuuu."

"Who lies? If that isn't her why does it sound like her?"

"She was missing. Them found her."

"Them?"

"Them. We. All of us. Ate herrrrr. Screamiiiing."

I was about to turn off the radio before her voice came back through.  
"I see the lights Aaron! I'm so close!"

Without responding i turned off the radio and walked back towards the balcony to see if i could locate her. The voice came back through.  
"Do notttttt open that doorrrrrr."

I spoke to myself as i slowly turned to face the radio.  
"I turned that off."

"It doesss not matter."

From the other side of the room, i could now see something even worse. The radio was not plugged in. It never had been. The confusion had gone on long enough. I didn't need a rational answer. I needed to be ready. "Why are you helping me?"

"I choseeee to."

"That's not my wife is it?"

"Nottttttt your wifeee."

"My wife is dead." I said as if to confirm it to myself instead of actually asking. The voice answered regardless.

"Deaddddd."

"What is that then?"

"Themmm. Weeee. Older than the treesssss."

"How do i stop it."

"You can not. Leaveeeee."

I understood and grabbed my coat. I walked out to the balcony and quickly descended the steps to my ranger car down below. About halfway though i remembered that i left the car keys on top of the radio. I ran back up the stairs, grabbed them and quickly came back down. Before reaching the grass, at the bottom, i saw my car and stopped. The hood illuminated by the moon and shrouded faintly by fog. On the other side of the hood of the car was a head peaking over. On the head were two very small horns. I could only see the head from the eyes up. The skin was pitch black. The eyes were wide and human. It was just crouched behind the car peaking over at me. I stood there, still, as it sat there, still. Despite my terror, i got a hold of myself and turned, running back up the stairs, all the way to the top. I didn't hear it chase after me. I heard no grass move or steps creak aside from my own. I turned as i reached the door, to see behind me.

There at the corner of the stairs just below me, it was peaking around the corner. It's head perfectly horizontal. As if it was tilting its entire body behind the corner of the stairs. It's eyes still wide and human looking, staring at me. My heart raced and i felt it pulsing in my head. I backed up slowly and shut the door behind me, still never hearing it move once. I put my desk in front of the door and blocked off the windows around me. Once again the voice came over the radio.   
"You can not. Leaveeeeee."

"What was that!?"

"Them. Weeee."

"You're one of those things??"

"Yessss. Weeeee."

"What do i do!? How do i kill it?!"

The voice was silent. And before long, my wife's voice came through the radio again.  
"Open the door, Aaron." "Open the door, Aaron." "Open the door, Aaron." Open-"

I took a rubber mallet i had by the door and smashed the radio in two swings. The sound of the metal breaking was hardly over before i could hear her. "Open the door, Aaron."  
She was outside. In my peripherals, i could see through the window on the door that something that was standing there, staring at me. I was about to look before a cheap Walkman beside my radio turned on, the voice grating through the static.  
"Do not."

I refrained from looking at the door. I calmly walked over to the table and sat down. I opened the back of the Walkman and confirmed what i remembered. It had no batteries. Regardless, not even having to press the button to speak, I asked.  
"What do i do?"

"Waitttt."

"For?"

"The Sunnnnnn."

It's 4am. I am still waiting. I'm really hungry and remembered I left my food in the car. No way I can get that. It's still there in my peripherals. It hasn't moved all night. I just have to wait a little longer.

The writing ends there. The other pages are dirty and blank. The last 11 pages of the book are torn out. There are no indents to show anything was written on them. This is the first thing in a room full of items that my dad owns. I do not know where these came from or how he got them. I am not supposed to be in here to begin with. So there's no chance I can ask him. I wish it was longer, but its not.
