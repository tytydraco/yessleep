The day began like any other. I had taken the day off to relax in nature. The forest near my small hometown always had something soothing about it. But on this day, things were about to change.  
  
I wandered through the dense trees, following an old path I had known since my childhood. However, suddenly, I spotted something that caught my attention. At the edge of the forest stood a tower, reaching so high into the sky that it seemed to pierce the treetops. I couldn't believe I had never seen this tower before. My curiosity was piqued, and without much thought, I made my way toward the tower. The closer I got, the stranger it appeared. It seemed to be made of an unknown material, with eerie decorations adorning the masonry. There was no discernible entrance, and the tower looked as though it had stood there for centuries.  
  
My heart raced with excitement and fear as I circled the tower, searching for a possible entrance. Eventually, I found a narrow door barely a meter high, set into the wall. I hesitated for a moment before opening the door and squeezing inside the tower. Darkness enveloped me, and I turned on the flashlight on my smartphone to find my way. The walls of the tower seemed to breathe, and there was a pungent, rotting smell lingering in the air. The air was stifling, and I felt a suffocating tightness around me.  
  
I ascended a narrow spiral staircase inside the tower. With each step, the air grew thicker, and the darkness more intense. I felt as though I was entering a foreign and dangerous world from which there was no turning back. When I finally reached the top of the tower, I was greeted by a scene that overwhelmed my senses. The room was infused with a mysterious energy. In the center of the room was an altar with an ancient book resting upon it. The pages of the book seemed to glow, and I could make out strange characters on them.  
  
Something inside me compelled me to pick up the book and flip through its pages. The words were written in a language I didn't understand, but they resonated in my mind as if they were trying to convey a message. The drawings on the pages seemed to come to life, as if they were awakening. Unwillingly, these strange words began to escape from my mouth, the meaning of which I did not comprehend.  
  
In that moment, overwhelming fear filled me. I sensed that I should never have entered here, that something dark and ancient lay dormant in this tower and was slowly stirring. But before I could flee, I heard a deep, rumbling growl, followed by a blinding flash.  
  
The lightning struck the tower, and the world around me exploded. The ground shook, and the tower crumbled into pieces. I fell to the ground, surrounded by rubble and dust. As I picked myself up, I saw that I was not alone. Another man lay beside me, his face covered in dirt and dust. He too got to his feet and stared at me with wild eyes. Without a word, he jumped to his feet and ran away as if the devil himself were chasing him.  
  
I wanted to chase after him, but my legs failed me. The ground still trembled, and the tower that had just reached into the sky was now a pile of ruins. The earth trembled one final time, and I was thrown to the ground. When I came to, I was in my bed, and my alarm clock was ringing at its usual time of 8 o'clock.  
  
I don't know who that man was, where he went, or where that tower came from, but I hope never to have anything to do with them again. The ruins of the tower have also vanished by now, and I really want to believe that it was all just a dream, but the scratches and broken bones from the fall are unfortunately still there.
