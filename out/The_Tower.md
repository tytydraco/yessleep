Like many people nowadays, I’ve been having trouble sleeping. I’m not sure why, I can’t remember when it started, I just can’t sleep. I lay there staring at my ceiling and let my mind go blank again, and again, and again, but nothing happens. I just can’t do it.



I talked to some friends about it and they suggested those melatonin gummies so I tried those for the first time and there were some….side effects. Instructions read “*Take 2 Gummies 30 minutes before bed.*” So that's what I did, I took 2 gummies 30 minutes before I went to bed, I read a bit of a book, scrolled on my phone and then began my ritual. I laid there staring at my ceiling and that's when things started to change. 



My room went a reddish tint and everything sounded like I was under water, the pressure in my head was skull crushing, I tried to scream or call out for help my voice carried no weight, it literally made no sound. I looked around and started to watch the objects of my room fade away from recognition, everything changing around me becoming fluid, not like water but black and a dark deep red. I heard these deep husky whispers, there were like monks chanting or clearing their throats. I sat up in my bed and swung my legs over the side to stand up but there was no carpet to meet my feet, I fell. 



As I fell, it got darker and darker, everything was still illuminated by this deep red tint but still things became hard to see, I couldn't even distinguish my hand in front of my face from the deep pit swallowing me. As I fell there was a sound, these loud successive bangs. “*Gonk, Gonk, Gonk,”* They were wet in a way, like a thick syrup struggling to stretch its way through an iv. Were they bangs? Thuds? Drums? A heartbeat? I knew all of these sounds but one felt more comfortable than the rest to associate this too, they were footsteps.



When I landed the group was coarse and rough, it felt like glass or maybe little stingers piercing my skin as i laid there on my back. It was cold, so cold I could see my breath escape my mouth and rise. That's when I saw the shadow, this dark looming shadow that glowed a blood red in the distance. I felt like it was watching me, like it was aware of my presence and somehow made me aware that I was not welcome here. It was so tall, hundreds of feet high. It had the design style of a watch tower, black and red bricks exalted the structure into the sky. I sat there staring up at it, there thuds grew louder and deeper. I felt a wave of panic crash into me and I started to cry, I wasn’t sure why or what about but I just cried and cried all the while staring at the tower. And then I woke up.



While the rest of this “dream” sounds insane and any person in their right mind would be freaked out by that ordeal that wasn’t the worst part, no the worst part was waking up and realizing that I was no longer in my bed. No longer in my room. No not even in my fucking house. I was in a park somewhere, houses lined the far left side and the right was occupied by a school. The worst part of this whole thing was that when I woke up I was on my knees which had been scraped and bloodied and I was facing towards two giant towers. It was hard to tell exactly what they looked like because it was dark out still, roughly 4:30 in the morning but they were unmistakable, they loomed in the shadows staring down at me like in the dream. 



I’m scared to try and sleep again, I don’t want to go back to that place or see that tower ever again. If anyone knows what this was or where or literally anything please help me. Needless to say, I won’t be taking melatonin gummies ever again.
