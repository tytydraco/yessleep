I visited my grandpa this summer during holidays. I have never been particularly close to him, but my mom said that it would be good way to detox from the city fumes (my grandpa lives in the countryside). I agreed, since I remember hanging in the lake nearby his house and watching the fireflies at night.

I arrived after a couple of hours travelling by bus, then I walked about ten minutes to my grandpa's house. It was a silent wood house; mom said he used his lifetime savings to built it and now he lives from his retirement money and the earnings from his delivery company.

I said hi to my grandpa, who said I looked much older than he remembered me. I hadn't seen him since I was 12  (I'm 19 now) so I get why he told me that. I went upstairs and started unpacking, since I was going to stay for a couple of  weeks. I noticed that there was a thick, but still a small sized book in my bedside table. It was an old compendium of religious songs and catholic prayers. Out of curiosity, I opened the book and some of the songs and prayers titles were crossed out, and they were some pages ripped away from the book. I always knew my grandpa was a little bit weird, since he had some particular interests, but this felt a little bit disturbing.

Around 9 pm, I walked downstairs in my pajamas and with the book on my hand. I found him reading the newspaper in the kitchen. 

"Hey, grandpa, I was looking at the book that is next to the bed and I wonder, why are some of the titles crossed out?" I asked him. His face changed from relaxed to a worried expression. 

Grandpa closed his eyes and left the newspaper in the table. He took a deep breath and finally talked to me again.

"Follow me to the living room, son".

I didn't realized when I first entered the house, but now I looked carefully at the walls in the living room and there were at least 10 different crucifixes hanging there. I'm not sure if it was because of my grandpa's seriousness but I felt a chill down my spine. 

My grandpa sit on his chair and told me to grab one from the kitchen. I took one and sit in front of him. After a couple seconds, he started talking in a serious and low tone.

"What I am about to tell you, I have only tell it to your mother and your grandma. It is a very delicate story and I don't like to share it so lightly. But I am trusting you because I don't want anything happen to you.

This happened to me when I was 25 years old. My parents had just started the delivery company in our town and I worked there to help the company grow. We started delivering around the town, but some months later I started to deliver some items to 6 or 7 towns a couple of miles around. We didn't have any cars so I did the deliveries on our old horse named Louie. 

One summer evening, my mom told me that the doctor from a nearby town called saying he needed with urgency some medicine, so she asked me if I could go. It was about 11 pm and it was foggy outside, so my dad (who was shortsighted) couldn't do the trip. I accepted, basically because mom promised me that the next day she would took me to the movies. 

I took the medicines and I was leaving the house when my dad stopped me.

'Son, take care please'

'Don't worry dad, it's just fog'

'I'm not talking about that' he said concerned. 'The countryside on the night it's dangerous. We don't know what kind of evil is wandering around'.

I ignored him because I thought the most dangerous thing I could found was a snake or maybe a coyote. Louie was old, but surprisingly fast, so if he saw any danger, he would run until we have escaped of whatever would be in the darkness.

The trip to the town was in a desertic road, only surrounded by the corn plantations and some mountains far away. I ride for almost half an hour and my town lights were non visible anymore. The fog was so thick that the road lights almost didn't illuminate anything. I wasn't particularly scared, but I made sure to look around once in a while to see if any robbers or a savage animal was hiding in the fog. 

Suddenly I found a woman. She was dressed in a long white dress. The long sleeves were dirty and she was barefoot. She looked tired and was walking really slow. I stopped Louie because I though she might need some help. 

'Ma'am, are you all right?' I asked. 

She ignored me at first, but I talked to her again thinking she might have not hear me.

'Do you need a ride?'  

She turned around her head and looked me in the eyes. I swallowed hard while looking at her face. It looked normal, but it was very dirty and he eyes where wide open. Her eyelashes and eyebrows were gone, and her nose had one single drop of dark blood.

It was a summer night but it started to freeze all of a sudden. Louie was very uneasy, with a fast breathing and started pulling his reins. The woman started to aproach with the same unexpressive face, with slow and robotic steps. She didn't looked human.

'I need help' she said in a low and dry voice. 

She touched Louie with her hand right in the neck and started petting him. Louie had stopped moving around, but he was shaking with fear at the moment she touched him. In all my years with that horse I have never seen him like that. 

I was scared, but my dad always said that no matter how someone might look, as good catholics, we always have to help them. I doubted, but I finally decided that I must help her. What if she was attacked and she was in shock? Maybe she had some mental illness and is feeling disoriented. I couldn't help myself and I offered my help.

'I'll take you to the closest town, the people there can help you' I said while lending my hand to her.

'Thanks, young man' she said. She took my hand and it felt like I was touching ice. Her hand was so cold that almost hurt mine. And she was heavy. She looked small and thin, but helping her to ride Louie was almost like lifting a grown man. Louie started walking again, slower because of the extra weight.

She grabbed me by the waist and supported her face in my back. The aura that she emmited was very heavy and hostile, but I tried to ignore this and remind me that we were 5 minutes from the town. I would leave her in the police station and deliver the medicines. Then I would ride back home and everything would be all right.

'Why are you alone so late at night?' the woman interrumpted my thoughts with her voice. But her tone was quite different. It was as spectral as always, but it felt like she had some real interest in me.

'I'm delivering medicines in the town we're going. There are some sick people over there' I said. 

'You're taking the medicines for the ill?' Her question was kinda silly, but her tone changed completely. She was more defiant and hostile.

'Yes... I am doing that'

'Why are you doing that?'

'Because they need this medicines to survive'

'Oh young man, they're already dead' she said in a laught.

There was a silence for a couple of seconds. I could only hear Louie's gallops and the silent laughter of the woman. She was still grabbing my waist, and was squeezing my abdomen more every second.

'Why-Why do you said that?' I stuttered.

'They're dead just as you wil be' she answered.

'I don't understand what do you mean by that'

There was a silence again. I didn't wanted to turn to my back, I was to scared to even make Louie accelerate and to push the lady over even though I wanted to do that. 

Louie started to slow down. I thought he might have stepped on a rock and twisted his ankle so I decided to take a look down. My blood froze in that instant.

'I think you do understand why I am saying what I am saying' she said in an demonic, horrible voice.

Louie's legs were fine, but we were losing speed because there was something slowing us down. Two long, skeletic white legs where hanging from where the woman was sit. The legs had some awful looking cuts and were bleeding a lot. They were so long they touched the ground and were acting like anchors. 

My heart was beating like crazy when she.... no, it started laughing in a demonic voice. Her hands became claws and began to go through my body like small knives. I could feel strings of blood coming out of my belly. Louie was trying to speed up with despair. 

'You know who I am, don't you?' it said right next to my ear. Its breath was horrible, like a sewage leak and rotten eggs. 

Tears started to come out of my eyes in a mixture of pain and fear. I could only start praying the Out Father, to feek protection. The demon laughed so maniacally that I couldn't help to pray louder.

'Don't waste your last breaths in praying, young man, I already knew that!' he spitted at my ear.

I switched prayers to the Holy Mary, the Creed, so many other church songs and nothing worked. The demon was still laughing harder and harder. Its laugh was so noisy, my eardrums started to hurt badly. 

'I already knew that one! I already know them all!' screamed at me every time I said another prayer. Its claws were ripping my skin off my belly and was starting to climb to my chest. Louie was getting tired and his breathing was very agitated. 

'When the horse stops, I will rip you apart and destroy your insides!'

I started crying and screaming. I didn't know what to do. Its long tongue licked my tears with delight. The tongue was rough, like a cat tongue, but it was pointy and was cutting my face as well.

'I will enjoy this, you taste better with all this fear! Hahahah!' 

Then I remembered, my mom and I used to sing a song before sleeping when I was little. She wrote it to teach me to pray at least once a day. I tried to compose myself and started singing, picturing my mom and I singing in the same bed.

My voice was cracking and I couldn't pronounce correctly much of the words, but the demon stopped laughing. I realized this and kept singing faster and with a clear louder voice. The demons claws retracted and left my belly. Louie gained speed and its tongue wasn't in my face anymore.

I finished the song. Louie stopped completely exhausted. I still felt the presence in my back, but it wasn't touching me anymore. Finally it speaked with that horrible voice again, but it didn't laugh or screamed. It sounded defeated.

'All right, young man, you win. I didn't knew that one'.

Then the cold feeling and that evil aura disappeared from the atmosphere. I relaxed my body and put one hand in my belly, trying to cover my bleeding wounds. Louie ran to the town, where I passed out immediately. 

According to my parents, a neighbour who was in the town saw my injures and took me back home, where I slept for 12 hours. The next day when they asked me what have happened to me, I said that an eagle had attacked me. My parents believed me, but I never told them what happened to me or that the song saved my life that night. 

I have this book since that day. I woke up and started to cross all the songs and prayers I said to the demon that night, in order to remember which ones are useless against it if I happen to meet it again".

My grandpa aproached to me and put one hand in my shoulder.

"I know that you're generation are not believers, but try memorizing a couple of the good ones, it might save your life one day" he said and went back to the kitchen.

I sat there, in shock. But I decided to ask an important question. 

"Grandpa wait", he turned around. "But how was the song you sang that night?"

My grandpa smiled at me and said one last thing before going back to the kitchen.

"There's no point on me telling it to you. Now he knows that one too"
