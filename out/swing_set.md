hey everyone! so i’ve been a member of r/nosleep for a long time. i’ve always liked the creativity that people put into their stories because, they are stories. i’ve also always appreciated… of course… the scary parts of every story. but something scary has been happening to me. 

i live in an old house, old town (one of the first settlements in the northwest ordinance, for any history nerds lol) and i’ve always been comfortable with ghosts, spirits, and the other worldly. i have a ghost that lives at my house and we appreciate each other, although it took some warming up. 

i’ve been back home from college and have resorted to smoking on the back patio of my family home. a dozen yards back from my back patio is a public playground. i’ve played there multiple years in my life, i’m not uncomfortable with the scene. i went down the slides and attempted the monkey bars when i was little. i also graffitied and drank on the same activities when i got older. 

anyways. a few days ago i was doing my nightly routine: smoking on the back patio, blissfully looking at the park in front of me. that’s when i noticed the swing set. 

all of the seats weren’t visible. it wasn’t foggy or snowing, quite mild actually. the only thing i could see were chains. in addition to one “form”- because i’m not sure what it is, that looked like a full body and long, skinny legs. i laughed at myself for “tweaking out” and went back inside to go to bed. 

i woke up the next morning at the same location to do my wake and bake. i again, was looking out at the park (especially making sure kids weren’t close) and saw the swing set looked as normal as ever. i brushed it off and continued on with my day. 

i went back to the patio that night. same routine, playing music and enjoying myself. until, i saw the “swing set” again. some weird body and long skinny legs. i changed angles: looking from left to right and low to high. the figure stayed the same. until there was a crash-ish sound at my neighbor’s and i watched it creep across the playground.  slowly creeping its way to the sound. one long leg after another long leg. it was frail, armless, and intelligent. it moved with body and legs- no fast by any means yet still threatening. 

it was evil. it made me feel dread not only on top of fear. wanting to go inside yet not wanting to make any noise; i froze. i watched the thing? figure? swing set? the last thing i want to make is sound. i watched it move one “foot?” after the other to my neighbors. i lost the sight of it and snuck back in. 

that was about a week ago. i’ve been having vivid nightmares about it/whatever it is. yes, the haunted swing set apparently, even i know it all sounds bogus. i end up seeing its “face” until i shake myself back up. i haven’t had nightmares, yet alone dreams in years. i also haven’t seen those neighbors leave their house since; not for work or to visit their family for thanksgiving. 

i know i seem like a dirty p*t smoker but i’ve never experienced this level of unease, dare i say “tweak”, and fear. i haven’t smoked on the patio since. i don’t know what it is, what it wants to do, or whether or not if im just looney. i’ve never encountered something that makes me feel the way that that thing does; fear and evil.
