I became a smoker when I was 16. I stole two cigarettes that my older brother left on the dashboard of our car. In my head, I could blame this on his carelessness. I didn’t even have any reason to start smoking. I just wanted to know what it was like. Curiosity killed the cat and all that.



A week after I had found them, I waited until it was past eleven and the house was asleep. I opened my window and climbed out onto the back roof overlooking the marsh. I used a candle match to light it. Funnily enough, I actually lit the filter instead of the tobacco end, and I sat there wondering what all the buzz was about. It tasted vaguely burnt, and I couldn't even blow out the smoke like I’d seen in movies. I stubbed it onto the windowsill and chucked it into the marsh, too scared of my parents' wrath to try and dispose of it any other way. 



I watched the orange spark still left on the end of it disappear into the long grass until the darkness enveloped it. Of course, now I know I was being careless, but back then I was too self-absorbed to think about the animals or the possibility of a wildfire. All I really cared about was not getting in trouble.



The second cigarette I’d ever smoked, I smoked it properly. It was broken in half with the tail hanging off, so I broke off the end of it and lit the paper still left. The filter was in my mouth this time, and I suddenly got why my entire family risked lung cancer every day. I held it between my two fingers and felt so unbelievably cool when I released the smoke in my mouth. The vague burning was more of an ash this time, stuck on my teeth and the back of my throat. I cannot explain what was so pleasant about it. As I’m sure any smoker could tell you, you don’t know why they do it until you’ve done it. I stubbed it shortly thereafter, since there wasn’t much paper to burn. But the damage was done, and I was hooked. I knew when I chucked it into the marsh grass that it would not be the last time, and that fact settled over me with a finality I accepted quickly. 



I brushed my teeth thoroughly after every smoke break. It started just at night, and then in the evenings after school when I knew my mother would be cooking dinner. Anytime I was stressed, I needed a cigarette. I craved the burn at the back of my throat. I wouldn’t say I was fully addicted at that point, since I was limited in my supply. I would be able to steal one or two a week, and even when I eventually started buying them off kids at school, I was too lazy to get a job and could only afford a pack once a month. 



Even as my habits changed, the place I smoked them never did. I still sat perched on my rooftop, feet dangling over the edge, and when I was done I would chuck them as far as I could into the marsh grass. It became a game in my head, if I could get farther than the last one. How long I could still see the ash in the dim sky. 



Once, at two or three AM, I was splayed out over the roof on my back. The cigarette between my fingers was almost finished and when I held it in the air to blow out, it fell directly on my face. I cursed and sat up, twisting it into the roof in frustration. But, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something in the marsh. I spun my head around and saw the dark figure of a tall man. His silhouette was odd and unnerving, body too skinny to hold a head that large. He stared at me, arms at his side. I nearly fell off the roof. I used the heels of my boots to push myself up and grabbed the window sill. I shut my eyes tight as I climbed back through and plopped down on my bed. I whipped around to shut and lock my window. I snuck a peak out of the blinds but he was gone. I’ve never been sure if I actually saw something out there. I was tired, and unless he laid himself down in the wet mud or gained superspeed, I couldn’t figure out how he’d gotten out of my sight within that minute. It frightened me out of smoking for all of a week, and then I was back to my old habits. Except now, I smoked in the park. My window remained locked until I moved out. I still thought I saw him out of the corner of my eye sometimes, but I was also always known to be paranoid.



I’m 28 now. I quit smoking last year when I got pregnant with my daughter. My husband and I are living in an apartment a long way from my childhood home. We’re on the final floor, high in the air with no balconies or ledges for my daughter to sneak out of when she’s older. Quitting smoking was one of the best decisions of my life. I have more money in my pocket to spend on my little girl. My anxiety has almost entirely ceased.



Last week, I burnt dinner. It wasn’t a big deal, but the kitchen stunk. I decided to slide open a window to let some air in. 



I dropped the glass of water I was holding. It shattered on the floor. My husband ran over and found me confused, a hand up to my open mouth.



On the window sill, 400 feet in the air, was a mound of burnt cigarettes. Long pieces of grass were poking out of it, covered in mud.
