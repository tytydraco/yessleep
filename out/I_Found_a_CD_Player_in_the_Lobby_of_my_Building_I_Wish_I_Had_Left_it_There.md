About a month ago, I spent my first full weekend alone in my new apartment. With no friends in my new city, I was staring down the barrel of an uneventful Saturday night. Whatever, I planned a comfy (admittedly cliche) night in, featuring a glass of wine and a bubble bath.

For some context: I had recently come across a few old CDs while sorting through mountains of shit for the move. The time capsule-esque nature of these CDs had put me in a nostalgic mood, and I yearned for a taste of something familiar. That said, I hadn’t been able to listen to the CDs themselves. Until that night.

It was as if I manifested it. An old CD player and wired set of headphones appeared in the lobby of my building with a simple handwritten sticky note that read: Enjoy :)

So there I am: bath brimming with suds, pinot noir in hand, and a CD player eager to please.

I decided to start with Dido’s masterpiece: Life for Rent. The first track is “White Flag.” The quiet synth and strings pour into my ears and instantly I’m transported to my childhood home circa 2004. My parents cuddle on the couch as I perform a sloppy but well-rehearsed dance with the sticky neighbor boy.

I was really revelling in this memory when I hit the final chorus. Behind the gorgeous backtrack, I heard a faint sound, almost like a woman screaming. Not a yelp like a neighbor opened a kitchen cabinet and every Tupperware she’d ever owned tumbled onto the floor. More like said theoretical neighbor was having her entrails torn from her body slowly, thoroughly.

I yanked the headphones off, rightfully startled, but in that moment the shrieking ceased. I held perfectly still for maybe 30 seconds and shut my eyes to really listen, but sure enough I couldn’t hear anything beyond the faucet dripping and the quiet wash of traffic outside. Weird.

Now, this threw me off a bit, but we’ve all experienced something like this at one point.

That said, Dido suddenly seemed a bit less soothing. Determined to push ahead with my idyllic evening, I grabbed for a new disc, No Doubt’s Tragic Kingdom. Track 1: “Spiderwebs.”

The drums welcomed me with well-worn arms and I’m suddenly down the shore with my family. My hair is stiff with salt and my mom passes around coldcut sandwiches, slightly gooey and damp from baking in the sun.

I always found Gwen Steffani’s voice compelling in a nearly uncanny way, with shotgun-quick vibrato and a shrill, whiny timbre. That’s what I kind of like about it, though.

I was pulled from my artsy-fartsy reverie with a similar discordant screech.

Was this CD scratched? I pressed the headphones tight to my ears and listened intently. A warbled, wordless tone cut through the melody. It made me feel… naked.

I briskly ejected the CD and toweled off, quite sobered despite the red wine.

I made my way into the living room in a fluffy robe and hair twisted up in a towel, clinging to my attempt at a cozy little evening.

I had one more CD, Etta James’ At Last. What the hell, I thought. I poured another glass of wine nearly to the brim and skipped to the second song: “My Dearest Darling.”

I settled into the couch and lit a candle as Etta’s voice meandered into the coils of my brain. I sang along quietly to her pleading love song, but this version sounded a bit different than I remembered.

She sang how I felt at that point, out of breath, shaky, a bit panicked. That was very strange. She then… stopped. Etta went dead silent as the backtrack played on dreamily.

What the hell was happening? I clicked the volume up a notch.

I quickly regretted that, as (I swear to god) Etta James let out the most chilling wail I had ever heard. It sounded as if her spine was being torn from her body, her skin removed, her skull wrenched open.

Her howls evolved into something nearly animal. The auditory equivalent of agony itself.

I was rooted to the couch, unable even to free myself from the hellish symphony of suffering.

I was at last ripped back to reality by frantic banging on the front door. It was only then that I was aware of my own distressed squealing. I don’t know how long I had been frozen there, screaming at the top of my lungs.

I flew to the door and swung it open, throwing the CD player clean across the room.

A hulking figure took up the majority of the door frame. A new neighbor I had not yet officially met. He gawked at me through glassy, yellowed eyes.

“Are you okay?” he demanded.

My throat was caked with the taste of fear. My first attempt to speak was unsuccessful. My second yielded only a childish “I dunno.”

The towering man pushed past me into my apartment. He hunted around, looking for something… or someone. He moved in a jilted manner, like his joints were in dire need of lubrication. I’d seen him once or twice before, fumbling with his keys or lugging garbage down into the basement. He seemed odd, but harmless.

I only then realized that a strange man was in my apartment, but somehow even this character’s peculiar presence comforted me in that moment.

After satisfying himself that no danger lurked in the shadows, he tracked back to me with a shrug.

We exchanged names, I thanked him and apologized for the ruckus. When he moved for the door, I blocked his path.

“Wait. Could you please check one more thing for me?” I pleaded.

I collected the strewn CD player and straightened out the wires. It was still playing, now on track 3, “Trust in Me.” Usually a favorite of mine, now a reason for great concern.

He was a man of few words, and took it without a second thought.

We stood in silence for 30 seconds, maybe a minute tops.

In that short amount of time, that sickly sense of carnal alarm returned to me, palms slick, guts twisting.

I examined him more closely. He turned the song up, and I could hear the frenzied torment from where I stood. He swayed with a serene smirk on his face. I became aware of his scent, cloyingly sweet with something distressingly acrid underneath.

I took a step back towards the door, but this movement snapped him out of his trance. With the headphones still on, he regarded me with a wet, gummy smile.

“Not quite the real thing, but close enough to scratch that itch.” he mused, petting the CD player like a prized pet.

I giggled politely as I cracked the front door open and stepped aside, hoping he’d get the message. He remained where he stood, deep in thought, still fingering the small silver machine.

He licked the dab of foam that had collected at the corner of his lips. “I hope you don’t mind me asking, I don’t mean to be rude… Do you mind if I take it back?”

So that’s where the CD player came from.

I could only muster a baffled nod. He actually kissed the cursed thing before stepping out into the hall.

“Oh, your CD-”

“Keep it. Please.” I interrupted.

He bowed appreciatively. “Feel free to stop by. I’m more than happy to share.”

I closed the door and slid to the floor, spent.

I haven’t seen my neighbor since, but I can always hear those tinny, appalling melodies seeping through the paper-thin wall we share. I just hope they’re enough to keep him satisfied.
