When we hear the word *community*, what comes to mind? For many, it's the warmth of togetherness, the quiet strength of helping one another, the joy of shared laughter and burdens. Whatever form it takes, to me, community is a beautiful bond woven from kindness and connection. And I cherish it deeply.

Just like what we did, four years ago:

I walked through the sweet grassy smell of Bob’s front yard. The scent of his cooking already burst through his open window. Bob greeted me with a grin and a stained apron, taking me inside where the table was already set with dishes. I brought carrots, cabbages, and tomatoes and put them on his table. Known for his unmatched skills in the kitchen despite losing one eye, Bob had once again transformed simple ingredients into a feast.

As we sat and tasted a bit of the stew I leaned, "Mmmm, better than mama's cooking." I joked and Bob chuckled, sprinkling a bit more pepper into the pot.

"Well, the king deserves the best. Tonight, we feed him like family.”

Jackie Brando was this guy we crowned as our king 5 years ago. He had short curly hair that with a receding hairline. He had a set of yellowed, crooked teeth that had clearly seen better days, or none at all. Though 67 years old he looked 40, an ugly 40 that is.

“I bought this ring for him,” I said softly, cradling the small box in my palm like it was something delicate and sacred. “It’s just a fake diamond, but… I think it’s charming in its own way.”

Bob leaned in and studied it, his brow furrowing with the kind of concern only a close friend can wear. “Yeah, give that to him. But bring something else too, something extravagant. That alone won’t do. Surprise him. Make it unforgettable.”

I bit my lower lip and frowned like that of a child who was told by his mom not to play outside, "Ok, maybe Leah can help me."

Leah was the beautiful woman with a sharp black bob cut and pale skin. She lived just five houses away from mine. 

Leah observed the ring I bought. She opened a tiny brown jewelry box and showed me an emerald ring.

"This is cheap too but I think he's gonna love it more than that haha, no offense. Give both rings to him."

"Thank you. But does it have a sentimental value to you?"

"No it doesn't, just one of my many cheap collections. Take it."

The day of offering had arrived. We stepped through the bronze gates of the old museum, its walls blanketed with the blackness of age, the scent of dust clinging to the air. There sat our King Jackie upon a modern throne that had soft cushion, absurdly out of place in the old-fashioned museum.

Before him stretched a long table. Layed on it were various luxurious offerings - exotic fruits, intricately carved jewels, feathered artifacts, gold-gilded pastries, and fine silks. King Jackie was dressed in black tuxedo. Some gifts can be seen wasted on the floor, these were the rejected ones. He would throw them away when they displeased him.

"Your majesty," I said with a deep bow, "please accept my humble tokens. You look radiant as ever." My voice quivered slightly. I placed the two small ring boxes before him. His eyes hovered over them, but he did not yet react.

I backed away in silence. Leah was waiting for me outside, near the crumbling statue of a forgotten general. Her eyes flickering toward the line of people behind us - five, maybe six trembling souls hoping for their gifts to be accepted.

The next morning, the whole town bustled with another event - the special Spa Day, all for him. Florists stripped entire gardens to gather the freshest flowers - jasmine, lotus, various-colored roses, and perfumers soaked the air with lavender and fragrant oil. The simple bathhouse was transformed into a royal pool, every tile scrubbed until it gleamed like mirrors.

At last, King Jackie appeared draped in purple robe. He moved with a lazy sort of cruelty.

Naomi, an old woman, poured hot water and flower petals into the tub. As she bowed to offer her service, King Jackie, without a flicker of warning, lashed out a foot and kicked her viciously across the stone floor.

The sound echoed - flesh, bone, and gasps from the crowd.

Naomi groaned, blood trickled down her lips. Two attendants rushed to her, lifting her gently. Her head lolled back, and despite the pain, she smiled. She's now missing a front tooth.

"That was a strong kick, your majesty. I applaud your great strength and good health." She complimented and walked away in pain.

King Jackie let out a breathy laugh. He then relaxed his body and closed his eyes in peace like nothing happened.

Bob approached the steaming tub with cautious steps holding a cherry drink. “For you, your majesty,” he murmured, bowing low as he extended the drink. But the king barely glanced at him, he took the drink and shooed him away like a dog.

Moments later King Jackie emerged from the bath wearing shimmering silver trunks. He glanced at a young woman nearby and winked at her. The woman smiled back but you can clearly see from her eyes that she was uncomfortable.

A group of women surrounded him with brushes, cloths, nail clippers, and other tools for grooming. They tended to his feet - scrubbing, trimming, and softening. All while being fed berries and cakes.

After the indulgence they dressed him up ready to go. He saw a mother holding her baby and he took away the baby's lollipop. The baby cried. The mother rocked her child gently and hushed him. Leah noticed the commotion and approached the baby. She gave him a candy and the mother thanked her.

One morning, as I stretched my body, I smelled and felt the irritating dust on my bed. I remembered I haven't clean my room for almost a month. I stretched my body and wetted some cloths and brought a pail of water in my room. I wiped the table, displays, and some parts of my bed.

And then I saw it again, under my bed, the photo of my deceased daughter. I held it in my arms and chest. I sobbed and breathed deeply as I picture her glowing face. But I quickly came back to my senses and composed myself.

I wiped my tears forcefully. I shouldn't let my grief distract me from making our king happy.

*“Bam! Bam!”*
Once again, King Jackie was at it - hammering the gong with his usual enthusiasm. I stepped out to witness it like I always did.

There he stood - barefoot on the cracked stone platform and gripping the great mallet with both hands. He was bouncing erratically like a crazy monkey while hitting the gong. His eyes were wide with glee. His mouth stretched into a wild grin that revealed his gross teeth as he pummeled the gong faster and faster.

The crowd arrived. They began to dance in the most ridiculous of manners, limbs flopping, backs twisting, eyes rolled in weird ecstasy. Some clung to partners and others twirled alone.

Among them was Naomi, with her creepy movements. Her body swayed like a willow in a storm, but her head remained hauntingly still, her unsettling grin stretched across her face like a mask carved into flesh. She made sure to catch the gaze of onlookers, making them feel creeped out.

King Jackie, ever the grotesque monster, suddenly bent down with a giggle. With a slow, lewd gesture, he licked the bottom rim of the gong, dragging his tongue upward across its surface. The crowd only shrieked and danced faster. Their movements became violent, as if possessed by some wild spirit.

He hit it again. And again. Louder. Harder. He watched with the joy of a mad god. He enjoyed every second of it. He did this every day.

One Wednesday morning the king requested a road trip. And no, not by a car, but by a litter carriage. This is the carriage being used by royals and emperors where they just sit or lay in a small wooden shelter attached to long sticks and it will be carried by four men on their shoulders.

Four strong men were required to bear the weight of the litter but twelve brave men volunteered. They would take turns.

But that's not all. The king proclaimed that every townspeople must join the journey not as mere spectators but as part of this parade. All were to march for three long kilometers under the scorching sun.

We came upon the river. There was no bridge, no huge rocks, we have to endure the cold and unknown deepness of the river. Surely the king didn't mind. He didn't care if the carriers will drown. If ever they will drown, he'll just have to be step on our heads and shoulders to cross.

One by one, we waded in. Children were lifted high upon shoulders. The elderly were carried wrapped in cloth and cradled like the precious surviving relics of the beautiful peaceful era -  before this cruel king was born.

Leah stood frozen, her body stiff, her breath shallow. Her eyes wide with dread, refused to meet the water. "I can’t," she murmured. And then, in a sudden motion, she pressed her face against my shoulder - hiding from the sight as if the water itself bore some ancient terror. Her hands clutched at my sleeve, her sobs came soft and desperate. I held her close and stepped forward.

After the trip we took a rest on the grassy field, our bodies heavy with exhaustion. We lay scattered across the field, speaking in hushed tones, letting the wind carry our secrets.

Bob gazed at everyone and showed a worried expression. He broke the calm.

"Last night, I couldn’t sleep, so I went out for some air. That’s when I saw him."

We turned to him, curious.

"The king," he whispered, "naked... by the gong."

A silence fell.

"We know he always lick the gong but this one..." He shook his head and his brow furrowed.

"This one felt stranger than usual. He was naked. He licked the gong slower, more careful, more gentle, like it was part of some sacred ritual only he understood. And then he danced."

I gulped. The others were stunned.

Bob's voice trembled, not from fear, but from disbelief. "It wasn’t just dancing. It was wild. Rhythmic. Like the madness of a man possessed. He shook his entire body violently with his tongue out. And then he rubbed the gong with his torso. And all the while, he kept licking the gong like it was his altar."

I turned to Bob, hoping to lighten the air and said, “For a one-eyed man, you do see things so vividly. I’m almost jealous.”

Bob let out a chuckle and I followed with one of my own. But it was more like nervous laughter.

Even as we laughed, the image lingered raw and grotesque in my mind. I tried to shake it off.

The following morning, Leah and I laid out a modest picnic beneath the acacia tree in my backyard. The weather was warm and soothing, the kind that makes you want to daydream. We nibbled on sandwiches and sipped tea as the conversation wandered gently from one topic to another - our families, our pasts, the things we missed and the things we tried not to.

When I spoke of my daughter my voice began to tremble. The memories were still sharp. Tears welled up and slipped down my cheeks. Leah reached out, wiped them away with the back of her hand, and met my gaze with such calm intensity. Her eyes said everything - understanding, quiet strength, and something close to sorrow.

"Hey, it's gonna be over soon. Tomorrow is the day we've been waiting for so let's prepare. Ok?" She smiled and we hugged.

The day finally arrived.

The day I’ve longed for, and ached for, has finally arrived. My chest feels like a drum beaten by thunder itself, each heartbeat was like a guardian angel's nod and smile.

Everyone gathered in the abandoned museum. We worked together to move the wooden objects and furnitures aside to create a huge space in the center. A tense hush settled over us. Then came the creaking sound of the door. King Jackie stepped inside. But this time, no one was cheering.

He sat in his favorite throne as usual. A flicker of awareness was shown in the king's eyes. He stared at everyone and probably noticed the changed atmosphere. The warmth that once greeted him was now replaced with cold silence.

Bob arrived carrying a steaming bowl of stew. The king held the spoon, quietly observing the stew, and took a scoop. He took a sip of the stew and gagged, his face twisted in horror. He gagged violently, coughing as he clutched his throat. He then doubled over and vomited.

"This stew is spoiled!" His voice echoed through the hall. Bob stepped forward.

"You’re lucky I didn’t scoop out my other eyeball and serve it to you, you stinky goblin!"

King Jackie once got angry at Bob for accidentally spilling soup on his shirt few years ago. The king was so angry he plucked Bob's eye out and fed it to his dogs.

The king looked at everyone completely confused. A sudden outrage from many were heard all over the place.

*"Remember when you threw my dog in the river?"*

*"Remember when you ruined our wedding?"*

*"Remember when you cut my finger?"*

All the burdens and outcries of the crowd, they let it all out. They made sure he can hear every single one of them.

Leah stepped forward, her eyes burned with fury. She approached him holding a baseball bat and struck him across the face. Blood came out of his nose. He stumbled back, eyes wide with disbelief.

"That's for drowning my son!"

Leah's raspy voice was full of rage she's been trying so hard to hide. I've never seen her cry and shout. I took a deep breath, I want my turn.

"I will never forgive you for choking my daughter to death!! And... and..."

I looked at Leah for her approval. She smiled and nodded.

"And for r*ping my wife in front of me before killing her!!"

The crowd erupted in fury. Rotten eggs soared through the air, followed by clumps of foul-smelling garbage and handful of sticky mud. The onslaught came from every direction, relentless and merciless.

He raised his arms in an attempt to shield himself. Muck clung to his hair and face, the stench unbearable. Overwhelmed and humiliated, he collapsed to his knees crying.

"Boo-hoo, look at this oversized baby." Mocked Naomi, her hands on her hips.

King Jackie stared at her with puppy eyes. His mouth shaking in shock and distress. Blood and dirt trickled down his face.

"Y-you." He said, pointing at her. His finger shaking. "You said if I lick the gong and hit it I will hypnotize..."

The crowd roared with laughter. Naomi laughed like a witch. One guy was slapping his knee and the other guy wiggled his tongue and licked the air, mocking the way he licked the gong. The realization hit him like how he hit the gong. He got tricked by the entire town. He's now a laughing stock.

The moment the police came, it felt like the sky finally cracked open. After five long years of not reporting his crimes - of bowing to him like he was royalty - it was all worth it. Knowing how much we took care of him we're sure prison would feel like hell.

As they dragged him away, the crowd jeered and hurled trash. His tear-streaked face, red with shame and disbelief, twisted as if the world had turned on him. He wept loud pathetic sobs and a line of snot dripped down his nose. He looked back at us, eyes pleading, searching for sympathy that didn't really exist.

That was four years ago. Leah and I are married now, with two kids who sleep soundly at night. Someone showed me a photo of Jackie behind bars - bony hand clutching a tin plate of beans, his hair grew long in the back but the top was balding. His eyes were raw, swollen, broken, like he's been crying every single day. I looked at that face and felt nothing. He’s hopeless.

We’re safe, I hope.
