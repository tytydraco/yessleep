TW: Gore

Every morning, around 8:06, I sneeze for the first time. I take a minute to recover, then I sneeze again at 8:07. This has happened every day for a couple months now, and doesn’t change no matter what antihistamines I take, what room I’m in, or what laundry detergent I use. It’s gotten to the point where my coworkers have a bet to see who can race across the building and give me a tissue first. (They have to hand it to me between the first and second sneeze, or else it doesn’t count.)

This morning is different though. I hide in a metal locker, desperately pinching my nose shut as the clock ticks closer to 8:06. Red lights filter through the vent holes intermittently, and fire alarms blare overhead. An indifferent, robotic intercom communicates evacuation instructions that I can’t hear over the shouting just outside my locker.

“Tell me where he is!” I can just see through the vent, a man holding one of my coworkers by her collar. It looks like he’s speaking so close to her face and so forcefully that she probably feels a rain of spit across her nose.

“I don’t know where he is!” I hear shoe scuffling—she’s trying to pull away from him, but he’s too strong. 

This woman--our company's only intern--was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I’d been watching her rush around the room, pushing on doors but finding the exits all locked. If he hadn’t had a key card to get in, she would've been safe... 

“I swear! He’s not here! Just let me go—”

He grabs her neck, and I slam my eyes shut. A hard thump, the vibration of which I feel in the floor, interrupts her pleading. I wait in dreadful silence, hoping that she gets up. But all I hear is his footsteps away from me as the insides of my nostrils start to sting.

*Oh no.* I open my eyes just enough to see my watch ticking: 8:05:57, 58, 59…

My sneeze reverberates through the locker, echoing painfully in my ears. I freeze, horrified as the big man’s footsteps stop. I clamp my hand down over my mouth, foolishly hoping that he won't be able to pinpoint the source of the sound if I remain entirely silent.

He reaches the locker I'm in and tries the door. I put all my weight into holding it shut. He tugs again, and I dig my fingers into the narrow vent holes, metal digging into my damp, sweaty skin. 

He pulls again, and my shoes skid against the metallic floor of the locker. I tumble out into him, and he pushes me against another locker.

"Well, there you are," he lears at me as I struggle against him. "I didn't think you could fit in there."

"Please," I say, "I don't know what you want! Just let me go!"

"I've got something just for you." He holds me up with one fist, clenched painfully around my necktie, and reaches into his back pocket for something.

Something warm and wet splatters against my face before he can retrieve it. His eyes bulge from his head, and blood spouts from his jugular. His grip on me slackens. When he finally falls over, I see the intern standing behind him. Blood trickles from her forhead, but that doesn't explain all of the dark red splatters along her blouse. Red shoe prints trail behind her, and the knife that she used to kill my assailant is chipped and bent. Dried blood is encrusted on the handle.

Before I can ask what the hell is happening, she yanks my hand towards her. She places a neatly folded, white tissue into my palm. The only thing that mars the tissue's surface is a bloody fingerprint.

"I did it," she says, voice shaky. Her pupils are two different sizes, and she stands lopsidedly. Her voice quakes, but she smiles proudly up at me. "I handed you the tissue first."

I don't sneeze at 8:07.
