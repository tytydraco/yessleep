Hey, everyone. This story took place just a few weeks ago, and it's been gnawing at my mind ever since. It's not some wild exaggeration, just a strange and unsettling encounter that I can't quite explain.  
  
It all started on a typical night. I was alone at home, engrossed in my laptop, with my parents visiting my grandparents out of town. The house was unusually quiet, but that didn't bother me. Our neighborhood was known for its safety, so being alone didn't raise any red flags.  
  
Around midnight, though, things took an unexpected turn. A knock echoed through the house, and I was puzzled. Who could be at the door at such a late hour? My heart began to race, and I cautiously descended the stairs, intent on discovering who was there.  
  
I peered through the peephole and was met with a perplexing sight. A man, perhaps in his forties, stood on my doorstep. His hair was a disheveled mess, and his eyes held an eerie, haunted look. Despite the chilly night, he wore only a ragged jacket and trembled uncontrollably.  
  
I hesitated, naturally wary of the late-night visitor. Still, something in his demeanor struck me as genuine desperation. After a moment's contemplation, I cautiously unlocked the chain and allowed him inside. I handed him a warm blanket and a cup of hot water, keeping a small knife close, just in case.  
  
As he began to warm up, his speech gradually cleared. Yet, what he spoke remained utterly incomprehensible. It was like a language I had never heard before, a series of strange syllables and intonations. Among his gibberish, one phrase persisted: "The door between worlds is closing."  
  
I attempted to glean some information from him, asking who he was or how he had ended up at my doorstep. However, he either couldn't or wouldn't provide coherent answers. The whole situation grew increasingly unsettling.  
  
But then came the twist, the part that still keeps me awake at night. As he continued to warm up and feel more at ease, he began to act as though he had lived in my house for years. He navigated through the rooms with eerie familiarity, recalling the layout, the names of pets from my childhood, and even mentioning family events that I had never shared online. It was as if he had accessed my most personal memories.  
  
Overwhelmed by fear and confusion, I somehow convinced him to leave. He departed, still muttering that unsettling phrase about the closing door between worlds. I locked every door and window afterward, my mind racing with unanswered questions.  
  
Since that night, I haven't encountered the man again, but I remain haunted by the bizarre experience. I can't comprehend who he was or what he wanted. His presence in my home and his inexplicable knowledge of my life continue to send shivers down my spine. If any of you have had a similar encounter or understand the meaning behind that phrase, please, I'm eager to hear your thoughts.
