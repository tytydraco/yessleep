Hello, my name is Billy , I don’t know if I should even be posting this here, but I feel like I need to get all of this off my chest . 
  

  
 From a very young age I had always wanted to become a mountain climber , the stories my parents shared with me never failed to fascinate me and I wanted to be able to achieve what they had in their youth .
  

  
I started training from a young age and  I climbed my first mountain when I was 18 years old and fresh out of highschool . The climb had been rough , so many rocks and branches to grab on, and not only that but also the amount of time it took to reach the top , 6 hours …
  

  
But once I reached the top , I realized it had all been worth it . Being able to see the world below me and the feeling of  almost reaching  for the clouds was just  incredible . I stayed there for a bit just admiring the view until I heard someone else making their way up the mountain. 
  

  
“Hey , do you need some help ?” I asked 
  

  
“O it’s ok don’t worry , I think I’ve got it .” He said as he pulled himself up . He extended his hand towards me and said “ Hey , I’m Bryan , nice to meet you ” 
  

  
“I’m Billy ” , I extended my hand and he shook it 
  

  
“Nice to meet ya Bill , this your first time climbing a mountain ?” 
  

  
“It actually is ,  how’d you figure ?” 
  

  
“Well  you do seem quite young and I thought that maybe you haven't had the chance of climbing so many mountains , but I mean all the more credit to you for making it this high up all alone. This mountain isn’t the easiest for beginners .” 
  

  
I smiled , “Well , thanks for that  , it’s quite difficult but that view makes it completely worth it” 
  

  
“O yeah , you bet it does !”
  

  
That day , Bryan became my closest friend …
  

  
We had exchanged phone numbers and from that day forward all the mountains I climbed , were with him by my side  . He was very experienced ,  and just having him around made me feel safe . I learned a lot from him and if it wasn’t for him I don’t think I would’ve been able to climb as many mountains as I did over the years. 
  

  
One year though , we wanted to plan a different trip , one where our focus wasn’t necessarily to climb a mountain but rather to just relax and have fun . We ended up settling with Norway , where we stayed in a little cabin owned by an old man named Macif. We arrived in December and it had been snowing quite heavily .
  

  
“Hey , Macif right ?” 
  

  
“Yes that’s me , come on right in , it’s freezing cold out there.” He handed both of us a cup of tea “O and just before I forget , here are the keys to the cabin .” He handed both of us a copy that had the number 52 marked on it . “ If you guys don’t mind me asking , what are your plans to do in Norway? It’s been snowing quite heavily recently as you could tell .”
  

  
“Yeah , well we just wanted to relax and just try out something different . We’re not really sure on what there is to do here  but the snow sure is something different  , back where we live there is no snow.”
  

  
“ O I see , well if you guys really want I can give you a small tour of this place .” 
  

  
We agreed , and the following morning we woke up early to meet Macif . The snow was heavy and just walking through it was quite a difficult task , but it was quite magnificent to see the way the snow  covered all of the land , the trees and the mountains … the mountains .
  

  
“Hey look at that Bill !” Bryan shook my shoulder , he pointed his finger at the mountain straight ahead . “ I-its frickin incredible , I swear we’ve never seen anything like it before” It was , I had never seen a mountain so massive before and the way the snow majestically covered it was a definitely a sight to behold . We hadn’t planned any mountain climbing but I had to ask Macif -
  

  
“Hey Macif , what can you tell us about that mountain over there ?”
  

  
His expression changed to one of worry suddenly “ O, are you talking about the Weepers Mountain ?”
  

  
“Yeah , is that what it's called ? Sounds kinda dark.” 
  

  
“Well I mean its presence is just inescapable, even if the snow were to cover all of it , you would still know it’s there.”
  

  
“What do you mean by that?” 
  

  
“Well here’s the thing , it’s called The Weepers Mountain  because every single day when the clock strikes noon you can hear a weeping sound coming from that mountain. The cycle lasts 5 minutes , but with each passing second it grows in intensity until you just can’t take it anymore . It’s our little curse I guess you can say , no one knows where exactly it comes from , many people have tried to find the cause of the sound but they’re just never successful , sometimes we don’t even see them come back . We’ve lost many people this way… I just wis-“
  

  
Noon had striked and Macif was interrupted by a faint weeping sound . We all heard it and just froze in place , as the seconds passed the sound grew louder and LoUdEr and LOUDER , shaking all the trees around us and causing us to stumble onto the floor. It kept growing more agressive until - 
  

  
 It just stopped.
  

  
We kept walking for a little more after that ,  but it wasn’t the same , I was truly scared but I noticed that Bryan wasn’t , not at all in fact . His expression was that of determination , at the time I didn’t know why but once we returned to the cabin later that day I found out.
  

  
“That sure was a trip.” I said as I plumped myself onto the chair , I was beat.
  

  
“Yeah … that mountain though and the weeping , I- Ive never seen or heard anything like it before” Bryan said 
  

  
“I know , what the hell even was that?” 
  

  
“I don’t know but I gotta find out.”
  

  
“O cmon , your kidding right ?” 
  

  
“No I’m dead serious , who knows when we’ll be able to climb a mountain just like this one , and aside from the motivation of reaching the top we have another reason to do so , we can solve a mystery while we’re at it . Cmon what do you say?”
  

  
“ I say no , I’m really sorry man but I just can’t to something like this .”
  

  
“That’s ok , don’t worry about it . I’m gonna catch on some rest so I’ll cya tomorrow.” 
  

  
He went off to his room , and the next morning he was gone . I sat down on a chair just thinking what to do while I ate my breakfast. 
  

  
Was he going to be ok?
  

  
What if he didn’t make it ?
  

  
Those questions kept troubling me and stealing the little peace I had left. After much thought I decided to go towards “The Weepers mountain.” 
  

  
The snow was falling down hard on me , and despite all the clothing I had on top of me the cold air still managed to bite every bit of my skin . I was getting desperate , the higher I climbed the more effort it took to breath in air and I felt like I was going to faint . I didn’t know what to do and all I could think to myself was 
  

  
Why did you come up here ! 
  

  
Your so stupid , he’s probably not even here 
  

  
I started to cry and just when I thought all hope was lost I noticed that there was an entrance to a cave . I made my way towards it and plopped myself onto the ground when I made it , breathing heavily . 
  

  
I started to drift off …
  

  
Not 10 minutes went by when I heard it , it was the weeping sound again , except this time it  was it was coming from inside the cave 
  

  
O God why now …
  

  
The weeping grew louder with each passing second , shaking every inch of the cave . Rocks started to fall down on me and I crunched down and placed my hands over my head to protect it .
  

  
The noise was insufferable but just before the cycle I heard a scream 
  

  
“HELP!! PLEASE , SOMEONE HELP”
  

  
I got up from where I was and walked towards the direction I thought I heard the scream coming from . I turned on my flashlight and went deeper into the cave , the deeper I went the more I started to notice a foul stench nearby . It smelled putrid , a smell of death …
  

  
I walked more until I made it towards a corner of the cave and turned , that’s when I saw them …
  

  
Dozens of corpses laying on both sides of the cave , some had their arms chopped off , others had their legs removed and others were even missing their heads .  
  

  
I couldn’t take it anymore , I hunched over and my stomach let loose . 
  

  
I wanted to turn back but I couldn’t …
  

  
I had to continue for whoever was out there begging for help . The more I walked  through the line of corpses the more I noticed something even more disturbing . The corpses at the far end seemed to have been there for decades but the ones I was looking at now , seemed to be more recent , most of their skin seemed to be there and they were just starting to rot .
  

  
I continued walking , I turned towards another corner and I nearly screamed  when I saw it . 
  

  
It was pale , and it sat in a  huddled position , it’s  back turned towards me , exposing every bone in its body . 
  

  

  
SNAP
  

  
CRUNCH 
  

  
It was feasting on something .
  

  
SNAP 
  

  
SNAP 
  

  

  
An arm rolled towards me , then a leg . I started backing away slowly but just when I started to do so , a ball shaped object rolled towards me , I shined my flashlight at recognize it immediately 
  
  It was a head …
