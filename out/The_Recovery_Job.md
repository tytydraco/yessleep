**August 19th, 2022**



As of 6:00 PM today, the site has been fully secured as per the instructions of Grandmaster Parsons. He requested that I keep him updated on our investigation/progress during the coming days and I will make a point not to disappoint him. He seems to believe that there is something of value at the bottom of this lake, and though I personally have my doubts, I am in no position to question him.



Not openly, at least.



In private, I can’t help but wonder if this little salvage operation is a waste of our resources. Our organization has more important things to do than chase conspiracy theories. And hell… what’s he thinking sending us out to Tevam Sound? That place is crawling with Fae shit that I’d rather not fuck around with. It’s *basically* Imperium territory. There’s enough dangerous things out here that we already have to deal with without adding rumors of crashed spaceships into the mix… but I digress. Orders are orders. I don’t have to like them, I just have to follow them.



I suppose to be fair, there are a few eyewitnesses in town who claim they spotted several ‘*floating orbs*’ in the sky a little over a month back. Supposedly, one of those orbs *‘burst into flame’* and crashed into the lake.



If I had to guess, what they’re describing sounds more like either a meteor shower (unlikely) or some sort of light show. Tevam Sound is in cottage country, and Silver Lake has several cottages scattered around it. It’s likely that some kids were having some fun with drones or fireworks and a bunch of local idiots saw them and thought they were having a close encounter. Ultimately, I don’t expect this little expedition of ours to turn up anything more than junk at best. Although with all that said, I guess there could be worse dead end postings.



The lake is beautiful at this time of year, and while my team and I conduct our preliminary survey, we’re renting a small cottage on the water.



If I didn’t know any better, I’d suspect that Grandmaster Parsons was sending us on some sort of glorified vacation, although I’m quite certain that word isn’t anywhere to be found in Parsons vocabulary. Either way, I don’t suppose I have a real reason to complain much. We’ll conduct our search, collect our data and send our updates to the Grandmaster. In a week or two, he’ll see how pointless this all was, and call us in. Until then, maybe I ought to make the most of my time here.



A couple of the men Parsons sent with me are among the more devoted followers of the Brethrens doctrine… but I’ve never been a particularly religious man myself, and Tevam Sound *is* a college town. I know at least one of my Men is going to try and have some fun. Maybe I ought to as well?You know, the more I write this down, the less agitated I feel about this whole situation. Maybe the Lord really does work in mysterious ways?

As expected, we’ve had no meaningful updates during our time here. We’ve used every tool at our disposal to sweep this lake up and down. We’ve sent down divers near the alleged crash site. Nothing. I can’t say I’m surprised, although Parsons is adamant we keep searching.



Given how cozy this posting has become, I’m really not obligated to complain. This whole pointless operation has basically turned into a glorified fishing trip. My team has, for the most part, taken the same attitude towards this posting as I have. You’d think a few of them had gone back to college, with the way they’re acting.



Andrews sent most of us a picture from the bar last night. A photo of his big, dumb, grinning face with a bunch of girls from the local University seated at a table behind him. It was accompanied by the message: *“Which one am I fucking tonight, boys?”*



A couple of the other men, Jenkins and Roberts tried to take bets, but no one was that interested in it. Edwards and Thornton, our more zealous members didn’t seem to appreciate their attitude. They requested that I discipline Andrews, but I’m not going to bother with that.



I don’t care where that potato faced lout sticks his dick and I don’t care if Edwards and Thornton are bothered by what he does after dark. We’re here to do a job. That’s my concern, and nothing else. It’s a stupid job, but we’re going to do it.

We did have one mildly interesting encounter the other day.



Someone from the University came by to check in on us, a man. He introduced himself as ‘*Mr. Frost*’. I never got his first name. There was something off about him. Although I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. For the most part, he seemed normal, although I got the impression that he was trying a little *too* hard to be friendly. He had this overeager, too wide smile that didn’t sit right with me.



Honestly, I’m surprised the University sent anyone to check in on us. We had informed them that we would be undertaking a survey of the lake, just to make sure that they were keeping out of our way, and at the time they hadn’t really seemed to care. We hadn’t told them exactly what we were looking for either… although Frost already seemed to know and he didn’t exactly mince words on the subject either.



Simply put, he told us that both the local police and the University had already investigated the allegations of some sort of UFO. They’d combed the lake about a month back, turned up nothing and dismissed the whole thing as a hoax.



Although…



Well.



The *way* he said it didn’t quite sit right with me.



*“You’re wasting your time,”* He said. *“There’s nothing you want out here. That I can guarantee.”*



Maybe it was his choice of words? Like he knew something I didn’t? Either way, I explained to her that our organization wanted to independently verify that data, and once he seemed to understand that we weren’t leaving, I could see a sort of disappointed look cross his face.



I told him that I figured we probably *were* just chasing a hoax, but the top brass had given us our marching orders, so our hands were tied. He said he completely understood, saying “We are *all deferential to our employers.”*



Weird way of phrasing that… but he left without a fuss, so there was that, and there weren’t any other prominent red flags about the man.



Still… I keep thinking back to that encounter. Something was just… off about it. I just don’t know what.



I’ve seen some shit during my time with the Brethren. The kind of shit most people wouldn’t believe. I know there’s more to the world than meets the eye, and I’d like to think I’d notice if the man I was talking to wasn’t entirely human. But none of the usual red flags popped up with him. I don’t know… maybe I’m overthinking all of this.



Last month, we put down a group of fucking vampires. Now we’re out here digging into this sci-fi bullshit. I’m not used to having so little to do… not that I’m complaining much. It’s peaceful out here… even now that I’m sitting here, writing this I’m sitting on the back porch of our little cottage, watching the sun go down over the lake. Through the light shining through the trees, I can see Jenkins, Edwards and Thornton sitting around a fucking campfire, like a couple of kids. Pretty sure Roberts went fishing. I’ve never been on a job this quiet before. It’s probably normal for a guy like me to start jumping at shadows…

Probably.

Thornton found something during our sweep today. We were out a little further than usual from the crash site. There’s a large creek that shoots off of the lake. It was too shallow to take the boat through, so we waded up and down, searching for anything of interest. There’s a lot of rocks scattered about and a lotta trash caught by said rocks… I didn’t think we’d find anything of value there, but I guess I was wrong.



Thornton found it at the bottom of a short waterfall, lodged between a few of the rocks. A chunk of burnt metal. I figured that it might’ve just been a standard piece of debris. A chunk off a boat, or something. At best, the results would be inconclusive. But we still brought it back to the cottage so Edwards could run some tests on it.



The results are not inconclusive. Not entirely. I’m not sure *what* we’ve found, but it’s some sort of weird high strength, heatproof aluminum alloy.



Well… supposedly heatproof. It’s been burned almost completely black. He’s still looking into it, but he doesn’t think something like this came off a regular boat. He doesn’t want to say with confidence *where* it might’ve come from… but I know what he’s thinking.



It’s what we’re all thinking.



I dunno… I’ve seen some weird shit in my day, but aliens? Guess I shouldn’t close my mind off to it… but the idea just seems *too* weird for me. I’ll file my report with Parsons in the morning, although I already know he’s going to make us redouble our efforts. If there’s one piece of this alleged spaceship out there, then there’s probably more. And now that we know what we’re looking for, it might be easier to find it.

Andrews is missing. He went out drinking last night and didn’t come back. I spent half he fucking day in town, looking for him. Far as I can tell, he was at one of the bars last night. The bartender saw him leave with a woman. He described her as: *“Red hair, dark skin and a nice body.”*  
After that though, the trail goes cold. The bartender said he hadn’t seen the girl before. Can’t say I’m surprised by that.



I’ve had the other men on high alert. Odds are, the dumb bastard got picked up by a Siren. Tevam Sound is more or less Imperium territory, so it’s not exactly the safest place for our men to operate. But the Imperium and their ilk will usually leave you alone if you stay out of their business, so I wasn’t expecting much if any trouble, so long as we kept to ourselves.



Maybe this is just an isolated incident? That’s what my gut says. The idiot probably got too cozy with a siren, realized what he was getting himself into and tried to put the bitch down before getting himself killed in the process. I’ve seen guys go out that way before. Not the most dignified death, but Andrews was sorta asking for it the way he was going. I would’ve thought that after all the years we’ve spent dealing with their ilk, he of all people would know how to fucking recognize a Siren as opposed to ending up a victim, but I digress.

I already know what Parsons is gonna say. He’s gonna want me to go in guns blazing, find whatever killed Andrews and kill it in turn. That’s the Brethrens go to answer for most of its fucking problems. Normally, I wouldn’t argue with it. But right now, I can’t shake the feeling that the blunt approach is not the way to go. In a place like Tevam Sound, it’d probably be suicide and I really don’t want to be in charge of the next group of dumbasses who get fucking massacared because they decided to run in and pick a pointless fight with the local monsters. So I’m gonna try and play this a little smarter, and I’m not reporting a thing to Parsons until I’ve got some more information. I already know Edwards and Thornton won’t go for it, but I might be able to get the others on my side.



Shit… maybe we’ll get lucky and that dumbass will turn up with some lame excuse as to why he fucked off on us. Maybe I ought to ask Thornton to pray for that.





**Excerpt from the journal of Brother Michael Chester**

**August 30th, 2022**



Well, I’ve got good news and bad news.



The good news is that diplomacy fucking works.  
I did some poking around last night, to see if I couldn’t get an in with the local Fae. It didn’t take me long before someone agreed to put me in touch with a member of the local Siren community. Shelby.



Sirens aren’t the sort of creatures you fuck around with idly. One look in their eyes, and you’re under their spell. Next thing you know, you’ve got their fangs in your throat and they’re dragging you underwater to feast on your blood. But, they’re also not *complete* animals. If they were, they wouldn’t still be around. I was hoping that by showing Shelby I was willing to be reasonable, she’d extend me the same courtesy. Thank fucking God that I was right.



I met with her this morning, outside some local chip wagon by the marina. She was a grumpy looking thing with short red hair, but she was willing to hear me out, at least. When I asked about Andrews she mentioned that as far as she knew, no one in her community had picked him up let alone killed him, and there weren’t many vampires in the area. I also passed along the description of the woman the bartender had seen, just to see if she’d recognize it.



She didn’t.

I know I should probably take what a local Siren says with a grain of salt. Us and them aren’t exactly on the best of terms… but I’m inclined to believe her. I’ve worked with Andrews for a while. We’ve been dealing with creatures like Sirens for years now. It’d be odd for him not to recognize one out in the wild. Not impossible, mind you. But odd.



No.



The more I think about it, the less certain I am that the local Sirens had anything to do with his disappearance, and that thought genuinely fucking scares me.



If the local Fae didn’t take him, then what did? We’ve wasted enough time looking for Andrews at this point.



I’m going to need to report in to Parsons in the morning. I’ll probably need to altar my story a bit, to keep him placated. He’s an *‘eye for an eye’* kind of guy, so I’ll just say we tortured the one of the Sirens or something. That should satisfy him.  
I’ll need to get a status report from Thornton, Jenkins and Edwards too. I’ve had them keeping up the search while I’ve been busy chasing down Andrews. Maybe if I’m lucky, they’ll have something else I can give Parsons.





**Excerpt from the journal of Brother Michael Chester**

**August 31st, 2022**



There’s definitely something in the lake.



Thornton spent a good chunk of last night walking me through what they found. They got a ping off of a metallic object submerged near where the unknown object had seemingly gone down. He and Jenkins even did a dive yesterday to try and get a look at it, take some pictures and collect some samples. I think we might’ve hit paydirt.



Edwards examined the samples they’d retrieved. He was able to confirm that whatever is down there is made of the same alloy as the chunk of metal we found in the creek. It’s also just as badly burned. We went out today to take a closer look at this thing. I even suited up and went down to see it for myself.



It’s hard to get a read on the shape of it. Odds are, whatever it *was,* it’s been warped beyond recognition by whatever it was that destroyed it. I’ve asked Edwards to analyze the photos we’ve taken, and send everything we’ve got to Parsons. I get the feeling he’s gonna be sending more men out to join our team. If we’re especially unlucky, he might come and visit us himself. Guess that means our little vacation is just about over. He’s gonna want to haul it up as soon as possible so he can get a good look at it.



Although now that we seem to have found something… I can’t help but wonder why he cares. Our organization deals with supernatural shit. Vampires, Sirens, Werewolves. Shit like that. This sci-fi shit is way out of our ballpark. Maybe he’s just being proactive? If there’s a new player on the board, best to learn as much about them as soon as possible, right? But that explanation doesn’t sit right with me.



This whole story about the crashed UFO sounded like the kind of bullshit you’d read in the Weekly World News. Our organization usually doesn’t go digging into tabloid horseshit like that, because we *know* that 9.9999 times out of 10, it’s complete fiction. So what did Parsons know that made this different? Did he just fucking casually *know* that Aliens existed and just choose never to mention it to anybody, because if so, that’s fucked up!



Maybe I’m overthinking it. I’m not exactly high in the Brethrens rankings (nor do I want to be, my superiors are all fucking nuts), and there’s probably secrets us low tier grunts aren’t privy to. But *this* bothers me. He knew something was out here. Maybe he’s looking for bodies? Specimens? Weapons? Tech?



…



I can’t help but question if the world would really be better off if a man like Parsons had fucking alien tech. I know we’re on the same side… but I’m not convinced it would be. There’s something else that’s bothering me.



Andrews disappearance.

I keep thinking back to it.



I still believe Shelby, when she said that her people had nothing to do with it… and I keep wondering if maybe her people aren’t the only ones hanging around Tevam Sound. And if that’s the case, then maybe we’re not the only ones looking for that crashed ship.

**September 1st, 2022**



Parsons men will be here in a few days for a salvage operation.  
For now, all we need to do is sit tight. I can’t say that I mind… but I just wish I could keep my mind off the questions that keep bubbling up. The other guys don’t seem as bothered. Edwards and Thornton, I get. They’re hardcore zealots. I once heard Thornton tell me that everyone was born right handed, and that you only *become* left handed after committing an unforgivable sin, and by God he fucking believed it!



Jenkins and Roberts are more on my side, but I don’t think they’re considering the implications of the job we’re currently on. I don’t think they’re considering what our superiors might just be about to get their hands on, and I don’t think they’re considering *if* they should be getting their hands on it.



Maybe I’m overthinking all of this. God, I fucking hope I am. But I don’t think so.



I feel like I’m being watched. I’ve felt it for a few days now. I thought it was the local Fae at first. Maybe Shelby and her ilk wanted to keep an eye on us, to make sure we didn’t pull anything.



But no. I don’t think it’s them. I went for a walk to clear my head this afternoon. I found myself by the creek where we’d found the first piece of the ship, and I walked along it for a bit, hoping that the atmosphere might give me a bit of peace. It almost did… up until I saw the movement in the trees.



Maybe it was nothing. Maybe it was just a squirrel, running through the brush. I don’t know for sure. Maybe it was something else. I think I’m gonna start carrying my gun on me wherever I go, just in case.





**Excerpt from the journal of Brother Michael Chester**

**September 2nd, 2022**



Jenkins went missing last night.



We were having ourselves a little campfire, and he left to grab some more wood from the shed. He didn’t come back.



I’m going to keep the rest of the men inside. Everyone needs to be armed. We’re not alone out here.





**Excerpt from the journal of Brother Michael Chester**

**September 3nd, 2022**



They came last night.



We barricaded ourselves in the cottage. I thought that might be enough to keep us safe. No.



I saw the lights in the sky first, way up above us. Thought it was a helicopter at first, but helicopters don’t fly that fast. I thought we’d be safe inside… I thought…



The storm hit suddenly. There wasn’t supposed to be a storm last night. But there was. One minute, it was just dark. Then I heard the rain pattering against the windows. It started off slow, before quickly getting louder and louder until it was the only thing you could hear, pounding on the glass louder than a couple of skeletons fucking on a tin roof. The wind started to howl so hard, that I could’ve sworn the entire cottage was going to come apart. This was a pretty goddamn well built cottage, and it shook like it was held together with string and elmers glue. I was almost starting to wonder if we were in the middle of a tornado but no.



This was something else entirely.



I told the others to get down into the basement. Figured it might be safer. I was right.



The windows shattered, just as we were heading downstairs. And around that same time, I could feel the temperature rising around us, going from cool to sweltering hot. When the glass broke, Edwards panicked. He said he needed to grab some of his equipment, which he’d left in the living room. I told him to leave it, but the dumb bastard didn’t listen.



I left him behind… I figured he’d be right behind me. But he was still upstairs when the fire started.



I call it a fire… I don’t know if that’s the right term. It wasn’t a flame that spread and consumed everything. It was so much more sudden. One minute, everything was normal, and the next… everything was burning. I could see it at the top of the stairs from the basement. The flames just sprang to life, and seemed to engulf everything almost immediately.



Within seconds, the ceiling above us was burning. The cottage was burning. I didn’t hear a single sound from Edwards… not a scream… not a cry of pain.



I wonder if he died instantly? God, I hope he did. We couldn’t stay down there… not without dying ourselves.



There was a window we managed to break. Thornton and I pushed Robert out first. I made Thornton go second, and let him pull me out. The place was already an inferno by the time I crawled out of that window. In all my years, I’ve never seen anything like it. But even that paled in comparison to the lights in the sky above us.



They were only barely hidden by the storm… they cut through the darkness, looming over us and making it all too clear that we were being hunted. I made us do the only thing we could do.



I made us run for the boat. But I guess that’s what they were expecting. We’d almost made it before I saw the shapes waiting for us in the trees by the dock. Figures watching us through reflective visors.



The moment I saw them, I knew what they were. They were the ones who didn’t want us dredging their crashed ship out of the depths. I saw Thornton freeze beside me.



He had the good sense to go for his gun, but it didn’t do him much good. One moment he was standing, and the next he was burning. I could smell his flesh as it cooked… but it’s the scream that will probably stay with me for the rest of my life. His blond hair just burned off his scalp. His glasses cracked and blackened under the heat. He collapsed to the ground, his flesh blistered, blackened and still burning.



I heard Roberts scream. Both of us tried to just get past the figures that were waiting for us. I was lucky enough to actually get to the trees. Roberts wasn’t.



I saw him fall.



Smelled him as he burned.



I saw the figures aiming for me next and then… by sheer dumb luck I tripped and fell, tumbling down a rocky incline and into the lake. I could smell the air around me burning as I fell, but I didn’t cook.



I crashed beneath the surface and didn’t let myself surface again. I knew that when I did, they’d kill me. Instead, I just swam in the only direction that made sense. Back toward the dock. I didn’t let myself come up for air until I knew I was under it, and when I finally surfaced I waited for those *things* to somehow spot me and kill me. I don’t know how they didn’t.



I could still smell the burning.



I could hear them moving around… probably looking for me. But they never checked under the dock. Maybe they thought they’d gotten me? Or maybe they thought I’d drowned? I don’t know. Maybe they knew exactly where I was, and simply decided that leaving one survivor sent more of a message.



Either way, all was silent.



The sounds of movement stopped, leaving me with only the storm raging above me, and the smell of burning around me. But I didn’t dare move. I didn’t dare trust that the things that had come for us were gone.



I didn’t want to die like the others did… I didn’t…



I stayed under that dock until around sunrise, when the local emergency services came to investigate the fire. It was only then that I knew it was safe.



I’m used to lying to the cops… it comes with the territory, when you do the things I do. But I didn’t even know where to *start* with lying to them about what happened here?



For what it’s worth, I tried to keep it pretty grounded in reality. I told them the storm had hit us suddenly. I told them that I hadn’t seen what had happened to the other guys and that I’d just tried to find shelter from the storm. There was no reason to question me beyond that, so the cops just let me go.



Since then, I’ve been staying at a motel in town. I still need to contact Parsons and tell him what’s happened.





I just…

I need more time to process it.





**Excerpt from the journal of Brother Michael Chester**

**September 7th, 2022**

As of today, I’ve officially resigned from the Brethren Knights. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back out there, after this. I don’t want to go back out there.



I saw that man 'from the University' in town the other day.

Frost.



I only saw him across the street. Standing there. Smiling at me. We didn't speak. But that smile... that fucking smile. I knew at a glance that he knew what had happened to me. To us. And looking at him, I somehow knew that he was there to make it clear to me that I only survived because they let me. I'm only alive because they wanted a witness.



Parsons swept the lake.

I told him where to find his wreckage… although when he went to collect it, there was nothing to find. Looks like someone else got to it first.



I can’t say I’m too disappointed about that. Looking into it in the first place was a suicidal mistake and I can only hope that next time Parsons wants to make such a mistake, he’ll do it personally. I doubt it, but a man can dream.



Shelby’s been good to me these past few days. She’s given me a place to stay and get my bearings. I didn’t know Sirens were capable of that kind of hospitality… but if Aliens fucking exist, I suppose there’s stranger things.



I think I might stick around Tevam Sound for a bit longer. I don’t really have anywhere else to go, and I suppose I owe her a few favors. I’m also considering submitting a record of my encounter at the lake to the Imperium.



I don’t know if they’ll believe me… I’m sure even a collection of Fae have their limits on what they’ll believe, but I think it’s best to warn them all the same.



Whatever differences our people have with theirs… I don’t think they’re going to fucking matter to whatever is out there. Human, Fae, whatever. *They* won’t care.

Maybe we shouldn’t either.
