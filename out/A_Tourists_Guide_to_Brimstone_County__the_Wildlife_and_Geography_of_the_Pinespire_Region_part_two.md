In this guide, I will cover the geography, wildlife, history, and human settlements of each region. We will start in the largest region of Brimstone County, the Pinespire forest.

The Pinespire forest is home to many creatures and towns. It resembles the forests of Canada and the northern United States, occupied primarily by spruce trees with some others mixed in, such as pine and fir.

The Pinespire region is mostly flat, with some hills and the end of the Blackrock Mountain Range at the eastern end. Much of the wildlife is also animals local to any taiga forest, including moose, elk, caribou, fox, multiple species of owl and several other birds, gray wolves, lynx, etcetera.

It is, however, still subject to the condition of everything in brimstone county. It is not populated only by the aforementioned animals, but by some others that don’t quite fit into any kingdom of living creature, nor in science as a whole. I have had encounters with many of these creatures.

The first, aside from the shell house, was with something I have come to recognize as a Skinwalker, though it is not quite the same Skinwalker that has become widely popular. This pattern is prevalent in the supernatural animals - I will refer to them as animals from here on out for ease of communication, but the two should not be confused - in Brimstone County, as the story of them gets altered when passed around, and eventually changes completely.

Now, as I was saying, my first encounter with a paranormal entity was the Skinwalker. I had been camping, as at the time I still lived in the same house as when I saw the shell house, and I often felt uncomfortable near it and would spend nights in the wilderness instead.

I would learn the hard way, multiple times, that the wilderness was a much more dangerous place than any house. 

 I was spending the night in a tent, with only a small lamp and a campfire outside that I had put out a few hours before. I was trying to sleep inside the tent, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.

After several minutes, I realized that every animal in the woods had gone completely silent. Even at night, it’s usually loud in the woods. At least there are always frogs, or crickets, or owls, or *something*. But tonight they were silent.

This unnerved me for two reasons. One, it is incredibly eerie to find yourself in a situation where the sounds that should be present are not, for whatever reason. Two, it meant that I was either completely alone, or that something very dangerous was the only thing here with me.

For those unaware, the woods going silent are a telltale sign of a predator nearby. The smaller animals are trying to hide themselves to avoid becoming prey, and the human in the situation is often left the only thing displaying themselves openly.

Humans have a bad habit of thinking we’re on top of the food chain.

I turned off my lamp. I sat in darkness, as silent and still as possible, for what could only have been a few minutes, though it felt like hours. I heard something large moving through the branches and shrubbery near my campsite. Then it stopped, and very slowly crept toward the tent.

I heard a horrible snapping sound, like a limb, and the sound of flesh ripping. Then the sound of nylon tent fabric being shredded apart. I turned the lamp back on. It was idiotic, but at that point I had assumed I was going to die anyway and wanted to know what was about to kill me.

It looked like a moose. It’s head and leg we’re sticking through the hole. The leg had been snapped backwards, and it must have used the exposed bone shards to rip open the tent. I screamed, in fear and disgust, and smashed the lamp into the head of the creature whatever it was, because I was sure it was not a moose.

The plexiglass casing around the lamp shattered, leaving only a metal shell, and the shards of it were sprayed across me and the not-moose. I was cast back into darkness, now screaming only from pain, but I was still aware enough to kick the creature as hard as I could in the face. It jolted back, the half of its leg that had a hoof on it being jerked off, falling to the floor of my tent.

The thing roared, a sound that a moose is definitely not supposed to make, and then it melted. Not into meat sludge, or anything organic. It melted into a shapeless, formless, abstract mass of matter. Something unnatural and semi-four dimensional.

I have read the work of H.P. Lovecraft. As soon as this happened, I looked away, trying desperately to retain my sanity, in case it was some kind of cosmic abomination, but the first image of the Skinwalker’s true form has been burned forever into my memory.

I heard it morph back into some animal, bones cracking into place, and it ran into the trees. I do not know how I repelled it, if something was protecting me, but I haven’t lingered on it long. 

I got out of my tent, taking nothing with me, sprinting until I got back to my car. My sides hurt, along with all the cuts from the plexiglass in the lamp, but I kept running. When I arrived at my car, I fished for my keys, found them, then got in and drove to the hospital. Tired, bleeding, and sore, I walked in, and without any exchange of words I was brought to a small room filled with medical equipment.

The hospital was mostly empty, so I was met almost immediately with a doctor who asked me some questions before she began cleaning off the wounds to remove the shards.

“What happened to you?” He asked. “Other than the glass.”

“I was camping.” I said. I didn’t want to think about what had happened.

He laughed. “Tell me you’re new to Brimstone County without telling me you’re new to Brimstone County.”

I was in the room for an hour and a half, and I left without any major injuries. I’m fortunate I kept my sense of sight, and that none of the lamp pieces got in my mouth as I screamed, but I did not give up camping. I would have other encounters later, which I won’t get into here, which finally deterred me from the forest.
