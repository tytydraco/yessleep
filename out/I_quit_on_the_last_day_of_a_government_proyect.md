Even before that whole sequence of events happened, I always wanted to quit, but I couldn't muster up the courage to do it; these fears were usually due to rumors of ex-employees being killed right after resigning or getting fired.

I worked as a lab research assistant; the "work" I was assigned was usually putting numbers in an Excel sheet and writing any progress that the main scientist did; the reason I always wanted to quit was when I had to see any of the experiments they conducted. 

Supposedly, it was to create a solution to world hunger; we modified the genetic code of many farm animals and some exceptions, one time that I can remember clearly.

We were watching the birth of a calf, and birth has a certain beauty to it, the creation of a new life, but I felt uneasy the whole time, maybe it was the room were in, small grey, a small table to put our documents and supervise the cows trough a window, a control panel that it looked like its been here trough some world wars, and to top it off the screaming of a thousand different animals in heat, pain, or hunger. 

Supposedly the report we made previous to the birth. Said that its genetic code was modified to be avian-like. We didn't mix DNAs, but instead, we copied the genetic code of birds and imitated it on the fetus of this cow. 

I remember reading it out loud to my colleagues. After I finished, I looked up and saw how they performed a cesarean section; each cut they did felt more unsettling than the last; the blood was coming out as if it was a burst water pipe. 

One of the surgeons dug deep into the cow and took out an egg. It was like one of those ostrich eggs, gigantic, and you could hear the calf inside even though we were behind a window muffled with a thousand other noises. I remember just standing still, wrapping my mind around this, but most of my coworkers had a huge smile; some just looked tired, and others walked out of the room. I began to despise everyone there, not at that moment, but it just boosted that hatred that I was building up. 

After a few months of other experiments each time playing god a little bit more. At this point, they didn't even look like the animals they were based on, amalgams of flesh and blood, blobs that could procreate and die. I was tired of looking through a window and writing down anything they told me to; the last few days of the project, I submitted my resignation letter, and they told me that any work that I did here wouldn't be credited when delivering the project to the government. And even though I just survived one more month of what felt like defying the will of god. I couldn't do it, I HAD TO resign. I HAD TO SAY I WAS OKAY WITH THIS.

So I did, I entered the facility, grabbing the piece of paper that would finally end my suffering, each step I took felt heavier than the last, I could hear every clock ticking, I started to hear the animals through the walls, the sweat running down my head, my clothes following my movements. 

I looked at my supervisor's door, grabbed the doorknob, and turned it * I squeaked * slowly turning to the right and pushing the door open. And there he was.

I only saw him two times, once when I got the job, and here. A somewhat short man in his 50s with glasses, a badly shaven beard, and balding, almost like what you imagine a retired accountant would look like. Mumbling about something, he finally noticed me; instead of being mad about me interrupting him, he was a bit relieved. And asked me in a calm tone

"Why are you here, Frank?"

I was surprised he knew my name. After all, I just had met him once before this. But I responded in a weird, nervous, and timid tone.

"Hi Frank, umm I'm sorry to do this to you but I'm here to leave you my letter of resignation"

Frank made a surprised expression, took off his glasses, and put them down on his desk, where he accumulated hundreds of papers. 

He breathed and sighed

And told me in the same tone as before

"Look, I can't stop you from doing anything you want to do, but I seriously would reconsider this. I'm not going to debate this, nor am I going to beg you to stay."

I stood up straight and told him

"I can't do this anymore, every it's the same. We were told we were making a solution to a global problem, but we are the ones who are creating another one. So no I'm NOT going to reconsider I am leaving now" 

Frank looked kind of sad, he knew what I said was true, and I felt like he wanted to say the same, but he couldn't. 

"Fine, give me a second so I can take you off the personnel list."

He grabbed his glasses, started typing on his computer, and said.

"Take a seat, please it is going to take a while" 

Hesitantly, I sat and waited while he typed; I felt like this giant burden was getting lifted. I was in peace, happy after what had been ages. Each click he made on the keyboard felt like a step to heaven, weird, I know. 

And then he finally said

"You are officially not a part of the m3a7 project, you may leave the facility, let god have mercy on your soul" 

The last part felt weird and unnecessary, but I ignored it the second I touched the door just as I was about to leave the room. 

"THIS IS NOT A DRILL; THERE HAS BEEN A BREACH IN THE CONTAINMENT QUARTERS. I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A DRILL" 

Every light turned into a bright red, he pushed me from the door and locked it, trapping us inside. At that moment he shouted

"I HAVE AN EMERGENCY TRAPDOOR UNDER MY DESK, GO NOW!" 

I fell to the ground after he pushed me, but I rapidly got back up and started moving the desk, I started to see it; it had scratches and an analog number lock. I started to look around for something, but I couldn't figure out what. He started shouting

"WHERE THE GUN WHERE IS IT WHERE"

The calm demeanor he had completely shattered, just panic; we could hear screaming, splatter and otherworldly noises coming from outside.

"YES YES YES FOUND IT, MOVE" 

I got out of the way as he flung his gun around and put the code in on the trap door.

 click * * click * "COME ON PLEASE"  * click * 

The trapdoor flung open, and without wasting a single second, he jumped in, I hesitated a little bit more; either it was taking my chances and running from the room or following the man I had met only one other time. 

I jumped in.

 thump *

A smell shot up to my nose, a strong smell of rotten meat. 

I realized we were in the sewers. This was the worst place we could have entered.

I'm sorry I want to tell you more, but if my time is cutting short. I'll post an update as soon as I can.
