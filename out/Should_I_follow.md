I saw her first when I was nine. 

I wish I never had. It was the school bathroom—the one no one used. The lights always flickered, and the mirrors never showed your face quite right. The air hung thick, like it hadn't been breathed in years. Then the scraping started. Metal against metal. Slow. Deliberate. One stall door at a time. I held my breath as it drew closer. My heart slammed against my ribs like it was trying to escape. It stopped at my stall. I looked down. Small, bare feet. Crusted in blood. Toes twitching. I opened the door. She looked like me. Or what I might look like if I'd been buried alive. Her skin was corpse-grey, lips split and peeling, streaks of black grime across her jaw and collarbone. Her hair hung in matted ropes, soaked with filth. Her nightgown was soaked through with rot. But her eyes—if they could be called eyes—were voids. They swallowed light. They swallowed everything. Her mouth opened, unhinged. Wider. Too wide. As if something was trying to come out. I woke up soaked in sweat and urine. My voice was gone from screaming. 

My mother said it was a nightmare. But she never left. She followed me. She changed the way she appeared. Sometimes behind me in mirrors, her hand pressed flat to the glass. Sometimes crawling across the ceiling. Sometimes crouched on all fours in the corner of the room, twitching like a broken insect. 

When I turned thirteen, the paralysis began. I'd wake up and not be able to move. I'd feel her weight on me. Not just pressure—digging. Like she was trying to climb inside me. Her mouth would be inches from mine, and from her black eye sockets, I would hear screams. Not human. A chorus of children crying, something gurgling blood, a woman laughing while drowning. Her breath smelled like decay. Like something long dead and never buried. Then she'd speak. Always the same words. My voice, but wrong. Warped. "Follow me." 

I never did. So she started to punish me. She'd slam me into nightmares that felt more real than waking life. I'd wake with bruises. Claw marks. Once, a bite on my thigh so deep I bled. I told people I fell, cut myself in my sleep. No one believed me. They thought I wanted attention. I stopped telling anyone. But she didn’t stop. She started laughing. Whispering my name over and over. Sometimes she'd let me think I woke up—but I hadn't. I was still dreaming. 

Still trapped.

 Her face would slowly emerge from the ceiling. Her arms stretching down from corners that shouldn't exist. She'd crawl on top of me, her bones snapping audibly with each movement. Her nails dragging across my skin, slow and deliberate. Sometimes she pressed her face so close that I could feel her cracked teeth against my lips. I never kissed her back. She hated that. My relationships collapsed. One boyfriend woke up and swore he saw her kneeling on the headboard, looking down at him. He left the next morning and never returned my calls. 

I sought help everywhere. Sleep studies. Therapists. Priests. Psychics. Witch doctors. Rituals. Nothing worked. She stayed. Always just behind the reflection. Always just outside the door. 

Until I met my husband. She retreated. Maybe out of jealousy. Maybe out of patience. For years, she was silent. But now... she’s back. I see her in the dark corners of our home. In the fog on the bathroom mirror. In the sliver of reflection from my phone screen. She doesn’t speak anymore. She smiles. Because I think she knows.

I’m getting tired. So tired. The meds don’t work. My body can’t fight the paralysis forever. My mind is starting to crack. Sometimes I wake up with dirt under my nails and leaves in my mouth. 

Last night, she touched my face. And it didn’t feel like a dream. She wants me to follow. And I think, next time, I will.
