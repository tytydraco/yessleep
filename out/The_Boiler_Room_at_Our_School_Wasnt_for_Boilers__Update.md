Part 1 \[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jhl4af/the\_boiler\_room\_at\_our\_school\_wasnt\_for\_boilers/\]

A few days ago, I wrote a post about the basement of our school—the one that officially doesn't exist. I thought that was the end of the story.

I was wrong.

It won't leave me alone. The construction site, the barricades... it feels like they're hiding something. Something that shouldn’t be found.

So, I went back.

**Day 1**

I snuck into the construction site. The entrance I found last time was still there. This time, it was quiet. Not a single sound breaking through the basement, no voices echoing in the air. It was like the place itself grew quieter with every step I took.

The metal doors I had seen before were wide open again. I went deeper.

The room with the table was still there, but it was positioned differently. Further from the wall, in the center of the room. I didn’t want to know why. But I had to search the room again.

In one corner, I found an old photo. It was faded, almost eaten away by time, but it showed a group of students I didn’t recognize. But the image was unsettling. A man stood in the middle—I couldn’t make out his face, but the look in his eyes… It was like a shadow that almost felt too real.

I took it with me. I felt uneasy, but I couldn’t stop searching. The notebook I found in the same corner was covered in dust, like a relic. The pages were full of numbers, names, and strange notes. Some pages were almost completely illegible, as if they had been deliberately destroyed. But something wasn’t right. These names… I didn’t know them. And yet, it felt like I had seen them before.

I left the room and kept going. The feeling of not being alone grew stronger. I heard footsteps behind me, but every time I turned around, no one was there. I stayed calm, tried not to get distracted, but it was getting harder.

**Day 2**

I just couldn’t stop. So, I went back tonight. This time, I took everything I could find—the notebook, the photo I mentioned yesterday. I needed to know more. I had to understand what was really going on here.

I went deeper into the basement than ever before. There were more hallways than I originally thought. Each led to a different room, and each felt emptier than the last. But then I found one room that was different. The walls were covered in black lines, like strokes that crossed and layered over each other. The walls themselves looked like they had changed over the years—they were weak and cracked, as if they were carrying the weight of something.

In the center of the room was something I didn’t recognize at first. It was a chair—old, rusted, with leather padding. But something about this chair was wrong. The room suddenly felt tighter. The air thicker, and I had the sense that the walls were closing in.

I wanted out.

I ran back toward the exit, but as I climbed the stairs, I heard those footsteps again. This time, they were too close. I turned around, but no one was there. Just the darkness.

When I finally made it to the surface and walked away from the ruins, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. It was like someone was still down there.

I thought it was over.

But when I got home, my phone suddenly buzzed. The message was short and unmistakable:

*“You’ve seen too much.”*

I stared at the words. My heart was pounding. Who had sent this? And what did it mean?

I tried to stay calm, but the feeling of threat only grew. It couldn’t be a coincidence that this message came right after my last visit to the basement.

So, I decided to look up the company working on the construction site. They had to know what was going on there. Maybe I would find something that gave me more answers.

I began digging into “Oldstone Construction,” the company responsible for the project. At first, I found little—just a small, unassuming company that mostly handled renovations and rebuilds. But then, I came across an old press release that made my blood run cold.

In the press release was the name of the director. And to my horror, it was the same person who was the principal of my school.

He was the owner of the company.

The company that was currently rebuilding the property.

It wasn’t a coincidence. The principal knew more than he was letting on. He was deeply involved in this mysterious project.

I started digging even deeper. On the next pages, I found more clues—buildings that had been “renovated” but had no official records. Everything seemed to be connected. And it was clear: The principal didn’t want me to find out.

I was getting closer to the truth.

But then, as I continued my research, something happened that almost made me lose my mind: A message appeared on my phone.

*“You need to stop. You don’t know what you’re doing.”*

It didn’t come from an unknown number, but from a company I had never seen before: “Oldstone Construction.”

I knew I had gone too far.
