I've been trying to piece all of this together for a while now, but I haven't really known how until recently. So here’s the thing: I’ve been living in a hotel for the supernatural. Eternal Oasis saved my life, but it also awakened an awareness in me that still terrifies me to this day. If you don’t believe in the supernatural, you will now.

This started with one too many night terrors and a notice to vacate. I was never very good at sleeping. I know how that sounds, but just stick with me for a moment. Ever since I was little, I’d wake in the middle of the night, covered in a thin sheen of sweat, my gut twisted into knots.

I could never remember what the dreams were about after I woke up, but I do know that they were *very* vivid. I’d been to countless specialists (even a hypnotist), and nothing was able to help. Now that I'm older, the night terrors are less frequent, maybe once every couple of weeks, but apparently, they happen enough to freak out my college roommates. And that was the last straw.

Usually I couldn’t recall what happened in my nightmares, but this one was different. I was trapped in a glass box the size of a closet. Buckets of water started pouring in from every direction. My breathing was shallow as I fought to hold back my fear, but it was a feeble attempt. My fingers scraped at the sides of the glass before I pounded on it relentlessly, my screams falling on deaf ears. The water slowly began to climb, reaching my hips in mere seconds. Tears streamed down my face and strangled gasps left my lips as the water rose above my chin and into my nose, streaming into my mouth like tiny bugs.

Sometimes, I stayed in the glass box, trapped, suffocating, drowning in ice cold water dragging me down. But other times, I could press my face against the glass, and make out my surroundings; a large room, like a basement. I wasn't the only one inside that room. In front of me, surgical beds lain out parallel to each other. There was a new occupant each time. My first time, I saw a pretty dark haired girl, her head opened up, curls dried with blood haloing her face. Her mouth was always wide open in an O. Like she was trying to scream, but couldn't. Like a screech was tangled in her throat, her voice box torn out. And I imagined that in such vivid detail, it terrified me; the deep blue surgical gloves attached to a shadow without an identity, reaching inside her throat, and cruelly tearing it out, pouring red dribbling from her numb, soundless lips.

I imagined that girl as me. I imagined her nails like claws, scratching at velcro straps holding her down. She ripped and tore, and clawed, but blood kept coming, drowning her… drowning me, until both of us were numb nothings, not dead, and not alive.

Somewhere in between.

As these nightmare's grew more vivid, more real, striking in the middle of the day, when narcolepsy took a hold of me, and plunged me into the dark once again, I saw more people inside that room where red stained every surface, clinging to the walls and staining tiled floors that were never washed, never taken care of. Whoever owned the nightmare room, wanted blood to flow. The girl with no voice, no scream, disappeared. She didn't die, because unlike the human sized bodies covered in white sheets shoved into the corner, piled into a table of snake-like limbs, she survived.

I started seeing the guy soon after.

Strapped to the same bed, violent, unlike the girl, hissing and snapping his teeth like a wild animal. Under a flickering yellow light illuminating a face battered with scars and bruises, I knew he was going to die. Unlike the girl, his body was rejecting the process. It rejected the cruel blade stuck inside his skull, and it rejected the plastic tube forced between his curled lips, in an attempt to torture his rejection from him.

But he chose to die, spluttering on water, on his own blood and brains pouring from his ears, the nameless boy chose to die.

I felt his death like my own, choking on blood tinged water spilling from his lips, wrenching on restraints forcefully gluing his bare back to the metal gurney. He screamed without a voice, and when that didn't help, he begged with crumbling thoughts. His nails clawed, just like the girl's. With no mouth to scream with, with no thoughts to think, his mind ripped apart, all he could do was claw at the restraints until the stubs were bloody, until the light above him shattered, showering him with glass that caught the light, almost spellbinding him, because how could something so horrifying, be so…

*Beautiful?*

His last words were on my lips, while the girl's tears stained my cheeks pressed to my pillows.

“Winnie!” Karma yelled, tearing me from yet another sleep-mare. “Wake up!” Her high-pitched screech instantly ripped me from slumber, and I swallowed the word *‘beautiful’* with the majority of my breakfast. Thankfully, my roommate was quick to shatter the dream, or nightmare, or whatever the heck it was. Karma's stomps were loud and angry, and when she finally stopped right in front of me, I was shocked to see a crumpled piece of paper hanging from her manicured fingers. Oh, gosh, no.

It was a "polite" request for me to vacate the room.

“Listen,” Karma started, irritation radiating off of her in waves. “I don’t know what your problem is, but all of us girls have decided that we just can’t deal with having you in the house anymore. Your night terrors are really getting out of hand.”

I rubbed my eyes, snatching the paper from her hand and crumpling it before tossing it on the floor. What kind of bullcrap was this? If they kicked me out, I wouldn’t have anywhere to go.

My actions only caused Karma to fume even more though, her voice rising to an octave I’d never heard, “are you freaking crazy?! What the actual–"

“Karma.” My hand came up to calm her, but she was quick to grab it and turn it around for me to see.

“Winnie, just *look* at your nails!” she hissed. “Look at this and then look at the wall behind your bed, and tell me what you would do if you were in *our* shoes.”

My eyes traveled down to my bloodied fingertip, and my nightmare wound its way back to the forefront of my mind, invasive, like it was trying to force itself.

*‘Beautiful’*. I could still taste the word at the back of my mouth. Shaking my head, I turned my attention to the reason behind my clearly lapsing mental state. Each nail was ripped, jagged, and raw. I cringed a little at the sight. Then, I turned my attention to the wall. It was covered in a multitude of bloody scratches. I didn’t know whether to feel scared or mortified, but either way, both of those feelings were horrible. There was no way I could try and explain why I was clawing my nails to shreds, so I just stared, and nodded.

Nodding made everything better. I could appear like I was listening, occasionally making an acknowledging noise, while internally freaking out. “See?” Karma said, her brows creased in concern. “We just can’t do this anymore. You’re scaring the girls.”

With a silent nod, I slowly began to pack my things, shoving as much of it as I could into my suitcase. Karma watched for a moment, lingering in the doorway before she said, “we’ll give you until the end of the week to move out, but we really need you gone. With you around, none of us are getting any kind of sleep.”

What I really wanted to say was, *‘Yeah? Well, welcome to my world!’* What I said instead was, “Sure, I’ll be out of your hair by then.”

As soon as Karma stepped out of the doorway and her footsteps disappeared down the hall, I broke down and cried. Large, hot tears rolled down my cheeks, and a bit of snot coated my upper lip. It was pitiful. I angrily swiped my nasal excrement away and snatched up my phone. Maybe Noah would let me crash at his place for a bit?

As my eyes looked at the time though, I ran a hand over my face and blew out a frustrated breath. It was 5 AM. I didn’t even know if he would be awake at that time. Regardless, I pressed on his contact, hoping and praying that he would answer the phone.

“Hey, Winnie the Pooh! What’s up?” he said, his voice way too chipper for that early in the morning.

“Noah,” I whined. “I told you not to call me that!”

“Yeah, yeah! Whatever. What do you need? I’m in the middle of a gym workout.” His voice was light and playful, and part of me was almost thankful for that. I needed to hear something other than a scolding. Karma’s words still hung in my mind, and every time I thought about them, it burned.

“I - um… How do I say this?” I stumbled over my words a few times before Noah finally cut in.

“Win, what are you doing up this early anyway?” His voice was suddenly very soft. “Don’t tell me you had another night terror…”

“A bad one,” was all I said before I looked down at my nails and sniffled. “They probably think I’m a freaking psychopath, Noah."

“Hey, hey, hey, shhh,” he said, his voice smooth and reassuring. “Don’t say that. It’s going to be okay. You wanna come over to my place? I can leave the gym early. I was almost done anyway.”

“Actually,” I started. “I need a place to crash…” I wiped my eyes, sucking in a breath and said, “Karma finally kicked me out.”

“Just stay right there,” he said. “I’m coming to pick you up. Let’s grab some breakfast or something so we can get your mind off of this.” And then he paused, his tone soothing and warm. “And bring your suitcase with you. You’re more than welcome to crash at my place. I’ve got an extra bedroom with your name written all over it.”

“Thank you, Noah. I owe you one.”

I hung up the phone, sighed and leaned back against the wall, just a little bit of that weight falling off my shoulders. Noah was someone that I could always count on. Ever since we were kids, we were stuck like glue; inseparable.

Noah came from a very well-off family with a great reputation. My family was the complete opposite. I grew up on a farm and my parents lived paycheck to paycheck. We met in 1st grade, and ever since he traded me his juice box for my milk and punched Johnny Mayweather in the nose for calling me stupid, we quickly became best friends.

The second I heard a car honk, I swiftly grabbed my suitcase and lugged it over to the front door, but Noah was already there to take it from my hands. Karma was there too.

“Noah!” Karma beamed, her perfectly white smile gleaming up at him. “What in the world are you doing here?!”

What I failed to mention is that Noah is very conventionally attractive. He’s the quarterback of the football team, has quite the reputation for partying too hard and it was no secret that he failed basic algebra TWICE (sleeping with the teacher to pass). Needless to say, word got around about him and spread like wildfire. Girls loved his stereotypical messy blonde hair, brown eyes, and 6-foot-tall frame. They literally fall at his feet, and Karma was no exception.

Shooting Karma a look, Noah shoved past her and rolled the suitcase out to his car before he turned and said, “what does it look like?”

Karma shot me a disapproving glare before she scoffed and simply muttered, “rude.”

The moment we got into Noah's fancy little sports car and sped down the road, though, it didn’t take long for him to roll his windows down and turn up the radio.

My laughter filled the car as I watched him sing along to some old '80s song, his arm dangling out the window. The weather was nice that day, the fall air crisp and slightly warm. Sunlight filtered through the trees, making the leaves appear as if they were on fire. All of my prior worries were forgotten for just a moment, until something indescribably strange happened.

We sped over an old wooden bridge, and fear coursed through me as I noticed the car getting closer and closer to the edge, dangerously close to the water. I turned in my seat to face Noah and only noticed his facial expression for a moment, his eyes glazed over and his hands turning the wheel on their own accord.

And that’s when I heard it. The sound of something so melodic that it cut through every other noise around me. Something about it was… Bewitching. It took me only a moment before I realized that it was singing. The sound was like that of angels, except for the fact that as it continued to grow louder and louder, so did the amount of dread mounting in the pit of my stomach. My mind fought with my hands as I reached towards the steering wheel to correct our path, but that singing… Something about it called out to us. *“Come to me,”* it seemed to say. *“Come into the water, and join me, dancing in waves…"*

And then before I knew it, we were plowing past the wooden side rail and straight down. Strangled screams left my lips the second we face-planted into the water. Ice-cold terror erupted within me when it started to pour in through the windows, engulfing the car faster than I could have ever imagined. That feeling only multiplied when I noticed that Noah was still in a trance.

Desperation flooded my system as I yanked and tugged and pulled at his seatbelt. With one more gulp of air into my lungs, I tried to stifle my panic as our bodies were engulfed by the water. I clenched my eyes shut, my brows creased together in determination, as I tugged one more time and set Noah free. Relief washed over me as I wrapped my arms around him and swam as hard as I could towards the surface. My legs burned as I frantically kicked, and my air was running out. Everything was going blurry just before I felt something yank us to the surface.

The second I was able to take a breath, I desperately gasped for air. Exhausted, I laid next to Noah on the grassy embankment, my vision hazy and unfocused. Part of me was drifting in and out of consciousness when I noticed something strange in the water… A woman?

Fiery red hair cascaded over her shoulders like a waterfall. And then I heard voices, but I was in no position to fight. My eyes nonchalantly glanced down at my leg, and I cringed when I noticed a tattered mess of flesh, blood pooling beneath it. So, I did the only thing I could think of at the moment: I closed my eyes and played dead.

"Holy…” a man with a gruff, gravelly voice said. “Cass, I think you killed them." The explosive laugh made me flinch. "You did it! You killed a human!"

"I did not!" she hissed back. "It was an accident."

"That was not an accident."

"Well, you made me do it!"

"Oh, did I?"

"You're both insufferable," a third voice grumbled in a thick Australian accent.

“Oh, I'm the insufferable one?” The girl seethed. “What are you even doing out here anyway? Shouldn't you be at the front desk? You're on shift. I don't pay you to mess around, y'know. You're working."

"You don't pay me at all," he grumbled back. "And I'm on break. I was on patrol, and you idiots managed to body two humans, which, if you think about it, is kinda hilarious, considering Cass's *‘I only lure those who deserve it’* motto." His tone flew up in a mockery of her high pitched squeak.

I lost consciousness somewhere between their arguing, and my own muddled thoughts, which made me wonder if I had a concussion. Man, my head hurts.

A cacophony of hissed whispers, both of which from the two in question, slowly drew me from brain fog. I listened in, straining my ears to hear, the woman’s irritation only seeming to grow by the second. My attention shot to Noah, his coughing and sputtering surely alerting everyone to the fact that we were *very* much alive. A wince left my lips as I crawled over closer to him and applied some pressure to his arm. His wound was gaping, shiny with perspiration, a bloody, fleshy mess caught up between charred flaps of skin. It hit me that my friend was okay. Ish. I couldn't speak for internally, but he seemed mostly all right, except for a gash stretching across his left temple.

"We crashed…?" Noah's voice was a question mark slur, rolling off his tongue. He weakly pointed towards the woman in the water before mumbling, “I heard…”

Something wet and warm dripped from my nose, blood trickling from it in a steady stream. My hand quickly came up to swipe it away, frowning up at the shadows looming over us. Some of them had faces, while others danced as shuddering silhouettes, in my starry vision. “Who are all of you, people?” I don't know how I spoke, the words curling on my tongue felt like sandpaper. When neither of them replied, shooting glances at each other, like *What do we do?* I reiterated my question, this time with a stronger tone.

"Who…" I groaned, swiping at my head. "Are you?"

One of the men folded his arms, a smile curled on his lips. But his eyes were not friendly. He reminded me of a cashier mentally strangling his next customer. I could tell a fake smile from a mile away, and this guy was a connoisseur at pulling them. His eyes narrowed like I was a squirming thing under his shoe. His grin twisted up until I saw his perfectly white teeth, his incisors pointed and sharp. Fear clawed at me once again, and his smile only seemed to grow as he noticed this. *Who*… Or *what* were these people?

With a glance over at the scrap of metal that used to be a car currently sinking deeper into the water, I suddenly turned my attention back to the slicing pain in the back of my calf. The adrenaline was wearing off, and the pain I was feeling was excruciating. I bit back a cry, noticing that the same man took a slow step back, his nose flaring, the words ‘oh boy' curving on his lips. The manlier looking dude was quick to notice his reaction though, and shot him a glare before he muttered something under his breath. With quick strides, the guy decided to intervene.

He ripped strips from the bottom of his shirt, applying them to our wounds, tying them tightly, successfully creating a tourniquet. The girl cursed under her breath, peering over at him as he worked to rinse his hands of our blood before swiveling towards the other guy. His wandering gaze kept alternating between the bloody gash on my leg and Noah's arm. Through feathered vision, I was struggling to differentiate the two guys.

Hair and Teeth.

The guy trying to wrap my friend's wounds up was ‘Hair’, because, well, he was kinda hairy.

And ‘Teeth’ was the weirdo staring at the rapidly worsening blood flow sliding down Noah's face. Ouch. That had to hurt. I wasn't completely aware of my own injuries, until I noticed the tips of my fingernails glistening red, when I swiped at my forehead. While one of these guys seemed to stray back, frowning at Noah and I, the other wanted to help, unfazed by the intense pooling red dripping in a line down my best friend's temple.

The strange way this other guy was frowning at us made me uneasy. With a loud cough, I cleared my throat. "What are you looking at?"

He simply shrugged, pointed teeth peeking out again as a wicked grin spread across his features. "You're bleeding." He paused, eyes cutting over to Hair. “And you're making it worse, ya idiot."

"Ignore him! I know exactly what I'm doing." Hair gruffed out angrily, his jaw clenching, and his muscles tense. He almost appeared as if he was ready to spring into action.

*‘What is this?’* I wondered. *‘What in the world have we unknowingly stumbled into?’* I watched as the two of them engaged in a violent shoving match, with the woman, eventually tearing them apart.

"You are *not* helping," she gritted out, spitting at the two of them.

I ran a shaky hand over my face, laid back down and clenched my eyes shut before blinking them back open. Everything was spinning. Hair glared at Teeth one last time, baring his own sharpened canines as a warning. A low growl bubbled up from his chest, the sound frighteningly animalistic.

*‘What is it with these people?’* I thought. *‘Am I hallucinating from all the blood loss?’* As I tried to refocus my vision, I noticed the woman throw Teeth a glare before patting hair’s arm, motioning towards us. “Don’t let him get under your skin. Let’s just get these two back to the house.”

Between Noah and I, we both remembered bits and pieces. By the time we had awoken with our wounds wrapped and tended to, we easily came to the same conclusion. Once inside that place, there was a stench in the air that spelled trouble, and the overbearing feeling that I was being pulled down, dragged under ancient flooring, down, down, down, plunging into a darkness I *did* know, a hell that was familiar, and yet I was in denial of.

Both of us recalled being carried inside a monstrous Victorian house with a battered sign that read “Eternal Oasis.”

The only problem was, we couldn’t help but notice that something about this place just wasn’t quite right…
