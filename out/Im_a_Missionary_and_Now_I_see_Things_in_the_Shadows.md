My name is David.

Up until a few [months ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m3dofu/i_met_a_drifter_who_walked_out_of_the_darien_gap/)ago I found myself to be a normal, perfectly average fellow.  

I’m a Missionary, mostly working as a field medic where needed.  Rural hospitals, underfunded crisis areas, ect… 

But that changed a few months ago when I met a woman named Cassara.  It wasn’t so much that she was an above average height woman (about 188cm) but that she came from an unknown city occupied only by women known as “Penthasil.” 

We became unlikely travel companions when my mere offer to help her escape her fellow Penthasilians, who wanted her back, turned into a wild ride traipsing through the Caribbean.  

Our travels led us to many dark places, but the darkest of all was when I stepped into a place called The Guardian Temple.  

There, I ran afoul of a terrifying Angel, who was named Sofia, “The Sword of Samael.”

My encounter left me damaged, to say the least.  In an attempt to prove my worth, Sofia grabbed my hands, and refused to release me unless I managed to pass her test of spiritual fortitude.

I chose to break free of her by ripping my own arms off, but while I escaped, it came with a price.

My arms would have been listless and paralyzed, had the Angel Sofia not given me both a blessing and a curse: She replaced my arms with a pair of wings, forged from her own black feathers (she had white and red ones as well, a total of three pairs of varying wings).

Now I have no fear of losing my arms or hands completely.   But, no blessing is perfect, most of the time I barely feel my hands.  I cannot feel any delicate touches or sensations, and when I  do feel terrible shooting phantom pains.  

But, Sofia left me with a single command: “*Protect Cassara.”*

How I could protect her, I don’t know.  Cassara was more than capable of handling herself in a fight, and was a force to be reckoned with. She had pulled me from the fire more times than I could count, and I came to rely on her for her strength.  

Dare I say, she’s emboldened me more often than not. 

She proved more than capable aboard “The Baron” a ship I had originally negotiated a trip across the Caribbean with its captain, Junior. 

She also shocked me when she took on the task of handling some trouble that one crewmember, Kayode, found himself in.

A Cartel member had come after him when we docked in the Florida Keys, and without hesitation, Cassara killed the man swiftly, dumping his corpse off the dock with no remorse.

Her only payment requested was a case of rum.  

Said case’s contents now jostled in my back-pack as I followed behind Cassara on the docks leading from “the Baron” to the shore.

My legs were feeling uneasy, my stomach more so.  In part from the sudden shift from being onboard a ship for the past several weeks. Adding to that, was that I had just seen Cassara murder a man in cold blood mere moments ago.

The voice of Sofia remained fresh in my mind, “*Protect Cassara.”*

As I felt my feet hitting the wooden dock, and the constant phantom pains in my hands, I tried to wrestle with the concept.  “*How am I expected to protect her?!”*

Cassara’s confident footsteps seemed to indicate that she wasn’t in the least bit bothered and was heading out and to the mainland.

“*Protect Cassara?  She doesn’t need my protection, she’s been protecting me half the damn time!”* I thought to myself, wondering if the Angel Sofia was still testing me or not.

Cassara was walking ahead of me, having little to no issue getting past the few dock workers that we had run into.

I adjusted my backpack, my eyes darting around for any other suspicious persons.

Cassara had managed to clean her hands off of her victim’s blood shortly after dispatching him.  I still was in shock at what had happened.

Even with all the supernatural events, no one had died that didn’t deserve it.

Savannah had made some horrific deal with a demonic voodoo spirit, or whatever, but we weren’t the ones who killed her.

I wondered if she had killed someone before.  Her lack of concern, or at least her appearance of a lack of concern, seemed to indicate that this was not the first time she had to take such drastic measures. 

As we moved from the docks to the mainland, there was an officer scanning the docks here and there.

Cassara passed him by without even a first glance, but the officer’s hand pushed against my chest as I tried to pass by.

“Uh, can I help you officer?” I asked.

“Bag check,” He said, his eyes scanned over to my backpack as he pulled out a pair of latex gloves, “Open it, please?”

I gave a sigh and did as ordered.

“Where are you coming from?” The officer asked as he looked through my bag briefly, spotting the rum and giving me a suspicious glare. 

I knew better than to lie, as Junior had pointed out, I was indeed a shit liar.  “Missionary work in Cuba.”

“ID?” The officer asked swiftly.

I reached into my pocket and showed him my license and passport. 

He took my passport from me, looking me up and down, he repeated my full name, confused, “Is that your real last name?”

“Yessir,” I responded, “Nothing to do with anyone famous, I get it too often,” I explained as jovially as possible, doing my best to be polite while likely being interrogated over a bag full of rum, when I had just witnessed a murder about (/500 feet) back.

“Staying long?” he asked, ignoring my quip as he handed me my Passport back.

“Passing through,” I said, “The work never has me in one place for too long.”

“Must be thirsty work,” The officer said with a nod, “I’m rather thirsty myself.”

I cleared my throat unsure of what was implicating.

“If you give me a bottle, I’ll forget I saw the rest,” he looked me up and down, “Are we clear?” He said as he pulled the bottle out of my bag.

“Crystal,” I relented, as I forfeited one bottle, and prayed Cassara wouldn’t notice.

“Go on,” he said as he continued to scan the docks.

I heaved a sigh after I got off the docks.  My heart hammered in my chest.  

Along the busy boardwalk were many tourists and I realized that, in the chaos, I had lost Cassara.

*“Shit,”* I thought to myself as I looked through the crowds of people.

You’d think a 188cm(/6’ft 2’in) tall woman would stand out in a crowd.

As I scanned through the area, my eyes locked on to a young woman with stunning blue eyes and blond hair.

I felt my voice catch in my throat as I spotted her.

As she walked past the sidewalk, I could see I wasn’t the only person who was checking her out.  It was clear she wasn’t hating the attention either.

She wore a pair of maroon calf high boots, a summer dress, and not much else.  Her figure was curvy, her stature short, and I watched her sun kissed skin grow pale as she spotted me.

Her pause seemed to make everyone look my way.

I looked around, confused as I just tried to move out of the way.

Despite me walking on the other side of the street, the blond woman appeared frozen in shock at my presence. It was here something odd struck me. 

It was almost like there was a yellow steam around her body, and as I looked at her, she grew all the more nervous.  I flinched as I felt a pressure on my right temple.

She backed away from me.  But before I could look any closer  a large black guy grabbed my shoulder firmly, distracting me.

“Hey, buddy, leave the girl alone,” he barked.

I paused, “Hey, I don’t even know her, okay?” I shouted, pushing his arm off of me.

To my shock, I managed to shove the larger man back a good couple of paces before he stumbled down onto his ass.  A few others attempted to help him up as a crowd started to gain interest in the scuffle.

I’m not a fighter, and I certainly wasn’t looking for trouble.

The large man was pretty agitated as he got to his feet, pushing those assisting him away from him. 

Out of the corner of my eye, the blond woman turned on her heel and ran from me, turning down an alleyway quickly.  

Somehow, I knew she was fleeing specifically from me.

“Okay motherfucker, try that again!” the man who grabbed me shouted as he stormed over to me.

Cassara was by my side, “Quit puffing your chest out, fucker!” She snapped, “He knocked you on your ass, turn around and take the L.”

“You wanna throw down too, bitch?!” The sizable man growled at Cassara.

Cassara only cracked her neck, glaring at him intensely, “That’s up to you.”

The man looked around, seemingly searching for the woman who started all this, “man, fuck this shit…” he said as he stormed off.

I sighed in relief as Cassara slapped my shoulder, “Holy shit David, when did you learn how to handle yourself?!”

I looked up to Cassara, “Huh?”

“When I saw him charging up at you after that chick freaked out at seeing you, I thought I was going to have to rescue you again, but good on yah!  You knocked him on his ass!” Cassara chuckled, “Oh he was *pissed* too.”

I cleared my throat, rotating my shoulder a bit, “I guess I did,” I looked toward the alleyway where the woman had run off too.

“Hey,” Cassara snapped at me, “I saw her first.  You can call dibs if she’s not into me,” she snickered.

I frowned, “Uh, I’m more concerned with why she got spooked.”

Cassara’s joking subsided, “Yeah, I know.  Also she’s cute but she’s not *that* cute… she had everyone’s attention just walking down the street.”

I felt an odd itch in the back of my mind, but I shook my head, “No, it’s probably nothing.”

“Good on you,” Cassara said, “Stop trying to find trouble and it will stop finding us.”

I gave a nod, “Yeah yeah.  It’s probably nothing,” I pulled out my phone, “There’s a small motel I got for the night before our bus-ride.”

“The bus?  How luxurious,” Cassara quipped.

“You don’t have an ID to fly, Cass,” I whispered.

“Ugh,” Cassara shook her head, “Fine.”

“It’s not so bad.  From here we’re heading to Georgia,” I said as I looked to Cassara, “If you’re willing to follow me that long.”

“Follow *you?”* Cassara laughed, “You’re following me, David.”

I rolled my eyes as we walked through the boardwalk area.  

As we meandered through, I looked around to see if the blond woman was anywhere else.  So far, I hadn’t seen her.

That pain returned to my right temple, and as I closed my eyes for a moment, I tried to take a breath to steady myself.

As I did, the world seemed to slow down, and in an odd sort of flash, I could see with my eyes closed.

The ground, buildings, and sky all appeared in varying shades of light gray.  Pulsing with soft warm light.

But what I took away from this strange vision of the world wasn’t the scenery, it was the people within it.

I could see the people around us, their body’s almost a negative of their normal selves.  Wrapped around each was a different colored vapor, almost like steam surrounding them.

The colors seemed to vary based on their emotional states.  Some pleased and on vacation, others I saw as nervous or agitated.

Objects, oddly, appeared as nothing at all unless people were holding them.  I noticed this as one woman’s cell phone was in her hand, recording the bay. Her aura was calm, pleased, and happy.  Her energy focused around her hands more than anywhere else, encapsulating the phone.

A young boy, who was running in front of us, was panicking, his phone flying out of his hands, his essence basically reaching out for the device that was, to my closed eyes, completely black against the light gray backdrop of the ground and buildings.

I tried to move my hand forward, and noticed that my hand here wasn’t a hand, but the feathered wing that Sofia had left me with.

My feathers reached out to the phone, and they passed through it as if they had touched nothing.

I opened my eyes, the world moving back to normal speed, though my hand was reaching out to the young man’s cell phone.

I continued the motion, catching it quickly before it hit the ground.

“Woah!” the kid shouted, looking up at me, shocked.

“Uh, here,” I said, offering the phone back to him.

“Nice reflexes,” Cassara said, looking me over suspiciously, “Never saw you move that fast before.”

“Uh, just caught it out of the corner of my eye,” I fibbed, the pain had subsided now.

Cassara narrowed her eyes on me, “Uh-huh.”  It was clear Cassara didn’t believe me, but also that she wasn’t going to pry.

“Thanks Mister!” the young boy shouted before running back to his family.

Cassara’s expression was deadpan as she looked around, “How far is the motel?”

I cleared my throat, “not far.”  

The five minute walk to the motel was filled with an awkward silence.  

When we got to the small motel, it was clear why the place was so cheap.  

The front check-in was rather rundown, and the doors which lined the small brick buildings closed, but just barely in many cases.  

“Fancy,” Cassara commented.

“Well, it’s what you get for the ‘Free’ Missionary discount,” I cleared my throat as we walked into the check-in.

Cassara was silent as she followed behind me, looking through the small check-in area suspiciously as I approached the front counter.

My attention was grabbed by an odd machine across from the check-in area.  

It looked like some kind of touch screen Kiosk, but had a phone and dial pad at the bottom.  I lifted an eyebrow at the odd device.

“Dat dere’s a prison phone,” the rough voice of the large clerk behind the counter snapped, “Video conference for those on the inside for folks on the outside.”

I cleared my throat again, “Oh.  I didn’t know those existed.”

“Good fer you,” the clerk said, “Reservation or you payin’ cash?”

“Reservation, under ‘Cross’?” I replied.

The Clerk tapped on the computer for a moment or two before he sighed, “Ah, right.  The wife’s soft spot,” he shook his head, “Swear if I didn’t have an early check-out in that same room I’d be turning you away.  Ain’t got time to give shit away for free.”

I frowned, “Well I had spoken to-”

“I’m aware who yah spoke to,” The Clerk said curtly, “I find a single thing in that room out of place, I’m gonna take it outta yer ass, yah here?” He said, placing the key card on the counter, with the number I-3414.

“Anything we do would probably be an improvement,” Cassara growled.

“What did you say, girl?” The Clerk snapped as he stood up, towering over Cassara by a good 28cm(/9”in).

Cassara looked up to the large fellow, her hand placed firmly on the counter, “I said: ‘*Anything we do would probably be an improvement,’”* she then added, “for this shit-hole.”

The Clerk growled at Cassara.

“If we could just…” I said softly as I sneaked my hand under Cassara’s arm, grabbing the key-card discreetly.

“I’ll keep my eye on you two,” the Clerk hissed as he sat down, “As a note, don’t expect housekeepin’ to make-up yer room. Fresh sheets are in the closet.”

I gave him a nod, “Thank you, sir,” I looked to Cassara whose gaze was fixed firmly on the Clerk.

Cassara took her hand off the counter, keeping her eyes on the Clerk until we walked out of the check in room.

“You know, you don’t have to be confrontational about everything,” I explained.

“And you don’t have to let people walk all over you,” Cassara snapped back, “Let's just get to our room.”

We made our way to our room, sliding the key in the door a few times before it finally opened.

The room was, to put it mildly, pretty rough.

There were two beds, one was unmade, clearly slept in.  The Clerk wasn’t kidding when he said housekeeping wasn’t going to be making-up the room.

As I stepped in, the floor was oddly soft.  This was not carpet, but linoleum.  

The term ‘Squishy’ came to mind as I walked into the room.

“If anything moves in here that isn’t you or me, I’m sleeping outside,” Cassara threatened.

“It’s not that bad,” I countered.

“The cabins in Junior’s rusted old boat were more luxurious than this,” Cassara commented as she sat on the still made bed, “Dibs, by the way,” Cassara said as she turned to me, “You get to make your bed yourself.”

“Why’s that?” I said, trying to play off Cassara’s grabbing of the only clean bed as a friendly joke.

Cassara’s tone was far from pleased, “Well it’s the least you get for being dishonest.”

My stomach sank as I turned to her, moving to the closet near the bathroom, “Dishonest?”

“As Junior said, you’re a shit liar,” Cassara reminded me as she kicked her boots off, slowly sliding onto the bed.

I frowned, “I’m not lying about anything.”

“Bullshit,” Cassara snapped, “You’ve been acting weird for the last two weeks, and I’m not buying that it’s just because of what happened on Junior’s boat,” Cassara pulled her legs up on top of the blankets, “Something is up with you.  I can’t put my finger on it.”

I grabbed the handle to the closet, hissing through my teeth as the pine and needles jabbed into my hands, or at least that’s how it felt.  I couldn’t feel the knob itself, my hands and fingers still numb from Sofia’s ‘Gift’, “Okay, it’s really hard to explain but-” as I opened the door, something lunged out at me.

I was taken by surprise as a figure fell forward, tumbling onto me as I fell onto the floor.

The figure was human, or at least was at some point.  Its face was emaciated, the skin had the appearance of jerky, as if mummified.

The clothing on the figure was modern, nothing like an ancient mummy or anything.  But as it fell forward, the jaw opened, and its hand reached out towards me.

I tried to push the thing off of me, and I closed my eyes.

As I did, the world turned gray again.

All except for the corpse that was crawling on me.  

The energy that surrounded this thing was the very same as the blond girl I had seen on the street.  The one who ran away, but it didn’t cover it completely like it did normal people.

Its hollow eyes were filled with yellow steam, wisps off of the aura from her.  It curled around the corpse, like small strings, manipulating its limbs like a puppet, though the limbs looked as dark as any inanimate object.

It grabbed my arms, and to my shock I watched as its mouth opened.  It started to inhale, and my vision grew dimmer as it did.  

Now I saw wisps of red, mixed with white sliding off of me.  As it did, it mixed in with the sockets of the corpse, the grip grew stronger and it took another inhale.

I struggled as I tried to free myself from this thing’s grip, but I felt weaker and weaker as it pulled from me.

That’s when I saw Cassara rushing towards it.  Well, moving towards it.  

Everything was still in slow motion, but I saw Cassara’s energy as she grabbed the corpse by the shoulders.

Cassara’s energy was, to my shock, blue.  Her aura felt warm, despite this, and floating around her were smaller blue and red sprites.

As she pulled the thing off of me, I opened my eyes, hearing a groan and a clattering across the room.

“Holy shit!” Cassara shouted as she pulled me up from the floor, “David, you okay?” 

I struggled to my feet, feeling dizzy and weak.

The groan I heard from the other side of the room pulled my attention away from Cassara.

I watched in horror as the creature rose to its feet.  Its body looked far less dry and crusty by the minute.  Slowly it seemed more human, the sunken eyes pushing out with black irises as the dried hair slowly grew far less dry and crumbling.  

Now, only slightly chapped lips smacked as it swallowed, straightening itself.  

Though the clothing it was dressed in was still a very poor fit, the figure now just appeared as a very malnourished man.  His eyes fixed on me as a black tongue licked his dry lips, “More…” he hissed, taking labored steps towards us, “Give me… More!” 

The man lunged towards me, only for Cassara to leap forward, kicking her foot out firmly to his chest, knocking him further away and landing him firmly on the floor with a loud, yet moist, thud.

For any other man, or living being, that would have been enough to knock it out.

Instead it clamored to its feet, let out an inhuman wail, and crawled up the wall.

I was frozen in horror as Cassara rushed to the thing, “Oh hell no!  I’ve seen too many fucking Zombie movies for this shit!” 

The creature pushed the window open, and was most of the way out by the time Cassara grabbed its foot.

It struggled as Cassara pulled it back inside, “Come on you walking corpse, get back here so I can rip your fucking head off!”

The creature grabbed Cassara’s hand, its eyes glowing yellow as it opened its mouth in front of her, inhaling.

Cassara’s eyes went wide, and I realized it was doing exactly what it did to me when it had fallen on top of me.

It was feeding off of Cassara’s [essence](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple/).
