*THE MOST TERRIFYING THING YOU WILL EVER EXPERIENCE. DO YOU DARE?*

That was the exact phrase that had been printed onto the flyer.

I had stumbled out of a bar one night, preparing to walk back to my apartment when I noticed it. The flyer had been stapled to a telephone pole, nearly buried beneath several others. Halloween was coming up, so I’d already seen plenty of advertisements for various kinds of haunted houses.

But this one stood out, largely due to how different it looked from the rest.

I guess you could’ve called it a barebones design. Other than the slogan, which was in large, bold letters, the only thing that had been printed on there was an email address near the bottom.

Strange. But I liked it. It intrigued me.

I took a picture of it and once I got home, I sent an email stating that I’d seen the flyer and was curious as to what this was all about.

They got back to me the next morning.

*Hey there!*

*Glad we’ve caught your interest. We’re a new startup company that aims to deliver revolutionary horror experiences. Think about the classic haunted house you’d find at fairs or in your local community. They’re fun for the family. A good option for a first date. But have you actually ever been scared by one of these?*

*What we’ve developed here transcends that. What we’re offering is an opportunity to experience true, primal fear. Are you brave enough to find out what we have in store?*

I thought it was a bit corny at first. How are you going to shit on the very concept of a haunted house when that’s exactly what you were marketing?

But as skeptical as I was, I still reckoned that it could be something worth checking out. I hadn’t been to a haunted house in a while. Maybe they really did have a unique spin on it. I replied, stating that I was indeed brave enough to check it out. That I’d like to know more about what they were offering. This time they got back to me within the hour, providing a more in-depth explanation.

Essentially their twist on the conventional haunted house was that it wouldn’t take place in a house at all. Not some makeshift DIY thing either. They were going to set it up in an abandoned building near the edge of the city.

But there was another layer to it. Because apparently nobody knew what the building had actually been used for. Why it existed at all. There were even rumors that it just appeared one day out of thin air. That it wasn’t even manmade.

I wasn’t sure what that was supposed to mean, but it was pretty decent marketing. That much I couldn’t deny. But things have gotten expensive these days and it’s left me with a pretty tight budget. And with what sounded like such an elaborate setup, I had my doubts that I’d be able to afford the entrance fee.

I brought this up to them in my next email and they told me that it wouldn’t be a problem. That I wouldn’t actually need to fork up any cash at all because they’d be the ones compensating me for my time. $400 cash, to be disbursed at the end. Because technically the project was still in its developmental phase. That this was only going to serve as a test run. An “experiment”.  

They assured me that they had implemented rigid safety protocols. That they themselves had gone through it several times and could say with confidence that there was no risk of anybody getting hurt.

At this point, I honestly couldn’t believe my luck. Because quite frankly, the money would’ve been real nice. I suppose that I was ecstatic enough that I had stopped analyzing the situation through a critical lens. But I don’t know. What would you have done if you were me? Would you have questioned things more? Be honest with yourself.

I sent a reply telling them that I was in. To go ahead and tell me exactly what I needed to do.

Their reply was short, to the point. Just a set of coordinates, along with a time and date. And also a note stating that they’d cover any travel expenses so long as we kept our receipts.

9AM on October 26th. I put the coordinates into Google and it turned up a 35 minute drive out to an area that I’d never been before. Looked like some country road with a forest on one side and a large cornfield on the other. But I didn’t see a building. Which bothered me for reasons that I couldn’t really comprehend at the time. Just not nearly enough to dissuade me altogether.

I asked them if I could bring somebody along and they told me that I could. But that they only had one spot left and it was first come first serve.

I considered asking my girlfriend, Luna, but realized that the idea of driving out to some abandoned road to enter some sketchy building might not be terribly appealing to her. So then I thought about who might really need the money and it was an obvious choice.

My friend Josh. Met him in college and we’d been good friends ever since. It’s been nearly six years since we’d graduated and I don’t think he’s ever worked at the same company for longer than three months. And over these past few years, I don’t think he’s been working at all. You know those reels where the caption’s like “your unemployed friend on a Tuesday afternoon” and it’s some guy feeding a llama in a jungle or something. That’s him. He has no car, lives in a shitbox studio with no furniture. How he even has the money to pay for rent or food, I couldn’t begin to guess. “Savings” he tells me. Whatever that means.

Predictably, Josh seemed pretty enthused by the idea when I brought it up. He almost sounded relieved.

On the morning of the 26th, I picked him up and we drove all the way out there. Based on the story so far, you may be under the impression that I’m not the brightest. But I’m not a complete idiot either. I let Luna know exactly where I was going, told her that if I wasn’t picking up my phone at around noon, then something might be up.

We arrived at the coordinates at around 8:40. It really was just a random spot on the road. There was a small clearing in the forest where a few cars were already parked. So I followed suit and backed my Nissan into it.

After parking, we got out. The air was cold and crisp and the skies above were a deep blue. We looked around at the four people who were already there. One of them was a younger girl, maybe in her late teens or early twenties, wearing a jacket with the hood pulled up, athletic leggings, sneakers. She was sitting on a tree stump with her arms crossed. And then there was a couple that appeared to be in their thirties, sitting on the hood of their car. They both seemed to be mildly annoyed, and I couldn’t tell if it was because of each other or if they were actively regretting their decision to be there.

Finally there was a guy that could’ve been in his early or mid twenties. Tall and lean with sharp features, his hair bleached and buzzed close to the scalp, a tattoo of what appeared to be a tiger on his neck. He was dressed in what I can only describe as “tactical” streetwear.

And he was the only one that acknowledged our existence. He walked over to us with this huge grin on his face and shook both of our hands.

He introduced himself as Kijoon, told us that he was visiting from Korea for the week. We asked him why he’d chosen to come here out of all places. Since our city was far from being anything close to a tourist destination.

He explained that this “haunted house” was actually an urban legend of sorts. But one that had more credibility than most others. Because there were actual, official police reports detailing cases where people had gone missing after entering the place. Ones that had since been scrubbed from public records.

I asked if he’d actually read these reports himself. He said that he hadn’t. That they were pretty hard to find. But that he was really into this sort of thing. The weird, the strange, the dangerous. So he’d done as much research as he could and found some contacts in America who clued him on in this place. And now he was here.

I wasn’t sure whether I really believed him. I looked at Josh and could tell he was feeling something similar. That Kijoon might’ve been somebody hired by the company and given a script to try and freak us out. And if that had been the case, it was kind of working right then.

But before we could ask him anything else, another vehicle pulled up.

A black Mustang. New and shiny. It parked against the hill leading down to the clearing before two young guys climbed out of it, both wearing college football jerseys.

They both appeared to be drunk, perhaps also high on coke. They were laughing, stumbling over their feet as they made their way towards us.

They told us that their names were Chad and Harrison and we spent a painful few minutes trying to have a conversation with them before somebody walked out of the forest.

A sharp looking guy in a suit. Maybe early thirties. Looked like he belonged in a board room somewhere. Thinking about it now, I don’t think I actually heard or saw him coming out of the woods. He sort of just appeared.

He introduced himself as Sinclair, the CEO of the startup. He told us how nice it was to meet everyone and that he’d be the one guiding us over to the building.

Kijoon raised a hand, asked him what the actual name of the startup was.

Sinclair smiled, told him that it was still a work in progress. That he wasn’t at liberty to divulge much in the way of details. After he’d answered, Kijoon looked over at us and raised his eyebrows, as if to signal “hey isn’t that fucking weird.”

And it was. This whole thing was extremely bizarre and only now was I starting to realize it.

At the same time, I figured that maybe it was all part of the show. That it was meant to be as immersive as possible. And in that case, they were doing a hell of a job.

I looked around at the others. Chad and Harrison seemed too drunk and coked out to really give a shit. The couple appeared to be quietly arguing with each other, which kept them preoccupied. From eavesdropping in on their conversation, I learned that their names were Liam and Deb. The girl in the jacket was stone-faced, staring blankly ahead. It was hard to tell what she was thinking. And then of course there was Kijoon.

Sinclair asked if there were any more questions and Josh raised a hand, asked why we hadn’t just met at the building directly. Sinclair told him that there were no roads leading to it. That it would be difficult to find without a guide who knew exactly where they were going.

Josh asked what that was supposed to mean.

Sinclair told him that we’d all find out soon enough.

He told everybody to come with him before turning around and walking into the forest.

We all hesitated for a moment before following. We walked along a rough trail for about a half hour before arriving at a huge, unnatural-looking clearing.

And there it was. An actual building in the middle of the woods. It was about the size of a small corporate office, painted dark grey. Three stories tall. The strangest thing about it was that it didn’t even look terribly dilapidated. Not that it looked brand new or anything. Sections of the paint had started to peel, and a few of the windows were cracked. But it really didn’t seem like it had been abandoned for long. It looked like it could’ve been functional just a few years prior.

But functioning as what? What the hell was it doing out here?

“Well, this is it,” Sinclair said.

We all stared at him. For a while, nobody said a word. Even the cocaine bros had been rendered silent.

“So… this is something you guys built?” Liam asked him. “I mean, are you really sure its safe?”

Sinclair looked at him.

“I can assure you that we’ve done our due diligence and that there’s absolutely nothing to be worried about,” he said. “We’ve cleared all the debris, accounted for any electrical hazards, unstable floors, everything. Nothing to worry about.”

Liam didn’t seem so convinced. But then Deb nudged him.

“This was *your* idea,” she whispered through gritted teeth. “So relax.”

She paused, took another look at the building. “Besides, this might be interesting.”

Liam rolled his eyes, then looked back at Sinclair.

“You know if anything goes wrong, there’s gonna be hell to pay. I haven’t signed any waivers yet and I’m not going to.”

Sinclair put his hands up in a playful defensive gesture. “I hear you. I understand. But there’s really nothing to worry about. Nothing to sign. That’s how much we trust it.”

“But you didn’t answer my first question,” Liam continued. “Did you guys build this? It looks awfully expensive for what you’re trying to do here.”

“We didn’t build it,” Sinclair told him. “As expressed in prior communications, we don’t know who built this place. We don’t know where it came from.”

Liam scoffed. “So is this like, still part of the act? Or are you being serious? I can’t tell anymore.”

Sinclair stared at him. “We really don’t know.”

Chad and Harrison began laughing.

“This is some freaky ass shit,” I heard one of them say.

“Any more questions or concerns?” Sinclair asked us.

Silence followed. Sinclair’s smile returned and he reached into his pocket and pulled out an envelope. He opened it up, revealing a stack of $100 dollar bills.

“As stated, your compensation will come out to $400. $200 up front and then the other $200 once we’ve finished everything up. So please form a line.”

We did just that, each taking our promised amount. I could see Josh’s eyes lighting up as his fingers touched the cash.

Once everybody had gotten their money, Sinclair led us over to one of the building’s entrances.

“It’ll be a simple process,” he told us. “Go inside, follow the red arrows that have been taped to the walls until you’ve reached the exit. It should take around thirty minutes in total. I’ll be waiting at the end.”

With that, he walked off to the side and gestured for us to enter. I’d be lying if I said my expectations hadn’t been set high at this point. The entire build up had been unlike anything I’d ever experienced before. My heart was beating heavy. I was excited.

Inside, it just looked like any bog standard office. Though the harsh incandescent light did give it an eerie, liminal vibe. I supposed that was the angle they were going for. No cobwebs, no pots of boiling blood, no skeletons hiding underneath floorboards waiting to jump out and grab your ankles.

Just an empty building. But there was something strange about it. A subtle feeling. It wasn’t just the fact that it was deep inside a forest. There was something else. Something hard to identify. Something uncomfortable.

I reckon everybody else started feeling it as well. Because nobody was saying a word.

But we sucked it up and began following the tape down the first corridor. It stretched on for a good bit before we turned into another one. And then another. After traversing through several more identical looking corridors, we realized what was wrong with the place.

The layout didn’t make any sense. Just a bunch of hallways with no actual rooms. It was almost disorienting.

And this is the point where Chad told us that he was heading back. That he wouldn’t go any further.

We turned to look at him. He’d already started lagging well behind the rest of the group, his face painted with a pretty earnest expression of terror. Harrison asked him what was wrong.

He looked at the floor then at the walls and then back at us. He shook his head.

“I’m not going any further,” he repeated.

Before we could say anything else, he’d turned and walked away, disappearing around the corner.

“Hey man!” Harison called after him. “What the hell are you doing?”

He then shook his head. “The fuck’s his problem?” he muttered to himself.

“Aren’t you gonna go after him?” Kijoon asked.

Harrison shook his head. “Fuck that. I need the money.”

We ventured on. After five or six or maybe ten more corridors, I was starting to get the itch to turn back as well.

There wasn’t even any explicit threat. Just this constant, relentless feeling of “what the fuck is going on?”

I asked Kijoon what he thought about it. But he didn’t answer. Instead he seemed to be fixated on one of the walls.

After a while, I realized why.

There was no tape. On either of the walls. I couldn’t recall a point where I’d consciously took stock of the fact that the arrows were no longer there. I guess we just hadn’t been paying attention.

I looked back down the corridor we’d just walked through and saw that there was no tape behind us either.

Had we just been moving around aimlessly? And for how long? Why hadn’t we noticed?

“Alright, there’s no fucking way that we’re lost in here,” Liam declared. “The building wasn’t that big from the outside.”

“I don’t like this,” Deb said to him. “Let’s get the hell out of here.”

“Oh, *now* you want to leave?”

“Are you gonna tell me you want to fucking stay?”

He thought about it for a moment and then shook his head. “Hell no.”

They turned around, began walking away.

“Hey, that’s not the right direction!” Kijoon called after them.

Josh looked at him. “What are you talking about? That’s where we came from.”

Kijoon stared back at him. “Are you sure?”

I looked around and tried to figure it out for myself.

And I realized I wasn’t sure. Without the arrows, everything kind of just looked the same. But I told myself that wasn’t a problem. Walk around enough and eventually we’ll make it out. Right? But for whatever reason, I couldn’t seem to convince myself that this was the case.

“You guys are overreacting,” Harrison told us. “We came from there,” he pointed behind us. “So we’re obviously we’re supposed to go there,” he then pointed ahead.

His voice was loud but there wasn’t much confidence behind it. But at the same time, we couldn’t really argue with him. We had to go *somewhere.*

So we walked on.

More and more corridors. Soon fifteen more minutes had passed. And still no sign of an exit or a room or even a dead end. Was it possible that we were just continuously traversing through a loop? I started keeping track of the turns we were taking.

Left. Left. Right. Left. Left. Left. Right. Right.

Clearly we weren’t. I took out my phone to find that the signal was dead. I asked around and so was everybody else’s.

Ten more minutes and now the panic had turned into one hell of a thing. The space was starting to feel claustrophobic, almost threatening. Harrison had started jogging ahead and we struggled to keep up with him. I looked over at Kijoon, seeing that the excitement once present in his face had been drained almost completely away, replaced with this sense of cautious bewilderment

After what must’ve been our hundredth turn, there finally came a change in the scenery.

A single window, sitting at the end of yet another corridor. It was the first window that we’d seen the entire time that we’d been in there, so it was quite the jarring visual.

But it was also a potential way out.

We began walking towards it when the girl in the jacket told us not to. That we needed to turn around and get away from it as soon as possible.

It was the first time that we’d ever heard her speak. Up until that point, she’d just been following silently along. We weren’t really sure what her deal was, but I suppose we had been too preoccupied to ask.

Harrison looked at her. “What? What the fuck are you talking about?”

“We shouldn’t go near any windows,” she told him. “We should turn around.”

“Or what? What’s gonna happen?”

“I don’t know exactly,” she said. “But probably nothing good.”

Harrison shook his head. “Yeah, fuck that. And fuck the money. I’m getting out of here.”

He marched towards the window, with Josh and Kijoon following close behind.

I stayed back and asked the girl how she knew that going near the window would be dangerous. She told me it was a long story. That she’d explain it later but for now we really needed to leave.

“If they aren’t going to listen to me, then go over there and convince them,” she said to me. “If we don’t leave soon, then I’m going on my own. That window is not a way out.”

I could see her expression crack. A quiver in her lip. She was almost pleading. If she wasn’t dead serious, then she was one hell of an actor. I asked her if she was aware of something that we weren’t. If she knew something that we didn’t.

“We don’t have time for me to explain it all to you,” she said. “We need to leave.”

I really didn’t want to believe her. I wanted to believe that window was really was a way out. And in that moment, I managed to convince myself that her words were just fear manifesting into paranoia.

I turned away from her and walked over to the window. The others were all huddled up against it and I asked them what they were seeing.

Josh turned around. He looked both confused and horrified.

“Take a look.”

He made some space for me, and I squeezed in. And at first it felt like my brain was short-circuiting. Outside, there were no trees, no brush. Just a wide, open field blanketed by heavy fog. Definitely not the forest we’d come in from.

Kijoon suggested that maybe it was painting.

But if you took a good look at it for more than a few seconds, you’d realize that it definitely wasn’t. The mist was moving, slowly rolling forward. Wind blowing through the grass.

Harrison suddenly backed up, delivered a hard kick to the glass. It didn’t crack. It didn’t even shake. It just a made a dull, thudding noise. As if it were solid concrete disguised as a window.

He shook his head, tried kicking it again. And then again and again. But then he stopped, started squinting at something through the glass.

We asked him what he was seeing. He told us to take a look for ourselves.

At first, the fog made it difficult to tell exactly what it was. Just some vague shape in the distance, getting steadily closer.

So we all stood still and just stared at it. I guess we were too shocked to really do anything else. But soon it was close enough that we could tell it was human shaped. A man. Sprinting right towards us. He was naked and his skin appeared to be burnt. He had long, wild hair that was sticking out at odd angles.

We began to back away. I turned around and saw that the girl was already gone.

The man continued barrelling towards us and soon we could make out some of his more peculiar features. Like the fact that his arms were so long that his fingers were scraping the top of the grass.

We didn’t wait for him to get any closer and we turned and ran.

As we rounded the first corner, we could hear the glass break, something heavy smacking down onto the floor. We ran faster, though it quickly became clear that Harrison was the fittest amongst us. He turned around, shouted at us to catch up. But we were unable to. Soon he was out of sight, leaving us in the dust.

My lungs were burning and my legs felt like steel. I just tried to push forward.

Something that sounded like a hoarse croaking reverberated through the corridors, accompanied by the sound of dense, uneven footsteps. It was hard to tell exactly how far away they were. But certainly close enough for me to start losing my shit.

The three of us turned another corner and then skidded to a stop. There was a door in the wall. The first door we’d actually seen in this place, apart from the entrance.

We stared at it as we caught our breath, listening to footsteps and the croaking growing closer. Then we stared at each other, all coming to a mutual understanding. The door likely wasn’t going to lead us anywhere we wanted to be. But we couldn’t run forever.

We opened it up and rushed in, slamming it shut behind us.

We found ourselves standing in complete darkness. For a while we didn’t move. Didn’t make a noise. We just held our breaths, listening to the footsteps as they continued to close in on us, praying that they’d run right past.

Which thankfully they did. But even after they had long faded away, we remained standing there, still terrified to move.

It took a while for us to feel secure enough to move and speak freely. Once we did, we took out our phones and turned on our flashlights, illuminating a room that looked like something ripped straight from some obscure nightmare.

The walls and floor appeared to be made out of old, severely rusted metal. We hadn’t really taken stock of the smell at first. But now it was heavy, delivering an assault on our senses.

The room was no bigger than a standard high school classroom. But it was completely empty, the only thing in there apart from the door we’d entered through being two sets of stairs. One leading up, the other leading down. Neither option seemed particularly enticing and we began to argue about what to do next. We first decided to try leaving the room, gambling on the idea that we wouldn’t have to run into whatever the hell had broken through the window.

But when we tried to open up the door, we weren’t able to. It had locked itself from the inside. We tried forcing it open by taking turns slamming our shoulders into it, but it never came close to budging.

So we settled on going up instead. We began climbing the stairs. And we just kept climbing. It took us far too long to realize what was wrong. Because we should’ve reached the second floor long ago. Even if these stairs went all the way up to the third, we should’ve been there at that point. The building could not have been more than thirty or forty feet tall. And we had been walking for over twenty minutes.

We also noticed that the air had grown thicker. It was becoming difficult to breath.

We began retreating down the steps. And once again, the stairs wouldn’t end. Not after thirty minutes. Not after an hour. I could hear Josh starting to hyperventilate and I tried to calm him down. Eventually he did.

And then we just sat there. We were exhausted, mentally whipped. Kijoon’s phone was the first to die. And then so did Josh’s. Now we were down to one light and it wouldn’t be much longer before we were in the dark.

After a while, we could hear footsteps moving up towards us.

We stood up, ready to sprint again when a familiar voice called up to us.

“Wait! It’s me.”

I angled my light down the steps and it revealed the girl in the jacket. But I was too paranoid at this point to fully accept that this wasn’t some kind of a trick. So I continued to back away.

“Don’t freak out,” she continued. “It’s me. It really is.”

She seemed earnest enough. I asked her where she’d been this entire time.

She shook her head. “I don’t know. Just around, I guess.”

I asked her what the hell that was even supposed to mean. And why she seemed so relaxed.

“Look, I’ll tell you, but we need to get out of the stairs first,” she told me. “It’s dangerous here.”

I told that her to tell us what she knew about this place that we apparently didn’t. That if it might help us escape this place alive, we deserved to know.

She took a deep breath. And then she told us that her name was Nadia. Some time ago, her brother, Anton, had gone into one of these. And he hadn’t come back out. I asked her what “one of these” was supposed to mean. She explained that this place can appear in different locations and can take on different forms. The one that her brother had gone into had been in a different city altogether.

He’d also been part of a group of eight. And out of those eight, only three had been seen again. Two of them had made it all the way to the end while the third had left very early on. Her brother’s girlfriend, Dixie, had been one of the two that had made it to the end.

“So this place ends?” Josh asked her, hopeful.

She nodded. “Eventually it should. According to Dixie. We just have to deal with a lot of shit before it finally does.”

As she was speaking, I felt a sudden flash of anger. I asked her why the hell she hadn’t stopped us from coming in here in the first place. If she was privy to all this information, why didn’t she just tell us from the get-go?

“Would you have believed me?” she replied. “If I’d caused a scene out on that road and told everybody that this was some fucked up dangerous place, would you have believed it? Or would you have thought I was psycho or paid to promote the place or something?”

I thought about it for a while. And I really wasn’t sure.

I then asked her why she’d decided to come back herself.

She said it was to try and find Anton. She didn’t think he was dead. Just trapped in here somewhere. She said she was going to get him out. She’d gotten as much information out of Dixie as possible and then went and did some of her own research. But she’d gone a lot deeper than Kijoon had, managing to track down firsthand accounts of others who had entered and survived the place. Though a lot of it ended up being incoherent, their memories of the place being scattered, hazy, unconsciously repressed.

But what she was able to conclude from all of it was that you if you ever found yourself in here, you just had to keep going. Even when the desperation hits and you’re terrified and things seem hopeless, you just keep going. Because eventually the place will let you go. But only after you’ve proved to it that it isn’t going to be able to break you. It could take hours, maybe days. But you had no other option.

She also mentioned that if anything seems even remotely dangerous in here, it most certainly is.

She then told us that we needed to get moving. Back up the stairs. We asked why up and not down. She said that’s just what she’d read from the reports. Something about how once you were in the basement, you were basically in hell and you were never getting out.

It was a lot to take in and process. But we felt it best to just listen to her.

So we began moving back up the stairs.

I think I’ll stop it there for now. I still have a lot to tell you all but I’ve gotten a bit tired typing this all out. I’ll update when I can.
