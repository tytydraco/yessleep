I want some help understanding this, because I'm finding it hard to tell if what's happening is real, my imagination running wild, or simply a technical glitch. I'll give as much background as I can to describe the situation as well as my mental state, as I'm genuinely stumped as to what's been going on.

The past few years I have been working from home. During the pandemic I got a customer service job based in another city. The company hired people from all over when their office was forced to close, and when everything opened up again, they chose to go fully remote. It works well for me, I'm quite a shy person and prefer to keep to myself, although it has made me quite lazy.

I've always been a people-pleaser, an overthinker and I seem to be a magnet for people who take and take but give little or nothing in return. My last relationship ended last July, but I still don't feel fully healed. I was gaslit so much, made to believe I did things I never did, and made to feel like my memories of the treatment I got were in my head. In spite of all this, I tried to have good terms with my ex after breaking up, but she told me she was not in a position to have any kind of friendship with me. She even told me she was having sleep paralysis regularly with me appearing as the demon.

Much of what she said and did hurt me a lot. Therapy helped me overcome some things, but I stopped going the first time I made real progress. I told myself I could handle things from here, but the thoughts and my own bad dreams came back, stronger than ever. I'll go back soon, but for now it feels kind of daunting.

I moved to a new house in December. I needed somewhere with more space, since the bedroom in my last house was tiny and I was spending 8 hours a day at a desk a few feet from my bed. Cabin fever was setting in and I needed a change. The new place is far more spacious. I have a huge bedroom with an en-suite bathroom and a walk-in wardrobe that I've converted into an office. It makes such a difference just to have a door between where I work and where I sleep.

It's a 2-bedroom house. My space is the entire ground floor, upstairs is the living room and kitchen, and my housemate is on the second floor. He was really friendly and welcoming when I moved here first, but has become a bit strange recently. I think he's paranoid, but I guess we all have been going through difficult times so I don't judge too harshly and keep to myself mostly.

For the first few months I lived here, I felt so drained all the time. For the first week or so I put it down to just getting settled in to a new place. I wasn't sleeping much and every noise I heard was new to me. Over time I got used to the place, and started to get more sleep, but my energy levels remained low. I would wake up 5 minutes before starting work and clock in just on time, shower and eat on my lunch break, get through the day, and once I clocked out, I always just lay on my bed doomscrolling before passing out after about an hour. Despite getting 12 hours sleep per night, I was still waking up tired and I could not understand it.

One morning I woke up feeling especially exhausted. I checked the time - 9:10, I was late for work and had a meeting with my manager 5 minutes later. I jumped out of bed, pulled on a shirt, clocked in and joined the meeting just in time. My boss was updating me about a new initiative HR were announcing. During the meeting he stopped mid-sentence, looked closely at me and asked if I was OK. I explained I was really tired lately and not feeling 100% but that I would perk up as the day went on.

He continued to explain the new initiative - HR set up a wellbeing committee and were running a steps challenge. 10,000  steps per day for the month of April, and once you entered, you were sent a new smart watch as a gift, and to encourage you to be more active. I'd seen these kinds of challenges before and hated the idea, but at that moment I felt like this was a sign and a way out of the rut I was in. I told my manager to sign me up. It was starting in two days and the watch should arrive within a week.

Right before we finished, he told me to take a 15 minute break to clean myself up before starting. To be fair to the guy he does look out for us.

I went to the bathroom and had a look in the mirror, there was a long brownish-red streak smeared across my cheek. Blood? I think so. I must have had a nosebleed in my sleep and from moving around, it smeared across my face. Damn. I had a shower, made myself more presentable and apologised to my boss. Kind of embarrassing but he was sympathetic, he wanted me to see a doctor but I knew it was just a once off.

After work I thought more about the steps challenge. I looked it up and 10,000 steps is about 5 miles. It felt like a lot, but I told myself that even if I do one mile each day, at least it's better than nothing, right?

I decided that evening I would start getting some preparation in. I'd go for a walk instead of going straight to bed. I set up a step counting app on my phone and headed out. It's a 10 minute walk to the local park, 15 to the supermarket. I wanted to try a new route so I turned left and headed uphill. After 5 minutes of walking, already out of breath, I found myself in a neighbourhood that seemed a bit rundown. I thought about how this area is so close to the idyllic peaceful part of the city I lived in and that juxtaposition.

I noticed a vandalised poster of someone's missing pet dog. Someone had drawn X's over poor Luna's eyes and drawn a speech bubble saying "I'm already dead lol". What is wrong with people?

I walked a little further and saw a group of young people with hoodies and baseball caps up ahead looking in my direction. I decided not to approach, turned and walked home, excited to check my step count when I got back.

2,000. I was disappointed at first, but vowed to increase it the next day, and build up over the first week of the challenge towards the 10,000 step target. I hopped in the shower and after it I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.

*I'm at a resort hotel. I get out of the elevator on the 2nd floor instead of the 14th. The CEO of my company stands smiling at the door of a conference room. Blood streaks the walls and the carpet. There's blood on his hands. Behind him the door is now ajar. There's a forensics team removing a body and inspecting the area. He tells me that sometimes getting rid of the opposition requires force.*

*I'm outside at a waterfront bar with my colleagues. My ex and her new partner are nearby. As soon as I notice them panic breaks out. I hear gunfire. I run to the water's edge and don't know where to go from there. I'm on elevated ground. I see soldiers and hails of bullets in the distance. I hear screams and cries of 'war' and 'run'. I look to the water. I don't know where to go*

I woke up, sat bolt upright and checked the time. 22:23. I was asleep for less than an hour. I checked her social media. She posted a video with the lyrics of '*Happier than ever'*. The week before it was *'All too well'*.

I was going to go upstairs for a glass of water but I heard the door opening. My housemate returning from a date and I heard his and her voice laughing. A successful night for him. He told her this is where the 'Vampire' sleeps and I heard a light tap on my door. He told her he keeps his door locked at night and they laughed and one of them shushed the other. I thought about downloading dating apps again as I lay back down. Time to move on.

The first two days of April I took 1,500 and 3,000 steps. I got back on dating apps and planned to get a drink with a girl on Friday. My confidence was growing. I was chatting to another girl who was out of town. I'd meet her soon too. On the Friday, my watch came in the mail. Just in time for the date and my weekend. Even though I still felt burnt out, I was in a positive mood on Friday, excited for the date that night. I showered on my lunch, sprayed almost an entire can of deodorant on myself after finishing, and headed out to the bar.

The girl I met was beautiful. Marie. I knew from her bio she worked in localisation and spoke 4 languages fluently. I got drinks, brought them to the table and started to tell her about my day. I noticed she didn't look interested so I changed topic. I spoke about the steps challenge and how I'm trying to be more active. Again she was nodding, but looked bored. I started to ask about her, what she likes to do for fun. She said "This", and leaned in and kissed me. At first I felt uncomfortable, but I got in to it. "I still got it!", I thought.

After 5 minutes kissing with barely-touched drinks at the table she whispered in my ear "Why don't we continue this at your place?" My heart sank. I never thought I would be in this position that night. I thought about my room, where I had been spending so much of my time the last 4 months. I was so exhausted I hadn't stayed on top of laundry. When did I last change my bedsheets? Not sure. Did I throw out the wrappers from those snacks I had at my desk for the past week or were they still sitting there... "Or we can go to mine" she laughed, and I felt relief.

We got a cab back to her place and went to her room. Again there wasn't much talking. It had been a long time for me, I felt a mix of excitement and guilt, pleasure mixed with uncertainty. I felt the speed of her grinding on me grow faster, her breaths getting more intense and her moans louder. I was still completely in my head, overthinking about the situation and wasn't even close. She got up and kissed me and said she loves finishing first. When she went to the bathroom I checked my watch. 5,000 steps. Not bad. I wondered if it included the "workout".

*I am a third party watching myself. I am both standing at the end of my ex's bed and watching myself stand there. I list off every thing she did that hurt me. I ask her to tell me the truth about when her new relationship started. I cry. The onlooker watches her laying there with her eyes closed. Not looking peaceful, but disturbed*

I woke up to see Marie standing fully dressed, arms folded, calling my name. Her parents were visiting and she needed me to leave. I quickly got dressed and noticed the ends of my jeans were wet. It hadn't rained the night before. There was dark dirt or what appeared to be ash under my fingernails. I showed them to her, and looked towards her black duvet as the only possible source. She rolled her eyes and sternly told me to get out.

I approached her before leaving hoping for a kiss but she backed away. I didn't know what had changed. I got a cab to my house, while fighting the instinct to overthink about what had gone wrong. As a distraction, I checked my watch. A notification told me I had reached my daily target. 10,000 steps. But how? I swiped back to the previous day. 10,000 steps. What was this app counting?

I had a text from my housemate. "Hey man, can we have a chat when you get home?"

He told me someone had been in his room a few nights while he was out. It seemed to be ongoing for a while. At first he said it was small changes. A lamp not being where he remembered putting it, or some clothes on the floor that had been on the bed. Then he noticed dark fingerprints on the door handle, and there seemed to be drops of blood and some dog or cat's fur on the carpet.

I was shocked. I wasn't sure if it was real, or his mind playing tricks on him.

Then he asked "Man. Were you in my room those nights?"

My mind was racing as I went to bed that night. I'd never been in his room, why would he think it was me? But who else could it be? Why was Marie so cold towards me, and where did the extra steps come from.

*I'm standing in an area I recognise. There are rundown buildings, and I'm standing next to a trash can lit on fire. In the distance I see the figures of teenagers looking at me, their faces just shadows. I hear a dog whimpering. I see the missing dog poster on a pole. There's an added section saying 'Wanted' with my picture. There's blood on my hands. I hear my own voice repeating "I'm already dead...I'm already dead..."*

I woke up with a sore throat, my breaths shallow. I didn't have the energy to even get out of bed. I checked my watch. 14:44. A notification told me I had reached my target steps for the day. I had a text from my housemate to tell me he thinks I should move out as he doesn't feel comfortable living with me anymore. I'm at a loss as to what is going on and I don't know where to go.
