I have been a handyman for approximately the last three years. Sometimes the jobs can be awkward, stressful, or downright weird. This situation below is by far the most bizarre. 

I was contracted through Angis Services to assemble and install a ceiling fan/light in a customers home starting at 7:00am.  I contacted the customer the day before leaving a voice message with them regarding my contact information and preliminary questions on install location, ect. I did not hear back.

The following morning, I arrived at the customers home and while gathering my tools, was greeted by the customer. She was a 75 year old woman wearing a nightgown and a pair of raggedy old fuzz slippers. Her hair was long and stark white and her built was frail and brittle. She invited me into her Victorian style corner lot home that was built sometime in the 1800’s. The entry door led to a room with a king sized bed accompanied by 2 old Yorkshire poodles and a young girl watching a video on a laptop computer. The vacant half of the bed had a deep indentation that I can only assume was the semi-permanent position of the older woman that ushered me inside. There were zero lights on and a stale smell about. The young girl was shy and buried herself into the laptop screen when the older woman introduced me as the handyman sent to install the fan. 

The older woman continues through the bedroom situation and asks me to follow her to where the fan will be installed, which I oblige. I am led to a bedroom next door to the room in which her and this young woman were staying. The house is huge but dingy thoughout. Moving box were spread amongst the property and the only light present was that from the outside. I noticed a child size shopping cart in the hallway, filled with 4-5 of those plastic babydolls from the 1950’s, all unclothed. 

Upon entry to the installation bedroom, there was a bedframe unboxed and spread throughout the room. The older woman tells me how someone arrived at the home the previous day from WayFair to assemble the bed but left after only 10 minutes. The gentleman supposedly was going out to get a tool from his vehicle before deciding to completely abandon the job. I offered my condolences as she dropped the story by saying, “well, this isnt your problem”, which showed that she was reading my mind. 

I locate the boxed fan/light. Set my workstation up and continued to unbox and assemble the fan. 20 minutes pass and I am 75% complete with this assembly, all that is left to do is remove the previous light, attach the fan mounting bracket, wire everything, and facia the bracket and screw mounts. 

This is when the older woman arrives in the doorway of the bedroom that I am working in and says,

“Someone is breaking in here every night and carving up the floors with a knife.”

“Excuse me?”, was my response.

She continues, “There is a man breaking into our home every night, and he vandalized the house floors with a knife. My granddaughter and I sleep in shifts to keep an eye out for him. He sleeps in the bushes outside. I spent over $10,000 having all of the bushes removed so he has nowhere to hide. I have called the police and they have been out to investigate 21 times, they cant catch him though. I spent thousands of dollars on private security to stay the night, and every time they are here, he doesn’t break in.”

She walks away, but returns 3 minutes later to state, “last time he broke in, he carved “Im going to rape you” into my bedroom headboard. And you see, my grand daughter is blind and had a traumatic brain injury so she isnt much help. He rides a motorcycle around our house at all hours of the day, everyday, revving his engine as he circles.”

Granddaughter approaches the doorway, also wearing only a nightgown and grasp hold of the older woman’s arm. The woman instructs her granddaughter to go to the kitchen to heat up food, an instruction which the granddaughter follows. 

At this point, I am standing on a 10 foot ladder and have disassembled the ceiling light previously installed while observing that there is no junction box for the electrical connection to be coded for a safe install. I was not contracted to install an electrical box into her wood ceiling nor had the tools with me to accomplish the task if I wanted to. I can hear a microwave being used to heat what smells like Chinese food.  

Still standing in the doorway, the woman asks, “is that sanded down right there?” Pointing to a corner section of the ceiling. I looked to see a small area of the ceiling where the varnish was removed due to light sanding, so I replied, “yes, it looks like that area was sanded a bit”

She continues, “That was him too. He breaks in here at night and sands things down too. The steps were sanded down to wood and other areas of the house have sanding marks that he does in the middle of the night” 

The granddaughter reappears in the doorway and states, “I stepped in pee”. The older woman is startled and walks in the direction the young lady just walked from. 

From the rear of the house I hear the older woman express, “He’s here!”. 

The older woman instructs the young lady to find her shoes as they need to leave the house immediately. 

At this point, I have gathered my tools and belongings and were planning to exit the room and property. The woman stops once again in the doorway and states, “just so you know, he’s in here. He just peed on the kitchen floor.” 

To a swift response from me, “What?” She states, “we are leaving, do what you want.” 

I continue to gather my things, I enter the hallway and look towards the direction of the kitchen. I see nothing alarming and I hear zero noise. I walk towards the exit and both women are now laying in the bed watching a video on the laptop. I express to the older woman that I didn’t see or hear anything alarming and that my end of the work was completed and that she would need to make a work order request for an future handyman or electrical to install a junction box in her ceiling before the fan could be installed. She looks to the younger lady and states, “We scared him away”, to which I interrupted her by saying, “no ma’am, I don’t believe that you have anything to worry about. My work order request is complete, so I am just packing up and heading to my next job.” Neither woman state another word and I exit the house. The neighborhood was upscale and classy. People walked the sidewalks and the community seemed to be in very good standings, aside from this dilapidated property that I was servicing.  

I would love to hear anyones opinions or questions about just what in the hell was going on here.
