I went for a long 5 hour ride on my motor bike. I love my motor bike and this is a 5 hour ride. On this particular route, it is my favourite one because there are hardly any cars on the road. So it's just me and the motorbike. There's a few cafes on that trail and so I will stop off for a meal break. Then at the end of the ride, I will book myself into a hotel and go back home the same way. It's a relaxing time for me. 



I've done it so many times riding this trail with my motor bike. It's so calming and it gives me so much enjoyment. So when I was riding my motor bike this time round on the same trail, something felt off. As I started off the journey there was an uneasy feeling thst just rose up within me, and I wasn't enjoying it as much. Then I felt something round my waist. 



As I looked down at my waist, I saw two pale wrinkly arms on my waist. I didn't carry any passengers with me on this ride. Then I felt those arms let go and i something else on my waist, and it was now another new group of arms round my waist. These arms had cut marks on them and I could feel someone behind sitting on the back seat of the motor bike. 



I was terrified and I dared never to look behind me. I just kept on riding. When I got to the first Cafe, there was no one holding onto my waist anymore. I was grateful and I had a meal at the cafe, and then got back onto my motorbike. I carried on with my journey and something still didn't feel right. This journey which I had enjoyed many times before, was now giving me weird energy. It didn't feel right nor did it make me happy. 



Then another horrible feeling came over me and I was sure that I was still riding my motor bike. I was riding my motor bike but not holding the handles. Then I realised that it was now myself who was holding onto someones waist! 



It was someone else now who was riding my motor bike, how did we change positions? 



The person riding my motor bike smelled horrible. He had blood all over him and he was breathing heavily. Then finally when I reached the destination, it was only myself riding the motor bike.



Then as I planned to return home by using the same route. I felt it all again and I could feel someone sitting on the passenger seat, with their arms around my waist. I just had to concentrate on getting home and whatever was holding onto me, I was just hoping that it wasn't violent. 



When I observed the arms holding onto my waist, it was a rotten arm and I could see some bone. Then as I was riding my motorbike, I was suddenly the passenger holding onto some other thing riding my motorbike. 



I managed to get back home alive.
