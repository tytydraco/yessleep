If you asked me to tell you any of the bed time stories I was read when I was young, I doubt I’d be able to name a single one.

Why is that?

Well, if I’m being perfectly honest, at some point, they all just started to sound the same to me.

They all became about the monster preying on innocence.

The monster would emerge from its cave, prey on innocence, and then it would face the retribution of the others, something that almost always ended in its demise.

All stories, not just the ones I would read, pretty much follow this formula.

As you can guess, I am now writing this as an adult, but the events I am about to recount took place when I was at the tail end of childhood.

I had turned twelve not a month ago, July 1984, and here I found myself at my local public library.

No, I wasn’t looking for George Orwell’s “1984”.

It would’ve been quite the irony, wouldn’t it?

…

Sorry.

I know I’m rambling again.

My mind just…can’t dive right into this part.

I have to warm up like I’m about to run a marathon.

Just like marathon runners don’t want to pull a muscle, I don’t want to suddenly start crying.

I’m sure I have a few tears left in me, and I’d prefer to keep them in for something more important.

Anyhow…here I was. Twelve years old at the public library. The summer heat made the air as thick as a winter blanket, and I distinctly remember each one of my rolls of fat (I was quite chubby back then) excreting sweat like a shower head.

Strangely, I don’t remember why I was at the library in the first place.

Or even what book I was looking for.

Funny how the mind only remembers what it wants to remember, not what you want it to remember.

But I do remember the moment in question.

I was in whatever section I was, my flabby arm reaching behind a particular shelf that was above my head, and my fingers making contact with something I hadn’t expected.

Something hard and plastic.

I managed to grip it with my index and middle finger and pull it out.

Low and behold, I was holding a VHS tape.

A VHS tape with no discernible label.

I could have left it there, confused, and gone about my day, and my life, but for some reason, as if forces out of my control compelled me to, which is most likely the case, I looked around for a moment and slipped the damn thing in my pants.

Little did I know just how much I would pay for this later.

Like stealing the forbidden fruit to eat at a later time.

I went home and plopped that tape in the VCR I had in my closet, right under my cracked T.V.

I wondered just what the hell I was going to see, but nothing came up.

I waited.

And waited.

And waited some more.

I waited for about five minutes (a veritable eternity for my young self) before ejecting the tape.

I held it in my hands, and for the first time since I’d found it, I realized just how light it was. I hadn’t noticed before because I was too preoccupied with the thought that the librarian would catch me and call the police and I’d end up in jail and spend the rest of my life holding a bar of soap tightly for a reason I was still too young to understand.

I rattled the thing, and I thought I heard something.

I popped it open and found it.

A folded piece of paper.

The VHS itself was empty.

An innocuous folded-up piece of paper was all it held inside.

Again, I could have left it.

Again, I didn’t.

I unfolded it and discovered that it was a large map of my town.

Dark red blotches covered its surface, particularly where I was holding it.

But there was one thing that caught my eyes immediately, and that was a bright red circle encased within a larger circle on the map. It was located in a far corner of the forest.

The forest that my room overlooked.

I scanned the yellow and dirty map and found my street on it, and although my house wasn’t listed, I was able to find where it roughly was.

Using a scale guide on the map and a ruler, I was able to determine that the location marked by the large red circle was less than two miles away from me.

My parents were going to see some friends that day to celebrate their birthday.

I would be home alone until night.

I'm sure you've already guessed where this is going.

Again, I could have left it all end there.

But I didn’t.

And what I will tell from now will be what made me regret not taking all of the opportunities I had to leave this be.

I left near twilight with a plain orange backpack that was chalk full of water bottles and granola bars and wearing my hiking boots from my boy scout uniform; a shovel from my mother’s garden hung from it. My small right hand held my dad’s luminous handheld searchlight, while my left a simple toy compass.

I had calculated how many of my steps were in two miles, and so I walked.

I counted under my breath, each passing number lowering the sun further and further down the horizon.

It wasn’t long before I reached my number.

Nearly seven thousand steps at 20 degrees.

I found myself on top of a hill, and I knew that somehow, I had made it.

It was oh so empty, and by now, I had to use my powerful flashlight in order to see anything.

But there was nothing.

There was no typical X at the top, and I felt my spirit drop.

What had carried me through two miles of dense forest as a child in the dead of night left and the fear that had been held at bay hit me.

I was alone in the middle of nowhere.

I didn’t know what to do.

My mind blanked of higher thought and instead roiled and broiled with images of my parents coming home and finding me nowhere and police swarming the entire town, and no one finding me until years later because I had taken that accursed map with me..

I imagined myself being eaten by a bear or by a wolf or even a monster.

The darkness surrounded me, and even with the handheld searchlight, my fear did not dissipate.

I felt true loneliness at that moment.

I don’t remember starting to cry or anything.

I just remember sitting on the moss-covered stump of a tree – the only thing within that wretched clearing – and gazing up at the sky.

I unconsciously swung my legs as you do when you’re a child who's sitting down on a chair that doesn’t allow your feet to touch the ground, and everything as I knew ended when my boot collided with the side of that wretched stump.

It wasn’t a muffled and subdued sound.

It was a sharp and hollow sound.

Like hitting a metal pole.

Using my hand, I tore a bit of the moss that covered it, and found that I hadn’t actually been sitting on a tree stump of any kind, but rather a metallic cylinder of sorts.

I wiped all the moss on its top, and I found a handle.

This truly was my last chance to leave.

To just sit there and do nothing, but again, I didn’t.

I grabbed the handle and tugged.

There was no noise.

The top just opened like the lid of a can of beans, all on its own, letting out a hushed breath of air that the hill I stood on had been holding in for God knows how long.

The sun, meanwhile, had gasped it last breath before drowning under the far-off horizon long ago.

I shone my light down the deep shaft that had been revealed to me, and found that it was a tunnel with a ladder that led down to a darkness that was untouched by my powerful flashlight.

It really was too late.

Deeper and deeper I went, down to a darkness that only the sun could banish, but one that it could never reach.

My flashlight was all I had to navigate the strange place I found myself in

Now how can I describe my surroundings?

Christ….

Imagine the Jetsons.

You know, the old kid’s cartoon.

Now, imagine those Motorola ads by Charles Schriddes back in the 60’s about retro futurism.

Imagine these two styles combined, with a bit of Star Trek and Star Wars and…

And…

And I still don’t think you’d be able to visualize it.

It’s like trying to describe something Lovecraftian.

But it wasn't so much about the architecture as it was about the atmosphere.

You had to be there and smell it.

Only by using this neglected sense could you get the full picture that I am unable to put into mere words.

The long corridor I found myself in – one full of open doorways on either side – was a desolate place.

There was so much dust that it was almost like snow.

My flashlight was all I had.

Not really knowing what to do, I went into one of the rooms.

I felt like a trespasser, and this feeling multiplied tenfold when I stepped through the threshold of the room in question.

I’m not sure how to describe what I found there.

It appeared to be a living quarter of sorts, but something that was extremely inadequate for a human.

Dust covered everything like a thick blanket, and I looked around.

Nothing was broken or cracked like in a haunted house you’d see in a horror movie.

It wasn’t decrepit in the usual sense; just devoid, is the best way I can describe it.

The air felt heavy, each lungful feeling like I was swallowing the dust that surrounded me.

I thought I saw something dark and purple staining one of the things I assumed to be furniture.

I felt alone.

No one knew where I was.

I didn’t know where I was.

I just found myself in an alien place that I truly had no business being in.

I was about to walk out and leave when my hand brushed against something I surmised to be a table, and a blinding light flickered on above it.

I was so startled that I fell on the ground, and when I looked up, I saw something that I recognized immediately from having seen Star Wars.

It was…a hologram, but it was much more advanced than the one I’d seen in the movie.

It had colors and it was a neat rectangle and…it was a photograph.

Against my fear, I turned off my flashlight and focused all of my attention on this static image projecting itself onto air.

I saw it.

I saw who I assumed lived in the room I found myself in.

They were lanky and humanoid, and like us, but not like us.

They were more humanoid than the aliens I’d seen on Star Wars but not as humanoid as the ones I’d seen on Star Trek.

They were something the human imagination would consider either too little or too much.

It appeared to be a family photograph, as there were a few little ones and another one of its kind who didn’t appear to have a great amount of sexual dimorphism, like our men and women.

I don’t know how long I stared, letting the reality of my situation sink in.

I walked out in a daze, and I stared at every other door in that hallway.

In each and every one I forced myself to step into I found that piece of furniture, and in each and every one I was able to procure at least one holographic photograph. Family I assumed, and I stared at each for the longest of times.

I felt like I didn’t belong.

At the end of the corridor, I was able to see an elevator of sorts, and I stepped into it because of my emotional stupor, and I didn’t care when the door closed automatically – carrying me down and down and down further into the unknowable abyss I’d stepped into – right after I’d pressed the biggest button it had to offer.

The doors opened and I found myself in…the control room?

Or could it be considered the cockpit?

This part was far more damaged than the rooms I’d visited, and before me, illuminated by my flashlight, appeared to be a gigantic screen spanning the entire width of the room.

I approached it, but my way was blocked by a podium of sorts that stood in front of it.

On the podium, before me, were three manners of control. A single button with illegible writing under it, a D-pad – nearly identical to the one on my Nintendo Entertainment System, and what appeared to be a dial.

I twisted it left and right, but nothing happened.

I pushed the D-pad up and down and left and right but nothing happened.

Only the button was left.

I pressed it, and a wave of light washed over me like a tsunami.

The gigantic screen that stood before me burst to life, and my light-starved eyes were blinded like the senses of a bat that had wandered into a rock concert.

I fell back, but was able to recover quickly.

Standing back up, I stared at the screen before me which brimmed with light.

Small cracks jostled around its edges, but none obscured what it showed me.

On its left was…another screen?

Mind you that this was the eighties, and that computers weren’t capable of anything like this back then.

The internet hadn’t even been invented yet, so this completely blew my mind.

The screen within the screen was right next to a grid – each of its squares having strange writing under straight lines.

Each and every one of them was red.

I played around with the D-pad, and was able to see that it served the function of selecting one of the squares on the grid.

I selected, so to speak, the grid which had the same writing as the room with blood.

The large box next to the grid was still dark.

I touched the dial, and rotated it right.

Nothing happened.

I rotated it left, and the grid transmuted from an abysmal black to a blinding white, a new button emerging from the control console like the lock of a car door, and I saw the grid I had selected turn a ghastly yellow. The previously straight line now looked like one made by a seismograph that had recorded a terrible of earthquake.

In one strong motion, I rotated the dial all the way back, as far as it would go, and the image inside the square next to all the grids went a yellowish green with a line that only slightly trembled.

The screen was black once more, and I pressed the button that had emerged only moments before.

The darkness began to fade, and I found myself staring at the very same piece of furniture with the blood stain on it.

Now, though, it appeared fresh, for it shined from a light that wasn’t there when I was in the room.

The light flickered, and the image started to change.

The line of the square twitched and vibrated before it stabilized, and it was then that I realized what I was looking at.

It was a first-person perspective.

I was looking at this from their point of view.

I touched the dial and turned it, and the image scrubbed forward just like a VHS tape.

Now, they were all in the very cockpit where I stood, but in the recording, it appeared much less dirty.

They seemed to be…talking, I want to say, but I really can’t be sure, as I couldn’t understand a lick of it.

I pressed the small button again and the video paused.

I pressed it again and it resumed.

I paused the video.

Turning my attention to the D-pad controller once more, I selected another square, a random one.

A new black screen appeared, and I slowly twisted the dial back before hitting the button that played the video.

It was night time now.

I could see that the creature was outside, walking on crusty tarmac.

Its square on the grid was green, but the line it had twitched like the cord of a guitar being played.

I could hear what I thought to be labored breathing, before something that sounded like sniffing.

Now, I, or rather it, was looking at a dumpster.

Long alien fingers gripped its dirty lid and raised it.

As it rummaged around, letting out loud groans, I suddenly heard a shout of something that I understood.

“HEY!” a voice shouted, and the creature abruptly turned to face whomever had yelled.

The line twitched.

I saw someone whom I recognized.

Mr. Vern, a butcher in our town, was the one standing before me and it.

He appeared younger here, his grey hair shown to be a deep chestnut, and his face, in my memory a wrinkled T-shirt, appeared to have been ironed smooth by youth.

In his meaty hands he held a shotgun, and I could very well see the fear that the street light illuminated on his face.

The alien seemed to gaze at him, and I realized that it didn’t understand the danger it was in, for the line of its grid seemed too still, as though it had come across an old friend.

The hand that had been digging through garbage only moments before reached out, and a blinding flash followed by a deafening BANG ensued.

The square melted into a dark orange and the line twitched and hissed and moaned up and down.

The creature now lay on the ground, looking up at the night sky.

Stars, too many to count, looked down at it as thought with pity, and I saw it reach up at them.

There was a brief flash of light before the screen went black, and the square turned a deep red with a line as still as the surface of a frozen lake.

I started dumbfounded.

My hand, for whatever reason, all on its own without my input, selected yet another square, and I turned the dial back like I had done before.

I appeared to be in a basement.

The surroundings of the creature were dark, but I could make out vague shapes.

A door opened, letting forth a wave of light, and my view scuttered behind a dresser.

A young girl, holding a plate of food, stepped into the basement, and my view emerged from behind that dresser.

I saw the girl smile and hand it…me…a plate of food, which was eaten gracefully. The girl smiled and left, and darkness once again enveloped the room.

It all happened so quickly after that.

I had been staring in a state of utter transfixion when I heard loud noises that caught me off guard.

It sounded like a struggle, a man yelling and sharp sounds that sounded like repeated and endless slapping.

In an instant my view went out the door and found itself in a bright living room.

A large man stood over the girl, repeatedly hitting her with his fist. 

When he turned and saw me, he immediately stopped.

A shrill shriek came out, but not from him, but from the creature as it lunged and tore him apart.

My view now obscured by a few loose specs of blood, it turned to face the girl.

Stick-thin arms cradled her unmoving head. For a moment, I thought I saw my reflection in her eyes just before life completely seeped out of them.

I played another grid.

It was like turning back a clock.

A bear attack.

I played another grid.

It was like turning back a clock.

A smelly cage that even the most filth-hardened pigs wouldn’t want to live in.

Grid after grid I went.

Square after square became a dark crimson red.

I damn near collapsed, and I only had in me the strength for one last square, never mind all of the others remaining.

I picked the one I had first played, the one who’d bashed their head against furniture and bled purple blood.

I selected that square, and pressed play after turning the dial back to what appeared to be only a few minutes before everything went black.

The screen was a blinding white from the light above.

The line of the square jumped and twitched.

I could hear muffled voices in the background.

&#x200B;

*“Is it sedated?”*

&#x200B;

*“Of course. We’ve pumped it with enough anesthesia to knock out a horse.”*

&#x200B;

*“Then why are its…eyes still open?”*

&#x200B;

*“Differing physiology Mr. Ridley. Don’t let that bother you. We’ll just open him up and close*

*em back before you know it. I have the x-rays are right over here so I won’t be hitting anything vital.”*

&#x200B;

*“Good.”*

&#x200B;

I saw a man in a doctor’s garb with a face mask step into view, an electric saw in his hands.

As he presumably stuck it in, the line of the square exploded in an instant, like the spectrogram of a jet taking off.

The square slowly faded from a brilliant green to a sharp yellow and then to a soft orange.

The square went red.

Its line became still.

The screen became black.

I pressed the button that I first pressed.

The screen shut off and I now found myself in darkness.

The darkness they would have to bear for eternity.

Out of that wretched place I ran into the uncharacteristically cold night.

I ran and I ran.

I ran because I had bore witness to something no one was ever meant to.

I ran because all the countless squares I saw on that wretched grid, one for each room on that damned corridor, was red with a still line, and yet none of those rooms held any bodies.

I ran because it was night, and because I had to get home before my parents did.

I had to stop running and vomit because I had understood.

In real life, the monster never left it’s cave to prey on innocence

It was innocence that wandered into the cave of the monster.

We are the monster.

And by God or by a car I hope I’ll be dead before retribution finally comes.
