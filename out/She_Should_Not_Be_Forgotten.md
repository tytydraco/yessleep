So I’ve got a story.

  
An encounter, I guess. With a… fae? A demon? I don’t know.

  
It wants me to share her tale. And I will. I just need to get my thoughts in order.

So I recently decided to get fit, so I started walking in the woods near where I live. They’ve got the usual local legends - ghost stories, shadow things, and, of course, the big one: the “missing village.” Supposedly, sometime in the 13th century, an entire village vanished, and all that remains is a tree the colour of dried blood. It’s one of those tales that sounds dramatic enough to keep the tourists buying mugs and fridge magnets, but nobody local takes it seriously.

I always figured it was just plague, famine. - whatever was wiping out most of Europe back then. The land reclaimed it. End of story.

Still, it made the walks more interesting. Sometimes I’d find an old stone foundation or a sunken clearing that hinted at something once being there. I’d imagine how they lived. That’s all it ever was. Just fun.

Until last week.

I’d never walked the woods at night before. But after a few weeks of wandering the same routes, I wanted something different. I figured I’d go out late, get a few moody night shots of the “village,” see if the stories felt any creepier in the dark.

I made my way to one of the larger clearings, where us local's claimed was the centre of the village. I was lining up a photo when I heard something behind me.

I turned.

And in the middle of the clearing was the fucking tree.

The blood-red tree from the stories. Gnarled bark the colour of old rust, limbs twisted like bones, thick roots cracking through the frost. It hadn’t been there before. Not in daylight. Not in any of my photos. But there it was. And standing before it…

…was something else.

I don’t know how to describe it. It was tall. Wrong. Too many limbs, too smooth, too still. Its face was almost human, but it held the weight of centuries. I couldn’t move.

Then I heard it—or no, not “heard.” I just knew what it said.

“She should not be forgotten.”

I didn’t hear it with my ears. The words pressed behind my eyes like a migraine, and something shifted in my chest.



And then I wasn’t there anymore.

I mean that literally. I wasn’t in the clearing. It wasn’t night.

  
It was… daylight. The air was warm. The village was alive. I wasn't myself, I was something colder

And the story began.

  




 "As the noise from the village crept closer; voices raised, boots crunching through frost-hardened grass - the woman stood waiting. The villagers, men and women who had known her since childhood, were coming to take her.

The Watcher stayed hidden.

Nothing should have sensed their presence. Even the smallest insect veered away from the space they occupied. But the woman, her beauty untouched by the years, still knew. Somehow, she always did. She always had. She tilted her head slightly, speaking to the wind.

"Ahh, old friend. The end you warned me of is coming. I'm sorry I can't see your face one last time," she said aloud, calm.

  
Then, softer - almost to herself - “But that was part of the price.”

She had never been good at keeping her inner thoughts quiet. Not even now.

  
It remembered her entering the forest as a child - no fear of its kind. She sang sweet songs, played in the sun-dappled glades, picked flowers deeper in the forest than any other would dare go. It had approached her, as it had countless others, ready to feed. But she had offered a flower and a smile, without fear.



That summer was one of sweetness and life. She played beside it, unknowing. Still, it had a duty. The village suffered. But never her: the girl with no fear, only love. She had given it a flower, a smile, and never fear. That was enough to spare her... no, to love her.

  
Years passed. She grew older, but the sweetness never left her.

  
Then one night, she returned, her voice puzzled. "The village is afraid. Can you help?"

  
It tilted its head.

  
“What will you give?”

  
“Only myself,” she said. “My friendship. What else is there?”

  
“A gift worth more than gold or blood,” it replied. “While you live, I shall not touch them. But I must go. You won’t see me after this night.”

  
She cried. It remembered.

  
She asked if it would be lonely. It didn’t know how to answer.

  
“You’re my first friend,” it said.

  
“You’ll have more.”

“I won’t,” it replied. “That was part of my price. To be me.”

  
They spent one last evening together. It whispered secrets, gave warnings, and when she slept, it tucked her into moss and vanished.

  


She kept her word.

  


For decades, her friendship was a quiet light in the dark. It would have known if it wavered. Even once, and the pact would be broken - but her heart stayed pure, filled with love for even the impure. The village flourished. Fields bloomed after drought. Illness passed swiftly. They never thanked her. But she never asked.

  
It started slowly, at first. They stopped inviting her to weddings. The baker no longer waved. One by one, faces she had loved turned cold; not cruel, just distant. She once sang in the square, children dancing around her like she was a maypole.

  
Now the children hid when she passed, the villagers whispering, Crossing themselves. As if she was a bad omen. Still, even then, she never let them come to harm. And it used its strength to help.

  
Now the crowd came. She heard Elias shouting - she had set his broken leg as a child. Ana was likely holding a torch - Ana, whose baby she had once saved.

  
They called her unnatural. Said she had lived too long. That she cursed the land.

  
It wasn’t fear that brought them. It was hunger. The harvest had finally failed. The cows gave blood instead of milk. They needed someone to blame. They had waited months. And before - despite their cruelty and her loneliness - she had always helped. But now, she sat in the forest, and they believed she refused to help. Not knowing there was nothing she could do. Even with the secrets she knew, sometimes there was nothing to be done.

  
They whispered: She’s not like us anymore. She’s forgotten we exist. She’s not human.

  
Who else could it be but the Lady of the Woods?

  


She waited calmly as they reached the clearing’s edge. Their eyes slid away from hers.

The Watcher saw: not one heart burned with real hate or conviction.They all knew she was blameless. Still, they would do it.

They tied her hands with rough rope. She did not resist. No trial. No blessing. Just a tree, an old rope, and silence.

She stood beneath the branch, feet bare against the frozen soil.

She did not speak. Not to them. But just before the rope pulled taut, she closed her eyes.

  
I kept my word, she thought. Please… keep yours.

  


When her breath stopped, the air shifted.

The wind fell still. The frost deepened. Somewhere beyond the trees, even the owls went quiet.

And the Watcher felt something its kind was not made for: loss and sorrow.

  
  
It stepped into the world.

The Watcher’s form was wrong - too many limbs, too smooth, yet ever-shifting. Its face was almost human, if human faces bore the weight of centuries.

  
It did not roar.

It did not scream.

It simply moved.

  
Elias was the first - his throat opened before his scream could rise. Ana turned to run, but the trees had grown teeth.

One by one, the villagers were taken. And if its blows were less clean than usual, its prey allowed to linger - who could blame it? For before her, it had not known love. And they had taken that from it.

  
Their screams rose and fell like wind through bonewood.

  
By morning, the clearing was quiet.

  
The Watcher stood before the tree, head tilted. Her body still hung there, peaceful in death. It crouched slowly, reverently, and placed a long, jointless hand against the trunk.

  


“She called me friend,” it murmured, voice like cracking ice. “While you lived, I harmed none. They now pay the price.”

  
And then it was gone. The forest grew over the clearing in weeks. No paths remained. But sometimes, travellers speak of a tree older than all others - roots red as rust, branches that seem to whisper.

  
They never linger long."

  


When I came back to myself, I was lying just outside the clearing. My camera was gone. My watch was cracked. I’d lost hours. The red tree was gone again as if it had never been there.

But I still have the memory. Or the vision. Or whatever the hell it was. I can’t sleep without seeing her face. I feel like I knew her. Like I personally failed her. It was jumbled; some of it was hers, some of it was its. Maybe it can’t speak, not really. Or maybe it can’t bear the weight of remembering alone.

So this is me keeping my part of the deal.

Please remember her.
