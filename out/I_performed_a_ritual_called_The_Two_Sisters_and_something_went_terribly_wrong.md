My home office is blooming with… something dark. As I wait for dawn, I thought I’d write this experience down. I can’t (and wouldn't dare to) sleep, and I really need a distraction right now. I can hear things scratching in the room, voices as well, low and whispered. That wasn’t the plan, but I’ll heed the instructions and wait for dawn. So -- here goes, from the top.

Josie, my wife, decided that we need to separate. This came as no surprise, but it hurt as much either way. If you’d ask why, I’d counter with how much time you’ve got. Our estrangement has been a long and cold process, with fault residing on both parties. We’d been together for twelve years, married for eight, living together for seven. And yes, this does mean we were married for a year before we lived together - at the time our love was stronger than our wallets were fat. Technically we did live together at the time, though, only it was alongside my parents, at their house, in their basement - not exactly *living* together as much as sharing an awkard space where my parents might walk in any second. Although she broke the news of the separation *solo*, the pragmatics we’ve dealt with as a couple; I’ll move out, she’ll stay at the apartment. 

We’re not actively hostile towards each other, so there’s been no real need to hurry. It took me about a month to find a place - with her help - but I still have a few weeks until I can move in. It has been… bittersweet. Working together to find a new apartment, sorting through our belongings - we’ve really worked *together* for the first time in a long time, and that has felt… nice. The apartment has felt warm again, the way it used to years ago, when our relationship was more passionate than bureaucratic. Anyway, I’ve been slowly packing up my stuff so there would be a bit less stress on moving day (who am I kidding, it’s still gonna suck more than anything), and as I was picking out my books (few and far between) between her books (plentiful and varied) on our large, shared Billy-shelf, I came across one I hadn’t seen in a long time.

The book in question was my grandmother’s old grimoire. She died when I was eleven or twelve, so I never got to know her well. I snagged the book for myself as I was helping my parents sort through her stuff after her death. She owned hundreds of books, and I don’t think my parents gave more than a vacant nod when I asked them if I could have it - if they had, I doubt they’d have let their christian son own a bona fide witches grimoire. 

I’d only ever flipped through it once or twice, mostly letting it decorate any bookshelf I’d had during my life. It was in my room as a kid, standing between Percy Jackon novels on a small, never dusted, one foot long shelf above my bed. Later, it took center stage on my first *actual* bookshelf that I bought for my first apartment. It was optimistic of me to give such square footage for a bookshelf; it never got to hold more than thirty books at best, mostly becoming an open liquor cabinet (liquor shelf?). And finally, it had decorated me and Josie’s bookshelf - this one actually quite full - for years. Now it was time to find a new shelf for it to stand on once again.

I sat down with the book, determined to finally give it the attention it had been deprived of all these years. I felt rude towards my grandma for just lugging it around all my life, never reading it, but then I thought about what my parents would’ve done to the book if I hadn’t rescued it. At best they would’ve donated it somewhere, at worst burned it and scattered the ashes in some seedy alleyway where God’s eyes never landed.

So now, my fellow NoSleepers, we’ve come to the bit that might actually interest someone other than my therapist. The grimoire held within its pages a slew of instructions: recipes for herby concoctions to cure sleeplessness, the right way to prepare certain ingredients (mushrooms, plants, bones, and other miscellaneous things one might find on the floor of a forest), how to read rocks to see the future, and finally a bunch of rituals for luck, prosperity, and other vaguely ‘good’ things. Within these rituals there was one that caught my eye: The Two Sisters.

The section about The Two Sisters ritual has multiple pages of prologue, which I’ll try to condense down to its main points below.

Basically, throughout my grandma’s lineage, The Two Sisters have been summoned to help resolve conflict within two members of the family. In essence, when you’re in bad relations (not talking to each other, separated and what have you) they’d communicate to the other person what your true feelings are. The book describes this as ‘*the summoning of true love, delivered upon the loved ones heart and soul in language understood within*.’ The ritual was born of necessity, and it is to be used only as such. The sisters themselves are young and wear pale blue clothing. One of them is called Voice, the other Face. Voice apparently has no face but can speak, and Face - you guessed it - has no voice, instead boasting a long and distorted grimace for a face. If the ritual is performed accordingly and to completion, the sisters will convey the ritual maker's feelings to the subject, and hopefully the two can then resolve their issues.

After the prologue, there are warnings. 

*‘Do not perform upon non-family members.’*

*‘Do not perform with impure thoughts.’*

*‘Do not attempt to invoke either Sister by their lonesome.’*

Following this, there are the step-by-step instructions for the ritual. It’s quite detailed, so bear with me.

**The Two Sisters**

Find yourself in a room after dusk, the doors closed, the windows shut, and the curtains drawn. Following you, no one else may enter the room until you have left.

Light two candles in front of you, two feet from each other, one on your left and one on your right. **You are the third flame, completing the ▽.**

Between the candles, place a bowl filled halfway with water. The bowl should be large enough to show the reflection of your face.

After the room is ready, sit with your legs crossed two feet away from the bowl in front of you. **You are the third flame, completing the ▽.**

Rest your hands on your knees, the fingers facing upwards, and close your eyes.

**You are the third flame, completing the ▽.**

Keep your eyes shut until the flames of the candles burn your hands. Do not open your eyes until the flame touches you; not for movement, sound, warmth or cold. Whatever may speak to you or touch you, you must ignore until the next phase.

Once the flames burn your hands, open your eyes and stare directly into the water.

If either candle is unlit or has moved from their place, **end the ritual.**

If the water bowl has been toppled over, spilled, or moved, **end the ritual.**

If you can no longer discern the walls of the room, **end the ritual.**

Upon continuing, stare into the bowl of water in front of you. The candles should give enough light for the water to produce reflections.

**You are the third flame, completing the ▽**

**△ ǝɥʇ ƃuᴉʇǝldɯoɔ 'ǝɯɐlɟ pɹᴉɥʇ ǝɥʇ ǝɹɐ no⅄**

The Two Sisters shall approach you through the water’s reflection. Once you see them, do not avert your gaze. In the reflection, you will seem them float above.

**as Above △, so Below ▽** 

**▽ ʍolǝq os '△ ǝʌoq∀ sɐ**

Only look at and talk to the sisters through the reflections in the water.

Tell Face who you want to speak to and why.

Tell Voice what you want to say in your heart. Think of the loved one in your most pure desire.

Once you have spoken to both sisters, blow out the candles and allow them to leave the room first.

After a short while, exit the room with the water bowl, and empty the bowl onto the earth. Do not re-enter the room until dawn.

The Two Sisters will visit your loved one the following night, and the rest is up to you.

**If you need to stop the ritual at any point, walk out of the room and wait until dawn to re-enter.**

**Do not stay with the Two Sisters for longer than the candles burn.**

So -- that’s the ritual. I’m not going to bore you with any major postulations. I was raised a christian, but as an adult, I’ve been what I’d call so-and-so, basically *I dunno* \- but I *do* have an upbringing induced allergy/fascination to all things spooky. I put the book in a cardboard box with all seven other books I seemed to own (I should read mode), but I couldn’t stop thinking about it. 

This brings us to tonight. Josie was going out with her friends, and said that she’ll be staying the night with one of them, as they’ll be going to brunch together the next morning. Although we’re mostly fine with living together even as we’re separated, she still takes any chance she can to not share a bed with me. Can’t blame her for that. I was slightly let down that she wouldn’t be around, since I didn’t have any plans of my own. I know it sounds sad, but I’d rather be with my estranged wife than be alone right now. I texted a couple of friends to see if they’d be up for something. No luck. Feeling defeated, I remembered the grimoire - *maybe I could arrange a hangout with the two sisters instead*, I thought.

Now, I know, you might think that I’m a huge idiot for doing this - and as I’m writing this, waiting for dawn, I’d agree with you. Eight hours ago, though, I thought myself an opportunist. Much like what writing is doing for me right now, the ritual was meant to just give me *something* to do - something that garners all focus and lets my mind escape this greige reality for a moment or two. So call me an idiot, if you will, but remember that I was a *sad* idiot.

I picked up the book and started gathering supplies. First, I went to the kitchen and grabbed myself a large metal mixing bowl. The bowl had no attributes of ambiance - unlike a nice wooden salad bowl might’ve had - but it at least could fit my face in it, which I cleverly tested by holding the bowl up to my face. “That’ll do,” I said, my voice echoing uncomfortably loud in the steel half-globe.

Next, I rummaged through drawers and cabinets until I found two long, white candles, which seemed the most fitting for the occasion. More fitting than wood and vanilla scented, girthy ones that burned for approximately 70 hours, anyway. Josie had gotten us some golden candle holders that we kept on our coffee table (but never actually burned any candles in, hence my difficulty in finding the candles), which worked perfectly, so I grabbed two out of the set of three along with a box of matches.

Deciding on the room was easy. Our apartment isn’t huge, and the only rooms with doors are our shower/bathroom, the bedroom, and a small room we use as a home office. I wasn’t gonna sit on the toilet, obviously, and our king-sized bed took up most of the space in the bedroom. That left me with the office, which I cleared out a bit, making enough room to sit and place the required objects on the floor. I closed the blinds from the single window and unplugged the power strip, so no chargers or laptops would have their LED lights blaring. I brought in the supplies and laid out the candles as well as the bowl, testing out the sitting arrangement as I did so. 

After a few deep breaths, I went through the instructions once more, checking off items and requisites:

* Dark room after dusk ✔
* Two candles two feet apart from each other ✔
* Big bowl filled halfway with water between the candles ✔
* Space to sit comfortably without bumping my knees or elbows on random clutter ✔
* No disturbances as estranged wife is having fun with her friends while I’m left alone to wallow in sadness and try weird old rituals ✔

I was ready.

Starting off, I squeezed myself into some comfy clothes and turned my phone off and left it outside the room. I checked that everything was ready, even peered out our kitchen window a bit  just to check if, for whatever reason, night had betrayed me and the morning had come soon. With the dark room brooding, the apartment still and silent, I have to admit - I got a bit spooked. But after going through all this effort, it’d be a shame *not* to do this. So, in I went into our drab and dark home office turned ritual sanctum. I lit the two candles, closed the door and took my assigned seat.

Sitting cross-legged wasn’t in my repertoire, as my legs quickly started to fall asleep, or some weird muscle I'd not erealized even existed intil that very moment would start twitching. I’d never been much for yoga, or any type of exercise for that matter. After a while, though, I got into a semi-comfortable spot and decided to begin. I rested my hands on my knees, the fingers pointing up at God, and closed my eyes.

For the first five minutes, absolutely nothing happened. Complete silence enveloped me, and it was sort of calming to just sit and meditate. *This isn’t so bad,* I thought. *Maybe after this I can have a nice cup of chamomile tea and call it a night. Did we still have that tea? I forgot to check. I hope so. If not, I’ll find some other non-caffeinated tea to drink --*

I heard a slight *woosh* as the candle flames moved. I thought a draft had gotten in, or maybe it was the ventilation, or maybe I just breathed too hard. Then it came again. This time I *felt* it on my skin, like someone had dragged an ice cold towel across my arm. My bones tried to jump through my skin, making me almost fall over on my back. I reminded myself of the instructions and decided to hold my eyes shut as I took a few deep breaths to calm myself down. This proved difficult, since I had an almost irresistible urge to check what (if anything) had touched me. Have you ever walked down the street and closed your eyes momentarily, just to see what it was like to be blind? How each step would bring further discomfort and an aching need to *justquicklycheck* what was in front of you? Well, that’s how I felt, except I wasn’t walking, and there should be nothing else in the room.

Then I heard a voice. A tiny, tiny whisper that came from behind me in the southwest corner of the room. It sounded far away, like the room was much bigger than it should be. I’m pretty sure I even heard it echo. I couldn’t discern what the voice was saying. After a minute or two it stopped, and the room felt like it returned to its original dimensions, the walls silently cascading back to their original positions.

Time and space had become more and more difficult to discern. After a while - could’ve been anything between thirty seconds and ten minutes - I felt a warmth before me, like someone had brought an oven into the room and turned it up to 200°C (that’s 392 Fahrenheit for you yanks). Then, just like that, the warmth was gone, the room becoming cold as death in an instant. A shiver shot through me. Almost immediately after this, both of my hands *burned*, like someone had dropped hot oil in the middle of my palms. The pain was so intense the reaction made me open my eyes. 

Throughout the ritual, my head was facing forward, so as you can imagine, when I opened my eyes, I looked straight at the door - though the instructions said to look at the bowl of water. I realized this, panicked, and shifted my gaze immediately to the water. I guess it was too late, because as I did this, I saw the candles go out in unison. The room became pitch-black, and from above my head I heard a loud scream.

I jumped up, almost falling over myself as my legs were numb from sitting, and lunged at the door. The screaming continued, not in any way changing pitch or slowing down or lowering volume.

As I stumbled towards the door, I heard crashing, thumping and scratching behind me, like something was lurching forward through the wall itself. I opened the door, jumped out of the room and closed it behind me. The second I closed the door, the screaming stopped, and the thing that lurched no longer made a sound, like it had decided to not follow me past this point. 

I sat on the floor and stared back at the door, trying to gather my thoughts, which mostly consisted of variations of *What the FUCK?.* My pondering was brought to its demise as I started to hear scratching coming from inside the room. I started to crawl away from the room while still keeping my eye on it.

Then the voice I’d heard earlier started to whisper in the room. Its pitch went up and down like a wave, some syllables deep growls, some consonants like pinpricks. The voice moved as well, left and right, forward and back, *above and below.*

Soon after I heard stomps that sounded like someone was walking around the room.

The deathly darkness was interrupted as a small light flickered to life and glowed under the door.

I got back to the instructions and re-read them. Two things were obvious: **a)** I’d fucked up by looking up instead of at the water, and **b)** I should NOT open that door until dawn. I made my way to the kitchen and opted for coffee instead of the chamomile I’d been meditating on.

That brings us to now. I’m sitting in the living room writing this on my laptop, giving quick glances to the room. I can’t let it out of my sight, as I’m afraid it will open itself for some reason, even though the instructions did not warn of any such occurrence. The scratching and stomping and voices are still all there, moving and twisting behind the door. I checked the exact time for when the sun comes up, and right now it’s still 3 hours and 37 minutes until dawn. That’s three and a half hours of me sitting here babysitting this spooky fucking room. I’m running out of things to write, so I’ll try to watch something on TV to try and get any sort of mind numbing buzz to distract me from the room.

I think I just heard a knock on the door.
