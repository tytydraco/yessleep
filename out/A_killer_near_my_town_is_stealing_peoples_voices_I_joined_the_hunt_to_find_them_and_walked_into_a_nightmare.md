The thing was back and it was time for another hunt. I didn’t know if we would find what we were looking for, but we had to try, we had to do something, because it was killing us. One by one, life by life, it was bleeding us and soon no one would be left to stop it.

I lived in a small rural town of little significance. As for where it was, I won’t disclose that here. Suffice to say you may have passed it by, but I doubt you have ever been there. That is for the best since it means you are safe. Safely away from the danger that still torments the region. The danger that is tied to the town, from some unknown chapter of the past.

It had been there before, eight years ago. It came to our little town in the past and bled us. No one knew what it really was, no one knew exactly how long it has preyed upon our town. Stories insist it was here before even that, but few still alive can say for sure.

I suppose the entire history no longer mattered, what mattered was the danger its existence posed to us and what we could do to finally stop it.

Last time it killed twenty-one people. A militia lead by the sheriff was formed to try and fight back, but at the time I had to stay behind. I was only twelve and I remember my dad and my older brother leaving to try to hunt down and stop this thing that was hunting us.

They never came back and my family, like many others had to endure and survive the loss in silence. The thing, whatever it was, was never stopped. Supposedly it was hurt, and it left. It left us alone for over eight years, until just recently, when it had come back.

An assembly had been called after the first deaths occurred and those who knew about the last incident had been quick to act. Volunteers had been called to organize a hunt based on the limited knowledge we had about the being that stalked us.

I was too young back when it showed up last, when it slaughtered my family members. This time though, I could help, this time I could fight.

It was the night of the hunt. I left to join the others just after 8pm. It was still light outside, but not for much longer. I walked down the street feeling weighed down by the equipment I was carrying.

I came around a corner and saw Jenny and Kyle’s house. I slowed my pace as I walked and winced at the sounds coming from inside. I had grown up with them and like many of the other kids my age we were very close, the tight knit relationship in a small town with shared grief made me feel their pain as keenly as if it were my own, in many ways it was.

Their father had been killed just two nights ago, their mother’s sobbing could be heard inside. We all knew what had killed him, we all knew that the thing had returned. Eight people already dead and the number was rising. It reminded me of my own father and brother all those years ago, when we thought we had gotten rid of it.

My heart went out to the whole family, that night I prayed there would be some measure of justice served. Most of the people would stay indoors, unwilling to enter the dark woods that all accounts claimed the thing resided in. I did not blame them; it was the smart thing to do. Yet I did wish our group was larger.

I swallowed back the nerves and pressed on. We had to hope and trust that our sheriff, the one who survived, would be able to track this thing down and destroy it once and for all.

I kept walking toward the meeting place at the outpost on the border of the forest. That was where I was supposed to meet the others that would participate in the hunt.

I heard a voice call out to me and I spun around and leveled my shotgun at the sound. A reflex, since you could never be too careful, even if it sounded like a friend calling out to you.

I saw it was Jenny. She had an ill-fitting jacket and hood on and was carrying a large hunting rifle. When I saw her, I lowered my own weapon and she whispered to me,

“Sorry to startle you, I have not been in a good headspace since the other day, I can't believe this is all real. Anyway, Kyle is already there. I was just trying to help my mom, before I left. She is not taking any of this well, but I told her that Kyle and I have to do this.”

“It’s okay.” I responded, showing her a glimmer of a smile as I whispered back.

“Are you sure you are up for this?”

She paused and looked around and then toward the forest in the distance.

“Yes, that thing cannot keep taking people, who knows who will be next!” Her voice started to rise, and I had to keep myself from too harshly hissing at her,

“Ssssshhhhhh”

She nodded her head, and I felt bad, but we had to be careful, right now especially. We walked together in silence. In a different time, we might have had a lot to talk about but not that night, not so close to dark.

At the outpost we were greeted by five others. Each wore a similar jacket and brightly colored rings on the sleeve to indicate that we were in the hunter cadre. We all had various firearms and Clyde, who I recognized despite his mask, due to his large frame, even had a hunting crossbow.

We whispered greetings to each other. We had all volunteered for this hunt. Each of us had lost somebody. The town's population was dwindling again, and we knew we had to do something before it was too late. We could not allow this thing to keep slaughtering us.

The sheriff was there, preparing the equipment. He was tall and imposing in a heavy greatcoat and strapped down with a small arsenal of weapons. Not only was Steve the towns sheriff, but he had led the previous hunt into the woods. His face bore a ragged scar across the right eye and down the cheek. That mark still looked bad years after the thing we were hunting had apparently given it too him in exchange for a wounding of its own.

He had claimed that whatever it was, if it could be hurt, then it could be killed. Despite his professed fear of going back in there, he had promised if the thing returned, he would lead the next hunt and the next, until it could be stopped. True to his word, he was determined to lead our group this time.

He looked us all over and nodded his head, then handed out a small, folded note to each of us.

We all read the instructions on the note and were given five minutes to commit every step to memory. I examined the paper and read the rules of the hunt once more, though I could recite them from memory by then.

“Rule 1. Stay together, it will try and isolate us. It preys upon stragglers, keep a tight formation.

Rule 2. Do not panic, it uses fear as a weapon against us. We can hurt it, we have before. It knows this, but it is clever and will try to use our fears against us, do not let it.

Rule 3. We are hunting just after nightfall. It only shows itself at night, we could never find it in the day. But early on at night it seems to be weaker, more sluggish. Whether it is dead or not, we are returning before 2am. In the dead of night, it seems to move faster, and it will likely overwhelm the group.

Rule 4. Always keep a light on you, a strong flashlight, a headlamp, hell a torch if that's what you want to bring. Hunting in the dark this might seem obvious, but do not let the moonlight or your eyes adjusting, trick you into thinking you can rely on night vision out here. The thing is hard to see even when exposed to light, you will never see it before it's too late if you try to eyeball it.

Rule 5. The absolute, critical and most important rule of all. Keep your mouth shut! No speaking at all. You will compromise the entire group if you do. Not even whispering, unless it absolutely can’t be helped when we are out there. Use the hand signals, use your lights and paper and pen if you really can't use the sign language. If you hear a voice, stay on guard and move with extreme caution, it might not be who or what you think it is.”

I put the paper back in my pocket and Steve looked at the group, nodded and waved us on. We formed into a line just as we had practiced before. Without a word spoken we walked into the shadowed forest, just as the last faint light of the sun crept behind the horizon.

We marched on in silence, only the soft patter of our careful tread and the occasional snapping of twigs or clatter of small rocks being disturbed heralded our movement.

I nervously regarded my comrades as we walked on in an orderly line. There were seven of us in total. Myself, Jenny and Kyle. Clyde, Steve, Cody and Terry. I did not know all of their stories, but I knew what we were here to do.

I kept repeating the instructions in my head, like a mantra to cling onto as the shadows closed in. We were out there with a predator that would likely be hunting us, just as we were hunting it. Failure was not an option.

We marched for around forty minutes. No signs of anything out there but us. Honestly, I was not sure what we were searching for, Steve never mentioned if it had a lair or something we could track it by. The bright lights all around us from the varied flashlights, lamps and other devices made me feel slightly better, though it limited what we could see in the distance.

I considered that we might not be looking for something, so much as listening for something, based on how Steve’s ears perked to every sound of the forest.

Suddenly we stopped as Steve held out a hand. He gestured for us to look down and to the right of our path. He motioned for Clyde and Terry to stay where they were and cover our backs while the rest of us knelt down beside him to see what he had found.

He had somehow spotted a strange looking piece of flesh, it almost looked membranous, like the wings of a bat. The pieces seemed to be all around a small trail of liquid which we soon saw with the light of our lamps was a dark reddish-brown color.

We took a few steps further into the brush and found an arm sticking out. We all looked nervously at each other and Steve grabbed the arm and pulled it free of the vegetation.

The sight was horrifying. The body was what was left of Miss Timmons, a teacher at the local elementary school. Jenny looked away and everyone tried to muffle gasps and outbursts of emotion. Steve looked back and glared at us as if he expected someone to cry out in alarm, but his withering stare kept all of us quiet.

He stood back up and waved over to Clyde and Terry to rejoin us then continued to lead the way out of the brush, leaving behind the mauled body of Miss Timmons. I resolved to tell her husband we found her and try to give her a proper burial, if we made it out of there ourselves.

I looked at the dim glow of my watch as we silently marched, it was almost 10pm. It felt like the night was pressing in around us and I shivered at the cold and the knowledge that our time was running out.

There was a loud howl of a wolf and it nearly startled us into motion as it broke the silence of the forest. Steve held out his hand and shook his head and we all calmed down and marched on.

After a short while, Clyde held up a hand and made what I think was a gesture indicating he had to take a bathroom break. Steve glowered at him but nodded and instructed Cody to go with him.

We sat in the small clearing and watched and listened for anything that might be out there while Clyde found a suitable spot. By the sound of splashing liquid on a tree, he was not too far away. He turned and started walking back.

As he was walking, he slipped and caught himself, but dropped his crossbow. The weapon made a loud banging sound as it rebounded off a nearby rock. We all turned to him and glared, while all our lights were trained on him and around the woods behind him.

He froze for a moment, then looked at us, shrugged apologetically and bent down to pick up the fallen weapon. As he bent down this time there was a snapping sound, like the air was being agitated by a cracking whip. Clyde tripped again and this time fell flat on his back. As he fell, we heard him cry out and try and stifle his surprise, but we distinctly heard him right as he fell.

“Shit.....oh no wait....” He turned bright red and stopped talking as he sat hunched over. We waited for a moment, like the sky was going to fall and the tension was palpable. When nothing happened, we looked to Steve whose face was a stone mask. He showed no expression but just shook his head and put his finger to his lips.

We waited for at least five minutes, teeth clenched, weapons aimed in all directions around us as if the forest would come alive and descend upon us any moment. I swear I heard an almost imperceptible rumble in the distance, back in the direction we had come from.

Kyle held up a hand and pulled out a notepad and started writing. Steve continued to look at us impassively.

Kyle showed us all the note,

“It is getting late. We need to find that thing and stop it!”

A few others nodded their heads, but Jenny and I looked at each other and were not so anxious to continue. We did not know what would happen, but if it was there, it had heard us now.

Steve pulled out his pistol and aimed it at us and then back the way we were walking. He was not leaving anything to chance. We started walking on and were struggling to regain our path back the way we had come. Our tracks had vanished somehow and when we tried to retrace them, we found that we might be lost.

Steve was still quiet, but he started to get a manic look in his eyes, like he was about to go into a rage, but did not want to acknowledge his anger to us.

We started moving faster. A slow panic began to take root, and I had to force myself to breath steadily and not break into a run. It felt like something really bad was about to happen.

As we moved along, a thundering blast of wind rushed through the trees and nearly knocked us off our feet. I reached out to grab Jenny and keep her from falling and I heard flashlights and lamps clatter to the ground. Steve started looking around frantically and suddenly I heard Clyde again,

“Shit, shit.....” I couldn't believe he was talking again after the last time and I looked at him along with the others as he stood there, holding onto a tree and his light. He had not been hit hard enough by the force of the strange gust to knock him or anything he was holding down. I was confused, why had he been exclaiming?

As the rest of us stared in anger and accusation, Clyde held up his hands and shook his head, like he was denying he had just spoken again.

That was the first time it struck.

Before we could register something else was wrong, we heard another rush of air and then a scream from somewhere else.

“What the.....Help! Oh God help! Shoot it!”

We all turned around to see the source of the sound. Turning away from Clyde and back to the front of the line.

Cody was gone. Steve’s eyes grew wide and he held up a hand and moved it around in a circle, indicating we should form up.

Terror gripped me, but I managed to take up position between Jenny and Terry. We aimed our guns and lights into the deep shadows of the trees beyond and collectively held our breath.

For a minute everything was silent, no one moved an inch. I felt like I was holding onto the same breath I had taken before it all happened. Then we heard it,

“Help! Please! My leg, my leg is broken. It is out here, help me before it comes back!”

Kyle and Terry started to move but Steve grabbed their shoulders and stared them down. He shook his head slowly and pointed out in the direction Cody’s voice was coming from and made a cutting gesture across his neck. We all understood the morbid signal. Cody was dead.

Steve pulled out a small cassette player and looked over to a clearing where Cody's flashlight had fallen. He stared intently in that direction and though it was hard to make out I swear I saw something agitating the brush near the fallen light.

Steve signaled for us to take aim. He pressed the button and threw the small cassette player into the clearing, and we heard the recorded voice of Steve shouting.

“Where are you! Come on out, we are here to help!”

There was a rustling and motion in the trees. As if something huge was moving toward us at immense speed. It broke out of the brush like a lightning bolt and landed in the faint light of the fallen flashlight, flattening the recorder in the process.

For a moment I was paralyzed. Even the fleeting glimpse of its giant body was too terrible to describe. Just shifting undulating flesh, warping and refracting the light and darkness.

I was knocked back to my senses when I heard a clap, followed by the thunder of Steve's gun going off. The shot was the signal for the rest of us, and we broke out of the terrified daze and began firing into the area wildly.

The amorphous mass of moving flesh and shadow shrieked and surged into the darkness of the tree line again and Steve followed behind, trying to bring the thing back into the light of his own flashlight. He swung his arm ordering us to follow, I started to move but Terry froze. I saw him pointing his light into the distance.

We saw an odd shifting and bending of the lights that were shining on the brush and then we heard Cody speak again,

“Heads up!”

Suddenly Terry was thrown off his feet by a fast-moving object striking him in the chest.

Kyle and I helped him up as fast as we could but when we looked down near where he had fallen, we had to suppress screams of our own.

It was Cody’s severed head!

We tried to suppress the horror and the grizzly sight before us, and we helped Terry to his feet. When he was standing on his own, he did not move, he just stood there, mouth agape. He was in some sort of shock or panic induced paralysis.

Steve was desperately trying to get us to stay together but also follow him in pursuit of the monster. His face was turning red with his inability to bellow the command to charge ahead. He furiously waved us on and once he noticed a few of us following, he surged ahead, to find and kill the thing while he had a chance.

Kyle looked at us, then at Steve and charged ahead to follow him. Clyde followed the other men, and I looked at Jenny and Terry. I snapped my fingers and mouthed the words,

“We need to stay together. Come on.” Terry was not looking at me and I tried to get his attention without speaking. Jenny took a step forward and reluctantly followed her brother, regarding me with a desperate and pained expression.

I did not want to be left by the group, but I also did not want to leave Terry behind. I shook his shoulders and then he started crying, first softly and then a full sob. I hated myself for what I had to do then. I slapped him in the face and tried to pull him along, but he broke free and just bent down and held onto Cody’s head. He looked at me as I tried to back away from him slowly.

The last thing I heard from Terry were a few mumbled words,

“This was a mistake, we are all going to die out here. I’m sorry Cody.”

Then he was gone. The thing moved so fast I couldn't draw a bead on it to try and shoot. I could not stop it from taking him. Cody was gone and so was the creature. Worse still I was alone now, I had to find the others before it found me.

I slowly and quietly moved back the way I thought I had seen everyone else run. My heart was hammering, and my palms were sweaty. I gripped the shotgun with terrified energy, hoping the weapon would give me a small feeling of safety.

I began to hear things as I moved. I thought I heard someone calling out again. My blood froze when I realized it sounded like Cody. His voice cried out, he was begging for help. I knew it was not him, but it sounded exactly like him. The nightmarish plea was cut short by another shot ringing out in the forest.

My ears perked up and I hoped I knew the direction the others were in now. I started to move faster, trying to catch up with the rest of the group, or at least whoever was still alive.

I heard two more shots fired and I broke into a sprint, the swaying light from the flashlight making it hard to see far enough ahead to stay on what I hoped was the path.

Intermittent gunfire continued and I was able to follow it to a clearing where I saw a figure hunched over near a tree. I cautiously approached and saw it was Clyde. I figured he must have gotten separated from the group. Fear still gripped me as I approached, and I began to doubt my senses. He stood up and I heard him whisper something,

“Hhhhelppp, I’m hurt, bleeding I need help, please....” I stared at him for a moment and was about to get our first aid kit and help. Then I noticed an odd detail when I shinned the light on him. It looked like Clyde, but the arm band he had was the wrong color. His voice too, sounded weirdly guttural. I paused and I swear I saw a small shift in his eyes, they momentarily lost color. A flash of dull white, before returning to the normal shade of green.

Then I saw that Clyde had a riffle beside him resting against the tree. I knew he had brought a crossbow. I had seen enough, I carefully raised the shotgun and tried to conceal the mounting tension of my next action.

Clyde or rather what was taking on his appearance, blinked rapidly until suddenly his eyes blinked horizontally and he began to emanate a disturbing hissing sound.

That was more than I needed. I fired the shotgun, and the pellets struck the flashing image of the thing as it lunged at me. The creature wailed in pain and the monstrous form missed me by a hair as I fell back and rolled away.

It crashed into the brush and ran, leaving a trail of hideous smelling ichor behind. I tried to catch my breath and stood back up. I saw the blood or fluid that it contained had a disturbing translucent quality that seemed to absorb and redirect light. I wondered for a moment if it used this bizarre fluid to alter its surrounds and its appearance.

Whatever the case, it did not matter. I had hurt it, somehow. Like Steve had said, if it could be hurt, it could be killed. I was still alone, but I felt slightly emboldened since I was still alive. Yet that rush faded when I considered what it might try next. I knew I had to regroup with the others.

I moved at a steady pace, trying to remain quiet, while also trying to hurry and find the others. I could barely keep track of the direction I was moving. My eyes darted to every possible angle it could strike again from. I looked at my watch and saw it was after midnight. It was getting closer to the time where the creatures power waxed.

It had almost killed me twice and had killed Cody and who knows who else. We were losing, we had to stop it soon or risk being ripped apart in the dead of the night.

As I moved on, I heard more gunfire and knew that the rest of the group had found it again. I followed the sound just like before and saw a large clearing. In the dim light of the moon, I found Jenny, at least what I hoped was Jenny.

She was frantically pointing her gun at every direction at once. I was not sure how to safely get her attention; she looked manic and terrified. I decided to pump the shotgun, and the mechanical sound drew her attention.

I held my hands up and she let a ragged breath out when he saw me. I tried to get her to move closer so I could see behind her and cover her, but she shook her head. Instead she held up a hand and pointed toward the trees to the north.

Suddenly a voice called out and she snapped back to aiming at the woods and in a trembling voice she spoke,

“Daddy, is that really you?” I froze in fear when I heard her speak, I was worried she had gone crazy, but then a voice answered her.

“Jenny, baby is that you? Help me. This thing, it took me away I think it's going to kill me, please you have to save me!”

The voice was horribly like her father. Down to the exact detail. But he was gone. Taken in the first days of the creatures return. The thing we were hearing couldn't be him. Jenny did not look so convinced, the sound of the voice, the desperation in the plea, she wanted to save her father.

There was a horrible pause, and I prayed that she would not believe the lying shadow.

She took a trembling step forward and the barrel of her riffle lowered slightly. I stood beside her in a flash and leveled the shotgun at the darkness of the trees where the ghostly whispers were emerging from.

I shook my head at her and silently pleaded with her to remember what was happening. She blinked twice and the desperate confusion and hope for saving her father vanished. Reality reasserted itself in her mind. She backed away and leveled her weapon as well as if in silent agreement. Then we both fired simultaneously.

The shots echoed out and we heard the monstrous bulk of the creature barge out of the way, knocking down a small tree as it fled. It shrieked and the discordant echo if its wail changed from an inhuman tone to the crying screams of several different people, many of which we recognized.

The terror of the moment had passed, and Jenny started crying softly to herself. I embraced her and we waited for a moment. I held her head to my shoulder to both comfort her and muffle the sound in case the creature came back and heard us.

“I know this is horrible, but we have to move on, we have to find the others and stop this thing before it is too late.” She wiped the tears from her eyes and took a deep breath,

“I know, I know. I just, can’t believe he is gone. I wanted to hope, to hope somehow, he was still alive. Let’s go, we have to find my brother and the others.”

I nodded my head, and we walked back into the darkness, flashlights seeking the trail that would lead us to them.

As we hurried along we feared the worst as the forest had grown silent again. No gunfire meant that no one was in imminent danger, or it meant that they had been killed and the guns had fallen silent another way.

We saw a glimmer of hope in the sky at just after 1am. A bright red light tore through the dark night and we knew that Steve had fired off the flare gun that he had brought. Now at least, we had a direction. We moved with all haste to try and regroup with the others.

We had almost made it back to the outskirts of town and we could see the river and the sawmill beyond. We thought maybe Steve was trying to bring us there to regroup.

We heard another echoing screech in the forest and the overwhelming din of many voices calling out from everywhere at once. Jenny and I had to cover our ears to not be overwhelmed.

We broke into a run towards the sawmill but saw figures standing outside as we approached. We hoped whoever was there, was really there and it was not a trick.

Suddenly we heard a softer voice, a whisper calling out a name,

“Jenny, Jenny is that you? Where are you, come on just make a sign, do something.”

It was Kyle, we both heard him, but he was talking to someone in the other direction from where we were arriving.

“Kyle please, over here. They are all dead, it got them all, it hurt me, please Kyle help!”

To our horror we heard Jenny’s voice, calling out to Kyle from the tree line. Jenny turned pale, she watched her brother carefully walking toward the tree line to save what he thought was her.

I started to run, but Jenny, who must have figured that the thing already had her voice, decided to call out in desperation,

“Kyle no, that’s not me!”

It was too late though. Moments after acknowledging the voice of his sister from behind him, the trap had worked and the creature was upon him in a flash. He was dragged into the darkness with only a muffled scream and single shot fired wide into a tree.

Jenny screamed again as her brother was taken away. I rushed to her and covered her mouth and tried to carry her along to the sawmill.

She broke down again, unable to cope with another family member being slaughtered. She was nearly catatonic, and I saw it was at least two hundred feet or so to the mill. We still had to move but the thing could strike again.

I saw motion outside the mill and a figured bolted toward us. It looked like Steve and I reached for the shotgun. The figure put a finger to its lips and made a signal with his hands. I did not have much time to doubt, it was almost 2am and the thing was growing bolder in its attacks.

It looked like the real Steve and he helped me take Jenny into the sawmill. We closed the door and I let out an exhausted breath as I sat jenny down near a work bench.

Steve was bleeding from several wounds and looked like he had been shot as well. A ragged hold was in his side and it was still bleeding. I wanted to ask him what we could do, but he held up a hand and pointed to the roof.

I realized what he meant and knew that the thing was up there, it knew we were there and was likely planning on breaking in through the roof or some other point of ambush to finish the rest of us off.

We did not have much time and I broke out my paper and started writing. Before I could finish a sentence, Steve was pointing to the main line of the sawmill and the large conveyor that broke the logs apart. I nodded my head and looked to Jenny who was starting to collect herself again. She looked at me and the terror slowly evaporated. It was replaced by a fatalistic determination. She whispered under her breath,

“Not again, no more deaths. We have to stop this...”

I just nodded my head and Steve did as well. He wrote on his notepad, much faster and clearer than I could in such a short span of time. We read the note quickly,

“Not much time, we have less than ten minutes and then it might be unstoppable. I am hurt bad, I don’t think I am going to make it. I will lure it onto the saw line. You two start the engine and get it going. Flank it, when it comes for me, drop the logs and hopefully it will be crushed and diced apart.”

I was about to protest, but the grim look that Steve gave me made me realize he was determined to end this one way or the other that night. We all tensed in anticipation as Steve looked above us. We heard a shuffling, rattling sound on the panels of the roof and knew time was almost up.

Jenny went to the control panel and I followed the mechanism to the motor and found it was still fueled and could be started anytime. I looked to the others and held my breath.

Steve slowly crawled up onto the conveyor and looked up to the ceiling. He let a soft chuckle out before calling up to the roof in a defiant roar.

“I am right here you bastard, come and get me!” With the challenge issued, I quickly started pulling the cord and getting the engine started. Once it roared to life, I gave the thumbs up to Jenny, and she waited at the control panel for what happened next.

There was a long pause where all we heard was the thrumming of the saws motor. Then the ceiling crashed in on itself. A moving blur was down to the ground in an instant and Steve was thrown back several feet nearly landing on the idle saw. He managed to throw himself up to his feet and open fire on the creature as it evaded the shots and surged toward him once more.

Over the roaring gunfire Steve screamed,

“Do it, hit it now!”

Jenny did not hesitate, even knowing what would happen to him.

She hit the control, and the blade spun to life and the track began to move. We thought the plan had worked but the creature had started to grasp the conveyor, and it sputtered and halted.

It grasped Steve by the throat and it began to squeeze the life out of him. In the gasping choking sounds he made I thought I heard him mumble something,

“I hope you choke on it.” He had pulled a small device from his pocket and after a moment it exploded, sending a shower of shrapnel through the undulating flesh of the monster. It howled in pain as it was shredded, and Steve was thrown to the ground in a bloody heap.

To our horror it was not dead yet. It started to move toward us again and I rushed forward. Just as it started to go after Jenny who was frozen near the control panel, I fired the shotgun at point blank range. The force of the blast caused it to reel and fall back onto the conveyor and Jenny saw her chance. She hit the panel again and the crane overhead dropped a large log onto the conveyor, crushing the creature in place.

It howled in pain and tried to escape. It triggered a painful and blinding aura of bright shifting lights that alternated in its desperate shrieks as it tried to free itself. All the while it cried out in all the horrible chorus of the voices of the dead, but to no avail.

We were both transfixed as we watched the otherworldly abomination rendered helpless as it and the log shifted toward the spinning saw. Then both were cleanly cut in half. The miasma of gore and stench that permeated the place was sickening. I thought I might pass out from the smell alone.

The death throes of that abomination though, will haunt my nightmares forever. As it died, it cried for help in the voices of so many people all at once. A dirge of uncontrolled despair as the things hideous life came to a halt and the voices of the dead were silent once again.

The hunt was over and by some miracle we had prevailed.

Jenny and I returned home. In the next few days, the others were retrieved from the woods and given proper burials. We had been celebrated as heroes, but we did not feel the part. We had lost almost everyone else we cared for. So many sacrifices to stop the monster that had plagued us.

In time I decided to leave. I could not bear to live there any longer.  Jenny stayed to take care of her mom and was disappointed I was leaving, but the memories were too painful. I promised I would stay in touch and for a while I did, but eventually time went on and we lost contact. My past became a distant memory.

If that was the end, then I would be grateful. I wish I could have retired a hero and never seen that place again. Yet something has happened, something that compels me to speak out, to act and to warn others that the danger is not over.

It has been eight years since the last hunt, and I received a call from Jenny last night. She called at 2am. I did not know what to make of it when she spoke with me for the first time in a while,

“How are you? It’s been a long time.” I answered, but was confused by the sudden call and the time of night,

“Jenny? I’m alright, I guess. Why are you calling so early in the morning? Is everything alright?” There was a long pause, and she responded,

“Everything is fine silly. I just wanted to know......Was it worth it?”

“Sorry?” I asked in confusion. “Was what worth it?”

There was a disturbing gurgling sound on the other end of the line and suddenly the voice had changed and the person on the other end of the line sounded like Kyle.

“Sacrificing everyone else of course, letting your friends die.......Was it worth it?” I nearly dropped the phone as my blood froze. The voice of Kyle continued,

“We think you should come home. We.....”  The voice changed one last time, now sounding like Steve,

“We...have unfinished business here. Hurry back....back for another hunt.....back for a little reunion.....with your friends and family.”

My heart sank and I hung up the phone. I did not understand it, how? How had it survived? Had it survived? or were there more of those things!?

However it came back or multiplied, it did not matter.

I know what I have to do. The sinking feeling in my gut reminds me as I leave this account and plan my next course of action.

I have to go back, back to find out what happened to those I left behind, back to save those that are still alive and back to stop that thing once and for all or die trying.

Because if I can’t, well soon no one will be safe anymore.

Wish me luck and hopefully you will hear from me again.
