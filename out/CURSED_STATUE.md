Before telling about my experience, let me introduce myself. I am Ahmet. In August last year, I lost my wife Ceyda and my daughter Gamze, my only princess, in a traffic accident. The car Ceyda was driving went under a truck. After my parents' deaths, I thought nothing could hurt me more than this. I'm all alone now. Believe me, I have never gone out in the past year except to go to work. I work in a quarry. Most of the time when I'm at home, I just stare at the wall and think about them sitting across from me. One day, I was browsing a second-hand product site on my phone. I came across the colorless statue of a very beautiful woman who was combing her hair. It strangely caught my attention. As I looked at the woman, it was as if I saw Ceyda. I immediately called the seller.

"Hello?"

"Hello, hello. I'm Ahmet. I saw the statue you offered for sale on the internet. If it is still for sale, I want to buy it tomorrow."

"Of course, I will text you the address."

"Okay then, see you tomorrow."

After I hung up the phone, the seller sent me the address via text message. He wanted me to be there at 07:30 pm.

I felt like I was really going to see my wife tomorrow. A feeling I had never experienced before was swirling inside me. I don't even know how to describe it. I couldn't sleep until the morning. After work, I got ready and took my car with a box at the back and headed towards the address. I was driving by looking through navigation. I never opened it and looked until I started going to the address. The address showed a village 27km away from the city. I was starting to move away from the city. I started to see the signs of the village and now I entered a path. There was a real gloom on the road. The trees were so thick and looked like they came out of a horror movie that they blocked out the sky and cast a slight darkness on the ground. When I finally entered the village, I took out my phone to call the seller. The village looked as if it had been abandoned. There was no one outside. As far as I could see, there were 6 houses not too close to each other. The houses were made of wood and none of the lights were on except for one house. The seller did not answer my phone call. I pulled the car over and went downstairs. As I looked around in the darkness, I had the feeling that I was being watched.

At this exact moment my phone rang. The seller of the statue was calling.

"Hello?"

“Brother, I think you have come. “I see a car outside.”

"Yes I came. Where are you?"

“I'll be with you in a moment.” He said and hung up the phone.

I put my phone in my pocket and took out my cigarette from my other pocket and lit it. While I was looking around again, I saw a black silhouette in front of the white curtain of the house in front of me, the lights of which were off. This image scared me a little. I think he realized I was looking at him and slowly ducked under the curtain and disappeared. It was getting darker and the dimly lit street lamps were illuminating the areas directly below them due to their distance from each other.

“It was Ahmet, wasn't it?”

Startled, I turned back.

"You scared me. “Y-yes, Ahmet.” I said.

"Welcome. "I'm Recep, let's go to the house right across the street." Said. Pointing to the house whose silhouette I had just seen.

“Your village is very quiet. "It looks like no one is alive." I said with a small smile.

“Let's say they are not actually very hospitable. They don't go out much when they know someone is coming. He said with a straight face.

We started walking towards the house and Recep started talking again.

“This house was my grandmother's house. It wasn't long ago that he passed away. He was dealing with slightly different things. Anyway, I started selling the valuable things I saw in his house. She has no children other than my father, and I am her only grandchild. In short, whatever remained of him became mine.” Said.

“My condolences, Mr. Recep. If you don't mind, there's something I'm curious about. What kind of different things did he do? I said curiously.

“You'll see it when you enter the house.” He said sternly and unlocked the door.

I stepped inside behind Recep, trying to reassure myself by thinking that what I had just seen in the window was some kind of optical illusion.

There was a strong musty smell inside. The items were really old. Some of the rooms had things hanging from the ceiling. I couldn't understand what they were. But from the moment I entered the house, I felt like someone was walking with me right behind my neck.

“There it is!” said Recep in a loud voice. The moment I saw the statue, I literally forgot everything. I approached her and touched her face.

“How can you be so much like her?” I said.

"To who?" asked Recep.

"Ha? Well, nothing important. I just thought out loud, I guess.” I said. Recep continued talking.

“I have seen this statue in this house for as long as I can remember. But I guess my grandmother couldn't find a place for this statue. Every time I came, I would see it either in a different place or in a changed direction. Who knows what difficulties that old woman had to endure. Anyway, as you can see, my grandmother was the healer of this village.” He said, turning towards my face. I just looked at him like I didn't understand and he continued talking.

“I always saw her making amulets for someone. Protective things. Although I don't understand much, she used lard, soap, little dolls and always a piece of paper. I've never been someone who knows much about this business. "She always said he did it to protect someone." He said and put his hand on the statue's shoulder. Just because I don't understand much about these things;

"Really? How nice. “My condolences again.”

"Thank you. Well, let's carry this to your car. You're taking it, aren't you?

“Y-y-yes I get it.” I said and grabbed the statue by its feet. Just as we picked up the statue and walked towards the door, the door slammed shut. I suddenly turned my head in that direction with a start. Recep motioned with his head for me to take down the statue and open the door.

"I told you. They are not very hospitable. “They started playing games with us.” said Recep.

"Is it a game? Kids? "I didn't hear any footsteps, maybe the wind blew it." I said, but there was really no wind blowing outside.

“Not the kids! Not the wind! JINNS!” he said, looking into my eyes and continuing his words.

“This happens every time I call someone to sell something from this house. "They don't want us to take the furniture out of the house, they have adopted it all." He said in a flat and steady voice.

“Look brother. "I don't know much about such things, but if it means getting into trouble, let's not do this transaction." I said.

“Nothing will happen, open the door and let's load this into your car.” Said.

We loaded the statue into the car and I made sure that the lock of the back case was securely locked. I turned around and extended my hand to greet Recep, but he wasn't behind me. He walked a little towards his grandmother's house, stopped, and had his back turned to me.

"Recep! "You didn't take the money." I called out.

“..." he didn't answer.

"Recep!" I called out again and he turned around and came to me. He reached out and took the money.

"Take care of yourself." He said dully and took a few steps back.

“You too.” I said and started walking towards the driver's seat to get into my car. As I opened the door, I saw Recep looking at me from my rearview mirror, one step behind me, and I quickly turned back. But he wasn't behind me. He was still standing in the same place and looking at me expressionlessly.

“What the hell kind of place is this?” I mumbled and got into my car and started driving home. There was about 5 km left until I reached home, and since I started going back, I had a deep sense of peace inside me. Finally, I returned home and barely dragged the statue and left it in my bedroom, right in front of the window. Her face was turned to the glass. I looked at the clock and it was showing 11:27 pm. Not being away from home for a long time and carrying the statue really tired my body. I immediately threw myself into bed and fell asleep immediately. When I woke up to go to work in the morning to the sound of my alarm, my eyes first fell on the statue. Her face was turned towards me. I'm pretty sure I turned it towards the glass. How can this happen? Thinking that maybe I woke up groggily at night and turned it around like this, I got ready and went to work. 2. At night I went back to bed to sleep. A clicking sound coming from the living room caught my attention, but I ignored it and tried to sleep. I was about to fall asleep, but I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. The statue was still facing me. She looked like Ceyda. I ran my hand over her stiff hair, turned her towards the window, and returned to my bed. But it's still the same feeling. I was feeling restless, angry... and many other emotions that I cannot describe at the same time. The living room lamp turned on and went off by itself.

“What the hell is going on!” I said to myself.

The lamp blinked again. I stood up feeling very frightened and started walking towards the living room. I stuck my head out and looked around in the darkness, but I couldn't see anything. I took 3 steps forward and turned on the living room lamp. It looked empty. When I turned off the lamp and turned around, I saw a woman's silhouette entering my bedroom with quick steps.

"HEY!" I shouted and ran into the room after her.

There was nothing in the room, but the statue caught my attention. She was looking towards the living room. Well, I didn't do that. When I turned back, I saw a silhouette walking towards me from the living room. I extend my hand forward.

"DON'T DO THAT! PLEASE! WHO ARE YOU?"

When I opened my eyes, I found myself in bed, sweating profusely. I looked at the statue. She was facing the window and it was 03:27 am. I realized that I was dreaming.

I went to the toilet to splash some water on my face. When I started washing my face, a sound of scissors started coming from the shower cabin with its doors closed. When I suddenly turned my head towards the frosted glass of the shower cabin, I saw a black silhouette standing behind it.

I slowly pulled the door aside. Inside was a woman whose body was black from burning and full of wounds. She was cutting her dirty hair. When she started to turn her head towards me, I saw that it was Ceyda. She looked at my face and started grunting as if he was trying to say something.

“C-C-Ceyda?” I said, surprised and scared.

In front of Ceyda, my daughter put her burned body forward, just like her mother, and looked at me. Her eyes were completely black. I stepped back from the toilet and closed the door.

I turned around and lifted my head. Ceyda screamed in my face.

When I opened my eyes again, I woke up in my bedroom. The statue's face was facing me. It was 03:28 am. I heard walking coming from the living room to my bedroom. I immediately jumped up and ran to close and lock the door. Just as I was about to close my door, the bell rang. I was torn between whether to open the door or not, and it rang again. I started walking slowly towards the apartment door. I looked through the door hole and there was no one there. As I was about to turn around and go back to the bedroom, this time someone literally punched the door. I suddenly turned and opened the door, but again there was no one there. I shut the door.

"No matter what happens in the morning, I will taking the fucking statue back to that man." I said to myself and went back to my room.

The fear inside me was now replaced by irresistible anger. I returned to my bed, kicking and punching the furniture in the house, and pressed my head into the pillow and started crying. I heard a knock on the bedroom door, which was open at the time, and I turned around. My wife and daughter were looking at me by the door. Their skin was rotten and their eyes were black. They were smiling at me in a disturbing way. My body was literally locked up. I couldn't even scream. I don't know how long they stood there, but when the morning prayer began to be recited, they turned around and walked towards the hall. After about 2 minutes, I looked all over the house but there was nothing. I immediately loaded the statue into my car and headed towards the village. It was 07:02 am when I arrived at the village.

"Which house does this guy live in? RECEEEEEP!" I shouted as I took the statue down from my vehicle.

"RECEEEP! I DON'T WANT YOUR STATUE, NOR YOUR MONEY! JUST TAKE THAT BACK FROM ME!" I shouted. As I raised my head and looked around, something terrifying caught my attention.

There were black silhouettes in the windows of each of the 6 houses and they were literally watching me. Their faces or clothes were not visible. Just black silhouettes.

"FUCK! ENOUGH!" I quickly jumped into my car and headed home.

Maybe I'm going crazy, or maybe loneliness isn't that good for me anymore. But as God is my witness, I saw everything I experienced with my own eyes. After the incident, I called Recep, but the answering machine said there was no such number. Ever since I removed the statue from my house, everything has been fine and everything is the same as before. Actually... in a way it is. Namely, every night after this incident, there is a knock on my bedroom door at 04:00 am. My wife and daughter are looking at me, holding hands with their rotting bodies. But... they're not smiling anymore. In one way or another. I'm not crazy and... I still enjoy sharing my bedroom with my family.
