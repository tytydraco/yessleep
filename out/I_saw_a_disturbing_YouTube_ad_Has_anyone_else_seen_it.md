After work, I do the exact same thing every day. I crack open a cold can of Diet Dr. Pepper, put my feet up, and watch an hour or two of funny videos on YouTube. I always plan to do something productive—cook a healthy dinner, go for a run, make progress on my paintings—but I never do. I’m always too exhausted from work to do anything else.

I don’t think humans were built to work 8 hours a day. Sitting in the same room, at the same desk, in front of the same computer. I think we’re just forced to accept this as the norm because greedy CEOs have *made* it the norm. But, I digress…

All you need to know is that tonight was no different than any other night. I popped the can open. Put my feet up. Opened my laptop.

Clicked on a funny YouTube video about the ridiculousness of *Twilight.*

But then I froze.

I’d expected an ad to pop up. Instead, there was a message over where the video should play—bold white letters over black.

YOUR VIDEO WILL START SHORTLY!

WOULD YOU LIKE TO VIEW A 15 SECOND AD,

OR REMOVE 15 SECONDS FROM YOUR LIFE?

I squinted at the screen. *What?* I’d never seen anything like this. I looked down at where the progress bar would be, thinking it was actually an ad itself. But there wasn’t any bar, and there wasn’t a “Skip” button, either.

*What is this?*

After staring at it for a minute, I decided it must be some new thing YouTube was rolling out. Like when, instead of an ad, they show you some sort of poll. *Is this ad relevant to you? Have you ever bought anything from these companies? Help our sponsor by answering the following question…*

My mouse hovered over the two buttons. *15-SECOND AD. REMOVE 15 SECONDS OF LIFE.*

Out of curiosity, I clicked the latter.

The video started playing. Immediately—no ad. *Well, that’s cool.* When the video was over, I popped some leftovers in the microwave, and started another video. Again, instead of an ad, I got the same prompt.

YOUR VIDEO WILL START SHORTLY!

WOULD YOU LIKE TO VIEW A 30 SECOND AD,

OR REMOVE 30 SECONDS FROM YOUR LIFE?

I let out a little laugh and clicked on *REMOVE 30 SECONDS OF LIFE.*

The video started to play.

But only a few seconds into the video, I heard the microwave beep.

*Already?*

*I put it on for one minute.*

*There’s no way it’s already done…*

Confused, I paused the video and walked into the kitchen. The microwave had stopped its cycle. I pulled out the food out—and it was warm.

*But it was only in there for like, ten seconds.*

A sense of unease settled in my stomach. I picked up my bowl of mushy chicken alfredo and walked back to the computer. Then I clicked on another video.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO VIEW A 30 SECOND AD,

OR REMOVE 30 SECONDS FROM YOUR LIFE?

My cursor hovered over the REMOVE button.

But something stopped me. Something felt… off. *The food… it was almost like…* I shook my head. There was no way.

*It was almost like I skipped ahead in time.*

“That’s impossible,” I muttered to myself. But then I had an idea. I pulled out my phone, put it on the counter, and pulled up the stopwatch.

I hit the stopwatch—

Then I immediately clicked *REMOVE 30 SECONDS OF LIFE.*

The video started immediately.

But when I looked down at the stopwatch, my heart dropped.

It read *32 seconds*.

Nonono. There was no *way* thirty seconds had gone by. I *just* clicked the button, a few seconds ago.

*What the fuck?!*

My heart pounded in my ears. I glanced around the room. Then I tried it again. My finger shook as I lowered it onto the phone screen.

*Tap. Click.*

The stopwatch read *32 seconds.*

*But it didn’t feel like 30 seconds. It felt like two seconds.* Anxiety slipped into me like lead, weighing me down. My legs felt weak.

I picked up the phone and texted my friend Chris.

*Can you come over? Or can I come over to your place? I need to talk to someone.*

I waited for a few minutes. He didn’t reply.

It was late. Almost 10. I set the phone down and stared at the paused video, my heart pounding.

And then I had another idea.

I set my phone down on a shelf across from me. Propped it up against some books. Pressed the RECORD button. Then I walked back over to my desk, sat down, and clicked on another YouTube video.

YOUR VIDEO WILL START SHORTLY!

WOULD YOU LIKE TO VIEW A 60 SECOND AD,

OR REMOVE 60 SECONDS FROM YOUR LIFE?

*60 seconds now?!* I sucked in a deep breath. Glanced up at the phone, the black eye of the camera looking down at me.

My cursor hovered over the ‘REMOVE’ button.

I clicked.

The video immediately began to play.

I got up and walked over to the phone. Picked it up and stopped the recording.

The length of the video was 1 minute, 17 seconds.

*What. The. Fuck.*

I went over to the sink and splashed water on my face. Checked the clock a few times, pinched myself, to make sure I wasn’t dreaming. Then I picked my phone back up.

The recording was still there.

All one minute, seventeen seconds of it.

*This is so fucking weird.*

I sat back down. Then I opened the video and, with a deep breath, pressed PLAY.

I watched myself walk over to the seat in front of the computer. Then I sat down. I held my breath as my fingers went to the touchpad, clicking the REMOVE button.

*Click.*

Video-me stared at the computer screen. With incredible intensity—like I was watching the most riveting thing I’d ever seen in my life. My mouth hung slightly open, and my normally fidgety hands were still on the desk. I was just *staring,* with everything in me.

At first, no audio came out of the computer’s speakers. I was expecting a loud jingle for an insurance company, or a chirpy female voice telling me about laundry detergent, but it was just silence.

Until, ten seconds in, I heard a high-pitched whine.

It sounded like the noise old TVs make when you leave them on. Or ringing in your ears. A mechanical tone so high-pitched it’s almost out of the range of human hearing.

And when the tone sounded, video-me’s hands flew to the keyboard.

And they began feverishly typing.

I stood there, frozen, watching the video. Watching my fingers race across the keyboard. My eyes staring at the screen with absolute concentration. My mouth still hanging open. I thought I could see a silvery strand of drool falling from my lips, onto the desk.

*What the actual fuck?*

I briefly glanced away from the phone, to my desk—and noticed a small puddle of liquid shining in the low light.

*What was I typing?*

*Was the ad, or whatever YouTube was showing me… was it MAKING me do this?*

Because I looked dazed. Hypnotized. Controlled.

As the video approached its end, I saw video-me snap out of it. I closed my mouth. My hands started to fidget. I got out of the seat and walked towards the phone on the shelf.

And that was it.

I stood there, frozen, the silence ringing in my ears. *This is crazy. Absolutely insane.* It was conspiracy-level stuff—YouTube is mind-controlling people through ads that erase time! Quick, block YouTube on every device that you own!

If I had been on anything—hell, if I’d even had a glass of wine—I would’ve blamed it on that in an instant. But I was stone-cold sober.

I walked back over to the computer and put my hand on the screen, about to close it.

But then I paused.

I couldn’t see the computer screen in the video—it was the wrong angle. But if I put the phone behind me, I could see what I was typing.

*No. You’re not doing that again,* my inner voice instantly protested. *Close the laptop and get out of here.*

But I couldn’t. Curiosity was tugging at me—I had to know what I was doing. I quickly propped the phone up behind me and sat back down at the computer.

I clicked on another video.

YOUR VIDEO WILL START SHORTLY!

WOULD YOU LIKE TO VIEW A 60 SECOND AD,

OR REMOVE 60 SECONDS FROM YOUR LIFE?

I took a deep, shuddering breath.

Then I clicked REMOVE.

The video instantly began to play. But I knew that was just from my point of view. I grabbed my phone from behind me and, sure enough—the recording time read 1 minute, 6 seconds.

I swallowed.

And then I hit PLAY.

What I saw was so ridiculous that I should’ve laughed. It should’ve been the funniest thing I saw all week. But instead I stared at the screen, my heart plummeting further and further.

Where the ad had been, there was instead a textbox. In it, I was typing the same six words, over and over.

I WANT TO BUY SPARKLE DETERGENT.

I WANT TO BUY SPARKLE DETERGENT.

I WANT TO BUY SPARKLE…

I must’ve written it fifty times before the minute was up. Then the textbox disappeared, and the video started to play. I watched video-me get up, turn around, and turn off the recording.

I slammed the laptop shut and went straight to bed, my heart racing in my chest. When I couldn’t sleep, pulled out my phone and began searching for this phenomenon. Typing keywords into Google like, *weird youtube ad, youtube remove 30 seconds from life,* etc.

Nothing came up.

But it doesn’t end there.

Because I could’ve sworn it was around 2:30 AM when I started searching. And I could’ve sworn I spent no more than a half hour Googling.

But when I checked the time after closing out of all my tabs, it was nearly *four* AM.

I think I lost an entire hour.

And I have no way of finding out what happened—what I was typing, or watching, or being brainwashed to buy—in that hour.
