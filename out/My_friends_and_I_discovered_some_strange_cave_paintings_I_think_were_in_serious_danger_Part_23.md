My stomach twisted itself into knots. I bolted upright and clumsily fumbled with my phone. 

“Call Stacey. I’ll call Andrew.”

“I’ll try, but I already texted her, and none of my messages would send. Juan, what if someone kidnapped them?” she whimpered, tears threatening to spill down her cheeks. 

I gingerly took Julia’s hands in mine.

“Hey, look at me. They’re going to be okay. Maybe they just wanted to find somewhere to mess around without waking us up. They probably turned their phones off so they wouldn’t be interrupted. I’m sure they’re fine.”

My words seemed to alleviate her fears. 

“You’re probably right. That does sound like something Stacey would do.”

“Yeah, you know her. She can never stay in one place for too long. She has more energy than a two-year-old husky. Let’s go back to sleep. If they’re not back by the morning, we’ll call the cops.”

She nodded, reuniting with me under the covers. I stroked her long voluminous hair until she was lulled back to dreamland. I eventually drifted off myself, that uneasy feeling in my stomach never fully dissipating. 

I yawned and stretched my arms above my head. I squinted as sunlight beamed into our room. Julia lazily sat up. She glanced over to Andrew and Stacey’s vacant bed. She began to hyperventilate, staring up at me, concern usurping her visage. 

“They’re still not back. Why aren’t they here? Juan, they should’ve come back by now.” 

“You’re right. Call Stacey. Hopefully they’re just at breakfast.”

She dialed Stacey’s number. Straight to voicemail. I tried Andrew. Same result. 

“What are we going to do? They left in the middle of the night and they’re not answering their phones. I’m so scared,” Julia said as her body began to quiver. 

I held her, hoping to offer some sliver of consolation. 

“I’m calling the cops and reporting them missing. In the meantime, we can go down to the front desk and ask if they saw anything fishy. It’s going to be alright. They’ll turn up.”

I called the police from my phone, and we made our way to the lobby. I requested for the concierge to check the footage from the night prior. 

“What do you mean the cameras aren’t working?! This is a four-star hotel!” 

“Sir, please calm down. There’s nothing I can do. A serviceman is scheduled to repair them today.”

“B.S. I’m going to have the cops check them, and I swear if you give them a different answer, I’ll have your job quicker than you can say ‘fired.’”

“Sir, feel free to do so, but that doesn’t change the fact that our cameras *are* broken. If you don’t compose yourself, I’m going to have to ask you to leave.”

“Come on, Juan. Let’s just go,” Julia squeaked dejectedly. 

“Okay. Look, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to lash out at you. This whole thing is really getting to me.”

“It’s quite alright. Best of luck finding your friends.”

Julia and I turned to wait for the police to arrive. Out of my periphery, I could see the disgruntled worker roll her eyes. Just as we made to sit, two brawny officers sauntered through the doors. I tentatively approached them.

“Hi, I’m Juan. I’m the one who called,” I said, extending a hand.

One of them shook it, nearly pulverizing every bone in my fingers. He lowered his sunglasses from the bridge of his nose and leered at Julia.

“And your name is, miss?”

“Julia Salgado,” she timidly murmured, staring holes into her feet.

“Alright, son. I’m going to need you to explain. Give us the whole story.”

We claimed a quartet of vacant chairs, and I disclosed all the events from the moment we’d gotten there, right up to our chat, obviously omitting Julia and my intimate moment. 

“And you’re *sure* that it was Malsumis written on that wall?” 

“Yeah, I’m fairly certain,” looking to Julia for reassurance. She nodded in agreement. 

His partner flipped his little notebook closed and the pair stood. 

“We’ll send out a search party, but I’ll be frank with you. If that really was Malsumis’s cave you stumbled upon, your friends would be extremely lucky to be alive. As for you two, I’d stay the hell away from that thing. Someone from the department will contact you if there’s any update in the case.”

I gulped, a dry lump forming in my throat. They left us there, the officer’s words festering in my mind. Lucky to be alive? It had to be some hushed superstition amongst the locals. There was no way we happened to trespass in some malicious deity’s evil lair, right? I glanced at Julia. All the color had drained from her face. Her eyes were frantic, rapidly darting around the room.

“Juan, what do we do? What did he mean by that?”

“I don’t know. There’s not much else we can do.”

“I was afraid you might say that.”

We spent the remainder of the day sulking in the hotel room, praying for our companions’ safe return. Eventually, Julia suggested that we drive around on the off chance we might spot them. I readily agreed, itching for a little fresh air to assuage the somber atmosphere. Long story short, we didn’t find them. We defeatedly trundled back to our tropical purgatory, fatigued and deflated. We slumped onto the bed beside one another, wishing our nightmare would come to an end.

“We never should have come here…”

Julia furrowed her brows. 

“What do you mean?”

“I told Andrew that we should’ve gone somewhere closer to home, but Stacey insisted on going to the beach. I shouldn’t have let her persuade him. I should’ve been more persistent. This is all my fault.”

I shamefully sobbed as Julia rolled over to face me. 

“Juan. None of this is your fault. We both know that when Stacey gets an idea in her head, there’s no telling her otherwise. It’ll be okay. We’ll find them. We have to,” she said, with the first spark of confidence I’d witnessed the entire trip. 

She softly wiped the tears away from my cheeks. I wrapped my arms around her and held her tightly. 

“You know, I hate that we’re in this situation, but I’m really glad I have you here,” I sniffled.

“I’m glad I have you too.”

I awoke with a start in the middle of the night. I tapped my phone screen, momentarily blinding me as light flooded the dark room. Ten minutes past midnight. My heart stopped. A silhouette stood motionless at the door. I turned on my flashlight, and hesitantly pointed it at the figure. It was Julia. I hopped out of bed, calling out to her. She faced away from me, unmoving. 

“Julia? Julia, come back to bed.”

She remained still as a statue. I promptly trotted up to her. She was fruitlessly grappling at the door handle, her flaccid fingers sliding off the cool metal like she was being controlled by a marionette. 

“Julia, what are you doing?”

Silence. Her hand went limp, slipping from the door and dropping flatly to her side.  I tilted her head toward me. Her eyes were glazed over, not a hint of recognition behind her glassy pupils. 

“He’s calling to me.”

“Who? Who’s calling to you?”

She incrementally rotated her head to face me, locking her cold milky eyes onto mine. 

“Malsumis.”

Julia began violently thrusting herself into the door. Sheer panic surged through me. I darted to the bathroom, swiftly filling a plastic cup with cold water. I sprinted back to her. She was cackling now. A voice that was not her own emanated from deep within her chest. 

“She will come to me. And you are powerless to stop it.”

I immediately splashed the water in her face. She blinked, then turned to me. 

“Juan? Why am I wet? Why am I standing here?”

“I don’t know. I woke up and you were standing at the door. You must’ve been sleepwalking,” I said, discreetly slipping the plastic cup into the trash. 

“That’s weird. I’ve never done that before.”

“Must be the stress.”

“Yeah, must be.”

She cleaned herself up and climbed back into bed with me. I double checked that the chain lock was firmly latched before joining her. I held her close, hoping that I would be able to prevent her from sneaking away again. I was subsequently able to settle my palpitating heart, and we both dozed into a fitful slumber. 

I rolled onto my side. I grasped aimlessly at the air, perplexed as to why I couldn’t locate Julia’s dormant form. I blearily forced open my eyes. She wasn’t there.
