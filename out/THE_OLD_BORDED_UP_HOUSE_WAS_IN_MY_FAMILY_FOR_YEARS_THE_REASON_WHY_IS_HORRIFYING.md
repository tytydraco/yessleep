This was written by my *9 year old* daughter a big No Sleep fan so be gentle.

I had just moved here, to Spantamira. It was actually a ok neighborhood but one thing always struck me as odd. The house fire that appeared during a BLACKOUT, and the other weird thing. The thing that changed everything. That made me question reality. Question my very being.

The old house. It had always been a mystery. Boards on all the doors and windows except one cracked window that led to dark attic. I used to peek at it through my own attic, and I would find pictures while searching. My attick was full of photos, but these were older. Stranger. Supernatural, in a sort. I blew off dust and grime. Though the first picture was worn by age, I could make out three figures: My dad, a woman, tied by bonds, as if she was screaming for help, and a weird distorted figure. Ski mask. Hasmat suit. But... It was holding the mask. And..... It had NO face. The photo was labeled 3/19/1987. First experiment with Doctor. Lovinsky. Female. 24. Me, being 11, thought nothing of it. Finding games like Super Smash Bros more interesting and retreating to my room

I only thought of it again after seeing my father the last time. He had a horrible heart disease. I made it just in time to see him. Once. He handed me the keys. His last words: Read the message. His last breath. I was depressed. Deeply. We were very close. We might never be again after the things I found out. After a year, I pulled myself together. Just as soon, everything came back to me. The note. The house. Everything. And there were 2 keys. One to the house. One to the back door. It wasn't boarded. I had to "Read the message" first. And.... Find out what message.

So I had a lot to do. I found horrifying photo after horrifying photo. And each with different distorted figures and patients. The distortions got worse. Snail eyes. No body. Alien- like protrusions everywhere. Until…. I noticed. My dad didn’t have a heart disease. He had become one of them. His distortion was a protruding heart. The others, I guessed must be immortal. Each photo they got older as their numbers grew till the patients started floating above a pentagram with a big circle of immortals around.I remember the last photo. Signed in MY DADS blood. It said, "you betrayed us". Then I found it. The message. It said: FIND THE DOOR BEFORE THEY GET THERE. DESTROY THE BLUE BOTTLE BEFORE THEY FIND THEIR LAST EXPERIMENT.HURRY. BEFORE ITS TOO LATE. Scrawled hastily. NOT like my dad. He ALWAYS wrote nicely.

I needed to get there. Fast. I hurriedly grabbed the keys and ran for the house. I didn’t have a car, being as broke ass as me, so I had to run 5 miles in the rain. Barefoot. In pajamas. So when I got there I was wet and bleeding from my cut feet. I lived in a bad neighborhood, with drunkards stumbling like undead through the streets. Then I realized. I dropped the key. I fumbled for it on the ground until my knees, hands, and even face were stained with glass. They seemed to form a mosaic. Run. Run. Run. Run. But I stood still. Frozen by rain, and fear. But I found courage. Somehow. To this day I don’t know how. I worked on the lock for a few minutes( classic me: sucks at locks), then the door gave away. I stepped in. The smell of strong chemicals filled the house, and I ran that way, my brain powering my legs forward. Then I saw it. The potion. But then I saw something else. Every portrait of the distorted other-world creatures read my last name.Grandpa, Great Grandma, the last one: My Dad, crossed out with blood. I felt sick. I blacked out. I don’t know how long. But when I woke up, I was stuck in some sort of weird glass tube that looked like it was strait from a horror movie. Apparently this was one. The THINGS were all subjects of experiments. Now I would become one too. That one figure, the completely CHANGED one. Soon I will be changed. I let everyone down.

But…. I saw them then. They hovered above and I screamed. A flash. A photo for the record. I would never speak again. But then the potion was poured. And…. I appeared again. This land was the same except….. different. Completely red and orange with blue streaks on the front. But… it also wasn’t the world. It was the family portrait. The one that disappeared years ago in the house fire. That now I know how was set. A blackout. A sudden fire. All part of an accursed plan drive us back to Grandpa’s childhood home. With no other options. Back to the house. Forced to smile in a perfect painting forever. Or at least until it finished burning. Those streaks were FIRE. In the real world. Luckily I still have my phone. I was using it during the long hours posing for the portrait. It’s my last hope for help.

The phone is at ten percent, and it’s power saving. I must get out quickly. I’m panicking, but can barely move. It’s a painting. My life is flashing before my eyes. Is this the end? Help. Before it’s too late.
