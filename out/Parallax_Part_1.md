It’s a real one. Or should I say as real as it gets. And yes, I know how that can sound here on Reddit under this thread. You’ll still take it with a grain of salt, think of it as some internet fiction—but bear with me.

There are times when, out of the blue, I have this wild recollection. About the duality of man. Real evil hiding in plain sight. Lost childhood friendship. 

That’s what this story is really about. 



**For the sake of privacy and the safety of my loved ones, I’ve changed some of the names. Some locations. Some details.** 



I was around 11 years old then. My parents and I had moved to new country when I was 2, so pretty much my whole life I’d been treated as a native. Just one from the herd. The city we settled in had this strange, sleepy rhythm—a mix of industrial grit and serene mountain views. Its old cobblestone streets twisted unpredictably, lined with gray, weather-beaten buildings that seemed permanently damp from the mist rolling down from the hills. 

My dad’s an architect—interiors, mostly. Back then, he was in his early 30s, trying to break into a new, closed-off market with nothing but talent and a bit of luck. No connections, just grit. He couldn’t afford to be picky about clients.

That’s how he met M. 

A man in his mid-to-late 40s, deeply connected in the city. He owned a custom car shop near his apartment—a place that screamed money, with gleaming sports cars parked outside, despite its grimy facade of rust-streaked walls and oil-stained pavement. The contrast between mechanical grit and the wealth on display felt almost surreal, like something out of a forgotten early-2000s TV crime drama. M. wanted something more upscale, something that matched the sleek cars parked outside.

He looked... interesting, to say the least. Tall, about 190 cm, very well-built, bald, with small, round, Potter-like glasses. He radiated a quiet intensity, something stoic and unreadable. How do I remember all this? Because my dad and M. clicked almost instantly.

M. admired my dad’s ability to adapt modern designs to any space, no matter how unconventional. Business turned into bonding. Families met.

I vividly remember the night M. invited us over for a movie screening—*Van Helsing* with Hugh Jackman, one of those corny early-2000s action flicks. 

He had a proper setup: a projector and a vintage Bose surround system that made his apartment feel like a small, private theater—a rare luxury in early-2000s Eastern European country, where such tech still felt like something out of a catalog. It was mesmerizing back then.

The audience that night was... eclectic: me, my parents, M., his 10 year old son Oscar, his wife Diana and Tess.

Who was Tess, you might ask? Well, it took quite a while before my mom explained that to me.

But we will get to that in a minute. Let’s focus on Oscar first because it’s through our then-friendship that I was able to observe and spend time within this particular environment.

Oscar was a year younger than me—a chubby little kid who loved watching MTV and *Viva La Bam* on the small TV in his room. He was funny. Loud.

We both had PS2s, which at the time was a massive social currency at school. A lot of my classmates wanted to come over after school and play *Tekken 4*. I know it’s silly to brag about now, but back then it really meant something.

My parents lived very differently from M’s. They had it rough. We lived in a house that wasn’t even ours—my dad rented the place, but it was practically a raw, unfinished development. Part of the deal with the homeowner was that my dad had to pay out of pocket for basic renovations just so we could move in. The house was near a small creek, which meant the basement got damp and moldy every autumn.

But despite its flaws, I loved that house. The only room my parents could afford to properly renovate and furnish was mine. Can you believe that? 

I had my own big room—something unheard of among my friends. Being an only child definitely had its perks. I didn’t have trouble being sociable—I loved being around others—but I also had no problem making up my own adventures. I’d spend hours in the backyard swinging sticks like a Jedi, pretending my force-push could knock over anything in my path.

Oscar wanted to show me his room, and as soon as we walked in, my eyes landed on a *Tekken Tag Tournament* box sitting on his desk. That instantly became our first shared obsession. His room was filled with action figures from movies I loved: *Spider-Man 2*, *Blade, X-Men* (those classic ToyBiz ones), and some *Star Wars Attack of the Clones* figures. I had a similar collection, so we struck a deal—we’d trade a few of our figures for a couple of weeks at a time.

He was also an only child. Maybe that’s why we clicked so well. We just got each other. From that point on, we spent a ton of time together. Every other weekend, my dad would drop me off at Oscar’s place, and other weekends, he’d come and stay at ours.

At first, everything seemed really good. Once a month, M. would pick us up, and we’d all go together to an amusement park or the pool. "Together" meant me, Oscar, M., Diana, and Tess.

There was something odd back then that I couldn’t quite wrap my head around. Oscar called his parents by their first names—and they expected me to do the same. No “Mr.” or “Mrs.” stuff, which felt wrong given how my parents had raised me. Every time I slipped and said, “Mr., what do you think about...?” during our car trips, I’d get a stern correction to “say it the right way.” But I just couldn’t do it.

As for the women...

Diana was in her early 30s—a fit brunette, quiet, always in the background. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why, but she seemed almost... detached, like she was there but not really *present.*

Tess, though—she was something else. Younger than Diana, maybe mid-to-late 20s, with shoulder-length hair and a similar athletic build. But unlike Diana, she was lively, snarky, always ready with a quip or teasing comment. She’d chime into whatever me and Oscar were talking about, playful but sharp.

What stuck with me most was how M. barely acknowledged them. There was none of that natural give-and-take I saw between my parents—the way they argued, laughed, showed affection even when things were tough. With M., Diana, and Tess, there were no visible emotions. No warmth. No love. Just... *nothing really.*

Even as a kid, I could feel it.

You remember that scene in *The Irishman* when De Niro’s character and Pesci are traveling with their wives in the car? The ladies are in their own bubble, chatting and laughing, completely detached from the men’s conversations. That’s exactly what it felt like with M., Diana, and Tess. It wasn’t just an arrangement—it was a strange, almost transactional vibe that was too much for a kid to fully comprehend.

M. liked having me around his son. I know that because he told my dad multiple times how Oscar needed a “positive example” in his life. 

*“Your boy is a good influence,”* he’d say. *“Oscar could use more of that.”* 

And, honestly, I liked him too. He was always nice to me, never gave me any reason to feel unsafe. He had some “disciplinary” problems with Oscar, though. Looking back, I think M. genuinely believed that spending time with the “right crowd” could fix things. I didn’t fully understand what he meant at the time, but eventually, I did. About the „right crowd” too. 

I met some of the neighborhood kids Oscar occasionally hung out with. They were... different. A little loud, brash, and always up to something they shouldn’t be. Oscar REALLY tried to fit in with them, but it was clear he was just keeping up the appearance.

And then there was that one particular time. Things got a little scary. 

You see, when M. was out, it was usually Diana and Tess who looked after us—not that we needed much supervision. Most of the time, Oscar and I stayed in his room or wandered outside near the house to play. That day, the ladies were occupied with a bottle of wine, chatting and gossiping, barely paying attention to what we were up to.

Outside, a small group of Oscar’s friends was waiting for us—three boys and a girl, all about our age, maybe 10 or 11. They were buzzing with excitement about going uphill to this spot with a panoramic view of the city. It was a short walk, maybe 15 or 20 minutes from Oscar’s place.

The area had a strange allure. There was this massive high-voltage power line nearby, looming over an "island" surrounded by dense trees and patches of wild, overgrown grass. The forested area around it gave the place an eerie, secluded vibe.

We were just fooling around, laughing and shoving each other like kids do, when one of the boys grabbed an empty glass bottle and hurled it. The shattering sound echoed across the hillside.

Almost immediately, we heard angry voices—shouts, really. 

*"Little shits!"* one of them yelled. 

But it wasn’t just one person. It sounded like a group, maybe four or five people, and their voices carried a menace that made the air feel heavier.

From the edge of the forest, they emerged—older teens or maybe even young adults, the type you instinctively knew to avoid. Local thugs. Not the kind of crowd you wanted to bump into, especially not out here.

Oscar whispered, *"We better move"*

The others didn’t wait for a second invitation. They bolted downhill, leaving Oscar and me standing there alone. For a moment, we didn’t panic. We even cracked a few jokes about how dramatic the others were being. But then we glanced back and saw the group closing the distance between us.

At first, we thought they might just be heading to our spot. But no, they were coming straight for us.

*„Move..”* Oscar muttered.

Without saying another word, we started running. The tall grass became our ally, helping us stay out of sight as we zigzagged and stumbled downhill. 

The shouts behind us grew louder and angrier, but the thick underbrush slowed them down. When we rounded an old, crumbling brick wall, we knew we were close to Oscar’s house.

When we finally burst through the door, our clothes were covered in grass and leaves, and our shoes were caked with dirt. 

M. was in the living room, fresh from work, looking at us like we’d just come back from some swamp.

*"What the hell happened?"* he asked.

We shrugged, brushing it off. 

*“Nothing, really. Just got a little carried away playing outside,”* we lied.

M. eyes narrowed, but he didn’t press further. Instead, he muttered something about the girls not keeping an eye on us and asked, 

*"What were they doing? Why didn’t they notice you were gone?"*

We snickered. *“Busy gossiping. They wouldn’t care that much even if UFO took us ,”* we said, trying to lighten the mood.

Well, he didn’t laugh. His face turned stony, and he just told us to wash up because dinner was ready.

Later that evening, my dad came to pick me up. Despite the scare, it had been a fun weekend. At least, that’s what I thought.

The next time I visited Oscar’s place, something was different. 

Tess avoided looking me in the eye. She greeted me with a quick *"hi"* and then vanished into another room. When I finally got a good look at her, I froze.

Her face was bruised—badly. It looked like someone had hit her. Hard. Multiple times. 

Something had shifted and it wasn’t something good.
