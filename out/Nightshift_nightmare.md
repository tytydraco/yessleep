Hi all, i am currently writing this at 04:21 after just getting home from my nightshift early. This happened to me tonight and hopefully i’ll feel better after i write this out.

i have a day job where they offered night shift for a limited project. this ended but i realised i enjoyed the nightshift and started hotel work. just doing general admin and late check-ins. i normally am buddied up but today i was alone. i wasn’t scared because i’ve done this prior.

an hour into my nightshift there was a buzz on the intercom. this was weird because i had no one left to come in at the start of my shift. and all guests have keys to open the main door.

I answered, asking if she had keys. she replied no in a baby voice which instantly gave me shivers. i activated my sos button which we have at all times. she repeatedly asked me to come in to just chat to me. after i let her down gently she left. I still felt weird. about an hour later some regular guests came down for a smoke and i asked to join them and lightly explain why i hadn’t gone myself because of what happened earlier. i joined them outside quickly and decided to go back inside. when i did the men reentered describing the bald women i described sprinting for the doors. i notified my sos which lead them to calling the police. the police are very close to us. so i thought it would be delt with quick.

it turns out that although i thought she left she just camped where cameras couldn’t see. for the next hour i was back and forth with the police, ambulance and my managers. then it took a turn, she rang the intercom again. the police advised me to not answer. this lead her to taking a cup she found on a bar bench and smashing it at the glass doors. i fled to the safe area. and pleaded for the police to take me seriously. she had turned aggressive. As a tiny girl in her early 20s i was in pieces i won’t lie. this is because i knew something was wrong from the start even after mentioning it to my boyfriend who was on the phone during the intial meeting.

whilst on call to the authorities she was running towards the doors repeatedly. chanting and mumbling to herself. the police who were situated across the street still had no sign of coming. she would stand directly in front of my desk even though i was not in sight (due to lock down) she was still making eye contact with the camera. She then sat criss cross towards the glass doors playing with a metallic object in her hand.

this is when my mental breakdown turned into survival rage. i was on the phone to the general manager and the police. describing this sharp object that she was now trying to pry open the door with. the door slightly opened. which led me to question the police’s care about my safety . after both my manager and the operator told me to calm down and that the safe area would be secure if she got inside.  i  absolutely flipped explaining how of course they were calm since the operator was behind a desk at the station across me and how my manager was in bed. i had just finished university and got an internship. how compared to the 50 year old manager i was a fucking baby. my mums baby. and i that i was done with the excuses and downplays. by the end of my meltdown i heard sirens and my manager had sent another to come in. she was arrested due to the sharp object in-fact being a weapon. i honestly just got up and left. the police said there seems to be no reason for this episode. the managers and police tried to comfort me but the truth is that this all took place within hours of my initial sos.

please take this as a sign to trust your gut. i’m really shaken up and scared. please be safe. sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes
