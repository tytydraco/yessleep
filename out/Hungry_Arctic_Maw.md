The wind howled across the
desolate tundra, icy gusts
battering Ryan's face as he
stumbled through the snow.
His snowmobile had


sputtered out miles back,
leaving him alone with
nothing but the crackle of
static on his dead radio. The
vast expanse stretched
endlessly, white swallowing
the horizon, and dread set in
as he realized he wasn't truly
alone.


Behind him, he heard the
crunch of snow, deliberate
and slow. He turned, his
breath fogging up his
goggles, and saw it: a polar
bear, monstrous in size, its
black eyes locked onto him
like bottomless voids


Ryan ran.


He didn't hear it chase-he
felt it. The ground seemed to
quake as the beast closed
the distance in seconds. A
freight train of fur and
muscle collided with him,
sending him sprawling
face-first into the snow. He
screamed, but the roar of the wind and the bear's guttural snarl drowned him out


The first blow came like a
sledgehammer. A massive
paw raked across his back,
shredding his parka and the
flesh beneath. Pain erupted
as warm blood poured into
the freezing snow. Ryan
writhed, but the bear's
weight pinned him down. His screams became shrill as
claws hooked into his side
and flipped him onto his
back, exposing him to the
sky.


And then he saw its face-
massive jaws, teeth yellowed with remnants of past kills,
its breath a fetid mist of
decay.


The first bite wasn't where
he expected. Its teeth sank
into his abdomen, just below his ribs. The agony was so complete it silenced him for
a moment, the world reduce to the sound of tearing fabric and flesh. The bear pulled back, taking a chunk of his belly with it, exposing
glistening red and pink
viscera to the open air.


Ryan's screams returned,
primal and raw, He clawed at the snow, instinct driving
him to escape, but the bear
simply pressed a paw down
on his chest, pinning him as
it lowered its head again.


The crunch of teeth against
his ribs was deafening. The
bear bit down, breaching his
abdominal cavity. Ryan felt it inside him, a grotesque
tugging as its teeth closed
around his intestines.
pulled, and he felt them
unravel, a burning,
nauseating sensation as
loops of his entrails were
dragged out. The bear
chewed methodically,
unbothered by his screams,
savoring the meal.


Minutes passed, or maybe
hours. Time became
meaningless in the haze of
pain. Ryan's vision blurred,
and his body convulsed as
blood loss began to take
hold. The bear worked with
disturbing efficiency,
gnawing and tearing through his organs. It ate its way deeper, rooting through his body as if he were nothing more than a buffet.


Through the haze, Ryan felt
every bite, every wet slurp.
His lungs burned, his
heartbeat thundered in his
ears, and he prayed for death --but it didn't come. His mind clung to fragments of
lucidity, forcing him to
endure every second of the
bear's grotesque feast.


When it finally turned to his
legs, he was still alive. Too
weak to move, too broken to
scream, he felt the crushing
of his femur in its jaws as his body twitched involuntarily. The bear dragged his limp
form further into the snow,
perhaps intending to bury
the rest for later.


Ryan's last coherent thought
wasn't of the pain, or the
cold, or even the bear. It was
of the silence-the vast,
indifferent emptiness of the
Arctic--and how it swallowed his screams whole.
