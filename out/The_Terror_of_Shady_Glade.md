Have you ever noticed how every town has a story? Not a ghost. Not a monster. Just something quieter.
An abandoned house. A locked door in the school basement. A sound only kids can hear.

It never matters how normal a place looks. There’s always something just out of reach. Something off. People forget the details, but the story sticks.

When you grow up in a place like that, you hear all the stories.

The haunted bridge behind the hardware store. The tunnel where someone vanished. And the Morrow House. That one came up more than the others.

My mom said Shady Glade was a good place to start over.

There’s not much to do. Two stop lights, one gas station with two slushie machines, and a lot of corn. The kind of town where nothing ever happens until something does.

I didn’t fit in right away.

That all changed when I met Caleb.
He sat behind me in Social Studies and tapped his pencil nonstop. Everyone knew him, but no one was really close with him.

He was the kind of kid who always had something to say, and he noticed me fast. Through him, I met my other friends.

Bri was quiet and blunt, always wearing this huge hoodie like it was armor.

Then there were the brothers, Liam and Alex. Liam was tall, anxious, and talked way too fast when he got excited. Alex didn’t talk much at all. He carried around this little notebook where he wrote stuff like movie ideas, song lyrics, and lists of things that scared him.

The five of us ended up hanging out a lot that fall.
We weren’t exactly friends, but we didn’t have anywhere else to be.

We’d meet up after school in dried creek beds, empty lots, or abandoned parks. We’d talk about movies we liked, teachers we hated, and what we’d do once we got out of this town.

One afternoon, Caleb brought up the Morrow House.

We were sitting on an old picnic table in the park when he stood up and stretched.

“Have you ever seen that house past the fence by Briar Trail?” he asked.

Bri looked up. “You mean the one near the church?”
“Sort of. You have to cut through the woods. It’s half-sunk into the ground. Looks fake. Like it shouldn’t still be standing.”

“My cousin said a bunch of people died there,” Liam said.

Caleb nodded. “They did. But adults don’t talk about it. Like they know it’s there, but they don’t want to admit it. Some nights, just after sundown, the windows light up for a second. Then they go dark again.”

He paused and looked around.

“If you stare at it long enough, the walls look wrong. Like the whole thing is leaning. Or stretching.”

I didn’t believe him. But I wanted to.

“So, what’s it called again?” I asked.

“The Morrow House. Used to belong to some couple, Mr. and Mrs. Morrow. But that’s not the weird part.”

He leaned in a little closer.

“Last year, a group of teenagers went inside. They were missing for almost two weeks. Then, one night, two of them—Luke and Amy—staggered out into the yard. Covered in blood.”

Alex stopped writing. “What did the cops say?”

“They couldn’t. Luke and Amy were both sick. They couldn’t explain what happened. Just kept mumbling and shaking. Nobody got a straight answer.”

“Sounds fake,” Liam muttered.

“No, it’s real,” Bri said. “They still go to our school. Or they did. Amy dropped out. Luke never came back.”

“Why didn’t anyone tell me this?” I asked.

“Because people here avoid it. They think Luke snapped. That he killed the others. But when the cops searched the house, it was already on fire. Burned to the ground. And when they went through the rubble, they found nothing. No bones. No bodies. Just ash.”

I asked Caleb to tell me more, but he was already grabbing his bike.

“Can’t. My mom’s gonna be pissed if I’m late.”

“Mine too,” Bri added, following him. The group split up after that, but the story stayed with me.

Then, a few weeks later, something happened.

I woke up to sirens screaming past my house. Red and blue lights flashed across my bedroom ceiling. When I looked out the window, I counted six police cars speeding toward the west side of town.

That morning, the news got around.

There had been a party. A senior threw it. Amy had shown up, probably trying to prove she was okay. She went upstairs with her new boyfriend, Jack.

Around midnight, Lucas showed up. He didn’t talk to anyone. Just walked in and asked where Amy was.
He went upstairs, opened the door, and shot her.
 Then he turned the gun on himself.

Jack was found frozen in the corner, covered in blood and brain matter. Couldn’t move. Couldn’t talk.

When the cops questioned him later, he said Lucas had been muttering something. No one else could make it out, but Jack remembered one thing he said, right before he pulled the trigger:

“You’re already dead. I just have to make sure it doesn’t get out alive.”

After that, everything changed, but no one talked about it.

No memorial. No questions. It was like the whole town decided to forget.

Three years passed. Nothing was ever said.
Now we’re seniors.

Yesterday, I was driving home. I passed the lot where the Morrow House used to be.

Except it was there again.

Fresh paint. Clean windows. Lights on inside. A porch swing creaking slowly in the wind. Like it had never burned. Like it had never been gone.

When I asked my parents about it at dinner, they looked at me like I was confused.

“What are you talking about?” my mom said. “That house was torn down three years ago.”
