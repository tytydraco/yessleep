They're lying about why they stopped drilling. I'm sure you all have heard the story of how we recorded the "sounds of hell" in that borehole.

That story is bullshit. What happened was *much* worse.

I was a junior geologist on the Kola project in 1992, fresh out of university and stupid enough to think I was lucky. The deepest hole ever drilled into the Earth, 12,262 meters straight down into the Scandinavian Shield. They told us we were making history. They didn't tell us what we were making history *with*.

The problems started at 12,000 meters.

Dr. Azarov was running the night shift when the drill head brought up the first sample of rock from down there. I wasn't there, but I saw the footage later, before they destroyed it. The core rock sample was ordinary granite, but when Azarov set it on the examination table, it was warm. Not hot. Body temperature.

"It's residual heat from friction," the engineers said. But granite from that depth had never come up warm before. The temperature down there was 180°C, sure, but the samples always cooled during the hour-long ascent.

This one hadn't.

Three days later, I was in the drilling room when we heard it.

The microphones, we'd lowered them to record the sounds of tectonic stress, the groaning of continental plates. Standard procedure. At 12,200 meters, we started picking up something else. It came through the speakers at 3:47 AM.

Scratching.

Not the grind of rock on metal. Not the creak of steel under pressure. Scratching. Rhythmic. Deliberate. Like fingernails on stone.

"Equipment malfunction," Director Volkov announced, but his face had gone gray. "We're pulling the microphones up."

They didn't make it back up.

At 8,000 meters, the cable went taut. Then it started descending again, pulled from below. We watched the counter tick downward, 8,100 meters, 8,200 meters, before the cable snapped. Whatever took it was strong enough to break braided steel rated for five tons.

We should have stopped then.

Instead, Volkov ordered us to keep drilling. "Equipment gets stuck. We've lost tools before." But I heard him on the phone with Moscow that night, his voice high and terrified: "It's not geological. It's not—I don't know what it is, but we need to seal it NOW."

Moscow told him to keep going.

At 12,250 meters, the drill bit jammed. Not stuck—jammed, like something was holding it. The engineers tried to free it for six hours, the motor screaming, until finally it lurched free so violently it nearly tore the derrick down.

When they pulled it up, there were marks on it.

Not damage from rock. Marks. Long, parallel grooves scored deep into tungsten carbide, each one curved slightly, like...

"Tool wear," Volkov said, but his hands were shaking so badly he dropped the sample. None of us touched it after that.

That night, Dmitri disappeared.

He'd been working the drilling floor, monitoring the equipment. When his shift ended at midnight, he didn't come up. We found his coat at his station, his thermos still warm. We searched for eight hours.

We found him in the drill shaft.

Not at the bottom. Not fallen in. He was *on the wall*, 200 meters down, pressed against the stone like he was trying to climb deeper. His fingers were bloody stumps, nails torn off from clawing at granite. His eyes were open.

The medical examiner said he'd been dead for four hours, but when we found him, his blood was still wet. And his mouth—his mouth was full of stone dust, like he'd been trying to eat his way through the rock.

The last thing I'll say about Dmitri: when we pulled him up, there was something written on the wall where he'd been. Scratched in his own blood, in letters three feet tall:

**THEY HEARD**

Volkov ordered the borehole sealed that morning. Not filled, sealed. They brought in specialists from Moscow, men who wouldn't look us in the eye and wouldn't answer questions. They welded a steel plate over the shaft opening, then poured concrete, then added another plate.

But first, they lowered one more microphone.

I wasn't supposed to be there, but I hid in the equipment room and listened. They sent it down on a self-powered winch, recording the whole way.

For the first 11,000 meters: nothing. Silence.

At 12,000 meters, the scratching started. Closer now. Louder. Not just one source—hundreds. Thousands. A symphony of scraping, clawing, dragging sounds that made my teeth ache.

At 12,200 meters, the scratching stopped.

Then we heard breathing.

Not one breath. A chorus of inhalations, all perfectly synchronized, drawing air through the microphone. The sound was wet, ragged, excited.

Then the laughter started.

I've never heard anything like it. Thousands of voices laughing in perfect unison, a sound so loud it distorted the speakers. But it wasn't joy. It was the laughter of something that had been waiting in the dark for so long it had forgotten what light was, and now, finally, *finally* it could come up.

The laughter rose in pitch, became shrieking, gleeful, hungry.

Then something grabbed the microphone.

We heard it pulled downward at tremendous speed, the cable screaming, and behind it all that laughter growing louder, closer, echoing up the shaft. As if whatever was down there was *screaming* in ecstasy. The sound changed as it climbed. The laughter turned into *counting* in Russian, each number shouted in that same unified chorus, the voice cracking with excitement:

"**TWELVE THOUSAND!**"

A pause. A scraping sound like countless hands finding purchase on stone.

"**ELEVEN THOUSAND!**"

More scraping. Faster now. Something was using the walls, the equipment, the cables we'd left behind—climbing with impossible speed.

"**TEN THOUSAND!**"

The numbers came faster. The laughter between each one was deafening, ecstatic.

"**NINE THOUSAND! EIGHT THOUSAND! SEVEN THOUSAND!**"

Volkov was screaming into his radio, telling Moscow what was happening, but even through the phone I could hear someone in the Moscow office say "Jesus Christ, we can hear it here too..."

"**SIX THOUSAND! FIVE THOUSAND!**"

The drilling platform was shaking now. Dust falling from the ceiling. That counting, that horrible counting, echoing up from below and somehow also coming from the walls, from the ground, from everywhere.

"**FOUR THOUSAND! THREE THOUSAND!**"

The winch exploded. The cable shot up from the borehole with such force it embedded in the ceiling, and for just a second before they killed the feed, the microphone was still transmitting.

Not from 12,000 meters down anymore.

It was at 200 meters.

And it was still counting, still laughing, and the worst part, the absolute worst part, was that the counting had changed. It wasn't counting the depth anymore.

It was counting *us*.

"**FORTY-THREE! FORTY-TWO! FORTY-ONE!**"

Forty-three people in the facility.

Whatever was down there had already counted every single one of us.

They sealed the hole in four minutes. I've never seen people work so fast. The steel plate went on, then the concrete, then another plate welded on top, all while that counting echoed up from below, getting louder, the numbers dropping:

"**TWELVE! ELEVEN! TEN!**"

Something hit the underside of the steel plate. The entire platform jumped. Then another impact. Another. The plate was buckling inward with each hit, and between the impacts we could hear that laughter, that hideous gleeful laughter, and the counting:

"**FIVE! FOUR! THREE!**"

The final weld sealed. The laughter stopped.

For five seconds, there was perfect silence.

Then something scraped across the bottom of the steel plate. Slowly. Deliberately. Three parallel lines, like fingers testing the seal.

And from below, muffled but clear, we heard a single word in perfect Russian:

"**Soon.**"

It stopped when the final weld cooled.

The official story is that the borehole was closed due to budget constraints and high temperatures. The facility was abandoned. Most of the records were destroyed. The few of us who remain were offered very generous pensions with very specific NDAs.

But here's what they didn't tell you:

Three weeks after we sealed it, a construction crew drilling a water well in the village of Zapolyarny—forty kilometers away—hit something at 400 meters. The drill dropped into a void. When they pulled it up, there were those same curved marks on the bit.

When they lowered a camera down, they saw something in the darkness. Something with too many arms, moving toward the lens.

They sealed that hole too. And the one that opened in Nikel. And another near Murmansk.

Last month, my daughter called me from Moscow. Her apartment building is being evacuated. There's a crack in the foundation that opened overnight. It goes down at least fifty meters, they think. Maybe deeper.

She said she can hear scratching from below.

They're not isolated anymore. The holes are spreading, opening up like pores across the Kola Peninsula. We dug down and *woke something up*, and now it's not climbing up through one shaft anymore.

It's making its own.

Three days ago, I felt the floor vibrate in my apartment in St. Petersburg, 1,400 kilometers from Kola. This morning, there's a crack in my basement floor. It's only a centimeter wide, but when I put my ear to it, I can hear something.

It sounds like digging.

Getting closer.

I called Volkov to ask what we should do. He didn't answer. When I drove to his house, the front door was open. There was a hole in his kitchen floor, perfectly round, going straight down into darkness. On the wall, written in something dark and wet:

**WE HEARD YOU TOO**

I'm writing this from my car. I don't think I can outrun it—I don't think anyone can—but I need someone to know the truth before the holes open up under cities, under schools, under your house while you sleep.

We didn't stop drilling the Kola Borehole because of budget cuts or heat.

We stopped because we realized the drilling sound we'd been making for twelve years?

It was knocking.

And something finally answered the door.

If you're reading this and you feel your floor vibrate, if you hear scratching under your home, if you see a crack that wasn't there yesterday...

Run.

But I don't think running will help anymore.

They heard us. All of us. Every footstep, every foundation, every mine and tunnel and basement and subway.

And now they're coming up.

The crack in my basement is three meters wide now.

Last night, I heard laughter coming from it.

The same laughter from the microphone, thirty years ago.

And then, very clearly, I heard counting.

Starting at forty-three.

Counting down.
