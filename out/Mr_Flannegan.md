I woke up to the sunlight tickling my face and the soft chirping of birds muffled by my window. I looked to my side and my wife Cheryl was still fast asleep. Her dirty blonde hair covering her eyes and nose like a messy barricade. Even so, she still was breath taking in her most vulnerable and unprepared state. I slowly moved my feet over the side of my bed as mechanically as possible trying not to wake my wife. As soon as I realize the stealth mission was a success, I stood up and tip toed through the bedroom door and into the hall. 

I went straight to the kitchen with a pep in my step. I was going to make my lovely bride breakfast in bed. Im not a graceful person at all so when I tell you it sounded like war of the pots in the kitchen im not lying. After every loud clang I’d pause for a few minutes and wait to see if she’d call out to me but she never did. 

“I never understood how you slept so hard it’s almost noon” I said with a smile on my face. After about 45 minutes of intense cheffing I triumphantly plated her bacon eggs and pancakes, grabbed the cup of OJ and headed to the bedroom. 

“Good morning beautiful. Look who’s finally awa-“ I paused mid sentence because Cheryl looked like she was about to blow chunks.

“Are you okay baby?” I said my voice raising slightly with concern.

“I feel so nauseous this morning I don’t know what’s happening. What’s that awful smell?!” She said pinching her nose with her fingers. I looked at her confused.

“I don’t smell anything baby. Are you okay?” I walked slowly and intently towards the bed plate and drink still occupying my hands. As soon as I sat down on the bed she let loose. It’s like a pressure was connected to her stomach. I shot up to my feet barely containing vomit of my own. I quickly got dressed and rushed my wife to the car leaving the forgotten breakfast on our bedside table. 

I practically had to carry her inside the ER. My heart was racing and my mind was flooded. Was my wife going to die? I pushed the thought out of my mind and gently sat her down in the waiting chair. Thankfully it was fairly empty and there was no crowd or line at the check in desk. 

“What seems to be the issue?” An older woman said in a monotone voice.

“My wife woke up this morning and threw up like the exorcist. She was perfectly normal yesterday. Do you think she’s poisoned?” herself expression changed from annoyed to extremely concerned.

“Hi this is Janice I need a nurse in the waiting room immediately please.” She said on her desk phone. I waited about 5 minutes before 2 nurses in smocks came down the hallway.  On came to talk to us and the other to the lady at the desk. I told the nurse  the same thing I told the old woman. After a quick brief the nurse talking to me turned around and waved the other one over. 

“Does she need help walking or do you think you’ll be enough for her?” The nurse asked in a sweet voice. 

“I think I’ll be fine to give her a hand. Do you know what’s going on?” I asked desperately.

“We think we have a good idea but we need you to come with us to make sure.” I helped my wife to her feet and we followed the nurses down the cold shiny hallways of the hospital. Finally we reached a door and we followed the nurses inside. In the corner of the room was a big machine hooked up to a screen and next to it a hospital bed. 

“Do you need help laying down mam?” One of the nurses said. 

“No I think I’ll be fine. I might need a bucket just in case though”. Her attempt at humor was cut short by the obvious wave of nausea that shot through her body. 

“We are gonna be using an ultrasound machine today to see if there are any abnormalities in your tummy” the nurse by the machine said. My mind was racing. Abnormalities? What could that even mean? All the horrible scenarios floated through my brain. I watched as the nurses helped lift my wife’s shirt so her stomach was showing. One stood by her side while the other started turning on the machine and putting on gloves. I watched her apply the gel and I did the stupidest thing ever. I closed my eyes. After what seemed like an eternity of painful silence and occasional chatter from the halls on of the nurses said-

“Just as we thought. Mam you’re pregnant! Congratulations to you both!” 

My eyes shot open and met my wife’s. I could see nothing but joy as her beautiful green eyes started to get teary. 

“NO FUCKING WAY” I shouted quickly shoving both hands over my mouth. We had been trying so long and it finnally happened. We were gonna have a kid. I left the hospital with my wife on my arm the sickness seemingly exorcised from her body. We blared the radio all ride home talking about names and what school our kid was gonna go too. Life was perfect. Then the voice started.  


“Mr. Flannegan?”  


  


I turned to my wife and asked her if she heard anything. She declined and asked if I was okay. I nodded my head with a smile and turned back to the road. I heard a voice. Im not crazy. 

When we got home my wife said she was in desperate need for a shower. I completely understood considering she was a pukecano less than 3 hours ago. She headed straight for the bathroom and I heard the water turn on. I sat on the couch and turned on the TV. All I could think about was how good of parents me and Cheryl would be. We were gonna raise the shit out of this kid.   


  


“Mr Flannegan?”   


  


My head shot around to both sides of me. I paused the tv and waited. And waited. And waited. 

“I must’ve ate some mushrooms or some shit” I laughed nervously to myself as if that was some sort of explanation. I pressed play on my remote and sank back into the couch. Relaxation quickly took over my body and I felt my eyes start to get heavy. I don’t even remember falling asleep. But I remember what woke me up.



“Mr Flannegan?”   


  


My eyes shit open as fear gripped my body. I realized the same movie I had fallen asleep too was still on. I paused the tv and heard that the shower was still running. I stormed to the bathroom mildly annoyed thinking my wife had gotten extra playful.

“Who’s Mr Flannegan?” I said leaned up against the bathroom door. I saw the shower door slide open and my wife’s head peak out. 

“Mr Flannegan?” She said obviously confused. But as soon as she said that I realized it wasn’t her voice that’s been speaking to me. Annoyance quickly turned to anxiousness and I guess my wife saw it in my face. 

“What’s wrong honey?” She asked concerned.

“It’s nothing babe I fell asleep for a sec on the couch I think I started to have a bad dream” I could almost taste the uncertainty in my words. She gave a little shrug and went back to her shower. I slowly and methodically made my way through the house. Our bedroom was fairly normal except for the slightly messy closet. I found nothing strange in the spare room and again nothing in the hall bathroom. I made my way to the living room and then the kitchen. Relief crept into my body but it was quickly replaced by paranoia. I heard a voice I now it. 

The night continued as usual. We ordered Thai food delivery and watched our favorite movie, John Carpenters-The Thing. When the credits started rolling I looked over and realized she had fallen asleep. I admired her beauty before waking her up and helping her to bed. We both laid down and got snuggled up her face pressed into my neck, my chin resting in the top of her head. 

“Your gonna be an amazing dad” she said softly. I smiled and kissed her forehead. 

“And you’ll be and even more amazinger mom.” I squeezed her tight then relaxed my body and fell asleep.   


   


“Mr Flannegan”   


  


I woke up in cold sweat. Glimpses of a dream floated through my head. I rolled over and checked my clock- 4:18 am. I groaned softly and rolled over to see my wife was gone. Confused I got out of bed. My feet started moving on there own like I was in autopilot mode. I went straight to the guest room and looked inside. I noticed nothing out of the ordinary at first but as I turned around to leave something in my head clicked. I turned back around when I saw I pill bottle sitting on my bed. All the words were blotted out like the label had gotten wet. The only thing legible was the owners name- Daniel Flannegan.  


  


“Mr Flannegan?”  


  


I shot bolt upright in my bed soaked in sweat yet again. Cheryl was shaking me and saying my name. I looked at her like I was a lost puppy.

“Babe you were twitching and talking in your sleep I think you were having a bad dream.” My brain cleared up immediately when I remembered that pill bottle. I rushed to the guest room and shoved the door open. No pill bottle. No Mr Flannegan. It was just a dream. 

“Paul whats going on?” fear dripping from my wife’s voice. She’d been on my heels when she saw me bolt out of bed and down the hall. 

“It was just a nightmare I think. It felt so real.”

She took me by the hand and led me to the bedroom where she laid me down and kissed my cheek. 

“Im gonna get you some breakfast okay? You sit here and relax my love.” All I could think in that moment was-

“God I love my wife”  


Weeks passed and no Mr Flannegan. No lucid dreams. We had just laid down to bed and gotten comfortable for the night. My wife was already out cold her body being so exhausted from growing another human inside her. I closed my eyes and thought of Cheryl and our unborn baby as I drifted off to dream world. 

I woke up feeling calm and collected, something very unusual for me. I turned to look at the bedside clock and it read- 4:18. I turned to look at my wife but the bed was empty. Just like the other dream I got out of bed and went straight to the guest room. This time there were noticeable differences. The bed frame was now metal and the bedding itself was sparse. A single pillow and a single white top sheet. On the desk was the pill bottle with Daniel Flannegans name on it.   


I woke up not quite scared, but as if something was about to get found out. Like some secret was about to get spilled. I turned to my wife, the soft sunlight kissing her sleeping face. I rolled over and checked the clock. 

“Babe your appointment! We’re gonna be late!” 

Cheryl shot up on high alert like I’d just activated her using a code word. We scrambled to get ready practically tripping over each other.  We rushed to the ultra sound appointment making it by the skin of our teeth. The results made up for the hectic morning though. We were gonna have a little girl. That’s all we could talk about on the drive home. I’ll never forget the weather. The sun was radiant and the warm like the planet was happy for me. The wildlife exploding in a crescendo of peace and harmony. The sky was crystal clear. A perfect day for perfect news.   


  


“Mr Flannegan?”  


  


I screamed and in response so did my wife. I looked over at her in horror as she matched my expression. After a few seconds her eyes left mine and met the road her expression growing more erratic. 

“Paul watch the fucking road!” My wife screamed clutching her seat belt. I tore my eyes off her in back onto the road. But it was too late. Then there was just darkness. I sat there in the empty space of my consciousness when I realized it didn’t sound like your typical car crash. There was no scream. No glass breaking. It sounded more like a heavy door being slammed.   


  


“Mr Flannegan?”   


  


I opened my eyes. Pale bright light stung my eyes and made my vision blurry. I struggled consumed by fear but it was to no use. I looked down and realized I was in a straight jacket chained to a chair. I looked to my left and saw that same small neat metal bed. When I looked to my right I saw the same pill bottle except dozens and dozens of them. 

“Mr Flannegan?” My eyes bolted to the source of the voice. A middle aged woman that looked exactly like my Cheryl sat across from me. 

“Who the fuck is Mr. Flannegan? Where is my wife where the fuck am I?” I shouted angrily at the mysterious woman. She looked at me with understanding, almost like this has happened before and said,

“You know why you’re here Daniel. You know what you did.”

“What I did? What the fuck did I do?!” I said thrashing against my maiming restraints. 

“Look at me Daniel. You murdered your wife and unborn child 20 years ago. April 18 1981. You were sent here for evaluation and have remained here ever since.” I stared at her through cold unwavering eyes as the memories started flooding back in.   


“Mr Flannegan? Are you ready for you medication now?”
