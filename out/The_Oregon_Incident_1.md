# Mark Wilson - Personal Introduction

*March 12, 2025*

I've never been one for keeping journals, but Dana insists it's good for "mental processing" or whatever psych term she picked up at that last law enforcement wellness seminar. After fifteen years on the force and eight years as sheriff of Silver Creek, I've seen my share of strange things, but nothing that needed "processing" beyond a cold beer and some quiet fishing time. But I promised her I'd try, so here we go.

Name's Mark Wilson, 43, Sheriff of Silver Creek, population 4,892 as of last census. Been married to Dana for twelve years now, working together for ten. Some folks think it's weird having your wife as your deputy, but we've always worked well together. She sees things I miss. I keep her grounded when she gets too wrapped up in details. It works.

Silver Creek sits nestled against the Cascade foothills, surrounded by dense forest and logging operations. Typical small-town Oregon – everybody knows everybody, crime is mostly DUIs, domestic disputes, and the occasional bear getting into someone's trash. At least that's how it was until yesterday.

# Dana Wilson - Personal Introduction

*March 12, 2025*

First entry in our matched journals! Mark will probably write two sentences and consider his therapeutic duties fulfilled, but I've always found writing helps organize my thoughts. Deputy Sheriff Dana Wilson, 40, formerly Detective Dana Chen from Portland PD. Met Mark when I came to investigate a case that crossed jurisdictions. Fell in love with both the man and the mountains.

Silver Creek has been a welcome change from city policing. Don't get me wrong – we have our issues, but they're manageable. The community respects the badge, and we respect them. Our department is small – just Mark, me, two full-time deputies (Jim Haley and Ronan Alvarez), and Dispatch Doris who's been here longer than any of us.

I never thought I'd say this, but I actually prefer the predictability. After what I saw in Portland... well, let's just say some cases stay with you. Here in Silver Creek, I can usually sleep at night.

Or at least, I could until what happened today.

# Mark Wilson - Day 1

*March 13, 2025*

Call came in at 5:47 AM. Logger named Pete Simmons reporting "something wrong" at the Henderson camp about 8 miles into the national forest. Pete was agitated, not making much sense. Kept saying "they're all gone" and "there's blood everywhere." Dana and I headed out while radioing for backup from county.

Arrived at 6:35 AM. Fourteen-man logging crew. Twelve dead, two missing. Never seen anything like it.

The camp was... Christ, I don't even know how to describe it. Bodies torn apart. Not like an animal attack – I've seen bear and cougar maulings. This was different. Methodical. Some looked partially... eaten. Equipment destroyed, vehicles disabled. Radio smashed. Pete only got out because he'd been sleeping in his truck a quarter-mile away after arguing with the foreman.

County forensics team arrived at 7:20. We secured the scene and began documenting. Dana handled Pete's statement while I coordinated with County Sheriff and Fish & Wildlife. They're sending a specialist. Good. Because whatever did this wasn't a normal predator.

Pete kept repeating something about "clicking sounds" in the trees the night before. Said the foreman, Bill Henderson, had complained about "feeling watched" for the past week.

We've got search teams looking for the missing men, but I told them not to go out alone. Not until we know what we're dealing with.

It's now 11 PM. Just got home. Dana's still processing. I can hear her pacing in the kitchen. I should join her, but I needed a minute alone first.

I've been sheriff for eight years. Seen three murders, two fatal car accidents, even a small plane crash. Nothing prepared me for today.

Whatever did this... it was smart. The way it disabled communications first. The way it completely surrounded the camp. Even the partial tracks we found didn't make sense – some looked almost human but wrong somehow.

Dana thinks we should call the FBI. I think she's right.

I can barely hold my pen steady. What we saw today defies explanation.

The Henderson logging camp was a massacre scene. Not random violence – this was coordinated. Several victims showed defensive wounds – they fought back. But whatever attacked them was strong enough to tear through muscle and bone with terrifying ease.

I documented everything meticulously – it's how I cope. But the details are haunting me. The body positioning suggested they were hunted. Some tried to hide in their tents or under vehicles. They were dragged out. Systematically.

Most disturbing was what we found in the foreman's trailer. Bill Henderson had been keeping a log of strange occurrences around the camp:

* March 5: "Something keeps triggering the motion lights at night. Security cameras show nothing."
* March 8: "Men reporting weird clicking/chittering sounds in the forest. Thought it was equipment at first."
* March 10: "Found strange marks on trees surrounding camp. Not any animal I recognize."
* March 12 (yesterday): "Third night of missing food supplies. Installing locks tomorrow. Men on edge."

His final entry, timestamped 11:42 PM last night: "They're watching us from the tree line. I can see reflections but not shapes. More than one. Moving too fast. Calling ranger station in morning."

He never got the chance.

The two missing men are Luis Ramirez and Kevin Park. Search teams found nothing before dark forced them back. We've got thermal imaging equipment coming tomorrow from Eugene.

Mark called the FBI, but they seemed skeptical. Asked if we were sure it wasn't a bear. A bear! Nothing about this is consistent with wildlife. The strategic disabling of vehicles and communications suggests intelligence.

Mark's putting on a brave face, but I know him. He's rattled. So am I.

It's midnight now. Can't sleep. Keep thinking about Pete's statement – how he described hearing "wet tearing sounds" and "something that sounded like laughter but wasn't human."

What are we dealing with here?

# Mark Wilson - Day 2

*March 14, 2025*

5:30 AM – Three more disappearances reported overnight. Family of hikers – the Crawfords – didn't return to their rental cabin. Their vehicle found at Blackwater trailhead, about 6 miles from yesterday's incident. Same pattern – tires slashed, radio disabled, supplies scattered.

7:15 AM – Met with County Sheriff Richards and State Police Captain Welch to coordinate search efforts. They're taking this seriously now. Search grid established, teams of four minimum, all armed.

9:20 AM – Fish & Wildlife specialist Dr. Eliza Tanner arrived. She examined the tracks we found and seemed troubled. Said they resembled primate tracks but "significantly larger and with unusual digit spacing." When I mentioned Pete's account of clicking sounds, her face went pale.

10:45 AM – Found one of our missing loggers, Kevin Park. He was alive – barely. Severe lacerations, hypothermia, shock. Before medivac arrived, he grabbed my arm and said something that chilled me: "They're smart. They learn. They took our guns first."

2:30 PM – FBI finally showed up. Two agents, Morris and Chen. Took one look at the evidence and immediately called in more resources. They're establishing a command center at the high school gym.

4:15 PM – Second attack. Hunting cabin 12 miles from town. Two dead, one missing. Same pattern but with a new element – crude traps set up on the access road. Dana says they're similar to military-style booby traps. Where would animals learn that?

7:30 PM – Community meeting at the town hall. Place was packed. Tried to keep people calm while being honest about the danger. Implementing curfew and buddy system. Advised everyone to stay in town if possible.

9:45 PM – Dr. Tanner pulled Dana and me aside after the meeting. Said she has a theory but needed more evidence. Mentioned something about "adaptive predator behavior" and "possible pack intelligence." She's staying at the Silver Creek Inn. Meeting her first thing tomorrow.

11:20 PM – Just got a call. Kevin Park died at the hospital. Before he went, he told the FBI something about the creatures' appearances. The agents wouldn't share details, but I overheard "exoskeletal features" and "abnormal cranial structure."

Whatever's out there, it isn't anything we've documented before. And it's getting closer to town.

# Dana Wilson - Day 2

*March 14, 2025*

Today confirmed my worst fears – we're dealing with multiple intelligent predators.

The evidence is mounting. The attacks show learning patterns. The first attack disabled communications. The second targeted weapons first. The third incorporated traps. They're adapting to our tactics.

I spent two hours with Dr. Tanner reviewing evidence. Her background isn't just wildlife biology – she also studied abnormal evolutionary patterns. She's seen reports of similar attacks in remote areas of the Pacific Northwest dating back decades, but nothing this coordinated.

The tracks tell a disturbing story. I measured and photographed over thirty distinct prints – suggesting at least 8-10 individuals based on size variations. They move in formation. They use the trees. And most alarmingly, some of the prints show clear evidence of opposable digits.

The FBI brought in specialized equipment – thermal and infrared cameras, audio detection systems, even experimental pheromone traps. One agent let slip they've been tracking similar incidents in Northern California and Southern Washington. This isn't isolated.

Mark is holding up well publicly, maintaining order, but I see the strain. He barely touched dinner. Keeps checking the windows.

The town is scared. Hardware stores sold out of ammunition today. People are boarding windows. Some families have already left for Portland or Seattle.

Most disturbing development: analysis of bite marks on the victims shows evidence of what Dr. Tanner called "tool-assisted predation." Meaning they're using implements to help feed. The implications are staggering.

Tomorrow we're establishing a secure perimeter around Silver Creek. National Guard has been requested but is at least 48 hours out.

I've loaded every weapon we own and placed them strategically around the house. Mark thinks I'm being paranoid, but then I caught him checking the locks for the third time tonight.

Something keeps nagging at me about the pattern of these attacks. They're moving systematically toward town, yes, but also... it's almost like they're herding us. Limiting escape routes. Testing our responses.

I fear we're already playing their game, not ours.
