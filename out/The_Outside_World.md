**\*TW\* Murder, Descriptive Gore**  


I ensure they are alone in this world before I move. Usually, I go for the rejects or the people whose families have either left this world or abandoned them. Research is a fundamental part of this. You miss one little thing, and your face is plastered on television screens across the globe, and a manhunt ensues. Going outside into the world is no longer an option. You can't go shopping, can't see your friends, can't go to work. Then what? I can't just pack up and leave. There is no better place to do it. It has to be done here or else it's not done right. I’ve been doing it for over 10 years now. Time flies. 64 corpses line my path, all at the hands of little old me. The process is very simple. I take note of the souls I see aboard the train during my commute to and from work. I note their appearance, their body language, and their emotional state. Sometimes I follow them home if a lead is promising, and I take note of where they rest their heads at dusk. It's a game of patience. Everything needs to be perfect or else the facade is broken, swept away for eternity.  
  
It's a late night. These souls are trapped in a subway car with the devil himself, but they don't know it. A pretty blond sits ahead of me, staring down at her phone, unaware of the danger she is in. She is lucky; she is distracted by something on her screen. I see her typing in increments like someone who cares is conversing with her. They would be destroyed to find out she is missing, horrified at the sight of her head in a plastic bag on the 6 o'clock news. Another soul sits to the blond's right. An elderly lady. Kids and grandkids could be in play, no good. The last soul, however, is promising. A young lady, her hair tied messily into a bun. She looks sad. Her hand is carefully placed on her cheek, scrunched into a fist as she watches the raindrops fall from the clouds above. Her eyes had large dark bags under them, and they were bloodshot. Her cheeks were rosy along with her nose. Now this is something.  
  
She picked up her purse and wrapped it around her as the subway car began to slow down. It's time to make my move. I closed my notepad, the pages filled with chilling accounts of all the past souls that encountered my wrath. She got up and swiftly exited into the night. I followed closely. She made a left, then a right, walked straight for a while, and finally entered a small home on the corner in a quiet suburb. The house was in bad condition. Peeling paint, overgrown garden, boards on the windows. I took note of her address and walked back to the subway to start the process again. The countdown begins. Within a week her existence will cease. I get home late as per usual. Only one promising candidate tonight. I type in her address on white pages; I get her name and number. Then I search on social media. No accounts were found, and no one to socialize with. Alone in this world, practically waiting in the open for me to do my thing.  
  
No known relatives. Now my senses are heightened. Everything is perfect. My research is complete. There is only one question that remains: how do I pull it off? Unlike other killers, I change my methods depending on the scenario. Sometimes I inject them with a sedative; sometimes I poison them and wait for them to get ill; sometimes it gets “messy.” I also need to find out how to connect with them, to get close to them so I can strike without setting off alarms in their heads. My charming appearance should help. I will knock on the door, playing the role of an electrician, or maybe a plumber. I’ll use a soft, alluring voice so she will let her guard down. Once in the house, I'll do the deed. A needle into the spine, releasing the agent to make her drop. Then I take out my steel and release her from the bloody cage she is trapped in. I’ll separate her into 10 small pieces and wrap her up. Drop her off somewhere in the woods at night. Piece by piece.  
  
Tonight’s the night. One of my favorite shows. Dexter reminds me of myself. Maybe that's why I connect with him so much. I open my closet and grab my kit. A book bag containing all the tools I'll need to perform my sacred act, which I have come to love so much. Then I pick an outfit like a child playing dress-up. I sway my hand around the different choices. Plumber, cop, garbage man, electrician, city worker. My second favorite part of the process is picking my outfit; I'll let you guess what the first is. I select a city worker. Maybe a conversation about the state of her house; I’ll offer to check out the backyard for a “routine inspection.” When she turns her back, I strike. I approach the door and take a deep breath. My body sways and my hands twitch due to the raw excitement I am feeling. It's the only emotion I can truly feel. I knock in a charming pattern, a little jingle, the last one they will hear.  
  
She opens the door, and a smile fills my face. I couldn't hold back anymore. The excitement got to me. “Hello ma’am, sorry to bother you, but we’ve had a few complaints about the overall state of your property. I've been sent by the city to investigate,” I say flawlessly. I watch her loosen up. She becomes less tense as she leans against the frame of the door. “Oh, um, sorry about that,” she said. I could hear the embarrassment tickle in her throat. She breaks eye contact and looks at the floor. “Well, I need to take a few photographs of your property so the city can determine if your property is unsafe. May I come in?” I'm starting to become impatient. I am itching to do my dirty deed. My hands tremble once again, and my breath quivers. I need to do it now. “Oh, yeah, sure… come in,” she said awkwardly. All my senses are now aroused. I grip the needle in my pack as I step into the house. The door shuts. The outside world is now blind. The outside world doesn't deserve to see what is about to happen. I can't keep it in anymore. I plunge the needle into her back through her top, letting out a grunt of pent-up thrill. Her legs crumble as she falls unconscious. Her nose bounces off the floor, and all goes silent.  
  
I look down at her and stare for a moment; she begins to snore. The smile on my face is so sharp it could cut a diamond. I let out a giggle at this sight. This is happening. That feeling never goes away. Time and time after I do it. It feels like the first time every time. I stare for a few more moments, taking in the zen of the moment. The silence is deafening. Without breaking eye contact with the body, I grab my blade out of my bag, gripping it with immense pressure. I bend down slowly, my hand raised high, ready to strike. My heart begins to race, my body begins to shake, and I practically begin to hyperventilate. I take a deep breath and close my eyes. I hold my breath for a moment. At that moment, all excitement is discharged through my skin and bones, through my arm, up to the tip of the blade, right into her back.  
  
I begin to calm down. I re-open my eyes to look at my creation. I ponder for a moment, taking in what's left of the moment. When the serenity comes to an end, I get to work. Carefully preparing the corpse as if it is an animal. I wrap the pieces carefully in plastic shopping bags and wrap them with duct tape. I douse the bags in bleach and throw them into my old van. I never use the van for my commute during the day. The van is only used for my hobby, nothing else. Over the next 3 hours, I hike in the woods, periodically dropping the bags in caves, holes, and ponds. My duty ends once the last bag is left in its final resting place. I return home as if nothing happened. I open the notebook and write a large X in red Sharpie on her page. Her soul is now free. I can't sit and admire it for long, however, as I must start the cycle again.
