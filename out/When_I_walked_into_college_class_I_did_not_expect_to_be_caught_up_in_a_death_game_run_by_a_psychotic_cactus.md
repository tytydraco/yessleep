**9:04am.**

**Students remaining: 20.**

The new boy was sitting in my seat.

This kind of thing wouldn’t usually grab my attention, but it was rare for someone to join a class so far into the semester. I had adopted that seat as my own, close to the back to avoid being picked for class discussion. 

But there he was, sitting in the seat that I had made my own. Now, I’m not territorial, but I believe despite modern evolution, humans still have those basic territorial instincts from our historic ancestors. Like my roommate with her boyfriend. They are in a long-term relationship, though she makes it clear every time they go out that he is HERS. 

She marks him with lipstick stains and the stink of her perfume, in the way a cat would scratch its territory into a tree. So, yes. I was pissed that my seat had been taken.  I took the one next to him, making sure to throw down my backpack in silent frustration. I’m not one for direct confrontation, but I sure as hell will be as passive-aggressive as possible to get my point across. I expected at least a greeting from him, though he didn’t even lift his head from where it was nestled in his arms. 

How polite. 

The new boy wasn’t the only thing wrong with that particular morning.  Several things could be considered bad omens for my world as I knew it shattering apart hours later.  I could blame it on a lot of things. I saw a black cat on my way to class. It darted across my path and I didn’t have enough time to bend down and stroke it. I have never believed in the superstition that black cats mean bad luck, though now I’m not so sure. I had been too distracted by the intrusion in my usual seat to notice the glaring detail sitting on Professor Never’s desk. It was a cactus. I don’t think anyone else had noticed it, or maybe they had and were pretending they hadn’t. The cactus stood out on the desk littered with unmarked essays and stained coffee cups as a burst of something in otherwise dull nothing.

It brought some color into Professor Never’s classroom which reminded me of a cave; oval-shaped with a low ceiling and rows of desks sitting in front of his usual wooden podium. It was the perfect place to grab shut-eye when I didn’t have enough sleep, lulled to slumber by the ambiance of soft typing around me and my professor’s smooth voice trickling into my ears.  

I thought it was odd that our professor had not turned up yet. He was usually the one chastising us for being late. I missed the bus a few weeks earlier, and there he was sipping his coffee with a patronizing smile, ushering me to my desk. I waited for him to crash through the door with his usual laid-back smile and lazy wave—but after ten minutes of frowning at the door and zoning out, my gaze kept flicking back to the cactus still sitting in front of his idle MacBook.  It was sitting there, I guess. Being a cactus. I didn’t think anything of it until Isadora Cassidy spoke up from the front. “Feed me?” Her tone was amused.

I thought she was playing around at first, but then she gestured to what was written on the board, a message neither of us had noticed until then. Except I had. I thought I was going crazy, or maybe sleep deprivation had me in its grasp. I had already seen the board, right? I felt momentarily dizzy, my thoughts caught up in a whirlwind. It almost felt like an unseen force was gaslighting me into thinking differently. 

Did I see the board when I walked in, or did I just think I did? Was it all really in my head? No. I shook away the thought.  I had definitely seen it when walking into class and then when I was pulling out my laptop and workbooks. It was part of my routine. When I entered, there was nothing written there. I would have remembered it, right? Because my mind would already be processing Professor Never’s question pitched for the start of the class. 

It wasn’t a question. 

There were just two words written in block capitals and underlined twice, and those words put a sour taste in my mouth. Still, though, it didn’t make sense that in the time it had taken me to walk in and slump down in my new seat, a member of the class had written the message. Following everyone else’s gaze, I spied where the words “FEED ME” were written in permanent marker. 

It could have been a prank, sure. But we weren’t the types of students to pull pranks. Especially when our professor didn’t exactly have the best sense of humor.  So, who was the perpetrator? Initially, my gaze went to Nico Oliver sitting in front of me. If there was a designated “class clown” then he would be that guy. 

He was a tolerable class clown though, cracking jokes in the awkward pauses between discussions. Nico wasn’t quite the high school type, a step up from an immature kid. He was one of few in the class with an actual personality, with others preferring to keep to themselves. He invited everyone to his place to work on a group presentation, which ended in a drunk game of Monopoly, and several revelations that were sworn to secrecy in a drunken pact that we would never speak of again.  

I figured he had been the one to quickly write the message on the board, but Nico looked just as confused as everyone else, lips curved into a small smile.

“Feed me.” 

Nico leaned back in his chair with his arms folded. His accent was a mixture of British and Aussie, with a satisfying drawl to his tone. The two of us had been classmates since our freshman year, and I still didn’t know this guy. Nico was an enigma.

He could easily draw out someone else’s past with a charming smile and glitter in his eye while remaining a shadow neither of us really knew. Nico jumped up and loudly announced he was going to clear the message before the professor came back and actually murder us (Professor Never wasn’t one for jokes, only laughing at his own, which were just glorified dad jokes.) I watched him make his way over to the front of the class. 

That was when I stopped paying attention and focusing on my workbook. I’m not sure exactly when normality around us started to crumble, though I’m sure it happened between the single second it took for me to doodle the start of a scuffed Squidward in the back of my book.  There are a lot of words in the English language to describe what exactly I saw—but I don’t think any could truly give it justice. When I think of writing what I saw, I imagine the words baffling, mind-boggling, insane, and extraordinary. Nico pulled my thoughts back to fruition, his sudden yell attracting my attention. FEED ME. 

I found the words once again, and then I saw the marker pen that was suddenly floating in mid-air, its nib pressed to the board. I watched it away back and forth in twitchy movements, transfixed by its dance across its canvas. Nico stood frozen, his gaze stuck to the board. 

He wasn’t smiling anymore. I don’t think any of us were. By the time the marker had finished and dropped to the ground, the boy managed two shaky steps back before falling over his feet, shuffling back on his hands and knees. There were already kids quietly jumping to their feet and rushing to the exit—and I wanted to follow them. 

But I found I couldn’t move, transfixed by the seemingly magical marker pen lying still on the floor. I was half aware of a girl trying and failing to yank open the door, which was locked. There were exactly twelve kids at the door pushing and shoving each other to get out, and eight of us still glued to our seats in a state of shock. Nico wasn’t moving, lying on his back, his frightened eyes flitting from the locked door to the new message this time underlined twice. 

“Feed me.” The words were tangled in my throat, choking from my lips before I could stop them. Like these words and this force had already leached its way into my body. I wanted to join the others, wanted to get as far away from that classroom as possible, but I couldn’t move.  

“Or…” 

I stopped myself before the word suffocated my mouth, but Nico was already speaking in a soft voice I barely knew, almost trancelike. 

Like his mind had been captured by the words too. 

“Or die.” He spoke in such finality, in a whispered breath that told us this was real. 

If the class clown was scared, then we should be too. And that is what our hivemind was at that moment, assessing him for what he was feeling; if he was scared, or confident it was some kind of joke. 

I never thought of Nico as a leader, like a king to his subjects.

I was wrong. We did follow him, whether we wanted to or not. Nico was our spokesperson who talked the most in class and started discussions when none of us wanted to speak.  I think that is what caused a significant change across the classroom.

“Or… die?”

He said it again in a question, his tone bridging on hysteria.

I don’t think any of us were taking it seriously until a levitating marker pen threatened our lives.

Until that moment, the twenty of us were normal college kids, civilized, maturing way past childhood fears like monsters lurking under the bed. However, all it had taken were those words spoken from Nico’s mouth which confirmed that we were indeed fucked, for a girl to start screaming, throwing herself into the door. Humans are like wild animals. 

If you lock them in a room with no way to escape, no matter how intelligent they are, they will revert back to default.  I was reminded of animals in a zoo. We are all born with it. It is just suppressed deep down by our civilized society. We don’t have to fight each other for food anymore-- or kill to have a roof over our heads. When we are challenged with life or death, however, something inside us… snaps. All coherent thought goes down the drain. I thought my classmates were going to react calmly and assess the situation. 

I thought they were grown enough to not let fear take over. But I was wrong. I was wrong about myself too, because as soon as I could move, as soon as my body was allowing me to get to my feet, that fear was alive inside of me, a parasite creeping into my brain. It moved my body before my brain could fully register what was happening.  Fight or flight had already taken over, throwing me forwards in long, shaky strides. I forgot the existence of my phone and laptop, all of my belongings becoming nothing but a blur of material waste; that animal-like instinct already thrumming through me, choking all logical thought. I made it two steps toward the door, two steps toward freedom, before something wet hit me in the face.

Red.

I could see… red.

It was kind of pretty, you know? Like candy-apple red, momentarily taking me back to my childhood full of red finger paint and bright red candy apples. 

I thought it was water. 

That was the logical explanation, right? 

Someone was throwing around water.  But water isn’t thick and warm. It doesn’t cling to your face, wet warmth dripping down the back of your neck and face. It wasn’t water, which was slick between my fingers, when I pressed them to my face, trying to remember how to breathe. In and out, right? In and out. I definitely wasn’t breathing. Instead, I was choking, suffocating on dry air. I was aware of two things at that moment; a moment I measured with two shaky breaths I managed to inhale, before I fell backward, the back of my head slamming into the corner of a desk. Pain exploded. But I barely felt it. 

It didn’t feel like pain. 

It felt like something else entirely, a whole separate sensation taking hold of me. I was too busy staring at the wobbling torso which had been Hannah Johnson still standing upright, swaying slightly, while what was left of her head, mangled flesh clinging to the remnants of a skull, landed on the floor with a meaty-sounding smack. I think that is when we universally agreed that trying to escape the locked classroom was a bad idea. Hannah’s body followed suit, and that was enough to send us careening back to our desks in a frenzy. Nico led us, having already bared the brunt of the explosion of red, he was struggling to walk, swiping at his scarlet eyes. I can’t even remember following them. 

I was caught up in a blur, aware of Hannah’s blood dripping from my face and glued to my neck. I found my desk, slumping back down. I wasn’t screaming or crying, my gaze already flitting back to the board. Sure enough, a new message had appeared. “First warning,” had been written. 

Followed by: *“If you move, you die.”*

I wasn’t sure if I could deal with not moving. I was covered in Hannah’s blood. She was coating me, her blood and brains clinging to my clothes. Nico surprised me by speaking up. I flinched, automatically throwing my arms over my head to protect myself from the upcoming onslaught. I was sure that speaking meant moving. I couldn’t understand why he was being so stupid, so careless. Why speak for us at the cost of his life? He was terrified. 

The boy was trembling in his chair, a king struggling to keep up his quickly-crumbling façade. “Who are you?” He spoke directly to the cactus sitting on our professor’s desk. 

I think at some point, despite how ridiculous the concept of a sentient cactus was, the twenty of us had accepted that this thing that had appeared on our professor’s desk had the ability to kill us. Just like that. In a single breath, in a fleeting second we could exist, and the next, we were reduced to splattered scarlet. I reached up and swiped my hand across the sticky red drenching my forehead. Huh. 

I didn’t realize it was in my eyes.

Nico paused and drew a breath. I watched his lips curve into words before falling flat. He must have rehearsed them repeatedly until finally speaking them with a sharp breath.

“You killed Hannah.” He whispered. “What do you want?”

Caleb McIntire was next. One minute he was hiding under his desk, the next his brains were dripping from the side, pooling onto the floor. This time we screamed. But none of us moved—none of us dared. The marker pen wrote another message, this time in quick succession, signing it off with a smiley face. *I expect a better attitude. Speak to me with respect, and maybe I will answer a question.* It paused, before spinning around in the air, pointing to Nico. “Go on," it scrawled. *I don’t like to be kept waiting.*

It paused, the nib squeaking on the board. *And it’s Mr Cactus, thank you. If you fail to use my proper name, I will kill you. Do you understand me?* It teased, and Nico’s cheeks paled. His bottom lip wobbled with the fear of speaking out of turn. The marker pen this time scribbled in a frenzy like it was excited. I could sense its exhilaration like it really was fucking alive. It waited for him to speak. We all waited. I had found myself mindlessly picking off pieces of shattered skull from my sweater. 

Skull pieces kind of felt like fingernails.

This time, Nico spoke with his eyes squeezed shut, his words coming out in a breathy hiss. “What do you want?”

There was a pause and a collective breath drawn across the classroom.

“Bastard.” Mimi Cartwright hissed under her breath in front of me. Her eyes were narrowed. “He’s going to fucking kill us!”

Mimi was right. If Nico wasn’t careful with his words, he would be unknowingly sacrificing us to this thing.

“Mr. Cactus.” Nico finished, with confidence I didn’t know he could have, covered in the remnants of Hannah. I could still see pieces of her skull in his hair. In a fucked-up kind of way, it was funny. I mean, it wasn’t funny because two students were dead, and another –including myself—could pop any second. 

I think it was the shock of being covered in the blood and brains of a classmate, and then hearing Nico talk civilly with a fucking talking cactus. Hysterical laughter rattled my body and struggled to abide by the rules of “no movement” while keeping in a laugh threatening to send me to my knees.

We waited for someone else to bite the dust—but thankfully nothing happened. I waited with bated breath, even when a minute had passed. 

I could feel the backs of my legs still sticky with blood glued to the wood of my seat. Leaning forward, I waited for the thing to respond. It didn’t for a moment, leaving us to stew in silence. Nico took that as an opportunity to stand up, his gaze finding the door. I knew exactly what he was thinking. If he had sweet-talked this entity, then surely it wouldn’t be him, right?

He would be spared. Like any other so-called king abandoning his followers to save his own life, our leader was already mentally making his escape. 

I think it knew that. This thing wasn’t just sentient. It was smart. Far more intelligent than a group of college kids. 

It knew our individual next moves before we were even thinking them; it was already fifty, no, one hundred steps ahead of us. So, in hindsight, we were fucked. We knew we were fucked and there was no winning this thing, no chance of beating the intelligent speaking-cactus. I watched Nico Oliver take a daring step away from his seat, and then walk, or rather dance, in sharp strides which quickened his step. 

Before another girl’s head was blown off right next to him, showering him in scarlet. He started to run, and like a fucking cartoon, another five students came apart in progressively brutal ways. Like this thing was learning through us. It had evolved past simply plucking our heads from our shoulders. 

Now it was melting the skin from our bones, snapping our necks, twisting our limbs into impossible knots while we choked for breath, heaving up internal organs that had been shredded beyond repair. This thing could set us alight from the inside, bleed our brains from our ears. It didn’t give us time to think, breathe or beg for mercy. I lost all of my breath watching them fall like dominoes. First, it was Jasper, then Mara, Lili, Kellan, and finally, Nora. 

I waited for another student to fall, and it seemed to be scanning each of us, awaiting movement. I stayed stock still. I held my breath and willed my body not to move, not to breathe. I was still alive. Somehow. My entire row was still intact. But it wasn’t killing Nico, only leaving a trail of gore behind him as the boy made for the door, spitting out blood that wasn’t his. Those deaths were his punishment for disobeying orders. It hit me when Nico lost all control of himself, his pants soiled and pissed through, slamming his fists into the door—that this was its game. It wanted fear. It wanted Nico to try and run, and maybe, just maybe it had an influence over him. 

I wondered if this thing was behind our leader suddenly choosing self-preservation over us.  “FEED ME.” The words appeared on the board once again when our former class clown, our king, dropped to his knees and screamed into his hands, clawing clumps out of his hair. That is what this thing wanted. It wanted us to be helpless without a leader, without someone to speak to us, reassure us. 

It wanted us to bow down to it—and we did.

…

…

…

*6:45pm.* (?) 

*Students remaining: 13.*

*Tick-Tock.*

*Tick-Tock.*

*Tick-Tock.*

That sound was starting to drive me crazy. It wasn’t even consistent like it was sensing my frustration and growing louder every time I noticed it. 6:45pm. I should have been home. I half wondered if we weren’t just being held hostage by this impossible thing, maybe we were being held by time itself. I wasn’t aware we had a clock in the classroom, so where was the ticking coming from? The only clock face I had spotted was the new kid’s watch. 

But it was broken. The only way I could count time passing was through my laptop screen—and even then, I couldn’t trust it. It said 6:45pm. But was that true? Had we really been stuck for almost a full day? It was the ticking that was throwing me off. Every time I thought I had a hold of the present, it started again. Tick-Tock.  I could have been imagining things. I mean, I was covered in blood, half awake, standing on trembling legs at the mercy of a fucking cactus. So surely my mind was playing tricks on me. 

I think it was shock, or maybe PTSD setting in. I was proud of our row. 

The six of us had managed to stay alive and were using each other to stay standing. Which was this thing’s new game. Stay on your feet, or fucking die. After standing for almost five hours, I was dangerously close to falling, close to giving into this thing, allowing it to tear me apart with a single thought, or however the fuck a sentient cactus could take control of thirteen human students. It was feeding time, and all of us knew that. 

We also knew that this thing did not like water. We already tried that. Luckily, it didn’t kill any of us. But it did give us a fifteen-second countdown to get back to our seats before it became trigger-happy. So, it didn’t like water. 

I thought I was hallucinating when Nico rose from his seat, and the thirteen of us collectively flinched. Ever since torturing the boy with five student deaths, painting him in their gory remains, Nico Oliver had become its right hand. He was loyal to this thing, like his former personality had been wiped away, replacing our class clown with a submissive blank slate who had offered to feed it this time. None of us dared speak. The cactus didn’t want to kill Nico. He had already proved his loyalty by being brave enough to confront it.

Hours ago, the boy had moved with twitchy movements, too scared to make the wrong move, his eyes wide and terrified, almost unseeing. 

Now, there was an odd smile on his face when he dropped to his knees in the row in front of me, scooped up the remnants of shredded flesh and bone which no longer had an identity, piling it onto a college textbook and making his way to the front. I tried to ignore the way the boy moved like he was floating, as if this thing was dragging him towards it. He dropped to his knees in front of the cactus in what looked like prayer. I wondered if he could talk to it—if somehow, it was telepathically speaking to him. 

The cactus quickly told us directly through the marker pen scrawling words which were barely comprehensible, that it didn’t want old meat. It wanted fresh blood, and fresh meat straight from the bone. Again, it signed off its message with a smiley face.  I was so enthralled by Nico slicing open his finger with the sharp point of a pencil nib, I didn’t realize I’d stumbled into the new boy, who, like me, was also struggling to stand, leaning against his desk for support.

The boy jolted like he’d been shocked, and for the first time since I’d seen him walking in, he turned to me with wide, frightened eyes.

“Sorry.”

I didn’t mean to speak. I wasn’t allowed to speak. In fact, until that moment I’d been sure my lips had been sewn shut.

“It’s okay,” he hissed through a panicked breath, his gaze flitting back to the front. I caught a flash of deep blonde hair hidden under his hood. “I just…” he leaned away from me. I could sense him trembling—not because of the evil cactus holding us hostage. But because I’d accidentally stumbled into him. “I don’t like people touching me,” the new boy said under his breath. 

His words didn’t quite register, sounding like ocean waves rushing into my ears. I had found myself hypnotized by the way Nico was offering himself up to the cactus. When he reached for something sharper, the broken edge of a desk, and held it to his throat, I lost all of my breath. Fuck. I couldn’t watch another student die. Instead of cutting his own throat, however, Nico turned to the rest of us, puppeteered by the thing inside his head. “We need to feed it.” He announced—and it took half a second for the gravity of the situation to hit us. It didn’t want the corpses of our classmates. It wanted fresh bodies that had been breathing, thinking, and feeling emotion, whether that was fear or terror or even hope that we would be able to escape. I felt my legs give way, grasping onto my desk to stable myself. It wanted us. And it got us. 

Phoebe went first. Then Levi. When they put up a fight, the cactus did the hard work, splitting their skulls apart and allowing Nico to drip their remnants into the soil. 

But it wasn’t enough. Claire, who was sitting next to me, was chosen next. This time she held her head high and let Nico bash her brains in. I wanted to look away, but looking away was moving, and moving meant joining the scarlet smear of my doomed classmates, their bodies piled on the floor, reduced to cactus food, or left to rot. After Phoebe and Levi, it still wasn’t satisfied. “FEED MEEEEEE” It screamed, writing in blocky letters on the board. This time, I was chosen.

I barely heard my name being called.

“You.” Nico pointed to me, his eyes were no longer his—glinting with an unfamiliar light. He moved like a puppet on strings, dancing across the front of the classroom, and making his way towards our row, situating himself in front of me. “It wants you.”

At first, I didn’t understand its words.

It... wanted me?

No.

I opened my mouth to scream, to insist I did everything right! I stood for five fucking hours, no, more than that! I obeyed this stupid fucking cactus, and what did I get for it? I was going to brutally die as a sacrifice after everything I had done for this thing?

“But...”

“Don’t argue,” Nico said loudly, his voice a toneless drawl. “If you argue, you’ll die by its hand.” His lip curved, and I glimpsed slight humanity still clinging on. “It doesn’t hurt,” he said softly. “And know that you will be sustaining it so it will let us go.”

“Yes,” the others echoed in a low murmur. “You will be sustaining it.”

I couldn’t resist a harsh laugh. I could laugh now, right? I was going to fucking die, so why not? “You mean it will let YOU go.” I spat. I think part of me was naïve and delusional enough to wonder if I would be a survivor of this thing—if I played its game, I could live to tell the tale. I was wrong. I was wrong about a lot of things that day, but this mistake is definitely up there. There I was thinking I was the main character when my classmates all shared my exact thoughts. They all wanted to survive, to be the ones to tell this experience. And if that meant dragging down and sacrificing the ones around them, then so be it.

*Tick-Tock.*

*Tick-Tock.*

The ticking was back, this time unbearable, this time reminding me that my time was up. I don’t remember hitting the ground, only the kids in my row whom I thought I trusted, rushing to drag me to my feet. They were not gentle, their grasp on my wriggling arms was cruel. Ellie Harley and Jason Westbrook. I mentally willed them to be its next victims after me. Their expressions were hard to read. Ellie’s eyes were set in determination, desperate to stay alive, while Jason was barely conscious, his eyes half-lidded. 

*Fuck you guys.*

The words choked in my mouth, but saying them would only quicken my fate. I let them drag me to the front of the classroom, and I took time to notice what had been our place of study, our solace if we could call it that—had become a hunting ground. I tripped over a body on the stairs, my ankles tangling in splattered intestines dangling from the third step down. 

I was desensitized by the gore at this point. Blood didn’t matter to me because I was its canvas, body parts strewn across the ground and each desk was just decoration in my mind. I imagined a church around me as I was being dragged. In my foggy and not quite there vision, I could see my parents and friends. 

I was getting married. That was the best way to think about it. I imagined a long white dress trailing behind me, and in front of me, instead of a killer cactus, it was instead my husband-to-be. I had a crush on Jake Holiday in my senior year, so of course the imaginary husband had to be him. But it didn’t take long for my delusion to shatter. 

Ellie and Jason dropped me in front of the cactus, and when I tried to back away, I was shoved forward. Fuck. I almost laughed. No, I did laugh. It came out in a squeaky giggle that I quickly muffled with my bloody hand. Nico started each sacrifice by blessing the cactus, just like it told him. He had each time, stroking his fingers across its bristles. This time he pressed two fingers into its soil. I used that opportunity to try and shuffle away, finding myself being dragged closer by my hair. Ellie was tougher than she looked, my hair bleeding through her fists.

My gaze snapped to the chair leg, fashioned into a sacrificial object. Which would take my life. The stained crimson still wet on the edge made my stomach turn.

I closed my eyes.

*Tick-Tock.*

*Tick-Tock.*

*Tick-Tock*

Somehow, the ticking had followed me. I tried to cover my ears to block it out, but Ellie and Jason pinned down my hands.

“Wait.”

Nico’s voice snapped me out of it, less of a trance-like murmur, and more of a hiss. “What the fuck?”

When my eyes flickered open, at first I was too scared to look. I expected him to be looming over me with the chair leg, ready to pulverize my skull. Instead, though, the boy was holding the cactus, and with the way he was holding it, I couldn’t resist a cry croaking from my lips. He was holding it wrong. Fuck. It was going to hurt us. It was going to kill us all, despite my sacrifice.

Nico didn’t set the cactus down, instead holding it upside down, his expression wild. “It’s fake.” He said in a whisper, and then a yell. “It’s… it’s fucking fake!” This time, the boy waved it in front of ten exhausted, traumatized faces. To prove it, he prodded the soil and tried to tip it, but nothing came out. Nico laughed. It was a real laugh, caught in a hysterical breath.

“It’s fake!”

Just like the moment which started it all, a breath was drawn between us, before realization started to hit. 

Ellie let go of my hair, and I hit the floor with a hiss.

Jason stumbled back.

The ticking grew louder in my head, reminding me that whatever this thing was, whatever had taken hold of our class, was not finished.

“Really?”

The voice took me off guard. I didn’t recognize it. When I twisted my head, I scanned the faces of my remaining classmates, before finding my old seat. The new boy stood up with a slow clap, before starting his way towards us. 

I watched him stamp on bodies on our row with not so much of a wince, before making his way down the steps, still clapping, a small smile curled on his lips. “Seriously.” He said, again. “You really thought all of this was a fucking cactus?” 

He blinked once, and Ellie blew up right in front of me, splattering my face in deep crimson red.

I swiped her from my eyes with my fists, barely fazed. 

He blinked again, and Jason followed suit, his headless body running around like a headless chicken, following the new boy’s index finger curling at his side. When neither of us moved, he slumped down on a chair with a sigh. 

“Seriously, I was expecting Professor Never’s students to be smart, you know? The best of the best!” And what do I get…?” He rolled his eyes, and this time, the remnants of the back row went off like fireworks. A chunk of skull landed right in front of him, and he kicked it away. “I’m intrigued…” The boy leaned forward, leaning his fist on his chin. “You guys seriously thought a toy cactus was doing all of this?"

I found myself embarrassed, because *did I?*

He chuckled, and I glimpsed odd-looking marks on his neck. “See! That’s what is so fucking fascinating about the human mind, right?" his eyes were alight with a madness he had kept hidden in plain sight. "We're told something with no evidence supporting it, and yet we blindly go along with it.” 

The new kid scoffed, his lips curling in disgust. 

“You really were going to keep feeding a plastic cactus because a random message told you to.” The boy whistled. “And you call yourself a college student! You call yourselves worthy of Professor Never’s research!” 

He leaned back with an overexaggerated sigh, jutting his chin. 

“I think you should go back to elementary school— or get off of social media because your brains are rotting."

“This was you?”

Nico surprised me by speaking through gritted teeth. “All of this… was you?”

The boy mocked a gasp, widening his eyes. “It was ME? The new kid you have never seen before, and knew nothing about? Holy shit! Who would have thought?” He inclined his head. “Hey, here’s a question! Why didn’t you geniuses call the police?”

His words came over me like ice water, and from the look on Nico’s face, he was thinking the exact same.

“Because I plucked the very thought from your mind,” the boy hummed. “Crazy how that works, huh?”

“But…” Nico shook his head. “But you couldn’t have! I mean…” He stammered over his words. “You… you couldn’t—”

The new kid followed his words, his expression darkening. He stood up. “And yet I did,” he murmured. His eyes flashed to me. “Can you pass a message to your professor for me?” His lips broke out into a smile. “Tell him the Never subjects say hi—and if he wants his remaining students back, he should think very carefully about what he’s going to do with my family."

I caught hatred burning between his lips, curled in every word. “He’ll know what you’re talking about.”

His expression brightened suddenly, and it was so jarring, I found myself entranced by what this boy was trying and failing to hide. “Anyway! I bid you adieu.” He did a mock bow, before turning and walking towards the door, pulling it open, and disappearing inside a wide expanse of light. Through the light, I could make out a hallway, white walls which went on forever. I managed to open my mouth to tell Nico to call the police, but to my confusion, my classmate was following the new boy, directly into the light. Others followed, my remaining classmates disappearing into nothing, and leaving me alone. 

I was alive. I lost control of my stomach, heaving up everything I’d eaten that day. When I tried to open the door, I stumbled onto my college corridor. 

The clock in front of me told me it was almost 10am. 

Class hadn’t even finished yet. 

I was right. 

We had been trapped in time, living out a full day, while a single hour went by in the real world. I don’t remember walking down my college hallway, covered in the remains of my classmates. I don’t remember a professor coming around the corner and rushing to my aid. Then the screams started; a painful cacophony ringing in my skull that didn’t end. 

It didn't take them long to find my butchered classmates, and me being the only survivor, with another five people missing, I was taken in for questioning. That night was full of null nothing. I could see officers crowding around me, and asking me questions, demanding to know why I was the only survivor of the brutal massacre inside room 496. I drained my glass of milk, leaned across the table, and asked if I could speak to my professor. 

I might have been imagining things because I had to be sedated several times, and was only awake because of some wacky meds given to me—but I could have sworn the officer’s expression had contorted like he was thinking. Not about who had killed my classmates, but something else. I figured I was right when the whole thing was covered up, with the official story being a gas leak. My parents insisted on me going home or maybe signing me into a psych ward. I stayed on campus. Initially, I tried to distract myself with anything from TV shows to weed, but nothing was working.

Somehow, I found myself typing my professor’s name into Google.

Nothing came up.

I tried again, this time adding “Never Project” to the search and pressing enter.

This time, I did get something. It wasn’t much, just a Reddit post dated three years ago. *“Did anyone else sign up for The Neverland Project? I saw one of the professors at [DELETED] college was looking for potential students and I was thinking about doing it. Does anyone have any information—”*

The post itself was cut off. I clicked on the link, but it was a dead page. I went back and tried again, with zero search results coming up this time. 

I thought it was a glitch, except the same thing happened on my phone. 

In the end, I gave up and went to bed. I was woken by a draft in the middle of the night. I always closed my window, and yet when I sat up, blinking sleep from my eyes, there was a shadow perched on my window. I recognized him automatically, diving out of bed to try and get to him—to tell him that his parents were worried sick about him. 

Nico Oliver was nothing but a silhouette, a shadow skinned of his real self. Somehow, I knew it was him. I knew his body, which was leaning slightly forwards, swaying back and forth like he was going to jump, his arms stretched out like he was flying. 

I started towards him, stumbling over myself, when I caught movement next to him. His actual shadow, a bleeding blur of darkness trapped against the wall. Unlike Nico, the thing waved its arms manically, attempting to wrap its nonexistent hands around his bicep and drag him off of the edge. In the time it took me to remember how to scream, the boy stepped off of the sill—much to his shadow’s horror. While it bent down and covered its head, visibly horrified, I turned my attention to the window. I thought I was imagining Nico perched on my window pretending to fly, but his dead body was below me.

Lying in stemming scarlet, his arms spread as if in flight, lips twisted into a maniacal grin.

“Sorry.”

When I twisted around, the new boy was in my doorway, his arms folded across his chest. He wasn’t smiling.

When he took a step toward me, I stumbled back. I noticed the shadow was trying to attack him, throwing punches that went right through him. “Ask me any question,” he said. “I owe that to you after…” he cleared his throat, avoiding my eyes. “Uh, well, after everything I’ve done. It's your fault for being in the way, you know." He tipped his head back, groaning."You just *had* to be one of that bastard's students, huh. Which means you're exactly like him, and I'll happily rip you apart."

His smile brightened. "After you bring your professor to me, that is."

Swallowing thickly, I tried to ignore the shadow waving its arms in front of my face. “What are you?” I said. “What has my professor got to do with you?”

*And why don’t you like people touching you?*

I didn’t say those words, but I knew he could sense them, his eyes narrowing. “Oh, so you’re saying I’m not human?”

I took another step back. “You murdered half of my class,” I said slowly. “With the blink of an eye.”

He nodded slowly. “Uh-huh. And why do you think I did that?”

“Because you’re a psychopath.”

“Wrong,” he said. “I just want one thing,” his words were still rattling in my head when I reached into my phone and dialed 911 with shaky fingers. He disappeared, dragging Nico’s shadow with him, with the latter struggling and squirming to get away.

*I just want my family back.*

"And what's your name?" I forced myself to ask. 

He paused, before answering my question. 

"Tinks." He said. "And I'm not going to stop killing them, until your professor comes out of hiding, and talks to me. Face to face, since it's been so long. I've kinda missed him."

He didn't lie. 

The other bodies were found several weeks later, all of them having thrown themselves out of their windows, and found like Nico, arms spread out. 

Like they were flying. 

There's one student left, and the clock is ticking.
