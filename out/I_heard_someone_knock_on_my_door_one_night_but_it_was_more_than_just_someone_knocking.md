It was about 7:30-7:45 when I heard a knock on my door. I was cooking dinner when I heard it and went to go answer the door. When I opened the door though, I saw no one. I brushed it off because school had just gotten out so I figured it was just some kids trying to have fun. But oh was I wrong. It happened the next night, and the next night, and soon, almost every night. I noticed that it would always happen at either 7:38, 7:43, or 8:06. After about a week I decided to buy a cheap doorbell camera so I could see what was going on. Then that night when I heard the knock, I checked the footage on my phone, but to my surprise, no one. I saw something on the side but I couldn't really make it out.

After a few weeks I still hadn't seen anything, but one day changed everything.

It was 7:43 when I heard the knock. I went to check my phone but i had a bad feeling about something, but I didn't know what. I checked my phone and all I saw was a deer staring at my house for about 3 or 4 seconds and then it running away. I knew somewhat about deer from being raised in the country. I also knew that sometimes deer, aren't deer, but something far worse. Over the next couple of weeks I slowly stopped going places out of fear that something bad would happen. Soon, the only places I could go to were my workplace and my house.


 I had been driving back from work once when I almost hit a deer (its a really small town surrounded by fields, so deer weren't uncommon, but certainly not an everyday common occurrence). Luckily, I stopped in time but instead of it running away, it just stared at me, not my car, me. After a couple seconds of honking at it to move, more deer started showing up. But as more deer came over to my car, the more I noticed the blood trailing behind them. I also noticed that they couldn't walk normally, as they stumbled often and didn't bend their legs. At this point I was terrified of what could happen. I decided to put my car in reverse and turn around to take an alternate route home. When I was backing up, they just followed me. I called the police non-emergency line to get animal control or just anyone out here, when I hung up though, they all ran away. When the officer got there I explained to him what happened but he didn't believe me, so he just told me to go home. 


That same day, I was waiting for the knock, that, to my surprise, didn't happen. I checked my phone just in case, and all I saw was a deer, staring at the camera. I had a gun in the house just for safety reasons (some thefts and robberies happened a couple years back so my dad got it for me), so I decided that I would just shoot the deer to get it all over with. So I did, and when I shot it, all i heard was a horrible, unhuman screech. It didn't sound like anything I had ever heard before. I quickly put some plastic down in my truck bed and moved the deer on top of the plastic. I went out a couple miles away from town and dumped it. When I went home, my neighbor came to check up on me and I had explained the situation. He understood why I did what I did so he just went home. After that, I didn't have any knocks on my door so I went in with life. It's been about a month since the last incident, but just an hour ago, I heard the screech again and I don't know what to do
