I need you to understand something before you read this.



I am not confused.

I am not drunk.

I am not mentally ill.



I know what my own life is supposed to look like.



And it is wrong.



It started small. Always does. Missing things. I would wake up and my apartment would feel… rearranged. Not physically. Conceptually. Like the space remembered me differently than I remembered it.



My couch felt unfamiliar under my hands. My toothbrush tasted wrong. My reflection lagged just a fraction too long when I moved.



I told myself I was tired.



Then I woke up one morning with dirt under my fingernails and a deep ache in my forearms, like I had been digging for hours.



There was soil on my bedroom carpet.



I live on the third floor.



I checked my phone. There was a note in my Notes app that I did not write.



It said, DO NOT CHECK THE CLOSET AFTER 2:00 A.M.



That should have been enough to make me leave. I did not. I laughed it off. People do that when fear does not have a shape yet.



That night, I woke up at exactly 2:07 a.m.



I know the time because my alarm clock was directly in front of my face. I was not lying down. I was standing.



Facing my closet.



The closet door was open.



Inside, it was dark in a way that did not make sense. The room lights were on. The darkness stayed contained inside the closet like a stain.



Something inside inhaled.



Long. Wet. Patient.



I slammed the door shut and screamed. I did not sleep after that. I sat on my bed until morning with a knife in my hand like a fucking idiot.



The next day, I found another note on my phone.



GOOD. YOU ARE LEARNING.



That is when I started setting up my laptop to record myself sleeping.



The first playback showed me tossing and turning. Normal shit. Then at 1:58 a.m., I sat straight up in bed.



I smiled.



I do not smile like that.



I got out of bed and walked to the closet. I stood there for a full two minutes, completely still. Then I whispered something too quiet for the mic to catch.



The closet door opened on its own.



The camera glitched.



When it came back, I was back in bed.



Smiling.



I vomited after watching that.



Night three is where it stops being something I can pretend away.



I woke up with blood on my tongue.



Not a lot. Just enough to taste it.



In the bathroom mirror, I saw deep bite marks along the inside of my cheek. Human teeth marks. Mine.



I checked the recording.



At 2:11 a.m., the closet door opened again.



This time, something stepped out.



I am going to be very careful with how I describe this, because words fuck it up.



It was shaped like me. But wrong in the same way a dead body is wrong. Familiar but empty. Its skin hung too loose, like it was still learning where to sit on bone. Its eyes were open too wide, stretched like it had been forcing itself to see.



It stood next to my bed and leaned down until its face was inches from mine.



Then it crawled inside my mouth.



Not metaphorically. Literally.



I watched my jaw unhinge on the screen. Watched my throat bulge as it forced itself down. Watched my hands grip the sheets hard enough to tear fabric.



The camera audio picked up muffled screaming.



From both of us.



The next morning, there was a new note on my phone.



LESS OF YOU NOW. IT FIT BETTER.



I tried to leave after that. I packed a bag. I got as far as the front door.



My keys were gone.



So was my reflection.



The mirror showed my apartment behind me. It showed the door. It showed the bag in my hand.



It did not show my face.



Something pressed against the glass from the other side. Fingers. Teeth. A mouth stretching wide in a silent laugh.



I slept in my car that night.



It followed me.



Not physically. Worse.



I would forget words mid sentence. Forget my own birthday. Forget how long I had been driving. My phone filled with notes I did not write, correcting me. Replacing things.



YOU DO NOT LIKE COFFEE. YOU NEVER HAVE.

STOP SCRATCHING AT THE SCARS. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.

LET ME DRIVE NEXT TIME.



This morning, I woke up back in my apartment.



The closet door was open.



There is no darkness inside it now.



Just a mirror.



And in it, I am standing behind myself as I type this.



Watching.



Waiting for me to forget again.



If this post ends suddenly, it is because it finally finished eating the parts of me that remember how to be scared.



And then it is going to reply to comments.



As me.
