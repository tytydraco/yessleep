Around a year ago I adopted a small brown and white cocker-spaniel puppy. I had just moved out from my old college dorm after graduating and wanted a dog to fill the silence my loud roommates once filled. I wish I realized how sketchy the place I adopted it from was. It seemed rather empty, almost as if it was abandoned and just now being used again after a couple of rough decades. I didn’t think much of it, at the time, since most pet adoption centers in my town are pretty beat up, Well worn, and used. They don’t usually have the proper funds to get any building repairs since they work as charities, that and our town is rather poor. This place seemed especially rough around the edges. Maxie (what the dog was named) was the only dog they had left there. Not like I needed to look at any other pups since he was probably the most adorable puppy I've seen in a while.

I’m getting off track. This damn puppy, I felt so bad when it died. I had been taking care of it and keeping a close eye on it for almost 3 months at the time. I was getting pretty attached to it as well. It acted, played, and even shit on the floor like a normal dog. And in my head I'm trying to convince myself that, at first, it probably was a normal dog. An innocent little creature that had no ill intentions towards me or anyone around it. I wish I could go back to those days.

It first died when I left the bedroom door open on accident one night at around 11 pm. It let itself out to the kitchen and somehow had climbed up to the counter and knocked my coffee maker over. Leading to a small chain reaction, the coffee maker spilt water everywhere, making the countertops soaked in water. It also knocked over the toaster and well. I’m sure you could guess what happened.

I really am not a fan of dead animals, as I’m sure most people are other than the Jefferey Dahmer types, but it was surely set in stone when I woke up to the smell of burnt fur and charred skin. I don’t even want to describe what I saw, it was all a blur anyhow so I probably couldn’t describe much other than the amount of times I had to pause to vomit when cleaning it all up.

I really, REALLY couldn’t get that smell out of the kitchen for weeks. I buried what I could of the poor pup in a small shoebox out in my backyard. It wasn’t much, and it was at 4 am when I finally finished tossing up my dinner. But it was surely a funeral. I’m sorry Maxie.

Just remembering all of this is killing me, on top of the tears, I’m unfortunately remembering the smell. I don't even think I can continue writing this right now. All the times I had to see that dog die... It's beginning to become too much to bear in one day.

If you excuse me for a moment I’m gonna go lay down after I hurl.
