I was seven years old the night I got lost in the woods behind my grandparents' house. It had started as an adventure. I’d heard stories about the deep forest—stories that gave me goosebumps, but I didn’t believe them. Not really. So when dusk came and my cousins dared me to go further into the woods than anyone had ever gone, I took the challenge. I wanted to prove I wasn’t scared.

The trees loomed high above me, their branches thick and twisted, blocking out the last of the light. I walked further and further, at first with confidence, then with a twinge of doubt. I’d been out there before, but not this deep, not this late. The air grew colder, and my footsteps seemed too loud in the silence. The woods felt alive, like they were watching me.

I told myself I’d turn around soon, but when I finally did, everything looked different. The path I thought I’d followed had vanished. There were no landmarks, no familiar trees. Just endless trunks stretching in every direction.

Panic rose in my chest. I tried to backtrack, but each step only seemed to twist me deeper into the trees. I could hear sounds now—low rustles in the underbrush, the snap of a twig that wasn’t from my own foot. I told myself it was just animals. That’s what it had to be.

But then I heard a voice.

It was faint at first, like a whisper carried on the wind. I froze, my heart thudding in my ears. It was a woman's voice, calling out.

The voice was familiar, but not in a comforting way. It was wrong, somehow. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn’t move. I stood there, trembling, waiting for something—anything—to explain what was happening.

Then I saw her.

She stepped out from behind a tree, tall and thin, dressed in white. Her face was pale, almost glowing in the darkness, and her eyes were wide, too wide. She smiled, but there was something off about it. Something that made my skin crawl.

She called to me again, her voice sweet and soft, but it didn’t sound right. It echoed unnaturally, as if the trees themselves were repeating it back to me.

I wanted to scream, but the sound was trapped in my throat. I wanted to run, but my feet were glued to the ground. She took a step closer, her long fingers reaching toward me.

“Come with me,” she whispered.

That’s when I finally broke free. I turned and ran as fast as I could, crashing through the trees, not caring where I was going as long as it was away from her. Branches scratched my face and arms, but I didn’t stop. Her voice followed me, echoing through the trees, getting louder.

Finally, I stumbled into a small clearing, panting and sobbing. I collapsed onto the ground, my heart racing, my body trembling. For a moment, there was only silence.

Then I heard footsteps.

I looked up, expecting to see her again, but instead, it was my grandpa. Relief flooded me, and I rushed to him, tears streaming down my face. He didn’t ask me any questions, didn’t say anything about how I’d gotten so deep into the woods. He just took my hand and led me back home.

I never told anyone what I saw that night. They wouldn’t believe me, anyway. But sometimes, when the wind is just right and the night is quiet, I swear I still hear her voice, calling from the trees.

And I’ll never, ever go back into those woods again.
