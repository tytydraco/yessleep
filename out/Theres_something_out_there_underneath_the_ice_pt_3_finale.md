At my bedside, Edvard loomed over me. He had a blank gaze in his eyes, looking without seeing. A lantern without light. 

"I am here," he said. 

His body began to tremble, and a crack split across his face. Blood seeped from the wound, but as it dripped toward the ceiling, I realized it wasn't blood. It was too dark, too viscous. Oddly, it reminded of a lava lamp I had when I was a kid. The fake magma clumps slowly rising to the top, breaking apart and reforming into other clusters. 

Disobeying the laws of gravity and physics, the substance made contact with the ceiling, spreading across it in a pool of black sludge with tiny pinpricks of white fuzz. An entire solar system contained inside one body. 

"I was there," Edvard croaked, "but now I am here. Yet, I am still there. Help me...release me from this prison. " 

The crack widened with a bone-splitting snap. Edvard's head pulled apart, unleashing a tsunami of black mucus. Hard, gnarled branches protruded from within his skull. A coral reef spotted by fungus and an infestation of worm-like creatures. I watched in awe as it blossomed across the room, unfurling until its roots touched either wall. 

"I can't take it," Edvard said. "Release me. Please, let me out." 

Slowly, he lifted his hand towards me. His fingers brushed my cheek. They burned against my skin. 

Edvard, or the thing that looked like Edvard, began to weep. "I've been here long enough." 

This time, when I woke up, I was greeted by a faint stream of light coming through the window. I bolted upright in bed, drenched in sweat and shivering. My heart pounded inside my chest. 

I looked around the room, but it was empty. No black goo, no fungus, no worms, no Edvard. The couch had been abandoned, blankets cast to the floor. 

Carefully, deathly afraid, I placed one foot on the ground. A moment passed before I had the courage to pull myself out of bed, to creep through the cabin as if every shadow might come alive and start attacking me. 

The kitchen was empty, the bathroom was empty, the shower was empty. It was just me, alone in that dimly lit cabin, accompanied only by a hissing silence as the wind whirled outside. 

Then, the quiet broke as a voice crackled in over the headset. I went to the desk and booted up the rest of my rig. 

"Emma, you there?" Donovan said. 

"Yeah, I read you. What's going on?" 

"I've been trying to reach you for the last hour." 

"I was sleeping. What's up?" 

"Is Ed with you?" 

"No, I don't think so." 

"You're not sure?" 

"I just woke up," I reminded him. "But the cabin is empty." 

"Did you check outside?" 

I lifted the curtain of the nearest window. With the current storm, I couldn't make out much. But the driveway was vacant. My Snow Cat was missing. A set of treads led away from my cabin heading northeast. 

"Son of a bitch! He's gone," I told Donovan. "He took my plow." 

"Shit! Thought as much." There was a hiss of static interspersed with his words. "Mia radioed me earlier. Said she couldn't sleep, so she checked the monitors to keep herself occupied and noticed Edvard's transmitter was on the move." 

I turned to the radar. Edvard's dot had come to a standstill in the exact location I found him yesterday. Mia's dot, though, was gradually shifting towards him, and Donovan's was in route to me. 

"Look, I'll be there in a few minutes," he said "Get your gear on and be ready. I don't know what the hell he's trying to pull, but we're gonna go get him." 

"Don, I don't know--" 

"What? Emma...what did...fuckin' interference." The static was getting louder. "If you...hear...get...be there...minutes..." 

I tried to respond, but the signal was gone. Every channel I tried was overrun with interference. 

I ran into the bathroom and grabbed my clothes from the dryer. I didn't bother changing out of pajamas. By the time I had my boots on, I could hear the engine of Donovan's Snow Cat growling outside. 

I grabbed my equipment bag from the closet and ran out the door. There was no time for greetings or smalltalk. I climbed into the passenger seat, shut the door, and we were off. 

"He's lost it! He's actually lost his mind," Donovan said, teeth gritted, fingers strangling the steering levers. "What the hell happened yesterday?" 

"Nothing." 

"Bullshit! You don't just wander into a snowstorm. What did he say to you?" 

"Lots of stuff, but it's not like he told me he was going to do it again." 

"Why'd he do it in the first place?" 

"He thought he saw someone out there." 

Donovan jerked the controls to avoid a steep bank. "There's no one out here besides us!" 

"That's what I told him." 

"And what'd he say." 

"Nothing." 

"Goddammit, Emma!" 

"I'm telling the truth. He didn't say anything. I tried to convince him--" 

"And?" 

"Obviously, he didnt believe me." 

"No, that doesn't make any sense," Donovan said. "Even if there were someone out here, they'd be dead by now. You can't survive twenty minutes in something like this, much less twelve hours." 

"I don't think Ed's operating on logic for this one." 

Donovan muttered beneath his breath and steered us into a valley. "It doesn't matter. Once we get him back, we're calling in for transport. He's clearly experiencing some sort of psychotic breakdown, and he needs more help than what any of us can offer him." 

"He's just confused." 

"Looking for your car in the wrong parking spot is confused. Wandering into a blizzard in the middle of a tundra is...I don't know what that is." 

It's a death wish, I thought. 

The Snow Cat shook against the wind. Drifts of snow swept across the windshield in curtains of white. Furtively, I was almost relieved Edvard had taken my transport. At least I didn't have to drive, to navigate the perils of the storm. 

Donovan was from Canada. Spent most of his life in bad weather with beater cars and vehicles less equipped than the plow. I trusted him enough to get us there in one piece. More than I trusted myself. 

"He was acting kind of strange last night," I eventually said, when the storm had alleviated enough for the wipers to keep snow off the glass. When it didn't take every ounce of concentration for Donovan to maneuver the icy terrain. "Didn't seem like he was fully there." 

"What else did he say about this mystery person? Did he know them, or think that he knew them?" 

"He never said, and I didn't ask." 

"You didn't ask?" 

"He was clearly going through something. It didn't seem like a good time to be interrogating him." 

"You should've told us." 

"Its not like I could've without him overhearing it," I countered. "Plus, I didn't think it was this bad. I didn't think he was going to do it again. People have bad days and do dumb shit all the time. Spur of the moment kind of decision-making. I thought after a hot meal and a good night's sleep, he might bounce back. Come to his senses." 

"Clearly not. What else you got, doctor?" 

"Are you really going to pin this on me?" 

Donovan glanced at me from the corner of his eyes. There was a ferocity in his gaze that quickly cooled. 

"No," he said. "I'm sorry. I'm not pissed, and I'm not trying to be an asshole. I'm just freaked out and confused and tired of being...tired." 

"More nightmares?" 

"All I have are nightmares or sleepless nights. It's getting old real fast, Em. Feel like I'm losing my mind too. But I'm at least sane enough not to abandon my cabin and look for someone who doesn't exist." 

"Yeah...maybe..." 

We found my Snow Cat parked about five feet away from Edvard's. His had amassed a pile of snow in the night, and mine was already starting to collect its fair share. 

"You got an anchor line?" Donovan asked. "I forgot mine." 

"Yeah, don't worry about it. I've got enough for the both of us." 

"What else did you bring?" 

I unzipped the bag and peered inside. "Some provisions, a thermal blanket, binoculars, a flare gun, extra gloves, a climbing pick, and a medkit." 

"Hopefully we won't need any of it but keep it on you just in case." 

"Way ahead of ya." 

We exited the Snow Cat and were hit by the a wall of snow and ice. I anchored myself to the passenger door and then clipped Donovan to me. We walked across the field, heading north. If memory served correct, we'd find Edvard about fifteen or twenty yards from the Snow Cats. 

This time, he wasn't just standing there staring at his feet. He was digging with a metal-headed shovel from my cabin. Mia was maybe three feet away, watching in horror, mumbling soft pleas for him to stop. But Edvard was a man possessed. So convinced that there was someone out here needing his attention, needing to be rescued. 

"Edvard!" Donovan called over the rage of the storm. "Ed, enough! Come on, man! There's no one out here." 

Edvard's only response was to keep digging. Scooping and flinging piles of snow over his shoulder that were taken adrift by the wind. 

"Just put down the shovel and come with us," Donovan yelled. "You've entertained this madness for too long. You'll catch your death out here." 

There was a harsh crack as the shovel met ice. Then, instead of digging, Edvard lifted the shovel and stabbed it into the ground. Over and over and over. Chipping away at the ice, trying to break through a layer that must've been a foot or two in width. 

Donovan got closer, and due to the constraints of the rope binding us, I too was dragged with him. 

"That's en..." Donovan's words succumbed to the howl of the storm. 

He stopped dead in his tracks at the crest of the hole, glaring down with a mixture of bewilderment and fear. Like the first time you reconcile your own mortality. When you realize just how finite life really is. 

"What's wrong?" I asked, but Donovan wouldn't answer, couldn't answer me. I'm not sure he had even heard. 

I inched forward, my boots crunching against the snow. Inside the hole, beneath the ice, was a shadow. A figure with mottled, pale blue flesh that must've stood eight feet tall, if not taller. Its head was a knotting of branches around a plate of what looked like bone. There were a dozen of tiny, beady eyes staring back up at us. No mouth or nose or any structure that resembled human. I couldn't even be sure that I was looking at its head, or that those spots were its eyes. The human mind naturally makes comparisons and associations. Puts things into a relative sense so as to further comprehend what cannot be understood. This thing, though, was not something to be understood. Too foreign to reconcile. 

Pooling around the creature was a viscuos black substance. The very same from my dream. Slowly, with every thrust of the shovel, cracks spread across the sheet of ice, its trenches growing deeper until that black substance was able to seep through. Then, as it wriggled its way free the tomb, it began to lift into the air, flowing upward towards the sky. 

"I won't do it." Edvard grunted as he brought the tip of the shovel down, threatening to snap the wooden shaft. "I've been under long enough." 

"Edvard, stop," Donovan said, weak with fear. "Stop digging!" 

"Its not fair!" Edvard exclaimed. "I don't deserve this." 

As the shovel lifted into the air, Donovan grabbed the top of the handle. A game of tug-o-war broke out between the two, but I don't think Edvard realized he was playing. He was far too consumed to notice the disturbance. He just knew that he needed to keep digging. 

"Help me," Donovan said. 

Begrudginly, I wrapped my hands around the length of the handle and planted my feet in the snow. Together, we started to pry the shovel away from Edvard's grasp. 

Then, in a fit of rage, Edvard turned towards us with his lips peeled back in a snarl. "You can't stop me!" 

He released the shovel. Donovan and I fell ass first into the snow. By the time I got back on my feet, Edvard was out of the hole and upon us. He attacked Donovan first, ripping away his protective goggles and sinking his teeth into Donovan's right eye. I tried to stop him, but Edvard simply backhanded me, knocking me into the hole. 

I crashed against the ice with a dull thud. The cracks twisted and split around me. An onslaught of incoherent whispers snaked through my mind. They weren't speaking English. It wasn't any language I'd heard before. But the very sound of it, the timbre of the voices, were like nails on a chalkboard. Steel wool against a sheet of metal, growing louder by the second until it felt as if my brain might ripitself apart. 

Images flooded my mind. An endless stretch of black. I could see the stars and asteroids. The firey sinews of a boiling planet. Galaxies devoid of life, devoid of anything and everything. Darkness all around me, cold and suffocating. Deafly silent. 

My only saving grace was the sound of Mia screaming. An ear-piercing screech that made the whispers fade just long enough for me to climb out of the hole. 

When I returned to the surface, Donovan was on the ground, convulsing. He had his hand over his eye, an attempt to staunch the bleeding. Mia was on Edvard's back, her arms wrapped around his throat. But this had no apparent effect. Her weight and motion were nothing to him. He stood straight as an arrow, still and calm as the night. A blank, faraway look in those once warm eyes. 

"I won't be ignored," Edvard croaked. "I won't be forgotten. You understand, don't you?" 

Then, just as it had happened in my dream, his head split apart. A mass of darkness spewed from his skull, projecting its own miniature replication of a galaxy. With it came that coral reef of barnacle-covered branches. A pink sludge that, against all logic and reason, I knew was Edvard's brain. Reformed and reshaped into this foreign matter that coalesced with the black matter orbiting his body. 

Mia's screams were silenced as the darkness swallowed her whole. One moment she was there, and the next, there was no trace other than a glove that been pulled of her hand during the struggle. She'd been absorbed and dissolved as if she'f fallen into a pit of black magma. 

Edvard spasmed and ripped open his coat, tore away the shirt underneath. A seam cut vertically across his chest. A mouth with rows upon rows of teeth. At the center was a bright light, a swallowed star. I squinted and turned away, bringing my hand up to shield my eyes against its glow. 

"I have traveled across oceans of comsos to be here," he said, his voice reverberated like a perpetual echo carried across the hollow of a mountain range. "I have endured tidal waves of darkness and deterioration to find this. You will not take it away from me." 

Donovan, fueled by adrenaline and shock, rushed in and thrust my climbing pick into the center of Edvard's chest. He yanked on the handle, tearing a gash that bled blood black as night. 

Edvard seized him by the throat, squeezing so hard I could hear the bones snapping. Then, as Donovan's mouth opened to scream or maybe to inhale the breath that would not come, the flume of darkness funneled down his throat. There was no swelling, no noticeable inflation. It had happened too fast. He just exploded, popped like a balloon. Bone and muscle and tissue spalttered across the snow, painting it in shades of red. 

My instincts kicked in then, and I ran. I followed the rope back to the Snow Cat, but as I moved to climb into the driver's seat, there was a tug on the other part of the rope, the section that had one been attached to Donovan. 

I was pulled out of the Snow Cat, slowly being dragged through the snow. Thinking quick, I unclipped myself and scrambled to my feet. I got in behind the wheel and pushed the steering levers forward at full speed. 

The wipers fought against the snow that blanketed the windshield, but they could not clear the glass. I never saw him, but I felt the jolt as I ran Edvard over, crushing his body beneath the treads. Then, beyond reasons of my own understanding, I stumbled out from the Snow Cat and rounded to the back storage compartments where we kept spare fuel cannister. I took the nearest one and tracked down Edvard's body. As expected, it was still active. There was no mist to indicate breathing, but the black matter continued to writhe from his skull, coalescing around his broken, distorted body. 

"I'm sorry," I whispered, unscrewing the cap and dousing the thing that was Edvard in gasoline. 

I was acting on impulse, giving little thought or consideration to my choices. I can't say if I did the right thing, but at the time, it didn't matter. It felt like the right thing, the right choice. 

I found my bag and retrieved the flaregun from within. Then, I took aim, my finger on the trigger. 

Slowly, as if it were a struggle, Edvard lifted his fractured head from the snow to look at me. In place of words was a prolonged, guttural moan that echoed across the sky. I must've been half-mad because it felt as if the entire world were shaking beneath my feet. 

I fired the flare and set his body ablaze. I stayed long enough to watch him succumb to the flames. The flesh and darkness withered into ashes, stolen and scattered by the wind. In time, the fire began to wilt. Nothing could persist in the artic, not even a burning inferno. 

Retreating to the Snow Cat, I twisted the levers and started back towards my cabin. The trip was longer than I remembered, and there was a moment when I was sure I'd been lost, but through a break in the storm, I saw my cabin, saw my home. 

When I was back inside, I stripped from my gear and cranked the heat. Then, I retrieved my headset to report to the company, but there was no response. Too much interference, too much static to get a message through. 

I thought about taking the Snow Cat to the next cabin over. The door would be locked, but I could get in if I broke the window. Maybe their system would still be active, unaffected. 

Before I could follow through with this plan, I heard a voice in my head. A distant whisper from the recesses of my mind. Slowly getting louder, its voice becoming less of a gargle and more like...my own. 

It dawned on me then, what this was, what had happened. A parasite that infects its host from the inside out. I can't say how long its been here or where it came from, but I know what it can do. At least, I have a semblance of understanding. I'd seen what it did to Edvard, watched as it corrupted him within a matter of hours. Saw the change in real time whether I'd realized it or not. It left me wondering if the person I'd talked to the night prior was Edvard or it. Maybe it was a mixture of the two, occurring at an awkward interval while one entity assimilated the other. The incubation period before the infection completely set in. And I was about to go through the very same thing. 

So, I did what I thought was best. I went to my computer, opened a document, and began typing. I don't know if the radio will come back online, and this is my only means of warning the others. 

Hours have passed since that moment. I can feel it now. The voice worming its way through my brain. Trying to make its thoughts my own. It's like a tickle at the base of my skull. Like trying to perceive the differences between two photos that are almost identical with a few minor changes. Like trying to decipher someone else's handwriting while they write your words. 

I know now that I won't make it out of this. I'll succumb to this thing by nightfall, losing any sense of self along the way. My only hope is that someone will recover this hardrive. That they'll read this, and against all plausibility, believe it to be true. That they'll know to abandon this place, mark it as inhabitable. And if I'm lucky, if we're all lucky, no one else will ever come here. No one else will discover what lies beneath the ice. 

This thing, whatever it is, it's getting close. I'm forgetting moments, losing track of time. I don't want to become it, and I don't want it to become me either. There's only one choice left. This isn't an easy decision, but I have to do it. I've already prepared for it, and I just have to hope that during my next blackout, I'll eventually resurface long enough to pull it off. 

I've emptied the remaining gasoline cans outside my cabin, and I've got a bundle of flares waiting by the door. It seemed to work with Edvard. I imagine it'll work with me as well. 

I hope they don't make my family try to identify my body. There won't be much of anything left to identity. Just some charred bones, maybe a flick of hair. My family doesn't deserve to see that. I hope the company lies to them. Tells them our expedition was a failure. That we were swallowed by the storm and froze to death or starved. Something peaceful and humane. Something that won't haunt them for the rest of their lives. 

I have to wonder, though, if what I'm about to do will be considered an act of self-annihilation or not. Its still me, technically. Organically. But this thing is infecting my insides. It's taking me over, erasing every last trace of what makes me...me. 

I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't able to overcome it. Sorry that I couldn't defy this thing controlling me. I can only hope that no one else will have to go through this. That no one else will know this feeling, will know what it's like to lose yourself to a dominant parasite living within the grey matter of your brain. I wouldn't wish that on even my worst enemy. 

This is Emma of Cabin J from the United States's Antarctica Research Outpost signing off. If this message has been successful, you will never heard about me or our operation. If I've failed, then the population has most likely been infected. It'll be hard to spot it at first,, especially if this creature is clever and knows how to conceal itself, but trust me, the infection will spread. It'll pass from person to person, home to home, continet to continent until no one is left.. 

Good luck everyone. Stay safe, stay alert, stay alive. And whatever you do, don't go looking under the ice. It's not worth it. Just let it go.
