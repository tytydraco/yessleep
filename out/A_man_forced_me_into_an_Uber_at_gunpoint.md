I see snapshots of his eyes, flickering behind the crowd. This guy’s staring. Hard. 

“Sasha,” I say. “See that guy? I think he’s checking me out.”

But Sasha doesn’t respond. I look beside me and, in typical Sasha fashion, she’s gone.

I hate clubs.

I scan across a sea of college kids moving with the music and, ten feet to the left, a tall guy is pulling Sasha by the hand. 

I lock eyes with Sasha. 

*You okay?* I mouth. 

Sasha turns, sweeps her eyes up and down the tall guy’s back, then flashes me a grin. I laugh. There’s no doubt about it. Sasha’s got that dog in her.

I make a phone gesture. *If you need me, call me.* 

Sasha winks. They slip through a group of people. Then she’s gone. 

I sip my vodka-lemonade, keep dancing. Now it’s my turn. And—if we’re being honest? My part’s easy. I just have to be here. Guys usually do the rest. 

I move my hips a little, feeling the music. And boom. Someone’s touching me from behind. Warm breath tickles the back of my ear as a deep voice says, “You feel that?” 

“Barely,” I say. I turn to get a good look. 

It’s him. 

He’s in his late twenties. About seven or eight years older than me. Handsome. Immaculate hair. Expensive clothes. And he’s wearing this tan, A.P.C. jacket. When my eyes drift down, I notice his right hand jammed into the jacket pocket. Pointing something at me. 

“That’s a gun,” he says, “and this is what’s going to happen. You're going to turn, smile, and walk to the exit. I don’t want you to look at anyone, I don’t want you to talk to anyone. If you do either, I’ll kill you.”

His words hit me, but they’re hard to process. It feels like a dream. Like this is happening to someone else. Oh my God…what is this?

“Turn around. Now.”

I turn. My heart is pounding.

The gun sticks into my lower back. Then we’re walking, sliding between people, moving toward the exit. I pass a group of people clustered together, laughing and dancing. Completely unaware of what’s happening to me. 

Where is Sasha? If I could catch her eye, she’d know something’s wrong. But I don’t see her.

As we near the exit, the bouncer by the door follows us with his eyes. Maybe he suspects something. Maybe I can give a signal. Is it too risky to mouth the word *“help?”* 

I have to try. 

When I part my lips to form the word, the man throws his arm over my shoulder and plants a kiss on my cheek. “That was fun, babe. Let’s do it again soon.”

We pass the bouncer and step onto the sidewalk. A cold gust of wind rushes by and tosses my hair around, and I feel it brush against the man’s face. 

He swipes a hand over his eyes, then pokes the gun into my side.

“Doing great,” he says. “Now we’re walking…we’re walking…look. See that trash can?” 

It’s approaching on our right. 

“Throw your phone in.”

My stomach drops. He’s making sure I don’t call for help. Where is he taking me?

“Come on,” he says, pressing the barrel into my kidney. 

I fish my phone out of my pocket and drop it into the can. It makes a metal thunk. 

He digs his own phone out of his pocket and hands it to me. I take it. 

“Code is 7348.”

I type the code and open his home screen. 

“Open Uber.”

My thumb stalls. I look up at him. “But where…”

“Shut the fuck up. Open it.”

I tap it open. 

“There’s an address, auto-saved. Hit that.”

I push it. The address, which is twenty minutes away, locks in. I commit it to memory. We’re heading east—out of the city.

“Now find a ride.”

I tap *Find Ride.*

The wheel spins. 

*Tony is two minutes away!*

The phone is snatched out of my hand. “Good girl,” he says, stuffing it back into his pocket. 

“Now listen,” he says, barely above a whisper. “When we get in, you do not speak under any circumstances. We're dating. That’s it. If you let on that anything else is happening, I’ll put one bullet into your stomach—and another in the back of the driver’s head. Okay?”

I feel my bowels threatening to give. I…I don’t want to die. I have to figure out what he wants. I cannot get in this vehicle with him.

In as calm a voice I can muster, I say, “I have money. Can we go to the ATM instead? I’ll give you everything I have. Everything. Please just don’t—”

“Whatever bad things you think I’m gonna do? I can do so much worse. The more you talk, the worse this ends.”

A Toyota Highlander pulls up in front of us and the driver rolls his window down. He’s in his early forties. He has a mustache, salt and pepper hair, and glasses. “Bennet?” he asks. 

“That’s us. Come on, babe,” he says.  

I’m yanked by the arm. Bennet opens the back door and shoves me in, then crawls in behind me and pulls the door shut. I’m on the passenger side. Bennet’s on the driver's side.

Our driver, Tony, glances at his phone, mounted on his center vent. He recites the address, then glances in the rear-view mirror. “Is that the correct address?”

“Yes. Go.”

Tony merges into traffic and coasts down the strip. Outside my window, bars and restaurants slip by. I turn around and see the neon lights of the club grow smaller and smaller. 

Sasha’s going to think I abandoned her. I picture blue flashing lights outside the club. A gloved hand reaches into the trashcan, pulls out my phone. It’s dropped into a plastic bag for forensics. Then my dad will get a call…

“So you’re at the University, huh?”

My attention snaps to Tony. It takes me a moment to realize he said that to me.

“Your sweater,” Tony says. 

Bennet said not to speak under any circumstance. Will he answer? 

I look at Bennet. The bulge in his jacket pocket is trained on me. His jaw is tightening and loosening. As he’s thinking, silence fills the car. 

“What are you studying?” Tony asks. 

Bennet nods at me. 

“Criminology,” I say. 

“Oh. No shit?” Tony says. 

I feel Bennet shift in his seat. 

Tony’s eyes snap to me in the mirror, then return to the road. “That was my major…until I dropped out. Because of this one…”

Tony swipes a picture off the dash and hands it back. I take it. With the bar lights flashing through the window, I see Tony with his arm wrapped around a girl who must be his daughter. She’s about fifteen. They’re posing in front of a mountain range. 

“She’s beautiful,” I say. 

“Oh, thanks,” he says, taking the picture back. “Only problem is, guys at her school are noticing that too. Filthy animals. You know how it is.”

He slaps the picture back on the dash. “Anyways, she was worth it. And, in a way, I still get to do my part—where crime is concerned. Best of both worlds, you might say.”

Bennet clears his throat. “How’s that?”

“How’s what?”

“You said you ‘still do your part’.”

“Oh. When I’m not giving people rides, I’m a private investigator.”

Bennet’s eyes drill into me. *Don’t even think about it.*

But I am thinking about it. 

My heart jumps with excitement, but I keep my face flat, pretending I don’t understand the significance of that. This man could save my life. But I need to figure out a way to clue him in. Without Bennet knowing.

Outside my window, the strip of bars ends, and a line of trees begins. We’re on the edge of the city. We veer right and accelerate up the interstate ramp. Tony glances in his side mirror, then eases into highway traffic. 

I glance at his phone. 

Ten minutes left. 

Ten minutes to save my life. 

“So,” Tony says, “How’d you two meet?”

I look at Bennet. He’s staring at me. Does he want me to answer that one too? Maybe this is my chance. 

“We met tonight.”

In the rear-view mirror, I see Tony’s eyes meet mine for half a second. “No kidding,” Tony says. 

Bennet’s breath quickens. The bulge in his jacket shifts forward. Straight into the back of Tony’s seat. 

I went too far. 

I’m going to get this man killed. 

I have to stop him. 

“Well, there’s more,” I say. “We’ve noticed each other there for a while, but tonight’s the first night he’s actually talked to me. And I’m glad he did.”

I reach over, feeling my hand tremble, and give Bennet’s arm a squeeze. 

“Ahhh. Good man,” Tony says. “You’re like me. You play the long game.”

Bennet sits back a little in his seat. I take my hand away. 

“Bennet,” Tony says. “I forgot to ask. What do you do?”

“Sales.”

A jolt of excitement races through me. 

Tony didn’t assume he was in school with me. He noticed that he’s older.

“What kind of sales?” Tony asks. 

Bennet sighs. “Let’s just say I help my clients find…products they're looking for. Like an acquisition specialist.”

I glance at the GPS.

Five minutes. 

Our exit is approaching in *0.3 miles.* 

I glance up into the mirror. Tony stares at me. Then at Bennet. 

“Acquisition specialist,” Tony says. “Sounds…important.” 

Tony drops his right arm off the steering wheel and relaxes it on the center console. He drapes his hand on the gear shifter.

*Exit in 0.1 miles.* 

Then Tony does something with his hand. He shapes it into a gun.

Oh my God. Yes. I think he’s asking me a question. *Does he have a gun?*

I glance out of the car window with indifference. Away from Bennet. 

And with the most subtle motion I can give, I nod.

Our exit approaches. Then passes by. I glance at the GPS and see the wheel spinning. *Rerouting.*

“Hey,” Bennet says. “You missed the exit.”

“Oh, man,” Tony says. “I’ll take the next one and loop around. Not used to driving out here. Sorry about that.”

“Yeah, just get us there, man,” Bennet says. “Too much chit-chat.”

Tears build behind my eyes. I’m not out yet, but I am so thankful. Tony knows. He’s helping me.

Our next exit is in *0.2 miles.* 

Tony takes his phone off the mount and swipes on it.

“Hey. Get off the phone, man,” Bennet says. 

“Sorry, just trying to see where this thing’s taking me—”

“Get off the fucking phone,” Bennet says.

Tony drops his phone on the floorboard. He reaches down, feeling around. His hand comes back up with a phone, and something else I can’t see. He drops it in his lap and remounts his phone.

“Alright. There we go.”

“What was that?” Bennet asks. 

“What’s what?”

“What’d you just do?”

“Oh, I checked the navigation to make sure we’re on course. Again, I apologize for the delay.”

Bennet is looking at me, then back to Tony. “Alright. Let us out.”

Tony laughs. “Let you out? We’re on the highway.”

“Pull over.”

“I don’t think that’s a good idea.”

“That wasn’t a fucking question,” Bennet says, slipping the gun from his pocket. He jams it into the back of Tony’s head. “If you do not pull over, I’m putting a bullet in your head.”

The last thing I want to do is get Tony killed because of me. There’s no reason for both of us to die. I clear my throat. “Tony, please,” I say. “Just…let us out. You don’t want to get hurt.”

Tony glances at me through the mirror, and there’s this sad look in his eye. He nods and puts on his blinker. We slow down and roll off into the grass. Tony puts it in Park. 

“Kill the engine,” Bennet says. 

Tony reaches down and turns the key. The engine quiets. Several cars race by, shaking the car frame.

Tony raises his hands. “You call the shots,” Tony says. “Just tell us what to do.”

“Stop talking,” Bennet says.

We sit in silence. 

Bennet didn’t plan for this. Now he’s improvising. 

“Alright. I’m taking the girl. And leaving. When I close that door, I want you to count to…five hundred. Then drive away.” Bennet leans closer to Tony. “And if you try to come after us, do I need to tell you what’s going to happen?”

“No.”

“Good. Open the door,” Bennet says to me. I pull the handle, then push the door open and step out. My shoes crunch on the grass. 

“Step forward,” Bennet says, crawling across the seat toward me. 

I take a step forward, when behind me, I hear something click. “Drop it,” Tony says.

I turn. 

Bennet has one foot out of the car. Over his shoulder, I see Tony pointing a gun at Bennet. 

Bennet’s still pointing his gun at me. “You want her to die?” Bennet asks.

“You know where the most painful place is to take a bullet?” Tony asks. 

“Don’t *fuck* with me man. I’ll do it,” Bennet says.

“The stomach. Do you know why?”

“Maybe you didn’t hear me,” Bennet says. “If you don’t stop fucking around, I will kill her.”

“Stomach acid,” Tony says. “Once the hole is punctured—the acid leaks. And it burns all those sensitive little organs around it. I know that because my best friend died that way. And, you know? I’ve always wanted to give it back to the piece of shit who did that. But, now, I’m thinking you’ll do just fine. It’s your call, Bennet. Just say the word. Do you want that?”

Bennet’s eyes close. He exhales. “*Damnit*.”

His hand opens, and the gun tumbles to the grass. 

“Hey, sweetheart?” Tony says. “Could you grab that for me?” 

I drop to my knees and scoop up the gun. It’s surprisingly light. Bennet follows me with his eyes. 

Tony hops out and moves around the vehicle so he’s next to Bennet. 

“Thank you,” Tony says. “I can take that, if you’d like.”

I hand it to Tony. He slips it into his waistband. 

“Alright. One last favor. Could you call the police for me?”

“I…my phone. He made me throw it away.”

“Use mine. It’s on the mount, front dash.”

I pick up his phone and call the cops. Ten minutes later, blue lights approach in the distance. Only then does my anxiety start to tick down. 

“Okay, Bennet. I think this is your ride. Sweetheart? I am so sorry this happened to you. You’re safe now. Nobody’s going to hurt you, now.”

Bennet chuckles. 

“What, you piece of shit?” Tony says, dropping his voice. “Is prison funny?”

“No,” Bennet says. “I just think, since we’re saying our apologies, I should say sorry to the girl. About her friend.”

A jolt of anxiety flickers my stomach. “What? What about her?”

Bennet lets a smile stretch across his lips. “I didn’t come to that club alone.”

The cops pull up. And like clockwork—two officers hop out, cuff him, and walk him to the back of the car. 

Before they stuff him in, Bennet turns with a gleam in his eye. “Try calling her. I bet she’s worried.” 

The door slams.

I swipe open Tony’s phone and dial her number. 

“Hi! You’ve reached Sasha’s voicemail. Please leave a message after the beep!”

\*\*\*

They’ve been searching for a week. So far, there’s been no progress. I feel entirely responsible. I should have stopped her. I should have been a better friend. 

But the fact is, I let her walk off *with a stranger.* 

Every time I think back to that night, there’s a sharp twist in my stomach. A wrongness. Guilt and worry mixing together. And when I think of Bennet’s description of what he does for a living. 

Being in “Sales.” 

As an “Acquisition specialist.”

Helping “clients” find “products” they’re interested in, I want to scream. Because I’m thinking that, at the club, Sasha and I were the products for an interested party. 

But mark my words: *I will find her.* I’ve taken matters into my own hands. 

I’ve hired Tony. 

And the things he’s digging up are terrifying.

I owe this to Sasha. And we’re getting close. 

If anyone’s interested, I’ll update again. What I’m doing could get me killed. But until I find my friend, I will stop at nothing.
