It never made any sense to me why anyone in their right mind would look under their bed in the middle of the night. You're lying there. Hear breathing, scratching, shifting of weight, maybe whispering.

&nbsp;

Don't make it's job any easier. It's down there, you're up here.

&nbsp;

And don't get me started on closets. I remember when the infamous Lunatic Tunic was in the middle of his mad murder spree. Lock your windows and doors the news said. But it's the dead of summer and the AC is out. Of course I'm leaving the windows not only unlocked but open. 

&nbsp;

After a long dog walk we come back in and... something felt off. Imperceptibly off. Then I heard Barney growling in the back room. I grabbed my phone and dialed 9-1 and approached slowly. With my free hand I grabbed that classical music trophy I won when I was 12. I held my breath entered the back room and indeed Barney was snarling at the closet. I got his attention and commanded him to exit. Then I backed out and shut the door. "Time to play some guitar." Spoken in an overly loud tone that would be impossible to ignore.

&nbsp;
 
20 minutes later I go back in. Closet is closed, window still open. Ready for anything I yank the door open and... nothing but neatly pressed clothes and a the subtle fragrance of Fabreeze. Point being don't do the creep-o's work for them. Stay out of the closet.

&nbsp;

When the living room kept getting flooded, in the same spot, always in the middle of the night, with the same smelly, tar colored liquid... during a drought none the less. Always by the picture window, which can't even open and always coming from beneath the drapes.

&nbsp;

It helps having multi-talented friends because Leon isn't just a mechanical genius, he can fix anything - he's also a world class medium, psychic, healer and savant when it comes to all things liminal and beyond. "I don't think your problem is structural. It's more likely metaphysical incarnate." "You're saying I have a ghost?" "That's one way to look at it. Some people might say you GET to have a ghost, but what do I know." "How can we stop it from inkblotting all over the floor?" "Let's start by simply asking it."

&nbsp;
 
Leon couldn't do anything that night, he had other engagements. But getting in the spirit of things I wasn't necessarily going to wait on a Ouija board and some candles. That said I did happen to have a Ouija board and some candles so I lit those and went solo on the witchboard.

&nbsp;

Almost as soon as I start asking questions did I get a powerful reaction. The grody tar ooze didn't flow from beneath it gushed. Then it started coming down from the ceiling right onto my head, onto my hands and onto the witchboard. The goo covered the entire board except for the letters C O M E. 

&nbsp;

I stood up and held the board over my head like an umbrella and approached the billowing drapes. I put down the board and reached out, grabbed the drape and just as quick let it go. I stopped. What did Leon mean when he said, "I GET to have a ghost." Do people want to see ghosts? Is my house some kind of mystical vortex? Scientists should be researching this. This could tip the scales of human history."

&nbsp;
 
Thinking clearly now I went to the laptop and started researching ghost sightings and they were few and far between. I went to bed that night thinking about the possibilities.

&nbsp;
 
To make a short story long after several embarrassing encounters with the media, ghost hunters and my bestie Leon... Nothing even remotely supernatural ever happened again.

&nbsp;
 
It's actually a bummer but it doesn't change the fact that mf'r behind the curtain meant me harm or something... who knows. Luckily I'll never have to find out because I'm not doing the ghosts job by checking behind the blinds.

&nbsp;

Moral of the story? Don't look under the bed. Don't look in the closet. Don't check behind the blinds. Make'm work for it.
