A storm was brewing. 

Looking up at the clouds, a shiver prickled its way down my spine. I could see it drifting towards us, already rocking our ship back and forth. As the captain’s first mate, I had no idea what to do. Our captain was addressing the stowaways, turning a purpose blind eye from tumultuous clouds. I started as a stowaway, though I managed to climb the ranks, after pledging my allegiance to him. 

“Elle!” Rowan, a crew mate, was slipping and sliding on deck. 

I had known Rowan since our stowaway days. We crawled aboard with a group of hopeful pirates, eager to meet the infamous Felix, the youngest pirate captain, well known for adopting stray kids and having no mercy for stowaways. 

*Kill your heroes*, is what we both learned, after meeting the boy in real life. At least his wanted poster didn't lie. Felix *did* kill stowaways, throwing them overboard. Back home in the slumps, sharing a hunk of bread and getting drunk on leftover whisky, we thought it was awesome. How wrong we were. 

Rowan almost became a victim too. I watched my best friend brutally forced overboard by the scruff of his neck. So close to being fed to the hungry waves. Felix only gave mercy when I offered myself as his first mate, and would do everything he demanded of me. 

Rowan, meanwhile, became the ship’s cleaner.

I was just happy he was alive. 

“We need to get underdeck,” Rowan pulled at his hat being whipped around by a particularly violent gust of wind. He gestured to Felix, who severed a stowaway's tongue for speaking back. I felt myself stumble back when intense red spilled across the deck. Rowan stood directly in front of me, and somehow I still could barely hear him. 

“Has he lost his mind?!” he shrieked over whipping wind. 

I had no idea. I thought I knew Felix, or at least I thought I knew him. I knew he was a psychopath, though he wasn't dumb enough to kill blindly. But here he was, risking our lives to maintain order. I could only shake my head, blinking through rain blurring my eyes. 

Instead of answering, I moved in slow strides, struggling to keep on my feet, my shoes sliding left and right. 

I didn't realize I was screaming into the storm, until my chest tightened, the words twisting in my throat. “Felix,” I gasped out, just as ice cold rain hit my face, lashing my hair across my cheeks. “We need to get everyone under deck.” 

He shoved me back, his eyes darkening. “What did you just call me?”

Throwing up my hands, I was well aware of our crew manning lifeboats and starting the evacuation under deck. Rowan was in charge, and I could see Felix's reaction, his manic, almost frenzied gaze following our retreating crewmates. I forgot how much he hated his first name. The last person to call him *Felix* was skewered by his sword. I could still remember the thick congealing red glued to Rowan’s mop. 

It took him three days to clean up all of the blood. 

Dropping to my knees, I drew my own sword, bowing my head. I could sense Rowan rolling his eyes. “Sorry,” I gasped out through mouthfuls of icy rain. It was so cold, my clothes were glued to my skin. I was never going to be warm again. 

“Captain Felix!” I corrected myself. “There's a storm coming, and I don't think we’re going to survive the…” I had to hold back a cry when a crack of thunder rumbled across the sky and the ocean. The ship tipped sideways, and I closed my eyes. 

I could feel it, the sea seeping over my feet, the stink of salt tickling my nose. 

“Speak!” Felix ordered, snapping me out of it. 

We were going to go overboard. I was sure of it. 

“Captain! We need to go underdeck–”

“No.” Felix pointed his sword at one stowaway in particular. His grin terrified me. Ethan Hadley was trembling, his hands tied behind his back. Felix dragged the boy to his feet, stabbing the blade of his sword into his chin. The ship rocked again, and this time I was thrown to the side. I had to cling to the deck to stay on board. 

Felix, however, was barely fazed. He forced Ethan forwards, our crewmates staggering under another violent wave slamming into us. I was ankle deep in water, and somehow, it felt right, like the ocean was supposed to take me. I could only watch helplessly, my thoughts in a fog, as our captain rounded up every stowaway, forcing them into a line. When Rowan was shoved to his knees, I felt myself move forward. 

But each wave rocking us back and forth pulled me back. 

He caught my eye, raising his hands in surrender. *Don't do anything stupid.*

I nodded subtly, tightening my grip on my sword. 

Ethan dropped onto his knees on the plank, sobbing. The boy was soaking wet, like a rat, strands of dark hair glued over his eyes. Somehow, Felix was keeping the plank stable with his boot. I didn't understand *why* he was so insistent on killing stowaways, when our crew were in danger. The stowaway turned to us, his eyes wide, lips curled into a silent scream that was whipped away by the wind. 

“Please!” he cried. “Felix! I don't want to walk the plank! I'll-I'll stay loyal to your crew, and I'll even clean your shoes! You promised me I could become part of your crew!”

Ethan sputtered through rain filling his mouth, pressing his head into his lap. “I'll shine your shoes! I'll do anything!”

“I don't care.” Felix said with a shrug, before shoving the boy backwards. 

I watched the sudden change in Ethan’s expression, like *real* fear had replaced dramatics. The boy let out a squeak, his body tumbling down into roaring waves, and something inside me… snapped. I had seen so many people thrown overboard, but this one felt too real. Felix turned to me, his smile wide, eyes lit up. “Do you want to walk the plank, Elle?” he whispered. 

I swallowed, stumbling back, maintaining my grip on my sword. 

“No.” I bit out. “No, Captain Felix.”

The boy grinned. “Good!” He forced the others to their feet, waving his sword. “They will all walk the plank!”

Felix pushed the others off of the plank, one by one, and I watched them fall. 

Ruby, who screamed, a blur of red hair plunging down. 

Ben, clinging onto the side, until Felix stamped on his fingers. 

When my captain held Rowan by his hair, violently pulling him to the plank, I was paralysed, already on my knees, words were twisted and wrong and foreign on my tongue. I screamed at him with no voice, my cry torn from my lips. Rowan was forced to the very edge of the plank, and there was a pit in my gut when his left foot found thin air. Rowan didn't move, his eyes were wide, frightened. He tried to reason with our captain, but Felix was getting a thrill from Rowan’s cries for mercy. 

“Please.”

My friend's gaze found mine. 

His last words slammed into me, before Felix shoved him backwards. I did scream this time, and it felt too real. 

*“Elle, can we stop?”*

Before I could reply, he was falling, disappearing into turbulent waves. 

I found my feet, stumbling over to the side. Felix was next to me smiling. His eyes were bright, and I remember wanting to throw him overboard too. 

But we were so close to the edge, and he would stab me in the back before the thought could even graze my mind. 

It was when I was standing on the edge of our ship, did my stomach start to twist. 

The turbulent waves of the ocean became cold, hard concrete beneath us, where an intense scarlet hue was spreading across the playground. There was silence initially, before the screams started. I don't think they ever stopped, I think they were always there, but my mind was blocking them out. I took a shaky step back from our school roof, away from the scary looking drop,  my cardboard sword slipping from my hand. 

“Felix!” Mrs Johnson was screaming, and down below, the stormy sea was five unmoving bodies in fast spreading red. I could see Rowan lying on his back. His eyes were flicking, lips moving, like he was trying to speak. There was a growing crowd of kids gathering around our crew mates, and I was blinking rapidly, waiting for my best friend to jump up and tell me he was okay. But Rowan wasn't moving. 

I remember his eyes did a funny thing where they opened wide, like he was going to speak. 

And then they closed, almost as if he was falling asleep. 

*“What have you done?!”* our teacher's voice slammed into me. 

The scarlet that pooled around Rowan’s head was too real, too scary, and when I realized and understood what was happening, I dropped to my knees, something slimy creeping up my throat. 

*”Help! Someone call an ambulance!”*

I shuffled back on my knees, away from my grinning captain. 

Ignoring the cacophony of screams, the boy flung out his cardboard sword. 

“Onwards!” Felix shouted, resting one leg on the wall. “Buried treasure awaits!”

It was *his* idea.

I kept screaming those words when the police questioned us. 

And Rowan’s body was covered in a white sheet. 

Felix didn't deny it, laughing through each question. 

When he was asked *why*, he replied with the same thing every time. 

“Because it's fun!” he turned to me during questioning. “Didn't it feel real, Elle? It felt so real! It was so, so cool!”

I said no, trying to avoid my mother’s death glare, but he was right. 

It did feel real. I felt like I was living a pirate's life. I had a whole other life, memories of a mother and an upbringing in a world that wasn't real. 

It wasn't. 

Right? 

I wasn't sure. Felix brought the smell and sound of the ocean, like he himself inhabited that world. When I was near him, I was back on deck, scrubbing blood from my captain's boots. When I was old enough to provide a witness statement at fifteen years old, it only took me catching his eye, and my vision was blurring. The pull was strong, a sudden, overwhelming urge to find my sword. 

I was soaking wet again, rain hitting my face. 

“Elle!”

The voice pricking inside my head sounded so real. 

“We need to get everyone under deck–”

He was so close, shaking me. 

“Elle! Hey, are you listening to me?”

I was on my knees screaming, the sensation of cruel chains wrapping around my neck, when I was dragged out into fresh air, and it was only when my Mom had to gently slap me across the face, when I found myself back in reality, the cold and wet deck of our ship falling away and becoming my mother’s lap, where my head was buried. 

When it became obvious I was suffering major mental health issues due to my PTSD, I provided a video witness statement instead. 

I lost five classmates that day, including Rowan.

It's been ten years, and I’ve mostly moved on. I moved away for college, but I've recently come home to see Mom. She insisted on us going for dinner last night. We left our local diner around midnight, and I was excited to get home and sleep. The drive was tiring, and Mom wanted to know every detail of my life, which was exhausting. 

No, I didn't have a boyfriend. 

Yes, I was eating. 

Yes, I was taking my medication. 

I was following my slightly tipsy mother, who'd had a few too many strawberry daiquiris, when that familiar stink filled my nose, suffocating me. 

The concrete sidewalk beneath my feet blurred into rotten planks of wood. 

Our ship had not been cleaned in a while. 

“Elle?”

Mom’s voice pulled me back to fruition. 

I was standing on the very edge of the road. 

And across from me were several figures drowned in shadow. The kids who died. Ethan, who looked less than thrilled to be there. Ruby, her mouth curved around a cigarette. I saw them how I always imagined them looking if they ever grew up. Ethan still had a permanent scowl, and Ruby had of course become a chain smoker because of her weird cough. 

I didn't *want* to see Rowan. I never imagined what he would look like as a grown up, because it hurt. But there he was, awkwardly standing at the side, his arms folded. 

He was my age, and just how I remembered him, freckled cheeks and a slight curl in his lip. His face has matured, blondish brown hair tucked under a beanie. His clothes were odd looking, a blend of modern and the pirate world we thought was real, a collared jacket and jeans, which was very 2024. If I ever did imagine Rowan as a grown up, I would paint him more as a sweater-wearing guy, not whatever this was. But then I saw his sword, the one with the broken handle, sticking from his sheathe. I used to tease him about it. 

He had made it himself, after all.

Rowan spent all afternoon colouring it bright blue. 

Standing next to him was our captain.

Felix. 

Who died in prison four years ago, hanging himself on his twentieth birthday. 

And with him, once again, came the overbearing scent of a sea that did not exist. 

“Elle!”

I blinked, and Mom was in front of me, clapping her hands in my face. 

Instead of risking another glance to see if they were still there, I kept walking. 

Since then, all I can smell is the sea, and a stench of rotting. I'm choking up the ocean, seaweed suffocating my throat and entangled around my tongue. 

The smell is getting stronger, and every passing minute I can feel reality slipping, my childhood bedroom slowly twisting and contorting into our ship. 

There is carpet under my feet, but I can feel ice cold wooden planks slick on my bare toes. 

I'm alone, and yet I can hear my crewmate’s voices getting closer. 

There's a shadow in the corner of my eye. 

It's always there. 

Dripping wet, bright red stemming around him. 

Rowan’s corpse is following me, puppeteered by our psychotic captain. 

Felix is coming after me. 

And this time, I don't think I have a choice whether I join his crew.
