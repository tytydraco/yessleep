Hey r/nosleep, so my friends were telling me I should post about this here because it seemed, well, fitting, especially since i have lost a lot of sleep over it lol, and maybe somebody here has had a similar experience? Idk, to be honest I'm kinda just using this as an excuse to write it out and process it I guess. 

It all started when I moved into this house, it's a fairly old property, I'd guess it was built in the 70s or 80s maybe and has been renovated a couple of times but you can tell it has pretty old bones, sometimes if the appearance isn't a giveaway you can kind of just feel if a house is old you know?

The main star of this whole property though is this giant tree in the backyard, I mean this thing is huge and it's impossible to say how long that tree has stood there but based on its size I would wager hundreds of years. It has roots that are so strong that the brick pavement that was laid around it has risen and dipped with the curvature of the earth like little hills, it's a really fascinating thing to witness and it is unlike anything I've seen to be honest! I have been mesmerised by it, to have something so ancient and bolstered is pretty special. 

This tree over the years has birthed a really vibrant and luscious garden in the backyard,(due to all the seeds falling off of it for so many years), this in turn attracts quite a lot of critters, mainly birds and possums which is pretty commonplace in Australia, but when night falls I swear to god there is... something that makes its home atop the peak of the tree, and I have no idea what it is. 

The first week I was here it was pretty routine that I'd hear possums fighting in the backyard, and if you're Australian then you know that they sound quite creepy when they scrap, definitely something that would throw you off if you didn't grow up here, however it wasn't until after about a month that I started hearing sounds I cannot for the life of me identify. 

The first time I heard it, much to my surprise (and delight) it was a pretty quiet night.

While on the phone to my friend I joked that the possum gangs must have made a truce together, or maybe their turf war over the tree had come to its conclusion, but then as I was lying in bed getting ready to sleep, I heard this... screeching, but it wasn't just a screech it was like a pained moan at the same time, but it sounded almost human, like, it wasn't all the way there but it resembled a person's voice if that makes sense. Kind of like how goats can sound like little kids when they scream lol, very close to it but you can still tell it isn't a humans voice. 

I remember that sound shocked me awake immediately, it was the weirdest and creepiest thing I had pretty much ever heard (and I have heard the ungodly sound of Koala's mating, so that says something) and I immediately made my way to the kitchen to peep out the window to see if there was anything there, and that's where it started getting fuckin' weird.

There was nothing there, and I mean, like, nothing. The tree was completely absent of any wildlife at all, even in the dark if you looked for a couple mins and your eyes adjusted you could always see silhouettes of sleeping birds, or mice, or possums, or even sleeping bats from time to time but, this night the branches were completely barren. 

At first I thought I just couldn't see well, blurry eyed from starting to doze off maybe, and so I went out to the backyard, and the sound of me opening the old, loud as hell backdoor would usually set off the sounds of leaves and branches rustling as various critters made their escape, but this time there was nothing. Not a peep. Just crickets and wind. 

I gazed up at the tree and scanned the branches for what could have made that sound I'd heard earlier but... There didn't seem to be anything there. This tree was always home to life, always, it was a blessing and a curse, and it made me so uneasy to see it there with what seemed to be not a single animal, then I gazed all the way to the very top and that's when I first saw it.

It's going to sound ridiculous, but, it kind of looked like a monkey? Except it didn't have a tail , or ears, and it had these weirdly really long legs, that kind of tucked into its chest, and its posture was... off. Like it was a very tall creature that was somehow able to totally fold into itself and be perfectly still. It was just sitting there on the top branch, not moving, like a shadow. 

The main reason I even knew it wasn't a figment of my imagination is because two bright dots revealed themselves and directed their gaze right at me as its head cocked towards me. 

I ran back inside and as I did, I heard it leaping off the tree and tumble onto my roof briefly before jumping right off again, I could hear it faintly hopping from house to house as it left the area.

I have no clue what the fuck this thing is, and that's my only direct sighting of it, but ever since then... every single time the possums stop fighting, and the normal nightly noise quiets down, I can hear it. I can hear that screechy moaning sound, sometimes it's far, sometimes it's close to my window, and other times it sounds like there's more than one, but I don't dare to look.

The images of it have haunted my dreams, this... weird, hunched creature, with tiny yet bright eyes, I swear it's been waiting for me to come out ever since and I have no idea what to do.

I called animal control asking if they'd ever heard of a creature based on my descriptions and they said they hadn't and to call again when I hear it, but every time I do call them, every time, this thing scatters off, it's like it can hear me and understand me, like it's toying with me. At this point I don't think they believe me and I can't blame them.

It's been like this for 3 months now, twice a week or so, and I feel lost.

Has anyone here ever encountered something like this? At all? I know my descriptions of it physically are vague, but it was hard to see and even harder to fully process it.

I hope someone here can help me, because it feels like every week this thing is getting more and more cocky, and it feels like there's less and less time before I'll have to face seeing it again.
