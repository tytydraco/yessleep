I've never cared about anything, my life has always been a neutral chain of events that has never affected me in the slightest.
I've never gone to any party, or made any intimate friends, but I've never cared.
I didn't care when my pet dog died back when I was seven (I'd been wanting a new pet for a while, so it was actually good that she died), and I didn't care when my parents forgot about my birthday, because I was too busy playing with my brother. I've never felt any strong emotions like joy, sadness, or anger, but I'm okay with that.
Or so I thought.

Yesterday, I found myself feeling something after four years of nothingness; I was at school, talking to a teacher, when I first saw her:
She was a tall, slim girl, with beautiful bright and blonde hair. My heart started inmediatly racing at the sight of her; she was beautiful.
Days later, I found out she was about two years older than me, just like my brother.
When I got back home, I asked if he knew who she was, but he told me that he hadn't ever talked to her, but that he knew that her name was Karla. Of course, her name was just as beautiful as she was.

From that day on, it became a part of my routine to watch her from a distance so I could learn more things about her, and maybe get the courage to talk to her. I often saw her during break, hanging out with her little sister, Mia. I've seen them sharing a vanilla ice cream several times, which has made me love the flavor even more, and after some more observation, I've learnt some new things.
She weighs about 132 pounds, and is 5 foot, she enjoys playing the guitar and loves taking care of her plants alongside her sister: she waters them once in the morning and again in the afternoon, right after showering.
When I discovered when Karla's birthday was, I was relieved to know I still had time to give her a present, but I still wasn't ready to talk to her, so I decided to give it to her sister instead. She looked at me weirdly ( I don't like this girl, I think she's really rude, but I was nice to her just so Karla would like me), before putting my gift inside her pocket.

That same night, I went to sleep thinking about Karla, and wondering if she liked the gift. I couldn't wait to see her again on Monday, but she didn't go back to school that day, in fact, I didn't see her for an entire week. Could she be sick? Did she transfer schools? A lot of questions flooded my mind, so I decided to check on her.
I went inside her house in the afternoon, right when her sister was busy playing with her band at a friend's house. I entered through the back door and carefully went into Karla's room, which she shared with her sister. 
It was dark, so I turned on the lights and saw her: she was laying in bed, sleeping. She looked like an angel. I had to resist the urge to touch her soft and long platinum hair. 
I stared at her for a really long time, but then I heard the front door open and was forced to snap out of it.

I turned the lights off and hid inside the master bedroom upstairs, waiting for Karla's sister to enter the bathroom in order to take a shower. After I finally heard the bathroom door close, I hurried downstairs and escaped through the backdoor.
I hate Karla's sister so much, if it wasn't for her, I could've kept staring at Karla's beautiful face, but she always had to ruin everything. She never respected Karla; she threw her into the mud and often pulled her hair, it made me so mad.
Moreover, I had a reason to think that she's the one keeping Karla from me, I was scared that I'd never be able to see her again. I don't like feeling scared, so I made a decision: Karla would be mine, wether her sister liked it or not.

A week ago, I filled myself with enough courage to sneak into Karla's house through the living room's window, I then went up the stairs and into her room. I could hear her sister's soft breath, which meant she was sound asleep. 
It was now or never.
I silently approached Karla's bed and, trying not to wake her sister up, I picked her up and started walking towards the door; I'd do all the explaining later.
I was already in the corridor when I heard a light switch click right behind me, so instead of going towards the stairs, I hurried to hide inside the bathroom. This was my first and only mistake.
After a few seconds, I watched in horror as the lights in the bathroom lit up and the door creaked open, I barely had any time to react, but it was enough to keep Karla's sister from screaming.
My heart raced as I rushed outside the house, running as fast as I could whilst holding Karla in my arms. 

It's been a rough week, but at least she's with me now. The police has been searching for me, but I don't care, because I have Karla. Every day I make sure to shower her with gifts such as clothes, new furniture, and even pets, but I can tell she isn't happy. 
I've talked to my brother about it, but he doesn't know what's wrong with her either, she won't tell him. 

I can't do this anymore, I thought I could make Karla happy, but no matter what I do, she always has that melancholic look on her face: I think she misses her home.
I regret everything I've done, I took the thing Karla loved the most away from her, and now she has to deal with her face being plastered all over TV. 
I feel miserable, I just want to end it all, so I've decided I will join my parents in the afterlife tonight. 
And about Karla, I'll leave her in her dollhouse for now for the police to find, right next to my brother.
This note should explain everything that needs to be done. Thanks, Karla, for making my life a bit more interesting, even if it was only for a short period of time.
