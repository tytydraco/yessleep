My days used to be predictable, almost mundane. I followed a routine, comfortable in its boredom—until my life unraveled completely.

I never saw it coming. I never imagined anything like this could happen. I used to trust what I saw, what I experienced. Even when people told me, “This isn’t real,” or “It’s all in your head,” I dismissed them. What if they were the ones lying?

But soon, I couldn’t even trust my own mind. The world began to twist and distort in ways I’d never thought possible. I knew I was physically safe; there was no tangible danger, no reason to fear. But was I safe from myself? Not at all.

It started with baby steps. The unease crept closer, inch by inch. At first, I had days when I simply felt disconnected, distant. I thought, “This must be stress,” because life was stressful at the time. It seemed like a reasonable explanation.

Then it got worse. There were days when I walked home in such a deep dissociative state that I was barely aware of anything. My body moved on autopilot, my mind lost in maladaptive daydreams. One evening, I stepped off the curb, not even noticing the car speeding towards me. I nearly ended up in an accident.

The dissociation brought on intense migraines. I couldn’t function. Holding a conversation felt like climbing a mountain; focusing was impossible. I began to sleep all day, isolating myself from the world.

Questions consumed me: “What’s happening to me?” “How can I make it stop?” I tried everything—grounding techniques, sleeping more, anything to find relief.

But nothing worked. The numbness only deepened. I reached out for my emotions, but they were gone, as if I had turned into a machine. But was I? I’m human, flesh and blood like everyone else. So why did I feel like I was becoming something else?

I was losing my mind. I started to feel like an AI, speaking and thinking in mechanical patterns. The people around me felt like characters in a story—not real, not human. I became convinced that I was trapped in a simulation, that nothing was real.

My mind was playing cruel tricks on me. I’d wake up in the morning, and for a fleeting moment, everything would feel normal, real. But within minutes, the illusion would shatter, and I’d be lost again.

This cycle continued for months, like a demon had taken hold of me, punishing me just for existing. It didn’t get better. It didn’t pass.

So, I believed that was my new reality. Thoughts began creeping into my mind, saying, “People are lying to you. Don’t trust them. You’re better off without them. And you ARE in a simulation. This is a game. The only way out is by killing yourself.”

I started doubting my own mind. I felt overwhelmed, exhausted, confused, and, most importantly, empty. So, I ignored the thoughts. I believed it was better to stay in doubt than take them at face value.

I started preparing for bed when I heard someone call my name. I looked around the house for the source of the voice, but no one was there. The voice felt unfamiliar, yet it was as if someone who knew me had called out. “Perhaps it wasn’t a person at all,” I thought, as I walked to the bathroom to brush my teeth.

Afterward, I got into my pajamas and laid down in bed. But as I stared into the pitch-black darkness, I swore I saw someone looking at me. They had dark red eyes. “Ugh, what now? Leave me alone. I’m trying to sleep.”

But that wasn’t the end of it. No, there was more. My thoughts were not in the correct order. I was losing my ability to form sentences. I tried my best, but others couldn’t understand me. They were confused and concerned, but all they could offer was… simply nothing.

And the room itself was changing. I had no sense of time or space. Time felt like it was speeding up or slowing down—sometimes both at the same time. Even walking was difficult. Standing up, feeling where the objects and walls were—they felt as if they were moving away or coming closer.

I knew that the wall a few meters away was there. But why, then, was I misjudging distance so badly, barely able to walk or touch the wall?

I was overwhelmed. I started to cry, panic, and hyperventilate. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know what was going on. I called out to my family for help, but they didn’t understand what I needed help with. All I wanted was for someone to stop this madness. I was going insane.

Four hours passed. I was still hyperventilating. I went from crying to laughing quietly in my room, curled up in the corner between two walls. I scratched my legs until they bled. I hit my head, hoping to feel something, anything, to end this. But it didn’t end. I couldn’t sleep, function, or even communicate with others. I was scared of myself, of others, and terribly paranoid.

I thought, “I want this to stop. Please, someone save me. Please, I’ll do anything for this to end. If it doesn’t, I’ll kill myself. It’s the only way out.”

But here I am, lying in bed and writing my story. I didn’t die. I’m still alive, and I thank God I survived.
