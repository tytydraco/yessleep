Last summer, my team stopped calling me “Lucky Wendy.” It wasn’t just because of the ridiculous amount of bodies we kept finding. It was because of the way Mitt Scallion said it when he came back.

“Still going by Wendy, huh?” he sneered, his hydraulic rig whirring as he rolled closer. “Guess some things never change.”

I’d spent my whole life defending that name. Growing up, it was a target on my back — kids teasing me, teachers double-taking when they called roll. But I’d made it mine. I’d earned respect as a ranger, as someone who could handle anything the wilderness threw at me.

Now, though, hearing it in Mitt’s voice, it felt like a curse. Like he was reminding me of every mistake I have ever made, and shameful secret I have ever had.

The bodies started dropping like flies after the unlooked-for return of Mitt Scallion. I’d been haunted by the memory of his bloodshot eyes ever since we hauled him out from under his tractor. His words — “You’ll regret this” — weren’t the ravings of a delirious man. They were a curse.

When I saved Mitt’s life, I thought I’d done something good. Something that would finally make all those “Lucky Wendy” jokes mean something. But by the time the summer ended, my so-called “luck” had turned sour.

It started with what was supposed to be a routine search and rescue of a missing hiker.

We were called to Bear Haven Caves. A woman named Sherryl Kane had gone missing. Tracker dogs picked up her trail, leading deep into the cave system. When we arrived, we found the hunter whose dogs tracked her to the caves, pacing at the entrance.

“Sent my dogs in,” he muttered, tugging at the brim of his hat. “Heard gunshots, then nothing. Dogs didn’t come back.”

We called in backup — two county sheriff SWAT officers joined us — and geared up. The ‘Stalker’ night-vision goggles we wore were state-of-the-art and hummed softly, glowing a soft green; the younger rangers who gave it that unofficial moniker joked about how much they resembled the ones from the video game and fan movie of the same name.

Their banter felt comforting. Familiar. The feeling didn’t last.

Inside the caves, the air was cold and heavy, filled with the stench of decay. At first, we found nothing. Then, in one of the deeper chambers, we found… pieces. Sherryl Kane had been dismembered into at least seventy-two separate parts. Half of the cuts were clean and surgical, but some wounds were jagged — like they’d been made with claws. However, lab results would later puzzlingly confirm the traces of metal embedded in her remains.

Deeper in, we found the hunter’s dogs. Or what was left of them. Their bodies were riddled with birdshot, as though they’d been killed with a shotgun. The SWAT officers exchanged uneasy glances, hands hovering over their sidearms. My throat mic crackled with static, and for a moment, I thought I heard whispering amidst soft mechanical whirring. A voice that sounded almost… familiar.

We backed out of the caves, dragging what remains we could recover in black body bags. The hunter who had met us earlier was weeping copiously, hugging one of the rangers at the makeshift command center we had set up by the entrance, after hearing what happened to his beloved canines.

“My babies!!!!!!!!!” he cried out.

That was the first of many.

The bodies kept piling up. Hikers, campers, even seasoned outdoorsmen. At first, the victims were a mix — men, women, young, old. But as the summer wore on, the pattern shifted. Almost exclusively middle-aged males. And the mutilations… they were specific. Horrifyingly specific. 

Their cocks, balls, and buttholes were removed. Cleanly. Surgically. And never found with their remains. 

The first time we discovered it we thought it was a fluke. A sick coincidence. But by the fifth victim, it was undeniable. Someone — or something — was targeting men and taking those parts. The lab reports confirmed the cuts were precise… almost professional, but the absence of the removed tissue was baffling. Where were they going? Why?

People started to whisper that it was the Catskills’ ‘Big Foot Killer’ who was, at the time, still at large. But I knew better. This wasn’t the work of the almost mythical serial killer. This was calculated. Personal. It felt different from the usual brutal rampage of the Big Foot Killer.

Mitt was a weekend farmer before the incident. Rumors swirled about what he did with the ‘herbs’ he grew — some said he sold them to shady buyers, others claimed he used them to concoct homemade remedies, moonshine brews, and designer drugs. Whatever the truth, Mitt’s farm had always been a place locals avoided.

After the accident, everything changed. Mitt converted his farm into a pig operation. Big, hulking pigs that he’d joke were “more human than most people.” He expanded quickly, breeding more and more of them. At first, I thought it was just Mitt trying to rebuild his life. But now… now I can’t stop thinking about it.

The metallic slivers in the victims’ wounds. The surgical precision of the mutilations. The missing tissue. And Mitt’s new… enhancements. His hydraulic personal mobility rig attached to where his lower body would have been, with its retractable appendages and built-in shotgun that he said was for "protection in the wilderness". The way he moved with mechanical precision. The way he’d smile when he talked about his pigs.

“They’re thriving,” he’d said during one of his rare interviews. “Best-fed pigs in the state.”

At the time, I thought it was just Mitt being Mitt. Eccentric. Odd. But then…  I can’t stop thinking about what he might be feeding them.

That night, I dreamed of bloodshot eyes and metallic claws. Of whispers in the dark and the sound of hydraulic joints grinding against dirt and stone. When I woke up, there was a voicemail on my phone. It was static at first but then came the voice. Mitt’s voice.

“You should have let me die.”

The line went silent for a moment, and I almost hung up. But then I heard it — a faint, mechanical whirring in the background, growing louder. And beneath it, another sound. A voice, barely audible, whispering my name. 

“Wendy…”

It wasn’t Mitt’s voice.

And then, faintly, the sound of pigs. Grunting. Snuffling. Feeding.

The summer wasn’t over yet. And I felt it in my bones that my saving of Mitt Scallion had led to something much, much worse. It still pains me to think about it. I'll stop for now. Catch you guys in my next post!
