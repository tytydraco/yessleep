**These are the last entries from my exploration journal. I just want to share it all and be done with it. Maybe then I’ll let go.**



**For more information, and for those who don’t know, I was documenting the old ABC cinema in Glasgow for a personal project—nothing out of the ordinary. But something went wrong. I realise I didn’t specify the location before, I guess I wasn’t sure if I really wanted to know if anyone else had experienced it. I don't know if I’ll ever be able to explain what happened, or if anyone will even believe me.** 

  
***I don't even know if I believe myself.*** 



**But if you've ever been inside—or experienced something similar— I need to know.** 



**Please.** 



**10AM**



I froze for a moment as my mind scrambled to rationalise what I’d just heard. Old seats, old mechanisms. That’s all it was. I had opened the door too fast, the air had shifted, and the chair had reacted. 



Simple. Logical. 



But as I moved through the walkway, my grip on the torch tightened. My palms were slick with sweat, and for a moment, I almost lost hold of it. I swallowed hard. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d made a mistake by turning my back. 



I stepped through the doors into the main hall with the concession stand. As if cued by my presence, a sickly sweet scent filled the air. Like popcorn—but fetid, as if it had been seasoned with decay.



I checked my watch to ground myself. **10AM.**



I’d only been in the screening room for twenty minutes—hadn't I? 



So where had two whole hours gone?



I decided then and there to head upstairs, take the photographs I’d come for, and leave. Paranormal or not, there was a presence here I could no longer ignore. 



Weighted and watching—I couldn’t see it, but I could feel it. I could smell it.



**11AM.**



I thought back to the route I had planned and made my way upstairs. No longer enthralled by the beauty of decay and history, I moved with purpose. 



At the top of the stairs, I glanced left—where the projection room should have been, according to the map. Instead, it led only to a waiting room. 



Maybe I was remembering it wrong. 



I turned right—and my body stiffened.



The hallway stretched far too long for a building of this size, and the putrid smell was stronger here, seeping from the darkness ahead.



As I shone my torch down the hallway, I reminded myself of why I was here. To get pictures of a place before it changes forever. Usually, while urban exploring, I’d get the fear now and then due to loud noises, animals or even humans. 



But being afraid of a smell? Of a chair? 



This was a new experience. 

  
**3:03PM**



The torch flickered once. Then the whole world went dark—striking fear into my entire being. I felt wind rush through my hair, and the hallway was gone. The torch refused to turn back on, and I was forced to find new batteries in the dark. 



I crouched low, fumbling through my bag by touch alone. My hands trembled as I cracked open the battery casing. One battery slipped from my fingers and skittered away— its sound unnaturally loud against the silence.



My vision blurred, one battery isnt enough. 



Visions swarmed my mind—trapped here, lost and alone in the thick darkness—when the torch flared back to life, dim but enough. 



I froze.



My knees were not on the carpet anymore. 



I was sitting. Surrounded by seats. 



Screen 6. 



I was in Screen 6. 



And I was sitting in the lowered seat.



The same one. 



I hadn’t walked here. I hadn’t sat down. I hadn’t even decided to turn back. I checked my watch again—**3:10PM**. That couldn’t be right. It had been **11AM** just moments ago.

I blinked hard, then checked my phone for confirmation. **3:10PM.** Same.

The last three hours were… gone.

I gripped the edge of the seat, trying to ground myself, but it was no use. My legs were shaking.

I stood up too fast, nearly dropping the torch again, I caught it sloppily in my damp hands. The seat sprang up behind me with that same soft thunk. 



I scanned the room, half-expecting to see something in the red shadows. 



There was no movement. 



What I noticed were the seats. From a distance, they looked new—like they’d just been installed. 



The once out-of-place clean seat now blended perfectly with the rest. 



Everything else—the faded red, the crumbling walls, the gaping ceiling—remained untouched. Unchanged. 



As if whatever was changing this place had only just begun.



Without thinking—compelled by something between fear and curiosity—I touched the chair. I expected the feel of soft leather or velvet. 



Instead my fingers sank into something blackened and damp, pulsing under my touch. 



I recoiled and dropped the torch.



The stench filled my lungs—the same rancid, death like smell I caught a whiff of at the start of my exploration.  



The same substance from the popcorn machine. 



How hadn’t I noticed it before?



I fumbled to my knees, where the torch had landed—almost swallowed by the glistening, mold-like substance. I grabbed it and yanked as hard as I could. 



It wouldn’t budge.



In a frenzy I planted my feet and tried again—bracing, pulling with all my might. 



This time, it slipped free without resistance. 



As if it had never been stuck at all.



The sudden give sent me careening backward, and I hit the floor hard—cement, cold and jarring. 



For a moment, I just lay there in a daze, the torch clutched to my chest like a lifeline.



Then the question hit me.



Where did the seats go?



**3:27PM**



The air had curdled. The stench had ripened into something unbearable—sweet and sour and rotting all at once, as if I were now inside a dying animal.



I was in the projection room.



There was nothing left to identify it as a projection room, except for two distinctive portholes on the wall—through them I could make out the red glow of the screen room below.



I covered my mouth and squinted against the horrific odor. I was surrounded by noxious vine-like mould—ropes of it hanging from the ceiling like sinew, clinging to the walls, slick and throbbing with a wet pulse.



It was alive, even if the smell told me otherwise. 



Without warning the sound of a thousand people laughing and clapping filled my ears. So sudden, it was as if someone had hit play on a laugh track half way through—blaring at full volume.



The voices were warped. Ancient. Off-key.



And it was coming from the mould. 



My feet were sinking into it. I could feel the rank wetness soaking my socks, seeping into my skin like it was searching for a way inside. 



I couldn’t think. My body moved on instinct—fueled by something primal, something frantic.



Get out now.



The camera was already in my hands and aimed in no particular direction. 



The flash went off.



A rush of light. A heavy rhythmic thudding in my chest. 



The foyer. 



I was standing exactly where I'd taken my first photo—camera held up to my eye, knees bent. 



My feet were soaked. My clothes clung to me, damp with sweat. My skin itched from the inside out. 



I spun around— delirious—searching for the steps that led inside, for some sign, any logic, something to ground me in reality.



Instead I was met with an impenetrable barricade. 



Rust-eaten metal bars welded across the stairway entrance. Razor wire filled up every possible weak point. 



No-one had stepped inside in years. 



I fell to the floor and sobbed. 



What the fuck was that? 



My watch read **4:10PM.** The sun was setting through the windows. 



The mould was everywhere. It covered everything—a light dusting, hardly perceptible. 



But on the things that I remember being pristine, the mould was slick. Throbbing. 



I still don't know if I ever went in. 



I checked my camera. There were over a thousand images. 



The same one. 



The first photo I took—over and over again. 



I burned everything I wore that day, even though by the time I thought to check for spores, there was nothing to be found. No fetid smell of death. No sickening dampness.
