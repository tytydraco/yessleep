The [journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/vOIUjP81SQ) to discovering the first body was even more exhausting than I anticipated. And according to the tapes that I'd found in the junk store, there were still seven more out there... somewhere in the marsh.

*Who knows how far we'll have to go, just to find the next one?* I wondered, as I waited for the second cassette's audio to begin playing.

"If you're listening to this, you found the first body in the marsh. To find the second, simply take five steps north." The narrator began, his voice playing back from the cassette player and into my headphones.

But upon waiting for further instructions, I only heard silence.

*Wait... What?* I thought to myself, before the man continued.

"You're probably wondering how that could be possible. Well, the truth is, the body that you just found... is part of a pair. A couple, to be precise. In this case, a very old couple, guilty of buying into a false dream. That, of lifelong companionship. An illusion of eternal love, knowing full well, that we're all born alone... and die alone. When you're ready to find the next body, switch over to the third tape."

CLICK.

I pressed pause on the cassette player. *There are two bodies here?*

That's when I remembered that Jess and Mike were still digging in the mud, a few feet from where we found the first body, in an attempt to find its clue, and completely unaware that there was another corpse beneath their feet.

"Wait! Stop!" I called out to them.

But it was too late.

Seeing the remains of the second body, Jess screamed and stumbled back, while Mike, having just pulled a small wooden box out of the ground, suddenly dropped it and closed his eyes.

"Another one?" He yelled out to me.

"Yeah. According to the tapes, it was a couple." I explained.

"Well thanks for warning us!" Jess added.

"I just played it now!"I replied.

"Well did it say their names?" Mike asked.

"Their names? No. But it said they were very old."

"Ah, okay."

"Why do you ask?"

"No reason." Mike replied, defensively.

"So what was the clue?" Jess interjected.

Mike picked up the wooden box that he had just unearthed from the burial site, opened it, and revealed a piece of paper, with nothing but the letter "J" written on it.

"What do you think it means?" I asked.

"It's just one clue, idiot." Mike scoffed. "It's too soon to say. More the reason we get to finding the others. What are the next instructions?"

I switched tape "2" for tape "3" and pressed play.

CLICK.

"You've made it to tape three. Which means you've discovered the first two bodies. To find the next one, keep heading in the same direction you've been walking, and don't stop until you find the wreckage of an old boat, lodged in the mud. Not far from it, you'll find the third body. When you do, switch to tape four."

CLICK.

We'd been trudging through the marsh, navigating the fog with just a single flashlight, for what must have been another twenty minutes or so, when Jess and Mike's banter began to wear on me.

"You know, with the election coming up in just a few days, I really wish I could vote." Jess said to Mike.

"Why?" He asked.

"'Cause then I could help change the world."

"That's not how it works. You'd vote for Clinton in an already blue state, so it would basically mean nothing."

"You're both wrong!" I interrupted. "The world doesn't change overnight, and her vote would matter. But none of us are old enough to vote anyway, so can we just drop-"

But before I could continue, Jess interjected, calling back to Mike and I from up ahead.

"Hey guys..."

We both looked over, to find her pointing to, of all things, a thick mist that was enveloping everything ahead of us, and rapidly closing in.

"Maybe we should head back after all." Jess backtracked.

"Yeah, you already found a second body, Mike. Now can we just go home?" I insisted.

But Mike wasn't having it.

"Sorry losers. We gotta keep going. A vote's a vote. But we're almost there. And don't worry, a little fog's not gonna hurt nobody."

That's when it hit me.

"Mike, back at the last couple we found. You had asked me if the tape had said their names?"

"Yeah. So what?" He replied.

"Why is that?"

"I told you. No reason."

"Just be honest."

"Alright fine..." He said, before pausing for a moment, and then looking me in the eyes. "...I thought that maybe my dad was one of them."

"I knew it!" I exclaimed, frantically pacing around the grass. "Mike, are you kidding me? That's why you're dragging us along with you?"

"Now that I know there are all these missing people out here, it just got me thinking... Maybe that's where he ended up." He replied.

"Dude," I began, "Hate to break it ya, but your dad was a drunk, who went to the packie one day, and never came back. I don't know where he is. But one thing I do know is... he sure as heck ain't out here."

"What did you just say, Tyler?" Mike growled, his face growing red with anger, as he stormed over to me.

But Jess jumped between us. "Hey, stop!"

"Fine. You know what. I don't need you guys. I'll find the rest of the bodies myself." Mike said defiantly, as he turned around and walked away.

"But what about the mist? We only have one flashlight." I yelled out to him.

"Keep it! I don't need it!" He called back to us, without looking back, as he disappeared into the fog.

Jess and I must have been walking in circles for a good thirty minutes, disoriented by the mist, before we finally got our bearings, and continued on our way back home.

"It's just funny is all. Pahk the cah." Jess said, doing her best impression of a Boston accent, while careful not to trip in the grass.

"That's your impression of me?" I asked, my boots splashing in the mud.

"Yeah, is it wicked pissah, kid?" She answered playfully.

"Good one." I replied. "Easy for you transplants to joke about our accents, after you move to our town, with your fancy homes, your fancy cars, and your Long Island accents. Well, you know what? Maybe I find your accent funny too."

"Do you now?"

I paused for a moment.

"Nah, it's cute." I replied.

"Cute?" Jess asked.

"Oh, I mean uh... totally not cute at all, I swear."

She stopped and gave me a cheeky smile.

"Tyler, are you flirting with me?"

"No..." I said, as she took a step closer.

"'Cause you know, out here in the marsh, surrounded by a sinister fog and all these dead corpses, might be..."

"An inappropriate time?" I interjected, my face beginning to blush.

Jess leaned in even closer, her face just an inch from mine, and smiled. "...Romantic."

As she was about to kiss me, I saw her close her eyes, but couldn't seem to close mine, completely in shock that this moment was finally happening.

But just before her lips touched mine, I felt my boots sinking into the mud, and tilted my head down, leaving her hanging there, confused.

"What's wrong?" Jess asked, opening her eyes, a look of disappointment washing over her face.

"Um... We have a bit of a problem." I said, gesturing to the ground, where both of our legs were now almost completely submerged in the mud.

"Oh no!" Jess said, before attempting to pull herself out of the ground, and realizing that she was stuck. I followed suit, also to no avail.

Then we looked at each other, and both began to laugh at the awkward situation we'd gotten ourselves into... until we continued to sink deeper and deeper into the mud.

Jess' eyes suddenly turned from jovial to concerned, and she began yelling, "Help! Help!"

I joined in, but after a few minutes of shouting, began to lose hope, accepting our inevitable demise, and the irony of two more bodies being added to the marshy graveyard.

But just when the mud reached our necks, as we each shot each other one last look of affection, suddenly someone came stomping over, and ripped us out of the ground.

"What on earth are you two kids doing out here at this hour?" Our rescuer exclaimed, as he dropped us onto a more stable patch of grassy marshland a few feet away.

He was an old man with a white beard, wearing a pair of rubber wading pants, that were completely covered in mud.

The serial killer! I thought to myself, before realizing that his voice sounded nothing like the tape's narrator, and that he could have easily killed us when we were stuck in the marsh, but didn't.

"We got lost." I replied, careful not to offer up too much information.

"Thanks for saving us." Jess added.

"You two are lucky I was out here."

"What were you doing out here?" I asked, suspicious of his why someone, besides us, would be out here in the marsh so late at night.

"Clammin.'" He replied.

"Clammin'?" Jess asked.

"I'm a clammer. Ain't nothin in the world that brings me as much solace as searching for clams at night. But anyways, you two better be getting back. I saw the man out there earlier."

"The man?" I asked.

"Yes, the man in the marsh." He replied.

"Who's... that?" Jess added.

"Us clammers and fishermen see him all the time, out there in the marsh. Always at night. And always digging away in the mud. Legend has it, he's the captain of that submerged boat out there, forever trying to free it."

Jess and I both looked at each other, our eyes wide with fear.

"Anyways, I'd better be getting back. Low tide's upon us and there's clams to be clammed. You kids get home safe now."

And like that, he was gone, disappearing into the fog like a ghost in the night.

But Jess and I were much more concerned with what he'd told us, than with the old man himself.

"We've gotta find Mike!" Jess said frantically, as she turned to me, a look of panic in her eyes.

"Are you serious?" I replied. "But we agreed to head back. Mike made his choice to stay."

"You heard the old man. There's someone else out there. We've gotta save him."

"But-" I began to say, before Jess grabbed me by the collar and interrupted.

"No buts, Tyler! These tapes found their way to you, not us. They chose you. You were the one who was meant to get us into this mess, and you are the one who's meant to get us out of it. So please, for crying out loud, put on your big boy pants, turn around, and be a hero for once in your life."

I didn't know whether to feel hurt or flattered. All I knew was that she was right. I'd never really had much of a purpose in life before finding the tapes, and in a weird way, they gave me one. So I dusted off the dried mud from my clothes, took Jess by the hand, and set off into the foggy marshland.

When we finally arrived at the wreckage of the old boat, we found the nearby burial site completely excavated, the tape's third body protruding from the ground, and a box with what presumably was the next clue lying beside it.

And not far away, just lying there in the grass...

...Was Mike. Half alive, his body caught in an old bear trap, its rusty jaws clamping down into his torso, blood pouring out everywhere.

"I found the body." He mumbled to Jess and I, as he noticed us approaching, blood dripping from his mouth.

"Mike!" Jess screamed, as she started to run towards him, before I stopped her and crouched down to help him.

But no matter how hard I tried and tried... no matter how much force I put into it... the trap wouldn't release Mike from its grip.

Eventually, I stood up and took a few steps back, knowing that my friend would soon die from his wounds, as my own blood was now pouring from my arm.

Jess and I both knelt down by his side.

"I'm sorry... For what I said." I whispered to him, as a tear rolled down my cheek.

"I'm sorry too." He replied.

"Did someone do this to you?" Jess asked.

"No." Mike replied. "I had just found the body, but couldn't see well, and accidentally stepped in the trap. But then a little while later, I did see him."

"Who?" Jess asked.

"The man from the tapes. He walked by and stood there for a minute, right where you were just standing. He looked at me for a moment, then just walked away and left me here to die."

"The man in the marsh." Jess said.

"Tell me something, Tyler." Mike began, gesturing to the body. "Is it him? Is it my dad?"

I sat there for a minute, not sure what to say, then moved the headphones from around my neck to my head, switched tape "3" for tape "4" and pressed play.

CLICK.

"If you're listening to this, you've found the third body. A widow, guilty of investing her entire life in that of another. Her husband, who, after sharing her life, her time, and her memories with, simply passed away one day.  She should have known, as we've learned from the first two bodies, that love is not forever. And investing in it, a fool's errand. When you're ready for the directions to the next bodies, switch to the fifth tape."

CLICK.

I looked at Mike as he lay there, dying in the grass, a hopeful look in his eye.

"It was him. It was your dad, Mike." I said, unable to tell him the truth, and hoping the lie would bring him some sense of closure, some sense of solace, in his final moments.

He probably knew I was lying, but nevertheless... it brought a smile to his face.

"Thank you." He mumbled, before his eyes eventually closed, and he passed on from this life.

Jess and I both began to cry our eyes out, as we sat there in the mud, our warm embrace counterpoint to the cold body that lay beside us.

"Maybe we should go back... and get help." Jess said, sniffling, a sense of defeat in her voice.

"No," I replied, wiping the tears from my face. "It's too late. We've gotta keep going. We've gotta find the bodies, and make this guy pay for what he's done."

Jess reached over and helped me wrap my plaid shirt around my arm, in an effort to clot the wound, as I stared down at the ground, still processing what had just happened.

"Mike hated this shirt." I said, unable to stop myself from letting out a laugh.

"He really did." Jess replied, fighting a tearful chuckle of her own.

That's when I remembered the wooden box that I'd seen earlier, its structure identical to the one we'd found by the first two bodies.

I picked it up and opened it, revealing a piece of paper, with nothing but the letter "A" written on it.

"Another letter. "A."" I said.

"'J" and "A"." Jess replied, "What do you think it's spelling?"

"I have no idea."

"Well, we'd better find the next one then."

As the mist began to clear, and Jess looked out at the immense stretch of marshland that still lay before us, I switched tape "4" for tape "5" and pressed play.
