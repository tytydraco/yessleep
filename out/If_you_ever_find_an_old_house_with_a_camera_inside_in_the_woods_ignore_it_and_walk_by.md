 It  all started a couple of days ago when I went for a walk in the forest  to get some fresh air. I like to go to the forests from time to time.  When I was walking I stumbled upon an old house that looked like it was  abandoned since the 90s and that was strange because I have never seen  it there before. I wanted to go inside but something was stopping me  from doing so. I had a weird pain in my chest that was increasing the  closer I got to the house. In the end, I decided to go back to my house  and maybe leave it for a later time plus it was getting late anyways. I  couldn't sleep at all, my curiosity was eating away at me from the  inside and I wasn't able to bear it any longer. In the early hours of  the morning, I got up from my bed and packed all of the things that  might be useful like a flashlight, pocket knife, etc.

I  stepped out of the house and started walking into the forest. It was a  beautiful morning, sunlight was shining through the leaves and branches  of the trees, and the birds were singing. It was like that until I saw  the house, it wasn't in the place I saw it the day before, it looked  like it moved a little bit closer. I took a deep breath and started  walking toward it. The closer I got to the house, the less and less I  heard birds and the whole forest life that was around me a moment ago.  The pain in my chest got very intense so I stopped for a moment and  thought about if I wanted to go inside but still, curiosity won over  reason. When I was right in front of the doors of the house all of the  sounds that were surrounding me a minute ago were gone. I was standing  in front of an old sign that read "Welcome Home!" and an open door to a  dark hallway. I pulled my pocket knife out of the backpack and ventured  inside. I needed to turn on my phone's flashlight because the lights  didn't work and it was really dark inside.

I  went inside and out of nowhere the temperature suddenly dropped so much  so that steam flew out of my mouth with every exhalation. Outside it  was warm and inside the house, it was freezing cold. I only peeked  inside because I didn't have any jacket or anything that would protect  me from the cold inside of this house. I looked around and saw a  staircase on the right side of the hallway, some closets, and a living  room at the end of the hallway. When I was looking around I heard  footsteps from the upper part of the house getting closer and closer. I  freaked out, rushed toward my home, and almost fell into a hole in the  ground, I was lucky that I stopped in time. I made sure that no one was  following me and stopped running but I was still walking at a brisk pace  toward the city. When I got home, ate some microwaved food, and drank a  glass of water I decided to go to my neighbor, Mike. He is my friend,  he's pretty strong and doesn't get scared much so that's why I wanted to  go with him to the house in the woods tomorrow. I told him about this  whole thing and after briefly urging him on, he soon agreed to come  together to this place the next day. Before leaving we discussed some  plans and when I got home it was getting late already. I brushed my  teeth, showered myself, and got to bed. I was constantly awoken by  nightmares because I was imagining what we might find there and every  thought was worse and more terrifying than the last. One time I wasn't  woken up by a nightmare, I heard a blood-curdling scream of a man  outside, its source was far away but the sound was still loud enough to  echo all the way to my building. I was too tired after many nightmares  and the last sleepless night so I just brushed it off as another  nightmare and fell asleep.

The  next day I heard the news, a body, or what was left of it was found a  few streets away from my house and it was unrecognizable to say at  least. It was a pile of flesh and torn-off limbs. There were bloody  footprints of shoes coming out of the forest and next to them were big  bloody footprints of something no one can recognize leading into the  forest. By looking at the footprints I could tell that it had very long  and big claws and its paw was the size of four adult human hands. It was  then that I realized that it was probably not a nightmare, I regret  that I didn't tell Mike about it I still went back to the house in the  forest after all. I went to Mike's house and told him that I am ready,  he was still packing some things so I waited for him for a while and  when he was ready we got out of his house and started walking in the  direction where I last saw the old house in the forest. We walked along  the path for about 30 minutes and we still didn't see the house. I  started recognizing the place where I last saw it and it was not there,  it just disappeared into the thin air. In the place where it was there  were full-grown trees and bushes like it was never here.

"So where is this house you were talking about?" Mike asked.

"I don't know! I swear it was here last time I have seen it!" I replied.

"Ah Peter, you got me there, I thought that all of this was real." He said with a smile and started walking away.

I  was left speechless. I thought that I was going insane and that there  never was any house here. I didn't know what to think of it, I walked  back to my house and continued my daily routine like every other day. In  the middle of the night (at around 2 or 3 AM) I woke up with a weird  feeling. Something was calling me into the forest, it wasn't saying my  name out loud or anything like that, I just felt like I had to go there.  I got up from the bed, dressed up warmly because the night was cold,  packed all of the things that I could need, and I was ready to go. When I  opened the front door of my house leading to the outside it was like  some wave hit me, a wave of a thousand voices calling my name but I  couldn't hear them, I just felt that they were calling me. I stepped  outside and immediately I started walking into the woods in a direction I  never went before. I don't know how I knew where I needed to go, it was  like I was hypnotized. I was walking in a straight line and didn't look  around, I'm not sure if I even blinked.

When  I finally reached my destination I regained my consciousness and  realized where I was. I was standing in front of an old rotting house  illuminated by the dim moonlight. The house that was messing with me  this whole time. It was like it wanted me to go inside it alone so it  didn't show itself when I wanted to go with Mike. And again this time as  I was coming closer I started feeling weird pain inside of my chest and  when I got in front of the front doors that were closed this time it  disappeared. I grabbed the door handle to open the entrance to the house  but the door slowly opened with a loud creaking noise like it was  inviting me in just when I touched it. I was going through a hall of  some sort and after going through it I ended up inside what appeared  like a living room of the house, It was all smelly and old. The  wallpaper was peeling off the wall, the wood on the floor was rotten and  the furniture fell apart when touched. All of the windows were locked  with a padlock and covered with black paint. I also noticed that there  was a lot of some kind of dust and ashes floating in the air inside the  house. I looked around to see if I can find something interesting but it  looked like there was nothing more that is out of the ordinary in this  room so I went further into the house.

There  was a really small and cramped bathroom. The bathtub in the bathroom  was full of water the temperature of which I can compare to liquid  nitrogen. There was a kitchen, some child's room, you know, regular  house rooms. There was so cold inside that some things in the house were  covered in ice or had icicles on them. After some venturing and looking  around I decided to go upstairs. Upstairs wasn't very different. There  was a small three-quarter bath, a bedroom with small old TV covered with  frost and an empty room without any furniture that had icicles all over  the ceiling so I didn't go in it because I didn't want any of them to  fall on my head. I looked at every room and didn't find anything  interesting in the upper part of the house too so there was only one  room left that I wasn't in yet, the attic.

After  some struggling, I managed to break the ice and pull out the ladder to  the attic and I hardly slipped on my way up. The attic was very big,  there were empty boxes scattered everywhere. One thing that stood out  from all this mess is that there was a single armchair with an old VHS  camera laying on it in the middle of the attic. I slowly walked over to  the camera and it looked like it was laying on that armchair for at  least 10 years. I tried to turn it on and it worked, on the camera,  there was only one 12-minute recording so I decided to watch it. It was  recorded by a man (judging by the voice) that was exploring an abandoned  house that looked identical to the one that I was in at the moment. He  looked around the house for some time and walked next to writing on a  wall that said "David" several times but he just ignored it, like it was  invisible. He walked out of the building and was walking through the  forest when the video cut and now he was inside his house I assume  searching for the source of the ticking noise that could be heard in the  background. In the video, there were writings "David" all over his  house but as the last time, he ignored them. Then the video cut again  and there was no more ticking sound, he was running down the street and  something was chasing him. I could hear heavy footsteps nearing the man  and then the video ended with the same scream of pain that woke me up at  night.

I was scared to say at  least after watching the video, I sat there for a few minutes after  deciding to go home and never go back here again but just when I was  about to leave I noticed something on the screen of the camera. There  was a big writing on the armchair saying "Mike". I couldn't see it  normally, but it was there on the camera. I immediately felt shivers  going down my spine and I rushed outside toward Mike's home. I was  running as fast as I could and finally reached his house, I started  banging on the door for him to open it but it appeared that no one was  inside. I called him and he picked up, hsaid he will be home soon, he's  coming back from a visit to his grandparents. I told him about  everything but he didn't believe me, he thought that I was pranking him  again. He said that it was late and he was too tired for this and hung  up. I tried calling his number several times after that but he didn't  pick up. I was waiting nervously on the bed for him to give any signs of  life and I finally relaxed a bit when I got a message on Discord from  him.

"I'm back" It said.

We  chatted for a bit and again I tried explaining everything to him but in  the middle of our talk, I got a message from him that terrified me to  my bones.

"Hold on, I hear ticking in my house" the message read.

That  was the last message he sent me, he didn't pick up calls, didn't  respond to my messages, nothing. The next morning knocking on my door  woke me up, it was the police. They asked me questions like "Did Mike  have any enemies" etc. After the questions, they left and I ran to  Mike's house to see what happened. It was a horrifying view. His front  door was forced open from the outside and there were clear signs of a  fight. There were police surrounding his house and Mike was also there.  His body was dismembered, he had large scratch marks on his torso and  his lower jaw was ripped off. He had a steak knife in his hand to  probably try to defend himself from whatever was attacking him. It  couldn't be done by a human, what kind of human would do this? I ran to  my house and upstairs to my room in grief and wanted to see if a  security camera on my house recorded anything but I couldn't get myself  to do that. I lied my bed staring at the ceiling fan for about an hour  and finally I gathered myself to turn on the screen and rewind the footage. 

This thing, I have never seen anything like this before. It has  two legs and arms, it's very skinny, and I can compare its skin to a  black hole, it doesn't reflect any light. It has long horns growing out  of its head, a muzzle full of moving teeth, and its eyes are big,  circular and I'm almost sure that I could see TV static in them. I  watched in horror as it broke into Mike's house and the next thing that  could be heard is his muffled screams. I stopped the video, I couldn't  watch it anymore. I stared at the screen with paused security camera  footage and then pulled the VHS camera I found inside the house in the  woods out of my backpack. I tried to destroy it but nothing worked. I  tried bricks, fire, and throwing it out of the window. Nothing. Is this  thing fucking unbreakable? I went to the forest and buried it  underground so no one would ever find it but when I came back home, it  was waiting for me on the doorstep. There was nothing I could do to get  rid of it. When I sat on the bed holding the camera in helplessness I  noticed something on the small screen. There was my name written on the  floor of my bedroom.

Now  as I am writing this I see the words "Peter" written all over my room  on the camera and I hear a clock ticking sound from the hall in front of  my room. Now the ticking stopped. I can hear something coming.
