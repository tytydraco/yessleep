After leaving my college for good, i got a new habit of checking my mail every day. Why you may ask? Well, if you don't know, after you reach 18 years, you have to do the army qualification test, so that if you are good enough, you can go to the military school for 1 year, unless you pay a big sum of money, or you have some sort of condition. When you are in college however, you are basically safe from the army for few years. But like i mentioned before, i left the college, because i just couldn't handle all the stress and negativity towards me there, so much so that i had to go to psychiatrist cause i thought that maybe something was wrong with me. So i started checking my mail every day. But after several months of checking, the recruitment season was over and i guess they simply forgot about me. Same happened with my dad surprisingly. Then again, i don't think they would even let me, cause last time i went for my checkup, i was told i was too skinny and i stutter too much, and with the baggage i have now.. let's say, i am the worst possible candidate. 

Anyway, let's get to the point, i know you don't want listen to me ramble about army and stuff. So, like i said before, i check mail whenever i can, and sometimes i get a newspaper, an electricity bill, or some junk like a brochure promoting a new circus event. But i also get mail that was supposed to be in some other mail box. My mail box is always open, because i forgot the key to it, and also because someone decided to break it open for whatever reason. There is one mail box that always has tons of mail in it, and that mail box is for apartment 47. I won't tell you what my apartment number is, but let's say, i live close to this apartment. Whenever i check my mail, i always find that box filled to the brim with bills and mail. Why was the owner of the apartment not checking their mail?

I should probably explain the layout of my complex, so i want you to use your imagination a little. It will be hard to describe, but i will try my best. Each floor has 2 doors, that lead to main halls with apartment entrances, and in one corridor can be 4 doors and in the other only 2. And it just so happens that i share the same corridor with that apartment. It was placed right next to the hall door.

The person who used to live there was a man who lived with his mother, he was 25-28, clearly old enough to live on his own. He was a bit weird and i always thought he looked like a druggie, no offence to the guy, but he had that kind of vibe. His mother would rarely come out, and i could hear arguments between both of them sometimes behind the door. Basically, they were both odd. I think they moved out cause i haven seen them anymore. The apartment was left empty.. but not for long. Cause it appears that someone lives here now, at least i think so. I haven't seen or heard them move in. No ruckus and commotion that you'd expect when someone is moving into a house. When we moved here, we had to get the couch, tv, closet, and fridge in, but they just kinda appeared, manifested into existance inside the apartment. So that picked my interest.

I have been studying the apartment for several days now, you might call this creepy, but i call this me being curious, especially with all the weird shit happening in my place recently. I asked my neighbours, which is something i don't do often, about whoever lives there. One of the neighbours next door who lived in this house before we came, mentioned that even she was unsure if apartment even had a new owner cause she haven't heard the door lock open or close. Before the guy and his mom arrived, there used to live some other elderly lady. Most of the sounds i heard coming from it were either shuffling or moving, sometimes footsteps and grunts, sometimes i could hear faint music and what sounds like dishes in the sink moving. They do not open the door, they also do not react to knocking or sounds behind the door. I tried to knock, but they didn't answer, they only went quiet. They also do not get any food delieveries to their house nor do they go to the store.. this was so confusing..

But something happened that made me never want to bother whoever lived there. After few days of me studying and watching the apartment.. something odd happened. I ran out of ketchup, so i had to go to the store to get it, along with some food for dinner. I usually eat same ol foods, like pasta with chicken in gravy, buckwheat poridge with liver, and my most favorite food of all time, pasta with bologna. After i came back with the groceries, as i was closing the hall's door i heard the door next to me open. I quickly stopped and looked at it, thinking that maybe, just maybe, whoever lived there finally decided to show themselves.. but no one came out. I don't know why, but for some reason.. i felt tempted to open it. I put my hand on the handle, thinking if what i was doing was even legal. I pushed the handle and opened the door, entering the apartment.. what i found inside was.. odd.

The apartment looked fairly normal, like a stereotypical russian one room apartment, yet no owner insight. It had a old couch, there was a square tv that was standing on a cabinet in the corner of the room, and in the other corner,  pretty old closet. There were flowers on the windowsill, but i was not sure if those were decorative plants or living ones. There was a carpet on the floor that looked kinda similar to one from my childhood, very old red carpet with ornaments on them. It felt like i traveled back in time, I don't doubt the existance of similar looking apartments in current age, but still, i felt like jumped to the past. On the wall i noticed a picture of an old lady holding a kitten with a black line in the corner of it, and few family photos, one of which had a familiar face, it featured the mother of my neighbor. Perhaps they forgot about the picture when moving out? I checked the bathroom, that was wide open, it was empty as well. I went to the kitchen, and it looked as old as the living room. It had beige wallpapers, crusty gas stove, a small table next to the window and a big fridge, the whole apartment was lit by a lamp hanging from a ceiling. The window outside was pointed at the direction of the little square outside. 

This kind of place sounds peaceful.. but something felt wrong. Why was it like this? There is no way that family lived in such old house and not consider changing anything. I get that the vibe is nostalgic, but still, you have to at least change the tv. Or did it somehow change by itself. But i lost my train of thought as i felt like something was breathing down my neck. I turned around, but no one was there. The window was closed, so it was not the wind. I started hearing creaks and strange sounds coming from the apartment, the feeling of something breathing down my neck haven't left me alone, i tried to turn around, but it almost felt like something latched onto my body. My back felt heavier, and i felt my spine become cold, my shoulders were held by something behind my back.. I already wasn't planning to stay here for too long, but now i had to run out the door in an instant. I somehow menaged to free myself and run to the door, nearly stumbling on my way out. I left the apartment and sighed with relief, but i got interrupted by the sound of the door locking behind me. 

Next day i checked the mail box one more time, and i found a small paper in it. These kinds of mail usually turn out to be an ad promoting a small business most of the time, but this time it was neither a military mail nor an ad. It was a note, a handwritten note from someone i didn't know.. but as i read it, my heart stopped. It read "I kindly ask you to leave my place alone, child. Now you've seen everything.". There was no sender name, only a number that made my heart sink.. 47. Maybe I shouldn't stick my nose where it doesn't belong..
