It all started when I landed this weird, high-paying gig online. One of those “don’t ask, don’t tell” deals—dumping construction waste at random spots in the middle of the night. The pay was insane, like, too good to pass up for a broke college kid like me. The guy who hired me was paranoid as hell, though. Never met him in person, only talked over the phone. Burner number, distorted voice, the whole sketchy package. He’d text me coordinates, I’d load up this beat-up truck he provided, and I’d haul the stuff wherever he said. No questions asked.

Most of the time, it was just broken concrete, splintered wood, that kind of thing. Dirty work, but easy enough. Until one night, maybe a month into it, I get to the drop site—an abandoned lot out past the edge of town, overgrown with weeds and lit only by my headlights. I’m unloading the usual junk when I notice something weird in the pile: a suitcase. Not some cheap plastic thing, either. It was old-school, leather, with tarnished brass latches. And it was heavy. Like, way heavier than it should’ve been for its size. I dragged it off the truck, and it hit the ground with this dull, solid thud that made my stomach twist.

I stood there for a minute, staring at it. Something felt off—way off. My gut was screaming at me to leave it alone, but my brain kept nagging: What the hell’s in there? I pulled out my phone and called the boss. His voice crackled through, low and tense. “Don’t touch it,” he said. “Don’t even think about opening it. Just dump it and go.” I pressed him a little—what was it, why was it so heavy?—but he just repeated himself, slower this time, like he was trying not to lose it. “Do. Not. Open. It.”

I didn’t. I don’t know why—maybe I was too freaked out, maybe I just didn’t want to lose the gig. I left the suitcase there in the dirt, got back in the truck, and peeled out. About twenty minutes later, as I’m driving home, my phone rings again. It’s him. I pick up, and there’s this weird beat of silence before he speaks. “You didn’t open it, did you?” he asks, and there’s something off in his tone—almost like he’s surprised I’m still on the line. “No,” I say. “I left it like you told me.” He lets out this shaky breath and says, “Good. You did good.” But here’s the thing: he didn’t sound relieved. He sounded scared. Like he’d half-expected me to say something else—or maybe not be there to answer at all. It gave me chills, but he hung up before I could ask anything.

That was the last job he ever gave me. No calls, no texts, nothing. Radio silence. I figured I’d dodged a bullet, you know? Whatever was in that suitcase, it wasn’t my problem anymore.

A couple weeks later, I’m hanging out with this senior from my old high school, Jake. We weren’t super close, but we’d grab beers sometimes and shoot the shit. I’d told him about the gig before—mostly as a funny story, leaving out the creepier details. Turns out, he’d just picked up a similar job. Same deal: good money, late nights, hauling random crap. I laughed and told him to watch out for weird suitcases. He just rolled his eyes.

Then, a few nights later, my phone rings at like 2 a.m. It’s Jake. His voice is shaky, almost whispering. “Dude,” he says, “there was a suitcase. Just like you said. In the pile I dumped tonight.” I sit up in bed, instantly wide awake. “Did you open it?” I ask. There’s this long pause, and I can hear his breathing, all ragged. “Yeah,” he finally says. “I did.”

I’m like, “Okay, what was in it?” Another pause. “Nothing,” he says. “It was empty. But… it was so heavy before I opened it, man. Like it was full of bricks or something. And the second I popped the latches—nothing. It just… got light. Like it weighed nothing at all.” I could hear the panic creeping into his voice. “I don’t know what’s going on, but something’s wrong. I feel weird. I—”

The call cut out. Not like he hung up—just dead silence. I tried calling back, but it went straight to voicemail. I texted him, no reply. The next day, I swung by his place. His roommate said he hadn’t come home. A week later, still nothing. His phone’s off, his car’s gone, and no one’s seen him since that night.

I keep thinking about that suitcase. What was in it—or what wasn’t in it? Why’d that guy sound so freaked out when he realized I hadn’t opened it? And why’d he stop contacting me after that? I don’t know if Jake’s disappearance is tied to that thing, but I can’t shake the feeling that whatever happened to him… it started the second he lifted that lid. I’m just glad I didn’t.
