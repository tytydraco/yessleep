I don’t exactly love my job, but it’s what I was put on this earth to do. Still, there are times when I hate every choice that’s led me to where I’m standing at a particular moment. 

I survived this one, obviously, which is how I’m telling you about it. But when I watched my friend die, then nearly lost my life attacking his killer, then watched the grundlemuncher catch on fire, only to see my friend come *back* to life as some sort of a fucked-up monster thing, that was already one of the most trying days on the job. [So realizing the little girl we had to save was *also* a monster](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ymt30m/im_a_private_contractor_who_kills_people_but_i/) – that was the cherry on top of my bleeding shit sundae. I can’t drink on the clock, on account of all the live ammunition, but this was one of those moments when an IV of moonshine would have been metaphorical lube on the industrial piston that life had decided to blast into my rectum.

“But *why* do we need to murder your mommy and daddy?” I pressed, squeezing the KA-BAR so hard that I thought I actually might snap it. 

Little Laney tilted her head, sending one braid cascading over her shoulder and raising her right eye above her left. “You know that knife can’t hurt me, don’t you, Dekrasi?” 

Hearing the monster girl say my name like we were old friends sent a chill straight down my spine and into my taint. I’d been afraid on the job plenty of times before; the nature of kidnap-victim recovery puts my life in constant jeopardy. But this was the first time I felt the kind of horror that comes from mixing immediate mortality with the great unknown: for a moment I was a little kid again, hiding under the bed so my older brother didn’t know I was secretly watching a movie my parents knew I was too young to see. Now, just like then, I wanted to leave but couldn’t.

Her eyes glowed as though fire was reflecting in them, but the little girl knew to stay away from the morning light. “We have less than a minute to get ready. Your dead friend needs to get over himself.”

I glanced at Data, who was heaving in the corner of the room. Blood coated his neck and shirt, but it was no longer spurting from an open wound. 

Sliding the KA-BAR back into my belt, I dove for the M4 I’d dropped on the ground. “What exactly is happening in one minute, Laney?”

She licked her lips, slurping up more of Data’s blood. “The trap you walked into has been sprung.”

I looked over at Big Mike, who jumped back to the corner, leering at the steps leading down to the second floor. “We’ll bottleneck the stairway,” he barked. “How many attackers, and how long can we hold them off?”

“You’re forgetting,” Laney interrupted, “that the other side of the building is in the shadow of the rising sun.”

A long, slow, scraping sound reverberated through the wall on the opposite side of the room. My neck tingled as I realized someone was crawling up the building outside the third-story window.

Something was trying to get in. 

slam slam slam slam

Someone else was running toward the staircase on the floor below. 

“Data!” I shouted. “That window is far enough from the sun, you need to cover us! Mike, block the stairs!”

Most people would be all fucked up from dying and coming back to life, and plenty would need to have a good cry about it. I love Data, because he had the kind of mental fortitude to get over his shit and cover our rear.

CRACK

The window shattered. I turned my head just in time to see a shadow climbing into the room.

“Aw, fuck,” Mike groaned.

I was turning back to see what had ruffled his feathers when Mike grabbed me in his gargantuan arms and tackled me. 

My ribs hit the ground and exploded in pain as the wind was knocked from my lungs. I fought the urge to panic. 

POP

A flashbang grenade exploded on the stairs, and I suddenly understood why Mike had thrown us both to the ground. Mike leapt up and aimed his gun at the smoke creeping up the stairs as I heard a man crawl along the floor near the window.

I can’t call it “calm,” because every cylinder in my mind was firing. What I felt in that moment is more accurately described as focus; I directed my mind and body only where it needed to go. My diaphragm recovered, and I turned my back on the shadow near the window, because I knew Data would die a second time before letting his friends come to harm. 

Mike peered, frozen, at the stairs, kneeling protectively over me before I scrambled into position behind him.

Nothing happened on the stairs.

Every hair on my neck stood at attention as inhuman snarling burst behind me. Something unnatural was attacking Data, but he was depending on me to cover the stairs, which were now bathed in the morning light that would kill him.

Nothing happened on the stairs.

I can handle the anxiety of high intensity, but I squirm when restless. Mike read my thoughts.

“Help Data, I’ve got the steps covered.”

I patted his shoulder once and turned around, preparing myself to see the unexpected. 

There’s no way I could have expected what I saw. Data was wrestling with a creature that looked half-man, half-shadow, and half-swamp vampire, 150% ugly and fucked up. With no lips, its full saberlike fangs were on display as it snapped at Data’s face. It had Data pinned to the ground as my friend clutched at its throat and shoulders, struggling to keep it away from his face. 

pop pop pop  

I fired three rounds into the monster’s neck and shoulder.

The thing looked up at me with beady eyes and smiled, revealing dozens of pointed, crooked teeth. Completely unfazed by my bullets, it placed a shadowy hand on Data’s neck and squeezed. 

Well, shit.

I couldn’t shoot the thing away, and it was clearly strong enough to rip my eyes and fingers out. But I’d be fucked sideways before letting Data get killed a second time, so I thought “this is it, here’s how I die,” and got ready to launch myself into Mr. Dark and Ugly. 

But he was knocked away before I could move. Something pale had flown onto his head, pitching him forward and off-balance. My breath stopped as I realized that it was little Laney, her fangs out and burrowed into his skull. The six-year-old girl had knocked Data’s attacker of off him. 

Data didn’t waste a second.

Rolling over, he slammed himself into Dark and Ugly, sending him sprawling across the room. He staggered, Laney still on his back.

Directly toward the growing sunlight.

For a moment, time stretched sideways again as my focus turned over every detail before me. 

Data looked safe-ish for the next few seconds. It didn’t sound like Big Mike was engaged with any attackers yet. If Dark and Ugly was anything like the fucker I’d thrown outside the window, he was about to turn into a fireworks show. 

That left only Laney, who may have been a vampire, but was still the person we’d been sent to protect. 

The next steps seemed obvious, but I don’t remember thinking about them. I just acted. 

I jumped toward Dark and Ugly, diving high while he went low. We passed near each other as I grabbed Laney, who was still biting his skull, and pulled. I felt a minor jolt as her fangs dislodged from his head before we crashed to the ground, rolling deeper into the shadows. 

Our briefing had said she weighed 42.18 pounds, but she felt so much lighter. 

Dark and Ugly screamed as he fell into the sunlight, but his shrieks were drowned by the pop of sudden flame as he turned into a dancing barbecue. I checked to make sure that Laney seemed okay, pushed her further out of sight, then grabbed my M4 from the ground. I stood, aimed, breathed out slowly, and hoped that bullets might at *least* knock him off-balance while his head was on fire.

pop pop pop

His head jerked back as he staggered toward the edge of the staircase, flames jumping from every square inch of his body.

I took aim once more at the top of his skull.

He pitched backward, leaned over the staircase bannister, and fell. Half a second later, a loud *crunch* hit the steps below, out of sight.

“We have to get out of here before the place goes up in flames,” Mike yelled, still gazing at the top of the stairs for an enemy that hadn’t emerged. “And these stairs are the only way out.” 

“We’ve got bigger problems than the fire,” Laney called out from behind me, her voice hollow. “The man outside the window was just a distraction.”

Slowly, the sound of footsteps came from below.

“The trick worked,” she whispered as the footsteps moved upstairs. “That’s my father, and his whole plan was to trap you. Put away your guns, they can’t [save you now](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”
