*It’s fucking freezing.*

*It’s fucking freezing.*

*It’s fucking freezing.*

I repeat to myself on loop as I wait for the bus to arrive at Mt. Prospect. I’ve endured many cold winters in the Chicago suburbs, but this was by far the coldest that I could remember. I hug my purse close to my body, as if cheap lip balm and a compact mirror could radiate warmth.

It's hard to believe that it’s already been six months since I returned to the place where I grew up. At the ripe age of 33, my life has officially come full circle.

My hands burrow into my jean pockets, seeking warmth. I pull out a cheap disposable lighter that I contemplate flicking on but I resist the urge. I have carried it with me for the past 16 years, and yet, I have never used it—not even this morning, on the coldest day of my life.

The bus finally arrives, seven minutes late. I offer the driver a half-hearted smile. In minus 25-degree temperature, those seven minutes feel like a lifetime, buddy.

As the bus fills up, everyone sits in silence, honoring the unspoken agreement that nobody actually wants to be here. This pact doesn’t last long...

In the back, an elderly lady starts to yell. At first, it seems like she’s just rambling to herself. Nothing this bus hasn’t seen before.

The lady frantically yanks on the stop cord. Her yelling turns into shrieks. Within seconds the shrieks turn into a *BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM*. This catches everyone’s attention.

The bus driver remains stoic. God bless him. The last thing we need is this bus going any slower. The lady stumbles into the aisle, asking if we hear the noise. **The knocking.**

“STOP THE BUS!!!” she screams repeatedly.

With a desperate cry, she continues to tug on the stop cord. “YOU HAVE TO STOP THE BUS! PLEASE!” she hopelessly shouts at the bus driver. Her mouth quivers with fear.

“IT’S GOING TO KILL ME!”

The woman stumbles towards the front, digging her nails into each seat cushion she passes. Other people on the bus begin to lock eyes with each other. But not her. Never her. The last thing you want is to lock eyes with a crazy person.

She howls in agony. She says the knocking is getting louder. Unbearable. She pleads... “YOU HAVE TO STOP THE BUS. I NEED TO GET OUTSIDE!!!”

The bus driver steps off the gas, monitoring the situation. The woman starts to convulse. This gets a few people’s attention, including mine.

I whip around and look her dead in the eye. That’s when I realize she’s not crazy. *Something truly terrifying is happening to her.* I don’t know what, and I certainly can’t explain it, but the look on her face did not resemble that of a deranged person. Something was haunting her.

I yell at the driver to stop and then reach for the lady’s hand. “Everything is going to be alright,” I tell her, but my voice trembles. Her face becomes translucent as veins bulge like leeches trapped inside. Her nails dig into my arm as she clenches it.

“It’s too late. Once you hear it, you only have one minute...” She tells me in a gurgly voice like she’s halfway possessed. “One minute to what?!” I ask as the bus comes to a halt.

Her nails dig deeper into my skin. Drawing blood. “One minute to what???” I repeat.

“**Get outside**,” she says with one final breath.

She collapses to the ground. I don’t let go. I know she’s gone but I can’t let her go. I squeeze her hand and try to will her back to life. Tears flood down my cheek, but there’s nothing I can do.

It’s not until the paramedics arrive that I finally let go. I watch them take her off the bus. I swear, the second her body feels the outdoor air, there’s a moment of tranquility that passes over her. Again, I can’t explain it, and I have no idea why she needed to go outside. But she finally did.

It just happened to be a half-hour too late.

\*\*\*

As soon as I get home, I grab my running shoes and take off. I need to clear my mind.

I hop the side fence of the football stadium, just like Alexis and I used to do. Back then, we’d smoke before practice. I know, stoners don’t typically run track. But hey, why should that stop us from living our best adolescent life?

After sneaking on, I walk past the Track and Field record board. There I was—Delaney Stevens, Girls’ 400-meter champ. Set records my freshman year. *Check*. Sophomore year. *Check*. Junior year. *Check*.

Don’t ask me what happened my senior year.

Next on the list was Alexis Carlson, Girls’ 1-mile champ. But more importantly, the best friend I ever had. The only person who truly understood me. We set this stadium on fire our first three years.

Again, don’t ask what happened our senior year.

I take off my jacket. It’s still fucking freezing. The news is right; this is the coldest winter we’ve had in a century.

First period. No gym. The only time the track is completely empty. My sanctuary.

I try to warm up, but I can’t focus. I can’t stop thinking about the lady on the bus *...A minute to get outside? …But only if she hears a noise?* …I don’t know. I need to focus on something else.

I dig my feet into the turf and press start on my watch…

Hitting your thirties means realizing your body is no longer indestructible. That’s why I still run. To test my limits.  As I round the first turn, I look at the time… *14.09 seconds*

I yearn for the legs of my youth. Back when I set our school’s 400-meter record. 51.26 seconds. Pre-bionic leg. Before I had a screw in my knee and an anchor in my heel. The cold doesn’t help ease the pain. I fight through it... *29.52 seconds*

I start to envision a packed stadium. My parents, if they were still here. Alexis. Coach Smith, who used to despise us. But then again, what coach enjoys finding his best runners high out of their minds during third period? You get away with a lot when you’re talented... *46.31 seconds*

Homestretch. Can I still break a minute? My lungs feel like a balloon ready to pop. My reconstructed leg is a stride away from deteriorating. I cross the finish line and stop my watch...

*59.57 seconds*. I still got it.

I catch my breath and look up for a brief second. My eyes widen as I see something strange… A kid barrels out of a classroom door like a bolt of lightning. He stumbles outside, flushed white. Gasping for air. Letting out a piercing scream.

The panicked look on his face is familiar but I shrug it off. I take off my shoes and do some light stretching. As I grab my bag to leave, I hear a voice—

“Delaney? Delaney Stevens?”

I turn around and see a man standing with a visor. A fucking visor. How lame?

“I’m in the presence of greatness! Didn’t know you moved back.”

Yeah, nobody knows. That’s the point of moving back to your hometown. You don’t boast about it. You just pray you don’t run into anyone you know. Guess my luck ran out. He smiles at me—

“Ryan Rubino. We ran together. I was a senior when you—”

Of course. I had the BIGGEST crush on you my freshman year. I don’t say that, obviously. Gotta play it cool. Which isn’t hard when you’re talking to a guy wearing a fucking visor. I interrupt him, “Yeah, I remember. You ended up playing football at Wisconsin, right?”

He nods proudly. He then tells me that he’s the new gym teacher and track coach. He says it with a giant smile. Like he’s out here saving lives. But then again, who am I to judge?

We chat for a bit. Small talk, mostly. I try to keep it that way with everyone. Commitment’s never been my friend. Before I leave he asks me why I hopped the fence. He says I could have entered through the front like everyone else. I lie and tell him it’s an old tradition.

It’s easier than telling him the truth.

\*\*\*

I knew it was just a matter of time before I ran into someone I went to school with. Buffalo Grove isn’t that big. Population of 42,794. I guess if we’re getting technical, it’s 42,792 now. I don’t think the census authorities took into account my parents passing away last month.

I walk through the snow-covered streets. A winter wonderland. Too bad I hate it here. Free rent is free rent though. Even if it’s a shitty outdated house. Guess that’s the reward you get for taking care of your sick parents. ALS took my mom, Parkinson’s my dad. Apparently, they were just an “Alzheimer’s” away from scratching off the neurodegenerative disease lottery ticket.

I ascend the steps of my childhood home. I used to think moving back wouldn’t be bad. Nostalgia and familiarity never hurt anyone. But man, nothing fun happens out here. Prior to the bus incident, the craziest thing that happened this month was the police finding a naked dude passed out in his front yard. Kudos to him. At least someone here was trying to have some fun.

When I enter my house I hear a rattling noise. I turn to my living room to see the culprit… an oxygen mask knocks against a tank. Next to the tank is a hospital bed and wheelchair—the remnants of hospice. I should probably call someone to finally pick it all up. That’s tomorrow's problem, I tell myself. For the tenth time this week.

I turn the shower on. As I strip out of my clothes, I notice a giant gash on my arm. The lady on the bus did some damage. Apparently, she’s the only octogenarian without rheumatoid arthritis. I clean the cut and hop into the shower. The warm water feels amazing. Unfortunately, the moment doesn’t last long…

I hear a light tapping on the front door. I pop my head out... Tap tap. Hopefully it’s just the Amazon guy. I run my fingers through my hair, trying to get rid of all the conditioner when— TAP TAP. I hear it again. I continue to ignore it; I’m not letting a delivery guy ruin my shower.

I let the warm water tickle my back but… OW FUCK!! The water starts to burn my skin. Piping hot. I quickly turn the water off and grab my robe.

*KNOCK KNOCK.*

Talk about one needy Amazon guy. I tighten my robe and run downstairs. I fling the door open but… **nobody is there.** No packages or anything.  I step outside to look around. Whatever, I slam the door and get ready.

Before I head to work, I pop into the grocery store. As I’m about to step inside, I turn and see a woman racing out of a salon. Mid-haircut. The highlighting foils shake loose as she screams bloody murder. The sound pierces through the shopping center. It takes me a moment to catch my breath. Shit, this cold snap is making people go crazy.

There’s other Jewel-Oscos closer but I like this one. This particular one is where Alexis and I got caught stealing a copy of Maxim. The erotica heist took place the day after Alexis told me she wasn’t into guys. I told her she was lucky; the world caters to those trying to see a pair of tits.

As I peruse down the aisles, I reach into my pant pocket and take out the disposable lighter. Just holding it comforts me. It was the last thing Alexis ever gave me. Trivial yet priceless… isn’t that the microcosm of a good friendship? As I make my way to the check-out, I pass a woman. Jayme Fisher’s mom. She gives me a dirty look. Been getting that a lot since I’ve moved back.

Probably because I killed my best friend.

\*\*\*

I finally stumble into work. A minute before noon That’s the perk about having your own consulting business; they don’t have to know you spent the morning playing hooky. The client that I’m currently working for is on the 18th floor of the Franklin Center.

To be honest, I haven’t been fully engaged in work lately. Taking six months off to care for your parents will do that to you. I sit at my desk and stare out the window. At least I have a great view of downtown. And for the most part, I do enjoy what I do. Especially since most gigs only last a few months. There’s a subtle beauty in leaving right before anyone really gets to know you.

Even though I’m supposed to be working on a marketing deck, my mind goes elsewhere. I continue to think about the lady on the bus. I mean, burying your parents is one thing. Watching someone beg for mercy before a torturous death is another.

At least after work, I have a distraction. A date with a rando that I matched with. And yes, this goes against the whole commitment-phobe thing, but I’m bored as hell and praying this guy is just looking for a casual fling. At least his ten different shirtless photos suggest it.

I arrive at Prairie House Tavern and search for a “James Heald, 37. Lawyer. But looking for a partner in crime. Let’s due process and then do each other” Jesus, I just remember those lines from his bio. I can already tell this date is going to be a dud.

At least I know all the exits here. That’s my M.O. If I know a date isn’t going well, I just pretend to go to the bathroom and book it. I arrive at the table and sit down. James Heald, Esq tells me about growing up in Skokie and how he loves the Bears. My mind is elsewhere…

I can’t get the image of the old lady out of my head. Her translucent skin. The harrowing screams. It’s been one hell of a day. As Flannel Boy continues to rattle off the Chicago Bears roster, I cover the gash on my arm with my sleeve and focus back onto the conversation.

“-- Collins?” he asks. Shit, I didn’t hear a single word just now. I perk up and confidently say “Yeah. We gotta replace him at left tackle.” Phew, I totally played that off. James looks at me like I just killed one of his six cats. He responds “No, Tom Collins. Do you want one too?” I then notice the waiter standing next to us. Yeah, this date isn’t gonna have a happy ending.

I tell James that I don’t drink anymore. Haven’t since the drunk driving accident. I don’t tell him that, of course. Although that information is just a quick Google search away. As if guys actually background check their dates. Before the drinks come I tell James I need to run to the bathroom.

I walk home with a smile. At the moment, he probably thinks I suffer from the world's worst case of IBS or that I've left him. Boys can be naive; I'd bet on the former.

I boil water and grab a bag of ramen. The hot chili one. Alexis and I used to live off of this. It wasn't until our junior year that we realized spicy foods and working out can lead to major acid reflux. You live and learn.

I grab my phone and turn on some mid-2000s emo. You know, some Taking Back Sunday. A little My Chem. Dashboard. The kind of music Alexis and I would rock out to before track meets. I grab a spatula, ready to lip-sync when—

*Tap tap.*

I turn down the music, not sure if I actually heard someone at the door.

*TAP TAP.*

My head jolts towards the back door. Wait, which side of the house is it coming from?

*TAP TAP… TAP TAP…*

Now it feels like the noise is coming from upstairs. Is it the pipes?

*KNOCK… KNOCK…*

The walls shake. Is someone in my fucking house??

The lights start to flicker. Or maybe it’s just my vision going in and out. I’m not sure. All I know is that my heart is racing. I start to see shadows dancing on the walls.

*KNOCK… KNOCK… KNOCK… KNOCK…*

Fuck. That’s not the knock of a delivery guy. I feel like I’m having an out-of-body experience. My eyes widen— the lady on the bus!

I then realize, whatever was haunting her… IS NOW HAUNTING ME!!

I book it towards the front door but I crash into the hospice bed. My whole reality is disoriented.

The knocking intensifies. The water from the stove boils over. KRSH!! The windows shatter.

I try to tune everything out. I just need to get outside. The room starts to spin. I don’t know how much time I have left but I know 60 seconds ain’t much.

All of the sudden, I feel a figure standing behind me. I don’t know what the fuck it is but it ain’t human. It breathes on the back of my neck, taunting me.

*KNOCK… KNOCK… KNOCK… KNOCK… KNOCK… KNOCK… KNOCK…*

I tumble through the living room, trying to find an escape.

*THUMP!* A fallen tree crashes into my living room. I don’t know what’s real and what’s not. As I try to dash away, I slam into the oxygen tank. Suddenly, it feels like my entire house is crushing me. The shadowy figure continues to lurk behind me. With all my might, I barrel through whatever door is in front of me, and I—

Land on a fresh pile of snow. I’m alive. I’m fucking alive.

The ice jolts me awake. I see someone shoveling snow across the street. My neighbor. I turn to him and ask if he sees it…whatever the fuck was in my house.

He shakes his head like I’m crazy.
