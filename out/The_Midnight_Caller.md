I moved into my new apartment a few months ago. It wasn’t much—just a small studio on the third floor of an old building—but it was mine. The rent was cheap, and it was close enough to work that I could walk. The first few weeks were uneventful. I settled in, bought some furniture, and started to get used to living alone for the first time in my life.

One night, I was woken up by the sound of my phone ringing. I groggily reached for it, squinting at the bright screen in the darkness. It was 2:47 AM, and the caller ID was unknown. I hesitated for a moment before answering, wondering who would be calling at this hour.

“Hello?” I mumbled, my voice thick with sleep.

For a few seconds, there was only silence on the other end. Then, just as I was about to hang up, I heard a faint whisper. It was so quiet that I almost didn’t catch it, but the words sent a shiver down my spine.

“I see you,” the voice whispered.

I sat up in bed, now fully awake. “Who is this?” I demanded, my heart pounding in my chest.

The line went dead.

I tried to tell myself it was just a prank call, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that settled over me. I double-checked that my door was locked, then climbed back into bed, pulling the covers up to my chin. Eventually, I drifted back to sleep, though it was fitful and filled with uneasy dreams.

The next night, it happened again. The same unknown number, the same whisper: “I see you.”

This time, I didn’t even respond. I hung up immediately and blocked the number. But even though I had blocked it, the calls kept coming. Every night, at exactly 2:47 AM, my phone would ring, and I would hear that same chilling whisper: “I see you.”

I started to dread the nights. I’d lie in bed, staring at my phone, waiting for the call. I tried turning my phone off, but it would somehow power back on, the screen lighting up with that dreaded unknown number. No matter what I did, I couldn’t escape it.

Then one night, the call didn’t come. I waited, tense and sleepless, but 2:47 AM passed without incident. I felt a wave of relief wash over me. Maybe it was finally over.

The next morning, I woke up feeling more rested than I had in weeks. I got up, showered, and started getting ready for work. As I was brushing my teeth, I noticed something in the bathroom mirror that made my blood run cold.

Written in the steam on the glass were the words: “I see you.”

I bolted out of the bathroom, my heart hammering in my chest. I didn’t know what to do, so I called the police. They came and searched the apartment, but they didn’t find anything. No signs of forced entry, nothing out of place. They told me it was probably just someone messing with me, but I could tell they didn’t really believe me.

After that, the calls stopped. But the feeling of being watched never went away. I started noticing things out of the corner of my eye—shadows that shouldn’t be there, movements that were too quick to catch. I started hearing faint whispers even when my phone wasn’t ringing. I tried to tell myself it was just my imagination, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

A few weeks later, I was packing to move out. I couldn’t stay there anymore—I needed to get away, to find somewhere new, somewhere safe. As I was taping up the last box, I heard my phone buzz from across the room. I froze, staring at it. It was 2:47 AM.

The screen lit up with an unknown number.
