I’ve had two nightmares about him. And now, I feel like I’m out of time. I know if I fall asleep again, he’ll take me with him. Every time I close my eyes, I see him grinning at me with those black pits he has for eyes.

It always starts the same way:

I’m walking down a dodgy street, trying to find my way back home. The only light comes from a few dim, yellow street lamps. Then, a taxi appears out of nowhere, and I flag it down. The moment I step inside, something feels wrong. The air in the car is heavy, suffocating, like I’m trapped in a box with no escape.

The driver is an older man. He is extremely skinny, with sickly yellow skin, sunken eyes, and a terrifying gaze. He has a creepy, unnatural grin plastered across his face. His hair, or what’s left of it, is thin, white, and uneven, hanging in messy clumps around his head.

When he asks, “Where are we going?” chills run down my spine. His voice is disgusting, almost inhuman. I give him my address, but instead of taking the normal route, he turns down strange streets, speeding up as he drives. I start panicking and try to open the doors, but he has locked them all. I start screaming: “Let me out, this is where I should be getting off, my family’s waiting for me, please!” But he just stares at me through the rearview mirror with a terrifying face, grinning at me with a smile that makes me want to vomit.

Eventually, the car stops. We are in an empty parking lot, surrounded by nothing. This creature doesn’t say a word. Somehow, I manage to free myself, bursting out of the taxi and running as fast as I can.

But then, I see him running behind me, though he isn’t human anymore. His body has transformed into a 10-foot-tall, emaciated creature with the skin color of rotten flesh. His grin stretches too wide, splitting his face unnaturally. All his limbs are grotesquely broken and twisted, with raw muscles and pieces of skin exposed. He is crawling toward me at an inhuman speed, faster than I can run. His eyes… God, his eyes… those deep, dark pits are locked on me. Then he catches me, his claw-like hands gripping me so hard as he rises into the air, flying with me into the sky. I can feel my body going limp.

I can’t move, can’t scream, can’t do anything but stare as he leans close to my face and whispers:

“You’ll never escape me. This is the second time you’ve dreamed of me. The third time… you won’t wake up.”

That’s when it hits me. I have dreamt of this terrifying man before. It isn’t just a nightmare. This is the same creature, and I hadn’t remembered until now.

And then, as I’m lying in bed I realize this is a dream but I feel his breath on my face. It’s hot and rancid, like he’s inches away. I know it’s a dream, but it feels so real. I can’t open my eyes. I can’t move. I’m trapped in this horrible limbo, stuck between waking up or falling deeper into the nightmare. Both feel equally terrifying.

I fight with everything I have to wake up, struggling against the invisible weight pinning me down. Finally, I break free and sit bolt upright in bed, thinking of this man, or this creature the whole entire night.

Sometimes I wake up in the middle of then night covered in sweat to his repugnant voice whispering my name. 

I can’t sleep. Not now. Not ever. Not anymore. Because if I do… he’ll come back.
