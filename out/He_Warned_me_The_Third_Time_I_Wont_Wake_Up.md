I’ve had two nightmares about him. And now, I feel like I’m out of time. I know if I fall asleep again, he’ll take me with him. Every time I close my eyes, I see him grinning at me with those black pits he has for eyes.

It always starts the same way:

I’m walking down a dodgy street, trying to find my way back home. The only light comes from a few dim, yellow street lamps. Then, a taxi appears out of nowhere, and I flag it down. The moment I step inside, something feels wrong. The air in the car is heavy, suffocating, like I’m trapped in a box with no escape.

The driver is an older man. He’s terrifyingly thin, with sickly yellow skin and sunken eyes that seem to swallow the light. He has a creepy, unnatural smile plastered across his face. His hair, or what’s left of it is thin, white, and uneven, hanging in messy clumps around his head.

When he asks, “Where are we going?” his voice sends chills down my spine. It’s wrong, disgusting, almost inhuman. I stammer out my address, but instead of taking the usual route, he veers off into strange streets I don’t recognize, speeding up with each turn.

Panic sets in. I try to open the doors, but they’re locked. My chest tightens as I scream at him, “Let me out! This is my stop! My family’s waiting for me, please!” But he doesn’t respond. He just stares at me through the rearview mirror with that awful grin, his blackened eyes drilling into mine.

The car finally screeches to a stop. We’re in an empty parking lot, surrounded by nothing but darkness. The driver doesn’t speak. Somehow, I manage to unlock the door and throw myself out, running as fast as I can.

Then I hear him behind me. He’s not human anymore.

His body has twisted into something monstrous 10 feet tall, skeletal, and emaciated, with skin the color of rotting flesh. His grin stretches unnaturally wide, splitting his face in ways it shouldn’t. His limbs are grotesquely broken, bending in impossible directions, with raw muscle and torn skin visible underneath.

He doesn’t run. He crawls, his twisted body moving at an inhuman speed, faster than I can manage. His eyes… those black, endless pits are locked on me.

He catches me. His claw-like hands grip me so tightly that I feel my ribs crack. Then, he rises into the air, taking me with him. I go limp.

I can’t move, can’t scream, can’t do anything but stare as he leans close to my face and whispers:

“You’ll never escape me. This is the second time you’ve dreamed of me. The third time… you won’t wake up.”

That’s when I remember. He’s right. I’ve dreamt of him before. It’s not just a nightmare. It’s him.

And then, as I’m lying in bed I realize this is a dream but I feel his breath on my face. It’s hot and rancid, like he’s inches away. I know it’s a dream, but it feels so real. I can’t open my eyes. I can’t move. I’m trapped in this horrible limbo, stuck between waking up or falling deeper into the nightmare. Both feel equally terrifying.

I fight with everything I have to wake up, struggling against the invisible weight pinning me down. Finally, I break free and sit bolt upright in bed.

But I can’t sleep. Not now. Not ever. Because if I do… he’ll come back.
