Don't Buy A Satanist Sacrifice Mat Off The Dark Web

A few days ago I was bored searching on the Dark Web and I was just pondering through the terrible things that you can buy on most websites. I saw many things such as specific credit card information to severed limbs. As a joke I decided to buy something that I found. I did not want to go as far as severed limbs but more something on the side of credit card information or a fake ID, I asked my friends what to buy and showed them my page. I scrolled and scrolled until my friend David told me to stop on one specific item, A (Used) Satanist Prayer and Sacrifice Mat. I was pretty hesitant at first but after some debate I gave in and purchased it.



Weirdly, It arrived just the next day despite the website not asking for any address, at the time I thought nothing of it but looking back I was blind to the fact that somehow this website knew where I lived. I called David and my other friends to come and see it. Half-an-hour later, everyone was at my house gathering around me as I held the eerie package, after about 3 minutes of just standing in silence, David demanded that I open it. I don't know why it also had a tag with my full name and address, Cieran Edins.



I stared at the tag with my personal information on it, feeling shivers down my spine as I acknowledge that this purchase was potentially the worst decision of my life. Hesitantly, I cut through the duct tape that covered the opening of the box and pulled the flaps of the box up and to the side so that what was in the box was clear to me. Rolled up like a rug, was a Satanist mat, I picked it up and unfolded it. It was red, and looked like it had been used heavily, with what looked to be candle wax melted into the fabric and a darker red-brown stain that looked like a spill or a splatter. Something wasn't right. 


We placed it on the floor and looked up how to perform a ritual on a mat, after finding out how to do the ritual we sat in the circle position that the tutorial told us to sit in, we said the ritual except the tutorial online told us to turn the lights off. We didn't. And because we didn't, the mat turned them off for us. Yes, you heard me correct, the lights flickered on, off, on and off again, they stayed like that for a while and by this time I began to realise the mistake we had make, I stopped chanting the ritual, "Hey, guys, we should probably stop this ritual now, did you see the lights flicker? We need to stop this before it gets out of hand" I tried to tell them and repeated it 2 or 3 times before something happened. 


The lights flickered on and off again and they started chanting louder, they got louder and louder until they were all shouting. All at once, they opened their eyes, their pupils were white, nothing in their eyes at all. I immediately ran out of the house and to the neighbours. I asked to come into their house and they agreed, I phoned the police and told them everything, within an hour, the house had been cleared by 6 armed police officers. Nothing in the house at all.




That was 3 days ago and they have been missing since, nothing too creepy has been happening except every night I hear the same chanting coming from my living room, but when I go to check with my pistol that I use mainly for protection, they are not there.
