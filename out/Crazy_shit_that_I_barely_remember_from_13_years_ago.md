I don’t usually post on reddit at all. But I remember something from like 13 years ago and I wanna see if I’m crazy or not. Here’s my story, when I was about 5 years old in 2012 I got double lung pneumonia, that time I remember very little of, being 18 now. Something that I only remember snippets of though, is me standing in the middle of a large rectangular room, grasping a metal pole in the middle with a glass window infront of me, looking into a room that had both my parents and a doctor inside. To my right was a door that lead somewhere. after some time, and my parents came in to take me back to my hospital room I assume, after that scene, this is where my memories stop. I can’t remember the face of the doctor or even what I was wearing. My dad told me I was unconscious for 3 days and had surgery performed on me. Prior to this 3 days of unconsciousness, I remember being rushed to the ER with fluid in my lungs and quickly passing out. I do not remember if this was after or during the time I was passed out. I cannot remember the surroundings and background of the rooms as it has been a really long time since then. 



I still remember almost nothing of the time I was in the hospital, certain things like having shots for some reason and trying to be distracted by a book to somehow make me ignore the pain (did not work). And being brought to a toy room after, I spent some time in a wheelchair because my legs were atrophied from being unconscious and not moving for 3 days (as stated before). Seriously I was tripping out during this time, looking back on it, it sounds weird. But this is a true story of mine.



But, we can start in chronological order. First I went to an urgent care because I apparently had trouble breathing (my dad carried me out of the house rather quickly). And it was discovered through an x-ray that my lungs were full/filling with fluid. I was put in an ambulance and paramedics were telling me “not to go to sleep”. But, when you’re 5 years old and it’s 12am and almost 1am and you have a NORMAL sleep schedule that’s almost impossible. Nevertheless I somehow made it barely awake from exhaustion to the hospital and I strongly remember being rushed through the hallway on a gurney, taken to a room, and then quickly passing out/being injected with sedative. Fast forward a few days I’m in the hospital room in the ICU after having surgery to get the fluid out of my lungs. I remember having to take huge pills, etc. Normal hospital stuff. Until the one memory previously described. I do remember eventually getting out but the treatments were interesting to say the least. I had an iv line in my arm and there was a ball of what looked like applesauce that connected to it. Maybe I’m dumb or something but that’s my story.



From the part I described at the top, does anyone know what happened?



Am I actually tripping out over an old memory/dream I had when I was 5 or is this something that may have actually happened? If so, what purpose would this whole setup have?
