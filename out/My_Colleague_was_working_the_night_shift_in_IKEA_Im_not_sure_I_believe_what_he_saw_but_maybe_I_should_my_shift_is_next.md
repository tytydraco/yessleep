I'm a security guard at our town's IKEA, my friend and colleague had worked the routes for years. He knew every aisle, every creak, every hum of our  massive store after hours. The hush of the empty IKEA was almost comforting—like the place was asleep, dreaming in the dark.

Until that night.

As his boots echoed across the linoleum as he rounded the corner into the grocery section in the quiet of the store.

Something caught his eye, he stopped.

One aisle—the dairy aisle—was fully lit. Cold fluorescent light pooled over neat rows of milk juggs and yogurt tubs, shining like a stage, some unopened milk jugs strewn about on the floor.

He was sure that if something like this happened he'd hear it, he was there moments ago.

The lighting was not possible. The system didn’t have a way to power only one aisle. Either the entire section lit up, or none of it did.

He swept his flashlight along the edge of the glow, the beam swallowed by the stark luminescence ahead.

And then—

A ghastly sound.

A low, rhythmic gulping and a wet, hungry sucking noise, coming from high up near the top shelf. Plastic straining, wheezing. He felt his scalp and skin crawl all over.

He lifted the flashlight and shone it into the light.

She was there.

Clinging to the upper racks, folded in on herself like a spider. Her frame was slender and wrong—too long in the limbs, torso heaving as she was draining.

A dark hood framed her head, but he could see the shape of her face—pale alabaster skin, delicate features too perfectly smooth, a small pointed chin. Her mouth was locked to a plastic milk jug, her black claws sunk deep into the collapsing sides.

Her hands and feet were pure void—matte black, as if they absorbed the light. Her hands lithe and strong, flexing in time with each horrific swallow.

He watched, rooted to the spot, as the jug imploded with a squealing death rattle, caving in tighter and tighter, like it was begging for release.

Not a single drop escaped. The milk drained into her, as though the jug’s anguish was at an end, but not soon enough.

Then she lowered it, drained flat, her claws still piercing the plastic.

And she looked at him.

Her eyes were the worst part. Black sclera—two endless pits—staring through him. At the center, green pupils glowed with a cold, unblinking hunger.

He felt his pulse hammer in his throat. He tried to step back—

And without so much as a ripple or puff of air, she was gone.

No blur. No flicker. No sound. One moment she was there, the next—she simply wasn’t.

His flashlight sputtered out.

The aisle plunged into darkness.

He stood there, heart beating so hard it was practically in his throat.

A moment later, the beam returned. The dairy section was dark again, lightless, undisturbed. Every jug lined up in perfect order, no mess, orderly jugs gleaming under the cold afterglow.

Except the one she’d taken. It was nowhere. No drips. No crushed plastic. Nothing.

His mind tried to insist he was overtired, that he was hallucinating. But he knew—with a clear, perfect certainty sharper than any fear—

Because some time later on his shift he found that same drained jug in the correct recycling bin.

He was wide awake.

He was certain, she was real, I somehow still doubt it, I still want to believe he imagined it. 
But maybe I shouldn’t.
