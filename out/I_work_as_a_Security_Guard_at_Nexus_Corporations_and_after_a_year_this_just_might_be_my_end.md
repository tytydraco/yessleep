I work as a Security Guard at Nexus Corporations and after a year, this just might be my end.



My first diary entry:



Even if I was afraid, it'd do it all over again.



My name is Jaden Hunter 24, and I work as a security guard at Nexus Corporations. It's now been an entire year of me working at Nexus Corporation. there's been a lot of stuff happening, which is why I'm reaching out to this subreddit.  



I started to work at Nexus years ago, of course, I had no idea of the things happening there. I needed the money to survive. Most importantly to help my mother with her medical bills after she beat cancer.



Let me tell you, what Nexus Corporations is hiding from all of you. 



It was the 24th of December 2017 just before Christmas arrived, at this point I was almost 3 hours into my daily night shift. As my eyes drifted over the clock, it read 1:25 AM. 



Even if I was too grown-up for it Christmas was around the corner and I was so happy, who was I kidding christmas was for everyone.



It was late, and I was beginning to feel drowsy. Usually, I’d grab a coffee, but the machine was out of order—again. 



"Not again, this stupid machine is broken"



I slapped the top of the machine lightly, of course, nothing happened. 



Despite my tiredness, I had to stay awake, even if it meant slapping myself awake. 



Usually, there wasn't a lot happening, at least from what I could tell. The security office had a fridge, in which food and drinks were stored and restocked daily for the guards. A red leather couch was set up for us right behind the office chair. A digital clock was sitting on the left side of the Table. So there wasn't a lot in the office itself other than what I just mentioned.  



There were 4 monitors, each showing different parts of the building, with only one being able to switch to different cameras. 



My eyes jolted around the monitors, but there was nothing worth my while. The fixed cameras of which there were 3, concluded the cafeteria, the main hallway, and the courtyard. 



The courtyard creeped me out the most. It was pitch black, making me wonder—was something standing there, watching me?



Because of the terrible weather conditions and thunderstorms, the courtyard would occasionally light up.



My body shifted, as I made my way over to the fridge grabbing an energy drink for myself to drink. I could've sworn out of the corner of my eyes, something was running in the hallways. But I shrugged it off, due to my drowsyness I was sure, it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. 



So I sat back down, not knowing things were about to change for the worse. I grabbed my phone, calling my best friend knowing he'd pick up the phone due to him being a night owl. 



Boredom had to be one of the worst feelings to exist. I was spinning around in small slow circles on my chair, waiting for Aiden to pick the phone up. Finally, he picked it up. 



"What's up Jaden?" 



Aiden chuckled knowing I was bored as hell.



"Oh you know the usual stuff, just sitting on my chair. checking security cameras and going on occasional security walks. Making sure everything is alright" 



By the looks of Aidens face, I could tell he was amused by me being bored.



"I'm going for a walk, and you Aiden you're coming with me"



I could tell he was amused by the idea, the way he looked into the camera was intriguing.



"Sure why not buddy, let's go for a walk" 



he said after howling like a wolf.



I rolled my eyes, grabbing my flashlight and walkie-talkie. 



"Gosh, did you have to do that?" I scoffed jokingly



"Yes obviously, someone has to talk to the moon awoo"



My hand was resting on the door handle, as I was preparing myself to walk through the creepy halls of this office building.



 I flipped the camera on my phone around, securing it on a holster on my chest. With my flashlight in one hand and my walkie-talkie clipped to my belt, I pushed open the door stepping into the dimly lit hallway.



The silence was suffocating. The usual hum of the building- the air conditioning- and the occasional creaks of old pipes felt absent. As if the entire place was holding its breath. My footsteps echoed, unnervingly loud against the tiled floor. 



Aidens voice crackled through the phone "Damn, it's quiet as hell in there" 



I forced a chuckle 



"Tell me about it, walking these halls at night always gives me the chills."



 The weak glow of my flashlight barely cut through the darkness ahead. Shadows stretched unnaturally around the walls, shifting with each movement of mine. 



Then- 



A noise.



Soft deliberate footsteps.



I froze, my pulse hammering in my ears. The sound came from the hallway ahead, just around the corner. I swallowed hard, my grip tightening around my flashlight. 



I should turn around, and head to the security office.  forget it. 



Instead, I stepped forward.



The moment I did, something in my peripheral vision moved. A blur-to fast to be human. my breath hitched, as my flashlight flickered, plunging the corridors into pure brief darkness. 



By the time the light steadied, the hallway was empty.



I stood there.



My heart is pounding. 



Aidens voice snapped me back to reality



"Yo Jaden you good? you went quiet" 



I took a shaky breath. "Yeah... Yeah, I’m fine. Probably just my imagination."



Probably.



But deep down, I knew better.



I was done, even if Christmas was just around the corner, my joy was replaced by fear and anxiety. So my feet turned me around, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was being watched. 



I broke off into a slight jog, my feet trembling as I made my way back to the office. 



"Sorry, Aiden I gotta go bye"



My hands shaking, as I was trying to hang up the call.



The atmosphere around me shifted. The shadows I once saw, stretching across walls, now made me feel terror. They weren't just a mimic of lights from the plants and vending machines. They felt alive, their shapes contorting.



The walls now felt too close, and my breath growing faster. Is this what insanity feels like? I felt lost, where are the walls always this close?  



No, I'm just tired, that's all right? Tears of sweat, rolled down my forehead as I wiped them away. my hands felt clammy. It's just the darkness, nothing more. But then again, was someone sprinting down the corridors? 



No, it can't be, I figured it was just my imagination from the lack of sleep, I was facing in recent days. 



Then I heard it.



A whisper slithered past my ear.



"What?"



I turned around, my hands subconsciously digging into my scalp, as I was terrified of what the darkness was concealing in its shadows of their abyss. Was my flashlight growing weaker each second? 



"Hide- in - the - janitors - office-"



A cold jolt shot through his veins, his pulse hammering once—then stuttering into silence.



I broke off into a sprint, my feet struggling to find their balance at first. I yanked at the door handle, fingers slipping from the sweat coating my fingers. I opened the door and shut the door behind me. I shoved a chair in front of the door. 



my trembling fingers fumbled with the master's key, slipping twice before I finally clutched it. 



The key clicked into its place, and I twisted it with shaky hands sharp snap-locked. Nothing could get in now.  



I was terrified, my hands shaking uncontrollably.  



I couldn't forget about the volume on the walkie-talkie, so I turned it all the way down. Hiding in the corner, I kept my gaze fixed on the small glass window in the door.



Then I heard it. The basement door—always creaking—opened.



Terrified screams echoed through the hall, followed by deafening gunshots that made my heart drop with each one.



"What the hell are you? Retreat!"



 a soldier shouted, and more gunshots erupted.



 "Code word: Blackout—repeat, code word: Blackout!"



Suddenly, the air was filled with nothing but the harsh sound of gunfire and a terrifying screech. I could hear soldiers gurgling, suffocating on their own blood. But then, as quickly as it began, the chaos stopped.



It left. Sprinting into the courtyard outside, moving with inhuman speed on all fours.



I could barely make it out—a gray, skeletal figure with long, spindly limbs. It was too fast, too twisted to describe.



But then it left, sprinting off into the courtyard outside with inhumane speed on its fours. I could barely make it out—a gray, skeletal figure with long, spindly limbs. It was too fast, too twisted to describe.



Even if I didn't want to, I had to leave the janitor's office and head to the security room. 



But a document piqued my interest. 



They were documenting a project, they called it project wraith.



Now it all made sense. Here is the document with only two factors written on it due to the breach: 





Project Wraith, Date 7/15/2013



Level 5, Authorized Personal only 



Subject: Operational overview - Phase II - Wraith Entity



Overview: Project Wraith has entered its next critical phase, with a focus on containment and further research referred to as the Wraith entity. This entity presents significant challenges, to standard operation and continues to defy our understanding of both physical and psychological boundaries. the following report outlines the current efforts and measurements. 



Phase 1: Containtment&Classification



task: To continue monitoring and observing the entity's behavior and to adjust containment protocols following recent close calls of breaches. 



Observation: The entity exhibits, extreme strength, agility, and unnatural speed. evading conventional methods, tracking, and immobilization. Continued research is required for better containment tactics. 



2. Behavioral Analysis:



task: to better understand the behavioral and response mechanics.



Observation: The wraith entity seems to show heightened aggression when provoked. But appears to retreat, when the conditions alter in their favor. the entity shows a high level of intelligence. Adapting to new containment measurements with disturbing speed. This warrants further investigation into its cognitive process. 



The Nexus Corporation wasn't just a friendly office building, it was somehow related to an operation about an entity being observed by the military. 



I was barely able to unlock the door. I must get out of here.



I slowly walked on the tiles, of the hallways. making sure, I wasn't tripping over the leg of a deceased cadaver of a soldier. blood and guts were scattered around the floor and walls like a sickening cruel painting project. the odor of death was suffocating me, as I was trying to hold my breath, but eventually, the weakness of my legs would get the better of me. I stumbled, tripping over a leg.  



"fuck" I whispered



I jumped to the ground, my instincts telling me to play dead.



I could hear its screech—sharp, unnatural, and far too close. My entire body locked up as I struggled to keep from passing out. My breath hitched as its steps drew near—fast yet eerily quiet.



Then, I heard it crawl.



The sound alone was petrifying. It was no longer on the floor; the ceiling was its new hunting ground. I clenched my eyes shut, mouthing a desperate prayer, begging it wouldn’t see me.



Then, a sickening crack.



Its head twisted—a full, unnatural spin.



But it didn’t see me.



Its head quickly spinning around in a full circle. It didn't see me.  



After it was gone, I crawled toward the office, every movement agonizingly slow. I never knew two minutes could feel this long.



I rose to my feet, heart hammering, every nerve in my body screaming at me to stay silent.



Then it happened.



The walkie-talkie crackled to life.



"Anyone there? Hello?"



Panic slammed into me like a freight train.



I threw myself at the door, gripping the handle with trembling fingers. My breath came in short, ragged gasps as I yanked it open and stumbled inside. With shaking hands, I twisted the lock and shoved the couch in front of the door., 



Then I saw it.



Where the couch once sat—there was a gun. Without thinking, I grabbed it, my fingers tightening around the cold metal.



My phone is dead. The walkie-talkie is silent.



Desperation is clinging to me like a moth to a flame.





The creature is screeching and banging on the door.



The food is running out, and the creature won't let loose. I charged my phone and called 911, in the meantime of them telling me they would come to rescue me, I've spent the last of my battery, writing this plead for help on this subreddit. 



December 31st, 2017: 



Am I going so crazy to the point of hearing the voice of my mother?



it felt so soothing to hear her voice, even if it was for the last time.



the door started breaking down, and I ran out of food. I feel so weak. it has been days since I last called, and no one has survived my rescue. I'm beginning to hear a second screeching noise, am I going crazy? or is the wraith entity, not the only one.



\*Even if it didn't win this\*- I cried a tear dropping down on my diary. I still have two options left. 



The entity is still trying to break down the door, it's almost getting in. 



I'm so sorry for what, I'm going to do.



But it has been days and no one survived my rescue.



God bless your souls.



My grip on the gun grows stronger. 



I'm sorry.
