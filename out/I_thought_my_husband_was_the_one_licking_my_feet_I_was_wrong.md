My husband had a foot fetish.

He even told me about it on our first date.

And despite the fact that I was never too into feet myself, I appreciated that he was upfront about it, and opened myself up to it over time.

Not on the giving side, of course. I've always just personally found feet disgusting...

...But on the receiving side.

Which worked out perfectly, because my husband's particular foot fetish, was licking toes.

Yup, really getting in there with his tongue and slobbering all over each of my toes. One by one.

Now, it took me years of exploring my husband's kink, to build up enough tolerance not to burst out laughing from the tickling sensation within 30 seconds.

And after four years of dating, and nearly ten years of marriage, I eventually became something of a pro at getting my fight licked and maintaining my composure.

In fact, I got so good at it, that whenever my husband would lick my toes, I could completely tune it out, often multitasking things like filing my nails, reading a book, and streaming a show, as he licked away. Heck, sometimes I'd even fall asleep while he did it.

Which is why, on that fateful night in 2019, when I was lying in bed in the dark, my feet dangling off the mattress, and I began to feel a tongue slither its way up and down each and every one of my toes, I could not have been less bothered.

Truth is, I probably wouldn't have even noticed that something was off, were it not for the fact that it felt as if my husband was trying a new technique. Something that he had never implemented before in the fourteen years that we had been together...

...The bite. Yes, after feeling him suck each and every one of my toes, I then proceeded to feel more intense pressure, as I felt his teeth begin to clamp down on my feet.

"Feeling adventurous?" I called out in the dark, before shaming him, as he sometimes asked me to do. "You're a naughty, naughty boy and you're gonna pay for that."

I reached over to my bedside table, opened its drawer, and removed a pair of handcuffs that he sometimes liked me to use on him after he was finished with my feet.

"Don't make me restrain you." I called out again.

But rather than play along, and flirt back from the foot of the bed as he always did, he suddenly stopped biting my feet.

"Honey?" I asked "Why'd you stop?"

But he didn't reply.

For a moment, there was only silence...

...Until suddenly, I heard my husband's cell phone ringtone go off in the bathroom.

RING. RING.

"You gonna get that?" I asked.

But he continued to remain quiet, ignoring my question.

"Fine, I'll get it." I said, as I hopped up from the bed and tiptoed through the dark, over to the bathroom, its door having been closed since I retired to the bedroom earlier that night.

As I approached it, I couldn't help but notice that light was emanating from underneath the crack between the rug and the door.

"Honey, you left the light on in the bathroom again." I called back to the bed, as I began to open the bathroom door. "I'm gonna have to punish you even more-"

But before I could finish my sentence, my jaw dropped and I began to shake...

...As I saw my husband's lifeless body just lying there in the shower, its limbs mangled, its skin pale, as whatever blood remained in it poured down the drain.

I simply froze, as my mind began to race.

If that's my husband. And he is dead. Then who the fuck was just licking feet?

I thought to turn around, and stare back into the dark bedroom. But I was too terrified to see who might be standing behind me.

So I opted to instead walk over to my husband's body, and remove his cell phone from his pocket, which was still ringing, over and over and over again.

RING. RING.

I looked down at the phone, as I held it in my hand, and saw an incoming call from an "Unknown Number."

I answered it.

"Hello?"

For a moment, there was silence...

...Until a quiet, raspy voice simply whispered back over the line.

"I'm under the bed. Want to play some more?"

Suddenly, chills ran down my spine and my body went into fight or flight, as my heart began racing and I began to hyperventilate.

Not knowing what else to do, I gathered myself and in a single motion, turned around, darted into the bedroom and ran for the hallway, as I tried to slam the door behind me.

But just before I was able to close it, I saw what looked like the silhouette of a man crawl out and block it from shutting, as he writhed on the ground like an insect.

And as I pushed and pushed, trying to keep whoever or whatever was in my bedroom from getting out, I saw his body wriggle a few inches more into the hallway and suddenly felt...

...His tongue lick a single one of my toes.

"Aaaaaaaargh!!"

I screamed at the top of my lungs, before stumbling back, turning around and running down the stairs, as I saw whoever or whatever it was chase after me on his hands and knees.

SLAM.

I stood there, outside my house, leaning against the door, as my body shook and tears ran down my eyes, before eventually willing myself to run to my car.

As I backed out of my driveway and peeled off down the street, I looked back at the door, only to find that he never opened it, for some reason choosing not to chase after me.

Thirty minutes later, I was at the police station, reporting what had happened.

And an hour after that, the cops were combing my house.

But the strange figure who had killed my husband and licked my feet...

...Was gone.

Five years later, I still can't fall asleep at night unless I'm under the covers, for fear of feeling a tongue lick my toes.

And while I haven't stopped mourning my husband, if I ever date again, I think it's fair to say I could never date someone with a foot fetish again.

I've tried to move past what happened.

Tried to move past the shocking events of that fateful night.

But whenever I tell someone my story and they bring up the urban legend of "The Licked Hand," I tell them, it's no legend at all...

...And it licks feet too.
