Gúnnar is my 6 month old german shepard and is just shy of 30kg. Every where I go with him without fail, there is always someone who tells me how important it is to have him socialised as German Shepards can become dangerous, even the vet every single time pushes to ensure I train even the slightest sign of aggression out of him earlybut following this, I actually don't care, but I digress. On with the story.

Early this evening just as the sun was beginning to set, I was getting something from my car parked on the street out the front of my home. 

My eldest son who is 16 but as he was a premmie all those years ago and having related health issues due to that, is only around 5"2 and barely 50kg with not an ounce of muscle on him, had come out with Gúnnar as he was taking him for a walk. 

As I was walking back towards the house and my son had crossed the road, I noticed a man heading in the same direction as my son. No big deal you would think they're just someone walking by right? Except he failed to notice me standing at my front gate, said something I couldn't make out, and right before my eyes I see this man speed up almost to a run and slide his hood over his head as he was quickly approaching my son. A nightmare for any parent and a danger you would never expect only 4 houses from your own. 

As useless as I am I froze (please don't come at me, I hate myself enough but we cannot control a fear response no matter how much we wish we can) I watched on with a dread I've never felt, the moment the guy slides his hood up over his head and sped up with intent I just knew that his intentions were to harm my son, who was oblivious to his surroundings fiddling with his phone with earphones in, as I'm guessing trying to find the right song to match his walk. 

Right as the man was within arms reach of my son and his body language made it blatantly obvious he was going to in the very least, grab my son as he began reaching out his arm the goodest boy Gúnnar swung around from in front of my son to inbetween he and the man and let out a bark I wasn't aware a puppy could make. Gúnnar began towards the man barking and growling as the man hadn't stopped with his first bark. I watched frozen with horror when my dog then put all his weight into pulling my son further away and getting himself closer to the man who decided last second not to take on the dog guarding my son.

The man then flicked his hood back down and proceeded to continue on his path after stepping back and away from my son, yelling back at my son to get that dog under control.

Finally my feet unfroze and I jumped in my car following my son and the dog around the block until they got home, just to make sure the guy didn'tdouble back or come out from another street to have another go.

So please, never let your guard down no matter how close to home you are or even if the sun is still out, and always be aware of your surroundings. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that, that man intended on harming my son and had it not been for the goodest boy Gúnnar this would have played out very, horrifingly different.
