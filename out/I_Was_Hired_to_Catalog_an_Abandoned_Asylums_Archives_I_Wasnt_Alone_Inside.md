> “The door slammed shut behind me, but it wasn’t the wind. It was her. And she didn’t like being forgotten.”



I’m an archivist by trade, a contract worker who digitizes old medical records for hospitals and psychiatric facilities. I’ve worked in some grim places—but nothing like the St. Perdita Asylum.

They said the building was cleared. No electricity. No security. Just mold, rats, and dust.

They lied.

In the basement, I found sealed files about a "Condition 13", patients with unexplainable symptoms—levitation, tongues no one could translate, eyes burnt out but no pain registered.

But worse than the files were the tapes.

The last one wasn’t labeled. It showed a mass ritual in the hydrotherapy room—patients and staff alike chanting in blood, summoning “The Whispering One.”

Then the screaming started. Then the tape cut out.

Now something follows me in the halls. Shadows move wrong. Doors lock when I pass. I wake up hours later in rooms I didn’t enter. And someone… something… is whispering from the vents.

I think the cult never left. I think they brought something through.
And it wants to use me next.

The glowing footprints didn’t last long—maybe ten seconds before they sizzled out like someone pouring water on fire. I stood frozen, clutching my lantern like it was going to protect me from whatever that was. The air had changed. Thick. Wet. Like being swallowed alive.

I didn’t sleep that night. I stayed in my van outside the asylum, doors locked, eyes glued to the entrance.

The next morning, I told myself it was stress. Isolation. Suggestibility. All the things I’d read about when I was younger, back when I believed every haunting could be explained by science.

I went back in.

Day Two started normal enough. I picked up where I left off—boxes of files, mostly dated 1976 through 1979. But I noticed something. Every patient labeled “Condition 13”? They vanished off the books after May 1st, 1979. No discharge dates. No death certificates. Just… gone.

And their files? Burnt around the edges. All of them.

By noon, the air turned bitter cold. My breath fogged in front of me, even though the sun was blazing outside. Then I heard the first knock.

Three taps. Behind the locked records room door.

I froze. It wasn’t the wind. The building was dead silent.

Another three knocks. Then a voice.

A girl’s voice.

> “Come see the water.”



I grabbed my stuff, backed into the hallway—and realized something horrifying.

The hallway was different. There were no records rooms here. No old office. Just a long tiled corridor I’d never seen before. At the end was a half-open steel door, and beyond it: dripping sounds. Splashing. A faint humming. A lullaby?

I should have run.
Instead, I walked toward it.

The hydrotherapy wing had been sealed. Collapsed, they said. But the door opened like it had just been oiled. Inside was the tub. The same one from the tape. Metal. Stained. Empty.

Until I blinked.

And then she was there.

The girl. The one from the footage. Eyes wide open. Skin blistered and purple like she’d been drowned and reanimated. Hair floating around her head—except the water was still.

She opened her mouth, and dozens of voices poured out. Children. Men. Screams. Animal noises. Static.

Then one voice—mine—whispered back at me:

> “You already let it in.”



I ran. Tripped. Crawled. I didn’t stop until I was outside, lungs burning, stomach retching. I didn’t even take the tapes.

But something followed me home.

I hear the knocks at 3:13 AM. Every night now.

I see wet footprints in my apartment.

And the water in my bathtub?
It moves when I’m not near it.
