I am a linguistics professor that lives in Atlanta, I usually spend my time reading books on the local library, I mostly read old literature to kind of test myself on how good I am on translating some old texts. A few days ago while I was searching for a book for my studies, a book caught my eye it had no name and was in a slightly torn leather tome, I brought it home. It looked like it was dipped in water and dried the pages were yellow and crunchy, some words were hard to read and some pages of it was torn away. It was a diary belonging to someone named William L. It dated back to 86, 1886. Language on the diary was obviously dated and different from the English we use today but I was able to read it, well the readable parts anyways. Most of the diary was about his and his family’s life he had 2 daughters named Mary and Susan and a son named Jack, he was a fisherman living in a cabin near the shores of the Pacific Ocean, he mentioned how he misses his wife a couple times I’m not sure what happened to her but I think she died giving birth to Susan, he said it’s been three years since she’s gone and Susan was three years old too. The diary was not daily sometimes it skipped days, weeks and even a month but like I said it was mostly normal... Until the last pages of it and these pages are the reason why I’m posting this here it really disturbed me and I feel like people should read it too. And i have a question to the readers that lives in Atlanta have you ever seen her? I’m just going to start writing what it says on the diary now without interruption.

 

OCT 31 1887

 

Its night now, I heard that humming again it’s still coming from the ocean and its closer now.

 

 

NOV 3 1887

 

She got Susan, this morning I woke up to Susan screaming and that fucking humming closer and louder than ever I ran out to save Susan but when I saw her I was just stunned and I couldn’t do anything. She had green skin and long black hair, when I got out of the house she already had Susan on her back she turned her head to me, her eyes were white and shiny but there was no life in them, they were like two little candles in a pitch black night. Then she jumped in to the water with Susan, I was still terrified I couldn’t move after all this was over I was still on the threshold of the door I came back to myself when Jack bumped in to me. I’m not sure what that thing was but we will be ready for her when she comes back.

 

 

NOV 7 1887

 

Her humming still continues at night me and Jack take turns keeping a lookout we never saw it again after she got Susan but her humming still creeping up at night keeps us at edge. Jack is angry at her, I told him to stay calm but his hatred is too much to stay calm it seems, he says if he sees her again he will ‘’kill it’’. Mary locked herself in her room and didn’t talked to us since Susan got captured at least she still eats but I’m still worried about her.

 

 

NOV 12 1887

 

I stopped fishing after that accident we all are terrified to go near the shore, whenever we hear her humming me and Jake go outside to check if she’s back but we didn’t see her again yet, the food is running out so I’m planning to send Jack to the city to get some supplies tomorrow.

 

 

NOV 13 1887

 

I sent Jack to get some supplies it seems like I’m the only one on the lookout this night. Mary is still in her room. She talked to me today, she asked me if we can leave the cabin and go live in the city…                     I told her no.

 

 

NOV 14 1887

 

Why? Why did she go near her it was like she was under a witchcraft or something I yelled at her, told her not to go, she did it anyway and it’s my fault why the fuck did I fell asleep?

I took a look at her again her fingers were long as far as I could see she wore something like what Inuit people wear and her hand had webbings like a duck her face looked like anything but human.

Jack is back he’s angrier now he bought a new rifle and some ammunition for himself he says its "our best option for hunting that fucker” it is a double barreled shotgun.

 

 

NOV 26 1887

 

Her humming is back she’s been silent for a while Jack wasn’t happy about it he’s really dedicated to face her and avenge her sisters. I’m telling him to be careful, don’t let the demons get in to your head but he’s weirdly obsessed over her. I hope he acts calm when he sees her.

 

 

NOV 27 1887

 

Yesterday on my night watch I saw her eyes on the shore again... There is nothing beyond those white dots but weirdly I was like hypnotized when I locked eyes with her I don’t know how long we looked at each other last I remember it was pitch black but when I heard the gunshots from Jacks shotgun it was almost sunrise. Jack shoot at her and she disappeared in to the waters Jack tried to go after her to the sea but I grabbed him from his shoulder and pulled him back and told him what I told him over and over again, again don’t let the demons go in to your head.

 

 

NOV 2- ----

 

Jack went after her I don’t know what happened at his night watch but I woke up to the sounds of shotgun blasts I quickly got out of the house and I started hearing her humming it was very loud almost enough to deafen someone Jack was standing on the shoreline he dropped his shotgun after he emptied it once more to her. This was the only time I saw her in the daylight, she was standing upright in the sea and she was looking directly at Jack with those white dots of hers. I was stunned by the humming sounds but quickly got my senses back and tried to sprint at Jack, But I was too late Jack had walked a little bit into the waters then dropped to his knees while she disappeared in to the waters and quickly reappeared near him she hold his shoulders and dragged him in to the sea with her. Her humming was gone. I grabbed Jacks shotgun and went back in to the cabin.

 

 

 

I have been begging her to come and take me too for a few days, at night I’m just standing in the ice cold waters yelling her to come get me too. Her humming is gone she’s nowhere to be seen I don’t think she’s coming back for me. I think she just wanted to torture me for the things I had done there’s almost no food left the waters stopped running because of the cold and I’ve been drinking the beer we had on the storage. If she’s not taking me I’m going to her.

 

 

 

 

I couldn’t do it I guess I’m not the strong man I thought I was I’m just an old man who can’t even protect his family and still scared of the demons of the past we could have left this house get back in to the city but no. This place was way safer in my eyes than the city even with that thing around. And I’m still not thinking about going back to the city I’m still terrified and I’m too old to start from scratch. At least I have Jacks shotgun with me.
