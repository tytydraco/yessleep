From what I’m told, it happens most often on moonless nights, when the cool wind combs the blades of grass with a mother’s touch. Every time it happens, the townsfolk gather at the edges of the field, holding their breath, eyes focusing ahead, muscles tensing in the subtle throes of anticipation—the tightening of lips, the clenching of jaws, the flexing of fingers. Those who are there when it starts say you can *feel* the shift, like a frog thrashing about in their stomachs. Then, slowly, it begins to happen. 

First, loose blades of grass rise gently from the field and hang, suspended, lingering, scattered through the night sky like green, earthy stars. Next come the fireflies in droves, swarms, spilling out from the darkness of the trees as if they had a duty to light the field for the onlookers. Next come the creatures. 

Great deer with massive antlers step unflinchingly out from the wood. Slowly, they lift. They bound through the night sky with effortless poise, illuminated in silhouette by the fireflies and perfectly star-studded sky. Birds enter the field—cardinals, blue jays, red-breasted robins—and take flight without so much as a ruffling of feathers. Squirrels swim effortlessly through the black. On some nights, a wolf pads casually among the prey he normally consumes. The prey shows no fear, and the wolf no hunger. 

The field drew the attention of the townsfolk the same way a black hole absorbs everything in its radius. The locals swear that the air seems filled with music when it happens—a haunting melody that seems to sound slightly different to everyone. 

The tailor says it sounds like the snare of a drum; the innkeeper swears it’s a lute; the minister is certain that it is the drone of a church organ and heralds it as a miracle from God. 

The truth is, nobody knows how to explain the field. The religious claim it surely must *be* God. The atheists are convinced it is some sort of gravitational distortion, a wobble in the physics of the universe that we don’t quite understand yet. The spiritual call it magic. Some simply think it is the earth, or mother nature, delighting in her creation. 

The one thing everybody agreed on, however, was the *rules.* Most everybody in the town agree upon these rules, and are eager to tell any out-of-town stranger that asks:

Rule one: the field keeps its own secret. Anybody trying to document the phenomena, whether it be photograph or even writing, will find themselves with blank paper and empty film.

Rule two: the field protects. Do not attempt to harm any creature within the field. 

Rule three: no human can enter the field. 

As a direct result of rule number one, most everybody outside the village who heard of the field thought all the townsfolk were touched in the head. Many were of the opinion that this was some sort of mass hysteria or hallucination. The more suspicious even thought witchcraft--some form of trickery. But each and every long-standing member of the village swears the truth, as did their grandparents, and even great-grandparents. Each tells the same story, reciting the same rules. In my belief there are only two options—it is an extended, multigenerational hoax—or, just maybe (hopefully), they’re all telling the truth.

Rule two was discovered long ago, by the great-grandfather of the blacksmith, who got the idea to try and use the floating deer as target practice. As the story goes, he took careful aim with his musket, and when he pulled the trigger, the bullet shot forth until it reached the very edge of the field. It stopped dead in its path. For a brief moment, it merely hovered, before shooting back the opposite way and passing clean through the man’s skull, killing him instantaneously. The field protects. Do not try to harm the creatures of the field. 

Rule three is the most ambiguous of the three rules. Nobody who has entered the field has ever been visibly harmed; however, nobody who has entered the field has ever returned. The townsfolk describe the barrier of the field as a one-way door—they do not mourn those who go into the field, nor do they celebrate them. Any human that steps into the field will lift from the earth, same as all the other creatures. The difference is that the humans will never touch the ground again. While all the creatures of the field seem to have an innate sense of how to maneuver within it, humans seem to lack that instinct—they simply rise up into the black, until they are one with the stars. Very few of the people have witnessed this phenomenon, but those who have described the people who enter the field as those with nothing to lose. The mother who had lost her child; the carpenter whose arm had been shredded by a saw blade; the husband mourning the premature death of his wife. They enter the field with the knowledge that they will never return, and once they enter, onlookers describe them as radiating a sense of wonder. They do not seem afraid as they lift from the grassy carpet. Their eyes reflect a kaleidoscope of color—the stress and sorrow in their faces melt away into a sense of awe, enchantment. Some swear that they can see their lips moving, as if those inside the field are talking or singing, but no noise escapes from the field except the aching sense of music that appears differently to everyone. 

My mother is gone now. I have nothing to lose anymore.

She told me tales of the field when I was very young. I remember her sitting on her lap as she played piano, sometimes placing my tiny hands over hers and feeling her fingers, far more nimble than mine, depressing the keys to form melodies that tickled my ears with awe. I would ask her questions, as any child would, about what *she* was like as a child. What her mother was like—the grandmother I had never met. With her calm green eyes and a patient smile, she would speak of the field. She would speak of what the music sounded like to her—the gentle melody of a grand piano—and how she would hold her mother’s hand as she watched the creatures fly in their beautiful, haunting dance through the darkness of the night sky. It was her opinion that the field was magic that we would never understand, a sort of beauty that we were lucky to watch, but could never truly be a part of. The field was nature. The field was mystery. The field was proof that no matter how far humans traveled, no matter the greatness of our technology and machines, there were parts of the earth we could simply never comprehend. 

I have known pain, love, grief, joy, anger, bewilderment. I have explored the world and answered many of the questions I had as a small child. There is one question that remains. What is inside the field? I feel that my whole life has led to this moment, to this night. 

Tonight will be a new moon. The sky grows dark. A gentle breeze is blowing from the north. It rained yesterday, and the air still smells like fresh earth and mist. As the sun fades from the sky, we all begin to hear it. The music has started. For me, it sounds like a distant piano, playing a hauntingly familiar melody that I cannot quite place. 

I see the swarms of fireflies lighting up the field; the deer have begun to bound. The tales were all true. It seems like some sort of ethereal dance, the faint music swells and a crescendo of fireflies and birds swarm in an arc of light and color through the night sky. The townsfolk gather in a crowd some length away from the field, but nobody seems to notice when I move forward. 

The field has an electric energy, a weight that calls to me, like a black hole sucking me in. My final question will soon be answered. I hesitantly reach a hand out to the field's edge, and as soon as my fingers touch the border, I feel the density of the field sucking me forward. My mind was made up for me as soon as I brushed the surface of the field.

The music swells in my ears, loud and clear, but it is not just a piano anymore. It is also banjo, organ, flute, drums, filling my head and spirit with an indescribable energy. My feet leave the ground, and I begin to rise.

The creatures are not simple forest animals any longer. The deer’s eyes multiply, and their head splits in a vertical mouth, lined with razor teeth; its tail elongates, covered in carapace-like protrusions—almost like a centipede has grown from where its stub used to be—curling and waving behind it with an eerie weightlessness. The fireflies are now large glowing balls of indiscriminate light in various colors—red, blue, green, yellow, purple—a kaleidoscope of brilliant light illuminating the sky. The birds have sprouted multiple sets of wings, and they vibrate and thrum like those of a bee; they seem much bigger now, and their talons glint like the edge of a newly forged knife. There is a wolf tonight. It is the size of a great lion, with a silvery mane that looks wiry and almost sharp, like touching it will cut flesh. The pupils of its eyes are nonexistent, what used to be eyes are gaping black holes. The wolf’s head is turned in my direction. 

“Welcome,” it says. A cicada-like buzzing fills my ears, drowning the music.

I look down at the townsfolk. They look like fleshy puppets, their faces smooth and blank. Their human form appears alien to me now. Their bodies seem twisted and unnatural, like their bones were snapped into place, and their flesh was clumsily stapled on by a new artist. 

I continue to rise, staring hungrily at the creations. Around me, watching their glittering legs and carapaces twist effortlessly in the gravity-less sky. They are beautiful.
