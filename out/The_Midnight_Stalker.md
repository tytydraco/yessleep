I did not believe in ghosts, spirits, or the supernatural. Well, not until I had experienced it. Let me get this straight.

I had not been a fan of the horror genre. I do not know why, but these movies are not my cup of tea. I remember watching The Conjuring Part 1, and I also remember how it traumatized me for two weeks. Since childhood, I have always been afraid of the dark. But yeah, I must confess, though I hate watching horror movies, I love reading about them. If you check out my browser history, you would learn that Creepypasta.com is a website where I spend most of my time, reading stories about urban legends.

I have a friend with whom I have been close since childhood. Her name is Jessica. Well, here is a quick introduction—

Jessica and I have been friends since childhood. We go to the same school and are in the same class. We have many things in common. We both love to dance, listen to music, and play an instrument. She is more into the guitar, and I am a pianist. If there is one thing I hate about her, it’s that she is a hardcore horror fan. But that’s not the reason why I hate her. I hate her because she mocks me for not being a big fan of horror. She’s watched the entire Conjuring universe. Okay, now enough introduction.

This happened last year on Halloween. My parents were out of town for some business work, and I was alone at home. With nothing to do, I decided to call over Jessica for a sleepover, and believe it or not, she agreed.

It was 9:30 on the wall clock when I heard a doorbell. I ran for the door, and there stood my close friend, Jessica Jones, wearing the same jeans and shirt she had worn on my previous birthday.

“Hmm, let’s watch a horror movie. Don’t worry, you will have fun,” Jessica insisted.

I had no other option, so I agreed. She turned on the television after turning off the lights and closing the curtains. Then she started Netflix, logged in, and browsed for a horror movie. After a few moments, we found The Conjuring 2. Well, it was the only film left for Jessica to watch to complete The Conjuring universe.

I tried not to jump too much when the jumpscares arrived. It was 12:30 a.m. when the movie ended. I must confess, it was not that bad. But yeah, there was a problem. Sleep was miles away from me, so we decided to stay up.

“Hey, can you unlock your phone and give it to me?” Jessica asked.

At first, I was confused, but then I thought maybe she wanted to click some pictures. That’s what girls do the most. So, I handed it over to her and went to the bathroom.

When I came back, I heard typing noises coming from my phone. Quickly, I snatched the phone from her.

To my astonishment, I saw that Jessica had texted I know what you did to a random number.

“Why did you do this?” I exclaimed.

She laughed and said, “Just wait and watch.”

We just waited. Approximately half an hour later, we went to sleep.

At around 3 a.m., my phone buzzed with a text, which was a reply from the person. He had written:

“I also know what you did. Look outside your window.”

A chill ran down my spine. I was flabbergasted. What did he mean? Jessica ran for the window. She removed the curtains and stood in fear.

In the dim streetlight, I could see a dark figure with glowing eyes staring at us.

Frightened by the sight, both of us stumbled back, our breaths caught in our throats. We ran to the living room and locked ourselves inside. The dim glow of my phone lit up the room as it buzzed again.

This time, the message read—

“I’m already inside.”

A shadow fell across the hallway as the sound of slow, deliberate footsteps echoed toward us. Jessica clutched my arm, her trembling hand icy cold.

Suddenly, the lights flickered off, plunging us into complete darkness.

The sound of the door creaking open sent chills down my spine. A low, raspy whisper emerged from the darkness:

“Why didn’t you lock it sooner?”
