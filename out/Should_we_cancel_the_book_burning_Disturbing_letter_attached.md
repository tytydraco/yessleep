**The following was leaked anonymously to my church’s email list. I’m kind of freaking the fuck out. I’m sharing here anonymously in case shit goes down. As of now, I’m still probably going to attend, but I sure as hell won’t be bringing anything to burn.**

*Gentlemen,*

*While I’m looking forward to Sunday’s event as much as anyone, I felt compelled to share a rather disturbing letter I received in the mail yesterday. Normally, I’d ignore such a warning as heretical, pure fiction at best, but something about the writer’s warning gave me pause.*

*If I’m to be honest, I haven’t slept well since reading it, and I’ve been dreaming of fire. Please see for yourselves, and we can put it to a vote on Saturday prior to the event. I trust each and every one of you to exercise your full discretion in this matter.*

*In the meantime, I’ll continue to collect relevant works from parishioners interested in cleansing them from this Earth.*

*For reasons that should become obvious, Mr. Wallis is not included in this email.*

*Best,*

*Rev. Thomas Winslow*

Dear Reverend Winslow,

I’m an old woman now, but that doesn’t mean I’m senile or a liar. I still keep my own house, drive to the grocery store and back, and keep up with a few old acquaintances. Mostly, though, I read. I’ve always loved good old fashioned stories, the pulpier the better.

I still remember my father taking a belt to me when he caught me with a pair of Nancy Drew novels when I was nine. He didn’t approve much of any book, unless it was the Bible. I had thought maybe, fathers like mine were a relic of the past.

But then I read in the news today about a library getting its funding pulled just down the street, and another one about an upcoming book burning in *your* church parking lot.

Now normally, I wouldn’t be fool enough to try to talk a preacher out of a book burning. You’ve got your convictions, and I don’t suppose much I say is too likely to change them. But in this case, you might want to listen.

When I was ten, I Iived in a little town called Sutherland not too far from here, though you won’t find it on any map anymore. My daddy raised cattle, and anyone in the county would tell you he was better with steers than people. He was a religious man, like most were in those days, but he mostly kept it to himself. And I suppose he would have continued on doing that if not for one day when a stranger came to town.

The stranger called himself Mr. Samuels, and he announced himself right in the town square as church got out on Sunday. He was an old, bent little man with a bald head and a neat white beard. He was yelling all sort of nonsense about filth and obscenity, and I suppose we might not have paid him much heed except that he held up a marvelous prop: a book larger than any I’d ever seen before, old and fraying at the bindings.

“What you see here,” he said. “Is a book I pray to god you’ve never heard of before this very moment. Now, friends, I don’t speak Ancient Egyptian so you’ll forgive me if my translation is a little off, but the title reads something like ‘Prophesies of the Serpent Gods,’ a truly foul piece of literature full of threats from an ancient cult who stood dead opposed to our Christian forefathers, a cult who worshiped none other than the very snake that tempted Eve and brought wickedness into all our hearts.”

I noticed now that his hands were gloved, that he was careful not to touch the book with his bare flesh.

“Friends, I found this book in no other place than your local library, right next to a dozen other tomes, none quite as evil, but all full of plenty of blasphemy,” he shouted. “Now, I’ve been to a few other towns all up and down the Rio Grande, and I can tell you that the devil is alive and well and taking a stroll through Texas. Now I can’t tell you if it was him who put that book on that shelf or just one of his servants, but I do know that it has to go. It has to go now.”

I could tell the crowd around me was getting riled up. It was a painfully hot day, and normally people would have scattered to the shade, but not today. No, they were listening, completely rapt, fanning themselves with their hats, and muttering their agreement.

Finally, the man walked to the center of the square and placed the book down in the dirt.

“There’s but one thing to do,” he said. “And that’s to burn it. But please, friends, please. Don’t let it burn alone. For this is merely the worst offender. So I’m begging you. Go to your houses. Wives, look under your mattresses. Find those filthy books and magazines you’ve been ignoring. Men, raid your wives’ shelves and take those novels, you know the ones, the ones with big creases running down the covers, ‘cause they’re always flipping to page 112 where things get juicy. Because this here, it’s not just a book. It’s the start of a pile. Let’s show god a real apology here tonight. Let’s burn away some sin!”

Well, wouldn’t you know it, they sure took the bait. The crowd dispersed, practically sprinting back to their houses to gather their newly-identified smut.

The next thing you know, we were back in the living room, my father ranting about our sinful ways, piling up a most particular stack of books. First there was an old textbook from my dad’s high school days, *Anatomy and Physiology*, and then a copy of *Gone With the Wind* that had belonged to my mother before she dies\*,\* and a dozen others. I can’t say there was much rhyme or reason to anything he’d chosen.

Then finally, he turned to me and told me to bring whatever filth I’d hidden in my closet. Indeed, he’d already taken all of my Nancy Drew books, but I’d hidden a copy of *To Kill a Mockingbird* he didn’t know about.

“Make me look for whatever you’ve got in there and you’ll be sorry,” he said, and his eyes were pure murder. “You’re gonna fetch it yourself. And then you’ll bring it to the square with me and pitch it into the pile.” And I was so afraid of him I did it without him asking twice.

By the time we got back to the square, storm clouds had begun to gather, and the town looked dark as dusk. There wasn’t a bit of rain, but a hot wind was blowing, and from time to time we saw lightning illuminate the sky to the north. In the center of the town lay a pile of books you wouldn’t believe. Later, I’d learn that a few men had locked Mr. Lewis, the town librarian, in a broom closet and emptied out half the shelves.

An angry crowd circled the pile and was throwing in book after book. Truth be told, things had gone well past the point of logic. I saw a friend from school toss in a copy of *The Little Engine that Could*. Some of the moms were even tossing in old cookbooks. Anything to make the pile bigger.

My dad pushed to the front of the crowd as the Mr. Samuels hopped to the top of a milk crate and began to speak.

“My goodness, you’ve delivered!” he shouted happily. “God be praised, we light a candle in your name and bless this holy flame!”

My dad threw in his armload of books, then gestured for me to do the same. I looked down at my copy of *To Kill a Mockingbird.* I’d checked it out from the school library and loved it so much I pretended it was lost, keeping it in my closet all year.

“No,” I said after a few seconds. “Not this one.”

My father looked at me incredulous, he bent down and whispered. “You’re gonna shame me in front of the whole town. Now toss it in.”

“No,” I said, tears in my eyes. “I won’t.”

My father reached forward, trying to grab it from me. Mr. Samuels had noticed now and looked over at us, a disapproving look on his face.

“Now, now,” he said. “We can’t force virtue on her, can we father? Go on, girl. Do as your father commands you.”

In the meantime, the candle he’d lit was beginning to drip wax, its flame fluttering in the wind.

“No,” I said again, retreating into the crowd, my arms locked around the novel. The people backed away from me as if I were infected with some terrible disease. Mr. Samuels looked nervously at his candle.

“Now!” he shouted at me, suddenly furious, but I only held on tighter.

Finally he shook his head, muttering, “there’s always one.”

And then he tossed the candle into a section of books they’d soaked with gasoline. A wave of heat passed over us as the fire began to burn. There was something particularly hypnotic about these flames. Deep blues danced with the reds and oranges. At first, I thought it might be due to the chemicals in the book covers, but then other strange details began to emerge. There wasn’t a lick of smoke, yet a deeply unpleasant smell began to permeate the air, like rotting eggs.

“Look,” someone said after a few seconds, and then a woman screamed. Crawling out from the center of the fire were a cluster of snakes, their tar-black bodies long and thick as boa constrictors. As we watched, they continued to grow larger. More and more continued to appear from the depths of the fire, and it occurred to me that they were born from it. Indeed, they seemed to glow from within like embers.

A few in the crowd began to run, but the snakes pursued them, moving faster than any living creature I’ve seen before or since. I saw a woman try to run, only for a snake to trip her with its body before coiling around her. As it did, I heard the charring of her flesh mixed with the last of her screams, begging for someone to save her.

I turned to my father, only to see him disappearing down a snakes throat, his eyes already dead. And as it swallowed him, I heard Mr. Samuels laughing, watching the serpents feast.

I knelt amongst the writhing bodies, holding my book, praying to die quickly, not to suffer.

A few of the snakes eyed me wearily, but Mr. Samuels only wiped the happy tears from his eyes and shook his head.

“Not her,” he said, shaking his head. “She’s a stubborn one, she is.”

Then he gave me a wink and a smile and told me to run.

And run I did. I headed off into the night and didn’t stop until I’d reached the highway.

Of course, I tried to tell people what I’d witnessed, but I was only ten after all, and a girl to boot. A few government types came in and decided the whole thing had been a gas explosion, a real tragedy.

I moved to live with my aunt, who didn’t care one way or another about me, which I suppose was an improvement from my prior situation.

Now you can believe me if you want, Reverend Winslow. As I said, I’m an old lady, and no one listens to me. But I remember what I saw. And I’ll tell you this:

There was a photo attached of your church leadership, all vigorously debating the pros and cons of such an event, and amongst the old men I happened to spot one I recognized. It was a face that sent a shiver down my spine. Suddenly, I was that terrified little girl again, watching every man, woman, and child I’d ever known be burnt and swallowed whole.

The man was listed in the photo as a Mr. Wallis, but of course, a name is an easy thing to change. I’ll never forget that face, and I’ll tell you now that he used to go by Samuels. And he hasn’t aged a day in sixty years.

Sincerely,

[Ms. Evelyn Brown](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
