Beneath the grand glass atrium of the former Eastbrook Mall, slippery tile floors gleamed under neon signs that flickered "Cola-Co Classroom" and "Tech-tots Academy" in bright bursts. The inconsistent lapping of air-conditioned chill stabbed at my neck, ripping away the nostalgic warmth I had felt moments earlier.

The Eastbrook Mall was no longer recognizable; apart from the occasional urban explorer, the mall had sat empty for most of my life. I vaguely remember Dad taking me on the mall’s carousel as a kid; still almost able to taste the Cinnabon and Auntie Anne’s cutting through the perfume of the nearby Hollister. I remember the time I wandered off from my mother, accidentally creating new neural pathways in the back of Spencer’s and asking more questions than she could answer.

Within three years, all of those stores were gone, leaving behind a neighborhood-sized sea of asphalt moating a crumbling beige castle. In that state, the mall stared lifelessly at the surrounding roads and highways; drivers averted their eyes as if ignoring roadkill.

That was until the unburied carcass that was Eastbrook Mall was wrapped in a cocoon of drapes and tents. The chrysalis emerged the next year, rebranded to become our county’s K–12 campus, one of the many “LearningZone” locations metamorphosing dead malls across America.

The walkways were jammed with nearly every kid in the county; my nose turned up at the scent of stale pretzels and burnt popcorn wafting from converted storefronts. Students clustered around food stalls, clutching tablets and talking business in loud, hurried tones. I could tell immediately that I was out of my element; a fear I’d expressed to my parents months ago.

They signed the fifty-page Student Responsibility Pact without reading past the first paragraph. In exchange for the massive tax break, LearningZone assumed full custody of us from September through June. With most public schools now shuttered, and bridges burned with my old private school, they’d had no choice.

I watched my mother struggle to hold back tears as she signed, though I figure those were more for her reputation than her son. Before the representative left our living room, he clipped a purple “9th Grader” badge to a lanyard and placed it around my neck with all the importance of a presidential medal ceremony. He also left a box containing a tablet locked to the LearningZone network, preloaded with exactly ten “FutureFunds,” the only currency accepted.

No FutureFunds meant no lunch, no access to labs, no chance to step out of line.

I paced nervously down the corridor of pods, each a former boutique or electronics store now refitted into classrooms. Above one storefront, a sleek, techy font read: "Pod 7: TechMart Lab." Inside, kindergarteners tapped through smartphone UI tests for credits.

In "Pod 23: CreditNow CredCademy," students jostled one another in a frenzy, sharing answers to algebra problems to funnel points onto their FutureFunds cards. Their teacher looked exhausted, offering me a weary grin as I passed.

Neon sponsor logos pulsed above every entrance: "Energy Cola-Co," "CreditNow Financial," "SnackVault." The mall felt alive like it had when I was little, but I didn’t recall the oppressive hum of fluorescent lights and the weight of hundreds of judging eyes.

I swiped my badge to enter "Pod 12: FutureForce Learning Zone." The half-asleep facilitator woke up just enough to acknowledge me.

"Take a seat," she wheezed. "Follow all instructions on the tablet. No talking."

A faded "Launch Web" sticker sat over the tablet’s original power button, worn from whoever had it before me. When pressed, it booted to a garish Netscape-era screen that loaded at dial-up speed. I nervously scanned my classmates as they tapped through their tablets, eyes glazed, earning funds for slushy vouchers and branded hoodies.

When my tablet finally loaded, question one appeared:

FutureForce’s slogan is: “Learn Today, \_\_\_\_\_\_ Tomorrow.” A) Innovate B) Earn FutureFunds C) Question Authority D) Be Curious

I tapped "D," recalling their ever-present commercials. The tablet flashed green with a triumphant “cha-ching!” Every head in the pod turned toward me, the first time anyone had looked up.

"Hey, dude," a voice whispered behind me. "The volume buttons are on the side."

I turned to see a kid my age. One look at his shaggy blond hair and dopey smile told me there wasn’t much difference between him and a golden retriever.

"Sorry, it’s my first day," I chuckled, clumsily feeling around the tablet.

"That’s alright," he grinned. "Wouldn’t want anyone counting, right?"

I chuckled again and moved on to the next question:

“Every time you answer a question correctly, you earn \_\_\_\_ FutureFunds.”

Amused, I tapped "9" repeatedly until the text box overflowed. The screen flashed red, and my balance dropped from eleven back to ten.

“On a scale of 1–5, how much did you agree with this statement: ‘I feel prepared for my future career in retail and data collection.’”

Any answer less than “5” grayed out the submit button and revealed a checkbox:

\[ \] Are you sure? Please select additional coaching times. (Additional coaching must be done outside school hours, starting at just 15 FutureFunds per hour.)

Frustrated, I tapped “5.” Green again.

By the end, my balance had sunk to six. The room sighed collectively as our tablets announced the session was over. As I logged off, the boy behind me tapped my shoulder and pointed at my lanyard.

"You work at the Cola-Co Recharge Station too? What are your hours?"

"4:00 PM to 11:00 PM," I sighed. "My shifts start this week."

"Heck yeah! Bella’s our boss, but she's a senior. She’ll probably have me train you; might even get to slack off." He chuckled, offering his left hand. "I’m Ernie, by the way."

"Reed," I replied, shaking with my left hand awkwardly. He noticed.

"Sorry, haven’t done a non-Ranger handshake in a while. Did your old school have Zone Rangers?"

"Something like that," I lied. "But I never joined."

Ernie quickly tapped away at his tablet, soon mine buzzed with a flashing notification:

**Zone Rangers Meeting: Thursday 10:45 PM, ArcArcade.**

I looked back at Ernie, his grin still unwavering.

"Bella doesn’t care if we leave early Thursdays. You don’t have to come, but I think they’d want to meet you."

"Thanks, Ernie. I’ll think about it. This is all really different from my last school. I’m still trying to take it in."

"Think about it, Reedy," he said, nudging me. "Need help finding your room?"

"I'm okay, thanks." I waved. "I have everyth-"

"Everything on the tablet. Yep, figured." He tapped my shoulder and turned to leave. "See you at work, Reeds!"

I smiled and tapped the map icon. As it loaded, I thought about all the orientations and long conversations that led me here. I remembered my mom’s face when I got kicked out of her alma mater. Dad’s anger. The lies they told their friends about me. I didn’t just ruin my future; I torched their present.

Still, my biggest fear wasn’t messing up again. It was not making another friend. I was lucky to meet someone like Ernie on day one.

Realizing I was the only student left in the classroom, I quickly grabbed my tablet, passed the teacher’s desk, and smiled. She didn’t return it or even make eye contact. I stepped closer. Her eyes didn’t track me.

"Are you okay?" I asked. No name tag. Just “Facilitator” on her badge.

I waved my hand in front of her face. Nothing. I touched her shoulders to shake her gently. Her eyes moved, finally locking onto mine. Her gaunt eyes ping ponged in tandem with her facial muscles, twitching and spasming, before their unnerving tectonic movements stopped at all at once.

She and I looked frozen at one another for several moments when I noticed she had started to drool. Her heavy husk fell forward onto me, unable to keep itself propped in its chair. I tried to catch her, but my left arm was pinned under her weight. I was trapped on the mildewed carpet, her cheek pressed to mine.

Initially, I flailed my free limbs like a pill-bug placed upside down. When that didn’t work, I dug my nails into the floor to drag myself out. I heard a rip in my shoulder before I felt it. My scream silenced by the weight on my chest. I braced both feet against her and shoved, freeing my arm.

Adrenaline carried me to the dorms. I reached for my badge, but my lanyard was gone. A hand grabbed my shoulder and yanked me into an open dorm.

"Reed?"

"Y-yes," I gasped. Ernie quickly shut the door behind me, cutting off a crowd of students.

"We’re in it now," he muttered, stacking furniture until he could reach the ceiling. He popped out a square ceiling tile and crawled into the dark.

"You coming?"
