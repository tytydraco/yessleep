Crewmember autobiography, EO84726 Troy B. Tattershall M.A.

Abstract: Troy Tattershall M.A. is a well respected and renowned researcher and engineer at NASA who has been working primarily at the John F. Kennidy Space Center for approximately 3 years on a government funded project to bring researchers closer than ever to Jupiter. The projects goals are to study the relationship between Jupiter and its moons. His aspirations to explore past the Earth’s atmosphere started at a young age and he has worked impressively to get his master’s degree in STEM. His team consisting of 36 people have developed a shuttle that utilizes the recently developed Hans and Truble™ Nuclear Fusion engine, slashing in half the time a journey to Jupiter would take.

 

LOG:

Like the cliché, when I was just a boy, I wanted to become an astronaut. My nights as a child would normally consist of staring at the night sky, drawing new constellations with the pieces of already existing ones; unaware that thousands of years before they had been charted already. I would give them names that wouldn’t make sense to anyone else but a four year old, but I held them close, and they were the closest things I had to friends before middle school. After preschool my obsession with the celestial only grew and my fascination with the great nothingness of the heavens only grew with it. Of course, despite my father’s absence, my mother took my passion and became the catalyst for who I am now. After high school, I graduated from Rogers State University class of 2095 with a bachelor’s in STEM and reaching my master’s at ASU in the spring of 2098. My dreams of reaching the stars were finally closer than ever. My team at the John F. Kennidy Space center have been working tirelessly for the past 3-4 years on our magnum opus. We call it “the Terror.”

The launch is in 20ish minutes, and I don’t know if I am ready for it. I mean, I’ve been preparing for my entire life at this point but there’s an overflowing sense of dread, like the feeling you get when you are standing at the top of a building thinking not “what if I fall” but more “what if I jump?” I keep telling myself that this is what my whole life has led to, that this is my purpose and that this is my pain. I want to be able to tell my future son/daughter my stories as a space explorer and give them what I never had. A loving father. At the very least, I wish I had what Anderson has or at least something like it, I can’t tell if what he has is the confidence and backbone the research team needs or if it’s an overinflated ego that hasn’t been checked in years. With all the press surrounding the both the launch and the project itself, it certainly seems to be the latter. Despite his shortcomings though, he plays the role of our project manager and captain very well even when his pride sets the project back. He’s kinda hard to talk to though; all he ever talks about is upcoming press conferences and pr relationships, and if none of those than he’s bitching about some aspect of the project we are working on. Well, he bitches to us. Mara, our lead fusion engine technician, is usually the target of his pr conversations. Me and the rest of the crew joke about that a lot.

Another anxiety I have is the recent budget cuts to our food supply. While most of our 8-year journey is going to be spent in cryo-genesis, our planned “awake” hours are going to require food at least! Our crew “cookie,” Abel, reassured me about a day ago that we would have enough food to last a 5 man crew about 6 months but I don’t think that’s enough. It takes 1 and a half months for the computers to complete cryo-genesis calibration and that will be the time that we will be eating. The plan is to “sleep” a day after launch, during which before to make sure that everything is in working order with things like the Navpath systems, the Fusion engine, Back-ups, those sorts of things. Then after we sleep during the four-year journey, we should wake up in Jupiter’s orbit in which case we will do research for 6 months while the computer calibrates the cryo-genesis during the last 3 months of our research. After that we will go back to sleep and wake up in time to land on earth again, heroes. But what if something happens? What if something goes wrong and we need more food? It just seems a bit short sighted. But I trust Abel, we’ve been friends ever since the start of the project. Before his addition to our team, Abel was a chef at a 5 star restaurant, and has his bachelor’s in culinary arts. We instantly clicked when I interviewed him for the project and ever since he’s really been the only one I would put my trust in.

Sorry for the interruption, Mara popped by to ask how I was doing and I didn’t know what else to tell her. Ngozi is cool, I don’t really know much about her except that she’s from Nigeria. We talk some but she likes to keep to herself, usually reading the star charts and planning trajectory arcs and what not. She’s our navigator and while her dedication to her work is crucial to not only the project but to our survival, I feel like she secretly hates being alone. I don’t know why she doesn’t come to our crew lunches more but-

The launch was a complete success. Unfortunately, I was not able to complete the last log due to the timer I set going off reminding me to prepare for the launch. I wasn’t able to fully express all the details about the project, so I’ll use this log since I have plenty of time before we are all scheduled to sleep. So here are more details.

To finish what I was saying about Ngozi, she seems to distance herself from the rest of the crew for reasons unknown to us, but I’m sure I can find time to talk to her after we make it to Jupiter. As for the “Terror” herself, she is the finest spacecraft humankind has ever developed. When standing upright on earth it stands at a whopping 270 meters. The first stage uses jet fuel utilized by 10-ton rocket packages and got us out of the Earth’s atmosphere just fine. The second stage uses smaller jet-fueled rockets to help us gain speed. The second and third stage are activated at the same time until the second stage expires. The third stage utilizes the craft’s state of the art H&T Nuclear Fusion reactor to keep a constant and controlled speed; by which that time we should be sound asleep in cryo.

A point I forgot to bring up is the “Erebus.” The Erebus is a 100ftx187ftx12ft separate and semi-permanently attached ship, which houses the technicians assisting the main crew with their journey. The Erebus has its own food supply, kitchen, and cryo-genesis atrium with 22 pods for each technician. This vessel also houses the two vessel’s clinic and security office, staffed by Dr. Singh D.O, Betty Øldegard R.N. B.S.N, and Officer Freddy Womack.

These technicians were hand-picked by the main crew, Anderson, Mara, Abel, Ngozi, and of course me. All the technicians have different jobs of course, being separated by who they were hired by. Andersons technicians specialize in IT work and help run maintenance on the computers and A.I on board. Mara’s technicians specialize in maintaining and cleaning the ships utilities and environment, while also helping out from time to time with the fusion generator. Abel’s technicians assist in cooking for the entire project and counting inventory of all the food and equipment in storage. Ngozi’s technicians specialize in star maps and something else I can’t recall. I probably will right before going to “sleep” haha. My technicians of course specialize in helping along with project research, working with the instruments and bringing me data and whatnot. The clinic staff and security officer were hired by higher ups at NASA.

But as I mentioned, this project utilizes the wonderful and dangerous technology of cryo-genesis, developed by Lockheed-Martin. As not to bore whoever ends up reading these logs, whether it be the press, a master’s student writing their thesis, or my own children, I will keep the explanation brief. Cryo-genesis is the process of completely freezing a living being to temperatures below freezing almost to attempt to cease all movement possible and bodily decay. Anyone who uses them have to become equipped with a mechanical heart implant similar to a pacemaker. Once inside the pod, the subject is then sedated and robotic arms meticulously intubate the subject. Once frozen, the pod has to slowly raise the temperature of the pod over the course of several days to weeks depending on the body composition of the subject. This is to prevent cell breakdown and subsequent “liquification” of the subject’s connective tissue. As soon as the internal body temperature reaches a hyper-specific temperature, once again based on the subject's body composition, the heart implant activates creating blood circulation. This is also when the intubation activates. Once the body reaches the standard core temperature of about 36.5°C-38.5°C, stimulants are administered by robotic limbs via injection. Once brain scans indicate minimal brain activity, intubation is removed, and once normal brain activity is restored the subject is free to exit. Of course, we have to shove an entire grocery list of pills down our throats after, but usually only for about 3-4 days after release.

But now that all the “fun” stuff is out of the way, let’s talk about what’s going on right now. Abel is cooking everyone on the ship celebratory meals, and everyone is feeling happy and excited about what’s to come, and with Abel being the closest thing to a brother I have here on the Terror, I was able to get my dinner early before the techs. When I reached the cafeteria at about 23:30 he and his techs had been busy preparing food, bustling and rushing around the kitchen, commands being shouted and the high-pitched tings and dinks of metal pots and pans filled the room, seasoning the air with the smell of well-cooked food and the scent of intention.

 Abel was pacing the ins and outs of the kitchen, which had blended with the dining area with the exception of a buffet table covered by a sneeze guard. After standing for what seemed like 5 minutes by the salad bar, Abel finally shot his glance towards me and instantly his round, admittedly chubby face, revealed a wide grin from ear to ear. “Troy! Troy! Mon ami! How are you feeling after such a successful launch!” he said with his thick French accent. “It’s good to see you Abel, and yes I am just- I can’t contain myself!” I spoke.

Abel then walked towards me, his feet still intoxicated with the fast paced movement of a 5 star kitchen. He is a big man, about 6 foot 5 inches tall, broad shoulders, but an even broader abdomen, which makes his fast approach slightly alarming to the uninitiated. “What do you have planned for dinner tonight buddy?” I asked, “It better not be that weird- clam and alfredo pasta you tend to make, is it?” “Non non non, I understand that that dish is a very, ehm- \*refined\* - taste that only the most elite of Frenchmen such as myself could enjoy. Non, tonight I have planned a dish called, Coq au Vin, a fine dish that I’m sure everyone, not just you, will love.” “Are you calling me a fat-ass Abel?” I said through a light-hearted giggle. “Non, of course not Troy, it just so happens that your favorite dish of mine is the one being served tonight, which is why I have doubled the normal recipe portions” he said through a smirk. “Here, I have a surprise for you mon ami.” He motioned with the ladle in his hands and shouted, “Le premier plat s'il vous plait!” Maybe a couple seconds later came a cook tech with a plate of Coq au Vin, still steaming hot. “You get the first plate mon ami, for getting us up here safely.” “I am honored to be served the first plate of Coq au Vin in space, by the fattest cook in space might I add.” “And I am honored to serve the first plate of Coq au Vin in space to none other than Bigfoot” Abel retorted through a laugh that could infect germs themselves.

It was true though, I did wear a massive size shoe, at a whopping size 19 in men’s. As you can tell from me and Abel’s conversation, we both playfully jest at each other’s expense, but that’s been our dynamic since the beginning of our friendship. As I was finishing up my food, techs started to pour in from the doors and lining up to get their fix of French cuisine for tonight, and the last bit of food until our first stop in 4 years.

After the room had settled I saw my other crew members walk in, Anderson taking point. Anderson walked onto the marble stage on the far east side of the room, stopping only once he reached the lectern center stage. The lights dimmed and a spotlight shown onto Anderson on stage, where he thrived. After hooking up his frequency phone to the cafeteria speakers, he spoke in his most proudest voice I have heard yet. “Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank you all for your hard work and dedication for the past 3 years! This project still be on the ground if it weren’t for none other than YOU!” The crowd let out a couple claps and some whistles but stayed relatively tame. “Now before we get started with the schedule, I would like for everyone to look to your left and to look to your right and tell whoever you see ‘hello! I’m so excited to be working with you!’” The room erupted with the shrill screeching of chairs and various murmur of some following the instructions, nothing more, and previous acquaintances chatting about assorted topics.

 Anderson then raised his hand and said, “All right now that we all have gotten to know each other I would like to introduce me, and the other members of the team by which you are working for.” The spotlight quickly shot over to the corner of the room to a meek looking creature, with long black hair, brown eyes, and short stature. She was blinded by the spotlight and taken aback. “This is the lovely, Mara Brantley; she will be managing all of the utilities on-board the Terror and will be in charge of keeping the lights on! You will come to her for any environmental complaints and generator concerns while you work. “Hello, it’s- so nice to meet you all” she managed to spit out. The spotlight then honed in towards Abel, his massive stature casting a large shadow behind him. “This is Abel Truleaux, a five star chef, who will be in charge of inventory and food prep for the Terror” Anderson added. “Bonjour, Je m’appelle Abel, your chef.” Anderson then shouted, “If you have any food requests when we wake up in 4 years, make sure you write them down now!” All I could think after he said that was how the food in our stomachs wouldn’t be fully digested for 4 years.

The spot-light moved again, this time it showed a lady with a dark complexion, her curls stopping at her shoulders neatly and her lab coat reflecting the stage’s sun off into the eyes of everyone into the room. “Everyone say hello to the ship’s navigator, Ngozi Achebe!” Anderson spit out while swallowing a sip of his water, “She is the one who is going to get us to Jupiter safely!” She didn’t move almost at all, only lifting her head to acknowledge the crowd. Still though, when she introduced herself it felt forced or obligated, stating, “Hello, my name is Ngozi Achebe, it is a pleasah to meet you awl.” As forced as her introductory was, so too was the claps from the crowd forced.

But I knew what time it was. As soon as I thought it I could feel the warmth of the spotlight beating the back of my neck. “And this here is the lovely Troy Tattershall, our lead researcher for this project. He will be the one to talk to if your interested in anything STEM related at all.” This was my moment, it was here, just say the line you wrote. “Uhm, uh-.” God I was so embarrassed. The words were there but they just got clogged up at the exit of my mind. I scramble for the best thing that could fit both the situation and the exit door of my mind. “Uh if you think about it guys, we- we are going to be digesting this food for the next four years.” A couple laughs from the crowd but other than that just straight awkwardness. I can’t believe this, but it doesn’t matter now anyways. Now I just lie low and wait for the phase to pass. “That’s very interesting Troy, I never thought of it like that!” Anderson piped, gripping his laser pointer between his muscular fingers and pitching it between his hands.

After the introductions were made, Anderson lectured on for 2 hours longer about how we are the pioneers of humanity, blah blah blah, beacons of engineering, blah blah blah, heroes of Earth, blah blah blah. I mean he’s right, but when he says it, I just blank out and think.

Finally, the meeting was done, it felt like we could’ve already been to Jupiter and back by the time Anderson finished but I’ve been through many, many, MANY knuckle scraping hours of lectures for my master’s so I could handle it. After we were dismissed, I sat down and started recording this. As of right now the time is 02:52 and I think I’m going to try to get a nap first, because I heard it helps with the nausea after waking up during cryo-genesis.

Here is to a fucking awesome leap for mankind.

Holy shit they were not kidding about the nausea. Even with a nap before, I feel like I can keep liquids in. More than anything I feel bad for Nurse Betty. She has given everyone, INCLUDING HERSELF, an IV with 3L of saline to keep us hydrated.

As of recording this log it has been about 2 days since most people gained consciousness, including me. Many of us have been affected by the nausea, with the exception of Ngozi, who if I recall, didn’t eat that night 4 years ago. Maybe I need to keep that in mind in three months. Still though there are two people who have yet to have “thawed” out. One of my techs, Geoffry, and one of Ngozi’s techs, Brittany. Their vitals look good according to Dr. Singh, but they are just taking longer than usual. There isn’t really a protocol for this, seeing how cryo-technology is only so old. However, it’s been about 4 years so maybe contacting NASA is the best way to go about this. I brought the idea up to Ngozi and she wanted Anderson’s permission first. But I just don’t see the use in it.

However, I have not just been sitting around. About 16 hours after I unfroze, I immediately got to work. And what I have found is never-before-seen by human eyes. I mean, say what you want about the true size of Jupiter, but until you are less than 300,000 miles away from it, you will never understand the absolute scale. Looking outside the observation deck at certain times and it’s all you see. Now what our main research goal here consists of is travelling with the orbit of Jupiter to get a closer look at the textile and material consistency of the surface of both Jupiter and his moons. There are about 87 confirmed total moons around Jupiter. What we could find out from this mission is whether or not these moons could support any life, simple or complex. Another thing we aim to find out is what the inside of these celestial bodies looks like, using complex instruments. Oh my God we could find anything here! We are in uncharted territory. Well, they have been charted on paper and in theory, but not in exploration! Like I said four years ago, this is one awesome fucking leap for mankind.

After I finish recording this log I’m off to go celebrate with the main crew, Abel stashed bottles of champagne and wine for just this occasion. He may not be a scientist, but he’s still a brilliant man.

Hey, it’s been a bit since I last wrote, but I’ve just had so so so so much data pile in. They finally awoke the tech for Ngozi, but my tech unfortunately passed away from a clot that lodged in his brain causing a stroke where he died eight minutes later in the clinic. I was absolutely devastated. The call to his family is going to take so much away from me mentally. But here we are. No one said that this job was all sunshine and rainbows, but it’s still just, wow. Fuck. Ngozi said that whenever I am ready, we will set up the frequency phone and directly ring Geoffry’s wife. Of course, Anderson doesn’t care. His first reaction to Geoffrey’s death wasn’t oh my God that poor soul. It was, and I quote, “holy shit what if the BBSC picks up on this, fuck what do I do.” I don’t know what to say. A distasteful waft of selfishness and makes my eyes water every time I walk past his office. Abel of course has comforted me through this, he even helped me write down what I would say to Geoffry’s family. But I have been cooping myself up in my room ever since just burying myself in my work.

It doesn’t help that these readings we are getting are either unreadable or mediocre. So far we have scanned over 23 moons and none of them besides Europa have anything interesting to report. And the big deal about Europa? It has a slightly irregular orbit around Jupiter that we have never seen. This could be explained by a calculation error. I wouldn’t know since one of the only people qualified to help me out here just died and I’m the only who can plan the funeral.

Geoffry’s funeral. This is a tough one. The Terror wasn’t outfitted with a morgue, on account that we didn’t expect anyone to die here. The only thing I can think of is sticking him back into the cryo-pod he died in or to throw him out the airlock into the largest mass grave to ever exist.

I think I’m going to choose the latter. In my interviews and subsequent visits with Geoffry, he shared that same obsession that I have and that I had when I was a kid staring at the sky in rural Oklahoma. Ultimately, it’s up for the wife to decide, but that’s how I would want to go. Maybe I should right that down somewhere in case I die as well.

Not much to report today, Abel made some crème brulee as a treat after Geoffry’s funeral today. His wife opted to have him thrown into space. It was so strange how lifeless body went from flaccid and stringy to rigid and red. The lack of any pressure at all forced all of the blood in his body out of any opening imaginable. His pores, his eyes, his mouth, his anus, it was everywhere. It was a grizzly sight to put lightly. Of course, we all said our goodbyes and sent him off into his next adventure. Some of the techs cried, it was most painful to see Mara crying. More than anything, however, is that he will be the first human to ever cross the atmosphere for Jupiter.

For this part I don’t want anyone to know. But as we were “burying” Geoffry, I noticed something in the distance after we opened the airlock doors, and he shot out. A dark spherical object that was hidden in the glares of the stars behind it, masquerading behind the shadow of Jupiter. It looked big enough to be considered a moon. Though more testing than just visual confirmation would have to be in order. Of course, it could always just be an established moon that was hidden by the shadow of literally anything, another moon, an asteroid, or the planet next to it with a diameter of fucking 87 thousand miles. I’m going to talk to Ngozi tomorrow night about trying to navigate Jupiter’s orbit to get a closer look at the unforeseen celestial body. For now, I just need to go to bed. I feel absolutely exhausted.

I talked to Ngozi again and she said that Anderson wants to talk to me about finding this new moon. At first in my tired stupor, I was actually taken aback, expecting my request to be denied lest while maneuvering the Terror something bad should happen. Walking to his office I made the realization that Anderson would be the kind of person to forgo safety to cover up the death of Geoffry with promises of a newly discovered moon to the press.

As soon as I entered Anderson’s office, I was hit in the face with the pungent smell of Versace blue jeans cologne and faded cigarette smoke. Smoking on board the ship outside of designated areas was prohibited but that doesn’t matter when you’re the one making the rules. With a lit cigarette in between his muscular, tobacco-stained fingers, he told me to sit and gestured with all six of fingers, shaving bits of ash onto his mahogany desk, to pull up a chair. After offering me a cigarette, and accepting my polite declination, we began to talk about what I had seen on the day of Geoffry’s funeral. Anderson said, “So if we are going to put in the resources for this, I need to know exactly what you saw, because Troy, really I trust you. But you have to understand what kind of risk we all are taking here. So, in your best terms describe to me what happened and what you saw.” I replied, “Ok so when the airlock doors opened, I could see this spherical, or elliptical, or oval uh... thing moving.” Thinking about it now, I don’t really remember the exact shape of what I saw. I remember it being rounded, pitch black, and it moved slightly faster than any of the other objects flying around out there. “I just remember it being round more than anything, and it was dark, as if hidden in the shadow of the Jupiter, but I don’t think it was any of the moons we have already discovered so far. This- thing- is just different.”

Anderson took a big hit from his cigarette and put his head in his other hand and leaned on the table. I could tell he was fighting himself, his Id and Superego fighting to the death in an arena of 36 bones neatly tied to each other with winding sutures and insulated by small layers flesh and hair. He sat there for a while, weighing his options, until he finally lifted his head up and hesitantly spoke, “Go to Ngozi’s office and talk to her about finding this thing, if we make a new discovery, Geoffry’s death won’t be in vain.” I nodded my head and as I sat up and reached the threshold of the doorway Anderson spat out, “Troy you know, you should smile more. Maybe people would appreciate risking their lives for you better.”

At Ngozi’s office we talked about my description of the moon, and checked where all of the celestial bodies orbiting Jupiter were that day. I tried really hard to remember the trajectory of the body I saw, but it never came to me. Eventually we settled on a path we could take to come in close contact with the moon and talked to Mara about steering the ship that direction. She said that she would have it taken care of first thing tomorrow morning and to hope for the best. She wished me good luck before me and Ngozi made our way to our bedrooms, to settle in for the night.

It’s been bothering me how little I remember the object I saw that day. I remember my stifled reaction to seeing it in Geoffry’s funeral, but I remember nothing about the actual thing itself. My reaction would have me assume I saw it in full detail. But I just can’t recall a thing about it except it’s shape, and even then. I’m just going to go to bed and hope something happens soon.

No sign of the shape yet. That’s what I’ve taken to call it now since there’s nothing about it I can recall. Only thing that seems slightly interesting is that Abel cut his hand this morning pretty bad making breakfast for the crew. He’s been in the clinic all day pretty much and they’re saying he could be out of commission for tonight’s dinner. So, the tech’s are doing an ole’ fashioned “fend-for-yourself” dinner tonight. I’m not too hungry so I think I’m going to go to bed early tonight.

There it goes, thank you, Schmidt. Yes, you too.

So...  There’s been an incident to say the least. More like a tragedy. About two weeks ago on our path to find the hidden moon we made a mistake. At about 12:30 two weeks ago we “found” it to put it one way. The shape we had been trying to study turned out to show up unexpectedly on the terror’s right side. It’s gravity was impressively unproportional to it’s size as we were pulled towards it and as a result the Terror was “slingshot” into open space away from the sun. Our velocity last I heard was about 103,345mph. As impressive as our fusion engine is, it’s estimated to take about 15 months to slow down safe enough to where we can make our course back to earth. In which case it will take us at this point 17 years to make it back according to Ngozi’s estimates. Morale is lower than it has ever been as today one of the techs was found dead by a self-inflicted stab wound to the neck after stealing a fork from the Erebus’s kitchen. She was one of Mara’s techs and Mara has not been doing well since. We barely even see her anymore.

Most of the essential equipment and utilities weren’t damaged besides a couple computers, including mine, but the exact cause for the damage is unclear. The Terror and Erebus outer ship casings are made of lead, and below that is a thin and extremely complex network of water lines so it could not have been pulse of abnormal radiation because the only equipment affected was inside the ship. All other instruments work fine.

I wanna say maybe a day or two after the incident, Anderson called a meeting in the cafeteria, where he made a long speech that fell upon deaf ears. And Cidnee, Mara’s now deceased tech, is an example of the uselessness of his lecture.

I haven’t gotten much sleep. I can’t help but to blame myself for this whole thing. I mean it was I who saw the damn thing, and it was I who advocated to pursue it. But It’s all been so strange. Between the incredible gravitational power of the moon, the instruments going haywire for no explicable reason, and how it seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, there’s something strange happening. What ever is happening, I don’t think the Terror, nor the Erebus are ready for what’s to come.
