This — whatever it is I'm attempting here — is wildly off-protocol, but it is my firm belief that, unlike our strict rules dictate, the people need to be more aware.



You do not know me and, if everything is to go as planned, you never will. You may call me JL but this is as far as I'll share, because none of this is about me. If I know the human nature — and I do, unfortunately so — most who read this will take it as the rantings of a cooky conspiracy nut at best, fiction at worst. That's fine. If this little experiment of mine manages to make even one or two of you more aware, if somehow this helps someone to report things before it's too late, for once, I'll consider this a success. I am, after all, putting everything on the line to warn you.



I am one of the many cogs in a very, *very* old machine. An organization that has been operating for as long as societies and governments have existed, maybe longer. Just like you'll never know who I am, you'll never learn who *we* are. The M.A.D — an acronym I will, obviously, not explain — has worked tirelessly to research, contain and understand the things that most believe not to exist. Conspiracies have longed speculated on the things hidden by the ones in power. Aliens. Mind control technology. What we're really hiding is much more real... and much more dangerous.



The things that go bump in the night. The horrors seeping in your nightmares. The unexplainable.



You have never heard of us and yet we are everywhere around you, watching you, protecting you, cleaning up the messes you create when playing with things you don't understand or when those same things play with you instead. Your therapist probably works for us. Your family doctor, your friendly neighborhood police officer, your favorite mailman. On M.A.D's payroll to make sure we keep eyes everywhere at all time, act quick, prevent the worst.



But there is a reason you've never heard of us. Every cog, every employee is bound to the utmost secrecy, at all times, everywhere. Spouses, children, siblings... All lied to, kept in the dark. Let alone strangers on the internet. As I said, *this* is off-protocol, in a degree that would lend me in more trouble than you can even fathom, I assure you. I take this risk only because I'm tired of having to wait for multiple 'accidents' or 'catastrophes' to happen for us to be able to pinpoint anomalies and act. There is no way for people to reach us directly, call for us when something weird happen. So people ramble incoherent things about impossible events to friends that believe them to be crazy, and then they lose their mind or they die. Again, and again, until it makes enough waves for us to take notice of it as more than freak accidents and coincidences.



So I'm taking it upon myself to share with you some of my case files, redacted, cut and tweaked to maintain secrecy and facilitate your understanding. Maybe if some of you take these seriously, more of you will be aware, careful, safer. And if something unexplainable happens to you, you'll have *one* point of contact. Hopefully it means we'll be able to act faster... before you die, that is.



A lot of blissfully ignorant people love saying there's no time like the present. So here you go.

**Case File #JL056-R: The Nameless Carnival**

**Researcher:** \[REDACTED\]

**Phenomenon Type**: Ontological

**Interaction Risk:** Proximity-Based

**Threat Level:** Amber

**Containment Classification:** Uncontained. Probable future classification: Unstable (ongoing operation by Containment Team Bravo, led by \[REDACTED\], see case file #MH078-C)

**Research Priority:** Moderate

\_\_\_



First documented in 1893, the 'Carnival' is a recurring metaphysical anomaly whose classification has been disputed over the years. I have found multiple past case files that seem to elude to the same phenomenon, however even if they all indicate the fact that containment has been eluded, this is the only common theme those reports seem to share. Events, appellations and more importantly phenomenon type and threat level have all changed from one report to another, at the discretion of the researchers and containment team leaders who wrote them.



Theorization of the anomaly's origins remain, officially, inconclusive though historical accounts suggest ties to an Ancient Greek festival or ritual only ever mentioned as 'ἡ ἀνώνυμος ἑορτή'. hē anōnymos heortē (for better readability) can be translated in different ways, which has led many to doubt its' validity as this metaphysical anomaly's point of origin. Although 'The Anonymous Festival' is more often than not the name attributed to it as legal and, for all intent and purpose, official translation — recorded in archives by \[REDACTED\] in 1897 — it is my belief that this particular nomenclature is erroneous.



According to my own translation of scrolls in the Directorate's collection eluding to this earlier iteration of the anomaly — recovered by \[REDACTED\] in 41 BCE before the 'Alexandria Debacle' — a translation more befitting of it would be 'The Nameless Feast'. The texts hint at the fact this 'Carnival', as we have come to call it in our modern era, isn't only a 'feast' or 'festival' comprised of nameless and anonymous performers but that, more so, the anomaly itself feasts on the nameless, making them thus.



The anomaly manifests sporadically, typically in isolated rural areas, and always between a predictable, repeated set of hours. Few records of surviving witnesses exist, let alone accounts from their experiences inside the anomaly. However those who do wildly differ in their tales but on closer inspection, a few occurrences seem to coincide amongst them: impossible architecture, unblinking performers, rotten apples scent, predatory undertones.



A few notable apparitions, documented in past case files, include:



\- August 1922, \[REDACTED\], Vermont. Thirteen attendees supposedly disappeared although none of their birth certificates were ever able to be recovered by our operatives, or anyone for that matter. The sole survivor of this group, one \[REDACTED\] reported seeing 'living statues' among the attractions. (see case file #YB149-R, archived).



\- June 1975, \[REDACTED\], England. The anomaly reportedly claimed a small village of 200 residents. Local records affirm the village, though it indeed existed, has always been a ghosttown, never priorly inhabited. (see case file #RE097-C, archived).



\- September 2003, \[REDACTED\], Montana. One survivor was checked into a low level psychiatric facility after claiming he was born in 1848 and had just gone to a 'freak show' with his wife and children the night prior, which, according to him, was March 14th, 1884. (see case file #BB113-R, archived).



Containment Team Bravo has been deployed to the most recent manifestation site, coordinating a new attempt at containment efforts under Protocol Amber-Twelve. Research and analysis are ongoing. For preliminary findings I redirect you to \[REDACTED\]'s case file #MH078-C for case-specific data and field team reports.



This current iteration of the anomaly appeared on October 25, in \[REDACTED\], France and left a single witness, one Lila \[REDACTED\] who claims her younger sister, Clara \[REDACTED\] vanished during the event. Despite compelling details, official records show no evidence Clara ever existed or of Lila ever being anything other than an only child, leading to questions about memory distortion, reality alteration, or deeper causal mechanisms within the anomaly. For your own analysis, here's Lila's account, transcribed in full.



\_\_\_

**Account of Lila \[REDACTED\] pieced together from her therapy sessions at the \[REDACTED\] psychiatric hospital and translated to English:**



I have a sister. Her name is Clara. She exists. I know she's real. She exists, she exists, she exists.



Shit. Okay. Sorry. No, the meds work fine, it's just... I don't know why you want me to tell the story again, the more I try to explain it, the crazier it sounds...



It started when Clara burst into my room one night, she was practically buzzing right there on the spot. God it used to piss me off so much, how hyperactive she always was. I miss it now. She said there was a carnival in town, out by the old quarry. Honestly it should've been my first red flag. Nobody ever comes to bump fuck nowhere, miles away from anything remotely exciting. Even with how boring the town usually is, a carnival sounded like a drag, children stuff, you know? Clara wouldn't let it go though. "Come on Lila." she said. "It'll be fun." she said.



I said yes mostly to shut her up.



Listen, don't look at me like that. I love my sister... *loved* her. But we were two very different sides of the family coin. In case you haven't noticed, I'm not really the cheerful, happy-go-lucky kind. Even before... you know. That was all her. She was the baby, she had the dimples, the million watts smile, the jokes, the energy. I was content just listening to my music and drawing, as often as she'd let me have peace. Which wasn't nearly as often as I would've liked back then.



Anyway, I said yes and when she explained it to me in more details, it started to sound at least a little more interesting. Less like a regular childish carnival and more like one of those Halloween special one-night only events. Mostly because, apparently, the whole thing was super hush-hush, only stayed in each town for one day, only opened at night, from midnight to 3AM or something like that. Red flag number two, I know. But like I said, there's *never* any action happening around here.



It took her less than 3 minutes to get ready, throw me a jacket and wait for me by the door, in that fidgety way of hers that always makes you feel like you have to hurry or she'll explode or something. When the bus drops us a few feet away from the quarry all we see is an empty dirt field and a cluster of dark, silent buildings in the distance. Can't say I blame the bus driver for the wary look he gave us. It was no place to be at night. I don't frighten easily but seeing my baby sister hopping up and down in her little pink dress in the middle of this deserted place... it didn't sit well with me. I should've listened to my gut, I should've dragged her back to the bus stop kicking and screaming. Fuck, I'd be fine with her stupid pouting while she hates me for a day or two. At least she'd still be *here*.



It took us more walking than I thought to finally see the Carnival in the distance. I honestly had started to believe someone had messed with Clara and there was no event at all. It wouldn't have been the first time she was bullied by dumb kids at school because of how trusting and excitable she was. The whole place was surrounded by these towering black fences, taller than any I’d ever seen, with curling, twisted spires at the top. There was this big hand painted banner over the entrance that, I thought, had the name of the carnival on it, but when we got close enough for me to make it out, it was just a drawing... a logo of sorts, I guess. Like a long scepter or staff, or something, all gnarly and twisted. Weird.



The second we stepped in, I swear it was like the air... changed. It was the middle of the night, it had been chilly, fresh, crisp, usual October nights stuff. Past the gate though, it was... warmer? It could've been all the rides, and people, food stands, performers, all of it just warming up the place but even the smell of the air was different. It smelled sweet but the wrong kind of sweet. Does that even make any sense to you? Of course not... Okay, it smelled like... like if someone had hidden a bunch of rotten apples under handfuls of cotton candy. Maybe that's what carnivals usually smell like, the fuck do I know.



The music was strange too. It was cheerful and all, carnival-y tunes or whatever but kind of slow and off-key all the time. It wasn't in-your-face noticeable but honestly it gave the whole place an eerie atmosphere. That gut feeling, that didn't want me to get off the bus, it wasn't getting any better. But it had been a long time since I stayed out at night, I used to be majorly afraid of the dark as a kid and it took me a while to get over that so I thought maybe that was all it was, me reverting to a scaredy cat. Plus, Clara didn’t seem to care.



She dragged me to the carousel first.



It looked normal enough, but there was no way I was going to jump on a poorly painted plastic horse and spin in circles to bad circus music while pretending I'm having the time of my life, no matter how much she begged for it. I told her to go for it, that I'd watch from the sidelines. Clara shuffled towards one of the fake horses without hesitation, laughing like this whole experience was as normal as the shitty neighbourhood fair we get every summer. It made me feel like maybe I was overreacting. If she saw nothing weird in the place, it probably was all in my head. Mom always says I have an "almost concerningly weird overactive imagination" and, other than it being a mouthful, she isn't wrong per se. And I can see what you're thinking, I'm not making all this up. I know mom thinks I do, dad thinks I do. Hell, *you* think I do. But I'm not, it happened and Clara is real!



No. Sorry. I know. You always say that when I get to this part. **I don't know** why you can't find anything about this place, all I know is what I saw and what I saw is that this... this *thing* took my sister from me!



Oh. The carousel. Yeah. It was... normal, mostly. Most of the horses and animals were missing a hoof, little chunks of a leg or an arm or pieces of the mane or the wings. Kind of creepy looking but honestly on par with most fairs and carnivals I'd seen on TV before. I looked around a bit while Clara was trying to hoist herself on the back of her chosen steed, I had this creeping feeling at the back of my neck, like someone was watching. Not unusual to get a few looks in a place full of people and I've never really been good in crowds but rationalizing it wasn't making it go away or helping me feel better about it.



The performers were the first thing I noticed. They were scattered all around the place, doing their thing, entertaining people, you know the drill. At first I wasn't sure why looking at them made me feel... icky? Sure some of them were as ugly as can be but being a judgmental a-hole never creeped me out before. They were all smiling, those big unnatural smiles that performers and actors always force. Nobody smiles like that. But their faces it was... it was wrong, they weren't *moving*. They were smiling, they were talking, reciting lines, hollering to the crowd but there was nothing there. No expression lines creasing their skin, no subtle crinkling around the mouths, none of that 'twinkle in the eye' bullshit. And they weren't... blinking. Not once. I looked and I looked and I stared like some unintentional staring contest between me and them that I was the only one playing but no matter how long I let my eyes sting and burn from keeping them open, I didn't see it. The blinking. It wasn't there. Do you know how terrifying it is, a bunch of people who just don't blink?



Then the carousel started spinning and the music got louder, it took me out of my staring and honestly I was glad for it, I was started to think I was just making stuff up to scare myself. I looked back to see if Clara was waving like little kids do to their parents on those things. She was. For a split second before getting eyes on her, I saw my reflection in the mirrors lining the ride and call me a chicken but I refused to look. I was scared I wouldn't be blinking either. Yeah. I don't know. I said \*I don't know\* why I thought that, I was creeped out, it felt like a sensible fear to have in the moment. In the end looking at myself in the mirrors, blinking or not, would have been better than... *whatever* I saw.



The carousel spun and spun and spun. I was almost getting dizzy just looking at it. Honestly the more I looked, the more it seemed like it was spinning way faster than it should have been and the only thing I could make out clearly was the splosh of pink from Clara's dress coming in and out of the picture. Then I looked some more — I didn't want to let her out of my sight if I could help it — and the horses weren't horses anymore. I don't... I'm not sure. They were just... carved into shapes that shouldn't have been possible. They were horses, I saw them before Clara want on, but what I was looking at now wasn't. Twisting bodies with too many legs in too many places, human or monstrous faces appearing and disappearing from the plastic beasts' sides, hollow eye sockets, and, in the middle of it all, the laughing pink figure of my baby sister.



I wanted to leave right then. Grab Clara and run as far as I could from this place. I didn't know what I was seeing but it felt like too many weird stuff back to back for me to rationalize that it was all in my head. I'm not insane and... Oh no, don't give me that look. I'm not. Just because I'm here and you're a shrink for crazy people doesn't mean I'm bullshitting my way through this. Mom put me here. If you ask me she's the insane one for not remembering her own favorite child. I'm not one of your looneys with psychotic delusions or whatever diagnosis you put on my patient sheet, and I wanted to hightail it out of there, but the carousel stopped and they were horses again. Plastic, ugly horses.



Clara was having the time of her life. She was *so* happy. Laughing, chattering to me about something or other once she got back to my side. I can't tell you what she said, I was still staring. They were horses alright. Nothing more, nothing less. No extra limbs, no weird faces. Clara tugged on my hand and off we went to explore more of the Carnival. Don't ask me why I didn't do exactly what I wanted to and dragged her out of there on the spot. At this point I was too stunned to function properly, I think.



The rest of the night was a blur of weird and creepy things. It still is. A blur, I mean. I just can't... remember most of it. At one stall a man in a porcelain mask gave Clara a teddy bear without her even playing one of the stupid games, like apple bobbing or duck fishing or whatever they do in those things. I think he said something to her about how would she like to work in a place like that too, or something, I'm not sure. I remember Clara hugging that bear — it honestly looked like it had fleas and probably measles — smiling ear to ear telling me "see Lila, they're nice here." and tugging me towards this place's version of a hall of mirrors. That, I remember. I wish I didn't, but I do. Bits and pieces of it, at least.



I had avoided looking at mirrors and reflective surfaces we passed since the whole 'no blinking' thing. I'm not sure I did it consciously, I just know I still had this weird fear in my gut that I'd look and I wouldn't be blinking and I didn't know how I'd cope with that. Seeing other people not blink, whether it was in my head or not, was one thing but witnessing my own body not doing something it was naturally hardwired to do seemed worse, somehow. Don't. I know you want to ask "do you think your fear of not blinking stems from deeper trauma" or some therapist bullshit like that, it's written all over your face. It's not like that. I've never been afraid of it before. I never even *thought* much about whether or not I was blinking before, I just... did. Like everyone.



Anyway, I wasn't thrilled about the prospect of the Hall of Mirror, as you can imagine. But like with everything else that night, it wasn't my choice, it was Clara's and I was just along for the ride. She always was a happy kid, laughing and all, but I knew better. She had had it rough the last year, with the bullying at school and even some of her friends picking on her. She was failing maths and science pretty bad and dad wasn't happy with that. He already had one screwed up kid that wasn't gonna go into medicine like he wanted so he put a lot of pressure on Clara to do better than me. Be better than me. Even when she was just a kid, before it actually mattered what damn grade she got. At home, when nobody was around, she smiled less and less. So seeing her this happy for the first time in a while, I just couldn't say no. I told you, I loved my sister. Probably more than my parents did even before they were shitty enough to forget her.



So I shut up and I followed her in there, swallowing every bit of fear I had felt since we got to the Carnival in the first place. By that point in the night I had gotten pretty damn good at telling myself I was just making it up. Clara was seeing nothing weird at all and dad had done a bang-up job all these years telling me my imagination was a *bad* thing. It didn't seem to farfetched to believe it in that situation and think I was just trying to scare myself. I know it's a flimsy excuse, anybody with half a brain would have left a long time ago, but I didn't even though I should've, and that's that.



Two steps in between those walls to walls mirrors, scattered around like a maze to solve, and it already didn't feel right. The space, it was too big, the ceiling of the tent too high, the stripes of the fabric walls twisted at odd angles. I know it's the whole point of a hall of mirrors, it fucks with your perception, with the perspective of things, but it didn't feel like that. It doesn't sound real but it felt like things were shifting around us, not in our heads like it should've but physically, like... reality wasn't all real, or something. I told you I didn't want to go over it again, you're making me sound certifiable. But it's what happened, I swear.



Clara sauntered in, oblivious to what I was feeling apparently, while all the hair on my arms was up, goosebumps on top of goosebumps. And it was nothing compared to how I'd feel once I actually looked at the mirrors themselves. At first it was the usual, some making us look all long and lanky, others making us short and stout. You know how those things work, right? The constant off-key sounds of tuba, piccolo, glockenspiel and tambourine — that classic carnival music but slightly... wrong, like one of those music boxes with a rusted cog — was as omnipresent and loud inside the hall of mirrors tent as it was outside somehow, and it made everything feel worse. I was trying as best I could to just not look, stare at my feet or something, but it's hard to do when there's nothing *but* mirrors everywhere and your obnoxious little sister insists on pointing to every other one with a "look, look!".



So I looked. It had gotten dark in the recesses of the tent, in the center of the mirror maze and it was hard to see anything more than just her reflection and mine. Details were lost in the darkness, the pink of her dress almost looking a dark shade of fuchsia, my green eyes barely a shade lighter than pitch black, so on and so forth. But it could have been blindingly dark and I'd still recognize my sister's face, no matter what. And what I saw in that mirror, it wasn't her face. It was, but it wasn't. No, you don't understand. It \*looked\* like her, it had her button nose, her freckles, the gap between her front teeth, but I **know** my sister, and that wasn't her. She was next to me, walking, waving her hands at the oddly shaped reflections, giggling like the schoolgirl she was, and yet all I saw in those mirrors were faces upon faces merging themselves with Clara's features. Strange faces, eerie faces.



There were smiling faces, whose mouths were stretched too wide in a horrific version of that stupid smile the performers wore. Surprised faces, so exagerated that it seemed like eyes would pop out of their own sockets at any moment, even though said sockets looked completely hollow in the darkness. Sad faces, with features twisted in grotesque pain and anguish, tears running down their porcelain white cheeks in red rivulets and tiny chunks catching the skin, like blood and sinews were flowing from their eyes instead of water. All of them were wearing my sister's rosy cheeks and her dusty blond ponytail.



None of them were blinking. *She* wasn't blinking.



I couldn't even check if I was. The music started to sound like laughter. Ugly laughter, like it finished a joke I wasn't in on. Like something horrible was happening around me and I was as clueless as someone could be. I knew what I was seeing, it wasn't right. It was terrifying. But was it real? I know now it was, **I know**. You can tell me all you want that I'm crazy but it won't change that. But back then, I couldn't be sure. The only sure thing was that I wanted out. By any means and regardless of my sister's wishes. I thought I was going nuts, I had this nagging feeling that something worse was going to happen, that the longer I stared at those faces over Clara's, the more they'd... become her. Or something. I don't know. I don't want to think about it. At night I can still see the fleshy chunks of viscera, or whatever it was, dangling from that red stained cheek that was wearing Clara's face, blood gushing out more and more from its' eyes. Her eyes. *My sweet Clara...*



Fuck, yes I still have nightmares. Of course I have nightmares! Are you stupid?



Sorry, sorry... Yeah, I took her out of the tent as fast as I could. She wasn't thrilled about it and I tried not to freak her out. She clearly didn't see what I did and thank god for that. I know I looked visibly distressed, my hands were shaking, I blinked furiously just to prove myself I still could, I stared at her hoping it would erase the *things* I had seen playing pretend with her beautiful face. It was getting harder and harder to tell myself it was all in my head but it had to be. I may have been the 'weird' kid of the family but I never believed in ghosts or demons or anything like that, so how else was I supposed to explain what I had been seeing the whole night? Anyway I tried my best to sound calm, rationalized my overwhelming need of escape by telling her it was almost 3AM already, the deadline set by the carnival itself for the end of the 'festivities'.



She couldn't argue with that and I can't even explain to you how relieved I was that she didn't fight me on it as she followed me to the exit. The closer we got to that big gate in between the black fences, with the sign dangling over it, the more I felt like I could breathe. Even if it had all been in my head at least now it was over and I could try to forget all about it, tell myself I hadn't gotten enough sleep in the last week trying to finish the intricate drawing I had launched myself into or that downing one of dad's beers right before Clara asked me to accompany her had been a shitty idea since I'm a notoriously lightweight. Right?



Even I don't understand my mental state at the time. I had been scared shitless, more than I had ever been and I didn't want anything to happen to Clara, ever. But the closer to the gate I got, the more those bad feelings started to ease. The less the air smelled like cotton candy with that disgustingly sweet undertone of apples and rot, the less weight was on my chest, the harder it became to remember in vivid details the things that had scared me so much. I didn't forget, I knew it happened or at least that I saw it, I knew I was scared and I knew we needed out, it just... started to feel like the danger was further away, like I could loosen up at least a little bit, you know. I fucking hate myself for that. I... I should have been running, I should have been horrified, terrified, to the end. I should've held to her hand like a vise until we were back to the bus stop. Hell, until we were back home. I don't know why I didn't. *I don't know* what happened.



We got right at the edge of the gate and all I knew was that I desperately needed a smoke. Fuck trying to quit, it seemed like a really good excuse for one. I started taking the pack out of my back pocket when Clara tugged at the hand I was holding hers with. She looked at me with those big doe eyes she usually reserved for my parents when she *really* wanted something and, thank everything in heaven and earth, she blinked at me, trying to bat her lashes in quiet demand. She said she wanted some cotton candy, for the road, she said. And I don't know what compelled me but I said yes. I had never been good at telling her no and what harm could some sweets do other than a cavity or two. We were getting out, nothing — imagined or not — was going to hurt her anymore.



I gave her a 5€ bill and told her to be quick. I didn't accompany her there, the cotton candy stand was right next to the exit, the first stand that greeted visitors in and the last one to see them off. I remember thinking it was smart business. But worse than that, I remember pulling the pack of smokes from my pocket and stepping out of the gate. 3 steps. I swear, it was only 3 steps from where I had been standing before. She was right there, at the stand. She was so close. It was okay. It should have been okay.



The air was cold again, like... really cold compared to the Carnival and nothing has ever smelled as good to me as the crisp air of the quarry. I lit up my cigarette barely regretting that I was breaking a week-long chain of keeping myself from smoking one, it tasted fucking fantastic and I remember that my hands *finally* stopped shaking. It was over, we were fine and whatever was wrong with me for imagining all those things could wait until the morning to be addressed. A big gust of wind took me by surprise and I was absolutely freezing all of a sudden but I smiled when I turned around to look at Clara. I wanted her to see me happy for once, I wanted her evening to end as well as it had started even though I almost dragged her out of there but... I... I don't... Please, I don't want to...



**IT WAS GONE, OKAY!?**



All of it. The gates, the sign, the cotton candy stand. It wasn't there. **SHE WASN'T THERE.**



It was 3:01AM, the carnival left and it took her with it.



Don't fucking patronize me, I know places can't just disappear, I *know* that, but it did! It did and it took her and now she's not here, anymore. They don't... they said... They said she doesn't exist, that she never did, that she's in my head because... what? Because I needed a substitute to process the childhood I missed from trying not to crumble under the pressure of my father's impossible expectations? Bullshit. She's my sister. MY SISTER. How could I forget her? How could anyone? She was the best of us all and she's gone and all of you are trying to stop me from looking for her now. My parents think I lost it, my father was all too pleased to hide me where his pompous friends couldn't see, everything to protect his reputation. You want to feed me more pills every day like I'm some kind of ginnea pig. But I know something is out there. I know something has her. Please, I just want to find her. Please.



*(recordings seem to abruptly end after that.)*



\_\_\_

Following the session where the recording of Lila \[REDACTED\] was obtained, she exhibited extreme agitation, culminating in an attempt to leap from the office window of her assigned therapist, Dr. \[REDACTED\], situated on the fourth floor. She was restrained and has since been kept under mild sedation at \[REDACTED\] hospital's observation wing. Her condition is being carefully monitored, as she continues to insist that the Carnival has her sister, despite our inability to give her words any credence when it comes to the existence of her sister, one supposed Clara \[REDACTED\]. Her lucid moments are marked by despair and obsessive fixation on finding a way "back to the Carnival," leading to concerns that prolonged exposure to the anomaly may have induced psychosomatic symptoms or metaphysical imprinting.



The anomaly henceforth classified as "The Nameless Carnival" continues to defy traditional containment methods. While Lila’s narrative provides the most comprehensive firsthand account to date, the details align disturbingly well with previous unverified reports spanning decades, including those of previously documented cases available in our files (see case files #YB149-R, #RE097-C and #BB113-R, all archived, as stated prior). Conjecture suggests that the anomaly manifests sporadically, with little to no signs as to its next apparition's location. There doesn't seem to be an explainable logic or reason to this anomaly's comings and goings at present.



Upon further research on the past and nature of this metaphysical anomaly, I have conjectured multiple theories.



The anomaly may exist within a pocket of manipulated space-time, selectively altering the memories or perceptions of those outside of it. This would explain the inability of Lila’s immediate acquaintances to corroborate her claims regarding her sister or the seeming non-existence of many of the supposed victims of the anomaly in past documented and undocumented cases. Evidence from past case files suggests that the Carnival may function as a transient state of existence creating its own pocket dimension between the folds and appearing only when certain conditions are met. This hypothesis is supported by the recurring descriptions of spatial dissonance and impossible architecture noted in Lila’s account and others.



I theorize that the Carnival itself is a sentient or semi-sentient entity, feasting — as its' original name implies — on the unsuspecting carnival goers, effectively stripping their existence and being from them and, theoretically, assimilating their now nameless selves into it's growing cast of 'performers'. It is my belief, after thorough research, that the human shells left behind the gates of the carnival past it's closing time may, in fact, be repurposed by the anomaly as mindless, soulless puppets in its illusion design to manipulate and entrap more humans for the anomaly to feed on, repeating a long lasting cycle.



The possibility that the Carnival is a collective hallucination or possibly a psychically-imposed construct remains under investigation. However, the consistency of accounts across disparate cultures and time periods undermines this hypothesis. The biggest defender of this hypothesis remains case file #BB113-R, archived and previously mentioned, in which the anomaly was reclassified as a Psy-Manipulative type.



According to \[REDACTED\] in his report (see case file #MH078-C, as stated prior), efforts to locate or anticipate the Carnival’s reappearance have been largely unsuccessful. Team Bravo, assigned to the case, continues to investigate previous apparition sites using M.D.A sanctioned investigative methods and interrogations as well as advanced metaphysical scanners and temporal displacement mapping in hopes to retroactively figure out a pattern that could lead the Containment Division to the anomaly's next location before its' closing time.



Lila \[REDACTED\] remains a key subject of interest, and her care remains overseen by Dr. \[REDACTED\], under the surveillance and guidance of M.A.D-RD Senior Researcher \[REDACTED\]. Regular cognitive and metaphysical assessments are being conducted to determine if residual anomalous influence persists, while her mental and physical wellbeing are monitored and maintain to the best of the personnel's abilities. While containment of the Carnival itself remains unattainable at present, understanding its effects on individuals like Lila may provide insights into its origins and nature. Any breakthrough will be communicated directly to the Containment Division Team assigned to the case to assure better odds of tracking and containing the anomaly in the future.



It is my recommendation that any future cases with similar characteristics be reported immediately and investigated by Researchers and Containment Team Leaders familiar with the case (e.g \[REDACTED\] or myself). Given the high risk of disorientation and loss of personnel, further study of Lila’s testimony and associated phenomena should be prioritized to develop a more robust containment strategy. Until then, the 'Nameless Carnival' remains classified as an Uncontained Amber-Class Anomaly and public awareness must be deviated from its' existence to avoid further losses or exploitation of the anomaly by external entities.

***OTR notes:*** *MH absolutely hates carnivals since the carousel event of '18. Not to tell you how to do your job but we've all seen what state he was in back then, checked himself in and refused to check himself out for 3 months. Trust me I know he's one of our best and head office is pushing to give all the finnicky cases to him and I'd prefer working with him than someone else, but if I were you I'd assign him anywhere but \*that\* case, ASAP. I'd rather avoid a repeat performance, for his sake and ours.*
