I feel like I needed to talk about what happened to me and I think you guys are the only ones who'd take me seriously.

I don't remember much about my dad.  Mom left him when I was 10 and took me with her.  I was just a kid but I remember them yelling at each other about something all the time before they broke up.  Mom took me with her and we moved to a different state so I didn't get to see dad much.  At first he'd call me on the weekends but slowly he grew more and more distant.  I think I was 13 the last time I heard his voice, and my 15th birthday was the last time I got a letter from him.  He must have moved because the last letter I sent him got returned.

Then, much to my surprise I  got a letter from a lawyer informing me that my dad committed suicide and I was the sole inheritor in his will.  I wish I could say I cried or even felt sad.  Maybe I still held a grudge for abandoning me, maybe he had been out of my life for so long I stopped caring.

I am a little ashamed to admit I was mostly just excited to get a house in Maine. Once all the paperwork was settled I decided to stay at my new house for a bit.  I didn't tell mom any of this at this point because she wouldn't have approved of me checking out the house.  Anytime I even mentioned Dad she would get very upset.  

Thankfully it was summer and I have to say Maine is beautiful.  The trees as big as any house, a cacophony of smells from all the wildflowers, the mountains in the distance.  At one point on the highway I glanced to my left and saw a luscious green forest below me and a mountain hiding its peak in the clouds off in the distance.  It was truly a sight to behold. Nature isn't all beauty though.  I did spot a coyote muzzle deep in the viscera that once was a deer before a semi-truck hit it.  

As I approached my new house, my excitement died down a bit.  I guess I was expecting a wood cabin or something crazy given how secluded it was. It was a cozy one floor house with a dilapidated front porch.  The red paint was chipping away at spots to show another layer of blue paint underneath. At least none of the windows were broken. The roof was very slanted for the heavy snowfall the area gets.

As I turned the key and opened the door I was hit with a musty smell.  How long has it been since dad was last here? A wave of nostalgia hit me when I saw an ancient recliner with the memory of my father still in it. It was the same one he had when I was a kid. “Guess he didn't abandon everything” I mumbled to myself.

His clothes were still in his drawers, food rotting in the fridge and pantry.  The dishes had been there so long the flies didn't even bother with them anymore.  Looks like his last meal was some T.V. supper, the kind you microwave.

I was tired from the long trip but I couldn't sleep with the smell coming from the kitchen so I spent a while cleaning up. Surprisingly that did not curb my appetite because I was starving at this point. Sadly no one delivered food around here so I had to go for an hour drive to the nearest town with a restaurant.

When I got back the smell in the house was gone. I was tired and decided to go to sleep. It was really weird sleeping in the bed my dad used to sleep in but I didn't have the energy to care.

—---------------------

The next day I was uncharacteristically hungry as soon as I woke up.  I didn't even bother taking a shower before heading out to go grocery shopping.  When I got home as I took off my socks I noticed swelling around my ankles but thought nothing of it. 

There was an old wood stove in the living room that I didn't want to mess with.  The T.V. was relatively new but definitely a cheap brand.  Clearly dad didn't strike it rich while he was gone.

I was going through his stuff when I found a stack of old looking letters. As I grabbed one my heart sank.  It was labeled to me at my old address. They all had “return to sender” stamped on them.

With shaky hands I opened one. Tears started flowing as I read the first line.

“I wish I could talk to you again one last time. I love you so much. This isn't fair. I wanted to see you grow up into a kind and strong man. I wanted to see your first love, your first big success and your first big failure.  I wanted to be with you as you grew up, but I couldn't. I'm so sorry for everything. I can only hope you know I love you and never wanted to leave your life.”

I could only get through half of them before I couldn't continue through the sobbing.  Turns out dad didn't abandon me.  He wanted and tried so hard to stay in my life.

That's when, like a snake swallowing a rat whole, my sadness was eaten up by anger.  I wiped the tears out of my eyes and gave Mom a call hoping that she had a good answer for this.  She always told me she never heard from dad again.  A lie she kept for 15 years.  

Mom - “hi hon, how's it going?”

Me - “why did I find a stack of letters to me at dad's house?”

“what? What are you..”

 “I'm at dad's house right now and I found all the letters he tried to send over the years!”

 “woah slow down.  You're at your dad's? Is he there?”

 “No he's not.  He's dead.  Why? Why mom? Why did these get returned?  How come you never gave him our number?”

 “Wait, your dad killed himself?”

“yea and he didn't leave a note behind so I have no idea what he was thinking.  The pain he was going through alone.  Did you know dad never dated anyone else?”

“hey! That's not fair.  Your dad..”

“Not fair?!  Not letting dad talk to me wasn't fair.”

“honey please I was just trying to protect you..”

“protect me from what?!  No, I don't want to hear your excuses! I'm done talking to you!” 

As I hung up the phone I took a deep breath and focused on my heart rate.  This was just all too much.  What could mom even mean “protect me?” Dad was never abusive and in all his returned letters he only showed me kindness and love.

I wasn't up for anymore exploring inside today.  So I decided a nice long walk would do me good.  I grabbed my compass and made sure I had a signal on my phone before heading out.

The path near my house wound through the seemingly infinite woods and who knows where it ends.  The clean air mixed with mother nature's perfume was a boon to my body and mind.  The trees sang a peaceful duet with the wind.  

I didn't realize how out of shape I let myself get.  I used to be able to walk much further before feeling winded.  That's when I started to hear howling in the distance.  A little freaked out I decided to head home right away.

As the howling crept closer to me I also heard rumbling.  Not knowing what that could be but understanding it wasn't small I started running home.  I was so out of breath but my adrenaline pushed me further.  I did not want to find out what was behind that noise.

About halfway back to my house I realized I just couldn't breathe anymore.  I imagine this is what an asthma attack feels like.  I had to at least get off this trail and fast.  So I tried to quickly stumble through the woods and hide under a big bush I found.

The noise grew louder and louder.  Howling, yipping, and the sound of thousands of soldiers marching at high speeds came towards me.  From my hiding spot I saw them come down the trail.  Seemingly hundreds of beady eyes looking forward and thousands of nasty teeth came down the trail like a tidal wave.  It was a large pack of coyotes.

Suddenly it got quiet.  I fought my body's desperation for air.  Eventually it won and I gasped for breath, but I dared not move otherwise.  A twig snapped underfoot of my impending doom.  I heard sounds of sniffing.  They were close and looking for me.  As one of them approached my hiding spot it made a low growl.  More twigs snapping and leaves shuffling.  The owner of the newest noise started barking wildly.  The bark was high pitch and urgent with a trailing whine. 
 
Once one of them barked, more of them started.  I lay frozen in fear as soon they all joined in.  Suddenly, it was quiet again.  After a few quick heartbeats I heard them running away from where they came from.

Eventually I was able to breathe calmly again and made my way home.

By night time I was exhausted and ready to sleep.  Before I could even lay flat a feeling of approaching death took over me.  It felt like standing on the edge of a cliff, just a small push and I'd be gone.  I tried to ignore it and still lay down but the feeling just wouldn't go away. It got worse as I lay there. I wouldn't know what that feeling meant for a while but I'm glad I listened to it. 

For whatever reason I couldn't sleep in the bed and so I tried dad's old recliner.  It was comfortable enough that in my state of exhaustion it felt like leaning back on a cloud.


—---------------------

 I continued searching through dad's things.  That's when I discovered his personal journal alongside a black hardcover book.  Flipping through the hardcover book I found it was all blank pages.  I quickly lost interest and picked up the journal.  As I opened it I felt like I was invading his privacy but I also wanted to learn why he ended his own life. 

Early on he wrote about his daily life and his attempts to connect with me.  Turns out he tried all sorts of things, even hiring a P.I. to find me.  Sadly legally he couldn't do anything since mom had full custody of me.

This part caught my eye:

“I've been swindled again!  My health problems are going to cost me everything I have.  Someone answered my post online asking for help and they offered to sell me the cure.  Like a fool I contacted them immediately and paid up front.  They sent me this book with nothing written inside.  Just a plain looking black hardcover book with about 100 pages all blank.”

A few days later in the journal

“Something weird is going on.  I was going to throw the book into the fire but as I did so I noticed something strange.  There was a big splinter in my finger from the wood and it caused me to bleed a drop onto the book.  As soon as it landed the book flew open.  Red scribbling started to fill the page.  It looked as if it was using my blood as ink.  I couldn't make heads or tails of what was written.”

The last entry in the journal.

“The book mentions all my ailments and does provide a cure for it.  It's definitely some occult stuff but I've dealt with the occult before.  Plus I don't have much to lose.  At worst I feel foolish, at best I get cured.  It wasn't hard to gather all the materials, I'm not sure on how to say most of the things I'm supposed to say, but I'm determined to make this work.”

I've always been pretty skeptical of the paranormal.  I figured dad was pretty desperate to actually attempt the ritual. Based on the date of that entry it must have been a few days before he died.  I had to see what dad saw in the book.  I really hoped he did find a cure and there was some other reason he took his life.

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and made a small cut on my hand.  Holding it over the book I let a blood drop splash its surface.  It immediately sprung open like it was waiting for me.  Just like dad described, the blood thinned out and filled in the page with writing and diagrams.  

The most noticeable thing was a weird looking symbol towards the bottom.  There was an incomplete triangle at the upper part and below it looked like an upside down sickle. This was all inside of a circle.

You first draw the symbol in the blood of a goat. Then recite this phrase “wheif pab’tusu bism bro’gm”. After putting a drop of your own blood in the middle of the symbol. The book says doing so will “bring you into health.”

I wanted to sleep on it and decide whether I should try it myself or not.  The bed still gave me that doom feeling so I slept in dads chair again.  Strangely enough that night I had a dream about dad, at least I think it was dad.  He had gray hair and wrinkles that spoke of his age, but his voice was just like I remembered it.

He told me “please do the ritual, and soon.  I'm so sorry for everything.  Please don't hate your mother, she did nothing wrong.  I was wrong and I should never have…” that's when I woke up.

—---------------------

Before even opening my eyes I felt wetness in the bed.  I was horrified, I'm a grown ass man.  I haven't wet the bed since I was 4.  

As I threw the blanket off of myself I immediately saw my legs both swelled up like balloons.  There were some huge blisters on my calves and some of them must have popped in the night.  The liquid I thought was urine was coming from the blisters.  It was clear and didn't have a smell but did feel a little oily.  Like if someone watered down baby oil.

That was the final straw. I had to go to the hospital.  I hate hospitals, they only remind me of death and sadness.   That faint miasma that permeates the otherwise sterile smell.  The sounds of the sick and dying, along with loved ones mourning their last days together.  

The doctors ran an EKG on me to check my heart.  They couldn't find anything wrong with me besides my legs being swollen and leaking fluids.  They gave me some medication to help with the swelling and cleaned up and bandaged my open sores.  Then they said there was nothing else they could do, and staying to just make sure would cost me more than I had. 

At the time I was pretty pissed because it felt like they weren't taking me seriously.  An EKG is only a snapshot of your heart.  What about blood work or an MRI?  It wasn't like I had a cold.

Maybe if I stayed things would be different now, or I might be dead.

—--------

A few days went by and I kept telling myself that the medication would work and I'd be back to normal soon.  Or so I wished.  Instead not only did the swelling and leaking not stop, but I also had pain now too.  It felt like it was coming from below my diaphragm, each breath produced a new stabbing sensation.

Given all that happened recently I debated just waiting for the inevitable when I remembered what dream dad said.

Thankfully I already had everything I needed.  After the hospital visit I decided to stop by the butcher.  I wasn’t sure at the time if I’d actually use it, but I’m glad I got it.  At this point I don’t think I could manage driving my car or going anywhere in my condition.

I went to the clean tile floor in the kitchen and started drawing the symbol from the book.  Every breath was agony, I couldn't bend my knees from the swelling, and I was short on breath which didn't help with the pain.  I remember thinking to myself “I'm sorry for whatever I did to deserve this.  This is hell”.  I had no idea what hell actually was.

With the symbol done I pricked my finger for a drop of blood in the middle of it.   “wheif pab’tusu bism bro’gm” as the words left my mouth so too did the light from my eyes.

—---------------------

I felt myself flat against a cold metallic slab.  The smell in the room was lavender fighting to hold back the smell of rot.  I tried to open my eyes but all I saw was darkness.  Before I could even register what happened to me a sharp object was cutting into my chest from the top of my sternum.  I screamed in agony, or so I tried.  I couldn't move a muscle, just sit there and endure it.

That's when I felt there was a tube going down my throat that was breathing for me.  Pushing the walls of my throat to their limit.  The sharp object was traveling down to my groin leaving a clean cut in its wake.  I imagine this is what that deer I saw the other day felt.  Liquid began dripping from my chest and pooling at my sides. 

Something began cutting through my sternum which thankfully didn't really hurt.  Once they cut through completely the agonizing pain started.  They pushed each side of my ribs further out as if to access my lungs.  I felt organs moving and squishing under the pressure.

With my insides laid completely bare I heard something besides my own gore.  It was a sound like a baby crying underwater,  along with musical tones that held for a few seconds each.

Whatever was brutalizing me grabbed onto the foreign thing inside of me.  Seconds became hours as they pulled it out of me.  Whatever it was, it went deep.  I felt it from my calves to my abdomen.  If you've ever swallowed a hair and then pulled it out you have an inkling of what I felt.  Except instead of a few inches out of my mouth it was a few feet and from my stomach area.

Suddenly I could move again.  In my panic I tried to swing my arms wildly to get whatever it was to stop.  As I finally opened my eyes I realized I was in dads bed.  I could breath fine, my legs were back to normal, I wasn't starving.  My chest felt sore but besides that I felt fantastic.

Deciding I just had a very weird and vivid dream I started my morning routine by taking a shower.  With my shirt off and looking at the mirror I noticed a large scar from the bottom of my neck to my groin.  

I shuddered.  That had to be a dream.  I couldn't live through that.  The scar must have been there and I just never noticed.  That strange book must have given me nightmares.

After my shower I was going to throw the book into the fire but something compelled me to open it again.  It still had the ritual on the page but something new towards the back of the book.

“Son, I'm so sorry for everything.  I fucked up.  Your mom was right.  The debt must be paid but I couldn't handle it anymore.  I didn't feel any symptoms until recently but when they do show up you need to do the ritual every 10 years.  I tried to end it all but the debt was just passed onto you.  I'm so sorry and I hope you can forgive me one day.”
