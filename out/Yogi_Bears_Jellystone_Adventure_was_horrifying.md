Bobbert was a good friend of mine.

In my adult years, Bob was teaching at a high school that I used to go to until he was let go 

because of a argument with another worker. He was given a generous sum of money before his departure which he used to fund his favorite hobby.

Urban exploring.

I used to joke with him by asking if he was ballsy enough to sneak into Disney's Discovery Island. Bobbert would respond by telling me that he had children and how they would get angry if he got banned off of Disney Land. 

Every abandoned home or deserted theme park that he visited, he would report what he found. To him, this sort of thing was a passion to him and while there was the risk of being  caught and charged for trespassing, no one was the wiser or didn't care.

I was curious about the trips Bob made and at this time, I was facing burnout from my usual hobbies which was why I was excited when he invited me to do some exploring at a shut down resort known as Yogi Bear's Jellystone Adventure. 

Me and my sister were taken there in our young years and we loved it. 

It's still around, but its now owned by a different company, a new name, and another location thats too far away for me to get to. It doesn't matter as I outgrew most of the activities that were in that place. Its kinda sad really.

The resort was a hybrid between a camping ground and a water park. Besides the latter, it had a giant lake where you could fish, a golfing course, a cafeteria, and there were several events that played out throughout the day.

I remember the treasure hunt I participated in and how there were cameos involving other Hannah Barbera characters such as Scooby Doo who occassionally showed up to join in on the fun. I remember how the costumed characters would walk around and greet us by waving in our direction.

I also remembered how we rented out a cabin instead of sleeping in a tent which was amazing because the deluxe cabin came with a free breakfast per day. 

Of course, there were stories of less then pleasant experiences. One example that comes to mind is the story I heard (in my school) where one of the actors got bored and tried to imitate Yogi Bear from the cartoon. 

You can imagine how that turned out when complaints were filed after a mother notified "Ranger Smith" that "Yogi" was peeking from behind a bush (to steal the average picnic basket) while their kid was eating. This terrified the child enough that the family vacation was cut short. 

The person in costume got in trouble for this and restrictions on what can be done with the suits were put in place to prevent another incident like this. 

Sadly, on the following year the place shut down. Why? The owner lost interest in the resort and didn't want to pay the yearly licensing fee to use Hannah Barbera characters. Whats even weirder is that the announcement was sudden without any warning. 

The land itself was sold off to a mysterious buyer who is unknown to this day to the public. 

\---

I arrived that afternoon as I was close to the location from where I lived. I soon passed by the statue of Yogi Bear which surprised me to still see it intact. Usually when a license isn't renewed, a company will request a video where all the props get smashed or burned down. It was a relief to see that the gluttonous bear statue was fine.

As soon as I parked my truck at one of the many empty lots, I noticed there were a couple of camping tents pitched up around the area. At first, it made me think the resort was still in  business until I noticed that no one seemed to be inside any of them.

There were also no signs discouraging trespassing, so anyone could come in here and mistake the place for being operational despite being closed off long ago. 

I was confused to why these tents were here until Bob snuck up from behind to give me a surprise.

"GOTCHA!" He howled as I turned around. 

I was about to throw a punch until I realized who it was.

"You shouldn't do that! I could of hit you by mistake!"

Bob gave out a mild sigh before apologizing. We caught up on somethings before I questioned him about the tents.

"Oh yeah. About that. Some people sneak in to try to camp out here. The rangers though keep coming by to chase them off. Luckily, I know their schedule and they're not due to return for a couple of days."

"I think we should check the tents to see if anything is inside them!" I said feeling mischievious.

"Trust me. You don't want to. I tried that already and a squirrel came running out! I'm lucky I didn't get bitten and have to get treated for it!" Bob replied.

"Good point. What should we look at instead?"

I followed Bob as we set out to the big lake. It was the most familiar part of the trip to me as I remember swimming in the water while my parents were fishing close by. 

I also remembered the rental pontoon boats and how we took one out to enjoy the breeze and the water. Good times.

As we took the hiking path around that lake, I spotted a pontoon stranded in the middle. I took my camera, zoomed in, and noticed a big dent in it. 

Bob theorized that another pontoon must of clashed with someone elses which I agreed with as there wasn't another explanation to how that happened. I took a couple pictures before we finished our loop and arrived in the playground area.

The playground could be summed up as the central hub that connected to other parts of the resort. Signs would point guests in the direction of the water park, the golfing course, the cafe, the lake that we came from, and the various campgrounds that offered different scenery.

The play area itself was divided up into three sections. One for younger children, one for older kids, and one for teens. The young section had Smurfs, the middle, Yogi Bear, and the older, Scooby Doo.

In the corner of the Scooby Doo area was the iconic Mystery Machine that looked  accurate to the cartoon. The passages of time sadly caused some of the vans paint to peel off, but that wasn't the campgrounds fault. 

I remember Bob daring me to go up on the equipment, but the fear of it crumbling under my size made me decline. Bob tried goading me into doing his dare and even tried offering money. Nope. I wasn't budging and he didn't want to try either, so we moved on to the golf course.

Since the field had been unattended, it was overgrown with weeds and tall grass. The rental booth still had a fair share of golf balls, but someone had taken all of the clubs. Since we couldn't do a proper game, we looked around for a bit until we spotted something sticking out of the grass. 

It was the bones of a deceased dog who perished from mysterious circumstances. Everything on its skin had been picked clean by passing vultures.

At the water park, the wave pool had been contaminated with green water. swamp grass was starting to grow and the smell made us both stay far away. Since everything was shut off, there wasn't a real point in staying.

Bob interrupted as we returned to the playground once more.

"Hey I have to take a piss and check on something. You're free to keep looking around without me, but lets meet up at the cafe. I wanna be with you when we go there."

"Sure. I see no problem with that."

Now by myself, a thought came to mind. I never bothered to take a picture of that Scooby Doo van. I cautiously approached The Mystery Machine and prayed that something wasn't in there. I snapped a photo. I got closer to get a picture from all sides and as I continued to take photos, I had the idea of taking pictures from the inside. 

As I inched closer and closer, the back of the van's door had a dent in it. Since none of the vehicles doors were opened, I finally gathered the courage to take pictures of the inside to find the first oddity of the trip.

Inside were signs that all read the same thing. 

"No Trespassing. Private Property. Violators will be prosected under the criminal trespass section of the law."

Someone had gone to the trouble of taking all of the signs posted down and placing them into this van. 

"If someone got caught snooping around, they could claim there were no signs around to get out of trouble." 

I theorized for a bit before I decided on my next stop. The camping grounds themselves.

When I arrived, I was caught off guard by the amount of camping tents. 

"Did all of these people really try to sneak in after the place closed?" I asked myself. 

Despite the unease, I ignored Bob's warned and unzipped one of the abandoned tents. Inside several belongings laid on the floor including a backpack that had a Game Boy Advance. Don't judge me, but I wasn't going to pass on that and snatched it.

Another camping ground had a smaller lake which looped around in a 10 to 20 minute walk. There were even more tents surrounding the water with fishing poles close by. Despite the amount of tents still up, I didn't really question it much until I found that one campsite.

Several objects had been tossed over, a hammock laid torn on the ground, food was left uncovered to rot, and a tent had several rip and tears. It was like a struggle or a fight had broken out and for the first time, I was uncomfortable.

Why were there so many tents? Were these really people trying to sneak in? How long had they been left here? 

What made me turn the way I came was when a thought ringed into my head.

"What if they were here when the camping resort was still operational. If that was the case, what made everyone quick to leave without grabbing a single thing?"

I had to find Bob.

As I made my way to the planned meeting spot (the cafe) to warn Bob, I walked past the few cabins along the pathway. From one of them, a horrible stench emitted. I'll never understand why I jimmied the lock with the tools I had on me. Despite my paranoia, my curiosity at this point was still stronger. 

Perhaps it was a good thing because I would have never realized the danger I was in when I opened that door to find the large bones littering the wooden floor. 

They were all similar to the dog back at the golfing course and even thought they had been left here for ages, the stench almost made me throw up. 

I quickly left the cabin and turned my walking into running.

"BOBBERT!" I yelled out

I wasn't going to abandon my friend. I had to warn him of my discovery.

I quickly made it to the cafes entrance to see Bob standing at the front entrance.

"We have to leave! It isn't safe!" I called out.

"We just got here. There's more to discover that no one else has found!"

I tried to explain before I got cut off.

"You could have been bitten!" Bob yelled out as he started inching his way closer to the cafe.

"BOBBERT! LISTEN TO ME! WE'RE NOT SAFE!" I shouted.

"You're just being paranoid!" he scowled at me annoyed.

Nothing was getting through to him as he started to head inside. I rushed after  until we reached the cafeteria itself. The room had several tables and a stage show that I never had a chance of seeing back when my family arrived as it had been completely booked.

"Look. I can show you what I found." I pleaded.

"I'm good. Come! You finally have a chance to see the show! We can check behind the stage! Maybe we'll find some costumes that we can sell for a profit."

How did he know about that? More alarms were going off and by following Bobbert, I had endangered myself. I refused to take another step and after standing there, Bob tried waving me over until I backed away.

"I'm sorry Bobbert, but I'm heading home." I said.

I turned around to make my exit when Bob suddenly grabbed me from behind. The initial shock and paranoia caused me to throw a punch without looking. 

Bob let go of me as he staggered for a bit before he looked at me desperately. 

"Please! You can't leave! You have to come with me! He'll be angry if I let you go!"

I didn't have a chance to ask what he meant as he made a lunge towards me. This time, he pinned me to the floor and attempted to restrain me. 

"This isn't anything personal, but you're not l...."

I took my chance and nailed him in the groin before he could finish his sentence. I then delivered a kick to the chest and sent him falling off of me. 

I rushed out of the cafe as I could hear Bob screaming. Something was tearing away at his flesh. Whatever it was, there were multiples of it. 

Whatever Bob had been "friends" with, it was now hungry. I don't know how I managed to escape, but the next thing I knew, I was in my car driving off. As I was about to leave and never return, I looked into the rearview mirror to see several figures who would give me nightmares for years to come.

There were people dressed up as Scooby Doo, a smurf I didn't recognize, Jabberjaw, Snagglepuss, Huckleberry Hound, and Yogi Bear who was front in center. Every costume had blood spots with each actor looking deformed. The deformities in the brief second I looked caused multiple holes of the costumes to rip open which exposed lumpy bits of flesh.

Whatever they were, they watched me take off without moving from their spot.

I never told anyone about my trip and I never reported Bobbert's disappearance. I simply moved on and acted oblivious when several news outlets asked viewers with information to contact the authorities.

Before it all died down, I asked myself one question.

Why was Bobbert helping those things? What was he getting out of it?"

There was a good reason why that place never reopened. It wasn't because of a licensing expiration, it was because of what happened on those grounds.
