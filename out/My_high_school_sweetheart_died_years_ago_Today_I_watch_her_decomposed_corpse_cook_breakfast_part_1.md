**October 1, 2024**

I have no idea what to do, and it’s driving me mad.

Where do I even begin?

Well, I came home that day fairly exhausted. So far, it was success, they liked my proposal—but God, it drained me. All I wanted was a drink, maybe five minutes of silence.

I pushed the door open with my free hand as I carried my briefcase. My daughter, Penny, ran passed me as she eagerly entered the house.

“Laurie!” She squealed happily as she embraced my…guest’s legs. 

The thing—*she*—bent down and patted Penny’s head with a smile. Fingers too long, skin stretched thin like wet paper over cracked bones.

Laurie, that was a nickname she came up for her.

Penny ran up to her room. Now it was just me and *her.*

Lauren’s eyes. Milky, but she could see in great clarity, settled on me.

“Welcome home,” she said, lips curling into a familiar, unnatural smile.

“Y-Yeah. Thanks,” I stuttered.

She lifted her arms slightly—an invitation to hand over my coat and briefcase. Her skin split at the elbow when she moved, some places withered, the sight of old cavities caused by maggots marred some places. 

Hesitantly, I gave them to her. Despite the state of her body, she moved smoothly to the coat rack and hung them.

“Dinner will be ready in a moment.”

Her voice… it was *almost* hers. But warped, like it had been stitched together from old recordings with a shitty audio editor.

“That’s…that’s nice. Whatcha’ making?”

She turned slightly, half-rotted lips pulling into a grin. “Meatloaf.” 

She wore my sister’s old clothes—jeans and a faded hoodie with “COLUMBIA” peeling off the front—but it didn’t hide the fact that *a fucking corpse* was making dinner in my house.

I had Penny back when I was working in West Virginia. Met her mom during a dull corporate retreat. The marriage didn’t last. When I got full custody, I thought a change of pace might be good. New Hampshire called to me like a whisper from a photo album—so I bought my childhood home, moved in two months ago.

It was surreal, being able to buy back your childhood home and move into it 2 months ago. It brought back memories. 

Old memories of us. The day I first met her back in '05—when I was a freshman who gave her a water bottle after she was doing track and field.

“Hey, silly. You’re spacing out again, hehe.”

She chuckled, as if not sensing my discomfort as she waved a rotting hand in front of my face.

“Dinner is ready, call Penny down.”

I nodded wordlessly and headed up the stairs, each creaking step like a countdown. At my daughter’s door, I gave a soft knock.

“Dinner’s ready, sweetheart.”

I didn’t want to test what would happen if I disobeyed her. 

The mind of a child, it certainly works differently than an adult’s. When a kid sees a bear, they don’t see danger, they see a big cuddly friend. When they see a walking, half-rotten corpse—apparently, they see a new best friend.

I sat at the dinner table, barely touching my plate, absently pushing a lump of meatloaf around with my fork like it might bite me first.

“I got a gold star today, Daddy!” Penny beamed, her face lit up like Christmas. Across the table, *it* clapped its hands and smiled—a grotesque mimicry of maternal warmth.

“That’s amazing!” said…Lauren.

“I raised my hand three times in class,” Penny babbled on proudly. “And I helped Mrs. Tyler carry all the papers!”

“That’s great, honey. I’m proud of you,” I forced a smile. 

There she is—sitting and dining with us, cooking dinner, and asking about my day as if nothing was wrong, that everything was ‘normal.’ It’s been like this for a few weeks now.

It happened on the first few weeks of moving back here. Penny claimed to have an imaginary friend, one who lived inside the walls.

Believing that it was the overactive imagination of a child—I didn’t think much of it at first. I just smiled and played along with my daughter’s antics.

“Say hi to her in the walls for me,” I would say. “Oh? What’s your friend’s name?”

“Lauren,” she said cheerfully.

I laughed. Nervously.

Then came the drawings.

Then came the drawings. All of which depicting her friend who lived inside the walls.

Pages and pages of crude sketches—wide eyes, long blonde hair, half-buried in walls like she was growing out of them. In every drawing, “Lauren” stood beside Penny, holding hands. Smiling.

Not only that—her friend said she *knew* me.

The first thought that came to mind was—oh hell no.

Then that *night.*

It was around 2 a.m. I heard banging from the kitchen. Glass shattering.

Thinking it was the wind or maybe a raccoon, I went downstairs to check—only to find two strangers in my home. Two burglars. They tore through the cabinets, rifled drawers, careless and frantic.

I bolted upstairs, locked the bedroom, held Penny tight against my chest as I dialed the cops with shaking hands.

The noise below continued, loud and violent. It felt like it lasted forever. Then—just one scream. Female. High-pitched. And then… silence.

I kissed Penny’s head. Told her to stay put. She clung to me, begged me not to go.

But I had to know.

I took a bat and crept downstairs, every step heavy with dread.

What I saw, I will never forget.

One of the two robbers—I could see her face clearly. Her eyes were wide to the point they seemed they could pop out. Her body spasmed with chokes and gasps for air. She was suspended from the ground, something was holding her against the wall.

That’s when I saw her, *it,* for the first time. 

Half of her body looked like it was phased into the wall. Her arms wrapped around the woman, holding her in place.

Blood, lots of it—ran down her chin and neck to the floor as she sunk her teeth into the woman’s neck.

I never saw the other one. Maybe he ran. Maybe he didn’t make it out.

“Elliot? Are you okay?”I shook the thoughts out of my head. Lauren and Penny’s eyes were on me—I must’ve spaced out thinking about the whole ordeal.

“Yeah. Never better,” I assured them with a smile.

To be honest, had this been any situation, I would’ve been somewhat…comfortable.

But for now—I will pretend. For the sake of my daughter. For the sake of myself. I will pretend.

Yeah, this fine. 

It should be if I play along.
