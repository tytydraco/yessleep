My brother died six years ago. He was seventeen. Drunk driver, highway shoulder, over in seconds. I won’t get into the grief; that’s not what this is about. This is about what started happening two weeks ago, after my daughter was born.

We bought this old farmhouse last year. It’s the kind of place with creaky floors and drafty windows, and honestly? That’s part of why we liked it. My wife and I thought it had “character.” The nursery used to be a study, tucked upstairs in the back of the house. Quiet, removed. Perfect, we thought.

We set up a baby monitor—a cheap audio one, not a camera. I’m not paranoid, just cautious. I like knowing if she’s crying before the full-on banshee scream begins. But a few nights ago, I started hearing something that wasn’t crying.

It was a voice. Male. Soft. Whispering.

The first night, I chalked it up to interference. This house is old—maybe it was picking up a neighbor’s radio. But it wasn’t static or chatter. It said her name. “Ellie.” Just once. Like someone checking if she was asleep.

I didn’t tell my wife. Not yet. What do you even say? “Hey, I think our baby monitor is haunted”?

The next night, it spoke again. Same voice. This time, a little clearer.

“It’s okay, Ellie. Don’t cry. I’m here.”

I went into the nursery. Nothing. She was asleep, breathing slow, peaceful. The monitor was silent now, like it knew I was listening too hard.

On the fourth night, I recorded it. Sat up with the monitor plugged into my laptop and hit record. I didn’t even have to wait long.

“It’s okay, I’m watching her. You can sleep.”

That voice—it was his. My brother. Caleb.

I didn’t believe it until I heard the way he said my name. The same half-laugh in it. The same cadence. I hadn’t heard it in years, but when I played it back, it was unmistakable. “Jake. It’s okay.”

That’s when I told my wife. She listened. She didn’t cry, but her hands trembled. She’d only met Caleb once, but she remembered his voice.

We tried unplugging the monitor. It didn’t matter. We heard it anyway, like the signal had settled into the walls.

The monitor still whispers most nights. Sometimes it sings—half-remembered lullabies our mother used to sing to us. Sometimes it just hums. It always sounds calm, gentle.

Until last night.

Last night, I woke to Ellie screaming.

Not crying—screaming.

We both ran into the nursery. She was in the corner, pressed up against the wall like she was trying to escape the crib. The monitor was on the floor. Still on.

I picked it up and heard it—Caleb’s voice, but different now. Urgent. “He’s here. Jake, get her out. Now.”

Then silence. Dead air.

We’re staying at a hotel now. I don’t know who “he” is. I don’t want to find out.

But tonight, the monitor’s light blinked on again.

And it’s not Caleb’s voice anymore.
