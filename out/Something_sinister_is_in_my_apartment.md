I was always intrigued by the supernatural, but little did I know that my curiosity would lead me to a nightmare that would haunt me for the rest of my life.

It all began when I moved into a rundown apartment building. My apartment was on the top floor, and it was a small space with one bedroom, a kitchen, and a bathroom. As soon as I entered the apartment, I could feel a chill running down my spine. The air felt thick and heavy, as if someone was watching me.

The first few days were uneventful, but as the nights went on, I started hearing strange noises coming from the walls. It sounded like something was scratching at the walls, trying to claw its way inside. I tried to ignore it, thinking that it was just the old pipes in the building, but the noises only grew louder and more frequent.

One night, I woke up to find a shadowy figure standing in the corner of my room. It was tall and thin, with glowing red eyes that pierced through the darkness. Its mouth twisted into a grotesque grin, revealing razor-sharp teeth.

I was frozen with fear, unable to move or speak. The figure started to move closer to me, and I could feel its breath on my face. Just as it was about to touch me, it disappeared into thin air.

After that night, I started having vivid nightmares. I dreamt of being chased by the figure, of being trapped in a room with no way out, and of being buried alive. The nightmares were so real that I would wake up drenched in sweat, feeling as if I had just escaped death.

As the days went on, I started to notice that things were moving in my apartment. Objects would be moved from one place to another, and sometimes they would disappear altogether. I would hear whispers coming from the walls, as if someone was trying to communicate with me.

I tried to ignore it all, thinking that I was just imagining things. But then, one night, things took a turn for the worse. I woke up to find the figure standing at the foot of my bed, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light. It reached out its hand and touched my forehead, and I felt a cold sensation spreading through my body.

I tried to scream, but my voice was gone. The figure started to laugh, a low, menacing sound that echoed through the room. And then, just like that, it disappeared.

The next morning, I woke up with scratches and bruises all over my body. I went to the hospital, but the doctors couldn't explain what had happened to me. They said that it was probably just a case of sleepwalking or self-harm, but I knew that it was something more sinister.

I started to do some research, trying to find out what was happening to me. I discovered that my apartment building was built on the site of an old cemetery, and that there had been reports of strange occurrences in the area for decades.

I decided to reach out to some paranormal investigators, hoping that they could help me. They came to my apartment with their equipment, and as soon as they entered the space, they could feel the presence of something dark and malevolent.

They set up their cameras and recording devices, and as soon as they started to investigate, things started to get even more disturbing. They captured images of shadowy figures moving through the apartment, and they heard voices coming from the walls.

One night, as I was sleeping, I felt a cold hand on my shoulder. I opened my eyes to find myself face to face with the figure. Its eyes were glowing brighter than ever, and its mouth was twisted into a sinister grin.

I tried to scream, but the figure put its hand over my mouth. It whispered.
