I moved into this apartment because it was cheap. Too cheap. The landlord didn’t even ask for a deposit — just first month’s rent and a signature. He said the building was “unique” and that I’d appreciate the quiet.

He wasn’t lying. The walls are thick, the neighbors silent. But the windows… they don’t look outside.

Instead, they show a hallway. A long, dim corridor lined with doors I’ve never seen from inside the building. At first, I thought it was some kind of architectural trick. Maybe the windows were fake, like mirrors or projections. But when I pressed my hand against the glass, it was cold. Real.

Every night, around 3:17 a.m., the lights in that hallway flicker. A door opens. I can’t hear anything, but I see shadows moving. Sometimes they stop right in front of my window, as if they’re staring in.

Last night, I taped paper over the glass. When I woke up, the paper was gone. In its place was a note, written backwards, so I could only read it in the reflection:

“Stop watching. We can see you too.”

I tried to follow the hallway. I walked every floor, every stairwell, every emergency exit. Nothing matched what I saw through the glass.

But then I noticed something: the hallway in my window has more doors than yesterday. I counted. Twelve. Tonight, there were thirteen.

When the lights flickered, the thirteenth door opened. A figure stepped out. Tall, thin, wearing something like a hospital gown. It didn’t move at first. Then it raised its hand and pressed it against the glass.

The window was freezing. Too cold. Like the figure was touching me through it.

I stumbled back, heart pounding. When I looked again, the figure was gone. But the thirteenth door stayed open, and the hallway seemed darker than before.

I asked my neighbor if her windows looked outside. She laughed nervously and said she didn’t have windows at all.

Later, I knocked on her door. No answer. But through my window, I saw her door in the hallway. It opened. She walked out, eyes blank, moving like she was sleepwalking.

She stopped in front of my window and whispered something I couldn’t hear. Then the figure in the hospital gown appeared behind her. It placed its hand on her shoulder. She froze.

When I checked her apartment the next day, it was empty. Completely empty. No furniture. No trace she’d ever lived there.

I asked the landlord about her. He looked confused. Said there was never a tenant in that unit.

The notes keep coming. Always backwards, always taped to the inside of the glass.

Last night’s said: “Join us.”

I don’t know why, but I touched the window. It wasn’t cold this time. It was soft. Like skin.

The hallway lights flickered. Every door opened at once. Shadows poured out, filling the corridor. They pressed against the glass, dozens of hands, faces, mouths.

And then, for the first time, I heard them. A chorus of whispers, all saying the same thing:

“Step through.”

I yanked my hand back, but the glass stayed warm.

I don’t know how much longer I can resist. The hallway grows every night. More doors, more shadows. The notes are piling up.

I tried covering the window with a blanket. In the morning, the blanket was gone. In its place was my own handwriting, backwards:

“You already belong here.”

I don’t remember writing it. But my pen was on the floor.

Tonight, I’m going to stay awake until 3:17. If the window opens… I don’t know if I’ll be able to stop myself from stepping through.
