In 2021, around August, there was a 45-minute-long video that was released on YouTube. Not many people saw the video, and before it could gain more views, it was terminated.

The video starts with a friendly “Hello!” in a calming voice, similar to that of YouTube channel *Daily Dose of Internet*. The officer is driving in his car, narrating his day as a cop through his police camera. The video proceeds as usual, driving around, stopping people from speeding, fairly normal.

There was one thing that stood out: the officer was called in for a gang selling drugs. The video cuts forward in time to show the cop confronting the gang members in a parking lot. The background appears to be outside an auto-mechanical store, seemingly in a city. The footage is recorded through the officer’s camera as he confronts two men who have already opened the trunk of their car. Strangely, the video then cuts to the middle of a desert highway, it's unknown what happened to the gang members or that confrontation.

Cars pass by on the highway as suddenly the officer, in his calming voice, says, “Over there, you can see a group of robbers running away.” The officer continues narrating as, without warning, he drives toward the group of masked men fleeing the scene. The men wear typical robber uniforms, fancy, colorful suits, and cover their faces with winter ski masks, with only their mouths and eyes visible. As the officer continues driving toward the robbers, *BAM!* he immediately runs over one of them, driving over his body with a loud *thump*. One of the robbers, wearing dark beige clothing, possibly hearing this, runs farther away as the officer, still narrating, says, “I couldn’t let this guy run away, so I continued.”

The officer keeps driving forward, chasing down what looks like the last man running in the video. As the police car closes in, the robber turns his head toward it. eyes wide, mouth gasping from exhaustion, as suddenly the audio emphasizes his heavy breathing in low quality. The camera, now recording through the car window, focuses on the robber’s frightened expression before suddenly, *BAM!* The car hits him from the side, flinging the man forward. Before the masked man can react, the car drives over his body. Something like a watermelon explodes as the pieces bounced across the cop car.

The car turns, showing the bodies of the fleeing men from its view, puddles of crimson and streaks of red on the road. Passing vehicles either stop or continue driving as the officer suddenly says, “There was one more robber left, and I couldn’t let him get away, so I chased after him.” As he says that, he drives over the discarded bodies, cars passing or stopping as he goes by.

He continues driving straight. In the distance, a man is running away wearing a dark blue suit and mask. He’s out of shape and clutching a large bag. The officer drives forward as the man runs toward the passing cars in a panic.

His panicked eyes glance sideways toward the car. Still holding the bag, with a tumultuous crash, the car consumes him. His head and arm bounce off the window, the lighting of the hot, Arizona-like sun emphasizing the red of the remains. The officer, having finished his task, drives onward in silence.

Finally, in the same calm voice as ever, he says, “Thank you for watching. I hope you all have a good day, and that this video was somewhat educational,” before the video cuts out.
