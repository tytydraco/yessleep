Anyone want to weigh in on a creepy encounter I had years ago that I still wonder about? 

For context, I’m female and I was probably about 19 years old at the time.

Years ago, I was out walking my dog. I worked late, so I usually had to walk him when it was already dark out. There weren’t a lot of times where I really felt unsafe though, despite my dog, Reese, being very mild tempered and unlikely to defend me in a bad situation. This was a middle-class suburban Texas neighborhood and I had been walking my dogs there basically all my life.  

I remember it had rained recently and the yard lights that most everyone had on were reflecting off the puddles giving everything kind of a dreamy feel. I don’t know if anyone will know what I’m talking about when I say this, but yard lights sometimes make it harder to see at night, especially with them reflecting off puddles. Like, you can see in the areas that are lit, but the light kind of messes with your eyes leaving black shadows if you’re trying to look beyond the light where you can’t see a thing! 

Anyway, despite being in a well populated area, most people were asleep, or at least quietly in their houses by that time, so it could be quite solitary. You’d occasionally pass another quiet dog-walker, but not every night, and if so, only one. While Reese didn’t care who we passed, my previous dog was very reactive to other dogs and sometimes even people on his walks, and would create a lot of embarrassing barking. Despite him having passed away at this point, I was still trained to watch for anyone we might encounter and make a quick turn down a cul-de-sac or something to keep the peace. 

So I’m walking along looking up at stars and thinking about random things when suddenly, I think I see shadowy movement way up the road. It’s a little far off to truly tell, but regardless there’s no where to turn anyway. I keep walking; Reese continues on with his inspection of mailbox smells. 

Oh, I suppose I should mention that this is a two way, single lane for traffic going either direction road with no sidewalks. We haven’t passed a single car the entire night. 

By this point I can tell it’s an adult human with no dog walking towards me. With how dark it is, normally I wouldn’t be able to tell if they were walking towards or away from me, but they have a give away: they’re wearing glasses and I can see the light reflecting off them! Ah ha! 

Well great. Still no where to turn off, and I don’t particularly want to just turn around and just have this person just forever be behind me the rest of the walk, so I decide to just pass them and get it over with.

It’s still not great in terms of visibility, but I’m now thinking that this person is a tall man. I couldn’t say what truly lead me to that conclusion, but it does enter my mind that this is a lone male and I’m a lone female and despite being surrounded by people, we feel very alone. Reese is there and I love him, but like I said, I don’t know that he’s got my back, and I’m suddenly thinking about that out of the blue. 

We are now almost to the point to being directly passing each other, this silent man and I-one going one way down the road, the other on the other side, going the opposite direction. Right at the moment of passing, Reese’s ears perk and he tugs on his leash toward the stranger with his tail at alert. 

The glasses man suddenly stops. 

And does something so minor and yet so very creepy at the same time. 

He starts walking backwards, matching our pace completely. 

Reese loses. his. mind. 

…and starts barking and yanking on his leash toward the man in a way I’ve never seen him before or since. 

My brain is just kind of jumping around with being confused, embarrassed at my poorly behaved dog I’m struggling to control, and weirdly, also scared? Like my hair is standing on end for reasons I can’t explain. Like instinct is screaming this isn’t okay, while I stare at the shadowy figure walking silently backwards at an alarming fast pace, head turned slightly towards me, glasses reflecting yardlights. 

Suddenly we reach a break in the road that turns to a better lit area with more traffic and I immediately drag Reese down it. 

After walking several feet, I glanced over my shoulder at the creep and saw nothing. 

Too dark to see his path on the shadowy street, or disappeared? Hard to say. Reese stopped his racket as soon as we made the sudden turn, but he keeps his attention on the road we came from. He’s weird and annoying and on constant alert the rest of the uneventful walk home. I’m totally creeped out and cut the shorted route home ASAP.  

I never see the weirdo again. 

Thoughts? Skinwalker? Jerk just trying to be funny? Something else?
