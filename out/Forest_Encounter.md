I've never told anyone this story because I thought no one would believe me. But after seeing the Fears to Fathom games, I feel compelled to share my experience so others can know the truth. This is the story of the time I encountered a Wendigo in Beaver Mines, Alberta.

It was the summer of 2018 when my friends, Tim, Caleb, and I decided to go on a camping trip. We were in the 10th grade, looking for an adventure before school started again. Beaver Mines, with its dense forests and serene lakes, seemed like the perfect spot. We packed our gear, grabbed some snacks, and headed out for what was supposed to be a week-long trip, excited to spend some time away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

The first day was perfect. We set up our tent, roasted marshmallows over the campfire, and shared ghost stories. The stars were bright, and the air was cool and crisp. We felt like we were the only people in the world.

That night, as we were drifting off to sleep, I heard something moving outside our tent. It was a soft rustling, like leaves being disturbed. I brushed it off as an animal, but Tim and Caleb heard it too. We decided to investigate, thinking it might be a deer or a raccoon. As we shone our flashlights into the trees, we saw a pair of glowing eyes staring back at us from the darkness. They were unnaturally high off the ground, and the figure they belonged to was tall and gaunt.

The creature didn’t move. It just stood there, watching us. We backed away slowly and retreated to our tent, trying to convince ourselves that it was just our imagination. But deep down, we knew something was wrong.

The next day, we tried to enjoy our trip, but the memory of those eyes lingered. We decided to go for a hike to clear our minds. As we were walking through the forest, we stumbled upon a gruesome scene. A deer carcass lay on the ground, its body torn apart as if by some massive, savage creature. The air was thick with the smell of blood and decay.

We heard a noise and looked up to see the same creature from the previous night, hunched over another deer, devouring it with feral intensity. Its skin was stretched tight over its bones, and its eyes were hollow, filled with an insatiable hunger. We froze in terror, watching as it tore into the deer’s flesh. When it looked up and saw us, it let out a bone-chilling scream, a sound that echoed through the forest and sent shivers down our spines.

We ran back to our campsite, our hearts pounding in our chests. We knew we had to leave, but the sun was setting, and we didn't want to risk getting lost in the dark.

That evening, as we sat around the campfire, trying to regain some sense of normalcy, we heard the sound of branches snapping in the distance. I stood up, shining my flashlight towards the noise. We saw the Wendigo again, its skeletal frame partially hidden behind a tree. It was closer this time, and it seemed to be observing us with a sinister intelligence.

We decided to sleep in shifts, with one of us always keeping watch. During Caleb’s watch, I was jolted awake by his frantic whispering. “It’s getting closer,” he said, his voice trembling. The Wendigo was now just a few feet from our campsite, its eyes glowing in the darkness. We could hear its ragged breathing and the crunch of leaves under its feet as it circled our tent.

On the third night, we decided to go for a hike, hoping to clear our minds and escape the oppressive fear. The forest was eerily quiet, and we tried to ignore the unsettling feeling that we were being watched. As we rounded a bend in the trail, the Wendigo emerged from the darkness, its grotesque form towering over us.

It let out a guttural roar that reverberated through the trees, and we took off running. We sprinted down the trail, our breath coming in ragged gasps. The Wendigo’s footsteps pounded behind us, growing louder and more menacing with each passing second.

Desperate to escape, we veered off the trail and hid in the dense brush, hoping the thick foliage would conceal us. The Wendigo's growls were now close, and we could hear it crashing through the undergrowth, searching for us.

When it seemed like it was getting too close, we made a quick decision to hide in the nearest porta-potties we could find, hoping they would offer some protection. We squeezed into the cramped spaces, trying to stay as silent as possible. The creature’s heavy breathing and scratching noises outside were nearly unbearable.

After what felt like hours, the Wendigo’s sounds faded away, and we cautiously emerged from our hiding spots. We were shaken, but we knew we couldn’t stay another night.

That night, we huddled together in the tent, too scared to sleep. We heard footsteps circling our campsite, and the creature’s low, guttural growls filled the air. At one point, we saw its shadow pass by the tent, its elongated limbs casting eerie shapes on the fabric.

In the dead of night, I woke up to find the tent’s entrance partially unzipped. Peering out, I saw the Wendigo standing at the edge of our campsite, watching us with those haunting eyes. It was as if it was waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

We stayed awake until dawn, clutching our makeshift weapons, but the Wendigo never attacked. It was toying with us, feeding off our fear.

As soon as the first light of day broke through the trees, we packed up our gear and bolted for the parking lot. We didn’t speak; we just moved as fast as we could, our instincts screaming at us to get away. When we reached the parking lot, we threw our stuff into the car and jumped in, our hearts racing.

Just as we were about to drive away, I looked out the window and saw the Wendigo standing at the edge of the lot, its eyes locked onto mine. It didn’t move, but its presence was a terrifying reminder of what we had experienced. We sped away, leaving Beaver Mines and the Wendigo behind.

Since that trip, I've never gone camping again. The memory of the Wendigo haunts me, a constant reminder of the terror we faced. What was supposed to be a week-long trip ended abruptly after just four days. I hope that by sharing this story, others will be aware of the dangers that lurk in the shadows, waiting to prey on the unsuspecting.
