I was bored out of my mind on a Saturday evening around 8pm, and was desperately looking for something to watch on Twitch.

There was no stream that had interested me for more than 15 minutes, and I was beginning to despair of finding anything to watch to accompany my pizza - already cold - which was just waiting to be eaten next to me.

The light from the bulb in my room was unstable because of the storm and rain outside. 

But after all, that was the price I had to pay to enjoy a house given to me by Mom and Dad for free. It was the house my grandfather had lived in before he passed away and had left to my mother. My parents already had a house, and this was a way for me to become independent without being strangled by rent.

But still, being alone in this old house isolated in the woods was sometimes creepy.

Eventually, I came across a streamer playing a very old RPG that I remembered spending literally days playing when I was a teenager.

He was the one and only streamer in the section and had no other viewers except me.

I said "hi" in the chat, and was surprised to see him reply "hi :)" in the chat directly, instead of speaking into a microphone.

After a while, I realized that he probably didn't have a microphone because he always answered me directly in the stream chat.

I started eating my pizza and watched his stream, making a few comments now and then when I saw things I remembered.

-

The evening passed like a dream, and before I knew it, it was past midnight.

For the whole night, I'd been the only viewer, and the streamer, whoever they were, had been super nice the whole time. I figured it was the least I could do to support them. After all, someone had to be a channel's first viewer and subscriber, right?

I subscribed to their channel. A notification appeared on the stream screen, and just as I was smiling and about to wish them good night, a bolt of lightning lit up the sky through my window, and everything went black.

The circuit breaker had blown.

"Are you kidding me," I whispered dejectedly.

I grabbed my phone for light and ventured step by step down the dark hallway toward the stairs, to the ground floor. The circuit breaker was right next to the front door. 

As I walked, I could hear the attic window tapping softly. It was just closing thanks to some tinkering, but storms like this one tended to unblock it.

"Let's hope it holds tonight," I said as I descended the stairs.

Two minutes later, the circuit breaker was back on and the light with it.

I walked back up the stairs to my bedroom, yawning. I thought about turning my computer back on, but I'd planned to go to bed initially, so that's what I did.

I fell asleep, lulled by the sound of the wind, rain and storm outside.

-

I sat up suddenly.

I looked around. It was still dark, and the storm was even more violent outside. 

Had I been awakened by the wind or a fallen branch on the roof?

I waited a minute on the lookout, trying to perceive anything weird.

Nothing.

I was about to rest my head on my pillow when I finally heard it.

*Knock knock knock*

Someone was knocking on my front door.

"What the fuck..." I whispered hoarsely.

Had I imagined it? It sounded like three sharp knocks against the door. Was it a tree hitting a wall?

I straightened up and listened carefully.

Silence, apart from the noises coming from the storm.

Pretty sure I'd heard something, I decided to get out of bed and check downstairs. Maybe someone had had an accident during the storm and was desperate for help, and I didn't want to be responsible for a death.

I went downstairs and looked through the peephole in the front door.

No one was there.

Reassured, I turned back to the stairs to go back to bed.

*Knock knock knock*

Three knocks again. Sharp and powerful. Almost aggressive.

I wondered if I was dreaming. But the hairs on my arms, which had all bristled, told me it was all too real for that to be the case. I held my breath and walked back to the front door, taking the quietest possible steps on the floor.

I looked again.

Someone, or more like something, was standing right in front of the door.

It was at least 6’5" tall, slim. I couldn't even see its face, just its torso and legs. It was wearing a black raincoat that draped over it’s back and most of it’s body. Each of its fingers was as long as my hand.

"What the fuck is this..." I whispered in a low voice.

Instantly the man, or man-like thing, lowered itself to the peephole, poking it’s eye out, letting me see it’s bloody iris for a tenth of a second before I stumbled to the floor.

"Oh fuck fuck fuck it's happening it's happening," I said in a panic. I'd read tones of stories that started like that. Creepypastas where monsters would show up at someone's house in the middle of the night.

And they never ended well.

I ran upstairs to do what the idiots in these stories never do: call the cops.

I found my phone where I'd left it before going to bed. 

It wouldn't turn on, battery dead.

"Are you fucking kidding me?!" I screamed in rage.

Then I remembered sprawling out in bed last night without even glancing at my cell phone after using the flashlight. I must have left it on unintentionally before falling asleep, which drained the battery.

And I was probably going to die because of it.

Downstairs, the thing had stopped knocking on the front door.

Had it gone away? After all, I'd been smart enough not to open the door or talk to it. I hadn't provoked it in any way. Maybe it was...

I heard creaking above me. 

I slowly raised my head to the ceiling. Footsteps sounded, and something scraped on the floor.

The trapdoor from the attic down to my floor was right there, in the corridor in front of my bedroom door. I was about to sprint out before it opened, but as I grabbed my door handle, I heard the hatch open, then something light fall to the floor.

I was screwed.

I slowly backed away. Thinking of all the things I hadn't done yet in my life. All the things I hadn't done, for fear of failure or ridicule. The fact that I would have spent my last night alive watching someone stream a video game. 

And all the while, death marched down the hallway toward me.

My bedroom door slowly opened. 

A pale, thin, tall hand slipped through the gap in the door, and pressed the light switch, plunging the room into near-total darkness apart from the reflection of the moon and the lightning bolts that flashed through the window.

I was paralyzed. We often tell ourselves that those who get killed like that in stories are idiots and could have done this and this to survive. But when you're there, there's only one thing you try to do, and that's not piss your pants.

The thing entered the room with its head down because of its size.

It straightened up and looked me in the eye.

Its eyes were so pale that its irises were barely perceptible. Its nose was simply absent. Its mouth, a thin line that extended to the corners of its jaw. It wore a hat, or rather, a cap, with the letter "M" in green on it.

The line of its mouth widened into a wide, toothless smile.

Finally, it said: "I found you."

I passed out.

-

I woke up with a start.

I was on the floor of my bedroom. The same place I'd been before the thing came in.

I checked myself physically for injuries. I was fine, a miracle.

My discharged phone was next to me, without thinking I jumped on my charger, and 5 minutes later I could finally call the police.

-

The cops searched the house from top to bottom. There was no one.

There was no sign of an intrusion, as it'd gone up through the attic, where the window was only hanging by a thread. Of course, I didn't give them the actual description of the thing, just that a disturbing man in a raincoat had entered my house and attacked me.

The cops left, telling me to get back to them if I saw anything suspicious again. There was nothing more they could do.

I went and sat on my bed, exhausted by this night of horror. I'd hardly slept at all.

I casually slipped my hand under my pillow as I relaxed and felt something. A piece of paper.

I picked it up and brought it to my eyes.

I couldn't believe it.

A message, from my almost-killer.

It only said this: "Thanks for subscribing :)"
