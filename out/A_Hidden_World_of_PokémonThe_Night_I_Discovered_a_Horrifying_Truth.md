When I was a kid, Pokémon was everything. Like most people, I was entranced by the idea of these fantastic creatures living in harmony with humans, battling by our side, and forming unbreakable bonds. The excitement of catching a new Pokémon, the thrill of a gym battle, and the camaraderie between trainers were what made life feel so magical. But as I grew older, the innocent charm of Pokémon began to fade. The more I learned, the more I realized that the world of Pokémon wasn’t as idyllic as it seemed. There was a darker side, a hidden world where the creatures we adored weren’t friends but something far more sinister.



It all started when my friend Dan invited me to dinner. Dan was a chef who worked in one of the most exclusive restaurants in Saffron City. He’d always been a bit mysterious about his job, but when he said he had something special to show me, I couldn’t resist. “You won’t believe what you’re about to experience,” he promised with a grin.



The restaurant was hidden away, far from the bustling streets, nestled in the shadow of the towering Silph Co. building. We navigated through a series of narrow alleys until we reached a heavy, unmarked door. Dan knocked three times, and a small hatch slid open. After a brief exchange, we were let inside.



The interior was luxurious, almost decadently so. Red velvet lined the walls, and chandeliers cast a warm, golden glow over everything. The air was thick with the scent of rich, savory aromas that made my mouth water despite a growing sense of unease.



We were seated at a private table in the back, away from the other diners. The menu was handed to us, but it was unlike any menu I’d ever seen. There were no descriptions, just a list of names: Charizard, Blastoise, Miltank, Snorlax… The prices were astronomical.



I looked at Dan, confused, but he just smirked and told me to trust him. He ordered for both of us, selecting a dish labeled simply as “**Rare**.”



When the food arrived, I could barely contain my shock. Before me was a beautifully plated dish, a perfectly cooked steak that looked like it had been seared to perfection. It can make any Italian say "Mama Mia!" Or whatever they say over there. 



But there was something off about it, that feeling of not immediately identifying which cut of beef it is. I had my fair share of steaks in my 25 years of life, cheap and deluxe. It definitely looked superb, marbled. It appeared rich in fat and muscle, a perfect juicy steak. Dan had no plans on telling me what cut it is, after me asking for 4 times in a span of 30 seconds.



“Go on,” Dan urged, “*take a bite.*”



I hesitated but eventually gave in, cutting off a small piece and put it in my mouth. The flavor was indescribable, a perfect blend of tenderness and rich, *slight smokiness*, savory goodness. I must admit, it tasted more chicken that beef, with the exact texture of filet mignon. Flavor profile and texture was all over the place. Every chew was enjoyable, worth the bank-breaking price it was set to.



But as I chewed and chewed, a horrifying realization began to dawn on me.



The texture was too familiar, reminiscent of the specialty Pokémon food I had fed my Arcanine and Machamp (Which I evolved it from Machop myself) when I was younger. It wasn’t the standard stuff you’d find at a Poké Mart. No, this was high-end, designed for powerful and competitive Pokémon, filled with rich proteins and rare ingredients to enhance their strength and endurance. 



I adored my Pokémon like my own flesh and blood, you see. Though not particularly rich, my family supported my trainer career. In addition, I found side hustles so I can afford to give them the good stuff. I remembered the way they’d chew on it, savoring every bite, their eyes lighting up with satisfaction. That same texture, the same density, almost fibrous consistency, was now in my mouth.



“You know what it is, don’t you?” he asked, leaning in closer. “*That’s Charizard meat. Flame Tail Filet, to answer your question earlier.*" He smiled menacingly, eyes cold as ice. "*One of the rarest delicacies in the world.*”



I dropped my fork, bile rising in my throat. “**What the hell are you talking about?**” I stammered.



He laughed, a cold, mirthless sound. “You didn’t think they were just battling and living in the wild, did you? No no no, my friend. Some Pokémon…they’re bred for more than just companionship or battle. They’re bred for their meat, their hides, their bones. Speaking of the bones, oh how lovely Squirtle Shell Bisque is!" He paused reminiscing that sick memory I don't want to know more details of. "The elite, they pay top dollar for the chance to eat something that no one else can. That’s the true dark side of Pokémon.”



I was frozen, my mind racing to comprehend what he was saying. “But that’s fucking illegal, Dan!” I protested.



“Illegal?” he scoffed. “Sure, on the surface. But money talks, my friend. The black market for Pokemon is massive. You think Team Rocket was just about stealing them for power? Nope, they supply for restaurants like this. They’d capture rare Pokémon, slaughter them, and sell the meat to the highest bidder. And this isn’t just happening here. It’s global. Kanto, Johto, Sinnoh… every region has its own trade.”



I felt sick, my heart pounding in my chest. “How… how could people do this?”



He shrugged. “*It’s business.* People will pay for what they want, and as long as there’s demand, there’ll be supply. It’s the way the world works.”



I couldn’t listen anymore. I pushed away from the table and ran to the bathroom, barely making it in time before vomiting into the toilet. The taste of the Charizard filet still lingered in my mouth, a cruel reminder of what I had just ingested.



When I finally composed myself enough to leave, Dan was waiting outside the bathroom door, a look of mild concern on his face.



“Don’t take it too hard,” he said, placing a hand on my shoulder. “This is just how the world really works. Not everyone gets to see it, but now you know. And believe me, once you’ve tasted it, you’ll never want to go back.”



I shoved him away and stormed out of the restaurant, my mind reeling. How could something so beloved, so cherished by millions, be twisted into something so horrific? How many innocent Pokémon had been slaughtered for the sake of someone’s perverse enjoyment?



That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the faces of the Pokémon I had caught and trained over the years, their trusting eyes looking up at me. My prized Arcanine turned into Flame-Roasted Steak and my trusty Machamp into Muscle Ribs? I wondered how many of them had met the same fate as that Charizard.



The next day, I threw out everything I had related to Pokémon. My games, my cards, my memorabilia… I couldn’t bear to look at them anymore. The world of Pokémon had been tainted for me, its innocence forever shattered.



Days turned into weeks, and I tried to forget, but the memory of that night refused to fade. I avoided Dan, stopped visiting Saffron City, and cut ties with anyone who might remind me of what I had seen.



*But the taste lingered.*



Every meal seemed to echo that same flavor, a faint whisper of the Charizard steak that haunted my nightmares. I tried everything to cleanse my palate, but nothing worked. The taste followed me, a shadow I couldn’t escape.



One night, I found myself in front of a jar of old Pokémon food, something I had kept out of nostalgia. Driven by a compulsion I couldn’t ignore, I tasted a pellet. The flavor was identical to the steak.



The horrifying realization hit me: the Pokémon food I had fed my team was made from the same meat served in that restaurant. I had unknowingly been *feeding my Pokémon the flesh of their own kind.*



The darkness was no longer just in the world; it was inside me now, festering and growing stronger. The hunger I felt was more than physical—it was a primal, insatiable craving. The smokiness made my knees weak. It is truly *world-class*.



Desperately, I threw out the Pokémon food and locked myself away. But the hunger gnawed at me relentlessly. I knew it was only a matter of time before I gave in.



One night, the hunger became unbearable. I found myself standing outside that unmarked door, my body trembling with anticipation. The man at the door nodded as if he had been expecting me.



This time, I didn’t hesitate. I stepped inside, knowing *this won't be the last time.*
