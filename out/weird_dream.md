so, i had this dream tonight and i am still scared. And i got more scared because of my mom's reaction.  
  
 It all started in a optical store, for some reason i needed to go there 4 times from 2 in 2 weeks...the lady that was attending me had a long natural blonde hair and red glasses(the only thing that i remember about her) and she asked me "is this the second or the first time you are coming here?" and i smiled and said "the second." and in that moment i received a notification on my phone, i don't remember what it said but it was kinda of a warning. Anyways, when i received the notification i looked at the lady and she just said "don't open that notification right now. Open it in \*place\* at \*time\*." i don't remember what where was the place or the time, i just know that i got very confused and did what she said. I didn't open the notification.  
 After that i went to some kind of school, it was giant. There was some people inside, and the inside was like a loop of hallways and doors, and even some entrances without the door, it also had some zones that was open roof, that you could literally see the sky...but...what sky? At some point it started rain a lot, but like...raining in a way that looked like the world was falling, and when i looked to that open roof zones i could literally see nothing but darkness and the rain falling.  
 I started walking through there to see if i could find someone that i knew...and i saw one of my greatest friends going into some of that entrance without door, and i followed her. "idk what this is" she told me a bit confused but in a very calm tone and i reply "oh me neither, it looks like the world is falling, and idk what to do.", after i answer she looked at me and said "i need you to trust me and to follow me please." so thats what a did. We walked through a hallway till we find one room with 2 doors, we opened them and got inside. That room was scary. I was in fear when i got there. It was a room full of black stairs covered in a red carper. Lots of stairs. Some of the stairs didn't even make sense.   
 Well she looked at me and said "we need to go throught this ones" and she started going up and i followed her, we arrive to a small corridor that had a closed white door in the end and there was coming a really strong light out of the corners of the door...my friend turned to me and said "you can open the notification now." i freeze and we heard a girl coming, she had her blonde hair tied and she had big green eyes, also had her nose with that curve, her name was Leia..."get out of here and don't tell anyone that you saw this room." my friend said looking dead in the eyes and she said "of course not...why would i...?" and then she ran down the stairs and opened the 2 doors screaming for the people to go there.  
 A lot of people went there, some of that people i actually know in real life and the others one i can assure that i never saw them. That dream was being very real i was controlling myself in there...but then i felt like something was controlling me and i just said "if you up that stairs you are never going to see the light of the sun ever again. If you don't get out of here you are all gonna die." that was the last thing that i said...they started going up the stairs and throwing themselfs out of there. The people that fell through the stairs that had a end close to the floor had their bones broken and they were screaming...but...the ones that were falling through the tallest ones...when they touch the floor they died, there was blood everywhere. And then i woke up...  
 I told the dream to my mom and she said "that was God told everyone. God said dont go. they went. and they died. Maybe this is a sign...maybe you need to stop something, and was the only way God could tell you that." this is not my first weird dream, and its definitely not the first one that i told her. But...this was the first time that she said something like that. First time that she used God as an answer to a dream.

 sorry if i wrote something bad, english is not my first language...and im writing this cause i need help to understand this, its the first time that im sharing something with the internet. And im very grateful if someone would like to help me.  
 Thanks for reading.
