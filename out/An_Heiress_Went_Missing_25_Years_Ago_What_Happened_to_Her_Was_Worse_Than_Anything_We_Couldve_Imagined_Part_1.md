The morning sunlight spills lazily through the dusty blinds of our New Orleans office, casting long, slanting shadows across the hardwood floor. It's just another day in the glamorous life of a private eye. I'm idly thumbing through a stack of unpaid bills, trying not to think too hard about the dwindling number in our bank account. My partner, Ash, fiddles with the ancient coffee maker in the corner.

"Reine, I swear, this thing is older than the city itself," Ash grumbles, giving the coffee maker a gentle whack. The machine sputters in response, begrudgingly starting to brew.

Ash runs a hand through his graying black hair. His deep-set eyes, reflecting years of experience and a hint of untold stories, lighten up with a smile as he watches the coffee drip.

I lean back in my swivel chair, watching him. "I think it's a good metaphor for us—old, a bit rough around the edges, but still kicking."

Ash rolls his eyes but smiles, pouring two cups of the strong. "Here's to us, then—the antique detectives of New Orleans," he toasts, handing me a mug.

I take a sip, feeling the warmth spread through my body. I glance at the calendar on the wall, noting the date. I'll be turning 33 in exactly one month. It feels like just yesterday that I was a rookie police detective, full of hopes and ideals. Now, here I am, running a private investigation firm with my husband, dealing with the gritty, often thankless realities of our job.

Before I can respond, Louise, our secretary, peeks her head into the room. She's the grandmotherly backbone of our office. "Reine, Ash, you've got a new client. And from the looks of it, this one might actually be able to pay," she says with a wink.

Curious, I walk over to the window and peer through the dust-speckled blinds. Parked right outside is a sleek, black Rolls-Royce Phantom—a contrast to the array of beat-up sedans and pickup trucks that our clients usually drive.

“He says his name is Mathis Beaumont,” Louise adds.

The name sounds familiar, but I can’t quite put my finger on it. I exchange a look with Ash, a spark of interest lighting up his eyes.

"Thanks, Louise. Send him in," I reply, setting my coffee down and straightening up in my chair.

The door swings open, and in strides a man who looks every bit the part of old money—well-tailored suit, crisp white shirt, and a silk tie. His hair is a distinguished salt-and-pepper, cut impeccably. He must be in his fifties, but there's a vitality to him that belies his years.

“Detectives Reine and Asher Tran, I presume?” He inquires.

"Yes, Mr. Beaumont?" Ash asks, standing to greet him.

"Yes, my apologies for the unannounced visit. I hope I'm not intruding," he says, his voice carrying a cultured, almost melodious quality.

"Not at all. Please, take a seat," I say, motioning towards the chair opposite our desk.

Beaumont nods gratefully and sits down, casting a curious glance around the office. "You have quite the charming setup here."

"We like to think it has character," Ash replies with a half-smile. "Now, how can we assist you, Mr. Beaumont?"

Beaumont hesitates, his fingers drumming lightly on the armrest of the chair.

"This is... somewhat of a delicate matter," Beaumont begins, his voice betraying a hint of discomfort. "It's not something I would normally bring to a... private investigator." He pauses again. "But I've heard of your reputation for discretion and effectiveness."

"Rest assured, whatever you tell us will be handled with the utmost confidentiality," Ash says. As I listen, I try to place where I've heard his name before. His demeanor suggests more than just wealth; there's an air of influence about him that's hard to miss.

As Beaumont continues to explain his predicament, it suddenly hits me. My patients for his beating around the bush wears thin and I blurt out, "Are you by any chance related to the Beaumonts of the Garden District?"

Beaumont pauses, momentarily taken aback by my directness.

“That’s correct,” he admits. "I see my family's reputation precedes me."

"Your mother is Camille Beaumont, isn't she?" I ask, recalling the matriarch of the family.

A flicker of surprise crosses Mathis's features. "Yes, she *was*. My mother, Camille, passed away recently. It was quite sudden—a stroke.”

"I’m so sorry for your loss," I interject.

“The city lost a great patron, and we lost a beloved family member.” His voice carries a mixture of respect and sorrow, the kind that comes from losing someone larger than life.

Mathis shifts slightly in his chair, the weight of his next words apparent in his demeanor. "My mother left a considerable fortune to her surviving children in her will. However, there's a complication," he starts, his gaze steady but troubled. "I have a younger sister, Margot."

I raise an eyebrow, surprised. "I wasn't aware you had a sister."

He sighs. "Margot was, well, a free spirit, to put it mildly. She and my mother often clashed. Margot never quite fit the mold of the Beaumont family. Her ideas, her way of life... it was all too unconventional for my mother."

"Sounds like an interesting family dynamic," Ash comments.

Mathis gives a rueful smile. "Indeed. But things escalated beyond the usual family squabbles. About 25 years ago, they had a particularly fierce argument. It ended with Margot running away from home. We haven't seen or heard from her since."

"25 years?” I repeat with a shocked tone. “That's quite a long time to be estranged."

"Yes, it's been difficult for our family, especially for my mother. Despite everything, she always hoped Margot would return." He pauses, his gaze distant. "That’s why in a final act of reconciliation, she left a portion of her estate to Margot as well.”

"So, you want us to find Margot?" I ask, already considering the complexities of a case spanning over two decades.

"Exactly," Mathis confirms. "Find her, let her know about the inheritance, and ideally, bring her back."

I lean forward, my detective instincts kicking in. "You seem certain that Margot ran away. Is there any possibility that something else might have happened to her?"

Mathis nods, acknowledging the question. "I've considered that, believe me. But the night Margot left, she took a substantial amount of cash from my mother's safe. She also left this…”

Beaumont reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a slightly faded Polaroid photo. He hands it to me carefully, as if it's a fragile relic of a forgotten time.

I take the photo, studying it closely. The Polaroid shows a young woman, presumably Margot, in her late teens. She has dark curly hair and intense hazel eyes, conveying a fiery spirit and defiance.

Next to her, partially out of frame, is someone else. All I can see is part of a profile—perhaps the curve of a cheek, a hint of a smile. It's frustratingly little to go on, but the proximity of the two in the photo suggests a close relationship.

I flip the photo over and find Margot's handwriting on the back. It's a quick, scrawled note, the kind written in a moment of impulsiveness. It reads, "Running towards a new life with Alex, away from the gilded cage. Don't come looking for me. - M."

"Do you know who this Alex is?" I ask.

Mathis leans forward, squinting at the photo before shaking his head. "I wish I knew. I assume it’s the other person in the photo. My theory is that she ran away with him."

Ash, ever the pragmatist, frowns slightly. "Do you have any idea where they might have gone?"

Mathis sighs, the lines on his face deepening with the weight of unfulfilled hope. "No, I don't. After Margot left, we tried to track her, but she was like a ghost. She didn't want to be found."

"Did your family involve the police at the time?" Ash asks, still examining the photo.

Beaumont nods slightly, his expression one of lingering frustration. "Yes, we did. But since Margot was over 18 and appeared to have left of her own volition, there wasn't much they could or would do.”

“Can you recall anything about the days leading up to Margot's disappearance? Any unusual behavior, visitors, or conversations?" I ask.

His expression turns somber. "I wish I could provide more specifics, but there was a large age gap between us. I was already out of the house, pursuing my career, when Margot was still in her rebellious teenage years. We were never close, not really."

“What about your mother?” I ask. “Does she remember anything from the night Margot left?” He pauses, gathering his thoughts. "Mother was always tight-lipped about their falling out. It was a taboo topic in our household. All I know is that it was a bitter argument about Margot's lifestyle and choices.”

I don’t like the odds. Finding someone after a quarter-century with only a faded Polaroid and a name is like finding a needle in a haystack.

"Mr. Beaumont," I start, trying to choose my words carefully. "I understand the importance of this matter to you, but I have to be honest. The chances of finding your sister with so little to go on are slim. She could be anywhere, could have changed her name, her appearance..."

Mathis nods, his expression solemn yet understanding. "I'm aware of the difficulty, detective. I've considered that she might not even be... well, that she might not want to be found. But I have to try. It's my last promise to my mother, to at least attempt to reach out to Margot."

Ash leans forward, resting his elbows on the desk. "We're not saying it's impossible, just that it's going to be a tough case. We'd be starting from almost nothing."

Beaumont reaches into his inner jacket pocket and pulls out a small notepad and a pen. He scribbles something quickly, then slides the note across the desk towards us.

“If you can find Margot, or at least find out what happened to her, this amount is yours."

I pick up the note. My eyes widen at the figure written there. “Putain…” I exclaim under my breath. It's a staggering amount, the kind of number that would not only cover our unpaid bills but also secure the future of our little agency.

I look up at him, my surprise evident. "This is... very generous, Mr. Beaumont." He gives a small smile, tinged with sadness. "Money is not an issue. The only thing that matters to me now is honoring my mother's last wish.”

I exchange a glance with Ash, and I know he's thinking the same.

"We'll take the case, Mr. Beaumont," I say, my voice steady. "We can't guarantee success, but we can guarantee that we'll give it everything we've got."

He nods, relief clear in his eyes. "Thank you, Detective Tran. That's all I can ask for."

"One more thing, Detectives," he says in a measured tone. "Discretion is paramount. The Beaumont family name carries weight in this city, and I would prefer not to have our private affairs become public spectacle. Whatever you uncover, I ask that it remains between us."

There's a moment of silence as his words sink in. The way he emphasizes it leaves a slightly bitter taste in my mouth. It's not just about finding a lost sister; it's about maintaining the untarnished facade of a family that's been a cornerstone of New Orleans society for generations.

I exchange a glance with Ash, seeing a similar conflict in his eyes. We need this case, and we need it to be successful.

I nod, masking my reluctance with professionalism. "You have our word, Mr. Beaumont. Discretion is part of our service. We'll handle the matter with the sensitivity it requires."

He seems relieved, offering a curt nod of appreciation. "Thank you again. I trust you'll keep me updated with any progress."

"We will," Ash assures him as he escorts our client to the door.

Once the door closes behind Beaumont, I let out a long sigh, feeling the weight of the task ahead.

—

We start our investigation with the scant leads we have: the faded Polaroid, the name 'Alex,' and the knowledge of Margot's estrangement from her family. Ash and I divide our tasks. We take to the streets, starting with the jazz clubs, hoping someone might remember a girl like Margot.

We spend hours visiting each one, showing the Polaroid to bartenders, regulars, anyone who might have been around in the late 90s. But nobody remembers her, or they're not willing to say if they do.

I delve into the family history. It becomes clear that the Beaumonts are more than just prominent; they’re akin to royalty in New Orleans' high society. Their influence stretched across various sectors, from business to the arts. Camille, in particular, was a force to be reckoned with, known for her lavish parties and generous donations to the city's cultural institutions. Margot, however, was the black sheep of this distinguished family. She defied the expectations set upon her.

Through interviews, I learn that Margot was pursued by numerous suitors, all handpicked from the cream of society. But she turned them all down, much to her mother's chagrin.

The possibility that Margot has drastically changed her appearance and is living under an assumed identity is a recurring thought. I scour through social media and public records. Yet, every lead fizzles out, leaving us no closer to finding her than when we started.

The notion that Margot might have run into foul play lingers ominously in the back of our minds. We painstakingly go through the list of unidentified persons reported around the time of her disappearance. We compare photos, descriptions, and even dental records, when available. But none of the cases match Margot's description. While it's good news that these tragic fates didn't befall Margot, it also means we're still in the dark about her whereabouts.

Our investigation, extensive as it is, finds no public records, no financial transactions, and no sightings that can be definitively linked to her after that fateful night.

—

As the investigation unfolds, the mystery of "Alex" becomes as elusive as the search for Margot herself. None of the family members, friends, or social acquaintances I interview recall any man named Alex in Margot's life. This absence of information is puzzling, leading me to consider two possibilities: either Alex was a very well-kept secret, or he entered Margot's life shortly before her disappearance, under circumstances unknown to her inner circle.

The breakthrough comes unexpectedly. Ash and I are in the office late one evening, surrounded by piles of notes and maps. I'm about to suggest calling it a night when Ash suddenly sits up straight, a look of realization dawning on his face.

"Reine, I think we've been looking at this all wrong," he said, his voice tinged with a mixture of excitement and uncertainty.

I looked up, intrigued. "What do you mean?"

He starts shuffling through a stack of papers, his hands finally landing on a faded employment record. "What if 'Alex' isn’t short for Alexander, but for Alexandra?"

I'm taken aback by the suggestion. "Alexandra?"

"Yeah," he says, pointing to the document. "Alexandra Sinclair. She worked briefly in Camille Beaumont's household around the time of Margot's disappearance. It was a short stint, and she left abruptly, according to these records."

The implication of what Ash is suggesting hits me like a wave. Could Margot's 'Alex' have been a woman?

We pour over the employment record. Sinclair was hired as a personal assistant to Camille, but her employment lasted less than three months. The records don't say much else, but it's more than we've had for the entire investigation.

I examine her employee photo, a standard black and white image, but it's her profile that catches our attention. The curve of her cheek and the hint of a smile match the obscured face in the Polaroid. It's not definitive proof, but it's something.

We start tracing Sinclair’s movements after she left the Beaumont household. However, it's like chasing a ghost.

After days of relentless digging, we finally uncover her last known address in the Lower Ninth Ward. It's a far cry from the grandeur of the Garden District where the Beaumonts reside.

—

We decide to pay her a visit. The Lower Ninth Ward, a neighborhood profoundly affected by Hurricane Katrina, still bears the scars of the disaster. We pass by empty lots overgrown with weeds, houses in various stages of disrepair, and the occasional new construction trying to breathe life back into the area.

We pull up in front of a modest, somewhat weathered house. It's clear that, like many in this area, it has seen better days, but there's a sense of care to it—a freshly painted door, a small garden struggling against the odds.

We walk up to the front door. I knock on the door, my heart pounding with anticipation and a hint of apprehension.

Moments pass, and the sound of footsteps approaches from inside. The door creaks open, revealing a woman in her mid-40s. Her features resonate with the face in the Polaroid, but time and life have etched their own story upon her.

"Can I help you?" she asks cautiously.

"Ms. Sinclair? Alexandra Sinclair?" I inquire, my voice steady but respectful.

She hesitates, then nods slightly. "That's me. What's this about?"

“My name is Reine and this is my partner Ash—” I start to say.

She cuts me off, her tone firm, "I'm not interested in whatever you're selling."

As she begins to close the door, Ash quickly interjects, "Wait! We're not selling anything. We're private investigators. We're looking for Margot Beaumont."

The mention of Margot's name halts her movement. Alex's face hardens, her eyes narrowing with a mix of suspicion and defense. "You tell Mrs. Beaumont I've kept my end of the deal. She has no right to harass me after all these years."

"Ms. Sinclair, Camille Beaumont didn’t send us. She's dead," I explain, hoping the truth will lower her guard.

Those words seem to strike her like a physical blow. The defensiveness in her posture falters, replaced by a stunned disbelief. She stares at us for a long moment, processing the information.

"Mrs. Beaumont is… dead?" she finally murmurs, her voice barely above a whisper. Her expression shifts from shock to what looks like relief.

I nod solemnly. "Yes, we’re just trying to find out what happened to Margot."

"I don't know why you're here or what you're trying to dig up, but I want no part of the Beaumonts or their affairs," she states firmly, her voice tinged with a lingering resentment.

Desperate, I reach into my pocket and carefully pull out the faded Polaroid. Holding it out towards her, I ask gently, "Ms. Sinclair, is this you, with Margot?"

Alex's eyes fix on the photo, and for a moment, her facade falters. She hesitates for a moment, scanning our faces with any hint of duplicity. Then she steps aside, opening the door wider. "Y’all best come in.”

As we step into her modest living room, Alex seems to gather herself, the initial shock giving way to a wary composure. She motions for us to sit on an old but well-maintained sofa.

"I'm sorry, this has all been a bit... overwhelming," she admits, her voice steadier now. "You said Camille is dead?"

"Yes," I reply gently. “Her brother, Mathis, hired us to locate her."

“Ding dong, the witch is dead,” Alex scoffs.

“You don’t have a high opinion of Ms. Beaumont?” I ask.

“You can say that,” she retorts. "I suppose you want to know about me and Margot."

"We do," Ash replies gently. "Anything you can tell us will help. Were you two friends?"

"Margot and I... we were more than just friends," she confesses, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. "We were in love."

“In love?” I ask, my jaw dropping. This piece of information reshapes the entire narrative.

“Yeah, it was a whirlwind, you know? Two young women against the world."

She pauses, her gaze distant. "But Margot's family... they would've never accepted us. They had their image, their expectations. Margot and I, we knew we couldn't live that lie."

Ash leans forward, attentive. "So, you planned to run away together?"

A sad smile flickers on Alexandra's lips. "Yeah, we talked about it. Dreamed of it. A place where we could be ourselves, without judgment, without the weight of the Beaumont name.

"But the night we were supposed to leave, Margot didn't show up. I waited for hours, but she never came.”

I sit back, genuinely taken aback by this revelation.

Alex's face darkens as she continues. "Camille found out about us," she says, her voice tinged with bitterness. "She confronted me, fired me on the spot. But that wasn't enough for her. She threatened to destroy my life if I ever tried to contact Margot again."

"Did you try to reach out to Margot after that?" I ask.

Alex shakes her head, a sad resignation in her eyes. "I couldn't. I was scared. Camille Beaumont was a powerful woman. She could make good on her threats. I loved Margot, but I was just a nobody. I had to protect myself."

Ash leans forward, his expression sympathetic but probing. "What do you think happened to Margot that night?"

Before she can respond, she is cut short by the sound of the front door opening. “Mom, I’m home!” a voice calls out.

A teenage girl steps into the living room, her eyes widening slightly at the sight of us. “Oh, I didn't know we had visitors."

Alexandra’s eyes flicker towards us, a silent plea evident in her gaze. Her daughter doesn’t know about any of this and doesn’t want her to.

Thinking quickly, I stand up and offer a reassuring smile. "Hello there! We're with Entergy. We’re checking on reports of electrical issues on the block.

“Everything seems fine here, ma’am,” Ash says, playing along. “Thank you for your time. We’ll see ourselves out.”

The girl seems unconvinced but shrugs and heads towards her room. “Okay, weird, but whatever. Hi,” she says with a brief wave before disappearing down the hallway.

As she disappears down the hallway, Alex lets out a quiet sigh of relief. "Thank you," she murmurs to us.

As we make our way to the door, Alexandra follows us, her steps hesitant. At the threshold, she leans closer, lowering her voice to a whisper. "If you really want to find out what happened to Margot, I suggest you look into the skeletons in Camille Beaumont’s closet.”

—

Initially, Mathis is vehemently opposed to our idea. He insists that the family's private residence has nothing to do with Margot's disappearance and that our investigation should focus elsewhere. His resistance is palpable, perhaps due to a combination of guarding family privacy and an underlying fear of what we might uncover.

However, as we persist, emphasizing the importance of exploring all possibilities, Mathis begins to relent. He agrees to allow us access to the mansion but under one strict condition: he must be present during the search.

We arrive at the Beaumont mansion in the Garden District as the sun sets, casting a golden hue over the grandiose structure. The mansion stands hauntingly imposing, its gothic architecture reminiscent of a bygone era. Ivy crawls up its stone walls, adding to the sense of age and mystery that envelops the place.

Mathis leads us through the towering front doors into a foyer that feels more like a museum than a home. The air is heavy with the scent of old wood and faint traces of lavender. Family portraits line the walls, their eyes seeming to follow our every move.

The interior of the Beaumont mansion is a labyrinth of rooms and corridors, each one preserved almost as if Camille Beaumont herself might return at any moment. The grandeur is overwhelming, yet there's an undercurrent of something... misaligned. It's not just the antiquated décor or the way the evening light casts eerie shadows through the stained glass windows. It's as if the house itself is holding onto secrets, reluctant to reveal the truths hidden within its walls.

Mathis flips the switches, illuminating the opulent corridors with a warm, artificial glow that seems almost invasive in the quiet, hallowed space. He follows closely as we begin our meticulous search, his gaze sharp and unyielding, like a sentinel guarding a sacred tomb.

We start in the main study. Volumes of literature, history, and art line the shelves. I carefully scan each book, hoping to find hidden notes or letters, while Ash examines the desk, sifting through old letters and faded documents.

We move through the mansion methodically, exploring Camille's private chambers, the attic filled with generations of forgotten heirlooms, and even the basement, a place where time seems to have stood still amidst dust-covered furniture and boxes of old photographs. The search is exhaustive, but frustratingly fruitless.

As the evening progresses, Mr. Beaumont's patience wears thin. His initial reluctance has transformed into outright annoyance. He paces the hallways, frequently glancing at his watch, his demeanor growing more agitated with each passing hour.

"This is pointless," Mathis finally declares. "You're rummaging through my mother’s personal belongings like common thieves. It's clear you're grasping at straws."

His words hang heavily in the air. I ignore him, taking a moment to look around, trying to find a new perspective. It's then that I realize what’s odd about the mansion's interior.

Despite its age and historic design, there are subtle signs of extensive remodeling. Inconsistent flooring patterns, patches of fresher paint on the walls, and even some mismatched architectural details. It's as if certain parts of the house have been deliberately altered or updated.

"Mr. Beaumont," I begin, turning to face him. "Have there been renovations in this house?"

Mathis pauses, his irritation momentarily replaced by a look of contemplation. "It was something of an obsession for my mother towards the end of her life. After Margot left, she began changing things around the house. At first, it was just redecorating, but then it became more... comprehensive."

"Comprehensive in what way?" Ash asks.

"Whole rooms were gutted and redone. Walls moved, floors replaced. She said it was her way of coping with the emptiness Margot left behind. I always thought it was excessive, but I never questioned it. Mother had her ways of dealing with things."

I can't shake the feeling that there's something off about these changes. It's not just the aesthetic alterations; it feels like something more substantial has been concealed.

"Ash, help me check these walls more closely," I suggest.

We start tapping along the walls, listening intently. The sound changes subtly as we reach a particular section. It's hollow, distinctly different from the solid thuds elsewhere.

I press my ear against the wall, straining to listen. I hear something unexpected – a faint, rustling sound. It’s too deliberate to be dismissed as mere settling of an old house. It's too big, too rhythmic to be a rodent.

"Did you hear that?" I ask, looking over at Ash.

He nods, his expression turning serious. "Yeah, there's something behind this wall."

Beaumont, observing our actions, comes over, a look of confusion on his face. "What is it? What do you hear?"

"There's something, or someone, behind this wall," I reply, my mind racing with possibilities. Mathis looks incredulous. "That's impossible. It's just an old house."

Ash stands there, his hand flat against the wall. "This reminds me of my time in Iraq," he says slowly. "Insurgents used to build elaborate networks of tunnels, sometimes within the walls of buildings. Hidden passages, secret rooms... it was their way of moving unseen."

Mathis's face goes pale. "Hidden passages? In this house?"

"It's not unheard of in old homes, especially ones with a history like this," I add, my mind working overtime. "Secret passages were often built for various reasons—security, privacy, sometimes even for less savory purposes."

"But why would my mother need something like that?" Mathis asks, his voice barely above a whisper. "That's what we intend to find out," I say firmly.

"Do you have access to the blueprints of the house, particularly of the remodeling done by your mother?" Ash asks.

Mathis shakes his head, clearly puzzled by the turn of events. "I don't have them personally, but I can contact the family lawyer first thing in the morning. He might have a copy or know where to find them."

Realizing we can't wait until morning, I pull out my phone and dial our secretary. "Louise, we need your help. We've found something in the Beaumont mansion that requires a closer look. Can you bring a couple things from the office?”

Louise arrives within the hour, her reliable efficiency shining through once again. She brings a trunk full of equipment, along with her trademark no-nonsense attitude.

"Thanks for coming on such short notice," I say.

"Of course. What's got you two so worked up?" she asks, handing over the equipment.

“Oh, you know. The usual,” I shrug.

Louise has been with us long enough to know that’s code for: our case has taken an unexpected turn.

We set up the thermal imaging camera that Louise brought and start scanning the walls of the mansion. The camera, a sophisticated device, detects temperature differences and helps visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.

As I move the camera along the wall, most sections show the cool, consistent temperature of the old stone and plaster. But then, the screen reveals something unexpected—a large warm pocket within a section of the wall.

Ash takes out the endoscopic camera, a small device, perfect for peering into tight spaces. He carefully inserts the camera into a small crevice in the suspicious section. The screen attached to the camera flickers to life, displaying a murky, shadowed view of what lies beyond.

He navigates the camera through the dark cavity of the wall, the light from its tip casting eerie shadows. The passage behind the wall seems to be a narrow, cramped space, but it's difficult to tell its full extent from the camera's limited perspective.

The camera's light flickers across the hidden space, the shadows dancing on the tiny screen. For a moment, it's just an empty void, a silent testament to hidden secrets. But then, something moves. A figure, hunched and barely discernible in the dim light, shuffles into view.

The figure is unnervingly gaunt, its movements jerky and unnatural. Its back is to the camera, but there's something profoundly disturbing about its posture, the way it seems to twitch with an unsteady rhythm.

Then, without warning, the figure turns, and for a brief, heart-stopping moment, its face is illuminated by the camera's light. It's a visage of despair and terror, eyes hollow and haunted, skin sallow and stretched taut over sharp bones.

The figure's lips part, and it lets out a chillingly pained cry—a sound that seems to echo through the walls of the mansion. As quickly as it appeared, the figure shuffles away, disappearing back into the shadows.

We all stand there, frozen, the image of the ghastly figure burned into our minds.

Mathis, watching over my shoulder, gasps audibly. "What was that?"

Ash's face hardens with concern. "Someone's living in your walls."
