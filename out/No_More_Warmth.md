"Daddy, it's so cold out today!" my daughter Hana yelled with a smile while playing in the white snow.

I smiled and just kept watching her while holding my wife's hand.

"Are you sure you don't need any gloves?" my wife yelled at my daughter across the yard. 

My daughter looked towards her and said, "No thanks, mommy!" and smiled while kicking some snow up into the chilly air. 

I looked at my wife and said, "You're a great mom, Aimi." 

She blushed and held my hand harder while leaning against me, then whispered, "You're so warm." 

It was a little random, considering what I just said, but it was also a nice complimentâ€”something that felt good to hear someone tell you, but you wouldn't ask for it or expect to be told it. I just held her hand and rested my head against the top of hers. 

"Alright, it's getting late; I think it's time to head inside and go to bed, Hana." I spoke out to her.

She trotted her little feet inside, took off her boots, leaving them by the backdoor to let the snow melt, and ran towards the stairs. 

We walked up with her, watching her little legs run up the stairs as fast as they could. She took the corner and ran into the bathroom to brush her teeth.

"Goodnight mom!" "Goodnight, dad!" she yelled from inside the bathroom as she turned on the faucet. 

"Goodnight baby." Aimi and I yelled back from inside our room. 

I started to get comfortable in bed, as I was tired from the gruesome 14-hour shift I had that morning. My wife snuggled up to me, pressing her body against mine.

I just thought she was wanting and showing affection and love, so I held her hands, looking at her closed eyelids. 

That's when I started to realize how cold her hands were. Her body as well. She was awfully cold, so I got concerned. 

"Aimi, are you feeling okay?" I asked her in a concerning manner.

No response, except for her holding my hand tighter, rubbing her cold palms against mine.

I started getting worried and started shaking, thinking I was just nervous. Then a cold spike ran up my back. I realized I was shivering, not shaking. I was cold.

I tried to release Aimi's grip to get up and check the AC to see if it was set low.

No budge. Her hands wouldn't move. The shivering got worse, and I kept gradually getting colder. 

I started getting dizzy and realized that I was sweating. 

"Sweating?" I muttered.

"Impossible," I spoke out again, "I'm freezing." My teeth were clattering together.

That's when my attention sparked toward my wife. Aimi's hands, which were cold, are now warm. A relaxing warmth that could make you feel at ease.

I felt as if I was losing consciousness, seeing everything around me start to get blurry. I gripped my wife's hand tighter, scared. I directed my eyes back at my wife as I heard her whisper.

"You were so warm."

She showed a smile, an inhuman, monstrous smile. 

Teeth with an unnatural angle, spiking down. Her gums were a blue color with a hint of purple. 

Her smile got wider, and her face stretched and morphed, showing more horrid teeth. 

Her lips moved once more.

"No... more.. warmth."
