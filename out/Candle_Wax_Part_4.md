“Well there goes your theory then.” Gray quipped, but with a twist of unease in his voice that he didn’t do well to hide.

 

“It doesn’t make sense. So the videos are fake? How?” I questioned.

 

“What about all that fuckin’ A.I. stuff I see nowadays?”

 

“A.I.?”

 

“Yeah... my nephew sends me this video the other week of this cute ass baby penguin eating out of someone’s hand, then it turns out it’s A.I. generated. But it looked totally real. Like you’d never guess.”

 

“I don’t know... AI can do a lot but... I don’t know if it’s THAT good yet. Usually you can still tell if you look close, or listen close. Especially when it’s a person.”

 

“This girl’s been posting her stuff for years though... It’s a lot of material to pull from, shall we say.”

 

“Yeah... I don’t know.”

 

Gray sat back and sighed, “It’s fuckin’ freaky. One thing that freaks me out just as much as satanic cult shit... A.I...”

 

“That much we agree on.”

 

“How ‘bout that. Broken clock’s right twice a day...” He cracked. “I’m gonna have our tech guys look into her videos. I think they have programs and shit that can detect A.I., and they can see about your VPN or whatever.”

 

“Good, get that going... But I still.... It still doesn’t make sense. We phoned her, we talked to her in real time. Can A.I. do that?”

 

“You’re askin’ me?”

 

“No... It just...” I stammered.

 

“Let’s wait for the results, alright Cole? Right now there’s only one question we need to answer.”

 

“What’s that?”

 

Gray sat back and shrugged. “Who is she?”

 

That really was the ultimate question. Who is Harmony? If we answered that then maybe it could all fall into place. I got an impression of her from her videos, but that was far from enough. That was only the side of her she wanted us to see.  We still didn’t even know if she was the victim here, or if she set this all up herself to hide something.

 

Gray and I spent the rest of the morning and the afternoon driving all around Greenwood, asking around and gathering all the information we could about her. I found that Gray was a lot more tolerable when we were in the weeds of an investigation. He still gave me shit and made his little barbs, but he took the work seriously.

 

The first stop was Harmony’s mother Evelyn again. She was distraught that her intuition was proven true, but grateful that she finally had someone who believed her. We tried calling Harmony again from Evelyn’s phone but she didn’t pick up.

 

Her mother told us a lot, just not a lot that we could use right now. Harmony was an only child. Born right here in Greenwood in the spring of 1998. Her father stuck around for the first 6 years, then went no-contact. Supposedly he lives halfway across the country and has a new family. Nevertheless, we would have to talk to him.

 

They were a churchgoing family, though Harmony often protested, never taking it seriously. She attended a Christian nursery school and elementary school, until fourth grade when she convinced her mother to let her go to a regular public school instead. Through school, Harmony made many friends. She was popular and outgoing, and had a keen interest in art and photography. Evelyn says she never had a boyfriend, though I wonder how true that is. It wouldn’t be the last secret she would keep.

 

Harmony moved out when she was 18 to attend a university, maybe an hour or two drive from Greenwood. After getting a degree in journalism, she moved back to town, into a small apartment. Part-timing as a waitress.

 

I was correct in my assumption that Evelyn was not aware of the details of Harmony’s online business. She described it as online photography. I suppose that’s technically not wrong.

 

We found Harmony’s father Brad via his Facebook. By all accounts he appeared painfully ordinary, bit of an old hipster vibe. We confirmed that he lived in Alberta and had remarried with two step-sons. Our phone conversation with him was callously brief. He assured us that Harmony was not with him, and beyond that he truly did not seem to care.

 

Our next visit was to Harmony’s apartment. It was a small, four-unit building. We didn’t have a warrant to enter yet, but we spoke to the landlord. Harmony had not been seen there in two months... Otherwise there wasn’t much to say. She was a good tenant.

 

We went to the diner she worked at. The manager told us that she requested to be taken off the schedule two months ago. This request was via text. Nobody at the diner had seen her since, but her friends say she still texts them back. Having seen the most recent texts, they are consistent with Harmony’s typing style, but they are short and largely impersonal.

 

Gray and I decided to get lunch at the diner while we were here. It was a nice looking place, and the prices weren’t half bad.

 

“So, where are we going next?” I asked as we waited for our food.

 

“She had to have some other friends, not just work friends, right? We can keep digging.”

 

I shook my head, “I don’t know...”

 

“Got something on your mind?”

 

“We’re getting a lot of surface level information, and nothing is standing out... We need to go deeper. There’s a whole other life she led. Online, I mean. I’ve seen her videos, that was so much of what she did. She has nearly a hundred thousand followers. If she was going to be a target, it wouldn’t be out here. It would be there.”

 

“Someone found her online?”

 

“The way I see it, there’s three possibilities. Either she’s doing this herself for some reason, someone is doing this to her, or someone is making her do it. In any case it goes back to the internet. If someone set up this whole ruse or whatever it is, they would have to be online a lot, they would have to know her life there... I’m thinking it’s a definite possibility that’s where they found her. That’s where we have to look.”

 

“You thinkin’ maybe a sting?”

 

“A sting?”

 

“Yeah, if this person targeted her because she’s this sexy online model or whatever... Well... You make a profile. Fake name and all that. Do what she did. I’m not saying post nudes and do all that per se but like... Put yourself out there, few selfies, vlogs, get into her circles, see if this creep finds you.”

 

“Okay... There are so many reasons why that’s a bad idea.” I said with palpable judgment in my voice.

 

“Like what? I mean nobody knows what you look like, certainly not in this town. You’d be protected.”

 

“First of all, I don’t want to. Second of all, I highly doubt I would cater to the same audience that she does. Third of all, do you have any idea how many weird people are on the internet? And you think I’ll be able to I.D. one of them? Fourth... I REALLY don’t want to.”

 

“Alright fine. No prob. Hey, I’m just spitballin’.”

 

“I understand, I’d just prefer you didn’t spitball with the idea of me doing porn.”

 

“Easy! I didn’t fuckin’ say that. Come on. I’m a lotta things but I ain’t no creep.”

 

“Okay... Good. Just making sure.”

 

“Christ... I’m just over here trying to get some eggs benedict and now I’m in THIS conversation... Alright, so what are you gonna do then? Just search around?”

 

“Yeah, pretty much. You can find a lot on peoples’ socials.”

 

“Gonna do that on your own time?”

 

“Most likely.” I responded, aware of his previous lecture on the matter.

 

“Alright... just... Ah, whatever. Keep me posted.”

 

The food came, we ate, and then we left. We headed back to HQ to update our case files and report what we learned. I expected it to be slightly arduous work, especially since my headache from the morning still hadn’t gone away.

 

When we got inside, however, we were greeted by the tech guys. I learned their names in that moment, they were Ben and Deacon.

 

“You got somethin’ for us?” Gray asked.

 

“We got... Well... Follow us.” Answered Ben, as they led us back to their area.

 

“We’ve still got a lot of deeper analysis we can do but basically...” Ben explained and he sat in his desk and guided our eyes to the monitor. “We’ve run some of the tests and the results have been interesting.”

 

“Okay, I’m listening.” Said Gray, lurching down and squinting.

 

“Our A.I. detection software came back inconclusive. Which is uncommon, but it does happen sometimes, especially as the technology continues to improve. Between all the videos we’ve run, it seems to come out between a 40% and 60% probability of generative A.I. usage.” Explained Deacon.

 

“So... What does that mean? What does that tell us?”

 

“To me that says that the videos themselves are not A.I. generated, BUT they most likely have been tampered with. So they’re not entirely fake, but they’re also not genuine.”

 

“Can you tell which parts have been tampered with?” I asked.

 

“Not yet. We’ll need more time on that.” Deacon said. I was beginning to feel frustration at all these non-answers, but then he continued, “However, there is one more thing we wanted to show you... Ben?”

 

“Yeah so...” Ben began as he pulled up one of the videos and began scrolling through. “We’ve been skimming through, looking for any graphical weirdness or glitches. For the most part we haven’t found anything yet, but there is this one strange little moment.”

 

He stopped the video at 1:56 and then began going frame by frame. The video shows Harmony sitting at a café. She’s laughing and in the middle of flipping her hair back. Due to the quick motion, most of her face is smudged and blurred.

 

“You see she’s moving her head fast here, and this is typically when you’d get slip ups with filters and things like that... so...” He explained as he began going frame-by-frame. “There’s this one frame coming up... Here! Do you see it?”

 

He stopped on an image, and my heart stopped with it. My entire body pulsated with anxiety. There was no way this was really happening. My eyes widened and I couldn’t form a word.

 

Gray leaned in closer and then muttered in quiet and disturbed astonishment, “Her eye... Her eye is gone.”

 

It was clear as day. Not a shadow or a smudge or a glitch. Her left eye was an empty socket. You could see hints of the red flesh inside. In that one frame, her smile didn’t look quite so innocent anymore.

 

I knew what Gray was thinking. He was thinking about that goat’s head. I was thinking about so much more... The Candle Caine game... My dream... And when I saw that face in the forest that night, peeking from behind the tree, the one thing I didn’t get a chance to see was her left eye.

 

Gray and I didn’t talk about it for the rest of the day, we simply buried our noses in the paperwork we had to get done, but when we both left the station and headed for our cars after the sun had set, he took the chance to ask me.

 

“What the hell is going on here, Cole?”

 

I struggled to find any kind of answer to give him, so I just shrugged and said “I don’t know.”

 

“Yeah... I’d be worried if you did.” He replied before walking off to his car.

 

That still image burned into my mind and called so much into question, but it didn’t change my mission for the night. I wanted to understand her, and I wanted more information.

 

As I drove home on those dark, lonely roads, my mind could only spin. The pain in my head wasn’t letting up. I ended up getting drive-thru. Groceries would have to wait again.

 

I found that I couldn’t enjoy the peace of the night as much as I had before. The blanket of darkness only seemed to get heavier.

 

Something came into few in front of me. I slammed on the brakes as hard as I could and came to a screeching halt. My heart pounded and my hands briefly shook from the sudden shot of anxiety. I took in what I was seeing. It was a woman. An older woman, her back slumped, she was struggling to cross the road. Her clothes were filthy and tattered and her hair was wiry. Why was she out here?

 

The road I was on was straight, with a field on one side and woods on the other. No buildings for a ways in either direction. Why was she crossing here? My instinct was to get out and help her, but she shambled her way right in front of my door. Then she just... stood there.

 

She stared into my window with a blank expression and dark, beady eyes.

 

“Are you alright, ma’am?” I called out. “Do you need help?”

 

She didn’t respond. She just stood. I could only open my door an inch before hitting her. I wasn’t sure what to do.

 

“What are you doing out here this late? Do you need a ride? Do you want me to call someone?”

 

Still nothing. But then, without warning, she pressed her face to the glass window and began to lick it. Vigorously.

 

I recoiled. “What the fuck?” The words involuntarily escaped my lips.

 

I had to try and calm down and think rationally. Everything from these past few days was getting to me. This wasn’t what my brain was trying to make it. This was just an old woman who was probably senile and really needed help, and I had to help her. I began moving to the passenger seat to make my way outside, but then I heard her speak.

 

“The window is open.” She said in a craggy old voice. I turned back to her and beyond the smears of her saliva on the glass, I saw a smile stretched across her wrinkled face.

 

“What do you mean?”

 

“The window is open.” She repeated.

 

“No... The window isn’t open. None of the windows are open.”

 

“It is. And he’s climbing in.” She said, looking behind me towards the back window on the passenger side.

 

I knew it was closed. They were all closed. Of course they were. I didn’t have to look. No one was climbing in.

 

“He’s climbing innnn.” She repeated playfully, still looking behind me.

 

I didn’t have to look. Why did I feel like she wanted me to look? I wasn’t going to. I kept my eyes trained on her.

 

“Who?” I asked simply.

 

“He was there but now he’s here.” She answered in a sing-song. “He was out but now he’s in. Climbing, climbing, climbing in.”

 

“Nobody else is here.”

 

“Don’t you feel him? Don’t you hear him?”

 

Just as she said that, there was a shallow creak from the back seat. In a panic, I spun around to face the back... But there was no one.

 

I knew there was no one. Of course there was no one. The windows were closed.

 

But then a strikingly loud thud came from outside my door. I jumped in my seat, nearly jumping out of my skin, and quickly turned back to the woman.

 

She had violently smashed her face against my window. Then she did it again. The second smash sent a spurt of blood from her nose across the glass. The third smash cracked the glass. I jammed my foot down on the gas pedal and sped out of there down the road. I wanted no more to do with this. It may have made me a bad cop, but I was not picking this battle. I heard her twisted, throaty cackle as she descended into the depths of my rear view mirror.

 

“Jesus fucking Christ” I muttered to myself. What the hell was going on this town?

 

I got back home and practically barricaded myself inside the apartment. Mrs. Fredricks gave me a kind greeting, and I responded with all the pleasantness that I could muster, but I could not converse. Not after that.

 

I spent about a half hour just trying to cool down. I ate my food, did a quick work-out, and shook away the nerves. Then I sat at my computer.

 

Gray’s suggestion for an online sting was dumb, and I stood by my reasons for why it was dumb. Still, something inside me wanted to try it. Was it to get to know her better? Just morbid curiosity to see what that kind of life was like? Merely a distraction from all the fucked up shit that seems to keep happening? Maybe it was vanity, I don’t know. But I took about ten minutes to set up an account anyway.

 

I gave myself the very fake name Brooke Stratus because it sounded very blonde even though I wasn’t. Then I ran out of ideas. I pulled up Harmony’s profile to compare.

 

She had a profile picture taken from a high angle with her lips pursed and cropped just enough to see moderate cleavage. It was almost scientific how she set that up. I didn’t have enough girl friends to teach me these things. Hell, I didn’t have any friends at the moment. I attempted to copy her blueprint and after about 20 pictures, I settled on one. Though, I looked more like a fish and my cleavage wasn’t extraordinary. You could also see all the boxes in the background. Not perfect.

 

I uploaded it and made it the pinned post, along with an uplifting sounding message that I probably copied from somewhere but I couldn’t remember where.

 

After looking it over for about a minute, I felt stupid. Deeply embarrassed. I didn’t like the idea of putting myself out there like that, even if it wasn’t my name. I could never do this for a living. I could barely even do it once. I could see what people were going to say and I didn’t want to give them the chance to say it. I’d rather be no one. But I left the account active for now just so I could assess the results later, for investigative purposes.

 

Next order of business was sleuthing Harmony’s pages, and that’s when I had an idea. She had nearly a hundred thousand fans... I should talk to them. Surely there would be some obsessives who would know more about her than she would know about herself. But I couldn’t talk to them as me... or as Brooke... I had to be one of them.

 

So I went undercover twice in one night. New account: Daniel R. Less creative, by design. I spent the next hour frequenting comment sections, fan pages, blog posts, and reddit threads.

 

I waded through hoards of ghastly hate comments and even ghastlier sexual comments. More than a few complained that she “changed” after her trip began. Many said she stopped responding to their messages. How she ever responded to that many messages in the first place was beyond me.

 

One reddit post caught my eye, however. An image post, featuring a screenshot from a video I didn’t recognize. It featured Harmony in a very low-cut red top, sitting on a couch looking at the camera. The text on the post read: “Waiting for her to bring back the red top from the deleted video” along with a few drooling emojis.

 

Harmony had over a thousand uploaded videos... What would cause her to delete one? I went to the comments. Amidst all the ones gawking at her tits, there was a comment asking which video this was. The original poster replied:

 

“She posted it about a week before Paris, then took it down a few days later.”

 

That had to mean something. I needed to find that video. I decided to DM the original poster. I just had to sound convincing... I spent a few minutes curating my message.

 

“Brooo do u know if I can find the video with the red top anywhere? She looks so fkn hot, I’m gooning rn.”

 

I couldn’t tell you where I learned the term gooning. I just hoped it was still in vogue and not replaced by some other strange word.

 

There was no immediate response. After about another hour of looking around, I decided to call it a night. I intended to catch up on a few missing hours of sleep, and hopefully I would get some results tomorrow.

 

“I’m sorry. It has to be you.” My eyes shot open, though I couldn’t tell if I was awake or not. I recognized the voice. I heard it in so many videos by now. It sounded like it was in my head.

 

My room was nearly pitch black. Only the faintest moonlight shone through the slats of my blinds. I scanned my room and saw nothing out of place, until my eyes reached the wall opposite the window.

 

Behind the little slivers of moonlight, something was scrawled along the wall in a dark, messy paint. My eyes adjusted and I read the words.

 

“FiND HER”

 

I wanted to leap out of my bed, I wanted to grab my gun from the night stand, but for some reason my body was unable to move. I looked down at my hand and concentrated with everything I had, but it wouldn’t even twitch.

 

When I looked back to the words though, they had changed. They now read:

 

“SaVE HER”

 

My mind caught up to me and I knew I was dreaming, but that didn’t stop the fear. It didn’t feel like MY dream.

 

A soft wooden creak from the foot of my bed. I moved my eyes to the footboard just in time to see a pale, feminine hand reach up from beneath and grasp it. A second hand followed, and then the head began to rise.

 

That face came peeking into view. Her face. Only it was worse now. She looked pale and almost emaciated, with darker circles around her eyes... Well, her eye. And that smile. Ordinarily so disarming but now full of dark intent. I expected her to crawl on top of me like she had last time, but now she just watched. Watched my helpless, immobile body from behind the footboard, giggling to herself.

 

My sliding closet door slowly opened and the shadowy man in the wide brimmed hat emerged from it, once again holding that shimmering chalice in his hands. He stalked towards me, over to the left side of the bed.

 

I heard a scraping sound coming from the right wall. I didn’t want to take my eyes off of the man, but I wasn’t in control. I looked to the wall and to the words. They had changed once more.

 

“KiLL HER”

 

My head turned back and the man was no longer holding the goblet, he was holding the goat’s head. Harmony’s pale hands grabbed me from the other side, forced my head back, and opened my mouth. The man held the goat’s head over top of me and a trickle of blood fell into my mouth. It tasted of both copper and rot.

 

I did everything I could to stop it. Everything I could to get the awful taste out. But it continued to drip. The drip grew into a steady stream, and the stream seemed to increase in pressure with every passing moment. My mouth was full of the viscous blood and I felt it trickle down my throat.

 

One of Harmony’s hands pinched my nose as the blood continued to pour into me. My airways were completely blocked and I began to choke. As I choked, more blood filled my throat and my lungs. My heart beat out of my chest, my veins popped, my entire body pulsated in sheer panic, my adrenaline spiked, I was drowning.

 

The blood did not relent. I tried to gasp, but only swallowed more. My consciousness slowly began to slip. It all went black. Then I heard her voice again.

 

“Behind your eye is the shore. The other side is the ocean. She is in the ocean. I am on the shore.”

 

I shot awake, violently coughing and gasping for air before finally finding it. My heart was practically exploding, and my head was throbbing so much worse than before. That stabbing pain behind my eye was beyond fierce and my vision was almost going cloudy. But after a few minutes I managed to ease my hyperventilation and stave off a panic attack.

 

Despite that, I couldn’t shake it completely no matter how hard I tried. It was hard enough to shake the last dream, but this one... I never had a dream that felt like that before. I’ve had nightmares, sure. Tons of them. I’ve seen awful things, doing what I do, and it does stick with you. But not like this.

 

It wasn’t even a debate in my head. It wasn’t a conversation. It wasn’t even a single word. It was just... a feeling. Deep in the recesses of my mind. One that ignored all logic and sanity. A feeling that maybe these dreams weren’t just dreams.
