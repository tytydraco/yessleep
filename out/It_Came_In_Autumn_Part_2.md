The thud on the roof snapped us back to the gravity of the situation. "There's no way that was real right?" Kyla said. I did a quick run down in my mind of everything I'd seen. "Uh yeah th-that was real," I stammered. How was this possible?

The squirrel was *massive* and everything about it was just… wrong. It had way more than 4 front teeth and they were shaped more like a shark's, so sharp and jagged one after another. Its claws were impossibly long and razor sharp. It was missing half of its tail with bleached white bone showing, its legs not faring any better. Its nose was missing and you could see its ribs like something had taken a chunk out of it… I didn't dare spend time thinking about what could have done that to this massive thing, I shuttered subconsciously. Its gray fur was matted heavily with a dried brown substance… blood. Most upsetting of all… it had two heads, each with its own set of monstrous horns and these beady glowing red eyes that sent chills down my spine.

"What do we do Chris?!"

"Honestly Kyla I-I don't know. But we need to get out of here!"

Suddenly we heard the sound of skittering around the house. I have no idea how this massive thing was still agile enough to move like a normal squirrel but I didn't question it, nothing was normal about this one. We heard the upstairs window shatter. We only looked at each other briefly before it was followed by the sound of the garage door being ripped off.

I nearly crapped my pants and looking at Kyla I think she felt the same. There was no time to recuperate when the back sliding glass door shattered. It was time to move! Kyla stood frozen in fear as the beast shoved its massive body through the frame leaving behind fur and tissue.

I wasted no time and grabbed her by the wrist and ran. I had no direction in mind, just the hell away from there. We ended up back outside racing for the treeline. This thing was impossibly fast. It had already managed to break free of the house and was hot on our heels. We started at a full sprint.

We made it maybe a half mile zigging this way, zagging the other way. Just trying to put distance between it and us. Hoping to cause confusion by not just running a straight path. I don't know why we thought that would help considering this monster could bound from tree to tree. It had a great view of us no matter what we did. I guess because we really weren't thinking, just trying to get away somehow. 

We managed to dodge all the branches that fell from above, barely being hit a few times. We could hear that it was still gaining on us and our tanks were near empty. I glanced at Kyla knowing she was tired but willing her to keep pushing forward. We had to break free of the woods soon. Shouldn't we? I felt a new panic rise inside me… we should have at least reached the river by now. How much did we really zig and zag?! 

Kyla must have sensed it because she looked back and had the same look of panic. "Chris, where are we?!" She panted out between heavy breaths. I so badly wanted to tell her everything would be okay, that I knew exactly where we were but I just couldn't. I tried to think of any words of encouragement or anything positive in this impossible situation but I could only come up with a meager, "We're getting closer to the river it should be right up there, just keep going!" I knew these words were a lie but I had to keep her going. And that's when it happened.. 

Kyla tripped… I stopped in my tracks and turned around to try and grab her but it was too late. The beast dropped from the trees and grabbed her in its claws. When the hell had it gotten so close?!

I stood there in shock, I wanted to save her but she yelled, "Go Chris, it's too late… RUN!" And I'm so ashamed to say that I did. I left her there. Her screams will haunt me until the day I die. I was stupid enough to look back and saw the beast raise her to its heads and they fought each other over her body. 

I can't believe I just left her like that. I feel like such a coward but that was the type of person Kyla was. She would always sacrifice herself to put others first. Another reason I loved her so much. It made my heart ache and my stomach ache but I ran anyway. 

I ran as fast as I could, as far as I could hoping that maybe Kyla was a big enough meal that I had time to get away. I'm so stupid! I was in such a frenzy to get away that I managed to get lost even deeper in my *own* woods. I'm hunkered down by this fallen tree praying that it won't be able to sniff me out. I've tried calling the police over and over but I only have one bar of service and it won't connect. I don't know what to do. I'm so scared.

I hoped maybe if someone got this message they would be able to find me, call the police something! But I feel that this is just going to be my final words.

I hear it coming… it's in the trees, the branches are snapping and leaves are falling everywhere. I hear it coming from two different directions.. I looked up and this time, a little urine did escape… There were 8 sets of red beady eyes staring down at me… 4 to my left and 4 to my right.

If you do get this message please tell Kyla's family I'm so sorry…
