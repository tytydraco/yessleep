I just moved back into my parents’ house at the beginning of the summer. I went to university out of state and stayed on campus, so after I got my journalism B.A. I decided to come home to get my bearings before I decide what I really want to do, like for a full living. The reason this is important to mention is because I haven’t really been home for more than a handful of days here and there for about four years. I've been missing holidays lately, too, since up until recently I had a boyfriend whose family lived near campus.

My sister (technically half-sister, I’ll call her Marie for her privacy) is eight years younger than me. Her fourteenth birthday was right after I got home, and the difference between ten years old when I last saw her to fourteen years old now is… definitely noticeable.

The last time I saw her, she was sitting at the kitchen table playing some cartoon game on her iPad. When I got home, she didn’t come out of her room until my stepmom knocked on her bedroom door twice and told her I was there and she needed to come out. And the girl who came out was not someone I recognized.

She looked… unpolished. It sounds weird to describe a fourteen year old girl, but I just don’t really know how else to put it. Marie has always been careful about her hygiene and appearance to the point of making my parents concerned. Like, this is a girl who once cried because she got a spot of toothpaste on her pajamas. When I saw her then she looked gaunt and pale and dark all at the same time. She was wearing clothes that looked washed out and stringy, and I almost thought she was a grown woman because her dark circles are so dark.

It sounds shallow and mean. I swear I’m not trying to be and I would never talk like this about my sister if I wasn’t worried like this. I know when kids become teenagers they sometimes go through drastic changes, too, but… this wasn’t normal.

She came out and looked at me like she didn’t know I was there. Even after I said hello and asked how she was, she didn’t speak. My dad and my stepmom were giving me the sort of smiles you give people when you want someone to come help you, and when Marie turned right around and went back inside her room, they ushered me to mine.

We chatted a little bit, and when I addressed the elephant in the room they said Marie’s change had been a slow decline followed by a sharp plummet. She would scream and growl at them like a wild animal if they tried to go inside her room, so they just… didn’t. There was no way to get her to go somewhere she didn’t want to, and part of the slow decline had been a loss of enthusiasm for school, which they thought they remedied when they compromised and enrolled her in an online high school, which she was expected to start in August.

Then they begged me to try and talk to her and find out what was going on. Marie would never trust them like they trusted me, and maybe I could help pull her out of whatever slump she was in. Sounded like mental illness to me, I told them, but… you know how parents cringe away from things like that. They’re Gen X and never learned how to talk about it.

That night we ate dinner without Marie, though they wrapped up some leftovers for her, and then watched television until my parents went to bed. I stayed out in the living room, sitting on the couch and working on a few job applications with the TV on and the lights off. To my total surprise, Marie came out of her room around 11 p.m., and I didn’t notice her standing in the entryway between the bedrooms and the living room, silently watching me until I looked up and saw her there, jumping just about all the way out of my skin.

Marie had been a well-fed, healthy little girl, but now she looked… narrow. I don’t know. Her figure in the doorway didn’t even look real. But I said hi to her and asked again how she was.

She didn’t answer me, coming toward me in strangely halting steps and plunking down on the other end of the couch, looking straight ahead.

“They put some leftovers in the fridge for you. I missed you at dinner,” I told her.

“Did they tell you about me?” Her voice was quiet and thin, but I was beyond relieved she was speaking at all.

“They said some things,” I admitted right away, “but I wanted to hear it from you.”

She didn’t say anything for a long time, staring at the other end of the room like someone sitting there was threatening her. The way the lights from the TV hit her made her look even worse. I went back to what I was doing, because, not to be mean, looking at her was making me feel sick.

I was hitting submit on an application at the local paper when she said something again. “I got in a fight with Amy about a year ago.”

Marie and Amy had been inseparable best friends for years. They’d had blowouts before, which usually were fixed in heart-to-hearts in Roblox or whatever, so I nodded like I understood. “What about?”

“She decided she wanted to be goth and said she was really a vampire. I told her she looked like a poser. We fought. She bit me. Hard.”

Then she pulled away the ragged gray shirt she wore, revealing a series of deep, imperfectly-healed gouges in the shape of little teeth marks. I gasped. “Jesus Christ. Did you go to the hospital? You need shots after someone bites you. You can get hepatitis and worse.”

The thousand-yard stare remained, and she didn’t look around, and didn’t look at me when she answered.

“No. I bit her back.”

She got up and left the room, not retrieving her leftovers from the fridge. I didn’t see her eat, but I chewed on that conversation as I finished my final applications, and then even more as I was staring at the ceiling in bed.

Marie’s birthday was that weekend. It was June and hot out during the day, so my parents said they were going to take us out for dinner and cake that night. I woke up with strep throat, which I probably earned on the way home from university, so I told them to go. Marie was resistant, but when my stepmom threatened to take her door off its hinges (gross), she acquiesced and got in the car with them. So they left.

I had gotten the feeling no one had been in Marie’s room in a long time, and after what she’d said about the fight with Amy, I wondered if there was more to the story. So I opened the door and looked in.

It was *dark*.

The light switch didn’t work, and when I shined my phone light up at the ceiling, she’d removed the bulb from the fixture on the ceiling at some point. I didn’t see any lamps or any light sources other than a few candles, and I didn’t want the wax to be soft when she got back, so I used my phone.

To my surprise, her room was pretty meticulously clean. Her sheets had been stripped off the queen-sized hand-me-down mattress I used to sleep on, and now sat folded neatly in the corner. No food or trash could be found anywhere. Her laptop sat in the middle of her desk. Her bookshelves were empty. What did she do in here all day?

I was shining the light this way and that, and I was about to leave feeling guilty that I didn’t find anything that would explain the change in behavior. If she thought Amy was really a vampire after all that, did that mean Marie was going through some sort of extreme Twilight phase where she was doing rituals and stuff and thought she was a vampire too?

Despite my efforts, I couldn’t find any indication of what she was into, because her room was bare. I took note of the fact that the screen in her window was gone. Maybe she was sneaking out and seeing the wrong crowd, but none of this really explained the extreme reaction she’d given my parents when they tried to come in. It was clean and, though worryingly unadorned, nothing to protect.

I inspected her window for a moment before turning to finally leave when I noticed something that looked like a line in black nail polish coming from under her bedframe. It was so dark in the room I don’t know why I even noticed it, but with the complete lack of anything else in her bedroom, I must have been looking for anything out of place.

If there was a line, maybe it was a drawing. Maybe it was actually some preteen ritual that had taken place and she was getting into the occult with the Satanists that were always rumored to be chanting to each other and sacrificing animals at some undisclosed location in the woods.

I pulled the bed away from the wall, dragging it as far as I could and taking a breath before stepping back around.

The gray and stiff body of Amy was on the ground, arms spread wide and hands nailed to the floor at both ends of a horizontal black line. As soon as I stopped reeling long enough to take in any other details, I could see a vertical line painted behind the rest of her body.

It was like a crucifixion, but I don’t think she died of starvation. A crude, blunt wooden post stuck out from her chest, approximately where her heart would be. A cross was painted on her forehead, too.

I’m a journalism major. I’ve never seen a real dead body, but I notice now in retrospect that the body didn’t… really smell like anything. Musty, maybe, but not like rot or decay or anything like that. I didn’t want my sister to get in trouble, and if the body had been there that long, what could it hurt to wait a bit longer?

It’s been a few months by now, and when Marie looks at me I think she knows that I saw what she was hiding. I think she trusts me not to say anything.

I want to get her some help, but I can’t stop thinking that maybe my sister never thought she was turning into a vampire. Maybe she thought she was a vampire hunter.

I don’t know which would be worse: if Marie was wrong and just killed her best friend for trying to find an identity, or if she was right and her best friend wasn’t the only one.
