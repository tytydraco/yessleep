**\~ Welcome Back \~**

*\[Monday\]*

*“Phone…”*

*“Check”*

*“Wallet…”*

*“Check”*

*“Keys…”*

*“Check”*

*“Laptop…”*

*“Check”*

*Alright, back to it* – I tell myself internally, attempting to coach myself through the day. Which, of all days - I could certainly use the extra help today. That’s for sure.

No, I don’t dislike my job – quite the opposite actually. I genuinely enjoy what I do and who I work with. It’s a great position, wages are more than fair, benefits are better than most, and I guess the vacation time is nothing to complain about.

*You see – that last one’s ironic, because today is my first day back after a two-week vacation to Aruba. Yes, it was fantastic – and no, I’d much rather still be there on the beach.*

I’d wager any normal person – yes, even those who truly love their professions – are, and even if just the slightest amount, at least a little reluctant to go back into the office that first day after a vacation. I mean, truly – the whole reason for a vacation is to escape the normal, often mundane, daily routine. You know it already - day in and day out, Monday through Friday, for what seems like eternity over the years. In my opinion: doing the same thing over and over again, especially without a break every so often – it would drive me completely mad. Spontaneity is an absolute necessity in life; always remember that. At least that’s my two cents anyway. Granted I think *almost* everyone would agree with me on that.

*“There she is”* – I say to myself; after turning the corner on 9^(th) Ave and now making eye contact with the cookie-cutter, stereotypical office tower our corporation is seated in. First time laying eyes on it in two weeks. Even spoiled to have a peaceful, crisp, fall morning for the weather today - though it’s still nothing like what I was truly spoiled with the prior two weeks. I’m surprised I remembered where the building was after all this time – rather, after all those drinks on the trip more like it…

*Elevator 4 , the usual. I glance down at my watch after pressing the call button.*

*\[7:52AM\]*

*“Wow, look at you – coming in right on time after being out for two weeks. You know what, why don’t you just take another week off for all your efforts!” – I wistfully fantasize about how my supervisor would greet me today, as I step into the elevator. I guess you never know, right?*      

Typically, the elevator ride is where I do my quick daily plan or refresh for what I need to get done today. Whether it’s a follow up or two from the day before, or something like new client leads to strategize, and pursue – it’s part of my daily routine to help prepare me for the task at hand. But today, no planning or strategizing from being out. Just peace and silence, waiting patiently while listening to the elevator bell slowly and methodically chime each passing floor on the ride up.

*\*ding\**

*“Floor 24”*

*Alright, now really back at it.*

After stepping out from the elevator, I proceed down the ever so familiar hallway that leads to my office near the end. And no, trust me I wish I did, but I do not have a corner office. Instead, I’m not entirely sure I’d call my office much of an actual office in the first place. Oh – I guess someone brought breakfast in today. Well, look at that; not a bad day back after all. My apologies, the break room is off the same hallway to my office and a box of donuts caught my eye. Anyway, about my office. It’s noticeably smaller than the other manager’s offices on the floor, and really nothing to brag about. In fact, I think it used to be a printer or copy room some years back when the previous group still held the lease. I have no complaints though – it’s cozy, private –

“Hey Stranger!”

*Ah, Rachel. Possibly the one person I looked forward to seeing again today.*

*“I’m sorry have we met?”*

“Very funny. So! How was the trip? You need to tell me all about it! Looks like you got a lot of color. All rested and recharged now?”

*Rachel’s consistently vibrant and energetic presence was why I rarely, if ever needed coffee for my mornings at work.*

*“It was great! I had a genuinely good time. Two of the days we did a snorkeling experience with instructors along the coral reefs there, which was amazing to see upfront and close. The food was so delicious, the weather was beautiful, the sunsets were gorgeous. Plain and simple - it was incredible. But yeah, thank you for asking.”*

“Assuming you’re probably thrilled to be back then, huh.”

*Attempting to push my buttons early it seems.*  

*“Yeah…totally. But so far so good though.”*

“Well, now that you’re back and not ditching all of us - you can finally meet the new girl that started last week.”

*I sensed even more sarcasm in her tone than from her previous comment.*

*“…why do you say it like that?”*

“Oh, you’ll see. I just – okay look. I don’t want to be rude or speculate… But… I just think there’s something...”

*She says increasingly quieter while twirling her index finger around her ear.*

*“Ah…yep, that’s it.”*

*I say while clearly gesturing that I do not believe her assumption.*

“I’m telling you – something is up! She’s now brought in donuts every single day since starting. Every day! I mean really, how many donuts do we even need here?”

*“Sounds like she’s been a great addition to the team if you ask me”*

*I can visibly see her skin turning flush as from myself not taking this seriously.*

“Stop – I’m being serious. I even feel bad, because I really think it’s something with her memory. Like - medical level stuff. Why else would she keep doing it?”

*“I mean, I don’t know. Care to explain your prognosis, doctor?”*

*Her glare acutely shows her appreciation towards my humor.*

“Okay just find out for yourself then. But you’ll see! I promise.”

*“I’m sure it’s no big deal. Maybe you’re just being too nosy… Per usual.”*

*I didn’t even attempt to contain my smile as I say this. She rolls her eyes while also smiling in return.*

“Whatever – I should probably go anyway to let you catch up on all that work you now have waiting for you.”

*“Ha…good one.”*

*Though she’s highly likely to be right.*

“Oh! I almost forgot. Are you still good for this Wednesday then?

- - -

*I stare at her blankly without any expression.*

- - -

“Don’t tell me you forgot already! Happy hour with the team, remember?”

*Totally don’t remember.*

*“Oh, yeah – of course. Yeah, I’m in”*

*Definitely forgot.*

“Geez – better be careful. Looks like the new girl is already rubbing off on you.”

*She says smugly, while sprinkled with some sarcasm – or at least, I hope.*

*“Rach... Rude.”*

“How do you know if it is? You haven’t even met her yet to know otherwise.”

*She says mockingly, while gleefully exiting my office.*

*I guess she has a point – but still.*

Before I continue, I felt it appropriate to inform you that I very much do not care for office gossip and drama. I am simply here to do my job to the best of my ability, and then go home afterwards. That doesn’t mean I won’t be friends with anyone who wants to be, but I’m just not terribly interested in other people’s personal lives outside of the office – unless they are a close friend like Rachel. Rachel on the other hand; I don’t know how she gets the information she does. She’s essentially the office spy of personal information amongst the team members. Right place, right time, every time – or so it seems. That being said, she certainly planted a seed of curiosity in me regarding this new hire that started last week. I wanted to see for myself what the concern was all about. Besides – finally something exciting that isn’t work related. Spontaneity, right? Plus, donuts every single day? I don’t see how that could be an issue…

*After rifling through a few files this morning, then followed up with a bit of introspection - I sit reclined in my desk chair, twirling my pen while glancing over the mound of paperwork now stacked on the end of my desk. I knew it would be difficult to get into the right mindset to tackle the leftover work from the previous weeks, but now my mind is always circling back to this new curiosity Rachel instilled. I would like to think I have relatively good impulse control, but this urge was too much to itch - and I just had to find out more.*

*I quietly slip out of my office, and silently stroll down the hallway leading to the breakroom. My eyes keenly focused on the doorway into the kitchen as soon as I could see a sliver of the opening. I feel my heart suddenly beating through my chest, as I progress down the hallway and approach the door. “I guess anxiety over not knowing what to expect?” – I ask myself as if it would actually benefit anything. The pulsing rhythm of my heartbeat echoes within my eardrums as I nervously turn the corner into the room. I can barely hear my footsteps from the echoing percussive thumps in my head and chest.*

*Empty.*

*Just a box of donuts.*

*I quietly let out a rather large sigh of relief, feeling actually quite silly that I would let something like that get me so worked up. “What am I even thinking” – I whisper to myself. It’s just a new person who was hired on-*

“Hello”

*I practically threw my half-eaten donut into the air.*

*“Oh WOW… I am... so sorry - I did not see you coming at all.”*

*I anxiously chuckle as I try to clean up my act.*

*After brushing a few crumbs off my sleeves, I refocus my attention to the person now standing right next to me, as I still haven’t noticed who it was.*

“My name is Liz”

*Our eyes meet. Instantly I feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up. There was a rather significant amount of time before I could finally muster my response, or at least it felt like it in the moment.*

*“...Hey Liz - I’m Jeff.”*

*I say rather nervously.*

*“Um… I heard you just recently started here, and also brought in these donuts? Thanks for doing that and welcome to the team. How’s everything going so far?”*

*Our eyes remain locked. She appeared relatively young overall, maybe mid 20’s. Though the skin around her face accentuated her cheek bones in a similar way to a very elderly and frail individual. Across her forehead the skin appeared to be tightly knit into her scalp and stretched as far as possible to cover any exposed areas from a procedure of some sort. I truthfully couldn’t tell if I was just projecting or seeing things at this point. But the rest of her face contours seemed slightly disfigured; I don’t know how else to explain it more accurately – but it certainly didn’t appear natural and left an eerie feeling in my gut. She had these large, piercing, pale blue eyes. There was a strange murkiness to them; as if glossed over, with large, dilated pupils beneath. It reminded me of a doll’s eyes – especially when complimented against her fair-toned facial complexion. It was an empty, cold, detached gaze – almost reptilian or at least cold-blooded - that made me feel she was looking through me, not at me. It was at that very moment that I now understood what the uncanny valley phenomenon is about – or what it’s like to experience. Even though there was a physical person standing right in front of me;* ***it did not feel as though there was****.*

“Enjoy”

*She says squealy, as she then proceeds to skip, almost gallop away down the other hall with her strikingly long, thin legs.*

*I gasp rather loudly to catch my breath for the first time since she stood before me. I felt frozen for a few seconds, but then frantically looked around to see if anyone else was nearby, or even witnessed the interaction. All the while not being sure if what just happened was even real or if I had somehow imagined it altogether. Though any further introspection was to unquestionably be done from my office, as I hastily made my way back and closed my door for the remainder of the business day. I didn’t bother to finish or even grab the other half of my donut that I left behind in the break room to say the least. As a further precaution, I chose to exit rather stealthily at business close.*
