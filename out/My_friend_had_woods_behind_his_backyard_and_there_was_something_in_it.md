I heard from some friends that these forms might know something about weird phenomena. So I thought I would explain what's been happening recently and hope you guys have some answers. So I’m moving out of my parents house after graduating high school and I was going through my stuff and found something weird.

I found a picture of me, my brother and my brother's friend, let’s call him Josiah, I do not want to use his real name because I never got permission.

When I saw this picture I got a flurry of memories, I always remembered that we all used to hangout when we were all in elementary school but these memories are different, I suppressed them.

Josiah had a big backyard. It led into some woods nearby, we often used to play in his backyard but his mom always told us not to go into the woods.

We almost never went into the woods, Josiah and my brother were about 5 years older than me, so I was always scared to go into the woods and they understood that and stayed with me. 

However one day, I was about 6 and they were about 11. We were sitting in a spot we called our fort, it was just a spot right under a hill we put a bunch of sticks over.

It was getting dark, and we were starting to get annoyed with Josiah cause he kept asking.

“Did you hear that?” 

There was never any sound he would just ask.

“Did you hear that?”

We’d always say no and then continue the conversation. While this would not have annoyed me had it been once or twice it was every other sentence he’d ask if we had heard anything. Eventually my brother snapped.

“No, no one heard anything, and you’re not gonna hear anything if you keep asking” He was obviously not gonna do anything we were just annoyed.

“Just listen, there’s whispers” I remember being confused but my brother seemed to get concerned, we both sat there quietly and tired to listen.

“Must be in your head cause we don’t hear anything do we?” He turned back to look at me and I nodded, I hadn't heard anything.

Josiah started to walk away, he hadn’t said anything, just walked away.

We thought he probably just went back to his house because it was dark. 

Maybe he had gotten annoyed with us too and just wanted to go to his room. 

So the two of us decided to get up and walk back to his house.

Cause we didn’t want to just be sitting in the backyard when it got dark.

That’s when my brother saw him, he was walking towards the woods.

Me and my brother ran over to him to stop him.

“Where are you going?” My brother called out.

“My Mom is calling for me” He responded, this confused us.

“Your Mom is in the woods?” My brother asked 

“Sweety, come here” that’s when we heard it, it sounded like his Mom, but something was off, the air was cold, I could tell even as a kid that, that was not his Mom.

My brother sees something, his face goes cold and he screams, Josiah seems to break out of the trance he is in and walks over to us. 

“Let’s get back to my house” He says, he seems shaken.

This was the last time that me and my brother would see Johsia, he was found dead the next week, in the woods, we moved shortly after.

The weirdest thing to me, is that I don’t remember him dying, I don’t remember hanging out with him after that but I remember getting told that he died now, but before seeing that picture.

I don’t remember him dying, he couldn’t have, I would remember that.

I looked into it. I found the details of everything, I wish I didn’t. It was a lot to read about a friend.

The weirdest thing of all of this, is that the picture with the three of us together, it had a date on the back, the date was a month after he died.

I need to investigate this, I think, I think I’ll go to the woods again, I have to find out what is out there, and why.

I can hear them now too, the whispers I mean after the memories came back the whispers started, every now and then I hear them say

“Come to the woods”
