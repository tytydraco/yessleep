The Arctic winds whispered secrets through the desolate corridors of the research station, and a quiet tension settled between Emily and me. The isolation seemed to cast shadows on her familiar features, and I fear that the whole situation is making Emily extremely depressed(and rightfully so).

In the dim lamplight, Emily's eyes lingered on the research logs, tracing the names of the departed researchers with a fleeting recognition. When I inquired about it, she dismissed it as a "momentary lapse of memory" as her gaze shifted away from mine before I could scrutinize the subtlety of her reaction.

I asked Emily if she was okay, to which she tersely replied, "I'm fine." I seriously am worried sick about her. The person that I love the most in the whole world is seemingly drifting away from reality as the day has continued.

Late last night, as the winds embraced the station, I woke to a quiet tapping sound. Rubbing the tiredness from my eyes, I realized something was off. Despite the strange tapping sound, the room was completely quiet, devoid of Emily's usual snoring. Then, I realized what was wrong: Emily, who sleeps in the bunk below mine, is gone.

Quaking with fear, I ran to the door, where all of the furniture being used as a makeshift barricade was carefully displaced. "Emily!! Where are you?" I screamed, with no regard for my own safety. I ran around the station, hunting for my beloved. I stumbled upon her in a remote corner, engaged in hushed conversations with unseen entities. "Emily!" I cried, "What the fuck are you doing here?" Her explanation was a desire for solace, but she refused to explain why she needed to be alone as we navigated back to our room through the shadows of the station halls.

In the quiet moments of fortifying our room yet again against an unknown threat, Emily's satisfaction with the barricades seemed disproportionate to the danger we faced. A subtle look of contentment played in her eyes, unnoticed unless one looked beyond the immediate urgency of the situation. It felt to me as if she had given up on the situation, and whatever happened would happen.

The subtlety of Emily's actions became a labyrinth of doubt, obscured by the harsh reality of our surroundings. The isolation, the biting cold, and the pervasive darkness have made Emily into a shell of a person. I fear that I am losing her.

As the anticipated arrival of the rescue plane approached excruciatingly slowly, Emily became more and more empty. Nonetheless, I have upheld my vow to myself and Emily to protect her in our predicament, no matter what. The sounds that we hear every night seem to get louder and louder as the days pass. I've started sleeping with a chef's knife under my pillow that I took from the station kitchen. Although it's not much, it may be enough to protect Emily and myself.

The tapping isn't getting any quieter, so I think I'll just go to sleep. Good night everyone, and I'll let you guys know any updates tomorrow night. That is, if I live through the night.
