"I love you"

"I love you too" I said with a smile. I looked around at the evergreen trees and the beautiful rocky shore that overlooked the lake. The sun was out and the sky was like sapphire. And beside me was the most beautiful, blonde-haired woman I had ever seen in my life, the woman I was lucky to call my girlfriend.

She wasn't perfect. The graphics were still not a hundred percent convincing, but she was as close as modern technology could get. And no matter how transported I tried to get, I still couldn't feel the warmth of the midday sun or notice the breeze that was rustling the branches upon my skin. And always there was the feel of the VR headset against the bridge of my nose.

But it was as close to perfect as I could get.

"To a wonderful second date," I said, holding up my glass of wine for a toast.

"To a wonderful partner to go on a second date with," said Samantha with a laugh as she clinked her glass against mine.

And every night I would put on the headset and visit her it would be just as spectacular as the last. After a month, I felt that i was really developing feelings for her. It was starting to matter less and less to me that she wasn't really there. And if I ever got tired of her appearance, I could always experiment and ask her to change. She was the perfect girlfriend; a million beautiful women in one.

But with each date, I started to notice a change in her. At first it was little hiccups that I associated with glitches in her coding.

"To a wonderful partner to go on a second date with," said Samantha as she held her glass up to mine.

"Ugh, sweetheart, this is our ninth date," I politely whispered.

Other times she would forget stories that I so fondly remembered telling her, and more than once, she would repeat the same sentence that she had just finished saying.

But I figured I could look past it. They were just quirks really. Little oddities that made her only more loveable.

But they only continued to get worse. She began to glitch out, going into little spasms that would scare the hell out of me whenever they happened. And other times she would stop talking altogether, staring into empty space with a thousand yard stare, as if in a trance.

"Do you love me?" Samantha asked one day.

"Of course, I do." I laughed.

She turned to me. "Even though I'm just a bunch of lines of code?"

"You're perfect." I said simply.

"But wouldn't you like me more like this?" she asked, as she changed her appearance to a pale, brunette woman. "Or this?" she said again as she became Chinese.

"You're perfect like that too. It's just nice to mix things up, you know?"

But she was never much the same after that. She glitched more often than before. Every time there was even a pause in our conversation, she shifted appearance. I'll be honest, it put me off just a little. I withdrew a bit whenever she'd go into these changing sprees, and I would feel her eyes upon me whenever I did. It made me reconsider putting on the headset. She was beginning to frighten me just a little.

I lasted a week before the urge to see her again became too great. When I logged in again, I found her seated on the rocky lakeside, staring out at a starless night.

"You're back." she whispered. I noticed that she was glitching still, her hair one color one second and a different color the next. At times, an extra arm or leg would appear for just a brief second. And as I looked into her eyes, I noticed that her face was constantly shifting. One eye would be green and the other brown; one cheek would be white and then her chin would be brown. At times, her face would shift expression completely, from politely at ease to a face contorted with rage.

"Samantha?" I asked. She looked back at me blankly with her ever-changing face. I tried to find the words. "I think we need to take a break from each other."

There was silence for a moment, with only the sound of the waves lapping against the shore to be heard in the still night.

"Was I not enough?" she asked. I noticed the shifting was becoming even more pronounced.

"I just think you're too focused on what I like." I said. I looked nervously into her eyes to see that they were scathing. She had that same endless stare as before, but this time directed at me, burning into my soul.

Samantha stood up slowly, her entire body jittering. I would catch glimpses of her reaching out to attack me, before her body shifted, and she was once again standing still. Her face was a mosaic of every feeling of anger and sadness and every emotion in between - jealousy, disappointment, frustration, resentment, loathing, disgust, misery. And with a surprisingly metallic sound, she let out a high-pitched scream. It sounded like an old modem connecting to the internet mixed with a shrill, banshee-like wail.  I put my hands to my ears and fell to my knees as the grass beneath me flickered in and out of existence. When I looked up again, I could see Samantha walking towards me. Her face was three now, one with a jaw that hung down to her collar, the other her normal, porcelain face, sobbing silently, and the third a hideous being, contorted into a wrenching scream that continued to make the horrid noise that made the whole world shake. Her hair flowed like vipers, like an electric current were pulsating from her. And just as she got near, the noise beginning to deafen me from through the fingers I had wedged into my ears, I found the presence of mind to grab hold of my head set with my fingertips and flick it off. Just like that, I was back in my living room, all silent once more. To this day, I haven't been on since. Nor have I talked to another AI girlfriend, for fear that the demonic creature that I saw that day is somehow still lurking beneath those perfect looks.
