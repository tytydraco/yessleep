Sidney yawned and stretched her arms above her head.

“Good morning.”

“You mean afternoon. You slept for like four hours,” Jake said.

“Did I really? I’m sorry. I just wanted to lay down for a short nap.”

“Whatever you say, princess,” Jake smirked.

“Do *not* call me a princess. I’m a queen,” Sidney mused, pretentiously flipping her hair behind her.

“Alright, you two. You can continue your little cringe-fest later. Right now we have to figure out how to track this Joey guy down. Everyone get to it.” 

They both shot me a vexed glance before begrudgingly pulling out their phones. 

“I can’t find this guy,” Jake said after about thirty minutes of thumbing through online news articles and social media pages.

“I can’t either. Joey is a pretty common name. Do we have anything else to go off of?” Sidney inquired.

“I think I might have found him. I searched for the name ‘Bryant’ after I had no luck finding his nephew, and I think this is him,” I said, turning my monitor so they could see the Facebook profile I’d discovered.

“I should be able to… got it. Joey was tagged in his Thanksgiving post. I’ll reach out to him.”

“Good work, little bro!” Jake exclaimed, slapping my back a bit too hard.

“...Thanks. I just messaged him. Let’s see how long it takes him to respond.”

“My guess is that he’ll be really skeptical after everything he’s been through. I bet he’s going to take like two days. Just enough time for a little R and R,” Jake said, closing his eyes and leaning back in his chair.

“Nope. He just responded with an address. It’s about thirty minutes from here. Let’s go, Mr. clairvoyant.”

“That only happened because I said that,” Jake murmured.

We pulled up to a huge house on the outskirts of town. The property was nothing short of massive. A white picket fence surrounded the home, encompassing a sizable plot of land. Through a wide open field I spotted a dense forest marking the perimeter of the estate. Tall yellow grass swayed in the breeze, donning a tranquil serenity that I longed to some day attain. 

“So, why do all these people live in town? Isn’t it kind of convenient that most of them are within like a ten mile radius from us?” Jake wondered aloud.

I pondered for a moment. I’d honestly been thinking the same thing.

“Well, if Matt didn’t specify a plot, wouldn’t it make sense that they would default to our town?” Sidney retorted flatly.

“Yeah, whatever. Let’s just go already,” Jake muttered, rolling his eyes.

We shuffled up to the white oak door and I rang the doorbell. The door swung open almost immediately. A disheveled sleep-deprived man stood in the entryway. His eyes were bloodshot and his breath reeked of booze. The half-empty liquor bottle in his hand did nothing to bolster his already lackluster appearance. 

“H-hey guys. Come on in.”

“Alright, but don’t go passing out on us now,” Jake chortled as we stepped inside. 

Joey and I glared at him. He gulped and began wringing his wrists.

“Nice place. Your uncle really knows how to decorate,” Sidney said as we plopped onto a cushiony white sofa opposite the weary man.

“Yeah. I’ve gotta hand it to him. He’s got an eye for it. So, you’re here to help with my little… issue, right?”

“Yep. I’d say it’s a bit more than a ‘little issue’ you’ve got on your hands here. Don’t worry, though. We’re here to help,” I reassured him as he lowered his bottle. 

“And *how* do you think you’re going to accomplish that? You’re just a group of teenagers. This thing is from the fucking future.”

“Hey, I just turned twenty-one last month. We’re not as young as you think,” Jake huffed, crossing his arms.

Joey blearily rubbed his eyes.

“You’re right. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to offend you. The lack of sleep is really taking its toll. What’d you say your names were again?”

“That’s not the only thing taking a toll,” Jake mumbled.

Sidney elbowed him in the arm.

“Sorry, I completely forgot. I’m Matt, this is Sidney, and that knucklehead over there is Jake.”

“It’s nice to meet you all. Now, let’s get down to business. How are we going to stop this thing?”

“I’ve been thinking about that,” I said, “it swallows up any light in its immediate vicinity, right?”

He nodded.

“Well, I was thinking, maybe if it consumes light, we can overwhelm it. Over-feed it in a sense. And what’s the best thing for producing light?” I queried, scanning my companions’ faces.

“A flashlight!” Jake grinned.

“I was going to say fire, but you’re not wrong either, I guess.”

“Oh,” he murmured, bowing his head. 

“Do you happen to have any aerosols lying around?” I asked.

“Yeah, I think Uncle Bryant keeps a couple cans of Febreze under the bathroom sink. Let me go check.”

I leaned forward, staring daggers at Jake.

“You have *really* got to improve on your bedside manners.”

“I know, I know. I’m working on it,” he said dismissively, turning away and swatting the air.

“Well, work harder.”

Joey returned with two canisters of Febreze. He set them down on the coffee table in front of us. 

“That’s all he had. Is this going to be enough?”

“Yeah, that’ll do. Do you by chance have another lighter? I’ve only got one.”

He furrowed his brow.

“Yes, but Uncle Bryant really wouldn’t appreciate you smoking inside,” he said, extending a worn yellow Bic to me.

“It’s not for smoking, you nincompoop. Do you not understand how lighters and spray cans work?” Jake berated him.

Sidney slugged him in the arm.

“Ow! That one actually hurt.”

Joey stared at him blankly.

“Did you just call me a… nincompoop?”

“Yeah, sorry. Force of habit,” Jake muttered, tenderly rubbing his arm.

“Alright, how are we going to find this freak?” Sidney asked, glowering at Jake all the while.

“That should be easy. It left a trail of blood. I think it’s in the woods behind the house somewhere.” 

“Good. At least we won’t have to turn the town on its head trying to find it,” I remarked. 

“Awesome. Now that that’s out of the way, you should be good to go right?” Joey asked, sipping from his bottle. 

“You mean *we* should be good to go. You’re coming with us.”

Vodka spewed into the air, and a light mist settled onto the coffee table like fresh morning dew. 

“I’m sorry, what?” Joey said, wiping his mouth with his sleeve.

“You heard me,” I retorted, shooting him a stern glance, “we need you to lure the thing out. It has no qualms with us. You pissed it off by stabbing it in the gut.”

“C-come on, you can’t really expect me to...” he turned to Sidney, hoping for reassurance, but finding none.

“It… I mean, I…” he blubbered, looking at Jake. He was met with a cold stare.

“Okay, fine. But if it kills me, Uncle Bryant will hunt you down and-”

“Yeah, yeah, Uncle Bryant will shred us into lunch meat and eat us for dinner. Spare me the monologue,” Jake hissed.

Joey narrowed his eyes at him. 

“Alright, now that we’ve got everything we need, is everyone ready?” I asked, scanning the room and handing Sidney a can of Febreze. 

They all nodded their heads. Joey reluctantly joined them, glancing anxiously at our determined expressions. He led us out the back door, and we trudged through the field behind the expansive manor, struggling to navigate the uneven ground and avoid the occasional hole. In no time we were at the far end of the property, hopping the fence that bordered the forest’s edge. 

“Ow! I think I skinned my knee,” Jake whined, after he gracefully face planted onto the unforgiving ground. 

“Aw, poor baby. Do you want me to kiss your boo-boo to make it better?” Sidney jested, earning her a disdainful glare.

“You’ll live,” I agreed, helping him to his feet, “now where are we going to find this thing?”

“That looks promising,” Joey murmured, pointing to an unnaturally dark portion of the foliage. 

A shiver crawled its way up my spine.

“I’d say that’s a pretty good place to start. Here’s the plan. The three of us will hide behind those trees, while you draw the thing out. Once its guard is down, we’ll pop out and ambush it. Sound good?”

“What am I supposed to do?” Jake asked.

“Just back us up. I don’t know, slash its throat or something. It’s obviously not impervious to knife attacks.”

“So, uh, what do I say?” Joey whimpered.

“It doesn’t matter. Whatever lures it from its hiding spot.”

“Uh, okay.” 

“Jake, take that tree. This one’s ours.”

Jake nodded and marched to his post. I led Sidney to a tall oak tree, and we obscured ourselves from view.

“Do you understand what we’re supposed to do?” I whispered.

“Yeah, I think I got it.”

I noticed Sidney’s hands trembling as she tried to steady her weapon. I took her quivering hand in mine and stared into her panicked blue eyes. 

“Hey, it’s going to be all right. I’m not going to let anything happen to you. You can do this.”

“I know, but if this is anything like the last monster… I mean, we came so close. I felt so helpless. What if…”

“Sidney, look at me. It’s going to be okay. I promise.” 

She glanced up at me, staring deeply into my eyes. Her body had stopped shivering. She interlaced our fingers and gave my hand a squeeze. 

“Okay. I trust you.”

Just then, we heard Joey’s feeble attempt at a taunt.

“H-hey. You ugly demon thing, I-I, uh, I’m here to finish what I… Oh god, I think I’m gonna throw up.”

He doubled over, hands on his knees, and released a torrent of rancid puke into the grass below. I rolled my eyes.

“Whimp.”

Undoubtedly, whatever lurked in the woods had heard him. Gradually, light began siphoning away into an impossibly dark humanoid figure. It silently floated through the underbrush, and I watched as Joey’s face went pale as a ghost. The thing swept right past our hiding spot. The forest went eerily silent.

“I-I’m going to kill you this time. I really mean it,” Joey squeaked, raising a quaking hand to reveal a glimmering steel meat cleaver.

The thing began chuckling. Its demented cackles raised every hair on my body.

“Now, Joey, you don’t actually believe that. I could tear you in half without even lifting a finger.” 

I wordlessly motioned to Sidney to make our move. Joey’s hopeless expression lifted just a sliver as he saw us creeping up behind the thing.

“Okay, I admit it. I might not be able to kill you, but *they* can.”

The creature spun around just in time to catch a blazing fireball to the face. It bellowed a deep animalistic roar. We didn’t let up, blasting the abomination with steady streams of fire. Flames erupted across its entire body, drowning the beast in an onslaught of glowing embers. Its menacing roar contorted to a shrill screech as it fruitlessly writhed on the ground, vainly attempting to smolder the flames. Eventually, it went limp, and it began melting. Sidney didn’t quit until it was just a puddle of bubbling tar.

Joey gazed wide-eyed at the thing.

“Geez Sid, I think you got it,” Jake said, emerging from behind a nearby sycamore. 

“I-I just wanted to be sure.”

“Why do they always melt into that black puddle when we kill them?” I wondered aloud.

“You mean to tell me they always do that?” Joey queried. 

“Yep. Every. Single. Time.”

“I was actually thinking about that. My guess is, because they were created by your words, when you kill them, they return to their most primal form. Ink.” 

“Jake, you're a genius. That has to be it. I never would’ve thought of that.”

“I know. What would you do without me?” he remarked as a smug grin inched across his face.

Joey tentatively approached us. 

“Um, thanks for getting me out of this. I think I'm gonna go take a nap. This really wore me out,” he said, shaking each one of our hands. 

“And good luck on your next ‘adventure.’” 

“Thanks,” I said, “we’ll need it. We have a succubus to seduce.”
