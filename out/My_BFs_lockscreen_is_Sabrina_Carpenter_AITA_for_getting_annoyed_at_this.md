Hi Girlies:
 Hi girlies! I don’t normally post things like this to Reddit because he isn’t a fan of me bringing other people’s opinions into our relationship, but my feelings are a little hurt and my coworkers are tired of me talking about him. Me (19f) and my partner (24m) have been together for about three years. He is the love of my life and I can really see myself spending the rest of my life with him, but earlier this month we had a small argument that’s been playing over in my head.

Essentially, I walked to his place after work on Friday to spend the weekend with him (he’s trying to save money so isn’t driving me anywhere right now). We were watching Netflix on his couch when he got a text and I saw his lock screen had changed from a photo of us together to an AI-edited version of the Mans Best Friend album cover by Sabrina Carpenter. This made me feel a little upset because the previous photo meant a lot to me and I don’t look anything like Sabrina Carpenter; I’m a bit bigger and have reddish-brown hair.

I asked him why he changed it and the conversation devolved into an argument which culminated in me begging to stay and him telling me to fuck off. The rest of the night was rough: I couldn’t Uber back to my parents and I was even chased and scratched up a little by a dog before I made it home. Anyway, he apologised profusely the morning after and told me he had ordered me a Squishmallow as an apology for kicking me out. We made up and talked things out, but he still hasn’t changed the lock screen and I feel like I’m overreacting. What do you all think? I’ll try to respond to your comments but I’m about to clock in to work. Bye!

DMS: 
Hey all! Thanks for all the heartfelt comments and DMs offering support I really appreciate it. First and foremost, I want to make it clear I am not going to break up with him. I feel like my initial post painted a harsh light on my partner, but he’s really the sweetest guy and he’s even hinted at us getting married in the past.

I took your advice and sent him a long paragraph about how I felt about his phone; he’s read it but hasn’t responded yet. When he does, I will post it here for y’all to dissect and analyse.

While I have your attention: he’s been making some comments about my weight. Nothing mean or explicitly hurtful just that I’ve been getting a bit bigger this past month and he offered to get me a gym membership. While I was annoyed, I can’t say what’s causing it because I haven’t really changed my diet and my job (definitely not Amazon) keeps me moving and relatively active. Could this be PCOS or something similar? If anyone has low-calorie meals or knows whether intermittent fasting actually works, that’d be greatly appreciated. Bye!

Hair: 
Once again, thank you so much for the support and advice — you girlies really are the greatest and some of your DMs actually made me tear up a little. I wish I was allowed to have friends like y’all IRL. Hopefully this will be my final update, but I have decided to go and talk to my partner in person about the comments like some of you suggested.

Before I do, I’ve got a kinda embarrassing question: how much should I shave? Me and my partner were at a party last weekend and while I was taking some time in the bathroom due to being overstimulated, I heard him through the walls making jokes to his friends about how much body hair I have. Normally I thought I did a pretty good job of grooming myself, but the jokes made me second-guess myself.

I shave my legs and down there at least once a week, along with my face and anywhere else, but lately I’ve noticed I need to do it more frequently because it grows back way quicker than before. Is this normal, and should I start waxing instead? Thanks girlies, will update soon!

Moon:
 Hey girlies! Not to alarm anyone, but I did get sent home from work early due to a minor medical emergency and now I’m on my way to my partner’s to have the talk. I’ve been thinking about what some of you commented and you’re absolutely right: I really don’t need to change. At first I thought it was tacky when you said I was beautiful just the way I am, but as I looked at myself in the bathroom mirror I truly felt it.

Soft hair now coats my face and arms and I could have spent the entire shift in the stalls just stroking and patting at it while my managers tried their best to avoid me. Eventually, when I began spitting out my own teeth, they asked me to leave. Since then I’ve lost nearly half my fingernails typing out this post and my new digits are hard to type with, so I’ll keep this brief.

My mouth is slick with warm blood and it tastes sweeter than anything I’ve ever known. I’ve already nicked my tongue on where new incisors are growing from the ones that fell out and I feel ravenous. I feel beautiful. I’m nearly at my partner’s house now, but a man called out to me from across the street, not the usual catcall but something derogatory laced with fear; I could smell it on him. Couldn’t he see how beautiful I was? Fangs and fur under the light of a full quartz moon and he insulted me.

I was on him in heartbeats. His blood tasted better than my own; his neck welcomed my teeth before he could utter an insult or scream. I was so caught up in myself I nearly tore his spine out from his now warped back. This brought me back to myself: I couldn’t waste time. I need to see my partner. I need him to see how beautiful I truly am.

I’m outside his house now and I can hear him crying inside. He saw me and hid; the scent of fear and urine seeps through the thin drywall. I can see him filming me now… Maybe I will once again be his lock screen? Bye girlies.
