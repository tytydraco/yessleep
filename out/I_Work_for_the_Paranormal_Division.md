This is Agent Lanster reporting in. I have just gotten back from a work trip and just got done writing up the report. I’ve seen lots of people writing stories about strange happenings in their lives. Granted many of them are people who just accidentally get involved in this stuff. I, on the other hand, am not accidentally getting involved. The opposite really. 

See, my job is with a special group in the government. It’s not the most secretive thing. Hell if you look, you’ll probably find more people talking about it. It’s called the Special Division of Paranormal Investigation. I call it SDPI since that is so much quicker. If you’re smart, you can probably guess what this group deals with. For those who don’t, yes we do in fact deal with supernatural areas. Not just the creatures that want to harm those who live here, but any event that can cause the downfall of our dimension. You don’t know how many times I’ve had to stop weird holes from sucking in apartment buildings or the local butcher shop. 

Now if you wanted to hear stories from the director or anyone high up in the SDPI, well I’m sorry to disappoint. I’m just a field agent. Those big shots don’t even have good stories to tell. They mostly stay in the office doing paperwork and making sure everything is running smooth. The field agents such as myself are the people with the stories. I figured what the hell and just wrote up the last case I got home from. 

I had to go to the lovely state of Kansas. I know, I had an enjoyable time looking at corn and the flattest land I’ve ever seen. Now you would think the states I visit the most are the ones with larger populations like Texas or California. Actually it feels like I visit those little states like Kansas. I mean I guess people in big cities just expect weird shit to happen. I mean you go to New York City and can see large rats the size of dogs! And that’s natural. Let alone the weird supernatural stuff. Plus most creatures want to avoid drawing attention to themselves in case someone decides to stop them. Laying low in small towns makes the most sense for those creatures with a working brain. 

The reason I was there was because of a small farm a few miles away from a small town. The man had reported to the police that something weird was going on out in his fields at night. The police looked into it and reported that the two officers they sent out never came back. They sent two more officers from the state department and they also never came back. So it was sent to us to see what was up. And I was the lucky guy who got sent on the job. 

I pulled up to the little farm house after a nice long drive to get to the state. I looked to see the peeling white paint from the house. The door was a faded brown color, clearly having faded from the rain. Honestly the whole thing looked like it needed a fresh coat of paint and the house would look like it had in its glory days. Surrounding it were fields of corn that stretched as far as I could see. I noticed in the field to the right of the house was a scarecrow. It was standing proudly with its overalls and straw hat. I didn’t pay much attention to it. I walked to the door and gave it a nice knock. 

A little lady opened the door, looking at me. She had light gray, almost white hair. It was up in a bun that had a few strands falling out of it. Her face was covered in wrinkles that showed her age. She was wearing a light blue dress with a brown apron over it. She looked like a stereotypical farmer’s wife honestly. 

“Hello dear?” She asked in a sweet voice. 

“Hello ma’am,” I told her. I held out a badge for her to see. “I’m with the police department and I’m here to talk to you about the events you say are happening in your field. May I have a moment of your time?” 

“Oh of course,” she said. “Please come inside. My husband is eating lunch and we can definitely tell you what’s going on. It’s been so scary.” 

I followed the old lady into her house, thanking her for allowing me in. The inside of the house smelled like freshly baked bread and old books. I didn’t pay attention to much of the decoration, but I noticed the wallpaper and some of the couch seemed to have a floral pattern. We walked into the kitchen where an older man was sitting. His faded overalls were covered in dust. He had a very thin patch of white hair on his head. He had just as many wrinkles as the woman to show his age. He had a half-eaten sandwich in front of him. He looked up when we entered their tiny little kitchen. 

“Debbie, who on Earth is that?” He asked in a gruff voice. 

“This is the newest police officer they sent to look at the field dear,” she told him. He grunted at that, motioning for me to sit down. I did and the lady, who I guess was Debbie, sat down as well. 

“Now, I’ve been told that you two have noticed strange things happening in the field for a month now,” I told them. “Can you tell me exactly what has been happening that’s got you both so worried?” 

“It happened at night,” Debbie started to tell me. “We were both asleep. When I looked at the clock, it was close to eleven. We usually sleep soundly since we are used to loud noises. Trucks, cows, other creatures, the likes. You get used to it in the country and the farm. But this noise… it was different. It sounded like a… Tommy, what did you say it sounded like?” 

“Like a coyote had a baby with a bull moose and it had eaten a motor,” the man told me. “It was loud and didn’t sound human. It was coming from the field. I told Debbie to stay put and I grabbed my shotgun. I looked out the window and… well I’d be damned I saw what was making the noise.”  
“What was it?” 

“It was my damn scarecrow! It was sitting at the edge of the field, hunched over something. It was making that weird noise and sounded like it was chewing something. I was in shock and just watched the thing. It ate the full thing and stood up, walking back to its post. It climbed up the thing and settled back down. I swore I was going crazy when I laid back down. But I know I wasn’t.” 

“And how do you know that?” I asked him. 

“When I went outside the next day,” he explained. “Right where I saw the scarecrow crouching down, there was a skeleton. It had been picked clean. It was a cow from the nearby farm. We don’t have cows. I’m too old to raise them and I ain’t about to pay someone to do it if I don’t got to. So I knew that what I saw was real. So I took the scarecrow down and threw it in the fire pit. Light the sucker on fire.” 

“But it’s still in the field,” I pointed out. 

“The fucker didn’t burn! I left it overnight to burn and all I got was a wakeup call from the same cry and another dead cow on my property. I’ve tried over and over to destroy that thing. It won’t go down. I shot it, still got up. I burned it, never burned. I buried it, still nothing. I don’t know what to do about that thing.” 

“Maybe a priest will be better than the cops,” Debbie spoke up. 

“Why’s that?” I asked her. 

“Well the cows aren’t enough for it anymore. It’s been eating people,” she whispered. “Those cops, our farmhand, hell I think it took the mailman!” 

“I see. Well I have the information I need from you two. If I were you two, I’d go to a friends or families tonight. I’m going to stay. If everything goes well, you won’t have a scarecrow problem anymore.” 

“But won’t the thing eat you like the others?” the lady asked. 

“No, I have a bit more experience. I promise that I won’t be hurt.” 

I waved the couple off after I finally got them to agree to leave. I walked over to the scarecrow, looking up at it. I didn’t pay it much attention when I first came in, but now I can see why the thing wasn’t normal. The head was not made of an old sack like most are. It had a different texture to it. It almost looked like leather. The eyes were black orbs that didn’t seem to be fake. Almost like a deer’s eyes were sewn into the leather. It had a thin line where the mouth would be. It didn’t have a nose. The straw hat had blood on a few spots. It was dried and was only noticeable when you were up on it. Same with its clothes. 

I smiled a bit at that, walking back to my car. Now you must be thinking, why don’t you have a partner? You mean to tell me a fancy government agency doesn’t have the money to send two agents on a job? Well no. I do have a partner. It’s just she’s not… well normal. 

“Hazel,” I called out, looking at my car. I waited for her to appear. And oh boy she did. 

Out of my car appeared a woman. Her pale blue skin had a light shine to it. She looked at me with her glowing blue eyes. The marks on her face were also glowing a bright blue. She was wearing a red evening dress that did in fact contrast her blue skin. Her long blue hair fell down her back in waves. She gave me a look that told me she was already tired of this. 

“What do you need Lanster?” she asked. 

“I want you to keep an eye on that thing in the field,” I told her, opening my trunk. 

“Why, think it’s gonna come and attack you?” 

“Yes, I actually do. I think that thing is a Timber.”  
“A Timber? Haven’t seen one of those in years. It does look like one. Like cows?” 

“Yes it does. Now it’s eating people. And I think it stole a deer’s eyes. So it can see.” 

“Well shit, that’s a fun one. Got the net and gun?”  
“Yes Hazel. I always bring the net and gun for Timbers.” 

“Good boy.” 

A Timber is a nickname we have given creatures that came from dimension 4. They are creatures that make their homes out of things that have human-like bodies. You can find them most commonly in scarecrows, but wooden dolls, mannequins, or puppets can also work. We first found them in a wooden doll, why it’s called a Timber. They were named that long before I started working. In fact lots of these creatures have stupid names because they were named back in a time when things just… were stupid honestly. 

You also have to be wondering what Hazel is. She’s a ghost. She used to be an agent for SDPI like I am. However during a case she was abused by a cult and sacrificed. Her spirit hasn’t been able to move on because of it. She decided to haunt my car. So now she’s my partner, still working for us. She can’t really do much, but her insight and her eyes are always useful. And it’s fun to talk to her on long car rides. 

I opened the trunk of the car, looking at the various weapons and equipment inside. I always keep the basics inside, like various guns with loads of different bullet types. Some creatures can be taken down by a normal gun or a normal gun with gold, silver, or lead bullets. I also had nets with different materials used to make them. Also different knives, a sword, and even a pan flute in there. The pan flute is actually a useful thing to have for creatures that like music. For this mission though I only needed a net and a gun. 

Timbers are easy creatures if you know what you are doing. The things don’t react to normal bullets. They are similar to werewolves: a silver bullet can kill it. Silver is a weakness to a shit ton of things. More than I can count off the top of my head. But I was going to see if I could contain this thing. I’m not in the business of killing things if I can avoid it. It’s actually part of the job. We try to capture and contain what we can and send it back home. I mean these creatures aren’t really bad. Sure some are, but not all of them. Timbers are just trying to eat. We can’t have them eating people if we can. I can capture the sucker and send him home. Then he can go back to living his life. 

I pulled the silver net out of the car, making sure it was the right size. I then loaded the pistol in the trunk with the silver bullets. I made sure to place my pistol in my holster on my belt. I looked over at the Timber which hadn’t moved since I last saw it. The thing wasn’t going to move until it was ready to eat again. That gives me plenty of time to get it off its post and into my net. It can then enjoy a nice ride in my trunk. 

I quietly walked towards it, making sure my eyes stayed glued to it. If it moved, I had to be quick with drawing my gun. I was walking towards it in what should have been its blind side. If it felt threatened, it would attack. That’s just how any animal works, supernatural or not. I had to be sure not to make a noise. If I do, it was going to look over. I imagine with how many times the farmer had tried to kill it, it was tired of the attempts. One more and I imagine the farmer would be the next victim. 

I was a few feet away from the Timber when there was rustling coming from right behind me. The damn wind picked up and made the corn leaves hit each other. I saw as the Timber’s head quickly turned to look at me. It saw me with the net in hand. I was in trouble. 

The thing gave off that deafening cry. The farmer wasn’t wrong when he said it sounded like a bull mouse and a coyote had a baby and that baby had a motor in it. It was animal sounding but also machine sounding at the same time. I watched as it pulled itself off the post, the thin line that seemed to be sewn in ripping open. I could see its sharp teeth glistening with blood in the sunlight. Its head snapped in my direction once again and it ran straight towards me. 

I dove out of the way into the corn as it charged at me. I knew with its speed I didn’t have time to draw my gun right away. Timbers can move quickly, as fast as a damn cheetah! Once I was in the corn I drew the gun, listening to the rustling around me. The thing couldn’t see me, but I sure couldn’t see it. That was an issue for me. If it found me, I may not be able to get out to save myself. But it could smell me. So I had to just listen. 

I heard a quick movement to my left and I looked. I couldn’t see anything, but I sure wasn’t going to say it wasn’t there. I could see the wheat moving like something big was moving it. I didn’t take my eyes off the spot, but I did listen for anything else making noise. After all, any creature can move corn. So I had to make sure that was the one I was looking for. 

Suddenly the Timber charged out of the corn, making that large growl at me. It grabbed my leg before I could react, trying to pull me up in the air. I yelled out as it managed to do just that, dangling me above its head. I felt the heat from its breath as it went to stick my head into its mouth. But I knew how to not get eaten. I aimed the pistol directly at the thing's forehead, pulling the trigger. The loud bang was echoed by the cry of the creature. It fell to the ground, still holding my ankle in its grasp. I gave another shot into its chest where a human heart would be and shot the thing right in the eye. I watched it twitch with each shot until the last one when it finally went limp. It takes three shots to fully kill those things. I knew it was dead. 

“Good job Lanster!” I heard Hazel cheer from the car. I sat up, breathing heavily from the event, shooting her a glare. 

“Thanks for the help,” I called back. 

“Hey, I knew you had it! The day Mark Lanster dies is the day we all die! You weren’t about to die to some stupid Timber.” 

“Yeah, yeah, yeah.” 

I stood up, dragging the thing over to the fire pit the farmer had. I tossed the dead creature on top, pouring some of the gas next to the pit and lit it with my lighter. I watched it go up in flames. You can’t burn a Timber alive, but you sure as hell can once they are dead. The once scarecrow went up in smoke. 

I called the farmer and his wife once I was on the road. I told them they had nothing to worry about. I took care of it. I could hear the relief in their voices. Their nightmare was now over. No more people would die on their farm and they were safe. I filed a report with the office, letting them know that I wasn’t able to capture it alive. We try, but things happen and we do have to put the creatures down. The fourth dimension doesn’t have any life that can make a treaty with us, so in this case we are able to safely file this one away. 

That’s just one of the many cases I go on. That’s my job. See if I can capture things that want to hurt our reality. If I can’t, kill the sucker before more damage is done. It’s not the easiest job, but it saves people. So I’ll keep at it. 

This is Agent Lanster, signing off.
