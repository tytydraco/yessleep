I never thought I’d be one of those people posting here, but I guess we all end up somewhere unexpected. I’m writing this because I’m scared, and I think you should be too.

It all started innocuously enough. The government announced a new health system to combat the virus—a virus that, let’s be honest, half of us weren’t even sure existed. They called it a necessary step to keep everyone safe. They called it good news.

People were actually happy. They were relieved. They didn’t see the bars closing in around them. “How wonderful, we can do things again,” they said. The conditioning was fast and terrifyingly effective. In less than eighteen months, we went from laughing at the idea of six feet apart and masks to accepting them as normal. Shaking hands became an act of rebellion.

Now? Now we’re dancing to their tune, oblivious to the reality of our imprisonment. We undergo tests to get into places, thinking it’s just a minor inconvenience. The temporary permanent health passport law—yes, that’s what they called it, temporary permanent—slipped through both houses without much fuss and is now in effect. They extended it for three more months, and nobody even noticed.

Businesses are dangling on the government’s string, offered a mirage of more revenue, a chance to pay off massive tax debts. It’s optional, they say, but we know better. Get tested without symptoms, become a good citizen, and you can go places the untested can’t. They’ve promised privileges to those willing to get vaccinated with an experimental concoction. The hesitant? They get nothing.

This new social credit system is just starting, but it’s growing fast. Good citizens get discounts, travel rights, jobs, all the perks. The bad ones? We’re left behind, but they say we can always change our minds, get vaccinated, and join the good side. It’s not mandatory, but if you don’t, you’re stuck with the restrictions.

The other day, I watched a mother with her child being turned away from a store because she hadn’t gotten the latest test. The look on her face was a mix of shame and anger, her child crying because he didn’t understand why they couldn’t go in. That image haunts me. How did we let it come to this?

My neighbor, Mr. Thompson, a man in his sixties, used to be so lively, always greeting everyone with a firm handshake and a joke. Now, he stays indoors, afraid to face the world that no longer accepts him. He refused the vaccine, citing personal health reasons, and now he’s labeled a bad citizen. His world has shrunk to the confines of his small apartment, his spirit slowly withering away.

The final straw for me was last week. I work in an office, or at least I did. The company announced that only vaccinated employees could continue to work on-site. Remote work wasn’t an option for my role. I had been hesitant about the vaccine, not because I was against it, but because I wanted to see more data, more evidence of its long-term safety. That caution cost me my job. I’m now part of the growing number of unemployed, struggling to make ends meet, punished for my reluctance.

The scariest part is how quickly people turned on each other. Friends and family members, divided by their status as good or bad citizens. Social media is a warzone of accusations and moral grandstanding. The government didn’t need to enforce the segregation; we did it ourselves. The fear and conditioning had done their job.

I know what you’re thinking. Why don’t I just comply? Get the vaccine, take the tests, and reclaim my life? It’s tempting, believe me. But something inside me resists. It’s not just about the health measures anymore; it’s about what they represent. The loss of personal freedom, the erosion of choice, the quiet acceptance of a digital prison.

So here I am, writing this post, hoping to reach someone who feels the same. Are we going to wake up and reject this nightmare? Or will we keep smiling and thanking our captors, dancing deeper into a dystopia we helped create?

The choice is ours, but the window is closing. We need to decide soon, before there’s nothing left to fight for.
