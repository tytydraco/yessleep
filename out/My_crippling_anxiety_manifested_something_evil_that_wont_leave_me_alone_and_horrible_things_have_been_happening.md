Every day I lived life under an umbrella of fear. Each breath was filled with paranoia, and nothing I did ever fixed it.

I used to have hope. I used to think that \**someday\*,* all would be well. But no. It only got worse, and then it twisted into something else entirely. Something… terrifying.

On any other anxiety-encompassing day, I heard an odd noise. Usually, odd noises were a thing of regularity. I heard them often—a whisper from empty air or someone calling my name despite being alone. But this noise was different; it was a little \**snap\** right next to my ear as if someone was trying to get my attention with their fingers.

As you might expect, I turned my head, but nothing was there. And that was it for the rest of the day—one snap and then silence.

Naturally, I spent the whole time riddled with anxiety—second-guessing every decision and trembling like a thin tree in a hurricane.

The next day, I stared at myself in the mirror, cursing my existence. Suddenly, I saw a dark object in the mirror's reflection disappearing behind my shower curtain. Once again, it wasn't uncommon for me to imagine things in the throes of horrible mental dilapidation, but I still always entertained the oddities in case they were real, and I was in danger.

Well, I pulled the curtain back to see an empty tub. Go figure. But while I was poking my head into the shower, I heard the snap. This time, it was behind me, and when I spun around, I saw a hulking black mass in the mirror's reflection.

I faced the shower again to see nothing. And when I looked into the mirror, it was just my wretched face staring back at me.

Seeing things was a sure sign of sleep deprivation, but it wasn't the first time I had seen something unexplainable. However, a welcomed wave of sleep suddenly came over me, and I stumbled out of the bathroom towards my room.

My balance was off, and my feet struggled to keep flat against the wooden floor. It had been a long time since I'd felt this type of exhaustion. I enjoyed it immensely.

But as I lifted my heavy head, I beheld a pale figure standing at my bedroom doorway. It was facing into the room, and I sensed terrible dread flowing off it. I stopped in my tracks only for it to walk through the doorway, out of sight.

I tried to sneak up to my room, but the floorboards were old, and every time my weight came down, they creaked. Despite having seen eerie things before, they had never felt this real or this evil.

Peering around the corner of the doorframe, I saw the figure standing in front of my bedroom window. It was staring out into the night, but what it was looking at was a mystery because I lived in a rural area.

It wasn't moving, or rather, it was difficult to distinguish it from a person or a mannequin. But a deeply-rooted instinct within me protested fiercely against approaching it, and for once in my life, I listened. I remained in the doorway, gazing fearfully at the strange figure.

I watched it for quite some time before I realized I had forgotten to blink. As my eyes did their natural action, I opened them to see the figure had moved closer.

Whatever it was hadn't turned around, nor did it make any noise, though it was as if it simply walked backward toward me. However, the speed at which it moved was concerning because it was much closer after blinking a second time.

It was within arms reach, yet I dared not touch it. I watched intently for any sign of breathing, but there was none. My legs began to tremble as I sensed the oncoming blink. What would happen if it reached me? Would it take its elongated, knife-like fingers and rake them across my face? Would it put me out of my misery? At least then, I wouldn't have to deal with it any longer.

Still, something in me fought the urge to blink. I clung to life against my best wishes and kept my eyes open. Suddenly, I heard a resounding \**snap\** behind me, and I instinctively turned to see my darkened hallway.

\**Shit!\** I said to myself as I cranked my head around to look into my bedroom.

The figure was gone. And the last thing I remembered was the floor rushing at me as I collapsed from fatigue.

That next day, I woke with my face burning. I had landed on a loose floorboard that I had been putting off fixing. Unfortunately, I must have come down right on it because a painful puncture wound was in my cheek.

I crawled to my feet and gently touched my face. It was swollen and sore, and a trail of dried blood streamed down my neck. Luckily, I never had visitors, and I didn't seek them out, so no one would see me.

I hated my face anyway.

Mistakenly, I fell backward on the bed and hit my head on my laptop. "Ow, fuck!" I said aloud.

Suddenly, from down the hall, I heard a snap. "Is someone there?!" I called out. The snapping continued, like someone trying to carry a tune.

I almost lost consciousness when I stood up. One of my biggest problems was neglecting my health. I rarely ate. You could say I felt weak, but that would be an understatement.

The snapping went on and on to the point of madness. Each snap caused me to flinch, and the longer it rang down my hall, the more I wanted to claw my face off. I had an excruciating sunburn once described as "Hell's Itch" by doctors; it felt like a demon was embedding its sharp claws in my back. But even that didn't compare to the snapping's effect on me.

Reluctantly, I walked toward my bathroom—the source of the snapping. As I rounded the corner of the bathroom door frame, it stopped. "What is going on?" I asked aloud as I stared down at the dirty-white tile floor.

Then a knock came on my front door. It wasn't a gentle knock but one of urgency. 

However, as I said, I never had visitors.

I meandered through my house to the front door, swearing I had caught glimpses of things in the corners of my eyes. I felt like something that wished to harm me was watching.

But my mind kept reassuring me, stating it was all a hallucination—a product of my anxiety.

I pressed my punctured cheek against the door as I stared through the peephole, wincing. Standing on the other side of the door was a woman. I didn't recognize her, but she seemed… genuine.

I opened the door without thinking, and she brushed her way inside, completely silent. "Excuse me, can I help you? People don't normally go walking into strangers' houses," I said, leaving the door wide open.

The woman, wearing a plaid petticoat, sniffed the air before facing me. "It reeks of desperation in here," she said, piercing me with her deeply disconcerting eyes.

"Are you lost?" I asked, narrowing my gaze.

"I think I'm exactly where I need to be," she said with a debutante flair.

"I don't know who you are, and I want you to leave my home right this second," I said, gesturing toward my door.

"You'll never be rid of me, so there's no point in my leaving." Her wrinkled face began to relax frighteningly; it was falling away from her skull.

"Wh-what's wrong with your face? Leave, now!" I said, trying to usher her out of my home.

Then the pale figure from the night before appeared behind her and gripped the underside of her chin. She smiled as it pulled the flesh of her face over her head.

I screamed like a child and ran out the door.

Halfway down the road, I began questioning what I was doing. Why was I running away from something that was not even real? "You're a moron!" I said to myself as I turned around and headed back home.

I walked through my wide-open front door and softly closed it behind me. As expected, the woman and the figure were gone. More paranoia-driven hallucinations that I used to be desperate to escape from, but since having gone through years of trial and error, I decided to let any strange happenings go.

But then, I wondered: if it \**wasn't\** real, why was there a petticoat on the shoe matt next to the door?

I threw it outside and went to the bathroom. My mirror had a web of cracks—something I couldn't remember happening. Staring at myself was always a struggle because I hated my appearance. I mentioned that before. But as I looked at myself then, I couldn't recognize who I was.

Why were my eyes so dark and heavy? I knew I didn't sleep well the night before, but I looked like death.

\**Snap\*.*

After the last "hallucination," I felt it was unbecoming of me to inquire into anything else that might arise around me. However, it was difficult to ignore the beastly man draped over my shoulders in the mirror. I couldn't feel his weight, but he was there, staring at me with dead eyes.

When I reached to touch his arm, I only felt my shoulder. Was the mirror somehow a window to another world? It had to be, right? 

The man pulled the loose skin on my face. It was like the woman with the pale figure, yet he wasn't even there. It was like watching a horror movie starring me.

\**Snap\*.*

He disappeared. Was the snap a trigger of some kind?

My anxiety was peaking, reaching the point of involuntary retching. I needed medicine. I always kept it in my bedroom, inside a little end table. But when I checked the drawer, it was gone.

I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself. Sometimes things get misplaced, but that's no reason to hit the ceiling. However, because I was already positively buzzing from all the angry butterflies in my stomach, I panicked.

Tossing the room, I couldn't find the pills anywhere. I checked throughout the house to no avail. Every so often, my search would be halted by a faint \**snap\**, and I'd turn my head to see nothing but open air.

"Fuck! Where are they?!" I asked aloud, eyes nearly bulging out of my head.

\**Ding-dong\**…

\**The doorbell? Wait… I don't have a doorbell.\** I thought, swallowing a dry lump in my throat.

\**Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong!\** The phantom doorbell rang over and over; someone was impatient. But who?

Why was I even wondering such things? I didn't have a fucking doorbell. "It's not real! These are all just figments of my imagination!" I shouted into the hallway.

"Are they now?" asked a malignant voice from behind me. Then, an emaciated hand fell on my shoulder, gripping it tightly. "What makes you think any of this \**isn't\** real?"

I slowly turned my head to see a decaying grin. Then it vanished, and the piercing doorbell stopped with it. "I'm losing my fucking mind!" I said aloud. "Where are those fucking pills?!"

Back on the hunt. I scoured my entire house from floor to ceiling. All I could find was dust, some coins, and a briefcase I couldn’t remember owning. This must have been what people called the "downward spiral," as I was clearly tumbling into insanity.

And with night returning, worry set in. Who was the pale figure, and what did it want? Would it revisit me? I had gone through withdrawals before, but what I was experiencing then felt like a new level. It was as if my deranged mind was inviting evil into my home.

I sat by the window in my worn armchair, staring out at a swiftly darkening sky. But I wasn't alone. I'm not sure how I knew, I just did. Something was in the room with me, siphoning my energy like an emotional leech. However, I was too afraid to look around. You know that feeling you get as a child when there's an expansive room behind you, and you imagine something sneaking up to snatch your soul?

I felt that only it was as real as someone prying my eyes open to see the danger as it approached.

\**Snap\*.*

"I'm not listening…" I said, covering my ears.

The room dropped dramatically in temperature, and a shadow crept in around me. The doorbell, or rather, the one I didn't have, started ringing again. I mustered my courage and stood up, rushing to the front door. Perhaps I'd somehow catch someone playing a prank on me?

Despite feeling like I was under the thumb of something sinister, my room was empty. But, while on my way to the front door, I saw glimpses of shadows lurking in my peripheral vision. The doorbell continued to ring—each little \**ding-dong\** felt like a nail being driven into my skull.

I flung the door open, but no one stood before me. A loud, droning hum erupted behind me, one that drowned my thoughts. Suddenly, something grabbed my ankle tight like a vice.

At my feet was a torso. It wasn't someone I recognized, but its empty sockets were staring right up at me. The corpse opened its toothless mouth and groaned. Then its grip tightened further; it felt like my leg was going to break.

With my free foot, I stomped on its head until it was a mushy mass under my bare feet. Then Knocking began all around me—the house started to shake. "What is happening?!" I shouted, squeezing the sides of my head.

I ran to the bathroom. For some reason, I felt it was the last bastion of defense. The door slammed on my finger as I closed it, causing tremendous amounts of pain. And when I stared in the mirror, my face looked like a mottled plague victim. Holes were laden throughout, and my skin was rotting away.

Was I dying? How could someone lose their mind this badly? I had only been without medication for a \**day\*,* and none of it was to keep a stable mental state. So why was I hallucinating?

\**Was\** I hallucinating?

My heart skipped as I saw an outline protruding from my shower curtain. "I-is someone in there?..." I asked, pressing my lower back against the sink.

The curtain wavered, and the house calmed into a settling silence. For the first time in many years, my head was devoid of thought. Curiosity replaced fear as I drew the curtain back.

There was nothing behind it. And at that moment, I thought all the terror I had been experiencing was just my shattered imagination. I sighed, turned to leave, gripped the tarnished-brass doorknob, and wrenched it.

It was locked, despite not being able to be. Faint cackling came from behind me, near the shower. The curtain was closed again, and the outline returned. I tried turning the knob harder, but no luck; it was tighter than a bolt sealed by thirty years of rust.

Nails scraping against polyester arose in the bathroom. I rammed my shoulder into the door, but it wouldn't budge. I tried again and again. However, I'd sooner break a bone than the door.

The metal shower rings holding the curtain rattled, and I reluctantly craned my neck to face it. The tube light in the ceiling buzzed incessantly, flickering frequently. My heart thumped intensely as if each beat was someone punching me straight in the chest.

At that moment, the moment a decomposing hand emerged from behind the curtain, I realized I wasn't simply hallucinating. When the disheveled corpse shambled out of my shower and crept toward me, bits of flesh fell to the tile with a faint \**plop\**, and my skin crawled.

I reached behind to grip the knob again, but it was no use. I was trapped, alone, and afraid. The waterlogged entity groaned as hollow breaths filled its lungs; its body was held together by only a few thin ligaments.

The snaps returned---a chorus of disembodied fingers clicking until I was forced to cradle my head in my hands. There was a terrible heaviness in the air as the corpse continued to approach; it was quickly within arms reach, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.

Suddenly, my door fell off its hinges, and I tripped backward onto the floor. Staring down at me was the pale figure; its sunken, empty eyes bore horrific malice.

I crawled as fast as my four limbs would let me straight to my bedroom. Immediately, I barricaded the door with my dresser and closed the curtains. "Leave me alone!" I shouted as whatever was pursuing me began to hammer against the door.

Then, like a miracle from God, my bottle of pills rolled out from under the dresser. And like a starving animal, I pounced on it, twisted off the cap, and popped three in my mouth. I lay on the floor, listening to the obnoxious pounding and clawing on the other side of my door.

\**When will it end?\** I wondered as my heart thumped off-beat.

*\*This will save me\**. I told myself, breathing like I was having an asthma attack.

An hour went by before I noticed the sounds had dissipated. The low hum of warm air passing through air ducts kicked in and filled my home. I stared up at the ceiling, finally at peace.

After another half an hour, I got up and sat on the edge of my bed. Who would I talk to about this shattered mind of mine? Who could help me prevent this from happening again? The whole thought process wracked my brain so harshly, I started overheating, almost as if it was actually frying.

So, I went to my window and drew the curtains back to open the latch.

But staring in at me was my mother and father. They smiled through the glass before attacking each other. They ate at their faces—teeth and all.

I rushed back to the door, still barricaded by my dresser, only for the head-quaking noises to resume, more cacophonous than ever.

I've tried making phone calls, but the line never connects. I can't go through the window because my parents are still standing out there, their faces torn to shreds. And I'm not strong enough to challenge whatever is desperately trying to get in.

I've been rocking myself in the fetal position in an unlit corner. I can’t sleep. Not for the last two days. The noises never stop. And now the pale figure has appeared in my room. It’s standing near the window, but I know if I get distracted for too long or fall asleep, it'll move closer.

Never doubt the power of the mind. I'm living proof of the ability to manifest evil from imagination alone, and I am suffering for it. My sick mind will be my death unless I receive another miracle, but I've never been so lucky.

My parents just broke the window, and the man moved closer. It's so cold, and I just want it to end.

They're coming for me.

The pills aren't helping.

This is real.

Be careful what you wish for—you might just get it.

Death approaches. Farewell.
