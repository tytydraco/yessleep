I don’t know how any of you would be reading this, unless maybe Bruno finally got the internet hooked up in our ratty old library. But it feels wrong to leave all of this unsaid, and I left too quickly to write a note, so here we are.

Anyway, I know many of you are wondering why I ran away. You were all *really* nice to me when I got back from finding Koschei the Deathless (although to me he’s just Koshie now, but we’ll get to that later). The truth is that you all have no reason to treat me so well. I did some really shitty things on that trip. I am not, by any means, deserving of the 12-foot statue you guys put up in my name. Thanks, by the way.

I wanted to tell you guys what *really* happened, from my point of view. I hope that by doing this you’ll understand why I left–why I couldn’t stay there, basking in your praise, any longer.

Three years ago, my grandmother marched into my room. This event, on its own, was not unusual. We lived in a very small hut on the outskirts of Morava, and whatever privacy the door to my room provided was negated by the fact that Nana *loved* barging into it.

“Anja, get your ass in the living room. Mikhail wants to see you,” she said, scrunching her eyes, as if I’d offended her by forcing the old man across town to visit us. Now *this* event was certainly unusual. Mikhail was one of the village elders–*the* village elder, really. He was older than even my Nana (and she was ancient). The villagers all came to him for their problems. When I told this story to Koshie, he described Mikhail as the village “guidance counselor,” which, according to Google, is an American school teacher that provides advice to students. I suppose it’s not that far off.

I followed her downstairs to where Mikhail was waiting for me. He was very tall, and had to hunch over to fit into our little shack. Nana had a few candles lit, and some light seeped in between cracks on the wooden panels that made up our walls, but it was still dark. Mikhail, with his long beard and wrinkly eyes, looked extra creepy in the dim light.

“Will you excuse us for a moment, Majda?” he asked Nana. Despite being old and withered, Mikhail’s voice was clear and authoritative. Nana nodded at him politely and scurried off–that, I think, was the eeriest part. She was not, and had never been, a demure person. I’d heard many stories of her knocking out men twice her size in bar fights, and recently, too.

I didn’t miss the way he watched her go, almost longingly.

“Join me for a walk.” I noted the way this was phrased–a demand, not a question. Mikhail didn’t stop to hear my answer before opening our front door and stepping through, letting in a blast of winter air. I pulled on the winter coat I shared with Nana and stepped into the only pair of boots I owned before joining him outside, shutting the door behind me.

Mikhail seemed to be… *brighter* outside. He hadn’t bothered to buckle his fur-lined coats, seemingly needing no shelter from the cold. I could have sworn that he was taller, now, than he was before, and that the wrinkles plaguing his skin were slowly fading. Even his hair appeared thicker beneath his cap. 

Now, for those of you reading this that aren’t from Morava, you should know: I have premonitions, and they usually involve people dying. It’s why we lived so far from the center of the village–our neighbors never really liked me. I figured out too late that telling people how they’re going to die isn’t the best way to make friends.

Besides, my visions weren’t always correct. So, after spending years ostracized and bullied for trying to warn my neighbors of their upcoming doom, I’d learned to keep them to myself. So when I’d seen the Aždaja, I prayed that it was a false vision.

For those of you who aren’t familiar, the Aždaja is what Americans would call a dragon–only much bigger, much deadlier, and *much* harder to kill. The stories say that the Aždaja can only be stopped with a blade that has “tasted the blood of the undying.” AKA, has cut Koschei the Deathless. Who, at the time, was known to to be a ruthless, bloodthirsty madman. See why this was a problem?

Mikhail’s voice cut through my thoughts. “Your grandmother tells me you’ve *seen* something recently.” His tone hitched on the word *seen*. My stomach dropped.

“I mean… I haven’t had any premonitions in a while. What are you referring to?” Nana, if you’re reading this, I’m sorry I lied. You raised me better. You have to understand that I was *scared.* If this vision was true, it meant that the entire village was fucked. And if the other villagers found out that I knew already–well, I then I was *royally* fucked.  

He turned away from me, and began to walk. I hurried to keep up, and for a moment, he was quiet. The only sounds were the crunching of our boots into the snow. As we walked, it got darker. I wasn’t sure if we were to expect a storm, or if the trees were simply obscuring our view.

“You and Majda reside far from civilization,” He cast his gaze towards the sky. “Yet even you two must have heard.” I shook my head, which wasn’t technically a lie. I hadn’t *heard* anything, so to speak.

“Heard what?” I hoped my voice sounded innocent enough to convince him I wasn't lying.

I guess it was stupid trying to deceive an old man, with who-knows-how-many kids my age. The crunching of his boots suddenly stopped, and I bumped into him. He was firm–much firmer than a man his age should have been–and I was left sprawling. I barely managed to land on my hands. Unfortunately, the snow wasn’t thick enough to break my fall; it only made the sticks I fell onto feel colder and harder.

Mikhail whipped around. He moved fast, superhumanly so; undeniably too fast for an old man. “Don’t lie to me, girl.” There was venom in his voice.

It was now that it occurred to me to be scared. I was alone with Mikhail, and our neighbors were miles away. He clearly *wanted* something from me, some kind of confession,  and no one would hear me scream if he didn’t get it.

“I saw it. I saw it!” I cried out. My body was beginning to catch onto the fact that there was something wrong. It felt as though my heart was pounding in my ears. I tried to move backwards, but my limbs were shaking too hard to get very far. 

Anger clouded his face, and his eyes seemed more grey than blue–like an iceberg, almost. “For Majda’s sake, I hoped I was wrong. I hoped you didn’t see it–that the reason our village *veštica* was so quiet was because she was blind, not because she was working with it.” He spat the word out at me. Veštica. Witch.

“Mikhail–what? Working with it? I don’t know what you’re talking abo-” before I could finish my sentence, the ground behind him shook. I could swear I heard the wailing of some storm in the distance.

“I’ve tried everything,” he said, inching closer to me, “to get rid of it. It’s killed *everything* we’ve thrown at it–warriors, magic, we even brought in guns from the capitol. We’ve done everything short of finding Koschei, and that very well might be impossible.”

I supposed that was all the confirmation I needed. The Aždaja was here. 

The wailing grew louder, but it was nearly impossible to hear over my heartbeat. Wind whipped at my face, tangling my hair and biting my skin. Before me, Mikhail seemed to stretch. He was now taller than the evergreen trees. I could only watch in silence as his face contorted to something angular and angry. Before my eyes, what looked like icicles began to grow out of him. He bled where they pierced his skin.

I felt like an absolute idiot for not realizing it first. The icicles… the blue eyes…. the way he seemed to come alive in cold weather… Mikhail was a Morozko. I’d managed to piss off Father Frost, and now I was going to die.

“The only thing we haven’t tried,” said Mikhail, his voice rolling across the forest, meshing with the wailing, “is killing the veštica that summoned it.”

“Wait! Wait, Mikhail, I didn’t summon it, I swear!” I don’t think he even heard my pleas. He was no longer human–there was no light in his eyes.

Mikhail’s hands began to glow. I thought, at first, that he was holding storm clouds.

“What about Majda?” I screamed, when he was just close enough to hear me.

The Morozko faltered. The wailing died down ever so slightly, and the glow around his hands dimmed.

I took my chance. Breathing hard, I managed to say, “I’m her last living relative. You can’t take that away from her! Not after she watched her daughter die. You love her!”

Mikhail’s eyes drooped at the sides. “I do love her. It will pain me to see her so upset, but my role is and will always be the guardian of this village.” He raised his hands above his head, and they glowed brighter than before.

“We can both win! Stop!” I cried, my voice desperate. “I’ll find Koschei! I’ll find him, and I’ll bring him here to stop the Aždaja!” Mikhail paused midstep.

“Please. You don’t have to trust me–do it for my grandmother. She can’t lose anyone else. It’ll break her.”

The Morozko’s eyes seemed more human, now, when I spoke of Nana. I quieted my breathing, and tried to steady my hands. “I’ll leave tomorrow, I swear it. And if I don’t find Koschei, I’ll certainly die trying. Either way, you win.” Mikhail shrunk back down to human size. The wailing stopped, but his hands were still slightly aglow.

“Your grandmother and I,” he said, slowly, “We’ve known each other a long time.” There was something distant in his eyes, and I had no doubt he was remembering his history with my grandmother. He stepped towards me and placed his still glowing hands upon my face. They were freezing.

Mikhail yanked me to him. I screamed, but it was stifled by his lips on mine. Before I could fully process what was happening, a chill set in. I’d been cold before, but this was different. This came from the inside, as if my intestines were frozen–I was radiating cold, like an ice cube ready to melt. My chest felt relatively normal, and I held onto that, breathing in deeply and slowly.

The Morozko had just kiss-of-deathed me.

“You have until the solstice,” Mikhail said. “In a month’s time, my curse will reach your heart, and it will freeze. If you find him, and bring him here, I will reverse it.”

And that, dear Moravans, is why I set out to find Koschei. It was no noble deed. I didn’t do it out of the goodness of my heart, I did it because, my grandmother's ex boyfriend (who just happened to be Father Frost) cursed me, and I was scared shitless. I'll try to write some more later, to tell you about the things I had to do to survive on that trip. But, for now, I hope you understand: I am not a hero, Morava.
