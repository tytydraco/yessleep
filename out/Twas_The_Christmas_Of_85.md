Several days ago, I attended a Christmas party when the host asked, *"What was your most memorable Christmas?"*

I thought about it for a moment then said, *"The Christmas of 85."*

I can still remember the Christmas of 85 like it was yesterday...

It was a blisteringly cold night on that fateful Christmas back in 85.

The ground was covered with at least 2 inches of snow due to a blizzard that hit the night before. 

I had just finished a 9-hour shift at my Uncle's restaurant (at the local mall) so, I was exhausted and just wanted to go home. 

My parents were out of town for the Holidays so, I was alone except for their 2 dogs, Sasha and Sadie (both German Shepards).

Anyway, It was around 5:30 pm when I finally arrived home and by this time it was already dark outside. 

I could hear Christmas Carolers off in the distance as I let the dogs out to pee. 

When they were finished I went back inside and made myself a sandwich and a cup of hot chocolate. 

After eating my sandwich, I walked back to the living room with my hot chocolate and switched on the TV to the 6:00 news.

Lately, the talk at work was about the 3 bodies that were discovered last month near the mall, with their throats nearly ripped out.

The coroner ruled the deaths accidental despite visible scratch marks all over the bodies.

Anyway, after I finished watching TV, I locked all the doors and then lay down on the couch. 

As soon as my head hit the pillow, I passed out.

I was asleep for no more than 30 minutes when something jolted me out of my sleep.

Letting my eyes adjust to the dark, I scanned the living room. 

I noticed both Sasha and Sadie growling in the direction of the kitchen.

I stood up and reluctantly walked over to the kitchen all the while trembling like a leaf. 

Upon entering the kitchen, I saw a face at the window.

Although It was too dark to make out any features, I knew it wasn't human because of those glowing yellow eyes. 

I must be tired, I thought to myself because I was starting to see things that weren't real.

That's when it smiled at me, exposing razor-sharp teeth.

*"What do you wa-"* I nervously asked, but before I could finish my sentence the creature broke through the window shattering glass everywhere.

This caused my adrenaline to rise...

I could feel the claws on my hands begin to grow as the rage grew inside of me. 

I screamed in pain as they tore through my flesh. 

I felt my body getting warm and bones crack causing me to let out an agonizing howl.

The creature stood there frozen in place, as I charged at it, ripping off its hand. 

It screamed in pain, as I proceeded to rip off its other arm biting chunks of its skin in the process. 

After a few minutes of this, it collapsed onto the floor where it lie there unmoving in a pool of its own blood.

Later on, the police found me passed out on the floor apparently, the silent alarm had gone off alerting the authorities.

The creature, although badly injured was still alive.

After they restrained the creature, I shouted, *"Monster!"* 

Not like it would understand me, though.

Anyway, the creature was eventually taken away to a research facility just outside of town in order to conduct testing on it.

The authorities later thanked me for being brave.

Anyway, I work at the research facility where the creature has been for 34 years...

Last week it escaped and now, I fear for my life...
