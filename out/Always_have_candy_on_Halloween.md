Halloween is coming up again. You're probably happy about this, getting candy and dressing up, hell you probably like to party. Not me though, I hate Halloween. 

You're probably wondering why I hate Halloween. Let me tell you, 3 years ago, I decided to invite my friend over for Halloween. 

My parents were bringing my little brother trick or treating. I thought me and my friend, Daniel would game while they were out. 

So I called him up and he got here in 5 minutes, "Well, that was quick". "Well, I didn't feel like handing out candy at my place". I laughed and we then got to gaming.

Daniel was always better than me at any game we played. It never really bothered me until he started to brag about it. 

" Beat you again, what is that 10-0?" "Okay, I get it" we then heard a knock at the door. I went to check it out. I opened the door to a kid wearing a skeleton costume.

"Trick or treat!"

The kid held up his bag waiting for me to give him candy. "Sorry, we don't have any candy." He just stood there and stared at me. The more I looked the more I noticed his costume looked more and more realistic.

It looked like he was an actual skeleton. The kid finally turned around and left, I closed the door and went back. I picked up my controller and started gaming again.

10 minutes later, I heard another knock at the door "We have no candy." Thinking they left we went back to gaming. Until we heard knocking again, but we ignored them.

They didn't stop and I was getting pretty pissed "GO AWAY!" The knocking finally stopped. I calmed down and decided to get a drink.

I told Daniel I would be back. So I went to my kitchen to get a glass of water. Until I noticed that the back door was open. "When was this opened?" I said to myself. I closed it, but then heard Daniel scream.

I rushed to him and got terrified when I saw the skeleton kid trying to stab him. I ran over and went to kick him off. But when I did his head came off.

It rolled around for a while, but it finally stopped rolling and said, "Trick or treat!" I was about to scream realizing he was an actual skeleton. His body walked over and picked up the head putting it back on.

"If you don't have a treat, then how about a trick?"

His mouth then stretched out touching the floor. His arms grew long, he then grabbed my friend's legs and started to drag him into his mouth. I grabbed Daniel's hand trying to save him but it didn't matter.

The skeleton was too strong and pulled Daniel into his mouth. Daniel screamed for help before the skeleton's mouth shut. 

He then went back to normal, I didn't know what to say or do. The boy grabbed his knife and put it back in his bag. Before leaving he turned around and said "Happy Halloween!"

Before slamming the door behind him, I just stood there knowing that I couldn't save my friend. Daniel was reported missing, but I never told anyone what happened that night. 

Who would believe me, I still blame myself for what happened to him. Now every Halloween, I always make sure to have candy. And this Halloween is no different.
