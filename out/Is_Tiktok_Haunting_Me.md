I never thought I’d have something to contribute to this subreddit, but here we are. The only reason I’m even posting on here is because Google thinks I’m crazy. Hopefully, someone on here knows what I’m talking about or can at least point me in the right direction. I figured the chances of finding someone who has come across it are probably higher here since I think it comes from reddit. 

 

I’ll start by introducing myself. My name is Emily, and my life is literally as boring as it can be. I’m about to finish my second semester of college, and if I’m not doing homework or working, I’m just at home rotting. The first time I saw it was in algebra. My professor is probably 70 years old. He’s so monotone, I can’t help but tune out. Sitting through one of his lectures feels like watching a foreign film with no naked people. So, I tend to watch TikTok to help pass the time. Mindlessly scroll through the FYP. I glance up every now and then to try and feign interest in what He’s rambling about. That’s when I happened upon a weird video.  

 

On my screen was a masculine figure sitting in a chair, in the middle of a room, facing away from the camera. The room was plain, almost empty aside from a small table and lamp that were sitting off to the side. Because of this the figure was basically just a shadow in the middle of the screen. Something about it felt…wrong. A thought entered my mind, “Am I scared?” Instinctively my eyes shot up to the projector screen and my thumb scrolled. It was just muscle memory. I looked down and scrolled back, but when I did, I was greeted by a BookTok video! I looked for the figure, but I couldn’t find it. I Scrolled and scrolled but it was gone. The sound of my professor’s voice filtered through my ears. He was getting ready to end the class. I didn’t realize so much time had gone by. It felt like only seconds. Super confused, I started to pack up my stuff and thought to myself “I must’ve fallen asleep and started dreaming. Boring ass class.” 

 

The next day I went to work having forgotten the whole thing. The store was slower than normal for this time of year. I work at a pretty popular craft store. We have a lot of floral and wreath stuff on sale, so we were expecting to stay busy. But by 8pm we’ve barely seen a soul. That’s why my manager let me take an extra 10. I walked to the back hoping to have a few moments of solitude when I saw Annie walking down the hall. “There goes my break” I thought to myself. Annie wasn’t really that bad. She’s super nice and friendly but boy can she talk. The second I walked into the break room I was roped into a conversation. She went on about how happy she was. Apparently, she had just gotten back from a campus tour. Her and her super awesome, super great boyfriend are planning on going to UW and getting an apartment together after they graduate. I try and muster up some shame for only half listening, but I was just annoyed. It’s not her fault though. She doesn’t know I’m still bitter that my ex broke up with me because he decided to go out of state for college last year. I put an Air Pod in and hoped she would get the hint. I set a 10-minute timer and started to scroll my FYP.  

 

Honestly, I don’t know how I got to it. All I know is I was staring at the figure again. This scene was different though. My heart filled with dread, but I couldn’t look away. The room was long and dark. A little bit of moonlight came in from the broken window on the right side of the room. It was barely enough to illuminate the inside, but I could still make out some details. Papers were scattered all over the floor. Some of the ceiling tiles had fallen. The ones that remained looked old and dingy. The broken blinds blew slightly in the breeze and cast a shadow on the left side wall. This was the only movement in the room. On the wall facing the screen was a whiteboard. It looked as though there was something written on it, but it was almost impossible to read from so far away.  

 

My brain was about to register what the marks on the board meant when my eyes were drawn to the bottom of the screen. Sitting in the corner, darker than shadow, was the figure. It sat motionless and undefined. Melting into its surroundings as if the shadows and darkness came from within it. Consuming the corners of the room. My eyes stayed glued to it, hoping to catch some hint that it was human. That this was all an elaborate idea to go viral or something. But the figure gave me nothing. It was just a void on my screen. Looking around the room again I realized there was no door. The thought of being trapped in a room with this thing was enough to make me want to vomit. When the blinds rustled again, I swear I could feel that distant breeze hit my face. Like a cold finger running over my cheek.  

 

That’s when I noticed a small sound so quiet I thought I was imagining it. Slow and rhythmic. I was immediately fixed on it. The words to identify it were on the tip of my tongue. “Is that tapping?” Steadily the beat got faster. I could feel the urgency building with each beat. The sound of tapping on glass got more persistent. Almost as if responding to my realization. It grew louder and eager. I could feel it in my hand. I could feel the tapping through the phone.  

 

I had to know what this was. Was it some sort of clickbait? Some dumb marketing campaign for a movie coming out soon? I swiped into the account and was horrified by what I found. The user’s profile was filled with random “oddly satisfying” videos. I opened one and the tapping was instantly replaced by an AI voice over of an “Am I the Asshole” reddit post on a soap cutting video.  

 

“Emily! Seriously? I said you could take a 10-minute break were you planning on sitting here until closing?” I looked up to see my manager standing in the doorway, red faced. “What?” I asked. “I just started my break,” my voice coming out croaky and quiet. “We have a line up front! Get to the register now. Annie is drowning out there alone.” I sat there blankly as she turned and closed the door. I looked down and found the timer was going off. All at once I felt the phone vibrating and heard the blaring sound of the timer going off through my Air Pod. I looked at the time only to find that 23 minutes had gone by, not ten. In a hurry, I stopped the timer and closed my phone. 

 

Looking back, I feel like I should have felt something. Fear, confusion, something. It didn’t feel like I had just lost track of time. I felt like I had lost time. But I was just numb. I got up and went back to work but felt so disconnected from what I was doing. Basically, just going through the motions until I got home.  

 

I got under the covers feeling a strange chill still clinging to my bones and started looking through TikTok again. I had to figure out what this was. If it was even real. I couldn’t find anything or anyone who was talking about it. So, I came here. Hoping maybe one of you knows what this is. Like I mentioned before, I even went as far as to Google it but no luck. I’ve tried to convince myself that I imagined it. Dreamed it maybe? But if I close my eyes…I can still hear the tapping. Someone please tell me you know what I’m talking about. Maybe this it’s one of those creepy internet things like slender man? I just need an answer. I have a lot of homework and studying to do since finals are coming up, but I hope to check back soon.
