The walls are giving in. What do you expect? The foundation is cracked. The internal damage is substantial. There is a person inside screaming for help. A child. Scared. Forgotten. So lonely. Blood drips from the walls.

There is a scary man who sleeps in the attic. Stalking the child. Whispering into his ear. Watching him while he sleeps. The walls are giving in. The man in the attic is scrambling around. The wood creaks all night, waiting for the night to remove the lonely child’s eyes. The child knows the man in the attic all too well. He’s been there for a long time. The paint is peeling off the walls.

The child is trembling. He’s so thirsty. Malnourished. The garbage man stopped coming years ago. The child sleeps in the trash. The plumbing went out. He sleeps in shit. He doesn’t know how to clean up. He remembers the noises behind the door. The noises in the bed next to him. The noises of the other kids playing.

The man in the attic watches him from the hallway. The fear from the broken child is oxygen for the man in the attic to breathe. The man’s absorption is so efficient. Blood leaks from the child’s eyes and his ears. The child can no longer eat. The man in the attic patiently waits for the child to drown in his own blood. Drown in his own garbage and shit. The paint is peeling off the walls.

What will happen first? The child has ripped so much hair out, taken so many bites of his own flesh. Will he eat himself to death? Will he drown in his own shit? Will the man stuck in the attic suck all the oxygen out from the room?

The flashing images appear in the ceiling. The images are leaking down, liquid leaking onto the child. The liquid is toxic. Luckily, the liquid just decays the pile of shit that the child sleeps under, never touching his skin. The man sticks his tongue under the door, scratches with his nails. He is a tall man. The acoustics in the room reverberate, reminding the child, echoing in his ears.

The fumes in the room are melting the child’s brain. His teeth are falling out. His toothbrush is made of vomit. The room is scorching hot. Why is the child shivering? The child hasn’t been outside in years. Every time he looks out the window, the man is there, smiling. The child was cursed with perfect memory, photographic. He is too weak to vomit, so he just breathes it in. The acidity has rotted his lungs.

The paint is peeling off the walls.

The man finally slipped through the crack under the door. Climbed into bed with the child. The child is too scared to move. The man’s breath leaks into the child’s lungs. The man digs his nails into the child’s skull, forcing the child to look at him. He stares into the child’s eyes for hours. He sticks his tongue inside the child’s nose, licking around his brain, making sure to brush every fold with his tongue.

The paint is peeling off the walls.

The man bites into the child’s throat, feeling his trachea collapse. And blood and poison fill the child’s lungs.

The house explodes. Blood, shit, cum, vomit, body parts fly everywhere. The explosion destroys the neighborhood. The rubble clears.

The child is found sitting where the house used to be. The child no longer has skin or tissue. He is just a skeleton. But he is smiling, looking up.

Transparent white hands come down from the sky, grabbing onto the child. The child can finally submit. He goes into the fetal position. The large white hands feel like a blanket. The man watches as the child gets lifted into the sky. The child smiles and waves to the man.

There is no more paint. No more walls.
