Hi everyone, due to my personal reasons I will not be giving away any names so please spare with it and try to understand the incidents which have happened. If any doubt feel free to comment and I will try my best to explain it to you.

Let's Begin.... 

I don't know how to explain it but let's start with a little background about when I started feeling something was wrong with my grandma's house, it is my mother's family's property which they still own. I spent most of my childhood in that house as my mother is a working women. Let me make this clear even though I know the house is haunted I have only experienced it once but my two other cousins have actually seen what is lurking in the house. So the back story of the haunted story is what my mother's grandma got to know from some one who owned the property before my grand father. When the initial construction of the house was going on I can roughly assume it to be initial 1900's and so naturally the safety at the construction sites was not up to the mark. As a result one day while there was some work going on and suddenly the whole wall fell on a worker and he died of impact. We do not know exactly if he was buried right there or just that he died there, but it has happened and the story is backed by many siting throughout the years.

Let me give a you a rough map of the house for your understanding, it was a pretty big house with around 3 rooms, a large living room, a kitchen in the front of the house, then there is a lawn which is separating the back of the house with the main house and the lawn has two bathrooms. At the back of the house there were around 3 more rooms and adjacent to the last room there were two more toilets. Just remember this roughly because the incidents all revolve around the back of the house.

Let me start with one of my oldest cousins who witnessed that spirit let's call it, and it happened when she was really young. Once when she was around 6 or 7 and was spending her time at the house, even though she was a little girl she never feared anything and so she went to use the bathroom which at the back of the house. It was little late at night and everyone was ready to sleep. When she saw that my grandma was in just the other room, she decided to use the bathroom and when she was coming back she suddenly saw some man in the lawn. She described the man tall as in very tall, wearing all white kurta (Long shirt type garment) with an orange turban. I do not know what the figure did or it did nothing, but apparently she started screaming and my concerned grandma came running to see what was wrong. According to my mum, she was unwell for a little while fever from maybe what she saw. Some also rule it out to be nothing but a child's imagination but you guys will later on understand why it was not her imagination.

After that mostly people never saw it for a long time or maybe people from that house became ignorant of the fact that their might be something lurking at the back of the house which is not human.

My mother being the second youngest among her 6 siblings- 2 boys and 4 girls, she was one of the last people to get married in the household. One day when she was back home with my grandma and her grandma, and all of them were sleeping in the living room. After midnight suddenly my mother felt as if someone was literally sitting on her and she was unable to move. As a reflex she opened her eyes and saw some blurry black figure staring back at her and when she wanted to call my grandma her mother who was literally beside her, she was unable to do so. She wanted to scream but could't and it was not a situation you want to be stuck in. After sometime she says she fell asleep and next day thought of it as just a nightmare. But it has stuck to her, as she never once in all her childhood has faced such thing.

There was this tenant who rented the room at the back of the lawn at the extreme corner, she and her family of 3 were the very few people over the years who experienced something unnatural in that place. I heard that she after few years of staying in the room started having unnatural hallucinations and she randomly started shouting at the night. This went on till they left the house and last we heard of them she was pregnant at the time she left the house and she had a son after already having one daughter.

Let me tell an interesting theory here, some people have always said that something was wrong with the room at the backside but my grandma and family never had a strong enough reason to leave the house. Over the years when one of my older aunt as in my uncle's wife got pregnant second time after having a daughter, she unexpectedly had an abortion, it was expected she was going to have a boy. But now she never had any more kids. My other uncle's wife who is the youngest among all the siblings went on and had three daughters, and an stillborn son. They stay in the same room at the back of the house where there were renters previously. Many people when my aunt was pregnant with the boy asked her to leave the room and go to her mother's house for the delivery but she never listened to any of it. She had some complications at the time of the delivery and had to lose the baby. Some theories about the spirit in the back suggests that, he does not like boys to be born in the household. And let me get this straight my grandma and her family moved in the house when my mother was little and my grandma was already pregnant with my youngest uncle. So there goes chances that why now and why not with my uncles.

Now it is my turn to tell what happened with me. My grandma's living room has a big portrait of Goddess in our culture. One day after coming home from school, I was taking a nap on the sofa in the living room and suddenly I have a dream or nightmare I have no idea. The portrait in the room has turned to some other figure I cannot exactly explain. When I woke up from that and ran to my grandma as I was feeling breathless, she said that my face was totally red and I looked very restless. I cannot explain how I feel about the one and only incident I faced in that house. But after that day I know there was actually something in that house.

We in our culture strongly believe that if there is a religious event going on, these dark entities cannot mess that up, to my surprise, at the time of one of such event, we felt that there was something that is stopping us from going further. It has tried its best to hinder throughout event and even went out of its way by cutting of the electricity. Why I am saying that it has something to do with electricity is because whole street in that area all had their electricity expect for my grandma's house.

After some days, I was baby sitting my youngest cousins, daughter's of my youngest uncle. My aunt and uncle had some commitments which they could't back out and my grandma was out at her brother's house. I was in the next room to that room at the back of the house I always mention. I after my incident had never felt it again. So when my little cousin came running to me crying her eyes out that she saw a man on the swing which is just in the lawn and in front of the very room I was sitting. So to say that I was shocked to hear her description of the man, the same wearing all white kurta (Long shirt type garment) with an orange turban and being very tall. Hearing that chills run down my spine. I have never felt so uneasy in my whole life but still to calm her down I said there was no one there but she started crying even more and saying that I am not listening to her. I some how calmed her down and took both her and her elder sister to my grandma's room. Throughout the day I observed that she was not playing nor she spoke anything else. 

To make a connection, I will tell you guys that my oldest cousin is almost 20 years older to my youngest cousin and also there was no chance for my youngest cousin to hear the story my oldest cousin had said because she was not even born at that time we heard the story. It felt unsettling that both had described the exact same man without any slight variations.

Even today when I recall the incident with my youngest cousin, I get goosebumps and my eyes water for some unexplained reason. 

I used to often visit my grandma even after that but never had any such incidents, I don't know if my uncles and grandma experience any such thing still, but when you look at the house from outside it is just like any normal house but only people who have experienced such incidents know that there is something definitely haunting my grandma's house.
