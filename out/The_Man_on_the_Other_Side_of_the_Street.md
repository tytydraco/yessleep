I’ve been delivering fast food for six months now. It’s not the best job in the world, but it allows me to save some money to move out from my unsupportive parents' place, and it’s easy enough. You pick up a bag, drop it off, and repeat until your shift’s over. No real thinking required. Most people don’t even answer the door. They just let you leave the food at the front, send a quick “thank you” text, and you’re on your way.

But about a month ago, I started noticing something weird during my late-night runs. It wasn’t anything big at first. Just a guy standing across the street whenever I’d park. At first, I thought it was just another person out for a walk—there are plenty of those around. But then I realized it was always the same guy, in the same spot, just standing there. Watching.

I’m not talking once or twice. This was happening every shift. Always at different locations, but there he was—across the street, just standing there. Staring.

He never moved. Not toward me, not away. Just stood there. I’d do the delivery, get back in my car, and when I drove off, he’d still be standing in the same place, watching me leave.

I didn’t want to think too much about it. You see all kinds of weird stuff when you work late nights, and you learn pretty quickly that the less you notice, the better. But after a week of this, it got under my skin. I started looking for him at every stop, expecting him to be somewhere in the scene. And he always was.

One night, I was doing a delivery in the suburbs, one of those quiet neighborhoods where the only sound you hear is your own footsteps. It was just past midnight, and I was carrying a bag of burgers and fries to a small house on the corner of Maple and 7th. As I got out of my car, I looked across the street, and sure enough, there he was. Same guy. Same dark clothes. Standing on the sidewalk across from me, staring.

I tried to ignore him, walked up to the house, and dropped the bag at the door like usual. As I turned around, I caught movement from the corner of my eye. He hadn’t moved, but something about him seemed… closer. I blinked, trying to convince myself it was just my imagination.

When I got back in the car, I checked the rearview mirror. He was still standing there, but now his face was clearer under the streetlight. Blood-red crosses were painted on his skin. And those eyes… they were like holes. Hollow, unfocused, but still somehow locked on me, making floods of shame wash over my unconscious.

I drove off quickly, my heart pounding in my chest. I didn’t look back.

My boyfriend and I decided to spend the night together at his, enjoying a rare evening of relaxation. He’s been incredibly supportive, especially since I’ve been working so much and saving up to move out from my parents' place. I’ve been waiting for the right time to find our own space, where we can be ourselves without hiding or sneaking around.

That night, we were talking about my plans, and I mentioned the strange guy who kept appearing. I was hoping sharing it with him would help me process it better. He listened intently and tried to reassure me it was probably just a coincidence or a freak who stayed up in the late hours, like me. I felt a little better after talking to him, but the uneasy feeling never quite went away.

The next night, the same thing happened, but this time it was worse. I was delivering to an apartment complex on the edge of town. I parked by the entrance, grabbed the bag of chicken nuggets, and as soon as I stepped out, I saw him. Not across the street this time, but on the same sidewalk, standing under a flickering streetlamp.

He was closer. Too close.

I hurried through the delivery, not caring about making sure everything was perfect, and rushed back to my car. I locked the doors the second I got inside. I didn’t dare look up until I was driving away. When I did, he was gone.

I should’ve stopped working nights right then and there. But money’s tight, and the late-night shifts pay better. And let’s be real, I need every bit of it. It’s not just about keeping my head above water—it’s about getting out. Getting away from my parents, their small minds, their small house, their small, religious town.

I don’t talk about it much, but I’ve been putting every spare penny aside. Saving for that perfect moment when I can finally move out for good, get a place of my own. A place where I don’t have to hide every part of myself, where I don’t have to sneak around or pretend like I’m someone I’m not. When I discuss the man stalking me with my boyfriend, he thinks that the reason I keep the late-night shifts is just about money. But it’s more than that. It’s my freedom.

Then, a few nights ago, something happened that I can’t explain away.

I was out on my last delivery of the night, in a nice and conservative neighborhood where the streets were mostly empty after dark. It was a giant house with a gate and a long driveway. I parked at the end, grabbed the Indian takeaway, and started walking up to the house. Halfway there, I froze.

He was inside the gate.

Not across the street, not on the sidewalk, but right there, just standing next to a tree at the edge of the property. Watching me.

My legs felt like they were made of lead, but I forced myself to push past him. I made the delivery, dropped the food on the porch, and practically sprinted back to my car. I didn’t even care if the guy was *right there*. I just wanted to get away to safety.

As soon as I got in the car, I locked the doors and stared straight ahead, not daring to look around. My hands were shaking as I put the car in reverse. Then, my phone buzzed.

A text. From my own number.

**“Don’t turn around.”**

I felt the blood drain from my face. I was gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles were white. Another buzz.

**“He’s behind you.”**

I couldn’t help it. I glanced in the rearview mirror.

Nothing.

But when I looked forward again, I nearly screamed. He was standing in front of my car, just outside the gate, his lips forming inaudible words, his hands stretched out toward the sky, fingers splayed, palms up as if offering me to something higher, something far beyond my understanding. His face, painted with those blood-red crosses, twisted in desperation as if he was pleading for himself—or me. His lips moved faster, fervently, but the words wouldn’t reach me. His eyes, those hollow eyes, locked onto mine. The realization struck me hard, making my breath catch. He wasn’t just standing there—he was performing some sort of ritual, a frantic prayer that turned the space between us into both sacred ground and a firepit.

I don’t know how I managed to drive away without crashing. I didn’t look back, didn’t stop until I was home. I ran inside, locked every door and window, and sat in the dark, shaking.

The messages haven’t stopped, even though I’ve switched to day shifts only and no longer see him. Every night, I get a text from my own number. They’re always short and simple, but they all mean the same thing: he’s still watching.

And earlier today, when I parked outside my parents’ house after another long shift, I got one more.

**“Let me in.”**

I don’t know what’s going to be the end of this. I don’t know how to stop who—or what—he is. But I do know one thing.

If you ever see a man standing across the street from you, watching, don’t ignore him.

And whatever you do, don’t let him in.
