I’m writing this down because, honestly, I don’t want to remember it, but I also don’t want to forget. Last fall, I took on what ended up being my last case as a paranormal investigator. It was at Carter House, a place with a dark history and plenty of rumors around it. People in the area said the place wasn’t just haunted—it was dangerous. I thought they were exaggerating. After all, I’d done this for years and heard my fair share of ghost stories.

Carter House was a big, three-story house out in the middle of nowhere, abandoned for decades. Most people wouldn’t have even noticed it driving by, but locals had kept the stories alive. Supposedly, several people had died there, and over the years, it had served as a boarding house, a family home, and even a temporary hospital for a bit. The last people to own it supposedly left after one of their kids went missing in the house. No one ever found the child.

When I arrived, the place looked as creepy as you’d expect. It was covered in vines, with broken windows and walls that seemed to sag. I’d come prepared with my usual gear: a flashlight, an EVP recorder, and some basic sensors. I set up in the front room, where people said they’d heard voices or seen shadows. Nothing happened at first, just the usual creaks and drafts you get in old buildings.

But around midnight, things changed. I heard three knocks coming from the second floor. It was rhythmic, like someone was doing it on purpose. I figured it was probably an animal or just the house settling, but it kept going—three knocks, pause, then three more. That’s when I started to get an uneasy feeling because I remembered reading that three knocks were supposed to be a kind of mocking sign in paranormal circles, almost like a twisted joke.

I took my flashlight and went upstairs to investigate. The knocking was coming from one of the back rooms. As soon as I reached the door, my flashlight started flickering, and then it just went out. The room was pitch black. I tried to turn the flashlight back on, but it was dead. The batteries were brand new, and I had checked everything before I came. I was standing there, in complete darkness, and I felt this heavy, cold feeling, like something was right there with me.

Then, I heard breathing. It was slow and shallow, but it was definitely there, just a few feet away. I called out, “Is someone here?” and then waited. For a few seconds, there was just silence. Then, in the faintest voice, I heard a whisper: “Get out.” The voice was so close, next to my right shoulder. I could almost feel the air move and had the feeling like someone might ever grab me from behind. It literally sent chills down my spine. The moment was like I could've had heart attack if I turned around to look what was slightly touching me from behind.

I anyhow, literally anyhow, tried to stay calm and took out my EVP recorder, hoping I could capture something. But before I could even ask another question, the door behind me slammed shut. I don’t know if it was fear or instinct, but I felt an intense urge to leave immediately. I turned to open the door, and it felt like something grabbed my wrist—cold, tight, and so real that I could feel pressure on my skin.

I broke free and ran down the stairs, but the whole time I could feel this presence following me. It was almost like the house was alive, like it was pushing me out. I got outside, jumped into my car, and drove off. When I finally stopped to catch my breath, I looked down at my wrist and saw dark marks—fingerprints, bruises from something that had grabbed me. I didn’t know what to make of it. I hadn’t tripped, I hadn’t hit anything, and yet here were the marks as clear as day.

In the days that followed, I tried to make sense of what had happened. I listened back to the EVP recording, and while most of it was just static, there was a faint whisper caught on tape: “You shouldn’t be here.” That was it. No other sound, no other sign. Just that faint, unsettling message. It was like whatever was there knew I was intruding and wanted to make sure I didn’t come back.

I never went back for my gear, and I haven’t been on an investigation since. That night at Carter House changed everything for me. Some places, I believe, hold onto things—dark things that don’t let go. And once you’ve experienced it, there’s no going back to the way things were.
