There are times in life when it feels like something is hanging over your shoulder. As though the weight of the earth and the force of living tries its best to grind your spirits into a thick and unmoving paste. Living in general is just tough and can suck the passion out of even the most vibrant and interesting people. It’s something I’ve seen all too often, so I guess I’m thankful that I never had that much passion in living to begin with.

I’ve gone through life as more of a chore than an actual enjoyment, that sounds a lot more depressing than it actually is in my case. I’ve not had a bad life or a particularly exciting one either. I, for lack of a better description, am a completely average man in his mid twenties. Although I don’t intend to go into depth on my own situation and what my life was like before leading up to the shitstorm of a month that I've tried and failed to endure. But I need to put into perspective what things were like before everything started to fall apart.

A month ago I was working as a clinical trial assistant for a small private pharmaceutical company located north of Vancouver. My job mostly involved organising subjects for trials on unique, specialised drugs made for rare illnesses or specific cases that fell outside of what was covered by other large private or public healthcare in Canada.

It was a fine job, paid well and I enjoy working with spreadsheets because I’m a psychopath. Accompanying that with a positive working atmosphere of generally amiable (if slightly distant) colleagues I had a solid working life that while nothing special or desirable was something that left me content. My home life, however, was more befitting of a dull man such as myself.

I was married to the woman who I thought was the love of my life. Grace. We had met in college and hit it off, becoming pretty much inseparable and from there things between us grew stronger. We’d always be hanging out and spending time together. In particular we’d grown close due to the seemingly relentless need to learn and always loved reading books of any kind and talking about them over dinner.

We’d been together for about three years now. But since our marriage it’s felt like we’ve only grown further apart. We still talk and discuss things like we used to but now things are far icier between us. She rarely acknowledges me outside of our dedicated conversation times and I always feel that she’s looking for an out whenever we’re spending time together. Half committal nods and widening of closed smiles that feel a touch too condescending to be convincing.

We live together, but the once thriving life we both shared feels as though it’s become a trap for the both of us. As though we never really out grew being roommates and couldn’t properly commit to being a couple. 

Maybe I need to be more active in our relationship? It was a thought that crossed my mind all too often that now, as I write this, feels so clear and true as the right solution. But at the time it was mixed in with the anxiety ridden mess of soup that was my inner monologue. A voice that excluded and drowned out any modicum of coherent dialogue.

I wanted to make the first move. I wanted to make her happy, lord knows she deserved it. But I wasn’t sure how.

I was mulling over these solutions in my head as I drove along the road back towards our home. Turning them throughout my mind, desperately hoping I could fold the familiar pieces together into somewhat of a recognisable conclusion. All while I slugged through the dreary and monotonous path that wound along the precarious edges of these steep hills. The forest below my car’s eyes shimmering with every shift in the air and swaying together. Waving up to the blinding headlights that pierced through the fog of night.

A dull chill had set in not long after I had left work. Our house was roughly an hour from my work. Grace had been able to buy it due to her own line of work, which was exceedingly more successful than my own, and had taken a liking to the isolated property when we first made the joint decision to purchase the property. Of course the downsides had become immediately present once our relationship had started to worsen with the rotting fatigue. These cold drives along the empty road being the least of my concerns.

Concerns that only served to pull me further from my current scenario as I wandered further into the crevices of future worries. I needed to make things right with Grace, maybe I could take her to dinner someplace nice on Saturday? I don’t have too much work left, I just need to sign off on organising the next animal testing for an Alzheimer's or Parkinson's trial medication. A grim thought that wasn’t exactly something easy to shake this late.

With weariness setting in alongside my less than desirable headspace, it was no surprise that I wouldn’t see something in that inky swill that suffocated my car.

The shape was upon my hood before I could even blink and I felt my body lurch forward with the force of the impact as the car’s wheels skidded, burning rubber into the ground before a second. All before a quieter crash of metal on metal echoed throughout the dark night and I felt my face connect with the steering wheel and a taste of wet iron dripped down my lip.

My ears were ringing from the sudden barrage of noise that had exploded around me from a serene and quiet night. My brain was firing on all cylinders as I lifted my face from the wheel and sucked on the icy air that surrounded the car. It stung against my open wounds, a chilling throb that assisted in bringing my mind back to the present and helped ground myself now that I was wide awake.

Blinking my eyes open I stared over to the shape that now lay motionless against the grey cement. A spray of blood cutting deep across the decimated hood of my car that trailed down to the unmoving form that slowly leaked pools of the crimson liquid across the ground.

*Shit.* My mind raced as I hobbled out of the car door, shoving it ajar and groggily putting one foot in front of the other. *What have I hit?*

A question that was answered with the sight of a pair of twisted antlers that stretched down alongside its lifeless head. Clawing groves into the road, a pair of striking hands slick with the blood of their owner that now hung at my feet.

A moose.

A baby moose.

It was slightly bigger than a large dog and its antlers were still stunted from only recently beginning to come into their own. I watched quietly as the blood trickled through its chestnut brown fur, smearing it with this thick coating of syrupy liquid. It’s deep black eyes staring up at me all the while. Confusion and apprehension glistening across its slick pupils.

A wave of nausea washed upwards from within my stomach as I struggled to hold myself together. I didn’t do well with the sight of dead things, especially with the knowing and nagging fact that I had been the reason that something so young had been killed.

The whole while I had been mumbling under my breath as a constant stream of thought that refused to let itself be contained to the contents of my skull. A spew of ramblings that now were joined by the attempts at working out my adrenaline as I was pacing back and forth before the corpse of my kill.

*What do I do?* Repeated again and again inside my head. I wished Grace was here when I rammed the thing with my car. She’d always been more adept with killing things, in large part due to the frequent hunting trips she would go on that had only gotten more frequent in time. She would have yelled at me to calm down and then carefully prepared a plan to deal with the moose calf’s remains.

For a second in my delirious circling I almost considered trying to stuff the moose into the back of my car and taking it home with me. An idea I thankfully chose to entertain no further than a passing thought.

I eventually elected to shove the moose off to the side of the road, figuring that something would probably come along and deal with the body of the moose on my, or rather nature's, behalf.

Crouching down beside the poor thing’s corpse and tasting the tainted flavour of death that hung on the air around the moose I readied myself to try and drag it from its place in the road.

I had started to let my fingers rest along the spotless side of its body, along its spine where the mess of blood and crushed meat had failed to find footing. Only to recoil in horror as I saw the wounds that lay alongside the marks of my own car.

The moose’s body was wreathed in long twisted gashes that cut deep past the muscle tendons and veins, spilling long blood from its diced organs and shattered bones. The marks all twisted in rows of four gashes, all trailing in the same direction back toward the beast's flanks.

I took another step away from the beast, my hand sliding against the crumpled hood of the car. Blood tainted my fingertips and with every shaking step away from the moose's body I left thin streaks leading up to the door.

*What could do that?* A grim thought that filled my mind with all the imaginings of some grizzly predators lurking on the edges of my periphery. Creating a new found sense of dread which had started to creep along my exposed fingertips, chilling the palms of my hands as they met the cold steel.

Shoving myself back into the carseat my eyes flickered along the edges of the headlights radiance. Scanning for any signs of motion with a new level of alertness and panic twitching through my body as I pulled the car into gear and was tearing off down the road once again. The flaps of metal across the hood creaking slightly as I drove onward, abandoning the accusatory eyes of that poor moose. The striking wounds along its stomach and its body refusing to leave themselves from my mind's eye and persisting the whole drive home.

It didn’t take me too much longer to reach the front door with the remaining actions of my night clicking by as a fragmented slideshow of events that were nothing more than the routine of falling to sleep. I had been unable to rip my thoughts away from the body of that mouse for quite a time. I was still wondering as to what kind of beast was wandering the woods which could have done something like that.

My prime suspect in mind was a bear and I was doing my best not to think past that. I had more important things to worry about, the tests and dinner plan with Grace came to mind. At the moment I was too tired to think. I could wait until tomorrow.

Quietly trudging through the bowels of our home and ascending the stairs I readied to take a right at the top of the incline only ro risk a glance down the other end of the corridor. The doorway was ever so slightly ajar and I could hear the low snoring that she always denied was hers. I wanted to push the door open. I really really wanted to see her but that would have meant to overstep our already strained boundaries.

So I did what I always did. Trode to the other end of the hall and passed through my empty room, my shadow gliding over the empty shelves as I prepared to touch down into the sheets. I did what I could to not leave so much as a trace throughout my already barren room. I was a visitor in my own home and didn’t have the right to leave a mark on this place.

Laying down against the sheets I felt my body dissolve into the folds, flesh melting into fine grains of sand that shifted and changed with every gust of cold air. My mind continued to spiral and shiver with electricity dancing throughout my crown as I cascaded deeper and deeper into the slumbers of sleep. 

I don’t dream very often, so whenever I did I would usually pocket the dreams in the back of my mind. Especially if they were particularly weird or if I thought they would make good conversation starters for a rainy day. This dream wasn’t one I was in a hurry to remember.

I was walking through an ancient forest. Trees spread out as far as they eye could see and grew upwards into the clouds, their leaves and branches threading together in a cloak of nature that shielded me from sunlight. Leaving the idea of it being night or day up to the toss of a coin. The longer I prowled through the darkness, hands scraping against the rough roots of these alien plants as I tried and fought to find my way through the blackness.

Crawling through the woods and making my way past the massive trunks quickly forced me to abandon all sense of direction. Was I moving in circles? Had I moved at all? Everywhere looked the same. The same blue grey trees that stood as lone sentinels in the dark wood, holding the sky up with their roots burrowing deep beneath my feet. This place wasn’t somewhere I was meant to be. It was maddening in its isolation, every turn, every step, every slight movement and I was back to where I began.

Then I heard it. A single disturbance in this unspoiled cavern of the natural world. A deafening, panting howl that reverberated throughout the trees. Cascading as a fall of noise that spread from its source and shattering the silence which I had hated so. Leaving me to wish it had never been broken.

The cry had rooted me to the spot. A primal instinctive response that I was unable to shake. My eyes frantically whirled across the endless forest, prying apart the leaves and branches in a futile attempt to locate the source of the noise.

The woods swirled as the trees pressed closer, my hands catching at every loose bit of foliage as the canopy closed down on where I stood and I was pressed down into the dirt, my chin going down to my chest as I brought my knees up to my throat.

The silence was a cacophony of shrieking, crying and laughing that made it impossible to form any coherent thought. Swallowing a being that didn’t belong there. I tried to stay wakeful, lifting my weary gaze upwards before they shot open wide at the shadow that had stepped forward from the gloom to gaze down on my fading form.

It was a silhouette that twisted and contorted as the edges of its body faded into the trees and blackness behind it. A thick haze that trailed along every wiry hair that stuck to its body, all along it’s legs and arms, leaving nothing but the pearl white hands that were folded at its front. Standing tall and proud as it looked down upon me with a pair of eyes that burned into my skin with a boiling heat. The painful white light was blinding but oddly subdued, leaving me to wonder if their intentions were of malice or mirth?

Continuing to sink ever further, its mouth peeled apart in a sick smile that was too wide, the gums exposed all the way back behind the lip as it laughed heartily to itself in a low rumbling chuckle that shook the very ground I walked upon.

The strength it had taken to keep my eyes fixed on this ancient creature faltered for a last time and I was falling back beneath the ground. Waving in the darkness before I sat upright in bed screaming. The sheets sticking to my slick form as I panted and struggled to remove these saturating binds from my person. Only to immediately stumble and fall forward in the darkness of my room.

The image of whatever had come to me in that place forgotten to time, long since faded from the memories of any living creature had been seared into my eyes. Standing on shaking legs I tried to blink it away, to push it down to someplace it wouldn’t crawl back from.

Only I couldn’t, and in my haste to vanish those bad dreams my delirious state left me to wonder blindly forward where I hit my head on the side of the shelf. My nose catching at an angle and with enough force to render it out of place with a solid ‘crack!’

The pain was enough to bring me back to the ground I stood on. There were no trees. No roots that pulled me down and no… whatever that thing was.

I needed to calm down. Damnit, I’m a grown adult crying about nightmares. Pull yourself together, Mark. Damnit. 

My mind was awash with similar rumblings and condemnations. All aimed at myself and the embarrassment of suffering from a night terror at the age of twenty six.

Legs powered by nothing but shame and the desire to satiate the throb of pain that leaked from my nose. The second time that night I’d fallen victim to my own delirious mind and poor motor function. Thanks brain.

Bringing myself down to the counter I rested a finger along the ridge of my nose, checking its placement as I stood across from the large window that looked down over the driveaway in the empty night.

Flinching at the pain which sparked once more I brought my hand back to examine my fingers and make sure there was no blood. A single motion that caused me to chance upon a shape that lay behind the sheen of glass.

The near imperceptible form of a man that was only noticeable due to the slight shifting of his arm as he drew a hand along the hood of my crumpled car.

I froze the second I saw him. Each part of my body screaming out in the desire to run and hoping against all hope that my eyes were simply choosing to betray reality and I was still seeing things within my haze.

Blinking again, shaking my head before returning my gaze to the spot he had taken. I now knew he was staring directly at me. A toothy, fanged grin lighting across his face that stood apart from the darkness by a single shift in gradient.

Fading back into the single mute colour of night before I could interpret that crooked, worn face that had lingered outside of time. Vanishing as quickly as its visage had appeared to me.

I had been standing in the kitchen for ten minutes before I moved from where I stood. Unable to register that something had chosen to wander an incomprehensible distance into the mountains and untouched woodland to stand exactly outside my home.

*I must have dreamed something like that.* My rational mind clicked into gear, trying it’s hardest to silence the anxious nagging that was still lingering from the morbid dream that had clawed its way into my rest.

I didn’t have time to worry about vague senses of doubt that had been brought on by delirium and work. I needed to focus on things that mattered. Not on hallucinations, worries or monsters.

A final thought that helped guide me back up the stairs towards my bed. A journey that was interrupted by the creaking of a door and the pattering of feet that snapped my attention immediately to Grace’s door.

“I heard a scream.” She mumbled to herself. Watching me carefully as she held half her body from behind the door, observing my face with impunity and a cautious kindness that she was weary of offering.

“Hm? Sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you.” I shook my head with a dismissive turn, not wanting to bother her more than I already had.

“Is everything okay?” She wondered aloud, less so to me then it was to herself. Considering if I was alright in the same way a parent would regard a troubled pet.

She didn’t need to ask these questions. Especially when she already knew the answers to her uninteresting husband and his normal problems.

“Yeah, yeah, just… a bad dream, probably just work stuff.” She had opened her mouth to speak only to clamp it back shut. Her face in the dark hall was a mask of uncertainty and unconvinced suspicion.

Slowly she closed the door, leaving me to the chilly air within our home, nestled in the heart of that wilderness. With nothing but that image of the twisted facade slinking back into the void of nature.
