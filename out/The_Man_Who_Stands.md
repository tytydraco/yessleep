::Let’s take a look at the uh.,. Incident report from Bailey? Yeah?::

:Yeah I’ve been curious how it relates to the protocols:


Incident Report
November 19, 1989

Witness: Officer John H. Bailey

Division: [REDACTED]

[The following is dictated from an audio recorded incident report. I.E. Officer Bailey refused to write. He was alone, per protocol]

Officer John H. Bailey, No-November nineteenth, nineteen eighty-nine. [REDACTED] in [REDACTED] county, Minnesota. Shift started at 2100, picking up patrol from Officer Hank D. Phillips. 

*Sigh* Ok… Ok ok..

Ours is a small town, so it is a lot of the same streets, same corners, same buildings. You find yourself going in circles often, but we have to patrol. There’s been several missing kids cases in the area and State patrol has it narrowed down somewhere else but Chief Hadley thinks the sicko’s here. So he has two, 24-hour patrols until the kids are found, his orders. Officer Lucy S. Apellido was on shift with me, we were in separate shops.

Weather was alright. Snowy but no storms predicted, it was supposed to be a clear night.

Incident report including claims for damages to state property.

Call came in around 2300, just a standard noise complaint. There’s a bridge for the railroad line that goes over Thatcher road on the west side of town, and the kids like to hang there. But Joseph Thatcher… he’s uh… he’s the great great grandson of the man the road was named after, but he lives opposite the overpass so sometimes when the kids have their music up too loud, he calls it in.

Anyway, Joe calls in, same old story. He’s yelling at dispatch that there’s someone at the overpass yada yada yada. Lucy is closest so she volunteers, and heads to check it out. Hours pass by, she doesn’t check back in with dispatch. I try paging her over the CB, I get no response. Roger, our nighttime dispatch guy, he can confirm we didn’t hear from Lucy over the CB at all. At least not until later.

God… oh man…


::The tape scrambled, let me- Is… is he crying?::

:I think he is-:

::Oh- the tape was cut-::


So, uh, I go to the spot. Lucy’s shop was there, abandoned. It looked like it had been rolled over, the way the dents and scratches were. Lucy wasn’t in her car. As I parked, I looked under the bridge.

It’s got a lot of vegetation around it, bushes, trees, vines. Some of the stuff should’ve been dead, it’s winter. There’s a singular lamp post, right next to the bridge, and it lights up the entire thing. The snow had picked up, and it was harder to see, but there was a man under the bridge. 

There was a man under the bridge and all he did was stand there. 

I got out of the vehicle, slowly approaching the man. He wasn’t out of the ordinary. Just your standard businessman. Grey suit, white shirt, stripped tie. But he was just standing there. There was something not quite right about his face, even now I can’t quite describe it to you. It was as if he wasn’t… It’s like he wasn’t solid? Or that look on the tv when the signal isn’t all that clear, the kind of static? 

He just stood there, no matter what I said to him or how close I got. Right up until I was just a couple feet away, and I asked him “Sir? Is everything alright?”

His neck… god his neck… It snapped to look at me faster than any living thing should. Just his head, his chest didn’t move and neither did his arms. He spoke, his mouth wasn’t right either and his voice was almost fried.

He said “I am Ronan, and there is dirt on my hands.”

Sure enough when I looked down to his hands which, before had nothing wrong with them. Before he spoke they were clean, his shirt and jacket going all the way down to his wrist but after? His jacket was gone, his shirt sleeves were rolled up to his elbows and he was covered in dirt. Like a glitch in Adventure or something, he went back to how he looked a moment ago.

I think I tried to talk to him a couple more times before he spoke again and this time he looked at me and pointed.

“You have dirt on your soul.”


::More glitching, I’m starting to think they messed with the tape on purpose::

:Wouldn’t be surprised:


I couldn’t move, the way it contorted was inhumane. Lucy came out of the brush and grabbed me, I didn’t even see her. The noises that thing made, it was like a growl but low, guttural… Lucy drug me back to my cruiser, threw me in the back and we drove. She was covered in dirt. She called Roger in dispatch, told him to call [REDACTED]-

::Oh come on, I have clearance::

:Stan maybe-:

And that [REDACTED] [REDACTED] her head and [REDACTED] bodies in the ground. How she had to climb out on [REDACTED] [REDACTED]. She was crying, and I don’t blame her.


::The Hell?::

:That glitching is getting worse:

::Is he beating on the door?::


LET ME OUT ITS IN HERE! ITS FUCKING IN HERE!!


::What is that sound??::

:Oh god…:

::Oh my god::

*crunch*

…

*crunch*

…

*flicker flicker flicker*

———

“The uh… Tape ended.”

“What the hell Stan?”

“I… I don’t know.”

“Does… Does D team know what they’re getting into?”

“I don’t think Corporal Thomas told them. I’m not sure he knows.”

“shit…”

“Agreed, shit…”

“Someone needs to tell them, they’re going to get killed.”

“I…”

“Stan…”


A low guttural screech came from the other side of the room, followed by claws on concrete.


“Stan?”

“Shit… it can teleport!!”

“Run! Run!”

“NO!! ARGH-“

“STAN!”

Scraping of nails upon concrete, then screaming and crunching, then silence. Both of them… Silent. 

And the man just stood there, in the snow, his hands covered in dirt.
