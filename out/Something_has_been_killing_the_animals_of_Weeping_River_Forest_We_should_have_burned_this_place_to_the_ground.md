*Part 3 - Current*

Gerard looked down at his roughly bandaged wounds, noticing the red strands already festering within his body. By then, the first symptoms of the Crimson Nexus digging its way into his organs had taken effect. He was by no means a stupid man, and he knew based on the infected subjects he’d studied, that there would be no cure for him, but the others weren’t as ready to accept his inevitable demise.

I stood by as they talked among themselves, feeling my heart beginning to race, my hand trembling over the gun in my holster, and my chest tightening. Though I had been able to compose myself despite the fear I felt, my body was beginning to revolt against my own mind. I couldn't fight it.  

“How are we going to get Gerard out of here?” Bill asked. “We can’t exactly carry him.”

“And what about Mark?” Jane chimed in. “We have to go back for him.”

They looked to me for answers, but I couldn't muster the words to respond. My thoughts had moved elsewhere, to tremendous loss I'd experienced years prior. The reminder of sacrifices that had to be made was enough to send my mind into a state of panic. 

"Doctor Livingston?" Jane said. Being directly addressed pulled my mind back from the pits. Though my hand still shook, I could keep me emotions hidden. 

“There’s nothing we can do for Mark,” I said. “He was dead by the time we found him.”

“No, he was alive, he was conscious, he was talking,” Jane argued.

“You know as well as me that the organism was all that kept him alive.”

“You said we could save him. You promised.”

“That was a lie to get you out of the cave,” I replied. “I knew you wouldn’t have left him otherwise.”

“You’re a monster,” she said, tears welling up in her eyes.

I didn’t argue the matter any further. I knew they’d eventually understand if I just remained quiet a let them process the information. They had seen firsthand the effects of the infection. Allowing any infected individual to reach civilization would mean the end of their town, if not the country.

“He’s right,” Gerard said. “You need to leave us behind.”

“How can you say that?” Bill asked. “We don’t know enough about this thing to say whether there’s a cure or not. We have to try to do something.”

“It’s not worth the risk. I don’t know what Livingston’s mysterious company is planning to do, but we need accept the reality of this situation,” Gerard went on. “Leave, please, don’t be stupid enough to die on my account.”

The team gathered around him, preparing to say goodbye. But I stayed to the side, feeling that it wasn’t my place to get involved. After all, I had only been the bearer of bad news up to this point in our relationship. This was their moment.

“Doctor Livingston, what exactly are levelling measures?” Pearson asked, letting the others share their parting words with Gerard.

“They’re going to burn this place to the ground,” I replied. “We only have ninety minutes to get out of here.”

“Well, you better get going then,” Gerard said, having overheard our brief exchange. “You got any bullets left in that gun?”

“A few,” I replied.

“Figured I might as well take the easy way out. I’ll give you some time to get a move on. Wouldn’t want you to be burdened by my death,” he said, his voice shaking under the façade of callousness.

With the little ammunition I had left, I wouldn’t be able to put up a good defense anyway, and with the officers armed back at the checkpoint, leaving Gerard with a gun would be a small kindness. Handing him my weapon, we left him behind, heading away from the Crimson Nexus and towards the dirt road. If we could just reach the van parked at the blockade, we could easily get out of the forest within the hour.

“How come the officers haven’t responded to the gunshots?” Bill asked as we started walking.

“They’ve been ordered not to approach under any circumstances. No one enters the research site without hazmat suits,” Pearson explained.

“Still, you’d think they—” Bill began, interrupted by a rustling sound emerging from nearby bushes.

Before we could decipher the sound, a deer sprung out from hiding, inflicted by the sickness of the organism just like the bears had been. Its skin had been replaced mostly by red filaments, and its antlers had been shattered into sharpened shards. Without hesitation, it rushed towards us, jumping headfirst towards Bill, stabbing his chest with his antlers, easily penetrating his suit.

Jane ran to his aid, sticking the knife deep into the deer’s throat, and pulled on it with enough force to slit it right open. She then severed the cord attached, and within just a few seconds, the animal fell limp to the ground. Bleeding the creature out seemed to have been the most effective technique thus far, as the fibers had already perished alongside the poor animal. Next to it lay Bill motionless, he’d been gutted by one of the antlers, which had subsequently detached from the deer.

“Bill!” Pearson called, but the antler had entered through his abdomen, penetrated the diaphragm, and had pierced his heart. He was dead before he could even process what had gotten him. “No…”

“There’s nothing we can do for him. I’m sorry, but we have to keep moving,” I insisted, not allowing them the privilege of grieving.

We ran the remaining distance to the checkpoint, reaching it within minutes. Once there, we’d expected to be enthusiastically greeted by the officers, but though their vehicles were still parked by the roadblock, the officers themselves were nowhere in sight.

As we neared their vehicles, we noticed some of the fibers already having converged on their location, creeping up the doors, covering parts of the windshields. The van and both patrol cars had been covered in a thin, red layer, rendering them inoperable. The only vehicle that appeared to have been used was the one I arrived in, which had actually been turned around as if attempting an escape. It was still running, puttering as if low on gas. Within, we found the three officers, all taken by the organism, incapacitated before even knowing what they were fighting. The rapid growth could only mean that the organism’s replication rate had accelerated, which meant we might not have enough time to contain it.

“We’re going to have to continue on foot,” I said.

“What about the officers?” Jane asked, noting that they were still breathing.

“They’ve been infected. We can’t help them.”

Increasing our pace to a light jog, which was a tremendous struggle while wearing the hazmat suit, we made slow progress through the forest. We had just shy of sixty minutes before the first bombs would drop and making it out in that time was nowhere near a guarantee. To make matters worse, our progress would only be further impeded as we came upon strange growths stretching as wall across the forest. It was a loose web of fibers that had formed between the trees, with sharp bone fragments and animal remains interspersed within the flesh. One wrong step, and we’d get cut on the bones. Though a tremendous risk, it remained as our only way through.

“How did they build this so fast?” Jane asked.

“They know we’re trying to leave,” I suggested, though I wasn’t entirely convinced myself.

The web stretched as far as we could see in every direction. There was no other way, we had to proceed. Jane, still holding onto my knife, started slashing at the tendrils, watching out as they retracted away, pulling sharp shards with them. It only took a few cuts of the knife before we all realized it would be safer to just traverse through the holes, trying our best not to touch anything. So, step by step, we made our way into the long stretch of twisted webs.

“Any ideas where this monstrosity came from?” Jane asked.

“There was a pit in the caves, too deep to see the bottom, but all the larger cords led down there,” I explained.

“Do you think it evolved down there? That it’s just some prehistoric creature forgotten by time?”

“No, this thing is carnivorous. If it started out in the cave, it never could have found enough sustenance to grow out from its hole.”

“What are you suggesting?” Jane went on.

“I’m saying someone put it down there.”

“Why would anyone put something like that down in a cave?” Pearson asked.

“I couldn’t say. I still need more information from the company.”

“The mysterious company you still haven’t told us anything about?” Jane asked.

“Tell you what—if we make it out of here alive, I’ll tell you everything you need to know.”

Our conversation was interrupted as the webs started twitching all around us, sending propagating shockwaves throughout the entire organism. It caused each of the individual strings to vibrate, swinging their integrated bone shards back and forth with enough force to easily draw blood should it hit us. We ducked down, making ourselves as small as possible as we carefully crawled forward. Again, our progress had been slowed even further, and time was quickly running out.

An eternity seemed to have passed by the time we made it through to the other side, finally meeting a section of the forest not yet completely infested by the Crimson Nexus, but small, red fibers still extended outwards, preparing the next area for conversion. By then, Jane’s pace had slowed to a limp, and her breathing had gotten labored.

“Are you hurt?” I asked.

“No,” she quickly responded. “I’m just running a little low on air. Not sure I can make it much further with this damn suit on.”

“We don’t know if the organism has airborne capabilities. You need to stay inside,” Pearson demanded.

“Well, I need to breathe. What am I supposed to do?”

Pearson hadn’t been moving as much as Jane, and had a larger reserve of oxygen left, similarly, seeing as I’d joined the crew much later, I too would make it without much issue. But Jane had run down to her last few minutes of air, and soon she’d suffocate.

“You should take mine,” Pearson offered.

“Are you insane? I’m not letting you die to save me,” Jane argued as she continued her struggle to just breathe.

“I guess we’ll both have to die, then,” Pearson went on as she lifted up her arm to show a cut she’d sustained while traversing the web. “Looks like they got me.”

She seemed oddly calm about it, accepting her coming demise with grace. She then removed her helmet, taking in the fresh air around her for a final time. “Now take my damn oxygen tank,” she ordered.

Jane solemnly accepted, replacing her almost empty cannister, finally breathing easy again. Of course, just the act of changing the tank posed a risk of infection, but one far smaller than removing the suit entirely.

“I’m sorry,” Jane said.

“Not your fault,” Pearson responded, before turning her attention to me. “Doctor Livingston. A word, please. I know you don’t have much time—but give a dying woman a minute.”

Guiding me to the side, out of Jane’s earshot, she had one final plea for me. “I know the people you work for, and I understand that they’ll do anything to stop the spread of this infestation. While that might sound noble, there will be a fine line they’ll inevitably have to cross to complete the job. And when they do, we’ll be the ones that have to face the consequences. I need you to promise that you’ll make sure innocent people don’t suffer.”

“What makes you think I have a say in how they run things?”

“Maybe you don’t, but I know you’re not afraid to break any rules.”

“How do you know anything at all about me?” I asked.

“We have a mutual friend on the inside,” she said with a slight smirk.

“I don’t have any friends.”

“That’s where you’re wrong.”

She wasn’t about to tell me who she was talking about, and I wasn’t even entirely sure I believed her. But she did seem to know some things about who I was, a fact that almost seemed… comforting. She ended our conversation there, just as the first plane flew over the forest, ready to drop its first load of white phosphorus over the heart of the forest.

“Time to go,” Pearson said.

Jane and I started running through the woods, ducking and diving as more planes dropped their loads around us, praying that we didn’t suffer a direct hit. Trees quickly started catching on fire, falling over in our path, filling the forest with smoke that would have suffocated us if not for our suits. We were so close to the exit, but the company wasn’t about to leave a job half finished. They would only stop once every inch of the region had been torched.

Another tree fell before us, its branches tearing through my suit. For a second, I thought I’d been infected with absolute certainty, but then I noticed the only red filaments the tree had carried were burned to a crisp. The fire, though it was about to end both of our lives, had killed the organism. Now we just needed to make it out ourselves.

But the heat was getting too intense, slowly cooking us inside our suits. Sweat poured down my forehead into my eyes, rendering me almost blind as we sprinted the last few yards to freedom. Then we saw the tree line, just within reach. More loads of white phosphorus fell next to us, the shock knocking us off our feet. Quickly getting back up, I grabbed Jane’s hand and pulled her off the ground. Then we limped the last distance, finally making it to the clearing as the forest burned to ashes behind us. There, we collapsed in exhaustion to the ground. Making sure there were no red filaments that had snuck up behind us, I pulled my helmet up in a desperate need to breathe in some fresh air.

“Did we make it?” Jane gasped between breaths.

“Not quite yet,” I responded as I pulled out my phone to call for evacuation. “But we’re almost there.”

Then I just lay down, shocked that we had made it out alive. Neither of us spoke while we awaited rescue, Jane was too shellshocked by the experience, just trying to process the ordeal we’d been through, and I was too fixated on the few words Mark had told me in the cave. Now that I had a moment to think, I needed to know what they meant. Alas, there were none around to answer my questions.

\*\*\*

Following rescue, we were brought to an undisclosed facility by helicopter and kept in an isolation chamber for forty-eight hours as we recovered. Though frazzled by the experience, our physical injuries were more or less superficial. If we hadn’t been infected, we’d be fine in that aspect.

“I don’t even know your first name,” Jane said.

“It’s Anton,” I replied.

“Is it really, though? You don’t look like an ‘Anton.’”

“It’s one of the names the company gave me.”

“One of them?”

“The one I prefer to go by.”

She paused, mulling over where to take the conversation, and how to start asking the many questions she undoubtedly had. “You made a promise, remember? To tell me everything if we made it out of the forest alive.”

“To be fair, I didn’t think we’d actually make it.”

“Still.”

“Fair enough,” I said. “What do you want to know?”

Again, she lingered, not sure where to start.

“In the cave. Mark whispered something to you. What was it?”

“I already told you—he asked us to hurry,” I lied.

“No, he didn’t. He wouldn’t have told you that.”

I sighed. “He didn’t tell me anything.”

“Don’t you dare lie to me. I saw him talk.”

“What I mean is… it wasn’t him talking. The words weren’t his. It was the creature speaking through him. By the time we’d turned to leave, Mark was no longer there.”

On the brink of tears, Jane kept pushing. “I still want to know what it was.”

“Why does it matter? It wasn’t Mark.”

“It matters because I loved him,” she let out, her voice breaking as tears started rolling down her cheek.

I paused, letting her process her emotions, not sure how the truth would help either of us. But if it would bring her closure to know that Mark was long gone by the time we left, she deserved an honest conversation about it.

“He… it,” I corrected, “told me that the fifth Galilean moon has been found, and that they’re coming.”

“What does that mean?” Jane asked.

“I wish I knew. But I think it’ll be important.”

“So, this is what you do? Travel around and deal with monsters, saving a handful of people?”

“I work for a clandestine company dealing with paranormal, unknown, and extraterrestrial events,” I clarified.

Almost in disbelief, Jane stuttered as she kept the interview going. “You mean—you mean like aliens and ghosts?”

“More or less. Not ghosts in any layman’s meaning of the term, just things not yet explained by general science. Everything has an explanation; we just need to find it.”

“And what is this company called?”

“It’s better you don’t know. Getting involved is… ill advised.”

For hours, Jane kept asking anything, and everything she could think of. And as long as I was able, or had the knowledge to impart, I answered truthfully. For me, it was everyday business. I still felt fear and excitement when on assignment, but they were emotions I’d learned to hide from the general public. It wasn’t until Jane asked one final, personal question, that my façade began to break.

“Why do you work alone?” she asked.

“I…” I began, my words fading as I tried to come up with the right words. “It wasn’t always like that. I had a team… a great team full of capable, good people.”

“What happened to them?”

“I lost them.”

“I’m sorry,” she said, knowing better than to ask what had happened.

“That’s why I work alone. It’s better that way. I won’t be able to save everyone I come across. Sometimes I’m not even supposed to, but the ones I lose are strangers. It lessens the blow. At least to the point where I can sleep at night.”

Following that last question, we remained silent for a while, both of us giving the other space to process. But Jane seemed restless, as if there was something else on her mind, something she wasn’t quite ready to express. But then she dove headfirst into the deep end of the pool, and just said: “I want to work with you.”

“You can’t,” was all I had the heart to respond.

“I lost everything today. I have no family left, my colleagues, my friends, my…” she trailed off. “I have nothing.”

“It doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice yourself for this job.”

“But I need to. I need to know why this all happened to us. I can’t pretend it wasn’t real. I can’t go back and just exist, knowing these things are out there.”

Without Jane’s quick thinking on the field, none of us would have made it. She was clearly capable of performing the job, but even the most brilliant men and women I’d worked with had perished. I only existed because of an unsurmountable amount of luck that followed me, not because I was better.

“I can’t guarantee your safety,” I said.

“As I already told you, I don’t need you to.”

“You should know—that once you join the company, there’s no turning back. They’re not going to let you just go. So, I need you to be sure about this.”

“I’m sure.”

“Alright then.”

Though I worried about her safety, it felt comforting having someone else by my side, especially after what we went through in the Weeping River Forest. Because based on the horrors we saw back there—[things are just getting started.](https://www.facebook.com/richard.saxon.author)
