Earlier in the night, I went to the gas station for some allergy medicine, as I'd been sneezing and coughing all day, and it had finally gotten to the point where I couldn’t even function, mentally or physically. While walking in, a gentlemen dressed in what I can only describe as a theater jester’s attire—not a modern clown’s costume, but something more elaborate, and archaic—stopped me, and asked about my reasons for entering. His words were strangely lyrical, rhythmic in form though erratically spoken – like some crackhead bard.  

***What is it that plagues you, my wayward friend?***  

***Is there an illness or ailment you wish to end?*** 

Seeing as how I’d never been accosted by a gas station jester before, I figured I’d humor him for a moment. There were plenty of security cameras on the premises, and a few customers inside, so I wasn’t exactly worried for my safety.  

Well, I explained my dilemma to him, gesturing to my swollen face and mucous-leaking nose, for added effect. He nodded solemnly, as if he too had suffered such a condition could whole-heartedly empathize. With a pinkly gloved hand, he reached into a pocket in his costume and retrieved a small leather pouch, which he then extended to me. Perhaps a little delirious in my allergy-addled state, I accepted the pouch without question. Loosening the string that had fastened it shut, I peered inside and found three little capsules. They were black and translucent, their inner contents – a fine grey powder – barely visible through the dark casing.  

I looked up to the jester, and he again wordlessly nodded, as if in those capsules lay the solution to my problem. He then smiled, and with a quickness I wouldn’t have thought him capable, skipped away – backwards – into an alley beside the building. The soft tinkling of his hat’s bells echoed off into the night, seeming to augur something cryptic, if not outright baleful.  

Barely able to stand at this point, I went inside the gas station, bought a bottle of water, and returned to my car. More and more I began to believe the jester’s unspoken suggestion, that the capsules would in fact rid me of my body’s attack upon itself.  

Hungrily, desperately, *foolishly*, I threw the capsules into my mouth and drowned them with a heavy sip of water.  

The reaction was immediate, electrifying – unlike anything I'd ever experienced before. Thankfully, I had not yet started to drive; had remained in the gas station parking lot throughout the cross-dimensional foray into fantastic spaces and environs.... 

***Thrown back in time, through bygone cycles,*** ***anterior epochs before the Bible; old stories of evil and primal*** ***rivals, atrocities daily just for survival….*** 

Allergic to pollen, popped a pill, antihistamine-induced atavism; antediluvian anachronisms, wrapped in black ectoplasm and spat back into the past. 

Tripping off that Benadryl, no standing still, rampantly trampling Cyclopean anthills. Monstrous man-horrors crawling forth from coniferous landforms, grinning ghoulishly whilst picking at ass sores. 

Pterodactyls sweepin, proto-Draculas creepin, primordial slime-things sleepin while timelessly keepin their minds inclined toward undivine thinkin. 

&#x200B;

Noctivagant octopi occupying noxious oil spills 

Winged things perched up and mingling, 

Roaming beasts throwing heat looking for a thrill 

Extraordinarily horrid flora got me tingling. 

I'm allergic to this shit, too – I got an inkling. 

&#x200B;

Terror-maxxed, on that unspeakable grindset 

Leaches have latched – bout to be bloodlet  

Phlebotomized, terrorized, an addled target. 

&#x200B;

Stumbling through the swampish waters,  

Racing through the fens, 

Fending off the bog-lain monsters,  

The marshlands have no end. 

&#x200B;

The Chthonic capital sits before me, spires of stone and mud, 

Hadean phantoms flit and flurry, pleading for my blood 

Oaken stakes betoken fates incompatible with my life, 

Derelict guillotines imply a preference for the butcher's knife. 

&#x200B;

This olden outpost of Martian reign, 

Those otherworldly visitants from the crimson terrain 

Had lived upon the Earth’s young face, 

And held dominion, with ziggurat and fane 

But of now there is not the faintest trace. 

&#x200B;

I breach the ramparts of that time-lost fortress, 

Its soldiers take aim from lofty turrets 

Blackly armored sentinels who mean me duress 

For it is with my blood they’ll moisten their gullets 

&#x200B;

A portal opens, diphenhydramine departure  

A man-sized flaming aperture,  

Enraptured, I lurch through the window before I'm captured.  

&#x200B;

Meta-cosmic machinations spirit me through multi-dimensional computations of spacetime and quasi-spatial anomalies, in a state of nonentity while anonymous Andromedans dance nonchalantly atop nonagons and other polygonal platforms placed paradoxically parallel to my point of end. 

&#x200B;

Back in bed, the portal shimmers and closes, 

It’s finally over; Thank God, Jesus, and Moses 

Lights are off, though feels like something is lurking 

Only one way to scare it off: gotta start jerkin. 

A tittering, a cackling, fades into the night 

A hounding fiend dismissed by masturbatory might 

And thus ended my bizarre, hyper-real adventure into pre-human periods of Earthen life. My allergies are gone – though I feel as if I’ve been touched, *marked* by something arcane and spectral; some invisible, intangible symbol or rune of the far-flung past. Despite the terrors I faced, the horrors made known to me, I have a strange yearning to return to those azoic biomes, to venture rearward in Time and bask in that still-nascent sunlight, and listen to the squawks, croaks, and bleating of life-forms long-dead, of beasts and primordial Things whose morphologies would puzzle and terrify the zoologist and arachnologists; would send the herpetologist to the asylum, and would cause the botanist to reevaluate the supposed unintelligence of their subjects.... 

And, nearly as much, I miss the sudden, inexplicable propensity for a lyrical expression of my thoughts; the poetic ruminations, the verse-maker's musings.... 

I must find that Jester and obtain more of his wondrous, time-defying medicine. This mundane world of metal and machinery is not for me.
