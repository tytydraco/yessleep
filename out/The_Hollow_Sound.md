I’ve always been obsessed with podcasts. Some people binge-watch shows or scroll endlessly through social media; I had CreepCast. It wasn’t just background noise—it was my thing. I started listening obsessively back in 2024, when I was 19 and had just landed my first “real” job. Every morning, while I got ready for work, it would play.

I still remember the episode I was listening to the first time it happened. It was Penpal. A story about memory, loss, and something darker. At the time, I was an emotionally frayed kid, perpetually exhausted by the world’s sharp edges. I think that’s why I loved CreepCast so much—it was a safe way to explore the things that scared other people without ever feeling too overwhelmed myself. Reality had never felt quite solid to me anyway. The horrors in those stories weren’t real and weren’t coming to get me.

That morning, like any other, I had stepped out of the shower, my phone paired to the small black Bluetooth speaker on the counter. The podcast’s host had just started reading a particularly unsettling scene. I wrapped myself in a towel, the cold air biting at my skin as I reached to hit play again.

Then I heard it.

It wasn’t the narrator’s voice or the ambient noises layered into the episode for effect. This sound came from somewhere else.

A wet, crackling pulse.

It was faint at first, like the sound of damp wood twisting in a fire—but wetter, more organic. The noise slithered into my ears, bypassing the rational part of my brain entirely, and rooted itself somewhere deep. My skin prickled as if I were suddenly aware of every hair on my body.

It wasn’t coming from the speaker.

It wasn’t coming from my phone.

It wasn’t in the room.

But it also wasn’t inside me.

The sound didn’t belong, and yet it was there, pressing against the edges of my perception like a parasite trying to burrow in. My chest tightened with a nervous, instinctive revulsion, the kind that lives in your DNA—a feeling as ancient as fear itself.

I froze, towel clinging to my damp skin, heart pounding against my ribs. For a moment, the world around me felt warped. Stretched. Off-kilter. The tiny bathroom, the fogged mirror, the faint scent of my shampoo—all of it felt fragile, like a thin layer of glass over something unfathomable.

And the sound grew louder.

Not in volume, exactly, but in presence. It was everywhere and nowhere at once. Wet. Crackling. Pulsing. The kind of sound you shouldn’t hear unless you were submerged in something alive. My hands trembled as I reached for the speaker, fumbling to turn it off. The podcast stopped abruptly, cutting to silence.

But the noise didn’t stop.

It lingered for a moment, like a heartbeat that wasn’t mine. Then, just as suddenly as it had come, it was gone.

I stood there for what felt like hours, dripping onto the tiled floor, waiting for something—anything—to happen. But nothing did.

At least, not that day.

Over the next few days, the sound returned.

Sometimes it was just a faint pulse at the edge of my hearing—barely noticeable over the podcast’s narration. Other times, it would surge like a wave, so loud and visceral that I would lunge for my speaker in panic, convinced it was malfunctioning. But even when the sound cut out, it still lingered somewhere, crawling beneath my awareness like a splinter I couldn’t reach.

It started happening outside of the bathroom. At work. In my car. At night, just as I was drifting off to sleep. The wet crackling wasn’t tied to the podcast anymore. It was tied to me.

I stopped listening to CreepCast, hoping that would help. But it didn’t.

One night, while lying awake in bed, the sound returned, sharper and clearer than ever before. The wetness of it made my stomach churn, and the rhythmic pulse felt synchronized with the frantic pounding of my heart. I clamped my hands over my ears, but the noise didn’t stop.

I scrambled out of bed and into the bathroom, flicking on the harsh fluorescent lights. My reflection stared back at me, pale and sweat-slicked. My hands trembled as I gripped the sink, the cold porcelain grounding me just enough to catch my breath.

Then I saw it.

A faint red streak across my forearm.

My breath hitched as I leaned closer to the mirror. The skin was raw, angry, as if scratched or scraped—Peeled. The sight made my head swim, the edges of my vision darkening. The crackling sound intensified, louder now, louder than it had ever been.

I clenched my fists, nails digging into my palms, and bit down hard on my lip. The pain brought a fleeting clarity, and I swore to myself that I’d get a grip. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be.

But the scratches grew worse.

Day after day, I’d wake up with new ones. Angry red lines streaking across my arms, my legs, even my stomach. Some looked like deep gouges, as if something had clawed at me in my sleep. Others were smaller but more numerous, overlapping in chaotic patterns like a frenzy of violence.

My coworkers started noticing. “Are you okay?” they’d ask, eyes darting to the long sleeves I now wore every day, even in the summer heat. “You look… tired.”

I was tired. The sound wouldn’t let me sleep. It was always there now, in the background, eating away at my thoughts. Wet. Pulsing. Endless.

Eventually, I stopped going to work altogether. I couldn’t face anyone. Couldn’t explain the scratches or the sound. I locked myself in my room, curtains drawn tight, and tried to drown the sound out with music, TV, anything. But it was always louder.

One night, I caught myself in the bathroom mirror again, staring blankly at my reflection. My skin was a mess of red and raw patches, my eyes sunken and wild. My hands trembled at my sides, caked with dried blood I didn’t remember shedding.

They found me curled up on the bathroom floor. I remember flashes: the cool sting of a stretcher against my skin, the red-black smear of blood on my fingertips, the blur of faces looming over me. I remember the sound too—wet and pulsing, louder than ever, drowning out the panicked voices around me.

When I woke up, I wasn’t in my apartment anymore.

The room was blindingly white, sterile. The faint scent of antiseptic burned my nose. My arms were wrapped tightly in gauze, and my wrists were bound to the sides of the bed with thick straps. I tried to move, but even that small effort left me dizzy and nauseous.

“Good, you’re awake,” a voice said gently.

I turned my head slowly, the motion making my neck ache. A woman in a white coat stood at the foot of my bed, clipboard in hand. Her expression was calm, but there was a flicker of something else behind her eyes—caution, maybe.

“Do you know where you are?” she asked.

My voice came out as a dry rasp. “No.”

“You’re in the psychiatric ward at St. Vincent’s. My name is Dr. Bennett. Do you remember what happened before you got here?”

I blinked at her, the question heavy in my head. My memories felt fragmented, like pieces of a puzzle forced together in all the wrong ways. I remembered the sound, the scratches, the blood. I remembered the mirror. My reflection. My hands.

“No,” I lied.

She nodded, glancing down at her clipboard. “Your neighbors called the police after hearing you screaming. They found you in your bathroom, severely injured. Do you know how you got those wounds?”

I didn’t answer. My mouth felt like it was full of sand.

Dr. Bennett sighed softly and moved closer, her tone growing gentler. “This isn’t unusual in cases like yours. When someone is under immense stress, sometimes the mind… fractures. It tries to cope in ways that can be harmful. That’s what we’re going to work on, okay?”

I stared at her, my heart pounding harder with every word. Something about her tone, her choice of words—fractures, stress, coping—made me feel like I was a child being scolded for drawing on the walls. But it was more than that.

It was the wet sound. The squelch. The pulse. It was louder now, thrumming through my skull like a second heartbeat. My body stiffened against the straps.

“Do you hear it?” I whispered.

Dr. Bennett tilted her head. “Hear what?”

“The sound,” I hissed, my voice rising. “It’s in my head. It’s everywhere. I can’t—”

Her expression didn’t change. If anything, it softened, like she was trying not to spook me. “It’s not real,” she said calmly. “I know it feels real, but it’s a hallucination. Something your brain is creating in response to trauma. It’s common for people with schizophrenia—”

“I’m not crazy!” I snapped, thrashing against the restraints. The sound grew deafening, roaring in my ears like an ocean tide, wet and endless. “It’s real! It’s not just in my head—it’s me. It’s me! Can’t you hear it?!”

“Calm down,” she said firmly, stepping back to signal a nurse. “We’re going to give you something to help you relax.”

But her words faded into the background as the memories rushed in all at once.

The scratches.

The blood.

The jagged red lines carved into my arms, my legs, my stomach. My nails, broken and filthy, scraping endlessly at my skin while the sound whispered encouragement in my ears.

My breathing hitched, tears spilling down my face. My eyes darted to Dr. Bennett, who was watching me closely, a needle in her hand now.

“It’s me,” I whispered again, my voice breaking. “

Here’s an enhanced and extended version of your story with more horror detail, dialogue, and the protagonist’s haunting realization during a lucid moment:

They found me curled up on the bathroom floor. I remember flashes: the cool sting of a stretcher against my skin, the red-black smear of blood on my fingertips, the blur of faces looming over me.

“It’s me,” I whispered again, my voice breaking. 

Weeks passed. The hospital room, sterile and quiet, became my refuge. They said I was sick—schizophrenic, they called it. My wounds, my actions, the sound—it was all explained away as a product of my “fractured mind.”

The medication helped. Slowly, the wet, squelching noise faded. The overwhelming compulsion to tear at my skin ebbed until it was a faint, almost forgotten itch. Dr. Bennett assured me this was progress, and after weeks of therapy, she sat me down with a calm but firm tone.

“You’re doing well,” she said. “Your hallucinations have stopped, and you’ve shown no signs of self-harm. How do you feel about going home?”

Home. The word felt strange after everything. But the thought of leaving the sterile walls of the hospital, of resuming a normal life, was too tempting to resist. I nodded.

“Good. But remember, triggers are dangerous,” she continued. “Avoid stress, keep taking your medication, and if anything feels overwhelming—anything at all—you call us. Understand?”

I agreed. A week later, I was discharged.

At home, everything felt… quieter. My apartment seemed smaller, darker, but I chalked it up to the time I’d spent away. I avoided the bathroom mirror and kept my Bluetooth speaker shoved in the back of a drawer. The wounds on my arms had faded to scars—long, jagged reminders of what I was told wasn’t real.

I fell into a routine. Work, therapy, sleep. For the first time in months, life felt stable.

Then CreepCast showed up in my podcast feed.

It was an early morning when I saw it: “New Episode: The Hollow Sound.”

My heart skipped a beat. I hadn’t listened to a single episode since the hospital. My finger hovered over the screen. Dr. Bennett had warned me about triggers, but something about the title tugged at me, whispering that it would be okay. I was better now. Stronger.

I tapped play.

The familiar voices filled my headphones, warm and hearty, like a memory I didn’t know I missed. I leaned back and let the story unfold, the gentle hum of narration lulling me into a strange kind of peace.

Until I heard it again.

The wet, pulsing sound returned faintly at first, almost imperceptible beneath the narration. I froze, my stomach twisting. My breath came quicker, but I told myself it wasn’t real. I turned up the volume, drowning it out.

But it didn’t stop.

It got louder, rising in rhythm, a sickening pulse that made the edges of my vision blur. I yanked out the earbuds and threw my phone across the couch. The sound didn’t go away.

It was coming from the walls.

My hands began to shake. My mind spun. It’s not real. It’s not real. It’s not real. I repeated it like a mantra, but the words felt weak, powerless against the rising panic that squeezed my chest.

My eyes darted around the room, but nothing was there. It’s all in my head, I tried to convince myself. I grabbed my phone and hit the contact for Dr. Bennett.

The line rang, echoing too loud in my ears.

“Hello, this is Dr. Bennett,” came her familiar voice, calm and professional, but somehow distant.

“Dr. Bennett, it’s me. Something’s happening. The noise—it’s back. The wet sound.”

I heard her pause, the calmness in her voice still there, but tinged with something else. Was it concern? “Take a deep breath, and tell me what you’re experiencing.”

“It’s—I—I can hear it. It’s like it’s coming from the walls, and I feel it—inside me, like it’s crawling under my skin again. I can’t—”

The phone slipped from my shaking hand, but I didn’t notice. I didn’t need to hear her words anymore. My eyes locked on the doorframe of my apartment, where the shadow had moved. The darkness was spreading, thickening, like ink bleeding across paper.

Something shifted in the corner of the room.

I was no longer alone.

“Dr. Bennett, it’s real. It’s in the—”

I never finished the sentence.

A figure stepped from the shadows, its movement slow and deliberate. My breath stopped. The creature didn’t make a sound, but I felt its presence—a weight in the air, suffocating.

It was huge. A hulking mass of malformed flesh. Its body was an unnatural patchwork of skin, muscles, and sinew, stitched together in jagged, grotesque seams. The flesh seemed to pulse, as if it were alive on its own, writhing and twitching like a colony of parasites beneath the surface.

The claws were the worst part. Long, jagged, and twisted, they scraped the walls with an awful, rasping noise that made my stomach churn. But it was the way it moved that froze me.

It didn’t run. It didn’t need to. It slithered, almost like it was gliding on its own sickening weight, its presence suffocating. It lurked in the corners of my vision, always just on the edge, just barely out of focus. And it watched.

It’s not real, I told myself, but the words felt hollow in the pit of my stomach.

I scrambled for my phone, but it slid away from my reach, and the wet sound—the squelch—filled the apartment, louder now, like it was coming from all sides. It was inside the walls, inside the floors, inside me. The creature knew it.

I fell back against the wall, my breath shallow, chest tightening, as it crawled closer. Its claws scraped across the floor, a sound that seemed to slice through my very bones. It didn’t speak, but I could feel it in my bones—its hunger, its need.

It wanted me.

And the worst part was, I knew that it had always been here, just waiting for the right moment, the right crack in my mind to slip through.

And now, I couldn’t escape.
