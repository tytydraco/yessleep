This is a post I have decided to make to look for advice. Nothing short of an expert in the strange, unusual, and (as ridiculous as it may sound) paranormal will suffice. There is just one thing that I need to know. How do you get a dead body to stop talking?



Starting at the beginning may help you to understand that this wasn’t my fault. The body belonged to my best friend of twelve years. It now, however, seems to belong to something else. His name was Dylan, and I know he didn’t ask for any of this. It was just an accident. This could have happened to anybody. They say only the good die young. I couldn’t help but wonder what the hell he had done in his life to make that saying a complete lie. 



Just for context, as I plan to transcribe to the best of my memory what transpired in the last several hours, my name is Jerry. It’s lame I know but I didn’t pick it. Seeing as how the amount of times it has been called out over this last night, I found it necessary to include. Unintentionally, I had spent all night as a proverbial guide through a world beyond our own, yet so intrinsically linked to it and us as a whole. 



Dylan and I always loved “partying” in our own way. Quotations are used only because we never partied with dozens of people, or in a club, or really outside of anyone’s home. More often than not we just had a couple people together, maybe some people’s girlfriends when we even had them, and a probably-more-than-fathomable amount of alcohol. Last night we got stood up by others in our group because they wanted to sleep early. That easily made that fathomable amount of alcohol quite a considerable amount for only two people skinnier than your local junkie without ever having indulged in any form of illegal substance.



“Bro you GOTTA fucking put on that one shit from back in middle school bro.” Dylan was already far beyond what I could be close to in that moment holding my half empty second can of cheap pisswater. I was never an outgoing person, not even now with only one person that I’ve known for over a decade in front of me. He had been compensating for the both of us that night. “What the fuck was it? The fucking one where they say don’t drop the tink-tink or what the fuck?”



“It’s Don’t Drop that Thun Thun”, I said dryly. I was already over it. 

“Yo that’s it!”, he said, “Play that shit dude!”

I went ahead and played the song, which apparently encouraged him to climb on the table with a beer in his hand. After about two minutes of an insufferable sing-along and the dance movements that would make any person with a brain cringe, he came up with an idea. “Dude, yo man for real you seen that Jackass shit?”



“What?”, I replied full of confusion, “You mean like with Johnny Knoxville and shit? I mean yeah, why?”



“Dude yes! Check it out bro this is going to be hilarious!” Then Dylan proceeded to swig some of the liquid in his beer down and turn the bottle over in his hand. He lifted the bottle above his head. I knew just what he was planning, and I saw absolutely no point to it besides pain and a dangerous mess to clean up. “Aw c’mon man don’t hit yourse-“ I began as he swung the bottle down. For what he considered funny in his blacked-out state, Dylan smashed a beer bottle on his head, shattering it and making a trail of blood instantly rain from the top of his scalp. 



“Ahh fuck!”, he yelled, clutching his head and continuing to hold onto the broken bottle in his hand, “I swear to God, I saw that fuckin’ Steve-O dude smash something on his head and like, walked away totally fine dude.”



“You fucking idiot!’, I began to yell at him, “You’re cleaning that up man, that’s not cool.”



“Alright bro chill, I’m sorry.” Dylan had already begun to sober himself up. Still holding his head he started to climb down from the table. What neither of us realized is he didn’t finish the beer before smashing it like we thought. There was still a small pool at the bottom of the bottle along with some foam. Not much by any degree, but enough for him to not be paying attention and slip. I wish I could say that moment happened in slow motion. It would have made me feel like there was more I could have done. Instead, it was much too fast. Dylan slipped, fell with his full weight on my carpeted floor, but not before accidentally holding the broken bottle in front of him. He landed on it. Dylan was face down on the floor with an ever expanding pool flowing from him. 



In a panic, I turned him over to assess the damage. The sharpened, broken beer bottle was through his throat while he still held the neck of it, grip tightening rather than loosening. Blood sprayed from the edges of the wound in pressurized jets with every heart beat that was slowing with each passing second. 



“Jesus, man! Let it go don’t fucking mess with it, I’ll call an ambulance!”, I yelled at him as I turned to grab my phone. Before I could, in some trance of shock and panic, Dylan did the opposite of what I said. I suppose he had seen too many movies and wanted the foreign object out of his throat as soon as possible. With his grip on the bottleneck tight, he ripped it from his throat. I screamed a massive saddened “No” but it was muted out by the reality we both faced. The blood didn’t jet out anymore, instead just a massive waterfall of red poured down from what was once Dylan’s throat. Chunks of flesh were ripped out as he removed the bottle, practically taking half of his neck with it. Any more damage and he would be considered decapitated. 



Dylan stumbled, reached out, clutched, and I think gasped. A tear formed in the corner of his eye. It told me he knew he was dying. That he didn’t want to go yet. He was 22. I don’t even know if he had ever drank enough to black out before today. His eyes brought me back to the present. They were vacated, gone, empty as he collapsed to the ground like a sick rag doll. The thud onto the ground vacated the rest of the loose organs in his throat. Then there was silence. Then I was alone. 



———————





It’s interesting how logic seems to leave you in times of utter crisis. Dylan was dead, I knew this. I watched him die in one of the most gruesome ways I could imagine right in front of me, blood actively staining my living room rug. No movement was present in his anatomy anymore. For a while, I’m not sure if it was minutes or seconds, his shoulder would twitch occasionally in slower and slower increments as those indiscernible measurements of time passed us by. All of these observations did not stop me from saying something.



“Dylan?…” Breath escaped from my perpetually open lips in labored, ragged patterns. “Dylan… are you okay?”



Of course Dylan was not okay, and never would be again. These circumstances may have been due to his momentary stupidity but I couldn’t help but feel utterly and singularly responsible. My friend’s corpse was not going to get up and call an ambulance or police on its own. I still could not bring myself to move an inch.



“Jerry…?” My eyes shot wide. I dared not move any muscle. Surely the sound I had just heard was due to some minor shift I made that caused some floor board to creak or some wind to move or anything other than the body on my floor to call out my name when its vocal chords were in tatters five and a half feet away from the owner. 



“Jerry, are you there?” The voice called again. Dylan’s face down body still did not move. There was no rise and fall in the torso to signify air flowing in and out of active lungs. “Jerry I can’t fucking see anything!” He was sounding more and more fearful.



“Hey man, it’s okay I’m right here you’re going to be okay.” These words casually left me when I knew it to be completely false. That being said, he must have survived the ordeal so I should be relieved. There may be a chance for him to make it through. However, he still did not have vocal cords anymore. How was he talking?



“Jerry turn me over, man, I’m fucking scared.” After Dylan said this to me, I obliged and turned him over. The sight nearly made me vomit. Blood was starting to congeal and his head fell back loosely making tearing sounds as fat and tissue separated from the weight shifting. His eyes were open and vacant. Signs of a soul had long since departed from them. As I looked into those empty windows, his mouth moved independently of everything else. “Jerry please help me.”



I hesitated to respond. Nothing could tell me how this was happening. He was dead. Dylan could not be alive no matter what he said. I still had to help how I could.

 

“What can I do?”, I asked him in barely a whisper. 



“Jerry I’m getting really hot. It’s unbearable. Please, I still can’t see anything, can you please just cool me down? It’s so hot”



He sounded so pitiful. Acceptance of the situation still had not occurred in my brain. Surely it had to be some kind of mental episode brought on by the trauma that laid before me. No arguments arose as I had no intention of fighting back against my own psyche. This was all dire enough as it was. 



I rose from the floor, red handprint pressed into the carpet from the widening pool. Quickly I ran to the kitchen and fetched water from the tap, trying to get it as cold as possible but not wanting to leave my dead friend waiting too long. When I returned, somehow the corpse was sweating. Dylan’s sweat-dripped face was not indicative of the decreasing body temperature his body maintained. 



“Jerry? Jerry is that you? Oh, thank God. The heat, Jerry. It’s so much worse. I can see now. I see it. It’s the fire, Jerry. It wants me.” Dylan said this to me from the only moving part of his body. Everything else was more dead than a doornail rusted out of its socket and scattered to the wind after the eons of decay and tarnish had claimed what was theirs. Immediately after his statement, he began to howl.



Please understand. Dylan was howling. Not screaming, or crying or begging or pleading or whining. This corpse, this body, this… human was howling. It was like an animal trapped in a cage with a sadistic child above, tormenting it just to see what sounds the creature can make. A blowtorch here, clippers there. 



“Jerry!” Dylan screamed from the top of his lungs. “Jerry I’m on fucking fire! The flames don’t end. My skin, it’s peeling away only to fall right back down and peel again. I can see it. My eyes are melting. I can see them melting in my head, Jerry. How can I see my own eyes?”



I didn’t hesitate to throw the water on him. No movement came from the body, but the recoil could be heard in his voice. The moment I splashed the water, the howl erupted even fiercer than before. He said to me it was like acid. It WAS acid. I mean, it was water, yes, but that’s here in our world. Whatever I had done was different wherever he was. 



“They know, Jerry, they see. They see everything! They won’t let you help, they won’t allow me any relief. They made it sulphuric acid. They know, they see. And they want me to know. What they do to me. What they want to do. All I see is the endless fire.”



Sitting on the floor and listening was all I could do. This dead body was projecting its own afterlife and I was just a spectator. Dylan had to have some sort of connection to allow him to transmit. Or maybe there was something wrong with the coding. Wires got crossed somewhere. A hole was opened. Just enough to let something through. The only hope left in me was that Dylan’s suffering was all that would cross the void. 



“Jerry, they’re taking me. The fire, it’s getting farther in the distance. I’m being dragged by the ankle. It’s dark again, I can’t see anything.” His voice sounded relieved. Being dragged must have been a trip to Heaven compared to seeing your eyes evaporate from your skull. 



“Ah!”, he began to scream in pain,”Something fucking bit me! I felt something bite at my arm.” More shouts and screams echoed from his decaying lips. Dylan shouted about how there were things in the dark. They were taking turns biting and gnawing and gnashing. Pieces were removed. Flesh devoured from unknown entities. They were everywhere as he was dragged through the dark. All around the teeth of creeping and nasty things ate at his body, ripping him apart. He described to me the detail of the dark things tearing open his stomach and disemboweling him. 



“It’s so dark I can’t see anything at all,” he began,”but they show me. They want me to know everything they’re doing. Every second that passes I relive the pain from the beginning like it’s fresh and new.” I could tell he was slipping. Perhaps that was the only route humans can take when faced with the purest and cleanest of despairs. The pain becomes all and is welcomed. 



Dylan told me that the entities continued to drag him but he could see now. It was a forest. Dark, and desolate. Light seemingly was present, but there was no source or sky. He described it as an endless vast bluish-dark landscape. Dreary and grey with trees. Rows and rows of twisted, mangled trees.



“There are bodies. They hang. From every branch they hang, Jerry. They did this to themselves. I have no pity.” His words and tone were getting colder by the minute. Dylan had not healed from the bites. He told me about how he knew and could feel and could unknowingly see that he was eviscerated. Meat hung, intestines draped like a curtain dragging through the mud, and limbs gone or barely attached. The attacks only stopped because they wanted to see the ‘life’ drain from him. The man was in tatters being dragged through evil. Humanity was being pulled from his essence like the things in the dark hoped for. 



For a long while I sat and just listened. One time he asked to hold my hand, but the moment I grabbed it he made noises that will stand out in my brain when I inevitably think back to this haunting event. No matter what he said, from then on I didn’t help. At least I could still let him know he wasn’t alone. The creatures from Dylan’s Hell couldn’t prevent that it seemed.



“The light is different now. It’s somewhere new.” I was almost convinced he was looking forward to things at this point, but I knew he had been broken hours ago. For me it was hours. He died at 10:35 PM, and when I checked the clock it was going on almost 6 in the morning. Sleep was a faint dream I think I had once. All that was present in this moment was the journey. 



“Children,” Dylan said in a solemn voice,”There’s children, falling from the sky. There is no sky. There is just the dark and the void. They fall and land here. I see furnaces. Orange lighting as far as the eye can see. Men in gas masks. Not men, things. The children fall. Not children, babies. Most break apart on impact, but the piles soften the fall of others. Piles, and piles of poor babies. The gas mask men take their shovels and put them into the furnace. Endless waves, infinite.”



Nothing could compare to the horrid feeling of hopelessness that fell upon me then. Poor children, so many. They didn’t deserve that. Why they were there, I didn’t and couldn’t possibly know. These thoughts were the things I was thinking before Dylan started talking again. I thought things like, ‘why God?’ and ‘Please help us’. But Dylan had to talk again.



“They hear you, Jerry. They know, they see, they hear. I have a message from them. It’s for you Jerry.” Terror seized my brain and froze me from any type of reaction to anything. “God is not here. God is dead. I have seen his lifeless corpse. They dance on it. Celebrations through the void. It is only them, Jerry. They wanted me. They used me.”



It was then that the most chilling thing to me from this entire night happened. Dylan started to smile. A cold, darkened black smile with only death as the wielder. 

 

“They opened the door through me, Jerry. They wanted to take me. And now, they will take you too. Please, Jerry. You said you didn’t want me to be alone. Join me, Jerry. C’mon, it’s okay I promise. Aren’t we best friends? There are so many games we can play. And it’s all forever. It never has to end, Jerry. Isn’t that great? Come with me, Jer-“ 



“Shut up!”, I shouted as I jumped up. Not being able to take one more second I decided to close the ‘door’. Lifting my foot and bringing it down on Dylan’s head appeared the most efficient. I slammed, and lifted, smashed, and lifted. Brain soaked into my sock. I stomped Dylan’s skull until all that remained was a paste amalgamated from the pile of remnants. Jelly clung to my clothes. Blood had flown to my face, and my eyes were wide. As I took a deep breath, I absorbed the silence. 



“Come with me, Jerry.” A voice rang out from every direction. It was Dylans, at least at first. It began to morph and shift, never clinging to anything solid. “We’re with you, Jerry. We’ll always be with you, Jerry. We’re waiting. Dylan’s waiting. Come, Jerry. Stand in the dark with us.”



This post is being made for any advice. How do I get my dead friend’s, and his new friends’, voices out of my head? I don’t think you’ll know, because I don’t. The problem is, is that I know where I’m going when I die. I don’t know when an accident will take me too. If no answers can be found from this post, then I think I have only one option. I’m going there no matter what. I know that now. No god will hear my prayers. So, if that is how it is, then I don’t want to be dragged down. I will go to the trees.
