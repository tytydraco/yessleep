My name is Charles. Years ago, when I was only 13 years old, something happened at school, something I will never forget. Me and my friends: Xavier, Sam, Tall Sam and Oliver were hanging out of the school hallways. We had nothign to do that day, we were bored. Sam had the idea to go outside and we followed him to his locker where his sweater was. I lived in Canada and, at that time of the year, it was a bit cold outside. Me, Xavier and Tall Sam were behind Sam and Oliver, suddenly, Xavier had the idea to run away as a prank. This is the mistake we made, it's when the group separated that it had to opportunity to get us. We ran as fast as we could, leaving Sam and oliver behind. We hid on the second floor, in an area of the school more isolated. Xavier took out his phone, took a photo of a poster on the wall acompanied by his middle finger and sent it to Sam. Hopefully, Sam would guess where we were based on the poster and try to find us. At this stage, it was jsut a game of hide and seek with small hints to help Sam and oliver find us in the vastness of the school. 

After a few of those hint message with some obscenities in them, we heard the two boys approach based on their voices. We sprinted to the basement. The basement was composed of a lot of staircases, doors, gymnasiums and locker rooms. We hid under the stairs this time. If we just sat in plain sight like we did before, we would certainly get caught.

Then, we heard them again, Xavier and Tall Sam took off while leaving me there. I didn't know where they went so I ran in a random direction. This was the second mistake we made. Now we were even more separated. Eventually, Xavier sent a hitn on the groupchat. Because of my good memory, I immediatly knew where this was and hurried to get there because I was still playing the game. I was too slow, I arrived and the seekers were there. I ran back before they noticed me. 

A notification on my phone informed me they had changed spot another time. The photo showed a middle finger on the center with a staircase and a door in the background. Another photo showed the door opened and Tall Sam stepping inside. I was not familiar at all with this part of the school. There were many doors that hid in plain sight by being so generic they become a part of the background and not an entrance to anything. 

I knew Xavier and knew he went back to the basement. When I got there, there was no door under the staircase. He msut ahve chosen another staircase. I looked and I looked but no staircase had a door under. Even outside the basement, I couldn't find one. I wasn't hallucinating. I ran up the stairs and went in the alley where the music class took place. I had art so i never really explored this corridor. I tryed every doorknob and one was unlocked. I toom a photo and sent it to teh groupchat. Then I entered. It was dark. It searched for a light switch but couldn't find one. It wasn't important, I would just use my phone's flashlight.

The room was filled with pipes and machines. It was some kind of alimentation room. I wasn't supposed to be there. The janitor must have left it unlocked. There was another door in the back of the rooms. I lifted up some wires that were in the way and got inside. It was a dark hallway. Probably used by the staff to travel through the locked maintenance rooms more easily. I heard a voice; it was Tall Sam calling Xavier. A door opened at the end of the hallway and we made eye contact. 

-Oh ! you're there. i think we lost you a couple of minutes ago, he said.  
-Are you searching for Xavier ? I thought he was still with you.  
-No, when we entered the small room in the photo, I looked around and, when I looked back, he wasn't there anymore.  
-He's pranking us.

At this time, it must have been close to the end of lunch break. I decided to meet up with the boys and get to class but, when I looked at my watch, it wasn't a watch anymore; it was a wrist. A wrist with no watch on it. It probably fell off when i was running. I didn't pay much attention to that detail because it was a pretty cheap watch. Then I wanted to look at the time on my phone. I had put it in my pocket because teh hallway was dim but i could still see. When I reached in my pocket my phone wasn't there. At taht moment i freaked out. Losing my watch is one thing but losing 500$ is another. I'm gonna get in trouble when I get back home, I told myself.  I couldn't have been more wrong.

This time, Xavier sent a photo of the outdoor building. A mysterious building that was next to the tennis court and the road. Apparently it was unlocked. Me and Tall Sam ran outside, it was cold, and we got there before Sam and Oliver. Xavier was there, waiting for us. 

-Let's move a last time and then we'll meet up with Sam and Oliver, he said.  
-Do you know what time it is ?, I asked.

He grabbed his phone and it showed 8:10 AM. It was impossible. School started after that hour. How could we be at school since 3 hours ago but it didn't even start. We thought it was probably just a bug and decided to go to our classes. On our way, Xavier got a notification. It was a photo, a photo of a door between two lockers in the big locker area. It was really strange because the photo was sent by Xavier himself. Once again, something here was impossible. This was not possible. Someone was pulling a prank on us. It wasn't someone. 

Curiosity won over our rationality. We went to the locker area and it was there. A door, on the wall where I swear there wasn't one before. We entered and were met with a dusty stair going down. It probably led to the other basement, a basement in the front of the school with only classes and special need classes. We were just above a closed room with potentially just electronics and random machines, maybe the water heater. It was just that. We switched on the lights and explored. Then we heard Sam arrive. 

-I found you guys, he said.  
-where's Oliver ?  
-What ?! I thought he was with you !

We exchanged confused looks as we were wondering where he could have possibly went. We looked around because Sam wanted to do some vandalism and maybe steal valuable objects. Yeah, I'm not proud of that phase... We saw a spyrale staircase and Xavier went to inspect it. He climbed up and disappeared through the ceiling.

-It's just the storage room guys.  
-Okay, get down and let's go back to our classes.   
No response.  
-Xavier ?  
Still no reponse.  
-It's not funny Xavier !

I went to check and nobody was there, only cardboard boxes and dust. I climbed down and told my friends the unsettling truth. We were shocked. There was no place for him to escape. Then, as we were gonna get back up to the lockers, we realized there was no more staircase... 

We yelled and yelled, kicking the locked door that lead to the basement. It seemed like nobody was there to hear our screams. Tall Sam got an idea. He took out the saw he had in his backpack for some reason. He explained he had it because he stole it from the carpentry equipment the school had. I was not impressed but whatever, it was his thing, stealing people's stuff simply for the fun of it. like I said, I deeply regret that phase of my life. He grabbed a chair and started cutting the ceiling that, unlike the majority of the school's ceiling, was made out of plaster. Then he climbed inside the hollow space between it and the floor above and disappeared. Just like Xavier did. And just like with Xavier, he never came out.

Me and Sam were petrified, at this stage, he was actually crying. We were more scared than we ever were. He had enough. With a powerful kick, the locked door was sent flying and we came out of that room of horror. Then I asked him:

-Sam, where and when was the last time you saw oliver.   
-That was when he entered the room under the staircase. I heard him say there was nobody and then, silence. I went to check and only found his lunchbox.

I was not only sweating, I was breathing heavily and entirely terrified. Sam was too, I could tell. We ran to the last obstacle to our escape: the basement doors. Like I knew deep dowm inside me, they were locked.

-I'm gonna go see if the other one is locked, he said.  
There was another one at the end of the hallway. The front basement was basically just a long hallway.  
-I'm gonna stay there in case I see someone, i replied.

It started with voices. I thought I was going crazy for sure. Then I saw them, police officers breaking the door and rescuing me. They asked me if I was alright. I was very confused. I thought I was gonna get yelled at for destroying a door and going to places I shouldn't be especially since I wasn't th best student. And why were there police officers. When we got outside I realized; it was dark. They told me I never came back from school and my parents were going crazy. 

-Sam is still there.  
-Who ?  
-Sam, my friend, he was with me and was trying to find a way out.  
-Buddy, there wasn't anybody in that school except you, no other missing person has been reported. 

Then I saw it, a pair of glowing whites eyes staring at me from the school entrance. That day, it got all of us except me. I was the one that survived, that escaped, but I don't know if I prefer that over getting caught by it. It never let's a prey go. As I'm writing this, I can see the reflection of its glowing eyes on the screen of my computer...
