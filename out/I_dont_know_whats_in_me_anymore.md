Me and my girlfriend used to laugh about stupid creepy facts, its how we fell asleep most nights, a dumb little ritual that felt safe, like holding hands with the dark. She would find the grossest science things and read them to me and we would try not to scream. Last week she read about FLATWORMS, how the head remembers when you cut it, how another worm can EAT that head and learn it too. We joked, we dared each other to imagine stealing memories with a bite, i thought it was sick in a funny way and then she got that look, like when someone has a plan and they think it is brilliant.

She came home with a plastic dish, like a present. Pale little worms sleeping inside it, moving like wet rice, and she looked at them like they were magic. She told me she ordered a kit, her voice all soft and excited, and i laughed because who orders worms, who does this, and she said, we do, and the grin on her face made my chest hurt in a way that felt like love and like wrongness all at once.

She trained one of them, tapping the glass flashing a light, whispering like it was a secret between them. I sat there thinking this was some stupid phase but i watched it learn, it turned to the light like it had been doing it forever, like it already knew and was just remembering. I felt my stomach drop in a slow heavy way, like the floor under me was giving up.

Then she took a razor, no hesitation, no flinch, and cut it up. I could not look but i looked because i couldnt look away, and she fed the pieces to the others and watched them with this terrible pride. Her teeth looked sharp in the lamp light and she was smiling and i wanted to throw up and i wanted to kiss her and i wanted to run outside into the street and never come back. A few hours later the new worms turned to the light too and she clapped her hands like a child and said, see, see, it works, and i wanted to tell her to stop but my voice turned into cotton.

That night she woke me up breathing like she had just run a marathon, eyes blown wide like someone opened a door in her skull and shined a flashlight right in. She kept whispering that she remembered places she had never been, small things at first, a smell, a metal clang, a number carved into wood, and she said it like she was reading from a page that wasnt hers. I held her and i was so proud of her for being alive and i was so scared like a dog with teeth showing.

Then the dreams started, or maybe they are memories now i cant tell. Last night i stood in a basement that smelled of rust and wet concrete and old blood, chains hanging low like they were waiting to hug someone. I woke up choking and she was sitting in the dark staring at the wall and said, thats where they kept me, like it was a line from a play. She has never lived near a basement, she has never told me a story about being taken or locked, and she said it like she was relieved to finally remember.

This morning the dish was empty. No worms, no water, nothing. The sink was clean like someone washed everything away. Her smile when i asked her was slow and soft and wrong, and she said dont worry about it. Her breath smelled like dirt and something sour and i wanted to crawl out of my own skin. I think she fed one to me while i slept, i keep replaying the night in pieces, a flash of her hand, the taste of metal in my mouth, a softness like warm bread then nothing, like waking up with a fragment stuck in my throat.

Now i get images, like someone is flipping through a photo album inside my head and i am not the one turning the pages. Faces that are not mine, a manâ€™s hand with a ring i do not recognize, a child screaming once and then silence, a door being shut and the lock turning slow. I can feel something moving under my ribs sometimes, not my heart, something with cold little feet. I find myself humming a song i dont know, i find myself writing a name on the back of my hand that i cannot read.

I love her, i loved her something fierce and stupid enough to believe in forever. I can smell the flowers she bought me last month when i close my eyes and i can hear her laugh when she hides behind her hands like a kid, and that love makes all of this hurt so much worse. Because the person who cut that worm up and fed it, the person who smiled at the way the others learned is the person who sleeps next to me. The same hands that held my face are the hands that slid something inside me i cant pull out.

Sometimes she looks at me and i see pity in her eyes, like she is sorry but also like she found a solution to a problem and im the experiment. Sometimes she looks at me like she always did, soft and warm and stupid in love, and i want to believe it. I try to talk to her and my words come out small and stupid and she answers like i am being dramatic, and then later i find rope burn marks on my arm from a dream i had where my wrists were tied, and she says maybe you sleepwalk, maybe youre stressed, maybe youre making things up, and i believe her because what else is there to do besides believe the person you trust the most.

I am losing trust in myself more than anything, i cant tell if the memory of the cutting is mine or if i swallowed it like a seed and it grew into the things now living under my skin. My hands twitch when i try to hold hers, like they are trying to do something they cant do unless they are told. I apologize for things i dont remember doing. I catch myself staring at the kitchen knife and not being able to say why.

If you read this and think im being dramatic go ahead and call me crazy. Maybe i am. Maybe she is. Maybe both. Maybe neither. All i know is i am waking up with places i never saw and the same smell on my pillow and that tight hot panic that slides into my throat when i think about the idea of being eaten alive by someone i love.

If this post ends mid sentence it is because whatever is in me found the keys to my phone. If you have any idea what to do tell me because i am afraid and i am tired and i am still so in love and i dont know which part to save.

Please, somebody tell me how to get back to me
