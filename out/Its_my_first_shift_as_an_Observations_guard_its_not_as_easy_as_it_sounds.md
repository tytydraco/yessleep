First day on shift, and it just had to be night shift. Looking down the seemingly endless hallway with two offices on each side, I could barely make out the management office's door with an employee sitting on a stool by the side.



I made my way to my own office, guided only by my own intuition of being lost everywhere I went. The office itself was blatantly plain- a white desk set in the middle of the square room, accompanied by a office chair which still reeked of a Chinese sweatshop. On the desk was a run-of-the-mill computer setup as well as a silver-plated plaque that read my name.



I guess working for OmniView Security wasn't so bad. I didn't have to forcibly mingle with colleagues and my job was really simple in comparison to the other positions the company offered-



All I had to do was sit at a desk without breaks, view the camera feed of any site(depending on what they give me) secured by OmniView and check each and every room, ensuring there aren't any intruders. If there were, I would inform the security guards on site to go and sort it out while I watched.



My shift had started. Today's location was a warehouse operated by the government; the guards here weren't OmniView but military police, about five of them for a location the size of a football field. Shucks. On the screen was a display of each guard on duty, their vital signs as well as their location. I could click on their photos and radio them individually, which made the job easier.



The warehouse wasn't the average warehouse you'd expect- there were racks of not crates, but large rectangle containers with 'Specimen' and a number after it imprinted on the sides. I swore I could see one of those containers moving, but I took it for a visual stutter. It was good that the guards were authorised to talk to me casually; they were nice enough to include me in their conversations as awkward as it was.



I didn't mind the cluttered radio feed. I doubted anything would occur considering it had been two hours since I started and the guards were chill, so I lowered my guard. Until I switched cameras to 'Cargo Bay D'. A cargo container had its doors open, which I was dead sure was closed before. 



I radioed one of the guards nearest to the area.



"Hey, can you check out the Specimen-408 container? The doors are wide open," I talked into the microphone, my eyes darting around the screen in black and white.



"What?" he murmured immediately in a tone that made it seem as if I had just insulted his mother. But it wasn't anger. He starting panicking, uttering swear words in a shaky voice- it was clear he wasn't angry. He was scared.



The way he reacted just made my heart beat faster as I could see a worried look develop on my face, staring into the screen and taking a glimpse at the reflection. He radioed back, this time saying there's been an 'open box event' on the main channel. Abruptly, the warehouse that had been shrouded in darkness was brightly lit in a hellish tint of red as the lights were switched on.



All of the guards grouped up at the entrance of the cargo bay, this time holding their rifles in a ready position, which meant whoever opened that door wasn't going to court. The leader radioed in, telling me to keep surveillance as they popped into view on the camera, basqued in red. At this point, my palms were covered in a layer of sweat as I kept wiping the stream of water on my forehead. It didn't occur to me that it wasn't an intruder that broke in, but it was whatever the warehouse was housing that broke out. 



As the group walked down the pathways of tall racks, disappearing out of view as they escaped the vicinity of the camera, my eyes were wide open staring into the screen. There was an abrupt flicker on the camera feed which made me jump, when suddenly a good portion of the camera was blocked by a black mass as it switched to the next rack. Then it moved, the camera now unobstructed. Realising what it could possibly be, I radioed in, telling them to look behind. Yet as much as I screamed, they didn't seem to register what I was saying. It was as if I was muted by chance.



I witnessed a black mass emerging from behind the group, trailing them. I could just barely make out its shape- it looked like a person, but the lengthy torso and disproportionate arms and legs made me think otherwise. At this point, I was fearing the worst; the mic wasn't registering anything that came out of my mouth and I was frantically trying to solve whatever messed up the comms with my mediocre tech skills. And then it happened.



The entity lurched forward and grabbed one of the guards from behind, its longer arm dragging the poor guy from his neck. With his other arm, he twisted apart his skull, ripping it clean off and placing the disfigured head in its mouth in a rapid movement. I could tell he was screaming before he went out, since the guys ahead erupted in gunfire, shooting at the monstrosity. Blood was pooling up on the cement floor, the containers on the side painted red. In mere seconds, the entity slashed at the group in a repeated manner, left and right, tearing apart the guards like paper. The last victim was left with only his torso, crawling away from death itself. The monster proceeded to grab him by his head, and with its head looking upwards as he put the guard above his mouth, he dropped him into the massive, contorted pit that moments ago were white lips pursed together.



And the moment it was done rampaging, it stood still. Its head gradually turned clockwise, twisting to face the camera-no, me. Its mouth developed into a sharp smile, clearly mocking my state of shock. I snapped out of it and frantically clicked on the 'Compromise' button, keying in my password as the UI prompted if I was sure. As soon as I got it right, the computer shut off. I was staring at my own reflection, realising my face had turned pale, my pupils enlarged to the extent I could see the abyss lying within. I couldn't believe the events that had transpired right in front of me. Was it all some fucked up prank?



A knock came on the door, releasing me out of my stone-like state. Opening the door, I was met by an OmniView employee; reading his nametag, I immediately found out he was a manager.



"Compromised, eh? Lucky you got your shift cut short. Fill up this form and clock out once you're done, I'll be standing outside," he said casually, obviously used to the pale faces of newcomers. 



I filled in whatever info the form wanted and dipped out of there once I handed it in. For a first day, it was rather... eventful. The thing's face was etched in my mind, in the same red that was shrouding it. But the moment the pay came in, which was immediately after I left the building, I really couldn't leave the job. Witnessing visceral, gory visuals was better than lying out and about in the streets. I'll be writing in my more eventful shifts in the future.
