Last night, I saw drones over my neighborhood in new jersey

I swear, this wasn’t some half awake hallucination or the result of me binge watching conspiracy videos on youtube like coast to coast am. I saw drones. Not the kind your neighbor uses to film his fireworks display, these were different. And by different, I mean unsettling. That's the best way I can describe it.

I live in central New Jersey, life is pretty boring here. Most nights, the biggest excitement is deciding between Wawa or QuickChek for food and snacks. But last night… last night was something else. I was walking back from wawa around 10:00 PM. The air was cool and crisp and the sky was mostly clear, with a few clouds here and there.

Then I noticed the lights.

At first, I thought it was a plane. But the movement was… off putting. Planes don’t zigzag. And there wasn’t just one. I counted somewhere around 4-5 lights hovering in an odd formation, like they were… scanning. That’s the best word I can think of. They moved with precision, darting back and forth across the sky, almost too fast for me to keep up.

I froze, standing in the middle of my driveway with a bag of snacks in one hand and my phone in the other. My first thought was to record it, but… you know when something feels so unreal that your brain skips past “document this” and lands on “run inside and lock the door”? Yeah, that was me.

Now here is the strangest part. They made no sound. None. You’d expect a hum or a buzz, even those cheap drones you buy off Amazon sound like mosquitoes. But these.... these were dead silent, gliding through the air like… I don’t know, ghosts? Is that too dramatic? Whatever it was, it made my skin crawl a little. I did eventually grab my phone, fumbling with the camera, but the screen only showed darkness and the lights were too far away or too faint for my phone to pick up. Typical, right? It’s like how UFO footage is always grainy. Maybe there’s something about these things that messes with electronics. Like a jammer or something.

Here’s the thing, they weren’t just aimlessly flying around. They had a purpose. I could feel it. They hovered over the neighborhood for maybe ten minutes, then all at once, they sped off toward the woods behind my street. Gone. Just like that. No trail, no sound, no nothing.

I’ve lived here my whole life. I’ve seen drones before, sure. Sometimes hobbyists fly them at the park or maybe kids messing around with them. But this? This felt organized. Professional. Like someone was searching for something.

I didn’t sleep much last night. Every time I closed my eyes, I’d see those lights, hear the eerie silence of the sky. I’m really on edge, wondering if they’ll come back. What were they searching for? Why here of all places, why New Jersey?

I know what I saw, but I don’t know what it was. And the worst part? I can’t shake the feeling that they saw me too. I’m making sure all my windows are locked and keeping my curtains closed tonight. Just in case.
