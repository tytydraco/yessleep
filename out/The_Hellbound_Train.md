Part 1

Hopping trains was always something I was good at. It was a skill I acquired from a young age. Well, to be honest, I’m not sure if it’s really a skill. It doesn’t matter, either way I loved it. The freedom of riding to an unknown place, and the risk of it. There was so much risk. Falling, getting caught, going somewhere too far away, jumping off, and of course, death. I felt so alive.

Soon it became an addiction. Chasing that high, I didn’t want it. I needed it. Chasing that train. In my journey’s, I got mixed in with some bad groups. My need for risk and chasing that high, it became very literal with the plunge of a needle. Heroin. Dope. Tar. Cinnamon. Sugar. Honey. It tasted so sweet and felt so warm. Chasing that train.

My parents never cared much for me anyway. They were just as doped up as I was. My dad died when I was 15, and my mom married another junkie. Her addictions became worse, and he only supported it. I would leave for weeks at a time, chasing those trains, just to stay away from home. When really I was just finding my way back to the same point. The point of the needle.

Now I’m 23 years old. I’ve been 2 years sober, and I’ve only now gained the courage to share my story.

My favorite way to mix my interests was a practice I called, “Wormholing.” I called it this because I would first begin by hopping on a train. Then I would find a place, dope up, and then wake up in a different location. Just like a wormhole, you go in one end, then you’re in another location before you know it. I told myself it was just fun and games, but really I just wanted to escape. Waking up one state away, it was refreshing, but it couldn’t last forever. Inevitably I’d crawl my way back to my hometown, back to my trailer. 

One day, I wanted to wormhole. Not any normal wormholing though, I wanted to go and never come back. My mother was at the height of her addiction. My step dad was being an asshole as ever. My friends had left me, all to go to college. I had nothing and no one. What I really wanted was to die. I wanted to wormhole but never wake up again. I wouldn’t admit that to myself though. All I could think of was that sweet nectar…

My dealer came by my house. He was a skinny guy who always wore the same stained white tank top. His jeans were green and baggy. His hair was curled and looked ungroomed. He wasn’t an addict though, he was just a seller. It was a unique phenomenon in the drug world. 

“Hey, I got this new stuff. Wanna buy?” He asked me.

“What is it?” I asked, curiosity running through my veins.

“It's a new dope I bought. The high is crazy apparently. You’ll be out for hours. Same price too,” he smiled and pulled out a small bag. Inside it was some brown powder. It looked like cinnamon. 

“Same price?” I wanted to confirm.

“Same price.”

“I’ll take some,” we completed the transaction. I took the small bag from him. I knew I had to wormhole with it. If it was stronger than the other stuff, then who knew where I would end up. 

I showed him to the door and right before he left he turned towards me, “Oh, don’t take as much as you usually do. I’d say half it. It’s way stronger than that other shit I was selling you.”

“Alright, thanks,” I looked around outside. Paranoia, a typical feeling I was experiencing on a regular basis.

I decided that I would hop on a train in 2 days. The schedule was posted online for when the trains went through my town. I was never fully confident on the times, as they were usually early or late and never truly on time. I read that one would go through in 2 days at 12:45 PM, so I decided I would head to the train station an hour early. 

2 Days Later - 11:45 AM

It was a gloomy day. The sky was as gray as the concrete. It was hard to find where the horizon ended or began. The air felt charged and the hair on my arms stood up. I heard thunder churning in the distance. It roared. I counted the time between the sound and the flash of lightning.

“One, two, three, four, five, six-” lightning cracked across the sky. Six miles away. I felt a spec of water hit my cheek. Then I heard the horn of a train.

Thunder again, the rumbling of the train car.

“One, two, three, four, five-” blue light. 

The train horn, the tracks rumbling. I could see the front grates of the train, like a metal beast's jaw. It was coming to swallow me.

Thunder again, “One, two, three, four-” blue light. It was 4 miles away. The red lights of the stop signs were blinking and the warning bells began to ring. I started to jog, the rain began to pick up. What if I slipped and fell? I pushed the thought back and began running faster.

Thunder rumbled again. The rumbling of the train dragged out the roar like the growl of a beast. Its horn blared like a foul bird's call. I counted down this time, “Three, two, ONE!” My feet lifted from the ground, and I lunged towards the ladder of the last container. The rain picked up. Would I make it? My hand made contact with the metal. My right foot slipped, but I held on tight. I was on.

The back container was full of fine gravel and had no top. Perfect. I dug out a small corner of the fine rocks and sat back. It was surprisingly comfy. I dug a big enough section to lay down when the high took hold. Laying on my side would be the best option just in case… 

I sat and thought, “In case of what? What was I doing…?” A tight pit in my stomach formed. I sat in the gravel, feeling the cool rocks with my hands. Specks of water were hitting my face, and the smell of the air was electric. It took me a moment to realize I wasn’t breathing. The aching of my lungs gave way to new air.

I finished setting up, my hole was dug and I had my supplies. The train was rumbling beneath me. I watched as the last buildings of my town passed. It gave way into a forest with the tracks splitting through. It started raining and the gravel beneath me began to soak up the water. A thin film of dirt began to form on every rock that had been covered in dust. It soon occurred to me that I wouldn’t be able to light the flame for my dope. Fuck, maybe another day. I looked up and thought of where I should jump off. Then I saw the tunnel ahead, I had forgotten there was a tunnel. Perfect.

I waited until the darkness of the tunnel enveloped me before heating up the spoon. I had to do it quickly. Tight band. Hot spoon. Pour the cinnamon. Whisk the water. Pick the cotton. The thin needle sucked the ichor in, more than recommended. My chest was tight. The pit returned. Blood. Darkness of the tunnel to the darkness behind my eyelids. Serenity. Extacy. Warmth. 

End of Part 1



Part 2

Red. Then black. A cold touch. Then a warm touch. The cold stones caressing my hand. These stones were soft… like a hand? I jumped up from the ground and puked on the gravel in front of me. My head was spinning. My eyes wouldn’t focus. It took me a moment to realize that it was dark around me. Was it night? No, there’s no stars. Ahead of me I saw a dim light coming closer. I was in a tunnel again. 

I tried to stay still to get my bearings. The world around me was spinning. I wasn’t the only one sitting on the gravel. As my eyes began to adjust, I saw that a woman was looking at me. Her hair was matted, her eyes big and bloodshot, and scabs everywhere. She was staring at me with a toothless grin across her face. Next to her a young man laid on the ground, he was on his side. It soon became apparent that there were at least 20 to 30 other people around me. Some of them were sitting, some standing, some looked confused, some looked doped up, and some were… completely still. The color was drained from her face. A young girl, probably 15 years old. Before I knew it, I was crawling next to her.

“Someone help her!” I yelled. Some people looked over but most just stayed where they were. I grew angry and began to yell more at them. Finally a man looked at me, a scowl was hiding under his matted bloody beard.

He spoke, “She’s dead, son.”

I choked down a pit in my throat. A tear formed in my eye. God, she was so young. I fell back against the wall. The man looked at me again. I looked at his eyes, they were cold and gray.

“What happened?” I looked at her face again, there was foam on her mouth.

The man answered, “Pills probably. If you're dead when you get here, it was probably intentional.” 

“Where am I?” I asked, the weight of his words sat on my shoulders.

He scoffed, “Same place you started son.”

“What the fuck does that mean?” I frowned. I looked down and saw there was a hand poking out of gravel, “what the hell?”

“You got a choice son. You either stay here, or you jump to the cart in front of us,” the man interjected. 

The cold metal of the train cart dug into my back as I laid against it. I asked where I was again, but no one would answer. The train was rumbling beneath us and the gravel began to shift. The young girl, dead on the ground, began to sink into the gravel. The pit opened and began to swallow her. I watched in horror, this had to be a dream. My dealer scammed me obviously. The dope had been laced with acid or some shit. I closed my eyes and dug my head into my knees. 

“Wake up, come on, wake up,” I thought, over and over again. 10 minutes passed, then 30, then an hour. I asked myself, “should I jump ahead?”

The train’s horn sounded ahead of us. It was different than before though. It was more the roar of a beast. A deep menacing sound surrounded us. It sounded like the squeal of a giant pig or boar but not as pitched. I listened closely, there was something else, screaming.

For the first time, there was a shifting of people around me. I looked around and saw the people moving about. Some were putting their hoods up on their jackets, others were taking off their shirts and putting it over their heads. Some stayed still and just kept staring forward. I took my hood and covered myself like the others. 

The older man with the bloody beard stared forward but glanced at me for a moment and simply uttered the word, “Brace.” At that moment the sound of explosions ahead began. Mechanical noises screamed out like people. Saws, drills, a million cogs turning. It felt like the train hit a wall, and I was knocked over. I looked up, there was fire. A smell wafted through the air, it smelled like rancid pork. A sizzling sound. I lifted myself up as I felt rain begin to fall. Except the rain wasn’t cold, it was warm. My pants felt warm, had I pissed myself? No, my pants were red. What the fuck? Around me people were being drenched in thick red blood. There was blood raining down, then the flesh began to fall. A chunk of red flesh fell down with bits of bone. I felt a splinter cut my cheek. The smacking of meat onto the gravel continued. Carnage rained out against us. I realized the walls were changing. The black void of the tunnel gave way to flesh and singed meat. Blood poured, bones cracked, and I saw an eye in the wall look upon me. Fire blazed across the walls, and the walls screamed in return. I saw orifices of flesh open and close, some yelling and some taking in smoke.

“This isn’t real… wake up. WAKE UP! WAKE UP PLEASE!” I screamed. My cries were drowned by the noises around me. I only now realize, no one would have heard me in the twirling chaos of blood around me. It lasted for around 5 minutes. The train would jolt back and forth, knocking me and some of the other passengers from our positions. Blood went in my mouth, and I puked more. Bits of bones and gravel dug their way into my hands, smoke filled my lungs with the wretched smell of butane and rotted pig flesh. This was Hell, and I was paying for my sins. 

Finally the carnage stopped. I sat up from my new position and attempted to focus on my surroundings. There was another man looking around frantically. I hesitated but finally asked, “Where am I?”

“No idea, but they said we can move forward. You want to come?” He said surprisingly calmly. His hand was outstretched, offering to lift me up.

With some reluctance I grabbed it and lifted myself up with his help. I looked at the people around me, and their gazes all met mine for the first time. I hadn’t realized how tired they all looked, their eyes bloodshot and dry. Nodding at the man, I began to follow him. A dry hand grabbed mine causing me to flinch. Grabbing my hand was the older lady from before, her big eyes were looking at me with a smile across her face. She nodded her head. I remember feeling some comfort in that smile, even through there was blood that dripped down from her matted hair. 

The man tapped my shoulder and began walking forward. I watched as he climbed over the front edge of the compartment. He stood with impeccable balance before leaping to the ladder on the metal trailer ahead. He began to climb down before opening a metal latch. The door slid open and revealed a creeping darkness from within. A hesitation grew over me, but I soon found myself facing the void ahead. I leaped forward, my feet hitting the metal ground. Darkness enveloped, the groaning of pain, the groaning of old rusted metal, and the stench of shit and piss, rotted meat, mold, sweat, and God knows what else. 

The man grabbed a lantern on the ground. The light flickered on. Ahead was only pain and pleasure. I watched as a sea of naked corpses all crawled upon each other. Their skin was rotted, some of their limbs had fallen off as they ripped themselves along one another. The whirling of bodies gave off the stench of sex. I watched a woman grab another woman and force her face onto hers. Their teeth clashed and broke, but they only moaned. Some of their bodies were stitched together, healed together, conjoined. The train hit a bump, and I watched as the ball of flesh was knocked around. The dead only screamed more as I heard bones crack and flesh slosh. Despite their heinous movements, the people collectively moved together. The heaping pile of flesh moved in a wave like motion of pleasure. 

My eyes met the man next to me, they were full of fear. I believe in that moment we both shut off what was ahead of us, we simply couldn’t handle it. We walked over to a corner. He sat against the cleanest part of the wall. His new found lamp illuminated the ground beneath me as he sat the only source of light by his side. I looked down at my boots, they were covered in filth. A bug, or at least something that looked like a bug, skittered across the floor. I found the only other spot that looked at least somewhat clean and sat down. In the faint glow, I saw the whites of his eyes. He spoke, “My name is James by the way…”

Another bump. The darkness ahead of us slithered and hissed with rapture. I looked ahead into the gaping void, catching only glimpses of a face, a woman's breast, and a man’s genitals, and a mix of bodily fluids. I remembered the man looking at me and continued, “Oh… I- uh. My names Samuel, or Sam.”

Introductions completed, we sat in the darkness for a while longer. A million thoughts raced through my mind, but I did not dare speak one of them. That would have made everything all too real. For a moment I found solace as I felt the train rumbling beneath my body. The roaring of the tracks drowned out the sounds of the hundreds of bodies crunching against each other.

The small moment of silence that I found within myself was interrupted by James, “What was the last thing you remember? You know… before all of this…”

The images flashed in my head. I remembered the drugs draining from the syringe. I remembered the pinch of the needle and the warmth of my body. I remembered…

“I… I remember laying in the back of this train. I’m a dope head,” I hesitated telling this person I had never met. I pushed back the hesitation though and continued, “I was trying to kill myself.”

He looked at his hands and began picking at his nail, “I’m not a druggy, but I also tried to end it,” he obviously didn’t mind telling me. I was kind of surprised to be honest. I struggled facing myself in my decision to end my life. This man had no problem telling me at all. He continued, “I think we’re in Hell, or something like that.”

“Yeah,” the only word that could come out of my mouth. I looked at him and he smiled awkwardly. We glanced at each other from time to time. I noticed he had scars on his arms. They were old but there were a lot of them. On his left arm there was one that ran deeper than the others, it looked new. I looked down at my own arm, the track marks riddled over each other. There was one that reigned above all the others, the one that had gotten me to that place.

The train hit another bump. Hell and its creations became all too real, and the mound of bodies began to climb over to us. I jumped up and stood against the wall. James followed this and we both watched as the hands of hundreds or maybe even thousands began to crawl towards us. Their nails scraped the floor, the walls, and the ceiling. As the drew closer I realized how large the room was, there was no way this many people could fit into the compartment we climbed in. 

James grabbed my shoulder, “Fuck man. What should we do?”

I turned and looked at the door behind us. It was the only exit I could see, in front of us was a cork of flesh and misery. James' eyes filled with fear as he looked around the room, nowhere to go, only the rusted metal of the train. Knowing my only options, I rushed towards the door. Pulling it open, I felt a rush of heat from the outside and the smell of sulfur. The ladder was in front of me. I turned my head, but I didn’t meet James’ eyes. Instead I watched as he started walking towards the mound.

The smell of fruit glided across the air, masking the sulfuric burns in my nose. I knew James could smell it too, he was heading towards the source. At the front of the pile was a single beautiful woman. Her blonde hair hung down long, and her eyes glistened. Her lips were red and plump like a sweet apple. Only her bottom half was a limb of the monster. James began to undress as he walked to her. She reached out. 

In a flash, the bodies collected another. They formed a cone with the woman at the tip. She grabbed James, lifted him above her with ease, and pushed him into the others. He became another in a sea of sensation. As the bodies rolled over each other, grasping for their new extension, I noticed a small gap in their side. Without a thought, I ran straight to it.

Fruit, vanilla, yeast, cinnamon, sugar, milk, honey. Milk and honey. Milk and honey. Milk and honey. The sweet concoction of smells enticed every sense. I could smell it, taste it, feel it, hear it, and even see it. The fruit of pleasure… The fruit of lust.

I don’t remember entirely what happened as I squeezed my way through the gap. I just remember the sensations, the smells, and the lust I felt in that moment. I wanted to be a part of it, yet one foot landed in front of the other. One foot on the metal, another might slip, but my hand grasped the final metal bar. I slipped out of the container. The familiar rumbling sound beneath my feet brought me back. I had made it to the end of cart two.
