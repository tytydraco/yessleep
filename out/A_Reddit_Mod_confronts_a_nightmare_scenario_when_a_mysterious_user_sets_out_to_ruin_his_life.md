The main character is a reddit mod for the Egypt sub, he is the most popular mod around but he has one obsession, removing irrelevent threads. For him it was about the rules, because without rules there is no purpose to life. And it worked, because the sub was doing great, getting more members and everyone followed the rules... until one redditor showed up. Everyone knew there was something weird about /u/analtuesdays but no one expected what he was about to do. He did not follow the rules. He spammed it with content that few appreciated least of whom was egypt's favorite mod. Each day his morning routine became to delete a new thread by /u/analtuesday. He could've banned him, but he didn't break the rules in an obvious way and he wasn't about to make an exception. All that could be done now is remove the spam. Days and weeks past by until he woke up to read a new thread titled "EAT MY HOTDOGS! TUESDAY SPECIAL!". That was the last straw. Options menu, Mod tools, click ban. It was done, he jumped straight back to bed, and slept so soundly like never before in weeks. No more analtuesdays. But what he didn't know was who analtuesdays knew. 

Furious about the ban, analtuesday picks up the phone and calls a friend. "They ban me? We will see about that". The next day, the mod stares at the screen in horror. PAGE NOT FOUND. Reddit the center of all things knowledge was banned. Friends tried to console him, "Its alright dont take it personally, its not the end of the world, they didnt just ban reddit but medium too, its just the way things are now, its the rules." 

He couldn't sleep, his life changed in an instant. But maybe change needed to happen anyway, its been long since he done something else. He started going out more and seeing more people. There was an emptiness though, things didn't feel right, there were no clear rules in the real world. Walking back home, he stumples on a gang throwing trash everywhere. They shout "LOOK THE STREETS ARE DIRTY, CLEAN IT UP SISI!" The mod looked at them in dismay, holding back his anger. Its the way of the world nothing could be done. 

Then at the corner of his eyes, a beautiful young woman rushed up to the gang from across the street. She humliated them. They get closer, but step back once they see her holding a phone ready to make a call. Before they leave they tell her  "People like you are cursed". The mod was impressed, he knelt beside her to help clean the trash and they locked eyes. They would hold hands everywhere, eat together and share their deepest feelings. She shared stories about her past and he told her how he used to be a mod and how his father died when he was just kid. She was the present and the future, reddit was a distant memory and things have turned out better than he imagined. At the diner table at a new restaurant they been meaning to check, he took the order for both of them. There was a TV screen on the side. The mod was listening to her talk about her worries, her singing career wasn't going as well as expected. "It will all be fine, I will always be there with you" he tells her. Then the TV screen flashed breaking news headline: "REDDIT IS BACK". He looked on wistfully, but turned his attention back to her soon after. That was the past. That night, alone in his room, standing far from the computer. Searching for a distraction, he picks up empty soda cans and throws them in the trash. Is that all I am? He jumps back to his room and onto his computer, he logs in. Is there spam? Time to remove it! And then it hit him like a brick. In order for Reddit to be back in Egypt, a sacrifice had to be made. The admins banned the Egypt sub. Oh God.

Not just that. The user /u/analtuesdays is now mod of the Arabs sub, a sub that now served as defacto sub for Egyptians and arabs alike. "HOTDOGS NOW, GET IT WHILE ITS GOOD!" were posts all over it. He checks out the posts, as it turns out analtuesdays has recently started a hotdog company thats taking egypt by storm. "TUESDAY SPECIAL! YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT!" Oh well, the mod sends him a message, apologizing for mistaking his posts to be lascivious that now he feels what its like to be banned by mistake. He got a reply instantly, "Apology Accepted! Oh and by the way, the ban of your sub was no mistake, who you think did it dumb dumb? You don't mess with my hotdogs!" The mod grabs a trashcan and empties it madly all over the house, then throws it at the mirror shattering it into pieces. That motherfucker! 

"Why you look shaken up?" She asks him at the diner table. Should he tell her? What use will that serve. He began relaxing a bit as the night progressed. All that mattered now was his relationship. "So I was thinking, now that reddit is back and you are a mod, what about promoting my work there? A good word from you will mean a lot. And who knows some manager might see it." He was about to say it was against the rules, but then he remembered he wasn't a mod of any sub anymore. He couldn't break her heart, "I will see what i can do." But in reality he wasn't planning on doing anything. Time passed and friends been noticing a strange thing about him, always being distracted by something in his head. 

He couldn't get over it. It lurked there in his mind spoiling all joy in his life. He did all kinds of research on how the sub was banned and what links there were between analtuesday and the goverment entity that enacted the ban. He learned the goverment hired a secretive subcontractor to do it, led by a guy who also has shares in the hotdog company. Could it be analtuesday? He wanted to snap out of it before it started affecting his relationship, the one thing he has left. He sends her a ton of messages promising her hes going to change, his sole focus will be their relationship and that he thinks its time to get married. She didn't answer back. Whats going on? Dejected he logs in on reddit again, and sees a post by his girlfriend promoted to the top in the Arab sub. How did she do that? He rushes to find her at her apartment, only to find her on the side walk waiting for a car. He leapt to catch her until he saw a black mercedes park in front of her, doors opened and man in black suit and sunglasses steps outside to kiss her and open the door for her. She smiles and eagerly gets into the car. The man in suit closes the door, and for a moment looks at the mod with a smirk. Then goes back to the driving seat and they drive off. 

Darkness. He steps into a gun shop. The owner was an army friend of his father back during the war, the same war that took his father's life. He was happy to see him. "You look just like him!" were the shop owner's first words. "Your father was a real asshole, everytime I tried to desert the battlefield, he would drag me right back! He sure saved stupid little me then." The mod asked for guns, and the owner led him inside to a door in the back. He flicked on the light switch and a whole weird array of weapons appeared on cushioned walls in a hi-tech room. They were something he never seen before. "You see, those arent your normal kind of guns. Pulse guns, lasers, plasma charger, the guns of the future. Developed by the Egyptian and the Israeli military but found no use for it after the war." 

He grabs one of the wall, "You gonna like this one, a Voice-operated Laser, you don't need to aim to hit your target, just shout out commands. A house intruder? just shout it! But first I want to know what you want this for?" The mod didn't mince words, "Revenge".  The owner takes one good look at the mod, then abruptly puts the gun back and turns off the extra overhead lights. It was dim now. "Revenge is stupid. You know why your father died? Because of revenge. The war turned him mad. And now you want the same thing? Get out of my store." The mod didn't hesitate, and just walked off to the exit doors. As he opened the door to the street and was about to step outside, he heard "Wait". The owner stood stern in the middle of the shop and said "I got something for that."  In a dusty dark room full of old boxes, the owner opens one to take out a weapon. "A knife?" the mod uttered in disbelief. "Not just any knife". As he held the combat knife in the palm of his hands, it began to disappear. "Its an invisible knife. If revenge is what you want, then nothing hurts more than dying from something you can't see."
