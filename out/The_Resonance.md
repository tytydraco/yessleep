Dad pulled the station wagon out of the driveway and turned right towards the expressway a few miles down the road. Before we fell over the rise of the hill I looked back at our home tucked behind the old oak and maple trees. It was Mom and Dad’s dream. A small part of an old estate in the Philadelphia suburbs lined up along the cliffs of the Schuylkill river. They finished building it eight years ago, but it was made to look like it had been there for over a hundred.

I loved it. I loved the stone, the high windows, the interlocking rooflines. I loved the trees that caged it in, and the gardens that flowed into the surrounding woods.

Dad was driving too fast for my liking. He usually drove too fast. They were running late, but he would have driven like this even if they had plenty of time. Mom thought they had gotten a normal grocery getter last year, Dad left out that it was faster than most sports cars.

“The sleeper to slay all the showboats.” his Dad would say proudly… and often. I would have preferred a normal version to just read a book and not get carsick.

Leaving the winding road we pulled onto the expressway. Traffic. Always traffic here. The river forced the roadbuilders to twist the asphalt ribbon into a polygraph readout, but drivers still treated it like an interstate in Oklahoma.  

Three weeks. It had been three weeks already.

It first happened on the weekend before my fourteenth birthday. Waking up at three in the morning with sharp pains running from my chest to toes. Wave after wave of acid burning my bones and muscle from the inside. The only thing worse than the pain was the terror.

My parents dream of the shrieks that pulled them from their bed and had them running to my room. They hadn’t told me, but I overhead Mom telling her sister last week when they were talking about rescheduling the canceled birthday party…

“Hmmm… well shoot, glad we aren’t in that.”

Dad was pointing across the barrier to the lanes heading west out of town. A massive pile-up had closed down half the lanes, emergency vehicles were driving against traffic to get to the scene. It looked gnarly. A few cars were on their side, one was on its roof…

“Yeesh… well let’s not rubberneck” Dad said.

We both rubbernecked, as did everyone else. Thus, traffic.

After driving past hundreds of vehicles parked going the other way for a few minutes we got off the expressway. A few turns later we were pulling into a parking garage below the Children’s Hospital. I didn’t like the idea of being at a “children’s” hospital, I should be at a regular hospital now, that I’m fourteen. But it was what it was.

Parking the car we headed for the elevator bank, rising straight to the third floor where the medical imaging department was located.

“Today, is probably going to be one of the worst days of my life Dad” I said softly.

“Worse than the nights you’ve woken up with the pain?” Dad asked.

The “pain” is what we called it now. An explanation of debilitation. A one word summary of whatever force was wreaking havoc on my skeleton. The “pain” had quickly become my family’s way of describing horror.

“Hmmm… Probably not, but I’m allowed to have second and third places aren’t I?”

Dad laughed. He really laughed. He belly laughed. He laughed until he cried, and the tears were of joy. Dad really needed that laugh. And I was the one that gave it to him.

We walked out of the elevator and straight to reception. They were waiting for us. I was a sort of celebrity here with everyone curious as to what was wrong with me. In addition to the MRI techs, a couple of my doctors had carved out time to see the scans come out in real time.

Time became mechanical. Dad was signing papers, confirming insurance, chatting idly with the old receptionist that doubled as everyone’s grandmother or great aunt.

Before I knew it I was changing into my umpteenth hospital gown, putting my feet into disposable slippers, walking down a long hallway. The larger of the two techs held the door open for me and then him and his partner helped me up onto the platform that I would be laying on for the next hour or so. They put my legs into braces and strapped me in. And then some more braces for my arms…

My breathing was getting shallower…. Faster.

Dad saw my face and took my hand, attached to an arm I couldn’t move. “It’s going to be alright Brad… it’s going to be alright…”

He was able to give me a smile, and I smiled back.

“I can do it. I have to. Did you give them my playlist?”

“I emailed it in last night, it will get you through.”

“Thanks Dad,” I said. And I meant it. I was so grateful he was here with me.

The technicians finished up their preparations and let us know it was time. Dad had to go back to the waiting room outside.

“I love you son, you are going to be just fine, maybe this will help them figure out the pain… I love you more than you will ever know…” Tears were forming in the corner of his green eyes. He wiped them away with a small sniff and hugged me as I lay strapped down. “I’ll be right outside. These men will keep you safe… I’ll be right outside…”

And with that he walked slowly to the waiting room, turning to wave and put a fist over his heart before going to find a chair in a corner to weep. Dad was an emotional man and wasn’t afraid to show it, but he wanted to appear strong for me.

“Ya ready?” The tech asked me.

“I’m ready” I replied.

“Cool, I’m going to put these headphones on you, you’ll hear your music, but it won’t drown out the sounds of the machine. I’ll be honest wit ya, this here beauty… I call her Big Bertha… she can wail. And by wail I mean she needs a lot of energy to do what she does… and that energy comes out *haaard*. It’s gonna sound weird, sometimes it will sound spooky, a lot of the times she is just plain annoying… But we gonna get through this ya hear?”

Looking up at him I could only nod my head.

“Good, you got this. And we all got you. In your hand I’m putting an emergency button. Press it, and we can stop the test. Just know we might have to do it over again if you press…”

And with that he put on the headphones and turned a lever. The platform started to slowly move into the middle of the machine. The hole reminded me of the inside of penne pasta… it was not a big hole.

I was a small kid, shorter than all of my friends. When the platform came to a stop in the middle of the MRI machine there was a couple of feet to the openings above and below me. This might be worse than the pain.

The music coming through my headphones cut out. It was replaced by the tech telling me that a series of sounds was about to begin. If I could, try sleeping…. Who could sleep in this?

BAAAAAAAA… BAAAAAAAA… BAAAAAAAA… UHHHHHMMMMM… UHHHHHMMMMM…

The noises were shockwaves. I had read somewhere that the sonar on submarines was powerful enough to kill whales… is this what that felt like?

Before I could think about it the noises changed to a what could best be described as a machine gun laser. Pulses that reached into the middle of stomach and shot around my insides. I had to focus on the music…

I didn’t think I was claustrophobic but after thirty or forty minutes my entire body was screaming to move. I was starting to hyperventilate. My playlist couldn’t do anything to push away the feeling of being crushed in this hole… this terrible, terrible, hole.  

HMMMHHHMM… HMMMHHHMM… HMMMHHHMM… HMMMHHHMM….

PHHHHHHTTTTTPPP…. PHHHHHHTTTTTPPP…. PHHHHHHTTTTTPPP….

It just kept going and going and going and going.

…. I pushed the button. I didn’t care if we had to do it all over again. I couldn’t keep going on….

The music didn’t stop.

The machine didn’t stop.

The noises didn’t stop.

The noises did not stop.

Panicking I squeezed the emergency button over and over again. I started to yell. I started to try and kick my legs, move my arms. I couldn’t move anything but my head. I was trapped. My brain was about to explode.

I lifted my head up to look back out the hole from where I had entered this torture chamber. The tech was there. Grabbing at my feet. Trying to reach me. Trying to pull me out.

He was yelling at me. He sounded afraid. It made me even more afraid. I couldn’t hear the words, but it was obvious that something had gone wrong. I was stuck. I was stuck in this world of noise and fear.  

Suddenly he stopped grabbing for me. He turned towards the doorway and even from inside the machine I could see the terror in his eyes. He reached out his arms to stop something…

My Dad tackled him like a missile out of nowhere. In a flash both the tech and my Dad were gone… and I was left alone… again.

A few minutes later I was able to twist my head enough to see through the hole behind me. I wish I hadn’t. Oh… oh… I wish I hadn’t.

A pair of mangled arms attached to a bloodied body was reaching down the hole trying to grab at me. It was the second tech. His arms ripped to shreds, but he was still trying to help me, maybe rescue me…?

After a minute or so the tech pulled back his arms and put his head in the hole.

What had been the tech was replaced with something… something else. Shredded skin. One eye dangling, holding on by a single nerve. A dislocated jaw, biting… biting… He wasn’t trying to rescue me. He was trying to eat me.

The music didn’t stop.

The machine didn’t stop.

The noises didn’t stop.

The noises did not stop.

Hyperventilating furiously now, I looked at the other opening only to see Dad… Except it wasn’t Dad, not anymore. He had a hole in his neck and chest and his arms were torn to bits. His eyes were glass. His mouth twisted. He was more snapping turtle than human.

He was reaching. Reaching for me. Reaching to pull me out of the machine.

It wasn’t because he was my father. It wasn’t because he loved me… It was because we were both trapped. Trapped here with me not being able to move, and Dad trapped by his urge to kill me… he couldn’t stop…

The music didn’t stop.

The machine didn’t stop.

The noises didn’t stop.

The noises did not stop.
