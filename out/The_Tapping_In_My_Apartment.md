I awoke suddenly, hair soaked in sweat and underarms drenched. I sat up in the pitch black darkness of my bedroom. 

Confused, I squinted my eyes and strained my ears, trying to find what awoke me. I'm a heavy sleeper, so when I wake up, it's not something I tend to brush off.

Seconds later, I identified what the disturbance must have been. Short, incessant taps coming from the other side of the wall behind me.

I craned my neck to try and get a better idea of what exactly I was listening to. Was it the apartment settling? A part of me wanted to believe this to be true. But something about those taps just felt too...deliberate. 

I irritably hopped out of bed with a thump, the old floorboards creaking under my weight. Upon doing this, however, the tapping stopped. I tried listening, praying the sound would return but it never did.

I was certain now, that the sound I heard hadn't been the house. Someone, or something, had been making those tapping noises intentionally, and now they were listening.

I was apprehensive about making another move, as I all of a sudden felt an unmistakable feeling of being watched. Studied. As if my every move was being carefully monitored from a place I couldn't see.

I glanced over at my window, and far off into the distance, under the faint glow of a streetlight, I saw nothing. 

"Damn wimp," I muttered to myself. "Gotta stop watching those scary movies so late into the night." 

I got up out of my bed, made my way over to the window, and closed my curtains tight, ensuring no space of the window remained uncovered.

To my horror, however, that feeling of being watched did not disappear. If anything, it grew stronger. As if closing the curtains entrapped me with this presence in a far more intimate manner.

Knowing I had to find a way to overcome this feeling of dread eventually, I decided to relieve myself before going back to bed and trying to fall asleep.

I made my way to the bathroom, turning on every light I could to give myself peace of mind. As I stepped into the bathroom however, the feeling of impending doom only grew. Except this time, I felt I could sense where this feeling was originating.

Call it a "sixth sense" or call it an aggressive intuation, I felt an unknown attraction to a certain part of the bathroom.

The mirror.

As I looked at my own reflection with my eyes droopy and exhausted, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. The feeling that somehow, I wasn't the only one looking at me in this mirror.

I don't know what possessed me to do it, but before I could think, my hands were moving, slowly, toward the edge of the mirror.

As my hands got closer, my mind screamed at me to stop. To turn around. To leave the apartment. In that moment, however, my body didn't listen.

I curled my fingers around the sides of the mirror, and in one swift motion, I ripped it off the wall...

I don't remember running, or grabbing my car keys and phone, or even stumbling down the stairs.

The next thing I know, I'm in my car, my hands shaking uncontrollably as I peel out of the apartment parking lot at full speed. My fingers dialed the numbers instinctively before my brain even had a chance to form a coherent thought. 

The next thing I know, a voice permeates the dead silence.

"911 what's your emergency?"

"Hello?"

"Hello? Is anyone there?"

"There's..." My voice raspy, out of breath, and filled with terror. 

"There's people in my walls. Please send help."
