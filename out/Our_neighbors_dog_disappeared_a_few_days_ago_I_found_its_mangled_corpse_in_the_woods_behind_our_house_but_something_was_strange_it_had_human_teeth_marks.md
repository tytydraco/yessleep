I dreaded telling my neighbor that Sparky had gone. But finding his mangled body in the woods behind our house left me disturbed, confused...and frightened.

Sparky had been a fixture in our neighborhood for years, faithfully following me home from school with his buoyant gait and lolling tongue. His exuberant spirit brought joy to our street and laughter to all who encountered him.

So when he went missing, we immediately began searching. My neighbor posted fliers offering a reward while residents combed the nearby woods and fields, calling Sparky's name. But he remained missing.

Then, one afternoon, I came across Sparky's remains among the trees. Or what was left of him. His body lay torn and broken, flesh ripped from bone, fur saturated with blood.

The wounds did not look like the work of an animal. The tears in his flesh were jagged and misshapen. Crouching low, I studied the mangled corpse and that's when I saw the bite marks. Deep gouges in Sparky's ribs bore the unmistakable imprint of human teeth. Some from dislocated jaws, the grooves cut at odd angles.

Revulsion rose within me but I refused to acknowledge the horrifying truth taking form in my mind. Such nightmares could not exist in reality, I told myself.

I trembled as I walked down the familiar street towards my neighbor's home, reliving the gruesome sights and sounds that haunted my waking moments. Sparky's usually cheerful bark now seemed a faint memory, replaced by the horrible image of his torn body splayed lifelessly among fallen leaves caked with crimson.

The normally festive decorations adorning my neighbor's front porch now seemed garish and out of place, painfully oblivious to the ghastly truth I alone knew. With shaking hands, I rang the doorbell and steeled myself to reveal the grim fate of their beloved family pet.

As my neighbor's face fell and tears welled in their eyes upon hearing my stuttering account, I recalled in vivid Technicolor the mangled corpse and those human-like bite marks gouging Sparky's flesh. The raised welts around the ripped tissue had oozed a tarry fluid as flies began circling the remains.

That night, I tossed and turned amid feverish dreams of jagged jaws tearing into soft flesh. I saw Sparky struggling helplessly in the grip of monsters with huge snarling mouths ringed with jagged teeth stained reddish-brown. Their eyes burned with an insatiable hunger that cared nothing for the light fading from his friendly brown eyes. But by morning, I half-convinced myself I'd imagined them. The memory remained, though, growing ever more vivid with each step as I walked to school.

After a long day filled with solemn posters bearing Sparky's cheerful face and somber conversations in hushed tones, I noticed the news of Billy Crenshaw's disappearance spreading through the neighborhood like a miasma. Our smiles faded as grim possibilities took shape in our minds. He had last been seen riding his bike near the woods where I'd found Sparky's corpse.

The next morning I hurried back into the woods, retching at the putrid smell of death now emanating from Sparky's remains. Maggots writhed beneath his matted fur as flies hummed their gruesome song of decay. There I found evidence too horrific to fully comprehend, images that would forever haunt my mind. My eyes were drawn to deep gouges in the earth made by clawed feet, leading into the sinister shadows beyond. 

The truth was undeniable now. Nightmares do exist, hiding in plain sight. Though I prayed they hadn't noticed me, their hunger only grew. Something had watched as I found Sparky's body that day. I dared not speak of it anymore, no one believed such monsters walk among us. The missing boy's parents called me insane, but I saw those bite marks, felt that cold malice lurking in the trees.

The shadows seemed to claw nearer each night. I locked my doors, drew the shades. But what good were walls against jaws that crunch bone?

I tried not to imagine Sparky's, -and possibly Billy's- final moments, the agony of being torn apart while still alive. If something so cruel prowled these streets, no one was safe. It was only a matter of time before another went missing, before another mangled body was found.

And with chilling certainty, I knew next time it would be me.
