**I don't know if I should be glad or wary with this opportunity that I've got myself here. perhaps I should be rather cautious, for my eyes have been deceiving me from the second I set foot in this building - maybe this device isn't real, and nobody will ever receive my cry for help. if you do, however, see this, then I ask of you to read carefully, do not open past eleven pm and do not, under any circumstances, give in to what you may start hearing.**


oh, god. hi. I don't know how to start this, and I know this may be confusing to stumble upon if it actually does publish, but I have to tell someone, anyone, what has been haunting me for the past months. 
it started so innocently, truly. i would be staring ahead of me, onto a busy road out the window, or a calming pond in the middle of nowhere, and I'd start hearing this sound of crickets, or seeing butterflies all around me. these things never lasted long and would always disappear as quickly as they came. it wasn't anything I would see as a threat, I'd never before experienced hallucinations and didn't think anything of it. must of been the boredom or loneliness that finally got to me.
after just a few weeks, though, the butterflies started dropping dead right by my shoes, or I'd hear a scream in the distance, so far away, yet so close at the same time.

only when I started hearing knocks at my windows late into the night, and started seeing, things, in the mirrors, did I think to contact a professional.
I got weird looks from strangers constantly, and during class, I'd often see a large group of people facing their backs towards me, pointing at the library. 
finally, I was able to get medicated, and the mind tricks went away. I could sleep with ease again, I stopped hearing those god-awful screams and stopped seeing those freaky library nerds! life was easy now, without those distractions. 
I felt good about myself and decided it was time i picked up a job again because that had been too hard to combine with school. not now, though, it was insanely quiet in my head now, and i needed the distraction. 

I had long forgotten about the delusions by the time i was offered a job at the local library, and didn't question it when i was asked if i'd mind doing a late shift - in hindsight, what kind of fucking library would be open 24/7 - on the weekends. 
it paid well, better than the earlier shifts and i had always been more of a night person anyway, so of course i agreed without hesitation. a perfect job, a perfectly manageable schedule, and good money. almost seemed to good to be true, ha!
 
anyway, uhm, the person that showed me around didn't say much, I remember thinking she was crazy, when she finally did, though. she told me something about a mirror behind the desk. told me to never turn my back towards it or take off the blanket, shielding the piece of antique. I wish I had taken that serious because, the second I turned my back towards it on my first shift, I started hearing whispers from behind me that seemed to be muffled by something.
I waved it off at the time, turned my music louder, and eventually I must have even dozed off, as i remember abruptly being awoken by a scream. 

'Hey, lady,' a voice spoke, quickly followed by the sound of fingers being snapped. 
My name, I heard my name, it kept getting repeated, and it kept getting louder. It hurt.
I looked up and smiled at the voice, looking up. for a split second, I could swear I saw a faceless thing, but when I blinked, it was a perfectly normal teenage boy. 

the boy scared me, even though I could easily take him: he looked lanky and disoriented, but that faceless thing was all I could see as I led him towards the history books he'd asked for.
I still heard my name, but it was distant now, as if it was scared of this boy, too.

I do not remember the rest of that day.

I remember walking to the library. I remember that the faceless people returned, always pointing at the library. I remember the library. 

I remember 
 I don't 

I remember, I know that he's back

I've seen you before
I remember you



It's back, ,,, .
