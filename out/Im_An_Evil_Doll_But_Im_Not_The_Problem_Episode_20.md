
How things got all liminal

I’ve done a lot of complaining about the various issues that come with being in my situation. To be fair, I think I’ve earned it. It's not like the universe has used kid gloves on me lately. 

Not having to eat is a pretty big boon. Hell, I’m sure a few of you out there would make a poorly thought out deal for something like that. It’s a z-list superpower but a superpower none the less. 

Except for me, right now it isn’t. I get to keep walking on, just fine, as 3 of my friends waste away. 

Leo stumbles, nearly fainting, nothing but empty calories and caffeine in his system. 

“You okay?” Mike asks. 

Leo vomits, it’s a literal technicolor yawn. Colors too artificial to be digested hit the yellowing linoleum. Streaks of pale blood run through the liquid, my heart sinks. 

We go room to room, our path being decided by Kaz and Hyve. They religiously write down their findings, and discuss it among themselves in a handful of languages. 

The rest of us, just have to trust them and hope this isn’t the blind leading the blind. 

“How are you dealing with this so well?” Alex asks Mike. 

“When you get a bit older and want to forget about all of this, you’re going to find out about a little thing called alcoholism. 

Let’s just say, historically, I’m used to letting the old murder machine run on fumes.” Mike rambles. 

 He can say what he wants. The man is pale enough to be almost blue, his skin starting to develop small lesions from lack of nutrients. 


We set up camp in an animation themed room. Silence rolls in like a fog. Exhaustion , desperation and fear sucking away our energy. 

Those noises, the unseen things haven’t been getting closer. At first it seemed like a positive thing, but the longer we go on, the more I think they’re just watching us, toying with us. Waiting for us to be desperate or weak enough to be easy prey. 

“So, let’s hear it. “ Leo says to Kaz and Hyve. 

“We’ve narrowed it down to two possible types of non-Euclidian architecture. Based on how you three are faring, neither of us think we have time to narrow it down further.” Hyve says grimly. 

“I never thought I’d hate Skittles.” Alex laments, throwing a half finished package to a far corner of the room. 

“If we guess correctly, we may be out in time for you three. If not…” Kaz doesn’t  finish the dire summation. 

“Doesn’t seem like we have much of a choice.” Is Leo’s reply. 

Silence gives it’s opinion for the next few minutes. 

“If we’re about to die, how do we make it as shitty as possible for Wild Bill Hicockface? What about those objects that are supposed to be here? Not expecting anyone else to feel the same, but I’d rather go out opening the ark of the covenant or something than starving to death. “ Mike says. There’s a terrible noise from his stomach and his abdominal muscles seize for a moment. 

“The way this place is made, most of the rooms are, for lack of a better term, filler. Made to distract, possibly even harm further in. And telling which is which, will be difficult. 

But should we come across something of note, well, there’s a reason these kinds of things are kept under such…zealous security.” Hyve says. 

“Tomorrow we follow your best guess then.” Leo’s tone is defeated. 

“We need to shake the bad morale. Truth or dare?” Mike says with a lopsided grin. 

“Shut-up.” Leo replies. 

Sveta laughs. 

“Holy crap, that’s the first noise she’s made today. 

You up for a game?” Mike offers. 

“Why not?” Sveta replies with half an eye roll. 

“Truth or dare?” Mike challenges. 

“Truth…keep it PG.” Sveta answers. 

“How old are you?” Mike asks. 

Sveta’s eyebrow raises. 

“Let’s say, a bit away from middle aged.” Sveta replies. 

“What she means to say is she was born some time around 500 A.D.” Hyve injects with surprising humor. 

“No shit?” I blurt out. 

For a moment she looks uncomfortable. 

“He’s in the ballpark. “ Sveta admits, “Okay, Hyve, truth or dare?” 

“Let’s be fair, truth.”  Hyve says. 

“Why’d you leave the void?” Sveta asks. 

The mood begins to lighten, as much as is possible anyway. 

“I cared about someone. 

Someone below my station. Over the years that care turned to love. 

Eventually I realised that no matter how much power we both attained in the void, eventually I’d be in a situation where it would be to my benefit to harm them. 

I couldn’t do that, and so we both came here. Gave up the majority of our influence and power. And things were good, for a long time.” Hyve explains, “Michael, truth or dare?” 

Mike smiles, “Dare would be a lame choice for me, wouldn’t it? Truth, make it a good one.”

“How did you find Kaz’s friend in your skull?” Is Hyve’s question. 

“We crossed paths for a decade or so, a regrettable decade. I’m not his friend. ” Kaz interjects. 

We laugh. The sound sparse and stunted. 

I’ve experienced a lot of supernatural phenomena. But the twisted wartime bonding that was happening was a force no demon could hope to emulate. 

“Demi? Not sure, when I woke up in this blender of a reality he was there. 

We got along for a while, made quite the pair, actually. Till I found out who he was. 

We stopped some very bad things from happening to a lot of people. And for doing this, we were rewarded. 

I had a choice to make, go home and leave him with a new body, or, fuck us both over. 

You’ve met me, you know what I picked. Save the world all you want, you’re Jack the ripper, asshole. You don’t get a happy ending. 

Since then, we don’t talk so much.” Mike says. 

“Kaz, truth or dare.” Leo challenges, his tone a bit darker than the rest of us. 

“Why not be the odd one out, Dare.” Kaz responds. 

“Make us two doses of Valhalla.” What Leo says is lost on me, but Kaz looks shocked, and a little offended. 

“My gods. Trust the hunter to turn things to blood and sacrifice.” Kaz says, shaking his head. 

“What’s Valhalla?” I ask. 

“Five minutes of immortality.” Leo says simply. 

“Followed by a horrid death, and nothing left to move on to the afterlife.” Kaz warns. 

The mood begins to sour. 

“If you wanted to opt out, you could do it in a hundred different ways. Don’t be dramatic. Truth or dare Leo.” Sveta says. 

“Sorry, I’m not used to working on a team like this. Or interactions that don’t involve cash and weapons. 

Dare. Make it embarrassing, that was an asshole move on my part.” Leo replies, humbly. 

“Sing us a song.” Sveta says.

Leo blushes, looking embarrassed. 

“It wouldn’t work here. It’d just be a song.” Leo answers. 

“And?” Sveta challenges. 

Few things have been as shocking as Leo’s singing voice. I’ve seen this man wield powers I will never understand, but honestly, he should be making records. 

Four different languages, one I recognise as English, the other, Latin maybe? But I haven’t a clue on the other two. 

It’s a looping, weaving ballad with a tempo that begins to quicken as it goes on. I don’t know what kind of magic it’d be working if we were outside of this twisted maze, but for the ten minutes it lasts, it’s enough to make us all forget where we are. 


But all reprieves end, and so after a few hours of fitful sleep on collapsing stomachs our group is ready to flip the coin on our fate. 

Hyve and Kaz seem to take more care in choosing the route today. I don’t know exactly what they’re looking for, but one pattern soon becomes obvious. 

“Seems like we keep getting closer to whatever is scuttling around keeping an eye on us.” Leo comments, as we debate going through a doorway to a , “The wonders of the evening news.” room. 

“I don’t think there’s anything following us.” Alex pipes up. 

“Why?” I ask. 

She looks a little nervous for a moment before explaining. 

“Two things. 

First, I know it’s going to sound stupid, but I read a lot of stuff about liminal spaces. This isn’t just some random pocket dimension. It’s pretty much a security system. I don’t think it’d make sense to have something running around. 

Containing things? Securing them in rooms that can hold them? Sure. But why have a whole security system, if there is already something protecting things?

Second is something Will said.

He can control objects that have hurt people, right? And he brings us somewhere full of very powerful stuff that has hurt folks? 

He wants to do things himself, he just wants to make sure we’re weak enough when he does it.” Alex sounds hesitant, and a bit unsure. 

“It’d be an easy way to slow us down. Keep us paranoid about going the right way.” Leo agrees. 

We all stand in front of the door, our fate hanging on the guesses of monsters, demons, and children. 

No faceless entities or evil spirts are behind the door. Just a long hallway, walls lined with televisions behind glass, radios studding the walls, and a din of recorded broadcasts melding together into a nearly indecipherable slurry of sound.

As we enter, the door behind us closes of it’s own accord. 

“Must be doing something right.” Mike says, rattling the now locked door. 

“Anyone else feel it?” Leo says, looking at the various broadcasts as we walk through the room. 

“Something powerful is here.” Hyve agrees. 

“I don’t really feel anything, Punch?” Kaz asks. 

I shrug.

The only door at the end of the long hallway-like room is also locked. We all know it’s a trap, but I’ll be damned if any of us can figure it out. 

We go over the room, several times, all the while expecting the ambush. The nameless horror no doubt waiting to be the newest thing to spill our blood. 

But nothing breaks through a wall, or floats in through a vent. It’s simply us, and entirely too many warring voices. 

What happens next isn’t surprizing. Tensions between us have been growing the past few days. Starvation makes people miserable, and misery loves company. 

“Jesus Christ, you can put a bullet in someone’s eye from a kilometer away, but you can’t watch where you step?” Mike says to Leo. 

Leo looks to him for a moment, seems like he is going to say something, then goes back to inspecting radios, and watching flickering television broadcasts. 

Leo’s body language is, off. Tense. Without turning toward Mike, he begins to speak, “You’re bitching about me stepping on your foot? Fuck off, find something useful to do.”

Mike stops fiddling with a dial on a wood paneled radio. 

“You got something on your mind Leonard?” Mike prods. 

“Gentlemen, this isn’t the time.” Kaz says, trying to keep the peace. 

Something is wrong. I can’t put my finger on it. 

“Stay out of this, Kaz. 

I’ve got plenty on my mind, Mike. For one, I have this nagging feeling having Jack the Ripper at the head of an army of supernatural fuck-ups and losers is a horrible idea.” Leo says as him and Mike face each other. 

“Asshole, I don’t know if I’m going to be the first person to point this out, but your whole thing is being a bigot but aiming it at the supernatural. 

No trouble believing you don’t like the idea of any kind of unity. Must boil your piss to have to work with Kaz and Hyve.” Mike taunts. 

Alex looks scared, I’m at a loss. 

“Sveta, can you talk some sense into these guys?” I ask. 

When I look to her, she’s looking, off. Like she’s trying to concentrate. 

“What’s wrong?” I ask. 

“Something in the air.” she replies  muscles twitching and writhing under her skin. 

“Hyve, what’s happening here?” I stammer. 

“I don’t know, but we need to stop it. Alex, how are you feeling?” Hyve replies. 

“I’m…okay. “ She says, unsure. 

Hyve and Kaz begin to talk to each other. 

“Them, I can deal with. You though, everything about you gets under my skin. Tell me the truth, what the hell are you?” Leo demands. 

“A regular fucking person!” Mike screams, “You on the other hand go around weaving magic or whatever and still think you belong in that category. 

Somewhere, at some point in your family line someone must have fucked or made a deal with something vile. The universe doesn’t go handing out favors like that. And if it did, it wouldn’t be to a myopic, child endangering prick like yourself.”

Kaz, Hyve and myself have no ideas. Panic boils inside of me, every rational thought being shouldered aside by impending doom. The trap has been sprung.

Leo shrugs off his jacket, you can hear the pounds of weaponry inside hit the cheap marble of the floor. The implication of the act hangs in the air.  

Mike laughs. 

“And you think that makes it a fair fight? You’re just proving my point. At the end of the day, you pick fights you know you can win. Just like every other coward, bigoted dickhead since the dawn of time. “ Mike comments. 

Frustrated, Kaz walks over. 

“Gentlemen, you have to…” Kaz begins. 

He’s cut off by a backhanded blow by Leo. The force of it mangling Kaz’s jaw, and cocking his head at an unnatural angle. 

Kaz hits the floor, pain on his face. With a grimace, his broken bones begin to knit.

Sveta screams, going to one knee. The look on her face a combination of rage and pain. Sweat beads on her forehead. 

“Hyve, can’t you just get some more bugs and manhandle these guys until we figure this out?” I ask. 

Hyve shakes his head. 

“We’ve been here for a long time, my connection to the void is weak.” Hyve admits. 

“If it’s one of those objects, then there’s going to be some kind of way of fixing things.” Alex says, obviously trying to hold back terror. 

“Go on. “ Kaz slurs as his body repairs the last of the trauma. 

“It wouldn’t make sense if people worked here and were expected to just die if things went bad. 

They can’t be staffing it with entities, or governments wouldn’t need to be involved. And they can’t just rely on the army or something because it’d be obvious if every time something went wrong, a bunch of tanks were rolling down the street.” Alex says, looking to us for approval. 

“We each take a wall, I think the child is right.” Hyve says. Unspoken agreement sends us all scouring the room for some kind of help. 

“Didn’t think you’d have the balls to try shutting me up. Now I know.” Leo says with a smirk. 

“At what point did I say I wasn’t going to give you what your looking for? I just said you were a pussy.” Mike replies, as the two men run toward each other. 

I’m rifling through pamphlets, breaking open radios, looking for any sign of what Alex was talking about. My luck continues to be terrible as I find nothing of use. 

Sveta is gritting her teeth hard enough one splits with an audible crack. 

I turn for a moment watching the fight between Mike and Leo. 

At first the scarred clown is dodging blows, keeping just out of range, trying to frustrate Leo. I start to hope. Maybe the two of them are just going to tire themselves out. 

But eventually Leo makes contact. The overhand punch hits with a sound like a cloth wrapped sledgehammer. Mike slams against the ground, a large gash on his cheek. 

He drags himself to his feet, Leo mocking him, waiting till the clown gets his footing before leveling a brutal kick to his midsection. Mike splits his forehead open as he hits the ground again. 

“Stay down.” Leo says, his tone grave. 

“The fire hose!” Kaz yells. 

Hyve, Alex and myself run to him. 

The hose itself has been severed, the shredded remains drip a thick, clear fluid. 

“Smells like, Windex.” Alex comments. 

Something draws her attention. 

An emergency binder sits in a metal box with a glass front. Kaz grabs it rifling through the thick, laminated book. 

He finds something that catches his interest, then a look of frustration washes over his face. 

“You god-damned cur!” Kaz exclaims. 

“What?” I ask, failing to keep calm. 

“It’s been vandalized.” Kaz says, showing us a page titled ‘Instruction Booklet excerpt 72.’.

Alex’s face brightens. 

“Let me see, I swear I recognise that title.” She says. 

Mike is hurt badly, but lunges toward Leo all the same. The two men begin a slow, awkward grapple. Their broken, malnourished bodies barely able to press on. 

Leo starts landing short, confined blows to Mike’s midsection. They’d be ineffective if he wasn’t using his prosthetic hand. But with each one, more blood begins to drip from Mike’s mouth and nose. 

 The two men stumble around the room in a kind of violent dance. Glass cases shatter, drywall is destroyed. 

“Fuck!” Leo yells suddenly, pushing Mike backwards and grabbing and a shallow, wide cut on his stomach.

Mike grins, holding a large hunting knife. The clown wheezes, one leg struggling to keep him standing. 

“I wouldn’t have it if you didn’t keep it.” Mike says, his slow speech suggests the blows to his head are catching up to him. 

“I think I remember this one.” Alex begins, verbally filling in the parts of the page that were carefully cut out, “It’s called brain rot. It’s an evil fungus. 

It says here that it only effects adults, and things that are human or partially human.”

“How to we kill it, child?” Hyve says, fear and impatience radiating from his tone. 

“I’m trying to figure that out! It’s not like this was my favorite creepypasta. And it’s not 100% the same.

…Okay, it’s going to be somewhere dark, and enclosed. It’s saying if it starts effecting people…to use the hose.” Alex says. By the end her tone is lost and defeated. 

Kaz talks slowly, kneeling and putting a hand on Alex’s shoulder, “Is there anything else that may be of use?” 

Alex looks deep in concentration. All of us try to block out the noises of the brutal, if one-sided fight. 

“It has to be touching the ground!” Alex says, almost excitedly, “ And this part here, it’s supposed to say its about the size of a small dog.”

The back of the page, mutilated as it may be is a diagram of the room we’re standing in. Will must have been more concerned with leaving us enough information to screw with our heads, the location of the containment cell is clear. 

It’s a small metal door, cleverly embedded in what appears to be a newsdesk. A nearly flush button beside it opens the door with a waft of humid, rank air. 

“I’ll go in, I can fit, and maybe I can remember something else when I get there.” Alex says, determined. 

I can hear strange, hate filled ramblings from within the containment chamber. 

“The hell you will, if that thing is talking, its alive, right?” I ask. 

Alex thinks about lying, “It is, but it’s small. I’ll be fine.”

The sound of a knife clattering and sliding across the room. Mike makes a soul crushing pained noise. Somewhere between an  attempted vomit and a pained scream. 

He's on the ground, nose broken, face a rapidly swelling mess. Leo stands above him, a dozen punctures and lacerations across his body. 

The difference between the two men is clear. Mike is barely hanging onto consciousness, failing to stand. Leo hovers over him, having plenty of harm left to inflict on his prone victim. 

Leo starts to kick, Mike tries, weakly to grab at his booted foot to no avail. 

“I’ve got this Alex, you three just try and figure out something for me to do when I find it other than hope for the best.” I type, making sure Alex can fully understand. 

Mike’s dead if I don’t pull this off, and likely the rest of us will be close behind. Sveta is starting to lose the fight, small tears start to appear on her skin. Her in a rage, without any kind of control? None of us would stand a chance. 

The inside of the containment chamber is a tight fit, even for me. I scrape dripping, purple fungus from the substrata walls as I make my way through the almost intestinal cage. 

It’s larger than it should be, but not by much, after a slow seven foot crawl, there’s a break to the right. 

One wall is a one way mirror, the others covered in recording devices. The thing in front of me, rooted to the floor, spreading it’s fungal mass is strange, even by my standards. 

It's a round, bulbous thing, pulsating and dripping thin purple fluid. It’s body bobs as it’s large, human-looking mouth rants the most vile things I can think of. Hatred, fear and chaos radiate from this thing. 

It turns toward me, and for a second laughs in a maniacal, high pitched tone. 

Outside, not even a foot away, Leo levels a brutal kick toward Mike’s skull. The clown’s eyes glaze. 

When you’re a hammer every problem is a nail. It’s a common misquote, but in my situation it’s more apt than the proper quotation. 

Quickly I realize this isn’t a problem I can violence my way out of. The creature’s body shifts and splits, reforming itself instantly from any kind of damage. I can’t even slow down it’s mind-destroying fungal chatter. 

Sveta screams loud enough to shake the walls. Death and failure begin to close in. 

I find myself hoping, praying for some built in surprize from my maker. Some last second play, built in by the woman who saw all this coming. 

But it doesn’t happen. With every second, I become more entangled with the growing, vile spore creature. 

“Punch!” Alex screams, her voice muted by the spongy walls of the containment cell. 

Something comes sliding down the vent-like hallway, bounces from the wall and rests just out of reach. 

At first I don’t know what it is or how I could use it. Having not been through a worldwide pandemic and all. 

I focus on trying to find some weak spot, some organ on the growth. But despite having “Brain” in it’s name, there’s nothing to stab, rip or strangle. 

My legs are completely engulfed. I may not be human enough to get effected by it’s disease, but apparently that isn’t it’s only trick. 

I kick off a wall, slightly ripping myself free. The dim light just enough for me to read the label of the clear plastic dispenser. 

“Hand Sanitizer.”

I’m sure there would have been a more dignified way to use it, but in a panic I slam my metal skull against the cheap bottle. 

The effect raises my spirits. Grey smoke begins to pour from anywhere the thick, clear fluid touches. The fungus stops spreading it’s mycological mind mutilation, screaming an ear splitting wail. 

I can’t take chances, I twist and turn my alcohol soaked body toward the Brain-Rot, grabbing and rolling like a pitbull. 

It’s a claustrophobic, violent struggle. I can’t get leverage, but the fungus is losing mass quicker than it can spread. I push consequences from my mind, ignore the sounds of bones cracking, Alex’s screams, Kaz’s pleading. 

But I prevail. I crawl from the vent, last vestiges of the fungus blackening and liquefying behind me. 

I’m filthy, and likely smell like a bucket of shit. 

Leo, Sveta and Mike begin to cough and vomit. Purple Phlegm and stringy vomit coming out in quantities the human body shouldn’t be able to produce. 

They come too like nightmare sufferers, looking around confused and shocked. 

Leo looks mortified, shame radiates off him like heat from a fever. 

“Mike, I couldn’t….Fuck I’m so sorry.” Leo says, helping the clown to his feet. I’ve never heard his voice so small. 

“No way in hell I’m letting Will cause any shit between us.” Mike says, spitting out fragments of blood and teeth, “Wasn’t you, wasn’t me. Christ though, don’t ever become a bouncer man.”

The clown laughs, coughs and grabs his ribs. 

The fact the door out opens gives an almost game-like feel to what will is doing. It’s demeaning, and demoralizing. 

The room beyond is massive and  lit with harsh red light, “The Weird and Wild West.” Is the room’s theme, because, of course it is, why wouldn’t it be? 

“This is it, that exit sign, is *the* exit.” Kaz says, the door behind us vanishing. 

“But you guys feel that right?” Leo says, none of us need to reply. 

The room feels thick with supernatural energy. The echo of the void a physical hum. 

“Nearly everything here is a totem of some form.” Hyve says warily. 

All around us are animatronics, wax figures, mannequins, all set up in various western centric scenes. 

One side of the massive room seems to be a kind of gift-shop food vendor combo, as western themed as the rest of the room. 

We know he has to be somewhere, this is Will’s endgame, and with how horrifying the trip here has been, none of us want to think of what’s next. 

We cautiously begin to look around the red-lit room.

I would have noticed the red dot on Sveta’s chest sooner, but the crimson lighting did it’s job. 

The next thousandth of a second seems to take hours. It burns itself into my mind. 

A ragged hole the side of a fist suddenly appears just under Sveta’s shoulder. She starts to fall, her body immediately starting to change, repairing the damage as it does so. It hurts her, but isn’t a lethal wound by any means. 

The crack of the gunshot. 

Kaz, standing behind her takes the now tumbling round in the chest, it fragments, leaving him nearly bisected. Much like Sveta, the garish wound throws him to the side, and leaves him screaming, but isn’t lethal. 

It exits his body as a spray of metal, hitting the tile floor and turning into a hail of gore and shrapnel. 

About half of this comes to rest in Alex. There’s no action movie impact, she simply hits the ground, taking a brief moment to look down and the wounds I refuse to describe here. 

Those of us that can, scatter. Alex not so much as wheezing as her short life comes to an end. 

The light turns normal, and the sounds of movement happen all around us. Will’s laughter echoes through overhead speakers. 

I’m finishing this post up as sentient Dioramas shake off years of immobility and arm themselves with equally powerful objects meant to be hidden from humanity. 

I hate to say it, but I have no idea how we are getting out of this. 

Till next time, if there is one.

Punch.
