***\[Transcript starts\]***

&#x200B;

**Young:** Alright Mr. Edwards, the tape is rolling. Why don’t we get started?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yeah, of course.

&#x200B;

**Young:** So this scam, why don’t you start by telling us how you got involved?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Well it started with the message I got. It just got sent to me out of the blue over Whatsapp.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see. You got involved over a Whatsapp message?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yeah, yeah… I know. I’m a fucking patsy. I should’ve just ignored the whole thing, but I was curious.

&#x200B;

**Young:** What exactly did this message say?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Well it wasn’t just one message. It was several. They actually added me and a bunch of others to a group chat at random. So, I just sorta checked my phone and it had just sorta blown up when I wasn’t looking. I actually have some screenshots. I could read them if you’d like.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Okay…? Sure…?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I promise, I’ll just stick to the relevant portions!

&#x200B;

**Young:** Fair enough.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** So the first message I got read:

&#x200B;

*‘Hello everyone! Welcome new friends who have joined our group! I am David, I am The Administrator! Welcome to the bitcoin trading team of Pimrose Financial Consulting Co. Ltd. From now on, I will be here every day to share with you how to increase your wealth through Bitcoin and grow your income rapidly. If you do not wish to triple your income, you may leave this group. My sincere apologies if I have bothered you!’*

&#x200B;

**Young:** Very legitimate…

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yeah… I know. Gotta say though, when I read that shit I was kinda relieved since it meant that the 80+ missed messages on my phone *weren’t* because of something terrible had happened! Not a lotta situations where getting added into a phony group for Cryptocurrency enthusiasts is the best possible outcome.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I suppose given the circumstances, yes. But let’s continue. So you saw this and didn’t immediately leave the group?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Look, I already admitted that I’m a fucking patsy. I mean, yeah, my first instinct was that this was all some kind of scam, but the messages were right there and I was… I dunno, a little curious. So I figured I’d read a little bit before deleting the group and moving on with my life.

&#x200B;

**Young:** And what exactly did they say to convince you to stay?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Well there was a whole spiel...

*‘Pimrose Financial is an Alberta based bank that has recently spearheaded the bold leap into the world of cryptocurrency. It is now the largest and wealthiest cryptobrokerage corporation in the world, trading tens of thousands of products (foreign exchange, gold, diamonds, commodities, encrypted digital currencies, NFT and social media) which earn investors millions each day.’*

&#x200B;

*‘Their business accounts for 29% of the global retail contracts foreign exchange economic market, leading to high stocks and large ROI for more than 250000000 digital currency contracts, NFTs, retail customers, investors and billionaires such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and others. Pimrose Financial is growing its capital strength day by day and is doing financial business on a global scale with large companies.’*

&#x200B;

*‘The account opening process of the Pimrose Financial is easy, secure and convenient. Our analysts are highly competent with a 98% of reference accuracy in analyzing fluctiatuins in cryptocurrency contracts and ammortization, giving our investors opportunities to trade with 24 hour global service accessible from anywhere in the world in any language.’*

*‘We are working with every security agency to guarantee that there is no fraud or scam here. You can trust us as we are a registered and certified company designed to change everyones financial situation. If you want to easily earn at least $500 every day, speak to one of our analysts.’*

&#x200B;

*‘Pimrose Financial assures you that so long as you invest in accordance with the strategy.’*

&#x200B;

**Young:** Mr. Edwards I don’t mean to be condescending but if someone needs to tell you that something *isn’t* a scam…

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I know, I know… and I mean, look at this shit, it’s all just… word salad. I also noticed that the messages were coming from two different accounts, David and Sean, although they flowed into each other almost flawlessly.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Yeah this wasn’t suspicious at all.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Aren’t you like, here to listen?

&#x200B;

**Young:** I am, but I can’t guarantee I won’t judge.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** *\[Pause\]* You know what? Fair enough. I deserve that.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Let’s move on. So why exactly did you decide to follow through with this scam?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Well I wanted to see how much of what they were saying was bullshit. They’d posted a link to this landing page that looked like it was part of the Primrose Financial site, and that backed up most of what they were saying. And some people in the chat were talking about having invested with them before. It started making me second guess the credibility of it all.

&#x200B;

**Young:** You started thinking it might be legitimate?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yeah. Basically. They were trying to pump this one specific shitcoin… that’s the term for…

&#x200B;

**Young:** I’m aware, Mr. Edwards.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Right, well… the main administrator in the chat… David. He was pushing this one coin called GoldSpark. The buy in wasn’t all that big, like… only about twenty bucks. I started thinking I didn’t have anything to lose.

&#x200B;

**Young:** So you bought in?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yeah… I bought in. And once I did, David started sending me personal messages, telling me how to grow the value of my coin. I figured it was helpful… I didn’t actually know anything about Crypto going in. I probably still don’t know anything about Crypto. I just knew you could make a lot of money off of it.

&#x200B;

**Young:** So what exactly did David tell you to do in order to grow the value of your investment?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Well, promote it. The idea was that the more people who bought into GoldSpark, the more valuable it was. We were supposed to promote GoldSpark online. Post about it on Facebook and Twitter, try to get other people we knew to buy into it. I actually started hitting up some friends of mine, trying to sell them on it.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Of course you did.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** And to help us sell it, there were seminars.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Seminars?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** David would host these online seminars. Webinars. A webinar is when you-

&#x200B;

**Young:** I’m familiar with what a webinar is, Mr. Edwards.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Right, right. Sorry. But yeah, he hosted these webinars to teach you how to sell. I’d never worked in sales before either. I’m a landscaper by trade. But I figured that at least it was a good career experience. The price didn’t seem that bad either. A year’s subscription to the webinars was about $200, and there was a Discord for questions too.

&#x200B;

**Young:** You paid $200 for webinars and a Discord…?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** It seemed like a good idea at the time, I thought I was legitimately learning a lot! David also got me to invest a little more in GoldSpark too. I bought into the coin a little more, I spent… $500, I think? No. $700.

&#x200B;

**Young:** And did you actually make money back on this?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yeah, a little bit. Not… um… looking back, it wasn’t much… only about $150… but it was money I was earning.

&#x200B;

**Young:** And of the money you earned back, they took a cut, yes?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yes. David kept saying that the earnings start slow but build fast.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I’m sure he did.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Look, I know I was getting taken for a ride… I know that now. But David made it all sound real. He was good at that. Honestly, if it hadn’t been for the guided meditation sessions, I probably wouldn’t have figured that anything was wrong.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Meditation sessions? Tell me about those.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Well, David always started and ended his webinars with these guided meditation sessions. He said it opened the mind up to learning. So we’d all sit in front of our computers, he’d put on this sorta, tranquil music and we’d all meditate.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I couldn’t tell you if it worked or not. But I always felt… I dunno, drained… after the seminars. I’d usually just go to lie down and sleep. I never really questioned it. They went on for a while, usually around 4 hours.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see. These guided meditation sessions, how long did they last?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Fifteen minutes, give or take. It was quirky, I know. But I thought this guy was legit… legit businessmen do all sorts of weird shit, right? Maybe that’s the secret to success?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Sure.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Anyway, I didn’t think anything of it at first. It was just, something we did. And I figured that the exhaustion I felt afterward was unrelated.

&#x200B;

**Young:** What changed?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** It’s… it’s hard to explain. It sounds stupid, now that I’m trying to say it out loud.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Try me.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Well it’s just… my speakers failed.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Your speakers failed?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yeah, during one of the seminars. Right as he was getting into the guided meditation. He was like, talking us into that trance state, you know?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Right.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** And then my audio cut out. It sorta disrupted my flow. I was getting into that trance state before that, right, and then my speakers cut out and I was like, fully awake again, trying to fix my speakers.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Uh-huh.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** It wasn’t a hard fix or anything, but when I got it… when I got the audio back, I heard… I don’t know how to describe it.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Try.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** David was still doing the guided meditation but he was like… he chanting… it… it sounded familiar, but unfamiliar at the same time.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Can you elaborate?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I’ll try. It was… it wasn’t in any language I recognized. It was in this… I don’t know how to describe it, but it sent a chill through me. It sounded *wrong* somehow. I don’t know how to describe it better than that. *Wrong.*

&#x200B;

**Young:** Do you remember exactly what he said?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I couldn’t make out the individual words or anything. It was like… *‘Haash laveei, cenrnebeahs az saeel. Srascha maak drol eahsai…’*

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see…

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I recorded a bit of it, I included that recording in the files your associate asked for, along with the other documents I sent. Printouts of emails, screenshots of chats, stuff like that.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I’ll have to consult that recording, then.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I actually did show the recording to someone. A friend of mine. His wife is into this new age meditation stuff. She knows more about it than I do. She took a listen to the recording I made.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Okay, and what did she say?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** She’d never heard anything like this before. She said it all sounded wrong too. She asked for a copy of the recording to take another look at it, said she wanted to show it to some other people.

&#x200B;

**Young:** And I assume she did?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yeah, it took about two weeks for her to get back to me but… when she did, she sent me this panicked email.

&#x200B;

**Young:** What was in the email?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** It was in the documents I sent.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Right, but for the record, please.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Oh… well… she was talking about how one of her friends had said that chanting was some sort of invocation. Some sort of… I don’t know, demonic song, or something?

&#x200B;

**Young:** A demonic song…?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yeah, I didn’t buy it either but she was serious about it. She started sending me these links to all sorts of new age websites. I didn’t really know what to make of it, but this didn’t sound like complete bullshit, you know? And I got to wondering why the hell a sales webinar had some sort of demonic song in it. I mean… none of it really tracked, right? Cryptocurrency, webinars, demonic incantations. That’s all just… weird.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I’ve heard weirder.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** You have?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Let’s stay focused. What did you do with the information you were given in the emails?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I asked David about it, obviously! I mean, by then I figured we had some sort of rapport, you know? I figured he’d have some explanation for all of this, I mean it was probably all a bunch of bullshit, right?

&#x200B;

**Young:** So you asked him?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yeah, I asked him.

&#x200B;

**Young:** And what did he say?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** He said it was just something his teacher had taught him… actually he had a lot to say about the whole thing. He started going hard into the benefits of that meditation stuff, but like… I don’t know, he got really aggressive about it.

&#x200B;

**Young:** And that put you off?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yeah, it did. It just… I don’t know, it was like the blinders finally came off the horse. He was just clearly talking out of his ass at that point, making shit up to try and sound smarter than he was and it got me thinking about some other stuff. Got me thinking about how badly this asshole had probably taken me for a ride.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see. So once you caught him in some bullshit, the rest of his fabrications started falling apart?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Exactly.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Well, I’m glad something shook you out of all of this.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yeah, me too. I didn’t really say anything to David at the time, but I started thinking about pulling out then. And a few days later, I sold all of the Goldspark I’d bought into to try and make a clean break. I sold it all at a loss… but I was out.

&#x200B;

**Young:** And that’s the end of it?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I wish… I wish it was the end of it. At the time I’d thought it was. But if that was where it ended, you and I wouldn’t be having this conversation right now.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see. What happened next, Mr. Edwards?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I’d made a few friends in the GoldSpark community, and since I’d realized I was getting scammed, I figured they were probably also getting scammed. So I started reaching out to them, telling them about the chanting, trying to make them realize that everything David was selling didn’t really add up.

&#x200B;

**Young:** But they wouldn’t listen?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** No, they wouldn’t. I even showed them the audio I’d recorded of the chanting but… I don’t know, they just… they brushed it off. Dismissed it as part of the meditation. Acted like *I* was the one being crazy.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see. So what did you do?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Not much. There wasn’t really anything I could do. I’d tried and I’d failed so, I made that clean break. Got away from GoldSpark and got away from the community. And then a few weeks later that’s when the nightmares started.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Nightmares?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I’d… I’d started having dreams. Dreams where I was in front of my computer, doing one of the webinars, listening to Davids chanting. But I… I could feel something behind me. Something in the room with me. I couldn’t see it. Couldn’t turn around to look at it. But it was still there. It was still…

&#x200B;

**Young:** You sensed it?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I did… yes.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Tell me more.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Usually, I’d become aware that I was dreaming. And I’d try to wake up but… something would… something would stop me. Like it was holding me down, holding me down in my sleep. I don’t know. The chanting would just continue and when I finally did wake up I’d just feel so… so drained…

&#x200B;

**Young:** Did you talk to anyone about these dreams?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yeah, I talked to my doctor, I talked to my therapist. None of them had any fixes. My doctor said it was fucking sleep apnea. Sent me to a sleep clinic to get checked out. But the sleep clinic… well, they said it wasn’t sleep apnea.

&#x200B;

**Young:** What did they say?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Parasomnia. They said I kept tossing and turning, muttering to myself in my sleep. Out of curiosity, I asked to look at the recording. They agreed. In the recording… they had audio and I could… I could hear myself talking in my sleep. Chanting.

&#x200B;

**Young:** The same chant David used?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** The exact same. I was just… muttering it under my breath. They gave me some suggestions to stop the sleep talking, but by then I already knew that this was something else.

&#x200B;

**Young:** You thought it was connected to David?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I *knew* it was connected. I started recording myself at night… started watching the playback. Every night, it was the same. Every night I’d dream about that fucking webinar and every night I’d mutter to myself in my sleep. It was disturbing. And the more I watched the video playback, the worse it got.

&#x200B;

**Young:** What did you see?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I sent you the footage, right?

&#x200B;

**Young:** You did, yes.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Then you’ve seen it. The shape standing by my bed. It’s hard to see in the dark but it’s there. Lurking over me… watching me as I whisper to myself in my sleep. I’ve tried to get a better look at it, but as far as I know it only appears on the camera.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Do you have any idea what that figure might be, Mr. Edwards?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** No. I don’t. I just know that it’s there.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Have you tried to identify it?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yes. But with no luck. I reached back out to some of the other guys who bought into GoldSpark with me. Most of them won’t give me the time of day anymore, but a couple of them got out. Some of them even did it before I did.

&#x200B;

**Young:** What did they say?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Not much. The ones who were still alive didn’t want to talk about the dreams they’d been having.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Still alive?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** There were six other guys I knew of who’d stepped away from GoldSpark… last time I checked, four of them were dead now.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see…

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** One of the guys, I talked to his wife. She mentioned how he’d been acting strange before he’d died. Not sleeping, muttering to himself when he did sleep… then finally he’d thrown himself off the roof of their apartment building. It was a similar story with the other three guys. One of them had crashed his car into a wall. Another had OD’d on pills and one last guy had just… he’d died at work. Someone said he’d thrown himself into a rock crusher.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Jesus…

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** The remaining two guys weren’t doing so good either. I know they weren’t keen on talking about the nightmares, but I know they were having them. I know they weren’t doing well.

&#x200B;

**Young:** And how are you doing, Mr. Edwards?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** I’m scared… the nightmares just keep getting worse. I know it’s related to GoldSpark somehow, but I can’t make sense on how. It’s more than just a scam… it’s… it’s something about David. Something about him… I don’t know what.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Have you tried to contact David?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yes. He hasn’t responded to me. I’m not sure if he knows I’m on to him or what, but he hasn’t responded to me.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see… Mr. Edwards, can you pass Davids information along to us? We’d like to reach out to him.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** If you think it’ll help, then sure. But I don’t know that it will. I hope so, but…

&#x200B;

**Young:** We’ll look into this for you, Mr. Edwards.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Thanks… I’m… I’m really tired now. Do you need anything else from me?

&#x200B;

**Young:** No. Do you have anything else you need to share with us?

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** No, that’s it.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Okay, well, I’ll save this recording then and walk you out. Thanks for your time, Mr. Edwards.

&#x200B;

**Edwards:** Yeah… for sure.

&#x200B;

***\[Transcript ends\]***

&#x200B;

*Follow up: August 2nd, 2023*

&#x200B;

*Follow up on Edwards statement has confirmed that a cryptocurrency called GoldSpark did exist, but is now defunct and we were unable to find much information on ‘David’. Attempts at contacting him through the channels provided were unsuccessful and attempts at locating those who had previously bought into GoldSpark were unsuccessful as well. Everyone we were able to find who’d bought into it was deceased. The causes of death were primarily suicide.*

&#x200B;

*On July 9th, 2023, Jamie Edwards took his own life at work by climbing into a woodchipper. His co-workers stated that he’d seemed unfocused, tired and disoriented during the days leading up to his suicide.*

*As of November 2023, we have yet to determine what exactly was going on with GoldSpark. As a result, this case remains open but with the death or disappearence of all individuals involved, it seems unlikely that we will uncover an answer any time soon.*
