Recently, my friends and I have become obsessed with online gaming. Being in college and often seen as social pariahs, my only friends, Tray and Zoey, found gaming to be an escape from the monotony of young adult life. We met through school, and the game became our weekly Tuesday ritual.

I don't want to name names for copyright reasons, but it's a wildly popular, free-to-play online battle royale game. The fast-paced gameplay and unique building mechanics kept us coming back match after match. We would spend hours every week trying to outlast the competition and be the last team standing. At first, we tried creating open lobbies, but we quickly realized we preferred to only play with each other. So, to avoid unwanted party members we decided to start using randomly generated join codes to ensure it was only the three of us on a team. No exceptions.

We also created a private Discord server to voice chat and share the codes, but it quickly became more than that. It turned into a place where we shared funny memes, dumb videos, and planned out strategies for the game throughout the week. Even so, Tuesday nights at 7 PM were sacred. That was the time we sent out the random game code and hopped into our matches together. Hours passed that felt like mere minutes.

On this particular evening, it was my turn to host, and I started up the game like any other Tuesday. I was excited to finally play the new map that had just released over the weekend. As I loaded in, something about the game seemed a little off, but I didn’t think much of it. I jumped into voice chat, sent the room code, and waited for Tray and Zoey to join.

The lobby looked strange; the screen was completely black. I couldn’t see the characters at all, but the text fields were still visible. I wondered if it could've been some sort of botched update. I noticed Zoey’s gamer tag appear. She had joined the game, but I still couldn’t see anything else. Then, an unfamiliar name appeared on the screen: Cabman. I stared at it for a few seconds, puzzled, but assumed Tray had just changed his gamer tag for some reason. Afterall, we were the only 3 people who had access to this lobby. I started the match, thankful that the loading screen appeared normal. Whatever glitch had happened earlier seemed to have resolved itself for now.

Our characters began the level, and everything seemed normal at first. However, I didn’t recognize the Cabman skin, and something about it felt unnerving. He was tall, draped in a long black peacoat, and wore a pitch-black flat cap that cast an ominous shadow over his face. Underneath the brim, his only visible features were two glowing eyes that pierced through the darkness.

“Who’s Cabman?” Zoey asked through voice chat, her tone confused and trailing off.

“I thought it was Tray!” I replied, equally perplexed.

“I’m not in yet,” Tray responded. “I was waiting for the screen to load, but it never let me in. Are you guys already in a match?”

The three of us paused.

“Then who is Cabman?” I asked, feeling my stomach drop. “I didn’t invite anyone else. Did you?” There was no way anyone could have joined our server without the randomly generated code. The odds of someone accidentally entering our code exactly right were something like one in two billion.

“I didn’t invite anyone,” Zoey said with an uneasy laugh. “Do you think it’s some kind of glitch or something?”

“Wait, so someone else joined? Can we just boot them?” Tray suggested, clearly feeling out of the loop. “No big deal, right?”

Tray’s idea made sense, but I couldn’t shake the creeping feeling I had about this strange player joining our private server. If I could just kick them and start a new lobby, everything should go back to normal—right?

I pulled up the menu and tried clicking the “Kick” option beside the mystery player’s name. The moment I pressed the button, the game froze. My screen flickered to black, and I could hear my monitor crackling like old tv static.

The monitor remained dark for a few seconds, until an unexpected pop-up window appeared. It was an ad for a taxi service, with a pixelated photo of an outdated Crown Victoria taxi, and bold, bright yellow text that read: “Best service! Pickup and drop-off, available 24/7!” The timing felt eerily strange, and completely out of place. I hesitated, staring at the ad for a moment, before hovering my mouse over the “X” to close the window. It seemed too coincidental to ignore.

As soon as I closed the window, the game’s loading screen appeared, and I waited for the spinning icon to vanish. When the game finally reloaded, Cabman was still there, standing in the same spot as if he were waiting for us. This wasn’t normal, but I didn’t know what to do.

“No good,” I told the others, “Cabman is still in the game. I can’t kick him for some reason.”

Zoey tried to maintain her composure. "Maybe we have to finish the match. Let’s just play and see if it will take us back to the lobby after."

Tray seemed annoyed, but none of us knew what else to do, so Zoey and I started our run with Cabman. It became obvious that he wasn’t just any player. As the match continued, strange things began happening.

The character acted oddly—he wouldn’t pick up weapons, build, or attack. Instead, he followed us everywhere, always staying just out of frame, as if he didn’t want to be fully seen. If we ran ahead, he would stay behind, but the moment you’d pan over to look for him, he was suddenly only a few feet away, watching silently.

We tried to interact with him, but his actions felt disorganized, like they were out of sync with normal player controls. His movements were jerky and delayed, like a broken NPC in a poorly made mod.

Yet, the weirdest part was his in-game microphone appeared to always be active, like he was speaking but no sound came through. I tried adjusting my headset and turning up the volume, hoping to hear something, but all I could hear was a very faint static sound. The closer I listened I thought I could make out muffled voices, whispering unintelligibly.

Before long, Cabman stopped following us altogether. It was like he was trying to lead us instead. Whenever we hid or tried to loot, he would continue ahead, stopping at seemingly random points on the map, just waiting.

At first, I thought he might be scouting ahead, but something about his behavior seemed off. I noticed that wherever Cabman stood, the map began to change. Trees near him shed their leaves, becoming bare and lifeless. Grassy fields withered and dried up as if drained of life.

The sky above him became dark and menacing, but only small sections would experience these unnatural atmospheric changes. Occasionally, I caught glimpses of the clouds flickering and glitching behind him, revealing what looked like raw, unedited code. It was almost like Cabman’s very existence was corrupting the world around him.

“Are you seeing this?” Zoey said, her voice shaking.

“Seeing what?” Tray asked, still stuck at the frozen loading screen.

“The map… it’s like glitching or something.” I replied, my voice trembling through the headset.

“Glitching how?” Tray shouted back, frustrated yet intrigued.

A house we were looting began to crumble into ash just as Cabman stepped inside, leaving nothing but an empty, black void where the house once stood.

“It’s like he’s manipulating the game itself!” I stammered, feeling the paranoia growing inside me. It felt as if Cabman could somehow hear my words and would use them against me if I wasn’t careful.

In the blink of an eye, another team darted over the hill, guns blazing as they charged toward us.

“Zoey, this team is going to end us! I was so distracted by this weird Cabman stuff; I forgot we were actually playing against other players!” I shouted into my mic, panicking.

“Start running toward the Convergence Circle! If we can make it there, we’ll be in the endgame, and they’ll have to follow us into the chaos of the final remaining teams!” Zoey shouted back, her voice tense.

“I don’t know if we’ll make it that far,” I yelled with anxiety in my tone. “My health is draining fast, and I don’t think I have enough stamina to outrun them.”

Just as the words left my mouth, a weird looking, old, beat-up Crown Victoria taxicab pulled up next to the battle zone. Cars were a common part of the game, and players often used them to cover large areas, but I’d never seen a taxicab before. It seemed completely out of place. Then again, everything I’d seen since Cabman joined had felt out of place.

“What the heck is this thing?” I asked in disbelief.

“It looks like a taxicab! And…  you see who’s driving, don’t you!?” Zoey retorted, her tone becoming more animated.

“A taxicab?” Tray shouted, “There are not taxicabs in this game.”

Behind the wheel sat the ghostly figure of Cabman, with his glowing eyes piercing through the windshield like two headlights shining from the driver’s seat.

“I don’t think we have much of a choice, Zoey. If we don’t get in the car, we’re dead,” I exclaimed, my voice trembling with dread.

“I hate that you’re right,” Zoey replied reluctantly, her hesitation evident. “Let’s just hope he’s actually going to help us...”
