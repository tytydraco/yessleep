Hey. I’ve never done one of these… Testimonials before, but this has been eating away at me. Figured I’d get this… Somewhere.

To start this off, I’ll give you some background. I live with my dad. I have a stepmom, and a freaky fucking basement. I’ll tell you how it’s laid out to help you visualize this. 

At the top of the steps, there’s a landing. Nothing creepy about it, just a landing. If you face towards the steps, the sliding door to the rest of the house is to your right and behind you is the door to the garage. At the bottom of the stairs, there’s two rooms. To the left, there’s 2 of 4 fridges in the basement. One that sits there and rots as it’s broken and the other that holds stuff that needs to be extra cold because the upstairs fridge just doesn’t get cold enough. Milk spoils in the span of a couple days. We mostly keep leftovers, beer, and dairy products in the downstairs one. This room also has a closet with a curtain as the door. My dad keeps some of his brewing stuff in there. He does it for work. 

In the other room of the basement, that’s where we keep all of the clutter. Junk upon junk. Booze, CDs, records, my mom’s old things, old clothes, old furniture, my drum kit. To the left of the door to this room is the furnace, breaker box, and my barbells. There’s also a bunch of junk but nothing notable that I have to mention. To the right, the washing machine and dryer, a pipe that runs floor to ceiling, almost like a column. The room wraps around to below the stairs. If you go even farther right, my drum kit is there along with my dad’s old treadmill. Under the stairs is where the real problems arise. There’s junk set up in such a way that a little room is set up that you can crawl into.

That’s enough blabbering. I should tell you the story. 

About a week ago, my pop and I were watching a movie. I couldn’t tell you what. It was about halfway through when he spoke up.

“Hey buddy, could you go get me a beer?”

“Sure dad, be right back”

“Thanks, Junior.”

I clunked down the loud stairs one by one. About a third of the way down, something runs from the left room, to the front room.

“Huh… Weird…”

I play it off as just my mind playing tricks on me. Cliche, right? It was late and I tend to see and hear things when I’m tired. I finish my descent and grab a Heineken for my dad. As I turn back out of the room to go back up the steps, I hear something slap against the ground behind me. I turn and am met with the most terrifying “woman” i have ever seen in my entire life.

The thing that met my gaze was about 7’0 feet tall from my estimate, was pale and bony, had no clothing on, but also no… Delicates… Completely smooth. All over. The only reason I know she was a she was because of her voice. She always screamed. Loud. Loud enough that it sounded like your headphones were peaking in your ears. If you’ve ever seen the Shining, Think of how Shelly Duvall screams “NO!” when Jack Nicholson is chopping the door down. Think of that but instead of your TV, it’s two giant speakers duct taped to the sides of your head. 

She creaked her mouth open, like rusted hinges on a door and screamed. 

“GEEEEETT… OUTTTTTT!”

Her teeth were disgusting. I’m not one to have great hygiene as I don’t often leave the house but hers were absolutely vile.

I took off up the steps and she retreated into the front room and I slammed the door shut behind me. I ran to my father and tried to tell him what happened.

“Dad! Dad! There’s something in the basement! Some fucken… Weird bony thing!”

“…”

My dad didn’t respond to me. He acted like he couldn’t hear me. I tried to get his attention.

“DAD!”

“Huh? What?”

“There’s something in the fucking basement!”

“…”

Silence again. No matter how many times I tried to tell him, he didn’t respond.

I’ll save you some time and abridge this.

Over the past week nobody would listen to me. I tried telling my stepmom when she was over and she did the same thing as my father. Every night I could hear her through the vent in my room behind my headboard. She would walk around, scream, knock things over. One time I made her scream out my name. My last name. 

When my parents were at work, the basement would beckon to me. It tried to seduce me, but I did my best to keep away from it. When I didn’t, she would chase me back out. 

Yesterday, the power went out while my dad was at work. I called him and asked when he’ll be home because the power’s out. He told me to go flip the breaker.

I put it off for a few hours but the summer heat started to get to me. I grabbed a flashlight and a kitchen knife and approached the door. I slid it open and set my foot down on the first step down into the mildew. No sign of her. I slowly crept down the stairway to hell and entered the front room. She was sitting in the corner, looking dead at me. Not moving, not screaming. She was smiling wide, ear to ear with her rotten teeth. Her eye twitched when I shined the light in her face. The breaker was in the middle of the wall and she was cooped up in the corner directly next to it. 

Against my better judgement, I crawled towards the breaker and flipped it. 

She did NOT like that.

She immediately started screeching like a banshee at me and started twitching intensely.

“GET OUT! GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT!” 

She shrieked over and over again. I watched her stand up and start flailing her body, knocking things over. I fumbled my flashlight and my weapon and I bolted to the top of the stairs. When I reached the top landing, I looked back down. She pointed a long, skinny claw at me and sent chills down my spine.

“JAAAAAMEEEEESSSSSONNNNNNN….”

She droned. I watched her sprint up the stairs. She has never come up the steps before. My first thought was to hide in my room and lock the door. She chased me through the kitchen, the dining room and down the hallway. As soon as I closed the door, it all stopped. I haven’t left my room in 4 days. My dad hasn’t come home, called, or texted. I can’t get a hold of anybody. I’ve heard her scratch at the door on and off. 

I have no idea what the fuck to do.
