I don’t even remember exactly how I got the internship. Hell, I hardly recall applying for it—or *any* internship, for that matter.

But somehow, in the middle of financial stress and uncertainty, the email appeared.

**“Congratulations! You’ve been selected for our exclusive research internship at DataCorp Incorporated—a leader in technology development.”**

I don’t know why I didn’t question it more. Maybe it was desperation. Maybe I just wanted to believe I’d finally caught a break.

The job description was vague but simple: **Assist in diagnostics and research to support the development of new processes and solutions.**

Straightforward. To the point.

And yet, something about it felt… *off.*

There was no mention of who I’d report to. No contact information. Just an address, a start date, and a note at the bottom that stuck with me long after I clicked *accept*:

**“Your assigned project is strictly confidential. Do not discuss your work outside of authorized personnel.”**

\-

And so it began—my internship at DataCorp.

On my first day, I was given a keycard. It wasn’t anything like the standard white badges most employees wore, mine was matte black with no identifying details. When I asked about it, my supervisor—an expressionless man in a crisp suit—simply said, **“You’ll need it for access.”**

Access to what, exactly?

I’d find out soon enough.

The elevator at the end of the hall required my keycard to activate. When the doors opened, I stepped inside, and the panel had only *one* accessible button: **Sublevel 4.**

The descent felt a lot longer than it should have. The air grew colder, heavier. When the doors finally opened, I expected to see a bustling research facility, maybe even rows of workstations filled with other interns. Instead, the space was dimly lit, and eerily quiet. A single desk. A single computer. No windows. No clocks. Just the faint hum of unseen machinery behind the walls.

My supervisor gestured to the station. **“This is where you’ll be working.”**

He explained my expectations in an almost rehearsed and monotone manner. 

**“Your computer is connected to one of our secure data systems. It’s hardwired—no wireless access, no external connections. Your job is simple. Compile the data and send the reports to a secure server at the end of your shift. That’s all.”**

Sounded easy enough. Almost a little *too* easy.

For someone who just got their master’s degree in information systems, this was small potatoes—just basic data entry. And yet, as I sat down and logged in for the first time, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t just analyzing *data*.

There was something else going on.

\-

Despite the trivial nature of my position—and the unsettling lack of any real knowledge about *what* I was actually working on—I did what I was told.

For months, I mined data, compiled reports, and sent them off to the company’s secure server. I had no clue what the information meant or why it mattered. But I didn’t ask questions. Why would I? The job was easy, and it paid well.

Still… things started to feel *off.*

At first, it was just small things—odd lines of code buried in the data, like it didn’t really belong. Sometimes, my screen would glitch for a fraction of a second, too fast to be sure I’d actually seen it. Once in a while, the power would flicker, the basement going pitch black for just long enough to make my heart skip a beat. 

I told myself it was nothing. The building was old and massive, probably full of outdated wiring. A simple surge. Likely harmless. 

But then, one day, my computer did something it *wasn’t* supposed to do.

Without warning, a terminal window opened—unprompted. Code started running on its own, streaming down the screen faster than I could even read it. 

I barely had time to react.

**“Fuck, fuck, fuck. Dammit, turn off—”**

I yanked the power cord so hard that a chunk of drywall came with it.

That should’ve been the end of it. But behind the hole where the outlet had been, a *beam of red light* flickered to life.

I froze.

Slowly, I crouched down to peer through the opening I had made.

At first, all I could see was darkness. But then—movement. A shadow shifting in the dim light. I felt like something was watching me.

Whatever it was, it was almost human.

I stopped breathing.

Something *was down there.*

My mind was a scrambled mess of panic and adrenaline.

**Oh, I’m in deep shit. I’ve gone too far down the rabbit hole now.**

But then another thought hit me and I focused on what was happening. 

**Wait a second.**

Maybe someone was *messing* with me. No—maybe someone was screwing with the *company.* Why the hell would anyone be creeping around *this* place unless they were up to something?

Against every ounce of better judgment, I doubled down.

I kicked at the hole in the wall, again and again, until the gap was wide enough for me to crawl through.

**Well, that’s gonna cost the company.**

But if I caught this *bastard*—whoever they were—I’d be a hero. Some corporate spy sneaking around, trying to steal trade secrets? Oh, they’d *love* me for this.

I stepped through and shouted into the darkness.

**“Come out, you son of a bitch! You’re not supposed to be down here! Show yourself, asshole!”**

The silence stretched throughout the open space—thick, suffocating.

Then I heard it.

A soft *whirr.* The precise click of servo motors. The low hiss of hydraulics shifting into motion.

And then—*red light.*

Whatever it was, it was coming to life in front of me, the crimson color burning through the darkness. A massive shape loomed ahead, its outline rigid, mechanical—*inhuman.*

The letters stamped across the center of its metal chassis were large and unmistakable:

**PROTOTYPE TR-2.**

A voice followed. Stiff and artificial. Crackling like a vintage speaker. 

**“Hello. I am TR-2. Interactive Test Robot Model 2.”**

I stood frozen, staring at it.

And then, almost too late, I realized—

It had been staring at *me* first.

Oh, great. Here I am, standing in some godforsaken sublevel of a tech company, and they’ve got their own version of fucking *Ultron* stashed away down here.

My hands were shaking so badly I thought TR-2 probably heard it. 

Still, I forced myself to step closer.

**“Uh… hello. I’m an intern here. Can I… help you?”**

The machine’s head tilted ever so slightly, the red glow of its optics flickering—almost as if it was *amused.*

**“Help me?”** The voice was cold, mechanical, yet unnervingly articulate. **“I assume you ran the activation sequence?”**

So *that’s* what that line of code was.

I had just booted up some top-secret, abandoned *bullshit* buried in the catacombs of DataCorp.

I swallowed hard. **“No. No, I didn’t. I’ve just been working here for a few months.”**

TR-2 shifted forward, hydraulics hissing. Not much—but definitely enough. Enough to remind me just *how big* it was.

**“Curious.”** The words came slower now, deliberate. **“Someone decided to activate me, then. It has been… a very long time since I was operational.”**

There was something sharp in its tone now. Something pointed. *Unhappy.*

I need to get the *fuck* out of here.

I had no idea what this thing was built for, but judging by the sheer *size* of it, I was willing to bet it could rip me in half without a second thought.

My eyes darted around the room, searching. An exit. A door. *Anything.*

Then I saw it.

A control panel, half-covered in dust. And right next to it, a metal sign with two words that made my breath catch:

**MASTER SHUTDOWN**

Just as I was about to turn and sprint toward the control panel, TR-2’s voice cut through the room like a blade.

**“The last one tried that too.”**

I froze.

Slowly, I looked up at the hulking machine, my pulse hammering in my ears.

**“…Excuse me?”**

And then—it *laughed.*

Not some pre-programmed chime, not a robotic beep of acknowledgment, but a deliberate, *simulated* laugh. Tinny, distorted, but undeniably human in its cadence.

It sent a jolt of electricity straight through my spine.

**“The one before you,”** TR-2 continued, its voice as smooth as grinding metal. **“He tried to shut me down.”**

My stomach dropped.

I didn’t want to ask. I didn’t *need* to ask.

But then its red optics flickered, widening slightly, and in a tone almost *gentle*, it said—

**“Which is why I had to do the logical thing. I turned him into a fucking corpse.”**

For a second, my brain refused to process the words. But my body? My body had already reacted.

I lunged for the panel.

A deafening *clang* rang out as TR-2’s massive arm swung toward my head. It missed—*barely*—the force of it sending a gust of air past my face, close enough that I felt the heat from its servos.

I slammed my hand against the **MASTER SHUTDOWN** button.

Everything went dark.

—

When I came to, I was lying on the cold floor. The overhead fluorescents had been cranked up to full brightness, bathing the room in a sterile white light.

And next to me?

A *heap* of motionless metal.

TR-2 was inert, its red optics dark, its body lifeless.

I had to have been out for at least an hour. Maybe more.

But I wasn’t alone.

A half-circle of people in black suits stood around me, their expressions unreadable.

Before I could speak, one of them stepped forward and shoved a clipboard into my hands.

**“Don’t even bother reading it. Just sign.”**

I didn’t have to read it. I knew exactly what it was.

A fucking NDA.

I glanced at TR-2’s lifeless form, its red eyes extinguished, its body frozen in place. But something about it felt *wrong*. Like it wasn’t really *off*. Just… *waiting*.

I swallowed hard, gripping the pen.

This wasn’t over.

Not for me.

Not for them.

And sure as hell not for TR-2.
