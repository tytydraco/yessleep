Before I get into it, I should let any readers know that I’ll be changing the names of people and places in this account of my experiences with the hotel, including the hotels true name, that could turn into a big legal issue very fast. But none of that matters now, I just don’t want them to find me.

From when I’m writing this, a few months ago I was looking for a job around my hometown halfway through the summer. I was fresh out of high school, waiting for my online college course to begin in the fall, and just returned from a trip to New York City. 

My town isn’t a very big place, yes that’s cliché, but I’m serious, in fact, the entire surrounding area is pretty small. Naturally, there isn’t a lot to do. Mostly dumb teenagers getting into trouble, and if not that, an entire legacy of local drama and gossip going back decades, since there’s nothing better to do. With that said, there aren’t many places around to stay, sure you’ve got your run of the mill, beat up, pot infested motels, but no one wants to take their kids there. That’s where Blackwood comes in.

Blackwood was the only hotel around that had enough going for it to be considered somewhat classy. Events always being held there, an in house restaurant and bar, indoor pool with sauna and hot tub, the whole nine yards. Of course the public ate it up, constant rotation of guests in and out, using all the facilities. So when looking for a job, why wouldn’t I think of Blackwood? Unfortunately for me, the day I handed in my resume, was the day I signed my life over. 

It didn’t take long for them to call back. I’ve heard from others that they’re always desperate for new hires. Didn’t seem odd at the time. It’s a hotel, of course they’ll need lots of staff. 

Only two days after I returned from my New York trip I went in for the interview, and that’s where I met Loraine. She was the one who ran the hotel, and also who’d be interviewing me. 

“Good morning, Thomas, how are you?”

She said with a warm open smile. Loraine was an older woman, not greying yet, but out of her prime. Her deep brown shoulder length hair, slicked behind her hair, with a pair of glasses resting on her forehead. 

“I’m great. Yourself?” 

I said trying to be polite. I’d shown up wearing a dress shirt, and the nicest pants I could find. I looked straight out of an early 2000’s music video. 

“Things are wonderful here, I’m so glad you could make it. If you’d follow me to my office well start the interview” 

She led me down a little hall next to the front desk. I got a glance at the workers stationed there, and they seemed to be nice. Big smiles and upright posture. But as soon as they turned away, their smiles faded. Weird but whatever, I had to focus on the interview.

Loraine sat behind her desk and gestured for me to sit. I went along with it.

“Now, from your resume, you seem to be a good worker” 

Once again said with a smile. In fact, every time she spoke she smiled, even if she wasn’t happy. I didn’t pick up on that yet, and I wish I had.

“I try to get things done the best I can”

“And that’s all we ask of here. Now… what qualities would you say you have? Any special talents or traits?”

I looked around here room, hoping to think of something good. The room was decorated with generic office art and trinkets. The colours grey and beige everywhere. 

“I work well with a team, o-or by myself”

She gave me another smile. She could tell I was nervous.

“That’s wonderful, here at Blackwood, teamwork is an essential tool”

She scanned her computer screen, reading what seemed to be a checklist, clicking boxes here and there.

“Can you preform manual labour?”

“Yes, that’s no issue”

Yet again she smiled, every time less welcoming, I could tell it wasn’t genuine, but she still seemed to like me. More and more boxed checked off her list. 

“It looks like we have an opening for a porter position here, and you seem to be a perfect fit”

For those who don’t know, a porter is someone who will do the heavier lifting for the hotel staff. Setting up events, carrying luggage, but also cleaning, sweeping, etc 

“I’ll take it”

Those words I’d soon come to regret. Wishing I would have ran out of that office never looking back.

“Wonderful! When can you start?”

“Tomorrow”

“Ok then, you come in tomorrow at…uhhh.. let’s say 10, and we’ll get you trained”

She stood up and extended her hand, waiting for me to shake it. And you can probably guess that I did. 

I left her office, excited for my new job, but as I walked down that small hallway, a sense of dread came over me. It hit me like a bullet. There was no one in that hallway, no pictures, only a copying machine, and a water cooler. So why did I feel this overwhelming terror? Only time will tell.

I arrived at 10 sharp, yet again looking like Mike Ross from suits. I stepped inside the hotel and seen the same workers at the front desk as yesterday. I walked up to the desk and they turned their heads up and gave me big smiles.

“Hi! How can I help you!”

“I’m the new hire, I start today”

“Wonderful! Carter is waiting for you in the office back there!”

 She pointed to a closed door in the small hallway.

“Thanks”

“No problem! Have a great first day!”

Her smile dropped for a split second before immediately springing back up. Almost like a glitch. 

“Yea..”

I walked to the office thinking to myself “the fuck was that?” I opened the door to see a guy who was younger like me, taller, and bigger, but definitely open. 

“Hey, you must be Thomas right?”

“That’s me”

“Welcome to Blackwood, man, my name’s carter and I’ll show you the ropes of being a porter, and don’t worry, you’ll catch on quick”

Carter was a friendly guy, very down to earth and easy to talk to, he was taller than me, but younger, yet he never joked about it. I miss you Carter.

“I’ll show you the storage room’s first, they can be a bit much, but with me around, you’ll be fine”

“Lead the way”

Blackwood had three floors, the main level had your essentials of a hotel, front desk, main office, the restaurant, and some bedrooms, top floor was all rooms, and the bottom was mostly storage, and event rooms. It’s an easy format to remember, so it didn’t take long to memorize the building. 

Carter lead me down the stairs to the bottom floor, and after a short walk, we were infront of what he called “storage 2”. 

The doors to the room were large. Heavy grey doors that would slam every time if not handled carefully. And just like that, Carter reached down and opened them.
