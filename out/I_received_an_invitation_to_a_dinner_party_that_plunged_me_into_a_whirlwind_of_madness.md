The invitation came embossed with gold, promising an evening of unparalleled indulgence at the home of a man whose wealth was as vast as his reputation was mysterious. Yet, from the moment I crossed the threshold, I sensed that this was no ordinary gathering. The air was thick with anticipation, the dim light casting long shadows that seemed to move of their own accord.

As we sat down to the main course, a prime rib so perfectly cooked it seemed to glisten under the chandelierâ€™s soft glow, an unsettling feeling took root within me. The host approached the table, his blade gleaming in the dim light, a piece of cutlery so sharp it seemed to slice through the very air it moved through.

With each cut, the knife sang a macabre tune, 'shhhk, shhhk,' the sound chillingly clear amidst the din of conversation. The meat parted effortlessly under his skilled hands, the fibers of muscle giving way to reveal the dark, rich interior. Juices pooled beneath the blade, a dark, almost black ichor that seemed to absorb the light around it.

As he served, the host's eyes found mine, a glint of something unfathomable within their depths. His grin was too wide, his demeanor too animated, as if each slice of meat was a secret message meant only for me. The prime rib, once a symbol of culinary delight, now appeared as an offering to an ancient and insatiable hunger.

The meat seemed to whisper my name as it was placed before me, the fluids dribbling from its carved surfaces forming patterns that my mind struggled to ignore. The scent was intoxicating, a mixture of herbs and something else, something primal. As I ate, the taste was unlike anything I had ever experienced, rich and fulfilling, yet beneath it lay a hint of something far darker, an aftertaste of despair and longing.

The 'shhhk, shhhk' of the knife continued, a constant reminder of the thin line between nourishment and sacrifice. With each slice, the host's gaze intensified, as if he was peeling back the layers of my soul, exposing my innermost fears and desires.

The evening blurred into a nightmare, the laughter and chatter of the other guests fading into the background as I became consumed by the ritual unfolding before me. The air grew heavier, the shadows deeper, and somewhere in the recesses of my mind, I understood that this was no mere dinner party but a summoning, a communion with forces ancient and malevolent.

I left the party feeling as though I had been flayed open, my very essence laid bare by the host's blade. The drive home was a feverish rush, the night alive with unseen eyes and whispers carried on the wind. The image of the gleaming knife and the dark fluid seeping from the roast haunted me, a grotesque reminder of the evening's true nature.

But it was only when I reached the safety of my home that the true horror revealed itself. In the mirror, I saw not my reflection but a vision of the prime rib, the muscle filleted, the fluids dripping in an endless stream, and behind it all, the host's wide, eager grin.

Since that night, I cannot escape the feeling that I am being watched, that I am part of something far beyond my understanding. The 'shhhk, shhhk' follows me into sleep, into dreams where I am both the carver and the carved, trapped in an endless cycle of feast and famine.

The feast that night was more than a meal; it was an initiation, a baptism into a world where the boundary between life and death, pleasure and pain, is as ephemeral as the sound of a knife slicing through the darkness. And as I sit here, writing this, I know that the ritual is not yet complete, that the feast was only the beginning of a journey into the heart of darkness, from which there is no return.
