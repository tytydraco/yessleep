So it’s actually been a minute since this happened like a couple of years now, but I just never had any idea of how to actually go about talking about it. I had mad first sleep paralysis experience in my shitty apartment back in 2021. 

To preface this, I had a history of sleep walking. When I was younger I wet the bed until probably about 6. It was embarrassing and as a way to try to make myself get up when I had to pee I told myself every night to “get up and go to the bathroom” repeatedly until I fell asleep. While this helped with my bed wetting issue it turned into sleepwalking. As I got older I started to do it less and less until finally it stopped. Other than that I had no psychology induced sleep issues. Until that night. 

It was a few months into my now wife and I loving in our crappy little quadplex apartment. We had been trying to find a place to stay for a while and happened upon this place being just cheap enough and just safe-looking enough for us to decide to rent. We were however not privy to the fact that not even a month beforehand there was a domestic dispute and someone got shot and killed next door. We were less than thrilled but had already signed the lease and were trying to make it in a new town so we just kept to ourselves and did our best to stay safe. 

About a month in, what we thought could never happen to us -dumb kids as we were- happened: we got robbed. Someone had forced open the window to our bedroom had stolen what they could. We didn’t have much but they made out with all of our gaming stuff, my pc, PlayStation, and my wife’s switch. I called the police and filed a report and that night we stayed with our friends. Needless to say I was rather upset. Forget the fact that things I spent hundreds of dollars on was now missing, they took something I couldn’t get back and haven’t been able to fully find again since: my sense of security. 

We bought bars to put in the windows so that anyone trying to break in would have to break the glass to move the rod in order to pry the window open. That did little to ease my worry though. I knew anyone with a little determination could easily get in. After that I double and triple checked all the doors and windows before going to bed. If I thought I heard something in the apartment I would get up and check before checking everything again. That night I didn’t. 

I had had a little to drink and my wife and I decided to go to bed around 10 or so. I checked the doors and windows once like I always do and went to lay down. I sleep with a fan on me all night -sue me I’m southern- so I’m used to having it in my ear and as you may know when you’re tired your brain can play tricks on you, making you think you hear or see things that arent there. 

As I started to doze off I heard the usual, apartment settling, the fan rattling, the wind blowing. But then I thought I heard the front door. Normally I would have gotten up to check but I figured “Everything is fine. You’re just hearing things, there’s nothing ever there when you check anyways”. Then I heard it again. And again. In that instance I was trying to be rational. Assuring and reassuring myself nothing was there. I was drunk and tired and I just wanted sleep. 

I was just about to doze off when my body shook. I say shook but it’s more like it convulsed. Everything vibrated from my toes all the way up to my head and my breathing and heartbeat staggered. I thought I was dying or something and once I caught my breathe I realized I wasn’t as tired anymore so I might as well do my due diligence and check the damn apartment. But I couldn’t. 

I tried to roll myself over and into a sitting then standing position something I do all the time but my body didn’t respond. I wasn’t numb I could feel everything but it was like every muscle in my body was more worn out than ever and didn’t want to move me anywhere. Then I heard it again but this time I could tell it wasn’t my fan or any of the normal building sounds. It was the door and someone was trying to get in. I could hear them jiggling the doorknob and trying to force it open. I had to move or my wife and I will be sitting ducks for whoever decided to break into our home our sanctuary the one place we’re meant to feel safe and secure. 

The sound grew louder and louder and it felt like they could be inside any second. I tried everything I could to move. I was trying as hard as I could but my body would not obey. I was laying on my bad with my head facing away from our bedroom door and away from my wife and suddenly over the commotion I heard her voice. “Who’s at the door,” she whispered in my ear. “I don’t know,” I cried trying to force my head over to face her.  

The words came out more like a croak or a whimper and I couldn’t even tell if they had actually slipped out of the side of my unmoving mouth or if it was in my head. She whispered again, “who’s at the door?” and all I could respond with was “I don’t know”. Over and over she asked, and over and over I replied the best I could but nothing would do what I told it to. 

Her voice grew louder and the door sounded like the hinges the lock the knob were all in shambles. The walls seemed like they were shaking and I couldn’t do anything. At that point someone getting in wasn’t what scared me it was not being able to do anything about it if they did. Everything got louder and louder and louder until finally I could moved my hand again and my arms and then my legs and I gasped as I was finally in control again and I shot upright in bed sweating bullets. Then there was silence. 

The walls were still. I couldn’t hear anything from outside our room. All there was was the fan next to me. I looked over to check on my wife and I got cold. She was on the other side of the bed rolled away from me and asleep. She had never woken up or talked to me at all. I sat there for a second to catch my breath trying to get a grip back on reality. 

After a minute of quiet I decided I should get up and check the apartment. Everything was locked and nothing was out of place but I sat up for a little longer just to be safe. I finally got tired enough to sleep again so I checked for the last time and went back to bed. The next morning I talked to my wife about what happed and she was none the wiser. 

I know people usually see some terrifying entity when they have sleep paralysis but whatever was talking to me in my wife’s stead never showed its face. Needless to say though, I always got up to check if I thought I heard something, and to this day I still do.
