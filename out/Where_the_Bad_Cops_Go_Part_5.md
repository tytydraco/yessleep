The following Monday, I was called in to have a meeting with the sheriff. I could tell it was a serious conversation; there was very little in the way of jokes and jabs. Instead I was asked, politely, to sit down. I knew there was gonna be trouble. Sheriff Mason leaned back in his chair with a sigh.

“Heard you almost got Nick killed,” he said. “He ain’t happy about it.”

He tapped the answering machine on his desk. Who the hell even has one of those anymore?

“Maybe we ought to deal with the deeper issues first,” I countered. “Like that thing at the school collecting heads.”

“You think we oughta do something about that, huh? Well little miss krispy kreme, there’s a whole lot of sugar goin’ round this town, and I ain’t got enough pac mans to gobble it all.”

He got out of his chair and painstakingly walked around his desk, sitting down next to me. I could smell the beard oil from his walrus mustache.

“You ain’t even scratched the surface yet. But you gotta calm down. And for you to calm down, I gotta pull you off patrol.”

 

Nick was paired up with a twitchy guy named Reggie. Reggie was in his early 40’s and had the shape of a badly drawn stick figure with a receding hairline. Apparently, he’d been working dispatch for three years, and now I was supposed to take over his position. I was to work on the phones back at the station for the foreseeable future.

I was put at a desk with a slightly newer computer, a headset, and a chatty coworker. The first time I met Charlotte, or Charlie for short, she was handling something I can only dream of understanding. The conversation went a little something like this;

“Sir. Sir! SIR! I don’t care how many arms you’ve found, you put them right back where you find them. And don’t go planting them like trees, that’s disrespectful.”

 

Charlie was energetic; like a cooped-up parakeet. She had trouble sitting still and wandered back and forth whenever she could afford to stretch her legs. She looked to be no more than 20, maybe 25, but she was closer to 40 and had two kids back home. The only thing that kinda gave it away was her nails. You could tell she used her hands a lot.

She introduced me to a lot of the basic systems. How to see and handle phone queues, what to take down on reports, standard protocols, that kinda stuff. I spent the first few days just watching her do the job and then slowly getting easier calls redirected to me.

Now, while we were officially taking calls for things like tips and wellness checks, we also got calls from the DUC people that the sheriff was working for. We had simple instructions when dealing with them; don’t ask questions. We were to do as we were told, and if we couldn’t, we patched them through to the sheriff.

 

As March dipped into April, I was getting pretty good at it. I had effectively replaced Reggie, who I could see drop by the station every now and then with Nick following suit. I tried to talk to them a couple of times, but Nick wasn’t having it. Reggie seemed like an eager puppy, just happy to get some attention, so every attempt I made to patch things up with Nick got swallowed up. I brought in donuts? Reggie was happy to talk about it, while Nick silently grabbed one in the background. I refilled the coffee machine? Reggie was happy to grab a cup, while Nick filled up his thermos. Every conversation starter I tried got derailed.

It was one of those times that prompted my first real conversation with Charlie. It was a dull Tuesday afternoon in between calls. Charlie was busy trying to make sense of her kid’s schedule for the week, scratching her head as she scrolled up and down on a second-hand iPad.

“What you doin’ out here anyway?” she asked. “You killed someone?”

“Why’d you ask?”

“Most folks that get here done do some dumb shit they can’t take back.”

“Sorta,” I nodded. “But I ain’t killed anyone.”

“You wanted to?”

“Wanted to what?”

“Kill someone.”

It was a strange question to be asked so casually. I just tilted my head at her, giving her a questioning look.

“Look, all’s I’m sayin’ is that if you gotta get deported to dipshit nowhere, population whatever, you might as well get your money’s worth. Whatever you did oughta get you somethin’, is all.”

I shook my head at her.

“It got me nothing.”

Charlie lit up with a grin, leaning across the room with her knuckles out. I tapped them.

“Fucked if we do, fucked if we don’t.”

 

Most of the calls I got were completely harmless. Someone locking themselves out of their house. A worried neighbor spotting a dog in a car. I even got the cat stuck in a tree call once.

But there were a couple of strange calls too. Most of them came from the DUC; the strange men-in-black kinda people that sheriff Mason had called in at the start of the year. One time they called in to check if anyone had reported any strange aerial sightings. Giant birds or insects, stuff like that. When I told them we hadn’t had anything like that, they hung up on me.

I got a few calls like that, most of them harmless or nonsensical. But given the kind of calls we could get from ordinary folks in Tomskog, it wasn’t that unusual.

 

Things took a pretty drastic turn when I got what seemed like a harmless call. By then, Charlie wasn’t patching them through to me or routing them; we had a 50-50 split on calls. Gave her more time to check her Facebook. I got a call from an older woman that I’d never talked to before. I didn’t recognize the name, but I could see she was registered to a Tomskog address.

“My son got me eight rubber ducks for my bathroom,” she explained. “But when I walked in this morning, there were twelve.”

“I’m sorry, what… there are too many rubber ducks, is that it?”

“Yes, I don’t know where they came from,” she explained. “I think someone broke in.”

“I see.”

I looked over at Charlie. Her ears must’ve perked up at ‘rubber duck’. She mouthed a silent ‘what the hell’ at me, and I just shrugged.

“Ma’am, unless this is some sort of immediate threat, I’ll ask to see if a patrol can stop by to look for damages later today. Please take some time to check the locks on your windows, alright?”

“I’m sorry,” the old woman laughed. “I’m sure it sounds ridiculous. But I’ve checked again and again, and there’s just… there’s too many of them.”

“Alright, I’ll see what we can do. You have a nice day now.”

 

According to our systems, one of our units was available. Seeing as how there was nothing else to do at the moment, I tagged them on the radio.

“Unit 115, this is dispatch, do you copy?”

“Nick here, whaddaya got?”

I was a bit startled. I hadn’t talked to the guy in weeks.

“Hey Nick,” I continued. “You doing alright?”

“Yeah,” he cut me short. “What’s the sitch?”

I explained the situation to him. He could barely keep himself from laughing, but I guess he figured anything was better than babysitting the Digman’s on yet another stakeout. So I got him and Reggie to check the old woman and her mysterious rubber ducks.

 

Now, this seemed innocent at the time. Just a fun anecdote. I spent most of that day talking to Charlie about everything ang nothing. She smoked at her desk, but she sat next to a window and was kind enough to tilt her head out when she exhaled. It was a nasty habit, but at least she smoked menthols. She loved the rubber duck story and had all kinds of follow-up questions about it. Her kids would definitely hear about it at family dinner – guaranteed.

Then she got a call. It was probably three, maybe four hours after the rubber duck call. I could tell it was serious; Charlie put out her cigarette and leaned forward, taking notes. She was talking to the DUC – they were the only ones who called in that Charlie never questioned.

As soon as the call ended, she ran up to the front doors and locked them. Then she started to go down the side of the room, checking that every window was closed and secured.

“Check the windows,” she said. “We gotta lock up.”

“What’d they say?”

“They said they’d get back to us. But until they do, we gotta lock up, and nothing gets in.”

 

We checked every room and made sure it was all locked up. There was no one else around, just me and Charlie. It was that time of day when the sun started to set, freezing an icy sheet over the melting snow outside; giving a crackling noise to every footstep. Temperatures were dipping fast, and even inside the station we had to put on jackets to keep the heat up. The radiators hadn’t worked for months. I decided to power through.

The next call that came through was routed to me. It was one of the DUC folks – you could tell by the extension on their phone. As soon as I clicked that receiver, the voice on the other end came through.

“Did you secure the station?”

“Yes, we… we locked all of it.”

“You need to take inventory,” he said. “Everything larger than a fist. Write it all down. Every single item, even if it is nailed to the wall.”

“That’s gonna take hours.”

“Then it’ll have to take hours!” he snapped back. “And when you’re done, you’re gonna do it again! And if a single thing on that list is out of line, you call me on this number *immediately!*”

If it is one lesson I’d taken away from my run-in at the high school with Nick, it was to not stick my nose where it didn’t belong. This seemed like one of those times. I dry-swallowed my questions.

“Alright,” I said. “But we’re getting overtime.”

 

Charlie and I armed ourselves with notepads and divvied up the rooms. She’d take the bullpen and front desk, I’d take the break room. She’d take the bathrooms, I’d take the locker room. Then we had two interview rooms, the sheriff’s office, an evidence room and a conference room. This was gonna take hours – possibly long into the night. Especially if they were serious about us doing it twice.

I was halfway through checking the break room when I saw one of the squad cars coming back. It wasn’t Nick and Reggie, but two of the others. They stopped outside, gave us a curious look through the windows, and called out to me.

“Y’all doing alright in there?”

“Yeah,” I nodded. “Peachy.”

“There’s some weird shit going on,” they continued. “Check if something’s outta place.”

“But why?”

“I dunno,” they shrugged. “But we got a stab victim who says the last thing he remembers is noticing he had too many radios. I dunno what to make of that.”

“You don’t get stabbed for having too many radios.”

“I dunno what to tell ya’.”

 

 It was dull work. Dull, dull, dull. Charlie put on some of her playlist through the speaker system just to make the hours pass. I didn’t take her for a honky tonk kind of woman, but by the second Dolly Parton album I figured she wasn’t sarcastic. Noting every little thing, only to know I had to cross-reference it later, was exhausting. It’s one thing to have a lot of work to do, but to know you’re gonna have to do it again just drains you.

I was using a master key to check every locker, one by one. I was going on autopilot to the point where I was barely paying attention to what I was looking at, or who’s locker I was checking. I was humming along to ‘Backwoods Barbie’ when something in my brain clicked. I was checking my own locker, running my hands over my jacket. I knew what was in this locker already, there was no point in checking every little bit of it.

But taking a step back, something didn’t add up. I shook my head, squinted a little, and looked again. I could see my jacket there; one of those brown pilot-like jackets with a ruffled collar. Comfiest thing I’d ever owned.

But there were two of them.

*There shouldn’t be two of them.*

 

“Charlie?” I called out. “Come here for a sec.”

She trotted over, still humming along to the music. She knew every word by heart.

“What’s up?”

“You see two jackets in that locker?” I asked.

She walked up to me and checked the locker. She nodded.

“Yup, that’s two.”

“There shouldn’t be. That’s my jacket. I only have one jacket.”

We just stood there for a bit, staring at the open locker. I couldn’t tell which one was which; the jackets were identical. One of them wasn’t mine. Charlie was the first to snap out of it, closing the locker with a smack.

“Hold it shut,” she said. “I’ll get the duct tape.”

 

We taped up the locker, just to be safe. Then we sealed off the entire locker room and retreated to the bullpen. I made the call to the DUC while Charlie called back home to tell her family she’d be running late. I got an answer on the first ring.

“There’s an extra jacket in my locker,” I said. “Is that bad?”

“And you didn’t put it there?”

“I did not put it there.”

“Then it’s bad,” the voice on the other end sighed. “Have you found anything else?”

“Not yet, no.”

“Good,” he continued. “Settle in one room, lock the rest.”

“Why? What’s going on?”

The question just slipped out of me. I knew better than to ask the DUC for clarification, but I couldn’t help myself.

 

There were a few seconds of silence. The voice came back a little lower, more thoughtful.

“Did you have any coffee today?”

“What does that have to-“

“It’s relevant. Did you have any coffee today?”

“Yeah, at, uh… at lunch.”

“Do you take milk? Sugar?”

“Both, yeah.”

“And you’re feeling okay?”

I looked down at myself, as if expecting to see something unusual. I was fine, of course.

“Yeah,” I said. “I’m fine.”

“Then we can eliminate one factor. The most probable issue here is a flare-up of something that shouldn’t be here. Something must’ve provoked them. There’s gonna be a lot of them popping up around town tonight, but if we’re lucky they might pass us by.”

“You make it sound like… bad weather.”

“There are similarities,” he sighed. “Now stay by your station. We’re switching to secure channels.”

 

Charlie and I locked it all. Just to make sure, we taped the edges. We ran out of duct tape and had to resort to packing tape and evidence tape. Soon, the entire station looked like a crime scene. Charlie and I hunkered down in the bullpen; the room where we spent most of our time. About an hour later, the power went out.

It’s a strange feeling watching a familiar location through a new light. The bullpen usually had these sterile fluorescent lamps. I’d never seen the station in the dark before; these things were always on. Charlie and I checked our flashlights, sending bright beams swaying across the room. The speakers went silent, giving Dolly a rest for now.

“Might be the breakers,” Charlie said. “I could go check.”

“You think that’s a good idea?”

“Nah,” she sighed. “But I *could* do it.”

“Bet you could.”

We stayed put. When there was nothing left inside to grab our attention, we turned outwards.

 

We could see buildings down the street were still powered, so this had to be something local. Charlie was probably right about it being a breaker problem. Maybe a burnt fuse. But we were not about to test the DUC and their recommendations; we were staying put and waiting for the cavalry.

Time passed slower than usual. I was a bit worked up, and hours started to feel like days. Time was about 9pm when I snapped to attention as Charlie called me over. She pointed out the window, shining her flashlight on something.

A rocking horse. A red rocking horse, one of those old-timey toys that kids used to get. It was just standing there in the middle of the snow.

“That wasn’t there before,” she said. “And unless I’m missin’ out on some TikTok prank shit, that has no earthly business being there.”

“Yeah, but… it’s just a toy.”

“Is it?”

We looked at it for a couple of minutes, shining our lights at it from different angles. Sure, it was just a toy, but someone must’ve put it there. Toys didn’t move on their own. And that thought made those lifeless white eyes all the more menacing, as the wind slowly pushed it into a gentle sway.

 

Charlie and I tried to keep it cool, but I could tell she wasn’t okay. Maybe she just needed a cigarette. As the clock reached 10pm, she had to take a bathroom break. We didn’t know what to look for, and we had sealed off the bathrooms, but if you gotta go, you gotta go. I stood guard outside. A couple of minutes passed, then she came back out.

“Fuck it, I’m having a smoke.”

Following her back to the bullpen, she removed some of the tape from a window and cracked it open. The evidence tape fluttered in the wind, like a dancing ribbon. Looking outside, I could see that the rocking horse was gone. Charlie didn’t seem all too bothered by it. I started to doubt myself. I mean, maybe I was just looking in the wrong place?

 

Charlie cracked the window a bit further and lit a cigarette, leaning back in her chair. I sat back down at my desk, grabbing a couple tic tacs from the top drawer. But as I looked back up at Charlie, something tickled my brain. She blew the smoke right into the room. Last time she’d smoked, she’d leaned her head out the window.

She smiled a little as she noticed me looking her way. She raised her golden and white pack at me.

“You want one?”

“I don’t smoke.”

“Right,” she nodded. “Fair enough.”

She was still doing it. Something about her demeanor was different. I thought back on my locker, and the two jackets I’d seen. There could be two of something. Could that go for people?

 

I excused myself and made a hasty retreat to the bathroom. Charlie shot out of her seat, flicking her cigarette across the room.

“Hey!” she called out. “Hey, wait!”

I ignored her. I entered the bathroom, and as I did, I looked back at Charlie through a sliver in the closing door.

She looked taller. Her eyes had a tint of blue.

As I closed and locked the door, I heard a muffled laugh, then a couple of footsteps.

Then – nothing.

 

The bathroom was just two stalls and a sink. Both doors were closed. I moved past the first stall, and stopped. There was a strange noise. Doubling back, I could see I’d stepped in blood; leaving red prints on the textured floor.

I opened the first stall door to find Charlie splayed out on the floor.

She was bleeding, but alive. She was clutching her chest and losing color, taking shallow breaths. It looked like she had a punctured lung. That would explain how she hadn’t been able to call for help. I didn’t even want to consider what this might mean, and what I’d just talked to outside.

“Take it easy,” I said, getting down on my knees. “Take it easy. I got this. You’re good.”

“You… you…” Charlie wheezed. “…you were already in… in here.”

“Wasn’t me, Charlie,” I assured her. “And that ain’t you outside.”

I got a plastic card from my wallet. An organ donor card, of all things. Charlie still had a roll of duct tape. I had Charlie move her hand from the wound as I opened her shirt. It was just a small puncture wound, no bigger than a pencil. I put the plastic card over the wound, taping the sides. That way air could go out on exhale, but would be sealed on the intake. That ought to give her some time.

I helped her sit up with her back against the toilet to relieve pressure from the wound. She wasn’t moving anytime soon.

“We gotta call for help,” I said. “Where’s your phone?”

“Won’t… won’t work.”

“Of course it’ll work, what are you-“

I stopped to think about it. All emergency calls in this area was rerouted directly back to us. Usually I’d be able to call directly on the other units, but the DUC had changed us to secure channels. That meant a strict chain of communication, accessible to us only through the dispatch station. We could use our radios, but that would just patch us back to our desks.

There was also my phone. Looking through it, I realized I didn’t have that many numbers saved. I had the number for the sheriff’s office, and Nick, but that was it. I gave Nick’s number a go, but it went straight to voicemail. I figured he’d either left the thing in his locker or turned it off. Or maybe he’d blocked me.

There was only one real option to call for help. I had to get to my station in the bullpen.

 

Charlie was gonna be okay for a little bit. The bleeding wasn’t that bad, and as long as she didn’t strain herself she could last a couple of hours.

“I’m getting help,” I said. “Take slow breaths. Stay upright. Use more tape if it gets soaked.”

“It… took my cigs,” she said. “Why… why the hell…”

“Might be a good time to quit,” I smiled back.

“…never.”

I got out and closed the door. I got my gun, turned the safety off, readied myself, and left the bathroom.

 

There was no one out there. Holding my flashlight in front of me, I scanned back and forth.

“If anyone’s out there, you better let me know!” I called out.

There was no answer. Of course there wasn’t. Instead, as I rounded the corner to the bullpen, my jaw dropped. Every single window, and the front door, was wide open. Evidence tape fluttered in the crosswind. There was a whole bunch of junk at the far end of the room. A trash can, a couple of empty water jugs, a couple of speakers, trash bags, a pile of shoes… just garbage, and plenty of it. There were a handful of items on the desks too that didn’t belong. I tried to keep my eyes on all of it, but there was just no way. It was everywhere.

I got to my desk and tapped the space bar, waking up the system. I put on my headset and briefly looked down to find the number for the DUC guy that called earlier, and with the flick of a wrist I pressed ‘re-dial’. I looked back up as the first tone came through.

The moment he answered, I noticed that red rocking horse right in the middle of the room. There was no way that thing had just been there.

 

“Something got in,” I said the moment he picked up. “There’s junk, like… all over.”

“Keep your eye on it. Retreat to a safe location.”

“We got an officer down,” I said. “Something stabbed her. We need an ambulance.”

“We got two units on-route. Can you hold out?”

“Maybe. We’re holed up in the bathroom.”

“Get in, keep the doors closed, and wait for us.”

I blinked. The red rocking horse was closer. It was a full two feet closer just from the blink of an eye.

 

I jumped back a little. Luckily, my headset was wireless. It had shitty connection though; I could barely go to the other room before I got interference. There was no way I could get all the way to the bathroom without breaking the connection. But I had to try.

I backed off, forcing my eyes open. It’s one thing to accidentally stare at something until your eyes hurt, but to consciously think about it is excruciating. There’s no way. I could feel the salty sweat pearls on my brow grow bigger and drip down the side of my nose.

Blink.

Everything was different. The rocking horse was gone. Garbage bags were cardboard boxes. The empty water jugs were cinder blocks. The wide-open windows invited a howling April wind rushing through the room, grabbing hold of important papers and tossing them across the floor.

 

“They’re acting on instinct,” the DUC man continued. “They don’t wanna be where they are. They wanna be where we are. But they can’t be. They don’t belong. So they try to be us.”

“What the hell does that mean?”

“It means they can’t find a shape that fits them, so they try to take ours. They’re gonna be climbing on top of one another to get to you, and if they do, you’re gone. Your friend there probably just got a love tap. They tested you.”

My back bumped against the bathroom door as the connection broke. My flashlight flickered, and as it did, the lights came back to a different room. For a brief moment I was looking at a room of Charlie’s.

20, maybe 25 of her. All with the same lifeless expression. All but one – the one with a pack of cigarettes.

In the back, a couple of them looked like me.

 

I threw myself inside the bathroom and locked the door. These things were fast. They had been at least seven feet away, but within the blink of an eye I’d felt something brushing against the back of my head. A couple of strands of hair came loose, slowly twirling to the floor. As I locked the door something slammed against it. Hard enough to make a point, but not hard enough to make the hinges buckle.

I opened the stall door to find Charlie struggling. She wasn’t worse off, at least. She had her gun up in my direction but had the trigger discipline not to take the shot.

“…oughta knock first,” she whispered. “…this is… private.”

I got in there with her, closing the stall door and sinking to the floor. I could hear them outside, digging through the rooms. They weren’t even pretending anymore, they were freely running about. When there’d been just one, they had to play along, but now there were dozens.

“You seen these before?” I asked.

“…seen all kinds,” she said. “…but not that.”

“I remember you asking me about what I did to, uh… to get here,” I said. “Who I’d killed.”

“…yeah?”

“What’d you do?”

 

I said it a bit too loud. Outside the door, I could hear muffled echoes of my voice. A torrent of ‘what’d you do’. They were trying to match my voice. My heart rate spiked, sending a cold spike into my fingertips as my heart struggled to remain calm.

“…fell in love with the wrong kinda man, but got the right kinda kids,” she smiled. “…then things just… worked out.”

 “He with them now?” I asked. “Or you got a babysitter?”

I was trying to keep her mind focused on something but the homicidal things outside that door, and asking about her family always seemed to brighten her day.

“…Keith passed some years ago,” she sighed. “…never the fatherin’ type to begin with.”

“Sorry to hear that.”

“…the Digman’s are a shitty family, I’ll tell you that.”

 

There was a banging on one of the windows outside. Someone was calling in. I got up and out of the stall, leaning against the bathroom door. It was Nick. It was faint, but it was him.

“Use the fire exit, through the locker room!” he called out. “We got you!”

I put down my gun and hurried back to Charlie. We worked out a plan. It was stupid, but it was all we had.

 

I carried her, bridal style, while she watched my back with her service weapon. It was far from ideal, but we didn’t have far to go. We had to try – she was getting weaker. Besides, if Nick and the others were here, maybe they’d already secured the back exit.

Carrying Charlie, I bent down to have her open the lock. I counted down from three, feeling my mouth get drier by the syllable. The moment the mechanism clicked, I kicked the door open.

There were voices. Some mine, some hers; like a weird echo chamber. I didn’t look any other way but the locker room as four shots rang out, silencing a handful of voices from the bullpen.

 

I burst through the locker room door. There were jackets and garbage all over the floor, but I kept going. I could feel something sharp scratch against the bottom of my pants, like blunted knives not quite making it through the fabric. Charlie took two more shots as something vaguely human stepped out of a locker. I pressed on.

Kicking open the fire escape door, I expected an alarm to go off. That thing ought to have been on backup power, but something must’ve been cut. I went straight out the back; an open area covered in crisp powder snow. To my surprise, I saw Nick. He was already there.

“Keep going, I got you!” he said, pointing straight ahead.

He had his hand on his hip, ready to draw his weapon. I turned left, heading towards the parking lot, but he stopped me.

“No!” he interrupted. “Straight ahead! Just keep going!”

 

I followed his instructions for twenty or so feet, only to realize I was about to head straight into the woods. There were no roads in this direction, and there was nowhere to park an ambulance. Why’d he want me to go there?

In the distance, I could see two squad vehicles coming down the road. Number 114 and 115; the latter being Nick’s vehicle.

I turned back towards him, still holding Charlie. Without looking away, I whispered at her.

“Are there pictures of the other officers down at the station?”

“…yeah, in the break room,” she said. “…from that one time we got a polaroid.”

Looking a bit closer, this Nick seemed a little off. His hair was longer. His eyes were straighter. And those shades were almost white; like they were still reflecting a light coming from ahead. His voice was a bit off, like the static of an answering machine. And the hand on his hip, well… there was no service weapon there.

“That’s not Nick.”

 

I slowly put down Charlie and raised my weapon. Looking off to the side, I could see someone coming through the woods. There were footsteps coming from the other side as well. We were being surrounded.

Charlie wasn’t wasting time. She put four shots in the Nick-thing, and it ran screaming like a popped balloon back into the station. That shrieking noise had some strange cadence to it, grinding like a raw saw blade on my inner ear. It hurt to listen to, making me nauseous. Charlie put two more shots into something flanking from our left and reloaded. I followed her example.

We didn’t stop for anything. A cardboard box? Two shots. A barrel? Two more shots. Everything that was there, that shouldn’t be there, got tapped twice.

 

Then there was me. An identical copy of me, and what I looked like right at this moment. Only with a slight tinge of blue to their eyes.

It felt like looking into a mirror. She didn’t look angry, or threatening. She looked content, like she’d just stepped out of a shower. She didn’t run, she didn’t scream. She just casually walked my way, holding up an empty hand to show that she meant no harm.

Again, Charlie wasn’t having it. Two shots; chest and head.

The image distorted. My face grew long and disjointed as the back curled like a wounded insect. The arms shrunk into two dagger-like bone knobs sticking out of what would be the hand joints. As the jaw extended past her midriff, all I could think of was a melting plastic toy.

Then it, too, ran screeching into the wilds.

 

Something got a hold of Charlie.

She screamed, and by the time I turned around she’d been dragged eight feet. I couldn’t tell by what; there was nothing there. She had another puncture wound in her shoulder. She pointed her gun my direction, and I dove out of the way. She hit something that was coming up behind me. I crawled back to her on all fours, ending up back to back so we could check all directions at once.

She was barely breathing. I was having trouble breathing with two lungs, I couldn’t imagine what she was experiencing with just one. Her head was swaying back and forth like a bobblehead.

“…I’m out,” she whispered.

“I got eight left,” I said. “You see something?”

“…I dunno. Maybe.”

 

Another me, crawling out of the bushes at full speed on all fours.

Two shots.

A Charlie running out of the locker room, screeching like a wounded animal.

Two shots.

That damn red rocking horse, just eight feet away.

Two more shots.

A strange amalgamation came around the side of the building. It looked like someone had taken the picture of sheriff Mason and dragged it out. I realized it was probably trying to copy one of the blurry photos in the break room, as I could tell the vague outline of a birthday party hat; but it was all organic.

I just looked at it for a while, trying to figure out what was supposed to be what. A badge dragged out across the chest like an oval membrane, our blue and black uniform fabric; hairy like a spider’s abdomen. The face a hollow mockery, like a misshaped tree stump, only guesstimating the proportions of a man.

Two more shots, and it climbed back in through a window; a pile of strange colors and textures making their way back in.

 

Then, another Nick.

I raised my gun, and it clicked. I was out.

 

He looked down at me with this shocked expression on his face; his pink sunglasses almost rolling off the edge of his nose.

“What the fuck, rook?”

“Nick?”

Without a second thought, he whistled. I could see Reggie bounding through the snow in the distance, along with two paramedics who’d stopped further down the road. I could hear sirens.

“Put that shit away and help me,” said Nick. “We gotta move her.”

 

It was a group effort, but we got Charlie to an ambulance. As more and more officers and DUC officials came back, I could tell everyone’d had a rough night. Reggie was busy telling his wife about his heroics over the phone; how he’d helped carry a wounded woman to an ambulance. Others were screaming over the radio to check other locations. Some were just looking for ammunition.

I ended up leaning against the hood of squad car 115, watching the station in the distance. It was getting cold, but I had a feeling I’d never see my favorite jacket again. Nick was sitting in the open driver’s seat, leaning out the door with a gas station hot dog in his hands. Seconds later, I could see men dressed in all-protective white, lighting up flamethrowers. They were dousing the entire station in fire.

Nick poked me with his elbow. Looking back at him, he offered me a candy bar.

“Figured you had to skip dinner,” he said. “You alright?”

“No.”

“I get it.”

The silence settled. I could hear screeching in the distance as vaguely humanoid shapes ran burning out of the building. There were these popping noises, like wet balloons. I sunk my teeth into the candy bar, only to realize how dry my mouth was. I could barely taste it.

“I think they’re moving us to the fire station,” Nick continued. “We did that a couple years ago during renovations.”

“Gonna need a lot more than a fresh coat of paint for this one,” I added.

The roof caved in, as if to accentuate my point.

“Looks like it.”

I looked down on my phone, then back at Nick. A thought crossed my mind.

“Did you block my number?”

“Should I?”

“Nah,” I said, shaking my head. “Just checking.”

 

As the flames reached higher, the screeching stopped. The station was gone. Somewhere in there, my jacket was turning into smoldering coal. I wondered if things had been different if I’d just reported those rubber duck things to the DUC right away. The town of Tomskog can really throw you for a loop – the slightest thing can mean the end of the world.

But you can’t be afraid of everything, all the time. You just gotta roll with the punches.

Fucked if you do, fucked if you don’t.
