Ever since I was a kid, I've always wanted to swim in the lake near our neighborhood. But when I always tried to sneak out to swim in the lake, there would always be men wearing black guarding the lake. When I would approach them they would scold me and carry me back to my house. Until I was 21, I decided to take another path towards the lake.   


This path was in the nearby woods, me and my friends were always camping there so I knew the pathways. I texted my 2 friends, Elijah and Christopher. Since we were kids we always wanted to go and swim in the lake. So we planned to go through the path at 3AM. When the time came I packed my swimming suit in my bag and brought my dad's flashlight with me. We decided to meet in the entrance of the woods. I decided to ride my bike towards the entrance of the woods. When I got there, Elijah and Christopher were already there waiting for me.  


 We entered the woods and  after a few minutes we were already there. I changed into my swimming clothes and dived in the lake. After a few minutes I got hungry and asked Elijah if I could eat some of the chips he brought. He agreed and I sat in the shallow part of the lake and decided to eat the chips. Then I heard a loud wail under the water. I went to my bag and took out my flashlight and aimed the light towards a big shadow underneath the water. Then after a few minutes it stood up on two legs. It looked like a human and it was carrying a violin. Then, it started playing it.  


 The music was soothing. And then I turned around to see if Elijah and Christopher were still there. But they were gone. I looked back at the creature, but it's face was closer now. Then it dragged my leg towards the water. I screamed and tried to escape and then I saw it's face underwater. And my flight or fight response came. And I punched it's face. Then without a moment to waste, I ran towards the shallow part of the lake and took the flash light and ran away. While I was running away, I heard a soothing music. But I didn't care and just ran. Leaving my back pack and when I was in the entrance of the woods I rode my bike fast as I could. Until I reached my house.  


 The time was now 5AM, I was lost in by the music of the creature that I forgot the time. Thankfully my parents were still asleep. And I went back to my room. I texted my friends about them leaving me. And they responded to me that they were scared of the creature and decided to flee. I decided to sleep. When it was 7AM I quickly prepared my school uniform and made myself toasted bread. I went outside to my bike and when I reached the main entrance of the lake where the men in black were. One of them spoke to me in a low voice:  


'' You went to the lake didn't you.''  
I gulped and then he spoke again:  
'' Listen son, don't ever come back to this lake again. There are creatures you don't know of.''
