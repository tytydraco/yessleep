Her profile did not mention that she was training to be a nun so you can imagine my surprise when I discovered the address given to me was a monastery.

I had half a mind to turn around because I was sure I had the wrong place, however just as I was about to leave the woman from the app came out of the front door and waved me in.

She explained that she and the others there were a week away from taking their final vows, officially becoming nuns. However before that they were going to have a huge celebration and do all the things that nuns were forbidden to do: Including drugs and sex. 

The interior of the nunnery was one part pious, one part S&M orgy and one part Eyes Wide Shut. As weird as this was, I was totally into it. I mean, I’ve had freaky and kinky one night stands before but in my imagination none of them had anything on repressed nuns.

As the night of carnal delights went on, the nuns were quick to fill up our glasses of wine. Luckily though, I didn't drink. Instead I was doing a trick that I learned during highschool parties to make it look like I was drinking by holding onto a glass and exchanging it for an empty cup when I came across one.

As we grazed at the buffet table the nuns would crack very X rated jokes. Because the jokes were coming from soon to be nuns the jokes were even funnier. 

When the nuns took one of their drunken guests to another room I didn't think much of it. At the time I figured it was so they could have sex, however, after a time I noticed that none of the guests were returning.

Curious to see what kind of kinky sex acts were going on in the basement, I snuck away from the party and made my way down to the basement where I heard the sound of laughter. Following the sound led me to a large wooden door that I silently opened to peek inside. That's when I learned that these nuns were not satisfied with just the sins of sex and drugs, they also wanted to dabble in murder.

Hanging upside down from the ceiling were the bodies of the guests, their major arteries slit open so the blood could collect in large metal tubs. 

I ran up the steps as fast as I could, however when I tried to warn everyone I was hyperventilating and was so scared that I sounded like an insane person with asthma.

I didn't stick around to spell it out to them, I wanted to get out of there.

When I got to an area with cell reception I tried calling the police, however they did not believe me when I told them what happened and didn't even bother looking into it.
