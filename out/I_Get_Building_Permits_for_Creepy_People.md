My city is not an easy place to get a building permit.



It shouldn’t be.



The city is like a giant trap door for structures. It sits on a fault line. It borders a lake and is blanketed daily in mold-inducing fog. The houses are so close together that one house fire can wipe out a neighborhood. And the entire city is built on trash. A literal landfill. But nevertheless, it’s a pretty city and it wants to stay that way. So, successfully getting a building permit here requires a deft touch.



That’s why I have a job. I’m a permit expediter. I know this city’s permitting process like a maze I could run in my sleep. I know which city planners are a good fit for which construction projects, and which planners to avoid. I know which building inspectors are pragmatists and which ones treat the building code like scripture. And for this knowledge, property owners pay me the consulting fees that comprise my income.



I’m not the only permit expediter in town. Not even close. But I am unique. Because I’ll take the projects that nobody else will take. The queasy ones. Are you a landlord with an apartment building full of broken fire escapes? You could spend a million dollars to get it up to code. Or, you could just pay me ten thousand dollars to find a broke city clerk who likes good coke and is willing to delete your pesky notice of violation. Are you a thirty-year-old billionaire who wants to install full-length, fully operational windows in your techbro penthouse? Even though that is extremely dangerous and code non-compliant and is basically begging someone to fall to their death? You could find another, safer way to flaunt your wealth. Or, you could just pay me ten thousand dollars to convince an inexperienced planner that those windows are welded shut and won’t cause a safety hazard. See? It says so right there on the architectural drawings! Right next to my signature.



I don’t think of myself as a bad person. I only take wealthy clients and buildings that house the wealthy. Because this city runs on greed and contempt for the poor and the poor can’t hire me. And if I’m gonna work for the greedy rich, I prefer to work for the ones who will actually admit they voted for Trump three times.  



Which isn’t to say some of those permits don’t haunt me.



About two years ago, I get a referral from this realtor I like. She really does not give a damn about anyone but herself, and she calls me up and says she’s got a homeowner in an old, rich neighborhood who is desperate and willing to pay handsomely for an issued permit.



Sounds like my cup of tea. What are we talking here? He promise his wife a super illegal backyard pottery kiln?



No, she tells me. It’s weird. He just needs a permit to repair his foundation.



That is weird. That’s a really easy, simple permit. I ask her why he needs somebody like me.



My realtor friend doesn’t know. But he’s offering twenty grand for one foundation strengthening permit. You want it or not?



I meet the guy at his house. His mansion, that is. Let’s call him “David.”  David lives there with his wife and three toddlers. He’s obviously rich as hell. But other than that, he’s giving boy scout vibes. I do not understand why he’s in the market for someone like me. But before he even shakes my hand, he hands me my deposit. Ten grand up front. He has my full attention.



David tells me that this mansion has been in his family for four generations. He inherited the house from his father, who got it from his father, whose father built it. It’s not just a home, it’s an heirloom. But next door to David’s heirloom is another heirloom—a whole bush full of them, actually. His neighbor has a garden full of heirloom tomatoes. She claims that her prize garden is sinking into the ground and it’s because David’s foundation is crumbling.



Which, David informs me, it is. His foundation is absolutely crumbling.



“So, why don’t you just hire a general contractor to fix your foundation?” I ask. Seems like a real easy fix here. “That’s a real easy permit. Any GC could get it for you. I’d love your money, David, but I gotta be honest, I think you’re wasting it on me.”



But David explains further. David has no interest in repairing his foundation. In fact, repairing his century-old mansion’s foundation is something he will not do. But he needs a permit from the city that *says* he repaired his foundation, so he can show that permit to his neighbor and get her off his back and keep her from filing a complaint against him.



So that’s where I come in. David wants me to get an issued permit for a foundation repair that will never be performed, signed by building inspectors who will never inspect it. Which is super, super illegal. I get why I’m here now.



“I can get you that permit. And I can get you the signatures you need,” I tell David. “But I gotta ask. If that foundation is so bad, why don’t you want to actually fix it?”



David gets sheepish. He pulls me into a big room with a fireplace and shuts the door. He doesn’t want his wife to hear what he’s about to say. I suspect he’s keeping a secret from her, but I am wrong. She knows what David is about to tell me. David just doesn’t want her to be reminded. Apparently, David and his family haven’t actually been down in the basement in ten years. They even put a bookshelf in front of the basement door to seal it off.



I ask why.



David tells me that his wife is fully convinced that there is a demonic presence dwelling in the basement. David doesn’t believe it. But his wife is mystical and sensitive and treats the demonic presence in the basement the way she would treat a venomous spider. She does not mess with it. And she doesn’t want it getting out or anywhere near the kids.



I do a good job of stifling my laughter. This is a first. This is dumb as hell. They’re gonna pay me twenty thousand dollars to get them a fraudulent building permit so they don’t have to open their basement door. Rich people.



But like I said, David is a boy scout. I can tell from the way that he talks that he loves his family and is willing to make a fool of himself to keep them happy. I take his money, I take some pictures of the outside of the house and the inside of the first floor, and I tell him I’ll have his building permit in a week.



I meet up with a local engineer whose conscience is as eccentric as my own. We cook up some credible structural drawings and calculations. It’s easy, entry-level stuff. And the next day, I head into the building department.



I get my first sense that something is off about all this at the Planning counter. I show the preservation planner the drawings, expecting no resistance, as the scope of this fake-ass foundation job wouldn’t impact any historical features of the house. The planner agrees and doesn’t object to the drawings. But she gets oddly quiet as she reviews the property owner info. I ask if there’s a problem.



“No, not a problem really,” she says. “It’s just…I guess I just forgot about these people.”



“What people?” I ask.



“The homeowners. They’re a family with…deep roots in the city. How well do you know them?” she asks.



I reply, “I mean, they’re just my clients. Not super well.”



She just goes, “Huh.” She opens her mouth to continue but then thinks better of it. She stamps my plans and sends me along.



I run into trouble at the structural review counter. The structural reviewer is this old guy who likes me. We usually talk movies while he stamps my plans. But he takes one look at the property owner name and goes, “I’m not doing this one.”



I ask him why.



He goes, “Look, I’m not a super judgmental person, but I got limits. I don’t work on anything with that last name on the property owner line.”



I don’t push back. It’s fine. I’ll just wait for them to assign another reviewer. And they do. A newer woman. She reviews the drawings and stamps them and sends me off to the fire department for the final review.



Fire review is going smoothly. But I’m hung up on the reactions I’ve been getting. I shouldn’t ask any questions. I shouldn’t make waves for myself or jeopardize an easy twenty grand. But something in my gut is starting to sour. The fire chief walks by and I ask, “Hey Chief. The name on this form mean something to you?”



The fire chief stops and takes a look. She goes, “That name means something to most people here over fifty.”



I’m not over fifty, so I ask her to help me out.



She goes, “You see all the people sleeping on the city streets? This family’s a big reason why. They bought up all of the section eight housing in the nineties. Said they were gonna redo them and make them into safe, livable spaces for low-income families. They were the town heroes. For a while. Until they flipped all the section eight apartments into luxury condos. Threw everybody out on the street. Hired top dollar attorneys and won every lawsuit. Yeah, most of us old-schoolers bristle at that name. So what are these people up to now? Getting a permit to bulldoze a homeless shelter?”  



By the time the fire chief finishes her story, my ears are red. Like I said before, I’ll play dirty with the rich any day. But both my parents grew up poor. My Mom lived in section eight. I don’t screw over poor people. And I’m not interested in helping David do the same.



I snatch the drawings back from the fire department reviewer. I tell them I’ll come back another day.



I pull up to David’s mansion and pound on the front door. When David answers, I have his deposit in my hand and tell him to take it back and shove it up his ass.



David asks me what the hell this is about.



I tell him, “I don’t know if you’ve got a demon in your basement or not, but sounds to me like your family is demon enough. You can find somebody else.” And I turn to walk away and wash my hands of the whole thing.



But David grabs me by the shoulder. “Wait,” he says.



For some reason, I obey. He guides me into the mansion and closes the door. “There’s not really a demon in the basement. Alright? I know that. It’s just impossible for me to hire people to work on our home with my last name.”



I tell him that maybe that’s appropriate.



David agrees. He goes, “I come from a long line of terrible people, alright? But I’m trying to break the family curse here. I’ve already got a trust set up. When I die, all of my family’s wealth is going to non-profits that help the unhoused and the poor. I’m not even giving it to my kids! We’re talking over a billion dollars. Once I’m gone, it all goes to repair the damage my family did to the poor people of this city. You don’t have to trust me, I can show you the notarized documents.”



I’m confused. I ask David, if everything he’s saying is true, if he really just wants to help people, why did he tell me all that stuff about a demon in his basement? Why does he need this fake permit at all? It’s just a stupid basement foundation. Sure, it’ll cost money to repair, but nothing he’d notice.



David doesn’t answer for a moment. Then he goes, “Look, buddy. This house has been in my family for a long time. About thirty years ago, when my Dad owned the house, a couple of people around the neighborhood went missing. They never found them…and there’s no reason for that to change now. My Dad’s in his nineties. He’ll be dead in a few years. My Dad in prison won’t make anybody safer. It won’t bring those neighbors back. And having a building inspector poking around the soil in my basement is not an option. I want to do good with my family’s money. Just let me. Okay?”



And when I don’t answer, David goes. “Take my money, keep your mouth shut, and once I’m dead, every housing non-profit in the city gets a bucket of gold. Or you can run your mouth. And I can go into the basement, dig up my dad’s old box of toys and hunt you down. You want to know what’s in my basement? Kid. You can be what’s in my basement.”



I took David’s drawings back to the city and sat quietly as the fire department signed off. The clerk issued the permit, no problem. And then I grabbed a beer with the closet-case building inspector I sleep with on occasion. He signed off on the permit, no questions asked. Except for one. He asked why I was so trembly. I told him I was just chilly and couldn’t get warm. He asked if he could take me back to his place and warm me up. I let him. But I didn’t stop trembling.  



I never spoke to David again, and I never went back to that house. He left the rest of the money in my mailbox. But I do see him from time to time. Across the courtyard from the building permit center is a low-income housing non-profit. I see David walk in there a lot. I watch him. I watch him hold the door for everyone. I watch him greet the security guards. Probably by name.



David’s not the only creepy person I got a building permit for. I’ve had other weird ones. But it feels good to get him off my chest.



Or rather, to get them out of my head. Whoever is under David’s house. I just can’t bear it anymore. My mind can’t be the only place they’re still [alive](https://www.reddit.com/user/schaeffernelson/comments/1nd20uy/master_story_list/).
