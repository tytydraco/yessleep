I parked my Gray Mazda CX-30 on the grass near the treeline, and loaded a silver bullet clip into my Taurus 45, and multiple silver laced shotgun shells into my sawed off. I opened the trunk of my car, and took out an ornate silver dagger where the blade had the outline of  black a dragon engraved on it, and a saber that had a similar engraving as well. I took out a flashlight, and closed the truck door. I then sheathed my saber and dagger and entered the forest line in the middle of the knight.

“Should be 5 miles up from here.”

I said to myself, turning on my flashlight.I walked to the campsite, the dry leaves of autumn crunching under my black leather boots and the bushes brushing alongside my black double breasted trench coat rubbing along the dry bushes. God, how I hate that the order makes us wear these things.

I reached the campsite only to be met with the smell of rotting bodies, and yellow police tape and I checked to make sure there weren’t any cops around before entering the campsite.  I was lucky to know that a lesser vampire caused this. For those curious as to what happened, four days ago, a group of six campers went camping in the Allegheny National Forest and were supposed to return the next day. When they didn’t return, some of their relatives called the forest service and they found this campsite with four bodies. One of the cops who was investigating the scene was an insider for the order and relayed the information to them.

The only thing I had to do was find a trail which for someone with my level of experience was relatively easy. I looked around the woods along the campsite and found a small clearing with some broken branches, blood, and footprints.

They led up northeast  an old mineshaft. I held my saber in my left hand and put my flashlight in my right hand and entered the mineshaft. For most normal people, entering the pitch blackness of these tunnels would be terror inducing   with them jumping at every drop from the ceiling, every creak, every small noise. For me though?  This is my job and I’ve gotten used to it to the point that’ it's little more than a minor distraction. I walked silently through the caves, the boots specially designed to cancel out noise until I heard the sound of crying from a side tunnel piercing and echoing through the tunnels. It was obviously human, that much was obvious to me. Lesser vampires sometimes take their victims and sort of in a morbid way store them for later feeding, typically within a month. If I was lucky, both of them would be alive. 

I found both of them tied up against the granite cave wall. It was a large, open cavern where the ceiling of the cave was roughly 25 feet in the air with unpower lights, and mining equipment, and scaffolding inside. I walked up to the two campers who were hanging up against the wall. One of them, a hispanic male who looked to be in his 20’s, was unconscious while another, a blonde girl was awake and wide eyed.

“Is he still alive?” I asked

“Yeah he is. Get us the hell out of here!” 

“Don’t worry I will.” I said.

“You need to hurry up! We’re in danger! I know this sounds crazy but you need believe me that-” she said, a clear panic  in her voice

“That there’s a monster that brought you here and killed your buddies? That’s exactly why I’m here, you know.”

Then for a brief moment the air around us got cold as the instinct that my target was about to attack me weighed on me.  I turned around and using my saber, blocked one of the lesser vampires attacks using it. The vampire was pale and shirtless with his lower body being covered in a dark maroon cloth as he bore his fangs and razor shark-like teeth at me.“

What business you have?” He growled.

“It’s simple, I want to kill you and make money.” I said, a mischievous smile forming on my face before I kicked him away and pulled out my Taurus  45 with my right hand  and shot two bullets into his stomach.

He  moaned in agony as the silver burned it like a witch at the stake. 

“My work you dare interfere?”

“What work? Become a fat ass from eating humans?”

He got visibly offended by my comments before screaming in the same broken English “ I shed blood of you for the mother.”

He screamed out loud before lunging at me, one of his claws grazing my right arm. I dashed to the right, slashing at his leg. He kept trying to claw at me with me effortlessly dodging each strike before  I stepped to the side and I cut off his right arm with my saber and shot him in the head, killing him instantly as his body made a loud thump.“Why do they always give me the easy targets? I guess they pay well.” I said out loud.

I walked  towards the vampire’s captives and freed both of them. I woke the unconscious man and let him recuperate. When both of them were done, I told them to wait and not go anywhere.

“ What do you mean we have to stay here?” The man protested.

“You guys were unlucky enough to be dragged into a  large abandoned mine system, good luck getting out of here on your own.”

“So lead us out of here right now!”“I will do that, but I have something I need to look for.” I said. “Say, did the vampire do anything strange with any of you?”

The girl stopped to think for a moment before saying “I saw him periodically slash Juan and put his blood in multiple test tubes like he was using them for an experiment. I never saw him drink it, he just went somewhere.”

“Test tubes?” I said, my curiosity immediately aroused. “Lady, did you see where the vampire went after he was done extracting blood from your friend?”S

he pointed to a tunnel to my left as I walked inside the tunnel. Turning on my flashlight, I walked through what felt like around three minutes through the cave until I saw a light to the right. I turned off my flashlight and unsheathe my saber and reloaded my Taurus 45. I crept up to the edge of the cave wall, taking  a peak at the room and seeing if there was anything in there. While there weren’t any monsters thankfully, I saw a mini alchemist lab in a cave.T o say I was astonished would be a great understatement. Most lesser vampires were just as intelligent as humans with an IQ of 80-95. I had never seen any lesser or higher vampire do something like this.  I crept inside the lab, preparing to be attacked at any moment but nothing came.

I then began examining the lab. 

“Boiler flasks, Erlenmeyer flasks, beakers, test tubes, and alchemic books.” 

My initial amazement quickly turned to multiple large questions. What was he researching? Why was he collecting blood? I sheathed my sword and began looking through the alchemist book that the vampire had opened. It was written in Latin but thankfully I was taught a fair good amount of Latin so I was able to partly understand it on my own.“Communion with Lilith, mother of the Godless, and Crowned Princess of Hell.” it read. 

“Lilith? Why would a lesser vampire want to commune with Lilith?”  I thought to myself.

I don’t know much about Lilith but from the stories I’ve heard, she was one of the most powerful demons of hell, second only to the Kings of Hell. I also heard that she would be too egotistical to speak with something like a lesser vampire. I started reading some of the notes on the side to gauge this vampire motivation.They were also written in Latin and I roughly understood them to be both  praise of Lilith as well as notes on the progress he was making. I then flipped a page and-

“What the fuck?!” I yelled, almost falling to the ground.

I saw a symbol, a symbol that I was very familiar with but didn’t know the name of. It was a cross but the lower half was bent towards the left while the horizontal line that insects with the top part of a cross was tilted diagonally with the end slightly curving in on themselves. There were two snakes that were wrapping themselves around the cross with them meeting at the top and looking like they were hissing at each other. The twisted cross is also within the confines of a circle.I read what the symbol was and I understood it as “ The Mark of Lilith”. Freaked out , I closed the book, and put it in a medium size  satchel around the center right side of my waist.

I would give the book to my granddad back at the bar I worked at later. Till then, I walked back to the surviving campers but before escorting them outside the mines, and back to my car, I took out my dagger and severed the fang of the vampire I had just killed. I would give this to confirm my kill and get my moment.

I then took the campers out of the mines and guided them to my car.Just before we reached it however, I stopped them.

“What are we stopping for?” The girl asked.

“I did both of you a favor by saving your lives so I would appreciate it if you did me one as well.” I said. “There's a nearby Ranger station where you will be fed and comforted. They’re  going to ask you a lot of questions so you’re going to tell everyone that asks you about that  you were attacked by a deranged machete wielding killer who stalks these woods and both of you managed to escape him.”

“You expect us to shut up about the fact that a fucking vampire attacked us in the woods and spent 3 days toturing us?!” Juan said.

“If you don’t, well let’s just say things are going to get ugly for you, fast.” I said

Both of them didn’t say a word, shaking at the thought of what I might do.  I had no intention of causing them any harm, it’s just the order’s  protocol when we faced these kinds. I led both of them into my car and I drove them to the ranger station where the rangers took them in. 

After I got them the help they needed, I drove to a nearby 3 star motel and slept for the night before preparing to go back home to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. I woke up, ate the mediocre breakfast they were serving, and drove for around 5 hours back to Bethlehelm, the events of the hunt weighing on my mind. I arrived and parked outside my grandfather's bar, The Joyce Bar.I walked into the bar and stepped on the hardwood floor to some old 60’s music playing in the background.'

“Hey Connor, how’d that hunt go?”  Silvia said. 

She was a Brunette woman in her 40’s sitting at a bar stool at the far left end of the counter. My grandfather's bar also served as a meeting place for many of the order’s hunters this side of the country.

“I killed that vampire.” I said, trying to form a smile in a half hearted attempt. “ I need to talk with my grandfather.”

“Hey Micah, get your ass over here, I want another drink, and also your grandson’s back.”

My granddad came from the storage closet, and restocked some of the selves. He then poured a drink for Slivia. 

“Come here and take a seat son.” He said as I then sat on the counter. I pulled out the vampire tooth I had served and I placed it on the table. 

“Good work as always, kid.” He said, a pride filled smile forming on my face.

My granddad took the vampire fang and told me that I can expect my payment of 3,000$ next week. He noticed the look on my face.

“Son, is everything all right?”

“Yeah, it’s just something that has been weighing on my mind ever since I returned.”

“What is it?” 

“Grandpa, when I killed the vampire, I searched his lair and found this.”

I laid out the book I retrieved on the counter to my grandfather's eyes widening. 

“What the? A  Dark Alchemist book? From a Lesser Vampire?” 

Before my grandfather could inquire for any more information, I flipped over to the part of the book where the mark of Lilith symbol.

 I looked my  grandfather, dead in the eye, before saying  “Why do I have the Mark of Lilith engraved on the left side of my neck?”
