“I stayed in a hotel with a friend, it was meant to be haunted. She thought she was a medium so she tried to speak to the ghost. She said ‘make the light flicker if you’re here.’ The light went on and off. Then she said ‘just to prove it’s not a fluke can you do that again?’ The light went on and off again. In the wardrobe we found a box of children’s toys. There were also letters people had written to the ghost. There was one letter from someone who had stayed in the hotel addressed to other guests, it said ‘whatever you do, don’t fall asleep.’ We were tired though and couldn’t keep our eyes open. I had a dream that a doll was walking on my chest and poking my eyes out with a needle. In the morning I woke up and got out of bed but my body was still there. I thought I was having an out of body experience but it’s been the same ever since. I just walk the rooms of the hotel, looking at people and stroking their hair in the night. I’m able to type this because the reception staff left their computer open. I expect they’ll be freaked out.”

The above is a message that appeared on a Word document being used by a night worker in the UK at a well known chain of budget hotels. It appeared just after they took a toilet break. The exact name and location is withheld to protect the reputation of the business and identity of the member of staff involved.

As the hotel worker who supplied this story I don’t want to freak anyone out but lots of people die in hotels. Maybe they go because they’ve had enough, they’re lonely or they might overdose. It happens all the time and we have to hide the evidence. After all, no one wants to stay in a room where something terrible has happened. That’s why our rooms are all so clean and sterile looking. You will not find a single bloodstain anywhere, not under the bed or on the walls. 

I just wish I could tell you all which hotel this was because so many people are freaking out there. People leave in the middle of the night. Some of them scream and beg for their money back. That’s why people stay in budget hotels, they don’t have any money, so I’m often generous and give them the cash because I feel sorry for them even though it’s against company policy. So I guess by posting the story here, that’s what I’m looking for, trying to give you all a warning because you never know what has happened in your hotel until it’s too late. You could be an American tourist, on your first trip abroad, you don’t want it ruined and find yourself stuck here for eternity. Because so many long, gaunt faces are seen around the windows of our hotel, footsteps are heard in the night, and whispers in empty rooms. I can’t leave because I need the money and I’m on the minimum wage. But I urge you all not to come. When you arrive at the Hotel, you never leave.
