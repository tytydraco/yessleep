The Hotel  
I arrived home very late, so I brushed my teeth, showered, and got into bed when I woke up, I was in some sort of abandoned, haunted, Unnamed Hotel in an undisclosed location that looked like it was built in the early 1940s judging by the interior’s design. Despite being abandoned for years, The Hotel never seemed to fall into disrepair. There is a wooden cross bridge leading up to it, however, it looks like it was destroyed a long time ago. However, the lights are still on in the interior, at first glance, it looks cozy, but there’s something so much more than what meets the eye, on the first floor.

Entering The First Floor  
Entering The First Floor was… odd, the floors were underneath the hotel instead of above, and the elevators were even more weird, despite the button for floor 2 being pressed, the elevator only went to Floor 1 and then stopped. After you exit the elevator and the elevator doors close, you can’t call the elevator back down.   
 The Reception Desk looks like it has been a while since anyone has stood behind it. There was a luggage cart blocking the entryway behind the reception desk.

You can grab the key to the first door if you crawl under it.   
The layout of the hotel is weird, when I opened door 1 there was a room with 6 wardrobes, then door 2 was at the end, and this continued with nothing happening for a while. However, I got to door 20, and the lights flickered aggressively, I heard something coming so I jumped into one of the wardrobes nearby, and something rushed past me, breaking all the lights in the room. “What the actual hell was that?!” I thought to myself. Something was very wrong.  
  
 

 I continued through the 20s and when I walked through Door 30, the lights flickered and I heard a “bloop” sound. When I looked around, I saw an eye on the wall, it followed me wherever I was. I continued walking through the doors and then I was met with a long hallway, with big windows on either side, it was storming like hell outside. “Wait a goddamn minute… If I’m underground… then how is it raining?” I thought to myself. I walked closer to the window and looked out, there was nothing, it was just a void!  


 I walked to the end of the hallway, and then I heard a splashing sound, the eyes were back but this time something was rising out of the ground with them, and it started chasing me, I ran for dear life, ducking under fallen chairs and bookshelves, then I had to look for the correct to (the other ones were destroyed) when I got to the end of the chase, there were these massive, black, arms reaching through the windows trying to get me, they knocked down 3 chandeliers from the ceiling, creating a fire on the rug that I had to avoid. When I got into the room, the monster was still chasing me, I braced myself to be attacked, then the door slammed shut by itself, and the beast banged 3 times on the door before going away. It made it out alive. “What the actual fuck was that monster?!” I thought to myself. I then noticed there were 2 doors, one said “46,” and the other one said “48” I remembered that I had passed through door 45, so I went through door 46, and the sign on “door 48” fell off.

Doors 45 - 90 

“I guess I need to pay attention to what door I go through each time, I don’t want to find out what’s behind the fake doors.” I thought again to myself.  


I continued through the doors until I made it to Door 50, The Library. When I entered the entrance area of The Library, there was a reception desk and a door parallel to the one I entered from, but It was destroyed. “Wait, if this Hotel never falls into disrepair, then how come a lot of the doors I see are destroyed?” I wondered. Then, I heard it. A low growl came from beyond The Library doors. I didn’t want to find out what was beyond those doors but I had no choice. I opened the doors. The growling started again, and then this huge, humanoid creature appeared from behind a bookshelf, it would’ve gotten to me had a lamp not fallen over and caused it to run away and investigate. I used this chance to get away from it. When I looked closer at the monster, I noticed it had no eyes. “This thing must be blind, that’s why it didn’t immediately charge at me,” I whispered to myself. I saw a desk at one end of the library, I saw these blue sparkles coming off of one end. I waited for “The Figure” to leave before advancing to the desk. I saw a piece of paper with a drawing of shapes and numbers and the lock on Door 51, the exit of The Library.   

&#x200B;

The monster ran over to the opposite end of the library, where I saw it checking one of the wardrobes.   


“The Figure” is what I called it. I got to the exit of The Library and solved the code. 

&#x200B;

When I opened the door, The Figure growled and started sprinting towards the door, then the door closed all by itself, and the figure let out a shriek of anger. I progressed through the hotel, then I got chased by the black-eye monster again. However, the chase sequence was different, it was all intersections, but I made it out regardless.   


When the chase ended, I was relieved, but not for long. I heard this low-pitched screaming sound at door 84, another monster was coming. It was a pale, greenish screaming face.   
When the monster left I got out. “What the fuck?! It ambushed me!” I said out loud.   
I continued and arrived at The Courtyard.   
 I opened the door at the end of The Courtyard, and there stood before me; The Greenhouse. The Greenhouse had no lights, so it would be almost impossible to tell when that Rush monster would appear.   
But, for some reason, it didn’t. I made it through the Greenhouse and entered the last door, Door 100, The Electrical Room.   
I was so ready to get out of this hell hole, but there were 3 gates down, they seemed to be connected to a lever I saw. I was very reluctant to pull it, but I had no choice.   
I pulled it.   
The doors opened, and I was terrified to see The Figure rush out of wherever it was hiding. It sprinted down the stairs and it started chasing me. I had to loop around the Electrical Room to lose it, but when I did, it started roaming around looking for me.   


I found 10 fuses on the ground, they looked like they went to a breaker box.   
“I bet I can use these to power up the elevator I saw up there!” I thought to myself.   
So that’s what I did, I opened the breaker box and put the fuses in when I did, I heard The Figure start coming towards me, then I heard it shriek as if it was in pain when I looked at one of the torn wires had started a fire because of some oil on the ground! This was my chance to power up the elevator.   
 

After The Figure rushed down, I hid, I went upstairs and found an old elevator, like a mineshaft elevator. 

When I powered up the elevator, The Figured appeared in the room behind me and banged on the door, breaking it down, he started chasing me.   
The Electrical Room was about to be engulfed in flames. But I made it to the elevator! 

&#x200B;

When I made it, I pressed the button to go down, right as the doors closed, The Figure got there and started banging on the door, desperately trying to get me. 

&#x200B;

When it couldn't, it let out a low growl, the elevator started descending, and I let out a sigh of relief. I had escaped, or So I thought.   
Just then The Figure landed on top of the elevator destroyed the elevator’s cable, and jumped off and landed in some cut-out, the elevator started descending faster and faster until it eventually crashed. I was in some mineshaft.
