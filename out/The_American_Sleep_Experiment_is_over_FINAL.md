DAY UNKNOWN

Three is beginning to flood the subject room. I don’t know how we’ve gotten to this point, but the only thing holding the water in there is the closed door. One has been in and out, but he always climbs through the window for some reason, leaving chunks of skin and scraping bone across the broken glass every time. The water is nearly ankle deep at this point, even filling the side rooms. I don’t know where it keeps coming from, with an endless ocean being coughed from his lungs from seemingly nowhere.

Eventually it’s going to come up and cover Two, probably drowning him where he lay on the floor. I don’t plan on being here for that, and it’s not like he deserves to be saved anyway. The little girls dancing around him have become more vivid, with obvious signs of other terrible acts committed on them besides the dismemberment. Four was still locked in his room, meanwhile, the symptoms of rabies now in their final stages, catatonic and shaking, scared of everything as the water seeped in under his door. He was desperate for a drink, I could tell, but even just looking at the water was making his throat spasm violently as his mind told him it was poison.

We’ve begun our escape attempt, though it took take a while as the surgical saw we have isn’t the most powerful. It’s really only meant for bone at the most, so going up against the steel used on the vents is one hell of a task for it. Eventually though, after some time, it began to get through, and from there we were able to use a cane to pry the rest open.

Murray went in first, clutching a flashlight and trying to find the right path out. Taryn and I stood anxiously as he explored, hoping against all hope that he would have some success.

That was about the point where I went into a dreamstate, against all my best efforts to stave it off. Deprivation took hold yet again, leaving me on the precipice of sleep and waking but unable to actually get to the destination I wanted. That was when she started talking.

“Mikey?” It was the first time she had actually acknowledged me, instead of just staring blankly into space as she did for so many nights, dissociating from life just like I was doing now. I shut my eyes, preparing to go through some sort of torture for my sins. After all, I was no different from the people we did this to. I was willing to put humans through hell just to save myself from it, no matter how much I tried to say it was some “greater good” bullshit I was doing. I was a part of the problem. This hell was of my own making.

I strained, keeping my eyes closed against all odds, trying not to face what had happened. Any moment I expected to feel something smothering me, waiting for my slow, agonizing death that would never end. I deserved this. It was all my fault, I killed her. It wasn’t out of mercy, was it? It was a way out of taking care of her. A way out of seeing the rapid decline that I would have to face, counting my days until it took hold. It was to save me.

”I’ve got you, Mikey.” I heard her say, right from in front of me as a hand touched my face. Slowly, ever so slowly, knowing that the feeling of peace imparted through those words could be snatched away in moments, I opened my eyes. “Even when you don’t. I’ve got you.”

She was smiling at me, warm and kind, the strong lines on her face forged through the years of abuse yet still they remained kind. 

We embraced, tears flowing freely down my face while I sobbed for forgiveness, telling her how sorry I was, how I never wanted to hurt her, billions of confessions and please for my mother’s mercy. 

“I’ve got you.” She said again, giving me a little push now, “Go.”

I felt Taryn grab me by the arm, pulling me close back to the vent. Murray was shouting through, yelling at us to come through. The noise must have caught One’s attention, as he came marching in from around the corner, water sloshing around his feet. He had finally opened the sealed door, letting Three’s flood waters loose through the facility. It was rushing faster, like his brief sputters had now become a waterhose. Those I couldn’t see him, I could hear the drowning screams as he kept gushing water from his windpipe. as the specters around began crowding in, One was marching into view, leading them like some parade from the ninth circle of hell. He kept moving, smiling at us as he went, torso wobbling as his eviscerated body couldn’t hold his spine steady. It was eerie, like a jack in a box marching on skinny, fragile legs that could snap at any moment under the weight. Looking closer, I could see one leg was already broken, foot missing and bloody stump dragging closer, leaving red water in his flooding wake.

“The doors are open! You’ve been away too long!” He was giggling, pointing at me as he laughed. I was still pulling myself toward the vents, desperately clambering inside.. “The Jailer’s given up! You’re officially free! Free to be you, free to be me, free to have fun with all your new friends! They’ve been so excited to meet you! Their playthings are getting a little boring, though they’ve had plenty of fun reacquainting themselves.”

Taryn was still pulling on me, Murray’s voice breaking through the cacophony of abominations heading toward us. I finally got all the way into the vent, crawling as mom smiled behind me, watching me leave as she was lost to the crowd of undead.

They began coming after us, even in the vents. I made the mistake of looking back, seeing the dismembered, charred arms of Five’s victims crawling after us. I sped up, desperately trying to outrun the death that was following after me. I knew they couldn’t kill me. Knew I would only face a millennia of terror if they took hold of me. I had gone too long past the point of no return. Once they got hands on me, I was theirs. Forever.

We got to the end, finally seeing a bit of light peeking through ahead of us. Murray was already standing there, having broken off the outer vent to get out. The sun was up, daylight pouring in from our destination, golden rays that promised at least some sort of freedom. Electricity ran through my spine, though whether it was the gas or my own adrenaline I don’t know.

Practically falling out of the vent, Taryn and I hit solid ground and felt grass in our hands. It was beautiful, one of the best things I’ve ever felt. Even with bright sunlight streaming over me, causing my head to pulse with tremendous pain. The phantoms were still thumping behind us though, threatening to drag us back into hell.

There wasn’t much other choice than to run, all of us staggering as we desperately crashed through trees and brush to try and find some safety. Eventually we came out to a roadside, before we were swarmed. This time not by phantoms, but by black vans, men jumping out and pulling guns on us as they threw thick cloth bags over our heads, then tossing us into the cars. 

I don’t know how long we drove for. Not like my sense of time is anything to judge by anyway. When they eventually took us out, they still didn’t take the bags off. The only way I could tell we entered a building was the change in sound and a blast of cold air conditioning hitting me, chilling my bones. Eventually I was thrown into a room, Taryn alongside me. Murray was missing, nowhere to be found.

As for the room, it was like having the script flipped on us. There was a one way observation mirror on the side, with no way for us to see what was going on. A small bathroom with shower and toilet in the corner, two cots on the opposite wall, a desk sat in the middle of the room with three chairs, and that was it. The two of us had no idea what the hell we were supposed to do now.

The door opened. Needless to say we were… not happy about who entered.

Murray walked in the room, smiling at the two of us. 

“Sorry for the rough welcome, but there’s still the possibility you could leak where we are if you recognized anything. I don’t mind you talking about this, but I can’t have you spilling the location.” He said, taking a seat on one side of the table and gesturing us to the other side. Both Taryn and I sat down hesitantly, glaring at our friend as we began to put information together in our disoriented minds. “See, nobody is going to believe what you have to say anyway. Who would, after all? Sounds like one of those bullshit internet stories the kids are obsessed with these days.”

’Why are we here, Murray?” I asked, looking around furtively to see if there were any phantoms following us. “What’s going on?”

”Oh don’t worry, you two are safe..” He said, smiling. “See, I took a liking to the two of you while we were all in that house. I told them we could use you still. So they let me get you out.”

”You’ve been going through the same thing we have, man. What the fuck?” Taryn was asking him now, beginning to bang on the table in frustration. her eyes were red, bloodshot from tears and lack of sleep for… god, how long has it been? Taryn broke down now, “Why?

“Oh I’ve been getting a solid eight hours most nights. You two would never find me, but I was just fine.” He said.

My head hurt as dots connected, Murray’s lack of specters, his long disappearances… Jesus. He was the one who left a fire extinguisher in the subject room. He knew.

“You have an antidote, don’t you?” I asked him, leveling a look right in his eyes that said to tell me the truth, or else.

”Of course. I wasn’t going in there without one.” He laughed. “I was just there to observe how things went down. A control.”

”You son of a bitch. SON OF A BITCH!” Taryn began to scream, beginning to stand up and jump over the table at him. Two guards entered the room, guns drawn and pointing at her. Despite our unfortunate immortality, she backed off, working on that basic survival instinct to stay alive.

”Look, I’m not going to stay here and spill everything. I helped you guys get out of there. Now, we’re going to detox you from the gas, and see how it goes. As far as what happened, subjects aren’t privy to experimental data.” Murray stated, getting up to leave and ushering the others out. “There’s a computer over there if you want to catch up on the outside, hell, tell people what happened to you. Not like they’re going to take it seriously.”

He left, with me in stunned silence and Taryn raging, banging against the table in frustration.

Now here I am, unsure of what to do. I thought I wouldn’t make it out of there, much less be allowed to somehow tell the story. Too bad nobody is going to believe me.

DAY 54

Yeah, I’m shocked by the day too. We were in there nearly two months. Considering that the major violence started around day ten… I don’t know how we got out. 

Neither me nor Taryn have slept yet, and we’ve been here for… twelve hours so far by the clock on the wall. They’ve brought us food, but I’m not hungry. Now that I think about it, I stopped eating weeks ago. I’m paranoid they’re going to do the same thing as we did, dosing the food to keep us up in the absence of the gas.

Now that we’re somewhere without screams and the smell of death, it feels like we can think more clearly. We’ve talked about it, everything that happened. The best hypothesis is that sleep maintains the barrier between life and death. Earth and hell, so to speak. Whether that goes at the same pace for everyone is where I feel that we’ve seen variances, and Taryn suggests that it may be based on life experiences. When the barrier begins to thin, all these lost lives press through the barrier, eventually ripping it and giving them access to the subject physically.

We have no idea if we’re right, of course, but it’s all that we can draw from our time. Especially considering we’re still running off of the after-effects of the gas. Murray hasn’t spoken to us again, and I honestly don’t know that he will. I don’t believe we’ll ever be let out of here to see the sun again, if I’m being honest.

This room feels empty compared to the crowds of bodies and limbs that were around the facility for the past month and a half. If it weren’t for Taryn, I would probably feel like the last man on earth. Locked away and forgotten as everyone else got to eternally dream in slumber.

DAY 56

The dreamstates are getting worse, with even more sporadic occurrences and longer cycles. I’ve still not seen any phantoms, and the Jailer hasn’t made a reappearance.

Not for me, at least. Taryn says that she’s caught glimpses from the corner of her eye again. It had disappeared for her not long after it did for me, giving up hope on every getting us back. She said it returned last night though, first a small shadow in the corner, pushed as far back and away from her as could be. Since then though, she says it has started to grow closer, though still miles away in the same room.

I’m slipping out again. If anything happens I’ll update but… what’s the point anymore?

DAY 62

She’s asleep. Taryn fell asleep two hours ago. I thought she had finally died somehow at first, checking her pulse in fear to see if she was still with me. It was beating strong, and her breathing was now steady and deep. When I pulled one of her eyelids open, she was well into the deep REM cycle. Finally resting after weeks of conscious hell.

The last few days she’s mentioned the Jailer growing closer, coming further into view. Both of us have been comparing symptoms as we’ve been here, noticing that the electric feeling in her spine was fading as the figure grew closer. It wasn’t so unbearable anymore, sending electric shocks up and down our bodies still but more like a light buzz instead of a taser now. A few hours ago, she mentioned that the Jailer was closer than she had seen it before. She reached her hand out, touching it, and not long after, laid down to sleep.

Nothing has appeared for me. Not the Jailer, not the phantoms, nothing. The electricity is still there, and I’m hoping to some kind of God that it wears off so I may be able to sleep soon.

DAY 70

Taryn has been sleeping regularly for the past week now. The first time, when I made my last update, she slept for nearly twenty hours straight. When she awoke, according to her everything was bright, almost an electric vividness to the world. Since falling asleep she hasn’t seen anything. I still haven’t seen the Jailer return, and that’s… that’s what leads me to my final, terrifying conclusion.

—-

DAY 80

They let Taryn out, though I don’t know where. Maybe she’s actually allowed to go back to her normal life. Could we do that at this point though? It doesn’t matter.

I don’t have long. I know what it was now, the Jailer. We’ve always had a name for it, tons of them, actually. Morpheus, Nyx, Hypnos, Somnus, Tsukuyumi… every culture has their own version, but what it is, really, is sleep. Sleep itself. It only wanted to save us from the hell we made.

It hasn’t reappeared to me. I can’t feel the electricity buzzing in my spine anymore. I’ve requested tests from the guard that brings in my food, and they’ve complied, taking me in for a brain scan.

Please, pray that something will work for me. Dream for me. Sleep for me. Please… sleep.

—-

DAY 85

I can see them again. Not Sleep, the subjects. 

They’re all… just there. They glare at me from the shadows in corners, watching me and waiting for their chance to strike. I don’t know how they got here. I don’t know what they want from me. Probably to tear me apart like their victims did to them. None appear as they did in life, but as they were left in the facility. Burnt, drowned, ripped to shreds… everyone is here. All because of me. 

I don’t know at this point whether it’s the hallucinations or if their souls have actually come for me. As of yet, they don’t seem to want to come after me. I’m sure, given time. That will change.

DAI 9o

I fear I’m done. They’re inching closer, eyes fixated on me. At least, the ones that have eyes. I can hear curses and screams coming from them, and One’s obnoxious, mocking laughter won’t get out of my ears. 

It came back too, though. It’s still faint, but it’s there. I can tell. The Jailer? No, no, that doesn’t seem like the right thing to call it. It’s getting closer, the cosmos making up its body pulsating as it does. I swear, in just hours it’s come so, so close. Closer than they have.

—-

Da?

She’s back. Mom is here, and the others have gone away. They seemed angry when she showed up, like they were told their fun was called off. She’s smiling at me though, that same smile that said it’s all going to be okay.

Mom just walked over to the Jailer, still watching me from so close, but so goddamn far to still reach. She’s taken the hand of the cosmos, smiling at me and extending her other hand towards me, reaching for mine. 

I don’t know what may happen. I don’t know if I’m just lost in my own delusion, but I think this will be it for me. I’m going to take her hand now. [Goodbye](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/sZxbfHU5zv).
