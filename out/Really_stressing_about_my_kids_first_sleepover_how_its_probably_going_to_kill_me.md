“We need to have a talk.”

My son rolled his eyes at me. “About what?”

“[About those two police officers you killed](https://redd.it/15cq9rh),” I answered, folding my arms. 

Of course, I didn’t want to believe that was true. But he had pushed things far enough, and it was time to see how he would react under gentle pressure. 

He stared right back at me, his cold eyes inching toward victory in our little tug-of-war. “What about them?” he quipped, putting the issue back in my court with a non-answer. 

My blood chilled nevertheless. Have you ever been afraid of a family member? Pushing away the feeling is like watching a snake un-shed its skin as the cold, scaly enclosure creeps into your cells and infuses itself into every sense. 

“Um,” I stammered. “It’s bad to murder people.”

*CLANG*

The sound of a shovel interrupted us from the backyard. The fear spun faster: someone else was here. Of *course* my son couldn’t do anything evil on his own. He must have been influenced by one of his shitbag friends.

Or was one of the cops not actually dead? The thought ceased my breathing. Did I want the police to be alive, or was I subconsciously hopeful that all witnesses had been eliminated?

We both ran to the back door. My legs felt like they were churning through the quicksand dreams where our bodies refuse to move fast enough. My son arrived first, bursting into the backyard. 

One of his shitbag friends was standing over the two bloody rugs, my shovel in his hands. What was that kid’s name? I couldn’t remember – he was ‘the ugly one’ in my mind, and I’d never bothered to find out.

Perhaps my parenting style has been less than ideal. 

“Why does your dad look so fucking confused?” the kid demanded of my son. “Doesn’t he know what’s going on?”

“Now just a minute, young man,” I responded to the shovel-wielding preteen as he walked through a puddle of blood. “You need to learn some boundaries.”

“Boundaries?” he shot back, dumbfounded. “Do you think that Oliver gives a shit about boundaries?” 

My mind swirled with a dozen different thoughts before I grasped onto one. “Oliver… the reverse pizza kid?”

Ugly kid’s eyes bulged. “You bury a dead child in the woods and the thing you remember most about him is the way he ate pizza?”

Every one of my body’s systems stopped. I could no longer deny the truth: ugly kid confirmed that I’d hidden reverse pizza kid’s corpse.

“I… you shouldn’t kill people,” I answered lamely.

“You can’t kill someone who’s already dead,” my son answered in a sad voice. “We were trying to keep everyone safe.”

I tried to communicate with him in a way that he would understand. “Huh?”

Ugly kid pointed to a trail of very muddy footprints that I’d missed because of the blood and rugs.  

I wanted to puke frozen vomit. The child-sized footprints emerged from the woods behind my house and zigged nineteen steps before zagging thirteen more and disappearing around the corner. 
“You should have buried him deeper,” ugly kid whispered. 

“Yeah,” my son answered in a quiet voice. “I realize that now.” He wiped his eye. “I’m so sorry, Dad. I tried to keep us safe. But Oliver’s gotten out of the grave we dug, and now [he’s coming to hurt us](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”
