My name is Emma, I’m posting this to this board because of my experience I had on the farm I own in Oklahoma. No one else I’ve told will believe me and everyone else who witnessed what happened is dead.



I brought down the axe with a final time and chopped the wood cleanly in half, I then wiped my brow and admired the morning's work. The time was around 1pm, I remember that clearly. 



“Richie!” I called to my farmhand “Let’s stop for lunch hun”



“Sure thing Ms Jackson” he replied, putting the safety on my hunting rifle he was practicing with and placing it near the porch.



I had taught him to fire it for his 15th a few months back, I never had gotten a chance to adopt or have kids or my own and Richie was like a son to me. Richie’s face was dotted with freckles and and his hair looked like a mess of copper wiring and his frame reminded me of my own scarecrow. 



When he got inside I made us sandwiches and squash and we sat on the porch chatting, I asked him about how high school was, what his friends were up to and if he had a crush, we had barely noticed when it fell from the sky. The “radioactive meteorite” as the men in black had called it had barely caused any impact when it directly slammed into my barn, the small shockwave caressed my face like a light breeze but the ceiling of my beautiful barn had been obliterated by something I still can’t understand.



Not wasting any time, I told Richie to stay and phone someone, it didn’t matter who and sprinted into the barn. I had to duck as I walked through the entrance, the foundations had been shaken and cracked but not destroyed thankfully, past the halebales was a narrow crater that continued all the way into my cellar and my root veggies for the winter were probably gone. 



I looked down the slender abyss and saw a sphere about the size of a large hale bale, at first I thought it was metal but the grey surface shone like oil in water and was constantly shifting. I heard a gunshot and flinched as everything went quiet, the bullet ricocheted off  the surface and it rippled like a raindrop had hit a lake. 



“Now what the hell was that for?” I yelled at Richie, half just so I could hear myself and snatched the gun off him. Luckily he was wearing the headphones so his ears weren’t damaged. Suddenly, we were bathed in a soft orange light and I gripped Richie’s as hard as I could. The light lasted a few seconds but we were fine, not disintegrated or teleported, we were fine.



Once we were outside the barn, I released my grip on him and took a breath I didn’t realise I had been holding. 



“Don’t do that again” I said sternly, still half deaf from Richie’s gunshot.  “Someone could get hurt”



Richie nodded sheepishly and I heard Bill’s pick up  pull up the farm, so that’s who Richie had rung for. The wheels came to a halt and Bill stepped out, Bill was my stout older neighbour, last time I checked he was in his late 60s. 



“Good to see you Emma” he said, his face not matching his words “You still seeing that girl?”



“No” I responded quickly, hoping the subject would change quickly from my ex. We made more small talk until the elephant in the room came up.



“What’s the problem? Something about a meteor?” He said gruffly, trying to appear taller than me as he was 170cm and I was 175cm tall.



“Yep, landed in my barn” I said, walking closer so I could hear him better.



“Recon we can sell it?” He asked, stroking his greying beard and looking at Richie distantly.



“Maybe” I responded, glancing back at Richie who was observing as curiously.



“Bet” He responded, unwinding his winch and getting straight to the business at hand “I’ll be here, you and boy tie the winch around it and I’ll pull it out”



I felt the heavy hook in my hand, the cool metal made me think of the way the thing shifted and distorted when Richie fired. I was snapped out of my thoughts by a yelp from Bill, Richie had it covered though, mountain boomer had run past his feet and scared the old man.



“Damn lizards” Bill grumbled "horrible little things” and Me and Richie both laughed at him.



I gestured for Richie and we left for the barn once again, I left the gun with Bill and gripped the winches hook in my hands. We came to the spot and looked down at the alien object, I could hear a soft crying coming from the sphere and my curiosity peaked. I walked down to the cellar with the hook still in hand  and a section of the orb slid back, revealing a human baby, a boy with blue eyes and white hair and he giggled with joy as he saw me.I stood there in disbelief for a good few minutes, eventually I swallowed and looked up to Richie and he was also in amazement. It was a baby boy, I remember thinking, just like one I had never gotten a chance to have. 



With caution, I scooped him out of the sphere in both hands, he was warm to the touch and I rocked him gently in my strong arms. Then, the baby began to cry and I could feel the gentle warmth emitting from the child change to a searing heat, like branding iron on my arms. Reflexively, I dropped him onto the ground and the child started to change into a fetus, melting into a pool of white hot red sludge that burnt through my shoes and singed my feet.



Richie started to run, and the red liquid snaked after him on the wooden barn floor. I gave chase as well, sprinting up the cellar stairs but I wasn’t fast enough. I watched in terror as the liquid wrapped itself around his foot, trailing up his body and burning his throat until his head came clean off.



Bill muttered something and turned around from his work, I'm sure the sight added  more grays to his hair. He brought the gun to his side and started to pace backwards slowly as the red shape began to morph. The shape of a massive lizard came behind him, thousands of throws of teeth from a reptile's maw that sunk around his head like a venus flytrap, the sound of a watermelon coming from within the deadly trap.



That was the end of both Richie and Bill, the men in black suits had taken the meteorite and put me in intensive care, I will be attending both their funerals soon. I pray for both their souls.
