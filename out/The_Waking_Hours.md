I first noticed something was wrong when I got home from school on a Tuesday. It wasn't anything dramatic—just the way my mom's shadow fell on the kitchen wall. It stretched too far, bent at impossible angles, and sometimes moved when she didn't. I blinked hard, chalking it up to too many late nights studying for finals.

But then I saw my little brother's reflection in the TV screen while it was turned off. He was sitting on the couch playing his Nintendo Switch, but his reflection was standing, staring directly at me. When I turned to look at him, he was still focused on his game, thumbs moving in that familiar pattern. His reflection kept staring.

Mom made lasagna that night—my favorite. Every bite tasted like a memory of lasagna rather than the real thing. The texture was there, but it felt programmed, like someone had typed "lasagna taste" into a computer and this was the result. Dad asked about my day using the exact same words he'd used yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that.

I ran.

Jake, my boyfriend of two years, lived just three blocks away. I'd made that run plenty of times before, usually when I needed to escape my parents' fighting or when life felt too heavy. But this time, the streets seemed longer, stretched out like taffy. The neighbors' houses repeated in subtle patterns—white house, blue house, red house, white house, blue house, red house—like someone had copy-pasted them without bothering to add variations.

Jake answered his door before I knocked. He smiled that crooked smile I loved, but it didn't quite reach his eyes. Actually, it didn't reach his eyes at all. They were flat, like stickers pasted onto his face. He hugged me, and his body temperature was exactly 98.6 degrees—not the warmth of a living person, but the clinical average of human body temperature.

I stayed at his house for hours, watching him move through practiced motions of comfort. He stroked my hair exactly 47 times before switching to patting my shoulder. Each pat came precisely 2.5 seconds after the last. His mom brought us cookies that smelled like the concept of cookies rather than actual baked goods. His dad's footsteps upstairs created perfect, metronomic rhythms.

That's when I started seeing the glitches.

Sometimes objects would flicker, showing their wireframe underneath. Jake's cat walked through a wall when it thought I wasn't looking. The clock on the wall ticked backward for exactly 13 seconds before correcting itself. The family photos on their walls were the same ones that had been in my house, just with different faces copied over.

I ran again.

The street outside had fewer details now, like a video game rendering graphics at minimum settings. Trees popped into existence only when I looked directly at them. The sky was a perfect gradient of sunset colors, too perfect to be real. Cars drove past in loops, the same five vehicles over and over, like background sprites in a cheap animation.

My phone didn't work anymore—the screen just showed an endless loading symbol. When I tried to remember my best friend's phone number, I couldn't. When I tried to remember anything before last week, the memories felt flat, pre-programmed, like watching someone else's home movies.

The world started unraveling faster after that. Buildings in the distance were just facades, like a movie set. People on the street moved in perfect synchronization, their faces blank until they turned toward me. The air tasted like static electricity.

I ended up in the park, sitting on a swing that didn't sway quite right. The chains made no sound. The wind blew leaves in perfect spirals. That's when I heard it—a voice that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere, distorted like it was traveling through water:

"Patient shows increased neural activity. Simulation stability at 47%. Recommend increasing sedation."

Another voice: "No, wait. She's finally starting to wake up."

The sky began to pixelate. Trees dissolved into strings of code. I felt a tugging sensation, like something was trying to pull me up and out of this world. My hands started to look transparent, and I could see the ones underneath—my real hands, connected to tubes and wires.

Now I'm writing this, or thinking it, or maybe dreaming it. The simulation is breaking down around me. My fake family, my fake boyfriend, my fake life—they're all just programs designed to keep me here, wherever here is. I can feel myself starting to wake up in another world, the real world, where I suspect I've been lying in some kind of hospital bed all along.

But here's what terrifies me most: what if that world isn't real either? What if it's just another layer of the simulation? What if I'm trapped in a nesting doll of false realities, each one breaking down only to reveal another fake world underneath?

I can hear the voices getting clearer now. They're saying something about "neural connection" and "consciousness recovery." The world around me is dissolving faster, breaking apart into pixels and code.

I think I'm finally waking up.

I think.

I hope.
