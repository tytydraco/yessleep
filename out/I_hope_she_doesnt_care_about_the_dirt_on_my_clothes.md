God damnit!  
How can I make her impressed by showing up on our first date with dirt on my clothes?   
I am so stupid, no wonder they never like me… I mean, obviously, they are the problem. I can’t understand how they don’t see how I am the best they will do. I am smart, I am genuinely a nice guy, I hear their concerns, and I am always there for them. Even when they can’t see me, I am always on the watch, in case something happens. I have to protect them, even though they don’t understand it.  
Linda was the first one I ever loved. Oh, Linda, her beautiful brown eyes, her soft and silky blond hair, her beautiful skin. My dear Linda, I still miss her. Unfortunately, she didn’t appreciate my care. She didn’t understand why I was always around. She would freak out, and yell at me in public! The audacity… She would call me a stalker, a creep, a pervert… She once called the cops on me and I barely escaped.  
I came to the conclusion that she didn’t like being safe. Maybe she deserves all that happens to her. If she would rather not feel safe and protected, that is fine. But don’t come crying and asking for my help when you need it.  
Amber was the second one. Her hair was red as fire. Her eyes were as blue as the sky. She would wear cute round glasses, anime shirts, jeans, and all-stars. She always wore some variation of this, it was like she had a uniform. She loved reading at night, with just her bedside lamp on. She was always accompanied by Bob, her cat. She would talk late on the phone with her friends about life and how they should get together and have fun. Her smile, oh boy, it made me crazy.   
But she had to ruin it, didn’t she? She had to. On a Thursday night, I heard her talking to her friends, and they planned to meet at a local bar on Saturday night. How could she? Didn’t she understand that a respectful woman, dare I say, an engaged woman, shouldn’t behave like this? Going to all of these dirty, promiscuous, slutty places?  
I was fuming. I lost it, and that was my mistake. I instantly began climbing her window, and she started shouting and yelling and desperately crying. She kept asking who I was and why was I doing that. I kept explaining that I was her love. I kept saying how we were meant for each other and how she was going to understand it. But then, she punched me in the gut and ran.   
Oh, Amber, why did you have to do that? Why did you have to ruin it for us?  
I ran after her and with a quick swing right on her head, she was out cold. As she fell, she hit her head on the kitchen table so hard, that a pool of blood just formed under her. I was so scared, I almost called the police.  
But I couldn’t, she was mistaken, she brought this upon herself. It was her fault and only hers. I took her to my car and drove to my father’s house. Nobody lives there, and it was far away from the city with no neighbors around. I gave her a bath, changed her clothes, and laid right next to her on our bed.  
The next day, I realized she wasn’t the one as soon as I saw Jenny. I knew I had to act fast because she was going to go on a date, in a couple of hours, with some jerk from her college!   
I wanted to grab her right then and there, but it wasn’t the right time.   
I quickly ran home and put my sweet amber to rest in a grave right next to my dearest Linda.  
I hope Jenny doesn’t care about the dirt on my clothes.
