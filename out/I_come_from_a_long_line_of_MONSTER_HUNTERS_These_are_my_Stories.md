Sleether.

What the hell is a Sleether?

It was time to find out. Once and for all.

But here’s the problem: Graveyard Gary disappeared. He was away from school all week. I figured he was sick. I mean, he certainly looked sick. Let’s face it: the guy was miles from healthy. I texted him repeatedly. No response. I was growing more and more anxious. And scared. Something was wrong in the lowly town of Gulp. Something most foul. But what? And why?

I had no answers. And having no friends other than Gary, I asked my father. I’ve always felt he was hiding something from me. Something important. Turns out, I was correct. What he revealed shocked me to the core.

“Son,” he said, sitting on the sofa, sipping his rum and coke. “You come from a long line of Sleethers.”

“But…” Fists clenched, I spat my words like venom. “What the hell is a Sleether?”

My father flinched. I’d never spoken to him that way – I wouldn’t dare. He scanned the vicinity, making sure Mother wasn’t around. His eyes, guarded from his well-worn fedora, had that faraway look, like he’d been planning this for years, and now the day had come, and he was unprepared.

“There are rules, son. I wish this weren’t true.” He slow-sipped his rum as he spoke. “A Sleethers job is to protect the people of Gulp from the monsters inhabiting the town. Until the time comes to pass the torch. Which alas, for me, it has.”

I was gobsmacked. Me, a Sleether? How was I to protect the town? I’d just turned seventeen. What did I know?

My father continued. “The town of Gulp is pervaded by magic. Dark magic, mostly. Unfortunately, dark magic is untrustworthy, and over time, it gets cranky. Cranky like Harold P. Halliburton.”

Hearing that name filled me with horror.

“Many years ago,” my father continued, “Halliburton owned a thriving paper mill factory. Shortly before his untimely death, the factory succumbed to fire. Arson was suspected. Little is known of the factory – all the documents and blueprints perished in the fire. After the fire, Halliburton went stark-raving mad, and committed suicide. He died, June 6, 1924, in St. Joseph’s Cemetery.

“The town’s been plagued with monsters ever since.” My father looked me dead in the eyes, making sure I was listening. “This is where it gets strange.” Father lowered his voice. “Over time, the monsters multiplied, having crossbred with the living. Ugh. How that’s possible, Lord only knows.”

I was about to intervene, when his eyes cut me in half.

“Meanwhile, the rest of the world remains oblivious. Not surprising, since Gulp is 666 miles north of Toronto. Most people have no idea of its existence. Hell, Gulp isn’t on Google Maps.”He downed his drink and wiped his stubbled face. “If the monsters were to spread into other towns and cities, they would slowly take over the world. Can you imagine our world being run by monsters?”

Honestly, I could, but I smartly kept that to myself.

“Unlike the Quazzars,” Father snarled as he said this, “who tend to be mischievous and incapable of getting along with others, Sleethers use their powers to protect the people of this town. Sleethers, it is said, are as rare as fine jewels. Our lineage MUST be kept secret.”

My stomach was in knots. This was all too much, too fast. What he said next still haunts me:

“If only the people of Gulp could escape, then maybe things would improve. But there is no escape. People try. But something always brings them back.” Father frowned as he said this.

Finally, I spoke up. “But, can’t we destroy the cemetery? Or kill off all the monsters?”

Father shook his head. “I’ve told you all I could, son. And now I must go.”

“But….” I struggled to speak.

“There are RULES,” he snapped. He stood up, removed his fedora, and handed it to me. “My work here is finished. I’ve done all I could. Now it’s up to you, son. You must fulfill your destiny.”

“But…”

He hugged me. It had been years since we embraced. “You’re strong, Sam. Stronger than you know. You must remember this. The rest you’ll figure out as you go.”

He gathered his coat and boots and a few supplies, then he slow-walked to the back door. “Kiss your mother for me. She’s suffering. But remember….” His eyes rolled back as he smiled. “She’s quite capable of taking care of herself.”

He left. And I’ve never seen him again.

Before I could gather my thoughts, Mom came hurrying downstairs with milk and freshly-baked chocolate chip cookies. After one long look at me, she burst into tears. She dropped the tray on the counter, hurried upstairs and slammed her bedroom door. The house hushed.

That was a bad day.

Sadness turned into confusion, followed by self pity. Finally, ANGER. This was stupid! Why would my father say such nonsense? I stormed out of the house, furious and afraid, and marched head-down towards the cemetery. I was wearing my father’s fedora.

“Duder,” a voice crackled across the night, scaring me out of my stupor.

The night was cold and crisp. A quarter moon hung sideways over St. Joseph’s Cemetery, orange and evil-looking. A blanket of fog swept across the cemetery floor. Somewhere a dog barked. I looked up. There was Graveyard Gary, sitting Buddha-like on a tombstone, a fat joint leaning from his lazy lips.

“You’re just in time.” He sparked the joint, inhaled, then went on a coughing spree. When he handed it to me, I refused.

My fists were balls of rage. My teeth clenched. I wanted to strangle him. “This is YOUR fault.” Icy chills coursed through my veins. “YOU did this to me.”

Gary took another toke, coughed, then started laughing like a lunatic. “Sam,” he sneered. “You’re a Sleether. Time you start acting like one.” He rubbed the remainder of his joint onto the tombstone, then put the roach into a tin and shoved the tin into his bulging backpack. I wondered what else he was hiding in there.

The cemetery went quiet. The only sound was my beating heart and Gary’s perpetual wheezing. Gary opened his mouth to speak, when his eyes, big and red and round, darted toward the Halliburton grave. The concern on his face troubled me. And for good reason.

“Quick! Take this!” He shuffled through his backpack and handed me a dagger. It was long and silver, with calligraphy carved into the razor-sharp blade. Its handle was smooth and lined with gold. “I reckon you’ll be needing this.”

My blood chilled. Something was about to happen. Something dangerous. I turned and tripped over a tombstone and swore. Oh, how I hated this insufferable cemetery.Something scurried across my leg: a rat the size of a football. Maybe bigger. Gary shone his flashlight, and I shuddered. The cemetery was swarming with them. But I had bigger problems; namely, Halliburton.

Halliburton howled, sending chills down my spine. Still, I couldn’t see him through the thick layer of fog, but I could certainly hear him, grunting and groaning and mucking about. He wasn’t alone. There were others. More than before. They stank. If you’ve ever smelled a rotting corpse, multiply that by one hundred, and you’ll get the idea.

Gary’s flashlight found Halliburton. I gasped. The monster looked meaner than I’d remembered. And uglier. Its face was gray and thin; random strands of colorless hair sprung from his caved-in skull.

“Sleethers,” Halliburton heckled. “I HATE Sleethers.”

Part of his face fell off. He reached down, picked up his jawbone, and inserted it back into place. Then, with astonishing speed, he tackled me. Before I knew it, he was biting into my shoulder blade, gnawing through bone. Pain shot through me like an arrow. I fought frantically, but I was easily overpowered. Halliburton started clawing my skull, snickering as he squeezed. I begged for mercy. Mercy, this malodorous monster had no intention of giving.

The sick-smelling corpse held me in its grip; it was about to snap my neck, when Gary’s voice shot out like a pistol:

“HALT, IN THE NAME OF EVERYTHING SACRED…”

Halliburton halted. My head dropped like a bag of bricks. As Gary spoke, my strength returned. I jumped to my feet, spoiling for a fight. Halliburton charged at once, his army of imps egging him on. I almost perished – I would have – but instead I shot twenty feet into the air, narrowly avoiding his assault.

Gary flew next to me and gave me a two-thumbs up. He was sweating and struggling to breathe, but his chanting never faulted: “.…HALE TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THE SANCTITY OF THE RIGHTEOUS; THOSE WITH EYES THAT SEE EVERYTHING THAT IS GOOD; THOSE WHO DISPEL EVIL. I CAST AWAY THESE EVIL-DOERS, AND MAY THEY ROT IN PEACE….”

One by one, the corpses collapsed. The creatures clawed, crawled and croaked as they scurried underground; creatures so decrepit, even the rats avoided them. Suddenly, there was only one monster remaining: Halliburton.

I was famished. Apparently, flying takes an abundance of energy. Cautiously, I descended, and was ambushed by a mischief of rats; their beady eyes glowing in the gloom of darkness. I scampered atop a tombstone, but the rats followed me. Soon, I was covered.

“Sam,” Halliburton sneered, his rotting flesh peeling from his face as he spoke. “Prepare to die. Just like your father.” He attacked.Clarity clobbered me. I lunged, plunging the dagger deep into the ghoul’s esophagus. Vile, black ooze exploded at once, soaking me head to toe. Some got into my mouth. The taste was abhorrent, like chewing on worms.

Gary flew next to me. The fear stamped across his pudgy face did little to comfort me. Wheezing, he clutched his chest. Then he collapsed.

“NO,” I cried, dropping to my knees.

Halliburton was delighted. “You can’t save him,” he laughed, while licking his wounds. “Just like you can’t save your father.”

Holding Gary’s cold hand, I prayed for guidance. At once, Father’s voice chimed inside my mind, telling me what needed to be done, and how to do it. I stood tall, and pointed. “Go back to Hell, Halliburton!”

Bombastic bolts of lightning blasted out of me. Halliburton flew back, his tattered rags flaming. A sully layer of smoke wafted above him, quickly spreading. The smell of burning flesh was all-encompassing. Arms flapping, Halliburton floundered. His entire body was ablaze. He snarled. I could feel his hatred burning into me. Hatred so deep, it was [bottomless.Blue](http://bottomless.Blue) and golden thunderbolts flowed out of me,  as I unleashed holy hell.

“Stop it! You insufferable Sleether!” Amidst fiery flames, Halliburton’s body started flickering, going in and out of view. He struggled as he dropped to his bony knees. Something snapped. Then, cursing and cackling, Halliburton gradually descended into the deep, dark cemetery ground. The rats followed.

At once, the cemetery quieted. The only sound was Gary’s wheezing, which was worsening. I rushed to his side, fearing the worst. He looked up at me and forced a smile. “You did it, Sam. I knew you would.” He closed his eyes and stopped breathing.

Standing over Gary, holding his lifeless hand, I wept, thinking of all the people he’s saved, and how no one treated him with respect. Now he was gone, and I was truly alone.

Gary’s hand flinched. His eyes, wild and rosy, snapped open. He winked. Before I could rejoice, a long and squishy fart ruined the moment. I let go of him and rushed to safety. Graveyard Gary forced himself to his feet, produced a spliff, and lit it.

“Takes more than a mean-spirited monster to kill a Quazzar.” He inhaled deeply. “Nice hat, by the way.”

Then came a sonic boom, and I was back at home, consoling my grieving mother, who kept calling my father’s name.

“I’m a Sleether,” I told my grieving mother.

Her eyes were oceans of blue. “I know, Sam.” She smiled sadly. \[“So am I.”\](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/)
