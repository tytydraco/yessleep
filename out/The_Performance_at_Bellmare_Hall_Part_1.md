**Movement 1: Overture**

I hadn’t played a piano since Claire passed away six years ago. She taught me everything: sheet music, posture, patience. Where to loosen up and where to hold tension. She had this heavenly touch when it came to music, soft but deliberate, like her fingers could feel the notes. She was an angel not only in her personality, but in her tune as well.

I wish we could have stayed that way. We could have gotten married, bought a house together, had kids, and grown old with each other.

But then she got diagnosed. Brain cancer. Terminal. It was sudden, and very soon she started to fade. Her eyes lost their glint, her fingers their skill and precision. Eventually, she had to be hospitalized before it all came to an end. In her last few minutes, she told me to keep playing in her memory. I promised her I would as I felt her pulse disappear, holding her hand.

I couldn’t keep my promise, just looking at the keys had me hearing her ghost in every note. I didn’t get rid of the piano, though. It would be like throwing away the last piece of her soul. I kept it covered in a sheet like an unburied corpse. It simply sat there, mourning. Like me.

Then one morning I came into my kitchen and found a letter on the table. I was curious how it got there, but didn’t pay much mind at first. I went to inspect it. It was thick and yellowed, like aged parchment that was just unearthed from a crypt. My full name was written in precise, cursive script—Liam. No stamp, no return address.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. I must’ve been imagining it, because it smelled faintly like Claire’s favorite perfume, some lavender one, but slightly more metallic. It must be her death getting to my senses. I opened the letter and read the text laid bare on it, in the same handwriting of the front.

“To Liam,

You are cordially invited to perform at the Bellmare Concert Hall, located in our old town of Dorset Hollow. One night, one recital.

Compensation: Solace

Mr. Wellers awaits you.”

Just that offer was written, by a name I’ve never heard before, and some faded map at the back. No phone number or email or anything. I actually laughed out loud. Solace? What kind of payment is that? 

Alongside that, I remembered something once. An old story about Dorset Hollow—a fire, they said. Decades ago, the town burned to the ground, swallowed by flames no one could stop. No one ever said what happened after. Not about whether it was rebuilt or left to rot in silence. It was just a ghost of a rumor I barely cared to follow. But now, I was standing on the edge of that forgotten place—with a letter that promised something I didn't quite understand.

I’ll be honest though, it piqued my curiosity. I didn’t decide to take the offer, though. Not at that point. I simply placed the letter back on my kitchen table where I found it.

I dreamed of Claire that night. She was onstage, but not dressed for it. Not in the blue dress she used to wear to her performances. Just herself. Tall, lean. She sat there barefoot in black jeans and a faded Nirvana shirt. Her black hair fell to her shoulders. Her eyes, those deep blue eyes. The kind you look into and can never see the bottom.

She was playing something I didn’t recognize. It was beautiful, yet impossible, like trying to comprehend the full scale of the universe. The music sounded like the concept of grief. Pure, unadulterated grief. Grief so deep it was sacred.

Beneath me, the ground cracked open, and shadowy arms snaked up from the darkness, cold and grasping. They curled around my ankles, dragging me down. I tried to pull away, but they tightened their grip, pulling me deeper into an abyss that smelled of old sorrow and forgotten promises.

Through the shadows, I saw her—Claire—looking down at me. Her face was calm, her eyes full of something I couldn’t name: sorrow, warning, or maybe forgiveness.

“Don’t go,” she said, her voice both near and distant. No fear or worry, just pleading.

I woke up shaking, heart pounding. On my nightstand lay the letter.

I didn’t know why, but I had to find out what it meant. I had to chase the thread of that dream before it pulled me under completely.

The drive took five hours. Back roads all the way. Halfway through, the GPS gave up, so I had to follow the map that was printed on the back of the letter. It was so faint that I could barely make it out. It looked like it was trying to disappear, like it didn’t want to be followed.

The trees grew thicker the closer I got. The road narrowed and the sounds of nature got ever the more hushed. Soon, I could hear nothing but the sound of my engine, but even that started to fade into obscurity. Every bend in the road I took made the sky grow more gray, more dreary, even though there were no clouds. Then I reached the sign.

“Dorset Hollow: A Place for Quiet Reflection”

The town looked preserved. It wasn’t old, wasn’t abandoned, just looked like time had eventually stopped flowing here. They looked like they were from a different time, so I guess that they restored the town to how it looked decades ago after all. Buildings stood straight, yet hollow. The windows were clear, but dark, like they were reflecting moonlight rather than basking in the afternoon glow. The strangest thing was that I didn’t see anyone walking around, yet I knew they were there.

Then I saw the diner. It was simple, modest, but it felt comforting. It looked like it was out of a show and just said DIN(N)ER. Clever. I hadn’t eaten all day, so I pulled in.

The interior looked like it was from 1965. Checkered floors, red booths, even an old jukebox. It smelled like coffee and bacon, with a little bit of floor polish mixed in. Three other customers were seated, an older couple and a guy who looked to be my age. They all looked at me when I entered. They weren’t startled or surprised, just… aware.

I sat down at an empty booth and the waitress came over. Her hair was in a tight ponytail, her lips too red for this tired town. Her smile was perfect, but it didn’t reach her eyes. They looked almost hollow.

“You headed to the concert hall?” she asked as she handed me the menu.

“How’d you know?” I said, wondering what made it obvious.

She shrugged and looked in some general direction. “Not many folks come by here unless they’ve been invited.”

I told her my order but she didn’t write anything down. A few minutes later, she brought me a feast fit for kings. Black coffee and a plate with scrambled eggs and toast. It tasted exactly how breakfast used to taste as a kid. Simple, warm, a little too perfect.

The young man looked at me from his booth. “You play?”

I hesitated a bit before answering, “used to.”

He nodded, like he heard that a million times, before responding, “that’s good enough for Bellmare.”

I forced a smile at him. “You been?”

But he didn’t answer. Just went back to staring at his food.

I reached for my wallet, but the waitress rushed over to stop me.

“It’s covered,” she said.

“By who?”

She just gave a small shrug and said, “Mr. Wellers takes care of his guests.”

“Nice guy”, I said, before tipping her $5 and leaving for Bellmare Hall. It stood at the edge of the town, where the trees became forest. It didn’t fit the town—too big, hollow, imposing. It was made of what looked like marble and stone, like a cathedral for worshiping music. Vines grew up its massive walls like veins, ivy curled around lanterns that still burned, tall stone arches held doors twelve-feet high.

Yet a man stood waiting on its stairs. He was unnaturally tall and scarily thin, fitted into a charcoal-gray suit, and adorning a black top hat under a few tufts of white hair. His skin paper-white and his eyes glazed over. It was like today was his funeral and he forgot to attend.

“You must be Liam,” he said, Southern drawl straight from the bayou. “Mr. Wellers welcomes you.”

His smile was polite, inviting, yet practiced. It didn’t reach his eyes.

“You’re Mr. Wellers?”

He nodded. “Some call me that.”

“Is that what you call you?”

He titled his head to the side and let out a slight smirk, like he was amused by my question. “Mr. Wellers prefers to keep things proper.” 

That didn’t answer anything, but I let it go.

“The folks at the diner said you covered my meal,” I said.

“Wellers takes care of his guests,” he responded and grinned. That grin again, it felt off. Like he imitated it from people he watched, rather than actually feeling anything. He then motioned to the doors and opened them for me. “Shall we?”

As I stepped foot into the building, I almost had a double-take. It was beautiful. The lobby was lit by crystal chandeliers, with red velvet carpets adorning every footstep. The walls were paneled with dark, polished wood that reflected so much light that it hurt to look at for too long. But then we entered the concert hall.

I was in shock, it was massive. Bigger than it should have been, judging by the size of the building from the outside. Rows upon rows of empty seats faced the stage. There laid upon it, like the crown jewel of the town, was the piano. A black lacquer, full grand, in perfect condition. It was like it was never played, but still waited for centuries to perform.

It wasn’t Claire’s piano, I knew that for sure. But something about it seemed so familiar, so comforting. Yet, so off. It simultaneously raised the hair on my arms and made my heart skip a beat.

I stepped toward it slowly. 

“She’s a piece of beauty,” Wellers said behind me. “Specially made for this hall.”

“She looks…” I paused, searching for the right word. “Hungry.”

He chuckled softly. “Music’s always been a hungry thing. Takes what you give it. Sometimes more.”

There was something in his voice. It had a weight to it, a surety. Maybe it was grief. Like he was mourning something yet to happen.

I turned to face him. “You sound like you’re giving a eulogy.”

“Do I?” he said, smooth as ever.

I blinked. That struck me wrong.

“You.. usually refer to yourself in the third person,” I said. “But just this moment, you didn't."

He paused, then smiled and said, “Mr. Wellers finds it…easier that way. Keeps things separate.”

I was about to question him on that, but he quickly gestured towards the piano and said, “You’ll have time to prepare. The recital is tomorrow”

“Why have one anyway? There was barely anyone in town.” I turned towards the empty rows of seats. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw something. A flash of color. A flicker of blue in the far corner of the front row. But the instant I looked directly at it, there was nothing there.
