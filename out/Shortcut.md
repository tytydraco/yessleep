My boss is gonna kill me!

I exclaimed in a worried voice as I quickly got dressed

It was a Monday morning, and I was almost an hour late for work. I quickly got dressed and ran out the front door

I immediately got on my bike and started pedaling as hard as I could. My work was 25 minutes away if I stayed on the road, which was curved but only 13 if I went off the road for a more straight path. I went off the road while pedaling as fast as I possibly could, I was gasping for air when all of a sudden

*CLUNK*

I felt myself flying off my bike as it flipped over, and the both of us hit the ground. I passed out for what seemed like an hour. When I woke up, the only thing I could think about was how late to work I'd be

I was so concerned about work that it took me a while to notice how drastically the environment around me changed. Instead of a cool, sunny morning, I only saw dense fog all around me. Instead of sitting on a thin layer of melting snow, I was sitting in a dying meadow. Questions started to fill my head as my heart started to beat faster and faster

Am I... am I dreaming? Am I in a coma?What's going on?

I eventually gathered myself up and started walking...

The more I walked through this place, the more I lost my mind. I almost felt like I was in... another world. I felt the environment changing and shifting as I walked through it, I kept seeing strange things in the distance

Maybe I'm just tired?

I glanced at my watch when I saw its arms moving at an incredible speed

This is all just a dream! That's it, I just have to... stop dreaming.

As I walked through this hell for another hour, two words kept on repeating in my head

Wake up! Wake up! WAKE UP!

I just couldn't...

I kept on walking when the fog was replaced by heavy rain, the grassland turned into a city, an apocalyptic cesspool of a city.

Ruin surrounded me everywhere I went. The more I walked through this city, the more I felt insane, I started to see creatures zooming past me, watching me from the buildings... or what's left of em. As I kept on walking through the city, the sky began to turn red, the rain turned blood red as the creatures started to stare at me. I felt a sense of dread wash over me as the midnight moon shined through the crimson skies, I ran to the nearest building and hid there, trying as hard as I could to not make a sound, I felt as if... something was trying to kill me. I started to hear screeching and coming from somewhere in the building, I thought of running, but what if all this is a trick made by this place to trick me into going outside? What if I run outside and instantly get split up into cubes?

I decided to stay. I eventually turned around as the noises got louder and louder. You could imagine the look of horror on my face when I turned around to see a hideous demon staring right at me

I felt helpless. Expecting a painful death, I accepted my fate and closed my eyes as tears poured out of them, but instead of being split in half, I heard the rain disappear along with the demon. I opened my eyes to find myself in the grassland again, thick fog surrounded me, so thick that the light of the moon couldn't shine through it

I had no choice but to walk. I kept on walking through the fog as the creatures stared at me from a distance

WHEN WILL THIS ALL END?! WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS?!!

I yelled out as I collapsed on the floor

I just couldn't walk anymore...

After staying down for what seemed like an hour, I saw a man rapidly approaching me, I wanted to get up, but I couldn't 

We've had enough fun, it seems.

He said in a well-mannered voice 

WHO ARE YOU?! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM M-

He started laughing, his eyes turned crimson red as a wide smile was drawn across his face. I saw him snap his fingers before I passed out...

I woke up to see a concerned man calling someone on his phone

Oh, thank God!

He said when he saw me waking up

I tried to get up, but I collapsed in pain

Call an ambulance!

I told him

That's what I'm doing. The paramedics should be here soon. Rest

Ok... ok, thanks, friend. I would've probably been food for some bear if you hadn't stumbled upon me!

I eventually passed out again, I was woken up as the ambulance arrived

Hey, get up! The paramedics are here.

Ok, thanks again!

I remembered what I experienced as the paramedics put me in the ambulance, I thought it was all a dream until I saw the man staring at me as his eyes turned crimson red and a smile was drawn on his face
