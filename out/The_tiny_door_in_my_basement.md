My name is Eric Andrew, and I am having some issues with my new house. It all started when I moved into my new house. I have worked my hands to the bone to afford rent in some small, backwater, middle-of-nowhere town. When I was taking a tour of the house, a few months before I bought it, I must have failed to notice the tiny door at the bottom of the basement stairs. The door is approximately 1 and a half to 2 feet tall. Why I never heard mention of this door, I have no clue, and maybe it was mentioned and I just missed it. When I moved in the door didn’t concern me because I was too busy unpacking and arranging my house in the way I like it. I spent the first week trying to get used to my new house. When I finally did notice the small door, I was hit with a sense of confusion for I had not seen the door when I had toured the house nor when I had moved in.  
it seemed as if it had appeared when I moved it. The seller failed to mention the door when I was talking to them about the room count. I reached down and tried to open the door only to find it did not budge, as if the concrete of the basement was put around it. I was sitting there one night and noticed a small glint reflecting at me from the basement door. When I sat up I saw it disappear. I chalked it up to the light reflecting off of something on the stairs. Then I realized that I put everything in the attic, there is nothing in the basement that could be reflective. I walked up to the basement door and threw open the door. There was nothing down there, but I did hear a slight creak from something. I practically fell down the stairs with the sheer speed in which I ran down there. I got down there just in time to see the small wooden door close. I don't like to consider myself a horror film fan but I'm no stranger to horror movies, I am not pushing my luck any further.  
I went back upstairs and headed over to my attic hatch and opened it. I climbed up and grabbed the heaviest boxes I could without falling. I carried it down stairs and set it in front of the tiny door. This was a decent 10 pound box and now it was sitting in front of a door that, as far as I know, does not open. I left the basement and made sure the door was closed. I had enough action for one night and headed to bed. The next few days were uneventful but I had started to notice a few smaller things going missing; a pen here, a roll of toilet paper there, a piece of food every once in a while, but nothing major. Just like a few nights ago; I was sitting on my couch watching mindless television when I noticed something; the basement door was almost completely open. I never opened the door since that night, and now it was open enough a person could fit through. I walked up to the door and peered into the darkness, and I could swear, the darkness was peering back. I waited for my eyes to get adjusted to the unusual darkness, and saw that the box was still in front of the door, not moved since I put it there.  
I noticed there was stuff all around the door, in a sort of circle. There were pens, toilet paper, rotting food, cups, silverware, and everything else that had gone missing. As I was about to go collect all my stuff I saw movement out of the corner of my eye and decided that I would just get it in the morning. I then left the house and drove until the main road of this god-forsaken town ended. I turned around and when I pulled into my driveway I saw my living room curtain move, and a shadow slink away from the window. I left and stayed at the nearby motel. I called the police about a possible intruder and they said that they would send someone to look into it. They called me later that night to tell me that there was no sign of forced entry nor was there anyone inside, they did however tell me that my basement door was open all the way. I stayed at that motel for the next few days until I worked up the courage to go back home. When I got there I noticed that all my dishes, cups, silverware, and kitchen utensils were gone. And when I checked they were in the basement. I couldn’t help but fear what was down there. Against my best judgment I walked down those old, creaking stairs to get all my stuff back from the basement.  
In one trip I was able to recover all my stuff. I put it all back where it all belongs. I looked back to the basement and saw a long, dark, gnarled hand slink back into the darkness. I ran over to the doorway and almost threw myself down the stairs to see this thing. I pulled the chain to turn on the light. I threw the box across the room and pulled and shoved on this damn door. I got frustrated and kicked the door, with that it shook in its frame. I turned off the light and went back up the stairs and made sure the door was closed and for once I locked the door and for once I had a good night's rest, only to be abruptly interrupted by a loud bang. I stood from my bed and walked down the hall and again;  
BANG  
I walked with each bang getting louder and louder.  
BANG  
I get into my living room for one final loud and earth shattering bang.  
BANG  
I couldn’t possibly think of what could be on the other side of that door. I walked up to it, ready to scream bloody murder. I opened the door to see an empty stairway, it was empty, not a thing. I walked down the stairs, not caring about anything else anymore. I crouched down in front of the door.  
I tried the knob and found it to give way, I twisted until I could no more, and with that tiny door was open. It was a brick wall, there was nothing on the other side, not even a space for something. For the first time since I moved in, I smiled, I must have been making it all up, it was all in my head. I closed the tiny door and walked up the stairs. As I was about to reach the door I heard a creak behind me and I turned around just in time to see the tiny door slam shut. I ran over to it but the door knob was locked again. There wasn’t even a knob on the other side, how was it locked, there was no way to lock it from this side so it had to be locked by whatever was on the other side, but there was nothing over there. As I sat there in my basement with all these thoughts the knob started to twist, but I wasn’t touching the door, hell, I was 2 feet from the door itself. It opened and a rat squeaked out, on the other side of the doorway was a void, no brick wall, no light, not an ounce of color, nothing. I was about to crawl in when a large dark hand reached out and slammed the door shut. I threw myself back and sat there staring at the door. Just then, it started growing in size, taller and taller, wider and wider. It was just as tall as my ceiling, then the door knob started twisting again. I didn’t wait to see what came out this time, I ran, I ran like my life depended on it, because it did.  
I made it up the stairs. I closed and locked the basement door. I ran for the front door but outside was the same endless nothing that I saw before. A sudden slam against the door shook me from my thoughts and I ran for my room. I hid under the bed like a scared little kid. I waited there, listening, waiting for something to happen, for it to come get me. When it walked in the room I saw its skinny legs, and large hands dragging across the floor. It made this awful noise, like a dog choking on a football. It was constantly gasping for air and gargling. I had the thought that if I could make it through the door I could make it to reality. So when the beast was on the other side of my bed I made a run for it. When it noticed me it let out this blood curdling scream that would shatter glass if wanted. I ran for the door, I could hear it right behind me, destroying stuff as it went.  
When I made it to the basement stairs I tripped or it grabbed me, I don't remember. Either way I was tumbling head of heels down the stairs, as I landed my arm made a sickening crack. I stood up and threw myself into the void that was on the other side of that damn door. I fell and hit the floor, head first. I woke up in the hospital with my arm in a cast and bandage around the right side of my head. I was questioned by the police, all I told them was that I didn’t know what happened that night. They told me that my neighbors had mentioned hearing loud crashing and when the police came to my house they found it in a wreck and I was at the bottom of my stairs, in front of that door. I’ve moved away and am now living with a friend of mine until I can find a new place to live. Now I see why that house was so cheap.
