On February 12th, I moved into my first house. It was an old country home—three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a ton of potential. I’d bought it cheap, planning to renovate and flip it. It was a side hustle I’d always wanted to try. The pictures online made it look run-down but charming. Real “diamond in the rough” stuff.

When I pulled up late that night, I knew something was off.

The place looked abandoned. Not just old—forgotten. Some of the windows were broken or boarded up, and the whole house had this sagging, hollow look, like it was caving in on itself. I told myself it was just worse in the dark, and I’d already bought it. Might as well see what I was working with.

I grabbed a couple of boxes from the truck and stepped inside.

The cold hit first. The air felt still and heavy, like no one had moved through it in years. Dust covered every surface. Dead mice in the cabinets. Broken furniture tucked into corners.

Still, I kept unpacking. I’d already come this far.

Upstairs, there were four doors—three bedrooms and a bathroom. The first two rooms were empty except for old furniture. I was walking out of the second when I heard it:

SLAM.

It came from the front door.

I froze.

From the top of the stairs, I saw movement through the cracked living room window. A tall, dark figure skittering across the front yard. I ran downstairs and flipped on the porch light, but when I opened the door… nothing.

I stepped outside to check around the house. Still nothing.

But when I came back inside, something made my stomach turn.

The front door handle was covered in wet mucus. And on the floor—footprints. Not human. Webbed. Slimy. They stopped right where I’d left a box… then led back to the door… and then to another box.

It had been inside. Retracing my path through the house.

What is wrong with this house? First, it looked nothing like the listing. Now this? Furniture left behind. Signs no one had lived here in years. And something walking around inside with me?

I needed to leave.

I reached into my pocket—no keys.

Panic hit hard.

I tore through the house, checking every room, flipping boxes, yanking open drawers. Nothing. Then I went into the kitchen.

That’s when I saw them.

My keys—stuck to the outside of the window. Above them, in smeared writing:

“Looking for these?”

It was watching me. Playing with me.

I had two options: try to get the keys or take off running for the nearest town, which was twenty miles away through dense woods. I couldn’t outrun whatever this was or at least I didn't want to try.

I had to try for the keys.

I ran upstairs and ducked into the room above the kitchen. I figured if I could get a good angle, I could jump down, grab the keys, and run before it noticed me.

I waited.

The house creaked. Time dragged. Minutes? Hours?

Then—I heard it.

A chirp. Not a bird. No, this was different. Rhythmic. Electronic. Artificial.

I wasn’t waiting around to find out what it was doing.

I jumped out the window, rolling awkwardly on impact. I sprinted for the kitchen window, peeled the keys off the glass, and took off, ducking low to avoid the windows. I was almost around the front of the house when—

Chirp.

I froze.

It was close. I couldn’t risk being seen. I turned and bolted for the trees.

That’s when I saw it—a shed.

Small. Rotting. Half-hidden behind the treeline. There was nothing about it in the listing, nothing that should’ve been there. But I needed cover.

I crept toward it, trying to stay low.

The wind picked up. The trees groaned. And then—

Chirping.

Louder. Closer.

I rushed inside the shed and slammed the door behind me.

There wasn’t much—just some boxes, and a busted shelf. But in the middle of the floor, half-covered by an old rug, was something I never expected to find.

A metal hatch.

I pulled it open. The smell hit instantly—hot, wet air that reeked of rotting fish. Below, a red light blinked in a huge metal chamber. A ladder stretched down maybe fifteen feet.

And the chirping—so loud now.

Then I saw it.

The dark figure, sprinting toward me.

I got on the ladder as fast as I could. 

I slipped on the ladder. Fell hard. The floor knocked the air from my lungs. My vision blurred. I looked up and saw it step into the red light.

It wasn’t human.

Scales. a twisted face. Glowing orange eyes.

And then—darkness.

When I woke up, I was here. Wherever “here” is.

It's pitch black. and I'm in stand water. Every surface is covered in that thick mucus, and somewhere far away, a red light still blinks.

My leg’s messed up. I can’t walk. I can barely crawl.

And I’m not alone.

That thing... it’s here too. I can hear it. That same chirping, coming in bursts, like it’s trying to locate me.

But there’s one more thing.

Gerald.

I don’t know how to explain him. He’s… a fish, I think. I found him or maybe he found me. He’s been here since I woke up. Just swimming in place. Just watching me.

He’s the only thing keeping me sane.

If someone finds this—don’t come looking for me.

Just stay away.
