I \[M39\] keep finding my son \[M3\] eating maggots and I don't know where he's finding them. 

My son Jake is like any other adventurous three-year-old. He is constantly on the move, bouncing off walls,  screaming his head off, and being an overall pain in my neck. But despite all the headaches he causes, I love him dearly. His mother and I are no longer together. She has no contact with him, so I have full custody. To say that I am ecstatic about that fact is an understatement. I may have loved his mother with all my heart at one point, but she really went off the rails after her parents died. I tried to make it work for the sake of my son, but no matter what I did for her she never got better. 

She would spend hours on end rocking in the corner of the living room, sobbing at the memory of her departed mother and father. When I would try to console her she would lash out, screaming profanities and for me to leave her alone. I tried to give her the space she needed to morn, taking my son out to the park after work, so she wouldn't have to deal with his high energy. I also didn't want her to feel the need to humor me after I'd arrived home from a long day's work. 

Months passed and she continued to rock in the corner. I finally decided to get her the help she needed. One of the few times she was in good spirits, I approached her. Grasping her by the hands and giving her a loving peck on her forehead, I gazed into her eyes. When our eyes locked I could see a sliver of hope when a loving smile inched across her face. I just prayed that what I was about to suggest wouldn't send her into a rage. 

"Honey?" I broke the silence. Her brow rose at the sound of that word, it was the first time in a long time she'd heard that word spoken without the weeping of her sorrow. It made me that much more nervous to tell her about the counseling appointment I had scheduled for her later that week. 

"Honey, I'm extremely worried about you. You've had a rough couple of months and it's breaking my heart to see you in so much pain." Her eyes dropped to the floor in her self-disappointment. 

"I know babe, I'm trying I really am." She responded. 

"I know you are." Taking my hand, I gently placed it on the underside of her chin, nudging her face back at mine. 

"You know I love you right?" She nodded somberly. 

"And it is because I love you that I think we should get you help." Her face dropped as I mentioned the word help, as I knew it would. The fear of my wife's anger propelled me to explain my reasoning to her. 

"I just don't think that it's healthy for you to be in so much pain all the time. It's breaking my heart to know that nothing I do can bring your parents back to you. Jake is also really worried about you, he misses the mom he used to have, and it's getting to the point where I'm afraid to leave him alone with you. I get home from work to find him still in his nighttime PJs, his face covered in whatever food he found at eye level in the pantry. I've made an appointment for you at the counseling center this week." 

She stood there for a minute or two digesting the information I had just given her, her expression void until she finally snapped. 

"So, not only do you think I'm crazy! You also think I'm a danger to my own son!?" She pushed and swatted at me, making me fall back onto the couch. My son was watching CocoMelon at the time but had preferred to watch his Mom and Pop's interaction. He broke into a cry as my backside graced the couch cushion. My wife picked him up by the armpits and stormed off to the bedroom, locking me outside. 

It made me feel like such an ass to have accused my wife of being threatening to our loving boy. I slept on the couch that night tossing and turning as I dwelled on how badly I messed up. The sun finally peered through the window and I rose for work, just before I left the house I pressed my ear to our bedroom and I heard my wife's voice whispering and my son's laughter. Despite enraging her the night before, our talk seemed to have some positive effects. I left feeling hopeful that things were going to get better. 

Later that afternoon, I walked through the door to a quiet house. As the front door closed behind me I stood there for a minute and in the silence I heard the faint sounds of whispers in the direction of our bedroom and then my son's giggle.  'They must be playing in our bedroom' I thought to myself. I crept in quietly so as to not disturb my family's playtime. I reached the bedroom, poking around the door frame, my heart dropped. 

The furniture was cleared out of the room. On the hardwood floor was a white chalk pentagram, and in the center my son, tied at four ends by rope, stakes drilled in the wood. My wife sat beside the chalk symbol, engaged in her normal rocking. Only this time she whispered a horrific prayer.  

"Lord, bring them back. Please, lord, bring them back." Over and over the prayer never stopped. The floorboard must've creaked because my son noticed my presence. His face lit up and he screamed in excitement. 

"Look, Daddy! Where making chalk outline like we do outside!" He giggles in his joy and my wife stops the prayer to look over at me. She lunged at me, screaming to get out.

"Get out! Get out of my house!" She hit my chest and tried to shove me out but I would not budge. I picked up my phone and dialed the police. They carried her away after I explained the situation I had walked in on, my claims supported by the artwork on my bedroom's floor. She was ordered to stay in a mental institute until her mental state improved. When she proved her sanity she would be let go, but would only have supervised visits with my son for the time being. I wish that was the end of this story but the weeks that followed were an absolute nightmare. 

I am the sole provider for my family, I work a construction job while my wife stays home to care for Jake. It was an arrangement that was not ideal. We were almost broke, my salary could barely keep up with our bills, and despite our situation, my wife was better off being a housewife. She has never held a job, and while two incomes would've been wonderful, we would have to pay for daycare. Where we live, daycare is about $700 a month. It's absurd. The money that my wife would be making each month would almost all go towards childcare, so it just made more sense for her to raise our son at home. This, however, left me in a very precarious situation when she was institutionalized. There was no one left to care for my son while I was at work. Thankfully, I have worked with my employer for a very long time and have accrued the maximum amount of PTO for a senior employee. It was a godsend because it gave me enough time to stay home with my son for a few weeks while I figured out my next move. 

On the first day of my vacation, I decided to take my son to the zoo. He loves animals and could spend hours upon hours looking at lions, tigers, and elephants. It was a well-deserved reward after being cooped up with my mentally unstable wife for so long. It warmed my heart to see him so happy. However, I noticed him acting a bit strange. He would always walk with his hands in his pockets. He looked like a little old man taking a leisurely stroll with his hands tucked away in his jeans. Then I remembered that I had the strange habit of walking like that as well, I rationalized that he was just trying to be like daddy. 	

We stopped for ice cream and the Zoo's shop, and as he was licking his rocky road, I saw the horror. He reached into his pocket and fisted a handful of these tiny white jelly beans into his mouth. To my disgust, they wriggled in his hands, squirming from every little crevice of his tiny little hand. I darted forward slapping his hand clean. I almost vomited as I realized what the jelly beans really were. A handful of maggots. I picked him up and ran over to the gift shop, buying a little pair of cargo shorts the store had. It is no strange occurrence that childern soil their pants, I was thankful for the Zoo's foresight. I promptly changed his in the bathroom, tossing the maggot-filled pair of jeans into the trash. We hurried home so I could give him a good long bath. 

A few days later we were sitting on the couch, his favorite shows on repeat as we rested in the living room. Soon he got tired, kids often have a very short attention span. I allowed him to do his own thing, playing with his toys, running to the pantry for a snack (after a good meal of course), and even playing at gymnastics. I stayed on the couch, flipping through the TV, Jake always within sight. 

Like I said my son is loud and adventurous, so it was odd when I saw him sitting criss-cross on the floor, as quiet as a mouse, his back towards me. It made me uneasy to see him so still, so I stood up to see what captivated his attention so intently. Looking over his shoulder I saw my size ten work boot, in his hands. I saw him putting things into the shoe hole and to my terror, it was the little white jelly beans again. I ripped the shoe from his grasp and forced him to look at me. 

"Jake! Where did you get these!" I demanded. As I looked at his fearful little face I could see that it was covered in a powdery black substance that smelled chard. I didn't know what horror to address first, so I ran him to the kitchen sink and washed the bugs off his hands. Taking a towel, I cleaned the black powder off his face. The bugs are disgusting, yes, but I needed to know if I was going to have to call poison control for whatever he ingested. 

"Jake," I said calmly.

"Jake buddy what did you eat?" He pointed to the pantry. 

"You want to show me?" He grabbed me by the finger and led me to the food cash. He rummaged through its contents and pulled a little beige vase from the lowest shelf. I almost fainted when I realized what it was. It was my mother-in-law's ashes. Her F-ing ashes? I snatched it out of his hands and tossed the damn thing in the trash. Yes. I tossed my mother-in-law's ashes into the trash. I panicked, what can I say? 

The ern shattered as it hit the bottom of the container. I sat at my dining room table in defeat. My head slumped, I turned my head to Jake. I posed the question. 

"Jake? Where are you getting the little white bugs?" He pointed to my boots and responded 

"Bugs." Enthusiastically.

"Yes bud, bugs, but where are they coming from?" He pointed back to my boots and restated the last. 

"Bugs." 

I gave up, and instead of pressing the issue further I went on Amazon and ordered as many home security cameras as I could. I needed to find out where this kid was getting these damn maggots. 

Once the cameras arrived I placed them throughout the house. There would be zero privacy in my little humble abode, for the time being of course. Now it was all a waiting game. 

A week later I sat down to look through all the video footage, by that time whatever was rotting in my house was starting to stink. Believe me, I cleaned the place extremely well, I left no stone unturned when the smell started to penetrate my nostrils, it had to be the source of the maggots. There were days of footage to review, so I sat Jake in front of the TV hoping he would leave me to my work. Morning turned to noon, noon to dusk, and the security cameras had not given me any results. That is until the bedroom camera captured something extremely strange. Two nights prior, there was a scene captured of Jake sitting fully upright on the bed. Ever since his mom was committed he was sleeping in my bed, only this night he wasn't sleeping. That night he just sat there. 

I sped the footage up to 4x the normal speed, and as I tossed in turned for hours on end, he just sat there. Until early that morning sometime before the sun rose, Jake hopped out of bed and walked over to the nightstand. He pulled out my wife's eyebrow tweezers and headed to the foot of the bed where my leg hung off. For the next half hour or so he picked and slashed at the bottom of my soles, I, however, never awoke. I finally saw Jake take his tiny little fingers and pick something off my foot, placing it into his mouth. Then I heard my wife's voice faintly whisper in the audio. 

"Is it good?" 

"Yes, Mommy" Jake responded turning to face an empty corner of the room. 

"You see, I always feed my little boy." Jake smiled warmly. Then it dawned on me. I ripped the socks off of my feet, twisting my right leg onto my knee. In a mangled mess of rotten flesh, the maggots wiggled their way in and out of the open wounds. 

"Bugs,"  Jake said as he somehow made his way to my side. I let out a yelp and inched back away from my son. He took his hand and picked one of the maggots off of my foot, plopping it into his mouth. I wanted to slap it away but was too stunned to do so. I finally built up the courage and scooped up my son running him out to the car.  As I sped to the emergency room, I kept Jake in my line of sight, directly in the center of the rearview mirror. 

I was rushed back to a quiet little room in the emergency department. The doctor's gloved hand took my footwear off, and he winced as the smell hit him. 

"Looks like our little friends are helping us out here." 'helping' I thought to myself. 

"Mr. Bliss, do currently have diabetes or a family history of diabetes?" I thought for a second and remembered my mom was on insulin. 

"My mom is a diabetic," I say. 

"Why do you ask?" 

"Well, Mr. Bliss, this is not the first time I've seen this. It is common for diabetics to lose feeling in their feet, so they are unable to sense when their soles get injured. These injuries often get infected leading to complications." He gestures over to my discolored soles. 

"But you see these little guys here." Plucking a squirmy maggot off my foot. 

"These little guys have been eating away at the dead flesh. Preventing the infection from spreading as fast as it could've. To be honest with you Mr. Bliss, I don't know how you're not septic yet, your feet are in bad shape. It pains me to say this, but I think your feet might need to be amputated." My face met my palms. 

"I'll have to call a surgeon for a consult, but I think he will come to the same conclusion. You are very lucky to still be alive. I'll be back to check on you in a few." The doctor looks over at Jake. 

"Buddy, you take care of your dad when I'm away okay." Jake smiles giving a polite little nod, his legs swigging off the edge of the chair. The room's door closes. Jake and I sit quietly but I can feel him looking me off to the side. I finally turn, returning his gaze. The edges of his mouth break into a smile and he speaks. 

"Bugs." 

It looks like I'm going to be spending a lot more time with my son at home.
