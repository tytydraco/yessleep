'Do you know the time?'



It is a question we have all asked before and will continue to ask until we expire. I find myself asking it more as of late, like I am lost, but not in the sense that I am in the wrong place.



It does not feel like anything is faster or slower. I know that today is Tuesday; I know tomorrow is Wednesday. I know that my favorite brand of popcorn takes exactly 2 minutes in my 80s-era microwave and the sun sets at 5pm.



When I look at the clock, it says the right time, and when it ticks, it takes 60 ticks to make a minute as it should be. I have checked my analog clock, digital clock, the clocks on both my computer and phone, and they will all be accurate.



But somehow still, something feels wrong, so very wrong.



I recently turned 18, and it felt terrible knowing I am an adult because I feel so young yet so old. I know that my body is roughly 18 years old. But it feels... older?



Not in the same vain as some people who say 'Oh, 18 is so old; what were the 1890s like?' Sure, my bones crack and pop like a millennials, and my face has wrinkles from unnecessary stresses. However, my form genuinely feels closer to death than it is to birth - like buying a car that is actually older than the seller says it is. 



This feeling stands out so much; an activity has consumed my days; I check the time religiously, similar to how some people with OCD or hypochondria wash their hands after doing nothing. Sometimes I even triple check by counting aloud or in my head to 60, 120, 180, etcetera - and then check the clock if it kept up with me. - but like racing your reflection, it is always the right time.



Now, I can understand if this was all just paranoia, maybe because I turned 18, and I'm afraid of growing up quickly, maybe because mortality is a common subject in my mind's untidy file cabinet. But it cannot be just paranoia. Not anymore.



This morning I did my 'normal' routine. I woke up, checked the time of the 3 clocks scattered evenly in my room, then made breakfast using the stove timer. Afterward, I timed each of my bathroom tasks (toilet, brushing my teeth and washing my face). After I wiped my face dry, put my glasses back on and glimpsed into the bathroom mirror - which reflects the clock that I programmed to have a backwards display, so I would not miss the time, although I was not looking directly at it - I noticed my reflection was different.



Even at a split second glance, I could tell something was amiss. Was the room smaller? Did the condensation stay after my father's 6am shower? Was there something on my face I had missed?



The imaginary buzzer blared as I checked the first 2 ideas. I checked my face in the mirror, gently pulling and prodding my face for teenage acne or a random freckle I had forgotten about.



My heart skipped a beat as I stopped. My hand. My hand was wrong. It was subtle, so it makes sense it would take me 3 seconds to notice. My index finger is skinny, almost boney. That wouldn't normally scare anyone, but it frightened me to my very core, because I'm a considerably larger girl, meaning my fingers typically have a child-like fatty look.



This discovery shook me so badly; I had stopped subconscious counting. What was probably 7 seconds felt like 7 years before I noticed the beads of scared straight sweat beading on my forehead along with the goosebumps and raised hairs everywhere. 



I carefully examined it, as if my own finger was going to jump out and bite me. It reminded me of how my older sister looked when I last visited her, complaining about her first grays coming in. I attempted to moisturize and massage my digit, hoping it would come back to life. Then I remembered the time.



Last time the reflected click said 11:56 am, but now it says 12:01 pm, which, for all I know, was correct. Although the actions of getting the small tub out of the cabinet and rubbing it over my finger felt like just 1 or 2 minutes, 5 had passed. I checked the countless clocks around my home, and then were all adjusted to a T.



I still have no idea if I am unconventional or if everything else is, but I do know that fingers do not age faster than your hand, arm, or body. I've scheduled an appointment for a week from now to see if there's a reasonable explanation for my crone-like finger. I have wrapped it up for now because that felt like a good idea. I just hope that it stays like that till Wednesday. Wish me luck.
