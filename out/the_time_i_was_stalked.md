This happend around 3 years ago, in the winter of 2019.  I live in an apartment building with one of those huge echo-ey car parks on the bottom floor. before i go any further this building is very old and pretty run down, there is a large amount parking spaces but not many people live there anymore, and everyone who does is alot older than i am.

I, a 26F and at the time this took place 23F. I have a job working night-shift in an office building (11pm-4am)  I live pretty far so i usually get home around 5am. I live alone, no boyfriend, and im not really in contact with my family anymore. I get home from work one night from an early shift that ended at 3:30am. I parked my car and went into my apartment as usual, however my apartment does not look the same as it did when i left it. I know for a fact no one else has a key so my first thought jumped to a break in. But that thought was cut short when i examined my house to see that nothing was broken, stolen, or tampered with.

The next couple of days i would make sure to lock all doors and windows until i knew there was no possible way anybody could have gotten in. But again, every night for the next week my apartment would look different every time i came back from work. It started simple with small decor being moved and food from the fridge moving places, but soon started to become more and more noticeable such as chairs moving from one side of the room to the other and at one point my TV playing when i knew i had never turned it on.

I decided to take more of a look into this and buy a few security cameras to install around the house. they cameras were small and you wouldnt notice them unless pointed out, So i lock my door get in my car. Later on in the night while sitting in my office scrolling through instagram my phone buzzes with a notification telling me motion was detected in my living room. I was relieved i finally had proof to show the police, I quickly clicked on the notification but the recording of the "motion" in my living room was gone. Just a black screen as if something were covering the camera, I got another notification a half hour or so later, puzzled i click on it and theres my living room re-arranged with the TV playing, i take a screenshot to show one of my close friends, lets call him Andy and he immediately responds back "what the actual fuck is that??" I froze, he had sent a screenshot zoomed in under my couch showing a low quality face, but you see, not just any face. the face of my ex boyfriend who went missing almost 5 years ago now. I ran to the bathroom and threw up, I rushed back home but he was nowhere to be found i checked the whole apartment over, and over, but nothing.

A few days later i got a letter through the letterbox. There was no name of sender or adress of sender just a plain envelope. it read: dear (my name which i will not say on here for personal reasons) Ive been watching you. Quite frequently now, every day even. Im sorry but karmas really fucked you over this time, (my name) ill see you soon.

At this point im terrified, and i had so many questions. Who sent this? was it my ex boyfriend? how soon really is soon? should i be worried? and the question that really had me stumped, if i buried him so deep, how could he possibly be alive?
