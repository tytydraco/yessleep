My name is Jake. This is a story that happened not so long ago. I was walking home from work, having heard a cover of a popular song on the radio playing through a car speaker. I was walking, and found myself playing the original of the song in my head (I guess I preferred it). I was walking past an alleyway and I happened to glance down, and I saw a Guy dressed up as a Clown holding an umbrella, humming to himself and shuffling back and forth.

I thought to myself "what?" and stopped in my tracks. There was something that felt deeply wrong about this individual. Every part of my being told me not to trust him, to get away. He instantly turned, and I noticed that there was something completely fucked about his face. His face was stretched and crooked. The appearance unsettled me. The outline of his face and head looked more like something that had been drawn on paper. Yet his eyes resembled windows, and his mouth was shaped like a crooked doorway.

He spoke to me somehow, without any facial motion, and said "...Can't you see me? Aren't you smiling?". His high-pitched voice sounded dizzy and nauseous. It felt like sounds had began before the words came out, then the words also seemed to reverberate in my head.

"Excuse me?" I replied. But he didn't reply - he just kept humming to himself, dancing with his umbrella.

I was already spooked so I just hurried on. I figured it was just some crazy Guy, but my gut seemed to disagree. I mean, you can dismiss anything, right? But there was little explanation for how he'd looked, like something out of a bad dream. His crooked doorway of a mouth in particular was beyond explanation.

A short while later I got home. I lived in an apartment on the outskirts of Elmbrook, nice enough little place. It was getting near dark. I tried to turn on the TV, but it only showed static. Whatever. I switched it off. I looked out my window across the street, and my gaze fixated on a particular house across the way. The windows looked like eyes, the door looked like a mouth. Was I okay?

I closed the curtains, said "fuck that". There was no need to scare myself. I figured I was just a little shook from earlier. Right that very moment though, the TV flicked on all by itself. I saw a human face on the screen. It was a Guy in perhaps his mid-40s, and he had sallow skin and a withered appearance. He started repeating this:

"He called John  a serial killer. He called Jane a cannibal. He called John a serial killer. He called Jane a cannibal".

Although he was speaking, it was more like his face kept shifting from frame to frame with his mouth opening and closing, rather than a normal face enunciating. "He called John a serial killer. He called Jane a cannibal". He kept going on and on and on. I was fucking shook. I tried to turn the TV off with the remote, then at the box. It didn't work. I pulled the plug out of the wall. It didn't work.

"He called John a serial killer. He called Jane a cannibal. He called John a serial killer. He called Jane a cannibal".

I was panicking and spoke to the TV, saying "Who?"

The TV Man kept doing the thing, but a high-pitched voice echoed through the room, apparently not a reply to my question, saying "Don't look in the mirror".

What? (thinking to myself). Why shouldn't I? The voice had rung a bell. It reminded me of that Clown. I was too afraid to speak again. This was not a time for talking to what seemed to be voices in my head. I admit this was a moment I began to doubt my sanity.

I walked over to the TV. The man kept repeating the line. I considered moving it, putting the TV away somewhere. Instead I went into my bedroom and lay on my bed to give myself time to think. I could still hear the Man in the other room. My thoughts were racing. Who were John and Jane? Don't look in the mirror? I decided not to. After about fifteen minutes of lying there scared, I noticed that the sound of the TV in the other room had stopped. I went in to inspect it. Sure enough, the Man was gone from the screen as well. I told myself I wasn't imagining this shit, it was too real. I didn't fuck with drugs (just tobacco), and this had all felt too real to be a dream.

I was unwilling to try to turn the TV back on to watch something normal, or look in the mirror. I lit a cigarette, and smoked it much faster than normal, more wary and disorientated than pretty much ever. I put the filter in the ashtray. I tried to read something, some old novel, but my concentration wasn't there. I lay on my bed until around 11pm, then went to bed. My mind in tatters, I'd say it was around 2am before I actually slept.

The next day went kind of normal comparatively. I worked as a barista at a Café not so far from my apartment. Okay job. I took an alternate path to work. When I got there, I made a point of not looking into any mirrors. Other than that I just went through the motions, I figure it was obvious I was stressed, but I wasn't about to open up about my experience of the previous night. I was friends with a Woman named Kara who frequented the Café, and she commented on the bags under my eyes. "Too many late nights", I said - and simulating normality I grinned, she laughed and went off as normal. I guess I appeared fine (relatively speaking) but in my head - different story. Nothing about the other Day had been congruent and I wanted to forget it as soon as possible. I clocked out at 6pm, walked home the normal route - but I avoided even looking near the same alleyway where I saw the Clown, very deliberately. I arrived back at my apartment. Should I even try to watch TV? I decided to forget it. I went to my bedroom. My mind was in for something much worse.

When I got to my room, I saw the Clown from the other Day. He was standing in the corner, with the umbrella in his hand. I noticed that the tip was incredibly sharp. He spoke:

"Trying to avoid me, I see. But you shouldn't hide. We can be friends, no?".

"Who are you?" I replied.

"My name is Thweep! Can't you see me? Aren't you smiling?"

"What?... What do you want?"

"Oh, just to warn you. Don't look in the mirror. Even if they tell you to".

"Tell me... Who?"

"You're not to look in any mirror ever again".

Thweep then ran towards me, took his umbrella and plunged it into my neck. Suddenly, with that, I woke up on the sofa, in my apartment, facing the TV. I was shocked. What the hell?

The mad Clown from the alley and this seeming nightmare was telling me not to look in the mirror. I was freaking out, I thought maybe I was dead. 'I don't believe this is even happening' was my overriding thought. The stress got me in a fight-or-flight mode, and I reflexively looked over at the mirror. Instead of seeing my reflection, there was simply a black background with a large red number '10' painted across it. I stared at it shortly, then blinked. There was then a large number 9. I blinked again, it was a number 8. FUCK. I looked away in a panic. It must have been some sort of countdown. If I let it get down to 0, what would happen? I didn't exactly want to find out so I fled - I opened my door, locked the apartment and walked briskly. I had no idea where to go, what my plan was, but I was sure as hell I didn't want to stick around because my apartment might as well have been cursed at this point.

I walked around the streets for about 20 minutes, then I had a thought. I felt compelled to go for a walk in a nearby parkway, something seemed to draw me there and I figured it was a good distraction regardless. It seemed foreboding at dark though - the trees were all nearly skeletal, it being late autumn, as they brushed against the wind. There was a chill in the air that brought a shiver and the sky was dark beneath pale grey clouds mostly covering the stars, but I could see the moon through a crack in the clouds to my upper right. I looked forward and saw a Man and a Woman standing there, right in front of me. I stopped to see if they'd noticed me but they were facing the opposite direction. I stared and wondered because by this point everything felt odd, but this could of course just be a Man and a Woman in the park at night, not implausible, maybe they wanted time alone.

"Hey" I called out to them, but they didn't answer. "Sorry to bother you, but-"

The Woman spoke to interrupt me - "Don't look at our faces!", in a hushed and brisk tone.

"Um..." I didn't really know what to say.

The Man then spoke - "you've been marked by the Kidnapper. In the strongest possible terms I advise you go home and look in the mirror until the numbers are up. And turn on your TV, leave it on".

"The Clown... told me... He threatened me not to" I replied.

"And you trust him?" replied the Woman.

"Well..."

Right then, the Man and Woman, huddling together and still facing away from me, walked off. They walked up the path and took a left, walking - yet somehow faster than seemed normal. They vanished from sight. "Hey, wait!" I cried, walking up the path. But when I looked round the corner, they were gone.

Something in my gut told me to trust these people, at least more so than 'Thweep'. But did I have the guts to disobey the mad Clown? At this point I was more scared than I had ever considered possible. My heart was beating out of my chest and I was perspiring. I decided to risk it, I went back to my apartment. I walked up to my front door, put the key in the lock shaking and struggling to unlock it. I walked into the warmth of my Apartment and took a deep breath. However, I wasn't sure if I wanted to look in the mirror, so I got some water from the kitchen area and sat on my sofa, my mind turning. What did all this mean? Why was it happening to me, in particular? I suddenly heard a voice, echoing in my head. It was Thweep. And he said:

"Kidnapper? Surely if I had wanted to kidnap you, I could have done that already?". I slapped myself in the face. He continued: "Those two, you trust them more so than you trust me?

I'll have you know they're two of the worst people in the entire World... Won't you tarry and listen to me a while, Jake?... my good friend?".

What exactly was he getting at? And in response to my thoughts, Thweep chimed in: "It is they, those two. They are the ones seeking to misguide you. I just wanted to keep you safe - from them". I knew he was referring to the Man and Woman I met at the parkway.

So I was caught in a dilemma. Thweep clearly did not want me to look in the mirror. The couple at the parkway had strongly advised I did so. I tried to do some extremely quick calculations, but all I was really left with were my emotions and the feeling in my gut. Thweep continued to speak to me.

"Now you wouldn't want to insult me, would you Jake? Don't go looking in the mirror".

I blinked several times. Thweep's dizzy voice had a quality of light-heartedness to it, but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something awfully predatory lurking under there. I also felt that Thweep could sense my mistrust, and was calculating. So I made a quick move.

I sprinted over to the TV and turned it on. On the screen was the Man I had seen before, the withered looking one. Only this time his words were different. "John is NOT a serial killer. Jane is NOT a cannibal. John is NOT a serial killer. Jane is NOT a cannibal". He seemed urgent and to be hasting me to act, his face flickering in and out of view. Although he kept repeating himself, his voice also seemed to reappear on top of the repeated phrase, and this time he was shouting, with the strongest and most compelling tone I had ever heard - "GET OVER TO THE FUCKING MIRROR!". At the same time, Thweep's voice reverberated in my mind - "DON'T YOU DARE!

Fuck it, I said to myself. I was throwing in with the Man and the Woman and the Guy on the TV. There was something utterly disturbing and troubling about Thweep, even if these other three entities were weird. I raced towards the mirror, which this time showed a red painted '7'. I blinked, 6, again, 5, again, 4,3,2,1 and... Just like that, I could see my own reflection again. I didn't know what to make of that, but I felt like a weight had lifted on some instinctive level, like I had averted danger for now. I guess it's impossible to know how I knew this, but I believed I had made the right decision in who to listen to. The TV, it happens, had went off again all by itself.

It wasn't as soon as I had taken another deep breath when I heard a knock on the door. Fuck. At first, I was terrified Thweep had come again. But something told me that was wrong... So with a shaky hand, I answered the door. It was the Man and the Woman I'd seen before. This time they were facing me, but they kept their faces covered by what appeared to be cloths. Could they even see me?

The Woman spoke. "You made the right choice, Jake", she said. But I took a step back. I said "Who are you? How do you know my name? What the fuck was that Clown and what the fuck is all this?"

"Very polite way to greet the two people who just saved your life" said the Woman.

My eyes widened at that. "Listen, for all I know you've come here to kill me yourselves. I have no idea what's going on".

The two just stared at me, and I stared back. After a short time, I loosened my posture. I was scared, but I swallowed my pride. I decided to trust them and said "Alright. Please come in".

They came into my apartment. I asked them to sit on the sofa, and I sat on the chair, which I moved around to be facing them both. I had a painting on my wall that I had crafted myself some time ago, of four blurry humanoid faces. It seemed weirdly congruent. It was time to ask these people who they were, and what business they were about.

"So I guess you're called John, and you're called Jane?" I said, nodding to each of them in succession. They nodded back at me. I looked around the room. I sort of leaned in, and I noticed they were looking at each other.

John turned his head and spoke. "You just averted an unthinkable fate. The entity you were just in contact with is not called 'Thweep', and it's not a Clown either. It is known as The Handicroft, and it is also known as the Kidnapper from the Darkness. There's something we should commend you on - you listened. Many others did not. The Man on your Television, Morgan, was the Kidnapper's last victim. And he just freed himself from his new master. He did a brave and noble thing for you, a true favour". He paused for a moment, then added "we like to keep a watchful eye on this World..."

I just kind of stared at them, blankly. Jane spoke then, and she continued to elaborate for me. "Morgan was tricked in the same way as you. He saw the Kidnapper in the same way you did over in his City. We tried to help, but the Kidnapper convinced him that John was a murderer who was going to feed Morgan to me, whom it convinced was a cannibal. It should be noted that the Kidnapper was much, much hungrier when it preyed on Morgan. It was a stroke of luck that you didn't get to feel its full potential. That countdown, by the way, was simply a trick to keep you afraid of disobeying".

I tried to take this information in, as much as I could. I wondered what to say for a while, but nothing seemed to come to mind. So I just tried my best to keep the conversation flowing. "So... this Morgan Guy... He was warning me too? What was with the repetition? How did he appear on my TV?"

John replied. "With our help. He was in a different realm, but with the right channelling we ensured he could appear through electronics. As for the repetition, it's basically just difficult to communicate in this fashion. At first he was just desperately trying to explain to you why he listened to the Kidnapper, because he thought you had escaped already. Notice how he believed you knew our names already. Anyways, we communicated with him and explained how that was not the case. Then we travelled to this realm. You somehow knew to go to the parkway, correct? That was due to us... We have a certain power". He paused. "Forgive us for being brief and curt with you back there, but we require brevity in this World, we stand out without covering for our faces and it is inadvisable to stay in the open at any one place for too long..." as he said this he seemed to shudder, then continued.

"We live in a place far away from here. We've made it our sole mission to save whoever we can from the Kidnapper. It is not, necessarily, us being a paragon of empathy, we must be frank... The Kidnapper, the Handicroft, makes it a mission to torture those who are drawn close enough. Think of the end result as to be tortured for eternities within eternities".

I felt sick and was unable to digest all this information smoothly. I blurted out - "so this Morgan Guy who saved me, he was...?"

Jane replied "Although he initially bought into the Kidnapper's lies, he remembered something we had been able to tell him before he got taken away. The Kidnapper scares people into obeying it. Many do. They first show up in an autumnal twilight realm called 'Sycamore Falls'. A dark place, difficult for us to reach. Morgan should be thankful we even bothered contacting him there. But those who remain in that place, subservient... Well, they eventually are selected for another realm. Where they are greeted by endless, paradoxical pain".

"So Morgan's back on Earth?" I said.

"No, he's dead..." replied John. "We made a deal with him. Few could or even have the sanity to wish to escape Sycamore Falls, but Morgan convened with us and we struck a deal. Help us save the next one, and we would transport him back to Earth - which results in death. So he ceases to exist now entirely. The Kidnapper won't be able to make him suffer".

I sat back and contemplated all of this. Everything they were telling me could be completely made up, or I could have been spiked with some crazy new drug. Was I breaking down, mentally? There were endless possibilities, but something in my gut told me this was all real. It didn't follow logic, but I knew I wasn't dreaming.

"You've got to understand something. I don't believe in monsters. How can I even begin to interpret this situation?"

Jane said "You can either believe it or not, it's up to you. But you're not about to forget it, are you?". I went silent at that. It was a lot to take in, but she was right. I was never going to forget about what had happened to me. "By the way", continued Jane. "If you see any strange message about your apartment, you'd do best to just ignore it. The Kidnapper often likes to taunt those who get away from it". This unsettled me.

Finally, after some time sitting in silence, I said "what happens now?"

John said "It's time for us to leave. The Kidnapper may never try to reach you again, it has many other options and designs. But just remember. Disobey entirely, whether it appears as a Clown, or in some other form. Disobey entirely. No matter what it tells you to do". With that, John and Jane rose. I opened the door for them. Before they reached the doorway I felt compelled to say something. "Thank you...". They nodded, and then they left, and I watched them walk up the street in that oddly speedy way. They seemed to disappear into the darkness. Later that night though, I did notice that a keepsake had indeed been left for me. It was written in blood (whose?) on my bathroom mirror -

"Can't you see me? Aren't you smiling?"

I know how it all sounds, but there you have it. I would be thinking exactly the same thing if I was you, that I'm making this all up. But I just wrote this down to warn people, to help continue John and Jane's work. If you ever come across a Clown, or some weird creature who starts telling you what to do for no reason. DO. NOT. OBEY.
