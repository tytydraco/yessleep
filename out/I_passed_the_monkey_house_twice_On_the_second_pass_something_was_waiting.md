Have you ever wondered why animals stare at nothing for hours? Why do some zoos never open past sunset…Or why, sometimes, a child’s laughter echoes through an empty enclosure?

No? Then maybe you’ve never worked the night shift at Grizzly Falls Wildlife Park. But I have. And I wish I hadn’t.

It started out simple. I was broke. Dead broke. Bills were clawing at my heels like rabid dogs, and jobs in my tiny town were about as rare as summer sun. So, when I spotted a listing for an overnight security guard at the local zoo, I took it without blinking.

The idea didn’t seem half-bad—quiet paths, the moon overhead, and maybe the distant howl of a wolf if I was lucky. It even sounded... peaceful. That illusion lasted about as long as the interview.

A man named Mr. Halvorsen met me at the staff gate. He looked like sleep was just a rumor he’d heard about once. Gaunt eyes, jittery hands—he handed me a keycard and a packet of papers with a single sentence:

“Read the rules. Follow them exactly. Especially the ones about the enclosures.”

I should’ve walked. That should’ve been my cue to run fast and far. But desperation is a hell of a blindfold.

At home, I read through the packet. Most of it was boilerplate—lock the gates, make hourly rounds, radio in if anything seemed off. But then I flipped to the last page. It was printed in bold red type:

“NIGHT SHIFT PROTOCOLS — DO NOT IGNORE”

There were seven rules. Seven. Each more unhinged than the last.

1. Do not enter the reptile house after 2:17 a.m. The door will be unlocked, but you must not go inside.

2. If you hear whistling near the aviary between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m., do not investigate. Walk away. Do not turn around.

3. At 3:03 a.m. exactly, check the polar bear enclosure. If the water is frozen, leave it. If it’s thawed, press the red button near the window. Do not press it at any other time.

4. If you see a child near the penguin exhibit, do not speak to them. They are not lost. Keep walking.

5. Pass the monkey house twice. On the second pass, do not look inside.

6. If your name is whispered over the intercom, do not answer. Find the nearest break room. Wait exactly six minutes.

7. At 4:44 a.m., check the maintenance shed. If the light is on, turn it off. Lock the door from the outside. Do not open it again. For any reason.

I laughed when I first read the rules. Not out loud — just a dry, nervous chuckle in the back of my throat. The kind of laugh you force when you're trying not to admit you're unsettled.

It felt like a joke. A creepy initiation ritual. Or maybe just something the staff did to mess with the new guy.

I even texted my buddy, Matt — he'd worked at Grizzly Falls a few years back before quitting out of the blue. "You ever see this crazy list of night shift rules?" I wrote, attaching a picture.

He replied a minute later. No emoji. No punctuation. Just four words: “Don’t take that job.”

I kept the paper. Folded it. Slipped it into my back pocket that night as I stepped through the gates.

Because part of me knew…something was waiting.

And those rules? They weren’t suggestions.

They were warnings.

I’ll tell you what happened on my first night—when I passed the monkey house for the second time…

And it was already looking back at me.

However, My first night started quiet. The animals were still, their silhouettes barely visible in the pale glow of the path lights. A calm, eerie silence had settled over everything — the kind of quiet that makes your ears ring because there's just... nothing.

At 1:12 a.m., I passed by the aviary. That’s when I heard it — faint, almost like the air itself was carrying the sound.

Someone was whistling.

The melody was soft, slow, and strangely familiar. Like a lullaby you forgot you knew. My body went rigid. Every hair on my neck stood up like static had swept through me. Rule two flashed in my mind like a warning light:

If you hear whistling near the aviary between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m., do not investigate. Walk away. Do not turn around.

So I walked. One foot in front of the other. My heartbeat drumming against my ribs. Resisting the urge to glance back felt like pulling teeth with my mind.

The whistling stopped halfway down the next path. Just like that. Like whatever had been making the sound knew I wasn’t playing its game.

That was when I stopped laughing. That was when I started taking the rules seriously.

At 2:15, I found myself standing in front of the reptile house. Just for kicks, I checked the door. And of course — it was unlocked.

I didn’t open it. But I stared at the handle longer than I care to admit. Something about the air there… it felt thick. Tense. Like the building was holding its breath.

I backed away, and I swear — I felt the weight of something watching from behind the glass.

Then came 3:03 a.m.

The polar bear enclosure was quiet. But the water…It was wrong. It shimmered with tiny ripples, like something just beneath the surface was breathing. It wasn’t frozen.

I hesitated, then slammed the red button near the window. There was a mechanical groan. Pipes beneath the concrete groaned like a sleeping beast — and then, the water began to freeze.

Not gradually. Not naturally. The ice crept across the surface like veins, pulsing and twisting in unnatural patterns. It looked alive.

I didn’t wait to see what happened next.

By the time I circled back toward the monkey house for the second pass, it was just before 4:00 a.m. Rule five was crystal clear:

Do not look inside on your second pass.

The first time, they’d all been asleep. Little hammocks. Peaceful. Innocent.

This time, I kept my head down, eyes fixed on the path. But then —Tap. A soft thud against the glass.

Tap. Tap. Something was trying to get my attention. And God help me, it almost worked.

But I clenched my jaw and kept walking. Faster.

By then, every nerve in my body was on edge. Every instinct screamed the same thing:

These rules aren’t a joke. They’re survival instructions.

And breaking them?

That’s not a mistake you get to make twice.

I had no idea what the rest of the night had in store. But I knew this — something wanted me to slip. Just once.

All it would take… was one wrong step.

And the worst was yet to come.

At 4:44 a.m., I reached the maintenance shed. The light inside was on.

It shouldn’t have been.

That faint glow leaking out from beneath the door was wrong — not just out of place, but off. Like the light itself didn’t want to be seen.

Still, I had a job to do.

I opened the door slowly. The shed was empty. Completely still. But the heat… it rolled out like breath from a furnace, thick and stifling. One bulb hung above, flickering faintly like it was straining to stay alive.

I reached up, switched it off, and stepped back. Then I locked the door. From the outside. Just like the rule said. 

That’s when I saw her.

Far across the park, near the penguin exhibit…A child stood by the glass.

My blood turned to ice.

She looked no older than six, wearing a red coat and no shoes. Her back was to me, head tilted upward at the enclosure like she was waiting for something.

I didn’t need to see her face. I already knew.

“If you see a child near the penguin exhibit, do not speak to them. They are not lost. Keep walking.”

I turned away, each step heavier than the last. My heart pounded like war drums. I didn’t look back.

And I didn’t sleep when I got home.

The second night was worse.

At 1:30 a.m., I passed the aviary again. But this time, it wasn’t just whistling.

No. When the tune ended… a voice whispered:

“Jacob.”

My name.

The sound slid into my ear like a cold finger. I ran — sprinted — to the nearest break room, slammed the door shut, and locked it behind me. Then I stared at the clock. Six minutes. That’s all I had to survive.

At minute three, something tapped on the door. Once. Twice. Three times.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. Even blinking felt like it might break the spell.

Then… silence.

Eventually, the clock struck six minutes, and I stepped back into the halls like a man returning from war.

At 3:03 a.m., I reached the polar bear enclosure. The water was already frozen solid.

So I left it alone. As instructed.

But near the monkey house… I slipped.

I looked.

I wish I could say it was the monkeys again. Sleeping. Familiar. Safe.

But what stood in their place…They weren’t monkeys.

They were things. Too many eyes. No faces. Bodies that swayed like meat on hooks. They moved in unison, pressed to the glass, and watched me. One of them opened its mouth — a gaping void that stretched all the way to its chest — and let out a noise that should not exist.

I ran.

I don’t remember how I got to the exit. I barely remember driving home.

The next morning, I found Mr. Halvorsen waiting at the gate.

I told him I was done. That I quit.

He didn’t argue.

He just looked at me with those hollow eyes and said:

“Then you shouldn’t have broken the rules.”

Some doors don’t close once they’ve been opened.

Especially the ones you weren’t supposed to touch in the first place.

That night, I didn’t go in.

I stayed home. I locked the doors. I drew the curtains. I kept every light on in the house like it would make a difference.

I told myself I’d quit. That it was over.

But at 3:03 a.m., my doorbell rang.

Just once.

I didn’t move. I didn’t answer. I sat frozen, hands trembling, breath caught in my chest.

In the morning, I opened the door. There was no package. No note. No sign of anyone.

Just claw marks. Deep, jagged streaks across the porch boards — like something had been waiting, pacing.

Or scratching to be let in.

I tried to leave town that afternoon. Packed a bag, grabbed my keys, bolted for the car.

It wouldn’t start.

Battery was fine. Gas tank full. But when I turned the key… nothing. Just dead silence.

And when I looked up in the rearview mirror — just for a second — I saw it.

A red coat. Tiny feet. Standing in the middle of my driveway.

But when I turned around, there was nothing there.

Now, every time I pass a mirror, I catch a flash of it — just behind me. Too quick to focus on. Too real to ignore.

Last night, I looked out the window. Miles away, across the valley, the zoo sat like a dark silhouette against the forest.

And the maintenance shed light was on.

From here. I could see it.

That impossible little glow in the distance — flickering like a signal.

Like a summons.

Something followed me. I can feel it.

The rules weren’t just for the zoo. They were for after. For the ones who leave… and aren’t supposed to.

Because the truth is, once you work the night shift at Grizzly Falls Wildlife Park — you don’t really leave.

And this morning? There was a note taped to my front door.

Typed. Same font as the others. Same blood-red ink.

It said:

8. You must return by the seventh night. Or we will come get you.

Tonight is night six.

And I think they’ve already started walking.
