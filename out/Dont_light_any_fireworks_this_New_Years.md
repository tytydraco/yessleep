If you're about to light one or planning to, stop. Keep them away, stay indoors, because even if you don't light one, it can still find you.

At first when I heard about the warning on my phone, I didn't really care about the warning. Maybe it's because they can be dangerous, and some people use them recklessly.

I planned on staring out my shitty apartment window and watch all the fireworks light up, since obviously people wouldn't listen. Some people wouldn't want to actually listen after all.

And sure enough, I saw fireworks launching up and promptly exploding into fabulous colors. I gazed in awe. Actually I didn't notice the buzzing from my phone at first, which I picked up and saw another warning message.

"WARNING! This is not a test, this is your warning. A being of unknown origin is nearby. We advise all citizens to stay inside, turn off all lights, lock everything, stay in a room that can be locked AND has no windows, and do not light any fireworks. May god help us all."

My hand was shaking. A being of unknown origin, an alien probably, this was just so unbelievable. My apartment had no blinds, but my bathroom was the safest place, so I ran there immediately, swiftly locking the door.

I pulled up my phone and immediately started messaging my family. I was going to come over later in the night to hangout. At this point I was praying to God they didn't light any fireworks.

No one even responded, just left on delivered after ten minutes. I honestly had no hope of them being alive at this point.

I spoke to myself in disbelief, "This can't be happening, no this can't this is a joke," I quietly sobbed, wrapping my arms around my legs in a corner.

Through my thin and crappy walls, I heard yells from outside, screams of pain and agony. Even when I covered my ears the noises remained the same volume.
 
Another issue rang out from my phone.

"DO NOT OPEN ANY DOORS. DO NOT LET ANYBODY IN. THAT'S NOT YOUR FRIEND. THAT'S NOT YOUR FAMILY."

I'm losing it, I couldn't really handle this stress as I hyperventilate.

I actually thought the message seemed more like it was letting me know that it was going to happen. Because I heard knocks almost immediately afterwards.

But it was close, it wasn't the front door. The knocks were coming from the bathroom door.

I struggled to breathe, my head kept seeming to spin. No speaking came from the door, just rapid pounding, and the screams from everyone seemed to just get louder.

Struggling to get up, I grabbed the container of pills left on my bathroom sink, and then I downed a singular pill. The pounding slowly faded as I presumed it left, and I fell asleep in my own bathroom.

When I woke up, there was no screams, and my phone buzzed immediately, it knew when I was going to wake up.

"If you are still alive, please immediately step outside and light some fireworks or make your presence known. Thank you."

I shook my head, that's bullshit. That must be the beings, it's the aliens. They want to find us, they want to find the remaining people left alive.

So to anyone still left, don't light any fireworks. I can"t trust these warnings, and don't even think that you can trust your friends.

My mom and dad keep messaging me but I know they died, the monster's got them, I already blocked them both.

I'm begging you, stay safe, don't light any fireworks.
