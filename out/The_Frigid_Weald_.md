          It was late in the season, and the winter chill had already started creeping in. My supplies were running low, and the woods had become a desperate place. I hadn’t eaten much in days, and every step felt like it could be my last if I didn’t find something soon. I was out hunting, trying to catch anything that could see me through the coming cold. That’s when I heard the faint, dragging sound like something heavy moving through the brush. At first, I thought it was a bear or something larger, but when I followed the noise, I saw it: a doe, limping badly, dragging her back leg like it was broken.

          I knew it was risky winter’s a time when animals get more unpredictable but I couldn’t afford to pass up a chance. The doe was hurt, and if I could track her down, she’d be my meal for at least a few days. I followed her cautiously, keeping just enough distance so she wouldn’t feel threatened. At first, her movements weren’t too bad. She was slow, yes, but I figured it was just exhaustion from the injury. As I moved closer, I noticed something off. The way she walked… it wasn’t quite right. Each step was stiff, and her head kept turning around to glance at me, but there was no fear in her eyes, just…  nothing.

          But I was too hungry to think much about it. I kept after her, my legs sore from the cold and lack of food, pushing myself to keep up. She led me deeper into the woods further than I had ever gone before. The trees grew denser here, and the air became heavier, like the woods themselves were trying to keep me in. I didn’t notice at first, but the sounds around me started to die down. No birds, no wind… just the sound of her dragging foot and the soft crunch of snow beneath my boots. I pushed forward. I had to. My mind was fixated on her. I could smell the blood, feel the hunger gnawing at my insides. Then I got closer. My heart skipped a beat. I could see her coat now matted, caked with something dark. But there was something else. I saw it under her fur, along her ribs and neck protrusions. They weren’t just the injury I thought they were. Something was growing through her skin, like vines, but twisted and dark. They pulsed beneath her fur, winding under the surface like they were alive, feeding off her.

          I stopped in my tracks. The world around me had gone still. That feeling in my gut like something was wrong, like I wasn’t supposed to be here was so heavy, I almost couldn’t breathe. But my stomach growled louder than my fear. I couldn’t afford to back down now. I took a step forward. She stared at me again, those dark eyes watching me like she was waiting. I took another step. And then, without warning, the doe dropped. Her leg buckled beneath her, and she collapsed to the ground with a sickening thud. It was like a puppet with its strings cut. Her body fell awkwardly, as if all the energy holding her up had suddenly vanished. For a moment, I just stood there, too stunned to move. She didn’t twitch. Didn’t try to get up. She just… laid there, her limbs twisted at odd angles, her fur matted with dark, almost blackened blood.

          That’s when I realized: the doe wasn’t injured anymore. It wasn’t real. It wasn’t a creature in distress it had simply been a puppet. The vines beneath its skin, pulsing with a strange energy, were the only thing keeping it moving. I heard a deep, groaning creak, like the sound of ancient wood stretching and bending. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. The world around me felt… wrong. The trees that had seemed distant before now felt close too close. Like they were pressing in on me, watching me. I pushed back, instinct kicking in. I needed to leave. But my feet didn’t move right. The ground beneath me was soft, spongy, and the air had thickened like it was hard to breathe. I couldn’t turn around something was holding me there. The vines under the doe’s skin seemed to shift, spreading like roots digging into the ground. I was no longer just tracking an injured animal. I was in the heart of something, something that was far more than just the woods.

          And then, I heard it. Not the doe’s sound anymore this was something else. Something human. At first, it was soft like a low moan, but then it rose into a scream. It was a cry, jagged and desperate, but it wasn’t like any scream I’d ever heard. It echoed around me, the sound warping like it was coming from all directions at once. It was like something someone was trapped, fighting to get out. I froze in terror. It didn’t take me long to understand what it was. The scream wasn’t coming from the doe. It was coming from something deeper. Something older. The air grew colder, and I realized the trees were no longer just trees. They had shifted, twisted in ways that made no sense bark peeling and splitting like they were some kind of grotesque skin, stretching out like limbs that wanted to wrap around me. The ground seemed to be alive beneath me, pulling, shifting, as if the very earth was aware of my presence. I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t move. The scream continued, a high-pitched wail that sent my skin crawling. It was both human and something else. Something unnatural.

          I looked back at the doe, now completely still, its eyes empty but open, like it was waiting for something… or someone. But I wasn’t just the observer anymore. The scream wasn’t just a warning. It was for me. I could feel the vines wrapping tighter around me now, pulling me closer to the twisted, gnarly trees that surrounded me. I couldn’t fight them. My body was frozen in place, as if the earth itself had me in its grip. My mind screamed, but my mouth wouldn’t open. The roots and vines dug deeper into my flesh, and I knew then this was it. I wasn’t going to be allowed to leave. I wasn’t going to die. Not here. Not now.

          The scream didn’t stop. It only grew louder. More frantic. Like it was feeding off my fear. And the last thing I could think as the world around me went black, was that I was going to become a part of it. A puppet. Just like the doe. And then it happened. The world around me shifted, softened. I didn’t feel the pressure of the roots pulling at me, or the cold of the air. I was somewhere warm. Surrounded by vibrant flowers, their petals glowing in the soft light of a sun I couldn’t see. The air was sweet, the sky endless. I was standing in the middle of a beautiful garden. The roots were still there, pulling deeper, but I no longer cared. The roots weren’t tearing me apart. They were part of me. This garden, this place it was where I was supposed to be. The panic that had once clawed at me was gone. I was no longer afraid. I was home. And then, the last thing I knew was nothing at all.
