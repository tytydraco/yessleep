They find what's left of me in the walls.

Not in the lake. Not in the forest. In the walls of 1847 Ashwood Drive, the Victorian house where Meredith invited six girls for her seventeenth birthday sleepover. The house her family moved into three months ago. The house that's been standing empty for twenty-three years.

By the time the demolition crew discovers me, I will have been screaming for exactly ninety-six hours.

That's a lie. I've been screaming for eight thousand, three hundred and ninety-five days.

But let me tell you what really happened.

# HOUR ONE: MIDNIGHT

The hardwood felt wrong the moment I stepped on it. Not cold—warm. Yielding slightly, like stepping on something recently alive.

"Your floors are weird," I said to Meredith.

She smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. "The realtor said it's reclaimed wood. Over a hundred years old."

We were seven girls who'd known each other since we were eight. Meredith Chen, whose perfectionism masked desperate control issues. Me, Cassie Reeves, abandoned by my father at sixteen. Petra Volkov, beautiful and venomous, in love with Meredith's brother Julian. Ines Rodriguez, our anxiety barometer. Sloane Khatri, skeptical scientist. And the twins: Astrid and Freya Lindholm, born holding hands, sharing bruises, finishing sentences. The kind of bond the rest of us envied and feared.

"So what's the game?" Petra asked, sprawled across her sleeping bag.

Meredith pulled out the book.

Later I'd learn that at this exact moment, in thirteen other cities, teenagers were pulling out identical books. We were all being invited to the same feast.

"It's called The Invitation," Meredith said. "My grandmother gave it to me before she died."

First lie. We didn't know it yet.

The book looked wrong-old. Like someone had made something ancient rather than something ancient existing. When Meredith opened it, the text seemed to shift.

"You invite something into your house. Something that grants wishes. You write down what you want most, burn the papers, and wait."

"Wait for what?" Sloane asked.

"For it to decide if you're worthy."

Petra laughed. "This is so stupid."

But she was already reaching for paper.

# HOUR TWO: 1:00 A.M.

We wrote in silence. The rules said we couldn't share them.

I stared at my blank paper before writing: *I wish my father would come back and tell me why I wasn't enough.*

Petra wrote hers with violent strokes. I saw: *I wish Meredith had never been born.*

Not "would die." Worse. Retroactive erasure.

Sloane: *I wish I could prove ghosts aren't real.*

Ines: *I wish I could stop being afraid.*

Astrid: *I wish Freya and I could be the same person.*

Freya: *I wish Astrid and I could be separate.*

The same wish, inverted.

Meredith wrote last: *I wish my family would stay in this house forever.*

We burned them in a copper bowl. The smoke rose impossibly straight, like a plumb line to hell.

"Now we wait for the knock," Meredith said.

At 1:47 a.m., it came.

Not from the door.

From inside Petra's chest.

# HOUR THREE: 2:00 A.M.

"Did you hear that?" Petra whispered.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

A hollow sound, like knuckles on wood, coming from inside her ribcage.

"That's impossible," Sloane said, pale. "That's anatomically—"

Petra clawed at her chest. "Get it OUT—"

Then silence. Worse than the knocking.

"It's in all of us now," Meredith said quietly. "We invited it in. Now it's measuring us. Deciding which wishes to grant and which wishers to take."

"What the fuck are you talking about?"

"It's a game. But the house always wins."

That's when we noticed the walls were breathing.

Literally. Expanding with each inhale. Contracting with each exhale. Wallpaper rippling like skin over muscle.

"We need to leave," Ines said. "Right now."

The front door was three steps away.

It took forty minutes to reach it.

Every time we walked toward it, the hallway stretched. The door receded. Ten steps forward, five steps back.

"Stop walking," Sloane commanded. "Everyone stop."

We stopped. The house stopped breathing.

In the silence: children laughing. Upstairs. Downstairs. Inside the walls.

"How many families lived here before yours?" I asked.

Meredith wouldn't meet my eyes. "Seven. Since 1847."

Seven families who vanished without explanation.

We were about to be the eighth.

# HOUR FOUR: 3:00 A.M.

"I need to use the bathroom," Freya announced, standing abruptly.

Astrid grabbed her wrist. "Then I'm coming."

But Freya pulled away. "No. I need to go alone."

Her gait was wrong. Too smooth. Like she was on rails.

"Freya!" Astrid lunged, but I held her back.

"That's not Freya anymore."

We found her in the upstairs bathroom. Door locked. When Sloane picked it, Freya stood motionless before the mirror.

"Look," she said, pointing.

In the reflection, Freya stood where we saw her. But her reflection was turned around, watching something behind her. Something we couldn't see in the real bathroom.

The reflection was looking at something standing right where we stood.

"It's looking at us," Ines whispered. "Through her."

The reflection smiled. Too wide. Too many teeth.

Freya's real face remained blank.

Then both spoke: "It knows what you wished for, Petra."

# HOUR FIVE: 4:00 A.M.

We dragged Freya from the mirror. Astrid held her twin's face, searching for recognition.

"Come back. Please."

Freya blinked. "I am back. I'm exactly where I've always been. But now I can see what the house sees."

She leaned close. "It's so beautiful here. We could finally be one person. Like you always wanted."

Astrid jerked backward. "I didn't mean—"

"You wanted to absorb me. You've always been jealous that I'm the pretty twin. The one Julian notices."

"That's not true!" But her face said otherwise.

The house knew every ugly thought. Every secret resentment.

And it was making them real.

Petra was already at the door, screaming, slamming a chair against the window. The chair bounced off, leaving no mark.

"LET US OUT! JULIAN!"

Silence from above.

"He can't hear you," Meredith said, perfectly calm. "He hasn't been able to hear anything for three weeks."

"What does that mean?"

"He found the book first. Made his wish. The house took him before we moved in."

The lights went out.

# HOUR SIX: 5:00 A.M.

In darkness, Petra's voice cut through: "This is your fault."

"Petra—"

"Shut up, Cassie. I'm talking to Meredith. You brought us here. You wanted this."

"I brought you here because we're friends—"

"You brought us here to feed us to your fucking house!"

Giggling interrupted them. Children's giggles from the basement.

"Come play with us. We've been waiting so long."

"How long have they been in there?" Sloane asked. "The other families."

"The Carvers went missing in 2002," Meredith said. "The Thorntons in 1979. The Bishops in 1954. Before that, records get unclear."

Math. Simple, horrible math.

One hundred seventy-eight years of families.

"They're all still here," I whispered. "Everyone who ever lived here."

The floor began to tilt.

# HOUR SEVEN: 6:00 A.M.

The house tipped like a sinking ship. We slid toward the basement door. I grabbed the banister. Ines clutched a bookshelf.

Freya simply let go.

"No!" Astrid screamed.

But Freya slid smoothly toward the basement, smiling, arms spread wide.

She disappeared into darkness.

From below, her voice—doubled now, speaking in harmony: "It doesn't hurt, Astrid. Once you stop fighting, it's beautiful. Come see. Come be one with me."

The floor leveled. We collapsed, gasping.

"We have to get her back," Astrid sobbed.

"She's gone," I said.

"She's right downstairs—"

"That's not your sister anymore. And if you go down there, you won't be Astrid either."

Astrid's face crumpled. She'd wished to be separate from Freya.

The house had granted it. Permanently.

# HOUR EIGHT: 7:00 A.M.

Dawn should have broken. Instead, darkness deepened. Thickened.

Petra cracked.

"I'm not dying in this fucking house!" She bolted for the stairs. "There's a window in the attic—"

"Petra, wait!"

But she was gone, taking stairs two at a time.

We heard her footsteps. Then her scream—not fear, but agony.

Then nothing.

We climbed the stairs using phone screens as weak flashlights.

Petra was on the landing.

Half of her.

Her lower body lay at the top. But her upper body had been absorbed into the wall. The plaster had grown around her torso like tree bark consuming a foreign object.

Worse: she was alive in there. Pressed against the inside, eyes open, mouth working silently. I could see her lips: *Help me. Please.*

Astrid vomited.

Sloane stepped closer. "The molecular structure shouldn't... this isn't..."

Meredith stared at what remained. "She wished I'd never been born. Wanted to erase me. So the house is erasing her instead. The wishes corrupt. Invert. Punish."

"What did you really wish for?"

Meredith finally looked at me. "I told you. I wished my family would stay together forever."

"Where are your parents?"

"In the walls. Where they've been for three months. The house gave me what I wanted. My family will never leave. We'll be together forever."

Sloane grabbed her shirt. "You KNEW. You fucking knew—"

"I thought I could control it! I thought if I brought people who loved me, the house would be satisfied. I thought I could trade you. Six friends for one family."

Footsteps above us. Heavy. Adult.

Julian stood at the attic stairs. Or something wearing Julian. His spine was twisted, torso facing backward, head rotated 180 degrees.

"Hello, Merry," he said in a voice like rustling paper. "Thanks for bringing friends. The house was getting hungry."

# HOUR NINE: 8:00 A.M.

Julian descended, each step a crack of breaking bones.

"The house showed me things. When I wished our parents would die so I could inherit everything, it showed me everyone who'd ever lived here. They all thought they were special. Smart enough to beat the rules."

He reached the landing, stepping over Petra's legs without looking.

"But the house always wins. It's not granting wishes—it's exposing them. Every dark thought. Every selfish desire."

"Stay back!" Astrid grabbed a picture frame.

Julian laughed. The sound came from everywhere—his mouth, the walls, the floor.

"You can't hurt what's already gone. I've been in the walls for three weeks. The house let me keep this body to help with the harvest."

"Harvest?" Sloane asked.

"Seven wishes. Seven souls. Seven offerings to keep the house fed for another twenty years." His twisted face smiled. "You're all such perfect offerings. So much pain. So much desire."

From the basement, Freya called: "Come down and play, Astrid. I need my other half."

From the walls, dozens of voices whispered: "Stay. Stay. Stay forever."

# HOUR TEN: 9:00 A.M.

Sloane made a decision.

"The book. Meredith, where's the book?"

"It disappeared."

"Bullshit. Occult objects don't disappear. Think."

Meredith closed her eyes. "My bedroom. The closet. False panel."

We ran. Julian followed, his backward body moving with horrible grace.

"You won't find anything useful. The house doesn't let its secrets go."

Sloane kicked the door open.

The closet panel popped. Inside: the book and a small journal.

"That's Mrs. Carver's diary," Meredith said. "She wrote how to stop it."

"And you didn't tell us?!"

"I couldn't! The house won't let you speak the words! Try it!"

Sloane read. Her lips moved. No sound.

"Then we read it. All of us."

We huddled around the journal. Mrs. Carver's handwriting deteriorated as entries progressed:

*Day 1: The ritual worked. The stocks tripled. We're rich.*

*Day 3: Children hear voices in walls.*

*Day 5: Thomas found his father in the basement. But his father died ten years ago.*

*Day 7: The wishes aren't gifts. They're bait.*

*Day 9: Children are in the walls. Thomas went to get them. Didn't come back.*

*Day 12: Only one way to break the cycle. The wisher must unwish. Must reject their deepest desire completely and mean it. The house knows if you're lying. It knows your heart better than you do.*

I looked up. "We have to unwish. Genuinely stop wanting."

"How?!"

Julian ripped the journal from my hands.

He ate it.

Page by page, cramming Mrs. Carver's message into his mouth. Ink stained his lips black.

"Nice try."

Downstairs: a crash. A scream.

Astrid.

# HOUR ELEVEN: 10:00 A.M.

We found Astrid at the basement door, prying it with a knife.

"Freya's down there. She needs me—"

"That's the house talking."

"She's NOT gone! I'd feel it!"

"What did you wish for?"

Astrid froze.

"You wished to be the same person. Freya wished the opposite. The house is giving you both what you wanted—by destroying what connected you."

Astrid's face crumpled. "I take it back. I want her separate. I want her alive—"

The basement door opened.

Freya stood there. Perfectly normal.

"Astrid. I've been waiting."

Astrid took a step forward.

"Don't," Sloane warned.

But Astrid reached for her twin's hand.

Freya grabbed it. "The house showed me I've always been in your shadow. The anxious twin. The needy twin. I hated it. I hated you for making me incomplete."

"I never meant—"

"I know. That's the worst part. You loved me so much you wanted to absorb me. And I resented you so much I wanted to be free. Now we both get what we wanted."

Freya pulled.

Astrid slid forward. Toward the basement. Toward darkness.

"No!" I grabbed her other arm. Ines grabbed her waist. Sloane wrapped around her torso.

But Freya was stronger.

Astrid looked back. "It's okay. I can feel her again. In my head. We're connecting. Like it used to be."

Her eyes started going black.

"I don't want to fight it," she whispered. "I've never wanted anything else."

She turned back to Freya. Together, walking backward, they descended.

The door closed softly.

And then there were four.

# HOUR TWELVE: 11:00 A.M.

Meredith, Sloane, Ines, and me.

"Unwish," Sloane said. "We have to unwish."

"How do you stop wanting something?"

"You don't," I said. "That's the point. We can't fundamentally change who we are."

"Then we're dead."

"No. There has to be a logical solution. Every system has exploits."

"This isn't a computer program—"

"It's exactly like one! Input, processing, output. We input wishes, the house processes them. So we change the input."

"How?"

Sloane pulled out paper and wrote: *We wish for nothing.*

Silence.

"That's not desire. That's the absence of desire."

"Exactly. What can the house do with emptiness?"

We placed our hands on the paper.

"I wish for nothing."

"I wish for nothing."

"I wish for nothing."

"I wish for nothing."

The paper didn't burn.

"It's not working."

"Because we're lying. We don't actually wish for nothing. We wish for survival."

"Then what do we do?"

"We give it what it really wants. Our desires. We sacrifice them voluntarily. Prove we're stronger than our wishes."

The walls began closing. Ten feet away. Eight. Six.

"Cassie!" Sloane grabbed my face. "Your father. You wished he'd tell you why you weren't enough. So you have to accept you'll never know. Stop caring."

"I can't—"

"You have to!"

Four feet away.

I closed my eyes. Thought about my father. About abandonment.

What if nothing I do will ever make him love me?

What if I'm not the problem?

What if I never was?

Something inside me released.

"I don't need his answer," I said. "I was enough. I am enough. His leaving wasn't about me."

A sigh echoed through the house.

The walls stopped. Three feet away.

"It's working!" Sloane turned to Ines. "Your fear. You have to accept it. Embrace it."

"How?!"

"Fear kept our ancestors alive! It's not weakness—it's a tool! Say it!"

Ines hyperventilated. "I'm afraid. I've always been afraid. And that's okay. Fear doesn't make me weak. Fear makes me careful. Fear keeps me alive."

Another sigh. Walls retreated six inches.

"Meredith! Your family! You have to let them go!"

Tears streamed. "I can't. They're all I have."

"They're already gone! Holding on is killing us!"

"If I let them go, I'll be alone!"

"You're alone now! But you could be alone and free, or alone and trapped. Choose!"

Meredith's face contorted. "I release them. My parents. Julian. I release my wish. They can be at peace."

The house shuddered. Walls retreated.

"Sloane," I said. "What did you wish for?"

She'd forgotten. "I wished to prove ghosts weren't real."

"And?"

She looked around at the breathing walls, the voices, the impossible horrors. "They're real. I was wrong. My worldview was incomplete. I wish I'd been right, but I wasn't. And that's okay."

The walls stopped. Began retreating.

"It's working!"

But the house wasn't done.

My father stepped out of the wall.

Not a ghost. Him. Exactly as I remembered.

"Cassie," he said. "I came back to explain."

I knew it wasn't real.

But god, I wanted to listen.

"You weren't enough. Your new sister—she's smarter. Prettier. Better. You were a disappointment from the start."

Every fear, spoken in my father's voice.

My knees buckled.

"Don't listen! It's lying!"

"Is it? Or is this the truth you've been afraid to hear?"

I stared at it.

And then: "You're right."

Silence.

"You're right. No version of me would've been good enough. Because you didn't leave because of who I was. You left because of who you are. A man who abandons his daughter will always find a reason. So yes—I was never going to be enough for you. But I'm enough for me."

The father-thing's face twisted with rage. Then melted back into the wall, screaming.

The house shuddered violently. Cracks appeared in the ceiling.

"It's destabilizing! When we reject our wishes, we're starving it!"

But Ines stared at the basement door. "If we all rejected our wishes... what about Petra? Astrid? Freya? They're still feeding it."

From the basement, Freya's voice: "You can't kill the house. The house is desire itself. As long as humans want things, the house will feed."

"Then we get them out."

"That's suicide."

"Maybe. But we're not leaving them."

# HOUR THIRTEEN: 12:00 P.M.

We sat in a circle. Closed our eyes. Controlled breathing.

I imagined myself as nothing. Not a person. Just empty space. No father. No past. No future. No fear. No hope.

Just void.

When I opened my eyes, the world looked flatter.

"I can't feel anything," Ines whispered, surprised.

"Stay empty. Don't let the house find purchase."

We walked to the basement door. Single file, we descended.

The basement was cathedral-large. Walls pulsed with trapped bodies—hundreds, thousands, pressed like insects in amber.

In the center stood Petra, Astrid, and Freya.

Fused. Not three girls anymore, but one entity with three faces, six arms, three torsos merged into a trunk that disappeared into the floor.

"You came," they said in unison. "We knew you would."

"We're taking you back."

"There is no back. Only forward. Into the walls. Into forever."

I walked toward them.

"Cassie. Still trying to save everyone. Still trying to be enough."

"I'm not trying to save you. I'm giving you a choice. Come with us, or stay. But choose."

"The house doesn't let you choose."

"The house feeds on desire. But what if you desire nothing? What if you choose emptiness?"

Uncertainty flickered across their faces.

"We're part of it now. We can't separate."

"Yes you can. You're choosing to stay because some part wants to. Petra—you wanted Meredith erased. Here, she never existed. Astrid, Freya—you're finally one person. But is it enough? Will it ever be?"

Astrid's face began crying. "I miss being separate. I miss fighting with her. I miss having my own thoughts."

"Then let go."

"I don't know how!"

"Yes you do. You just have to want it more than the house does."

The basement shook. Walls screamed—centuries of voices screaming in rage.

"THEY ARE OURS," the house boomed. "THEY WISHED. THEY BURNED. THEY WERE INVITED."

"And now we're uninviting them," Sloane said. "All of them. Every person you've taken. We reject the contract. We void the wishes—"

The floor opened beneath her.

She fell. I lunged, caught her hand.

"Let me go," Sloane said calmly. "It's okay."

"No—"

"I wished to prove ghosts weren't real. Now I can prove the opposite. I can document this from inside. I can finally understand."

"Don't you dare—"

"I'm not giving up. I'm choosing. There's a difference."

She let go.

I watched her fall into darkness, face serene.

The hole closed.

"Three offerings," the entity said. "The house is satisfied. It will let the rest of you go."

"No. All of us or none of us."

"That's not how this works."

"Then we change how it works." I turned to Meredith and Ines. "Your wishes. Say them out loud. Every dark thought. Confess everything."

"Why?"

"Because secrets have power. Once spoken, they're just words."

Meredith went first. "I wished my family would stay forever because I was terrified of being abandoned. Because my father cheated and my mother drank and Julian resented me. I thought if I could control where we lived, I could control whether they left. I wished for a prison and called it love."

The house shuddered.

Ines: "I wished to stop being afraid because I'm exhausted. Because fear has controlled my entire life. Because I want to be brave just once, even if it kills me."

Another shudder. Cracks spreading.

"I wished my father would come back," I said, "because I've spent six months thinking I wasn't enough. Because I needed him to say I mattered. Because I'm seventeen and I still need my daddy to tell me I'm okay."

Cracks widened. Light—real sunlight—leaked through.

"Petra wished I would die," Meredith continued, "because she loved Julian and I existed."

Petra's face began separating from the entity.

"Astrid wished to absorb me," Freya's face said, "and I wished to escape her. Because we loved each other and resented each other and didn't know where one ended and the other began."

The entity split. Three girls collapsed—separate, gasping, alive.

"Sloane wished to prove ghosts weren't real," I said to the house, "because she was terrified of anything she couldn't explain. And you took her for it."

"SHE GAVE HERSELF."

"She sacrificed herself because we taught her that's what heroes do. But we were wrong. You don't have to die to prove you're good."

I walked to where Sloane fell. Placed my palm against the wall.

"Give her back."

"NO."

"Give her back, or I stay. Willingly. A soul that chooses the house is worth more than one taken, isn't it? That's why you wanted the ritual. You need permission. You need invitation."

Silence.

"I'll stay. Forever. I'll feed you my consciousness, my desires, my entire being. But only if you release everyone you've ever taken."

"CASSIE, DON'T—"

"One for all. That's the deal."

The house considered. Weighing options. Calculating value.

Then the walls burst open.

They came pouring out. Hundreds. Thousands. Decades of victims, suddenly released. They stumbled through ruptures in plaster, fell from the ceiling, rose from the floor.

The Carvers. The Thorntons. The Bishops. Further back, families in Victorian dress, Colonial clothing, garments I couldn't identify.

And Sloane, gasping, collapsing into my arms.

"You idiot," she wheezed.

"Did you really think I'd let you document ghosts alone?"

But I could feel the house pulling at me. My offer still stood. A willing soul for all the unwilling ones.

"Cassie," Meredith grabbed my hand. "We can run. While it's weak."

"It'll just take someone else. Another family. Another group of teenagers."

"So what do we do?"

I pulled out my phone. Still dead. But the voice recorder had been running since we entered. Everything we'd said. Every confession. Every truth.

"Sloane. Your wish was to prove ghosts exist. Document this."

She understood. "We expose it. Tell everyone. Make the house famous."

"It feeds on secrets," Ines added. "On hidden desires. On private shame. So we make it public."

"It can't survive scrutiny," Meredith finished.

The house roared. Remaining walls buckled.

"IT WILL FIND NEW VESSELS. NEW HOMES. NEW CITIES."

"Then we expose those too. Every single one. We find every house that's ever used the ritual. We publish the addresses. We warn everyone. We make it impossible for you to hide."

"YOU CANNOT STOP DESIRE."

"No. But we can stop the exploitation of it. We can teach people that wanting things doesn't make them weak. That wishing for happiness doesn't mean you deserve to suffer."

The house was collapsing. Really collapsing. Support beams snapping. Foundation crumbling.

"RUN!"

We ran. All of us—the seven girls, the freed victims, centuries of suffering pouring out of 1847 Ashwood Drive.

We made it to the lawn as the house folded in on itself. Not burning. Not exploding. Just deflating.

In ninety seconds, the Victorian mansion was rubble.

They find what's left of me in the walls.

That's what the news reports say. "Local girl recovered from demolished house after twenty-three years."

But that's not what happened.

We spent three days excavating. We found Meredith's parents, perfectly preserved, still alive. We found Julian. We found dozens of other victims from other years, other decades.

The medical community couldn't explain it. The victims hadn't aged. Hadn't decomposed.

"Suspended animation," the doctors claimed. "Some kind of preservative in the building materials."

They were wrong. But we let them believe it.

Sloane, Meredith, Ines, and I formed a foundation. The Ashwood Foundation. Its mission: to find and document every building that used the ritual.

We found forty-seven in the first year.

By year five: two hundred and eighteen.

They're everywhere. Victorian homes, modern apartments, office buildings, schools. Any structure built with the right intentions, the right sacrifices, the right hunger.

The books are still out there. Leather-bound. Old-seeming. Waiting to be found by desperate people who think they're special enough to control what they summon.

But now we're ahead of them. We monitor real estate. We investigate disappearances. We've created an algorithm that identifies properties with the right pattern—long vacancies, repeated ownership turnovers, suspicious price fluctuations.

And we warn people.

Some listen. Most don't.

Because here's the thing about desire: people will always want things. They'll always believe they're the exception. They'll always think they're smart enough to beat the rules.

And the houses will always be waiting.

Petra recovered. She spent six months in physical therapy after being half-absorbed. She never talks about what it felt like. When asked, she just says: "Like drowning in concrete. Forever."

Astrid and Freya separated after we got out. They needed space. Last I heard, Astrid was in Oregon and Freya in Maine. They don't talk. But on their birthday, they both light a candle at the exact same time. Neither knows the other does it.

Sloane got her proof. Hours of audio from that night. But she doesn't publish it. Not yet. Because proof won't stop the houses. It'll just make people more curious.

Ines confronted her fear. She's a firefighter now. Runs into burning buildings while others run out. She says the fear never went away, but at least now she's controlling it.

Meredith never forgave herself. Her family survived, but they're not the same. Her parents don't remember the three months. Julian does. He won't speak to her. Last I heard, he was living in Alaska, as far from Victorian houses as possible.

And me? I found my father. The real one. Living in Colorado with his new family. I drove out there six months after Ashwood. Knocked on his door. Stood there when he answered, his new daughter peeking behind his legs.

"Cassie?" Shocked.

"I came to tell you something. You don't get to explain. You don't get to apologize. You don't get closure. You left, and that's the end. I'm not here for you. I'm here for me. To prove I can look at you and feel nothing."

I waited. Felt my heartbeat. Steady. Calm.

"And I do. I feel nothing. You're just a man who made a choice. And I'm just a person who survived it."

I walked away. He called after me. I didn't turn around.

That's the thing about surviving the house: it teaches you that wanting things gives them power over you. The less you need, the freer you are.

The book sits in a climate-controlled vault three stories underground. We've had it analyzed by everyone. They all conclude: it shouldn't exist.

The leather is human skin. The ink is human blood. The pages predate paper. The text shifts depending on who reads it.

And it's not unique. We've collected seventeen identical copies. Every time we destroy one, another appears somewhere else.

The ritual spreads like a virus. Self-replicating. Self-preserving.

Some nights I dream I'm back in the walls. Pressed against plaster. Conscious. Screaming. Watching as the cycle continues forever.

Then I wake up. Check my phone. Messages from Sloane (found three new houses), from Ines (rescued a family in Detroit), from Meredith (demolished another in Portland).

We're winning. Slowly.

The houses feed on desire. On the human need to want more.

But we feed on something stronger: the desire to save others from our mistakes.

And that's the one wish the houses can't corrupt.

Because it's not about us.

It's about everyone who comes after.

**If you've found a leather-bound book that promises to grant wishes, burn it.**

**If you've moved into a house that's been vacant for years, research its history.**

**If you hear children laughing in the walls, get out immediately.**

**And if someone invites you to perform a ritual, ask yourself: what am I really wishing for?**

**Is it worth the price?**

**Because the houses always collect.**

**Always.**
