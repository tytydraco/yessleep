I run The Drowsy Spectre, a café meant to serve what new guy calls the ‘odd and supernatural.’ Humans come in sometimes and, as you know, we also employ two of them. Two humans, one forest sprite, and one that has seen the great beyond. And me, of course. I can’t say I appreciate any of these stories, but if you do, then click [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/z473tt/i_am_a_barista_that_serves_the_supernatural_find/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

\--------------------------------------

If you hadn’t caught on, this is Selene (yes, actually Selene). New guy (I'm going to call him Hero from now on) told you I had his laptop because *someone* doesn’t know the meaning of *secrecy*. Like, was he there for all the vagueness in Richard’s job offer for this place? We picked him because he was quiet! He’s lucky that things have grown monotonous for me lately, otherwise I’d be tempted to take the entire thing down. He *has* broken up routine since starting. Flitting about like a tiny bird, buddying up to everyone (including our most *dangerous* customer).

I saw the update he made about leaving for the woods. I was supposed to write if he didn’t make it back, to tell you all about his last stand. To give one last goodbye. He did make it back, though, but he isn’t in a good way. Seeing as he’s made a few friends on here, he kept trying to find strength to write about what happened. I need him better, though, so it is my turn to write about The Drowsy Spectre.

I’m not allowed to read a specific update, that was part of our deal when he gave me the laptop. I am not a human, not in the traditional sense, so I am bound to my word. That update lines up with our day at the Headsman’s and I am curious if he knows how we all got back here. But, alas, I am honorbound. Obviously the pixie is not available to work her shift, and Hero took the other two with him. I could have called in someone to cover, but Richard is not in on the plan to save the pixie. The shop is closed, remember? Still is.

I’m getting ahead of myself. When the store is closed, we still need it to do what The Drowsy Spectre is meant to. That is still a secret from even Hero, it seems. When Richard closes the store for a few days, he asks me to turn on the… thing. I’m calling it the thing because you don’t need to know its name. Shouldn’t know its name, rather.

We took the necklace to the thing. The thing is a white box that glows softly, covered in black markings deeper than midnight. I said some magic words (I’m not Hero, I keep secret things hidden, like they are meant to be). The light dimmed and I opened the box. Inside was a gem that, when held, would cause the necklace and the gem to glow. That’s all you need to know and, honestly, I’ve probably said too much. It did the trick, though. The necklace would have protection much longer than before. However, that came at a cost.

The shop had *no* protection. None at all. When we turned off the thing, we were effectively open for business. Except it was just me, at night, alone at the shop with no protection. If Tall Ben was able to enter buildings, he could have walked right in. Usually the most dangerous of things (or troublesome) can’t come inside. That was different for one night and they would be coming to torment me. Thanks Hero (and the pixie for getting photographed).

Could I have left? Yeah, sure, but then what would be left of the shop when it opened later? Also, do you know what the box I have is worth? Someone would be coming for it. No, it was upon me to protect what we had. To protect The Drowsy Spectre.

I didn’t have the rules memorized, so it was going to be a tough night. But, as is obvious, I am alive so I guess I did something right. When it comes to orders, I can handle most of what comes through here, but not all at once. This isn’t a little drink cart and the espresso can only pull so fast. Not to mention running back to the kitchen… I don’t think any of you understand the sheer volume of strange things we offer back there. He won’t be put in the kitchen if I can help it, not even at this place. Though it was funny the one night towards the beginning where he accidentally put crushed bone paste on his sandwich instead of mayo. We need someone back there that pays attention.

Anyway, the night it all went down. Everyone gathered at the normal time to open the shop. I brought Pixie with me and kept her in the back (we have a little cot set up for her, all snug in my office). With their new boosted jewelry, the trio went off to save the pixie and get themselves killed. But I couldn’t worry about them (much) I had a shop to run (and survive in).

With Pixie tucked away and safe in the back I opened the shop on time and started prepping as much as I could. I knew the regulars and their orders so some of those could be made ahead of time. Unfortunately, when some of our more problematic customers caught on to the fact that I was alone, they let the word out. They all knew, they all wanted to see if they could get a piece of me, or a piece of the shop.

Two hours in was when I made my first mistake. A customer in the drive thru was taking *forever* staring at the menu. (seriously, coffee is coffee, it isn’t that complicated) and I didn’t notice a group of gnomes slip in. Since there was no one inside (and I hadn’t seen the gnomes) I ran into the kitchen to grab the drive thru a muffin and by the time I got back up front they had erected a barricade in front of the door and there was a small group forming and trying to get in. Gnomes have a habit of protecting their favorite places and things. I was thankful, so long as the crowd wanted in. If they lost interest, then I would have to deal with the gnomes. They can be… savage in ways that are more irritating than harmful.

I was trying to go quickly; multitasking, taking orders while steaming milk waiting for shots to finish pulling or beans to grind, but some types have little capacity for patience. A shorter customer I’d never seen before made it to the front of the line, looked like a little old lady, someone’s grandma that knits them a jumper for holidays, and ordered seven shots with a pump of lavender (gross). Seven shots would take a while to pull since I was also making stuff for drive thru.

“I’d like to speak to a manager please.”

She was talking to me. I was taking too long. Of course, I am the manager. I was the *only* person there! When I looked at her to reply, I noticed she was completely still. Like, not even breathing. Frozen, as if time had stopped for her. Again, the voice came.

“Where is your supervisor?”

Then her eyes tracked me. I didn’t respond since I was not sure what she was, nor what rules regarding her might be broken by opening my mouth. Apparently silence was not the right choice, because her claws came out. Literally.

A large gash in my right arm was the payment for my tardiness. That seemed to satisfy the thing, she left with her hands by her side, her legs unmoving outside my view. She moved through the gnomes as if they were water, then through the door as well. Weird. The wound made me slower, however. I heal pretty quick, but I was too stressed to focus on repairing myself. Someone spilled in the lobby, another threw their drink when they realized that the gnomes were keeping them inside (their barrier had yet to be broken). The lights to the office turned off (I kept the door open) and I had to run to turn them back on. Two customers got into a fight, blaming each other for the gnomes that kept them inside. A third shoved the door open with tremendous strength, throwing the gnomes across the store.

The newcomer walked up, shoved a hand into each of the two fighter’s chests, and took their hearts togo. Saves me a trip to the kitchen (yeah, we sell hearts) but we lost two customers. That meant there were two dead bodies I couldn’t clean up. Pests were starting to appear from under the tables, under the fridges, under the *tiles*. What a night. I hate it.

But all these could not harm me, they only made the night so much harder. There were things from the depths of the woods and beyond that could damage me, if they wanted to. That is what the store’s protection is for. The protection that was gone. A customer came in. I was making drinks, food, trying to juggle the front counter and drive thru, and didn’t get a good look at their face.

I began my greeting wrong. “Hello sir, what can I start for you?”

She was not a sir, I had offended the creature. That is when I looked up. A crooked nose, eyes like emeralds, and hair that seemed to move of its own accord. I believe your world calls it a gorgon. That was not hair, it was snakes. Snakes piled high on her head, coiled around one another. I needed a camera, so I went to grab my phone. The gorgon reached across the counter and snatched my wrist, not willing to give me an advantage. I would be weak to the power of her snakes’ gaze. I am a strong person, far stronger than any human, but I could not break free of that grip. When I tried, she just came with me. I turned my face away and dragged her behind the counter. She screamed and kicked, her hair hissed and snapped at my wrist. I felt the pain, I knew I was poisoned, but I pulled her towards the window.

Then she cried out in desperation. “Selene, it's okay.” A voice said, one that I hadn’t heard in forever. “Come away, for you have no master now.”

It was a trick. I knew it was a trick, even in the moment, but I still turned. The gaze of the gorgon had me trapped, frozen like stone. Not even my breath could escape and any human would have been reduced to stone, but I could fight. My body grew hot and the hairs on my arms sizzled as I demanded my faculties back. The gaze was stuck inside my mind, however, and soon I would be a sculpture. The gorgon didn’t let go.

There was only one way I was getting out of her grip, only one way I was banishing the gaze of the gorgon from my mind. I needed to make a deal.

I threw open the drive thru window. “Amber!” The seal on the back door was broken, she could come inside. “I’ll buy a candle!” My willpower only bought me those seconds, then my bones went rigid once more. It started at the tip of my toes, locking my feet in place, then up my thighs and belly.

The back door opened and Amber came rushing in. She had a candle in her hand and, to my surprise, looked extremely worried. “What is this?!”

“If I die, the shop is gone!” Even in my panic, I made the threat. “Where will you sell your candles then?”

“Look here.” It tried. I grabbed its right wrist and dug my fingers into its flesh. In doing so, I was turned towards it. My eyes betrayed me and I was once more looking upon the gorgon. My fate was already sealed before, but it was expedited by that stare.

I snapped my fingers, they burned with red flame. “I’ll make a deal with you.”

“You still have it in you, Selene?”

“I do.” It was in my chest, creeping up my lungs. I wouldn’t be able to talk soon. “Remove the gorgon from my mind. Wish them away, and you can sell candles inside.” Oh, Richard would kill me. She didn’t take my hand. “Please, I-” No more words. One last breath, then my lungs were frozen. My shoulders, my neck. I mouthed ‘please’ once more before it took my jaw.

She stared at me, then at my hand. I was almost done and, once it froze my body, I would become stone. My nose, my eyes, then my whole head. It worked down my elbows, but had not reached my hands yet.

I really thought I was going to die, right there. I never expected to be killed by a customer, not after everything my extremely long life has put me through. I think I was afraid, which I can’t recall feeling before.

The gnomes ran around without restraint, biting any customer that dared enter the store. Screaming, crying, shouting; that chaos would have been my last experience.

Then I felt a soft hand take mine, extinguishing the fire on my fingers. “Deal.” Amber said, but in a voice not her own. The gorgon vanished in an instant, as did the rigidness of my bones. “You need but ask.”

That voice, I knew it. I knew it well, most of my life was spent trying to forget it. I looked at Amber, but she was the same. No, not the same. Her eyes were different. Gold, splashed with red. None of you know what that means and you don’t need to, but I did. I knew. I still know and it haunts me.

“See you around, Selene.” Then her own eyes returned.

She smiled. “Seems you’ve a candle of your own, no need to buy mine.”

I did. In my hand was a fat candle of red and gold wax, glitters of crimson and ocre sprinkled through. It had a flame upon it that wouldn’t go out, no matter how hard anyone tried. I didn’t attempt, I already knew. A deal was struck. Amber would have a candle stand inside and I would live.

Pain exploded in my chest. Arms, legs; everything hurt. I fell to my knees and threw up.

Amber watched and sighed. “Can’t have you dying, then our deal wouldn’t mean anything.” She grabbed a shot glass from the counter and scooped up a bit of blood on the floor. “Drink up. Nothing about our deal said to cure the poison.

An ancient god had stared at me through her eyes. If I died, she’d have to leave. Was that worth it? No, I decided, and drank the thick blood. She nodded, satisfied, and said nothing more. She exited through the back door. My day was not done yet, however, and I stood to see the destruction that my customers were causing.

Amber came back inside, though. She placed a red candle in the center of the room, then lit it with a match. A horrible smell was followed by screams. I felt it too, upon my cheek. A burning sensation that would have any other creature upon their knees in pain. Even I ducked away from the brilliant light that the candle provided.

Sizzling. Awful sizzling. Then Amber put the candle out. “Get out, everyone.” I stood and didn’t see anyone obeying. She lit another match, slowly moving it closer to the candle. Even the creatures that could not understand her tongue leapt for the door. The gnomes abandoned any hope of claiming The Drowsy Spectre, and in seconds the store was empty.

Amber turned to me and smiled. “How am I going to get set up with this mess?” She laughed, as if we were close friends, and started cleaning up. “It doesn’t look good for my business.”

The rest of the night was simple. All business was limited to drive thru and I could handle that easily. If I made a customer mad, I could just close the window. Simple. The sun rose, Amber left with her candles. I closed the store and still hadn’t seen the trio of heroes return. Then, just when I was going to retrieve the pixie, I saw them exit the woods.

Only, they weren’t all the same. Hook was there. Hero limped along with a stick for support. Kitchen boy wasn’t, though.

His brother was.

But it was Hero’s doing, his plan, and his quest to save Em. That is for him to write, but I figured this would keep you entertained until he is well enough. If you want some advice, though, don’t serve gorgons or gnomes at your establishment. They are more trouble than they are worth.
