I keep convincing myself nothing's wrong, but everything feels wrong. My best friend, Isabel, went missing around three months, while hiking on a forest trail. We thought she was gone for good. But after being missing for a full week, she was found, completely unharmed. Everything was fine after then. Sort of.

Nobody noticed it, but Isabel had been acting somewhat off. I think I may be overthinking this. But I can't shake it off. Like how she was missing for a full week yet had no problems with anything. Not a single scratch, cut or bruise on her. No signs of dehydration or hunger on her. All of these felt really odd to me. It didn't make any sense. Even the hospital staff were baffled for a moment because it was physically impossible. Considering her supplies, it would barely last her a day. And the forest was a dangerous area too. Filled with all sorts of animals, steep ends, sharp branches and more. Yet, not a single mark on her. Which sounded unreal to me. The police were also involved and they wanted to ask her some questions but her parents didn't allow it. Which was understandable after they had just found their daughter after a life and death situation.

After a few weeks, she returned to school and everyone was thrilled. Especially me. Since I couldn't visit her. I remember running up and hugging her tightly. Instantly I felt something off about her. She had this really unusual smell on her. Like the smell you get from burning candles or incense all night long. And I knew for a fact she had a fear of fire ever since she was young. I pulled back quickly and looked at her. Only seeing her smiling face. Her smile felt off too. It didn't feel genuine, rather really forced.

"You okay, Bella?"

"Why wouldn't I be, dearest friend."

I paused for a second. Dearest friend? What kind of name was that. Isabel always called me by my nickname. And never once called me a generic name like that. She still remained smiling. Something definitely felt wrong now. 

"What kind of name is that?"

"What name?"

Her smile disappeared. A shiver ran down my spine from her stare. Her stare felt even more hollow. We remained in our spots, staring at each other before some other of our friends pulled her away.

Ever since then, things got even weirder. Like once, I went to grab something from her bag. And I saw the cleaned out bones of what appeared to be a bird wrapped in tissue. Or another instance, I saw a cut along the back of her neck. And when I asked about it, she said it was nothing. The next day the cut was gone. Things like these made me more uneasy about her. I know she's my best friend and we've been friends since we were toddlers. But I'm sure, something is wrong with her.

Anyways, a few days ago, my parents left town for a trip. So my best friend's parents said I could stay at there house. Which is normal, considering both of our families were tight-knit. Isabel and I, often had sleepovers and practically treated each other's homes as our own. 

My parents agreed, and I went to sleep at their house. It was a friday night, and we both decided to watch a movie. Isabel's parents already went to bed, so we just relaxed and watched a movie in her room. I wanted to chat with her, since we hadn't had the chance to talk ever since she came back, but she insisted on watching an old 1970s movie she had on a tape. It was like talking to a fucking robot, no form of warmth, It felt like I couldn't talk to my best friend about the things I normally do and she wouldn't either. We just sat on her bed. 

I sat close enough to her to smell that same burning smell on her. I hated that smell, Isabel is a very clean person, and the fact that she had a weird smell on her, greasy hair and ashy nails didn't sit right with me. The movie we were watching was one of those weird movies too, grainy print with a stupid storyline. I decided I had enough and excused myself to her bathroom. 

When I went into her bathroom, it also had that weird burning smell. I took a deep breath and glanced around the small bathroom, trying to shake off the uneasiness that had settled in my stomach. I splashed some water on my face, hoping to clear my mind and wipe away the weird atmosphere in the air, but, something caught my eye. A bone. A tiny fragmented piece, of what appeared to be of a wing-bone. Tiny, yet sharp. It sat on the small shelf in the corner, just resting there. What the hell? 

I don't what inclined me to do what I did, but I touched it. Immediately, I dropped it in the sink, the sound filling my ears. The bone was wet, not a watery-wet, a disgusting wet. The sound was much louder than expected as I wiped my hands on my sweater, hurriedly. The sensation still heavy on my hands. I kept it there, and just wanted to leave. Right then and there. 

I opened the bathroom door, ready to brush off the creeping fear, but froze. Isabel stood in front of me, her eyes fixed on me, an unnerving stillness in her posture. I managed to say, though the words felt weak.

“Everything okay?” 

Her smile slipped into something colder, less genuine. “I thought I heard something.”

Before I could process it, she stepped forward, her hand clenched around a small, shiny object. Another fucking bone. My heart raced as I recognized it, my eyes flashing between her and the disgusting object.

“What’s that?” 

Panic surging through me, I felt sick, like I could vomit. Her silence and blank expression filling the air around me, chocking me. She held the bone out again. And said nothing more. 

In that single moment, the realization hit me like a truck. This wasn’t the Isabel I knew. The girl I had laughed with and gossiped with was gone, she was replaced by something hollow and dark. Something I didn't want to recognize. Instinct screamed at me to run. I backed away, breath quickening. Her expression twisted, a mixture of longing and something darker. 

The air thickened, suffocating. I bolted down the hallway, ignoring her calls and the shadows that seemed to stretch toward me. I burst through the front door and into the night, the cool air stinging my lungs as I ran, fear propelling me forward. I didn’t stop until I reached home, slamming the door behind me. Heart pounding, I leaned against it, breathless. But even as I locked it tight, I felt her presence lingering just beyond the threshold, waiting in the dark.

Whatever had taken her in that forest, whatever had returned, was still out there, its smile promising I would never truly escape. Ever since that incident a week ago, I hadn't spoke to her. From what I heard, apparently they moved somewhere else. Nobody in the town, not even their closest family had heard from them. I still feel uneasy, but my mind threatens me not to. 

I miss my best friend, but I think she's gone for good this time.
