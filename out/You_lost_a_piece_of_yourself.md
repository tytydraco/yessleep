My name is Oliver Gallavant, at least, that's what I believe is my name. My past? Me, my friend Abby Theed, and my dad visited a place called Theed Manor. I didn't like it at all, or perhaps I did, I don't remember. We strode into the grand hall, ornate teacups and utensils lined the table, as if it was never touched. It was clean, and it still shone.

Voices crept into my head. I constantly looked over my shoulder in paranoia, the dust suffocating my vision. Every time a voice became too loud, I jumped and looked over at the others that came with me, they just looked at me with worry. "You okay, Oliver?" I nodded, even though none of us believed it.

***"Not yet."*** It whispered.

Abby then pointed something out, "Over there." A blackened spot where two people embraced, as if something was coming for them. "I- oh. *Oh.* It's been... two years." Abby exhaled, of course, these were her parents. What was left of them. My dad knelt over the two and shook his head. "Horrible business. Let's get them out of here before..."

The room rumbled.

"-that. Come on! We gotta go!"

Pieces of rock fell from the ceiling, yet everything seemed to stay in place. However, my legs felt as if they had been hit with a Magnitude 10 Earthquake. Abby was falling behind, I had to help. "Take my hand, go!" She nodded quickly as I practically threw her ahead of me. "Come on!" My dad was keeping the door as long as he could, Abby jumped through, and I followed through-

The doors closed in front of me, I hit them in frustration. Then I noticed something, the rumbling stopped, and the surroundings shifted to something familiar: my home. The house was completely grayscale, yet I was the only one in color. Curiously, I turned on the TV. It buzzed and buzzed, until it disintegrated into a pile of ash. I saw my skin get ever so slightly paler.

***"You lost a piece of yourself."***

"Hey! Wh- who's there?! Show yourself!" I picked up a butter knife on a nearby dining table, it wouldn't do much, but it's better than nothing. The knife disintegrated in my hand.

***"You lost a piece of yourself."***

My skin turned a shade grayer, I saw a crack in the wall. Forcing myself into it, a door lay in front of me. I took a deep breath, though that only made my breathing ever-so-slightly quicker. The door stood ajar, and I walked in... I ran out, but there was only darkness. I then realized, I didn't run out, but the door was still slightly solid. I turned the knob once, then twice, then ten times, then a hundred, a thousand. My breaths became as fast as the speed of light, sweat trickled down the side of my face as goosebumps ran down my body. I shivered, even though it wasn't cold. *"You too?"* It came from behind me, I slowly turned around and looked at the horrific monstrosity that lay in front of me.

*"I can't believe it... You're so whole."* 

The door swung back open, I ran and ran, but there was only darkness. ***"You're next."*** The voice boomed. Each time I tried to run, it repeated that same statement, and my skin would turn a grayer shade. I forced myself to turn around to look at that... monstrosity. *"I'm sorry, I haven't introduced myself, my name's Mason."* Mason the monstrosity outstretched a hand, I reluctantly shook it.

"Mine's Oliver. Nice to meet you, Mason."

*"Mason, huh? That sounds like a really nice name. It's mine?"*

He seemed astonished at his given name, before I remembered. Abby and my dad, right. "Nice to meet you." I hurriedly yelled before I rushed out. This time, an array of senses assaulted me, I could only make out 1: *"Good luck."* I reappeared to the side of the manor, I paid no mind to the two strangers trying to break in, they were calling out for someone named Oliver. I had to find... who? I decided it did not matter, and walked to the left side of the road.

***"You lost a part of yourself."***
