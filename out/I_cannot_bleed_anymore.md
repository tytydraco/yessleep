The flies in my room kept buzzing around forcing me to wake up and run behind them, trying to swat them or just plain drive them out. The room I was given sits near the dumpster hence all the shitty flies. How they keep coming in despite me closing all the windows and is beyond me but there they are, this motel is for junkies who are too zonked out realise the number of them. The stink within the room is just as unbearable, the toilet hasn’t been cleaned since the day it was first used. I was waiting for Alex, and he was really late, and just to add misery the bed was a WMD on its own. I saw bed bugs galore when I first lifted the sheet that covered the mattress and then the stains from times unknown. I sat on the only thing I could clean, a simple wooden chair, and waited for the call.

The phone rang and I picked it before the second ring, the voice on the other end was a woman. “Hello, are you Alex’s family?” I looked at the number and it was Alex’s number but who was this person I thought for a second. “Not really, he is my friend. Who is this?”

“Your number was the only one he called so I had to try, I am Natalia. Alex had an accident, so I was hoping to reach out to a family member to see…”

“Wait, what, how… what happened?” I jumped up in shock.

“He. Um. Listen can you come to Moss Trailer Park, we are in B3?”

I told her to expect in me 30 minutes, I asked about Alex, and she told me to get there fast. I picked my helmet was out in a minute, stepping outside I saw it was still drizzling. I put my helmet on and walked to my bike and got on. I heard a voice from my right, and it was thin guy asking for a couple of bucks, I tossed him the keys and told him to get some sleep. He looked at the keys and then to the room door then back at me, nodding he began walking to the door. I could see from the way he moved he would not last a night, one foot was covered in black splotches of skin, and the other was red and black with rashes. Starting the bike, I exited the motel lot and got on the main road, I headed west to the direction of the trailer park. I was trying to figure out why Alex was there of all places, I rode as fast I could through the rain.

After 20 minutes I reached the park, it was like many I had been to before, a mix of different type of trailers that held the lower class of society. As I rode through path between trailers, I noticed that all were dark, it was only 9 and I expected the usual mix of people still up either watching tv or whatever people do at 9. This place was quiet and the only sounds I could hear were my bike and the rain. I found B3, it was a small trailer hocked to a jeep sitting on the fourth row from the entrance. I parked my bike next to the jeep and walked to the front door, I looked around to see if there was anyone around but I could not see a soul. I knocked on the door and heard a voice from within saying it was open.

Inside the trailer was dark, the only light source being the lamps from outside. I removed my helmet and placed it on a counter across the door. It was a small but comfortable place, the kitchen to my right and to the left another door to the room, small but quaint. I closed the front door and knocked on the room door, I heard someone shuffle around and then the door opened to reveal a bed with a figure lying on it, the woman who opened the door was behind it only showing half her face. I looked to her and asked what happened and she turned to look at the sleeping figure and spoke.

“Alex had come to pack up, we were supposed to leave tonight. He was packing his things when he just fell over, I think he took a bad pill or something. He put on the bed and tried to find someone to help but no one here would bother to even answer the door. I tried his phone and your number was the only one on it.”

I shook my head and walked in to see my friend better, the gloom was making it hard for me to really see what happened to him. I squeezed myself to the left of the bed to get a better look at him, he was dressed in a t-shirt and jeans. His face was blank and was breathing slowly, it was like he just taking a nap. I placed a hand on his shoulder to check on him, his body was cold like he was frozen or something. I withdrew my hand in surprise, I looked at Natalia now who was looking at me. “What the fuck happened to him, he is ice cold. Is he dead or something?”

She shook her head and moved closer to the sleeping Alex, “I don’t know. He said we were leaving tonight and that he had enough to start over.” I looked up and cursed, it felt like he was going to ditch me.

“Look, I know this may sound funny but what did he eat or drink before he… um fell?”

Natalia looked at the open door thoughtfully then down at Alex, she was trying to remember. Time was running out for me now, Alex and I had found ourselves a bag of cash when we stumbled on a drug deal gone wrong and now with the dealers looking for the killers would not hesitate to kill us thinking we killed their people and stole the money. I was beginning to panic and could feel the sweat pour down my face, “look I need to know what it could have been so I can try to figure this out.”

Natalia shook her head slowly then got up, I watched at the slender figure got up from the bed and walk out the door. I followed her movements and could see every curve move and something in me flared up, I never knew who Alex was with until now. She called out from within, and I followed her voice to find her standing at the small kitchen holding a flat board. I moved closer to look at what she was holding and it was a flat marble with a white powder on it, I knew what it was but still gingerly used my index finger to taste it. I licked the small dab on my finger and spat it out immediately, I was coke but there was something else I also tasted. The rancid taste remained in my mouth and I tried to look for something to wash it out. I found a bottle of whisky and took a sip, gargled and spat it out the window.

Natalia looked at me like I was choking on something and asked if I was ok, I shook my head and took another swig of the whisky. After a few minutes I calmed down, I looked at her and then down to my shoes. My head a was swimming from the rush of whisky on an empty stomach, it never hit this fast and before I could stop, I was falling. I fell and kept falling, the darkness around me was rushing past me and all I could do was looking at the darkness beneath me. I tried to move but felt like my body was frozen and my head was now full of those buzzing flies, I wanted to scream but could not move my mouth.

I woke with a shock but realised that I could not move my body, I was frozen in place. I looked around to find myself in another room, I tried to move my head to see better but could not. I was paralysed, panic boiled up in me as I tried frantically to move any part of my body. Where the hell was I, I kept trying to figure that out then realised that Natalia could have spiked the whisky and I fell for it.

“You are awake, wow I must say that one sip took you down faster than Alex.”

I tried to speak but could not move my mouth, looking down as best as I could I saw a shadow at the door. Natalia moved forward and stood over me, she looked different now. He face glowed and her eyes shone, she smiled at me and then bent down to smell.

“MMM…. You smell cleaner than your friend. A shame he pumped himself with so much garbage to make the blood taste like gutter water. You smell divine Park, now tell me something. Where did you think you will hide after stealing from the cartel? Hmm?”

She stood up and moved out of view and I just looked up, I knew I was dead now. She came back in holding the bag, “this barely has more than 400,000 if am honest. Alex was going to cut you off, in fact he was going to offer you up as a ticket to slip out of town.”

“What?” I finally managed.

Natalia smiled and dropped the bag on the bed, “why of course, see, I am his neighbour, and he took a liking to me, so he confessed all the details to me. I knew he was a loner so I decided since he will not be missed, I drugged him, turned out his blood was worse than I thought so I saw your number and I called you over to try my luck.” She had a steel rod in her had now and bent down and I felt a prick in my neck.

I felt the pull from where the pain came from, and I heard her moan in pleasure; my heart was beating faster now. Dark spots began to manifest in my vision, I felt the cold creep in as the pain in my neck began to recede, it felt like drowning in a pool of water slowly. A long while she stood up again and I could see colour come back on her face, the glow felt even brighter on her face and the smile revealed perfect teeth with some red on them.

“Indeed, you are quite a catch, well I cannot let you bleed out completely. I still need seconds, let’s do this…” she smacked me, and I blacked out.

I woke up again and this time I could move my head now, my hands were tied to the bed as were my legs. I tried to wriggle them but to no avail, I looked around to see if I could find something, but it was too dark to see anything. A light came on from outside and Natalia walked in, she sat on the bed and looked at me for a long while like she was deciding what to do with me.

“You have no blood left for me now, I bled you dry, and yet you still live. Odd I must say.”

I stopped for a second when I heard then, “what do you mean, I have no blood left.”

Natalia laughed, “why of course, I drained you, but it seems that you might have been contaminated by my blood or saliva. You aren’t like me that I can say because, but it seems you are something else.”

I pulled at my bindings trying to break free, but I did not have the strength yet, my feet felt even weaker. “Let me go!”

“Oh come now, you aren’t a vampire like me, maybe not yet but soon. No, I cleaned the pipe, but maybe.” She looked out the window and stood up, something had caught her attention. She darted out the door and I heard her screaming then the whole trailer moved, something was thrown at the trailer resulting the jolt. I heard a male voice shout and then another jolt, finally after a while, footsteps of someone coming in were heard.

A large hulking man walked into the room; he bent down just to be able to move. His face was large, but his eyes were small and beady, he looked at me for a moment then spoke. “You were her little plaything I see. I heard that she drank all your blood, hmm.”

“What the fuck is going on?” I spoke at the highest volume I could muster.

He laughed and looked around, “you my friend are what we call as a Trapped. Your soul refused to leave your body after all the blood was drained. Very people I know every lived long, so use your time wisely now, without blood your body will soon die and your soul will finally have to let go.”

He undid the knots and released me, I tried to get up but found I was too weak. He left me without a word and I lay there trying to gather my strength. After a while I finally managed to get up and walked out of the trailer, it was still dark. I wondered how long was I trapped here, I looked around for Natalia but she was gone, there was a large dent on the side of the trailer. There was some blood but nothing to bother with, I walked around for a few minutes trying to figure out what to do. I found the trailer with my bike and went in expecting to find Alex’s corpse or something but found it empty. My helmet was where I left it, and I picked it up and left.

I have no idea how long I have left to live but would rather put this down and just wait now. I tried to cut myself and the open wound just showed what was under and no blood came out. Maybe there is someone out there who can help me.
