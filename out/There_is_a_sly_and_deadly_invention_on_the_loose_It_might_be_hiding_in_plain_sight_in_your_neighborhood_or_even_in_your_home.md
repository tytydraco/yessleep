What could be worse? How can I live and look at a mirror without dying inside? If they want to suppress me for telling the truth, then they can go ahead. My name is Soraya by the way, see, I am no longer hiding. People have to know the truth before something really bad happens.

Eleven years ago, I was still a geneticist deeply involved in a project which only goal was to create animals with above normal strength and intelligence. I guess there is no need to tell you the expected use for such animals. After 1283 attempts, in 2018, we could only obtain 17 fairly positive results and 2 outstanding successes, or the two prides of our work as the project director liked to refer to them:

Subject number 0317. Codename: Pickle. Family: Leporidae. Species: Holland Lop. Description: A cute rabbit that could not develop strength, but at least was capable of great agility and fair intelligence.

Subject number 0861. Codename: Archie. Family: Canis Familiaris. Species: Labrador Retriever. Description: A beautiful, friendly and obedient dog with great strength and intelligence.

All the 19 animals lived in the secret facilities where they were born, but everything changed just only one year after the two prides saw the light of the day. On March the 2nd of 2019, we prepared Pickle and Archie for an umpteenth communication test consisting of them using a fairly large keyboard to type messages to be displayed on a screen.

Not present in the room with them, and using a microphone, the supervisor said:

"Hello Archie! Hi Pickle! Nice to see you again guys. So, what is on your mind today?"

Extroverted as always, Archie jumped on the keyboard first and typed:

'This again? Want to go outside.'

"Don't worry Archie, it will happen soon." The supervisor responded.

'I am one year old. Already. I am grown. No need protection. Need to go outside. Before demise.' Archie replied, surprising us with his conscience of age, size and lifespan.

"Wow! Uh, yes Archie, we know. We will do it soon. Pickle?"

'Soon. Always soon.' Archie typed before leaving the keyboard for Pickle to use.

"Hey Pickle! Anything you would like to share with us?"

'Importan mesage' The rabbit typed.

"Oh! Okay. Well, what is the message?" The supervisor asked.

'Apex Arcie.' Pickle replied, prompting a sitting Archie to stand up in alert. 'Arcie bad. Arcie atak kill all th' The rabbit tried to elaborate when the dog suddenly attacked it.

Pickle hopped and ran towards the guard in the room who started shooting tranquilizers at Archie. The supervisor screamed at Archie to stop, all in vain. After all the efforts made, I could not let Pickle be destroyed by Archie and pressed the command to open the door. Archie dodged all the darts, jumped on the guard's neck and ended him by tearing his throat off, while the rabbit made its escape.

I closed the door back before Archie could escape the test room. We then all witnessed the dog use the push button lock, type the security code and escape. We launched a red alert and saw Archie taking the direction of where we all hid: the central command room. Once again, he typed the passcode with ease and opened the door. Armed with pens, chairs and keyboards, we witnessed Archie completely ignore us and use the commands to free all the 17 other subjects, comprising a bear, a tiger and a king cobra. After doing so, as if we were hypnotized by what we saw, Archie left the commands, and looked at us one after the other. When he looked at me holding pens, plunging his eyes into mine, it felt like he could see my soul, hear my heart beat, and sense my overwhelming fear. Without a single growl or bark, the dog attacked the closest scientist behind it, surprising him and all of us. We all rushed to the door in absolute panic, while the animal used its enhanced brute strength to rip our colleague apart.

Unknown to everyone, Archie's plan was much more elaborate than we thought, as the freed animals were mere pawns that he used to create total havoc and occupy the guards. The bear and the tiger annihilated 15 persons, before they were both finally sedated. The king cobra was found before it attacked Pickle and sedated as well. After the incident, it was later revealed that the dog escaped the facility after disabling the cameras. On its way out, it slaughtered two cooks, a janitor and an office administrator, in other words, living beings that did not pose any form of threat to it.

The government chose silence instead of alert to avoid creating panic, and preferred to wait for Archie to strike again in order to locate him, or to do so using other means such as the diverse surveillance cameras and undercover agents. They do not want to lose their precious jewel.

Before this post gets removed, and I get 'erased' for what I just shared, I want you to please remember this: Archie is a labrador retriever, one of the most common domestic dogs in America and he is conscious of his appearance. He looks like a normal dog and can sure act as such. If he killed your dog and replaced it, trust me, you would not know. I know Archie is still out there. Be careful.
