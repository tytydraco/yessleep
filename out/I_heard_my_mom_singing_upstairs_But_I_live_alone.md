I haven’t slept right since Mom died.

Not just insomnia — more like my body forgot how to rest.

Every time I close my eyes, something waits behind them.

When the night turns quiet enough,  
I can still hear her.  
That song.  
The one she used to hum when I was small.

“Twinkle, twinkle, little star…”

It should sound soft. Safe.  
But when love comes wrapped in fear,  
even a lullaby starts to hurt.

Mom wasn’t gentle.  
It was just the two of us after Dad left.  
Her anger filled the house —  
bills, silence, my mistakes.

She’d yell until her voice broke,  
then later, she’d sit by my bed and sing.  
That same shaky tune — broken, but somehow sweet.  
I’d pretend to sleep.  
Sometimes I really did.  
Her voice slowed my heartbeat.

It’s strange, isn’t it?  
The same person who hurt me  
was also the only one who could calm me down.

Then one morning,  
she was gone.  
A crash. Steel. Glass.  
Silence.

Everyone called it tragic.  
I didn’t say a word.

It’s been five years without real sleep.

The doctor gave me stronger meds last week.  
“One tablet, no more,” he said.  
“Too many could stop your heart.”  
I laughed. Maybe that was fine.

Yesterday, around four,  
I came home early from work.  
Rain outside — that heavy gray kind that swallows the sky.  
I made tea and sank into the couch.

Then I heard it —  
a soft hum through the ceiling.

“Twinkle, twinkle…”

I smiled. The family upstairs again.  
Never met them, but I’d heard the kids before —  
running, laughing, morning chaos.

I thought, nap time.  
She’s putting them down for a nap.

I listened for a while… and drifted off.  
No pills.  
The first time in years I’d fallen asleep on my own.

When I woke up, it was past nine.  
The room dim, streetlights bleeding orange through the curtains.  
And upstairs —  
the song was still going.

Same melody.  
Same rhythm.  
But slower now — heavier — like she was breathing through a wound.

Maybe the kid just wouldn’t sleep.  
But after five hours?  
That’s not a lullaby. That’s obsession.

The sound crawled through the ceiling,  
through the walls,  
pressing against my chest.  
Each note a heartbeat I didn’t want to hear.

Time stretched like it was breathing with the song.  
The more I listened,  
the more it felt like it wasn’t coming from above anymore —  
but from inside the house.

By ten, I couldn’t take it anymore.  
I told myself I’d just ask nicely.  
Nothing crazy. Just neighbor talk.

Sweater on. Door open.  
Cold air biting at my skin.

Their light was still on.  
Door cracked open.  
A soft orange glow spilling out.

“Hello?” I said. Nothing.  
“Ma’am, are you okay?”

The song cut off — sharp as a knife.

I waited, heart pounding.  
Then slowly pushed the door open.

Inside was… my living room.  
My couch. My lamp.  
Even my chipped mug on the table.

Everything looked the same.  
But I was standing upstairs.

I stumbled back,  
rushed down the stairs,  
fumbled with my key.

My door — same number.  
It opened. My place. Exactly as before.  
I looked up.  
The upstairs door was shut tight now.  
No light. No sound.

Maybe I’m losing it.  
Maybe it’s the pills.

I grabbed the bottle.  
Half empty.

It had been full two days ago.  
I hadn’t taken any.

If someone broke in,  
why take sleeping pills?

Then I remembered the security cameras.  
I opened the footage.

At 4:08, I was asleep on the couch.  
At 4:12, I sat up.  
Blank. Still.

I walked to the kitchen.  
Opened the bottle.  
One pill. Chew. Swallow.  
Another. Chew. Swallow.

Humming.

For hours.

At 9:01, I stood,  
walked to the door,  
turned to the camera,  
and smiled.

“Sleep well, my little star.”

It was my face.  
But her voice.  
Mom’s voice.

I froze, listening to that sound —  
soft, steady, familiar.  
And suddenly… I felt calm.

Like she was here again.  
Like everything was finally quiet.

I leaned back, closed my eyes.

And from somewhere above me,  
the lullaby started again.  
Slow. Faint. Breathing.

It’s been days now. I think.  
Hard to tell.

The song hasn’t stopped.  
I just stopped fighting it.

Doesn’t matter who’s singing anymore.  
I’m finally sleeping.

Good night, little star.
