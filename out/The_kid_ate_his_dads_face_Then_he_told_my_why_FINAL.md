Zipperjaw stalks toward me, that open mouth hanging from its unhinged jaw. I try to back away, but I’ve already hit the wall. It’s just me and death, staring each other in the face.

Jonah’s crawled to the edge of his bed, eyes wide, mouth agape in anticipation. It’s like he’s waiting for the monster to do to me what it did to him. To devour me. To take me into its salivating maw and chew awhile, before spitting me back out as a shell of myself. It’s newest acolyte.

I pull the trigger one more time. Still empty.

Not that the bullets made a difference. I’ve been doing this long enough to know they were only ever going to annoy the thing, maybe slow it down if I got lucky. But the bullets weren’t for Zipperjaw. No, they were a little treat for me. Nothing sweeter than pumping a magazine into your own personal boogeyman. 

Not even heroin. 

“Ziiip it…”

There it is again. That monster’s guttural refrain. It crawls forward, googly eyes rolling in those plastic sockets, blood-stained hair shrouding its burlap face. 

There’s nowhere to run. 

It’s this or the cancer, and the cancer’s taking its time. 

Part of me hates giving Zipperjaw the satisfaction, but another part of me hopes I can tear it apart from the inside out. That maybe I can use my fingernails to carve up the soft stuff inside of it. Make it bleed. Make it hurt. It’ll kill me, sure, but the bastard will suffer a bad case of indigestion for doing it. 

I force myself to smile. Tell myself that’s it’s enough. 

Another lie for the pile. 

There’s a snap of ligaments, a twist of a spine and the creature rears up on its legs, tiny arms reaching out toward me, dislocated mouth bellowing a cosmic scream. Its metal teeth flash in the moonlight. Its maw looks like a cavern forming out of nothing. An abyss in the shape of a throat. 

And then it crashes down on me. 

The monster. The jaws. The empty void of its gullet. The hospital vanishes in the blink of an eye, replaced by endless black. Rot tickles my nostrils. Something wet drips onto my forehead. I’m inside it now, Zipperjaw. 

“Don’t feel guilty…”

A voice.

It’s not the guttural rasp of the monster but something softer; human. 

“She made you do it…”

Another voice. 

“Your sister was a monster…”

They’re all around me, the voices. It’s just like Jonah said. Lies. They’re spinning lies to break my mind, to turn me into another sycophant for that creature. 

It happens slow, but bit by bit the darkness thins. My eyes adjust. I see them hanging there, all around me, a legion of carved faces speaking through empty mouths. 

“Adelaide deserved to die…”

I lash out. 

Can’t help it.

I snatch the speaker off the thread, tear the rotting flesh in two. The face falls from my grip. Maybe I’ll do the same to all of them. Maybe I’ll let my last moments be re-victimizing Zipperjaw’s haunted morsels. 

“It’s okay to be angry…”

I wheel about—and there it is. The same flayed face I just tore apart, hanging by a thread. Unharmed. Unaffected. 

“Shut it,” I growl, clapping my hands over my ears. “All of you just shut up!”

“That’s not every nice!”

My eyes snap open. That voice. I know that voice. 

“Say you’re sorry!”

My heart pounds. It can’t be. It’s another trick. More lies from the monster that stole everything. But when I look through the forest of faces I see her. 

Addy. 

My feet start moving before my mouth can catch up. I’m sputtering. It’s not even words I’m speaking, just gibberish but I don’t care because I’m already running. Sprinting. 

“Addy!” I shout. “Addy! It’s me!”

But I hit a wall. 

Not a real one, but something mental. My legs stop moving. The scene shifts. It’s like I’ve sprinted myself into an alternate reality—gone are the hanging strips of flesh. In their place forms a living room peppered with moldy take-out boxes and empty beer cans. A television sits in a wooden cabinet, the bulbous analog display fuzzy with static, casting the man on the couch in an ethereal blue glow. 

Dad?

I try to say the words but my mouth won’t work. 

This body. It isn’t mine. It’s half my size, dressed in dirt-stained, dinosaur pajamas. I’m lying on the floor, a thin blanket pulled up to my chin, shivering as my father snores, his muscle shirt wet with booze. 

No… 

This moment. I remember it.

My mind recoils, thrashing to escape the memory but it’s no use. I’m trapped here. A prisoner of my trauma. 

There’s a creak of footsteps in the hallway. A gentle hum. 

The younger me stirs, but doesn’t make a sound. Father has strict rules. The first is not to wake him. The second is to bring him beer and food when he asks. The third is to zip it—to shut our mouths and keep it down so he can drink in peace and try to forget we exist. 

My arms ache. They’re covered in black and blue reminders of what happens when I don’t obey.

But whoever is coming doesn’t know his rules. My eyes swivel across the room, searching for my big sister in her corner. She’s there, bundled up in her blanket, midnight hair cascading across the stained carpet, fast asleep and unaware of how angry father is about to become. 

It’s a memory. That’s all.

It can’t hurt me.

Yet I feel my heartbeat turn to thunder. I feel my chest ache with anxiety. The humming is getting louder now, so are the footsteps. We live alone in this one bedroom apartment. Always have since mother killed herself when I was a toddler, right in front of me.  

There shouldn’t be anybody else here. Not when the clock on the wall says it’s midnight. 

Not when it’s just the three of us. 

Father snorts. Smacks his lips. For a terrifying second I think he’s going to wake up, realize one of his rules was broken and treat Addy and I to another teachable moment starring his fists. 

But then he scratches his ballooning stomach. Rolls his face so his jowls are practically hanging off the edge of the sofa. 

Then he starts to snore.

I feel myself breathe again, relief washing over my bones. But it doesn’t last long. The footsteps stop in the hallway. There’s somebody there. Short. Unfamiliar. They’re wearing a burlap mask with googly-eyes, a zipper-mouthed smile running low enough to trace their jaw. 

They’re holding Addy’s scissors. 

My consciousness thrashes.

I’m screaming inside this prison, fighting to break free but it’s impossible. It’s Zipperjaw. I know that it’s Zipperjaw—just smaller, shorter. Before it evolved. Before it became the monster it is today. 

But I can’t do a thing to stop it, can’t do a thing but watch my worst nightmare unfold. 

*Snip. Snip.*

The safety shears snap open and shut. Zipperjaw tilts their head, and I feel my pulse begin to riot. 

“Addy…” 

My voice is small, strangled by fear. It’s me trying to get my big sister’s attention, hoping she’ll know what to do. That she’ll tell this stranger to leave before they break one of father’s rules, only she won’t stir. She’s fast asleep, her back to me in the corner of the room. 

Another footstep. Then another. A shadow passes over my blanket as Zipperjaw stalks toward the couch, swaying in the technicolor glow of the ancient TV. It’s wearing the same patchwork dress. Humming the same stolen tune. 

“Addy!” I hear myself hiss. 

Zipperjaw wheels about, googly-eyes fixed in my direction.

I freeze. 

I’m too young to know what’s happening, the dark reality of my situation. All I see is a stranger in my living room. An intruder in a mask. But even at six I’m smart enough to shut my eyes, to pretend to be asleep. 

I want to scream. I want to cry. I want to wake up my father, but he’s hurt me for doing that before. He always does.  

A month ago, Addy tried to save us. 

She told her teacher about the things father does to us when we’re not at school. The way he makes us cry. Then her teacher called a social worker, and the social worker came by but Father didn’t answer the door. Pretended we weren’t home. He pressed a finger to his lips, told us not to make a single peep or else.  

The social worker left a note. It said they’d be back tomorrow, and so Father made us clean the apartment that night. The next morning he ironed his best shirt and tie. Cut his hair. He put make-up on all of our bruises and told us if either of us said a word he’d kill us both. Especially me. He said I’m the reason mom cut her throat. That she couldn’t stand how lousy of a son I was. 

And when the social worker showed up that evening, it was like our father disappeared.

Gone was the drunk. The abuser. 

This man in the doorway smiled and laughed. He wrapped his arms around Addy and I and held us close. Said he loved us. That we’ve struggled since we lost our mom, but we find happiness in hiking. Showed the social worker a bruise he got passing out drunk—said it was from the last trip we took up a mountain. 

Addy and I were too scared to speak. 

When the social worker left, she shook Father’s hand. Smiled. Then she told Addy that it wasn’t good to lie about the stuff she did. That kids like us should be grateful to have a dad like this because there are a lot worse out there, and if we try this again then we might end up with one. 

And then she left. 

By the time her footsteps faded down the stairwell, Father had already cracked both his beer and his knuckles. He told us he’d be pulling us out of school. That starting from now, he wasn’t going to worry about the bruises showing because we were never to leave the apartment again.

The younger me cracks an eyelid. They chance a peek at Zipperjaw. The monster is looming over Father, its back to us, muttering in that raspy, harsh voice like a child masquerading as a man. The words are faint. Hard to hear over the static of the television, but it almost sounds like…

“Do you… like my mask?”

The creature runs its hands across the burlap, shivering with ecstasy. 

“I made it just for you…”

Zipperjaw lifts the scissors. Addy’s scissors. It traces them along Father’s chest, up toward his face. *Snip. Snip.* I can’t see what’s happening from where I’m hiding in the blankets, but I don’t need to because I know how this story ends. 

“You showed me how powerful masks can be…” Zipperjaw rasps. “Masks let us become somebody else…”

*Snip. Snip.*

Father’s leg twitches. Even from all the way on the floor I can taste the alcohol on his breath. It smells thick. Heavy. It smells like the time he didn’t wake up for an entire day, the time Addy and I thought he was dead.

The time we hoped he was. 

Zipperjaw hums louder, enjoying itself as the scissors slide open and shut. “You lied to that social worker…” it whispers. “Put on a mask instead of telling her the truth…”

*Snip. Snip.* 

“Not nice.”

*Snip. Snip.* 

“I’ll make sure you can’t wear a mask ever again…”

My Father groans. Something drips onto the floor. It looks like ketchup but it’s thicker, more red. It’s enough that even at five I know something isn’t right. My limbs start to move. Careful. Quiet. I’m crawling now, inching toward my sleeping sister, panic rattling my voice. 

“Addy! Addy, wake up!”

She doesn’t move. 

Tears stain my eyes. Behind me, the scissors are making terrible sounds. Father is too. He’s moaning, whimpering. His fingers are jumping, breath catching and even his titanic snores are growing thinner but Zipperjaw keeps snipping, bare feet dance in a puddle of blood. 

“Now let’s see what’s under that mask of yours…” it whispers. 

There’s a grotesque sound, wet and sickening as Zipperjaw grunts. It pulls back, peeling something pale and dripping from Father’s face.

His skin. 

“ADDY!” 

The shriek tears from my throat like a siren. I’ve finally realized the magnitude of the situation, but it’s too late. The wheels are already in motion. All I can do is watch as my younger self yanks the blankets off my sleeping sister, finding nothing but a scatter of pillows laid out in the shape of a child. 

Confusion. Shock.

It doesn’t make sense to me. Not then. Yarn spills across the carpet, black as Addy’s hair. Then the pieces start to snap together in my tiny brain, and I realize that somebody took her away. Stole her while we slept and didn’t want us to know. 

So I finally do what I should’ve done all along.

I scream. 

It breaks my heart hearing it, the pain, the way my voice breaks beneath the torrent pouring from my eyes. 

 “ADDY!” I scream. “WHERE ARE YOU?”

And that’s when Zipperjaw finally realizes there’s a witness to its work. It turns to face me. Lifts a finger to that metal smile, hisses for me to be quiet. Only it’s too late for that because even my Father, intoxicated beyond any human limit, is stirring now. And he’s screaming.

He falls from the couch feeling his face. Where it should be. The obese man is floundering, half-angry, half-crying as he stares at his fingers all covered in blood, only he doesn’t know how bad it is yet because he can’t see what his son can. What I can.

It’s all missing.

All of it. He looks like a horror movie come to life. It’s just raw red tendon where skin should be, yellowed teeth peeled into a permanent, lipless snarl. But before he can sober up, before he can process what he’s looking at, Zipperjaw makes its move.

It grips the scissors with tiny hands. Slams them into the man’s skull. Once. Twice.

The third time they break through bone, and his whole body convulses as blood pours from the wound. The monster staggers back. It watches my father gurgle and spasm. It watches him die, shaking with ecstasy. 

Then it turns to me. 

My limbs move in the memory, propelling myself backward. Back into the corner of the living room. Wrapped in Addy’s blankets. I’m still screaming her name, begging for my big sister to come and save me when—

“You little…”

My father staggers forward. Drops onto his hands and knees. His eyes are rolling up on his head. He’s drunk, bleeding out, and he’s got a pair of safety scissors in his brain. But he never needed his brain to live. Just his rage. 

And now he’s running on a full tank. 

He crawls toward Zipperjaw, and before the monster can flee he catches its ankle. Trips it. I watch it hit the floor. I watch my old man crawl on top of the creature and cock back a fist, and for the first time in my life I actually feel a sense of respect for him.

He did what I couldn’t.

He gave Zipperjaw something to feel sorry about. 

His fist comes down. It keeps coming down and soon the monster stops moving. His eyes scan the room, breathless. Then he finds me in the corner. Lifts a finger. “You…” he growls

I give my head a violent shake. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Please don’t hurt me, daddy.”

“I’m not gonna hurt you, you little shit. I’m gonna… fucking… kill…”

He falls forward. 

There’s a loud thump as he hits the floor, leg twitching. Then he goes still, doesn’t even breathe. I stare in horror, cold with shock. 

It’s no wonder I buried this memory. It’s enough that it’s turning my stomach even now. My old man dead at my feet, scissors in his skull, Zipperjaw lying feet away from him, a pool of blood forming beneath its mask. 

Wait.

“Told… you…”

Zipperjaw. It’s speaking to me. Only it isn’t using that raspy voice. It isn’t talking like a girl impersonating a man. It’s talking like…

“Addy?” I whimper. 

My world spins. 

I can’t do a damn thing but watch through my younger eyes as I force myself to my feet, stumble over my dead old man and drop beside the dying monster in a burlap mask. I fumble at its cords with tiny fingers. Lift it off. 

No. 

No please…

“Told you…” My big sister sputters, her face caved in by Father’s beating. “Told you I’d… stop him…”

She coughs and it’s all red. Six years old. I’m just six years old and watching my big sister die after murdering our father. 

“It really hurts,” she chokes out. “Can you make it stop… hurting for me?”

I’m sobbing. 

How? I’m asking.

How do I help you?

How do I make your pain go away?

And Addy asks me if I remember mom. She asks if I remember how mom made the pain go away when she couldn’t handle it anymore, and then she turns, looks at the scissors jammed in our Father’s skull. 

And I’m shaking my head. I know this isn’t okay. I know that I don’t want to help in the way she wants me to but she coughs a river of red down her chin. “Please… Do it for me, Tommy.”

I want to look away but I can’t. Not even when I crawl over to my father’s corpse. Not even when I rip the scissors from his skull. Not even when I drag them across my sister’s throat. Not even when I lay down and cry, holding her in my arms, wishing she’d come back, wishing a monster hadn’t stolen her from me. 

And then the living room starts to shrink. The scene gets fuzzy around the edges. I’m being torn away, ripped across space and time and when I blink again I’m being yakked up onto a linoleum floor, sticky with saliva. 

The hospital room. 

I’m me—back in my body, back in this nightmare with Jonah. 

“What did it show you?” he croaks. 

I force myself onto my hands and knees. 

“C’mon,” he says, licking his lips. “Did it show you my mask?”

Jonah. The kid is out of bed, kneeling beside me in his blue gown. He’s practically vibrating with excitement. He pushes something into my hands. Scissors. Adelaide’s. 

“Cut it off,” he tells me, extending his arms at his sides, offering his face. “Show me what’s underneath. Show both of us.”

“Fuck off.” I cough, push the kid away. He falls on his ass. 

“You gotta! It’s the rules!”

He’s right. Zipperjaw has rules. 

It shows up at midnight. Devours you, zips you up in those jaws. It convinces you to carve off the face of the person you care about most in the entire world. And it makes you feel justified in doing so. 

It’s only after the monster leaves, after the spell wears off that you feel the guilt. 

That you want to make your pain end.

My grip tightens around the scissors. I force myself to my feet, staggering only briefly before catching my balance. It’s a strange feeling, Zipperjaw’s spell. It’s a bit like being inebriated, drunk off  your ass with conviction that you’re the hero of your story. That you’re not just doing the right thing, but the only thing left to you. 

Jonah keeps calling out to me. 

He wants to know why I’m walking away. He wants to know why I’m breaking the rules. After all, he’s my VIP. I told him as much. There isn’t a single person alive that matters more to me than him because he’s my ticket to destroying Zipperjaw.

But now our mission is FUBAR. The monster won. It caught me before I could figure out a way to kill it, hunted me down and cornered me like a rank amateur. Like Jonah. 

Zipperjaw hums in front of me. It’s that same stolen tune. Guttural. Harsh. Like a kid in a mask trying to sound stronger than they really are. I stop before it, the scissors feeling heavier than a chainsaw in my grip. 

The monster. It’s grotesque. How much trauma has it swallowed? How much has it fattened itself on other people’s pain? It smiles down at me with those metal teeth, broken, twisted, then it kneels—offering itself to my blades. 

Jonah’s protests turn to confusion.

“What are you doing?” he shouts, crawling toward us I lift the scissors to the monster. “Stop! Don’t! It has to be the person that matters most to you. That’s me. You told it was me!”

The way he’s talking is like he’s disappointed I’m not carving off his face. “Pipe down, kid. I’m following the rules.”

I place a hand on Zipperjaw’s burlap flesh, then I start to cut. Snip. Snip. The scissors glide, smoother than a razor through the coarse skin, the monster’s expression never shifting from that dead-eyed grin, its metal teeth clicking in its jaw. 

It doesn’t take long. I’m finished before Jonah can pull himself toward me. And when it’s done, my knees buckle. Tears stain my eyes. 

The monster’s mask drifts to the floor. 

“But… But…” Jonah’s sputtering. The kid’s finally getting the picture. “That’s—”

“Adelaide,” I whisper. 

My sister squints up at me like she’s opening her eyes for the first time. Her face isn’t the mangled pulp our Father beat it into, but rather the beautiful girl I always remembered her as. 

“Tommy?” she says, blinking. “Is that you?”

I nod, stifling a sob. “Sure is, Addy.”

Her eyes light up. “You’re so big now. All grown up. You’ve even got gray hair!”

“Guess I do, at that. No thanks to you.”

She laughs. So do I, only it’s a sadder, more mournful kind of laughter. 

“I’ve been having the strangest dreams,” she tells me. 

And I tell her that I know, that her bad dreams are over now. 

“Did I save you?” she asks quietly. “Did I make Dad go away?”

My chest wracks with another sob, and I pull her close so she doesn’t see the tears pouring from my eyes. “Course’ you did,” I whisper, kissing her forehead. “You were my big sister. Saving me was your day job.”

“I’m glad.”

I squeeze her tighter, not wanting to let go. 

“Tommy?” 

“What is it?”

“I’m feeling a little sleepy. Is it okay if I rest awhile?”

My jaw trembles, my whole body quaking in a mess of grief. “Sure thing, Addy. Whatever you need.”

Her face nuzzles against my chest. “Let’s talk in the morning.”

I watch my older sister close her eyes. Watch her drift to sleep. And the next time I blink, she’s gone. It’s just me kneeling on the hospital floor, holding a patchwork doll in my hands with a zipper smile and googly eyes. 

All that’s left of Zipperjaw. All that’s left of Adelaide. 

Jonah’s gasping as he forces himself to his feet. “That thing… That thing was your sister?”

I stare down at the doll, wiping the last tear from my eye. “No,” I tell him. “Just her pain.”

He’s gripping the sides of his head. It’s all crashing down on him now. His guilt. His grief. He’s realizing the horror of what he’s done, why he’s wearing that mess of bandages around his throat, why he can taste his father’s face in his teeth. 

“Oh my god,” he says, staggering back against his bed. “I killed him–and…and… he killed her, didn’t he? My mom. That’s why I… It’s why I…”

“Ate him?” I mutter, grabbing my jacket off the chair, pocketing the doll. “Yeah. Zipperjaw’s dead, so I guess its spell is too. Sorry, kid. No more feel-good sycophancy for you.”

His eyes get wide. “It was her. Your sister. She made me murder my father. Made me eat his fucking face!”

He lunges at me, but I sidestep him. He’s a big kid. Twice my size. If Jonah wanted to, he could give me a real headache, but instead he breaks down on the floor. 

“Your sister… ruined my life…” 

There he goes again, crying. Only this time, he isn’t alone. It’s a strange thing, feeling emotions when you’ve spent your whole life running from them. It’s messy. Chaotic. 

“I’m sorry,” I say through my tears. “For everything.”

“Your sister—”

“Didn’t understand what she was doing!” I snap. “Addy thought she was saving people, okay? She thought she was showing them who their loved ones were beneath their masks. To save them from what happened to us. Only…”

“Only most people aren’t half the monsters your father was!” Jonah shouts. “My dad was a murderer. He killed my mom. He deserved to suffer for what he did, but he didn’t deserve… He didn’t deserve what Zipperjaw made me *do* to him.”\\

My rage deflates, and for the first time, I bow my head in defeat. “You’re right, he didn’t.”

“All of this… All of this because of some damaged little girl. It isn’t fair, man. It isn’t fucking fair.”

Jonah collapses into himself, sobbing. I want to say something to the kid, but I’m not sure the words exist, so instead I collect my briefcase, make for the door. 

“That’s it, then?” Jonah barks. “You’re just leaving?”

“I…”

“Do you have any idea what your sister did to me? I’m screwed, man. My head is a fucking mess. I’ll be dreaming about monsters until the day I die—which will be in prison, for the record.” 

“It wasn’t Addy’s fault,” I tell him.

“Maybe not,” he seethes. “But it sure as hell wasn’t mine either.”

I heave a sigh. The truth is, I’d like to pull some strings for him, and if the Order hadn’t ex-communicated me then I might give it a shot. But as it stands, I’m powerless. No different than him. Just another nobody walking through a haze of guilt. 

“I’m sorry,” I tell him. 

It’s the first time I’ve said the words. They don’t taste half as bitter as I thought. 

He keeps sobbing as I make for the door. The sad truth is that he’ll probably never feel good again—not truly. Some nightmares you wake up from. Others follow you to your grave. 

“I didn’t mean it,” he calls after me. “That stuff about your sister.”

I pause. 

He wipes his eyes. “It wasn’t her fault. She was a kid, scared and confused. Those things I said—I’m sorry.”

My jaw hangs open, not knowing how to respond. 

He stands up, composing himself as he walks toward me. “Thanks,” he says, extending a hand. “For not eating my face.”

“Yeah,” I mutter. “No problem.”

He clasps my hand, pays me a gentle smile. Then turns. Limps back to his hospital bed. It doesn’t make sense—how can a kid go through all of that and still find the will to smile? 

“Jonah?”

He turns, ashen-faced. 

“Get dressed,” I tell him.

“Why?”

“We’re going for a drive.”

He blinks, not understanding. It’s like he wants me to admit I’m getting soft in my old age. 

“The hell are you looking at me like that for?” I grunt. “We made a deal, didn’t we? Told you I’d give you my story when all this was over with, and I can’t fit it all in before the cops arrive. So get dressed. We’re leaving.”

“And then what—you’re bringing my back here?”

The way he says 'me' catches my attention—too much emphasis, like he's not sure who he means. I heave a tired sigh. 

“Listen, kid. You don't owe me anything.  You've already suffered more than most on account of my family. But if you want to help… there's work to do.”

“As in hunting monsters?” he asks. “Saving people?”

The Zipperjaw doll twitches in my pocket. Once. Twice. Six times, one for each year Adelaide lived.

“Yeah,” I tell him, ignoring it. “Something like that.”

Jonah's eyes flick down to my pocket, and for just a second, he smiles like he knows something I don't. His hand moves to his throat, fingers tracing the bandages there in a pattern that looks almost like scissors opening and closing. 

"Deal," he says.   
  
He pulls the curtains to get dressed, but I catch him humming: just a note or two.

Adelaide's song.
