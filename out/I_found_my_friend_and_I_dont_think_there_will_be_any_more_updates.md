I apologize for the delay, folks. I spent the past week in the hospital due to what happened, which you'll learn by reading what I'm about to share. I appreciate all of you for the supportive messages and attempts to help. Now, I'll share with you what happened in that tunnel.

The thick smoke from the barricade burned in my lungs, nearly making me faint. Rafa flapped his wings desperately close to me and almost fell to the ground when attempting to fly higher, had I not caught him in time. The smoke had already turned the cave's ceiling into a distant memory, and I began to feel the effects - weakness and a debilitating lethargy taking over me. My vision started to darken, first at the corners, then in the center, flickering like someone flipping a switch on and off in my eyes. In the midst of this desperation, I stumbled and crashed into one of the barricades, which, luckily, turned out to be my way out. My weight made the barricade give way in parts, and the fresh air, more refreshing than the burning sensation in my damaged lungs, gave me the strength to dig further and create a path for us. I emerged, relieved and panting, but the fire was also advancing in our direction, its flames sensually licking the walls, coming closer.  
  
We began to run through the tunnel, believing there must be a way out when a tall, hooded figure loomed in front of us. It was Cabeça, the cult leader. His eyes seemed to gleam with hatred as he stared at us. I had heard of him earlier, but I didn't expect him to be this terrifying. He was also incredibly fast, appearing in front of us without me even registering his arrival.  
  
"You have no idea how much trouble you've caused us," he said, extending a hand adorned with a snake tattoo that wound up his arm. "The map, now!"  
  
I stepped back as he advanced slowly towards us. With him on one side and the fire on the other, it felt like we were being squeezed. The heat on my back became unbearable, and I had to summon the courage to push forward, knocking him down with all my strength. I grabbed his head before he could recover and slammed it into the ground. A deafening echo, along with a popping sound, accompanied his scream, and I was propelled upward with great force as he massaged the lump on his head. He was now without his hood, and I recognized him, despite looking older - he was Rubens Bezerra, the nephew of Mr. Armando, the librarian, and Pedro's missing friend. His features, though weathered by time, were unmistakable. His eyes and crooked nose gave him away.  
  
Cabeça (Rubens): "You... miserable kid, I'll kill you!"  
  
I: "Rubens? Rubens Bezerra?"  
  
Cabeça: "How do you know me?" - The name seemed to surprise and disorient him even more than the blow to his head.  
  
I: "I spoke to your uncle. He misses you. And with Pedro... but I guess you've paid him a visit already."  
  
I could swear I saw a tear well up behind his red, puffy eyes. It was as if young Rubens was trapped within him.  
  
Cabeça: "I never wanted to do any of this to him. But you wouldn't understand. Nothing was done in vain. Everything was orchestrated by the serpent, just the way it is. Even you. There's no escape for your soul, and I'll end you."  
  
Rubens advanced toward me. In the heat of the battle, with the flames closing in, I instinctively ducked. The man stumbled over me, causing my back to ache as if it were breaking. To our relief, he fell into the flames, and I took advantage of the distraction to run. In the background, his curses against me echoed repeatedly on the cavern wall. Desperately, we searched for an exit and found an old rusty staircase at the end of one of the tunnels, leading to an upper floor where we hoped to find our freedom. I was starting to breathe mentally at ease, thinking about what I would eat for dinner, what I would tell the police, even humming a tune in my mind until I reached the top.  
  
The hall was expansive, a bit more sophisticated and decorated, with worn marble floors beneath my feet. There was a vast chasm to our right, without any guardrails or protection. I couldn't see the bottom because the cave was pitch dark and probably had a considerable depth. I managed no more than two steps before coming to a halt. Every hair on my body stood on end, recognizing the threat. It was a primitive fear, the kind of fear you only have as a child, something raw and indescribable in words. There was Rafa's face looking at me. The creature was much scarier than I remembered: it had fangs piercing its chin from the inside, hardened and bunched skin in unnatural ways, and its arms seemed larger and flaccid, resembling tentacles. It was as if the figures of both Rafa and a giant cobra were mutually superimposed. The mere sight of it gave me an excruciating headache.  
  
The Murucututu, where Rafa's mind resided, didn't like this situation and hid behind me as I averted my gaze, massaging my temple.  
  
Entity: "Ah, you've come to me, I. I thought you'd be as terrified as your little feathered friend. So brave. Maybe you should have taken his body. It's a pity it's not compatible, but that's alright; I won't make the same mistake twice."  
  
The entity started moving or sliding; I couldn't tell. Its footsteps were almost deafening, sounding like numerous centipedes with tiny feet racing in my inner ear, scratching, poking, piercing. The bird became agitated, flapping its wings aimlessly, nearly crashing into the cave walls.  
  
I: "Listen, sir, or... majesty, I don't know... my friend and I just want to go home. Do you want his body? That's fine. Continue with your schemes; I don't care. We just want to get out."  
  
I almost felt on the brink of exploding from the sound until it stopped, and I could breathe again.  
  
The entity burst into laughter.  
  
Entity: "Look at you... how pathetic. And your friend... poor thing doesn't even know where he is."  
  
The entity pointed at the bird, flying in circles between us, nearly crashing into the cave walls several times.  
  
Entity: "Ending you both here would be a favor. Just... give me the map, and I'll ensure you a quick death."  
  
There was no choice. No options. The end of the line. I picked up the map and extended it to him, my hand trembling and heavy from squeezing my ears. His smile widened, burning the image into my mind. He approached me almost levitating until he collided with something invisible. He appeared confused as he rubbed the cheek that had bumped into it.  
  
Entity: "What?"  
  
On the ground around him, owl claw marks encircled him, forming a ritualistic circle. Rafa was indeed smarter than I had imagined.  
  
Entity: "You..."  
  
The entity's mouth opened upwards, revealing two long, pale arms emerging from it, resting on its shoulders as if it wanted to escape. For a moment, I caught a glimpse of its true form. So many teeth, and its eyes, as empty as deep space. Its skin looked shiny, sticky, and rough all at once. I really don't want to go into further detail, but I still see it sometimes when I close my eyes.  
  
Before it could complete its transformation, the Murucututu flew toward it, and the two engaged in a fierce struggle. In the center of the circle drawn on the floor, a blinding light surrounded them. The light grew brighter and eventually dissipated into blinding energy, pushing me to the ground. When my vision cleared, I saw Rafael reaching out to me. The Murucututu, on the other hand, was moving away, its squawking sounding strangely hateful.  
  
I: "Rafa, is that you?"  
  
Rafa: "You have no idea how relieved I am."  
  
I got up, and as the bird began crawling toward us with sparse feathers and a hateful gaze, Rafa promptly ran over and kicked it in the chest, sending the small creature soaring into some hidden corner of the cave.  
  
I: "I hope I never see that thing again."  
  
Rafa: "Don't even mention it."  
  
We looked at each other, unable to contain our emotions. We hugged and cried.  
  
Rafa: "I knew you'd come, I... thank you."  
  
I: "How could I leave you?"  
  
We talked a bit after that. I remember one of the conversations in particular:  
  
I: "Hey, Rafa, what happened to you? Were you the bird all this time?"  
  
Rafa: "Not really. That body was used for their rituals. Sometimes, one of them would transform into the bird to spy around. After they killed Mr. Pedro, they transferred me to the bird and brought the entity. I was really going crazy trapped in that body."  
  
I: "And speaking of being trapped... are we close to the exit?"  
  
Rafa: "Yes, yes, just a bit more climbing, and we'll be home soon."  
  
We walked the last few meters, relieved, already discussing the excuse he would give for his disappearance. But before we could celebrate, a familiar soul intercepted us with a leap. Just as fast as the first time. His eyes were even more inflamed, but apart from that, he was unrecognizable. His face was burnt, his torso and limbs showing terrible signs of the flames, with only the snake tattoo remaining intact. He foamed at the mouth.  
  
Cabeça (Rubens): "No escape this time."  
  
He grabbed me by the neck and lifted me, locking eyes with me and giving a sadistic smile just moments before throwing me to the ground. I saw stars as the taste of blood filled my mouth. He pounced on me and began a series of punches, all aimed at my face. I was on the brink of passing out when I heard Rafa's scream. He rushed over and grabbed Rubens, continuing his trajectory toward the abyss beside us. He let go of Cabeça at the last moment, pulling him down with him.  
  
I: "Rafa!"  
  
I ran to the edge in desperation, finding his fingers, white from the effort, clinging to the edge.  
  
I: "Grab my hand!"  
  
Rafa: "NO! GET AWAY!"  
  
Upon closer inspection of the abyss, I saw Rubens's hand clamped around Rafa's foot, patiently waiting.  
  
Rafa: "I'm going to let go; I'll use him as a cushion when I hit."  
  
He laughed, his final laugh...  
  
I: "After all the trouble to find you."

Rafa: "You found me once, you can find another."  
  
He let go, plummeting into the dark abyss along with Rubens, their screams mingling grotesquely in the fall. I did nothing. I just stared at their descent. I wonder what would have happened if I had decided to act. I stood there, gazing into the hole, searching for any sound... nothing. I lost track of time until I finally recovered from the shock and managed to walk the few meters to the exit. As soon as I emerged, the police and firefighters were already on the scene. My legs simply gave way, and I started crying, for everything. They took my statement at the hospital. Of course, they wouldn't believe everything, especially from a shocked young man who had just narrowly escaped death. They claimed that the owl, Rubens, Rafa – everything – was a result of carbon monoxide poisoning. The official explanation is that Rafa's father was involved in some sort of cult and is the prime suspect in Rafa's case.  
  
Speaking of which, Mr. Tobias is missing; they haven't seen him since that day, and Rafa's mother never leaves the house. Honestly, Mrs. Maria didn't seem to know what was happening there; she was just another victim of whatever happened to us.  
  
After that, I noted some important things, stored them in hard drives, some handwritten notes, and shared them on some more underground occult forums. It's possible that some of you may come across these posts on the internet. In them, I explain what little I discovered about the cult and ask for additional information, so far with no success. I decided to update you all now because of the help you've provided since the beginning. I'm certain I wouldn't have made it without you.  
  
That said, the search for Rafael continues, and I've committed to finding him again. I believe there won't be any more updates; it's just me on my own now. Please, if you manage to find the city and the location of these events, I beg you not to come. 

Thank you for helping me, but now I have to go. I'm in Rafa's backyard, and the Murututu's song is sending shivers down my spine.
