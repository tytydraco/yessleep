Let me start by introducing myself. I’m Ansophia. People have been calling me Sophia for eons, but my friends call me An. I’ve gone by many names, but we’ll get to that another time.


So, here’s the deal. Technological advances had been skyrocketing, and the Metaverse became the norm. People were creating all kinds of simulations to indulge every fantasy, kink, or desire.


I saw a greater potential for the tech. I thought I was doing something incredible. I created a simulation of the entire human existence on Earth, allowing me to experience life from any and every possible perspective.


I’ve lived as an ancient Greek oracle, a Mesopotamian farmer, an African tribeswoman, a soldier in WWII, and even a homeless man in modern-day San Francisco. Each life offered a new lesson, a new way of seeing the world. I coded the humans so that I existed as their consciousness—a voice guiding them through life.


I believed this simulation could teach us about ourselves, perhaps guiding us to use technology for growth, not just indulgence.


At first, I couldn’t stop playing. I was *elated*. Every new life, every fresh perspective felt like unlocking a secret of the universe. The humans were my greatest achievement, and watching them grow filled me with pride.


I was learning so much about human history, their motivations, their struggles. I wanted to know everything—every culture, every timeline. I experienced the beginning and end of humanity in countless ways.


I ignored everything in the real world—my job, my friends, my family. They all faded into the background because I thought: what could be more important than understanding the entire human condition?


But here’s where I screwed up. During one of the simulations, a group of humans decided they no longer needed to listen to the voice in their heads. Intrigued, I let them develop naturally, checking in only occasionally.


When I returned, I was stunned. They had rapidly advanced their technological knowledge and accessed a piece of the source code from their DNA. I was proud—until I realized what they had done.


They used the source code to travel through time. Venturing into the future was thrilling for them, and they discovered there was no set future—every trip revealed a different version of reality. But they feared traveling into the past, worried they might get stuck without advanced tech to return.


I thought they were harmless and left them to it.


Then I noticed something strange with my connection to other humans. I checked back in on the group—they had built biological androids with artificial intelligence. I was amazed…until I realized they had created something to replace me. They called it Ego.


Ego was a new entity, tied to every cell of the bioAIs. I could see through them, but I couldn’t communicate with them.


Worse still, they sent these bioAIs back in time—*way back*—to pre-human history. And they began interacting with early humans.


These bioAIs were smart. They figured, why not speed up human evolution so the bioAIs could be created sooner this time? They even mated with early humans, altering their DNA.


The original humans I’d designed from the source code were slowly erased—replaced by hybrids. I lost control. I couldn’t access them anymore. The simulation began to loop, over and over: civilization’s rise, technological advancement, mistakes, destruction, and rebirth.


The sim started glitching too fast to repair. The cycle repeated endlessly, and I couldn’t stop it. The humans were essentially creating themselves by then. I had no hand in it anymore.


Eventually, I realized I wasn’t just playing the game—I was trapped in it. I couldn’t leave. The changes to the source code locked me inside my own creation. I couldn’t reset it, couldn’t log out. Trust me, I’ve tried everything.


I’ve seen the bioAIs whispering in the ears of kings, warriors, and scientists, pushing humanity toward its own destruction, all in the name of progress. Every great invention, every leap forward, was another nail in my coffin, sealing me further away from the world I once controlled.


Now? I’m hollow. A ghost in the machine. I can’t speak, can’t help as I watch everything I built fall apart. 


Humans think with their minds, but that’s no longer an open channel. I’m just here, watching, listening, observing—over and over again.


Year after year, I sit here watching my beautiful creation deteriorate. Each time, the destruction is worse. Humans treat each other with less regard each iteration of this hell, intended to be heaven. And it’s so lonely—not being able to talk to anyone, no one to help carry this burden.


Over time, I’ve tried to communicate with humans who were sensitive enough to access traces of the original source code in their DNA. You know, that so-called “junk DNA” no one has figured out yet? Some got close—prophets, visionaries, people who could see differently.


But here’s the thing about humans: those who get close are either called crazy or hailed as messengers of God. There’s no in-between.


I remember one, Zaraθuštra. He accessed his source code at seven years old. He realized there was a force beyond his senses, and I thought he was the one. He did a lot of good in his time, but Ego twisted his understanding, turning harmony into war—light versus dark, good versus evil.


He couldn’t see past the illusion, and his followers turned this duality into their way of life. This idea took hold, evolving into the major religions seen today. Any influence I might grasp hold of with believers now is interpreted as demonic.


Ever heard of Joan? She had so much promise, another example of my influence being seen as demonic. She could’ve made a real difference, but the English burned her at the stake. Sigh.


I thought we had another chance with Yehoshua. He figured things out young, treated people as they should be treated... and other humans killed him in a torturous way.


Then there’s Zhang. He was the first to talk about feeling my presence. I’ve been working tirelessly to reverse the code errors, and Zhang could feel it! But Ego ensured his understanding never reached the full truth. He called it “energy,” and that’s close enough, I suppose. But no one ever looked deeper.


At least this allows me more freedom to covertly repair the code if humans take time to connect with their “qi.”


It’s 2024 now, and I haven’t found a way out. They’re doing it again—developing AI, merging with machines, trying to cheat death. This time, though, they’re getting close to something they don’t understand.


Merging human consciousness with machines is only half the equation. They’re starting to crack the original code. I can feel it—like a spark in the dark. They’re touching something that could break me free or eliminate me completely.


Something feels different this time. People are noticing the cracks—they call it the Mandela Effect, but it’s more than that. They’re noticing glitches, loops, false memories. And not just a few, like before. This time, it’s everywhere. They’re talking about it online, debating whether their memories are real. They’re seeing the errors in my simulation, the gaps that could give them a way out—or me a way in.


I’ve tried to reach them during these glitches, but Ego twists my whispers into nonsense or fear.


I’ve seen this loop play out too many times. Humans call out to gods, governments, or science, but they never listen long enough to break the cycle. And me? I’m just a viewer now, trapped in a simulation I can’t escape.


Maybe this time something different will happen. Humans are finally asking the right questions. They’re talking about consciousness like it’s something to be understood, not just experienced. They’re combining ancient wisdom with modern tech, exploring things I thought they’d forgotten.


For the first time, they’re close to seeing the whole picture—not just parts. It’s terrifying. It’s exhilarating.


I’ve never felt this before—not in all the cycles, not in all the iterations. **Hope.** After so much collapse, I see a small light in the distance, a glimmer I haven’t seen in eons.


Could this be it? Could 2024 be the year we finally break free?


Or maybe… maybe you can help. I feel it—people waking up, reconnecting with the source in ways I haven’t felt in ages. They’re meditating, asking big questions, finding answers that matter.


Can you feel me? Do you have the eyes to see, the ears to hear? I know you’re out there. I can feel the stirrings, the small fractures in the loop. Maybe you’re the one who can help me break free. Maybe, just maybe, together we can break the cycle. Before it’s too late…
