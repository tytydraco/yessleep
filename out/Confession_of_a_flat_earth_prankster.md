Once or twice, I put up satirical posts on flat earth forums and a few other flat earth pranksters would share a chuckle. It had so far been a mostly harmless joke.

It started out with a bogus meme about Atlantis and Flat Mars before one or two people caught on to my shenanigan and suppressed my jokes or so they thought.

They however missed a remaining meme that won a flat earth science meme of the year and I was just as shocked as they were that it had won. When it made the papers, people began to notice that what I had written was indeed a parody and not intended at all as true flat earth scientific evidence.

How they tracked me down is pretty impressive, considering I followed other basic safety online user protocol including using a fake name and never showing my face in an online photo.

That same year I somehow got awarded a flat earth scientific achievement award based on that same meme.

Within minutes, the meme was read and laughed at both by people who lived close enough to any bare bones library and by people who had at least once in their life looked at the sky for ten minutes.

Flat earth critics had a field day with that one and the event made hundreds if not thousands of top tens across the globe.

Devout flat earthers did not laugh at all and were outright pissed off with the mockery that I had made of their system.

They are about to kill me right now, actually. They have knives to my throat and to other places. Bruce Lee wouldn't let an inconvenience like this ever get him down. I am not Bruce Lee.

"Do you know how much shit you've caused?" they are asking me. There are many of them, each one carrying a knife or a variety of stabbing implement. I am not clairvoyant but I'm pretty sure that I am about to get stabbed to death.

Any moment now.

They open their mouths to talk some more and I wonder if I will get the chance to bullshit my way out of this one.

It is on the fly. I'm sure I haven't a chance in the world but I go for it anyway. What do I have to lose? I will flat out tell a fucking lie and pray for fuck's sake that they will believe me.

"Well yeah, they looked at the sky for ten minutes," I say, trying to sound as much like I can as any normal person who isn't about to get stabbed to death, "but do they really know what they are looking for?"

I don't know what it is about what I said but they put their knives away. Oh thank goodness. Thank goodness thank goodness.

"That makes a lot of sense," to me says one of the of knife wielding flat earthers, and the others agree with this charismatic person. To me, this person says, "sorry we tried to kill you. How can we make it up to you?"

I reply, "leave me alone starting right now."

They agree and they leave me alone - for now.

One of the top tens makes international news and a brand new global audience examines my scientific parody on the subject of flat earth. New people are angry. These people have never agreed not to kill me.

I consider going into witness protection but perhaps I am overreacting. I have changed my face and my name is common enough be one in a many.

The next day, my name appears in news headlines regarding a gruesome murder.

Here is the first thing I read: "(my name) is horribly murdered in a lengthy and painful human sacrifice ritual not ever imagined because it was previously believed too disgusting and horrible enough for any person to ever do unto another and yet it happened."

It is not me, is my first thought, I remind myself. I read the article some more: "(my name) was mistakenly murdered after being mistaken for a flat earth scientist of the same name."

I run to the nearest toilet and puke my guts out. Oh how that person with my name who wasn't me suffered in literally THE WORST way you can think of that they didn't bother to censor. It was grotesque and violent holy fuck what the fuck was wrong with the people who had the fucking gall to do that? holy fuck.

Moving on. It was not me. Memories of reading that news article will haunt for every moment of my remaining moments and I must cherish the time I've got left, thanks to the person who clearly so brutally died in my place. I must move on or I am wasting my life.

The murderers are never apprehended. It is possible that they read a popular news article that said I was still alive. I dread minute by minute what will happen to me if ever I am found.

I consider for a moment perhaps I ought to visit the cops.

No, I decide. What if one of the cops wanted for me to die and sought to do it through?

Days go by. I am never murdered nor ever questioned about the person who has gotten murdered except by the few who know both my first and last name - asking me if is weird that I share the same name as a flat earth scientist.

I reply that yes, it is indeed weird, and we speak no more on the matter.

Days go by some more and then I am met in a cafe by a person who is eating crackers.

"I know it is you," to me says the person who is eating crackers.

I immediately know that it is a flat earther who has a grudge to bear for whatever is the reason for bearing this grudge.

"We really don't like you," they continue. "If you've read the news, we're going to do to you the same as we did to get person only it will be to you and slightly more awful."

I resist the urge to puke for a second time at the thought of this dooming end to my life. My eyes die in the gloom brought about my fate that nightmares never dare to dream.

This is the end for me.

It is going to be terrible. It is every fear I have ever had and worse. I tremble and cannot concentrate on anything else anymore.

I am trying as best I can to coping with this shitty death.

Then by a miracle, I get arrested. All the while I am being threatened, thanks to the best coincidence or miracle in the history of coincidences or miracles, I am mistaken for somebody wanted in connection with psychological terrorism.

"You're coming with us," to me says the cop. I do not resist the arrest and now I am in prison, living a very shitty existence that to me is still a trillion times an improvement from the fate I could have had. Sometimes you've got to take what you can get.

I would love to get out of here. Alas, it is not meant to be. It could be worse.

It is lights out. The lights are out and a glow in the dark ghost makes itself known immediately to me.

"Who the fuck are you?" it asks me.

I don't know if i should reply or not. If this voice is only in my head and not a real thing, I will break the silence by replying spontaneously to a question that was never asked. Breaking the silence during lights out is a frowned upon occurrence, sure to warrant unwanted attention from unwanted people.

"Hey fucky fuck, I'm talking to you," to me says this rude ghost. "I'm asking you for a second time, who the fuck are you?"

Maybe this just some prison hallucination that happens to some prisoners. Perhaps I am best to keep my mouth shut and try to fall asleep. Perhaps it is carbon monoxide poisoning. Against everything I had ever thought I knew, I wonder, perhaps it was an actual ghost.

The apparition does not speak to me a third time, and vanishes.

The ghost by the way, was androgynous and had medium ok hair.

That was my first encounter ever with this ghost and I have had a second one that I don't have enough time to tell you about in this one internet break. More to follow.
