In an older part of the world, hidden in a murky forest, there is a castle. One that is unlike any other. 

No royalty ever occupied its walls, no army ever marched against it, no villages ever took shelter under its shadow. 

This castle was no stronghold against the outside, no bastion of safety from invaders- it was never meant to keep anything out.

Houska Castle was designed to be a cage- a locked door. 

In the center of the castle, enclosed within stone and silence, lies a chapel-one built not to worship, but to contain. Beneath its altar, Houska’s only prisoner waits.

They say the chapel, built in the Archangel Michael’s name, wasn’t meant to bless-it was meant to bind. Beneath it lies a pit with no bottom and no light. A gate, it is said, between Earth and Hell.

Or so the story goes, if you believe in things like that. I didn’t. In fact, I’ve made my career off of not believing in the occult. I’m an independent filmmaker with a passion for anything horror related. 

It started off as a love for ghost stories from my grandpa and grew to trying to find some piece of the supernatural to hold onto. Any scrap of proof that maybe there’s more to this world than the eye can see.

But one failed investigation after the next turned me sour. And, eventually, I gave up my belief and my hope. 

After that my films changed tone from mystery to criticism. I spent a good few years debunking legends and myths almost bitterly. 

And it was with this same bitter attitude that I took on Houska Castle. A gateway straight to Hell- or merely a hole in the dirt. 

So, I did what I usually do- emailed some museum staff, introduced myself over the phone, and got permission to film inside the castle for one night. They told me the building closes at sundown and that I could film as soon as any customers had gone home. 

They finished the call with this,

“The chapel door is to remain shut at all times.”

A nice touch, I thought. Cute almost- just keeping up the act of the spooky old castle in the woods.

I arrived that afternoon. The drive through the forest felt appropriately miserable- narrow roads with trees leaning just too close for comfort. And my GPS was acting up a bit. Normal for being this far out in the woods, I figured.

Houska was actually quite beautiful, in its own way. Like something out of a macabre painting: perched on a cliffside, stone walls stained with age, windows like empty eye sockets. This place was aged, but it didn’t look like it had much history. No battle scars or other marks to indicate any event. It was, from the outside, a blank slate. 

I hauled my gear out of the van as the sun was going down. The last of the tourists had cleared out some time ago. The only human interaction I had was with the woman at the front desk who handed me a visitor’s badge and a heavy old key with a ribbon tied to it. I don’t think she cared much for a foreign film maker intruding here- she didn’t so much as smile at me. Didn’t ask questions either. 

She simply explained to me what I had already been told. The castle is mine to document, but the chapel stays closed, no exceptions. Unfortunately for them, the key they handed me was the key for *everything.* And I had every intention of abusing this newfound power. I was making a film about demons and ghosts. Did they really expect me to leave the best part out? Not a chance. But I politely nodded my head as she spoke. And without a goodbye, she went out the same way the tourists had. I inhaled deeply. It’s the same feeling as when you're a kid and your parents leave town for a week. Freedom. Free reign to do whatever I like with no exceptions. And this place had potential. 

Walls of rough-hewn gray, some blocks mottled with lichen or water stains. The floor was uneven, patched with old timber in some places, worn flagstone in others. Here and there, old iron sconces dotted the walls, long since rusted, now holding thin electric lights that hummed faintly when lit.

There were no lavish tapestries or suits of armor like you’d expect from the movies. Houska had no royal lineage, no grand halls of triumph to display. What little decoration there was seemed chosen to unsettle, not impress.

A few paintings hung crooked on the walls, their subjects lost to cracked pigment and creeping mold-what remained were faint outlines of pale figures with sunken eyes and contorted hands. One long corridor held a series of stone reliefs-angels, I think, though their faces had been worn blank over time, their wings sharp and jagged against the walls.

Here and there stood the odd wooden statue, saints or monks perhaps, their robes eaten away by rot, their hollow eyes seeming to track me as I moved. The castle had no warmth. It didn’t feel abandoned- it felt waiting.  


I started with the basics: exterior shots in the fading light, some slow pans of the empty halls, a few moody stills of the interior. Then, I did what I always do. Wandered around gingerly for the camera while talking to my audience. I explained what I knew of the castle's history, playing it up for the sake of tension, and occasionally froze as if I heard something. Essentially pretending to be afraid of the ghosts I knew weren’t there.

I did a few takes like that. Walk the hall, pause at a dark corner, shine the light just so, furrow the brow- the usual tricks. You’d be surprised how many “paranormal” videos are made in the editing room.

But then something happened that did make me freeze. It was like someone turned off the sound. There had been ambient noises that I didn’t notice-crickets chirping, wind blowing through trees. Their absence was far louder than they ever were. I held my fingers to my ears and snapped. Relief filled me as I proved to myself I hadn’t gone deaf. 

This went on for a long while as I continued to roam the interior. I kept filming anyway. That’s the job. The weirder it gets, the better the views. At least that’s what I kept telling myself. I even played it up for the camera- never squandering an opportunity, I suppose. But inwardly I was unsettled. It was as if the castle had taken a deep inhale and was now holding its breath, bracing in anticipation for some catastrophe.

It took me until the courtyard to notice it. An interruption. An exception to this all-consuming silence. Barely audible- a quiet whisper from behind a towering oak door. Someone was inside the chapel, whispering. 

I stood there a moment, listening.

At first, I thought it must be some trick of the acoustics. Old stone plays games with sound. But the more I focused, the clearer it became. A low, rasping whisper. Just one voice. Too soft to make out words, but with a rhythm. I thought maybe some monk or priest had stayed after closing and was praying. But it sounded desperate, like begging. 

I panned my camera to the chapel door, framing the shot steadily. I whispered some line I had been practicing for an occasion like this.

I couldn’t turn back, this was the money shot, and I hadn’t even fabricated it. Still, my legs were burning with vertigo. They wanted to run, yet I willed them forward. 

The key turned harder than I expected, the iron groaning in protest. The whispering stopped the moment the lock gave way- cut off mid-syllable, leaving a silence so thick I could hear my own pulse in my ears.

Hot, tepid air rushed past me as I forced the door open. It smelt like burnt insects. I called out to the source of the whispering, but there was no one. The room was abandoned. 

At this point, I wasn’t sure how much farther I could push my act, even for the camera. 

I was met only with the unwavering, judgmental gaze of the Archangel Michael. A fresco of his victory over some grotesque beast- I presumed the devil. His eyes were locked onto mine and I could feel…anger. Hatred, even. 

I was overwhelmed with panic- a sudden sense of dread and that I should not be here. I looked to Saint Michael’s feet, and there it was- a simple hole in the floor. Not particularly special or even eerie by itself- it resembled a well. That was what terrified me.

What did was the whispering that was drifting out of it. My first thought is that someone had fallen in, so I called out again. Again, the voice went silent. After an eternity, a weak voice answered me. A man was begging for help. 

I moved closer, camera shaking slightly in my hand.

It looked shallow at first, just a pit maybe four feet wide cut into the stone. But the light from my rig didn’t touch the bottom. The beam just vanished. Swallowed by black so dense it looked solid.

“Hello?” I called again, voice thin in the stale air.

Silence.

Then, after a long pause:

“Help me.”

Barely a whisper. Closer this time. Not echoing from deep below - as if the voice had risen partway up the shaft.

I felt sweat crawling down my back despite the cold.

I switched off my flashlight and switched my camera’s night vision on, aiming it down the hole. 

About 15 feet down, something was clawing its way up frantically. It’s hard for me to describe. At first, I thought it was a man. But it had a thorax like a horse fly or maybe a wasp. The thing was wiry, bent, crawling hand-over-hand. And it buzzed. An awful noise worse than any cicada. What I remember clearly are its eyes. I won’t ever forget them, all of them stared beyond my flesh, into my inner being. Thousands of human eyes, of every color, clustered into two groups.



They weren’t blinking. They weren’t even moving. Just staring - locked onto me like they’d known I was coming. Like they’d been waiting.

Like a grasshopper, it leaped out of the pit and clung to the wall, still staring. It’s buzzing flooded the room, in a deafening shriek, 

“Help me.”

I ran for the door, but it was faster. It leapt again, just barely missing my torso. It knocked my recorder to the floor, but I was beyond caring about any paycheck. I slammed the door shut behind me and fumbled with the key. All the while, the monster banged against the door, threatening to throw me to the floor from its sheer force. 

The key wouldn’t turn.

My hands were slick with sweat, shaking so hard I could barely grip it. Behind the door, the banging grew frantic - each impact rattling the ancient wood, dust falling from the frame.

THUD. THUD. THUD.

The force of it was getting stronger. I could hear the buzzing bleeding through the cracks now, a sound that felt like it was drilling into my skull.

“Help me.”

And then it stopped.

Silence.

I pressed my back to the wall, chest heaving, waiting for the next hit - but it didn’t come.

Instead, through the gap beneath the door, a thin stream of that awful buzzing bled out into the hall. Not words - not anymore. Just sound, cycling higher and higher until it felt like it was burrowing into my teeth, my skull.

Then, slowly, the buzzing faded - like whatever was behind the door had simply lost interest. Or moved on.

I didn’t wait to find out which.

The rest of my night was spent running to my car, driving to the airport, and buying the first ticket home I could. 

I left all my equipment behind, including the footage. For all I know it’s still there, feel free to go check. 

I expected this to be a victory, nonetheless. I had finally found what I was looking for- proof of the supernatural. That my grandfather’s stories had some magic to them- that there was something beyond what I could see. 

I was wrong. My disbelief made me feel untouchable. And now something had seen me. Something knows of me. I know it saw me- who I am, what I fear and what I believe. 

I’m afraid I’ve given it power over me. That it knowing about me is enough for something awful. 

Every so often I can still hear that awful buzzing- distant and quiet, but unmistakable. 

I would give anything to be a cynic again. To have no faith in anything, no belief. It was so much easier when there was nothing.
