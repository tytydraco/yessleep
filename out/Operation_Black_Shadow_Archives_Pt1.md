“Fuck I really hope this stupid ass thing works, My name is **[REDACTED]** of the Canadian Armes Forces. We were sent to **[REDACTED]** about 3 days ago to undergo the arrest and hunting down of something. It’s currently the 22nd of September, 2022. I still have no idea what we are hunting down but it’s strong, super strong. Even our guns can’t hurt it, hell we had a plane gun run on it and nothing happened. It’s untrackable, our thermals can’t see it, nothing can. It’s like it’s cold blooded. We are about to go to its site **[REDACTED]** in order to attempt hunting it down, im going with 82 men including me. I’ll log my way as I go about it, I really have a bad feeling about this though. Even the Americans couldn’t deal with it. Article 5 was engaged after whatever the fuck we are dealing with  attacked Europe, it fucking rampaged so many countries whatever it was, it killed whats estimates as 10,667,821 people so far. Started in the north of Norway. It appeared and apparently a 113 call went through. All the operator heard was screaming and scratching then the sound of jumping and finally the breaking of some glass. When the Norwegian Armed Forces went into check what happened they called the US right away and 1,500 troops were deployed in Oslo. No one knew what was happening. This all happened on the 2nd of July, 2022. 2 days later on the 4th chaos struck. Whatever is attacking us attacked Kristianstuyd, Alesund, Bergen, Kristiansand and Oslo in the exact same day. Wiping out all of Kristianstuyd and Alesund then about half of Kristiansand and Oslo. This is when the Norwegian Government engaged Article 5. Then it struck Norway. Sgt **[REDACTED]** was present there, here is the recording”
