  
Back in the winter of 2005, I was a junior in high school living in a small town in upstate New York. That year, we were hit with a massive snowstorm that seemed to come out of nowhere. It started as a light flurry on a Friday morning and escalated into a full-blown blizzard by nightfall. The school called for an early dismissal, and I was glad to escape into the warmth of home.

The snow piled up quickly, blanketing everything in an eerie white. By Saturday morning, the streets were buried, and the power was out. We had a wood stove, so my family and I huddled together, playing board games and telling stories to pass the time. Outside, the world was a winter wonderland, but something felt off.

By Sunday, the storm had settled, and I decided to venture outside. The silence was suffocating; not even the sound of birds could be heard. I took my sled to the nearby hill and enjoyed a few runs, but after an hour, I started to notice strange tracks in the snow. They didn’t look like animal prints; they were too large, too human-like, but distorted—almost as if something had dragged itself across the surface.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I followed the tracks. They led deeper into the woods, where the trees stood tall and ominous, their branches heavy with snow. I was hesitant, but something compelled me to continue. The tracks twisted and turned, leading me to a small clearing I’d never seen before.

In the center was an old, decrepit shed, half-buried in snow. The door was slightly ajar, and I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the cold. As I approached, I heard a low, guttural sound, like someone—or something—struggling to breathe. I hesitated, but the curiosity gnawed at me.

Pushing the door open, I stepped inside. The darkness swallowed me, but I could just make out the shape of a figure huddled in the corner. It was human, but twisted, covered in dirt and frost. Its eyes glinted in the darkness, filled with a hollow desperation.

I backed away slowly, but it let out a raspy whisper, “Help me.” The voice was faint, almost like it was pleading from a great distance. My heart raced as I turned to run, but before I reached the door, the figure lurched forward, revealing a mouthful of jagged teeth.

I bolted out of the shed, the tracks now a blur as I raced back home, my mind spinning with terror. I stumbled into the house, breathless, and locked the door behind me. I told my family what I saw, but they just laughed, thinking it was the cabin fever getting to me.

The next day, the storm finally broke, but the unease lingered. A few days later, I learned that a man had gone missing in the woods—a local with a history of mental health issues. They found his body a week later, frozen near the very shed I had stumbled upon.

As the authorities closed off the area, I couldn't shake the feeling that whatever I saw that day was connected to him. I still wonder about that twisted figure. Was it really him, or something far worse?

Now, every winter, I remember that dark, frozen horror, and I avoid the woods like the plague. But I know I can’t escape the snow forever. Sometimes, I think I hear whispers in the wind, calling me back to that clearing, beckoning me to join them in the silence.
