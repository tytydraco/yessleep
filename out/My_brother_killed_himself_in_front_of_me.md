I am a 19 and im a Male, me and my brother are very close and he’s 4 years older. Me and my brother both loved hunting, my brother learned how to hunt from our dad, and I learned to hunt from my brother. One day when I was 15, my brother and dad went hunting. They had what they called there “sweet spot for shooting” in a special part of the woods. They’d only spend around 5 hours hunting deers but most of the deer were eaten because of the massive amount of wolves in the area. But my brother and dads sweet spot had close to no wolves. So most deer would still be alive until they’d shoot them. But back to the day I was talking about when I was 15. 

They went to their usual spot but this time they had been there for 8 hours instead of 5. My brother had came home after 8 hours covered in blood and my dad was no where to be seen. He had told us that a creature had a attacked them. He explained it my being a talk creature about 8 feet tall with pale skin and long claws 7 inch claws. When they first heard it they thought it was a young wolf having problems howling. When I first heard of the wolf having problems howling I told him “but there most likely isn’t any wolves around the area?” He told me “yes I know but we had forgotten” he then explains that the creature had gotten my dad. 

He then went to the cops and since he was covered in blood my dads blood, the cops blamed him for his death. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of my dad. 1 month ago he was released due to false charges. 1 week ago we went camping to the same area that my dad had been killed by that creature, I’m pretty sure he had forgotten about that because there’s no way he’d return to the exact area where he saw that creature.    We planned on staying for 2 days so that he can spend sometime outside with no electronics since he was behind bars for 4 years. 

On the first day we made a campfire and we were catching up. When it got dark I assumed it was around 12-2am when we heard that creature. It was the loudest screech I had ever heard. I felt like my eardrums were gonna burst. Until it suddenly stopped. I look at my brother and I stared into his eyes, he was pale and his eyes were wide, he had his hand on his gun, I assumed he would use it against the creature, but instead he pointed the gun to his heard, he stared at me for the longest 10 seconds of my life. He then murmured the words “I’m sorry” I then tackled him to the ground stopping him from killing himself until he told me “run” and the he finally pulled the trigger.
