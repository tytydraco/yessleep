I was inside helping my brother with his homework when my father asked me if I could help him with decorations for Christmas. I started begging him not to make me go outside. 

The night before I had been watching the news and I saw an ice cream truck on the news that was in my town and I heard how it has been kidnapping kids. I told my father about it and he told me it was just a silly little thing I dreamt of. I asked him “please don’t let me go outside.” He told me I would be going outside whether I liked it or not.

My father tells me to put on my coat and a thicker pair of trousers, because “the cold would be biting you if you didn’t wear them“ even in the house was freezing. It was -57°C after all.

So I’m outside and I’m helping my dad put the lights up for Christmas and we’ve gotten through about 1/3 of the lights and I hear an ice cream truck. I told my dad that I heard an ice cream truck and I didn’t really feel safe outside and he told me I was just being silly.

I heard the ice cream truck go round and round my neighborhood, almost as if it was circling my house. It was so loud and so quiet all at the same time. I asked him if I could go inside, and he told me no and it’s just my imagination, he couldn’t hear it so he thought I was just messing with him.

I kept hearing the tune repeated over and over. It would stop, then it would start again, starting from the beginning, stopping midway through, stopping at the end of the song, and starting in the middle of the song it really fucked with my head. Those things are fucking repetitive, and then repeating the same parts just made it so much worse.

Then started thinking of how lovely would be to have ice cream, it’s only -57°C. I start telling my father that I’m too sleepy to keep going and I need to go inside he gets angry, but he eventually lets me go in. But I just cannot stop thinking about this ice cream truck. It still felt like it was circling my head. I went to school and I thought about this ice cream truck, I went to sleep that day thinking about this ice cream truck, in my dreams I was thinking of this ice cream truck. Why was this so significant?

Eventually, thinking turns into hearing and I start hearing the ice cream truck circle my house when I’m asleep and I start hearing it at school and it actually freaks me the fuck out. I brought it up to my friend and she said that she had been hearing it too, but didn’t want to bring it up to anyone because she thought that she was going crazy. This repeat of hearing the ice cream truck circle my school in my house and while I was sleeping, went on for another week. 

A week after my friend started hearing it, she disappeared. 

I wasn’t really disappointed or sad, and I didn’t really feel much emotion. I actually started liking the feeling knowing she’s gone that could be me. I didn’t wonder what happens inside the ice cream truck and what the ice cream tastes like. 

I plan to ice buy ice cream and see what it’s like sneak out at 12 AM. Wanna hear the ice cream truck the loudest that it’s ever been and I look all up and down my street but I don’t see it. hesitantly, take one step out of the street and instantly feel 20° colder. Gives me a burst of energy. Almost like the cold helped me, or maybe to sabotage me.

I take 10 more steps in a car drive by it almost hits me and I like that feeling. I like that feeling of adrenaline running through my body. I quickly start running as fast as I can towards the sound, and it suddenly stops and then starts right behind me.

I got so scared, I could’ve flown to the moon by how high I jumped. Weirdly, I like that, feeling knowing what I was about to die, or I could’ve died. Maybe a different life I would’ve died. I turned around to see a bright, smiling face staring directly at me. In a shaky voice, I asked him if I could have an ice cream bar.

The thing looks at me and it’s face crumbled off. It tried to pick up all the pieces of his face and stick it back on. I scream in horror. I scream at the top of my lungs “what the fuck are you!“ 

That only made it smile brighter.

As all of its skin crumbled off its body and gesture towards the back. Wanted me to go into the back and grab it myself. Just wanted to try this ice cream so I followed it.

I slowly followed behind it, and it took me to a freezer with a stainless steel door, almost like a one that you would have in your house. I give the thing my money and it gives me an ice cream bar, but the top is red. The middle is flesh colored, and the bottom is also red.

I take a bite and I immediately start to feel drowsy.

I asked the thing what was in the ice cream sandwich, and it shrugged its shoulders. I could now see what the bones and muscles. 

The last thing I saw before I passed out was the freezer door closing on me.

I woke up in the freezer when this thing opened the door, presumably in a warehouse. it dragged me out, and I saw more things like it some head hair. Some had only three strands somewhere bald some had no scalp, some head bones sticking out some had too much hair to where it was growing from their eyes. 

I felt so excited.

I think got dragged to a white room with one single table and cleaver length directly in the middle. There was the typical mental hospital padding all over. They placed me on the table, grabbing the cleaver.

One of the things asked me what my last words were, and I said

“Last words? What are yours”
