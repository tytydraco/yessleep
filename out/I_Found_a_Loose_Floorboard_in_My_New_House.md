When I first bought the house, I thought I’d gotten the deal of a lifetime. It was a three-bedroom Victorian for under $200k? I knew it needed work because it had peeling paint, rotting porch, that kind of thing—but I was ready for a project that would be able to fill a lot of my time. I’d just got out of a long relationship and wanted somewhere quiet, a place where I could hear my very own thoughts. The house sat on the edge of town, past the very last streetlight, where the paved road crumbled into gravel and the cell service dropped to almost zero bars. There were tall trees with thick trunks and moss that hung like curtains. The real estate agent warned me that the neighbors weren’t close by, but I was cool with that.

It wasn’t until my third night that I noticed the floorboard.

I’d just finished dragging boxes into the upstairs bedroom, the one with the slanted ceiling and that weird scorch mark near the closet—when I stepped wrong. The board creaked, not unusual in an old house, but then it shifted. Not just a groan, but a definite, loose give, like something beneath it had moved. I crouched down, ran my hand over it, and sure enough: the edge of the board lifted with almost no effort. Beneath the board was darkness—at first. I used my phone’s flashlight, the only thing that still had a flicker of battery and pointed it down. There was a hole. Not huge, but big enough to fit through if I squeeze. What I expected to find under there, I’m not sure. Old wiring? A forgotten crawlspace? But what I didn’t expect was the stairs. Wooden, narrow, and steep, they disappeared into the black like the inside of a throat.

I should’ve stopped there. But I didn’t.

With a deep breath and the kind of curiosity that feels a lot like fear wearing a mask, I lowered myself in. The smell hit first—damp earth and something older, like rust or mold. Maybe both. The stairs ended in packed dirt, and my light flicked across curved stone walls, rough and cold. This wasn’t a crawlspace. It was a tunnel. And not just a random animal-burrow or storm drain. The walls had markings—scratches at first glance, but as I moved closer, 

I saw numbers. House numbers.

The house numbers were carved into the stone. One read 1745, another 1773, and farther along, 1812. The numbers did not seem to be listed in order. It looked like someone had etched them with a knife across the span of several years. It not take long for me to realize that the numbers matched houses in the neighborhood. I remembered a creepy blue house with boarded-up windows. I was almost sure it had been 

1812 Birch Lane.

The tunnel forked ahead, snaking left and right. At the split, someone had scrawled something in red chalk:

“We don’t all make it back.”

My hand was shaking now. The air was colder. I turned to leave, but just as I did, I heard something.

Not footsteps. Not exactly.

Just the faintest sound of breathing.

It was coming from one of the tunnels.

As time went on it seemed the tunnel was closing in on me. The air was also growing thicker with every second that passed. I had to get out of the tunnels. But I also just wanted to stay just a little bit longer.

I turned my light towards the left tunnel, where the breathing seemed to be coming from. The darkness swallowed the beam, revealing nothing but more stone and dirt. It was at that point I realized that the dirt I was looking at looked like a type of dirt I had ever seen before. The color of the dirt just did not look right. I am colorblind, but if I had to guess, I am pretty sure the color of the dirt was pink.

The walls seemed to pulse, the numbers etched into the stone appearing to glow faintly in the dim light. The numbers felt warm to touch as if they were all alive.

A bunch of whispers echoed through the tunnel and I could barely make them out. When I first heard the whispers they almost made me jump. I could have sworn they were saying "help us," with fear and desperation. The breathing eventually stopped and was replaced by an eerie silence that I thought felt even more oppressive.

I went to leave, but as I reached the stairs, I felt a presence behind me. I spun around, my flashlight revealing a figure standing at the fork in the tunnel. It was tall, its form shrouded in darkness. I was unable to make out any features, but its gaze pierced through me.

"Who are you?" 

I managed to whisper, my voice shaking. The figure didn't respond, but I knew its intent. It wanted me to follow it. For some reason I took a step towards it. The figure turned and began to move down the right tunnel.

The tunnel seemed to stretch on forever, 

the walls closed in tighter with each step. 

The figure led me to a small chamber. 

The air there was thick with the scent of earth and decay. 

In the center of the room was an altar made of stone that was covered in dust and cobwebs.

The figure pointed its skeletal hand to the altar. 

I approached it and my flashlight revealed a small, leather-bound book resting on the stone. I picked it up and noticed that the cover of the book was worn and fragile. 

After opening the book I found handwritten notes and sketches. One of the sketches I found looked to be an exact drawing of the figure I saw.

The first page read: "To those who find this, beware. The tunnels are not what they seem. They are a gateway, a passage to a place where time and reality blur. Many have entered; few have returned. If you value your life, leave now."

I looked up, the figure was gone. 

The chamber felt colder, the air heavier. 

I knew I had to leave, 

but the book held lots of information that I could not ignore. I tucked the book under my arm and turned to retrace my steps.



The tunnel seemed darker, the walls closer. 

The numbers glowed faintly. 

I went back to the stairs. 

As I climbed, the breathing returned, louder and more frantic.



I slammed the board back into place, my heart racing. The house felt different now, the air charged with an unsettling energy. I knew the tunnels held secrets, and I had only scratched the surface. But if there was one thing that was very clear: I was not alone in this house. There was also a chance that nobody living in the house had ever been alone.
