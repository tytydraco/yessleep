its hard to believe, and honestly.. i don't want to believe it.



august 21, 2023. 5:23 am.

I wake up with a groan as the loud buzzing comes from the clock next to me and rise so i can dress myself for work. 

going to bed at three and waking up this early. makes it hard.

the only thing i can think about is how exhausted i am... why do i have to wake up to early just to work at a grocery store? despite the annoyance i have, it doesn't matter. 

i brush my teeth and my hair, tired as i said earlier. 

my feet make a shuffling sound as i drag myself to the front door, i don't need to grab anything other than my keys... and my coat. 

i walk to the door with my very little things in hand and lock the door behind me, as i do every morning.. and make my way down the apartment stairs. 

i don't have the money for a car. but it's not like my job is far, so who cares?

as i make my way through the parking lot and to the sidewalk i pause... hearing a faint noise of shuffling in the long uncut grass. i think for a moment taking in every horror movie I've ever watched, i shouldn't turn around. but that's the only thing i want to do.. look for the person lurking. 

i turn my head for a swift moment, seeing nothing. 

great now I'm insane? maybe it's the loss of sleep getting to my head.. 

i continue my route to the sidewalk and start my gurney. i glance at my phone and look at the time.

august 21, 2023. 6:23 am.

my phone makes its way to my pocket and a sigh escapes my mouth. 

walking feels hard, like my leg's way tons. 

the gravel underneath my feet makes soft crunching noises.. but i come to a sudden stop as i hear the extra set of satisfying crunches coming from the ground.  and it feels like the bugs and the buzzing from the streetlight all stop, i know nothings there, like earlier its just my mind making up tricks, or.. or is it? 

my head snaps behind me and i examine the area, not a soul. 

i look at the ground seeing nothing, the stress rises and my blood settles.

I'm just tried. 

my brain is repeating that so i don't lose it.. and i begin walking,

I'm just tired.

the buzzing from the streetlight gets louder and my feet feel heavier. i decide to take a seat, i mean i need rest.

i sit on the poorly cut grass and take my phone out reading the news, scrolling. my phone seems to help a little anyway, i think and think for a moment.. before getting the feeling I'm being watched. i let my feet rise and i feel MUCH better. i need to get to work.. i need to get to work.

my legs start working their magic and i keep a move on it, my eyes explore the street..

my head tilts as i spot a person crossing the rode and walking in my direction, i pull my phone out and try ignoring the tall figure, but the voice of the stanger stops me, right as their face was going to be reviled in the streetlight.

"excuse me?.. could you tell me what day it is?"

i look at my phone and check it all. august 21, 2023. 6:23 am

"its.. its the 21st."

my voice cracks as if ive never spoken before and nod as i walk out of the light passing them. 

i look back once i made it the the third light and i look back, but theirs no sigh of them. not a soul in sight. i look around for a moment in udder shock and confusion. before looking forward seeing them again and my brain stops

"Excuse me?,, could you tell me what day it is?"

I'm just tired.

i keep walking looking at the ground eyes still wide from the repeat.

im just tired.

i finally make my last turn into the parking lot of the store and walk in, making my way to the back of the store to clock in,. normally noones here.. other than the night shifters.. but theres a tall lengthy woman in the frozen section.

i ignore the woman and clock in. 

walikng to the front and leaning on my aisle casher. and waving at the tired people, getting a little to no response 

the tall person from earlier still lingering in my mind as the tall woman came into my station and i look up at her.

"exuse me?.. could you tell me what day it is?"

i look at her wide eyed and i say

"im just tired."

my eyes stay on her as i say that and i snap out of it as somone comes up behind me putting a hand on my sholuder.

"arnt we all? anyway.. headin out see ya tomorrow!"

my eyes snap back to the woman but shes no wear to be seen.

im just tired.
