Then I saw him—Monroe, standing near the scarecrow, flanked by two of his men, their firearms pointed directly at me. One of his cronies stepped forward and yanked my revolver from my hand.

“So, you’ve come,” Monroe said at last, his voice unnervingly calm.

“What do you want?” I asked, looking at him.

He smiled and stepped closer. “I’ve been trying to figure out how your crops are thriving when they should be dead by now.”

“What’s your secret, Patrick? What kind of spell have you cast over this land?”

He bent down, grabbing a handful of soil, before letting it slip through his fingers.

"We tried everything—rodents, birds, aphids. And it was all working fine. They were destroying your crops and it was only a matter of time before they wiped everything out.”

“Then, one fine day, it all stopped. Just like that. Nothing touched your fields anymore. The pests either died or fled. It made no sense.”

Monroe’s smile disappeared, his eyes narrowing. “And that’s not even the worst part,” he growled, his gaze locking onto me with a menacing intensity.

“We even brought in a special breed of Asian locusts—known for devouring entire fields. Do you have any idea how difficult it was to transport them here?”

“And yet, they did nothing. Nothing! They simply vanished, along with the men I sent to release them.”

His frustration was palpable as he continued, “All of this made me wonder: what could poor son-of-soil Patrick have done that was so effective it thwarted all my efforts? I had to come see it for myself.”

I stayed silent, my eyes nervously shifting to the scarecrow looming behind him. But Monroe noticed.

“Is this what’s helping you?” he sneered, turning to face the scarecrow.

Without warning, he ripped the wooden pole from the ground and tossed it aside; the scarecrow landed in the dirt with a dull thud.

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning cracked across the sky, lighting up the field for a split second, followed by a deep rumble of thunder. But Monroe paid no heed to it.

 He simply pointed to the cans of pesticide his men had brought.

“Clearly, my men weren’t up to the task, so I’ve come to handle things personally. And I’m done waiting, Patrick. Done waiting for your farm to fold and your crops to wither away. I might as well take extreme measures to put this to rest once and for all,” he said coldly.

Panic surged through me as one of them opened the cans, ready to dump the poison onto my field. I lunged forward, trying to stop them, but the other crony grabbed me, pinning me to the ground.

Just as the man was about to pour the contents of the can, a strange noise echoed through the air—a distant, low hum that grew louder by the second.

Suddenly, a swarm of insects appeared, swirling in the night sky. Locusts. Hundreds of them. The very same ones Monroe had smuggled in to destroy my crops—only now, they were coming for him.

Monroe’s men shouted in panic as the locusts descended, attacking them with ferocity.

The swarm enveloped Monroe, crawling all over him, into his mouth, his nose. His men didn’t fare any better, choking and screaming as the locusts forced their way inside them.

The rain started to pour, pelting down hard, but the locusts didn’t stop.

I could only stare as Monroe’s body began to swell, his skin turning gray and lifeless. One by one, his men fell, their bodies bloated and drained, leaving nothing but swollen, lifeless husks in the downpour.

My eyes reluctantly gravitated towards the scarecrow lying on the ground, and it sent a chill through my veins that is hard to express. I immediately knew I now I had to get rid of it now. Things had gone too far.

But my body suffered another jolt when I saw Clara in the field a few feet behind me, drenched and staring in open-mouthed horror at the bodies lying on our farm.

She looked lost in thought, shock overwhelming her senses as she stood rooted to her spot.

 I had to physically guide her back to the house, even as she maintained a steadfast silence while trying to come to grips with what she had just witnessed.

After leading Clara back to the house, I quickly rummaged through the closet for warm clothes for both of us.

Once changed, I looked at her and said, “Stay here,” my voice steady. “I’ll be right back.”

I dashed back to the field where the bodies lay. The rain had stopped, but the ground was still muddy beneath my feet. With grim determination, I loaded the bodies into the van, forcing myself to look away from their faces. Next, I grabbed the scarecrow, its wooden frame feeling heavier than it should, and loaded it into the car. It had to go too.

Once everything was stowed away, I slid into the driver’s seat and sped away from the farm. Hours passed as I drove through the darkness until I found a secluded spot deep in the woods. I parked the van quietly and walked away, hitching a ride back home once I reached the highway.

By the time I reached the farm, morning light spilled across the landscape, and I was relieved to see Clara already up. She looked much better than the previous night, having recovered from the shock, but remained engrossed in a phone call. She didn’t hang up as I approached, so I sighed and headed to the fields to check on the crops. They appeared to be doing well, and I was glad to see there hadn’t been any further attacks since the previous night’s incidents.

I fell back into my usual farming routine, knowing that harvest was only a few days away. Yet Clara still wouldn’t talk to me. Something about the night had shaken her, and she spent hours on the phone with relatives, and would suddenly go silent whenever I got too close. I decided to give her some space, grateful she was at least alright and speaking with someone.

The following day, I finally understood when I saw a car pull up to the farm while I worked in the field. A few people stepped out and were greeted by Clara at the door. That was the first time since the incident that she looked me in the eye and asked me to come inside.

When I stepped inside, I was surprised to find Clara deep in conversation with an elderly woman dressed in unusual attire.

Clara’s eyes widened as I entered. “This is Naya,” she said, gesturing toward the woman. “She’s a shaman. She is here to help us.”

Naya looked to be in her early eighties, her posture straight and her sharp eyes fixed on me with a quiet, knowing gaze.

Her long, silver hair was tied back, adorned with small charms and feathers that swayed gently in the breeze.

Behind her, two young men, both tall and well-built, stood in silence. They wore simple tunics made from earth-colored cloth, barefoot with leather bands wrapped around their wrists and ankles.

One carried a small drum, the other, a pair of cymbals that gleamed under the fading light.

Naya slowly rose from her seat and approached me. “Come with me, Patrick,” she said, while gesturing at Clara and the kids to stay inside as she ambled out and headed toward the fields.

She walked to the spot where the scarecrow once stood rooted in the ground, scooping a handful of soil from around it. Holding the soil to her chest, she whispered a small prayer.

“Is this really necessary?” I asked, pointing to the empty ground. “I’ve already gotten rid of it.”

“Do you have anything that’s been passed down through generations?” she suddenly asked, ignoring my question. “It doesn’t need to be valuable like gold or silver, just something that’s been used extensively by your ancestors. Something that has stood the test of time. Something that has served your family well. Something…. that can act as a medium for your forefathers to come to your aid.”

I nodded in acknowledgment, though I was uncertain about where she was going with this.

“The scarecrow will return, Patrick. This isn’t the end—not by a long shot,” she added.

Seeing the confusion on my face, Naya sighed and continued speaking.

“Many years ago, a young boy found himself lost in the woods while playing with his friends. As night approached, he found himself alone and frightened, wandering deeper into the forest until he stumbled upon a pond. Exhausted and disoriented, he knelt to drink from the water but fell, cutting his forehead on the bank.

“When he looked at his reflection in the water, he saw a scarecrow hanging from a banyan tree above him. A voice suddenly spoke in his mind, offering to guide him home if he promised to return a favor when he was older. In his desperation, he agreed, and as blood from his left eyebrow mixed with the water, the voice assured him a promise had been made and that he would know when to repay.”

“Suddenly, a swarm of insects appeared in front of him, forming a path that led him safely back home.”

“Years later, the boy grew up, married, and held his newborn daughter for the first time. He noticed a small cut above her right eyebrow, an injury sustained during childbirth, and immediately understood the payment that was due.”

"Believing distance would keep his family safe, he moved to another state to start a new life. But during a visit to a local festival, something spooked him, and he urgently told his six-year-old daughter they needed to leave. On the way home, his car suddenly broke down, and as it began to rain, they were attacked by a swarm of aphids. He suffocated to death while his daughter watched helplessly from the seat beside him. It was Clara’s mother who eventually reached out to me for help."

“Do you now understand what Clara went through when she saw the same thing happen again in your farm after all these years?” she asked, after a pause looking at me. “That thing has some unfinished business with you and your family, Patrick,”

 I stood there, stunned by this revelation. I had known Clara’s father had died when she was young, but she had never shared the details. Now it made sense why I had felt immediately drawn to the scarecrow when I first saw it at the market.

My thoughts snapped back to the present when Naya gently pinched my arm, asking me to escort her back to the front of the house.

 Once back at the threshold, her eyes briefly closed as she murmured a soft prayer. She then uncorked a small bottle of rum, carefully pouring the alcohol in a slow circle in front of her. Her hands were weathered but steady as she whispered words of offering to the spirits. She then placed a handful of fresh wildflowers and dried tobacco leaves at the base of the doorway, each piece laid down with intent and care.

Once the offerings were set, Naya took a bundle of cedar, sage, and sweet grass from her leather pouch, lighting it with a single match. As smoke rose from the burning herbs, she began to wave a large owl feather, dispersing the thick, cleansing smoke across the entrance.

The rhythmic sound of the drum began behind her, a low, steady beat that matched the energy of her movement. The man with the cymbals joined as well, with each metallic clash, falling into perfect harmony with the beating drum.

Naya’s pace was slow, methodical, as she circled the house, the smoke trailing after her in lazy spirals. Her feather swept through the air, brushing along the walls and windows, sending the smoke into every crevice, every darkened corner.

The young men followed closely, their movements silent, their focus unwavering as the drumbeat and cymbals echoed softly through the quiet evening.

She next instructed me to retrieve the old object and place it on the front porch.

I brought out an old oil lantern that I had kept tucked away in a trunk. It had been passed down through my family for over four generations. Though weathered from years of use, the lantern was still in perfect working order.

Naya dispersed some of the smoke from her bundle of herbs over the lantern, and a few moments later, the ritual was complete.

Gripping my arm, Naya pulled me closer. “Listen carefully, Patrick. Your home is secure, and your family is safe as long as they remain inside.”

“Also, I don’t foresee any disturbances for the next six days—at least until the next new moon. But when that time comes, you need to be vigilant. Things will come to a head then Patrick. You must be ready to guard and protect your family.”

I nodded silently. “What do you think I should do?”

“I can’t answer that for you,” she replied, her gaze steady. “But I pray the spirits will guide you, and you’ll know what to do when the time is right.”

I felt a pit form in my stomach as I watched the Shaman climb back into her car and drive away slowly.  

I worried for the safety of my family. At that moment, I resolved myself to do whatever it took to keep Clara and the kids safe.

One small relief though was that the Shaman had chosen not to share the full details of our conversation with Clara or the children, sparing them from the looming dangers tied to the new moon.

In fact, Clara was even unaware of the scarecrow's influence. Her father had expressly forbidden her mother from revealing any details of his childhood that might involve it.

The only certainty Clara had was the attack of the insects that killed Mr. Monroe—an event she had witnessed first hand in her own childhood. This was why she wanted to ensure that a Shamanic ritual was conducted in our home, just as it had been done when she was a child to ward off any evil eyes.

This allowed me to maintain a semblance of normalcy as I returned to my farming routine, though I remained vigilant for any unusual occurrences. I also instructed my family to stay indoors after dark, forbidding them to leave the house until the harvest season was over.

Days blurred together as I kept my head down, tending to the fields while shadows of uncertainty crept closer with each sunset.

When I woke up on the sixth day, I was shocked to see the scarecrow back in the field, positioned exactly where I had first planted it. Just like how the Shaman had predicted. I didn’t understand how it managed to find its back to my farm but there it was, upright in its original spot.

Even from afar, its gaze seemed locked onto me, as if it were foretelling me what was to come.

Yet, for the first time, even as my heartbeat quickened, I felt an unexpected calm settle within me. A steely resolve began to take shape, ready to confront whatever lay ahead. I was determined to put an end to this once and for all.

I quickly entered the field to check on the crops, wanting to see how they were faring. Aside from the scarecrow's sudden reappearance, everything seemed normal—no dead animals littering the ground, which instantly brought me a modicum of relief. So I carried on with my day as usual.

When Clara noticed the scarecrow, I casually explained that I had put it back up after it had been lying idle in the barn since the rainy night with Mr. Monroe and his crew. She seemed satisfied with my answer, and we continued our work without further incident.

Evening came and went and we all ate our meal in silence. One by one, everyone retreated to their rooms while I remained vigilant.  

Once everyone was in bed, I grabbed my shotgun and crept up to the second floor, where I had a clear view of the entire field. I had already set up lights at the corners so that I had some visibility even on a new moon night.

 I positioned myself at the window, determined to stay awake through the night. Hours ticked by slowly. The only sounds were the faint whisper of the wind and the occasional creak of the old farmhouse settling around me.

My eyes eventually grew heavy, even as my body fought the exhaustion at every level.

But I must have drifted off at some point because when I opened my eyes again, I was startled by how still everything seemed.

I instinctively glanced out the window, expecting to see the familiar silhouette of the scarecrow standing in its usual spot. But it wasn’t there.

My heart leapt in my throat as I scanned the field, and then I saw it—moving. The scarecrow was moving.

Not walking, not stumbling, but drifting. It glided across the ground as if something unseen was pulling it, dragging it toward the far end of the field. Then it suddenly stopped, and to my horror, I saw the birds descend quietly around it.

My hands trembled as I bolted out of the chair, shotgun in one hand, and the old lantern in the other.

I didn’t wake Clara or the kids—I didn’t want to frighten them. But my pulse pounded in my ears as I sprinted into the field, the lantern swinging wildly in my arm.

 The scarecrow, now a distant silhouette, was still drifting, disappearing into the dark edges of the field.

I sprinted after it, the lantern's glow swinging wildly in the darkness. When I reached the spot, I nearly dropped it.

Dead animals lay scattered everywhere—birds, mice, frogs and even a rabbit—arranged in eerie, precise circles. The smell of decay clinging to the air.

Out of the corner of my eye, I then spotted it again: the scarecrow, this time drifting slowly toward the opposite end.

I ran toward it again, gripping my shotgun tightly as the lantern swayed in my hand and the wind howled around me.

But as I approached the scarecrow, I froze.

It wasn’t the scarecrow that terrified me.

It was Emma—my 12-year-old daughter—carrying the scarecrow as if it weighed nothing. The pole rested effortlessly on her small shoulder, her hands gripping it firmly yet without emotion.

Her movements were slow and mechanical, her eyes wide and blank, as if she were trapped in a trance.

Behind her, Luke knelt in the dirt, his small hands stained with blood. He was carefully arranging a sparrow’s body among the others, his face blank, his eyes unblinking. With a firm grip, he squeezed another rat’s neck until it went limp, then placed it on the ground, completing a circle of dead animals.

I immediately scanned the field looking for Clara, but she was nowhere in sight. And I realized she must still be in bed.

That was when I understood.

The scarecrow, he was coming for Clara by going after our kids!

A wave of dread rose in my chest as I choked out a call, my voice thick with fear. "Emma! Luke! What are you doing?!"

They didn’t respond. They didn’t even flinch. Emma kept walking, gripping the pole attached to the scarecrow and moving forward. Luke silently followed behind her.

Then Emma suddenly stopped. She raised the scarecrow and pointed it westward. And from the shadows animals suddenly emerged.

Birds swooped down from the trees, rodents scurried out of the soil, and insects crawled from every crevice, all of them moving toward the scarecrow with eerie obedience.

I could only watch in horror as Luke picked up a rock and began smashing the animals one by one.

Each brutal strike was met with a sickening thud, and yet none of the creatures moved—they remained rooted to their spots, oblivious to the carnage unfolding around them.

The air felt thick with something sinister, something beyond my understanding.

My chest tightened as I staggered back, gasping for air. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real.

Then Luke bent down, grabbed a dead rodent from the ground, and sank his teeth into it. He bit into the fur with the desperation of a ravenous animal, blood smearing his lips as he chewed, completely lost in the frenzy.

A wave of nausea washed over me as I realized how the scarecrow was controlling my children, transforming them into something unnatural, something monstrous.

A torrent of anger erupted inside me, every cell in my body pulsing with raw fury. My hands shook, but my mind was suddenly clear—I knew exactly what I had to do.

I dropped my lantern and rushed toward Emma, yanking the scarecrow from her hands and then hurling it to the ground.

My kids remained mute spectators, rooted to their spots as they continued to be trapped in their hypnotic trance.

I grabbed the lantern, and smashed it against the scarecrow with all my might.  It shattered on impact, igniting the scarecrow in flames. Without hesitation, I fired my shotgun at the fuel-soaked straw, and an explosion erupted, engulfing the figure in a fiery blaze.

Emma blinked for the first time, as if suddenly waking from a dream, confused about how she had ended up in the middle of the field. My son, Luke, stared down at his blood-stained hands, clutching the dead rat.

Horror washed over his face, his lip trembling as he met my eyes.

“I didn’t mean to, Daddy... I didn’t mean to...” he sobbed, wiping the blood from his mouth with the back of his hand.

I dropped to my knees, pulling both of them into my arms, as the fire crackled and roared, the acrid smell of burning straw filling the air. Through the flames, I watched a shadowy figure emerge, its silhouette shaped like a man, writhing and twisting, struggling to break free. For a fleeting moment, it seemed almost alive, thrashing in a desperate attempt to escape the flames. But the fires consumed him, pulling him deeper into the inferno until, at last, he vanished. I closed my eyes briefly, using the moment to utter a silent prayer to the Lord, hugging my children tighter, grateful that it was finally behind us.

Together, we slowly walked back to the house, each step laden with the weight of what had just transpired.

Just as we were about to enter the house, Clara opened the door, worry etched across her face. She had woken up sensing something was wrong, and when she found us missing, fear gripped her.

As we stepped inside, she wrapped us in a warm embrace. I immediately felt a sense of relief, hoping that this whole nightmare was finally behind us.

Over the next few weeks, my crops flourished, yielding a harvest that far exceeded my expectations. We were pulled back from the brink of financial ruin, but it came at a cost.

Both Emma and Luke suffered from relentless nightmares, waking up screaming in the night, and it would be months before they could fully recover. I, too, struggled with sleep, waking in the dead of night, drenched in sweat, haunted by the memory of the scarecrow.

“It’s gone,” I kept telling myself. “The scarecrow is gone.”

And every night, I prayed that it would stay that way.
