Whenever I see a piano, I can’t help but to sit down and play it. The older it is and the more out of tune, the better. There’s a certain quality to the sound that makes each one unique. You can’t bend notes or create a different texture like you can on a guitar, but an old piano has a spirit about it, effects not created with electrical pedals or technique but built into the soul of the instrument. A history of pounding emotion, and maybe even a little bit of neglect evolving the timbre to a haunting inescapable quality. An old piano absorbs the character of its owner, some more than others, depending on the intensity of the musician, or the madness thereof.

On one such occasion I was lured to a piano that could do more than play a melody. Janice Algood, an acquaintance from school, suddenly took an interest in becoming my friend. Her tone was obsessive, and her demeanor belied her disdain for any of my interests and hobbies, except for the fact that I knew how to play piano. In fact, it was her only interest, her solitary source of conversation.

“What’s the most difficult song you can play?”

“I’m not that good,” I would explain.

“But maybe you’re good enough. When the time is right, I want you to play a song for me.”

“When the time is right? Give me the music and I’ll see if I can play it. You can come over my house after school.”

“No, you can only play it in one place and one place only.”

This same conversation occurred on a regular basis without much variation. I grew tired of it and tried on multiple occasions to talk about something else. Her unwavering focus was both unsettling and tiresome. Finally, she decided to come to my house. I was excited, for although her personality was unabashedly myopic, she was stunning, beautiful in every aspect, a creature without flaw.

Her visit was without excitement of course and in due time I relished the hour she would exit through the front door. We talked of nothing but playing the piano. When I finally convinced her to let me play the piano it felt more like a tryout than a performance.

“Your timing could be better. Could you play that part over, but this time hold the b flat for effect? Yes, I like that. No, do this and do that.”

It drove me insane. I was too passive, to enamored, to tell her that I was tired of playing piano. All night I practiced under the strict, harsh badgering of a demanding tutor, one that I never even imagined played any sort of instrument. And then, my alarm rang.

“Is it six? Time for school already?”

“No silly. It’s Saturday. We’ve been practicing since Thursday.”

I could fathom playing through the night and losing track of time but playing through an entire day, with the sun coming up and going down again? My mom wouldn’t let me miss school. No, she was out of her mind. I walked over to the television and turned it on. Sure enough, the Saturday cartoons were on.

“I told you. Hey,” she said as she opened the front door, “I want to take you somewhere tonight. A date. It’ll be fun.” She smiled, turned, and walked out the door, without waiting for a response, knowing that I wouldn’t refuse.

I was exhausted and slept throughout the day. It was a fitful sleep, littered with episodic nightmares of hellish creatures and murderous villains, killing and torturing souls while dancing to a boy playing a giant grand piano, a boy who looked like me except for his scalded, bald head.

The doorbell rang at eight o’clock. It was her, dressed in a long black dress with a purple shawl thrown around her shoulders.

“Come on silly.” I followed like an obedient puppy, ever faithful to my master’s demands. We meandered through numerous roads until we came upon a dead-end. A creek marked the boundary between the old neighborhood and the new one in the midst of construction. There was a wide flattened dirt path torn through the trees for about fifty feet and then an untouched swath of forest ahead and on both sides. A bulldozer and an excavator were parked on either side, rusty sentries standing ready to extrude civilization from the earth.

We crossed the creek and made our way up the path until it ended. She then turned left and pushed through the thick brush. I lost sight of her and hurried past the briars, cutting myself across my arms as I pushed through to a clearing on the other side. There was an open field with a small sloping hill and on top was a large two-story, Federal style brick house. All the windows were shattered or missing except for one small attic window that glinted in the full moon light. The chimney on the side of the house was partially collapsed and charred as if there had been an explosion.

Janice was on the front porch. I felt alone and exposed to danger, yet I was hesitant to move towards the house. There was a foreboding presence, an ambiguous evil either exuding from the house, or from Janice. She motioned for me to follow, and in an instance her beauty enveloped my mind, possessed it and moved me away from apprehension. I started to walk towards the house, and as I did so she disappeared through the front door.

I found myself in a drawing room with antique furniture, including a massive curio cabinet filled with statuettes posed in various states of fear, some screaming, some hiding, and some weeping, but without a doubt, all of them had seen something terrifying. Numerous brass candelabras were hanging on the walls, the lit candles flickering against the mild wind coming through the fireplace at the front of the room. Adjacent to the fireplace stood an old upright piano.

Janice seemed to materialize from the corner of the room. She walked over to the piano and put a large candelabra on the piano. The unlit candles erupted in flames and then settled down to a hypnotic sway. The temperature of the room was chaotic, both cold from the open fireplace and hot from all the candles. The smell of melted wax and smoke was thick and nauseous, the scent far from aromatic. It wasn’t pumpkin spice nor vanilla, but more akin to mildew and rot set on fire, if such a thing were possible.

She fumbled through the piano sheet and pulled out a single sheet of music. With the utmost respect and care, she leaned the sheet music against the stand.

“Come, sit and play.”

I sat down and perused the music. It didn’t seem too difficult, some fingering I wasn’t too familiar with, and the notes a little difficult to discern. The paper was yellow with age. The musical staff was a faded black, but the notes were in thick red ink.  It was a short piece I knew I could master if I could figure out where the notes were on the staff. If I played through a couple of times, I was certain Janice would correct me.

I started playing, fumbling through, making a plethora of mistakes. I was disappointed in myself, but Janice didn’t say a word. I kept playing through the errors, coming back to the top of the score after playing the last measure. The melody was haunting and sad, but mesmerizing. My spirit was enmeshed in a mystical pain, a suffering in the heart that induced a severe feeling of fear and loss. I wanted to stop playing, but I felt possessed as if someone else was in me playing through my hands.

I played the music several times, immersed so deeply into the melody that I had forgotten about Janice until I heard a deep, long moan, hoarse and dry like a man. I looked over, my hands playing unattached to my consciousness, pounding on the keys violently without my consent, and saw Janice levitating high in the air. She was looking up at the ceiling, her arms held out wide, still moaning, as if in excruciating pain. I tried to pull away, but I couldn’t. Some force had a hold of me. The tempo increased; the pitch bent low as I pressed each key. The former melancholy had transformed into a furious and angry timbre. The notes were now a hateful chant, a shamanistic journey into Hell.

Now I couldn’t look away from Janice, my head forced in one direction. She quickly looked down at me, her eyes white, and her face contorted in a menacing grin. She laughed and began descending. When her feet touched the floor, her head shook from side-to-side. The top of her skull split open and peeled apart. Her skin folded away from her body on either side. Beneath what used to be Janice was a man covered in blood, slowly exposed by the peeling away of her skin.

The man pulled the rest of Janice’s stubborn skin away from his arms and legs. He stepped away from the pulp of flesh on the floor and made his way towards me. I was still trapped in the melody, unable to get up and run. The man came closer into the light, his nudity covered in blood, his identity unknown. He wiped his face clean. My heart raced, my stomach churned, as I stared back at my own face, the only difference was the white of his eyes. He walked over to the curio cabinet, looking with pleasure upon the collection of statuettes frozen in fear. After some time, he turned, walked over to me and touched me on the shoulder. His body dissipated and I felt an invasion of my mind, another being lodged in my thoughts.

My hands were freed from the keyboard, my will once again my own. I jumped out of the seat and ran out the door. I don’t remember the journey home. That vision was stuck in my head. The levitation, the stripping away of Janice, and then my own devilish walking towards me. I didn’t see the path in front of me, nor remember walking through my front door. I only remember waking up the next morning, seeing a figurine of Janice on my desk, on her knees, with a plea on her face for mercy. I took it and threw it in a dumpster, but eventually it appeared again. It always does. I have given up on ridding myself of Janice. I can accept that. I just wish I could get that melody out of my head and the thought that one day, he’ll tire of me as well.
