“Daniel, you’re okay.
You’re okay.
Please—you’re okay.
This isn’t you. Your thoughts aren’t you.
Happy place. Happy place.
Bagels. Sweet potatoes. Garden.”

“This dirty, useless waste of space. What a failure. He has everything handed to him and he still messes it up. Mom should’ve shoved him back up. He makes me sick. Less than human garbage. I should just—“

“No.
What am I thinking?”

“I know I fucked up, Daniel,” Angel said breaking me free from thought. He was scratching at his arm like he wanted to peel himself open. “It won’t happen again. I just… I really needed it this time. You don’t understand how hard it is.”

I didn’t respond. I wasn’t listening. I’d heard it all before.

This wasn’t the first relapse. It wouldn’t be the last. Everyone—especially me—was exhausted by his apologies.

“You need to go before Cindy gets home from school. I don’t want her seeing you like this. Go to Unc’s.”
I shut the door before he could say another word.

I stood there, still. Processing. I could feel him standing on the other side of the door, too, like his shadow had seeped through the wood. Waiting. Hoping.

Eventually, he left. I felt it like a chill lifting.

I’ve always had these thoughts. Sudden, violent things that crash into my brain like a car through glass. Things no normal person should think. Hate that doesn’t feel like it belongs to me…

Sometimes I wonder if they come from somewhere else. Either way they’re never pleasant, and it’s very draining. 

I went back to sit down amid the mess in the living room.  I looked at all the papers scattered about and the broken glass from my new wine cups laying near my coffee table. Red stains covering my new carpet. 

“Great. more work. I’ll have to get this cleaned up quick.” I thought to myself. 

Cindy would be home in less than an hour. Ever since her mom left us I’ve tried my very best to give her a normal life, something I never had. And it gets increasingly harder when things like this happen. 

An hour later Cindy got home, she walked in cheerfully. “Hey dad” she quipped as she threw her bag on the couch and slouched down. “ hey sweetie, how was your day” I asked trying to seem normal. 

“It was okay, but like soooo boring. I can’t stand this new teacher. He’s like a goof fr.” 

“What new teacher?” I inquired

“Mr Johnson, he’s replacing Ms Steven’s our math teacher.” She said

“What happened to her? “

“Idk, quit probably. She was really going through it with the divorce and all”

“That’s rough baby—what do you want for dinner? “ I asked straying the conversation away from soemthing heavy. 

“Chicken Alfredooooooo” she sang out with a grin. 

“Of course baby”  
I walked into the kitchen and started cooking. We had a peaceful dinner and went to bed without a hitch. 

The next morning before I could get ready for work I got a call from my uncle. 

“Daniel you need to get over here right now.” 
“What happe-“

“NOW. You need to come NOW” his voice cracked like something inside him had already broken.

He hung up and I rushed to my car to drive over since he only lived 3 minutes away. I didn’t know what to expect, but not this. definitely not this. 

Uncle Joe’s front door was cracked open when I arrived. 

I pushed it wide and stepped into chaos. Furniture overturned, a lamp shattered on the floor. Glass smothering the middle of the living room. There was blood—just a little—on the tile. A thin red smear on the wall. 

“Joe?” I called out.

A grunt answered from the back room.

I found him slumped in his recliner, pale, holding a dish towel to his side. Blood soaked through it.

“What the hell happened?” I rushed to him.

“Your damn brother,” he wheezed, half-laughing, half-wincing. “Came in screaming, tore up the place. I tried to calm him down. He shoved me. I lost my balance and fell into the glass table.”

“Where is he?” My fists clenched before I could stop them.

Joe motioned toward the garage. “Out there. Said he needed air. Or to scream. One of the two.”

I made it halfway across the living room when I heard the garage door creak open.

Angel stepped in, shirtless, breathing hard, sweat glistening off his face. His pupils were blown wide.

“Danny,” he smiled. “Man, I didn’t think you’d come.” He said as if he were greeting me at a bar. 

“You hurt Joe.” I shouted

“He’s fine,” he said. “He’s tougher than he looks. You’re mad, I get it. But this—this ain’t all my fault.”

“You always say that.” My eyes beaming through him. 

He paced a bit, ran a hand through his hair. “You know what’s crazy? I came here trying to get clean again. I thought maybe I could fix things. But then he started preaching at me. Talking about Cindy  and Jeffie like they’re some sort of angels. She’s not. He’s not. None of us are.”

“Don’t you dare bring up my daughter.” 

“I was just saying,” Angel shrugged. “She’s gonna find out what the world’s really like someday. I mean, you did. Remember what dad used to do when you cried? You remember, right?”

My stomach dropped.

Angel stepped closer. “I always figured you buried it. But I didn’t. I remembered everything. I just… handled it differently.” His breath stank of liquor and sin. 

I stared at him. “What are you talking about?”

“That neighbor’s kid when I was thirteen—Peter?” His voice was calm now, but slightly slurred. “I did to him what dad did to me. Only once. I swear. But… it felt like balance. You know? Like I got to put it somewhere. Like it wasn’t just us anymore.” 

The room turned to static.

“I always thought maybe you’d get it one day. That you’d break, like me. Then maybe we’d finally be brothers again.” He said unnervingly 

I took a step forward. He didn’t move.

“I should’ve left you in that bathroom years ago,” I said through gritted teeth.

Then from behind us: a cough, a weak gasp.

We turned. Uncle Joe was leaning forward in the recliner, clutching his chest, eyes wide in panic.

“Joe?” I rushed over, dropped to my knees. “Unc? Hey. Look at me.”

He opened his mouth but no sound came out. His lips were blue.

Angel stood behind me, frozen. “He was just talking ten minutes ago…” he croaked softly

I felt for a pulse. Nothing.

“Call 911!” I snapped.

But I already knew. His skin was cooling. His eyes were glassy.

He was gone.

And the moment my brain accepted it, the voice came back.
Clearer this time. Not like a thought.

More like… a soft whisper in my ear.

“I knew it , I knew it , I knew it. I should just get rid of him. Good for nothing trash. You deserve to suffer. You deserve what dad did to you.  Everywhere you go you ruin everything. You’re poison. Unclean filth. I can’t stand you. I hate you. I hate you so much. You remind me of dad. You deserve what I’m going—“

“Do you want to follow the ambulance to the hospital sir? “  an Officer asked me as I stood by in a trance watching EMT load my uncle’s body bag. 

“I..uh yes.” I replied 

“I’m sorry about your loss son. You could probably use these.” The officer said warmly as he handed me a pamphlet full of resources to help with the passing of a loved one. 

“Thank you.” I said emptily. Crumpling the pamphlet. 


The next few days were chaotic and melancholic all the same. Angel ran before the cops came, but they caught him the next day. They brought him in for questioning and then let him go from inconclusive evidence. Go figure, this is what passes as justice these days. I had to take over the arrangements for the funeral and informing the rest of the family about it. The funeral came and went as if it was just another day for everyone. I tried to stay grounded as my thoughts were running a thousand miles a minute. Cindy was what kept me from going insane. Her cute reassuring smile could disarm a crazed gunman. 

A week went by before I saw Angel again. By that time I sent Cindy to stay with her cousins for a while to get her mind off things. And I had already filed a restraining order against Angel. 

He looked at me with eyes that hadn’t seen sleep as he littered my doorway. “Can you buy me a -“
I shut the door in his face. I wasn’t in the mood for his bs. I felt his shadow lingering for over an hour after that. Even when I went back out to make sure he was gone. I still felt like he was here. After the second time I looked around I let that feeling dissolve and went on about my day. 

My therapist suggested I try meditation to help deal with the stress. I laid out a mat and sat down and started to meditate. I figured I’d try counting first to keep a steady focus.

I felt a stream of tears roll down my right eye.

What is th—

A long drawn out scratch at my living room window interrupted me. 
I wiped my eye as I glanced at it. Then I noticed my hand. Black liquid. All over my face.

 “What the hell?” 

I rushed to my bathroom and Washed it all off. It looked like a bit of it got into my right eye, I might have to go to the doctor. I leaned down to rinse my eye. When I got back up, I froze.

My reflection was grinning—I wasn’t . 
I checked my face with my hand. I definitely wasn’t. And my reflection hadn’t moved an inch. 

“What’s wrong Danny ? “
My reflection whispered, its eyes grew completely black and void. 

I just stared. Unable to move. Unable to speak and my lungs screaming. 

“It’s time Danny, you’ve waited too long
We’ve waited too long.
Do it. 
Do it Danny . “

he raised a long jagged blade and his grin grew more wicked. 

Thud. 

I opened my eyes. I was still in the living room. I got up quickly. I dropped the knife in my hand. 

Thud. Thud. Thud. 

I went to the door. Angel, once again. 
Before the door was fully open he began. “ hey man I really need help this time. I’ll go clean I promise.” Words I’ve heard one too many times before. 

“Do it Danny.
Do it 
    Do
  It”

“Please Daniel, I promise for real this time.” Angel pleaded to deaf ears. 


“Liar “
“Dancing with me”

So lost in thought I tuned Angel out. 
I smiled and said “alright man come on in.” 

Angel walked in. My grin widened. 

“He deserves it. You know. We know it. 
You’d be doing him a favor . He can’t live with himself. He’s weak. Too weak. “

Not even 5 minutes went by and Angel was snoring on the couch. 
Passed out from whatever drugs he was on. 

“Look at him. Pathetic. “

“He’ll never amount to anything. All he does is bring you trouble. Pain, and sorrow. That’s all he’s good for. “

I gripped the handle tight. I felt it pulsing, like it had a heartbeat of its own. 

“He’s a burden. A parasite . A roach”

My thoughts growing louder and louder in my head. Screaming. Begging to escape. 

“It’s his fault Danny. It’s all his fault. 
His fault Danny 
All his fault.”

The thoughts weren’t just in my head anymore. They were all around me. Inside the walls. Echoing in the vents. 

“All his fault”
“All his fault”
“ALL MY FAULT DANNY”
Angel shrieked suddenly. Sitting bolt upright, his eyes as black as void. 

The knife was stuck too deep by the time I realized what I was doing. 

Angel started laughing. Wet and guttural. Like the sound came from his stomach. 
“Hehehehehe….
Im so proud of you Danny.”
 
It wasn’t my brother’s voice anymore. Angel sounded like the voice in my head. The voice that’s haunted my thoughts and taken me to darkest corners of humanity. It was its voice. 


His mouth kept moving but the voice was booming from every direction. 

“Dannyy”
“Now I’m free—from you“

I stumbled back, crashing onto the cold hard floor, breath ragged. I was shirtless. 

Angel stood. Grinding his teeth. 

“I’ll see you soon”

and then sprinted straight through a window with inhuman speed. 

Glass exploded outward—but I didn’t hear it. 

Half a second later every mirror and window in the house shattered . They cracked like bones all at once. 

The whispers left my head that day, but the wind didn’t carry them far.
