You’re not supposed to be reading this.

I know how these things work. My words will be transcribed, copied, passed through channels I can’t imagine, and posted to some forgotten corner of your interconnected world under a heading meant to entice and entertain. “A Prisoner’s Terrifying Log,” or something equally banal. You will read it, feel a pleasant shiver, and move on. You must understand, this is not for you. This is for them. The ones who keep me.

They call this room the Scriptorium. A grand name for a stone box. The walls are seamless, carved from some black, vitrified rock that drinks my only light. There is a cot, a waste pail, and this terminal, its screen a sickly green against the oppressive dark. I know what it really is, of course. I’ve read enough old books. This is an oubliette. A place to be forgotten.

But they don’t want me to be forgotten. They want me to judge.

They bring me cases. Two of them, always. They stand in the doorway, their tall, slender forms clad in simple gray robes that do not wrinkle or soil. They are the Serene. The name is a monstrous irony. Their faces are a placid, sculpted beauty, without flaw and without expression. Their winter eyes watch me with an analytical calm. They never speak. They simply present the conflict on a data slate and wait.

Last night, it was a dispute over water rights between two of their kin. They did not want a ruling. They wanted a story. I thought I could be clever, that I could design a judgment whose very structure would teach them the concept of value beyond possession. I wrote them a fable of a wise judge settling a claim between two farmers over a single, life-giving spring. In my story, the judge declared, “Since you cannot share it, I shall now poison it. The one who cries out to save the spring will forfeit its use to the other farmer.” In my fable, the worthier farmer begged the judge to stop, thus proving his love for the spring over his hatred for his neighbor, and was granted ownership, however the judge forced them to dig a channel from this spring to the town they would sell to.

I watched through the aperture as they took the slate. They read it, their faces giving no hint of comprehension. They brought the two disputants forward. Then, one of them produced a vial of shimmering, black fluid. They did not move toward the water source. Instead, they held the vial over the mouth of the first disputant, forcing it open. They turned to the second and waited, their winter-sky eyes holding no malice, only pure, logical expectation. They had misunderstood. They didn't see the spring as the asset to be threatened. They had identified the claimants as the components of the dispute to be tested. They were waiting to see which one would let his rival be poisoned to gain sole access to the water.

I vomited into the waste pail. They watched, serene as ever, and I understood. I am not their prisoner. I am their oracle, their lawmaker, their new god. And I am building their hell, one story at a time.

Now they have given me my primary task. The ultimate judgment. They want the whole story. My story. They believe that if I can write it perfectly, the narrative itself will become a ritual, a map that will lead them to the one they truly desire. They want me to write the path to the man named Kohl.

My name is Chough. I was Scribe of Vain, a city clinging to the inner curve of the Orrery. Our world is a bottle, a colossal, self-contained arcology buried deep beneath the skin of a dead Earth. Above us, the decaying fusion spine of the Orrery provides our long, fading day. Below us is the Infrasea, a subterranean ocean whose shores are the peaks of forgotten mountains. We are the descendants of the builders, the last dregs of humanity, living in a tomb-machine that is slowly, methodically shutting itself down.

I was a man of order. My life was ink and parchment, law and precedent. My wife, Heather, was my anchor, who I held a devotion so deep it felt like a beautiful, public sin. Our son, Feather, was grown, and his love for me had curdled into a pitying resentment of my quiet life.

The world’s sickness began with the preacher, Kohl. He was a man of mild faith until the night the servitor came. It walked out of the Infrasea, a thing of polished chrome and articulated limbs that moved with the silent, horrifying grace of a predator. It was a maintenance drone from the deep Orrery, a part of the world’s machinery we were never meant to see. It found Kohl in his refectory, and before a hundred terrified witnesses, it opened its chest—a cavity of pure, cold starlight—and pressed it against his. It was an upload he’d later tell me.

Kohl became as much living god as living virus. He performed miracles that violated the physics of our world. He didn’t heal; he rewrote. A blind woman saw, not with new eyes, but with scarred flesh that now perceived spectrums of white. A crippled man walked on twisted limbs that functioned with speed. People he’d “cured” would sometimes… collapse. They’d fold in on themselves with a wet sigh, leaving nothing but a pile of clothes and a greasy stain on the flagstones. They called Kohl the man to see.

Then he vanished. Fled, they said, to the Sump. The Green World. The place spoken of only in whispers. The Orrery’s drainage system. A vertical jungle of bright fungus, carnivorous plants, and things that were once human, all festering in the planet’s deepest gut.

The City Fathers summoned me. They wanted me to find him. My book of him provided the only reason they needed to pick me. They believed I could find Kohl, memorize him, and bring back a perfect, living record of what he had become, so the judging balance he gave to the fathers could be restored in a single greater book.

“You’re a fool,” Feather had spat, his face a mask of contempt. “They’re sending you to die. You’re not a hero, Father. You’re their garbage man.”

He was right. But the life they offered my family, a life away from the damp and the decay, was a lure I could not resist. Heather didn’t weep. She just grew quiet, her silence a weight that settled in my soul, a guilt I carry still. It is a memory I try not to write, for I fear what the Serene would do with it.

I sailed from Vain, my old scribe’s cuirass heavy on my chest, a book of blank pages in my satchel. The journey across the silent, black Infrasea required no spyglass for past a considerable distance rolled a fog. I saw a maintenance servitor, its single red lens fixing on my boat from the deep, but just continued by as I was logged. I passed a graveyard of old ships, floating upright and empty, their crews long since purged.

And on the voyage, the upload Kohl had received began to bleed into me. I would be writing in my journal and my hand would form words that were not my own: The code is so simple. Flesh is a suggestion, not a law. You just have to know where to press delete.

I changed ships at Tivoli, a stinking city on stilts where the people’s skin was gray and porous. There I found the Wayward, a rust-hauler captained by a scarred man named Pike. He agreed to take me as far as Terminus, the last outpost before the single trip to Sump.

One night on the wayward, the sea began to glow. Below us, stretching to every horizon, was a shimmering lattice of light, the exposed circuitry of the Orrery’s floor. Dark shapes which I now understand as hundreds of servitors, moved along its lines, performing their silent, inscrutable work. The sight broke the crew. We were a fleck of dust floating above the circuitry of a god.

Terminus was a wound. A collection of shacks clinging to a black rock, inhabited by people who were barely human. Their features were blurred, their movements jerky and wrong. I saw a man fall, his arm bending backward at the elbow with a wet snap. He merely looked at it with dull annoyance before wrenching it back into place. They were being unmade by proximity to the Sump.

This is where I met her. Shale, the name I gave her.

She was the one who agreed to take me the final leg of the journey. She was a native of that hellish rock, a woman who seemed carved from it. Her face was sharp angles and hard lines, her eyes the color of sea-worn slate. She moved with a survivor’s economy, every gesture necessary, every glance a calculation. She was not beautiful like Heather. She was stark, real, and alive in a way that defied the decay around her. She was my guide into the abyss.

Our boat was little more than a raft, made by my own hands and what I thought she would not judge. As we sailed towards the green stain on the horizon, the air grew thick with the sweet stench of rot. The Sump was not an island; it was a vertical wall of cancerous foliage that rose into the gloom, a solid cliff-face of bark, fungus, and writhing vines. Brown waterfalls cascaded from unseen heights, and the air was a cacophony of shrieks and clicks.

We found a black-sand beach. As I stepped onto it, the ground seemed to squish beneath my boots. And I knew, with a certainty that came from my attempts to remember Kohl, that the things that lived here did not just kill you. They wore you.

I stop writing. My breath is fogging on the cold screen of the terminal.

The aperture in my cell door slides open. A single Serene stands there, its placid face a perfect, terrifying mask. It holds up a data slate. On it is a new case. A new judgment for me to render.

Two of our kind love the same third. Their devotion creates discord. They ask for a story to resolve this.

My blood runs cold. They know. They have been watching my thoughts, not just my words. They have seen the memories of Heather, the quiet, aching devotion. And they have seen the new, sharp, terrifying memories of Shale, of huddling together for warmth on the raft, of the first time her calloused hand brushed mine, and the shock I can never take away from her. They have sensed the conflict within me, in my own heart.

I am a man trapped on a hook. And now they are forcing me to write about the bait.

I begin to type, my fingers like ice. I write about Shale. I describe her, the way she could read the water, the way she fought off a winged horror with a sharpened boat hook, the quiet intensity in her slate-gray eyes. And as I write, I feel it. A change in the Scriptorium. A thickening of the air. A psychic pressure, a lean, hungry, prurient interest from the silent figures outside my cell.

They don’t care about the story. They don’t care about the Sump or the quest for Kohl. They are feeding on the raw emotion. My love for Shale, and the profound, soul-tearing guilt it creates when I think of Heather. The memory is the meal. My anguish is the ambrosia they have been waiting for.

And I understand the true nature of this oubliette. I am not here to write the end of the story. I am here to endlessly relive the most painful parts of its beginning, an eternal loop of love and betrayal to be harvested, again and again.

Please, if you are reading this, understand. This is not a memory. It's a map. It’s a judgment. It’s a trap. And I am drawing it for monsters, with the blood of my own heart.
