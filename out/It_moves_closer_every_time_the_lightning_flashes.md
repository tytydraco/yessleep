I’ve always been a sucker for a cliché. "It was a dark and stormy night." It sounds cheesy in a ghost story, but when you are actually sitting in it, huddled in an old Victorian house while the wind screams like a banshee against the siding, the cliché stops feeling safe. It starts to feel heavy.

I was alone in the house... or so I thought.

I had made a ritual of it. Every time a gale rolled in off the coast, I’d turn off the lights, brew a pot of Earl Grey, and sit in the wingback armchair facing the sliding glass door. I loved watching the violence of nature from the safety of my living room. The glass was double-paned, a thick, invisible barrier between me and the chaos

Tonight, the storm was different. It wasn’t just rain; it was a deluge, driven by a wind that shook the floorboards beneath my feet.

Flash!

The backyard lit up in a burst of strobe-light white. The massive oak tree in the center of the lawn stood rigid, its gnarled branches thrashing like drowning arms against the grey sky.

I started my count, sipping my tea. One-Mississippi. Two-Miss...

BOOM!

The thunder rattled the ceramic mug against my teeth. Close. Less than two miles.

I set the tea down. The silence between the crashes was heavy, filled only by the wet drumming of the rain.

Flash!

The yard illuminated again. I saw the oak tree. I saw the lawn chair the wind had overturned. And I saw a shape standing by the back fence.

I blinked, leaning forward in the dark. It was tall, motionless, and draped in something heavy and wet that clung to a frame that looked too thin to be human.

Darkness slammed back down before I could focus. The afterimage burned in my retinas, a purple splotch floating in the black.

"Just a bush," I whispered. My voice sounded thin, swallowed by the house. "Just the shadows playing tricks."

I waited for the next bolt, my muscles tensing.

Flash!

The air left my lungs. The shape wasn't by the fence anymore.

It was standing in the dead center of the lawn.

It had moved thirty feet in ten seconds. In the stark white light, I saw it clearly. It had no face. Just a smooth, pale surface where features should be, slick with rain. And it wasn't just standing there. It was pointing. A long, grey finger extended toward the sliding glass door. Toward me.

One-Miss...

CRACK-BOOM!

Panic, cold and sharp, spiked in my chest. I scrambled up from the chair, abandoning my tea. I rushed to the door, my hands shaking as I checked the latch. Locked. The deadbolt was engaged.

I backed away, grabbing the heavy brass poker from the fireplace. The metal was cold in my sweating palm.

"Go away," I hissed at the dark glass. "I'm armed."

I waited, my breath hitching in my throat. I prayed for the storm to pass. I prayed for the darkness to hold, because as long as it was dark, I didn't have to see where it was now.

Flash!

The yard was empty.

The figure was gone. The oak tree stood alone. The lawn was vacant.

Relief washed over me, dizzying and nauseous. I let out a jagged exhale, my grip on the poker loosening. I slumped slightly. It had been a trick of the light. A shadow puppet made by the storm. I laughed, a dry, nervous sound.

Then, the lightning flashed one last time.

The yard was still empty. But in the reflection of the glass door, illuminated by the stuttering white light, I saw the living room behind me

I saw the back of my armchair. I saw the reading lamp.

And I saw the pale, faceless figure standing directly behind my left shoulder.
