This is the story of how I killed myself.



Like most of these stories, it begins with grief.



As a kid, my best friend was a girl named Rebecca. My parents adored her, Mom especially. That was funny, because Rebecca was nothing like Mom. She was a lot like my dad, though. Now that I think about it, that's probably why Mom liked her — because the only person Mom actually loved was my dad.



One of the things Rebecca had in common with my dad was reading. She was an absolutely voracious reader. So was Dad. He read so much that he went book shopping every Thursday night, right after he got paid. Books were his life.



Me, on the other hand? I hated reading.



I forced myself to read to impress him, because he was my hero and we all go out of our way to impress our heroes. But I didn’t like books. I liked toys. Legos, lincoln logs, trains, hot wheels, stuffed animals, action figures — it didn’t matter. If it was a toy, I loved it.



Anyway, when I was in first grade, a new mall opened a few blocks away, in the hills on the east side of town. The builders very creatively named it the East Hills Mall.

I was *so* excited.


Dad wasn’t. “It won’t last,” he said. “They built that mall in the east hills, and the east hills are where everything manmade goes to die.”


He was right, but that didn’t stop me from loving that stupid mall. I loved its shitty movie theater, its shitty promenade, and each and every one of its shitty little stores.


The store I loved most was a shop called World of Toys.


I don’t know if it was fate or a curse or an echo of the future or the past or *what*, but that store — it wasn’t even love at first sight. It was love at first *sense*. Somehow, I knew it was there waiting for me before I ever even saw it.  I felt a pull on my heart guiding me. And when I stepped inside the mall the first time, that pull dragged me to the very end of the promenade.


There, I found a dark, narrow shop bursting with toys of every kind. Legos, action figures, dolls, model cars, electronics, stuffed animals taller than me.


And wouldn’t you know it, there was an entire wall dedicated to books. Some new, some old, some broken. So many I couldn’t imagine ever reading them all.

My dad could, though.

So, thinking I was very sly, I told him it would be a good idea if he did his weekly book shopping at World of Toys.

And instead of book shopping in regular bookstores like an adult, he spent his Thursday nights with me at the mall.


Those nights were the best of my childhood.


I looked forward to them all week, and sometimes even dreamed about them. Even the dreams were the best dreams I ever had. In the dreams, the mall was four times the size and a hundred times more beautiful than it was in reality. A bigger, better, happier mall.


The dreams were so real they even infected my waking life — on a few of those deliriously happy Thursday nights, I’d peek through a maintenance room or a utility corridor, and catch a dreamlike glimpse of something at the other end that looked just like the better, happier mall from my dreams.


It scared me badly, but in a good way. A *magic* way.


Everything about the mall was magic.


Part of what made it magic was because it was the only escape I had from my mother.


I guess you could say she was abusive. Only verbally — she never hit me or anything. But she was distant as the moon and mean as *fuck*. She called me every name in the book. When she got tired of *that*, she wrote a new book all her own.


I didn’t really mind. If anything, it was kind of funny.


It wasn’t funny when she called me broken, though. Especially when she said I was so broken that I broke her too.


That wasn’t the worst thing she said to me, not by a long shot. But for some reason it hurt the most.


I don't know why she hated me so much. I really don’t. But she did. She treated me like an inconvenience at best and her mortal enemy at worst. On really bad days, she’d look at me like I was a stranger. I used to wish I was.


My dad kept her in line when he was home, but *only* when he was home, so I hated being alone with her. It was so bad I used to dream about Dad’s days off. Sometimes I’d even wake up crying when I realized it was only midweek.


So I guess you could say time with Mom was dark. Time with Dad was bright. Time at the mall was brightest of all.


That’s why I lived for Thursdays, when Dad would pick me up from school. He’d pick up Rebecca, too, until she died. It was a car accident. We were ten. It fucked me up. I’m still fucked up.


Anyway, Dad would pick us up, take us to the park to run around, then drive to the mall for an early dinner at the food court. Sometimes he’d take us to see a movies. Those were the best nights, the absolute best of the best. But sometimes he wouldn’t. And that was fine, because whether we saw a movie or not, we always ended the trip at World of Toys.


Dad grew to love World of Toys almost as much as I did because somehow, he always found books that he didn’t even know existed. That made him so happy. Seeing him happy made *me* happy. That’s because my dad was my best friend. More than my best friend. He was my god. He was too important even to be the most important person in the world. He was so important that the world wasn’t big enough to hold his importance. He *was* my world.


He died when I was eleven.


It happened the first week of November, right as Christmas decorations went up around the mall.


I didn’t expect to wake up the day after he died. Not even because I was suicidal. It was just that I couldn’t imagine the world going on without him.


But it did, somehow.


It didn’t feel real, though. *I* didn’t feel real.


And good thing, because real boys can be hurt, and if I’d been a real boy, my mom would have destroyed me.


I can’t describe what she became after he died. I don’t even want to try. She jumped the rails into an entirely new world of insanity. She could never decide if she hated me or if I was the only thing that mattered. I actually liked it better when she decided to hate me. She was wired so wrong that mattering to her was worse than being hated by her.


So I looked forward to the weeks where she hated me. When she didn’t care where I was or what I did.


What I did was spend all my time at the mall.


I’d do homework at the food court, buy dinner with money I’d stolen, then wander the stores til closing. I pretended Dad was with me, especially on Thursdays. On the right night, I could almost convince myself that he really was there. That if I turned around, I’d see him coming up behind me with a bag of books swinging from his hand.



Every night I spent at the mall led to wonderful dreams. Dreams of Dad, alive and well. Of a mother who didn’t hate me. Of Rebecca. Of the better, kinder mall, four times bigger and a hundred times more beautiful than the real one.


I lived that way for a whole year, convincing the deepest part of myself that my father was still with me.


And then it was the first week of November again, with Christmas decorations going up all over the mall.


So every year, the mall rented out this train. A kid-sized Christmas train with cars decked out in garland and velvet bows, like a dollar store Polar Express. It looped endlessly around the mall while the kids glowed with Christmas spirit and their tired parents smiled.

The night that train started running, I broke down.

I don’t know why, but something about it just drove home that my dad was gone, that I’d never squeeze myself into a garland-decked kiddie car while he smiled down at me. That he’d never smile down at me again. That he’d never smile at anything. Never do anything at all. It didn’t matter that I fooled myself into believing he was still with me. It didn’t matter that I could sometimes feel him coming up behind me. Those feelings were lies, and his death — his absence, his *goneness* — was the only truth. He wasn't here. He didn’t live on inside me or up in Heaven or down in Hell. He didn’t live anywhere. He just *wasn’t*.

My world just *wasn’t*.



And what do you do?



What do you do when your world leaves you behind?  I know the answer is *go on,* but that answer is a lie. You don’t go on. You don’t move on. You don’t. You’re just…



You’re just.



I didn't even know I was crying until tears obliterated my vision, transforming the mall into smeary streaks of silver and gold and red and green over an auditory miasma of laughter and Christmas music and the shrill whistle of the train. It felt like all the molecules that make up Christmas had broken apart to float and fly around me, *through* me, shredding my insides like nuclear fallout.



I didn’t want anyone to see me cry. I didn’t want anyone to see me at all.



So I ran.



I ran right in front of the train. The conductor yelled at me, which made me cry harder.



I ran to the very end of the mall, dodging irritable parents and overstimulated children and giggling teenagers, and into my toy store.



I ran to the bookshelf and I found the section my dad liked best — the one all the way at the back, the one filled with dog-eared pages and torn covers and broken spines, the perfect place for a broken little boy — and slid into a narrow space between the shelf and the corner. There was a hole in the wall halfway up, as dark and endless. I wanted to crawl inside it and die.



Instead I sat underneath and sobbed into my hands.



The store was quiet but not too quiet. The lights were soft and comforting. There was nothing loud, nothing bright, nothing cold. Just gentle warmth, deep and somehow secret, cradling me as I cried.

When I was finally done, I looked up and saw a shiny blue book at my feet.

My face was on the cover.

I wondered if I was dreaming. If this was one of those weird, wrong nights where I’d look through a security corridor and catch a glimpse of the better, kinder mall.

I picked it up. It was called *The Eyes in Mother’s Heart,* and there was no denying it — that was *definitely* my face on the front.

It sounds crazy now, but I was sure my dad sent the book to me. That he was reaching out from the afterlife to send me a sign. I really believed it…

Until I started to read.

The story was about a boy named Marley, just like me, who was broken beyond repair, just like me. Marley lived in a dark, bright world with a cruel mother who hated broken things. Every night, Marley dreamed of a new mother who loved broken things.

Soon he found this new mother from his dreams.

Or rather, she found him.

Her name was Mother Spider, and she knew how to love broken things.

Objectively speaking, it was a bizarre, beautiful little fairy tale. Macabre, but harmless. I almost took it home, but I was too scared. Too scared of my face on the cover and my name on the page. Too scared that it was a trick, somehow, that my mom was playing on me.

So I left it behind.

And when I went back the next day, it was gone.

But on the little square of carpet where I’d cried — right under the hole in the wall — was a new blue book called:

*Marley Meets Mother Spider.*

That book was almost like a poem. At the bottom of each page was the line, *Because Mother loves broken things. I*t was about spiders and flies and broken things, and how they all affect “the web that is the worlds.” How Mother Spider is the God of the Web. How bad flies destroy the web, how only spiders can stop bad flies…

And how only broken things can become spiders.

But the book also said that nothing can become a spider unless Mother decides so, and if she decides you’re broken enough to be a spider, she knocks.

That’s what the book said:

*Mother loves broken things. Mother chooses her spiders from among broken things.*

*And Mother always knocks first.*

I swear to God, the second I finished the book, I heard a knock behind that wall.

I looked up and saw an eye glistening through the hole.

“Hello, Marley.” Her voice was beautiful and soft, the gentlest and kindest of whispers. Like a mother soothing her infant. “It’s me, your mother.”

It was her, of course. The God of the Web. She Who Loves Broken Things.

Mother Spider.

What followed was weeks of insanity that I don’t think I can describe.

But in brief, Mother Spider became my best friend.

She was always there when I needed her. The mother I’d only been able to imagine, the parent I’d always dreamed of, my god, my most important thing, my world.

Some nights I’d just kneel on the floor of the toy store and whisper secrets through the hole in the wall. Sometimes she’d reach through and stroke my hair the way my dad used to. I told her things that didn’t matter and things that did, things that had, things that would. I told her the mall was the only place that felt like home.

“That’s because I’m here,” she said. “And you belong with me.”

The closer I grew to Mother Spider, the farther I grew from my real mother.

For someone who didn’t love me, my mom sure got mad when I pulled away from me. It drove her crazy. So crazy, she finally hurt me. Really hurt me.

In the way the Christmas train drove home the truth of my father’s goneness, what my mom did to me that day drove home the truth of my life, which was this:

My mother hated me. My father was dead. So was my best friend. I was failing in every way. I had no grounding, no dreams, no hope, no future. I was a twelve-year-old who whispered secrets through a toy store wall to something that was nonexistent at best and a demon at worst.

And that demon was the only thing that loved me.

I wanted to be gone, just like Dad. Not in Heaven, not in Hell, not living on inside anyone’s heart, not anywhere but gone. I actually prayed for God to kill me for an hour before I realized I was being stupid — after all, I knew God personally, and she lived in the mall.

So I got away from my mom and went to the mall where God was waiting. God was always there when I needed her, and this was no exception.

I begged her to kill me.

She reached through the hole to stroke my hair. “How could I do that?”

“Let me go. Please just let me go. I want to see my dad again.”

“Will that make you happy?”

I felt a thrill of horror, but nodded anyway.

“Then come and see your dad.”

I heard noises in the wall. Scratching, skittering noises like rats or giant spiders.

The hole got big, bigger, biggest.

Then Mother Spider pulled me through the hole, into —

To somewhere else.

It was nighttime. The stars were huge, and the moon was huger. Everything looked like a nightmare, but worse.

We were on a road that rose up into a towering hill. On one side of the road were buildings. There were things peering through the windows and standing in the doors that I couldn’t even look at.

On the other side was a vast field of flowers swaying in a frosty breeze.

I turned around and saw my mall behind us, looming absurdly at the end of the buckled nightmare road.

“Where are we?” I asked.

“Where do you think we are?”

I realized I was shaking, and hated myself for it. “A hill.”

“A hill,” she repeated, kindly. “Well, let’s see what’s on the other side.”

We walked. Well — I walked. She crawled.

The hill was so high that when we reached the top, the moon was close enough to touch. It looked so big, and it was smiling.

At the crown of the hill, the road split off into eight avenues like the legs of a spider. The one in front of us led down to another mall. And not just any mall.

The bigger, better mall from my dreams. The one that couldn't be real. The one that was too good to ever be real.

Mother Spider led me down the hill and into the bigger, better mall.

It was everything I’d seen in my dreams and more. The mall I loved, the mall that was magic, but four times bigger and a hundred times more beautiful.

It was crowded, but no one seemed to see us as she guided me down the promenade and finally stopped at the food court.

At a table ten feet away, strong and familiar and so deeply loved that every part of me hurt to see him, was Dad.

Dad and my mom, sharing a sundae and laughing.

I tried to run to them, but Mother Spider held me tight. I squirmed and fought until I saw *why* she was holding me back:

Me.

Me, identical down to the last hair on my head and my crooked canine tooth.

Me, hurrying to my dad’s table with a sundae of my own. Rebecca was with me. My best friend Rebecca, who was as dead as my dad.

The world turned to smears of color as tears ran down my face. “Where are we?”

“A better, kinder world,” said Mother Spider.

“It is real?”

“As real as your darker, brighter world.”

That made me want to scream, because my world didn’t feel real. *I* didn’t feel real. Nothing had felt real since Dad died.

Nothing but Mother Spider herself.

She led me away, down a promenade four times the size of the one I knew, to the very back of the mall. World of Toys was there, small and grimy and dark as ever, exactly how it looked in the real mall.

Mother Spider took me to the corner by the bookshelf, sat me down, and wiped my tears.

Then she explained about what she called *parallels*.

According to her, parallels are basically alternate universes. Each parallel is basically a beam supporting the web that is reality itself. Mother Spider could travel between parallels as easily as I could walk down to the street to 7-11. But people couldn’t. People were trapped in our parallels.

And in my parallel where I was trapped, my father and Rebecca were dead.

That made me cry harder than ever.

“What’s wrong?” Mother Spider asked. “Aren’t you happy to know your father yet lives in a better, kinder world?”

I didn't know how to answer that. I mean…who would be? Who would be happy to know that everything you want, everything you need, everything you dream of, is just beyond your reach?

Who would be happy to see it, but never have it?

Who would be happy to know that your whole entire world somehow isn’t meant for you?

Not me.

But I knew better than to throw God’s gift back in her face, so I pretended.

I was so good at pretending that she brought me to the better, kinder mall to look at my Dad every Thursday night.

I already said she loves broken things, and turns the most broken of them into spiders. Well, a long time ago, she turned the most broken thing she ever met into her best spider. His name was Sariel, and he hated me. The first and only time Mother Spider introduced us, he called me *Web ripper* and tried to kill me.

Mother kept us apart after that.

She had another spider named Claudia who was as scary as Sariel and much meaner, but prettier too.

Between the three of them — Mother Spider, Sariel, and Claudia — I don’t know who scared me more. I still don’t.

Anyway, on one of our visits to the better, kinder mall, Sariel followed us. He interrupted us, saying he needed Mother’s help, so she left me there.

“Don’t cause any trouble, Marley,” Mother Spider warned, “or you’ll rip the web.”

Then they went away, leaving me in the better, kinder mall with my dad and my happy mother. With my world.

Only it wasn’t my world. I wasn’t allowed to have it and no one, not even God herself, would give it to me.

At the exact moment that thought crossed my mind, I saw my friend Rebecca.

She was older and alive and healthy and so pretty. My best friend. Even she was here, in the world I wasn’t allowed to have.

She noticed me immediately, but wasn’t happy. “I told you to leave me alone, Marley.”

“Sorry,” I said anxiously.

That made her mad. “You’re not funny! Just leave me alone!” She shoved past me.

I didn’t want her to go, so I grabbed her. She jerked away, glaring the way my mother did, and ran off.

Then I felt two hands on my shoulders, squeezing just like my dad used to.

I looked up, equal parts panicked and elated and so hopeful—

But it was Mother Spider.

“You’ve been a web ripper.” I’d never heard her voice sound so cold or inhuman, never even imagined it could be. “Come, Marley. Come see what happens to web rippers.”

She steered me down the promenade, into the toy store and past the portal wall, back into the nightland with its towering hill and grinning moon, to the top of the hill with its eight-legged crossroads, all the way down the right-most path. At the end was a shining building made of stars and silver. The smiling moonlight stained it yellow.

We went in.

It was a church. Not like any church I’d ever seen, not something I could describe with words except to say it was a church with an altar and pews. But the pews were made of bodies. Living people, broken and twisted together into the right shape.

On the altar was a flayed body. Sariel knelt before it, working. Blood covered his pale arms to the elbows.

Mother Spider made me sit in the front pew. Its bodies shifted strangely underneath me. I was  so close to Sariel I could hear his fingers squelching inside his victim.

It was a woman with yellow hair. Her throat was cut, and her mouth kept opening and closing like a fish. Her body was covered in eyes. Terrible, murky eyes that reminded me of roadkill and dead pets. I counted seventeen before I stopped.

“What’s he doing?” I asked.

“Taking her apart.”

“Why?”

“To use her pieces.”

“For what?”

“For the web she ripped.” Mother Spider leaned in so closely her hair fell over my shoulder. “Pieces of web-rippers are the only things that can repair the web. You were a web-ripper today. If you’re a web-ripper ever again, I will give you to Sariel.”

This should have scared me, and it did. But not enough.

Not nearly enough.

Because I knew the truth now: 

That my world was one of two. One had everything I loved.

And it was waiting for me at the bottom of the hill.

Mother Spider made me promise to never return to the better, kinder world.

I broke that promise three days later.

I marched into the toy store and knocked on the wall. She didn’t answer. I knew she wouldn’t, because she was angry with me. She won’t speak to you if she's angry with you.

I crawled through the wall, climbed the towering hill, and ran to the bigger, better mall.

I only did it to watch, I swear. That was my rule:

*Only watch.*

What I saw made me love my dad even more. Rebecca too. It made me hate my mom more, though, because if my parallel mother could be so wonderful, what the ever-loving *fuck* was stopping my actual mom from being kind?

But I hated myself even myself. My smarmy, spoiled, happy parallel self.

He was a bastard. The meanest kid I’ve ever seen, especially to parallel Rebecca. He was cruel. So incredibly cruel.

That’s why I finally broke my rule:

To prove to Rebecca that at least one Marley was worthwhile.

It wasn’t hard.

To understand why Rebecca accepted me so easily, you have to understand that her family was dead. The car accident that killed her in my parallel killed her family in the better, kinder parallel.

Eventually, I was able to prove to her that where I came from, her family was still alive.

So of course it wasn’t long before she asked me to take her to the darker, brighter world to see her family the way I came to the better, kinder world to see mine.

Of course I took her.

We snuck into the darker, brighter world four times before she asked me to help her switch worlds. “I’ll help you switch too,” she promised. “You help me go there, and I’ll help you stay here.”

I don’t know how to say no to anyone I love. I never have.

So we made plans.

Other Marley was the biggest obstacle. At first I wanted to kill him, just because it would be easier.

But the sheer injustice was too much even for me. And honestly, so was the idea of leaving my mother with nothing. She’d already lost her husband, the only love of her life. I didn’t want her to lose her son, too. And for all I knew, she’d even get along with Other Marley. Bond with him the way she couldn’t bond with me.

So I decided to switch places with him instead.

“He’ll be fine,” Rebecca promised. “I’ll make sure of it.”

I figured that would be enough. I’d have my world back. Other Marley would have the world he deserved. He'd have a mom, and even a friend to guide him, which was more than I’d had.

We decided to bring Rebecca to the darker, brighter world first, because it was easier. There wasn’t a second Rebecca to get rid of, you see. No swap. Just a reunion.

So we started making our plans.

Those plans gave me nightmares. Mostly about Sariel and his shimmering church, but about Mother Spider too. They were so bad I almost backed out.

But I didn’t want to let Rebecca down.

So we put our plan into action, and we made it safely.

Her parents were so happy to see her. So, so happy. I know because I was there.

Maybe it seems insane that a family would accept a dead daughter with open arms. But it’s not. I know. The depth and weight of grief can compel you to accept anything, and when *anything* just happens to be the return of your whole world, acceptance is a foregone conclusion.

Nothing went wrong.

Days turned into weeks and weeks into months while I waited for divine retribution.

But it never came.

Sariel didn’t chase us down. Mother Spider didn't say a word, even when I knocked on her wall in the toy store. No one came to break me down into pieces to fix the web I’d ripped.

And that was that.

I’d done it. I’d given Rebecca her world.

So now it was time to take mine.

But out of nowhere one day, the enormity of my stupidity wrecked me.

And I couldn’t do it.

I couldn’t.

Knowing Mother Spider and Sariel, it was a miracle Rebecca hadn’t been killed already. And what *Rebecca* had done wasn’t even wrong. She hadn’t hurt anyone at all. What *I* wanted to do would hurt. It was much worse. Much darker, much more selfish, much more terrible.

So instead of taking my world, I went to God and asked for it.

This time when I knocked on the portal wall, she answered.

“Can I swap places with Other Marley?” I asked desperately.

“No.”

“Why?”

“Because the web will burn. If you burn my web, Marley, I will send Sariel to catch you. Then I will kill you myself.”

That was the threat to crown all threats, and it frightened me.

But it didn’t frighten me more than a world without my dad.

“You’re basically God,” I argued. “So why can’t you swap us? Or even let us both live in the better, kinder world? You could make us twins! Then no one would even—”

“What you are asking is an abomination!”

“Why is my happiness an abomination?”

“Happiness has nothing to do with order.”

“Why do you care about order?”

“Because I am the warden of order.”

I started to cry, which was so embarrassing it made me want to die. “Some warden you are. You’re lucky I’m even asking. I could just do it, and you wouldn’t even know.”

“I would.”

“You’re full of *shit.* You say you see everything—”

“I do.”

“—but you didn’t see it when my friend moved to the darker, brighter world, so—”

“I saw, Marley, but I loved you too much to stop you. I don’t love you too much to stop you burning my web.”

“Please,” I begged. “I’ll do anything you want. I’ll be anything you want until I die if you just let me go home.”

“This is your home.”

Tears stung my eyes. The world dissolved into smears of light. “Everything I love is there.”

“It was never meant for you.”

And that was the end. She refused to give me my world.

So the next Thursday night, I took it for myself.

I won't say how. I’m too ashamed.

But in the end, I brought Marley to the darker, brighter world, and took myself to the better, kinder world.

The moon leered at me as I climbed the towering hill. I expected Mother Spider or Sariel to appear any second and drag me to the silver church.

But they didn’t.

That proved to me Mother Spider lied. She didn’t see everything. If she didn’t see everything, then she wasn’t really God.

And that meant I was safe.

I made it to the better, kinder mall and wandered around until I found my dad.

He was talking to security, no doubt trying to find the son who now lived in another world.

As if sensing me, he turned around.

I immediately started to cry.

The world melted into blinding smears of light. I couldn’t see anything through tears. I couldn’t hear anything over sobs. I couldn’t feel anything but relief.

From that moment forward, guilt ate me alive.

It was so bad that I decided to swap back with Parallel Marley a hundred times. To right my wrongs, undo my sins.

But my resolve only ever lasted until I saw my dad again.

You have to understand — he wasn’t just the most important person in the world. He *was my* world. And I’d done everything in my power to take my world back.

Who wouldn't?

Who, when given the choice, wouldn’t take a better, kinder world? One with everyone they loved, with everything that mattered, with everything they wanted, with everything they needed but *better*?

Anyone would.

Guilt still ate me alive

I hated myself for what I'd done. Not enough, of course. Not nearly enough. Certainly not enough to give back what I’d taken…

But enough to try to make Other Marley's a little better.

It’s stupid, but I decided to help him. And I decided the best way to do it was to visit him.

And during the first week of November, as Christmas decorations started going up, I returned to the darker, brighter world.

I crept through the mall and into the toy store, on high alert for any sign of Mother Spider or Sariel. I crawled through doorway to the nightland with the towering hill and spidering crossroads under the leering moon. I ran up the hill and down again, past monsters and buildings and bleeding stars and blue flowers, all the way to the darker, brighter mall.

I went home.

Mom wasn’t there, but Marley was.

I scared him to death. He scared me too. He looked awful. Too young and too old, so thin he could have been dying. His eyes scared me most, dim and gleaming like the dead eyes in Sariel’s victim.

“Am I crazy?” he sobbed. “I am. I’m crazy, just like she says.”

“Who?” I asked. “Your mom?”

He wailed into his hands.

“Don’t listen to her,” I said. “She’s crazy, not you. I’m here to help you.”

“How are you going to help me?”

I hadn’t thought that far, so I told him the truth. “Everything you remember is true, and your father is alive.”

“How do you know?”

“Because… I’m you,” I lied. “You, but from the future.”

His face split into a grin that didn’t even look human. “God *fuck*, I’m insane. How is my dad alive in the future, dipshit?”

“You’ll find out,” I lied desperately. “But only if you hold on.”

“No. No, no, no. You’re not any older than me, which means you’re not from the future.”

He had me there. “Okay. You’re right. I’m not from the future.”

“So I’m just crazy. Talking to myself.” He laughed shrilly. “*Literally* talking to myself. I don’t want to talk to you. How do I make you go away? Like this?” He slammed his head into the wall.

I grabbed him, practically crushing him to keep him still. “Fine. You’re right. I’m not you. This is just…the form I take to make it easy for you to understand.”

“Pardon me, me, but what the *fuck* am I supposed to understand?”

“That…that I can bring your father back. But only if you do what you’re supposed to.”

That grin split his face again, reminding me of the moon leering over the towering hill. “What am I supposed to do?”

“Grab onto whatever you can,” I said, “and hold on tight.”

“Then what?”

“Then…then we *really* get started.”

He looked at me thoughtfully. For a second I thought everything would be okay. That he was actually going to listen.

Then he said, “No wonder nobody can stand us. We really are a stupid asshole.”

Let’s just say it didn't get better from there.

But I didn’t give up, and eventually he got used to me.

That was good, because helping him made me feel like less of a monster.

Here’s the thing. Parallel Marley was right: Nobody could stand him, including me. But everything that was wrong with him was my fault. I’d ruined his life. Taken it. *Stolen* it. So no wonder he was insane. No wonder nothing felt real to him. Nothing felt real to me after my dad died, and Marley had lost far more than that.

I tried hard to make things better for him.

He’d alienated Rebecca. I tried to fix it, but it was no good. She was happy to see me, but refused to see him. It was so bad she hit me the first time because she thought I was him.

I kept trying anyway.

Then I encouraged Parallel Marley to make friends of his own. To learn, to grow, to build, to take his life like I’d taken mine. To live.

It didn’t work.

Over the years, he faded, literally and figuratively. His eyes never changed. They were always flat and glaring, filled with despair and terror and loathing.

The eyes of a man forced to parlay with his killer.

And one day, I looked at him. Really looked at him. At the face just like mine, the eyes just like mine, the frown lines and scowl just like mine, the light shining off the hair just like mine,

I realized I was killing myself.

That maybe I already had.

It really hit me then — what I’d done, what I’d ruined, what I’d destroyed, what I’d taken, what I’d *stolen.*

I desperately wanted to give it back.

I tried.

I even told him the truth, the entire truth, but it was too late. He wouldn’t listen. He just said it was crazy, it had always been crazy, and he was tired of being crazy. *Nothing makes me feel crazier than you,* he told me. *If I ever see you again, I’ll kill you*.

He wasn’t lying.

So finally I gave up. I left him in the darker, brighter world, and returned to the better, kinder one.

I lived there happily for years. I didn’t go back to the mall once.

But that last year — in the first week of November, just as Christmas decorations went up around town — my father died.

I had no need for the world he left behind.

I’d gotten everything I needed, everything I wanted, everything I set out to take: A life with Dad, who’d been my world.

Now that that was gone, it was time to return the better, kinder world to the person it really belonged to.

So the night after Dad’s funeral, I went to the mall.

I decided to walk through the entire thing one last time, to commit it to memory. During that walk, I passed the movie theater.

And I felt a pull on my heart.

I looked in the direction of that pull and saw a flash of hair. Bright blonde hair, shimmering under the shitty lights like sunlight on the water.

It wasn’t love at first sight.

It was love at first *sense*.

Instead of walking down to World of Toys to go home, I went into the theater.

I saw the flash of hair again. It belonged to a girl at the concession counter. Looking at her, I knew…I don't know what I knew.

But whatever it was, I knew it.

I bought a ticket and went straight to concessions.

She was nervous, which I liked. I bought an unholy amount of snacks, then gave her a ten dollar tip, hoping it was enough to make me remember me.

It was.

When I went back the next night, I chatted her up. Her name was Nicole, and she had a boyfriend. Of course she did. She was seventeen. Of course she was.

I pulled back. I kept going to the theater, though. Kept building our friendship bit by bit for years.

The week after her nineteenth birthday — the first week of November, just as Christmas decorations went up around the mall — I gave her my number.

And that was that.

She was everything to me.

I caught her with her coworker a few weeks after our fifth anniversary.

I killed him.

I’ll never forget how she screamed for him. I wonder if she’d have screamed for me that way.

She tried to take the gun. I didn’t let her because I was afraid she’d kill me. We fought until it went off. Just like that, she was dead.

My world, gone.

I wanted to be gone, too.

I almost was. The gun was at my temple when I remembered that the world — the better, kinder world I'd stolen, that I'd betrayed — was only one of two.

And that there was still a darker, brighter world.

A world where I actually belonged.

A world where she might still be alive.

So I went to the mall.

World of Toys was still there, narrow and dark and tucked into the very back. The bookshelf was there too, and the hole in the wall that led to the towering hill.

I crawled through just like a spider.

The familiar hill towered before me, lined with blue flowers on one side and buildings on the other. Bleeding stars spattered the sky. The massive moon leered down over all as I climbed.

When I reached the top, I expected Sariel or Claudia or Mother Spider herself to explode out of the flowers and kill me.

They didn’t, so I ran all the way down the hill to the little, rundown mall still perched absurdly at the bottom, and bolted inside.

The moment the door swung shut, a shadow descended on me, slender and strong and much too big, writhing sleekly as eight bright eyes shimmered in its face.

Mother Spider.

“Please,” I said, “Don’t kill me. I’ve come home. Back where I belong. With *who* I belong.”

“I know,” she said.

Tears burned my eyes, turning the shadows and my mother’s shining eyes into dark, bright streaks. “Is she here?”

She tried to pretend she didn’t understand, but I didn’t allow it. Finally I said, “My father was dead here, and alive there. Now she’s dead there. Is she alive here?”

“Yes,” she said. “The right one, the one you were meant for, the one as dark and bright as you, is here. But my boy…my darling broken son…so are you.”

“I’ll fix that,” I said. “I promise.”

She touched my face and stroked my hair, just like she used to. Just like my dad used to.

Then she let me pass.

That’s because she doesn’t know how to say no to anyone she loves, just like me.

When I found Nicole, she was alone in a house that looked just like the one I’d had with my Nicole.

I spent the first night watching her, and the second night too. I was trying to figure out how to introduce myself when Other Marley came.

He was a ruin.

Broken beyond repair, desperate and dangerous and sick in every way.

Over the next month, I watched him hurt Nicole again and again and again. No matter how many times he hurt her, she held onto him because she loved him. She loved him so much. More than my Nicole ever loved me.

As I watched them, the magnitude of my own self-inflicted misery struck me.

Her love should have been mine. It *would* have been mine, but I’d stolen it from myself. If, on the night of my dad’s funeral, I’d returned to the darker, brighter world like I’d planned, I’d be with her now. Here, where I belonged, with someone who loved me as much as I loved her.

And for the second time in my life, I decided to get rid of Other Marley. Not to kill him. Not even to hurt him.

Just to put him back where he belonged.

I recruited my old friend Rebecca. She’d built a wonderful life for herself. When I congratulated her, she said, “It’s because of you. I’ll return the favor.”

But she never got the chance, because that night, when I went to the mall to begin preparations, Other Marley caught me.

I swear to God, I didn’t mean to kill him.

He meant to kill me, though.

Part of me wanted to let him. Part of me longed to let him slide his knife between my ribs or into my heart or down my belly and let it all end.

And if I’d had no world, I would have let him.

But I had a world again. She was just a couple miles away, waiting for me.

The only thing standing between her and me was myself.

I tried not to hurt him, but he didn’t leave me any choice.

He went into shock, which made it easy to walk him down to the toy store. We went in and crawled through the wall to the towering hill under the smiling moon. Only the moon wasn’t smiling anymore.

Halfway to the better, kinder mall, Other Marley collapsed.

He died in my arms.

I dragged him into the blue flowers, then went home to Nicole.

We’ve been happy ever since.

And it’s literally because I killed myself.

I feel like I'm supposed to be sorry. I *know* I’m supposed to be sorry.

But I’m not.
