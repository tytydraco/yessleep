I met Edward Morse near the end of June, 2002. He was old, if you couldn’t tell from the wrinkles on his face you could tell from the pictures on his wall. My parents, as they did with any new neighbor, had brought their specialty: tater tot casserole. Mr. Morse accepted the tin covered meal with worn hands and practiced niceties. My parents were nosy people in a nosy town and he had managed to get past introductions and send us on our way in record time. But in those few moments that I saw into his house I saw enough to know that Edward Morse had been a soldier. 

As I said, I lived in nosy town. It was a small drive by collection of homes filled with religious farmers and fields filled with cows. So when the sunday bells were rung it quickly became the talk of the town that Edward Morse had not attended.

It only took only that first week for my grandma to be partaking in the rumor mill, my parents followed after two. Mr Morse was a sick man. Mr. Morse was an atheist. Mr. Morse was a vampire that couldn’t walk out into the sun. It would be easier to state the things that Mr. Morse was not.

Due to living in the same house of my grandmother and spending my free time with other kids my age I heard every accusation and story about the mysterious Mr. Morse that you could imagine. It took a month, but eventually a prevailing theory took root in the minds of the chattiest woman in town: Mr. Morse was a Muslim.

In the left hand pocket of his trousers Edward Morse had a compass. A few times a day he would walk outside, take a deep breath, pull out the compass and turn. I had seen him do it a number of times but it was my grandma who had brought the news to all the townsfolks.

Quickly Edward Morse became less talked about. I doubt he minded as he was a private person from the start, but people started to walk a little faster past his lawn. I on the other hand was a young and bored kid. It was the last summer before I would start high school and my parents didn’t let me so much as watch TV at a friend's house. MTV was the stuff of the devil and I wasn’t to go near it. So I would spend a good portion of my day outside just kinda walking around.

One of those early days in that summer I was doing just that, walking, when I saw Mr. Morse walk outside. At this point it had all but been ratified in congress that Mr. Morse was a muslim. Nobody had any doubt. Most of them have never even seen him pull out his compass, and if they did I think those doubts would have started rising like they did for me. I didn’t have an answer for what Morse was doing but it never looked like praying to me. He didn’t kneel or put his hands together. What he did was pull out the compass, turn, and for just a second his solid and polite demeanor would waver at the edges as a sense of relief appeared at the ridge.

“Is that where Mecca is?”

I called out to him, standing an awkward distance away, keeping to my house's lawn. Usually I wasn’t the outgoing or nosy type but for whatever reason I just felt like asking.	  
  
“Meccas that way kid.”

He pointed almost in the opposite direction he was staring.

“So…what are you looking for?”

“I’m looking for nothing.”	  
  
He put his compass back in his pocket. But I was able to see it clearly enough to know that he was facing west.

It took a while to get my parents to believe me that he wasn’t looking at Mecca when he went outside. My grandmother wouldn’t believe me no matter what I told her. You see, to me Mr. Morse was a symbol for the outside world. A man made of experiences I’d never get to have. He swore under his breath and didn’t play the world of small town politics that seemed to crawl out of every crevice in my life.

Over the course of the next two weeks I tried talking to Mr. Morse a number of times. Each time he very quickly and politely ended the conversation. But even those passing phrases made me the person who had interacted with Morse the most. The other people in town who tried to know Morse, similar to my parents, had given up after he had made his position clear. I however never gave up.

Mr. Morse broke his hip. IHe had tripped on his way back from the grocery story and landed just right on the concrete to shatter the bones. 4 days later he came back from the hospital in the city and for the first time he started the conversation. He still didn’t care for me or my questions about his life, but more important to his interests was the fact I didn’t smash my hip into a million pieces.

I ended up doing a number of things for Mr. Morse. Mowing his lawn, getting his mail, and occasionally helping him get to the bathroom. Whenever he asked me to do something I accepted, in exchange for my work he would occasionally answer a question of mine. Most of the time instead he would let me watch his TV. Everyone else in town was so connected that they all knew my parents didn’t want me watching television. I have no doubt that Mr. Morse not only was unaware of this policy, but wouldn’t have cared if he did. 

To me it seemed like Mr. Morse had been everywhere. In reality he had been in most of the US and some parts of Asia. He didn’t always answer my questions, and when he did it was brief. I brought up the compass again but he shut that down right away. However I was able to put a couple of things together about other parts of his life.

Edward Morse had spent two years in Burma during the tail end of WW2. He worked on the airplanes that sent supplies over “the hump” or the eastern end of the Himalayan mountains. The few times he spoke about his time there he always talked about it as if he were listing off facts from a book. It was always impersonal despite it being about himself. 

When he came home he spent some time in a hospital before working as a repairman for a number of years, more and more east across the united states until he finally came here to retire. I tried asking him why he didn’t retire someplace with better weather but he simply said the cold didn’t bother him.

I spent most of that summer either helping Morse with housework, watching his TV, or hanging on to every word he said in the few times he gave me new information about his life. Every day of that summer, without exception, Mr. Morse would look west multiple times. It wasn’t on a timer or at a specific time of the day. He did it seemingly at random. I viewed it as a form of compulsion. A need he occasionally couldn’t keep down in his stomach until he looked west.

His hip didn’t get better. And the body surrounding it was only getting worse. My parents had attempted to get me to spend less time with Mr. Morse. However, they saw Mr. Morse walked to his mail box later in the day and changed their mind. It was a grueling watch. He breathed rapidly in a way only made possible by 80 years of belief that breathing with your mouth was wrong, and lungs that needed more air than his nose could provide. Quite frankly I didn’t know what He would do when school started back up and I wouldn’t be able to help him. My parents assured me that he wouldn’t be around too much longer anyways.

It was about 2 weeks out from when I would start school again. Around this time Morse couldn’t stand at all. Mr. Morse had sent me out to go pick up some toilet paper. I had the exact change in my hand to give to Morse but I stopped in my tracks when I heard him. Mr. Morse was sobbing. It was a weak whimpering tone, his eyes red and puffy, and it was the only time I ever saw his compass not in his hands or his pocket. It was lying on the floor, like it meant nothing to him. He didn’t look at me, he just stared out his screen door. He stared out west.

“Top cabinet…right side…grab a glass for yourself if you want. I won’t be able to finish it.”  
  
Dropping the things in my hand on the counter I turned to the kitchen and in the cabinet was a bottle of wine, french lettering lined the sides. I grabbed two glasses and brought them to his chair.

“I’m not allo-”  
  
“Stop talking.”  
  
His head pointed me towards the chair next to him.

“You know how to open a bottle?”	  
  
With a few minutes of struggling he managed to coach me through it. His eyes dried up, his face was still red and inflamed. But his voice was calm. He stared at me for a few moments until I tentatively took a sip of the red liquid. Then he spoke.

“I was discharged…”	  
  
His voice became solid. It was as if for a moment his throat was young again.

“When I got back…I was discharged…”

He looked off into the distance still, his eyes were entranced with something above the trees.

“A good friend of mine…John…heard that there was a monster in the jungle. I was so young…stupid. So we went out to find it.”

He finally tore himself from the screen door to look at my eyes.

“Drink some of it. It’s older than you.”

He took a drink of the liquid and spat some of it out as he coughed. I took a sip, some of it also being spat out as the bitter taste surprised me. Morse didn’t seem to mind at all that his supposedly old wine was being wasted.

“We found it.”

He turned back to the screen door.

“We had heard rumors that some terrifying creature, an apex predator, an incomprehensible madness was somewhere in the trees. It was just an excuse to do something, talk about…about anything really.”

He took another drink and started shaking slightly in his chair.	  
  
“It told us to leave.”

Mr. Morse started sobbing again.

“It was facing away. I couldn’t see all of it but I thought I could. Looked just like a skinny man to me.”

He wiped the slow trickles of tears off his face.

“It kept telling us to leave it alone. Said it liked where it was and wanted to stay. Said if we didn’t walk away it wouldn’t be able to stay. We didn’t listen. We didn’t leave. And we…we looked into it’s eyes…colors aren't supposed to…they don’t do that. They shouldn’t.”

The drink fell out of his hand and spilled on the carpet. I stood up for a second but his face turned to me and without a word told me to sit back down.

“I can’t describe it. Never could. I used to tell everyone I met, hoping they would understand. It was deep. Once I saw that light…that color…I could see everything wrong with that creature…I knew it could see everything wrong with me. John ran. He ran west."

"They showed me his body. He was perfect…not a…not a hair out of place. Just dropped dead, they said. I was just stressed, they said. They sent me back and I was happy to leave.	I was happy to go because when I looked up in the sky I could see that color in the clouds.”	  
  
The old man pointed his quaking finger at the screen door.	  
  
“I can see it now.”

Morse reached out his hand and grabbed mine shakily. His eyes pleading with me.	“I have to ask you to do something unfair…I’ve known it was always going to end like this…I should’ve stopped running a long time ago. But it’s too late for that.”

His body strained as grabbed my glass from me and took a large swig.

“I’m a bad person. I’ve done bad things…I’m gonna die with that.”

His quiet sob broke out into a howl. A few seconds passed but he collected himself.	  
  
“I don’t want to die sitting down. I want to look into its eyes…Will you wait here with me…so I don’t fall?”	  
  
Just like how he couldn’t explain to me what color he saw I can’t explain to you why I stayed. I lifted his body up onto his feet and strained as I took the weight his broken body couldn’t.

“Close your eyes. It won’t be long.”

It wasn’t. Just a few moments passed before I heard the screen door slide open. My eyes tightened as I felt the wind hit my face. One step…two steps…and it stopped. I don’t know what happened. But I feel in my soul, if such a thing exists, that Mr. Morse’s stare was met back.

Mr. Morse’s arm around my shoulder went slack.

The doctors declared Edward Morse to have died of natural causes.

I don’t regret not opening my eyes, but sometimes I still wonder what that color looks like.
