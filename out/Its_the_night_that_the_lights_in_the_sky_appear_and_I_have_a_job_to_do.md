…But as the wheels of my old pickup truck came to a creaking stop, I thought, “*Do* I have the night right?” I’d thought about this date for almost three months now. Because it was three months ago when they first made contact… 

...When they tasked me with this job.

Getting here was so difficult that if I *did* have the night wrong… if I was early… well, I’d just have to wait it out. And if I was late… then I guess I’d have a *new* problem.

I reassured myself that the sudden doubt I was feeling about dates was just nerves. Tuck ‘em away. Shove ‘em down deep. This shit is too important for that. *I’m* too important for that.

The mission is everything.

I’d pulled my truck onto the private country road about a mile back. The signpost had long ago been swallowed by foliage, but I’d practice-run this route countless times these past months and there was no way I was going to miss it.

It was once a highly trafficked road, but now, you could barely see the pavement. My 2001 Dodge Ram was built to handle this sort of terrain, but still, I got bounced around so much for that mile, I nearly knocked myself unconscious against the roof a couple times. 

This made spotting the second signpost quite difficult. How could I mark the beginning of the path when the woods took everything out here within weeks? But there it was. A giant crucifix, strung together by old fence posts. Covered in green vines. Nearly tipped over in my path. But visible still. Thank god. I eased on the brakes, threw the old bitch into park, killed the engine, grabbed my rifle, and got out of the vehicle.

As quietly as I could.

\*\*\*\*

Unlatching the back door of the truck’s bed, I eased it down, gritting my teeth with every loud squeak of old Detroit metal. (Never knew how much I’d miss WD-40.) There, lying in the truck’s bed, was a large burlap sack. Heavy, but not too much weight I couldn’t handle the next trek. I poked it a few times with the muzzle of my rifle. Nothing stirred within. No sounds emanating. Dead? Sure as shit hope not, or else this is all for naught.

As satisfied as I was gonna be, I carefully pulled the sack across the dirty blue, metallic bed, bent down, and leaned it over my right shoulder, as if I was a foreman about to leg some much-needed supplies to a construction site.

The narrow path cut like a vein through the thick trees. It’s impossible to be out of shape these days, but I wasn’t no spring chicken, and soon, I was panting. My back grunting and gasping as I hoofed it. 

If anyone was actually around and happened to see me, I’d appear as a hunter. Local, if you could see my face. Rifle slung over one shoulder and what looked like a dead dear from a distance, folded over the other. Nothing strange about it, right? 

As the minutes turned into hours, my back was starting to scream. Shit, did I miss it somehow? Go off-path and walk right by the damn place? I was about to commit the dreaded act of veering a little, maybe even doubling-back, when… there it was. 

A chimney poking out of the top of the brush. 

\*\*\*\*

The cabin sat silently among the trees, waiting for me, as if I was in a Grimm’s Fairy Tale. I approached it cautiously. Rifle pointed. These woods are vast. The largest in the state. But desperate people had a way of finding anything. That meant there could be other warm-bloods hiding out here. Raiders, squatting. Looking for a person like me. 

Or worse…

As for the owner, I wasn’t worried about her. First time I found the cabin, I did my proper due diligence on her. Soon realized she’d been gone for years. Probably befell some horrible end. I mean, who leaves their guns behind? I don’t care how many you have; you can never have enough.

Yep, she’d either become a meal. Or offed herself in some creative fashion. Not my problem. Seen enough of that to become numb to it. The place was mine.

Reaching a hand through the broken glass of the front door, I pushed it open and creaked my way into a living room. To my relief, it didn’t look half-bad. The couch still had its cushions and stuffing. The old TV hadn’t managed to crack yet. And the 2038 calendar, already five years old, still hung on the kitchenette wall, displaying cute, little holographic kittens running through fields. Shit, if I wasn’t so worried about being seen here, I’d almost wanna turn the place into my new home. It wasn’t a compound like my actual place. But it was more secluded. Farther off the grid.

Well, time to erase those thoughts. This wasn’t about comfort. It was about proximity. Location. No more doubt. The date was right. And I’d found the cabin again. The sun was setting soon and there was more work to be done. *Get to work, you old fucker.*

\*\*\*\*

Stepping into the bathroom with the burlap sack still over my shoulder, I crouched down as much as I could. Took a deep breath. Then leaned forward until the sack flung itself off my shoulder and — SLAMMED into the porcelain tub.

“Mmmmrrrrffff!” Came a sound from within the burlap.

Shit.

“Mmmrrrggghh! Hrrrrrffffffmmmfff,” came the response.

Shit, I hadn’t wanted it to wake up yet. Hadn’t wanted to have to open that sack and stare into those eyes. Especially if it was awake. 

Stepping back out into the living room, I began searching around. What I wanted wasn’t anywhere, though. I was about to give up when I remembered the shed. An old tool shed that is. 

“Sit tight, won’t be but a minute.” 

The gagged sounds had turned to grunts. Grunts that almost sounded like… sobs? Interesting emotion. But hell, maybe something in that head still remembered what was before. One minute you’re hiding out. Making your way north like the rest of us. But stop at the wrong truck stop… open the wrong door… and next thing you know, you’re lying in a gutter, bleeding out. Until my wrinkled ass finds you and you end up duct-taped and cocooned in a smelly burlap sack, riding in the back of my rickety-ass truck for three hours. 

Tough break, kid. 

\*\*\*\*

The shed had what I needed. Of course, it did. I’d learned to respect the woman who had owned this place by now. There weren’t any framed photos in the cabin I’d have to face down like usual. No cold stares from the memories of some long-dead family. In this cabin there *weren’t* any memories. The woman — and I knew it was a woman because of the silky things she had in her dresser — was a loner. Like me. No connections. Nothing to haunt you. Least not anymore. She’d been living up here on the outskirts. Sequestering herself deep in these here woods until the end of days. But she was gone now, and it was my job to worry about days ending… and if this mission was successful, preventing that.

As I made my way back into the cabin and over into the bathroom, my cargo (Yeah, not a person no more. Cargo. I like the sound of that), she’d — no, *it’d* managed to squirm its way nearly out of the damn tub. Like some burlap snake, the little — *thing —* was almost onto the tiled floor. A fighter. “Now, now, back in ya go.” With a thud, I tipped it back into the tub. And now an angry, “Hrrrffff!” Grunted out. That’s more like it. Show me that rage.

A thought occurred to me, and I sighed. *Maybe it couldn’t breathe well in there.* Again, if it died… this was all for naught. And, either way, I had to let its head out of the sack for the next part. 

Reaching my course fingers into the seam of the burlap, I gave a rough tear and out spilled an auburn-haired head of a young woman. Maybe twenty-three. A looker, really. Stupid for someone like her to be out here on her own. 

I looked away as she screamed at me from beyond the wad of thick, balled-up rag sealed up into her mouth by four layers of duct tape. I didn’t look away from the horror of what I was doing here, but because the damn girl looked like my Cindy. A phantom from my old life. 

Still keeping my eyes averted, I quickly leaned in with another rag, this one soaked in the ether I found in the shed, and smothered it over her nostrils till she breathed enough in to THUD her way back onto that porcelain again.

*It*. Not *her.*

Dammit.

\*\*\*\*

Night came on suddenly, the way it always does in a place with no streetlights. The cabin was an island surrounded by a black void. Silhouettes of tall trees, like sentries on the horizon, swayed in the cool autumn breeze. A crescent moon lit our way. 

*Me and the thing who I wished didn’t look like my Cindy.*  

They had said they’d come at 2am, so I left the cabin around midnight, just to be safe. I’d have left even earlier, but the less time I was out in the wild with a trussed-up, unconscious piece of cargo in the back of a wheelbarrow, the better.

There were things in the wild way worse than animals these days.

I watched the sack. Praying to god it didn’t start moving again. If I had to give it anymore ether, I was afraid I may kill it. And they needed it alive. If it was going to work, they needed it alive. 

Basically, if this dies, well… we all die. 

 To suppress the guilt, I had to keep telling myself that this thing in the wheelbarrow before me wasn’t a girl no more. It was a predator. Like 96% of the world now. It wanted to eat me. Tear into my flesh. Make me a meal. Or worse… leave me for dead… until I woke up… just like it.

Just remember the mission. When the lights come… bring them what they want. And one day this whole mess will be over. Before long, I’ll be back at the ballpark, slugging down a beer, watching my team annihilate some sorry sacks. 

Oh, who you kidding, old man? Even if tonight’s mission does help cure this thing, you’ll still be long-dead of natural causes before we’re back to professional sporting events. Well, if not for me, our children’s children –

But I didn’t have any children anymore. So who the fuck was I doing this for? What was I trying to save? I’d already lost everything important to me in this world.

Hell, maybe that’s *why* they picked me. I had nothing to lose.

\*\*\*\*

As I stood in the designated clearing, waiting for 2am to approach, I thought about the past twenty-four hours and how I’d come by my cargo. This might all sound last minute because, well, it was.

She… *It*… hadn’t been the plan. 

I’d been tracking a different Infected for the better part of a week. It was a “stray.” Didn’t stick to any hordes. I just had to wait until I had it in a position where I could snag it without having to put a bullet in its head. If I’d had some damn tranquilizer darts, I could’ve saved a lot of time. But no, all I had was my burlap sack and a big pair of balls between my legs.

Problem was the redhead. Wrong place. Wrong time. What was supposed to be a calculated snatch and grab, turned into me attempting to save the poor girl’s life as she wandered into the scene and nearly became lunch. 

By the time I got there, fired off a few shots, my original target had taken off, and I had a new one. Lying in the gutter… covered in blood. Wrong place. Wrong time. 

Tough break, kid.

One minute, you’re a warm-blood like me. Just trying to find safety in this new world. Maybe I would’ve been that safety, if only we’d found each other sooner. It’d be tough. Her looking like Cindy and all. But shit, everything happens for a reason. And maybe it’d be like a second chance. For both of us. 

Maybe she’d be who I was doing this for.

Instead, the poor girl found a pair of infected teeth digging into her flesh. And now, *she* was who I was doing it to.

And as if it read my mind, sensed my guilt, the thing in the sack started sobbing again. When did it even wake up?

And *how* was it crying? Infected didn’t cry. They drooled. Hissed. Bit. And then a horrible question crept into my mind…

*Maybe it — She — WASN’T infected.*

\*\*\*\*

Replay the scene, hoss. You’re hidden on the roof of the gas station. Binoculars to your face. Watching your target… your stray… wander up the interstate. It’s wide open. Nothing else in sight. All you gotta do is wait for it to pass, then creep down the roof. Come up behind it with the burlap sack… and hold on for dear life.

But by the time it’s passed you, and you’ve climbed down, something has crossed its path. Something who stupidly thought this lurching thing was still warm-blooded. A friend, perhaps. That happens sometimes. Us survivors get confused. See things that ain’t there. Like my Cindy’s face over some other girl’s face. 

*And that split second of doubt is all it takes to end up with a set of teeth in your flesh.*

That’s what happened at the gas station. And before the redhead knew what was happening, she was on the pavement, fighting off a drooling, hissing mouth. By the time I got to her, the stray had run off and the redhead was lying there. Covered in blood. Unconscious. 

Wrapping her up in burlap and hauling her into my truck was the simplest snatch and grab I’d ever had to do. But it didn’t make it any easier. The whole thing just sucked.

But *was* it her blood? Infected like to cough blood out as they attack you. One drop gets in your mouth and it’s Sayonara. 

But maybe that infected blood *hadn’t* gotten in her mouth. Maybe that’s why she was making that sobbing noise. 

Crying.

Shit.

\*\*\*\*

Then I saw it out of the corner of my eye. The sack parting open. The tip of a foot worming its way out. I hurried over. Thinking I’d just stuff that foot back in, secure the bag up again, then interrogate the damn thing to see if it was still… human. 

I should have realized the reason she could get that foot out of the bag was because it had worked the tape around its ankles loose. But I wasn’t thinking, just reacting. So when I went to grab the foot, it suddenly —

Kicked forward! 

Driving itself up under my jaw! Just in that right spot to drop me!

I was on the ground. Eyes fluttering. Trying to remain conscious. Pinpricks of light in my vision. Seeing stars. I could hear her scrambling out of the wheelbarrow. Running into the trees. Definitely crying.

Definitely human.

*Shit!* 

I was back up on my feet. Trying to get sight of her through the orbs of light still floating around in my eyeballs. I saw a shadow move in the trees and made off after it. Running through the dark woods — why didn’t I grab the flashlight? Everything happened so quickly. I just acted. And then there I was, chasing shadows in a pitch-black night with what little I could see being obscured by spots. Screaming:

“Waaaaaiiiiittttt!!!!”

So, at first, I wasn’t even sure I saw the lights. I thought it was another artifact of my blow to the head. But then it grew stronger. Got closer. And I knew just what it was. 

It was them! 

And I just lost their damn cargo. Their specimen.

I ran faster. The trees around me all swaying now like a tornado was spinning through. Leaves swirling up around my feet. And what little I could make out got even darker. I looked up and the sky was blotted out. A large, silhouetted circle up above the treetops, descending upon the woods. Their ship… 

They were here.

And where was here? What was this patch of woods and why did they choose it? Well, that private road I turned onto way back? That signpost that the foliage had swallowed up? It once read JPL, twenty years ago. And this forest was all government land. And that clearing I just ran from? Within miles from the largest satellite dish in the country. 

Yeah, at first, things got a whole lot better at the start of the past two decades. Like a way to send and receive deep-Space transmissions well-beyond our galaxy. 

But things soon got a whole lot *worse*, too. Like the arrival of a pandemic that turned 96% of the world into walking rage-creatures. 

Yeah, that happened, too.

\*\*\*\*

A beam of light came on in the sky. Shining down from the ship. And when it did, I saw her. Up ahead. Stopped. Staring up at the lights. Mesmerized by them. It was a surreal site, but I couldn’t let myself get entranced by it. If she got away, if they didn’t get their specimen, this would all just keep swirling down the toilet.

So I charged. Running as fast as I could. Still not certain what she was. No scenario was great. As I said, if she got away, I’d have fucked our hope for curing this damn thing. But if *they* got to her first… saw her state… saw the blood all over her face… they probably wouldn’t ask questions. They’d package her up tighter than I did and the poor, warm-blooded girl who looks like my Cindy, would be going for a one-way trip. And it still wouldn’t help unfuck the world.

No, I had to get to her first.

But as I descended on her, she sensed me and went back on alert. Her hands were still taped behind her back, so she ducked down and RAMMED forward, driving a shoulder into my stomach. The wind knocked out of me, I got a grip on her shirt and pulled her down to the ground with me. I landed on my back. The revolver in my waistband digging into the flesh there. She landed on top of me. Body flailing like a trapped animal. 

“STOP! I’m trying to help you!” I screamed. To no avail.

Up above us, that chrome disc lowered into the trees, swallowing my voice. Dirt and twigs blew up into my face as she twisted in my grip. Her shirt wrenched free from beneath my fingers. And she made to get up. Turning away from me. I grappled for her. Hands catching her around the face. 

*And that’s when my finger sunk into something wet.* 

Then I realized what had happened… That the tape on her mouth had loosened and my finger had slipped under it… Into her mouth. 

I yanked my hand back with such force, the skin on my finger stripped away beneath her clenched teeth. The yank was also hard enough that I heard the tape tear away completely. And all the air seemed to leave the woods as her face became illuminated. 

And it sure as shit wasn’t my Cindy. Nor was it anything warm-blooded. She was Infected alright. Like I said, one drop was enough… and one drop from that stray had definitely found its way into this poor girl’s mouth.

Boy did I fuck this up.

Ever since the outbreak I have always felt a sense of danger being around an Infected, but I had never found myself in a position like this. Lying on my back, one of them kneeling over me, head darting forward. Teeth snapping. Those milky, living-dead eyes burning through me with unbridled rage. 

And then the whole ground shook as the ship touched down back in the clearing. I craned my neck to get a look at it and instantly realized what I’d done. I’d opened that neck up to her like offering myself to be taken by a vampire. But she wasn’t a vampire, and she leaned in to take a whole chunk of flesh away between her teeth. 

Focus. You must survive this! The fate of — *Ahh shut the fuck up you old bastard and get this goddamn thing off your chest!*

With her teeth inches away, I got my hands up under her chin till I was able to push her far enough off me to follow with my two boots. With a thrust, I sent her toppling back to the ground. 

And then we were both scurrying to our feet. And instead of attacking, this time she was fleeing again. Hmm, second time in twenty-four hours one of them had learned that trick. Were they evolving? Becoming smarter predators. Predators that knew when attacking in a horde was safer than one-on-one combat? Perish *that* fuckin’ thought.

Catching my breath, I pulled the revolver from my jeans. I listened to the sounds of her running. Trailing off into the distance and I aimed. Squeezed off a few rounds. Then listened for her footsteps. I thought they’d stopped, but it was hard to tell with the ringing in my ear from the gunshots. I was about to give chase again, when —

Something moved behind me. Something breathing. Trudging my way. 

The occupants of the ship…

I wanted to run. Not be a part of this anymore. And shit, I was empty-handed. Not sure how I’d explain *that*. Then a light was on me. Like an interrogation. And I turned, swallowing.

The ship was there. Gleaming. Lights on the side, pulsing. Illuminating the trees. Backlighting and silhouetting the three figures that had stepped out from the open door. That were approaching me. 

Two of the figures stopped. Big hulking shadows standing there as the third stepped forward to meet me…

… RUN.

And boy, did I. Whether I was still chasing the girl or just running away from whatever they were going to do to me when they learned I’d failed them… it didn’t matter anymore. I was running away from it all. 

The past. The present. The whole fuckin’ world.

With what sounded like a guttural hiss, I could hear them giving chase behind me. Weapons being armed. Lights getting brighter. Trying to track me through the trees.

I ducked, weaving around sharp brush and bramble. Tearing through it all like an escaped convict. And suddenly, I was seeing it all differently. Clearer. As if I’d been out here a hundred times. I leapt over every rock. Dodged every low-handing branch. Even avoided a steep drop-off into a gulley at one point by simply *– leaping over the entire fucking thing.* 

But the whole time, they were behind me. And gaining*.* 

An alien SHRIEK went out as they picked up speed. I stupidly turned around to see how close to me they were – and instantly wished I hadn’t. For what I saw… was a nightmare.

They ran on all fours, like giant grizzly bears! Fleshy and yet covered in patches of course hair. Taloned “feet” extending before them. Ripping through trees and rocks to clear a path. Thick maws hissing and gnawing at the night air as they came.

Holy fuckin’ shit! What had I gotten myself into? Saving the damn world wasn’t worth this.

With a last bit of hope, I went into a full-on sprint, now just blindly barreling ahead into the oblivion of the dark woods. Up ahead, I could hear water. Trickling. A river?

Yep, it was a river. A hundred feet below me!

Skidding with my boots, I nearly rocketed off the steep embankment. I was out of ground. Trapped. Nowhere to go.

And just as I was contemplating actually making that jump and ending it all –

The visitors were behind me… Their breaths so loud it felt like a vapor coming to consume me. I turned around as they fanned out, cutting off any escape that way. 

But rather than rip my face off, the middle one stepped forward. The ambassador. 

Standing up tall on its hind legs, it shifted its appearance. Looking humanoid now as it considered me. There was something oddly human about its large eyes. An intelligence there. And that’s when I heard it… I

Its voice in my head.

And I recognized the voice. This was who I had spoken to when they first made contact. Its voice, somehow using the satellite nearby to transmit through the CB radio in my pickup. Telling me it was from a far-off place and could help my world. 

They just needed a specimen to create a vaccine from.

Sure, it sounded nutty, but I was already living in what appeared to be the zombie apocalypse so how much nuttier could it get? But none of that mattered now, what mattered was what the voice in my head was saying:

^(why do you run when we only want to help you.) 

^(help your surviving race?)

I told him there was a little bit of an issue with the specimen. She’d ran off into the woods. I told him I fired after her and am pretty sure I hit her — 

*It.* Pretty sure I hit *it.*

That its body was probably just a few clicks that way. I felt like I needed to apologize for this, as if good manners were what was required in this fucked up situation, when a thought occurred to me: *How* did I know they really wanted to help us?

Reading my mind, the ambassador’s voice emanated again –

^(you are overrun.) 

^(a dying people.) 

^(we’ have met your kind in the past.) 

^(have had good relations.) 

^(we want to help.) 

^(we have had a problem like this on our planet once.) 

^(we have the technology to fix it.)

Well yeah, but now that I’d let the girl get away, that tech wasn’t gonna do them any good. The ambassador’s voice continued to ring in my mind --

^(with no specimen, there can be no cure)

No cure. No salvation for mankind. This was all my fault. I’d let my heart get in the way. I’d let myself become haunted by a connection I thought was long in my past. My Cindy. 

I’d fucked up.

The visitors, meanwhile, were moving closer. And now I felt something malevolent seeping from their very pores. 

*Why did they want to find a cure? Why should they care about us?*

Unless they cared about something else… Like a new planet to inhabit. 

Didn’t he say they had a similar problem on *their* planet? What if they *didn’t* cure it? What if *they* were overrun and needed a new home? A home with a cured human race that they could easily control with their mind.

A pack of wild Infected… well, they’d just have to tediously hunt down and exterminate them. No getting into *those* minds.

The ambassador was moving closer. Shaking its head as if I had this all wrong.

Wait, no. He was shaking his head as if he was sad. Sad for me. Maybe even disappointed.

I swayed suddenly…

Disappointed? What the fuck was that all about? I was trying to help them. To lead them to their specimen. Their cargo. My Cindy. No — the girl. The redhead. It. The Infected —

It didn’t *get* to be disappointed.

I told him as much, but my voice seemed to go faint while my vision blurred. When it came back, it was hyper-focused again. Like during the chase. But somehow even more heightened. I saw the pulsing in the ambassador’s “neck.” I could smell the alien blood coursing through every vein in there. 

Then I saw its face. Staring down at my hand. 

My hand that was bleeding. Bleeding from the finger. The finger that had been in the girl’s mouth. The finger that had been bit and was now… *infected*. 

*No.*

My stomach roared and I was suddenly HUNGRY. RAVENOUS. Ready to tear into that alien flesh and gnaw every piece in sight.

And without even thinking, a new impulse took over and I lunged forward! Mouth opening! Aiming for that twitching vein —

Then something hit my chest. 

I looked down as everything blurred. Swooned.

And the last thing I saw before blackness took hold —

Was an alien tranquilizer dart. Sticking out of my chest. 

Guess they found themselves a new specimen…
