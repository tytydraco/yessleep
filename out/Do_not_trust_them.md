To whoever is reading this , There's some stuff I've found that maybe I should've kept my hands off of. Well there's nothing we can do about it so let me start from the beginning.


My name is Jason and I'm 24 years old . I cannot reveal my full name as it'll be easy to track my family , Just because I've gotten myself into a mess doesn't mean I'll foolishly ignore internet safety tips!


I like technology stuff, I wouldn't go as far as saying I'm a nerd though. I was doing a part-time job, They've probably fired me considering how long I haven't shown up though. 


It started when I didn't wanna buy a video game. One of my friends had the game so I asked him to load a copy on a pendrive.


"At least get your ass here to get it loaded smh" was his response, Not exactly unexpected though. So I took an empty pendrive and left my house.


The road to my friend's house was 15 minutes by walking , I didn't have a vehicle if that wasn't obvious. It was only a 10 min walk if I took the short-cut through the Central park , So that's what I did.


When I was going through the park , Some weirdo in dark clothes wearing a U-shaped necklace approached me. He started babbling about some supernatural creatures and some "new world"


That's when it clicked , The weirdo was some cultist worshipping weird creatures. I read about it from some organisation called the UDA , Never thought it would be a real thing tho.


So I followed the rules given by them. I went to their place , Saw a guy getting stabbed by a tentacle and stuff. I read [Tracey's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/hlD0qNDEE8) about it and I think it explains what happened well. I don't have a lot of time so let me get to the point.


We reached the UDA building , They did the standard procedure of asking us what happened and letting us go. I wasn't satisfied yet, The organisation was sketchier than the creatures themselves . So instead I sneaked into the building.


It took a while to wait and see the personnel put the passcodes in but I managed to have the patience for it. 


The upper levels didn't have anything special , So I went lower. I don't think they expected humans to break in , Cause that was child's play.


I finally got to an elevator , It needed a passcode to use but I'm also good with wires so I managed to bypass it. It had just two buttons. One white button and one red button , I pressed the white button first.


In that room there were a lot of machines , I don't know what they were being used for though. That's when I saw a computer, Just my stuff. It had no password , They really weren't prepared.


There were a bunch of files on there , The one I clicked on was called "OU" , It said :


*Origin Unnatural*


*Status : Sealed*


*Description : Origin of all unnaturals*


*Precautionary measures taken : Eradication of UNF*


"This information would cost millions!" Is the first thought that came to my mind.


That's when I heard the elevator come down. I quickly put the pendrive in and started the transfer before hiding behind a cabinet.



Some guy in a lab coat walked in , Took some files and left. I stood up and took my pendrive with all the information.


I made sure no one else was using the elevator and got in it and pressed the red button.


It took me to another floor , The floor was different from all others. It had lots of doors , So I obviously went into one.


When I entered , The door behind me closed. It was dark so I couldn't see anything , Hence I started walking forward. It smelled weird but I didn't mind , That was until my leg hit something.


When my eyes adjusted to the dark , I realised it was a bone. The room I was in was filled with bones and blood  , With just one figure in a corner.


It was made of flesh , It didn't have any skin or arms. Its face had 2 empty eye sockets and one huge circular mouth big enough to eat me whole with teeth on all sides. But it's most noticeable feature was the huge black and red eye on its stomach.


It saw me as I saw it and wasted no time to scream and charge at me. I barely dodged its attack. It looked like it was ready for round 2 , That's when the door opened and 2 armed men entered. It went after them instead of me , I took the opportunity to use the bones to get up on the open air vent. 


I escaped , But they knew I was there and what I have. I've been dodging them for weeks now , They're after me and I know it.


I finally found some abandoned house with a computer and am writing this. This computer's USB port doesn't work for some reason but there's nothing we can do about it.


Here's an [illustration](https://imgur.com/a/M1s3GSY) I made of the creature, I'm not an artist so it's not that good but you get the idea. The pendrive is with me. They will track me using this post , So I'll schedule this to be posted at a time when I'll be far away from the place.


The UDA is sketchy , Do not trust them.
