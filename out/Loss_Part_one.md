As I looked at the shotgun in the back seat of my pick-up truck, I thought of my friend. The reason I have to do this. I start my pickup truck and take a deep breath before starting to drive. I look at the road ahead of me, my headlights barely illuminating the ground in front of me because of the heavy fog. My grip on the steering wheel loosens a little bit, my knuckles still white. After a grueling twenty minute drive, I finally arrived at the house. I take a deep breath and grab my shotgun, it's cold metal stinging against my finger tips. The moon is the only thing illuminating my way as I walk up to the front door. As I enter the house, the silence around me is almost deafening. I cradle the shotgun in my hands as I walk up the hardwood stairs. She’ll understand, I reassure myself. I finally reach the bedroom door. As it creaks open, I see a woman I recognize as my friend's girlfriend. Her sleeping form looking serene and peaceful as I walk up to her. I take one final deep breath, as I point the shotgun towards her forehead. The last thing I saw, before I squeezed the trigger, was her opening her eyes in recognition and horror.

As her blood splattered against the bed sheets and wall, I put down the shotgun, now covered in blood and gore. Her limp, lifeless body lay there in the bed, blood oozing out of the bullet hole in the head. Chunks of her skull had been scattered across the room. I picked up her body and slowly carried it down the stairs, through the door, and to my trunk. As I slowly lower her body into the trunk I feel a sense of grief and guilt. I *had* to, I reassure myself. As I get into the driver's seat I start the car and drive off into the darkness of the night. As my home goes into view, I feel a surge of excitement, despite my earlier second thoughts. I take the body out of the trunk and go into my house, blood slowly trickling out of her head. 

My friend passed away nineteen days ago. He had been hit by a drunk driver and left for dead. His body was barely recognizable by the time I found him. I knew I had to do something, anything at all. I couldn’t let him die like this, there had to be repercussions. 

I slowly walked to the basement door, my friend’s girlfriend's body cradled in my arms. I slowly walk down the basement to a familiar face. I greeted the figure sitting against the wall, though I knew he wouldn’t respond. As I get closer, I recognize the features of my friend's mangled corpse. “Today is the day!” I say with great excitement to the corpse as I lower the body onto the cold stone floor. “I finally have done it, murderer” I practically spat with hatred before cheerily adding “and victim united!” 

I knew she had been the one to hit him. Ever since the very moment I found the body. She had been going out drinking the night he had been hit. I eventually got her to confess to me. “Now I can finally do it!” I say my tone is filled with excitement. I go up to the altar and go on my knees and begin the ritual. I’d recited it so many times I knew it by heart. As I started to reach the end of the ritual, the candles flickered and the room drew cold. I finally finished the ritual and hurriedly got up to the body of my friend. The body laid there limp and I thought for a moment it hadn’t had worked. Then it opened its eyes. 

“Hello, Marcus”
