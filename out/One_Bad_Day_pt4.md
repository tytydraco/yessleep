Okay so at the moment me and B are at a certain popular “restaurant” stealing off their wifi, he’s well devouring fries talking about how 

“These are so much better up here”

Anyways so I know most of y’all have figured out the “big mystery” I guess I’ve never been good at keeping secrets but at the same time it was in-front of my face the whole time

Anyways this is how I figured it out, it was 3 weeks into our travels, so about 5ish years ago give or take

It begins with us meeting up with the odd girl from before, I found out from b that her name is Catherine, I say we but I had to wait in the car… again.

“So you’re really gonna make me wait in the car like a lost puppy… again come on B”

Already walking away B said “we’ll at-least I left the air on” laughing at himself 

After waiting for 15 long minutes he came stepping back into the old Impala

“So Beck, Catherine said she heard of some strange things happening in South Carolina”

“Good getting tired of Florida’s bipolar weather” I say annoyingly “Catherine say anything about the disturbance?”

“No not really, just that it may have something to do with a local curse called the Boo Hag, try looking it up on the way there” 

he said pulling out a pack of unopened cigarettes, lighting one with a match and offering one to me

“Don’t smoke, you can keep that habit”

I say Chuckling 

B smirks 

“yea yea you say that every time just being courteous; find anything on this so called “Boo Hag?”

“So legend goes it’s a being who’ll enter you house at night and steal your breath and body, and when you wake up you don’t remember anything”

“Nice, hopefully the intel’s right” -b

“Hopefully, since when did we start hunting myths?”

“Since it took someone’s body and murdered a father of 3” 

Beezle says sounding a little annoyed by my question

“Alright we’ll how far now?” 

“1 more hour, we’re heading to the Jefferson’s home.” -Beezle

When we pull up to the Jefferson’s I’m a little taken aback, never seen the country at-least not to this extent, cotton fields and trees are the only things within at-least 3 miles of the surrounding area 

Stepping out the creaky car we walk up to the home 

“Alright I’ll knock and you just hang ba-“ 

But before Beezle can finish his sentence a beam of light breaks through the door and hits Beezle straight in the chest sending him flying into me

“Okay that one kinda hurt” Beezle says slowly getting to his feet and helping me up

“You alright?” -b

“Yea man what was that?” -me

“Guessing there’s no hag we’ll besides that backstabbing Catherine” -b

A tall skinny man walks through the door with long blonde slicked back hair, white skintight robes, with what looks like wings on his back, and a sword

“Ahh Gabriel, come to spread the almighty message from father have you?” Beezle said with new found frustration in his voice

“Umm Gabriel as in-“

“Not now Beck” Beezle said more annoyed then I’ve ever seen him

“Father wants you to go back don’t make this more difficult then it needs to be?” -G

Beezle now getting so angry it almost seems like steam is rushing off him

“You already know the answer Gabe, tell father he can stick his request req-“

“That’s enough!” Gabriel says in a deeper booming voice “you continue to be difficult after all he’s forgiven”

“FORGIVEN” Beezle yells “He put me in a pit of misery for millennia and you call that forgiveness?, your worse then he is”

As he’s saying this his eyes turn into a ball or fire as he grows atleast 3 ft taller then his previous more human size (which is saying something, he was already pushing it in the height department)

His clothes burn off as his skin turns into a grayish color, demon like bat wings sprout from his back, and gains newfound muscles that honestly make him look even bigger

“Ofcourse you would choose this version of you, how’ve you fallen Samael, you’ve got so much to learn, how were you ever his favorite” Gabriel says in a mocking tone

But before he can get another word out Beezle summons some spear that puts Gabriel in shock

“Where’d you get tha-“ 

But before he can finish Beezle rushes him with the spear yelling “I’ve told you to stop calling me that!” Steam now bursting from his nose like a bull as he tries to stab the blade into Gabriel 

Gabe quickly dodges to the side slicing Beezles back with his sword that’s now admitting some sort of light 

“That could kill me Lucy temper temper” he mocks as Beezle eyes show more and more hatred for the man infront of him 

Gabe then hits him with another beam of light from his sword that sends Beezle to the ground, rushing towards him I yell

“BEEZLE!”

“Beezle get up” I say with fear in my voice shaking him

“He Should’ve listened one more hit like that may kill him, it’s time I take him back, oh and Mr.Beck I suggest you make better friends maybe ones who tell you the tru-“ 

Beezle springs up sending me on my back as he throws the spear into Gabrielle’s right shoulder sending him back into the wall of the house pinning him

“You fucking bitch” Gabriel says trying to pull the spear out as light burst through his wound

A now considerably calmer Beezle limps towards him 

“I told you, I’m staying” 

Beezle says as he starts laying into the pinned man punch after punch until the now bloody man goes limp only hanging onto the wall by the spear, pulling it out Beezle let’s the man fall

Helping me up I ask “is… Is he dead”

Hesitation coming from my voice 

A now beaten and exhausted Beezle says “no, we should go before he heals or more comes”

Limping to the car the man springs to life behind us grabbing me by my hair and lifting me into the sky

“Tell him!, tell him you’re the devil, Evil incarnate, the lord of flies” a wounded Gabriel says holding the sword to my neck

“Most of all tell him-”

Without a second of thought Beezle sends the spear flying past my face into the left shoulder of the man sending him barreling to the ground and me falling 

A wounded Beezle catches me and quickly grabs the spear “now he’s out cold, but we really need to go” Beezle says sounding weakened as he slowly turns back into the form I know him by

“Yea let’s go” getting into the car we speed off

once we’re about a mile away B asks “so you’re not going to say anything?, I understand if you want me to take you back home Beck”

“Home?” I say questionable 

“Go back to my 9-5 no I’m good, plus I knew you weren’t human, the devil? Now I probably wouldn’t have guessed that but what wrong have you done me? 

I mean yea the Bible says your evil but it’s a pretty one sided book anyways, the Beezle I know isn’t some evil monster who kills for enjoyment, you’ve helped me out of more and more shit in these last 3 weeks, and we literally save people from unexplainable shit everyday so Gabriel can take his book and shove it, even if you were some monster back then people change”

This makes Beezle laugh but wince in pain

“But he said there’s something else I should know?” I ask 

“Another time Beck another time” Beezle says starting to succumb to his injury’s

“Okay Beezle, but let me drive, you need rest and I’m significantly less injured… you will heal from this right”

“Oh yea just need time divine weapons are a bitch to heal” he says pulling over and switching seats 

“I say let’s go to Virginia and get a hotel for the week, we deserve a break” I say to an already passed out Beezle

Well now y’all know how I figured it out, don’t worry obviously Beezle is okay his wounds fully healed about 3 days later although we did have to go into hiding for about a year or so until things calmed down 

Oh and Catherine well that’s a story for next time see y’all soon -Beck
