I never liked going to my Grandpas farm when I was growing up. It was never fun. It was never relaxing. What it was, was hard, backbreaking work. I’m pretty sure my Grandfather had children SPECIFICALLY to have Grandchildren to work on the farm. I’ll always remember the kind of guy that he was, at the end of the day.

Tough as nails and covered in callouses thicker than leather. Lungs and throat ruined by years of tobacco and drinking. Mean as a bull with a personality to match; stubborn and a massive pain in the ass to people around him. Rude to his kids, slave driving to his grandkids, but I’ll give him this much praise, the guy was the best god damn farmer I think I’d ever seen in my entire life.

The man had a green thumb that almost seemed almost supernatural. The man could grow ANYTHING. Corn, greens, apples, pears, oranges, he had cows that seemed to pre-seasoned for steaks and the creamiest, tastiest milk you’ve ever had. The man may have worked us to the bone, but the food he made for us was some of the best I’d ever had. It almost made the back breaking labor worth it.

Almost. Not quite but…almost.

When I found out my grandpa died from a really intense bout of lung cancer, I can say without much doubt that my first thought was “Took longer than I expected”. The man took no less than 12 packs a week, sometimes more on a really good week and by “good”, I mean “feeling particularly stubborn and deciding he hated his lungs more than ever”.

Even if he was a complete hard ass, I never wanted anything to happen to him. In the end, he was still my grandpa. Even if it was mulled and marred by me spending hours on my knees planting seeds or picking weeds out of the grass with my bare hands, it was still a memory, you know? He was still my grandpa. He never hit us. Never beat us. Never tried to make us feel stupid, or small, or worthless. He just wanted to put in a work ethic into us, and you know, honestly, I respected that much.

It was a gag between my cousins and I was that he made us tough so none of us would “cry and make a big deal at the funeral”. And I mean, for all intents and purposes? It worked. We grew into some hard bastards that’s for sure.

People offered their condolences, their sorries, that they knew my grandfather personally and how he was a good man and how the world is a little worse without him, yadda yadda, you know the kind. We took it all to the best of our abilities, just kind of wishing the day to end already.

So imagine our surprise when we were told Grandpa left something in his will for his grandchildren. That got our attention something fierce, and more out of blatant curiosity, we wanted to know exactly, what we were getting from him.

My eldest cousin, Tiffany, got our late grandmothers porcelain dishes and good china. Given she had a fair amount of good memories with Grandma, that meant a lot to her.

My second oldest cousin, Scott, got his car. It wasn’t too much on paper but given that Grandpa practically built that thing from the ground up from an old frame he found on the side of the road, Scott knew that car would beat out anything else on the road.

My youngest cousin, Calvin, got some money. It wasn’t a whole lot of it, not enough to cause a stir over. It was about 10k, enough for him to at least get ready for Med school that fall.

And what did I get? I got the old man’s last, and cruelist, joke.

“And to my grandson, Dylan, I hereby bequeath the property of Dorris Farms to you.”

The room got so quiet you could hear a pin drop.

“I got the farm?” I remember asking lamely, if only to really air it out to the reality I was currently in. As the lawyer nodded his head and slide forward an envelope with the deed and the keys to the front gate, front door, back door and barnhouse, I sat there, staring at it in mild disbelief.

Calvin snickered. I punched him in the arm as hard as I could.

The stipulations were as follows:

I cannot sell the house until one year of me living in its residence has passed.

I am to live in it for the allotted amount of time or longer.

I am to ensure the animals, crops, and farm hands are well tended to.

I am to follow the instructions Lurch would hand me to the absolute letter.

And that was it. My cousins got actual plates and cars and straight up money, but no, I get the Farm. And let me tell you folks, just because I spent like, a week there in the summer working down to the bone, don’t mean I was farm-ready. I was in over my head before I even pulled up there in my old junker and stared up at my own prison for the next year or so.

My mom and dad were thrilled. They were under the illusion that I had more fun here than I really did. So this was “good”. This was a fun “project” and totally not a “chore”. And it meant I got out of their house for the year and started making some strides for myself. Not like I was a basement dweller, this was just, you know, the first “place” that could be construed as mine. They weren’t monsters though. They packed me up with enough food for like, a month. Just to get my foot in the door, just to get me…well, started. It was enough, after all. Once the money from the crop started to come in, hopefully it would be a little bit easier.

It better have been. Quitting my job over this was not an easy decision but I still had enough to get by for a little while. No where near a year, so it was going to trickle away after a while.

To give my grandpa credit, this place was in immaculate shape. A fresh coat of blue paint with green shutters, clean and cleared windows, a nice big porch he’d sit at with Grandma when she was alive with a nice big bay window looking into the living room, where a rinky-dink old TV stood with a doily on top with a potted plant. A relic of an older time.

The key slipped into the lock, turned, and let me into my home for the next year or so. The foyer was little more than a straight hallway with a door on the left leading to the kitchen and dining room, door on the right leading to the living room, and the stairs heading straight up to the second floor where the bedrooms were.

I stood there for a moment, taking the situation I was in as much as I could, firming myself into my new reality and inhaling slowly, the smell of the farmhouse filling me with memories of when I was just a kid-

“Mm.”

“GAH!”

I spun around, and there was Lurch. Lurch was not actually called “Lurch”, his real name was Lester, and he was my grandpa’s farm hand for a very, very long time. We called him Lurch because he was absolutely massive at near six and a half feet with square features that made him seem like an NPC from a Ps1 game. Not a single hair on his head, dark eyes sunken in with deep circles around them, and lips that never moved outside of a passive scowl at no one in particular. Lurch did not talk. Lurch grunted. And that was all that was needed of him.

“Oh, hey Lurch.” I laughed a little bit, out of sheer nervousness than anything. I spun around and took a step back from him just to get out of the sheer aura he exhumed. “How you…how you been, big guy?”

Lurch did not speak.

“You taking it easy?” I asked, and realized just how almost desperately I wanted him to talk if my grandpa wasn’t here to bark orders at him. Technically, I was his boss now, and for some reason that made it all the more unsettling.

Lurch did not speak.

“So, um, keeping up with everything after grandpa passed, or…”

Lurch moved and held up a folded piece of paper for me to take. It killed my immediate train of thought and stared at it dumbly for a few moments. When I did nothing, he shook it a bit more for emphasis, and I finally broke from my stupor to take it from him.

“I take it this is the list that he was…talking about in his will?” I asked, nervously looking it over.

Lurch nodded. Then he turned around, and walked down the path towards the cows. I knew better than to try and stop him, so I watched as he lumbered off.

I rushed all my things into the house as quickly as I could and once that was done and over with, I quickly locked the door behind me and inhaled deeply. A pile of my crap at the base of the stairs, and I was in my new home. I had no idea where to even begin.

So, while I figured out what to do with my life, I decided to make myself a quick sandwich, sat at the dinner table, grabbed the list and opened it.

I almost wish I didn’t, because inside filled me with a dread I didn’t know existed.

“Dylan.

If you’re reading this, I’m dead and you took the initative that I knew, out of all the other kids, you would be able to do this better than the others. Nothing against them. Still my kin. You’re just better cut out for the job.

There’s a reason I need you on the farm. Cause there’s things that need tending to. I’m not talking the grass getting mowed, or the cows getting milked. If that was all I needed, Lester would have taken up on that. No, someone of blood’s gotta take care of this. Someone of the Dorris name has to do what needs to be done here.

If there’s one thing I learned from my time here, it’s swarming you with all this shit ain’t gonna do anything good for you but confuse you. So the closer you get to certain times, Lester’ll hand you instruction as the date gets closer so you can get used to it.

Based on what I gather, you’re probably here, early march, maybe middle. So that gives you some time to get ready.”

I paused reading to pull out my phone and check the date. It was about April 26th.

So, you know, that probably didn’t bode well for the future. I turned back to the letter.

“Thankfully you don’t need to worry about the next part until at least April 30th, so that gives you time to settle in and get shit ready. So, here’s the first thing you need to do.”

You know that old scarecrow? The fuck you kids used to call it, Clyde or something? Clyde the scarecrow?”

Clyde the scarecrow was definitely one of the more fun aspects of the farm when I was growing up with my cousins. At times, when we weren’t expecting to work from dawn to dusk, we’d play games out in the cornfield. One of them was a mindless little game called “Scarecrow Haunt”. One of the kids would pick up the Scarecrow that was perched in the middle of the cornfield, Clyde, and move through the cornfields. If you were found while they carried Clyde around, you’d be done, or as we called it in game, “Caught by the scarecrow.”

We had a habit of playing it at night. There was a new brand of terror when you were young, navigating the corn fields, hearing the snap and crackle of branches and leaves and then, suddenly, a fucking Scarecrow barrels through the stalks and screaming at the top of their lungs.

I didn’t like Scarecrow Haunt.

“I’ll admit, this one I cheated on a little bit because since it was you all, technically, you’re blood. You had an effect on it. On the 30th of April, I need you to move Clyde from his current position of the Cornfields, and move him to the western fields. I cannot tell you how important this is boy. I know it doesn’t seem like much, but you don’t want that thing getting agitated. It starts out as annoying, but it becomes a real nightmare unless you know how to handle it properly.

That’s why I’m telling you as your first task on the farm, do this, and DO IT RIGHT.

Just remember, Dylan. I believe you of all of them can handle this. Make me proud, boy.

Respects,

Your grandfather, Abner Dorris.”

It took a moment to realize what the old man was asking me. Moving the scarecrow because it gets “agitated”? Was he fucking with me? He had to have been fucking with me, right? Yeah this had to be a sort of hazing thing he set up with Lurch. I’d be out in the fields and I’d be moving thid scarecrow around and Lester would be watching from the porch and he’d be having a laugh, or a grunt, or whatever the fuck noise Lurch made. No, I knew his games enough, and I’d be fucked if I was going to fall for a dumb ass prank like that.

Nah, this was my place now. And I’ll be doing my own thing.

I’ll bring this back here just for laughs, just so I can at least PROVE it’s nothing to be scared of. And having a journal entry of this place could be fun. It’d be like playing Stardew Valley or something.

Yeah, this was going to be EASY.
