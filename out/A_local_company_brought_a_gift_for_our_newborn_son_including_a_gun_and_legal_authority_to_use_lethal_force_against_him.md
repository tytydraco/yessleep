This morning I was disturbed by a knock at the door. My newborn baby son was sleeping in my arms, my wife was sitting next to me scrolling through her phone pretending not to hear anything, so I tentatively got up to answer it. We didn't usually get many visitors and weren’t expecting anyone. We don’t even get cold-callers out here.

I live in the small village of Winsted, in the fenland of Lincolnshire, near to the big Paragon energy plant. We moved in just over two years ago, but we were warned against it. Some locals are cynical about the Paragon energy power plant. Facebook groups are rife with dubious stories of mutated fish found in the river. People don’t go to the local woods because dogs keep going missing. Some blame the power plant for the loss of their hair, their car breaking down, even the bad weather. I didn’t see the media picking up on any of this so I disregarded it as the usual unfounded online hysteria. The rent was cheap and it was a quiet area aside from the traffic to and from the plant.

I peeked through the window at the top of my front door to see two people waiting, a man and a woman, dressed in smart suits. They both had I.D. lanyards with the blue Paragon energy logo. Their names were too small to make out. The man held a wicker baby basket with a large blue bow on the handle. When I opened the door they were all smiles.

“Good morning!” the woman said through brilliant white teeth, reducing her volume mid-speech when she noticed the sleeping baby in my arms. “We are from Paragon energy. We have a small gift for your little arrival. May we come in?”

I was taken aback, I’m a private person so in my mind only the police and vampires asked to come in, but it seemed rude to refuse. I muttered something and they followed me through to the living room. I sat down next to my wife who turned off the TV and looked a bit annoyed, possibly because I had let someone in without giving her the chance to get changed out of her dressing gown. “They’re from Paragon, apparently.” I said in a futile attempt to explain myself. Lexi shot back a look that told me I would be in trouble for this later. 

“Sorry to bother you.” The woman said with a hushed voice, “We won’t take much of your time.”

The man from Paragon put the baby basket on the coffee table in the centre of the room. It was full of the usual baby gifts, a teddy bear, some colourful toys, and clothes. In the middle of the basket was a formal white postal envelope sat on top of a black plastic box about the size of a hardback book.

“Firstly, my congratulations on the birth of your beautiful boy!” The woman continued as the pair sat down on my sofa, “We are here on behalf of Paragon energy to welcome your little one to the world. Mr and Mrs Sanders, please accept this gift from us.” She motioned toward the basket. “We are also here as part of a legal obligation to people who live within the vicinity of our plant. We take our responsibilities to the local community very seriously and we want you to rest assured we have little Harry’s best interests at heart.”

I never told them our names. They must have done their research. The woman paused, so I felt the need to reply. “Thank you.” I muttered.

“You’re very welcome.” The woman said with a broad smile. The man sat beside her with a blank expression and impeccable posture. She continued, “Amongst the gifts is a letter with some important information on, please take the time to read and sign it. There is also something for you parents in the black case.” Her smile faded. “My colleague, Mr Wilson will discuss that with you.”

Lexi picked up the white envelope and opened it, she was always the one to do the household admin. She also certainly didn’t trust me to read anything that was important enough to sign. While she read, I eyed up the mysterious black box. I noticed Mr Wilson watching me, so I cast my eyes elsewhere. 

Lexi broke the silence, “What does this mean, ‘regional contamination causing unexplained phenomena in biological matter’? Is it nucular?”

The woman scoffed, “Nuclear? No. But I'm glad you asked.” The woman replied in a way that suggested she was not glad at all, “This is all just a precaution. There have been reports of a change in the natural behaviour of some local organisms which has caused concern. Out of an abundance of caution we are taking robust measures to ensure nobody comes to any harm.” She said it with all the forced reassuring tone of a politician. 

“What sort of harm?” I asked.

“Harm? To who?” Lexi shuffled to the edge of her seat to interrupt me.

The woman looked at our son, “There is a concern that younger organisms have proven more susceptible. But-”

Lexi shut her off, “Younger? You mean our baby?”

The woman nodded, “To put it simply, there is a small chance you, and others around you, may be at risk from your son. You need to be vigilant in case of any physical or behavioural changes in your child. Be aware of any sudden uncommon developments such as new hair or teeth. There is a currently unidentified biological phenomenon that may cause a child to become excessively aggressive and have physical capabilities beyond what you would expect. If it gets to that stage, and it is very unlikely it will… it is no longer Harry you will be dealing with, it will simply be a threat. A threat not just to you, but to others also, that needs to be neutralised.” The woman turned and nodded to the male. “My colleague here, Mr Wilson will explain further.”

Mr Wilson sat forward and adjusted his collar, something about his demeanour suggested he was a military man. His suit was immaculate. He had short cropped hair and looked in good shape for a man in his 40’s. “In the black case is a Glock 17 pistol.” he said calmly, leaning forward to flip open the plastic case. He pulled out a black handgun and started showing me the basic functions. How to load the magazine, and pull back the slidey bit on the top to get the first bullet ready.  He talked a lot but I was struggling to pay full attention. ‘Why the hell would I need a gun to stop my baby son?’ I thought, but I just nodded along to Mr Wilson.

“There are good instructional videos on Youtube about the functions and maintenance.” Mr Wilson continued. “But it’s simple really, just point and pull the trigger. Go for a head shot if you can, anything in the body should slow it down but may not stop it. Always, always finish with a head shot. We have a shooting range on the Paragon plant site, I would recommend getting some practice and familiarity with the gun. Are you free to meet me next Wednesday for tuition?” he asked me.

“Uh, yeah, I think so.” I replied.

Lexi looked at me, her eyes boring into my conscience, “What do you mean ‘yeah’!? Are you listening to them? They are giving us a gun to kill our son!”

“Not necessarily,” Mr Wilson interjected, “there is a potential for wildlife and young pets to become afflicted too. It is better-”

“Oh great!” Lexi replied, throwing her hands in the air in exasperation. “I don’t want a gun in the house!”

“There is no need to be dramatic. It’s just a precaution.” Mr Wilson said. “Better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it. The gun is quite safe, until you want it to not be. The letter will explain further, but you have legal authority from the government to use lethal force if necessary. It is normally recommended to keep a gun cabinet but… in this case I would ensure you keep the weapon as accessible as possible. You never know when you may need it.” 

Mr Wilson continued, “I have seen the results where parents were either unwilling, or unable, to protect themselves. Don’t let that happen to you or your wife.” He placed the gun back in the case, still loaded, and placed the case back into the basket.

The woman said, “The letter has details of the very generous compensation package available in case the worst happens. Please sign it and post it back to us.”

“I’m not signing anything!” Lexi replied.

The woman looked at her, tilting her head patronisingly like an adult dealing with a petulant child, “I suggest you sign up for our support. In case the worst happens we wouldn’t want you to have to deal with events alone. When a child is involved the police, the press, family, even your neighbours… they can make the situation… messy. Paragon has the means to help.”

The pair got up to leave, Lexi stood to block the doorway. “You can’t just leave. Tell us what is going on! What is happening to our son!?”

“We have told you everything we need to tell you, Mrs Sanders." The woman said. "There are contact details on the letter, you can call our helpline if you have any further questions. There is also advice on the legal implications of making public allegations against Paragon energy, so take some time to think things through. Now, I suggest you move out of our way.” They brushed past Lexi and headed out of the front door. Little Harry started to stir in my arms. 

The woman stopped just outside, then turned and looked at Harry. “Mrs Sanders, are you breastfeeding?” 

Lexi’s face was overcome with shock and disdain. “Yes.” She snapped back, “Why?”

“I suggest you stop.” The woman replied. Then the two left.

Lexi slammed the door behind them. Harry broke into a wailing cry and, I must admit, I flinched. What is my son capable of if Paragon has given us a gun to deal with him?

“A lot of bloody good you were!” Lexi said to me, storming back into the living room. She went straight for the letter to read it through, and picked up her phone to call the helpline number. I followed, rocking Harry to try and soothe him but it didn’t work. His face was screwed up in a rage, his tiny hands clenched into fists, his arms outstretched and shaking. I took a bottle of breast milk from the fridge to placate him and nervously pressed the teat against his lips. 

Lexi got through to an operator and had then been transferred through to an automated system, but was kept on hold. She paced around the house in a rage with the letter, reading and re-reading it, then asking me questions I couldn’t possibly answer. The tinny automated hold message repeated between bouts of easy-listening music. The baby basket remained untouched on our coffee table, the gun case inside it.

I watched Harry cautiously as he slept, breathing softly in my arms. While Lexi wasn’t looking I scrolled through my phone looking at instructions and tips on how to use a Glock 17. Just in case. A familiar smell rose and I took Harry to his room for a nappy change. As I was tidying up. Lexi came into the room calmly and rested her head on my shoulder. I leant my head on hers in silent sympathy. For a moment we just breathed together, tranquillity amidst the madness.

Then the silence broke, “What is that?” Lexi says. She points to a thick dark hair sprouting from Harry’s smooth belly. I look my wife in the eye. I didn’t know what to do. She did. “I’ll get the gun.” she said.

We are still waiting for the helpline to call back, standing outside his bedroom door. We put Harry in his cot but he won’t sleep. He isn’t crying either. He just waits. Lexi holds the gun while she waits for her call to be answered. I write this here because… what else can I do? I want this recorded in case the worst happens. People need to know.

As always, I am a passenger of the process. I could get the gun from Lexi. I could end this so she doesn’t have to. I couldn’t live with myself, but there is more than one bullet. I could take charge for once in my life. Would Lexi hate me for it? Maybe she would be relieved.

I’ll wait to see what they say on the phone. It is just a hair.
