It’s never easy creating something artistic, music is no exception. I still find myself struggling, even though I’ve found “success” literally overnight. I no longer have a home, I no longer feel safe, and yet, I’m one of the most desirable DJs to exist in North America, if not the world at this point. It spread so fast. 

Someone needs to know what’s going on, and may this be the only thing you listen to that came from me. 

Five weeks ago, I had just sent off my rent to my landlord and was left with less than one hundred dollars to my name. My clothes were perforated from working my landscaping job, and I would have to wait a week until I got paid again to afford new pants that might just tear within two months' time. My stomach rumbled; it was time for another round of instant ramen. 

Keeping it blunt, I was a starving artist. 

I had no gigs lined up. I worked long hours for shit pay, but that gave me a lot of time to think about my music career at the very least. 

When it would *become* a career anyways. I was a dreamer, an idealist, no matter how much some of my friends and even my parents said that being a DJ was a pipe dream. 

My tracks on SoundCloud brought in two hundred views, Spotify even lower than that. I wasn’t going to give up that easily. 

My resilience paid off a few days later. A supportive friend of mine had sent me a link to a virtual plugin I could download. Getting new tracks, beats, and instruments always broadened my horizons. 

The website itself was pretty standard, it didn't seem like I’d get a virus by staying on one page for too long. There was something that piqued my interest when I was about to begin downloading:

**FREE PROMO EXPIRING SOON: CARNAGE COLLECTION**

I wasn’t going to say no to two free plugins. The Carnage Collection had roughly twice the amount of samples and effects that the original plugin I intended on downloading had. Oddly enough it had zero ratings, but it looked legit enough. I pondered it, why would they give away free plugins, was it garbage? 

Really, what did I have to lose at this point? I got both downloaded and went to town trying out both plugins.

I leaned heavily towards the Carnage Collection samples. Something about it tingled my brain in all the right ways. I spent the entire weekend making a track, something I never was capable of doing. 

It was as if the new plugins cheered me on, seemingly guiding me to make the best song possible. Funny enough, I still don’t remember making most of the song.

Sunday night, I posted my new single– *Tear It Up–* on Soundcloud, Spotify, and a snippet on my Instagram page that had a mere 110 followers. 

I woke up, ready to go back to work, when my notifications on my phone changed my life forever: 

*Tear It Up* had 600,000 plays on SoundCloud, 610,000 on Spotify. I had promoters and event organizers in my inbox asking for gigs. Willing to pay good money, too. They only acknowledged my new song. Their proposals were to play my new hit five times in a row. I thought it was bizarre, that’d be way too easy. 

I accepted a gig at the second largest venue in my city. They paid me high five-figures upfront! I had enough money to quit my job and sustain myself for the rest of the year. I worked one more week, then quit. 

Funny enough, my coworkers also loved my song. They said it made them energetic, and that listening to it made them want to break stuff. A bit rowdy, but good for any EDM artist to hear I suppose. 

I had come up with three new tracks over the course of my last week of work. None of them were to my memory, but playing them invigorated me. I felt my heart rate increase, my fists clenched to the point that I struggled to unclench them. I chalked it up to not sleeping well, and how could I? My first big gig was the next evening!

It had been months since I got on stage. I had no graphic team to design high-quality visuals, so behind me were solid blocks of my logo: *DJ CJ.* 

The crowd screamed in excitement when I stepped to the mixer. I was slotted in right before the headliner, so I figured the crowd was already turned up. I was too nervous to even speak, so I just smiled and began playing *Tear It Up.* I never imagined seeing the crowd go so feral for me. It made me think my next stop would be EDC, Chasing Summer, The Veldt, hell even Coachella. 

That’s when I noticed something was off, the mosh pit that formed in front was violent. During my fourth round of the song, security jumped in and got just as pummeled as the other ravers were. I could hear screaming and crying even through the music.

 A stagehand gestured for me to cut the music. I obliged. 

The crowd got angry, and began roaring at me in tones that didn’t even sound human. It sounded more animalistic.

“We’re all here for a good time!” I called out. “Go wild, but don’t kill each other, you got that!?” 

The crowd went silent, but in near unison they apologized. The rest of the night went without a hitch, although security had to haul out some of the bloody and pulped. 

I got another large chunk of cash at the end of the night. I went home feeling satisfied, but a little unsettled.

*Tear It Up* had reached 900,000 on both of the main platforms. I had four times the amount of gig opportunities lined up in three days. I decided I’d give myself a bit of time to relax, and my next show was in four days.

 My other new songs– *Hammer Down* and *Euphoric*– were also beginning to climb in popularity. They each had around 300,000 plays, and I was given the green light to play those ones, too. All of them were made mostly with Carnage Collection. 

I managed to hire a graphic artist, Clarissa, to give me new visuals. She was…eccentric, but her portfolio was amazing. She insisted on blood and violence themes, but none that would disturb the public. 

I would hear my songs blaring from Clarissa’s earbuds constantly every meetup we had. The fans were also a bit strange, many of them would smear themselves in what I could only assume was fake blood. 

I began getting recognized in public. My fans were fidgety, eyes bulging wide when talking to me. They were all polite, but looked like they were about to snap on each other at any given moment. Still, a part of me welcomed the stardom, even if I only played one show. 

The next show was at a larger venue across the country. I’d never left my province before, so this was huge. Clarissa joined me, still playing my songs on loop through the entire flight there. Three songs on loop for nearly four hours, I couldn’t even do that. 

“I really am grateful to be here,” she said, left eye twitching rapidly despite her warm, attractive smile. She put her hand on my shoulder, that’s when I noticed the massive scabs on her knuckles and her crudely chewed nails. 

“I would’ve beat my boyfriend to death if I couldn’t.”

Something in the way she said that made all the blood run to my feet. It was an awkwardly quiet time getting everything set up afterwards. I had cold feet, literally. A part of me knew something was off, and I wanted to cut the show.

My mind blanked, and before I knew it I was on stage. The crowd easily tripled the size of my last gig. The sun was setting, making the LEDs and the glowing accessories worn by the ravers pop. 

“Who’s ready for something Euphoric!?” I called out. Rabid cheering answered. *Euphoric* was a much slower song, and I noticed the crowd behaved a little more normal. Even Clarissa, who was up on stage with me, was bopping her head casually. For a moment, I felt relaxed, maybe my nerves really were getting to me.

Until I played *Hammer Down*.

Multiple fights broke out at once, and what was initially a rave became a literal riot. Men and women of all ages began duking it out. Clarissa eyed the crowd, her whole body twitching. I worriedly shot a look to the stagehands, who began ignoring me.

Fuck it, I began switching tracks.

I swore I swapped back to *Euphoric*. Instead, even louder, *Tear It Up* played.

That’s when I noticed the crowd really changing. Many of the rave goers began foaming a deep red substance from the mouth. Some jumped higher than most athletes could, and the noises sounded more like wailing banshees than human beings. I tried shutting off the track, cutting power to the mixer. 

Nothing would stop my song from playing.

Clarissa jumped into the crowd, bloody foam arcing through the air as she did. The song wanted this to happen. My legs quivered. 

Then, something flew from the crowd onto the stage, landing to my right with a sickening squelch. 

A severed head. 

Dried foam at the corners of the mouth, eyes wide, the skin was red enough to look burnt.

The crowd began cheering like normal again, all while I stood in shock. I backed off the stage slowly. I covered my ears and began to weep as I went to the backstage lounge. Fortunately it was soundproof at this location. The other guest DJs and patrons were evidently concerned, and the show was called off.

My “success” grew larger. I had enough money to buy a remote property in remote Ontario. I planned on moving there ASAP. I sent thousands to my family, warning them not to listen to my music for too long, and explaining that I’d need to hide. I actually had to. The following days, I realized the danger I was in. 

The fans would charge any sort of vehicle they suspected me to be in. Many would be so insanely eager to meet me, that they’d violently guard my posters in public, attack people that criticized the music, and they even ravaged my old coworkers so badly they destroyed some of the landscaping equipment. 

And that was when my music wasn’t playing. 

I managed to pull a few strings and get a helicopter escort to my property a week after hiding in remote hotels and sleeping in the armpits of the country. The first week at the property was blissful for a while, no internet, no music, no madness.

I miss my family. I miss my friends. I almost miss being poverty stricken, because at least then I wasn’t watching over my shoulder for a rabid fan. I know they’re coming. The obsession, the mutations, all because of my desire to make music and that fucking demonic program.

Who knows how much of the world is in this state now, because of me. I can only blame myself, and my ambition to have more than a pipe dream. 

They may know I’m out here, now. I’ve seen trampled bushes, claw marks on trees several kilometers off the property, even a dead moose that looked like it was beaten to death, not mauled. Did they track my spending records? Or do they just *know* I’m out here?

And what’s worse, in the distance I swear I can sometimes hear my songs echoing through the trees. I think they’re getting close. Looking for their next hit from me. 

If you ever see a plugin called Carnage Collection, do not download it. Success is not worth the suffering and fear that follows.
