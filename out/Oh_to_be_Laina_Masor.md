It was Monday morning when I noticed the wind stopped flowing through my window and the song of the birds drifted into a hollow silence. I lived alone, and the slightest change shifted my being. I was scared to be alive, but I was just as scared to die. I stopped scrambling my eggs and took the pan off the heat. As I walked over to the window, still unsure if what I was feeling was in my head or not, I heard something move behind me. In the corner of my eye, the velvet chair in the living room stumbled on its legs. My heart raced, and I realized I wasn’t alone anymore.

The saying "fight or flight" didn’t really capture the whole story. Some of us do neither. Some of us freeze, so grappled by our fear that our bodies stop moving. I stood there, barely breathing, unable to look behind me, unable to do anything but be my pathetic self.

“Well, I’m waiting for you to say hello, but I guess I’ll have to say it first.” A scream escaped my lips as a man twice my size entered my field of vision. He was handsome, in an unnaturally twisted way. It calmed you at first, almost convincing you there was no threat, and yet something in your gut made you uneasy.

I tripped over my own feet as I tried to move back from him, almost falling into the glass table behind me. His coarse hands grabbed my arm, pulling me closer to him. I didn’t speak, I couldn’t speak—all I felt was the cold coming from his skin, as if I had just opened a freezer.

He shook his head, curly red hair falling into his eyes, eyes that looked like a burning fire.

“Let me just get to the chase. I’m going to gift you something. Something you wish for every single night when you set your hands ready in prayer on the edge of your bed. I’ll let you become someone else, just for a couple of days though. If you’d like to be them forever, we can make a deal, you and me.”

Finally, words started to make their way out.

“Who are you, and what are you talking about?” My voice came out in a helpless whisper.

“All you need to know is that when you pray, all the gods can hear you, and usually they go about their business, ignoring all you whiny humans and your tiny wishes. But every once in a while, you’ll get a god like me, decent enough to help.”

“You’re a god?”

“I consider myself as one.”

“Why would you help me though?”

He shrugged, as if I had asked a pointless question. “Who do you want to be? You have one minute to decide before I’m out of here.” He tapped his watch.

Usually, I overthought even the slightest decision. But this time, I didn’t think. The longing to be someone else my entire life overtook me, and it was easy to tell him. It was easy to ignore that a god had made a presence in my living room, and for once in my life, I did something I was completely sure of.

“I want to be Laina Masor,” I said. He smiled, revealing sharp teeth that I could have sworn weren’t there before.

“The famous actress?”

“Yes.” I muttered the word, almost begging. His eyebrows raised, and a chuckle erupted.

“Good luck,” he said.

Then my world went blank.

---

“Well, the event is at two, and the interview is at 4:30. I really don’t think we’ll have time to see your boyfriend tomorrow.”

I sat across from a middle-aged woman wearing dark-rimmed glasses and a floral blouse. She swung a pen back and forth in her manicured fingers.

“Laina? Did you hear me?” I stared at her, unsure what to do, unsure if this was even real.

“I need to use the bathroom.” She furrowed her brows.

“Okay…”

I got up from the quilted chair at the end of the table and rushed to find the bathroom. I was in some kind of modern mansion, so open and white, with a million doors everywhere. Shit, I didn’t know where the bathroom was.

“Where’s the bathroom?” I asked the woman. She opened her mouth, ready to gasp, but kept her composure.

“To your right and down the hall on the left.”

“Right!” I said, as if she had stated the obvious.

My new feet knew how to walk in the six-inch heels I was wearing, but I almost tripped as doubt crept into my mind about whether I was even walking right. The bathroom was just as sleek and futuristic as the rest of the house, the light marble of the sink matching the floors, the walls, everything. The only color in the bathroom was the silver hand towels and the blushing, beautiful face staring back at me in the mirror.

I almost fainted. I was really her. Holy fucking shit, I was really her. Oscar-winning actress, 200 million Instagram followers, multi-millionaire—Laina fucking Masor.

My hands touched the soft skin of my face, free of any blemishes and treated with the best skincare money could buy. The eyes that stared back at me were not my own. Well, I didn’t even know what was mine anymore. I was here, in her body. It was my body now, all of it. For a couple of days, her body and her life were mine.

Holy fucking shit.

“Laina? Are you okay in there?” A knock came from the door, and I was drawn back to reality.

“Yeah!” My now high-pitched, sweet voice sang happily. I opened the door and was greeted by a new woman, one closer to my age.

“Okay, Diana said you were acting funny, jokingly asking where your own bathroom is.”

“Oh, right.” I laughed, but instead of the awkward laugh that used to make others uncomfortable, out came a laugh that gave off warmth and ease. The girl in front of me smiled, revealing perfect teeth that matched her perfect face.

“I’m just a bit out of it today,” I said, as if that would excuse everything I did now and in the upcoming days—hell, maybe forever, if I made a deal.


“I get it, it’s a lot,” she says, her hand gripping my arm in comfort. “Do you want to go to your happy place for a bit?” She gives me a kind look, offering to help. “I think if you had a moment with them, it would help you get through the rest of the day. It always gives you so much energy, you know.”

I have no idea what she’s talking about, but I don’t know anything about Laina’s—now my—life. I nod calmly, curious about what my ‘happy place’ is. Maybe it’s a private massage or a chef waiting for my order, ready to prepare whatever I’m craving.

Whatever it is, I follow the girl ahead of me, too scared to ask her name or anything about her—anything that might make me seem even stranger. Her dark, sleek hair swings behind her as she guides me, holding my hand in hers.

She gives me a gentle smile as she looks back at me, and I return it. “I know you’ve been coming down here more often than you’d like, Laina, but you need it with all the fighting between you and Lex.”

Lex—oh, that’s right, my long-term boyfriend everyone says I’m going to marry. He’s probably the best looking actor I’ve ever laid eyes on. I heard that he and Laina have been fighting, but I didn’t think it was serious. Tabloids always blow things out of proportion.

She opens a door and leads me down a dark, steel staircase.

“Plus, you’ve got so much to do today—it’s overwhelming. I get it. I can tell you feel different, out of place.”

“Yeah,” I agree mindlessly, navigating the stairs in these heels. Definitely not heading to see a chef—maybe a massage is still on the table.

“And let’s not forget about your upcoming movie… and the rumors.” Right, the rumors that I’m difficult to work with. Whatever. I’ll be nicer to my co-workers and put those rumors to rest. Hopefully, acting comes as naturally as walking in these heels.

“So, it’s okay that you’re down here again today. It’ll only take 15 minutes, and you’ll feel so much better afterward.” She starts turning on the lights, and that’s when I realize Laina has secrets darker than the depths of the ocean.

It takes me a moment to process what I’m seeing, but the smell hits me immediately. Cages filled with decaying bodies line the walls, maggots crawling around the limbs of the one nearest to me. It looks like an older man. What remains of his head tells me his final moments were filled with unimaginable pain.

I walk closer to the cages, the stench stinging my eyes and making my lungs tighten. Some of the corpses barely resemble humans anymore, mutilated and tortured beyond recognition.

I want to take a deep breath, close my eyes, and go back to my quaint living room, full of sunlight and the scent of old wood. I don’t want to be here. I can’t believe I am here.

The girl watches me closely, suspicion flickering in her eyes. She steps behind me, her cold hands making me jump as she rubs my arm.

“It’s okay, take it all in. Enjoy yourself. Remember what I told you yesterday?”

I stand there, frozen. No fight, no flight.

“We can’t feel guilty for the way God made us. If He didn’t want us to enjoy the pain of others, He wouldn’t have made us this way. And let’s be real—God made us in His image, and He’s one sadistic fucker.”

She wraps her arms around my neck, whispering calmly in my ear.

“We’re more like God than anyone else. All the wars, famines, loss—He enjoys human suffering just like we do. So why feel guilty, Laina? Why feel bad for something that feels so good?”

But it didn’t feel good. I wasn’t Laina. I was Abigail, 32 years old, working as a clerk at the local tax office. For every waking moment of my life, I had wished to be someone else. Now, I really wanted to be me.

“I got you a special gift, you know.” Her lips almost brushed against my clammy neck. She pulls away and heads to the back of the basement. I follow, forced by her grip and submissive to my terror.

She lets go of me and approaches another cage, this one covered by a dark fabric. Slowly, she pulls it back, never breaking eye contact with me.

Inside is a child. A small child, nailed to the floor of the cage. The child lays there, helpless, unsure of why it’s here—why it’s in Laina Masor’s torture chamber.

Blood pours from the child’s shattered fingers, or what remains of them. I can’t help it—a whimper escapes me.

“I know it’s not your usual type… and I might have already had my time with him, but I think this will really help you, Laina.” She hands me a knife, its blade already crusted with blood.

I look at the knife. Then I look at her. And I realize what I have to do.

I used to overthink every decision. But now, Abigail’s heart knows what’s right. Knows what has to be done.

I take the knife and slash it across her throat. Blood spills from her neck, gushing to the floor like an endless river. For a moment, I understand Laina—understand how she takes pleasure in watching others suffer. It feels good to watch this vile woman collapse.

I stand there, taking it all in, until I hear the wails of the child. The sound jolts me back to reality, and I know I need to act—now.

I race up the stairs, hurrying as if I might wake up from this nightmare any second. My mind still can’t comprehend what’s happening.

The house is a maze, but eventually, I find my way back to the open area where I first woke up as Laina.

I spot the middle-aged woman, Diana, at the table where I left her.

“Laina! What the fuck happened?” Her eyes widen at the bloodstains on my designer clothes. She stammers, trying to form a sentence.

I don’t know if I can trust her, don’t know if she’s in on whatever sick, twisted game this is.

“I need your phone. Now.” She quickly pushes her chair back, handing me her unlocked phone without question. The bloodstained knife in my hand probably explains her cooperation.

“911, this is Laina Masor. I need you to come to my house, now. In my basement are the remains of my victims. I’m a sick fuck, and I deserve to die.”

With that, I take the same bloody knife and plunge it into my throat.

The pain is immediate. Shock overtakes me, but for a moment, everything feels… right.

And then everything goes blank.

———————————————————————————-

I wake up on the floor of my wooden cottage, the afternoon sun spilling into the room.

I look at my unmanicured hands and the fuzzy socks on my feet, and a feeling of immense joy washes over me.
