I owned an Airbnb house for several years. I stopped due to the stress of keeping up with it, aswell as maintaining my actual job. 

The benefits of using Airbnb instead of renting the place out
like you normally would is that you would have the chance to make a lot more money if your
house gets booked a lot. Being in a relatively high traffic area for vacations, Airbnb was a greatoption for us. 

My wife and I were excited in the beginning, but it got more demanding as more
people booked the house. We needed to keep everything on schedule and hire cleaning
services after the first customers left and before the next ones came, as well as be sure torespond to their messages and emails in a timely manner.

 But things were going well for a
couple of years before we had what we thought was a young couple staying at the house.

Just like every other time when they arrived, I texted them the unlock code for the door. I almostnever actually see the customers after they let me know that they were inside and everything was good.

 I sat back and relaxed for the rest of my day off. I should also mention that I almost
never even talked to the customers more than just a couple texts, usually they text me when
they get there and when they leave, and sometimes an occasional question about the house,but that's usually it. 

But as nine o'clock came around and I was just about to get ready for bed, I
got a text from the young man staying at the house. It was short, saying he was going to call mein a minute, and then a minute later he called.

 I already had a bad feeling when I saw the text,but what he said still surprised me.
He said that the water wasn't working in the house. Of course, I apologized, though I didn't
understand how that could be possible.

 But living in a house without water is unacceptable, so I knew I had to get it fixed immediately. I asked if I could come check it out really quick so that Icould have someone come in the morning to fix it.

 He agreed, being very polite about the whole
thing, and I drove over there a few minutes later. Pulling into the driveway, I noticed two cars. Atthe time, this wasn't necessarily a red flag but more just an odd thing I noticed because theywere apparently a young couple on vacation for a single night, so I didn't understand why theywould rent two separate cars.

 I thought someone must be visiting them, which actually isn'tallowed, but I didn't mind so much.I walked up to the front door and knocked before entering the code and walking inside. It wasvery quiet. I expected them to be waiting for me, but they weren't anywhere that I could see. 

Iprobably should have looked around for them first, but I was tired and just wanted to get thisover with. The first thing I wanted to check was the main water valve to make sure there wasn'ta leak or a flood.

So I went down to the basement and over to the valve. Everything seemednormal, no water anywhere or signs of damage. I was confused, but then I fiddled with the valve and immediately heard water start rushing again. I turned it more, realizing it had beencompletely shut off manually.
