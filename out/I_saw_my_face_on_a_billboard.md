Julia watched the stream of coffee fall into the officer's cup, wondering if what he had just said was nothing more than a bad joke. Unable to react, an odd coldness growing inside her, she crossed her arms to warm up, but all she felt were the patches of cold, dried blood on her shirt. The only sound breaking the silence in the police station was the coffee machine, lasting only a few brief seconds. Indifferent now to the inquisitive gazes of the men standing beside her, Julia waited for Officer Fuentes to speak again, even though she knew she would have preferred to watch that thread of coffee fall forever.  
  
"So, do you want to explain yourself?"  
  
There was nothing to explain. She knew that no matter how hard she tried, nothing would sound reasonable to anyone else's ears except her own. Still, without wanting to, her mouth began to move and a strangely fragile, unfamiliar voice started to speak.  
  
"I met him by the river, on the outskirts..."  
  
It was the Santos River, a winding line that divided the more than 2,000 kilometers of forest surrounding the eponymous town. She had never passed through that area, nor had she been interested in seeing a river she had only heard typical things about, before that warm Friday afternoon, at the end of another school year. Despite being the target of insults and mistreatment from her classmates throughout the year, nothing had prepared her for what they had planned for her that day. They were going to make sure that people like her never set foot in the school again.  
  
A group of students, with the teacher’s permission, had gotten the keys to the classroom and locked the doors before Julia could leave. What followed could only be remembered as a series of fleeting images and sensations that her mind had preferred to bury. Thousands of hands holding her down. Markers piercing her skin. Scissors cutting her clothes. By some miracle, she had managed to escape that hell and jumped through the window before her captors could catch her.  
  
She ran through several unfamiliar streets, pushing her way through a crowd of people shouting curses and attempting to land a few punches. Despite this, she reached the forest and, finding no other option, decided to take refuge there, both from the scolding she would receive from her father and from the gangs that came out at dusk.  
  
At one point, she had reached the Santo River, drawn by its murmur, and fell into a deep sleep.  
Later that night, she was awoken by the sound of a voice. When she opened her eyes, Julia saw the figure of a thin, ragged boy beside her. He tried to approach her, adjusting his square glasses, to which Julia threatened to throw a stone. She asked who he was and what he wanted. The boy, silent as a stone, did not respond. It wasn't until Julia let go of the stone that he spoke, if that tiny, brief voice could even be called speech. He told her his name was Boris, that he enjoyed spending time there by the river and visiting the abandoned cabin nearby, which he preferred over his parents’ house.   
  
He asked Julia why she had come there and why she was in such a state. She, in tears, told him what had happened, how she hated being different from the others and being unable to do anything about it. She had promised herself she would leave the town and go to the city one of these days. Boris, meanwhile, just comforted her. Noticing the night sky, Julia realized that any possibility of returning home before her father’s police shift ended was lost.   
  
She had heard that the gangs that came out at that hour targeted people like her and made them disappear. She didn't remember ever having met one, aside from her mother, and since she had died, she had lost hope of ever meeting one again. Despite this, Boris, who had heard the stories as well, offered to help her.  
  
After bringing a blanket and a bat from the cabin, he covered Julia, moved by the gesture, and together they left the forest and made their way back to town. Fortunately, that night, Julia managed to get home in time.  
  
In the following days, Julia took every opportunity she had to go to the river. For the first time in her life, she had made a friend, a real one. Since she could remember, the only person she had been able to talk to without fear of being judged was her father, though she still remembered the countless times in the market or park when he had made an effort to distance himself from her while interacting with others. With Boris, it was different. In those first days, they could talk about anything for hours and hours, though she always led the conversation, with their feet submerged in the cold river water, with nothing but the arrival of night interrupting them.   
  
By the river, she couldn’t be hurt; she was safe from the gazes, words, and hands. Eventually, deep things, repressed emotions, became routine. At least for Julia; for Boris, it was easy to listen, but he never talked more than about his breakfast that day or his rock collection. Moreover, he seemed to not enjoy much physical contact. Every time Julia tried to get closer, he would pull away, and he didn’t respond well to friendly punches or even greetings. Still, there was one thing they both agreed on.   
  
After the incident at school, Julia held onto her decision to leave the town, and together with Boris, she started saving money for what would be the most important day of her life. Every day, without fail, they would put a coin in a jar that Boris used to collect stones. At first, they were content with tips from their parents or coins they found under furniture, but it didn’t take long for them to realize that they would need more than that to reach their goal.   
  
The first coin Julia stole from her father was from his desk, the change from some insignificant purchase. She felt that being the daughter of a police officer somehow gave her a certain freedom to do some things, and what began as a couple of coins quickly turned into bills. She never knew how Boris got his share, but at that moment, it only mattered that he did.  
  
One morning, Julia found Boris walking along the riverbank, muttering things to himself. With a strange excitement, he told her that he had an idea that would solve all their problems. He spoke of Libertad Street, on the other side of town, where there was the only gas station they had. The owners would leave their son in charge that night, a boy who was not all that bright. They would take advantage of the opportunity to empty the cash register and leave the next day.   
  
It didn’t take much to convince Julia. And so, at dusk, they followed Boris’s plan to the letter. They arrived at Libertad, both wearing caps to cover their faces, carrying a trash bag. The deplorable state of that part of town was evident. Julia noticed the piles of trash, the burnt poles, and the thousands of papers stuck to every inch of walls and doors, faded by time, with a few illegible words in red being the only thing distinguishable. Thick letters that spelled a curse to the image of something wicked, now practically invisible. Seeing all this only made them hurry. They entered the gas station, distracted the poor boy in charge without much difficulty, and in less than five minutes, left the place with a bag of bills. Julia hid them under her bed at home, waiting for the right moment to use them.  
  
However, the right moment wouldn't come soon. When Julia was ready to leave, Boris wasn't, and when Boris was ready, Julia no longer was. A week passed like this, postponing her departure for the smallest reasons just to savor one more day of the comfort of routine. Meanwhile, the tickets continued to wrinkle under Julia's bed.

One sunny morning, while cleaning one of her windows, Julia noticed a figure lurking behind the tree in her garden. She told Boris about it during one of their daily meetings. She could tell it worried him by the quick change in his expression and what he said. He told her he had suspected something was off with that gas station, but hadn't believed it was true.   
  
He had heard that one of the most dangerous gangs in town, The Blue Brothers, had been seen on Libertad Street. It was likely they'd already taken over the gas station and were looking for the culprits behind the robbery. Boris urged Julia to close all the curtains and leave for the city as soon as possible. Understanding the danger she was in, Julia knew her repeated delays had to end. She'd go home and pack her things once and for all. Before leaving, she told Boris she would see him the next day at the same place to coordinate their trip together. He gave a small smile and simply said yes.

The first thing she did was close the curtains. She spent the whole night packing every piece of clothing, book, and ticket she had, hiding her only suitcase under the bed. When she finished, she intended to sleep, but then she heard someone knock at the front door. Cautiously, feeling a chill run through her body, she went to check. In the living room, her father slept in his armchair, with the TV on, showing a news program filled with shouting. Julia found a note at the bottom of the door. "WE FOUND YOU." She couldn't sleep the rest of the night.

The next day, Boris reviewed the message, which only confirmed his suspicions. He asked Julia if she was ready to leave, if she knew the way, and how to survive outside. She said yes. She felt ready, but that feeling only terrified her. The rest of the day, they avoided talking about the subject, instead laughing and discussing the city and what awaited them. Julia thought about the ice creams, all the flavors. She would never have to be kicked out of ice cream shops again or only taste the ice creams thrown at her, falling to the ground. Boris listened to her all afternoon without saying a word. He nodded, smiled, and rubbed his hands. As evening fell, Julia asked Boris to walk her home before saying goodbye, but he had to refuse. He needed to return home soon that time.

Walking quickly through the streets of Santo, Julia couldn't remember feeling so vulnerable since the incident at school. The blurry papers on the walls and the burned debris from darker times never made her feel so sick. She managed to read one of the papaers. The word FUCK had never been so clearer. Another one wasn't so different. LICE. Then another one. SHIT. KILL. DEAD. She turned onto the street that led to her house and spotted a familiar figure in the distance. When she realized who it was, her body froze. Behind that figure, three others came into view, and together, they began running towards her. Julia turned around and saw three more figures approaching.   
  
Surrounded by the group, Julia braced for the worst. The first person she saw was the first to approach. He was a young, thin guy, wearing a leather jacket and a blue bandana tied around his left arm. In a quick movement, he grabbed her by the hair with one hand, and they all started laughing. After shouting some horrible words Julia preferred not to remember, he threw her to the ground and began kicking her repeatedly all over her body, amidst a wave of insults and mockery.   
  
On the ground, trembling from the pain, she looked up, and a flash of light blinded her before she lost consciousness. She spent three days in bed recovering from her injuries. Her father had found her bleeding on the ground, in the rain. It caused him great pain to see her in that state, but he chose to keep the incident a secret. He brought her food to bed and checked on her constantly, and Julia, feeling the suitcase on her back, couldn't look him in the eye or speak to him.

On the fourth day, a Friday morning, Julia took her suitcase and left the house without waking her father. She planned to spend the whole day by the river, waiting for Boris to arrive. She heard him approach after a few hours. Seeing her injuries, Boris, perplexed, came over to check on her but didn't touch her. He bombarded her with questions that Julia didn't bother answering. She just assured him that she was fine, that it had been an accident. She hadn't come just to inspire sympathy.   
  
She showed him the suitcase and the tickets inside. It was time to leave. She had nothing else to do there, and he clearly wasn't busy with how early he'd arrived. They wouldn't have a better opportunity than that. Julia asked him where his bags were. It didn't matter; she'd wait there until he brought them. Despite her excitement, Julia gradually noticed that Boris, as silent as ever, didn't share her enthusiasm. Defeated, she asked him one last question. "You will come, right?" The silence that followed only confirmed what she feared. With tears in her eyes, she repeated the question over and over, trying to grab Boris's shirt, but he pushed her hands away. At one point, Julia grabbed his shirt so forcefully that he gave up, and she, as close to him as she had ever been, kissed him on the lips. Boris jerked away from her and, with eyes filled with rage, spat on the grass before running toward the trees.

It wasn't unusual to find the streets near the main road empty at the time Julia arrived, but that day, they looked like something out of a ghost town. Walking leisurely, replaying the conversation in the woods in her head, she realized she had reached the intersection of the main street with Libertad Street, the gas station illuminating the horizon like a giant lamp. Guided by a morbid curiosity, she turned onto that street, thinking she would reach the road through the gas station.   
  
Under its lights, she glanced at the elderly receptionist couple in the shop and walked toward the road. However, the silhouette of a man sitting by the shop's door stopped her. He was just a drunk, finishing the last drops of his bottle. But when his arm entered the light, and she noticed the blue bandana tied to it, a bitter sensation grew in her mouth, and she couldn't bear to keep watching any longer. The papers, naturally, were everywhere, and she could easily cath the words from the corner of her eye. FUCK. She dropped her suitcase on the sidewalk and walked towards the man, not taking her eyes off him. DAMN. She grabbed his shirt and lifted him with all her strength to see his face. It was him. The same guy who had beaten her senseless. KILL. KILL. KILL. She dragged him several meters into the darkness and began kicking him in the stomach, not holding back. He barely tried to defend himself with his bottle. Julia took it from his hands, smashed it on the ground, and drove it into the guy's stomach, making him groan in intense pain. Without pausing to think, in a state of irrationality, Julia stabbed him with the bottle so many times that sprays of blood splattered all over his white shirt. Even at the gas station, the guy's and Julia's gut-wrenching screams could be heard. Someone called the police, and within minutes, they ended that bloody scene.

“… and you brought me here. That’s it.”  
  
Officer Fuentes takes the last sip of his coffee and lets out a small laugh. He glances at the body in the next room without saying a word. Tired of the officer's silence, Julia demands an answer.  
“That’s why I’m asking you to tell me the man’s name. The real name.”  
“I’ve already told you. That man over there is Boris Durán.”  
  
Julia can’t help but laugh. She knows that Boris is with his family, probably regretting what he did in the forest. The officer begins to explain the details, trying to reason with her. He tells her about his criminal background, his connections, his modus operandi, and how he managed to deceive her for so long. But Julia doesn’t listen. She thinks of Boris, regretting what he did in the forest, crying in his bed like a baby. He always was a baby. The way he spoke so slowly. His aversion to touching others. His thin frame, tangled hair, sad eyes, those giant glasses that made him look stupid. Those stupid glasses. The glasses that blinded him when they reflected the sun.  
  
Officer Fuentes orders that she be taken to the police truck. A case like this had no place in a court like the one in the village of Santos. They would try her in the city. They would televise it, turn the whole process into a horrendous spectacle, but the law would be carried out. She could trust the city for that. Before leaving, he turned to Julia’s father, standing beside her.  
  
“She’s your daughter, right?”  
  
“Unfortunately, yes, sir.”  
  
On the road, Julia thought about everything Boris was missing. Things hadn’t gone according to plan, but at least she was on her way to the city. She would see the buildings, as tall as the sky; the cars, floating down the streets; and, most importantly, the ice cream shops. She couldn’t stop imagining the flavors, endless, but equally delicious. She only worried they wouldn’t let her visit the ice cream shops. She had to find a way to get there. Would there be ice cream at the courthouse?  
  
Peering through the grilles that separated her from the driver, Julia got her first glimpse of the city. It was unlike anything she had imagined before. The buildings were taller, and the cars, faster. The police truck entered a highway that seemed to have no end, where thousands of cars and people moved in perfect harmony. Julia observed, from inside this metropolis, the concrete and metal miracle in all its splendor. But something in particular caught her attention. Attached to the buildings, hanging from the bridges, and even projected into the air, thousands of billboards decorated the landscape. And on each one, differente faces, yet, in an way, the same one, appeared, accompanied by symbols and words Julia couldn’t read or simply didn't bother to anymore, bold words in a deep red, words that only inspired death.  
  
“It’s me! It’s me! It’s me!”
