I used to post here much more often than I do now. This community changed my life in ways I never imagined. I am not a famous Hollywood star or a big movie producer, but now I write for money more than most people work at their jobs.


Lately, my life has started to change, and I wanted to share these changes with people who understand. I have not been completely honest with myself or with the people around me about where my ideas come from.


You know the saying, "Great artists steal"? It is a bit like that. I got lucky as a writer and a Data Hoarder. Many years ago, I decided to save some important websites for myself. I backed up some subreddits and some porn sites. 


I started to read this subreddit a lot and noticed something funny.  60% of the stories here are deleted within two years.


People delete them. Maybe they think they’ll get a better audience somewhere else. Maybe their egos get bruised when you morons fail to recognize their talent. Or maybe something else happens. I don’t know, and I don’t care. What I do care about is what I found: a writer buried in my archives. Someone good. Not just Reddit-good, but real good. The kind of prose you submit to literary magazines, not the usual trash you guys make. 


I tried to find them. Searched here, searched the web, and even dug through collections from other hoarders. But somehow, I was the only one who caught the stories before they disappeared. Everything in one month in late 2017, and then—nothing. 

It all disappeared


I tried to look him up here a few times and on the web. I even searched through other copies of the subreddit, but somehow, I was the only one who found the stories he wrote in late 2017.


I searched for his work everywhere. During that period, life felt particularly unstable for me. I’ve always had a tendency to be abrasive with people, a trait that doesn’t exactly endear you to employers or colleagues. As a result, keeping steady employment became increasingly difficult, and the stress of it all started wearing on me more than I cared to admit.


So I did what anyone else would do. I copied and pasted them, set up a Buy Me a Coffee, and got back to finding work. I mean, the original stories barely scraped 10 upvotes, so who cared? With my prescription of Adderall keeping me sharp while I juggled jobs, I cranked out one story a week. And everything changed.


Everything.


They all blew past 50k upvotes in a matter of days. People started reaching out—fans, and producers after the fourth one. Even a few strange messages. But who cared? My life was changing fast.


At first, the weird messages were just the usual nonsense you’d expect. Except for one.


Someone out there knew.


They didn’t make a big scene about it, no accusations, no demands just a single message: I know who you are.


I ignored it. Why wouldn’t I? Especially when Blumhouse flew me out to LA, and suddenly I was sitting in real meetings, talking about real projects. It wasn’t serious, I thought. Just another internet weirdo trying to mess with me.


But LA was different. So different. The lifestyle, the people. It was like I’d walked onto a different planet. Adjusting was hard. Still is. And it got a hell of a lot harder when this freak decided Reddit wasn’t enough.
They found my phone. Started texting me. Calling. Weird, static-filled voicemails. Then, somehow, they found my rental.


It started with knocks at random times of the day. Then it was my car—deep scratches along the side while I was at the studio. I tried to ignore it and I told myself it was just LA, just bad luck. But after the movie hit streaming and I finally had some money to my name, things got worse.
I figured I’d get a mutt to keep an eye on the house. the first night on the job, it got killed. Blood sprayed across my front door like a warning.
The cops said it was fans. Fans. I laughed in their faces and cussed them out as I stared at those words again.


**I know who you are.**


I had to figure out who was behind this. I had to stop it.
The Adderall wasn’t doing shit anymore. I couldn’t sleep without it, couldn’t function with it, and now everyone expected me to push out another 'subversive horror masterpiece'. But I was running out of stories from the subreddit. 


Would they really notice if I tweaked them a little? Maybe put them through ChatGPT first? Just smooth out the details and make them mine?


So I did. We had a new concept to work on.


That’s when everything fell apart.


The first time I heard it, I had just gotten a prescription for sleeping pills. Popped one, drifted off—and then I was ripped awake, my whole body shaking as a voice tore through me:


**"I KNOW WHO YOU ARE!"**


I ran. Grabbed a bag, and got a motel. I tried to keep working, but the studio had had enough. They told me I’d still get credit, but my services were no longer needed. I was losing everything important to me.
I laughed. Drank. Told myself it was over.


It wasn’t over.


I knew something was wrong the second I got home and saw the cops waiting for me. One of my neighbors had apparently seen someone who looked like me fighting with something inside my apartment. They called it in, wanting answers. I tried to explain to the offices I’d been out drinking all night, but they weren’t buying it.


“Let me just hide the dildos,” I said mockingly as I stepped inside, trying to make light of the situation. But the moment I crossed the threshold, my blood ran cold. Everything was tossed about, furniture overturned, drawers emptied, and there was a trail of blood leading straight to the closet.


Against my better judgment, I followed it. Inside, I found the neighbor’s dog dead, its body mangled beyond recognition. Before I could process what I was seeing, the police burst through the door, having spotted the scene through the window. The old lady next door wailed like an animal in mourning as the officers began searching the rest of the apartment.
“I swear, it wasn’t me!” I insisted, but they already had video evidence proving I’d returned earlier that day. It was me on camera, but something felt off. Something didn’t add up. No matter how much I protested, they hauled me down to the precinct.


It wasn’t anything serious at least not legally, but I knew exactly what was happening. That psychopath, whoever they were, was sending me a message. They weren’t just accusing me of stealing those stories; they were showing me what they were capable of. And if I didn’t act fast, this was only the beginning.


Desperate, I decided to hire someone to handle the problem for me. Tsfendas—a Greek South African fixer with a reputation for solving messy situations in LA. He seemed like the right man for the job. I told him everything: the stolen stories, the strange messages, the escalating harassment, and now this… frame-up. He listened intently, his expression unreadable.


“This isn’t complicated,” he said finally. “We find the guy, rough him up a bit, and send a clear message back. Easy solution.”


For a few days, I thought things might actually calm down. Then came the morning I woke up in excruciating pain. My sheets were soaked in blood, and when I reached for my mouth, I felt a tooth loose on my tongue. Panic surged through me as I stumbled to the bathroom mirror. 
There, staring back at me, was a face I barely recognized. Blood smeared my lips, my gums raw and my neck bruised. But worse than the physical pain was the realization sinking in: whoever was doing this wasn’t playing games anymore.

They were taking pieces of me. Literally.


I headed down to the sitting room and found Tsafendas with a friend. They looked even worse than me. Wide-eyed, shaking, barely holding themselves together. They jolted awake as I stepped in, muttering something that sounded like Dutch.


"What happened to me?" I asked.


Their eyes darted to mine, filled with something between shock and horror. "You're still alive?"


They trembled, moaning like they were in pain, and then without a warning they bolted. Stumbling, bleeding, their clothes soaked in red. I wanted to stop them, to ask what the hell was going on, but then I saw it on their necks.


Deep carvings ran across their skin, jagged and raw, like something had been etched into them. Words.


**"I know who you are"**


I haven't been home since.

At least I’m not alone in the hospital. But I need help. Someone has to help me find this person.


I need to explain.


I need them to know—I regret it. All of it.
