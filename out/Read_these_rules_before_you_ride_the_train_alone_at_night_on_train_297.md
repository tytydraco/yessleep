My name is John and I live in X town where I live is a small suburban city in the state of Florida USA. The place where I live is only fields and trees, of course my family is also one of the farmers in this land. I've lived with my grandparents and my father here for almost 18 years, I've also been quite familiar with life here such as driving a cart to build corn, feeding the cattle in the morning and bringing them home. barn... I studied at a nearby high school, although I had to divide my time between studying and working as a farmer, I still tried to study for my dream of becoming a doctor. 

All the work went on and on until I got my admission letter to a university in New York city. I'm glad I don't have to do the same seemingly repetitive tasks anymore. I said goodbye and left my hometown. When I arrived in New York, the first thing I did was find myself a dormitory near my school, but it was very expensive. So I had to rent a cheaper place 50 kilometers from my school. Far away, at that time I was very discouraged because I thought I would have to get up early to go to school on a bicycle that I bought for 300 dollars, the money that I accumulated to pay for tuition and other fees for school. living expenses such as rent, electricity and water. I was shared a room with my friends: Gangly, Tom and Jordan respectively. I complained to them that the distance from our area was so far from the school that I have only a bicycle buy from a nearby store. While sighing, Gangly took a neatly folded A4 sheet of paper and handed it to me and said:

"There is a train station 500 meters from my dormitory, John, you can cycle through and send it back to your uncle's house."

 I am almost inspired to live, I am happy and constantly thank this new friend, Gangly said:

"There is a train schedule for each time frame, you opened the paper I just gave and carefully read what I wrote in it. Remember to read carefully to avoid losing that life."

Weird, I think this newbie is a bit weird, but I didn't care much because I knew I didn't have to ride my bike very far. After that, Gangly turned around and said:

"Well, I shouldn't be late for my friend's birthday, when Tom come back with you, you know his weight is not high, maybe he takes a taxi thought, can you help him, bye."

Gangly slam the door in my astonishment. I took the paper and glanced at the clock, it's only 19 pm, I'm pretty tired today too, I'll probably take a shower and wait for Tom to come back. Gangly's words always echoed in my mind:

"Must remember to read carefully to avoid losing your life".

I immediately opened the paper in my hand. Inside the paper was a side of the time frame for the arrival and departure of the train and a map of the city. And on the back side... a strange rule table. What the hell does it write? I concentrated on repeating the words inside the piece of paper it said:

"RULES YOU WANT TO SURVIVE WHEN TRAVELING NUMBER 297. Remember to read carefully what is written and memorize it quickly."

Note: if you go in the time frame from 6pm to 3am every Friday, please note the following:

 [ ] Rule 1: When you step on the train at this time or already on the train to return to the station, please be careful. The first thing you should do is choose your right seat near the back row. This will be related to what 3a is about to talk about and avoid the following compartments (2, 5, 7, 9).

 [ ] Rule #2: (Especially prepare a white chalk with a little fresh blood, this will save your life when you make a fatal mistake). When there is an old women, she about 80 years old with small body, a hunchback and leaning on a white cane, comes over and asks you to give up your seat, you absolutely should not do it, instead of saying a polite refusal, sit quietly as if nothing happened. And don't be surprised by her because when you don't respond, she will walk to the door of the train and disappear. If you accidentally get up to make room for her or have any feedback, quickly take a chalk and draw a circle around you, put some fresh blood on the already drawn circle and close your eyes and pray that you will be safe.

[ ] Rule number 3a: Train 297 often experiences emergency power outages instead of sitting there in fear of the dark accompanied by hissing sounds coming from the last compartment. Stay calm, bring a flashlight and make sure your phone still has a battery to use because then the only light in the train come from you. Forced to sit at the back of the train because when the power goes out, those things will come to you and you can't think what will happen to you. Point that light directly towards those monstrous sounds. Hold for 5 to 6 minutes you will be safe.

[ ] Rule number 3b: If you accidentally sit in the first or middle position of the train and fall into a temporary power failure, quickly follow the rows of seats and try to hold on to yourself not to let the train's inertia make me fall. In case the train goes too fast and makes you fall, please keep your posture when falling and try to hold back the pain of falling from above because if you make noises or make whimpers because of pain . No one can ensure your safe return.

[ ] Rule number 4: The train will often go into another dimension. You can recognize it easily when looking out the window of the train. Sometimes it's going to lands, seeing creatures you shouldn't see, these dimensions will fluctuate for about 4 to 6 minutes so just sit back and don't bother it.

[ ] Rule #5: Make sure you still have your ticket when you're on the train because a conductor will come to check on you when you board. If you see an employee with no face but only a mouth full of sharp teeth, don't panic. Tell that guy: "Wait for me for 2 minutes, I'm looking for the ticket, maybe it's lost somewhere", and when there is a signal that the employee is gone, wait patiently for another 2, 3 minutes. At that time, there will be full faces to check your ticket. Don't be foolish to give the ticket to that faceless employee because when you hand over your ticket to him. You will be taken to a new location, you get off the train at a strange station and never returned.

[ ] Rule 6: If you see a group of people coming from the compartments of the train moving towards you, try to get up and go against the flow of people. Try to wriggle, or even shove them to get to the nearest compartment that is not the compartments (2 , 5 , 7 , 9) choose your own seats according to instructions number 1 and 3a.

[ ] Rule number 7: During the train ride, absolutely do everything possible to keep yourself awake, because this is necessary so that you can respond to emergencies as well as avoid falling asleep when you arrived at station, because once you fall asleep the train will keep rolling and it will surely take you somewhere out of this world.

After reading it, my head jumped: 

"What the hell is that? It's just a train ride!"

So I folded the paper and put it on the back of my phone case. I am muttering:

"So nonsense !"

A little while later Tom came back, I also helped him to bed, he was still awake. Sitting for a while, the weird rules that popped up in my head again, I hesitantly asked Tom:

"Do you know the rules that Gangly gave me earlier? I feel it's really... silly?" 

Tom was silent for a long time, then took a sip of water and said:

"You should do exactly what that paper says, inherently everyone in this city memorizes these rules and gradually gets used to it. It must be said that only people like you, tourists or those who come here for the first time, our job is to ensure the safety of them and you too."

After that, he fell asleep, I got a call from Gangly and Jordan told that they were going to spend the night at his friend's house. That night, it was just me and drunk Tom. Actually that night I couldn't fall asleep, my mind was full of "the number 1, the number 2..." I was even more worried when I finished school and worked part-time at a small Pizza shop until 11pm at exactly the same time as trip 297 appeared. 

I got up immediately and prepared some books, study tools and didn't forget to take my flashlight and charged my phone. Today is Friday, a great day when I get to experience being a student at a prestigious school in New York. I have to say it's great, I'm extroverted so it's easy to make friends in the early days of school. After school, I rushed to Pizza Trevor, change my uniform and start work but accidentally forgetting that I was about to face something scary today. 

It was already 22:30, and I also cleaned up the shop with the brothers and sisters in the store and then went home. While I was changing, my phone rang a few 'beep, beep', it rang for a long time. I think it's late at night and still no one is texting me. I quickly changed my clothes and checked my messages. Mostly it came from my grandmother and my dad too and there was... Gangly, and Tom too. They told me to be careful and keep a cool head to handle the situation. I was startled to remember the piece of paper.

Then whatever happens, I rush to the convenience store next door and buy myself a cup of black coffee. Surprised salesman:

"It's so late, but you still order yourself a cup of strong black coffee?"

I stammered: 

"Because I have to go home to finish the deal, I still have to stay awake to take the train. I'm just afraid that I will fall asleep when I get to the station."

The staff member seems to have understood the problem, immediately come in and give me 2 gum bars and say:

"Please take care! Stay calm in all situations."

After chat, I took it and moved to the station. It was dark, the atmosphere was really gloomy and it gave me a feeling of spines in my spine. I slowly reduced my breathing rate, took a deep breath and exhaled evenly. I do the same. Suddenly in the distance I heard the sound of the train engine, sounded like it was screaming, like hundreds of hyenas that had been starved for days. I began to break out in a cold sweat, shivering slightly. When the door opened, I quickly climbed up, followed by two young men and a girl. 

As soon as I entered the train, I immediately chose for myself the last row of the carriage, holding a coffee cup and backpack. I put the backpack next to me and took a sip of coffee. I have never felt so pressured like today, this is the first time in my life that I have encountered such a situation, many times in my hometown I have been attacked by wild animals to the point of injury like tiger and leopard, but this time I am very worried. The two young men who followed me sat across from me with a very relaxed attitude, even joking too. Looks like they are tourists. I see that they don't have any fear on their faces, which are still… very normal. And… the girl was sitting next to me and I seemed to notice that she also had a bit of fear in her actions. With the upper hand constantly rubbing on the handkerchief and occasionally looking at the clock. 

The train is already rolling, the train is running very normally and I feel my heart rate is right on its beat. Looks like I didn't have that feeling for long. Suddenly, a man dressed as a ticket officer with…with…with a white face without eyes, nose, ears and eyebrows, just a mouth with sharp teeth sticking out like wolf. That person said:

"Ticket, please?"

At that moment, I was so scared, I was about to reach into my backpack and pull out a ticket and give it to him. But I turned to look at the girl next to me and heard the sentence: 

"Wait me for 2 minutes I'm looking for the ticket again, maybe it's lost somewhere".

My head seems to be awake again, I remember the piece of paper, I hurry go through the album that's saved on my phone and open it up. The words were exactly the same as what the girl said. I do exactly like her. After "it" finished listening, he quietly and left after only 5 minutes of standing and looking at us. I exclaimed:

"That's disgusting!" 

Just like the rules said, when the full-faced staff came and checked our tickets, I felt a little safe in that moment. I glanced at the two young men sitting across from me. They…they…they gave “it”. The train runs through the tunnel - the tunnel is very dark. About 5 seconds later, the train came out of the tunnel. I was surprised, the two young men from earlier had disappeared, leaving only 2 backpacks and a few personal items. In just 5 seconds they are gone, unbelievable! 

As the rules announced, what dimension they were lost in. I panicked really! But also try to stay calm, try to stay awake to deal with such difficult situations. The lights started flickering, dimming and then gradually turning off, my brain was like a pre-programmed computer. I hurriedly took the prepared flashlight, the girl next to me also hurriedly took the phone and turned on the flash. At the end of the compartment there was a whistling sound like the wind, shrill and something was screaming, it seemed that they were very hungry. She and I both shined the light from the two devices into the last compartment and caught my eyes at that time were monsters, they were chained with chains and tried to get out, making horrible sounds. and was panicking when we flashed the lights. I almost vomited when I looked at them, my hand holding the flashlight was out of the way but fortunately the girl next to me took my hand and navigated into the strange creatures. Calm! Calm! I told myself to be very calm. Fortunately, 5 minutes later they gradually disappeared, the screams disappeared. I breathed a sigh of relief: 

"What the hell is going on ?"

I turned to glance at the girl beside me, as if I could sense no fear in her expression. Seems to be used to these things. So much going on makes me feel suffocated for a split second. I quickly took a stick of gum and put it in my mouth and tried to keep my breathing calm.. Suddenly the train was going at a tremendous speed, speeding so fast that it caused inertia that made me lose my balance and fell to the floor. painful way. I was about to say: 

"Damn it".

I was about to say it when the girl leaned down and covered my mouth with her hand. I was surprised and looked at the girl. The two things that caught my eye at that moment were the girl's face with a panicked expression with her eyes glaring at me and by the look of her mouth I guess she said:

"Shut up". 

And a creature with chained limbs, chained with two pairs of eyes wide open in horror looking at me and opening his mouth wide open. I seemed to want to faint on the spot, the girl continuously without making a sound kept trying to scream in the silence:

“Hey, calm down, I know you see something disgusting but you need to calm down. Hey, damn it, your mind needs to be clear. Try to keep your mind clear now or we will die.”

I remembered the rule and tried to keep my falling position when I fell, although it hurt, I still tried to resist it. It was really painful, but the horror in front of me made me want to die. It crawled and crept slowly behind the girl, crawling to the floor and… and looking straight at me. I looked at it, my heart was pounding like it was about to jump out, its mouth was full of blood and its eyes looked lifeless. I closed my eyes and prayed that I wouldn't get eaten by it, at least. He looked at me then glanced at the girl beside him, he began to feel the silence overwhelm him. He turned to the front cabin where he heard a girl's cry and then there was no more crying, only silence. I slowly got up and climbed into my seat and sat unconsciously still. 

The train kept moving and I felt it, the train was going into another dimension and I saw it again and something more horrible than it was. My body was exhausted with sweat that didn't stop flowing, these horrible experiences I had never seen before. I was about to take a nap, but since I drank coffee earlier, I couldn't sleep. I remember why I drank that water and I just prayed that I could get home safely. The announcement came from the loudspeaker on the ship's cabin:

“Our train will arrive at Wine station in 2 minutes, please check your luggage and prepare to get off at Wine station. Please rate your trip by scanning the code right in front of our train door. Your satisfaction is the driving force for us to continue on the journey to accompany you.”

My heart feels like it has been saved by God. I quickly stood up and ran to the door of the train. And I saw, I saw an old woman, she approached me asking me to carry her bag. I am an extrovert and always help others, so I took the initiative to help her and forgot that I violated rule number 2. If I could come back alive I would tell you more about what I went through.
