I’m different. Not broken. Different. Knew it, before I understood what it meant. Trying to be what my family wanted me to be, suffocated me. I just am. But they refuse to hear it. Everytime I tried it felt like talking to a wall.

That night my sister gave me a makeover, at the noodle stand. Looking at myself, amazed by my beauty, I felt empowered. I recognized myself. The banyan tree swooned like the strangers admiring my radiance as we wandered the nightmarket stalls. We stopped by the anime stand. Flipping through a copy of *I Want to Eat Your Pancreas,* it happened.

“Hey,” he smiled, “Is it okay if I cry now?”

“As you like,” I purred.

“Oh my god, you two,” my sister snorted.

The three of us laughed, bonding over manga. He walked us home stopping to make a TikTok on the walk home. He tried to kiss me, but he reeked like an ashtray. Innocence. Shame, the farthest thing from my mind. 

My parents, tending orchids, met us at my gate. I introduced him. It wasn't even serious. My heart raced. But their faces froze. The look in their eyes said it all.

“What are you thinking,” father hissed, cornering me. “I will send him home.”

“We didn’t do anything wrong,” I pleaded, “Why won’t you believe me?”

Mother whispered, “You’re inviting trouble to your life.”

They worried the world would look at them as failures. Because I was too much for them to handle. Too much for them to accept. I guess I was too much for him too. During the fuss, he melted into the streets. Can’t blame him. Not long after, I did too.

The slamming door put a full stop on the argument. Grounded, their furious whispers slid beneath my bedroom door. I cried myself numb into a hollow sleep.

Life carried on as usual. Getting home from school, the neighbors stopped me at my gate.

“There had been an errand,” the auntie tip-toed.

“I hope they’re buying some Mee Shay. I’m starving,” I chuckled.

Her husband took over as the auntie broke down sobbing.

“There has been an accident. They are all gone,” he muttered, comforting his wife.

The air turned to glass and me on the wrong side of it, screaming.

Orphaned, I wandered for what felt like years searching to make sense of myself. The community opened its arms, pulling me into its fold, into its fight. An organizer, Ko Tin, found me at a tea shop.

“We’re organizing a protest,” she said, sliding into the seat opposite me. “To remove Section 377 from the law. We need bodies.”

“I seek peace, Ko Tin. Not a protest,” I sighed.

“Our people need voices to stand up and fight!” she pressed, “How can we have peace without first fighting for the right to exist?”

My stomach growled, interrupting her. Embarrassed, I blushed. 

“Fighting begets more fighting,” I shrugged.

My phone buzzed with a notification. A news alert. I showed her the video of a collapsed building in a town north of Mandalay.

“Tragedy,” Ko Tin hissed, “This country’s literally falling apart.”

Another sharp pang of hunger hit me, this time accompanied by a vivid image of Mandalay Mee Shay noodles.

“Yes,” I nodded, “I... I could go.”

Ko Tin looked skeptical. “To Mandalay? And do what?”

“Find a decent bowl of noodles,” I quipped, “It’s better than standing here with a sign. It’s something real.”

Walking away, pulling up bus schedules on my phone, I told myself I was going to help. 

And I did. 

On my day off, I hunted the market stalls for noodles. It led me away from the main road, down the side streets. Pulling me by an invisible cable to the nat pwe, a festival of spirits. Familiar, like walking home, but in a new place. The feeling stirred inside me. Maybe it would be different. Maybe here I’d find my place.

I entered the ceremony, the air laced with cheroot cigars and flowers. The drums echoed in my chest. My body moved of its own accord. Jerking. Swaying. A puppet dancing to the rhythm deep in my bones. The nat spirits took control.

My sight blurred as the bells trilled. They sounded like laughter. Mocking my mortality. Craving a voice. A hostage in my own body, I lost the sense of time. The nat pwe’s fervor muffled as I drowned into oblivion.

What’s happening to me, I tried screaming.

“Thank you… for letting us in,” a voice answered, “Now you belong to us.”

The vision unfolded like a montage. Hundreds of shrines dripping with blood. Mangled animal carcasses writhing beneath others like me speaking in tongues. A king ordering soldiers to destroy shrines. Monks preaching no harm. Worshipers conforming to new norms. Starving nats insulted. Earthquakes swallowing cities. Floods washing villages off maps. Endless wars. Battlefields drinking the life force of my people.

“Even peace has a price and we hunger. If you don’t offer it freely,” the voice answered, “We will take it.”

Releasing their possession, I found myself cradled by a nat kadaw, spirit wife. My mouth tasted like smoke. I hate smoking. A handful of aunties smiled at me as if sharing an inside joke. Shaking. Violated. I staggered to my feet.

“First time, eh?” the nat kadaw hummed, “Ignore the nats too long and they get grabby.”

“Why me though?” I nodded.

"People think you are broken because you are not a wall. But walls are for keeping things out. We are for letting things through,” they explained, “The spirits... they cannot speak to walls. They can only break them."

We walked back towards the main street as I tried to make sense of it.

“We are doors, not walls,” they chirped, “Think of it as a blessing.”

Unnerved, but comforted, her words rang with truth. This must be the place, I thought, my home. My purpose. Asking me if the spirits gave me any messages, the words flew from my mouth like uncaged birds. But that look. The same look my parents wore the night I brought the boy home from the market.

“Keep it to yourself,” the nat kadaw hushed me, handing me a water bottle.

“But…” I protested, “We can stop the violence. If people only knew…”

“You think you’re the first?” they huffed, “We banned the old ways ages ago. Now only radical practice them in secret.”

“Wait… You know but keep quiet?” I pressed.

“That’s enough,” they hissed, “Our place is to witness, translate and mediate. The last thing we need is to upset the Buddhists.”

“What’s in this water?” I winced, “Tastes like smoke.”

“It’s just water. Don’t be dramatic,” they barked.

This time it flashed like a thought. I saw them on their back staring back at me from the pavement. Eyebrows raised, muttering something I couldn’t make out.

“Are you okay?” they asked.

I told them what I saw. They laughed it off, called a drama queen. My stomach growled and they suggested a curry station across the street. I paused. Tried rinsing the taste of cheroot from my mouth. 

The bells rang in my ears, so loud I didn’t hear the break squeal. Or the impact. But the screams linger in my mind. Looking for them on the other side of the road, I spotted their slipper by the bus’ front tire. I dashed towards the gathering crowd.

“He just came out of nowhere,” the driver rambled.

Deja vu. The nat kadaw staring back like I saw it. Their blood pooling in the cracked pavement, seeping into the earth. Seeing me, their eyebrows lifted. I put my ear to their mouth.

“Warn them,” they whispered.

A policeman asked me if I knew them. I confessed. 

“You’re one of those crazies,” he scoffed. 

“No. Believe me,” I begged.

“Shut up. Before I take you in for unnatural offences,” he sneered, “Plenty of gays like you in the prison.”

It happened again. The smoke. The ringing. This time I cried at what the nats showed me. A room of people wailing over a row of people shrouded in blankets. Some of them cursing the war, others blamed themselves. 

My fingers and toes turned to ice. The police officer’s head shook as he turned away. 

Sheltering in silence, I kept the vision to myself. Stumbled back to my hotel room in shock. Crashing on my bed, my stomach panged. I forgot to eat again. Half way through my TikToks, I recognized the blankets. A woman adjusted it, revealing the corpse’s face. His face. The boy from the manga shop. 

Why me? I just want a peaceful existence. 

But the nat’s words gnaw, “Even peace has a price…”

So here I am. Using my voice because silence permits violence. Begging everyone to live the truth. Before… Before the nats take everything. Please.
