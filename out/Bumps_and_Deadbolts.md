Fair warning I am not much of a writer.... hell I ain't even much of a reader. But this is what happened.



I live in a small town bordering the woods, and like most small towns, it's boring as hell. Almost nothing ever happens here, but when something does, almost everyone knows—well, most of the time, anyway.

I'm sure anyone else who lives in a community like mine can relate. It's generally filled with a few people who actively get things done and others who seem to exist solely to waste your time.

Mostly, it's harmless—old ladies gossiping. Like, yes Bertha, we all know June and Dave are getting divorced. And old men telling tall tales. No, Jim, you didn't see a forty-pointer three springs ago.

No one recalls the most annoying man who ever lived here—or at least, they don’t want to.

I never claimed my time was all that valuable, but I still did my best to avoid getting caught up in all of it. Still, even I occasionally got roped into the latest town gossip or a well-spun yarn. But even the chattiest of Kathys avoided Frank.

Frank was pleasant enough, aside from his droning voice and his uncanny ability to never talk about anything that ended with a point—or anything resembling reason. Conversations with him were a slow descent into endless nothingness.

Once, he spent over an hour explaining the best way to make French toast, breaking down the process as if it were a life-altering discovery. By the time he was finished, the only thing he’d actually accomplished was making everyone wish they’d never eat French toast again.

Frank was the epitome of normal. Like everyone in town, we thought we knew everything about him—not just his love of French toast. He lived alone at the edge of the woods, worked at the tire shop every day except Sunday, and never seemed to break from his routine.

So when he was found dead in his bed, it came as a shock.

The rumor mill went into full effect, but according to the coroner, Dave, it was anaphylaxis.

"It's the most bumps I've seen on anyone!" he said a little louder than intended.

Then, in a hushed whisper, "According to his medical records, he wasn’t allergic to anything."

He continued, "I spoke with the chief, and they didn’t find anything that could have caused it. He pretty much only ate TV dinners, and they didn’t find any pests or anything else that could’ve triggered the reaction. I should know a lot more when the toxicology reports come back."

The reports were due back the following Tuesday. I knew something was up before I even hit Main Street—I could hear the murmurs, voices carrying in hushed tones.

A random woman said matter-of-factly, "Well, at least she won’t have to keep paying the lawyer."

One man shook his head and proclaimed, "It’s a damn shame."

By the time I reached Main Street, it was clear: Dave was dead. And no one knew how or why.

I was hanging out near the barbershop when I overheard someone say he had bled out. But no cuts or slashes had been found—just the bumps.

After Dave’s death, time just sort of passed as normal. After the initial flood of rumors, the new coroner blamed it on mosquitoes and allergy medications, and town gossip returned to its usual routine—who’s been seen with who, and deer the size of mountains.

Frank was mostly forgotten entirely until a family moved into his old home. I hear their kids get teased from time to time—"You know someone died in that house, right?"

Now, Halloween was approaching. And every town needs a boogeyman, I guess.

Nothing of note happened until spring. It started as a trickle—one or two people a day visiting the doctor, complaining about strange, itchy bumps. It never ramped up into something big. Maybe if it had, people would have actually paid attention.

Each case was small, only three or four bumps at most. But the locations were bizarre—between the fingers, the bottom of the foot, right inside the edge of the nostril.

I wasn’t one of the first to experience it. I didn’t believe it until it happened to me.

Oh god, the itching. The fucking itching was unbearable. If I could have taken an acid bath and stripped my skin away, I would have.

The only relief came at night when I took the dose the doctor had given me. At first, I hesitated—after everything that had happened to Dave and Frank, who wouldn’t?

But doxylamine and diphenhydramine did the trick.

It took four months for the damn bumps to finally disappear.

The following spring, the bumps came back. But not everyone got them this time. I was one of the unlucky souls affected, but blessed to only have one on the sole of my foot.

Others weren’t so lucky. They ended up with ten to twenty bumps spread out on one side of their bodies.



The first to go missing disappeared about two weeks after the bumps started reappearing around town.

It was one of the kids from Frank’s house.

We searched the woods, the town, called in volunteers from around the county—but not a trace of him.

Sleeping one minute, gone the next.

Two days later, he was found screaming in the tree fort behind the house. His left leg was a bloody mess, skin and flesh scraped down to the shinbone.

His fingernails—broken and missing on both hands.

To this day, the kid hasn’t spoken. He’s been in and out of mental health facilities ever since.

Word around the barbershop is that, when he’s alone, he has a habit of going *bzzzzzz... bzzzzz...* Constantly.

After that, I’m sure deadbolt sales at the hardware store shot up—but it didn’t matter.

Two days after he was found, the next person disappeared.

By then, rumors had stopped flying. No one lingered on Main Street anymore.

People went to work or school and then went straight home.

The next poor victim was a waitress from the diner.

She was working a late shift, but something happened between the last customer leaving and when she should have locked up—because locking up never happened.

She was missing for two days before they found her, halfway to the next town.

Her back was a mess. Her shirt was torn to shreds, along with the skin beneath it.

It looked like she had slid on her back, all the way from our town to the next.

But later, we found out her lower back had never touched the pavement.

The bumps were still there.

Shortly after her release, she left town—never to return.

No one is sure what happened while she was missing.

Next was Gary from the hardware store.

I guess even with all the money he made selling deadbolts, the poor son of a bitch never thought to install one himself.

It was the same pattern as before. He went missing, we searched, and two days later, he was found.

They had to take him to the city hospital for reconstructive surgery.

When they found him, his eyelids were swollen shut. He wasn’t sure where he was, or how long he’d been locked in the backroom of the hardware store.

The poor guy had gouged his own eyes out.

He doesn’t remember much.

But he does remember the buzzing—the incessant, gnawing sound that never stopped.

A while later, a hunter from a few towns over went missing.

During the search for him, police uncovered a storm cellar in a burnt-out shack.

Inside, they found a bunk, a table, and a woodfire stove.

Among the collected items was Gary’s ID.

At some point during the investigation, the place somehow went up in flames.

Police reported finding syringes filled with doxylamine, diphenhydramine, and D7 proteins.

They believe it burned so fast because the rags were soaked in brake fluid.

Despite everything, the hunter was not found anywhere near the shack.

When they finally located him—far from town—he was alive.

No bumps.

It’s been years since it all happened, but today on the news I heard the state will be introducing UVL sprays to control the bugs.

I also found a bump.

And man, does it itch to the bone.

You’d think with everything that’s happened, the creep in the cellar would be the most annoying person in town—but no. That was still Frank. Fuck, Frank.
