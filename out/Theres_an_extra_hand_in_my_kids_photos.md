I paid to get professional photos done of my kids. They follow some weird variant of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: only one of them is ever smiling at once. I thought maybe it was time to bring a professional in and stop having to photoshop different heads on the kids for their Christmas cards.

Everything went fine. We had a nice outdoors session at the edge of the woods. My son and daughter hugged each other, smiled, posed, the works.

Everything was fine…

Until I got the photos back.

As I looked at them, I noticed something. “Hey, Frank,” I said, “doesn’t it look like there are two hands there?”

He leaned over the computer. “Well, yeah. That one’s Isabella’s, and that one’s Jack’s.”

“No, Jack’s hand is over there.” I pointed. “He didn’t put his arm around her. He refused. Remember?”

But it was obvious. Isabella was putting her hand up to her shoulder… and there was a hand *underneath* her hand… even though Jack’s hand was clearly hanging at his side.

“I guess she made a mistake,” Frank continued. “She was probably trying to Jack’s hand around Isabella, but then forgot to photoshop his own hand out.”

I frowned. “I wish she told us before she did that. It looks kind of… weird.”

The hand under my daughter’s didn’t really look like a child’s hand at all. It was too big. Just where was this woman getting her stock images?

I continued flipping through the album. I stopped to linger on a photo where Jack had, finally, wrapped his arms around Isabella. She wrapped her arms around him, too, and they were both looking at the camera. Perfect picture.

Except.

Except there was an extra hand on top of Jack’s.

Just two fingers, laying over his. I wouldn’t have even noticed it if I hadn’t seen the first hand. I called Frank over again. He began to laugh. “Well, I guess she’s using AI.”

“I… I don’t think so,” I said. “I mean, those are Isabella and Jack. How would AI make that?”

“No, there are things with AI now, where you can upload a photo and tell it to do things. Like, make it a LinkedIn picture, or remove the background. And it often changes things even when you tell it not too.”

“That’s… a big privacy violation,” I said, my heart starting to pound. “I don’t want their pictures in the system.”

I called her up. I probably should’ve given her the benefit of the doubt, but I was so angry by that point that I just started yelling. “You have no right to upload our photos into some AI,” I told her.

She sounded near the point of tears. “I didn’t do it. I swear. Please—please don’t write a review.” Then she paused. “Wait—I’ll prove it to you.”

The photographer, Janice, came over an hour later. She showed us the original files on the computer and their metadata. She showed them on her camera’s screen. In the originals, I saw the extra hand under Isabella’s, the extra fingers over Jack’s.

*She could be faking it.*

*But she seems so sincere.*

When Janice left, I felt even more confused. I flipped through the photos again, staring at the extra hands. They *had* to be AI. They *had* to.

We finally put the kids to sleep. Frank and I relaxed in front of the TV. “It’s just so weird,” I said, unable to let it go.

“I know.”

An hour later I went up to check on the kids.

And froze.

Isabella was, as usual, sprawled across her bed in a chaotic fashion, her hand hanging over the edge of the bed.

Coming up from under the bed, there was another hand.

Holding hers.

I screamed and flicked on the light. There was nothing there. Frank came running. I told him about it—and he burst out laughing. “You’re going to start having nightmares about these things,” he chuckled as he got on his knees and checked under the bed. Then the closet, then Jack’s closet and bed.

There was nothing there, of course. Nothing at all.

I couldn’t sleep that night. I kept checking on the kids. I kept thinking about hands. Hands attached to emaciated corpses hiding under beds. Hands attached to serial killers breaking into homes. Hands attached to nothing at all, scurrying across the carpet like spiders.

I finally fell asleep.

But I woke up with a start at 3 AM.

As I shook off the fog of sleep, the first thing I noticed was that Frank was holding my hand. Something he never did while we slept. I turned over, back and forth—and it took me a second to realize that the hand attached to mine wasn’t attached to Frank at all.

I screamed, and the thing seemed to disappear in the shadows of the covers.

We checked everywhere. Everything. There was nothing in our room, nothing in the house. But my own hand was pulsing with pain, and five bright-red scratches were across the palm, bleeding.

“I can’t do this,” I sobbed. “I can’t.”

My hand felt tingly and weird and numb.

As we waited for police to show up, I flipped to my phone and looked at all the security cameras. No one had entered or exited. There was nothing there.

Except…

I noticed the footage at our front door from the previous day, when the four of us had gotten home from the park.

There was a hand on my shoulder.

But Frank didn’t have his arm around me.
