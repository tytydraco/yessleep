I’m posting this to share my experiences growing up living around and in these mountains, as per my therapist's request to write it out.

I’ll be honest, I don’t think she’d approve of the public setting, but I guess this is what she’s gonna get.  The location, as I imagine most aren’t familiar with the area or its culture, excluding one major thing;  you’ll figure out what that is when I spell out the geography for you. The Uinta mountains are in the northeast part of Utah and lower Wyoming; from Salt Lake, it’s 2 hours to get to the forest and 7 for the actual mountains. 

It’s full of Red rock, Aspen, Cedar, and several types of Pine with extremely high temperatures and very cold nights. 

I think personally it’s important to know the landscape and what I’m working with before I break down some rules I had growing up. I’d also like to explain how Utah is known, one for which I’m most certain you know is the LDS church. However, what’s not talked about is the bloodshed in this state and how recent it is. With wars and killings of the local indigenous population lasting well into the 40s.  If you ever visit or even if you live here, you can feel it and, depending on some legends you can hear it.  I’ve heard the joke that the whole state is haunted my entire life but I digress. 

I grew up About 10 miles from the forest in a religious household of, let’s say, mixed ancestry. Lots of our practices were the basic Christian beliefs, but we also incorporated stuff passed down from generations. I’m adding this to bring to light why some of these rules were in place.  

Rule number 1: When the sun sets around the mountains, it’s time to go home.  If you are alone, get inside as quickly as you can. 


Number 2: Never say your name when you’re alone, as someone can take it. 

Number 3: Do not talk to it if you cannot see its face 

Number 4: Do not whistle at night 

Number 5: Do not go into the Unintas, and most importantly, do not take anything if you are out there

Number 6: keep those damn blinds shut.


 I had asked my grandma about these rules when I had grown old enough to question them, and when asked about the mountains, she’d say 

“The blood is fresh and the mountains are young

They are angry 

 They are starving.

That forest will swallow you whole.”


Even with all those warnings, my teenage self would go against every single rule. However, I’d like to preface this by saying 
most of these stories happened from 2006-2008 in my dad's old farmhouse while I was a kid, but I have more things to share that happened well into my late teens. If anyone is curious, I’ll be more than happy to share them.

Now here’s where I begin, I’ll try to put these in order in my memory, as I was very young here. 

As I told you, I had grown up in a small farmhouse, but the area was very rural, with the house being surrounded by large purple mountains and golden fields of long dry straw. The only house besides my dad’s was my cousin's house, which my father used to own and was built in the 1800s. My cousin has her own stories here, and I’ll be sure to interrogate her for further information. 

My father’s house was small. White and with what I imagine leaded paint and two large windows in the front with a long winding path that leads from the front porch all the way to a long, desolate dirt path. The rest of the yard was covered in towering juniper trees and a large crab apple tree in the center with pink, twinkling blossoms that would crawl alive in the summer.   I think of the place fondly despite the waking hell that my life was; I truly miss its beauty.

Behind the house was a moss grass lawn with a stone wall circled by more of the dry straw fields.  The house itself was unassuming, with small hallways and a basement that smelled like old plaster and earth. I spent most of my time at my father's here, as my parents had a long and messy divorce, and to put it plainly, my father was not a good man at this time, and neither were the wives that would come after. I’ll be vague about the abuse I witnessed under their hands, but you should know that I was never allowed to be seen by either of them, and I was forced to stay in the basement. 

My first memory of the paranormal was when my mother and father were together. I was really young then, so this would have been maybe 2006?  I had been lying in my bed one night, the day before was long and draining as it had been a funeral for my grandmother on my father's side. I was tired, and the wind would howl strong enough to creak the ever-aging frame of the house. I, being no older than 6, was terrified as the trauma of the death,  the screaming of the wind and the spider-like trees against my window was enough to frighten any child. Of course, as someone so young, sleep will find you no matter how hard you fight it. I wasn't sure how long I slept. The storm was still raging, and when I awoke, a white light filled my room, bright and almost blue. The walls became hard to look at, and I scrambled to see where the origin of the light was, but as I looked to the window, I heard something behind me, or maybe it was closer to a feeling. I woman was calling to me, saying my name with an almost dry cackle as she laughed. I saw her shadow. Long, rotted arms with spider-like fingers and ratted hair extending out to touch. I felt her eyes and how they peeled back my skin.

The wind continued to scream as each finger extended, stretching painstakingly and ridged, all to caress my shadow. Her voice only grew louder, her breath cold and damp as I began to turn my head. 

I awoke to a scream, but not from me. 

My parents were making their daily rounds, and the sun had entered my window; I was now losing all hope of comfort from a parent. I remember lying back down on my pillow only to find a dead moth beside me with ripped and tattered wings.

The nights of my parents' marriage went a lot like this; it became routine, and when I stopped fearing the woman, she had stopped visiting.  

That was when things stopped being a dream.
Growing up on a farm meant that I had an old dog that would help around the area, his name was Bear, and he was was lab chow mix.  I’d like to say fear not, as he lived a good, long life of 17 years, nearly a decade after this story. 
Bear would like to run in the straw fields if he wasn’t home hanging with me or my father, he’d be outside somewhere, and every day before the sun would set, my dad would whistle a very loud, singular note to call bear home.  Often he’d do it at night too, sometimes he’d come home late from work or church and much to my mother’s dismay and he’d whistle crisply into moonlit fields.

My parents were busy people; my mother was a waitress, and my dad did whatever he could. So I was often alone most days and nights.

It was a school night during this event, and I had put all the animals back into their old pens and, of course, called Bear back into the house with me. It was a cool fall night, pungent with the smell of rotten leaves and wet earth

I remember the brief glance I took to the mountain with its loud silence and domineering display changing from green to purple a the sun set. It was like any other night. I brushed my teeth after a poor dinner of buttered bread, some sort of unlabeled soup, and went to my bedroom with Bear close behind. Bear wasn’t allowed to sleep in my bed, but I let him during cold nights because I had no phone then, it was 2006 and I lived in an area with no cell service, so my only option was to sleep. I was only 8 so I slept with the lamp on.  My bedroom windows blinds were up I think my mother had let them open to let some sun in. I hated the reflection that you’d get in the window with the lights on during the  night. I had gotten nervous staring back at myself in them and promptly closed the blinds.

After they feel onto the window I heard a whistle. one long, singular note that seemed to echo in the still night.   

Then another one. Loud and echoing, for 5 terrible seconds only to be left with silence. No crickets, no rusting of my animals. Just quiet and my lamp lit room.  

I waited then, I had to make sure I was prepared so I wouldn’t get startled any more than I was. I tried to settle down and ignore it.  I laid down in bed waiting with unnerved fascination.

Tap. Tap. Tap. 

Three taps at my window and I just stared at it. I felt my heartbeat in my ears, and I felt my throat go red.  

And it just kept tapping.  First three, then one, then three again in succession.  My hands felt like Ice,  I was shaking and bear started growing at what ever was making the noise. But he didn’t run to the window or out of my bedroom; he just stayed next to me, seething at the window. 
 
It stopped almost as quickly as it started. Gravel started crunching as if someone or something was walking away. But instead of it getting farther, I heard it walk up the long dirt road, each crunch in groups of two as if it was walking on more than two legs.  It found my front door, I heard it, how it opened the screen door and how slowly it creaked. It just kept opening and closing. Opening it slowly, then slamming it with so much force I felt the shake of it in my room down the hall. Over and over until it found the Handle. The door wasn’t locked but it played with the handle as if it didn’t know how to use it.  Scratching, turning and pulling the door handle and the screen door in front still opening and slamming harder as the handle kept shaking. 

I wanted to run to the door I wanted to lock it before it came inside. I wanted to look and see what it was, but as I got up to run out of my bedroom, Bear bit my arm and held me there. Growing and angry, but not at me.  He didn’t break the skin, but he held my small wrist in his jaw in a way that he definitely could if I moved.    I couldn’t even cry as I was so scared, and I’m in so much pain. All I could do was shake as it moved from the front door back it started banging on my window so hard I’m surprised it didn’t break. Banging scratching gnawing and screaming.  With one final blow to the windows with a sound that can only be described as throwing its full body at it, with a terrible bang and crack. 

There was silence.  

No more slamming, no more tapping, no more banging.  But the crickets hadn’t started chirping, and Bear still wouldn’t let go.   I heard a loud bone-breaking crack. It sounded like twigs and bones being snapped in half, but it was wet. I can’t figure out how to describe it besides just wet and brittle and so very loud.   It sounded like it turned into a sprint with multiple steps and the crunching of gravel running far into the field’s outside. 

Bear released my wrist and licked the small wound while settling back into the bed. 

but far off into the fields a masculine sob echoed into the night. Not a cry but a single wailing  with what can only be described as my father’s voice.
