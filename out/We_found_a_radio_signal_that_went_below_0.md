It all started in college- I was the techie, i loved electronics and i picked it as a major in college. todd was the scientist, he would find rationality in every little itty bit of any unexplained phenomena- jess, who picked a major in history (she loves unexplained things and conspiracy theories, i never put todd and her together in a hangout unless its something that piques the interest of all four of us) and finally- ryan, the radiologist. we were always hanging out together since college, and when we find time in our work lives to hang out we would.

ryan's uncle, michael was also a radiologist, he was a war veteran, he encrypted communications and occasionaly sended out distress signals. ryan always spoke highly of him as he was the one that inspired him to be a radiologist. but he doesnt talk about him that much. he threw himself into supposed "work", he wouldn't eat, wouldn't sleep for days on end. ryan used to tell us that he became a shell of a man that he once was, and his wife would almost always hear static and clacking from the tv in the room.

later on, he hung himself in his room- a shock to all of his family and friends(who, he cut contact with for years now). i remember ryan getting the call and him getting pale vivdly just two months ago. 

"I just- i can't understand why he would- would do this". Ryan said at his funeral alongside many murmurs from the family sitting beside us.
"Honey, it's allright, he was a war veteran, right? he was possibly traumatized." jess said and hugged ryan. i still remember the way he cried when he was lowered into the casket.

Later on, in his will, he left the house and his property and everything he owned to his wife and kids, except for ryan.
he recieved a radio. a single, battered up radio.
on another night some days prior to this, he took us all into his home where he had brought the radio to.

It was a military shortwave radio- a solid state one, at that. i told him obviously this was used in the cold war. there was something about it that just put me off.

it was covered in dust and rusted contacts, and upon closer inspection it had a few missing parts as well.
taking in the fact that this was his uncle's last memoir and the fact that he was worried an electrician might damage it in some way, he entrusted it to me, and i took it as a huge deal in our friendship.

After propping some whiskey up the table and turning on a lamp, i got to work.
(there are some electronic jargon in here, pardon me) 
Opening it up, i found burn marks on the circuit . Strange, i thought. nothing should have overloaded. huh.

I cleansed the corroded contacts with isopropyl alcohol and a brush and took a swig towards my whiskey again.
After checking for dead resistors or diodes with my trusty multimeter, i found a damaged frequency dial. like someone forced it to stop at 0 khz. 
there was something wrong with this radio, but i wouldn't budge. i had to fix this. 

When rewiring the circuit i noticed some really strange things about the radio as well. there was an extra component in there that shouldn't exist, but i soon found out this component was essential for the circuit, so i didn't do anything to it. i just left it be. it was also soldered in a way that didn't match the original schematics! honestly i was kind of freaked out by that point.

So, after painfully restoring the dial and restoring it with a fresh battery, i pressed the push button switch to stop transmission and i left it in my room. Tommorow when i was on my way to work i woke up a little extra early and dropped it off at his house. i mentioned about the radio and he raised his eyebrows as well. i bid him farewell and days passed. 

Until we gathered together again.
we were at our favorite place to hang out, a cafe that's quite near to my workplace. ryan was obviously thinking about something so we nudged him. he suddenly woke out of his trance and nudged us to follow him. we got in our cars and followed the guy, who parked his car and ran into his home.

"John, what did you do to the radio?" he asks the moment i step into the room.
"What? I didn't do anything. are you kidding me right now?"
"Okay. then explain this." he turns around and shows me the radio i fixed just days prior. it transmitted a normal signal, the usual static you would hear on any normal tv, until ryan said "the radio should be off. It is not turning off."
"You think i did something to make it to do that?" I said.
"Yeah! well i gave it to you to repair it!" he yelled. 
"Look I didn't do that!"

Todd went forward and did something with the radio, generally just turning the dial, but i was too busy yelling at ryan.
"Guys..." was the word todd had to utter before we turned to the radio.

the dial showed -1 khz.
WHAT. THE. FUCK?
all of us just stood dumbfounded at the thing. radio waves shouldn't exist beyond 20khz, atleast for a human to hear it. So what is wrong with this radio???

And it transmitted.
It was this clacking sound, overlaid with static, looped again and again until it made this horrible sound alltogether.

Ryan was the first one to freak out,
obviously.

"this shouldnt be... transmitting anything. if its at 1 khz HOW CAN WE HEAR IT???!!!" he yelled at us again.

none of us had any words to say. nothing could explain the radio.
"This might be a malfunction.. the dial-" i began. 
"Yes- Yes that must be it!" ryan said .
But deep down i knew nothing was wrong with the dial.
i guess everyone else knew as well.
None of us said anything for a few moments after.

I rushed toward it and unplugged the battery. IT WAS STILL ON.
i fell back in shock after, and looked at the radio in disbelief again.
 The clicking mercilessly invaded our ears, and our hearing buzzed and jess wrapped her hands around her ears and head to stop it.
The clacking stopped suddenly.
All of us got tensed, and for good reason at this moment.
it started to rumble, and my heartbeat raced. i dont know about the others, but mine was all right.
the sound formed into a decipherable one- 
AND IT WAS US.

"TURN OFF THE RADIO! DO WHATEVER YOU CAN! DONT LISTEN TO THEM! dontlistendontlistendontlisten" said all of our voices together, garbled and warped.

Jess was the first to run out. I was the second. I got in my car, and i started up the car and bolted it towards my home. i heard random clacking from my car. i swore under my breath about faulty engine valve lifters, but when i turned off the car to go look and check, the clacking still persisted.
in my ears.
in my face.
in my eyes.
it gets worse whenever i get close to an electronic device. 
my ears are practically red now from sitting near this laptop too much, but i want to let the world know.
this may be the last post i ever make, but i hear it.
yesterday, jess hung herself and i need not state here why. but the clacking....
the clacking.
in my breath.
in my walls.
it is here.
it was always here.
and i hope i'm not next.
