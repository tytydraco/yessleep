Another year and it’s almost time. Christmas is almost upon us and before that Christmas eve. Everyone has their own holiday traditions; in my home town we have our own as well. These traditions are observed every year without fail. Not just because it is tradition, but because if we did not something bad would happen.



The small township I live in lies in a sparsely populated area of the old country. I will not disclose where to keep everyone else safe from trying to investigate around this time of year. But it is a beautiful and idyllic town 364 days a year. It is just one day that we have to prepare for, that day is Christmas Eve.



The towns records do not give us much insight on when exactly it started. The Blight, as it was called, began around one hundred and fifty years ago. Every year since then, terrible things would happen the night of Christmas Eve and then disappear the morning of Christmas. The toll that would be reaped on the town was devastating. Many people left, and those that could not or would not, began the tradition that we uphold even to this day.



The tradition, is called The Vigil.



My role in this tradition is to play the part of a watcher. It is a role most of the able-bodied people in the town have. The watchers hold the Christmas Eve vigil and guard the members of the town who try to hide from the nightmare that ensues.



What we watch for, well that is the disturbing part. The things that come out at night are some form of creature. They never show themselves at any time other than that one night every year. But on Christmas Eve, they are drawn to us somehow and they are not peaceful.



Fortunately, they are not indestructible and we have successfully killed many in the years that we have had to defend the town. However, all we have learned about them was paid for in blood. No attempt to capture one has been successful and the bodies of the slain decompose and dissolve before by daybreak.



Thinking about the things I have seen in past years makes me shudder. I try and prepare myself for tomorrow. As I think about how to prepare for the next few hours, I find myself remembering the horrible night last year. A night where the blight cost us all dearly and one that makes me fear that they are getting worse each year now and we may not be able to hold out forever.



Last year's vigil began as they often did. The watchers would take our families to the church in the center of town, then make sure our family and friends were properly secured. Lastly, we would exit the relative safety of the church and move to the perimeter of the town and wait for nightfall.



I remember leaving home with Sally and the girls. Sally and I spared them the worst of the details of what really happened at night on Christmas eve, but we did have to stress the very real danger. Most children had to be kept secure in the warded basement of the church, it at least had some means of supernatural defense against the things. A strict curfew was in place as well, to prevent any stragglers from being subjected to the things the blight had in store for us.



Just as we were leaving, I saw my brother Jason heading to the church as well. I greeted him. We all continued out into the cold night, a gentle snow had started to fall and we knew it was going to be a long one.



We moved into the once bustling town center and everything was already eerily quiet. The streets were empty, and the only sound that could be heard was the soft crunch of snow underfoot.



In the center of town stood the old church looming above us, its steeple reaching towards the dark sky. Hopefully all of the townsfolk would seek refuge when the time came. Some refused to leave their homes and we tried to cover as much area as we could, but we could not be everywhere at once. The people knew what was coming, and most knew there was only one place that could offer them any semblance of safety.



Inside the church, the pews were filled with people huddled together, clutching each other tightly. The fear in their eyes was palpable, and the only reassurance they had was the heavy wooden doors that stood between them and the outside world.



Jason and I said our goodbyes and goodnights to our families and prayed we would see them again at dawn on Christmas day. We left the church and I remembered to place a large red bow on the door to the church. For some reason this helped keep the weakest ones out, the larger ones though.......well we had to look out for those most of all.



Jason and I arrived at the outskirt's lookout around 10 pm. Our group of about twenty watchers waited in silence for the events to unfold. I gripped my homemade spear tightly in my hand. We had to rely on very specific weapons to combat the unique threat posed to us each year.



For some reason modern weapons would not affect the horrors that stalked the village. Only fire or weapons made out of the wood of evergreen trees could wound or kill the things.



At around 11pm we saw movement near the outskirts and we knew they had arrived.



Jason called out to all of us, looking out toward the edge of the forest by where we had set up the signal lights. He lowered the binoculars as he spoke,



“We have grinches.”



We knew what that meant and we raised the spiked palisade barrier and prepared our spears. They shambled through the small field separating the watch post from the forests edge. The first several walked right into the spiked palisade and died impaled and clueless. The rest weaved through the gaps in the barricades like water breaking around and over a boulder in a river.



They came on and we struck out at them with a successful charge of our own. The first wave was slaughtered but there were many more that slowly marched towards us. A rank smell emanated from them and I thought that the name we gave them was apt, since these small creatures were very mean ones indeed. They were violent and gross, smelling like death and despite the plodding pace they moved at, they could suddenly enter a frenzied state and rip someone apart in a matter of moments.



Another larger group attacked us shortly after the first and three got past the line of spears and went berserk. We stopped them before things got too bad, but it was already getting ugly.



We managed to put down the rest of the grinches and only Charles and Abner had been injured. Though their wounds would need to be sterilized promptly as the vile claws of the grinches would quickly cause an infection.



The injured men were treated and we were all surprised a larger wave of foes did not show up. The previous year we battled for over an hour before the grinches were diminished enough to stop attacking. Something felt off this time. Then to my horror I saw Grayson’s body turn to ice in an instant, then shatter into thousands of pieces. It was my turn to shout a warning and I screamed at my comrades,



“Frost Fiends!”



We shouldered our spears, or put them down and lit out torches. There were even a few of us lucky enough to have brought aerosol flamethrowers. The grinches attack was over, but a new wave of creatures burst out of the thin layer of snow forming on the ground around us. These were the "Frost Fiends," or Frosties as we sometimes called them. They were humanoid figures with icy blue skin and razor-sharp claws. They moved with an otherworldly grace, their eyes glowing with an ethereal light. Though they could eviscerate us with the icy talons they possessed, they were uniquely deadly for their ability to turn unprotected people into ice. Only holding a torch or being near fire seemed to keep them from freezing us.



The other watchers paused in both shock and terror over Grayson’s sudden death and the appearance of three Frosties at once. Normally we might see a single freezing killer in our midst, but three at one time was very bad news.



Before we could blink the Frosties were moving and Charles and Abner, who had just been patched up after the fight with the grinches, were swiftly decapitated by the impossibly fast monsters. Jason grabbed the aerosol spray and the lighter and took aim. A frost fiend that was rushing towards us let loose a terrible shriek as the jet of fire engulfed it and quickly melted its frozen body to a puddle of steaming water.



The other two were already moving, trying to slay the source of the hated flame. I lunged forward, covering my brother with my torch and I manage to push the flaming end into the freezing form of one of the fiends. It was burned but remained in one piece and rushed at me. Byron jumped at the thing and slammed his own torch into it and several other watchers followed suit. Eventually the massed attacks reduced it to a puddle of liquid like its fellow. The rest of the watchers were being sorely pressed by the remaining fiend. It had killed four of them and the other aerosol flame sprayer was somehow lost or broken.



Jason and I managed to use the remaining flame sprayer to destroy the thing, but the damage had been done and our group of twenty watchers was reduced to seven. We saw another group of grinches in the distance and we were about to try and restore our position to ward them off when we heard something that made my heart sink. The bell at the church was ringing. How could it already be ringing? It was so early; the attacks had just begun and they were there already? The bell only rang when the church itself was under attack and it was a signal that all watchers needed to pull back and focus on defending the church.



Jason and I both looked at each other, panic plain on our faces as we thought of our families sheltering at the church. We gathered our spears and torches and returned to the church as fast as we could.



The retreat was terrible and we were harried by more creatures. We lost two additional comrades when we ran right into a large throng of grinches. They sacrificed themselves so that we could escape. We heard the sounds of other watcher groups being torn apart and the telltale of bodies being frozen and shattered.



We finally arrived at the church and we saw what was happening and panicked. The reason they had moved into town and could attack the church so soon was the head of the horde was led by the worst of them all, it was a Krampus. We did not know if it was a single entity like the famous creature its namesake derives from, or if it was a particular species of monster that had more than one. Mercifully only one ever seemed to show itself during these attacks, but one was enough. The thing was massive and it possessed frightening strength and durability. Few ever reported successfully wounding the thing and no one alive currently could boast of slaying one.



Normally a Krampus would not even show up most years. When they did the attack, it would be particularly terrible. It possesses the ability to drive the lesser creatures into a manic frenzy and can command them as efficiently as any general. We were in very real trouble. No one I knew had faced one before, but I had heard that defeating it could cause all the other creatures to retreat, thus ending the attacks at least for that night. Not a theory I could put much stock in since no one in this generation had successfully defeated one as far as I had heard.



With the townsfolk barricaded in the church, Jason and I, along with four surviving watchers faced the mountainous bulk of the terrible creature. We looked at each other, unsure of how to fight such a blasphemous titan. Zach broke ranks and charged the thing and threw his spear at it. The throw was good, but to our disbelief the Krampus caught the thrown spear and then snapped it in half and discarded the broken parts. I swear I caught a glint of a smile on its horrible face.



It snapped Zach up in its giant hands and before we could stop it, it snapped him in half. Blood sprayed everywhere and we all looked on in horror as the blood-soaked monster charged at us immediately after dispatching our friend.



Jason pulled me aside as the monster bowled past us, narrowly tramping us. He told me urgently,



“I have an idea; I need to lead him to the fuel storage.”



I looked back at him and my heart sank and I replied,



“No, you can’t, there has to be another way.”



Jason smiled at me and just shook his head. I knew his plan and I could not make peace with it, yet I had no choice.



The Krampus killed Robert just as Jason and I ran to the nearby fuel storage depot. There were massive amounts of kerosene and gasoline stored here for use in all of our flammable weapons and for other yearly practical purposes. I did not know we would need to use everything at once but desperate times called for desperate measures.



We baited the monster to follow us to the depot and I was nearly crushed when the creature hurled a piece of a nearby building at me. Jason goaded the monster into following him into the fuel storage and he spared one last glance at me and I mouthed a silent goodbye as he lit the lighter he was still carrying. In the next moment the entire building was turned into a fireball.



My brother had sacrificed himself to save the town. True to tale as we had heard, the rest of the horde vanished early that night. The leader creature defeated, or at least temporarily stopped for that year. The flames raged for so long that not much was left to verify. No one could say for sure if the awful creature had burned up and perished, or if it could have somehow escaped.



Jason received a posthumous award from the town council for his bravery as an example to all of the watch, what little that reminded of us that was.



I still remember the fire and the sounds of the people being slaughtered by those nightmare creatures and I fear for what is in store for us tomorrow. We have even less people this year as more have fled. Our fuel stockpiles are perilously low now as well and it all seems hopeless



The attacks seem worse each year and there are more and more calls to abandon the town entirely. Yet there is some strange force, maybe some spark of divine protection that holds a power that some of us know cannot fall into the hands of those creatures. So, we stay, we stay and fight and protect what is ours from the worsening blight.



I will stay I will honor my brother's memory and protect this town. The time is almost here and I must get ready, it will be another long night. 

Wherever you are in the world stay safe and keep your families warm and safe tonight.

Oh and in case I do not make it to the 25th this year, Merry Christmas.
