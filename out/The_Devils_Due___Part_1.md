When you work in law enforcement, you see some awful things (putting it lightly). Your normal day tends to be someone else’s worst. The past thirty years have given me plenty of rewarding days and just as many awful ones. I have held dead babies, arrested young men who would spend decades behind bars, and consoled families of accident victims. The years have aged me quicker than I would like to admit, but I cannot seem to stay away. Well, I *couldn’t* stay away. 



I am retiring next week. The girls in the office already ordered my cake and my papers have been processed. If you would have asked me two years ago when I was going to retire, I would have laughed and told you when My grandkids were old enough to take over the position. 



My life two years ago seems so distant now. Thanksgiving of 2022 was the day my world flipped upside down. Since then, it has only been a decent down into whatever you want to call this. Is it madness? Is it despair? I can’t really tell anymore. 



I believe the only way to truly get through this is to put it on paper. This story must be told. You may read this and agree that I am crazy or unfit to remain sheriff. I just hope someone out there can believe what I say and learn from what happened here. So, I am going to start with the events of Thanksgiving morning,  the last time I felt whole.

  


It had been raining since before dawn. The sun was lazy and remained hidden behind a curtain of dense gray clouds. The air was cold and wet. Once crisp and colorful leaves were now soggy and brown, stuck to the payment. The faint smell of burning logs traveled throughout the neighborhood as smoke bellowed from chimneys. The streets were empty, yet to feel the weight of full vehicles traveling house to house. Those citizens of Dove Hill who were not traveling were in their warm homes, preparing pies and putting stuffed turkeys into ovens. 



I found myself and over a half dozen other deputies standing in the rain, in front of Don Jennings’ house. I stood with a few other deputies by my patrol car. I had been the Sheriff of Dove Hill for ten years; having served Frankford County for three decades - minus a brief stint with the Georgia State Patrol in the early 2000’s. I was born and raised in Dove Hill; Don Jennings was my best friend. 



I lifted the brim of my hat and scratched my head while looking down at the puddle beneath my boots. The cold rain drops ran down my back. I stood and stared up at Don’s house then back to my deputies. They were standing behind me with their hands in their pockets. After another ten seconds, I knew we had to go up there. Stalling would only delay the inevitable. 



“Okay. Rogers, you and Miller head around the back. Thompson and Everett, they’ll be with me on the porch. I want the rest of y’all behind patrol cars. In case shit hits the fan, which I know won’t happen, I need men on standby to call for backup.” I made sure to look up at all of my deputies as I spoke. The deputies nodded and went their separate ways, as directed. 



I was still in disbelief that I had the entire sheriff's department parked in front of Don’s house. Only an hour before I had been in my recliner drinking a hot cup of coffee while my wife Edna snapped green beans at the table singing to Marvin Gaye. In fact, we had been talking about Don that morning. 



I knew this was all one big clusterfuck of a misunderstanding and Don and I would laugh about it on one of our weekends on the lake- eventually. No, he had not seen Don in a few weeks, but he was sick. Sadie, Don’s daughter, had been checking in on him. He was just having a rough time, it was getting closer to Christmas. Since Shirly had been gone, Don't always had a hard time during the holidays. That was all, Don was not feeling well and just needed to be alone for a bit - and he probably didn’t want to pass a cold to baby Jenny. That was all. This was all a misunderstanding and just Don keeping to himself. That was all. 



I slowly walked along Don’s truck, gently touching the hood to feel if it was warm- it was stone cold. I turned to the two deputies behind me and motioned for them to follow. I figured I'd bring the two rookies, or pole beans, as I called them, with me to the porch. Neither Thompson or Everett had been on the force for more than 6 months; they were barely above drinking age. I had practically known them their whole lives. They were the most nervous about the ordeal. 



Dove Hill was a small quiet town; the most action majority of the deputies had seen up to this point was the occasional domestic violence call or public intoxication. The three of us slowly crept up the porch steps. The air was now still, and the sound of each step creaking may as well have been alarms all going off in sequence. I turned and gave the two deputies a reassuring smile and nod to ease their nerves somewhat. While I continued to tell myself this was all going to chalk up to nothing, I could feel my heartbeat in my temples now. I was beginning to feel tiny, soft butterflies flutter in my gut, like they were just waking from a long sleep.



 I knocked on the front door three times, then stood back. Silence. After about 10 seconds, I leaned forward with three more taps, this time a little harder. I turned back and smiled at the two bean poles. Nothing.



 “Hey, Don!” I yelled hesitantly. “Don, it’s Sam- Sheriff Meadows. I’m just here to ask you a few questions bud'' 



Still, no response. No sounds. No movement. No shuffling. Nothing. 



I reluctantly reached for the knob. “DON! IMMA HAVE TO LET MYSELF IN.” The door was unlocked and opened without protest. I quietly opened the door and crept inside. We were met with the smell of spoiled food. The young deputies behind me both covered their noses immediately, Thompson let out a muffled gag through his sleeve. Dozens of fat flies rested on the walls.



 “Don, it’s Sam. It’s alright, I just have a few deputies with me. We need to ask you a few questions then we’ll be outta your hair.” 



I found my wrist under my nose now. As we cautiously made our way further into the dark living room, the smell grew worse and the flies began to stir. The deep, almost chant-like humming sound that filled the room became louder and more erratic as the heavy flies buzzed throughout the room. I had to begin swatting them away as they flew into my face. I was about to enter the kitchen when something caught my eye. 



Now, I had known Don since we were children. Being one of the few black children in a recently desegregated school in 1970s Georgia had its challenges. I was bullied and called names by students and hardly ever invited to birthday parties or play-dates. That was all until I met Don. He and his parents were welcoming and did not treat me any differently. Don’s mother, Kathy was incredibly sweet and up until her passing in 2010 always referred to me as one of her kids. Mine and Don’s friendship was solid and grew throughout the years as we did.



We were best men at each other's weddings, our wives became best friends, we raised kids together, fished on weekends, and shared our ups and downs. We grieved together as we lost our parents, I and Edna leaned on Don and Shirly when our oldest son died, and Don leaned on us when his wife passed five years ago. There were many nights Don and I helped pull each other from the depths of heartache. I would be lying if I said Don hadn’t saved my life a time or two- and I his. 



As I looked around the living room that hosted our memories, I still struggled to comprehend why I was there. If only this were a larger town or I *wasn’t the damn sheriff* I would have been able to sit this one out. I know, it sounds cowardly, but I was conflicted and the word *confused* did not even begin to describe the jumbled thoughts racing through my mind at that moment. 



When I turned my attention to the figure in the dining room, I did not see Don. I saw someone *else.* The Don Jennings I knew was clean shaved and friendly. He was a Christian and genuinely tried to be as Christ-like as he could. Now we all have our demons and Don had his fair share, but he simply loved people. He was *good.* 



The man I saw that morning was unkempt. The smell of rotten food began to mingle with the putrid smell of body odor and urine. He looked disheveled. As I turned toward him and began to walk his way, I noticed his Smith & Wesson laying on the table in front of him. That .44 Magnum was Don’s favorite gun; he had bought it at an auction just before his daughter graduated high school. I stared at the gun for a brief moment and thought back to the dark April night I had to talk Don out of eating it shortly after Shirly’s accident. 



In that moment the realization that something was terribly wrong hit me like a truck. I wouldn’t be able to fix this- fix him. The butterflies in my stomach had not turned into a pit with no bottom. My heart and stomach were practically playing hop-scotch with one another. 



“Whoa, Don. I didn’t see you there.” I said as I slowly pivoted towards the table. My hand now on my holster, moves were now strategic and calculated. “Whatcha doin’ sittin’ here in the dark man?” 



I wiped the salty sweat from my face. 



Don looked up at me, he was not a very large man. Don was average in build, late fifties. He was not an intimidating man, and I never knew him to try and be. But now, in the moment, the Don Jennings I knew, the Don Jennings who defended me against skinheads in the school, the Don Jennings who gave his only daughter away to my son ten years ago, was gone. His eyes were vacant and glassy, almost shining against the dark. He had fresh scabs on his face, they looked like healing scratches. He smiled ear to ear. 



“Sam! I am so happy you are here on this beautiful morning!”



 His graying hair was wet, sticking to his forehead, making it return to its familiar brown hue. He looked like he hadn’t showered in a week. 



“Don, I haven't seen you in a few weeks. Not since Halloween- were you sick? What’s the matter Don?” My head was cocked, trying to examine the strange man in front of me. 



“Sam- I, I” Don began to lift his hands in glory and almost laugh; it was like he was giddy. “I must share the good news with you! Oh, it’s ju-just marvelous Sam!” He was acting childlike, or as if he was freshly home from a tent revival.



 “Okay Don, that’s great. How about, we go down to the station and you tell me there. I would love to hear it, and I’m sure Sadie would be so glad to see you today, after all, it is Thanksgiving. She’s been worried sick about ya.” I flickered my eyes down to the gun, back at Don.



I was slowly closing the gap between Don and I, smiling and gently motioning him to stand up. I was aware of the gun's place on the table and without breaking eye contact now, I slowly reached for it. 



Don’s eyes lit up while he listened to Sam. “Sadie? Oh, yes! Will Marcus and the kids be there too, Sam?” 



“Yes, yes they will.” I lied.



 At this moment, Don broke eye contact long enough to see my fingertips closing in on the gun. He quickly grabbed the gun and yanked it towards his body “No Sam! No! '' he spat, standing up. His eyes lost their sparkle for a split second, and they almost looked black. “No! You will not take her from me!”



 For a moment I could have sworn Don was foaming from the mouth as he screamed. His joyous expression was gone, his face turned red, jowls shaking as he screamed. 



I recoiled and grabbed my holster. “Don, I’m- I’m sorry. I just didn’t want you to hurt yourself man.” 



The two bean poles nearly jumped back, their thin arms at their sides, fingers trembling over their holsters as well.



 As quickly as it left, the sparkle came back and Don threw his head back in manic laughter.



 “No Sam, you're mistaken. She won’t hurt me or do anything I don’t want.” He stroked the barrel of the gun, running his fingertips over the cylinder. He held the revolver gently, with care. “Sit! Come on, sit down so I can finally share the good news!” Don gleefully dropped back into his chair. He looked at the two terrified deputies behind Sam. “Sit boys! Sit!” His smile was so wide it looked painful. 



I looked at the other deputies and the two on the back porch. I subtly shook my head, I needed more time alone before the rest of the men barged in. I knew Rogers had called for backup soon as he heard Don yell. I sat down in the chair across from Don, gun now in my hand under the table. 



“Don, I’m afraid there is an issue- something has happened. I would really like to go down to the station and-”



 “I saw God, Sam.” Don interrupted. “I saw Him, and Shirly was with Him! They came to me a few months ago Sam!” He rocked back and forth, as if the excitement was too much to keep inside.



 My heart was in my throat. 



 “And Sam, He- He told me things…He told me I was the chosen one Sam!” Don began to giggle again, he was hysterical. “I am doing His work and cleansing the Earth!” Don was speaking faster than Sam had ever heard him speak. “Do you hear me Sam?! Sam- I was chos-” 



“STOP!” I didn’t mean to yell, but for the first time in a while, I felt fear. I felt that familiar, sinking feeling in my gut; the same damn feeling I felt when I saw Sam Jr hit the collapse on the football field all those years ago. It was the feeling of dread. It was the feeling that you know that things are *not* going to be okay, no matter how much you pray for them to be. The truth of the matter was, he had done what he was suspected of, and possibly more. My eyes filled with burning tears, I wiped them away before turning my  attention back to Don. 



“No! Sam, I- You need to understand me. I am serving the *LORD!* And He is so happy with me Sam! He is so happy! But, I have been told this morning that my work is done here and I need to go be with Shirly and the Lord.” Don pleaded, drool began to escape his lips. 



“Don, ju-just slow down. I need the gun.” I reached out, my hands were shaking. “Please, just don’t do anything crazy. Think about Sadie, think about the kids.”



 Don shook his head and began to position the barrel under his chin and grunt. “No Sam, I’m not. This isn’t crazy at all, this is- this is what he needs me to do. This is my mission Sam. I, I-” Don had a firm grip on the gun, as his chin rested on the muzzle. Don had become a bizarre combination of manic yet totally calm, panicked yet free.



 Don looked at me, his smile softened. “Sam, I have completed my mission. I’m going home now.” Don closed his eyes and cocked the gun. In that instant, I sprung up from my chair and grabbed Don’s wrist, thrusting it to the side. 



Don squeezed the trigger. 



The blast echoed throughout the house. I fell back into my chair. The bullet had traveled up the side of Don’s face and exited his head from a giant hole it had created above his left brow. Blood, teeth, bone fragments and brain matter covered my uniform and the ceiling. Don’s body slumped over in his chair, then slowly fell out onto the floor where a dark puddle formed around him. Wisps of smoke exited the newly formed hole in his head.



 I fell from the chair and to my knees, eyes wide. I looked up at the two deputies; Everett’s pants were soaked with urine as he stood staring at Don’s lifeless body. I looked back down at the puddle of thick blood under my knees now; it was so dark. No more than a second later, the back and front doors were busted open. Deputies rushing in, guns drawn. The dining room was suddenly filled with so much noise and chaos. But I couldn't hear a damn thing. I just sat on the floor covered in Don. I think I was too stunned to fully realize what had just happened, as I shifted my body, now sitting in the puddle. It all just happened too damn fast.

  
  


To be continued.
