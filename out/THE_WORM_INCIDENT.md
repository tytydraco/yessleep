I woke up at 11:15 with a hangover from last night. Fuck I consumed so much alcohol and drugs it would kill an elephant. That fucking sun was shining in my face. Last night I forgot to close the curtains. Well, I also forgot how to behave as a decent human being.

My thoughts and flashback were speeding which cringy event will pop up first. I was laying on my couch for a moment to gather my thoughts. Then I had a feeling that I´m going to puke. I rushed to the bathroom. By the time I got there, it went away.

„Strange, “ I thought to myself.´“ Well at least I´ll take a piss.“ While I was washing my hands I looked in a mirror. „Motherfucker!“ I noticed a big ass pimple on my forehead. It was at least an inch long. There were like five smaller ones around it. It was probably from all the drugs I took yesterday.

My plug had brought some new drugs. I guess that idiot got them from some Arabic country whose name I can´t even pronounce. „I´ll have some breakfast and I´ll take care of it later.“ I felt like my fucking head will fell off at any time. This wasn´t a regular hangover. „ At this state,  I can´t cook I´ll order a takeout, “ I thought.

While I was waiting for my food to come I wanted to pop that pimple so I wouldn´t look like a total crackhead. I´ve decided to pop it with my index fingers. „It will be fast and painless, “ I thought. As I popped it something strange happened. I saw something like a blackhead coming out, but then it started moving.

It was warm like an inch-and-a-half-long creature moving under my skin. I felt every single move of that creature I have just woken up. That motherfucking extraterrestrial bitch was moving. It went from my forehead to my upper lip. Slowly eating my skin or maybe meat from under my skin.

All I could do was standstill and watch how it was slowly eating me. I decided to do something I tried to like grab it with my hand and maybe strangle it. It got scared and turned around. It went to my left eye. It did something to it. I couldn’t see so clearly and I noticed that what used to be an iris was just cloudly whiteness.

Like pure white scrambled eggs. While I was admiring my absolutely fucked up eye full of probably its eggs, that thing moved. It went along my skull to the back of my head. I don´t know where it is anymore. I don´t see it anymore.

I think it‘s going for my brain. I feel weak rubbing at the back of my head. I think it will eat me. I shouldn‘t party yesterday. I shouldn´t take all those drugs yesterday. I don´t know what to do. I feel its every move but I don´t know when it will kill me.

I have an idea, I´ll kill myself before it will kill me. THAT WORM WILL DIE WITH ME! I´m writing this for the people that cared for me so they would know what happened to me. I loved you all. Goodbye.
