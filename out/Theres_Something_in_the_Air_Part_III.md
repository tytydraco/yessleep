“SIX O’CLOCK THREE HUNDRED METERS”

I wake up covered in sweat. Like many other nights for the last twenty-three years, I was back in Khe Sanh.

“What time is it?” I say to myself.

I leave my room and head towards the front of the house. Jack and Debra are still asleep, and the sun is barely peaking over the horizon.

The smell lingers, and grew stronger overnight.

“Fuck that smells rancid, what the hell is that?” I think to myself.

I go out to the porch and sit quietly on their outdoor sofa. Despite it being covered in stains and grime that God only knows what caused them, I feel something strange. A feeling that I haven’t felt in a long time. The sky was clear, and the porch faced the east towards the rising sun. I sat there for an hour, just existing. The rancid stench and the nightmare couldn’t ruin this momentary lapse of peace. This moment ended when Debra stepped outside for a cigarette.

“Got a spare light?” She asks relatively calmly.

“No, I don’t smoke anymore,” I respond lazily.

“No shit? Good for you, more cigs for me to buy at Pete’s Place.”

“Jesus fuck Travis, do you smell that shit?”

“The dead battery stench? Yes.”

“I thought I was the only one, Jack’s stubborn ass doesn’t smell it and thinks we’re fuckin with him somehow.”

“The pig shit must have fucked up his sense of smell then.”

“Real funny,” she said with a quick side-eye, “Don’t get too comfortable there, Big Buford likes to leave us surprises around this time of the week, and you’re an extra hand to help clean it up”

Big Buford, Jack’s prized hog. He likes to show it around during pig competitions across the state. The thing weighs probably a couple hundred pounds. The only thing on this ranch topping that weight is Debra.

“Of course,” I respond casually.

“Around midnight, Jack woke me up complaining about an upset stomach. How many Coors did ya’ll have last night?”

“Not too much to warrant messing up his insides. That man has an iron gut to alcohol.”

“I guess, but he said it was stinging bad, hopefully, he feels better today, it’s almost our anniversary you know.”

Jack and Debra have been together for nearly eleven years. Her father was a hand on the ranch for Jack’s pa for several years before he passed away. She grew up in Colton but moved away to Des Moines for a time. She’d come around town every so often. Through her pa, she met Jack, and the two hit it off ever since then. Once married, she moved in with Jack and has been here ever since.

“Oh I know, I was his best man at the wedding”

“Debb, where you at?” Jack shouts from the inside.

“Out here Hon” Debb promptly responds.

“My stomach’s fucking killing me”

“Travis, I need you to take me to town and get me to a doctor or get me some medicine. Anything to make this pain go away.”

“I’m ready when you are Jack.”

Debra speaks up, “I'll stay back and start morning checks on the chickens, Travis, while you’re in town, I need some stuff from Pete’s. Here’s a list of what we need. It’s gonna be okay sweetie, Dr. Edwards will take great care of you.”

“Oh shit, before we go, I gotta take my med”

Two more left. I can make it I think to myself.

Jack and I hop in my truck and hit the road towards the clinic. The sun’s out now, but it's still pretty early.

We roll up on the road where I saw Walter standing alone yesterday. It’s empty now, and Walter isn’t in sight. Maybe he went back to his house?

“Man, this pain is no fucking joke” Jack whines.

“It’s gonna be okay bud, Dr. Edwards will probably prescribe some laxative”

“I don’t know dude but I ain’t ever felt this way before.”

“We’re almost there, only ten minutes out from the clinic.”

The clinic was on the north western fringes of Colton. It was the only significant building in that area of the town, with the only other structure being an abandoned gas station that closed down back in the late 70s across the street.

As I get nearer to the clinic, I notice that the clinic’s parking lot is full. Cars and trucks line the curb and anywhere they can park, including across the street at the abandoned gas station.

“What the fuck?” I say quietly.

“Why is it so damn busy? It’s a fucking Tuesday morning!” Jack yells.

“I don’t know man, maybe there’s a flu going around? Let’s try to get you inside.”

I find an open parking spot behind the old gas station’s main building.

There's a sizeable line of people stretching out of the clinic’s front door. It takes about forty-five minutes to get to the front.

“Nurse, my stomach is killing me and I need to see a doctor ASAP,” Jack says anxiously.

“Yes sir, the wait time for Doctor Edwards is four hours. We understand that is not ideal, but the clinic is operating at max capacity.” The nurse responds urgently.

“Excuse me? Four fucking hours just to get seen?” Jack says bitterly.

“Yes, I apologize for the inconvenience but that is the current estimated wait time at the moment. It seems many folks around here are catching some sort of stomach bug. I am filling in for my sick colleague today.” The nurse replies apologetically. “Your best bet may be to take the drive over to Davenport Medical Center and get seen there, although I can’t guarantee it’ll be quicker since it seems they’re going through something similar.”

“Fuck it, I’ll stay my ass here then,” Jack responds.

Jack gives the nurse his info and she informs him that they’ll call him once they get to him. Before I leave to catch up with Jack, I find myself wanting to ask her a question.

“Ma’am, have you noticed a foul odor in the air?”

She looks startled that somebody asked her, and she pauses and says,

“I do… I really can’t chit-chat right now though, unless you need medical assistance too, I ask that you move aside so that I can check in the next patient.”

“That was strange” I think to myself as I head towards where Jack is standing.

“Jack”

“What?”

“The smell, the nurse knows the fucking smell”

“Man, what the hell are you talking about? I’m over here dying from whatever is screwin' my stomach up and you’re obsessed with this fucking smell?” Jack responds furiously, “I already told you and Debby, I don’t smell shit. Ya’ll must be off your fucking rockers or something.”

Jack, despite his love for saying every insult under the sun when we hang out, is rarely ever pissed like the way he is now. Physically, he isn’t intimidating in the slightest. Sure, he’s taller than me, but he’s also built like a pencil. Despite his outwardly anger, I can see the hurt in his eyes. Rather than continue to provoke him, I need to be a good friend and help a brother out.

“I’m sorry Jack, I didn’t mean to upset you,” I say apologetically.

“I’m just tired of hearing about this damn imaginary smell. There isn’t a fucking smell and there never was.”

He sits against the wall and slouches over, covering his face with his arms.

“I’m gonna head out and get some of the stuff Debby wanted from the list at Pete’s. I’ll spot you on a pack of cigs too. I know you love your Marlboros. I should be back in two or three hours.” I say with a hint of optimism, “It’s gonna be okay Jack, you’ll be on your feet in a couple of days and ready to kill some Coors with me again.”

He stays silent, his head buried in his arms.

I tap him on his shoulder and leave the clinic.

As I approach my truck, I notice Annie Bentley, one of the substitute teachers at the local elementary school and someone that I haven’t spoken to in years, come up to me with an eager smile and an empty plastic bowl in both of her hands.

“Good morning Mrs. Bentley,” I say timidly.

Instead of returning my greeting, she suddenly stops ten feet from me and throws up. A mixture of gastric acid, bile, mucus and partially eaten breakfast makes its way out of her mouth and slowly but steadily into the plastic bowl. Its texture is reflective of a grotesque milkshake, with colors like deep red, sick green, and light orange present throughout it.

I nearly gag and throw up myself before she pulls out a rusty spork from her jean pocket, takes a spoonful of the disgusting vomit from the bowl, and cheerily chews and swallows it, licking any excess bile from her lips like one would with ice cream.

“Mrs. Bentley, WHAT THE FUCK?!” I shout as I hastily make my way into the truck.

Annie, still standing there without taking a single step, continues to munch on her stomach’s stew while smiling and seemingly humming a tune, her eyes fixed on her ‘meal’.

I blindly take off, almost hitting her and a couple of other parked vehicles as I hook around the dilapidated station. My heart is racing with anxiety and fear.

“What the hell is going on here?” I think to myself as I speed down the lonely country road back toward Colton.

I must have been going pretty fast because just as I look back into my rearview mirror for the first time after Annie lost her shit, I notice flashing red and blue lights catching up to me.

“Fuck, just my luck.” I think to myself.
