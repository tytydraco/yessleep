Long time ago I was on a camping trip with some friends in a nearby park. It was a nice evening and there was no one else In the park. During the weekend we met up at the camping site. We set up our tents and one of us started a campfire. There was only three of us so we would share the tent.

We enjoyed some roasted marshmallows with some spooky stories. When we started getting ready to sleep one of us had the great idea to see if one of the stories were true. It was about ghostly woman missing her legs and during the night she would steal other people's legs to use as her own.

So we were wandering around the woods in the darkness without a light while holding hands out of fear. One of my friends whisper saying that we should head back to the tent but we keep going. The only thing we could hear was the branches breaking under our shoes.

We were just about to turn back but in front of me I saw something. At first it looked like some fireflies next to each other making the illusion of eyes. But they blinked. Then I saw the rest of its body. It was hard to see in the night but It was like a distortion in the normal darkness. 

It was just standing or floating without moving. I didn't know what to do. I realized in my shock my friends had left without me noticing. I so scared 
That I forgot about the creature for a Second while looking around. Once I remembered that it was there I went to look at it again but the only thing that was left was a piece of paper left on a tree and some drag marks on the ground.

The note said"I must forever wander towards nothing. I crave flesh. I don't have a mouth yet I consume. I wish I could stop. please forgive me." I ran. I ran like I was an Olympic athlete. And at every glance I swear I saw its glowing eyes and distorted body everywhere I looked while running. Once I made it into my car I drove into the city and called the police.

I drove to the police station and asked if I could stay there. But they didn't believe I was in danger so I rented a nearby hotel with lots of other people. The police said they would go and search the place. The next morning I was exhausted because I couldn't sleep last night. Every time I closed my eyes I saw it.

The police contacted me and said that they found nothing. I asked about the note I saw yesterday but they said they found nothing. Then I remembered about our camping site and told the police that they should go and check that place. I told them roughly where the Camping site was and soon they came back said all they found was two pairs of legs ripped off at a near by a cave.

I didn't know what to think.  The cops said it was probably just a bear or a wolf that was saving the legs for later and left them in the cave to save for later. 
I just hope my friends are okay but I know I'm just thinking positively and avoiding the truth.
