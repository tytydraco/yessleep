If there was one positive that I could say about my old house, it was the way it so magically amplified the scent of my father’s decadent cooking. Something about the older walls and carpet mixed with the pre-established scents left behind made the smell of searing meat and sauteing vegetables ride the air in a beautiful symphony that made my mouth water. Dad had always been a great chef, especially given the few ingredients that he usually had to work with, and every night it was practically an event when we’d gather around to eat. It wasn’t just the food, though. It was just that tiny moment that me, him and Mom all got to sit and laugh together. Catch up on our days and talk about the week to come.

Those times were magical when I was younger. The longer we stayed in that home, though, the less frequent those dinners became…

Still, I’d always find time to be with my father while he cooked, doing homework at the table behind him while he seared and sliced away. He was wrapping up when I finally spoke, still looking down at my papers.

“That smells so good,” I grumbled, “What did you make?”

“Not sure,” Dad snickered, “Some sort of pesto pasta. I just threw together whatever looked good.” He picked up a fork and plucked a few penne noodles from the pot, moving to me and holding it out, “Here. Give it a go.”

“Using me as the guinea pig, huh?” I snickered at him before taking the bite. My face must have lit up, cause he smiled. I nodded, then wiped my mouth, “You definitely succeeded.”

“Good,” Dad said, returning to the stove to turn over the chicken breasts he’d lay there. Plucking one off, he plated it with some pasta and greens, then turned to me, “Do you wanna go wake your mom up for me?” He handed me the plate, signifying that he already knew the answer to his next statement, but he still spoke hopefully, “You can see if she’s feeling well enough to come down and eat with us.”

I nodded, then moved for the stairs, looking outside the front window as I did. Blue light cascaded in and flooded the spaces that we kept unlit, which was most of the home these days. All that remained, scuffed into the hardwood, was a line between the kitchen and our bedrooms; occasionally the den.

The old stairs creaked their familiar jingle as I reached the dark hallway and stepped for the rustic wood door at the corridor's end. Knocking lightly, I heard no response, so I let myself in.

The space was mostly shadow, save for the azure spotlight that breached the window just above my parents’ bed. It shone delicately onto the lump beneath the covers, my mother coiled into herself like a sleeping cat, her hair a tangled mess. Moving near, I slipped the plate onto her nightstand and flicked her lamp on. Kneeling onto her bed, I leaned over to softly kiss her hair before shaking her and whispering.

“Mom?”

It took a few tries, but eventually her darkened, fatigued lids slid open, and she lopped over to face me with a stretch. When she saw who it was, she offered me a smile and spoke, placing her hand on my knee and stroking it with her thumb. “Hey, Henny.”

“Dinner time,” I told her warmly, hiding her plate with my back, “You feeling well enough to come downstairs? Or you want it in here?”

Mom’s smile melted away and she looked up at the ceiling. With a hard swallow, she shook her head, “No, I’ll take it up here again tonight. I feel so nauseous I’m not sure I’d make it down the steps without tripping.”

I hid my disappointment as I nodded, then turned to grab her plate, moving it onto her lap, “I’m starting to think that the house with stairs wasn’t the best move for us.”

Mom snickered, “It was all we could afford. Sorry that I slept all day.”

“Don’t apologize, Mom,” I shook my head, “The chemo is taking a lot out of you. Speaking of, did you take your pills yet?”

Mom sighed, “I’m afraid not. Slept right through the alarm.”

I turned to her nightstand and grabbed her water glass, going into her bathroom to rinse and fill it while she got her capsules open. She didn’t have to take a ton, there were only a couple vital ones. The rest were mostly vitamins the doctors recommended, as she hadn’t been handling food all that well. Still, those tiny orange bottles seemed to pop up everywhere. Like vermin finding their way into every crack of the house.

As I returned with her drink, Mom took it and popped her whole handful down in one gulp, struggling it down before turning to look at me, an unamused expression on her face. It got a giggle out of me.

“I can’t wait to be done with all this,” she said, setting her container down and smiling. She said that a lot; always with such confidence too. I could tell that was for my sake. In her eyes, I don’t know which direction she meant by ‘being done with it’, though.

Looking at her while she poked at her plate, combined with her grumpy, tired expression, I couldn’t help but continue to chuckle.

She eyed me then smirked, “What’s so funny, missy?”

“Come here,” I told her, taking a brush from her nightstand and scooting behind, “Your hair is a rat's nest.” She turned to allow me, and I collected her long, fiery locks in my hand before starting to run the brush down it.

The strands fought me, holding each other strong in protest, but eventually the bristles tore them apart and got them straightened out. I worked my way across her scalp while she did her best to force food down, both of us silent for the most part. When I got about halfway, I ran the brush down, then pulled it out, checking my progress. I was filled with dismay when I could barely see the black backing of the brush anymore, and only the tangled nest of orange locks that I’d pulled loose.

Mom sensed my pause and already knew what was wrong, “Hen, honey, you don’t need to do that. You go eat yourself; I’ll try and come down later tonight.”

“N-No, that’s okay,” I quickly said, not wanting to leave her just yet, “I’m not that hungry right now anyway. Dad’s still cooking our chicken, too.”

Mom nodded, “He did a good job tonight.”

“Yeah,” I tossed out halfheartedly, inspecting the brush again after another stroke.

Mom decided to take a different approach this time, “What’s the damage looking like?”

I inhaled slowly as my throat got tighter. I could feel my eyes well as I spoke, “Not good, Mom…”

She hesitated a moment before turning to look over her shoulder, sensing my grief. With a smile, she teased, “Look on the bright side, soon you won’t even need to do that anymore. I’ll be a bald mama.”

I laughed, but couldn’t stop tears from falling out of my eyes, “But I like doing this…”

Mom set her plate down and slid it across her bed, pivoting to face me and reaching and hand out to my cheek. She brushed my tears away with her thumb, then pulled my chin so I’d look at her. The warmth on her face filled that empty feeling in my gut, and her caring eyes untangled the knot stuck in my throat.

“It’s just hair, Henny. I’m not too worried about it.”

I sniffled and nodded, letting my eyes fall away again.

“Besides,” Mom told me, taking the brush from my hand and cleaning it off. She set the wad of hair on the dresser for the time being and then collected my locks up, running the teeth through it, “I still have your beautiful locks.”

I snickered, then just sat staring blankly forward at the wall, dwelling in my mother’s care while trying to get a grip on my emotions for her sake. After my breathing had calmed down and my sniffling was quieted, my mother filled the new silence with her delicate, angelic voice. She didn’t do it too often, but when she did, all of time stood still to listen.

She began to sing; an old lullaby that she sometimes would when I was young.

“*Hush now my darling, beneath summer’s moon.*

*The nightingale's crooning, the whispers of June.*

*Your worries tomorrow, exist not today.*

*I’ll hold you so tightly, and chase them away.*

*And when sunlight’s blush, peers in through your sill’,*

*And all of creation, goes silent and still.*

*You’ve nothing to worry; I’ll pick up that tune.*

*And sing it so tender…”*

“The whispers of June…” I pondered aloud, standing before the house once again.

“What?” Ann asked beside me.

I snapped from my staring contest with the upstairs window and turned to her, shaking my head, “Nothing. Just thinking.”

“About what? If you’ve got something to say, now is the time to say it,” she said, gesturing to the porch.

“It’s not important to the situation,” I said, nodding toward the front door. “We can talk about it if we make it out alive.” I thought about that sentence for a moment, then couldn’t help but correct for Hope’s sake, “*When* we make it out alive.”

We had only doubled back to the tower for a few minutes so I could make the last update post and get a breather before heading back out. It was the compromise we’d made with Hope to convince her that we weren’t only acting on rash adrenaline alone. We needed the body that was in that house if we were going to get out of here, and we were fairly certain that it was still in there somewhere.

For whatever reason, the twisted angel didn’t mangle the body. At least not on the spot, like the evidence of every other creature in this place pointed to. Even Zane at the last rig was ready to tear into me where I lay before Hope saved me, but this creature felt different. It took the man delicately—well, as delicately as a creature with knife fingers could, then it moved to a different part of the house, like it was collecting him. Considering that it floated straight up, and it wasn’t waiting for us on the first floor when we ran for the exit, that only left one place for it to be. Ann and I were both certain that we knew the exact room that it would choose.

Hope had insisted on coming with us, but Ann wouldn’t allow it, and regretfully, I had to agree. If she came, then June would want to come too, and we didn’t have time for that. The clone was having a near mental breakdown over what we’d just seen, and taking her back in when we needed to work fast would only slow us down. Weakness was a death sentence, and though I hated to speak ill of her, June was clearly not strong willed.

Instead, we asked that Hope hang back and look after her. She was my most nurturing self, after all, and she was also the 2^(nd) most experienced with this place. If anyone was fit to look after June, it was her. Instead, we decided that while Ann and I delved back into the depths of our house, they would head to the compound door in the cliff and try the code we’d been given by the scientist. Getting inside of the main lab would be a massive step forward, and not only that, it might offer some protection if the beast on the horizon returns when we’re not ready.

*“Il-Belliegħa,”* my brain replayed the scientists quaking, fearful words.

Suddenly, I had the desire to hustle along. Ann and I began moving for the front door.

While we did, I decided to focus on some more reassuring words. The ones that Hope said to us as we left.

“Meet you back here soon, okay?”

Ann and I knew we would have to return to the house as soon as we could, mostly because we didn’t want it to disappear. Given that we’d shut the rig down before leaving, there was a high probability that the whole place would simply ‘unmake’ itself before we got back. Luckily, it was still here, disproving my theory, but as we quietly opened the door, it was clear that our tampering with the core did have some effect on the place.

Layout wise, the house looked the same. Same entryway, same hall and stairs, and same rooms to our right and left. The difference was that it was snowing now. Soft, white flakes danced noiselessly through the air in the pale, sapphire light from the windows. Varying in size, they seemed to collecting in a thin sheet that was already blanketing the hardwood and rugs.

Despite this, the air was warm still, and squinting my eyes, I realized that the dull flakes weren’t snow. It was dust. Dust bunnies like the ones cluttering every shelf of the place endlessly appearing only to fill the vacant structure. Well, almost vacant…

Ann and I ensured that the angel was nowhere to be seen before stepping inside hushed as possible. The air was stale now, old and dry. Abandoned. Lifeless. The space was dying now that we ripped out its heart and we didn’t know how long it would stay up. The dust blanketing the ground began to feel more like a giant hourglass filling up, threatening to suffocate us inside should we take too long.

There was no more time to waste.

I led the way as Ann trailed close, both of us moving to the steps and making our way up. I made sure to keep my feet to the outmost part of them as I moved, not wanting to make noise, but even the rickety wooden steps were copied verbatim from my old place. They each woke with a start as our boots stomped them back to life, and with each one, I winced a little harder. Finally, halfway up and eyeing the dark hallway, I stopped to listen.

My heart was louder than anything else as I stared into the maw of shadow only a few feet away, praying that I wouldn’t see that godawful pale creature come gliding to the edge of the steps. As I listened past the blood in my ears, all I could hear though was the sound of Ann’s shaky breath behind. Swallowing hard, I creaked up a few more steps.

The top of the stairs was a haunting corridor of darkness, all the doors to the bedroom and bathroom shut tight. It should have made me feel at ease knowing that there were no sight lines aimed at us, but knowing we were trapped in there with a creature whom walls didn’t apply to, a shut door was just another spot for something to jump out of.

Like I said, Ann and I had a hunch where the angel would be camping out. It would only be too perfect. In a place constructed from my memories, of course the monster would build its nest where those reflections were most sour. Still, we needed to make sure, so we started with the first door in the opposite direction of my mother's room.

At the far end of the hall, in a room that was built above the den, I opened the door. If the coats from the closet had hit me with a high dose of nostalgia, then the scent of the room beyond was a whole other beast.

My bedroom was small, so when we loaded all of my furniture in, it became quite the cluttered nest. My chipped paint dresser stood faithfully to my left, and just beyond it, my bed. An old desk that we’d found for free on the side of the road rested beneath my window, covered in papers and with my old blue school bag still leaning up against it, and just next to that, a bookshelf filled with all the best finds the thrift store down the road could offer.

It wasn’t much, but it served well. The place I’d spent the most time in all our years here. When Dad was catching up on work late into the night and Mom was already asleep, I’d shut myself away and get lost to school work or in a book. Use them as little windows to escape through and not think about the world for a while. The impending doom waiting just a few blocks down in the form of a hospital.

Even the dull blue glow of the space was right, although I could say that about the whole house. When I woke in the morning for school, that’s the color the sky was always painted, and when I got home for the day, it had already looped back around. Any real sunlight was just a blurry backdrop tangled in my daydreams and disassociations throughout the day. I lived in that azure haze for most of my time spent in this place, so much so that the washed colors and strong shadows made me sick to look at the longer I lingered here.

Surprisingly, the dust wasn’t falling in my room; at least not yet. I stepped inside and looked to the wall above my dresser covered in polaroids of family and friends we’d parted with in our move. I took one off the wall of me, Mom and Dad, then inspected it. To my surprise, the detail was there—it was a picture I'd remembered having—but it was far from perfect. Mom’s face wasn’t the way I knew it had been. It was the way my failing memory had recreated it.

The revelation made my heart hurt, and I set the thing back on top of the dresser. The body wasn’t here, and neither was the angel. It was time to move on.

The next room on our stop was the guest bed. It wasn’t a lot, just a bed, some nightstands, and a closet with not a whole lot of space. The extra room ended up running the rent higher, but we needed it. Lots of family from both Mom and Dad’s side passing through. Some came to help for a while in any way they could. Others stopped by as a sort of unspoken farewell. The story for anyone you asked was always that Mom was going to get better. There was no telling how many actually believed that.

This room too was empty, and snowing dust all the same. The colorful quilt on the bed was nothing but a solid blanket of white now, and the room was as cold as it had always been toward those last few years.

The bathroom down the hall was the bathroom. Not much else to say. All the fixtures and toiletries were exactly how I’d left them. Creeping inside, I even found that my soaps and shampoos were the same way they’d always been. We may have been on a time crunch, but I stopped for a moment to raid toothpaste and some of the soaps. It’d been a while since any of us had gotten to conduct proper hygiene on ourselves.

Heading back into the hall, that only left the place we’d assumed from the start. The master bedroom. Ann and I looked at the door with faces as pale as the dust around us. If the angel hadn’t emerged yet, it must have gone back into its hibernation, which meant we had two options.

The first was to lure the creature out. We knew it had to still be in here, and if it was, then this was one of the last spots it could be hiding given that the creatures in the rigs don’t seem like they can leave. If we baited it back downstairs, we could slip into the room and look for the body without it knowing exactly where we are.

The second option was more scary. We just open the door and check. There was a chance that it wasn’t actually in here; maybe it had gone back down to the control room. Or, maybe it wasn’t here at all. When we pulled the core, there was always a chance that as this place decayed, the angel decayed with it. maybe it was gone already, or maybe, using it’s phasing abilities, it wasn’t even physically in the house right now. That last thought made me shiver a bit at the implications, but the point still stood. If the beast wasn’t even here and we went with plan one, we’d be alerting it to our presence for no reason and blow an open opportunity to get out of here without conflict. Now might be our chance.

I looked at Ann, and she looked at me with a stony expression. She was having the same crisis that I was. We both paused to listen one more time, hoping to hear something that might make the decision easier, but when we didn’t, Ann finally chose for us.

To my surprise, she didn’t barge forward for the door like I thought she would. She went for option number one. Heading back down the steps, she made it to the entryway where she picked up a decorative bowl on a side table. The car keys inside jingled quietly as they shifted, and while Ann carefully moved back over to me, I moved halfway down the steps and stopped, getting in position.

We’d gone over the plan for this before we left the tower. My parent's bedroom was right above the living room, which meant if we made a distraction there, odds were the angel would go straight through the floor to investigate. This was perfect, because the bowl could be thrown from the steps out of sight, so as the creature glided down, we could move up, going to check out the room while it began poking around the rest of the house. With luck, by the time we got the corpse, the angel would have gone all the way back down to the basement, and we could book it out the front door before it got back.

There were so many what if’s and variables, but the sad truth was that we were getting desperate. At the rate I’m going, I don’t expect us to make it out of this place alive. We may as well try everything we can.

Raising the dish above her head, Ann hucked the thing hard into the parlor, sending the keys ringing across the hardwood as the bowl fractured into a million pieces.

In the consistent silence of the house, the noise sounded like an explosion. I’d fully seen it coming and still flinched when it hit the floor. My body began trembling with fear, and my legs tensed as they prepared to move.

Between checks to the hallway, I watched Ann’s face closely as she peered down around the railing. I was waiting for her to signal that she saw the angel coming, but she never did. In fact, her face grew more and more confused as one minute passed, then two, then three.

Finally, she leaned in and tugged me closer, “There’s no way in hell it didn’t hear that, right?”

I bit my cheek and leaned back, “I feel like it *had* to.”

Ann checked the living room one last time for good measure, then back at me, shaking her head, “It’s not coming. Maybe it isn’t here after all?”

I didn’t like that it wasn’t a certainty, but the floor was no longer visible, and the dust was still falling. We couldn’t keep waiting.

Creeping back up the stairs, I sidled along the wall as quietly as I could toward the master bedroom door. Sparing one last glance to Ann, she nodded before I set my hand on the knob and turned it.

There was a small creak that made me jump as the ancient hinges yawned from their long nap. It sounded so similar to some of the specter’s songs that I thought for sure it was already waiting for us. Once I calmed down, however, I shoved it the rest of the way, revealing the shadowy room beyond.

Like my room, there was no dust in here other than the gust that rode in with the breeze. It scattered about the somber place like bugs scuttling from the light, and as I looked around, my stomach became more and more sick. I hated this room with all my heart. The room that I lost my mother to night after night. The room that I watched her wither away in. All the furniture was in perfect order as expected, and that damned blue light shining down on the bed that always made her look so much more ghostly was glowing strong as ever.

Luckily, there was no nostalgia triggering smell for this room, but unfortunately, there was a worse one.

The body was here alright, laying right on the mattress that my mother once did. His limbs were splayed out wide while his bloody sockets stared at the ceiling, his flooded mouth frozen in an eternal scream. If seeing that sight in the shadow swept room beneath the ambient light wasn’t horrifying enough, the other things about the body was.

Squinting my eyes, I say that he wasn’t laying on my parent’s usual sheets. They were tattered and dull, smooth as leather. It took me a moment to realize in the pale luminance that it looked like soft skin. From the bed, there were clear plastic tubes sprouting out like bramble, coiling all over the bed before puncturing into his skin. Inside the straws was blood being sucked out, and around the body was also strange, white stringy strands of something.

It may have been a bloodbath of a scene, and my stomach felt like Hensley 5 was about to be born, but there was at least no sign of the angel. Ann and I moved forward.

Each of us took a side of the bed, gingerly approaching the corpse and inspecting it carefully. It was clear by the collective abject look of horror that neither of us knew how to go about freeing the poor man, but to be fair, the bodies didn’t need to look nice when we dumped them down the shoot. I looked to Ann for confirmation, then together, we reached out.

As I did, I slowed when I noticed the copious amounts of pill bottles flooding the dresser next to me. Hundreds of them with a single, half full glass of water and a brush full of hair.

A gasp snapped me back to the task at hand, but when I saw what Ann had cried out about, I also recoiled in surprise.

A plastic tube that Ann had grabbed and yanked out slithered in her hand, writhing like a snake until she let go. From there, it stood on its end, floating through the air as the rest of its length began to shake and gyrate. While we watched that one, suddenly another unhooked from the flesh with a meaty pop, then did the same. Then another, and another. Ann and I were each backed to an opposite wall by the time all the tubes had untangled themselves and made a bush of blood-leaking bramble. Neither of us knew what to do; stay still or run, but we got our answer when something else moved.

The blankets that the corpse was laying on.

Ann and I’s eyes connected, and I could see we put it together at the same time. When we’d seen the angel in the basement, it had no legs, only ragged flash that resembled a sheet.

Ann shot her head to the side, then ducked in the closet tossing me a glance before closing the door most of the way. Meanwhile, on my side, I did the same with the bathroom, watching in horror as the edges of the sheet floated up and slithered together, giving form to what once wasn’t there. Backing all the way to the bathtub and into the dark, I kicked my legs over the edge and hid behind the curtain, peering out and holding my breath as I tried to see through the crack.

Over the bed, the tubes, flesh, and white tendons all began knotting and hugging together with repulsive squeaks and squelches. Before long, they once again resembled the figure we’d seen in the basement, and to top it off, the creature stretched its arms out wide while its back sprouted spaghetti-like tendrils into the air. Eventually, they hardened, making its wings once more, and the beast let out a chilling hum.

*“Haaaaaaah…”*

I didn’t move. I didn’t breath. I didn’t do anything. Had it seen us? How much could it ‘see’ while it was sleeping like that? My heart was a drum in my chest as I watched it hovering over the bed, the body now a crumpled doll beneath its robe. It began to pivot in place, as if looking around, and I ducked fully behind the curtain before it could get to me.

*“Hmmmmm…”*

I shut my eyes tightly and clenched my jaw, saying litanies of pleas over and over in my head that the sick angel didn’t know where Ann and I were. After a moment, I chanced a look again, finding that it had returned looking toward the hallway door we’d left open. To my relief, instead of moving toward the closet or toward me, it glided from the bed and out of sight toward the rest of the house.

*“Shhhhhh…”*

As it went, something about its tune began to cling in my head like a catchy song. Something about it touched a part of my brain with a specific scratch. It sounded familiar, almost. So familiar, yet far too broken to be the tune I knew. Combining some of the notes I’d heard over our encounters together, I realized that I wasn’t crazy. The angel was singing my mother’s lullaby.

Waiting a few more moments, I finally stepped out of the tub, then held my breath as I moved for the door. I made sure it was out of the room first before exiting the bathroom, then, even more carefully, leaned till my peripheral could barely see down the hall. There at the end, the angel was hovering, trying to sense any disturbance in its domain. It seemed to loom near the doors we’d opened with interest, and when it found nothing, it sank through the floor without a sound.

The timer was running now, and the original plan was back on track. I moved to the closet door and peered through, calling out to Ann.

I saw the glint of her eye before she fully opened the door, then I took her arm and tugged her close. “We need to move,” I told her, practically mouthing it.

Both of us scrambled to the bed, our hearts pounding in our chests. We untangled the body to get it in position to hoist, and as we did, we both kept tossing looks down the hallway in case the guard of the home decided to come back. When we were ready, Ann and I hoisted him up with a grunt, struggling as we began moving for the door.

I had the pleasure of carrying his top half. It wasn’t fun looking down to check my footing and seeing the bloody maw and sockets gasping up at me; a reminder of what would happen should we get caught.

‘The walk isn’t far,’ I kept telling myself with each muffled huff, ‘Just down the hall, the stairs, then we’re home free.’

In our sickness-ridden states, we basically equated the strength of one normal person, and while I’d hauled plenty of bodies so far, that was only to a cart a few feet away. Trying to carry a grown man silently through a home and down a flight of stairs was a whole other story, and by the time we reached the top of the steps, I was fading fast. Adrenaline was keeping me going, but even that was in short supply due to malnutrition.

After listening to be sure we were in the clear, Ann took the first step down, and I followed suit, then we did another, and another. Each creak was like a gunshot filling the space, and as more of the living room came into view, I was terrified that I’d see the angel waiting there for us.

Maybe instead of the living room, my eyes should have been on where I was walking.

With the soft dust covering the hard steps, my foot hit the wood then slipped, and my tired body staggered easily, unable to recover. I caught myself against the wall, but my boot continued to slide until it hit the railing. That alone didn’t make much noise, but my body went numb as I watched a pill bottle tucked between the bars of the railing go sailing over the edge. I looked to Ann, then a second later, it hit the ground.

*Thoc-tok-tok-tok!*

The bouncing plastic case wasn’t cushioned by the dust below in the slightest, and it made sure to let us know that. I could hear the lid pop off from the force followed by pills skittering across the entryway, and before the dreadful song was over, Ann and I were trying to charge the rest of the way down the steps. I could see the door just behind her, only ten feet away; we were so close.

Unfortunately, our new rushing speed caused Ann to suffer the same fate as me, and her foot slipped, sending her crashing to the ground.

She didn’t fall far—only a few steps before catching herself—and as it turned out, this was the most effective way to get the corpse down there as well. The scientist went tumbling over her like a rock, splattering blood as he went, then coming to rest at the bottom. Ann hopped up fast to chase after him, and I tried to as well, but a sharp pain in my foot suddenly made me cry out in pain.

My body instinctively tried to pull away, but it couldn’t. Something held me in place. I looked down to see a pale grey hand with needle nails reaching through the floor and wrapped around my boot.

“Ann!” I screamed for help, trying to kick the thing loose.

She looked back up at me, already bent over and beginning to drag the body, but she froze when she saw the situation. Her eyes traced back up to lock mine, but she didn’t release the body. She didn’t move or do anything. She was either in shock, or making fast calculations.

Whatever it was, it wasn’t fast enough. Suddenly, I felt my bottom half go numb. Utterly and completely numb. I could no longer sense anything beneath my waist; no temperature, no pain, no touch—nothing. It was as if all I ever had was a torso.

My body sunk through the floor, and in panic, I flailed my arms out to catch myself on the step. I was just a chest, neck and head holding above the ground now. I locked eyes with Ann once again, but I didn’t call out this time. I didn’t even know if there was anything she could do at that point. Still, part of me looked to her desperately like she was an angel herself. A divine being that could pull a miracle out of her pocket to free me.

I didn’t expect Ann to try to save me. I hadn’t expected it when Hope had done so for me. But I at least expected to see more remorse on her face when she pulled her eyes away, and yanked the body toward the front door.

The last thing I saw before a pain shot through my calf and I felt the rest of my body go numb was Ann opening the front door and attempting to haul the corpse through it. I fell the rest of the way after that.

My senses came back to me just in time for me to hit the ground. All feeling returned as the wind was knocked from my lungs. My brittle bones rattled beneath my skin, and if I hadn’t landed with all parts equally spread out, I surely would have snapped one like a twig. I certainly had a concussion regardless. The space I found myself in blurred and swirled with darkness as my vision flashed with pain. Above me, I could see the angel looking down, cocking its swollen head with curiosity.

I still couldn’t make out a face (if it even had one), but I could sense that it looked hungry.

*“Shhhhhh…”* it said, slowly reaching its hand out.

I looked away from it and back to the ceiling. I didn’t want my final moments gasping in agony to be looking at that thing. It figured that my resting place would be a home that I despised so much; so was my lot in life. As my thoughts flashed rapidly with that dour concept, however, I finally was able to gasp in a breath of air, and what I smelled in it brought me a sense of peace.

Mom’s coat. I had been pulled through the steps into the coat closet. Suddenly the memories weren’t of the house anymore. They weren’t of the house or of the angel or of Dad or Trevor or my clones. They were of the mall at Christmas time. They were of warmth fighting cold. They were of hot chocolate and my mother’s laughter, tight in her arms. Chasing my troubles away.

It was pleasant. It was calm.

Since the day I found out I was dying, I’ve thought a lot about the moment it would happen. About what kind of person I would be. I didn’t want to go out kicking and screaming. I didn’t want to be afraid. When my mom died, so many people were scared for her in her final moments. Scared that they couldn’t stop what they so badly wanted to. Sadness and grief and panic all gush to the surface when somebody you love is slipping through your fingers like dust in a broken house. My mom, though—she was calm. She was smiling. The last words she ever said to us was ‘I love you’ without a tremble in her tone.

I couldn’t live up to my mother in that moment. I was terrified. But those memories of the coat made the failure slide down easier.

Suddenly, a scream shattered through the fog in my ears. My swirling head refocused at the jarring nature of it, and my eyes snapped open in surprise. I still couldn’t see clearly in the blur of darkness and blue light bleeding from the hall, but I did see the coats above me go flying forward hard. They tangled and wrapped around the angel, stunning it for a moment on sheer confusion alone. It was more than enough time for the person who had whipped the jackets in the first place to take my hands and start dragging me.

I was tugged back into the hall, sliding easily across the dusty hardwood with my body facing the stairs. I watched the angel effortlessly phase through them and glide toward us as my savior continued pulling me toward the exit. The creature was so unbelievably close to catching up, but just as it reached its hand out, we passed through the doorway and out onto the porch.

The beast’s hand left the building, then crumpled to black, glittery sand before my eyes. In shock, it recoiled, then just ominously stared, anger seething from its shadowy figure. Thankfully, the person dragging me didn’t stop moving.

We made it to the lawn before Hope finally dropped my hands and fell next to me, pulling me into a tight hug.

“You’re two for two now,” I told her shoulder, a violent shake undercutting my quippy tone.

“I told you it was a bad idea,” She scoffed.

Pulling away, I looked behind her to see June staring in shock, and Ann behind her, wide eyed that I was actually still alive. Next to her was the thing we’d charged in for in the first place.  

With a sigh of relief, I shook my head, “What are you two even doing here? I thought you were going to unlock the compound?”

“The code didn’t work,” Hope told us, “We tried everything and a ton of combos, but it’s just not right. Don’t worry, though, we’ve found something else just as interesting.”

“What is it?” I asked.

Hope shook her head, “Later. You’re hurt. We need to get that cleaned up and dressed.”

I looked at the blood soaking my leg, along with the puncture through my boot. After what had just happened, I couldn’t even argue.

Hope helped me up then supported me as we moved, while June helped Ann load the body into our wheelbarrow. I happened to lock eyes with her as I passed, but she just looked away quickly in guilt. She didn’t need to; like I said, I wasn’t upset with her for leaving me.

The whole ordeal did give me a lot more insight into how Ann thinks, however. I don’t know if I can count on her to have my back in the future; a scary thought considering she *is* me.

For now, though, I’m alive. In pain and concussed, but alive. Maybe now that I have to take it easy for a bit while I heal, I can work at trying to get the signal better again. I’m still dying to know what you’re all making of this.

Thanks for sticking with me so far. I’ll update you again soon.
