Hey, it’s been a couple days. If you can believe it, more weird stuff happened at the store.

I trained the new guy the other day, and he had a *hell* of a first day. I managed to find an old laptop in my parents’ basement, so there’s an actual way for the others to write about their experiences now.

This is how the new guy’s first day went.

--------------------------------------------------------

New guy here.

The name’s Joshua, and they have me working on one of the registers because those three numbskulls (I’m sure I don’t have to specify) can’t seem to do it.

Anyways, my first shift was definitely the most interesting of any first shift I’ve had at a job before.

 Looking through earlier posts, Ollie described the store feeling as though it was “built above the grounds of hell”, and I could not agree more.

Speaking of Ollie, he was actually there to help train me during my first shift. It was during the evening.

Him and I were discussing how to distribute change in the register when the lights went out.

“Ah, that can’t be good.” Ollie said as he went to look for a flashlight in the back.

While he was gone, the strangest thing happened.

I heard a humming just outside the store, and that was followed up with a blaring, strobing green light that definitely tipped my “weirded out” scale to the negative side.

Ollie came back with the flashlight before looking at the green light, and then at me.

“I’ll keep it just in case.”

After a few minutes, the humming stopped, and we heard a sort of mechanical “shunk” noise. The light switched from the strobing green to a still white.

We heard one final set of whirring, and then we heard footsteps.

The automatic doors dinged, and in walked a group of short, skinny, gray men with huge heads and large, black bulbous eyes.

I looked into said eyes before turning to Ollie.

“Am I tripping?”

“I don’t think so.”

The lead alien walked up to me, yeah, ME, and greeted, well, ME.

“Hello, where is your leader?”

I was a bit confused, but responded in the most professional way I could.

“Like, our manager or—?”

“Don’t think so,” Ollie interjected, “they gotta mean the president or something like that.”

I wasn’t completely sure myself that what was in front of me was real, but the guy who interviewed me did say I’d see some weird things.

Hey… now that I think of it, the interviewer kind of looked like Spike in a wig.

Sorry, getting off track, I’ve got to write this quickly, as I only have 30 minutes to do so during my break.

“Your manager,” the alien asked, “does he rule this planet?”

“No, he does help to run this place, though.”

“I suppose we should consider looking elsewhere, then.”

I suppose Ollie wanted to make a quick buck, because he spoke up again.

“H—hey! Do you guys wanna buy something before you go? I’ve heard space is kinda unforgiving.”

The lead alien pondered for a moment.

“I suppose. Allow us an exploration of this establishment.”

After about 15 minutes of looking around, they finally came to our register with literally all of our protein bars… like, just all of them. Real bummer, I wanted to try some too.

Strangely enough, they also came with a cat.

“Hey,” Ollie said, looking at it, “can that thing change sizes by chance?”

The alien’s eyes somehow managed to grow bigger from surprise despite already being the size of mangoes.

“Why, yes, it can. We lost him a while back and have been looking for him since. We sincerely hope he did not cause you any trouble.”

“Nope.” Ollie said. His eyes told me *yes*.

He finished ringing them up and they left.

I looked at Ollie and he looked at me.

“What’d that cat do?”

“It destroyed the store like a month ago. Real pain in the dick if you ask me.”

That explained his reaction.

“Well,” I said, “suppose my first day was certainly more interesting than most, huh?”  

Ollie looked at me, his face wrought with sadness.

“This’s just the tip of the iceberg, Josh. None of us who work here started out knowing how to. The reason this job has a near 100% hire rate is because we’re nothing more than expendable *meatbags*.”

He took a breath before continuing. 

“Our current set of working members just so happens to be a little luckier than the last. Kent wasn’t the first manager, and we certainly weren’t the first team.”

Well, that was a lot. I guess this place has him pretty rattled, and for only $15/hr? I wonder why the guy hasn’t just decided to quit his job yet.

Something’s nagging at me, though.

Maybe he can’t quit.

Maybe nobody here can quit.

Ah, looks like my break is just about up, guess I’ll see what comes into the store next. This is Josh signing off. Write to y’all later.

--------------------------------------------------------

So, we finally have something to write about our experiences on, huh? Well, I suppose the legendary Spike can finally dust off some old anecdotes.

Mind you, these sets of stories were from when I started working at the store around late 2024.

Basically; these stories don’t have Ollie, Lily, Clyde or Josh. Sorry :/.

Anyways, I don’t like telling this one as much as the other, but I think you guys should be aware of what walks the Earth with us.

So, this is the story of how two of my coworkers were murdered by a gothic fairy tale.

 

**Halloween 2024, Part One.**

To clear it up, the two coworkers were a girl named Hayley, and a guy named Dexter.

Dex and I had just finished the last of the decorating for the holiday. We had spoken with Kent and he had agreed to let us turn the store into a haunted house. Sick.

The layout was as follows; the main entrance was set up as a check in for anyone wanting to do the haunted house. Hayley, between the three of us, was the least off-putting.

That’s why we chose her to guide people in and receive entrance fees.

I’m not as good as I used to be, but there was a period of time before this when I was a bit more social. With that in mind, I was tasked with being the tour guide.

Dexter was tall, like, TALL. Taller than me, and I’m 6’3, so he was (give-or-take) like 6’7.

So, obviously he was chosen to be the “monster”. We set up the house with passages on the sides of the main hallway. This was done so Dex could move about the house a bit more easily.

We had the idea to make him a reoccurring monster. It was done to instill the “I’m being followed” fear in someone and like definitely 100% NOT because we didn’t have the money for more costumes or makeup.

Dex didn’t end up being the only monster present that night.

But God did I wish he was.

Hayley would text me once if someone made it through by paying. If that didn’t happen, then she’d call me. I managed to find a decent guide outfit. It was just some dress pants, an orange button up and a black tie.

I awaited the hopeful rush of thrill-seekers.

I felt the ***VMBT*** in my pocket and knew that the first “however many” customers paid and got through all good and nice.

“Welcome to the Fallscean Market Haunted House. I hope you’re ready to get scared!”

“Okay.” Responded one of the customers, a teenage boy.

“Scare me.”

I began the tour.

The hallway had a couple left and right turns. At the first turn, Dexter jumped out at us with a—

“***BLGRAUGH!***”

To my complete surprise, some of the kids actually got scared! Unbelievable!

Dexter, in all of the chaos, slinked back into the darkness and I helped the kids collect themselves.

“That was creepy,” I said, “let’s keep going, he might still be here.”

We pressed onwards.

We made it to a right turn this time.

Dexter was supposed to pop out and act like he was chasing us with a fake chainsaw.

He was *supposed* to, and he didn’t.

Before he popped out, I felt a steady, repeating vibration in my pocket.

*Hayley was calling me*.

**Halloween 2024, Part Two.**

Hayley was calling me.

Someone managed to get in here without paying.

I had to drop and act and break the bad news to the kids.

Much to their dismay, I notified them of the events and about how we unfortunately needed to cut the tour short.

As we turned around, Dexter came rolling out of the darkness.

He looked to be crawling and bobbing his head.

I looked a little closer and staggered back, shielding the kids.

It was his head.

It was Dexter’s decapitated head rolling around.

“Fuck.” I said under my breath. I had to focus on keeping these kids as well as myself safe. The only concern was whatever the hell just killed Dexter.

Before I could do anything else, I heard a snort followed up by a neigh. 

Then, as though the first act couldn’t be without the second and third, Dexter’s headless corpse was thrown at me.

To my complete disgust, he had been cut open and I was now soaked in his blood and God-Only-Knows what else. 

His bloody body slumped to the floor, organs spilling out and securing themselves a spot among the decorations for the holiday.

I looked up and saw the source of my terror.

It was a man riding a horse… but he didn’t have a head. He didn’t have a GODDAMN HEAD and he was riding that horse.

He held a sword in his right hand, the reins for the steed in his left.

He was clad in an outfit similar to [this one](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ae/1e/9a/ae1e9aa94ed28aeb95330d7b9666a1aa.jpg), minus the head and all.

As he approached, I could only think of one thing.

“How in the hell am I going to get out of here?”

Well, I’ll tell you how I managed to do it.

I had to think of something, so I grabbed Dexter’s head (sorry man, it was life or death, R.I.P though) and lobbed it at the Deathly Horseman.

Somehow, it managed to catch him off guard. Using this to my advantage, I told the kids to haul ass out of there shortly before doing it myself.

Making it to the entrance of the store, the two kids ran out and I couldn’t have been happier.

“The hell is happening?!” Hayley yelled, looking at me.

“We gotta get the fuck out of here. I’ll tell you la—”

My rambling was interrupted by a swift slice.

I felt myself up. I was fine, which meant that it was directed at someone else.

“S—Spike? Wha—whasch hashpeningh?”

I watched as Hayley struggled not just to speak through a mouthful of blood, but to keep her top half as, well, her top half.

As her upper body slid to the ground with a disgusting splat, the rider came closer and closer to me.

I didn’t have time to mourn.

It was all I could do to not break down and lose my mind right there at the entrance of the store. I had to get out of here.

I burst out of the doors and managed to make it to my car all while the horseman raged on behind me.

He was nearly on my when I started the vehicle and gassed it.

I just kept driving and driving. I hadn’t realized how much time passed until I saw the first rays of sunlight peeking over the horizon.

I slammed on my brakes. The horseman didn’t. Unable to quell his momentum, slammed into the back of my car. 

This resulted in it flying over the hood and landing in front of me.

I heard a woosh and saw the horse disintegrate into a swirl of ashes. 

I looked back at the rider and saw as he followed his steed, ascending to ashes and disintegrating just as it had.

I can’t remember what happened after that. I think Kent might have paid the police off. Either that, or the forces that torment this store wouldn’t allow it to shut down.

Well, I’ve told Ollie, Lily, and Clyde about this. Haven’t told Josh yet, but I’ll get around to it.

I’m going home. I need to sleep.

This is Spike, signing off.

Stop by sometime, and buy something if you can.

Until next time.

-EDIT-

I’m writing this from my phone right now. You remember those cultists from previous parts?

I think one of them is sneaking around outside my house right now. I’ll update this post again tomorrow if nothing ends up happening to me.

-EDIT 2-

Still around, but I heard the cultist from last night muttering just outside my window. Most of it was unintelligible but I could hear one word consistently.

*Mortis*. Whatever that means. I’ll update you guys again, Spike out.
