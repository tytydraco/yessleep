Sometimes, trying to remember is like picking a scab. You pry at the callous bits, twisting, peeling, until it ruptures, and all the nasty spills out. Before long an even harder shell forms over the wound.

It's just like that when I remember my brother Matty. Like one big gaping scab leaking nauseating glimpses of the past.

I tried to focus on the dark pavement that ran like a treadmill under my car. Mom's house was close.

There was an image in my mind. A row of worn leather seats. The tinted window of a school bus. We were stopped in front of an enormous building and the driver was waving us off. There was someone else on the bus with me. I stepped outside and waited for the mechanical lift to lower.

The rest of our class had arrived before us, buzzing around the entrance. The mechanical lift shuddered to a halt. I turned and there was Matty, snug in his wheelchair, a fuzzy blue blanket draped across his legs.

He hated riding that bus alone. It was a stubby thing, but the only vehicle at our school with accommodations for Matty. Our teacher, Mrs. Gavin, allowed me to ride with him and together that short bus became a limousine.

Matty and I brought up the rear as the field trip’s teeming mass of children funneled into the building. We were accompanied by Ms. Riya. She was a resource teacher, always next to Matty and keeping him company and making him laugh. She was very young, probably freshly graduated, and very pretty. Matty and I loved her.

"Ms. Riya, what is this place," I asked.

"This is where scientists work,” Ms. Riya said. “They do experiments here, and invent things to help people all over the world."

She looked down at Matty and squeezed his hand, "Come on."

The class *ooo'd* and *ahh'd* at the things they saw. Their squeals rebounded off the curved walls to create an echo chamber of wonder and amazement.

"Look," Ms. Riya pointed.

The area we entered had all sorts of infographics: Diagrams showing the steps of cellular mitosis in the human body, the stages of decomposition taken place in a small fox, a series of photos depicting a middle-aged amputee whose missing limb seems to grow from a pathetic stump, to a small nub of flesh, to eventually a glistening raw baby-arm.

"Isn't that amazing?" Ms. Riya shook her head. She grasped a crucifix hanging from her neck. "They're miracles, you know."

Some of these displays made my stomach do somersaults and I looked towards my brother. His eyes shone with burgeoning curiosity.

At the front of the river of kids, a squat woman in a lined suit was speaking with Mrs. Gavin. Mrs. Gavin waved over Ms. Riya. While they spoke I turned to Matty.

"This is cool, right?"

Matty nodded, shifted in his chair. His fuzzy blanket drooped from his knees but he was fixated elsewhere.

"Do you believe in miracles?" he asked softly.

I adjusted the blanket to cover his shriveled legs.

I followed his aqua blue eyes to the timeline photos of the amputee. The magically regrown arm was shaded a disgusting red and had strange blisters on its skin.

"Maybe."

Ms. Riya appeared next to us wearing one of her beautiful smiles.

"Matty, I've got a surprise for you," she beamed at him. "Do you wanna see something cool?"

He thought for a second. "As long as my brother can come with."

The three of us followed the squat woman in the lined suit. We listened to her heels click against the cold floor, making our way through a labyrinth of hallways and doors.

We avoided stairs, taking an elevator that descended a few floors before stopping.

Soon, we had arrived in front of a door. A window filled the wall next to it where we could satisfy our hungry eyes. Inside, a laboratory; three long tables with an assortment of tall glass tubes, microscopes, and other equipment. In the corner, a fume hood, refrigerator, IV stands and blood pressure cuffs. In the back were four large plastic panels from floor to ceiling, creating a transparent cell with a chair in the middle.

There were four men in oversized white coats, one of them with a familiar face walking towards the door. It clicked and opened.

"Dad!"

He smiled and bent over to hug Matty and then me.

"Hey, kiddos. Want to see what Dad's working on?"

"Yea!”, “Yes!" Matty and both chimed in.

Dad smiled.

He told the squat woman in the suit thanks. She nodded and left.

"I'm sorry," he turned to Ms. Riya. "With the boys now, this room exceeds its recommended capacity. Is it alright if I ask you to wait outside?"

Ms. Riya hesitated.

"Don't worry," Dad soothed her. "Nothing in the lab can harm them so long as my colleagues and I are present."

"Of course, Doctor."

Then we were moving, under the stinging fluorescent lights of the lab, past the black-top tables with their arsenal of tools, towards the back where the plastic cell stood. As we approached, the three scientists searched Matty with greedy eyes.

"Matty, do you remember what we talked about? Last week, before bed."

Matty remembered and nodded.

I turned around and saw Ms. Riya watching from behind the window. She gave a reassuring wave.

"These are my friends, Matty. We've been working for a long, *long* time."

Dad flipped a lever on the plastic cell. One of the walls slid open.

"Now, I can promise you today, you'll walk out of this building all by yourself. On your own two feet."

The wheelchair shook.

"Really?" Matty asked. He looked down at his useless limbs. "I will walk? You promise?"

"Soon, buddy. Promise."

“I will *walk*…” he repeated it, a statement this time, carefully studying each word as it came out of his mouth.

"How?" I asked.

Dad motioned into the cell. An invitation. The chair meant to hold him was equipped with restraints.

"Will it hurt?"

"No, I promise. You're not going to feel anything."

Dad's coworkers avoided eye contact.

Matty gripped my hand.

"Can -"

"No, Matty." Dad said, beginning to sound impatient. He came close, lowered himself to eye level with us.

"Son, you are more important to me than anything. It kills me when I see you looking at the kids on the park. Don’t you see? My heart aches when the soccer ball bounces to you on the sidelines. I will make sure nothing, nothing bad happens to you. I'm trying to make you whole again. Do you want the same thing, Matty? Do you trust me?"

Matty hugged Dad with tears in his eyes. He took his hand and allowed the scientists to roll him into the cell. He trembled as they removed his blanket, scooped him up, and gently set him down again.

Then the restraints. The final strap went tight across his forehead.

A rapping sound came from behind me. Ms. Riya knocking on the glass, her lips making shapes with no sounds.

"Dad?" Matty looked uncomfortable.

"It's okay." He looked at one of his colleagues, and nodded towards me. "Take him with you."

The disappointed scientist grabbed my hand and led me out.

Ms. Riya pulled me away as soon as we were through the door.

"What are you doing to him?"

She tried to slip past into the lab but the scientist pushed her back and shut the door.

"Get off!" Ms. Riya shouted.

"Stop," the man in the lab coat said. He held his hands up, more interested in getting a view from the window. "He asked his father to do it. He wants to see what it feels like strapped in."

From here we could only watch as Dad began to work faster. He and his remaining colleagues rushed to put on gloves, masks, and gowns before Dad hurried to a far corner.

"What is that?" Ms. Riya questioned.

One of the colleagues in the room had grabbed a syringe filled with black fluid from the table.

"Hey," Ms. Riya grabbed the shoulder of the scientist.

He sputtered, pulling away, "I said stop!" He snapped his attention back to the lab. "Finally, we get to see our results. You will see, too."

Marching back to Matty was Dad, gripping an odd shaft of wood in his hands. He hefted it onto his shoulder.

"Oh my God," Ms. Riya's eyes widened.

An axe, three feet long and with a steel head. Glistening and winking with each step, it glittered brand new in the sterile light. When Dad re-entered the cell, the color drained from Matty's face.

"Matty!"

Ms. Riya was running down the hall.

"Shit."

The scientist next to me banged on the window and took off after her. Dad must've known because the next thing he did was raise the axe over his head.

Matty thrashed against his restraints, splayed his fingers out to reach for something, anything. His ankles were wrestled and his legs pulled taut beneath the blade. Someone jammed the syringe of black liquid into his thigh. In those few seconds, the only thing more chilling than the horror on Matty's face, was the look on Dad's. He was looking directly into my brother's eyes, smiling like it was Christmas morning.

The axe flashed.

I had to swerve to avoid smashing into a mailbox. I slammed on the brakes. When I saw the address in the rearview, I realized I was stopped in front of my childhood home.

It was the early morning, earlier than the sun, and the lonely street had no lamps to illuminate it. My old house hid in the dark, shifting restlessly.

I didn't want to. Maybe if I hadn't had those drinks before making the drive I wouldn't have even put the car in park, just taken my foot off the brake and caught the sunrise on the journey back.

The wooden porch moaned as I ascended and knocked on the door. I wasn't expecting her to answer. She hadn't returned any of the twelve calls I made within the last couple hours.

But to my surprise she did.

Little more than half my height, she wrapped her frail arms around my waist and squeezed with unexpected strength.

She told me what a surprise it was but a wonderful one, and what brought me out to see my mother after so many years.

I couldn't bear to look at her. I peeled her off me and brushed past into the house.

We stood in the living room. My mother attacked at the cuticles on her fingers. She had white, wispy hair that seemed to float around her head.

"Oh, honey, I'm so glad to see you again... but it's a bad time..."

I cut her off with my hand.

"You need to tell me everything.”

The air had gotten deathly quiet. Mom was vigorously fidgeting with herself.

"I think you should come back later," she whispered.

My head was starting to pound. "Stop,” I said, shaking. “Please, just please shut up and sit down."

She listened.

"What's wrong honey, I don't -"

"My brother! What did you do to my brother? What did Dad do to Matty?"

She flinched in her chair, looked toward the basement door.

"Matty? Brother? Are you feeling well?"

It felt like someone was smacking a hammer at the inside of my skull.

I pulled my phone from my pocket. "Mom, I will give you one chance. Or I'm calling the cops."

She clasped her hands in front of her. "Oh, don’t. Don’t. O-Okay... When did you remember?"

Even after speaking with Hunter, it had all felt like a lucid nightmare. But this was it. The smoking gun.

My brother Matty was real.

"What was Dad doing?"

She took a breath before speaking. "He was smart. The smartest person I knew. And if he had a little more time, he could have fixed him."

"Matty didn't need to be fixed."

She snapped, "Oh you, like you would understand! With you're perfectly healthy children. Is that a crime? That we wanted our son to be whole? You know it's what Matty wanted."

"He was a kid! You bastard! You never gave him a choice. Not a real one."

I sagged onto the couch, grabbing the sides of my head, the pain unbearable. Mom was crying, wailing, begging.

Through the tears she trembled, “I sacrificed so much for him.”

“Liar.”

“The money didn’t last forever. And when your father died it was just me and – and, well, I didn’t know what to do.” Her shoulders were heaving. “I hated seeing him in pain. My little Matty. Those terrible things I did to those boys, I'd do it again if-if…”

The words brought a chill to my skin.

“What?”

“He was so hungry, it was impossible. I did it because I love him, I love my baby.”

“Mom –”

A noise cut us off. A moan from behind the basement door.

I stumbled over and flung the door wide. Immediately, that smell, from so many years ago, the one I recognized but could never identify. The smell of Matty’s room. I looked at my mother in shock.

“What have you done?”

Down the steps, two, three at a time until my foot caught on something that almost sent me tumbling face first. The light switch was there at the bottom landing, and I flipped it just as I noticed the wetness covering my foot.

The sole bulb in the center of the room flickered. I had tripped over a head. Decomposing and dead some time ago, it was crushed now and leaking foul liquid. My shoe print was imbedded in its hair.

I had no time to retch as my eyes, not daring to but forced by morbid curiosity, laid upon the rest of the room.

There were only two things in that basement that I could make sense of. Bones and clothes. The rest was a putrid mixture resembling chunky velvet tar. The clothes floated in this tar, permanently stained and bloated by the rotted lake covering the floor. And the bones; too many to count. Femurs, ribs, skulls, vertebrae protruded from the ground, some floating too, decomposed to the point where they were hollow and light.

Only then did I purge my stomach. The splatter of vomit masked the noise of something moving. From the tar an appendage slithered onto the landing. The pale tentacle curled and folded over onto itself, gaining traction like a desert snake over sand. I pushed myself against the wall to avoid it but it had no interest in me. It coiled around the crushed head and dragged it beneath the muck.

I could trace its movement beneath the surface. Bones were knocked loose or pulled along as it headed towards the far end of the basement. Back where the light could not reach. There, another landing rose above the tar. I could see the tentacle pulling itself up onto it.

From the dark, another moan.

“*m… m… muh…”*

I slipped in my vomit trying to flee. I crawled up the first few steps, steadying myself back to my feet, before pushing with everything in my body. My mother stood at the top and I careened past her, pushing her out of the way.

“Honey, don’t tell anyone, please. You understand, right? He was still growing!”

The garage. Bursting through the door, I scrambled, searching through the boxes and junk, tossing them out of the way as I went.

There was bawling from the living room. “I couldn’t just let him starve. By the time your father died we were broke. I couldn’t even pay for a funeral... But he would’ve wanted it. Yes, he wouldn’t have wanted his baby to starve.”

A ringing shrieked in my ears. I found the cannister, unscrewed the cap, and stormed the house leaving a glistening trail behind me. I started in the kitchen. I poured the gas over the table where me and my family used to eat our meals.

“What are you doing!”

In the living room, I covered the couch and the T.V. where Matty and I used to watch cartoons.

I opened the door to the basement and shook more onto the stairs. The tar sloshed in a frenzy below. I threw the cannister down, a quarter full, and made for the front door, fumbling in my pocket.

“Mom, we’re leaving.” I grasped my zippo lighter.

She stood at the back of the living room, tears and snot hanging from her face. She shook her head.

I yelled at her, screamed, “This place will burn!”

But still, she remained. The basement door rattled. Pudgy tentacles were wrapping themselves around the door frame and pulling, hoisting something up the stairs.

One more time. I looked at my mother with tears spilling from my eyes.

“Mom. *Please*.”

She looked towards the basement and covered her face in her hands. Her voice was thin and weak.

“I can’t.”

I choked a sob. I opened the zippo and flicked its flame to life.

“*m- michael.*”

In the basement doorway, the tentacles had pulled a deformed mound of flesh into view. Like the tentacles it was pale, and I could tell it was only a small part of the whole body. Its skin pulsed and stretched but near the apex of it were eyes. A set of moist blue eyes; and even on something so horrible they looked full of despair.

“*michael*,” it said again.

“Matty,” I said. “I’m sorry.”

I dropped the zippo and ran.

---

The fire caught fast and burnt hot. I sat and watched from the car for only a few seconds.

I was still able to catch the sunrise on the way home, though I couldn’t bear to look at it. The glow it cast was the same hue as the flames that licked the siding of my childhood home.

There isn’t much else to say. The bad memories have come, and they are here to stay. But the good ones have started to ebb in, slowly, like a morphine drip dispensing bite sized portions of Heaven. I remember our bus rides together, I remember his cheers at the rec league soccer games I played in, and how he used to help me with my homework. My brother Matty was the best brother I could have asked for.
