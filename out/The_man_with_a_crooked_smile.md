So it happened, I always knew my carelessness would be the death of me. While crossing the road, I was hit by a truck. I had earbuds in, so I didn't hear it hurdling at me (its brakes didn't work)

All I felt was pain, then it was warm and calm. I've been a Christian my whole life, and the warmth I felt was me rising to heaven (I was so wrong). I couldn't see anything but a faint light. It was calling to me. Suddenly, the light faded, and there was nothing but void. Floating, weightless, Void. 

There was a faint light all around me but I couldn't see where it was so I waited.
I could've waited for years. It could've been minutes, but it was miserable. I decided to write in the journal I had in my bag, hoping someone would find it.

Day 1 "I was hit by a truck and found myself floating in the void. I don't know where I am (I'm pretty sure I'm dead)

Day 7 "I'm getting bored my phone died and there was no service anyways"

Day 37? "I saw something I couldn't tell what it was, but it had a human looking body with long stretched out limbs."

Day 50? "I saw more things all were pitch black with no features."

Day 55? "They keep getting closer. I can't run,"
 
Day 60? A leader figure on the shadows appeared it was tall, and it looked about 10 ft.   ( 3.3 m) tall, it just stared at me, but this one had a feature it had a long crooked smile.

Day ??? "I can't even remember how long i've been here. I can't control anything I do,"

The thing approached me. I tried to run or move, but with the feeling of weightlessness, I couldn't. The thing raised its knife like hand up into the air and swung. At that moment, I knew it came to make my time here torturous.

Suddenly, I woke up in a hospital bed. I looked around, and I was in a normal hospital. Except I saw my notebook filled with everything I wrote in it and a note that read "Memento Mori and this is where you'll end up" 

I didn't know what to think, but I just carried on with life. I eventually decided to go to a therapist and tell them all that I saw. As I was leaving, she said wait there is someone else I would like for you to talk to."" The cops arrived, saying I was clinically insane and I had to be taken to a phyc ward. (At least I won't have to pay my medical bills) 

The ward was terrible it was like prison but without contact with other people. So, as I lie in my padded cell, all I can think to myself is what that note meant. I found a Latin book and read the M section. 
Memento mori means "Remember you will die." The note instantly flashed into my head. "Remember you will die, and this is where you'll end up." I shuddered as I said it out loud.


So I was dead, I was about to live life in what looks like hell. As I lay in my cell, I am thankful for modern medicine and how it saved me. I heard a laugh from across my cell, I looked up and saw the man with a crooked smile. He was laughing at the thought I was saved. He then said, "You're not saved. I just thought I could give you false hope." He started laughing again as the world turned dark and slowly went pitch black again. I watched in horror, knowing I couldn't escape this time.
