I'm writing this in hopes someone might be able to help before it's too late.

It all started about a month ago when I was walking home from the bar I work at. It was late by then, and the small town I live in looked like a ghost town. It was honestly pretty creepy and I quickened my step, thankful my house was only a few blocks away.

 I took out my phone and checked the time, 12:32am, and that was when I saw him. I was in the process of putting my phone back in my pocket when I happened to glance across the street and noticed the man standing stock still under a streetlight. He looked to be about 6 maybe 7 feet tall, but it was hard to tell because he wore a very dirty, very old trench coat.

 For some reason the sight of him standing there got to me and I sped-walked the rest of the way home, constantly checking over my shoulder just in case he chose to follow me. I breathed a sigh of relief as I turned onto the pavement leading up to my door and made my way inside, almost unconsciously locking the door behind me. I quickly shook off the creepy feelings from before and plopped down on the couch to eat dinner and relax before bed. The rest of the evening went by fast, I watched a few programs on the TV and decided it was probably time to head upstairs to get some sleep.

I made my way up the stairs and to my room at the end of the hall, making sure to turn off all the lights on the way there. Growing up my dad had always screamed at me for leaving the lights on, saying I would cost him millions, and I guess the rule stuck with me to my adult years. I got to my room and shut the door behind me and began my nighttime routine to get ready for bed. After all that was finished I slipped between the covers and closed my eyes, ready for the morning. All of the sudden I jerked awake and checked the time, 5am, way to early to be up but my body had needs. I quickly used the bathroom and drank some water and headed back to bed, repeating the chore of turning all the lights off.

As I crossed my room I heard a very loud noise outside and jumped. I ran to my window and looked outside, trying to see the source of the disturbance. I held my breath anxiously as I heard more sounds approaching from down the street, getting closer by the moment. I let out a sigh of relief as a couple of drunken teenagers appeared from around the corner of the street and down the sidewalk, singing loud rap songs and swaying back and forth, more than likely on their way home from a party. They passed my house and continued on, still singing, untill they disappeared, engulfed by the early morning fog. 

I turned to go back to bed and froze in my tracks, my eyes fixed to the street below. There, standing maybe 5 houses away, was the same man from before barely visable despite the street lamp he was standing under. "Had he followed me home??" The thought escaped my lips and I started at the sound of my own voice, looking away for a few seconds to compose myself. I glanced at the street again but he had vanished. I look every direction but I couldn't see him so I gave up and returned to bed, giving in to sleep.

Things after that were pretty normal, I went to work, came home, slept and did the whole thing again. I hadn't seen the man since that night and pretty much forgotten about him until a few weeks ago when I decided to have my friend Stacey stay the night. 

She was a nice girl I had met at work and we had become fast friends, bonding over our love for horror movies. A horror movie, in fact, was the reason she was coming over that night. Some new slasher I hadn't heard of had recently come out and she wanted to watch it with me so we planned a sort of sleepover, complete with snacks. I had just finished setting out the various chips and popcorn I had when the doorbell rung and I went to open the door. There stood Stacey, a slightly troubled look on her face and I invited her inside, asking what was the matter. She set down her coat and turned to me "Did you see the man who was behind me on the sidewalk?". Her words made my blood run cold and I quickly walked over to the door and peered through the peephole. Once I was satisfied no one stood there, I turned back and we both headed into the living room, trying to lighten the mood by talking about the new movie. 

We sat down and she put it on and I quickly forgot about the events of earlier and became engrossed in the movie, it was actually pretty good. We watched the movie, talked and ate snacks till the credits came on and it was time for bed. The couch pulled out into a small mattress so that's where she slept and I headed up to my room, once again turning every light off on the way. I stopped for a moment beside my bedroom window but saw nothing outside and got into my bed, quickly succumbing to sleep.

Maybe about an hour later I woke up to a slam downstairs and ran down to see the front door hanging open and Stacey slowly walking across the porch and down the steps. "Hey, Stacey, Whats going on?" I called, but no answer, It's as if she was in a trance. I went to go grab her and get her back in the house but stopped dead in my tracks as I looked at who, or should I say what, she was walking towards. 

It was the man, except this time he looked impossibly tall he wasn't wearing his trench coat. Instead, where the coat should have been was a long cut in the man's chest and stomach and through the gash was unfolding hundreds of arms, long and ghostly white, which reached to grab Stacey. I couldn't move as I watched her get snatched up and seemingly pulling her into the man's torso, her body crunching and cracking as the arms stuffed her corpse inside. After that he smiled and me and put his trench coat back on, raising a finger in a shushing motion and walked away down the street. 

Finally my legs started working again I collapsed onto the carpet, trying to make sense of what I had seen. That.. thing had just shoved my coworker into its damn body.. what if it would come back for me? Unsatisfied with its meal tonight? 

I slammed the door and shakily made my way to the bathroom. After emptying the contents of my stomach, I wiped my mouth and sat down on the toilet, still in shock from what had happened. I went to my room and looked down upon the street below. Looking for any sign I wasn't losing my mind. When no sign showed itself I gave up and went to bed, or at least tried to. I woke the next morning with a massive headache and called into work sick. I popped a couple of advil and sat down on the couch, rubbing my temples. All of the sudden I heard a knock at the door and jumped slightly, the events of last night still playing in my mind. I hesitantly made my way to the front door and looked outside but saw nothing. I opened the door and looked down to see a piece of paper laying on my welcome mat. I picked it up and turned it over to see the two words that sealed my fate, "You're Next". 

I havnt been to work in 2 weeks and I refuse to leave the house, even when friends keep calling me to hangout. I know if I go outside He will get me. There was one night recently I woke up to find myself downstairs with my hand on the front door, ready to open it. I immediately pulled away and ran back upstairs, since then I lock my bedroom door. I know He's coming for me and I don't know how long I have till he gets me. Please, if anyone can help me. Please, I don't want to die.
