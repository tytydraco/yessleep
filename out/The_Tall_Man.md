Dear reader, before I tell my story, I need to start with an important fact. Like everyone here, I’ve always been fascinated by the unknown. Maybe I should credit my dad, who introduced me to horror movies at a young age. But no matter how much I loved the supernatural, it never showed itself to me. Unlike others who hear whispers or see shadows lurking in the corners, I never saw anything. And that only fueled my love for the occult—like a crime with no victims.

My first encounter wasn’t the usual cursed DVD or a spooky game gone wrong. It all started with a dream…

I had just left a happy hour with some coworkers, completely wasted by the time I got home. Like any drunk person, I had two priorities: eat and sleep. After grabbing the easiest thing in my kitchen, I headed to my room. I glanced at my mom’s bedroom—she was already asleep—then dropped all my stuff and crashed onto my bed. Those were my last moments of peace.

I don’t remember exactly when I fell asleep, which made it even weirder when I suddenly woke up, my mouth dry as a desert. My water bottle was empty, forcing me to head to the kitchen. I cursed my past drunk self for not refilling it beforehand. The walk was strange—my TV was on, broadcasting news about a murder.

"Weird," I thought. I was sure I had turned it off earlier.

Feeling uneasy, I kept going to the kitchen. It was oddly bright, like daylight. But the real red flag came when I saw my grandfather sitting at the table, casually reading a newspaper. He looked up, smiled kindly, and started talking about a job opening for me.

"Way too weird," I thought. My grandfather had been dead for two years.

Before I could ask anything, the doorbell rang. I turned toward the sound and saw, through the glass, the torso of an impossibly tall man. He was so tall that his face and neck were out of view. My hand hovered over the doorknob, frozen. A paralyzing fear gripped me—a kind of terror I had never felt before.

When I finally regained control of my body, I did the only thing my fear allowed me to: I grabbed the door with all my strength and screamed for my mother. My voice came out small, fragile—like a scared little kid. And that’s when I realized.

It was all a dream.

I woke up instantly, grabbed my phone, and turned on the flashlight. Nothing. Just my furniture. But I knew something was wrong. The stench of decay filled my room, thick and overwhelming. I had no choice but to lie down and shut my eyes. After all, I was a 26-year-old woman—I couldn’t let a nightmare freak me out, right?

Wrong.

I didn’t sleep at all that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt something lurking in the dark corners of my room. I wasn’t alone.

I gave up trying to sleep and got up two hours earlier than usual for work. I told my coworkers about my dream, more as a way to vent than expecting any answers. As the day went on, I managed to forget about the whole thing. That night, I finally slept in peace.

Or so I thought.

The next morning at work, my friend rushed over, panicked. She had the exact same dream—the only difference was that instead of my grandfather, she saw her father, who had also passed away years ago. After lunch, another coworker said the same thing. And then another. Everyone I had told about my dream had also seen the tall man.

That night, I expected him to return, but… nothing. The next night, nothing again. It was strange—I always dreamed, always. At work, my friend didn’t show up. My boss said she had left for personal reasons, but the office gossip said it was a mental breakdown. Deborah had always talked about overcoming depression, so it seemed possible. I texted her, but she never replied.

Five nights after my last dream, he came back. This time, I got up, saw the same murder report on TV, but instead of my grandfather at the table, it was… Deborah.

She didn’t smile kindly. Her eyes were sunken, as if she hadn’t slept in days. Her mouth stretched into a forced, eerie grin. I knew what was coming next.

“You have to tell them.”

That was all she said before the doorbell rang.

As if possessed, I walked toward the door. He was there—the tall man. Just like before, I could only see his torso. But this time, I was about to open the door. My hands moved on their own. I screamed Deborah’s name over and over as I saw him bending down, trying to enter.

I woke up in my room.

The same foul stench filled the air. I wasn’t alone.

The next morning, I told three more people about the dream and texted Deborah again, worried. Was my dream a warning that something had happened to her? I couldn’t focus at work. I had a terrible feeling that the next time I saw him, calling for help wouldn’t matter—he would get in.

I searched everywhere—urban legends, folklore, horror stories—anything about a tall man like this. Nothing.

And then, the news hit. Deborah had taken her own life. Two days after my last dream.

Her funeral was the next day. Everyone from work was there. As I approached her casket to pay my respects, I froze. Her skin was pale, her sunken eyes barely hidden under layers of makeup. She looked exactly as she had in my dream.

“You have to tell them.”

She screamed it. Right at me. Her dead eyes locked onto mine. I collapsed in terror, my heart pounding so loud I was sure everyone could hear it. Was I dreaming? Had I just hallucinated in broad daylight? I hadn’t slept much the night before, but I wasn’t about to ask if anyone else had heard her.

She was dead. And I was losing my mind.

Sitting at my desk, I finally understood.

The first time I dreamed of the tall man, I told five people. I went five nights without seeing him.

Deborah only told me. He came for her the next day.

The last time I saw him, I only told three.

Today is my last day.

So I’m writing this here. I’m sorry to everyone who reads this. I don’t want to die. This is the only way to escape.

Remember—tell everyone.
