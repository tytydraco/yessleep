I know, I know, it’s been longer than you likely wanted to wait to hear more.

I’ve been in a place the last few days that I’ve been calling DGB 0. It's a place I’ve never been but seems to be where Gale has been staying.

There isn’t any real difference between DG 0 and any other store, but Gale has been living there for…well a long time and says its his kind of base of operations. Whats more, Gale can bring things between stores! When I asked him how, he said it was a trick he had learned and that he might teach me if we had time. I laughed. Time was something we seemed to have a lot of. I honestly couldn’t tell you how long I’ve been here. It never gets light out, there are no clocks inside the store, my phone time changes but sometimes the dates and years jump ahead by years or back by centuries. Right now it says its 32:78 on Fronday in Mebtember in 1632. I haven't received any replies to any of my messages or posts, but I honestly haven’t checked much. I don’t even really know if you guys are getting these anymore. I haven’t seen a reply since the first installment, so if I haven’t been responding, don’t take it personal.

I’ve certainly been a little busy, after all.

Before we go one, some differences between 0 and the other stores.

But, onto what you’re dying to know.

Gale is a middle aged guy, probably about forty or forty five. He’s still wearing his Dollar General uniform, complete with name badge, and he says that no matter what happens it always comes back. The only thing that seems to stay with him are the bags under his eyes, and the guy looks tired. He made us dinner, soup and sandwiches, and toasted me with a pop from a brand I wasn’t familiar with but turned out to be ginger ale. After eating a couple of bowls of stew and about three sandwiches, I hadn’t eaten much of substances in a few days, we started talking.

I told him about my life as a wage slave, and he commiserated.

“I know what that's like. I had actually just been transferred to this store when I got stuck here.”

“How long ago was that?” I asked, sitting back in the wicker chair he had brought from somewhere else and listening to it creek comfortably.

“Who knows?” Gale said, “When I left the world as I knew it it was 1998 and I had just been sent to South Dakota to manage a new store. “It’s more pay and you can pick your own crew.” my boss had said and I was glad of more money. My ex wife had just petitioned for more child support, the third time in as many years, and I was just trying to keep fed in a bed with my head above water.” he said, laughing as he took a sip if the green can that called itself Sea-O-Firm, “So I left Scottsdale where I had been managing one of the few remaining J.L Turner and Sons, and after looking through some applications I decided that I liked the look of Kenneth, Celene, and Margo.”

“Oh yeah, wait, I remember there was another name on your memorial. When did Rudy come along?”

Gale looked away then, and I tried not to notice as he teared up a little.

“Oh yeah, how could I forget Rudy? I had been working at the store for a few months when he called me. Rudy was a lot older than his sister, from my first marriage when I was barely more than a kid myself, and he had been managing his own store in Texas. The store, however, had burned down suddenly one night, and he was wondering if my store had a position. “I know you're the manager, dad, but I’ll do stock work if I need to. The noise around here makes me think that the locals don’t like me anymore than they liked the store and my apartment might go up in smoke next if I stay. Dollar General had run a few of the mom and pop stores in town out of business, you see, and the locals blamed Rudy and DG for that. I called corporate, asked if I could get funding for one more worker, and Rudy came to make it five. We were tight nit, working long hours and trying to compete in the local market. The mom and pops in Chamberlin were dead set against losing business to us, but we held our own and carved out a niche for ourselves. We didn’t run the town, but we did okay.

Then, one night we got robbed. Margo and I were manning the front, Kenneth was in the back, and Celene was staying over to look over the books. She had been an accountant before taking a job that was a little more flexible and I had promised her some overtime if she would help me balance the receipts before our yearly audit next week. I wasn’t even supposed to be there, but I was helping Margo through a busy time before the guy came in. We were getting ready to clean up after closing time so we could pass the audit, and Rudy was coming in around eight to help. We’d all clean for a while and then maintain through Sunday so we could be ready and fresh on monday. We were just getting ready to close the doors at eight, when he barges in and pulls a gun. The guy had to be looking for drug money, he was out of his mind on something, and he rounded all of us up and put us behind the counter. He emptied the register, tried to get the safe but it was on a timer that wouldn’t even open until after ten, and made us empty our pockets and hand over our wallets. I was just thanking the universe that Rudy hadn’t showed up, when he popped up with a pizza after coming through the employee door around back.

Thus, he joined the hostage situation.”

“We all started out behind the counter, but the robber thought that there might be a silent alarm back there. So he moved all of us to break room, but thought we might gang up on his there. There was no door on the breakroom, so he finally decided to put us all in the bathroom and keep us penned up in there while he left. He herded us all through the door and imagine our surprise when we came out in a different Dollar General? It was just like ours, except the doors wouldn’t open. We didn’t think about trying to go back through the bathroom, and good thing too. These Dollar Generals don’t seem to look back on themselves. The bathroom only takes you to a different one, never back the way you came.”

“But you go back to different ones,” I put in.

He smiled, “In due time my friend. You probably remember the first Dollar General you stayed in for a while. I imagine it got a little boring after a while, didn’t it?”

I nodded, telling him it had only taken me about a week to be done with it.

“Well, imagine that times five. At first it a lot of fun. We played games, spent time together, and kind of felt like a real family. Rudy and Margo had been having a not so secret relationship for months and Kenneth and Margo and I hung out a lot outside of work. We cooked dinners, we made crafts, we built puzzles, and for a little while it was great. After a couple of weeks, though, we all started going a little cabin crazy. The sun never rose, the lights never went out, and the doors never opened. We didn’t know how we were being kept here, but some of them started trying to find out.”

He took another sip of the ginger ale as if wetting his throat for a long story, and pressed on.

“It started with Kenneth. Kenneth was an avid hiker and liked to explore. He wanted to see if the space outside the DG was the same as ours, but he couldn’t get the doors open. He pushed and pulled, tried to break the glass, tried to wedge the doors open, but it was no use. He tried for three days to get outside, and on the fourth day something happened, something that showed the rest of us that we might not have been as alone as we thought.

The doors opened.

Kenneth had been shoving at it for most of the day, trying to get the front door open and failing miserably. He finally threw it down, like a child having a tantrum, and kicked it half heartedly with his foot. Then, to his astonishment, it opened as smoothly as it ever had. Outside was nothing but smooth darkness, like the waters of a deep lake by night, and when he took his first step, I told him not to. I felt like something out there was wrong, some place we weren’t meant to go to, but he was powerless to stop himself. He stepped out into that darkness, and as he passed between the doors they slammed shut behind him. I’ve never seen them open like that again, and they never opened for him to come back in again.”

He glanced at the doors to the Dollar General he had chosen to take up residence in, and when I glanced at it I noticed someone had piled things in front of it. Card racks and newspaper racks and other things blocked it, as if it might open and tempt him out again. Some of them weren’t in english, some of them had odd dimensions to them, and it was clear he had ranged wide to find some of these things.

“Then Margo got snatched by whatever lurks in the ceiling. I call it the Miasma, the thing that came after you in the burnt out store. Had you seen it before then?”

“Once,” I admitted.

“Bet it was right after you started messing with the ceiling, wasn’t it?”

I nodded guiltily.

“Rudy and Margo had been looking for a way out as well. They decided that they could get out through the roof, but when they took some of the tiles down, they discovered a deep bank of darkness up there. It was just like the stuff outside the door, and when Rudy reached out to touch it, I told him not to. Rudy was a good kid, and he knew better than to touch something I was that worried about. The two of them were young though, and when they called me over to see something, I watched as he tossed a tennis ball into the void. They had about four empty cans of tennis balls on the floor, and when I asked if they had all gone in, Rudy said they had. When I asked how many had come out, he told me none. I didn’t think anything of it, and when he threw the cans up there, none of them came down either.

I was settling and getting ready for bed, Celene already snoozing on the little sectional pieces we had all pushed in close together, when the light went out.

This was alarming because the lights had never gone out before. The lights stayed on all the time which was why it was so hard to tell what time of day it was or how long you have actually been here. There was a weird growling noise and I heard someone scream from out in the darkness. Something fell over then and I grabbed Celene as the two of us burrowed under our pile of blankets. I was worried for Rudy and Margo, but at that point in time I was more concerned with surviving until the lights came back on. Something stomped close to use, making a lot of racket as it pushed things around, but after a while the lights came on again and we surfaced to find some shelves shoved over and a lot of things crushed and smashed.

Rudy found us not long after that, saying that he and Margo had seen a monster come out of the ceiling. It had grabbed her as he ran for the managers office and when the lights came back on he had found the same mess we had. When I asked him what it looked like, he said it was hard to tell with the lights off. He drew that picture you saw in the breakroom and for a while that was the best description we had of the Miasma. 

Rudy was sullen for a few days, looking at the hole in the ceiling, but I told him to leave it be. It had clearly come out because we had messed with it and if we left it alone, it would leave us alone. He wanted to go look for Margo, said he thought if he went up there he might be able to find her, but I told him to forget about it. We had lost two people already, and the thought of losing my son was difficult to think about.

About three days later I woke up to find a letter saying he was going to find Margo and a ladder set up directly under the ceiling.

I climbed it, meaning to go in and get him back, but after standing on that top rung and looking into the murk for nearly an hour I finally climbed down and put the ladder away. 

It was just Celene and I.”

We sat in silence for a few minutes lounging on the padded sectional pieces that I now questioned whether or not had once been their sleeping arrangement?

“I’m tired,” he said, his voice hollow as he lay back, “Lets continue this after some shut eye.”

He rolled away from me, facing the chocolate upholstery, but I doubted he slept.

At some point I dozed off after trying to ignore his quiet sobbing, and woke up to find coffee, eggs, bacon, and toast.

“Figured you might want a nice hot breakfast after what we went through yesterday with that thing. Don’t worry, it's all scavenged from stores like ours. None of its human meat or weird animal parts or anything.”

I hadn’t thought of that, but it was certainly an interesting concept.

As we ate, he finished.

“Celene went last and she may not even be dead. I was distraught after Rudy, just sitting there and feeling sorry for myself, but Celene had been experimenting with the door we had come through. She told me how she opened it to find yet another Dollar General beyond that and when she threw things into it, they came back. I just sat, not taking in any of it, and then one day she came up to me and said she was leaving. I looked up to find she was wearing a backpack and had put on a floppy gardening hat.

“Going?” I asked, not understanding, “Going where? We can’t go anywhere. We’re stuck here.”

“The food is beginning to dwindle, even with just the two of us eating. It won’t last much longer andI don’t intend to starve here. If that doorway took us here, then it can take us out again maybe. Come with me, even if we go somewhere else, its got to be better than here. There might be food or maybe Rudy and MArgo or there. Maybe Kenneth is somewhere different too. Either way, if we stay here, we’re going to die. Come with me, we can start over somewhere else.”

I wanted to, I really did, but at that point I was at my lowest. My family had abandoned me, my son had left too, and now the last of my friends was deserting me. I turned away, saying nothing, and when she left, I just sat there. She never came, at least not as far as I know, and I’ve never seen her in any of the stores I’ve traveled to. I sat there for a long time, just stewing, but eventually I was down to canned goods and the big jugs of water. When the water ran out, I drank from the fountain. When the canned good ran out, however, I started looking at the door too. There was food on the other side of that door, I could see it, and without thinking about it, I stepped through.

I was in a brand new Dollar General, fully stocked with food and set up for Christmas and that was how it all started. I never stayed long in any store then. I just kept moving, hoping I would find Celene or Rudy or anyone. I found a few people, but the ones I found were usually scared or half crazy and I moved on quickly. One fella, an older guy in a half destroyed store, stabbed me with pruning shears as I went through his place!”

I gasped, but when he pulled up his shirt and pointed at a spot about midway up his belly I didn’t see anything. Not a scar, not a red mark, nothing. It looked as fresh as new skin, and he laughed when I looked surprised.

“Luckily for me I was close enough to the door to make it through, and that's when I made my biggest discovery. I fell through the door, grabbing at the shears so I didn’t push them in deeper, and found they were gone. So was the wound. You’ve probably noticed that no matter how ragged your clothes get that they always repair themselves when you pass through the door, right? Well, it's the same with your body. Burns, cuts, stabs, they all heal when you go to a new store. I’ve had all manner of things wrong with me, but a new store always means a new me.”

We sat there for a few minutes, each of us digesting something different it seemed.

“Did you ever find Rudy or Margo or Kenneth?” I finally asked, already guessing the answer.

It was several minutes before he responded, and I wasn’t sure he would for a minute.

“No,” he finally said, “They went beyond the Dollar General Beyond. The store protects us, insulates us to a certain degree, but if we go beyond, then we are lost. I’ve watched the store change over the years, new items added, new layouts and concepts, but I’ve stayed the same. I was forty three in 98, and I still look exactly the same as I did then. I haven’t aged, and neither will you. The store traps us, keeps us like this, and plays with us until it inevitably breaks us, and there's nothing we can do about it.”

He looked sad, but when he turned back, his smile had returned.

“But,” he said, “there are things we can do to make it harder for them to break us. Things I can show you.”

Gales promised to teach me what he knows, and I’m eager to learn. I think I’ve shared enough for now. Gales asleep and I can tell that the tapping from my phone is bothering him. I’ll update you guys again a little later. Until then, don’t get stuck in the Dollar General Beyond either, or we might have to come find you as well.

Till next time.
