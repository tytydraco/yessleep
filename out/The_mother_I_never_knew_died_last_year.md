“You were a very difficult man to track down!” Mr. Lunceford’s inauthentic smile was half masked by the handkerchief he used to mop the sweat from his red swollen face. Five flights of stairs had taken their toll on his heavy frame. The elevator had been broken in my friend’s apartment building for as long as I could remember. A simple “In Service” sign taped to the metal doors had been there long enough too yellow with age.   

The man sucked greedily on the lukewarm glass of water I had offered him. I watched his throat convulse with each gulp. I fidgeted awkwardly with my hands, fighting back nervous energy.  

He slapped the glass down on a makeshift coffee table, using his handkerchief again to wipe daintily at his fat lips.   

“I’ll say again, it was no easy trick finding you young man. But I believe it is in both of our best interests that I follow through on your mother’s last wishes.” His heavy southern accent was nearly slurred with enthusiasm. 

My sofa groaned in complaint as he reached down for his bulging leather briefcase.   

I sat very still, absorbing his words. Words that had convinced me to invite him inside. My mother, a woman I had never met, was dead. This would not be the first time I had mourned for her. Aunt Heather had never spoken of any of my family. For my entire life, I had nothing but my imagination to go off. The women had withheld any and all information from me. About who I was, where I came from, and how I had ended up in her care. Now, an early onset of dementia permanently concealed her secrets.  I hadn’t spoken to her in years.   

This man offered me an open door when I had been clawing at boarded-up windows. For someone like me, it seemed too good to be true.  

“Your mother had tried to find you before her unfortunate demise.” Lunceford continued, “But your Aunt Lydia covered both of your tracks with astonishing proficiency.” 

I shot him a look over the coffee table, “Lydia? My aunt’s name was Heather.” 

Lunceford sighed heavily, shaking his head and smiling with insincere compassion. “Her name was Lydia, Adam, and she took you from your mother when you were a child.” 

“Bullshit.” 

The word was out of my mouth, startling even me with its force. I stood up abruptly, folding my arms across my chest, my fingers digging into my skin. My nervous energy was getting the better of me.  

“If you’re some kind of scammer, you’re shit at it. Look at this dump.” I gestured at the dimly lit space around us. “I got $6’s in spare change and a negative in the bank. Have at it.” 

Mr. Lunceford’s mouth curved in a wide open “oh”, his careful cadence thrown off by my reaction.  

“Now, now Mr. Davidson.” 

“Mills.” I corrected. Growing more frustrated with the conversation. 

“Mr. Mill’s.” Lunceford said carefully, his southern diphthongs stretched as he purred on, “I hate to be the one to explain this to you, but you are a victim of kidnapping.” 

“Bullshit,” I scoffed again, quieter than before.  

“Mr. Mill’s, how difficult has it been for you to secure a job with no social security card? I see that your aunt chose to homeschool you rather than send you to a county school. If I had to guess, you can’t remember the last time you have been to a medical clinic of any kind. I doubt very highly that you have any form of insurance. Would I be correct in saying so?” 

I didn’t respond, anger at his self-assurance waring with surprise at his accuracy.  

“Your mother, Mrs. Ruth Davidson, was my client. She left everything to you son. She loved you very much.”     

My skepticism wouldn’t let me accept it. Not yet.  

“Convenient you are finding me now, just after she has passed.”  

Mr. Lunceford shook his great head again, his jowls shaking. “Oh son, she passed about a year ago. I’ve been searching for you for some time. We have your aunt to thank for this here meeting.” 

“Heather?” I asked, confused.   

“I don’t know what to think of it son. A change in heart? A slip of clarity through her condition? Who can say. All I know son, is by some act of God, she went back home, looking for her sister. After that, it was easy to trace her steps back to you.” 

“Where is she now?” 

“We helped transport her back to her residence. That’s a nice place she’s set up at. Lovely facility.” 

It wasn’t. It was a state-run hovel that reeked of urine and bleach. The staff treated its residents with the tender care of correctional officers to death row prisoners. I had only been there once. It had been enough. 

“Is she alright?” Curiously, I felt a twinge of guilt for not visiting her. As cold as she had been, she was the only family that I had. Now…I didn’t know what to feel. Had I been right to hate her all this time? 

“She’s fine son. Just a little confused as you well know.” He shifted. The sofa creaked. “Mr. Davidson, I have her will here with me. If you don’t mind, I would like to read it to you. Perhaps that will help clear up this fog for you.” 

I wavered, not wanting to give in to whatever act this man was putting on. Still, I needed to know more. And by more, I meant anything. If I had a family out there that had cared about me, I needed to know. It was possible that I had other relatives that had survived her. I could listen to what Mr. Lunceford had to say, then decide whether to believe it or not. 

I sat carefully back down in my chair, eyeing him suspiciously.  

Mr. Lunceford smiled, obviously pleased with my actions. “Don’t worry Mr. Davidson, we’ll bring you back to the fold in no time.”
