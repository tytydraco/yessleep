The sons of Perdition

I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building we found a secret room! And guess what was in it? More books! I even found another journal from someone named Ewan. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.

My name is Ewan and I live in a monastery on the Mississippi river. I have trained under our leader Max since I received a halo. I was 30. It was 1870

We had arrived at the monastery a week ago and had been waiting for the American fleet to reach Antarctica. Today was the day we had to leave to reach the rendezvous point at the same time as them.

That morning I sat beside the water, praying with my mentor Max. Hugo sat with us as well, reading a copy of Moby dick. After being frozen for 142 years Hugo had asked for a reading list once we arrived at the monastery, to help him catch up with what he had missed.

I sat for a moment watching him read. He had 3 glowing gold eyes. The two regular ones scanned over the page while the third one in the middle of his forehead pointed straight south. He said it always pointed to the reincarnation of the white witch.

Hugo noticed me watching him and remarked “The white witch is my white whale, if you know what I mean”

“That story is about obsession, you know. There is a point when you have gone too far seeking revenge.” I chided.

“And you think I’ve gone too far, you spoiled brat? I came back from the dead for a reason you little wimp. Nibiru told me much while I was frozen. If you live 100 years you will never get away from the haunting memory of the monster I have been sent to kill.” Hugo chided.

“Enough you two.” Max remarked angrily. “We are on the same side. Can you not be civil to one another?”

Hugo looked from Max to me and back again. “God I liked you monks better when you weren't so full of yourselves…” he trailed off and then clearly had an idea. “Here take this” he said to me, handing me his damascus steel sword. “Try and cut off my head” He said, challenging me.

I was shocked “You can’t be serious?” I said looking at him.He nodded with a serious look on his face.

I swung the sword in an arch and hit his neck, bouncing off and making my whole body skating with the recoil. I fell backwards as he laughed.

“I’m the first since Achilles to get a forcefield. Can you guess where my heel is?” He said laughing.I sat there stunned and then closed my eyes and looked with my third eye. I could see a torus shape around Hugo, and it converged on his solar plexus.

He smiled with his dragon teeth and said “The monster I will slay is said to be 1 quarter the size of the tarasque.” He squinted at me with his glowing gold eyes.”You’ll learn your place young one.”

“Enough revenant” Alziza’s voice commanded from behind. “Rise above your human treachery and keep your demon’s in check. This day is to be at least one of your final ride’s upon the orcas, must you desecrate such a holy day with such negative energy?”

Just then we noticed the pod of orcas swimming towards the shore. Me, Max and Hugo swam out to the orca pod and before long we were surfing.

For a while we were silent as we surfed. No one was really speaking until Max asked a question of Hugo.

“In your cycle were you the only one who didn’t blaspheme the holy spirit?” Max asked.

“No there was another, master Jacob didn’t either.” Hugo responded.

Grimoire blanc chimed in “I miss master Jacob much though I am glad he did not have to return to this wretched world.”

“What about you? Were you the only one in your cycle that didn’t?” Hugo asked, concerned.

“Yeah I was the only one” Max responded.

“What are you talking about?” I asked confused

“Since our messiah and changeling were both murdered before they could redeem our world, our race has been marked for termination. Isaac Newton was the first in the modern era to rediscover the date. With the prophecy in the book of Enoch stating that the watchers would be imprisoned for 70 lifetimes to await final judgement. He realized that by setting the orbit of Halley's comet as the average lifetime of a human he could calculate the date. He realized the rapture would occur no later than 2060 when he discovered the date of the deluge. Since then prophets of all kinds have debated the specifics. One thing is clear though, any prophet worthy of the name can tell that there is nothing beyond that point.” Max monologued.

Hugo looked at me with concern. “Since our second savior Jesus died every 75 year cycle 15 people get the chance to get exactly what they want from God, or blaspheme the holy spirit. As soon as everyone in a cycle blasphemes the holy spirit, Julius Caesar will reincarnate one last time to try and redeem the world, and when he fails it will be terminated.”

I then heard Yahweh’s voice in my head ‘You were the only one in your cycle who didn’t blaspheme the holy spirit. Just so you know.’

“I guess I was the only one who didn’t in my cycle” I recited, shocked at what I had just heard and said.

“I figured as much!” Hugo laughed. “Going by the dates it should be the one after next that spawns Julius Caesar.”

“Do the prophets know why he fails?” I asked, sad that it was clearly a foregone conclusion.“The problem appears to be the stand-in for the female changeling.” Hugo said with dismay. “The legends say that Cleopatra is his Jesus and that she betrays him. Best anyone can tell, that appears to be what happens.”

Max made a loud gagging noise. “God told me not what she did, only that it was plotted from heaven when Julius Caesar made her the stand-in.”

The rest of our surf we were totally silent, and eventually returned to the shore.

We gathered the monks and all loaded onto Max’s steamboat. We gathered in the boiler room and prayed while Max used the chariot to take us to Antarctica. After our second day of praying in the boiler room we came out onto the deck to see we were on the coastline of Antarctica.

My halo was activated and I looked to the shoreline for signs of our enemy the grand Wizard. I was expecting to see large groups of emperor penguins but I could see nothing alive. I studied the shoeline for a while before hearing a voice in my head.

‘This is our home human. Your kind are not welcome here. Prepare to die!’ it said and I felt something watching me. One of the other monks turned to look behind me and turned to stone.

I turned around and saw 6 land Octopus surfing along the top of the water in a v shape.They moved as fast as a horse could run. All the monks who had not turned to stone turned and fired at them as they approached.

One of them fell beneath the surface and the other five launched from the water and onto the deck of the ship.

Monks were being eaten in one gulp as the land octopi swarmed the deck. The monk’s were firing at will and Hugo charged into the side of one, phasing through it. He cut out the other side as he moved across the deck.

Grimoire Noir’s petrify spell had no effect at all, and grimoire blanc's liquid fire seemed remarkably ineffective against the wet land octopi.

One of them came at me as I unloaded my revolver into its eyes. An eagle holding a shotgun flew towards the front of the ship and suddenly turned into a Caesarean. He unloaded a shell through each of the land Octopus’s eyes and it dropped dead at my feet.

I looked around the deck and saw many monks dying from poison and turned to stone. We had taken massive casualties.

Max walked towards the front of the ship and nodded at the Cesarean. “Ah centurion! What brings you to these parts?”

The caesarean loaded his shotgun and motioned to a dead land octopus. “There is a gathering of land octopus here, the likes of which has not been seen in 2 millennia. I recommend you turn around and go home if you value your lives. We estimate there may be more than a million of them.”

Max recoiled in terror. “You can’t actually be serious?” He said.

“It gets worse, it appears they have opened two giant portals to other worlds. One appears to be a fraud world and the other an abyss world. They are coming from the abyss world in greater numbers than we have ever seen before. It appears to be a full scale invasion too. I would leave these parts and pray for our victory if I were you.” the Cesarean stated.

He then turned back into an eagle and flew away.

We disregarded his warning and met with the other monks and the American fleet at the rendezvous point.

IT was the end of autumn in Antarctica and it was just starting to get really cold. The Americans had sent a scouting party inland to find the grand wizard’s base and had located it not long ago.

We gathered all the American generals with me, Max and Hugo and devised a plan. The American generals wanted to go in full force and just blast the ice palace to bits, while Hugo proposed a very different idea.

“Why don’t I go alone first? I’ll sneak in by myself first and do right for the head of the snake, you guys follow behind, and be ready to start blasting on my signal.” He said confidently. “I want to kill the white witch with my bare hands.”

I then heard Yahweh’s voice in my head. ‘I want you to go with him. Here is the phasing power.’ A blast of holy light hit me and I heard his voice again. ‘There is something I want you to see.’

“I will go with you Hugo” I blurted out.

He gawked at me for a second then chided “Don’t expect me to babysit you kid.”

Me and Hugo headed towards the ice palace under the cover of night with the cavalry following close behind. We were dressed in white cloaks similar to the KKK, to blend in with the snow.

We saw scouts at the top of the tower watching with telescopes but they did not see us approach. We got to the far wall undetected and both phased through the wall.

We appeared in a large room filled with troops gathered around Deb. Deb held a very old looking baby as she sucked the life out of it in front of the troops.

“You just” she said, making weird witchy arm motions, and then took a bite out of the baby. “The texture is similar to that of a peach!” she said hungrily.

“I always knew you were a gross old hag, but that's just unacceptable “ Hugo sneered as he walked forward. He had one of his arms folded over his solar plexus.

All the troops in the room immediately fired at Hugo and he stood there hardly moving from the recoil.The troops stood for a second, dumbfounded that he was alive then went to reload.

Hugo responded to their movements like a lightning bolt as he danced around the room with two Damascus steel swords.

Blood gushed from arteries as he cut all the men down one by one. The last one died as he finished reloading and Hugo turned to Deb.

The third glowing eye on his forehead pointed to Deb as he smiled a dragon toothed grin.“Help! Help! Dora!” She screamed at the top of her lungs.

Hugo walked towards her and plunged his hand into her chest, tearing out her heart. She stood and looked at him as he took a bite of it. “The texture is really more like an apple” he sneered as she fell to the ground dead.

Just then a door flew open and Dora walked through with a number of troops. I noted that she had dragon teeth just like Hugo.

They made eye contact and then Hugo threw one of his swords at her, decapitating her.Her body fell to the ground with the head floating where it was.

“You’ll pay for that!” she said, flying away through the door.

Hugo charged after her, gutting the troops in his way as he chased her out of sight.

I stood alone in the room for a moment before picking up the Damascus steel sword and phasing through the other wall.

I was not prepared for what I saw. I saw a huge slug creature sitting on a throne in the room. I immediately recognized her as Granny Die. She lay there in a room full of manhawks and babies. Some of the babies looked ok, but most were half eaten by larvae and manhawks.

Granny Die looked at me and recollection dawned in her eyes. “Ewan? Have you reincarnated again?” She gulped fermented blood from a bottle.

I shot her through the eye with my revolver and phased through a wall, barely dodging the manhawks retaliatory strike.

In the next room I saw a group of wendigo wasps. They looked at me in the dark and started charging towards me. I ran towards the wasp as it raised its sword fingers towards me and phased through it, pinning myself to the wall behind it.

The wasps parotid human noises of disgust and anger and I phased through the wall and back outside.

I ran from the palace towards where our troops were and heard the wall collapse behind me.The buzzing of wings started and I ran as it got louder coming towards me.

Alziza and the front-line saw me and started firing. Gatling gun fire whizzed around me and I hoped the bullets would find their way to the wasps. I heard loud thuds as their massive bodies fell into the ice. My heart pounded as I raced towards the troops.

I heard the beating of wings back off as I neared Alziza. I turned around and looked at the palace. This all seemed too easy. I had not thought we would be able to kill 2 out of our 3 targets without losing a man. What had happened to the majority of their force?

Just then I saw the grand wizard’s head fly out from a window of the palace, followed closely by Hugo.Another wall of the palace came crashing down and a huge sperm whale infused wendigo wasp, that was about as big as a sperm whale, flew out. It darted through the air and then raked Hugo with hit’s claws, sending him flying. IT flew into the air then right on top of Hugo pinning him down. They wrestled, each trying to get the upper hand. When the wasp took off again, Hugo clung to its side as it flew into the air. The head of the Grand Wizard flew off towards the horizon.

Many men then filed out of the palace, all chanting the same thing. “Kutulu, kutulu, kutulu”

With Hugo out of the palace we started firing upon it. The men just stood there being moved down like grass.

I then noticed a huge shape coming around the side of a small mountain.

The monster was a huge mass of sewn together land octopus. They were in a huge ball, about 50 feet in diameter. Their tentacles were also sewn together, giving them an incredible length. The monster I assumed to be Kutulu then spoke to me in my head ‘Look at my beautiful new body’ and I couldn’t help but stare in terror at the monster.

All the American troops seemed powerless to resist the will of Kutulu and thousands of them turned to stone.

Kutulu roared, and continued to speak to us telepathically ‘You will be a beautiful decoration for me. One to rival the terracotta army.’

I then regained my sense of control and looked around at our troops. The vast majority had been turned to stone. The only ones who remained were those with halos.

Then 6 of Kutulu’s mouths fired energy blasts that converged at a point, holding there for a moment before a 7th blast hit the middle and shot at our group of cannons. I was far away from the blast so I was not evaporated, but was caught in what felt like an avalanche. I rolled through the snow and ended up buried.

I phased to the surface to see another blast hit what was left of our front line. Bit’s of canons and gatling guns fell through the air in smouldering bits.

I looked around helplessly and saw Max standing alone with his possessed bibles. He then started transforming and turned into a 25 foot tall gorilla. Energy focused around his mouth and an energy blast shot right at Kutulu. It hit its side and caused a large explosion. Blood and guts evaporated from the blast.

Kutulu roared and he focused 6 energy blasts then fired with the 7th, blowing old Max to bits. Grimoire Blanc burst into flames, while grimoire Noir appeared to still be intact as he struck the ground.

Alziza and a small group of troops stood looking at Kutulu. I felt a massive presence from the spirit world and looked with my third eye.

In the spirit world thousands of angels circled around Saren, who was inside of Kutulu. One of the angels who had 12 wings flew to Alziza and perched beside him.

“I have brought the entire legion of 10,000 angels who were sent after the watchers with me.” He said “Yahweh knew even then this would occur and we were sent in such numbers to prepare for this day. No Alziza, you have reached level 10, you may take your true form.”

The angel took a sword and knighted Alziza in the spirit world, and then he became an alicorn in the physical world.

Kutulu then focused his energy blasts and fired at Alziza. A gridded fabric appeared in front of him, blocking the blast.

Alziza took flight at an incredible speed as Hugo and the sperm whale infused wasp flew into the side of Kutulu.

The dead wasp knocked Kutulu back for a second and Hugo fell to the ground. Kutulu then gathered his energy and blasted Hugo. He flew through the air and landed far away.

Alziza then perched next to me and said “Get on Ewan, we have work to do”

I climbed on his back and we soared into the air. From high up I could see the battlefield as it really was.

Thousands of Cesareans were gathering around Kutulu, just out of sight. The centurions all started to transform into giant apes like max.

In unison 8 giant apes phased through mountains and all started gathering energy. They all blasted Kutulu at the same time. His tentacles and body started to evaporate before he countered with energy blasts of his own. They cut though the giant apes energy blasts and they started exploding one by one. Three of them managed to phase through his energy blasts and retreated behind mountains.

The Cesareans had some kind of mechanized chariots they were using to pull their advanced cannons and they drove in range of Kutulu in all directions. They started firing quickly as Kutulu blasted them.From Alziza’s back I watched the angels and Saren fighting. Saren was being cut down by rings of angels that attacked in hula hoop circles. Saren looked tired and outmatched. Blood flowed from his open wounds as he gasped, swatting and biting at angels.

Saren appeared to be losing a war of attrition and then I noticed something surrounding a much larger area than the Cesareans. The ice was covered with blue rings and tentacles as the land octopi covered the entire tundra. In the spirit world Djinn held weapons and stood at the land octopus's side.‘This is our world now’ I heard one of them say in my head.

They then began swarming over the Cesareans in the physical world, while the Djinn attacked the angels in the spirit world.

The largest of the land octopus started to focus energy around their mouth that fired in beams at the Cesareans. They turned to face the land octopi and Kutulu was for a second, forgotten.

Energy blasts and exploding shells were exchanged between both sides in an absolute bloodbath.Alziza swerved sideways, almost knocking me off to avoid an energy blast. He darted to and fro as the land octopi fired at us.

When he steadied again I looked down and saw Hugo charging towards Kutulu. A bunch of his long tentacles grabbed Hugo and held him in the air. He then phased through the back tentacles, using the front ones to launch himself at Kutulu. He landed on top of him and started cutting off his tentacles.I looked at the Caesarean giant apes, along with the soldiers, who were firing back at the land octopus, repelling them.

In the spirit world the angels battled with Saren and the Djinn. The Djinn were retreating and Saren cried out in exhaustion and pain.

“You haven’t seen the last of me!” he screamed.

I looked to Kutulu in the physical world to see Hugo sinking through his body, cutting it apart. Kutulu looked like a ball that split right down the middle as Hugo cut and hacked through him.“Got you!” Saren cried as he fled his body.

Hugo lay down without moving at the centre of the mass of sewn together land octopi. A single land octopus tooth protruded from his solar plexus. He panted and his eyes rolled back in his head.Alziza flew down to Hugo and perched on the ground. He looked at Hugo as I dismounted.

“You have a choice to make revenant.” Alziza said to Hugo.

Hugo coughed “What?”

“This world needs a king to prepare it for the return of Julius Caesar and I can find no better option than you. So revenant, what will it be? Will you die now and go to heaven to be a peasant or will you stay in the 9th layer of hell to rule for the remainder of time?” Alziza asked.Hugo gasped, “If you can heal me, alicorn then do it.”

“I’m not done yet, revenant. This is a dangerous gamble I’m offering you here. The leader of the Cesareans is dead and they need a new leader. But as their leader it will be up to you to find the reincarnation of Julius Caesar. And if you fail you will forfeit your ticket to heaven. So I ask again revenant, rule in hell or serve in heaven?”

Hugo gasped “Heal me alicorn.”

Alziza’s horn shone brightly and Hugo was suddenly in perfect condition.He stood up and looked around in obvious shock. He looked at Alziza “How will I know it’s the reincarnation of Julius Caesar?”

The Cesareans gathered around Alziza as he spoke. “This event will be erased from history. When you hear of it again from the mouth of a commoner, you will know him to be Julius Caesar.”“You mean the battle with Kutulu?” Hugo asked.

“No the land Octopus invasion I have been sent here to prevent.” Alziza said. “Metatron put me at full power for a reason. Millions of land octopus have gathered in an abyss world adjacent to ours. They plan to invade this world and eat every living creature within it. And this is but a domino. They have ladder of portals from the abyss all the way up to the first layer of purgatory. The worlds will fall like dominoes to their invasion if we do not stop them here.”

The Cesareans gathered around and one of them spoke “Our force has been all but destroyed, we can not stop the land octopus, we are all doomed!” he sobbed.

“No, I have a plan,” Alziza said. “We will cut off their food supply and close the portals, but first I need you to swear that when we do you will induct both of these men. The green one is to be your new leader, and I assure you he is the monster you need.”

Alziza made them swear an oath to secrecy, and induction and then turned to me and Hugo.“Get on” he said Hugo jumped on his back and so did I. Then we took off with extreme speed.WE flew above Antarctica, looking down on the swarms of land octopus. We flew high enough that they seemed uninterested in firing upon us. After a while we saw the portals.

Two massive portals stood side by side. One led to a world that looked much like ours, to another Antarctica. But the second portal’s Antarctica was different. The snow was blood red as well as the sky. That must be the abyss world I thought.

As we neared we increased in speed and Hugo used one strong arm to hold me in place as we soared faster and faster toward the portal. All of sudden everything went silent. I couldn’t see what was going on because the wind was blowing so hard. I couldn’t hold on and all that kept me from flying off was Hugo.

I felt us go faster and faster until the wind burned my skin.I thought I might just combust as we slowed down to a more manageable speed.

I looked around to see that we had traveled through the portal to the abyss world. The blood red skies and ocean made me want to cry. What an awful place I thought to myself. We flew over the ocean towards a huge tree on the horizon.

As we got closer I saw innumerable land octopi all swarmed around the tree. There appeared to be a giant woman crucified upon the tree. She was naked and from her birthed countless little beelzebubs. The land Octopus had formed a circle around where the babies were falling. They gulped them up as soon as they hit the ground in a constant feeding frenzy.

“Lilith” Alziza remarked with disgust.

I looked at her for a moment before something brought my attention to the spirit world. Samael flew beside us and screamed borderline incoherent threats.

“You touch my wife and I’ll kill you for many lifetimes! I’ll make you wish you never stepped foot in my wife’s world you vandals!” He screamed as he threw a tantrum.

He then flew to the Djinn, alerting them of our presence. The land octopi looked at us and began firing energy blasts.

Alziza put up a gridded fabric for a shield and we approached at extreme speed. I heard the energy blasts pelt the shield as we approached.

When we were in range Hugo leapt off of Alziza onto the giant woman's head. With two damascus steel swords he cut off her arms and her huge body fell into the mouths of the hungry land octopi. They were so ravenous they ate her without even realising that it was the source of their food.Alziza darted down and Hugo lept back onto his back away from the mouths of the land octopi.Alziza started speeding up and we were out of there without taking a single hit. Samael flew beside us screaming increasingly incoherent threats.

Hugo grabbed me and we sped up until everything went silent again. Then faster and faster until my skin burned. I couldn’t see where we were going until me and Hugo flew off of Alziza’s back. We flew into the air, higher and higher until we crested and I looked down.

It looked like we were back in our world. We must have gone back through the portal. Alziza flew by from above us and shot back towards where the portals must have been.

I heard his voice in my head. ‘I need to merge the portals together to destroy them, and to do that I will have to be in range of the blast. Goodbye Ewan.’

‘Are you going to die?’ I thought.

‘No, like Saren I will only be disembodied. This is why I was put here. The land octopi must never be allowed to invade a purgatory world. Enjoy your life for it will be a full one.’ Alziza responded.

And with that a huge rainbow explosion appeared on Antarctica. It looked like 500 million tons of gunpowder going off at once. The explosion ebbed and flowed as it got bigger and bigger. Shockwaves traced through the air towards us and we held in the air for minutes but the shockwaves.Once the blast subsided Hugo grabbed me and we fell like feathers towards the ice.

We fell far away from where the explosion was and unfortunately were surrounded by land octopi when we hit the ground.

An absolutely huge one came out from the group and looked at us. Its eyes were bigger than wagon wheels and its teeth bigger than halberds.

I heard it’s voice in my head ‘I am the kracken. I was born before before the fall of man.’ I felt him searching my mind ‘Ah, the bronze age collapse, is that what you call it now?’ It said telepathically.“Kutulu was bigger than you are’ I jested.

‘Oh you think you are tough? We just lost most of our invasion force as you know, and won’t be able to take this world by force with our current numbers. And I would like for you two to take my deal to the Cesareans. But if you can’t treat me with the proper respect I will leave nothing in your mind but what I want you to say’ it growled angrily.

I felt my mind race and then jam up. I lost all thought and curled over in mental anguish.Hugo looked at me “Don’t antagonize it!” he yelped.

‘I’m sorry lord of the land octopus’ I thought over and over.

It stopped but my mind felt shredded. Like I had just gotten dumber.

They led us back to the edge of their swarm and we walked back to where the ice palace had been. Grimoire Noir was there with a petrified Dora head. A perfect souvenir!  A few Caesareans with mechanized chariots waited for us as well. They called them jeeps. We explained that the land ocopus were offering us a peace treaty. They wanted to coexist peacefully with humans. then we got in the jeeps.  As we drove towards shore they asked us their induction questions.

“What is the code-word?” The caesarean in the passenger seat asked us.“Ouroboros.” we said in unison.

We both got all 3 questions right with a little help from Yahweh and they gave us each 3 gold talons as our introductory bonus.

The caesarean looked at me and said “These machines are the future kid, If I were you I would take all that money and buy oil with it.”

Me and Hugo returned to the monastery one last time. To write an account of what happened. We made a secret compartment in the monastery where this journal will lie until after my death, or so Yahweh has said. When I was inducted into the Cesareans I changed my identity so that no one would come after me for my money. I, David Rockefeller, leave this journal so that future generations may know what happened in Antarctica in 1870.
