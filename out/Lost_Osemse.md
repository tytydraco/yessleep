In 2000, on the 12th of February, a nuclear reactor failure demolished the town of Osemse. Practically erased, with only the rock and rubble that remains. It has been 30 years since that accident, with the technology to safely enter the irradiated area, we have decided to go in, and try to find any evidence of what happened to the people there, and what caused the catastrophe.



And so, the excavation began, after 4 months of this incredibly tedious process, all we had done was shift debris. Since the town of Osemse was deep in rural Mississippi, there was little mapping, and what little mapping he had conflicted with each other, so it was difficult to find the exact spot where the powerplant used to lay. However, eventually, we found something deeply bizarre under all the rubble. A floppy disk, perfectly preserved and undamaged, buried in a 1 foot steel cube under 3.5 feet of collapsed cement and concrete. 13 logs of the daily events leading up to the destruction of the entire town.



1/31/00

The doors are sealed. At 10:00 AM today, the doors out of the facility were suddenly sealed shut and the windows were consumed by complete darkness. We have tried prying, breaking, a few even pounded at the doors with their fists until their hands were raw and bloodied, we even tried melting the doors and windows open with blowtorches, but nothing has worked. 70 scientists and engineers along with 35 other staff members (Janitorial, maintenance, mechanical, ect.) The doors were not the strangest part.



The plumbing is no longer functioning, instead of water flowing out of it, it is human blood. Already deeply concerning, but in addition, the faucets have not stopped spurting out blood since we turned them on despite our best efforts, and the blood is too thick to ooze through the drain faster than it comes out of the faucet. This means 6 of the 10 bathrooms in the building are flooding with human blood. We relied on the water coolers periodically placed around the power plant and the water bottles some people brought from home for the rest of the day. The doors and windows never opened, so we had to stay overnight. A majority of the workers panicked, being scientists means they try to rely on rational thinking but nothing about these events could be rationalized. 12 of our scientists refused to believe that this wasn't a dream they were having, so they spent the rest of the day trying to wake themselves up until they eventually tired themselves out and went to sleep. One person completely froze up upon seeing blood come out of the sink, they just stood there frozen up for about 7 minutes after the blood began spewing. A few passing people eventually saw the puddle of blood forming under the door, and retrieved them from the bathroom. Overall, most of us are trying to remain calm and level-headed in these deeply strange times. I will record tomorrowâ€™s events soon.
