There are times when I have this weird feeling that there's someone or something in the room other than myself. 

Not just that, but I would occassionally smell perfume, burning tires, and stale odor that comes out of thin air. 

Like the other day, I was having coffee and texting my hubby about the grocery list, I suddenly caught hold of an old lady's perfume waft in my face. 

Like Miko in Mieruko-Chan, I kept a poker face and told my husband about it on viber. The smell didn't last very long. It was about 2 mns. Then it was gone. I was so creeped out I tried playing music until my husband returned home. And this happened at day time!!

Later my husband told me that it could have been an old lady passing by our apartment, out on the street since our window was slightly open. 

Bear in mind: I live on the second floor and I wasn't even standing infront of the open window. I was sitting 3 steps away with my back to it, hunched over my coffee cup at our breakfast table. I simply can't see his reasoning as a possibility 

So hell, yeah I was creeped out. About 8 years ago I googled wondering if Phantom Smell could be a sign of a hidden health issue. Like some chemical I unknowingly ingest that could trigger memory to seem like am smelling odor that aren't there. The symptoms didn't apply to me, though . . .

Strangely enough, it doesn't happen all the time. I experience Phantom Smell 1~2x every 5 to 6 years. It varies. So I am wondering if it's something else. If maybe I do have the ability to sense presence of the spirits cause there are other signs as well like some invisible force that shouldn't be there.

Or when I occassionally dream of these glowing, floating spirits that makes me feel so much love and warmth, I don't want to wake up. I saw one of them again last August 2022 and I tried to reach out, but the gateway(?) shut and pulled me back. I woke up on my bed, in the dark at around 2~3 am and my family were still peacefully sleeping next to me.

I have an inkling that time works differently in the Dream/Spirit World.

Why do I experience these things? It creeps me out and at times I have trouble sleeping. These days I take vitamin D to help me sleep and limit my coffee intake and it still happens!!

Could I posses abilities of a "medium"? If so, I would like to delve deeper but I have a family and I can't risk attracting bad energy or spirits that could affect them. Is there a guarantee safe way to explore the spirit realm? 

My husband has been begging me not to do anything risky at the moment. Still, when you experience them, and you don't know how, or why? You can't help but seek people in the know. A skilled mentor would be nice.
