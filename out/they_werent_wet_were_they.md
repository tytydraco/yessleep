My name’s Walt Kelly, and I been sittin’ on this story ‘bout a remote lighthouse off the Oregon coast for nigh on thirty-five years now. Figgered it’s time to let it loose, like a bad smell at a Sunday picnic, probly.

The lighthouse. The Widow's Tooth, some of the old-timers called it. And she’d earned it, they said. More storms rolled over that rock than you’ve had hot dinners. Old timers used to say the place was cursed, that the souls of shipwrecked sailors was trapped in the lantern room, forever watchin’ for a shore they could never reach. Just stories, mostly. Keeps the tourists interested though.

Worked that light for twelve years, I did. Seen every kind of weather the Pacific could throw, every kind of boat that dared to come close. You learn to read the water out there, know the sound of a trawler from a sailboat a mile off. Seen things you wouldn’t believe, mostly just the ocean bein’ the ocean, mind you. But this… this was different.

It was a night just like any other in late fall. The kind where the wind howled like a banshee lost in a barrel, and the waves crashed high enough to spit water right up onto the lantern room. Couldn’t see nothin’ but white fury out there. Radar was spittin’ and cracklin’, pickin’ up nothin’ but the storm itself, and I figgered that was that. You get used to the loneliness out there, the constant roar of the sea your only company. You settle into a rhythm, checkin’ the lamp, the gauges, makin’ sure Widow's Tooth was doin’ her job, warnin’ folks away from the teeth of that rock.

Then, clear as a bell over the roar, I heard it. A knock. Not a bang from the wind, nothin’ like that. A proper knock. Like someone standin’ there, polite as you please, in the middle of Armageddon.

Figgered it was the wind playin’ tricks, but then it came again. Three sharp raps. No boat coulda made it close that night without me seein’ it, hearin’ it. And even if they did… they’d be clingin’ to life, not standin’ there knockin’ like they was expectin’ tea and biscuits.

I went down the windin’ stairs, heart thumpin’ a little faster than usual. Bolted the heavy door open, and there they was. A fella, his wife, and two young’uns, huddled together. Seemed normal enough at first glance. Except… they was dry. Bone dry. Like they’d just stepped out of their parlor on a sunny afternoon. Their clothes, looked like wool, but felt… papery, almost. Rain usually soaks things. And their hair, the rain shoulda plastered it to their heads, but it was dry, like it hadn't even been near water.

“Lost, are you?” I asked, the wind tryin’ to rip the words from my mouth.

The fella, he had a thin mustache and a nervous look, just nodded. “Storm caught us out,” he said, his voice barely a whisper against the wind. The wife, she had her arm around a little girl, maybe six or seven, and the boy, a couple years older, was holdin’ onto his daddy’s coat.

“No boat,” I said, lookin’ past ‘em into the storm. “Ain’t seen no boats all night.”

The fella just shrugged, a weak little shrug that didn’t explain nothin’. I wasn’t born yesterday. You don’t just appear on a rock in the middle of the ocean during a gale.

“Come on in,” I said, more out of habit than anything. Couldn’t leave folks out in that.

They stepped inside, and the wind seemed to sigh now that the door was shut. They dripped nothin’ on the floor. Not a single drop. I’d just mopped the floor that afternoon, the linoleum still a bit slick. They stepped inside, and nothin'. Not a bead of water. I remember thinkin' I needed to check the desiccant in the lamp housing later, keep the moisture out. But that dryness… it wasn't right.

“Coffee?” I offered, pointin’ to the pot always brewin’ on the stove. Strong enough to float a damn horseshoe.

They nodded, still quiet. The young’uns, a boy and a girl, they didn’t say nothin’, just stood there, clingin’ to their mama’s skirts.

It was the way they looked at you though. The wife, she’d smile, a real polite smile, but her eyes… her eyes would drift off, lookin’ past you, like she was seein’ somethin’ on the wall behind you that wasn’t there. The fella, he mostly kept his head down, but every now and then, he’d glance up, a quick, dartin’ look, then back down again. Like he was expectin’ somethin’ to jump out.

And then there was the peekin’. The little girl, she’d stand in a doorway, just out of sight, just her eyes peekin’ around the jamb, starin’ at you with that same fixed smile. Or the husband, he’d be sittin’ by the fire, but you’d catch him lookin’ over his shoulder, starin’ at the shadows in the corner. The firelight dancin’ on the walls, makin’ shapes.

They didn’t act like they’d just escaped a watery grave. No shiverin’, no cryin’, nothin’. Just… there. And they stayed dry. Even sittin’ by the fire, their clothes didn’t steam, didn’t even look damp. It was unnatural.

Started with a glance here and there, easy enough to miss. But then it got… coordinated. Like they'd rehearsed it. I'd be jawin' with the fella about the wind, tryin' to act normal, and then, all at once, the wife and kids, they'd all turn. Every one of 'em, eyes locked on you for a heartbeat. Then, just as sudden, they'd snap away, lookin' at the floor or the wall, like nothin' happened. Creeped me right out. Like I'd missed somethin', like they knew somethin' I didn't. Made the hairs on my neck prickle, I tell you what.

Once, I went up to check the lamp, hearin' the beam whir and swing out over the black water. When I came back down, they was all just… standin' there, smack-dab in the middle of the room, heads tilted back, gazin' up at the ceilin'. Just starin'. Ceilin's just a ceilin', ain't nothin' special about it. But they was lookin' like they seen somethin' I couldn't. Cleared my throat, and their heads snapped down quick, like they was pulled by a string. Smilin'. That same damn smile that didn't reach their eyes. Like nothin' was amiss.

My mind was tryin’ to make sense of it, tellin’ me I was just tired, seein’ things. But that feelin’… that cold knot in your gut… that don’t lie. I’d seen things out on the water, things you can’t explain, but this was different. This felt… wrong.

It hit me when I saw the little girl walk right through a puddle of seawater on the floor by the door. Didn’t even ripple the water. That’s when the cold really set in. That’s when I knew somethin’ wasn’t right, somethin’ was deeply, terribly wrong.

I’d been watchin’ the wife help the little boy with his coat. Just a normal thing, a mother and her son. But the way she smiled down at him… it was too wide, too fixed. And his eyes… they was lookin’ past her, lookin’ right through her. And somethin’ just clicked. That wasn’t her. And them weren’t her children. Not anymore, anyway.

Come mornin', the wind was done howlin', the sea was almost... polite. Sun shinin' like butter wouldn't melt. They were gone. Just... gone. I stood there, feelin' the silence pressin' in. My gaze kept driftin' back to the door. Solid. And the bolt. That thick brass bolt, still in place. I know that bolt. Know it like I know my own hands. You gotta be here, on this side, to slide it across. Feel the click as it locks. There's no reachin' it from out there. No way. So how...? No wet tracks. Nothin' disturbed. Just the memory of their faces... and that damn bolt.

Never saw ‘em again. Never heard nothin’ ‘bout a missin’ family. The sea keeps its secrets, and sometimes, it spits things back that ain’t what they used to be.

So, if you’re ever caught out in a storm, and someone comes to your door lookin’ for shelter… look real close. Especially if they’re dry as a bone when they shouldn’t be. And if they start starin’ at the corners of the room, smilin’ that empty smile… bolt the door. Let the storm rage. Because sometimes, the sea ain’t the only thing that washes ashore. It brings other things too. Things you don't want to see. Things that ain't natural.
