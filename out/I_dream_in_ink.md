I had a dream the other night that something slid out from underneath me. A pair of hands darker than night, scaring away the cats as they crawled, using my leftover blankets as rope and dragging their long long arms behind. They perched right on my side like two birds, each hand took a turn pulling at the other’s arm, tugging its oily limbs out like ribbons from a magician's mouth. Miles of arms sat coiled on top of each other and they kept pulling and pulling and pulling. Getting more impatient as the piles swallowed up my bedroom floor in perpetual darkness. Their efforts were not in vain, as head rolled out attached to hunched shoulders and buried face first in miles of itself. It just laid there, its hair slicked to its scalp in the same ever-shifting ink it was bathed in, then the hands descended, one snagging its head by the wispy hairs on the back of its neck. The other held its companion by its rope-like limbs, pulling once again, hoisting it up my blankets and passing the hard metal edge of my bed frame until it was nestled in my sheets. 

The shoulders didn’t follow, instead it’s neck stretched out and over the edge of my bed. The left hand climbed over it to join it’s opposite, then together they started to roll their head, around and around, turning its long tube-like neck into a wringed towel. They rolled until their head was on the pillow, staining the pink silk in its ink, its nose nestled in my tangle of curls. It smiled, I heard the seal of it’s wet lips break when it did. More of it consumed my bed as it’s hands kept working, pulling more of itself out, whatever it was, it filled my room like water. It’s long long chest against my back, the start of it’s legs tangled around mine, and it’s groin against my ankles.  I could no longer see my nightstand or the cat-tree, just endless inky loops, some larger than the others but all indecipherable. It wrapped it’s arms around me three or four times and it pulled me into it’s chest, trapping me in its sticky and warm grip. 

“Look at me.” It begged, its voice slithered its way into my ear like a tongue. “I know you’re awake.” 

With a bend of one of it’s long long limbs, it smeared itself against my cheek as it turned my head for me. I saw nothing, only a shape. It’s face, featureless but it shifted constantly in lumps as if a hidden force was playing with clay, then with a wet smack,  it smiled again and I saw teeth. A child’s crude drawing of a leech: Canines, molars and the roots all yellowed, all jutting out of clay-like flesh where its cheeks, forehead and chin would be.

“I missed you.” It whispered but nothing moved, the voice came from within it. 

“Do I know you?” 

Another cord of whatever limb it was came from the sea of darkness, rising above itself like a snake. It slithered around and around, wrapping itself tight around my legs. It laughed when I tried to struggle and the sound shook its entire body, the room, and me along with it.  No longer could I see the popcorn on my ceiling or feel the warmth of my bed. Only wet inky blackness.
