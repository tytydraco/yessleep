Camping trips were never a thing in my family. We used to live further west, where the landscape was flat and the horizon seemed to stretch on forever. The locals called the gentle, rolling hills "mountains" to make themselves feel better about it, but they were nothing compared to the majestic peaks surrounding us here. I grew up with a view of wide-open plains rather than rugged terrain. Back then, the closest thing to a hike was a walk through the local park, where the trees were neatly lined up and the paths were paved. The idea of spending a night in the woods, surrounded by nothing but nature and darkness, was as foreign to me as the mountains themselves.

My mom had always wanted more for us, though. She wasn’t content with the flat, endless plains or the small-town life we had back west. She dreamed of something bigger, something better, even if she never quite knew what that was. When she found a new job in this town, she saw it as our chance to start over, to build a life that was more than just getting by. I was heading to college anyway, so the timing worked out. We packed up our lives and moved east, trading the open skies for the shadow of mountains.

But even with the change of scenery, I never really felt like I belonged here. The mountains were beautiful, sure, but they were also imposing, almost suffocating at times. They stood like silent guardians around the town, their presence always there, always reminding me that I was somewhere different, somewhere far from the familiar flatlands of my childhood. I told myself I’d leave as soon as I graduated, maybe head back west where the land was flat and the skies were wide open, or even try my luck in a bigger city where no one knew my name. Yet here I am, still stuck, watching the mountains that were supposed to be temporary become more permanent than I’d ever intended.

The friends I had made in college were different. There was Trevor, who grew up in a small town not far from here. He was the kind of guy who felt at home in nature, who didn’t think twice about spending a weekend camping in the wilderness or going on a hike that lasted all day. Trevor had stories of hunting trips with his dad, of fishing in icy streams where the water was so cold it made your bones ache, and of camping in the kind of dense, untamed forests I’d only seen in movies. He was always the one pushing for adventure, itching to get back to the wilderness whenever he could.

Then there was Colin, who had a more cautious approach to the outdoors. He’d grown up in a similar setting but had a bit more respect for the dangers that came with it. He was a planner, someone who liked to have everything mapped out before taking a step, which often put him at odds with Trevor’s more spontaneous nature. Colin’s girlfriend, Fay, was part of our group too. She shared Colin’s love for the outdoors, though with a more carefree attitude. Fay was always ready to go with the flow, making her the peacekeeper whenever tensions ran high.

Finally, there was Markus. He was quieter, more introspective than the others. Markus wasn’t exactly a wilderness expert, but he had a deep appreciation for nature. His interests leaned more towards photography and documenting our adventures, always capturing the perfect moment or finding beauty in the smallest details. He and I often found ourselves on the same wavelength.

So when Trevor suggested a camping trip to get out of the city, I hesitated at first. I wasn’t sure if I was up for it—if I could handle roughing it in the woods like they could. But then again, why not? It sounded like fun, and I really needed a break. The city had been draining me, and the monotony of work had started to wear on my nerves. I figured a little peace, some fresh air, and a bit of relaxation might be just what I needed to clear my head and maybe help me figure out what I was doing with my life.

Trevor took charge of the trip, borrowing his uncle’s SUV. He mentioned how his uncle didn’t use it much anymore because of his knee problems, and it was a shame to let it just sit in the garage. The SUV was perfect for the rough mountain roads we’d be tackling, and it had plenty of space for all our gear. His uncle seemed like a cool guy—an outdoorsman who had spent his life in these mountains. As we packed the SUV, he gave us some tips about beautiful spots and routes we should check out, places that weren’t on any map but were worth the trek.

I think we all had our own ideas of what we wanted from this trip. Trevor was clearly looking for adventure, Colin and Fay were eager to reconnect with nature, and Markus was excited to document everything with his camera. As for me, I just wanted to disconnect for a while, to find some clarity in the silence of the woods or the stillness of a mountain lake. As we loaded up the SUV, I realized that none of us were really paying attention to the man’s advice. We were too caught up in the excitement of the trip, in the anticipation of escaping our everyday lives. But as I finished packing my stuff, Trevor’s uncle gave me a serious look. There was something in his eyes that made me pause.

He handed me a flyer with emergency numbers, walkie-talkie frequencies, and other safety information. “My nephew doesn’t always take this stuff seriously, but you look like someone who might,” he said. His voice had a weight to it, like he’d seen things out there that we couldn’t imagine. “Umm, thanks,” I muttered, not really sure why he singled me out. Maybe it was because I was the quiet one, the one who hadn’t grown up in these woods, and he figured I’d be the most cautious.

We drove for two hours before we reached the mountains. The road wound higher and higher, the trees closing in around us as we left the city far behind. The mountains gradually opened up into a gentle valley, a landscape that was both breathtaking and intimidating. It was a long drive for something that had seemed so close from my office window, and as we climbed, I felt the distance between my old life and this new experience growing wider with every mile.

The others laughed and shared stories from their childhoods, reminiscing about camping trips with their families. I realized then that while they had these fond memories to draw from, I had nothing similar. None of them had done this regularly in recent years, but it was clear they had a deep connection to the outdoors. I, on the other hand, was stepping into unfamiliar territory. I sat quietly in the backseat, lost in my thoughts, flipping through the brochures Trevor’s uncle had given me. The one titled “Search and Rescue in the Woods” caught my eye, and I couldn’t help but feel a slight unease. “How reassuring,” I thought to myself with a wry smile, trying to push aside the nervousness that was starting to creep in.

So here we are—a handful of recent graduates with our backpacks stuffed to the brim, brochures from the campground owner tucked into our pockets, survival gear, food, water, and tools packed neatly away. A little adventure. I couldn’t help but feel a bit silly for romanticizing the whole thing, but what do you expect from someone who hasn’t seen nature like this in what feels like forever? Here, where the landscape isn’t carved up by roads, where you don’t stumble upon a Starbucks every few blocks. But as we ventured deeper, my mood began to lift. I found myself catching onto the excitement radiating from the others, their laughter and lighthearted banter infectious. We had arrived later than planned, so we decided to spend the night at the campground before setting off on our hike the next day.

Waking up that morning felt invigorating. The air was so clear, so crisp. I hadn’t realized how much the city’s smells had weighed on me—the ever-present scent of fast food joints, the greasy fumes that lingered in the air. But here, the air was different. It was refreshing, untainted, like a deep breath after holding it in for too long. It’s the small things, the tiny shifts in perception, that really shape an experience. When we strip away the constant sensory input that defines our daily lives, only then do we truly notice them—like the carefree days of childhood that seemed so ordinary until they were gone. We quickly ate breakfast, packed up our gear, and left the car behind as we began our hike toward the cabin.

As the day turned to dusk and the light softened, we found ourselves deep in the forest, miles away from the nearest town. The sounds of the forest were so different from the city’s constant hum or the plains’ quiet emptiness. Here, the forest was a lively chorus of rustling leaves, chirping insects, hooting owls, and distant calls of animals settling in for the night. I kept glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to catch a glimpse of a deer or some other animal peeking out from the trees.

We arrived soon at the cabin. It stood there, nestled among the trees like a cozy retreat. The cabin was charming, clearly well-used by travelers in the area—a small, rustic refuge in the midst of the vast wilderness, promising warmth and shelter. We settled in, dropping our packs with a sense of relief as we took in our surroundings.

As night deepened, we set up a campfire outside, a small circle of warmth that beckoned us closer. The flames crackled softly, casting gentle, dancing shadows on the trees around us. The darkness was deep, yet comforting, with only the flickering light of our campfire to keep the night at bay. We sat around the fire, our faces lit by its orange glow, sharing stories and laughing about our day. There was a lightness in the air, a sense of camaraderie that only comes from spending time with good friends in such a serene setting. Trevor, ever the adventurer, regaled us with tales of his childhood camping trips, complete with exaggerated bear encounters that had us all in stitches. Colin and Fay playfully teased each other, their banter a constant source of amusement. Markus, ever the observer, snapped pictures of the firelight reflecting off our faces, capturing the warmth of the moment.

I found myself relaxing, the worries of the city fading into the background. The fire burned brightly, the embers glowing as we roasted marshmallows and swapped jokes. The conversation flowed easily, the laughter growing louder as the night wore on. It felt good to be part of something so simple and pure—just friends enjoying a night under the stars, away from the pressures of everyday life.

As the fire burned down to glowing coals, the conversation naturally slowed to a gentle murmur. The stars above us sparkled like diamonds against the inky sky, and the cool night air was filled with the sounds of the forest—a symphony of nature that lulled us into a peaceful silence. The cabin, the forest, the mountains—they were all part of a world that was beautiful, alive, and brimming with possibilities. For the first time in a long while, I felt a sense of contentment, a deep appreciation for the moment we were all sharing.

Finally, with a sense of reluctance, we doused the fire and made our way to the cabin. The night had been perfect, the kind of night that stays with you long after it’s over. As I crawled into my sleeping bag, I felt a sense of calm wash over me, a quiet reassurance that I was exactly where I needed to be. The cabin, the forest, the mountains—they were no longer just a backdrop to my life; they had become a part of me, a part of who I was becoming.

The next morning welcomed us with a brilliant sky, its deep blue expanse stretching over the valley, casting a warm, golden light across the landscape. As we stepped out of the cabin, the view took my breath away—the valley unfurled beneath us like a vast, untouched canvas, the morning mist slowly retreating to reveal the vibrant greens and earthy browns of the forest below. The air was crisp and invigorating, a sharp contrast to the stale, polluted city air I’d grown so accustomed to. It was the kind of morning that made you feel alive, like anything was possible.

Inside the cabin, we found a few more brochures lying around, probably left by park rangers or previous visitors. They were the usual fare—maps, safety guidelines, a few advertisements for local attractions. As I flipped through them, my eyes were drawn to the fridge, where a child’s drawing was held up by a couple of magnets. It was a simple, crayon-drawn picture—a bit messy, as if done in a hurry, but with a certain earnestness that only a child could capture. It showed a family—father, mother, and a little girl, all holding hands in front of what looked like a forest. At first glance, it was just another innocent piece of art, the kind you’d see on any family’s fridge. But something about the picture bothered me, a nagging sense of unease that I couldn’t quite place.

It wasn’t until I looked closer that I realized what it was. The faces of the family—each one drawn with a sad expression, their mouths turned down in frowns. The kind of exaggerated sadness that only a child could draw, where the emotions are so raw and unfiltered. And then there was the figure in the background—standing in the bushes, drawn in heavy black crayon. A man, or at least the outline of one, looming behind the family. But unlike the others, he had no face at all—just a blank, featureless void where his features should have been. The sight of it sent a shiver down my spine. I tried to brush it off with a weak joke in my head—“Well, better no face than a sad one, I guess.” But the image lingered, gnawing at the edges of my mind, long after I looked away.

We packed up our gear and left the cabin, eager to venture deeper into the valley. The trails were well-marked, winding their way through the dense forest, leading us further from civilization with every step. It felt like we were stepping into another world, one untouched by the march of time. As we walked, we encountered a park ranger coming the opposite way. He was an older man, with weathered skin and a worn uniform that suggested he’d been doing this for a long time. He stopped us with a raised hand and offered a friendly, yet firm warning: “The animals have been acting strange lately,” he said. “Best to stick to the designated paths and follow the rules. As long as you do that, you won’t have anything to worry about.”

His words were meant to be reassuring, I suppose, but they left a strange, uneasy feeling in their wake. Was that supposed to be a joke? I didn’t know what to make of it, and his stern expression didn’t offer any clues. I get that it’s his job to look out for hikers and campers, and I understand the need to tell people to stay on the trails. But the way he said it, and the way he just left it hanging in the air—it was unsettling, to say the least. For the next hour or so, I found myself brooding over the encounter, my mood darkened by the ranger’s cryptic warning. But as the day wore on, the beauty of the landscape began to work its magic, lifting my spirits in spite of myself. The air was fresh, the scenery stunning, and I was surprised at how well I was handling the hike. Maybe it was worth investing in those new hiking boots after all.

It took us longer than expected to reach our intended rest stop, and by the time we arrived, something felt off. The sign at the rest area didn’t match the name on the map. “Candle Crest?” That wasn’t on the map at all. I pointed it out to the others, but they just shrugged it off. We were tired, and the spot looked good enough to set up camp, so we decided to stay there anyway. Whether it was the right spot or not, the trip had been going well so far, and I was finally starting to feel like I could disconnect from the grind of daily life. It was as if we had stepped into a different world, one far removed from the reality I had left behind. I sat down for a moment to jot down some thoughts, trying to clear my mind and sort through the clutter that had been building up over the past months..

This morning started off a bit rougher than the others. I struggled to keep up with the group as I packed up my tent, my hands clumsy and sluggish. There was a lingering heaviness in my head, as if I had just woken from a long, confusing dream. I could only remember fragments—a pale, distant moon hanging low in the sky, and the sensation of walking endlessly beneath a dark, oppressive canopy. The dream had left me with an odd sense of unease, a feeling that clung to me even as I shook off the last remnants of sleep.

After a quick breakfast, we set off once again. As we descended deeper into the valley, the temperature dropped noticeably. The air grew cooler, and the once-dense forest began to thin out, giving way to small hills and rocky outcrops. The mountains that had been our distant companions now loomed around us like towering sentinels, their jagged peaks obscured by the gathering mist. It felt as though we had stumbled into another world—a hidden valley, forgotten by time and untouched by the outside world. The silence was almost overwhelming, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves or the distant call of a bird. Even those sounds seemed muted, swallowed up by the thick, heavy air.

I tried to make sense of our surroundings, but nothing seemed to align with the map anymore. The further we went, the more disoriented I became. The landmarks we had been following gradually disappeared, replaced by unfamiliar terrain. When I checked the compass and tried to retrace our steps, I realized with a growing sense of unease that we should have reached our designated campsite by now. It should have been right here, in this very spot. But there was nothing—no sign, no clearing, just the same endless expanse of trees and rocks. Had we turned too early? Or too late? I voiced my concerns to the others, but they simply shrugged it off, more focused on setting up camp than on my growing anxiety. They were content to pitch their tents here, at the edge of the trees. It was quiet. Too quiet.

The silence pressed in on us as we began to set up camp, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The process took longer than expected—every task felt just a bit more difficult, as if the air itself was resisting our efforts. We weren’t used to setting everything up from scratch without the conveniences of a prepared campsite, but we managed, albeit with a sense of unease gnawing at the edges of our minds. By the time we finished, the sun had dipped below the horizon, leaving us in the deepening twilight.

As the last light of day faded, long shadows crept across the ground, and the cold began to seep in, chilling me to the bone despite the layers of clothing I wore. The others were clearly tired, their earlier excitement replaced by exhaustion. Conversation dwindled to a few murmured words, the quiet punctuated only by the crackling of the small fire we had managed to start. The flames flickered weakly, casting eerie shapes on the surrounding trees, which now loomed over us like silent, watchful giants.

The deeper darkness that settled in was unlike any I had ever experienced. It wasn’t just the absence of light—it was a palpable, almost oppressive presence that seemed to close in around us, pressing against our skin and filling our lungs with a cold, damp weight. Every now and then, a twig snapped in the distance, or the wind whispered through the branches, and I found myself tensing, half expecting something to emerge from the shadows.

But nothing came. Just that heavy, unsettling silence. As I crawled into my tent that night, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we weren’t alone. That something out there in the dark was watching us, waiting. The thought clung to me, tightening my chest with every breath I took. I lay there, staring up at the fabric of the tent, every sound outside magnified by my racing thoughts. The rustling of leaves, the creaking of branches, even the soft breathing of my friends nearby—it all seemed to merge into a single, sinister rhythm. And as I lay there, half-awake, I couldn’t help but wonder if we had wandered too far—if we had crossed some unseen boundary and found ourselves in a place where we didn’t belong.

—

The morning after we set up camp here, something unexpected happened—one of the tents was gone. Stella was gone. Her tent, her belongings, everything had vanished without a trace. I have to admit, I can’t even recall exactly where her tent had been when we set up camp the previous evening. I was too wrapped up in my own thoughts, distracted by situationt and trying to suppress the nagging discomfort that had been gnawing at me.

Trevor, immediately took charge. He tried to keep everyone calm, suggesting that Stella must have had a reason to leave the group. His voice was steady, but I could tell from the way he was biting the inside of his cheek that he was struggling to convince himself as much as the rest of us. Trevor had always been the one to lighten the mood with a joke or a reassuring word, but now, his usual confidence seemed forced, like he was trying too hard to be the leader we needed.

Colin and Fay, who were closest to Stella and had known her the longest, were visibly shaken. They were the ones most affected by her disappearance, their worry teetering on the edge of panic. Colin’s voice, usually calm and measured, grew sharper as he began questioning Trevor, frustration bubbling up in his tone. Fay, usually the peacekeeper, was unusually quiet, her eyes darting around the campsite as if expecting Stella to emerge from the trees at any moment. Their reactions were raw and real, a stark contrast to Trevor’s forced composure.

Markus was focused on his phone, desperately trying to get a signal so he could call for help. But we were too deep in the wilderness—there was no reception to be found. When Trevor handed him the walkie-talkie, Markus’s frustration only grew when he realized the batteries were dead. The damned batteries! It was such a small, seemingly insignificant detail, but in that moment, it felt like the final straw. Markus wasn’t one to lose his cool easily, but I could see the tension in his jaw, the way his fingers tightened around the useless device.

We wasted more time than we should have, arguing and throwing around wild speculations. Tempers flared, and soon the blame game began. Why hadn’t anyone noticed Stella leaving? Why didn’t we have someone on watch? Why were the batteries forgotten? The argument went on for a while, with everyone pointing fingers and trying to assign responsibility. I kept my distance from the heated discussion, not wanting to get involved. But it was impossible to stay completely out of it—they dragged me into it, asking for my opinion, demanding that I pick a side. I didn’t know Stella as well as the others, and I wasn’t eager to wade into the fray.

It was almost midday by the time we finally decided to split into two groups to search for Stella. The tension in the air was palpable as we made the decision. I ended up paired with Trevor, while Colin and Fay stuck together, still caught up in their arguments and mounting fears. Markus, the most level-headed of us, volunteered to stay behind at the camp in case Stella returned on her own. It was a sensible move, but it also carried an unspoken hope that maybe, just maybe, Stella would walk back into camp as if nothing had happened.

Trevor tried to lighten the mood as we set out, tossing out a few jokes that didn’t quite land. His usual easygoing demeanor was strained, the laughter forced, and it was clear he was using humor as a shield against the growing anxiety. I could see the worry etched into his face, betraying the confidence he was trying so hard to project. Despite his efforts to keep things light, I knew he was just as concerned as the rest of us, if not more so.

As we trudged through the thick underbrush, calling Stella’s name into the dense forest, the weight of the situation pressed down on me. The forest, which had seemed so peaceful and welcoming just a day before, now felt different. The silence was heavy, the usual sounds of the forest—rustling leaves, birdsong—seemed muted, as if the forest itself was holding its breath. The only sounds were our footsteps crunching on the fallen leaves and the occasional distant call of a bird, which only served to remind me how isolated we were out here.

At one point, Trevor stopped and looked around, his brow furrowed in concentration. “Do you hear that?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

I strained my ears, but all I could hear was the wind rustling through the leaves and the distant sound of a stream. “Hear what?” I whispered back, my heart pounding in my chest.

He shook his head, his expression troubled. “I don’t know. I thought I heard…something. But maybe it’s just my imagination.”

We continued on, but the tension only grew stronger with each step. It was as if we were venturing deeper into a place we weren’t meant to go, a place that felt more untamed with each step. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I couldn’t help but wonder if we were making a mistake by splitting up.

As the daylight began to wane, Trevor and I exchanged a glance, the unspoken worry hanging heavy between us. We hadn’t found any trace of Stella—no footprints, no signs that she had passed this way. It was as if she had vanished into thin air. Whatever I had expected at that moment, the reality turned out to be far worse and more unexpected than anything my imagination could have conjured. I had come on this trip hoping for a change, a break from the monotony of my everyday life. But sometimes, change comes in ways we can’t anticipate, and in moments like this, I found myself longing for the warmth and safety of the familiar, for the comfort of the world I had taken for granted.

Trevor and I made our way back to camp, our steps growing faster as we noticed Markus frantically waving us over. The sight of him should have been reassuring, but something felt off. As we drew closer, we spotted Stella—she was back at the camp, but something about her was different. Her gear, which she had taken with her when she vanished, was nowhere to be seen. Her jacket, once a snug fit, now hung loosely over her shoulders, almost as if she had lost weight since we last saw her. She was standing there, motionless, her back turned to us. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but something about the way she was standing made my stomach knot.

We quickened our pace, closing the distance between us and Markus. He looked relieved to see us, but that relief was tainted with something else—something that kept his muscles tense, his eyes darting nervously between us and the still figure of Stella. We approached cautiously, trying to mask our unease as we called out to her, asking what happened, why she left with all her things, why she was standing there like a statue.

But Markus didn’t answer our questions. His expression only darkened, his unease deepening into something bordering on dread. It was as if he was struggling to reconcile what he was seeing with what he knew, as if the person standing in front of us wasn’t Stella at all.

Trevor, in a desperate attempt to bring some sense of normalcy back to this strange moment, stepped forward. He called out to Stella, his voice tinged with frustration and concern, demanding to know what the hell was going on. He reached out, placing a hand on her shoulder, intending to turn her around and finally get some answers.

But when she turned, the world seemed to tilt off its axis. Her face—if you can even call it that—was different, as if someone had stretched her features across her skull, pulling them into an expression that wasn’t quite right. Her eyes were too wide, her smile too tight, like she was trying to mimic a human expression but hadn’t quite figured it out.

I felt my stomach churn as the thing that looked like Stella opened its mouth and spoke, but the voice that came out was hollow, a flat echo of what Stella’s voice used to be. “Come with me. I have something to show you,” it said, the words chillingly devoid of any warmth. Its arms stretched out toward Trevor, repeating the same sentence, “Come with me. I have something to show you,” as it stepped closer, the distorted face never losing that unnerving smile.

Trevor stood frozen, his hand slipping away from the creature’s shoulder as he took an instinctive step back. But before he could react further, the creature’s face contorted again, this time emitting a sound that was even worse—a voice filled with panic, fear, and desperation. It was Stella’s voice, but it was real this time, or at least it sounded real. “Oh my God, please, please no. Go away, please, oh my God, please no,” the creature wailed, but the face remained locked in that twisted, unsettling grin, mocking the terror in its voice. The contrast was unbearable, like a cruel parody of Stella’s final moments, and Trevor, usually so composed, looked as though he was about to break down right there.

Then, without warning, the creature’s arm shot out, its fingers wrapping around Trevor’s wrist with impossible strength. There was a moment of horrified silence before I heard it—a sickening crack as the creature effortlessly snapped the bone in his arm. Trevor’s scream pierced the air, a sound so raw and full of pain that it jolted me out of my frozen state.

But before I could do anything, Markus—bless him—sprang into action. I saw him out of the corner of my eye, grabbing the walkie-talkie we thought was useless, and he charged at the creature, swinging it with all his might. The first blow landed hard, and for a moment, I thought it was over—the creature stumbled, releasing its grip on Trevor, who collapsed to the ground, clutching his broken arm. But the creature didn’t flee. Instead, it turned its head slowly towards Markus, that awful grin never faltering, its eyes locking onto him with a terrifying intensity.

Markus didn’t back down. He kept swinging, landing hit after hit, each blow more desperate than the last. But the creature barely flinched, its body absorbing the impact as if it’s made of something far more resilient than flesh. In a horrifying blur of motion, the creature lunged at Markus, its limbs moving with a speed and fluidity that shouldn’t be possible. They were locked together now, Markus struggling against the thing with every ounce of strength he had, but it was clear he was outmatched.

I stood there, paralyzed by fear, as the creature twisted and contorted, using its inhuman strength to overpower Markus. I could see the sheer terror in his eyes, the dawning realization that this might be the end. And then it happened—a swift, brutal motion as the creature twisted his neck with a force that no human could muster. The sound of Markus’s neck snapping was like a thunderclap, echoing through the trees, followed by the sickening thud of his lifeless body hitting the ground.

I wanted to scream, to run, to do anything, but all I could do was watch in horror as the creature dragged Markus’s body into the woods, disappearing into the darkness. The shadows swallowed them whole, leaving Trevor and me alone in the clearing, too shocked, too terrified to even move. We just stood there, staring after them, as the full weight of what just happened crashed down on us like a wave, threatening to drown us in despair.

Half an hour later, Colin and Fay returned from their search, their faces streaked with tears. The moment they walked into the clearing, I could see that they were shattered by something they’d seen, but in their grief, they didn’t immediately notice that Markus was missing too. What followed was a chaotic, disjointed exchange of words as they tried to explain what they found. I wanted to tell them everything, to spill out the horror that was still churning inside me, but then I saw Trevor out of the corner of my eye. He was shaking his head, a silent plea for me to stay quiet. There was a desperate, almost wild look in his eyes that said it all: No one would believe us. Not unless they had seen it with their own eyes.

Trevor, ever the quick thinker, began weaving a story. He told them that a wild animal—probably a feral dog—attacked the camp, and that Markus had chased it into the woods to scare it off. I could tell that Colin and Fay were skeptical; their eyes darted between us, searching for something that made sense, but they were too distraught, too overwhelmed by their own discovery to press the issue.

Through choked sobs, they told us what they found: Stella’s body, lying broken at the base of a cliff. Her face had been completely shattered by the fall, making it impossible to recognize her by sight alone. They had only identified her by the tattoos on her arms—tattoos they knew all too well. Her clothes were gone, stripped away, and there was no sign of her gear. They began to speculate wildly, trying to piece together a narrative that could make sense of it all—maybe she fell, maybe she was attacked, maybe she tried to run and didn’t make it. But their theories were grasping at straws, their minds refusing to accept the impossible.

As they talked, I sat there, feeling myself slipping into a catatonic state. My thoughts were a tangled mess, the nightmarish events replaying over and over in my head. It was as if my brain was trying to shield me from the full weight of what I’d seen, but it was a futile effort. The memory of that unnerving smile, the sound of bones snapping, and Markus’s lifeless body being dragged into the woods were seared into my mind.

Someone—maybe it was Fay—suggested firing a flare to signal for help. I didn’t know why we hadn’t thought of it sooner, but it was like my brain had been running on empty, incapable of processing even the most basic solutions. Trevor, with his uninjured arm, pulled a flare gun from one of the packs and fired it into the sky. The bright burning light arced into the air, casting an eerie glow over the treetops before it fizzled out into the darkening sky. The flare seemed to hang there for a moment, suspended in the oppressive silence before it vanished, leaving us in a world that suddenly felt even darker, even more isolated than before.

The rest of the events blurred together in my memory. The shrill noise of a helicopter cutting through the stillness, the sudden rush of wind as it descended, the search and rescue teams flooding the campsite, asking questions we couldn’t answer. We were whisked away from that cursed place, taken far from the horrors that had unfolded there, but the terror remained lodged deep within me, a constant reminder of the nightmare that had become our reality.

—

It's been six months since that day, and in all that time, none of us have spoken a word about it. After the initial frenzy of our return, when everyone was asking questions and the police were involved, everything just… stopped. The others—Colin, Fay, Trevor—they’re like ghosts to me now, people I once knew but can no longer reach. We all attended Stella’s funeral, but that was the last time I saw them. We stood there, numbly watching as her casket was lowered into the ground, the weight of everything unsaid pressing down on us. None of us had the courage to speak of what really happened, of the horror we had witnessed. And Markus—Markus is still listed as missing. His family holds onto hope, even though Trevor and I know the truth. But neither of us had the guts to tell them, to look them in the eyes and explain that their son, their brother, isn’t just missing—he’s gone, in a way that no one should ever have to understand.

I thought I could move on, bury it deep inside, and go back to the life I had before. I even convinced myself that maybe it was all just some terrible nightmare, that my mind had twisted reality into something far darker than it really was. But deep down, I know the truth. I know that what we saw out there, what happened to Stella and Markus, wasn’t something you could explain away with logic or reason. It was something far worse, something that had been waiting for us in those woods, waiting for the right moment to strike.

I can’t keep this to myself any longer. It’s eating me alive, the fear, the guilt. I have to tell someone, anyone, before it consumes me completely. That’s why I’m writing this down, why I’m trying to put into words the nightmare that’s been haunting me for months. Maybe if I can get it out, if I can finally share what happened, I can start to move on. Maybe I can convince myself that it wasn’t real, that it was all just some horrible hallucination brought on by stress and exhaustion.

But something happened today that shattered that fragile hope. Something that made it impossible for me to deny the truth any longer.

This morning, I was sitting in my usual spot at the coffee shop, sipping my latte, trying to convince myself that everything was fine, that I could go back to normal. But then I saw him—Markus, or something that looked like him. He was sitting a few tables away, casually flipping through a magazine, as if nothing had happened. But his face… his face was wrong. It was distorted, stretched, like someone had taken his features and pulled them over something else. Everything was slightly off—his eyes were too far apart, his mouth too wide, and his nose was just a little too crooked. It was like looking at a poor imitation of the man I once knew.

And then he smiled at me.

It wasn’t a normal smile. It was an awful, twisted grin that stretched his face even further, pulling the skin taut until it looked like it might split. My stomach churned, and a cold wave of terror washed over me. I wanted to scream, to run, but I was frozen in place, my eyes locked on that grotesque smile.

No one else seemed to notice. The barista called out orders, people chatted on their phones, and the world went on as if nothing was wrong. But I knew—I knew that thing sitting there wasn’t Markus, not really.

I bolted out of the coffee shop, leaving my drink behind, my heart pounding in my chest. I didn’t stop running until I was back at my apartment, my hands trembling as I fumbled with the keys. Now, I’m sitting at my desk, staring at the clock, but my mind is far away, back in those mountains. My eyes drift to the window, to the distant peaks that loom on the horizon, and all I can do is pray. Pray that whatever exists out there stays where it is, that it doesn’t follow me here, that it doesn’t spill over into this world.

But deep down, I know it’s too late.
