There's a tunnel in my hometown, one that isn't on any map. It’s not marked by a sign, nor is it mentioned in any travel guide or local legend. Yet, everyone here knows about it. They whisper its name in hushed tones, usually as a cautionary tale to keep children from wandering too far into the woods. But we all know the real reason they don’t want anyone to go near it: the tunnel is cursed.

It all started with a dare. It always does, doesn’t it? My friend Mark was the brave one, or perhaps the foolish one, depending on how you look at it. He boasted that he wasn’t afraid of some old tunnel. No curse could scare him. So, on a dreary Friday night, five of us set out to prove the tunnel was nothing more than an abandoned relic.

The entrance was hidden beneath a thicket of overgrown bushes, barely wide enough for a person to squeeze through. As we crawled in, a chill ran down my spine. The air inside was unnaturally cold, and the sound of our footsteps echoed ominously, as if the tunnel itself was alive and listening.

We brought flashlights, but the darkness seemed to swallow the light, making it hard to see more than a few feet ahead. The tunnel stretched on and on, far longer than any of us expected. We walked for what felt like hours, the walls damp and narrow, closing in on us.

“Maybe we should turn back,” suggested Lisa, her voice trembling. Mark scoffed and pressed on, the rest of us reluctantly following. As we continued, a strange sensation began to set in, a feeling of disorientation. It was as if the tunnel was shifting, warping reality around us.

Then came the whispers. At first, they were faint, almost imperceptible. But soon they grew louder, echoing off the walls, voices overlapping and murmuring incoherent words. We tried to ignore them, but the unease was palpable.

“What the hell is that?” Jake whispered, his flashlight beam flickering as if the batteries were dying. None of us answered; we were too scared to speak.

Mark stopped abruptly, causing us to bump into each other. Ahead of us, in the dim light, we saw a figure. It was standing still, facing away from us, its silhouette barely visible. “Who’s there?” Mark called out, but the figure didn’t respond. Instead, it began to move, not away from us, but deeper into the tunnel.

Against our better judgment, we followed. It felt like we had no choice, like an invisible force was compelling us forward. The tunnel twisted and turned, defying all logic. We should have reached the end by now, or at least an exit. But there was nothing—just more darkness and those haunting whispers.

Eventually, we reached a dead end. Or at least, that’s what it looked like. The figure was gone, vanished into thin air. Mark approached the wall, running his hands over the cold, damp surface. “This can’t be right,” he muttered. “It has to go somewhere.”

Then, the whispers stopped. The silence was deafening, pressing down on us like a physical weight. Suddenly, the wall in front of us began to crack and crumble, revealing a narrow passage. Without thinking, Mark squeezed through, and we had no choice but to follow.

What we saw on the other side defied explanation. It was another tunnel, identical to the one we had just left. The same cold air, the same oppressive darkness. We walked on, driven by a mixture of fear and desperation. Hours turned into days, or maybe it was just minutes—time had lost all meaning.

One by one, my friends started to disappear. Lisa was the first. She screamed, and when we turned around, she was gone. No trace of her, just empty air. Jake and Sarah were next, swallowed by the darkness without a sound. Soon, it was just Mark and me, trudging through the endless tunnel.

I don’t know how long we walked, or how many times we circled back. The tunnel never ended; it just kept going, looping back on itself like a twisted maze. Mark eventually gave up, sitting down and refusing to move. “We’re never getting out,” he said, his voice hollow.

I kept going, though. I had to. And then, finally, I saw it—a faint light ahead. I ran towards it, tears streaming down my face. But when I reached the source, I found myself back at the entrance, staring out at the night sky.

Mark was gone, and so were the others. I was the only one who made it out, but I’m not sure if I ever really escaped. The tunnel still haunts my dreams, and sometimes, when I close my eyes, I can still hear those whispers.

I don’t know what happened to my friends, and I don’t know what the tunnel is or why it exists. But if you ever find yourself in my hometown, stay away from the woods. Don’t go looking for the tunnel that never ends.

Because if you find it, you might never come back.
