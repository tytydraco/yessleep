We picked up our research where we left off. Extract the hidden signal from each track, then use the key in the metadata to crack it. Once we lined them up, a path emerged.

Minamata, Japan.  
Hatton, Sri Lanka.  
Sudbury, Ontario.

A line across continents.

“That’s five thousand miles in a few hours,” said Mark. “No rain system moves like that. Neither does whoever’s recording it.”

“It’s multiple recorders,” I said. “Rainy D4y Sm0ke Sesh, D33p Focus Study Ambience, Napt1me Therapy. Each is a different person, but they’re all part of the same network.”

“So then, multiple rains,” said Mark. “Multiple instances of the same phenomenon: this… oily rain.”

“Why these places?” I asked. “What does it do to them?”  
  
“Rain can… carry particles: pollen, pathogens, chemicals…”  
  
“Are there any more matches in your database?”  
  
“There’s nothing I see. But I’m a sound engineer, not a meteorologist. I should be asking my colleagues about this.”  
  
“Would you? I don’t want to waste their time.”  
  
“No, no. They love this sort of thing.” He laughed, then stopped. “I mean… who else gets obsessive over raindrops? It sounds exactly like the people I work with.”

The silence stretched.

“It’d be insane,” he said finally, quieter now, “if they were already involved.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
It’s been hard to be excited about any of this. It sounds captivating: a life made more interesting by a thread uncovered, leading you deeper and deeper into sonic mystery. But how can I feel anything but dread when it’s harder than ever to sleep?

I can’t keep listening to the rain sounds that used to put me to bed. They don’t soothe me anymore. They make me alert. Instead of drifting off, I find myself listening for something, waiting for the next signal to slip beneath the dripping.

Now I only play them during the day, mapping the full breadth of the network embedded in Spotify’s music-makers. Coffee 5hop Drizzle, M1sty Sund4y, Fancy Polka-dot Umbre77a, Surprise Sprin6 Downpour, and M00dy Cloudburst. I dug until there was nothing left to find, then kept checking anyway, just in case a new name surfaced overnight.  
  
Every catalog I uncovered went straight to Mark. Days passed without a response. He’d been so eager at first that I told myself he was just busy, buried in real work, not this obsession of mine. Still, I wanted more than silence. I asked if he could at least show me how to run the analysis myself.  
  
His reply came all at once. Coordinates. Nothing else.  
  
It irritated me more than it should have. Lack of sleep does that. It breeds stories. I imagined myself as a curiosity to him, a harmless lunatic to be nudged along, encouraged to keep rambling about phantom noises in the rain. A joke with a long setup and no punchline.  
  
Fine. Whatever.

The day eventually came when a new artist added itself to the network. And it hurt slightly that I had no one left to share this with who would understand. Especially because these sounds weren’t rain at all, yet they were unmistakably connected.  
  
All the familiar tells were there. N1ghtst0rm. An AI-generated banner: a quiet suburb at night, streetlights glowing amber while a solid sheet of gray cloud sealed off the stars. The albums followed the same pattern, storm fronts caught mid-reveal, their edges briefly exposed as lightning washed them in color.

Thunder, by itself, was harsh. A lone drum waking up the neighborhood. How anyone could sleep to this was beyond me. I recall my Homedics SoundSpa, an analog unit back in the 2000s, with a rotary knob to switch between rain, waves, white noise, or thunder. Hideous thunder. Not frightening in the way storms scare children. Obnoxious. Overly bombastic with little substance.  
  
*Certainly, you have to wonder why.* I typed out my email to Mark. *A sudden change in the pattern. Where was the rain?? Come on, Mark. This was OUR project, and now I’m left feeling silly. I don’t wanna seem ungrateful for the data you’re giving me, but it's begging to be discussed!*

I included the latest batch of tracks, each one bearing a familiar scrambled signal hidden under its loudest booms. And in a measly ten minutes, the results were returned to me. Short, succinct. I took it scornfully.  
  
43.1795° N, 102.5686° W.  
  
That was it. No explanation. No commentary. Not even a “take a look at this.”  
  
I copied the numbers into my browser more out of irritation than curiosity. It felt like busywork he’d tossed back at me so I’d stop pestering him.  
  
The map loaded.  
  
At first, nothing looked wrong. Just a familiar sprawl of streets and yards, the soft green and gray geometry of a place designed to be forgotten. I zoomed in, waiting for the name of some foreign city to appear.  
  
The street names resolved instead.  
  
I frowned and zoomed back out, then in again. The same grid. My grid.  
  
No, that couldn’t be right. I must’ve mistyped it. I checked the numbers. Checked Mark’s message. Copied and pasted this time, careful, deliberate.  
  
The pin snapped back into place.  
  
My block.  
  
Not the town. Not the neighborhood in a broad way. The pin hovered precisely over my apartment building, over the little courtyard behind it. The satellite image showed the same cracked concrete I’d been meaning to scrub. The same shadow from the tree outside the corner window stretched thin across the patio.  
  
I sat very still, waiting for the feeling to clarify itself.  
  
I laughed once, quietly, just to see if it sounded normal. It didn’t feel like I’d been discovered. It felt like I was being included.  
  
*Thrumm—brooooom.* Thunder rolled outside. Real thunder, not the synthetic kind. It startled me badly enough that my chair scraped the floor.  
  
I hovered over the reply button. Typed Mark’s name. Deleted it. Typed it again. What do you even ask at this point?  
  
Outside, the sky stayed heavy and gray, holding itself together. Waiting.

I lay in bed with a pillow clamped over my head, trying to smother the noise. The thunder pushed through anyway, each roar vibrating the walls, rebounding around my room. It went on like a band rehearsing in the apartment next door, relentless, careless of the hour. Only after twenty full minutes without a tremor did I ease the pillow away.

I hoped the storm was breaking. What came next through the window was gentler. Rain, steady and precise, each drop hitting with the right pitch. It slicked the glass in a soft, buttery sheen.

The bed felt familiar again. Safe. The sound lulled me, pulled at my thoughts until they loosened. I didn’t get up to look outside. I closed my eyes and listened.

Sleep took me hard.

I dreamed of ants. Golden ones, shining like sap, spilling from the seams of my walls. I couldn’t move. They poured over me, finding their way in through my eyes, my nose, my mouth. I felt them spread inside my body, warm and deliberate.

And with it came calm. The kind that arrives all at once, chemical and complete, like whatever your brain releases right before it shuts everything down.

\*\*\*

I woke late, light already filling the room. My body felt scrubbed clean, rested in a way that bordered on unnatural. Three days of sleep packed into one night. My limbs were loose. My thoughts lined up easily.

When I swallowed, pain flared.

My throat felt scraped raw, like I’d been shouting into wind for hours. My voice came out thin when I tested it, a papery rasp that didn’t match how good the rest of me felt. There was a dull pressure in my ears too, not ringing exactly, more like cotton stuffed too deep.   
  
 Outside, the world had corrected itself. Pavement dry. Windows clear. No trace of the rain’s oily sheen. If I hadn’t watched it coat the glass, I would have sworn the storm never happened.

I sat at my desk and dug right back into Spotify. I opened N1ghtst0rm, and there was a new release waiting for me, with a new AI cloud, dark and forboding. *Certainly, you have to wonder why.* The name of the album. The name of the first track.

I clicked play.

Rain filled my headphones immediately. Not thunder this time. No rolling impact, no violence. Just rainfall, steady and close, like it was landing inches from my ears. It had that same careful rhythm as the night before. The same precision.

I waited for the signal beneath it, the low electrical shape that always sat under his recordings.

It never came.

Instead, something else rose up from below the threshold of hearing. Not words. Not even sound, at first. Just pressure. Then texture. Then the unmistakable cadence of breath forced too fast through a throat already ruined.

I froze.

As I listened, the noise clarified itself against my will. Subaudible, buried deep enough that I felt it more than heard it. A young man screaming. Long, panicked sounds tearing themselves apart mid-breath. The wet hitch at the back of the throat. The rawness. The certainty that it hurt to make noise and that stopping would hurt more.

I pulled the headphones off.

The room stayed quiet.

My ears still felt numb, but my throat burned hotter now, as if reminded of something it had done recently and wished it hadn’t.

I didn’t need to play it again. I knew the shape of those sounds. I knew the way the fear surged and broke.

They were mine.
