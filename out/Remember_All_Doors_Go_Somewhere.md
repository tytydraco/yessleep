You ever experienced something that happened to you that changed your perspective of the entire world? Like the thing that happened doesn't make sense, but now you have to try and rationalize it, even though you can’t. It's like the cloak of illusion has been lifted from your eyes, and you are now forced to accept this truth for the rest of your life. Well, welcome to my new life.

My name's Jared. I'm not gonna do any formalities or long introductions, I'ma get right to the point. Have you ever seen one of the Doors? Not a normal door like your house door or car or whatever, I'm talking about the Doors that are in places they shouldn't, Doors that when you look at them, you just know something is wrong. We did. My friends and I unknowingly entered one. No one believed my story except for a detective named Broc Clauthorn, who worked for some four-letter agency. He's the only reason I'm not in jail for my friend's disappearance. It's all my fault and if I could go back I would. I hope my story will be a warning for you and a concession for me.

It happened a few months ago. My friends and I like to urban explore, so we went to visit some old factory near our town. One friend was a girl named Luca and the other was a dude named Tommy. We were your typical young adults. Tommy was the one who found the place and had been blabbing about it all year, and since Luca and I were tired of it, we gave in and went. The factory was this big metallic structure, no different from one you'd see in all old industrial towns. The way in was a simple kick to an old window.

We walked around the upper rafters, jumping across gaps, laughing and balancing on poles, which stressed the hell out of Luca. Eventually, I got bored and wanted to check out the factory floor, so we went down these old rickety stairs and arrived in an arena-sized jungle of machinery. Overall I’m not very bright, so I couldn't tell what they were used for. All I knew was they were huge, and they looked like if they turned on they would snap us in two. Luca was the first to say what we were all thinking,

“What the hell were these used for?”

Tommy got closer to one and gave it the old once over.

“It looks like some kind of claw. Maybe they were cutting stuff with it.”

“Cutting what?” Luca asked.

“Who cares!?” I said. “It don't work anymore anyway.”

Luca kept eyeing them while Tommy walked further up the assembly line with me close behind. The fading light of the evening sky leaked in from some old windows, giving the factory a cool, eerie look. We kept walking until we got to the front of the factory where there was this huge machine that looked like a furnace. It towered over every other machine. There was a big vent on the bottom, and above that was a giant curved glass window with a giant sticker on the front. The sticker was super high up. It looked a little weird and I was about to look closer when Tommy hit my arm and pointed towards a weird notebook on the ground. 

“Ooh, this might tell us what those things did!” He said, sounding like a kid in a candy store. I hit his arm back.

“Alright, go read it Nerd. See what “evil” those devices did.” He gave me a stupid grin and grabbed it off the ground, causing dust to kick up. 

“What'd you find?” Luca asked, joining us and trying to brush some grime off her shirt. “This place is nasty.”

“He found some book,” I said turning and getting closer to her, raising my hands like a ghost. “Maybe it will reveal the evil spirits that haunt this place, because those machines scalped their organs.”

“Bleah! You're stupid.” She said, pushing me away. “Ghosts aren't real.”

“Don't let the ghost hear ya say that,” I said in a spooky voice before laughing. “A ghost encounter would be cool though. We could post it on YouTube and get tons of views.” 

“Whatever dude.” She shrugged. “What do you think that big machine is?” She pointed at the big furnace thing.

“Dunno.” I shrugged and turned back to it. “It kinda looks like it was used for…” I trailed off as my eyes drifted back towards the sticker. As I focused on it, it began looking less like a sticker. It was rectangular and appeared to glow black. I know glowing black doesn't make sense, but there’s no other way to describe it. It made my head feel a little funny, and there was some other color on it, but I couldn't tell what it was. “You seein that too, Luca?”

“Seeing what?”

“That thing on the glass,” I said, pointing.

“The sticker?” She asked.

“Yeah, I guess. It looks weird, right?”

“Not really. It's just a yellow warning sticker.”

I gave myself whiplash with how fast I turned to her.

 “Clearly we're not seein the same thing,” I said, moving behind her. “Up there.” I guided her finger to point up at it.

“Get off me!” She said, shaking me off. “That's what I'm talking about, dumb a\*\*!”

I blinked. “It really don’t look weird to you?”

“No. It’s just a warning sticker.” She raised an eyebrow. “What are you seeing?” 

“Not that,” I said. “It looks like some black rectangle.” She side-eyed me. 

“You high dude? You learned your colors and shapes, right?” I smirked at her. 

“Why don't we let Tommy settle this. Hey Tommy!” 

“Shhh,  shut up I'm reading!”

“What?! You're still looking at that book? You stuck on a word or somethin?” I teased.

“Shut up.” He said. “This isn't making any sense so I'm trying to read other parts, but it makes even less sense the more I read.”

“Well, what's it say?” He sighed and raised it up.

“To quote this guy, “The Orius worked today. We managed to bring \_\_\_\_ to the facility, but its pressure was too much. We had to \_\_\_ but that caused even more issues for \_\_\_\_. We will have to break it up. The “family” demands results so we \_\_\_\_ but if \_\_\_ then we have to \_\_\_\_. The piece will arrive at the factory later today. We'll just have to make sure it doesn't stick to any surfaces or it will \_\_\_.”” He put the book down and turned to me, 

“You see why it doesn't make sense? Some of these words are redacted, making it lose context. Then there’s that mention of an “Orius”, but I can't figure out what that is.”

“Huh ok, well that’s…”  

“Oh! And check this thing out!” He said cutting me off and holding out a strange-looking metallic badge. The badge had the letters L.K. with a strange logo behind it. He pulled it back and clipped it onto his shirt. “I found it in between those pages. I think this badge belongs to the guy that wrote this.”

“Ah ok that's great and all but,”  I grabbed his hand, causing him to drop the book and pointed to where the strange black rectangle was. “You see that thing up there? What does it look like to you?” Tommy blinked at me, clearly taken aback by my dismissal, but after a moment he turned his head to where I pointed.

“I don't know, some kind of label?”

“Right. But what color is it?” 

“I don't know, red?”

Luca and I looked at each other.

“What?” Tommy inquired.

“Apparently y'all don't know your colors,” Luca said, frowning and crossing her arms. I sighed.

“Ok, so clearly someone's wrong here. It's probably some stupid trick of the light so there's an easy way to solve this.” I leaned down to the ground and found a nice heavy piece of rubble. “I'm gonna knock it down and we'll see what it looks like up close.”

“That's a terrible idea! It's on glass, idiot. If you do that it will shatter everywhere.” Luca scolded.

“Eh, just back up, and mind the machines in case they turn on,” I said and took aim. 

Now I know what you're thinking. “That was pretty stupid”, and you'd be right. I'm impulsive and that would not be the last time that impulsivity caused problems, but at the time the need to settle that debate ruled out whatever logic existed in my brain.

“Dude, Stop! We don’t know what that will do and…” A loud crash sounded as my rubble hit the glass. We all jumped back as glass rained down from the machine and clattered to the ground.

“How many layers of stupid are you?” Luca asked, staring dumbfounded at me.

“Hey you weren't volunteerin any solutions or-”

“Wait, what the hell?! What's going on? Look at that.” Tommy sounded startled. I looked up to where I threw the rubble. 

“Whoa,” I said. Despite the glass around the sticker being gone, the sticker floated in place, as did the piece of rubble I had thrown.

“Hey Luca! There's our ghost!” 

She ignored me and stared. Tommy was also silent, flipping frantically through the book.

Now here's one of the parts that I regret. I mentioned before that I'm impulsive, and if I could go back, I would slap myself to stop me from what happened next, but you know what they say, hindsight is 20-20.

“Hey, ghost! Catch!” I yelled as I threw another piece of rubble.

“What? No!” Luca yelled and held out her arm.

“Wait, I think that the…” Tommy's words were cut off by a loud vibrating sound that echoed through the factory. We looked around and realized in shock that it came from the sticker. As we stared, the pieces of rubble began rotating around it, like an atom, and its form began to change. It shifted from a flat object to a 3-D one to a, well, something D that made my head hurt. It then began to “open” like a Door. There's no other word to describe it. It started pulsing a color that felt violent. It wasn't like a normal color, but a feeling color. That doesn't make sense, but that's what it was. 

Then we started floating. I felt my body become tight and when I looked down, I saw the floor getting farther away. Tommy and Luca started screaming with fear and I did too. We floated towards the giant Door thing, and together we were thrust into a world of violent color and pressure. It felt like my body was being ripped apart as I vibrated and shifted. Soon I lost the ability to see, not because it was too dark or too bright, but because everything around me overwhelmed my senses. Then I began to feel an uncontrollable burning sensation that felt like it was killing me. All I could do was pray that whatever this was would end soon. Just as I felt on death's door, it suddenly stopped. At first, I had no idea what was going on due to my blown-out senses, but gradually I began to feel, see, and hear again and I realized my body felt…wet?

I sat up and looked around. I found myself in some kind of shallow lake. The water was a calming midnight black, and it went on infinitely in all directions. At random parts of the lake, there were these shiny lamp posts with bright yellow-orange orbs on top. They looked like lights, but not like man-made ones, but like they were alive. They reflected off the water, making the areas around them glow. The sky was completely black, but strange, somewhat eerie looking things with lights moved all around, going in all directions. The things looked like trains, with small wheels on the bottoms and an interior glow similar to the yellow-orange lights. They too reflected off the surface of the water and reminded me of being on the ocean at night, with the stars dancing and moving in strange patterns. 

Somewhere within me a voice told me there was something off about this place, but then a hypnotic voice appeared that spoke a little louder, and it told me everything would be ok. I began to slip into my mind, when another voice brought me back…

“Aawwg…what the hell?” I turned and saw Tommy lifting himself out of the water.

“Oh! Hey dude, glad to see you're here too,” I said cheerfully.

“Yeah, no thanks to you.” He paused and looked up. “Where are…whoa…”

“Think we're dead?” I joked. I heard loud splashes aggressively coming towards me.

“NOT YET, BUT YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE!”

I turned just in time to see Luca jump at me, and before I could react my face was in the water. 

“YOU FREAKING DUMBA\*\*, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? YOUR BRAIN MUST BE MADE OF CHEESE WITH HOW MANY HOLES IT HAS IN IT, BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY SOMEONE WITH A FUNCTION ONE WOULD DO SOMETHING SO STUPID!”

I tried to respond, but the water was getting into my mouth. I grabbed her arm and flipped her off of me, slamming her on her side into the water. 

“Hey, what do ya think you're doin? You tryna kill me?!”

She glared daggers at me. 

“What do you think?”

“Alright enough. Get married later.” Tommy said. “You all are missing this amazing view, wow!”

We lifted ourselves. Luca's face softened as she studied the sky. 

“Where do you think we are?” She asked.

“I don't know. Somewhere.” I said smiling.

“Thanks, genius.” She responded, rolling her eyes and standing up. Tommy and I did the same. 

“Let's go explore!” I said cheerfully.

“You are waay too calm about this. We don’t know if we’re safe here.” Luca said, glancing around.

“I don't know, the sky is just so beautiful, I think we’re gonna be ok. Right Tommy?”

Tommy continued to stare into the sky, like he was in a trance. Luca had to shake him to get his attention. After he focused, he pointed forward,

“Let's walk.”

We investigated the lamp post things with orbs and sure enough, they looked like lamp post things with orbs. The train things from above would sometimes stop and drift on the water around us, almost like they were checking us out, before drifting back into the sky. The more I walked, the more the voice within tried to warn me, but it was getting overpowered by the hypno one. After walking under a large post, Tommy turned to us and began speaking,

“I think that light we went through was that Orius thing the book was talking about.”

“What makes you say that?” Luca asked.

“Context clues,” Tommy responded blankly.

“Oh you mean that Door thing?” I asked. “Yeah you're probably right. Who puts doors on glass?”

Tommy and Luca turned to me. “Door thing?” Tommy asked.

“Yeah. Looked like a door, opened like a door. Door thing.”

They looked at each other before looking back at me. “You saw something in that light? How? That crap was like looking at the sun. How are you not blind?” Tommy asked. I shrugged.

“It's no wonder you're so stupid. You probably looked at the sun as a kid and it burned holes into your brain. Luca sighed. “I'm never exploring with you again.”

As we continued, more of the train things began coming down, but this time they would remain and began gliding on the water in circles around us.

“What are they doing?” Luca asked.

“I'm not sure,” Tommy responded. 

We stopped as more began to come down and join in the spin. The more that joined, the faster their spin became. They began to become a tornado of bright yellow-orange, flashing across my vision the faster they moved. It began to become somewhat hypnotic and I felt an intense urge to spin with them.

“It's a dance…” I mumbled drunkenly and began to smile. The voice began to repeat “Spin” over and over again in my head, and eventually I felt myself lose control and my body began to spin. 

“What are you…” Tommy began before his body jerked stiffly, like a puppet whose strings had gotten pulled, and with an uncanny grin, he joined in.

“What are you guys doing? What’s wrong with you?” Luca cried. She grabbed at me, but my body knocked her away. “Why? What is happening...” She whimpered as she picked herself up. A voice that wasn’t mine spoke through me,

“Luuuuca. Join us. Don’t you want to dance? Why are you so worried? Loosen up.” My body pointed to the lights circling us. “Isn’t this all beautiful? Just look at that light.”

“The light…” Luca mumbled as she began staring at the trains spinning around us. It didn’t take long before her face snapped into a grin and she bounced up screaming “Fuck it!” and she too joined the spin.

So together we twirled like ballerinas. We'd eventually fall over dizzy and laughing and would look at the sky. Something blurry and spinning in the darkness stared back and laughed along with us. After staring at it, we’d get up and do it again. The more we did this, the brighter the lights got and the faster the trains went, and we would match their speed. The spinning was beginning to make my head hurt, and I began to smell iron, but I couldn’t stop. The hypnotic voice fully dominated my head, telling me we’d stay forever and spin until we “joined the lights.” When I was able to look at the others, I noticed that their irises were beginning to glow yellow-orange. I don't know what would have happened if we continued to dance, but fortunately we were accidentally bailed out by Luca.

“Ouch.” She said, stopping her spin and falling into the water.

“What happened?’ I slurred.

“I-I don't know,” Luca said in a wobbly voice. It seemed she was freed, if only temporarily. She began feeling over the area she tripped. As she did, the train things began to slow down, which caused my spin to slow as well. “There-there's something dow-dow here. It's shiny.” She said.

“Who cares?” My voice said. “Stand up now! They demand we spin." Her eyes glowed brighter and she began to grin, but then she shook her head in resistance.

“Just…one…moment!” She said and pushed her hand into the water. 

“Stop!” I screamed at her as I heard a loud click. The trains and the voice stopped abruptly, and Tommy and I fell into the water. The world spun and I felt on the verge of passing out.

“What did you do…” I croaked, as I began crawling to her.

“Is…that a knob? Is this what I think it is?” She stuttered as the glow began to leave her eyes. When I finally reached her, I looked through the water. I saw the knob she was talking about and I scanned the surrounding area. I couldn’t believe it.

“This is a door! Not like the Door, but a normal door.” The voice within me, though weaker, was commanding me to leave it alone, but my survival voice was now in control and it pushed me to grab the knob and pull.

A collective sigh came from everywhere and immediately the trains and the sky turned red. The glow fully left our eyes and we began looking around. “Did we almost die?” Luca asked frantically. I shook my head, trying to dismiss the thought. 

“We’re all good now, that's all that matters.”

“I wouldn’t be so sure. Look!” Tommy whimpered.

I turned and gasped. At the furthest point away from us, while before the lake had seemed endless, there was now a void of nothing. Thanks to the red sky, we could tell the stark difference. We heard a loud CLACK and the lights and sky in front of the void went out.

“I think it's closing in,” Tommy said softly. I looked around and saw the void wasn’t just in front, but all around us. The trains flew erratically and when they flew into the void they were stopped violently, like the darkness itself grabbed them.

CLACK

Another section of lights and sky went out, bringing the void closer.

“The door…The door! Open the door!” Luca yelled.

“Yeah!” I responded and reached for the knob. I twisted again and attempted to pull upwards. I felt some give, but the water weighed it down. “I'ma need some help here!”

CLACK

“Ok Ok!” Luca said frantically and crouched down to where I was. She grabbed my arm and began pulling with me. It budged a little more, but it wasn't enough. “Tommy!”

“R-right.” He stuttered and ran over to grab my other arm, and together we pulled. It began to lift more, but it still wasn't enough. Eventually I lost my grip and we all fell backwards.

CLACK

I looked up again. Based on the lights still on, I figured we had about six CLACKS left before the void got us. I also noticed something in that darkness. It was hard to tell if my eyes were playing tricks or not, but I swear I could see some kind of face. Its features were indiscernible, but it had that same violent feeling color to it. It felt like the thing from the sky. It activated a deep primal fear that made me want to run, but there was nowhere to go.

I snapped out of it as I felt myself being shaken.

“GET UP!” Luca yelled. “We need to open this thing. What are you doing!?” 

An idea came to me then.

“I have an idea, it's probably dumb, but trust me. You two lift as hard as you can. I'm going to position my hands under the water, near the door's edge. The moment I feel some give I'm going to try to put my hands under it and lift. I'm the strongest of us, so I'm less likely to have my hands break. That may not make a lot of sense but-”

CLACK

“We've got five of those left. It's do or die. All of your strength. We got one shot!” They both nodded and together they got into position to grab the knob while I went down and began feeling for the edge of the door. “Now!” I commanded.

“Eerrrrrggg!” They both grunted and began forcing their bodies upwards.

CLACK 

I felt my heart rate quicken and I began desperately pushing my fingers near the edge. I could feel the door lifting but it wasn't enough.

CLACK 

“Keep going!” I yelled and pushed my fingers harder against it. All I needed was a small wedge.

CLACK 

Their faces were beginning to turn red. The darkness behind us was beginning to emit some kind of sound, but like the color I didn't hear it, I felt it. I moved one of my hands to the knob to assist and slowly began pulling while keeping my other near the edge.

CLACK 

“Aaaarg!” Both of them grunted with all of their might and I felt it. It was a small crack, but it was just enough. I shoved both hands under and without hesitation, I ripped my whole body upwards. They both fell back as the door swung open into a strange-looking room, and suddenly I felt a pressure suck my body inside. I turned quickly as I got dragged and grabbed Luca's arm and Tommy's leg, and together we flew downwards into the door. I heard the final,

CLACK

And a moment before the door closed, I saw a single ominous and hateful colored eye glaring into me, which sent me a horrifying vision of what would have happened if we had been a second slower. I refuse to write it down, but know that no matter what you believe in, if hell is where I go when I die, I know that whatever damnation is there, it will be a utopian heaven compared to what that thing would have done to me…

And that’s all the time I got for today. I hate to go, but I have to continue packing and grabbing supplies. I'm going to try to make things right, things I'll mention when I come back. In the meantime, don't go into any strange Doors you see. Be smarter than me. I'll see you all soon.
