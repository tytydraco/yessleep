“What is Mark to you?” I asked Jane as we progressed deeper into the forest. “Colleague, friend, boyfriend?”

Though I didn’t ask out of personal interest, I did find it interesting how willing she was to jump into danger. If I was going to rely on her, I needed to know exactly what kind of person I was working with.

“Why? I need an ulterior motive to help him?”

“People usually do,” I went on.

“I just don’t want anything to happen to him, isn’t that enough?”

“It is, but I can’t promise anything.”

We followed the thousands of converging red filaments as they turned to thick cords of twitching, vine-like structures, all heading the same way. Each of their strands had originated from various dying or dead animals that had long since succumbed to the infection, but their bodies appeared to keep going, preventing their corpses from decaying.

After about ten minutes of brisk walking, we reached the entrance, a point where an uncountable number of the organism’s appendages merged. There were no calls for help like Bill had described, but there was a faint rumbling emerging through the opening, akin to rasp, struggled breathing.

“So, what happens if we don’t make it?” Jane asked. “You might as well tell me; chances are we’re heading for our deaths.”

“Pearson makes a call back to my supervisor, and the company I work for deals with the situation.”

“What company might that be?”

“It’s better if you don’t know,” was all I could explain.

“This is your job, then? Risking your life for strangers,” Jane asked. She sounded nervous, but attempted to hide that fact by acting annoyed at my presence while also asking question after question to distract herself from the dangers we were about to face.

“Something like that.”

I entered the cave first, careful not to step on any of the cords littering the floor. No sooner had we crossed the threshold, than the atmosphere turned heavy, and the air unnaturally warm, humid. With a wet-bulb temperature that high, there was a real possibility that any victims trapped within the cave might have already perished from a heat stroke, or simple dehydration. Even our suits wouldn’t be able to protect us from these elements, which meant we only had a limited amount of time before we would be forced to retreat.

Then we found our first victim, a small fox entirely ensnared in the red filaments, fusing its body with the organism. Small tendrils emerged from the exposed organs, seeming to react to our presence, waving back and forth as we moved around the fox. But in spite of its obviously lethal injuries, the poor creature remained alive. Its eyes darted around the tunnel in panic, but it lacked the strength and mobility to tear itself free.

“Oh, God, that poor thing,” Jane said, her thoughts quickly returning to the matter at hand. “Do you think the organism can sense our presence?”

“It’s not our presence that it senses,” I replied as I pulled out a lighter, lit it up, and waved it in front of the tendrils, which diligently followed the flame. They were cautious not to get too close, lest they burn, showing some sense of self-preservation. Though primitive, the organism was able to sense elements that could harm it. “They react to heat,” I explained.

I pulled out the knife attached to my belt and severed the main cord from the suffering fox. In response, a new one grew out from the base, attempting to reestablish contact with the main organism, all the while the fox winced in pain. It wasn’t until I slit its throat and cut the cord simultaneously, before the fox finally stopped breathing. The tendrils within withered away, their crimson color turning a dull gray. The organism had functioned as a biological life support system, but the extent of its purpose wasn’t yet known.

We followed the main appendage of the organism, leading us further into the dwelling. There, we met with the cave’s previous occupants; a bear and its litter of five cubs, all huddled up, enveloped in the organism’s flesh. The mother seemed to have suffered the most, her body emaciated, and her muscles atrophied. It was the first confirmation we had that not only did the organism infect its individuals, but it appears to be feeding off them.

“This is just cruel,” Jane said. “Why won’t it just let them die?”

“You keep your meat in the fridge to keep it fresh?” I asked in return.

“Yeah, but…”

“And yet—you and me, we don’t decompose outside of the fridge, right?”

“What does that—oh,” Jane said, quickly understanding why the animals had to be kept alive.

“Meat is best kept fresh while it’s still breathing. I’m not sure this thing is capable of understanding the concept of suffering. It’s just following its nature. We shouldn’t take it personal.”

Leaving the sleuth of bears alone, we proceeded deeper into the dwelling, where it joined with a large network of caves. The further we walked, the denser the growths on the floors and walls got to the point where we could barely take a step without treading on the organism. With the heat almost reaching body temperature, and with our suits shielding us, the organism seemed mostly unaware of our presence, unable to detect our thermal signatures. Just a few filaments attempted to reach out but couldn’t penetrate our suits. Still, their attempts to ensnare us were enough to throw us off balance. Wrapping their appendages around Jane’s ankle, she was the first to slip. I was barely able to grab her before she stumbled into the cave walls, which might very well have slit through her suit, exposing her to the organism.

We continued through a couple of intersections, through twists and turns, trying to take note of various landmarks to find our way back out. With all the connecting tunnels, there had to be several openings to the cave network, because from each accessory passage, more cords joined in through the narrower paths. Loud echoes reverberated throughout the caves for each clumsy step we took, but the organism showed no outwards reaction to sound.

“Hello?” a voice called out from the dark. “Is there anyone there?”

Around the corner, we found Jane’s colleague, Mark. He was leaning against the cave wall, and his suit had been torn on his right shoulder, where the filaments had attached, eating their way into his body. Though the injury itself was minor, the resulting infection had rendered him unable to fight back. Red strands ran up his arm towards his neck, fusing him with the thicker cords running along the wall. He was in bad shape, that much was clear.

“Jane,” he let out, sounding relieved. “I knew you’d be dumb enough to come for me.”

“Shut up,” she responded. “We need to get you out of here.”

“What happened to you?” I asked.

“I fell,” he explained. “These things wrapped themselves around my leg… I just slipped.”

“Can you move?” I asked.

“I can’t even feel my legs. These things got inside me. I couldn’t…” he trailed off. “Can you help me?”

“Already working on it, but I need you to answer as many of my questions as you can,” I explained.

“Can’t you get me out of here first?”

“I need to know what I’m dealing with,” I went on. “Your colleague, Bill, he said you heard calls for help coming from within the cave. Is that right?”

“Yeah, they came from that direction,” he explained as he nodded his head in the same direction the cords were leading. “There’s a hole in the ground. It’s too deep to climb. But I swear there are people down there. We need to get them out.”

“Well, let’s worry about you first,” I said. “But I’m going to go and check it out. Jane, stay with him, keep him talking. Don’t let him fall asleep.”

Following Mark’s direction, I continued down the tunnel until I reached a deep pit leading infinitely down into the Earth. All the organism’s appendages joined at the pit and led downwards. From the bottom, I could hear faint, unintelligible calls. Though they sounded human, they resembled incomprehensible noises more than actual words.

Pointing my flashlight directly down the pit didn’t help much either, so to get a sense of how deep the hole stretched, I pried some wilted flesh off the wall, and ignited it with my lighter. It took a few attempts due to the humid conditions of the cave, but eventually I got a small flame going. I then dropped it, and watched it descend for several seconds, before it landed on a narrow ledge about a hundred feet down. While it wasn’t the bottom of the pit, it did reveal where the sound had come from, because on the ledge sat the remains of a mangled man, his skin replaced by the organism’s filaments, and the entirety of his fat and muscle consumed. Though he should have been dead, he still looked up and called out to me in a primal scream that held no decipherable meaning. The calls that Mark had heard undoubtedly came from the dead, or at least those who were now one with the organism. And without the right tools to treat Mark, he’d quickly turn into one of them.

Knowing I had no way of descending the pit, I returned to Jane, who was busy at work trying to find a way to pry Mark loose. Alas, the filaments were too engrained into his body, far beyond the point of detachment.

“I can see them, wriggling around at the back of my eyes. They’re already inside my head. It’s like I can hear them whisper.”

“What are they saying?” I asked.

“Just whispers. I don’t know. Please, just get me out of here,” he begged.

Jane, holding tightly onto Mark’s left, untainted hand, turned to me with pleading eyes, a gaze I almost didn’t dare to meet.

“What are we going to do?” she asked.

“We need to get back to the field lab. I can’t help him without my tools,” I explained.

“But we can’t leave him,” she pleaded.

“And you can’t stay. Every minute in here increases the risk of us ending up just like him. If you want to help him, you need to come with me.”

“Go,” Mark pleaded, his voice growing weaker, and his consciousness fading. “I’ll be fine.”

“I promise I’ll be back for you,” Jane said.

“I know. You always come back,” he said.

“Come on. Let’s go,” I ordered.

I let Jane go ahead of me, but as I prepared to follow, Mark reached out with his one good hand, grabbed onto me as he pulled me in close, and whispered into my ear: “the fifth Galilean moon has been found. They’re coming.”

Once he’d uttered those words, he immediately let go. But before I could get the chance to ask what he meant; he’d already fallen into a catatonic state.

“What did he say?” Jane asked.

“That we should hurry,” I lied. “Keep moving.”

Moving our way back outside, we stumbled across the bear mother and her three cubs, still unconscious in a restless slumber.

“Weren’t there five cubs?” Jane pointed out.

“There was,” I responded, pulling the gun from my holster in preparation, but the cubs were nowhere to be found. From there, we progressed with care around each corner, constantly expecting an attack that never came.

Outside, we felt a gust of cold air wash over us, finally free of the humid warmth of the caves. I took a deep breath, quickly checking the pressure gauge on my hazmat suit. There was an ample amount of oxygen left, but I’d only been wearing it for a fraction of the time Jane had.

“You alright?” I asked.

Yeah, I’m—behind you!” she yelled, diving out of the way of a charging bear cub running straight at us.

It was a horrific sight to behold, finally seeing it in clear daylight—its skin lacking most of its fur, instead covered by a countless number of fibers that had dug their way through its skin so many times that the organs had dropped from its abdomen. I fired a couple of shots at the poor thing, hitting it once in its right shoulder, and once in its head. Though it mostly incapacitated the animal, it wasn’t dead. It still attempted to drag its way towards us, clearly slowed down by the brain injury, but refusing to cease its chase.

But having mostly eliminated the most current threat, we took the opportunity to flee the scene, and headed back towards the field lab. Once we got within earshot of the site, we could hear the frantic screams coming from what remained of the crew. We pushed our way through the dense vegetation to find Gerard on the ground, trying to fight off the second missing cub while Pearson and Mark were hitting it with whatever solid object they could get their hands on. Jane pulled the knife from my belt swiftly enough that I couldn’t even think to react, and charged at the creature without hesitation, slashing and stabbing at it until it dropped Gerard and redirected its attention towards her.

As soon as the crew was gone from my line of sight, I fired three rounds at it, hitting each time. Again, it only slowed the creature down, but enough so that Jane could cut it free from each its attached cords, which significantly weakened it even further. With a final shot to the head, it fell dead to the ground, the remaining filaments turning gray.

Now that we had a few moments to recover, the crew quickly tended to their wounded colleague. Gerard’s arms and torso were covered in deep lacerations, which had already been infected by the organism. Noting his poor state, I warned the rest of them not to touch them, an order they reluctantly heeded.

“Has anyone else been wounded?” I asked, still not sure how far I would have to go to contain the infection.

Pearson and Bill both shook their heads, and Jane hadn’t once been in physical contact with the bear. The only one who’d gotten infected was Gerard. Based on what little we’d seen from the other victims, there was nothing we could do for him.

“I’ll patch myself up, just give me the damn medical kit,” Gerard begged, a plea Jane quickly answered.

I then took the phone back from Pearson and called my supervisor back at the company. Letting it beep no more than two times, someone on the other end picked up.

“Do you have information for us?” a voice asked, coming from a woman I had yet to put a name to, even after several years on the job.

“Unspecified organism. It’s parasitic in nature and seems to maintain motor control as well as limited cognitive function over its prey. Rate of spread is rapid. We’re undoubtedly dealing with a category five situation.”

“Confirmed. We’ve received the biological samples. The subject you’re dealing with is the Crimson Nexus.”

“So, you’ve dealt with this before?”

“We’ve had encounters in Siberia and Mexico. How far has the subject spread?”

“It’s still confined within the boundaries of the forest. What course of action do you suggest I take?”

“Evacuation. Levelling measures will be taken within ninety minutes.”

Knowing how deep the Crimson Nexus stretched underground, I knew their idea of containment would be insufficient, only serving to mask the problem for a time.

“I disagree. We need to find the source of the organism before we attempt to destroy it.”

“You have ninety minutes to leave the area. Is that understood?” she went on, ignoring what the company would consider insubordination, as she had on many occasions before. Knowing I could do nothing to change their minds, all that was left was to follow their orders.

“Understood,” I meekly replied. “What am I supposed to do with the people already infected?”

“Dispose of them.”

Still holding the phone to my ear, I glanced over at Gerard lying on the side, recalling that we had also left a man back at the caves. I had known their chances of survival were as good as non-existent, but I didn’t feel confident I could execute anyone in front of their friends and colleagues.

“I need you to confirm that you understand the order,” the woman went on.

“I understand.”

Ending the call on that note, I turned to the rest of the crew, who’d only heard my end of the conversation, but the look on my face sufficed to convey the hopelessness of the situation.

“I’m screwed, aren’t I?” Gerard asked.

“What’s the plan?” Pearson chimed in.

I knew then that the humane thing to do would be to put a quick end to Gerard's misery with a bullet to his head, I also realized that in his current state he could easily be left behind as the company dealt with the threat. But to answer Doctor Pearson’s question, there was only one thing we absolutely had to do.
