About a day and a half has passed since my [first update](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15uqxxq/im_exploring_an_abandoned_mall_with_a/), and I've discovered that this mall has very strange properties, so I'll just write them all down below in a rule format, just like the text message we'd recieved yesterday. Keep in mind, this update will be a bit more brief than the last one.

**1.** The ceiling tiles are indestructible. They can't be knocked down or pushed upwards so even the strongest blows that we dealt to them couldn't even leave a dent.

**2.** The walls regenerate. We somehow found an old-looking gray Volkswagen Beetle in the mall a few hours ago and Avery drove it straight towards a cracked, fragile-looking wall. The car crashed, making a large dent. Avery was, for some reason, sitting right next to the site of the crash on a dirty porcelain tile. She has no recollection of getting out of the car and sitting down. By the time Avery came to her senses, the vehicle was gone, and the wall's dent and cracks had dissapeared. It was like we'd done nothing at all.

**3.** The text messages with rules are all completely legitimate. Right after writing my last post, a skinny, pale, yellowish claw emerged from one of the cracked tiles and tried to grab Sam. Jack tried to slice it off with his rusty machete, but, again, nothing worked. We haven't seen a human hand come out of the tiles. I don't know who wrote or sent us these rules. I don't know how they know our phone numbers. I've tried talking to Jack about it, but he would constantly dodge the question. He knows something about the sender, no doubt, but he just refuses to answer. Sam and Hailey told me that they were hired only a couple of months ago, so they wouldn't know anything.

**4.** Clocks are frozen here. Every single one has been stuck at 4:44 AM ever since we entered this godforsaken place, even though I specifically remember entering Illimitata at 2:50 PM on the dot. This includes clocks in phones, laptops, cameras and even clocks inside of the mall itself. 4:44 AM. I can't keep track of time. I feel like I'm going insane.

**5.** Every single food item inside of the supermarket is perfectly preserved, except for non-perishables. Nothing ever rots. Meat, dairy, eggs, vegetables, you name it. Everything's fresh. However, the 5 kilo pack of rice that Jack brought was infested with mealworms. It was a horrific sight. Hundreds of thousands of wriggling, beige worms, crawling around and eating anything they can find. Same thing happened with Sophia's pack of chips.

**6.** Do not go into a Toys'R'Us, under any circumstances. It's completely dark in there. Cam stuck his hand out through the door and we watched it rapidly age and wither away. It decayed and fell on the floor, making a disgusting wet cracking sound and immediately turning into dust. I cannot stress this enough.

Cam's fine, but he refuses to approach retail stores now.

**7.** Don't go near the wallpaper. I know, wallpaper inside of a resort-themed mall sounds ridiculous, but it's there, and there's something on the other side of it. It has big, bulging, soulless eyes, and that same pale, yellow, rotting skin. It tried to attack Hailey, but Jack's machete actually worked this time, snapping its hand in half like a frail branch. It didn't have blood, veins or nerves. How is it even alive?

We recieved a few more text messages as well.

"*RULE 2: Only enter the Targets. Every other retail store is unsafe.*"

"*RULE 3: Throw away any non-perishables. The mealworms are not normal.*"

"*RULE 4: There is no escape. I've been here for 30 years.*"

"*My name is Tom. I've been following your group for a while. Jack shouldn't have returned.*"

*Thirty years*. I'll interrogate Jack and document everything here.

**ME:** Hey, Jack.

**JACK:** Yeah?

**ME:** Do you know who Tom is?

**JACK:** I... H-Hey, we need to gather more resources, don't we?

**ME:** No, we don't. We have everything we need at hand. Quit dodging the question.

**JACK:** ...How about ya check on Cameron? Phantom pains are irritatin', ain't they? Make sure he gets used to them.

**ME:** Answer my question.

**JACK:** Goddamnit, fine! Thomas and I... We used to know each other. He used to work for me, like Sam does now. There were a few more people with him. Ruby, Matt and Dan. I sent them out for a team ghosthunting mission and... and they never returned. I swear to God, I had no idea this would've happened to 'em!

**ME:** Why didn't you just tell us earlier!? And why the *fuck* did you drag us to this mall if you knew your coworkers went missing after going inside!? You're insane!

I took a few steps back, each step echoing throughout the seemingly empty complex.

**JACK:** Listen, *listen*! I just... I went back to go look for 'em! Their family blamed it all on me, and the guilt was just buildin' up... I couldn't take it anymore. So I decided to drag you along, I figured I wouldn't find anyone all on my own. I'm... so sorry.

**ME:** You're a terrible person, Jack.

**JACK:** I know. I didn't know how I'd redeem myself, y'know? I'm... I'm such an idiot.

I thought that Jack was our hope, our leader, our shining star in this desolate, empty abyss. Turns out he knowingly led us to our doom. What do we even do anymore?
