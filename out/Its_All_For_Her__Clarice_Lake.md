Chapter 1 ~ Mark

I turn on my phone and open the app bumble. I’m not much of a relationship type of guy, but it’s always a little fun and exciting to go on dating apps every now and then. After all I have to keep adding names to my list. As soon as I open the app I see a girl named Daisy. She has blue eyes and ginger red hair. It seems like she loves art because of the pictures she posted on her bumble profile. A minute or two pass of viewing her profile and I swipe left. Immediately after swiping left, I get a notification on top saying “you might have missed a potential match”. Even though I swiped left, I felt a little bummed out, after all, I missed a chance to hear her cries and screams. 


Another girl appears. She immediately catches my attention and I start checking  out her profile. It’s her. It’s Stella Simmons. The girl I’ve been keeping an eye on for a while now. “I honestly don’t even know why I bother checking her profile” I say chuckling. As soon as I laid eyes on her weeks ago at the grocery store I knew she was going to be another girl on my list. From waking up in the  morning, to going to sleep at night, she was on my mind 24/7. I had to have her is all I can think of after that day. Her coffee brown eyes, her beautiful curly black hair, everything about her was perfect. I wasted no time and swiped right. “Congratulations, you found a new match” the app rewards me. I feel a swarm of butterflies in my stomach fluttering around. I close bumble and press the power button on my phone but quickly gets turned on by a notification. I unlock my  phone to read the notification that says “Stella Simmons sent you a message”. I immediately tap on the notification and read her 
message.



Stella: Hii. 

A smile that’s goes from the end of one ear to the other appears. “I finally managed to get her attention” I whispered. 

I waste no time replying back. 

Mark: Hey, how are you doing?
 
Immediately after pressing send I try my best to calm myself down. One wrong move and It’s all over. I would be failing to write her name on my list, and I simply can’t let that happen. She replied as quick as I did. 

Stella: I’ve been in a dark place for a while now. I’m hoping that meeting new people will bring some life back into me. 

Mark: I’m sorry to hear that, really I am. I know we just met and started talking but if you ever need someone to talk to I’m here. 

To her we just met, but to me, I’ve been knowing her for a couple of weeks already. 


Stella: Thank you, I appreciate that I really do.

We continued texting for a while but she ended our conversation with a message that made me believe I had her exactly where I wanted her.

Stella: I would love to continue this conversation but I have to get going. Heres my phone number if that’s an easier way to contact me. 

She gave me her number and I immediately put her on my contacts.
