So this story is from 2017, I was in my first year of university and dating a guy who was emotionally abusive but also I was his first girlfriend so I tried to assume his mistakes on lack of experience (that's nonsense I know it now)
Anyway, one day he confronted me about his best mate, a blonde guy who was completely his opposite (my boyfriend was a brunette who looked like harry potter and his friend looked like Jude Law lol) 
the confrontation was about that friend texting him, telling him 'Your girlfriend is not a good girl' first of all wtf? Second of all, my boyfriend had been suspicious of me and that guy because I knew that guy first (and no I never dated that guy nor had been intimidate with the blonde guy. 
We just met each other on our first day of coming to the uni and hit it off and were friendly but my flat mates told me he was a player so I completely ghosted him) 

back to the main story, my boyfriend did confront me but as if my truth didn't matter since his assumptions and the male validation from that friend were more important to him, I was met with more suspicions until I decided that I had enough and planned to break up with him.

Mind you, I'm neurodivergent and back then I wasn't diagnosed so when I go non-verbal during arguments or feel injustice, I really can't pull myself out of that and start talking again. 

My boyfriend took me to the woods in the middle of the day and we started walking around and the entire time I've been repeating every dialogue I wanted to have in my head, it was mentally exhausting cause I wanted to say them all out loud but couldn't. 
We finally reached a place where there was a tiny river and he finally talked to me. All of a sudden this boy who was always soft spoken and well mannered was saying the most cruel things to me. 

Like right when I thought if he asks a question finally I can open my mouth and talk, he started saying the most bizarre things I never thought a person could say. (It included how he feels about us being eachother's first sexual partners and crap about guilt of taking away my virginity as if this is the victorian era) 
anyway, I was too shocked that in that moment I just felt like somebody poured a bucket of ice over my head but at the same time felt feverish. After that conversation or rather, his monologue, I took off the ring we had as a matching ring and threw it in the water.

Mind you, he was standing right in front of me and when I looked up at him and saw the look on his face, my brain just went 'yup, you're about to be murdered in the woods and nobody will ever find your body' 
stupidly enough, in my panicked state, I tried to find my ring from the ground idk why, maybe I just wanted to undo what I did in the woods to save myself and get to safety first? Maybe because I just realised how stupid it was of me to agree to coming to the woods with him? 
I feel like in that moment I genuinely believed he could've had other motives for bringing me to the woods because he did the same thing on my birthday a few months prior and made me give him a bj in the woods and my 'no' held little to no power there because I couldn't escape.

So after I found the ring, I wanted to apologize to him so I could at least get on his 'good side' and get to safety first. (The area I'm talking about is in a very green city full of woods and mountains and we were literally in the highest location which was the end of the city and would lead to literal deserts.

Before I could even say a word, he grabbed me by the neck and was squeezing. Of course I tried to free myself, yelling and pulling on his wrists and everything and I was too panicked to call for help because I knew nobody else was there aside from us.
but as soon as I looked over his shoulder, there was a figure in all black, no face, nothing I could call 'clothing', just peeping out of a tree like 200 meters away
And I swear my body went so rigid my boyfriend at the time thought something horrible happened and finally stopped choking me. I was so scared that I couldn't scream. 
He turned around to see what I saw but there was nothing. 
There was a literal man coming out from behind a tree and went right back and disappeared. 
I know what I saw wasn't human but in that moment my brain tried everything to convince me that it was. 
I told myself maybe it was a hunter, but the police station was like 2 minutes away and in here you can't just go out and hunt in city areas like that. 
I told myself maybe it was a person who probably was harmless or even if they were harmful, they saw there were two of us and tried to hide themselves again but there was no face!! 
Nothing I could make out in that shadow. It was just a black shadowy figure. Whatever that thing was, saved my life accidentally but everything in that relationship went down hill after that. 
I dropped out two years after that, just to get out of that city, after being SAed by two different people and many other things happening to me.
Also whole city was full of these 'shadow people' and no, I was never on meth or any other drugs when I saw them in the woods during daylight or at nights.

Maybe a question at the end? Do these shadow people come with any explanation on what they are? Is there any lore behind them?
