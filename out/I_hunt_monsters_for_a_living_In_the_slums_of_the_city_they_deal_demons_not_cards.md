[Encounter 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13lje96/i_exorcise_spirits_for_a_living_be_confident_or/)

My name is Matt Attager. I’m somewhat of a hitman for the criminal underworld. I get paid to seek out and kill potential enemies, rivals, and people of notable interest. But see, this isn’t my main job.

I hunt monsters. Whether they are human or something other.

I was born into a family of monster hunters, descended from a lineage of great hunters, killers, heroes and villains.

My nature is thus, that of a hunter. There’s a family handbook somewhere that has nearly every single monster documented, their behaviors, weaknesses, strengths. 

But for the most part, hunting for monsters pays well. There’s clients that want a specific creature located and killed. These clients are mostly rich men with a taste for the rare and bizarre.

Perhaps one wanted the blood of a Unicorn. These creatures were nearly extinct, and viciously carnivorous, but it was said they brang ‘potency’ and ‘intelligence’ to those who grounded it up and ate it.

I highly doubted the veracity of these claims. 

My latest request came from a client I hated to deal with. A multi-city crime boss who thought the world belonged to him. “Listen here, Matt,” he snapped. “I’ve got work for you.”

I sighed. “Again? I just procured Athasca Herb for you,” I protested. That particular herb I had to travel the world for, especially when I couldn’t quickly source it.

He silenced me. “Someone’s stealing my business, chum.” I hated when he said that. Something about the word just did not sit right with me. “I don’t know who the hell is taking my clients away from me- but I suspect it’s one of those other gangs or maybe-” he paused, thinking, “-lizardmen I’ve heard about.”

What was he talking about? “Okay, first of all,” I pointed out, “you can’t call the Stetski ‘lizardmen’- that’s racist. Number two- I’ve made it a point that I don’t interfere with the Stetski,” I explained.

A couple bad and good experiences with the Serpentheads had really soured my taste for dealing with them.

“Fine, fine, whatever,” the client bemoaned. “But only I’m supposed to be offering devil deals, chum,” he repeated. “And this client is taking them away.”

My client was Marcus Law the Fourth. I had to say the fourth whenever we greeted him or he would get really mad.

What he meant by devil deals was the fact that he had entered a partnership with a low-level demon. Anthem City was right on the border between countries, and thus came with a lot of people looking for a living, a new life in America.

Marcus Law (the Fourth) and his gang ruled the city’s underbelly. He offered the poorest of migrants contracts. Perhaps the soul of a caring father could be exchanged for a modest home, or a piece of heart could be traded off for a ride to the kinder, friendlier Kasden City.

“How are your deals being taken away?” I asked.

He had one of the two men with him open a briefcase, revealing, behind enchanted, protected glass- cards. “Cards from the Codex of Agnes Florette.”

Ah. This was a new layer of disturbing.

Agnes Florette, to my knowledge, had been a heretic active sometime in early colonial America. As such, she was both impaled and burned at the stake, though not by cursing an entire town to share the same fate.

I remembered reading about her in the family bestiary.

She pushed the agenda of some new religion, a mystery cult the book hadn’t really dwelt on. She worshiped the Whale, some great and powerful god that supposedly brought life and death to the world.

Like I said, heretic. But she left several large books- Codexes filled with pictures of strange and unusual beings. These pictures were the size of cards.

It was said offering up blood to these demons would bring one fortune- for the price of a tiny piece of self.

Marcus continued to speak as the pictures behind the Silverback Glass swirled and snarled. “I found these off of several clients that canceled on me. These families were supposed to be poor- but when I tracked them down, there they were, in lofty homes and penthouses.”

I studied the artifact. “So someone out there has a codex.” Florette’s massive, hand-written collections were infamous for their sheer power, each individual page or picture containing a demon or spirit, sealed away.

Marcus’ face twirled. “So I want you to kill this person.”

We discussed how much I would be paid. An acceptable offer was reached. “It’s a deal,” I concluded.

He brought out a piece of old, bloodstained paper. “Shall we sign it onto a contract?”

I shook my head. Spiritually binding contracts were not my thing. “Never.”

He nodded and folded it away into his pants pocket. I informed him I needed a weapon, and he sent one of his many men over to find me one. The weapon I got was one I was a bit unfamiliar with, but useful all the same.

A sniper rifle, a sleek black and glowing with lines of ancient symbols enchanting the weapon. I held the bullets out in my hand, feeling their power.

Now, I was never one to mind my enchantments, but I sure recognized the power cast into the weapon. These bullets were even dipped into holy oil, and padded with salt, in case our dealer friend was a bit more nightmarish than expected.

I asked Marcus’ people if they had leads. They had none.

I would have to track down the new salesman myself. And to do that I needed someone carefully attuned to the world of magic, to the world beyond our eyes. Sure, I could hunt monsters, know where to strike- but I was simply not born with the gift to seek out new things or the mind to enchant.

But I had a good friend, one whom I’d called a while back to meet me in the city. “Aster!”

A short, short-cut woman turned swiftly from an ice-cream truck, vanilla delight in her hands. “Matt!” she shouted, running over, tossing the bored looking teenager at the counter some coin. “Ice cream’s here wonderful.”

I bought some, and we sat down at a fountain surrounded by ducks, and spoke. We told our stories on the road, our misadventures with the odd and bizarre. Aster had found herself in the midst of a storm of soul-sucking, fluffy dandelions and I told her of my latest client.

“A Florette Codex,” she realized, thinking to herself when I mentioned it. “That could explain the disturbance.”

I looked at her, confused. “What disturbance?”

Aster reached out into the ether, eyes going blank. “An object of great dissonance in the city,” she assured, “not entirely one, but not entirely separate. Thousands of spirits locked into pictures and into something greater.”

“The Florette Codex,” I inferred. “Where is it?”

Aster reached further, seeking the real-world location of the dissonance. “The one who has the book’s a few blocks away!” she shouted, strangely hesitant. “He’s something special too- but I just can’t place it.”

She returned back to the real world, and nodded to me. “What’s special about him?” Aster shook her head; the information was hidden away.

Now, see, I understood that being a hitman wasn’t exactly the most moral of jobs. But I had a little rule for myself, see, I would only strike for the best of the city. So if this new dealer was cutting less years or soul-pieces out- I’d spare him instead.

“I want the book,” Aster decided, as we got up to chase the dealer. The sunset over us, and a wave of darkness followed. I asked her why. “It’s a collection of spirits- I would very much love to study that.”

“Fair,” I decided, as we neared the source. Aster pointed at a man across the street, making his way to an alley.

He stopped there, and when we realized he wasn’t going anywhere I set up shop in an old, abandoned building that had long rotted away. My rifle was aimed directly at him, and I waited to see what he would do next.

The man in the alley started to smoke.

It was not a cigarette, by the piercing smell, but something else, more well refined, made from the eye-opening herb of Athusca and intermixed with the concentration powder of Lionroot Horn.

I prepared my finger on the trigger. The man in the alley was approached by a family of four.

I hesitated. There were two children. No need to expose them to violence- or were they the terms of the deal?

He revealed a book from under a coat. He opened the book. Each small, cardlike frame in its pages had the painting of something beyond. Faces, bodies, ideas moving and twisting in the paint, living a whole other life. The man in the corner, the dark suited, black coat man, offered up the book.

He spoke something indistinct, and let out a knife and a piece of mottled paper- a contract. This was not good, much more binding that the quick one-off deals Marcus’ gang made.

“Don’t shoot!” Aster suddenly warned. “I’ll convince them not to take it!” And she reached her hand out and into the mind of the father. I saw him hesitate, stammer, back off, and then leave.

This was when the dealer looked up, directly into my eyes. This startled me, and in my panic- I fired.

He was gone, up into a cloud of ash and shadow. And suddenly I felt a presence in the dirty room with us, and I and Asher looked up to see the man there. Black suit with a white tie, and a sleek, dark coat.

He studied us, eyes softly glowing as he did. We froze there, until he tipped his hat at us and spoke, “Interesting- an Attager,” he looked at me, “and a Canary-” Aster made a face, “er, Psychic, working together”

“You have a problem with that?” Aster pointed out. “Weren’t you just about to convince a man to give up his soul for what? Riches?”

The odd man seemed amused by Aster. “No, no, I do not,” he answered. “A sign of better times, it is. It wasn’t that long ago your kind-” he gestured to me, “were killing her kind because they spoke to spirits.” He pondered, walking back and forth. “I believe it was your great-great-great-great-great ancestor who called them heretics.”

I pointed my gun up at him. “And who exactly are you?”

He shrugged and sat down with us, criss-crossed. “I am a nobody. A mere dealer of the divine, a mere salesman, just a-”

Aster knew who he was, instantly. “You’re the Night-Merchant!” she seemed both terrified and amazed.

I knew some semblance of who he was. A wandering, immortal salesman, dealing out terrifying deals. Powerful artifacts for souls. Riches and glory for memories. All things that had granted those who accepted power- that inevitably lead to their own destruction.

“I have been called many things,” he mused, “and that is one.”

I raised and prepared to shoot, to end the threat once and for all. “Don’t!” Aster ordered. “He does no harm to us as long as we don’t accept a deal.”

“He’s harmed others,” I countered, reminding Aster many had died at the hands of Night-Merchant’s whims.

The man in question shrugged. “This is true, you know.”

Aster frowned, recognizing that it, in fact, was true. “He’s a necessary evil,” Aster decided. “There will always be more versions of the Night-Merchant down the road.” She sighed, and went on. “And by Night-Merchant standards, this one isn’t all too bad.”

I trusted Aster with my life and lowered the weapon. “Will you leave the city?” I asked, pleading. “I don’t want people falling for your lies.”

“I suppose so,” the man agreed. “I can tell you want something more,” he stressed. “You’re not just a hitman- you’re someone else.”

“I used to deal in the artifact black market,” I confessed.

The Night-Merchant reached into my mind. “No, something deeper than that- you truly care for people,” he reached, “you don’t want these people hurt. Perhaps I can offer you-”

“A deal?” I snapped. “No thanks.”

He sighed, closing the codex. “If you really want what’s best for the people here, perhaps go to the root of the problem.”

Was it Marcus, I thought- was he the problem these people just had to sign their souls over for a better life? No, this ran deeper, far into the heart of the city where the rich rose higher above the backs of the people.

I thought on this as he spoke to Aster, “And you, would you like a deal?”

“I’d like the Codex,” she put forth. “I’ll trade you a soul for the book.”

I looked at my friend in confusion. The merchant offered up a paper, and a knife, and she signed it in blood. “Good, now, your soul?”

She smirked, reached into a pocket and found a familiar looking cursed skull I remembered we’d dug out of the sands of the east. The merchant looked amused. “What?” she laughed. “Didn’t say it had to be my soul.”

The Night-Merchant simply smiled and took it, outsmarted. “Very well,” he mused, handing over the book. “You have outsmarted the Merchant. Perhaps another time I will have your soul.”

Aster shrugged. “I’m sure we’ll meet again.”

I suddenly realized the root of the problem, right then and there as I stared into the heart of the city. “The Mayor!” I realized. I turned to the Night-Merchant. “Maybe you should offer him a deal before you leave.”

The city reeked of corruption. I was sure the Mayor’s corruption had ties to both citizens and new migrants alike.

“Perhaps I will,” the Night-Merchant concluded, rising to his feet. “Let’s meet again, perhaps.” And with that he vanished into shadow and ash, leaving an excited Aster with the codex and me with a job well-done.

We sat back down for a while and just stared up into the city.

“Don’t you get tired of this?” I asked, after we’d stared a long while. She asked me what I meant. “The traveling, the odd jobs we do,” I clarified. “You go around exorcizing spirits and the like.”

She looked at me. “And you go around hunting monsters and people,” she argued. “People like us don’t just settle into normal life, no, not after what happened at the House.”

The events of the House shook me. The Company and those who policed the artifact black market were still very much after us. “Not like we can do anything about it.”

“But I like it,” Aster spoke. “I like the weirdness of our world. The spirits I see, the strange people we meet.” We stood and began to walk back to our hotel then. “Why we blinded ourselves to the weird world I don’t think we’ll ever know.”

“We convinced ourselves the bizarre never existed,” I finished. “And it worked.”

She shrugged. “Then why do some of us still see? Why do they still live?”

I pondered on the weird world. I remembered an incident a couple months ago. “You know, the fairies are still going extinct.” The civilized, industrialized world brought iron and steel, annihilating the free folk. “Maybe we killed them all.”

I think we settled on that, and we just simply walked, up until we were in the hotel lobby. We both knew we were going to part the next day, resume our journeys, confuse our pursuers and take new jobs.

But we’d meet again. We always arranged a meeting. “Where are you headed next?”

Aster had an answer. “There’s an island I want to visit. I met with a friend of a friend the other day who’s well versed in the illegal cryptid trade.” Neither of us were familiar with that. “She says the bones of the Divine Whale have started to wash up there.”

“So why do you want it?” I inquired. “What’s so special about magic bones? We used to sell those all the time.”

“According to legend,” she spoke, unhurried, “the Divine Whale is the one who brought all the magic little things to life.”

So she told me about the whale. And we parted ways the next day. I was sick of the city, and journeyed on to hill country, on the trail of a beast that had been rumored to be the death of many- as well as a hoard of treasures it guarded.

A story for another day.
