That was only the first night.

When the sun rose, I was still staring at the ceiling, sheets tangled around me, sleep never having come. Ethan stirred beside me, rolling over slowly.

“Good morning, love,” he murmured in that low, gritty morning voice.

“Morning,” I replied, looking into his hazel eyes. Beautiful, steady—but my mind kept circling back to Lucas in the hallway.

“How did you sleep?” I asked, rubbing my fingers along Ethan’s shoulder, hoping to keep the conversation away from me.

“Like a baby,” he said, pulling me into his chest. His heartbeat thudded steady against my ear, and for a moment, I almost forgot where I was.

We lay there in silence until he started telling me about a dream he’d had—a silver fox, darting through trees, always just out of reach. I only half-listened, drifting in and out of his words, until the knock came.

The door cracked open, and the smell hit before the voice—potatoes, eggs, cinnamon, rich and heavy in the air. Lucas’s head appeared in the doorway, blindfold in place, facing us directly.

“Mom says to come eat before your food gets cold. Hope you like hash browns,” he said, lingering in the frame.

Ethan groaned, rolling his eyes. Lucas grinned at the reaction.
“What? It’s not like I can see—or smell—how naked you two are. Stop acting like a brat. Maybe a full stomach will calm you down.”

Then he slipped away, leaving the door half-open behind him.

Ethan dressed with a sharp, irritated motion, muttering under his breath. I followed, but my thoughts stayed tangled on Lucas. How had he known? The smell of our bodies under the covers? The heat? And why did Ethan never push back? I’d seen him snap at far less, but around his brother, he just… endured.

In the kitchen, Mary moved with ease, her apron dusted with flour. The air was thick with butter and grease. Ethan’s father sat sunk into the couch, eyes glued to a National Geographic special on moonshiners. Lucas lounged across from him, head tilted, listening closely to every word from the television like he could see the program through sound alone.

I couldn’t hold it anymore. The question burned a hole in my chest.
“So what happened… to—”

I stopped myself, but it was too late.

All three of them turned.

Ethan stiffened. Mary’s smile faltered. Even the father’s eyes, dull moments ago, lifted toward me with sharpness.

And Lucas—Lucas’s lips curved slow.
“My eyes? Was that what you wanted to ask?”

Before I could answer, he rose. Not rushed, not clumsy. Every movement was deliberate. He walked toward me with slow, predatory grace, the morning sun spilling across his painted, muscled figure. My breath hitched.

Ethan stepped between us, shoulders squared.
“That’s not something to discuss at breakfast,” he said firmly, holding Lucas’s gaze.

Lucas smirked. “She asked. You know I don’t drop things just because they’re uncomfortable. That’s rude.”

The tension stretched like wire.

Then, without hurry, the father rose from the couch. He laid one heavy hand on Lucas’s shoulder. His voice was deep, carved with authority.
“That’s enough. Don’t scare our new… edition to the family.”

The word snagged in my chest. Edition?

Ethan pulled me toward the table, sliding out a chair with forced calm.
“Don’t read into that. He just means because you’re with me now. Staying here.”

Lucas’s bandages were clean today, stark white against his skin. He sat across from me, leaning forward, chin propped on his hands. His scent carried across the table—pine, cedar, something earthy beneath. It made my pulse stumble.

“How long are you planning on staying?” he asked.

I froze, throat dry.

“As long as she wants,” Ethan answered sharply, through his teeth. Mary set plates down between us—steak and eggs, still sizzling.

Lucas’s smirk widened. “And how long is that? Last time, you said that you never really planned on leaving.” He carved into his steak, chewing with slow satisfaction, the flex of his jaw catching the light.

“That’s different,” Ethan said, his voice unsteady. “I wasn’t serious before. But I have plans with Emmy. Living here forever isn’t one of them.”

“You’ve been looking into a home?” Mary asked, settling across from us.

“Not yet. Buying’s expensive,” Ethan admitted.

“You’re not planning to rent, are you?” his father said, eyes drilling into him, dissecting every word.

“I mean… it wouldn’t hurt. It could teach me budgeting. Something like that.”

His father considered it, expression unreadable. He cut into his food and finally said, “Renting might cost you more than buying in the long run. We’ve told you this before. I won’t repeat myself. But you’d be better off staying here until you can afford a home of your own. Privacy isn’t worth bankruptcy.”

Lucas interrupted, voice sliding in like a blade.
“I feel like there’s more to it than privacy.”

And just like that, the air in the room changed.


“W-what do you mean? Of course this is about privacy!” Ethan’s voice cracked as he tried to hold steady.

“I-I just want us to be happy. Build a life together. That’s not wrong to ask for, is it?”

I placed my hand over his, and he squeezed it tightly, almost desperate.

Lucas laughed, low and sharp. “I bet you’re just saying that to cover up something more… like you’re embarrassed of us. Or maybe because—”

Their father’s fist slammed against the table. The sound shook the room, silverware rattling on plates. My whole body flinched. Everyone froze—except Lucas, who just smirked.

“That’s enough,” his father said, voice iron. “We are not dragging family quarrels to the table. Now eat. And let’s talk about something else. You’re staying here until you can afford a home. And you”—his gaze bore into Lucas—“are going to stop antagonizing your brother and his girlfriend. Am I clear?”

Ethan nodded, shrinking back like a scolded child. I nodded too, as if the reprimand included me.

Lucas leaned back, grinning wide. “You’re the boss.” He shoveled food into his mouth, chewing like nothing had happened.

The rest of the meal passed in strained silence. Plates emptied quickly, chairs scraping as people excused themselves. Ethan rose first.
“I need to get ready for work.”

“It’s the weekend,” Lucas said flatly, standing to help his mother clear the table.

Ethan froze mid-step, eyes wide. “I—it’s for… overtime.”

The word hung in the air, absurd and fragile.

Everyone looked at him with mild confusion. Even me. Ethan’s job didn’t offer overtime. I’d never once heard him mention it. But no one pressed him. Not his parents. Not Lucas. They just let him go, as if silence was part of the ritual.

I didn’t want to sit alone in that kitchen with strangers who seemed to know more than they said, so I followed him upstairs. Lucas watched me go, head turning slightly, before drifting back toward the garage.

In the guest room, I found Ethan tugging on a button-down shirt, stuffing his laptop into a bag.

“What was that all about?” I asked.

“It’s nothing,” he muttered, his back to me. “I just want you to feel comfortable. My family can be… too much sometimes. The last thing I want is for you to feel any type of way about what they said.”

I wanted to believe him. But the word edition, Lucas’s taunts, the way the whole family snapped to silence at the mention of his eyes—it all coiled in my chest. Their bond felt too close, too practiced. Healthier than my own family in ways, maybe. But also… wrong. A harmony rehearsed to hide dissonance.

“Look,” Ethan said, crossing the room to press a quick kiss to my forehead. “I’ll be back around eight. Just… stay here.”

And then he was gone, rushing out the door with his bag slung at his side.

I sat on the bed, staring at the walls, wondering what they were hiding. Wondering what really happened to Lucas’s eyes.

And wondering why I couldn’t stop wanting to find out.

Hours passed. I hadn’t left the guest room. I sat on the edge of the bed, knees tucked in, listening to the sounds of the house: a television murmuring downstairs, footsteps creaking across the floor, the faint clang of dishes being washed. I kept telling myself I’d go get water, or at least stretch my legs, but something pinned me there—half fear, half curiosity.

Then came the knock.

Not a polite tap. Two heavy, measured knocks that made the wood vibrate beneath my fingertips.

I hesitated.

And then I heard his voice.
“M-n-M…You hungry?”

I froze, every nerve standing on end. Slowly, I turned the knob and opened the door.

Lucas stood there shirtless, as always. The bandage wrapped across his eyes was freshly tied, white fabric already smudged with faint stains. In his hands, he held a plate—a sandwich cut diagonally, tortilla chips stuffed inside. Nacho cheese dust clung to the bread.

“I made you lunch,” he said, his smile too easy, too casual, like we were old friends.

I stared at the sandwich, then at him.
“…Thanks.”

“Don’t mention it. Can I come in?”

Everything in me wanted to say no. But curiosity flared, burning hotter than caution. I stepped back, opening the door wider. “Sure.”

He walked in without hesitation, moving like he could see every corner of the room. He set the plate on the nightstand, then sat at the edge of the bed, close enough that the heat from his skin pressed against me.

“So,” he said, tilting his head, “you want to know what happened to me.”

I didn’t answer, but my silence was enough.

He leaned back on his palms, his voice dropping low.
“It was an accident. A bar fight. I was out with friends, we had too much to drink. Some asshole thought he could take me. He was arrogant. I was….stupid, and cocky.” He tapped the bandage with one finger. “He gouged my eyes. Thought that would end it. But it didn’t. I snapped his neck with my bare hands.”

He paused, smiling faintly. “Funny how quickly arrogance turns into desperation when you realize you’re fighting for your life.”

I swallowed hard, staring at him. He told it so calmly, like he was describing the weather.

“And that’s what everyone accepts?” I asked softly.

Lucas turned his face toward me, the fabric over his eyes pulling taut as he smirked.
“Yeah. That’s the story.”

Something in his tone made my skin prickle.

“But the truth?” I pressed, my voice barely a whisper.

For the first time, he didn’t answer immediately. He sat there, breathing slow, deliberate. Then he leaned forward, close enough that I could smell the mix of paint, turpentine, and cedar clinging to his skin.

“The truth,” he murmured, “is uglier.”

I held my breath.

He grinned. “Ask Ethan sometime. See if he tells you. If he doesn’t—well, maybe I will.”

The silence between us thickened, heavy, intimate. I felt caught in it—terrified, but unable to look away.

Finally, Lucas stood, brushing his hands on his jeans.
“You’re one of us now, Emmy. At least, you will be. That’s what this is all about.”

I blinked. “What do you mean?”

He tilted his head, smiling as if I’d asked the simplest question in the world.
“Family.”

He left the plate on the nightstand and slipped out the door.

I sat frozen, staring at the sandwich, my stomach knotted tight. The word family echoed in my skull.

But it didn’t sound like comfort. It sounded like a cage.

I didn’t touch the sandwich. I couldn’t. Not after the way Lucas left me with that word — family — hanging in the air like a curse.

I sat there for a long time, staring at the plate on the nightstand, staring at the faint orange chip dust marking the white bread, staring at the spot on the mattress where he had sat. The sheets were clean this morning. Now there was a smear of paint. A stroke of cobalt blue, streaked faintly across the quilt.

The sight of it sent a shiver through me. It wasn’t an accident. He wanted me to see it.

Just then The door burst open.

Ethan.

He froze when he saw me staring at the stain. His eyes flicked from the bed, to the untouched sandwich, to the door behind me where Lucas had slipped away only minutes ago.

“What the hell happened?” he demanded, voice sharper than I’d ever heard it.

“Nothing,” I stammered. “He—he brought me lunch, that’s all. I didn’t even—”

Ethan was across the room in two strides, snatching the plate off the nightstand and slamming it onto the dresser so hard the chips scattered. His hands trembled as he touched the paint on the quilt, rubbing it between his fingers like ash.

“He came in here?” His voice cracked, anger vibrating under the surface.

“He knocked,” I said quickly. “I… I let him in.”

Ethan’s jaw clenched. His hazel eyes weren’t warm now; they were dark, cold, coiled with something I’d never seen before. “You don’t let him in, Emmy. Ever.”

My chest tightened. “You’re scaring me. He just told me what happened—his accident, the bar fight, how he lost his—”

“Bullshit!” Ethan snapped, the word like a gunshot.

I flinched.

He ran a hand through his hair, pacing the room like a caged animal. “That story he tells? That’s not what happened. He likes to… embellish. Make himself sound like some kind of tragic hero. But he’s lying. He always lies.”

“Then what’s the truth?” I asked, voice shaking.

He stopped, his back to me. His shoulders tensed, rigid.
“The truth is,” he said slowly, “you don’t need to know.”

I stood, trembling. “Ethan—there’s paint on the bed. But,He didn’t touched me. He just—”

Ethan whirled on me, eyes blazing. “And that’s exactly what he wants! To worm his way in, to test boundaries, to see how far he can push until—” He bit the words off, fists clenching at his sides.

“Until what?” I asked

The silence roared between us. He forced a deep breath, pressing his palms to his face. When he lowered them, the mask was back — the calm, reassuring boyfriend. But I had seen what lived underneath.

“Emmy,” he said softly, stepping toward me, taking my hands in his, “he’s dangerous. He’s jealous. He’s sick. But he’s my brother, and he’s family. You have to trust me. Whatever he told you, forget it. Promise me.”

My throat closed. I wanted to believe him, but my eyes drifted back to the bed, to the smear of blue paint like a fingerprint, proof that Lucas had been here. Proof that something didn’t add up.

Ethan saw where I was looking. His jaw flexed again, and for just a moment, I thought he might tear the sheets from the bed in a frenzy. Instead, he kissed my forehead hard — too hard — and whispered, “I’ll handle him.”

And then he stormed out, the slam of the door rattling the walls.

I sat alone, the sandwich untouched, the smear of paint burning into my mind.

And I realized I hadn’t learned the truth at all. I’d only seen another mask.

The slam of our bedroom door hadn’t even finished echoing before I heard it — heavy footsteps down the hall, quick and furious.

Ethan.

I pressed my ear to the door.

He was already at the garage, voice sharp, rattling the walls.
“You don’t go into her room! You don’t touch her, you don’t feed her, you don’t—”

Lucas’s voice was low, lazy, but it carried.
“You don’t tell me what to do.”

A crash. Something hit the wall — maybe a fist, maybe a body.

I cracked the door open, heart pounding, and crept closer down the hall. I could see just enough through the sliver of light from the garage door — Ethan lunging, shoulders squared, his fist raised. Lucas not moving, standing tall with that damned bandage across his eyes.

Ethan swung, wild with rage—

—and Lucas caught his arm mid-air. Effortless.

The sound of it snapped through the house, Ethan’s breath breaking into a gasp as Lucas twisted his wrist back, forcing him down to one knee.

“Still predictable,” Lucas murmured.

“Shut up,” Ethan hissed, straining. “Don’t you dare ruin this for me—”

“For you?” Lucas laughed softly, leaning close. “You mean for us.”

Ethan wrenched himself free, stumbling back, his chest heaving. “You don’t get to talk about us. Not after—” He stopped.

Silence. The kind that felt like a noose tightening.

Lucas throw him back and  only smiled. “You’re still ashamed.”

“Keep her out of it,” Ethan said, voice breaking. “I swear to God—”

“You don’t swear to Him,” Lucas cut in, his words sudden and sharp. “We don’t do that here.”

The air thickened. I could barely breathe. My pulse hammered in my ears as I crouched in the shadows of the hallway, praying the floorboards didn’t betray me.

For a long moment, no one spoke.

Then their father’s voice cut through the tension, calm and final from the living room.
“Enough.”

I hadn’t even heard him move, but now he stood in the doorway, broad shoulders filling the frame. His presence shut everything down.

Ethan’s fists unclenched. Lucas stepped back, smirk still carved into his face.

Their father looked at both of them, then at the hallway — and for a moment, I swore his eyes flicked right to me.

I darted back into the guest room before he could confirm it, slamming the door and pressing my back against it.

My whole body shook.

I didn’t know what was worse: that Ethan had lost control, that Lucas seemed untouchable, or that their father had ended it all with just a word.

And somewhere beneath it all, one thing twisted deeper into me:
What did Lucas mean when he said we don’t swear to Him?

The next morning felt stranger than the last.

Mary had made pancakes, smiling too sweetly as she slid plates across the table. Ethan kept glancing at me like he was afraid I might say something, while Lucas lounged nearby, shirtless as always, humming under his breath.

Their father was dressed in a business blue suit, getting ready for something special 
I asked them “what’s the occasion?”

The father simply said “church..”as he grabbed his keys and the ready to go plate.
Mary followed behind taking off her apron and grabbed her purse 
“My husband is a very religious man. It’s what kept our family together.”

Before I could as more I saw Lucas put his finger over his lips as if to silent my inquiries 


Before I could ask about the day, the father’s voice cut across the room, heavy as stone:
“Don’t go in the garage.”

The words weren’t directed at anyone in particular. But his eyes pinned me, cold and deliberate.

I nodded quickly, the fork trembling in my hand.
“Of course. I wouldn’t.”

Mary smoothed the edge of her apron and smiled, too tight. Ethan squeezed my hand under the table. Lucas just smirked.

“Do…I get ready? Or..”

They all looked at me as if I grew two heads…then Lucas cut through the silence “Nah,” he said stepping between us and heading to the kitchen to get some water

“I don’t think you’re ready to see ole Frank give a sermon yet?” He poured himself a cup of water and squeezed a lemon despite his afflicted disability… I was just impressed than curious 

“Sermon?” I asked 
Ethan sighed”My father is a…I guess you would say a….religious leader” he stood up fixing his own suit….dressed in black and a blue tie

“You mean like…a priest.”

Lucas laughed at the idea”trust me, a priest is an understatement….he’s more like a…bishop” he took a gulp of water

The father stood proudly holding a book in his hand held to his chest…a book that looked like the Bible…but had no..writing on the cover

“And why aren’t you going?” I asked Lucas as I saw he wasn’t dressed up like them

“What do you mean” he said going towards his  kin before he could say anything the father put his hand on Lucas’s shoulder

“Because people ask too many questions…curiosity seems to be abundant nowadays”

Ethan adjusts his coat”can we get this over with now…”

“Patience boy…”the father said”you have enough time with her through the week for now be pious…earthly attachments isn’t something you should be holding onto right now.
And as for you….”he looked at me sternly. “like i said do not go in the garage…. That’s Lucas’s room. We will be back soon. We don’t need another reason to have a family feud like yesterday

Ethan looked down at the floor before the three of them left leaving me with the blinded Lucas who definitely didn’t need the babysitting 

After a long silence, I retreated to the guest room and sat on the bed, scrolling aimlessly through my phone. The screen’s glow felt hollow, a flimsy tether to the normal world outside this house. My thoughts twisted around themselves.

What were they all hiding?

I felt entitled to know by now. I’d been careful, polite, playing the good guest, the good girlfriend. But what if my mother was right? Was I in love with Ethan, or just distracting myself? Was he even the man I thought he was, or just another part of whatever strange theater his family was performing for me?

The questions gnawed, and the longer I stayed silent, the more I began to feel like the joke was on me.

Then I heard it.

Lucas’s footsteps, the shuffle of his bare feet across the floor. The creak of the garage door opening. Then the deliberate slam as he shut it behind him.

I held still, straining to hear more. When the silence returned, I slipped out of the room.

I drifted through the house. The furniture was tasteful, almost too tasteful — crystals on mantels, family photos in neat rows, trinkets in their proper places. Everything screamed normal, the kind of “modern home” from a catalog. Except for the paintings.

Those paintings.

The longer I looked, the more they warped in my eyes. Figures half-formed, limbs bent wrong, mouths stretched into shapes that could have been laughter or screams. Every time I thought I recognized someone — the slope of a jaw, the turn of a nose — the strokes twisted back into abstraction, as though mocking me for even trying.

I shivered and turned down the hall just in time to see Lucas step out of the garage.

He didn’t acknowledge me this time. Didn’t smirk, didn’t speak. Just walked straight past, into the restroom. The fan clicked on. Water ran.

I turned back to the garage.

The door.

For the first time since I’d been here, it wasn’t closed. It sat cracked, a slim line of shadow spilling out across the floor. The smell drifted through — paint, turpentine, and something metallic beneath.

Lucas never left it open. Not once in the two, three days I’d been here. He always shut it, locked it away like a secret project.

My stomach twisted. My curiosity burned.

It felt less like an accident and more like… an invitation.

Before I knew it, I was already moving toward it. My hand stretched out, fingers brushing the cool metal.

I glanced back down the hall. The bathroom door was closed, the fan still humming.

I should’ve turned back. I should’ve listened to the warnings.

But my hand was already on the knob, pulling it open.


The garage was dim, lit only by a single bulb swaying faintly from the ceiling. Its glow rocked back and forth, carving the room into slices of shadow and light.

Canvases leaned against the walls — dozens of them. Some wrapped in sheets, some half-finished, some massive and raw. The air was thick with turpentine, linseed oil, and something faintly metallic that caught in the back of my throat.

I stepped carefully, my footfalls muffled by drop cloths spattered with every color imaginable. My eyes caught on the largest canvas at the far end.

It was unfinished.

A Renaissance-style composition, rich with detail, shadows painted deep, colors so vivid they almost glowed. At first glance, I thought it was some grand allegory — biblical, mythic. But the longer I stared, the more the figures sharpened, and the bile began to rise.

Lucas was painted sprawled on the floor, his hands covering his face in shame or agony. Ethan loomed over him, clutching the arm of a woman in a nun’s habit. His hand covered in his brother’s blood. 

The Nun’s face was frozen in mid-scream, her terror unambiguous. shielding herself as if from Ethan’s violent stance. And holding Lucas tenderly

The nun…was Mary — the mother — her face unmistakable even beneath the painter’s careful sanctification. 
…she was undressed and looked ashamed to be in the whole situation 

Watching from a shadowed corner, calm and unyielding, was the father. He didn’t interfere. He didn’t stop it. He observed, his expression approving.

My knees weakened.

This wasn’t art. This was confession.

A history written in paint. A crime hung on canvas.

The “accident.”,  The mother. None of it was what I had been told.

I staggered back, pressing a hand to my mouth, fighting the wave of nausea clawing up my throat. My pulse hammered so loudly I swore it would shake the canvases from their frames.

Behind me, the garage door creaked wider, slow and deliberate.

And a low voice whispered, almost amused:
“You weren’t supposed to see that yet, M-and-M.”

I spun, nearly tripping on the cloth beneath my feet.

Lucas stood in the doorway, leaning casually against the frame. The bulb’s sway painted his bare chest in alternating strips of light and dark. His bandaged eyes fixed toward me, unerring.

“You weren’t supposed to see that yet,” he repeated, his voice low, smooth… almost tender.

My throat locked. I backed against the wall, the unfinished painting looming behind me like a jury. “I—I didn’t mean to—”

He stepped closer. Slow. Deliberate. A predator’s patience in every movement. His smile curved faintly, indulgent.

“But you did,” he murmured. “And now it’s ours.”

I shook my head, pressing flat against the cold wall. “I won’t say anything—”

“I know.” He tilted his head, listening to the panic in my breath. “Because if you did…” He let the words hang, unfinished, letting my imagination complete the threat.

Closer still. The smell of oil, turpentine, and sweat enveloped me, sharp and intoxicating. His hand lifted, stopping just shy of my cheek — not touching, just hovering, trembling faintly as though savoring the heat of my skin.

“You saw the truth,” he whispered. “And that makes you different. Special. My brother doesn’t trust you with it. But I do.”

My whole body quivered — with fear, disgust, and something darker I couldn’t name.

He leaned in until his breath brushed my ear. “So now it’s a secret. Just between you and me. You’ll act like you never saw that painting. You’ll smile at dinner. Laugh at Mary’s little jokes. Nod at my father’s sermons. And when Ethan kisses you…” His smirk widened. “…you’ll remember me.”

I wanted to scream, shove him away, anything. But I stood frozen, my heart pounding so loud it drowned out everything else.

Finally, Lucas stepped back, letting the tension snap. His voice softened into a mocking purr. “Good girl.”

He turned toward the dark, the bulb swaying above him. Over his shoulder, his words drifted back, almost sing-song.
“Secrets make families stronger.”

Then he was gone.

The door creaked shut.

I stumbled out into the hall and slammed it behind me. My hands shook so badly I had to brace myself against the wall.

The secret pressed down on me like a brand. Lucas had chained me with silence.

And worse — he’d made it feel intimate.

It took me a long while to calm my nerves. By the time I finally managed to breathe evenly, I heard the front door open downstairs.

Voices carried through the house, cheerful, warm. Groceries rustled. Mary’s laughter chimed. Ethan’s deep voice rumbled with congratulations on his father’s sermon. But the words they repeated weren’t scripture. I’m not a religious person, but even I knew this wasn’t the Bible. It sounded older. Stranger.

The footsteps grew louder, moving up the stairs. I scrambled back to the bed, phone in hand, pretending I’d been idle all day.

The door opened, and Ethan slipped in. His tie was loose, jacket already slung over his arm.
“Hey, darlin’.” He leaned down, kissed my forehead.

I recoiled before I could stop myself. Just a fraction. Just enough for him to notice.

His brow furrowed as he sat on the edge of the bed, tugging off his black dress shoes. “I hope you didn’t get in too much trouble with Lucas.” He glanced at me. “Or the other way around.”

I shook my head too quickly. “No. I’ve been here all day.” The lie rolled out smoothly, but it stung in my throat. Apparently, lying had become its own kind of love language in this house.

He smiled, but his hazel eyes searched me. “What’s wrong? You’re acting weird.”

The truth pressed against my teeth. The painting. The secret. Lucas’s whisper in my ear. But fear clamped my jaw shut. If I told him, what would happen to me?

“Nothing,” I said instead. “I’m just tired of being cooped up in here all day.”

Ethan exhaled, long and weary, before softening into a smile. “I’m sorry. Hey—how about tomorrow, just you and me? We’ll go out. Something fun.”

Relief trickled through me, small but welcome. “Yes. That’d be nice. What are we thinking? Dinner? Movie?”

I leaned into him, groaning with mock frustration. “No, I want something different.”

He smirked. “Like what? Apple picking?”

“Actually, not a bad idea. Or…” I pulled up the ad on my phone, turning it to him. “I saw this wine-and-paint thing. Thought it might be fun.”

He looked at the screen, his expression polite but flat. “I’m not an artist.”

“Neither am I. That’s the point—it’s about doing something new together.”

He lingered on the ad, then back at me. Hesitating.

So I teased, “Or I could take Lucas.”

His reaction was instant. His smile vanished. He looked at me sharply, his voice low and edged.
“Don’t ever say that again. He’s not something to joke about.”

The malice in his tone startled me. Not jealousy. Possessiveness.

I rolled my eyes to cover my nerves. “Relax. I was kidding.”

“I’m not.” He leaned closer, eyes hard. “I don’t want you even thinking about being alone with him.”

The weight of his words sank into me. I didn’t want to push it further, not now, so I shifted the conversation. “So… does that mean you’ll come with me instead?”

His gaze lingered a moment longer before softening again. “Yeah. We’ll go.”

“Great! It’s this Saturday, so plenty of time to—”

“What time?” he cut in.

“Eleven to twelve-thirty.”

His jaw tightened. “I’ll be working.”

The excitement in me deflated. “What? You don’t work weekends.”

“I have to,” he said quickly. “I want us to have our own place. I can’t do that if I’m not putting in the hours.”

My smile faltered. “So Sunday, then?”

He shook his head once. “Church.”

Frustration flared hot in my chest. I threw my hands up. “Seriously? Just call off, for once!”

“I can’t.” His voice was firm, but underneath it trembled something almost pleading. “Look… how about tonight? Just a dinner date. At least let me give you that.”

I stared at him, disappointment sinking heavy in my gut. This wasn’t what I wanted. But it was something. Better than nothing.

“Fine,” I said quietly. “Dinner.”

His relief was visible. He smiled, leaned in to kiss me again, and I let him.

But I couldn’t stop thinking of the smear of blue paint on the quilt.

The night dragged long and hollow. Dinner had been quiet, too quiet, and when we finally came home, Ethan collapsed into bed like the day had wrung him dry. I lay beside him, staring at the ceiling, waiting for his breathing to deepen into sleep.

Before I moved in, he was attentive. Engaged. Always there. Now… he felt absent, rehearsed, like he was just playing the part of “boyfriend” until the curtain dropped.

I slipped from the bed, the thirst in my throat an ache I couldn’t ignore. With how constant it had been lately, I wondered if I was going pre-diabetic.

The house was silent.

Or so I thought.

When I reached the kitchen, glass in hand, I noticed it again. The garage door. Left ajar.

A thin line of shadow stretched across the floor, the smell of paint drifting out—no longer nauseating, but strangely sweet. Enticing. My pulse quickened, every step toward it feeling less like choice and more like gravity.

I nudged the door open.

And there he was.

Lucas sat before the canvas, painting with furious precision. His lips moved constantly, whispering in a language I didn’t recognize, syllables thick and jagged, nothing human in their cadence. The ribbon of bandages that usually covered his eyes lay discarded on the floor, soaked dark with fresh blood.

The painting was nearly finished.

I didn’t need to guess what it was. The truth stretched across the canvas in grotesque detail: Ethan, Mary, their father—Lucas himself—rendered in divine grandeur, presiding over a figure that looked sickeningly like me.

Before I could retreat, I felt it.

A presence.

I turned—and froze.

The father stood in the doorway, staring down at me with eyes that bored straight through my chest. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. His hand closed around my wrist and shoved me into the garage.

Lucas turned at the sound, head cocking with slow, deliberate grace.
“Oh,” he whispered, lips curling. “We’re starting already? I figured we had more time.”

And then I saw.

His face turned fully toward me, and I screamed.

There were no eyes. Only pits, raw and wet, blood seeping down his cheeks in steady rivulets. Within the hollow sockets, something moved. Wriggling. Pulsing. As if alive. As if waiting.

The door slammed behind me. Ethan stood there, jaw tight, eyes cold. “You just had to get obsessive,” he muttered.

“I told you not to come in here,” the father said, tightening his grip on my wrist until my bones ached. He yanked both my arms behind me, binding me with a strength that felt inhuman. His voice rumbled low and final. “Now… you have to be one of us.”

My throat closed around a sob. “Why? What did I do to you?”

“I tried to keep you from this,” Ethan said, his voice breaking like a man already defeated. He couldn’t even look at me. “But you couldn’t stay away. You had to chase him.”

Infatuation. That’s what they thought this was.

Lucas rose from his stool, blood trailing down his bare chest. His father seized my chin, jerking my face up until I stared directly into those black, writhing holes.

Something inside them stirred, slug-like, muscles flexing and undulating with obscene life. My stomach twisted, terror and revulsion colliding—but underneath, something else crept in. A pull. A longing I couldn’t name.

“Some people are affected differently,” Lucas murmured, his voice almost reverent.

He stepped closer, his hand trembling as he lifted it—then shoved his fingers into my mouth. The coppery tang of blood and paint flooded my tongue. I gagged, but he held firm.

Ethan turned his face away, jaw clenched, ashamed but unmoving.

Lucas leaned close, his whisper hot against my ear.
“But you…” His lips stretched into a grin. “…you were just as predictable.”


The drums rattled through the room, deep and heavy, like they were pounding inside my chest. Mary’s  hands struck them harder, wilder, each beat cracking the air open with memory.
“Oh, I remember my first time with this…” she crooned, her voice breaking on a laugh that didn’t sound like her own. “Ethan said he loved me too.”

I wanted to scream at her, but before I could—something wet hit my skin.

A slug. Cold, slick, obscene. It landed on Lucas’s arm with a soft plop, and before I could even recoil, it slid towards me . My breath caught. The thing crawled down his arm and pressed itself against my lips. Then—it forced its way in. Down my throat. I gagged. Trying to cough it out. But it was already inside me, sinking deeper, like it knew the path better than I did.

Heat spread through my body in pulses, a rhythm I couldn’t escape. My arms twitched. My legs shivered. The music seemed louder now, like the drums were inside my veins. My body wasn’t my own. I could feel myself moving, swaying closer to Lucas, and I hated it. Hated it—yet the more I looked at him, the more I wanted to. His smile lit something inside me that wasn’t mine, something crawling, hungry, and wrong.

Ethan then threw a chair that shattered against Lucas with a crash. My heart lurched—but Lucas didn’t even flinch. His grin only stretched wider, teeth catching the light like knives.

He looked at Ethan, wagging his finger, that awful tsk-tsk-tsk.
“Oh, Ethan… still angry about Mother Mary, huh?” he purred, voice soft as silk and sharp as glass. “Don’t you know? You can’t hurt your own god.”

And I believed him. God help me—I believed him.

Then his eyes locked on me, grotesque and hypnotic, dragging me deeper into that abyss. He smiled.
“Welcome to the family.”

His laugh wasn’t laughter at all. It was a growl.
A beast’s claim.

“Sister.”
