It was about three years ago, I was coming home late one foggy night from work.  I came around the bend in the road and standing there was an old man. His hair was scruffy and white and he stood with a cane and hunch back. He had his long, narrow thumb up and I have to admit, I felt a little sympathy for the old man. 


It was late so I pulled up beside him and rolled my window down. “You need a ride sir?” I asked him. He didn’t say anything, just nodded his head yes. I told him to come around and hop in the passenger and he did so. He smelt of smoke and ashes. 


That’s when the man finally spoke, his voice raspy which made me immediately make the connection on why he smelt of smoke. “Thanks, my names Jack.” I gave a slight smile and said back “Thompson, Mark Thompson and no trouble.” 


“So do you live near here?” I asked. The old man hesitated at first but responded “uh, not too far.” I shrugged and figured he’d tell me the directions along the way. “Are you from here?” Jack asked me. “Yes, I’ve lived here my whole life.” I answered. “So you’ve probably heard.” Jack replied slowly. 

“Heard about what?” I asked. “The old mansion.” He said. I guess he could tell by my face that I was confused and had never heard of that place before. “Back in 1962 a family had lived in a mansion in the woods. A dirt path would lead you to it. They were the wealthiest family in town. They owned almost all the business, basically ran this place for a good while.” He said. 


“Though, it’s easy to let money get to your head. It is the root of all evil, I do so believe. You see, the father of the house got greedy with his money and basically subjected his family to mistreatment and neglect. He wanted all the money to himself and to make sure that no one would take away his fortune, he simply ordered his men to execute his wife and three children who were all girls.” He paused in his story but kept going soon after. 


“The father although left with great fortune, now had no one. Through the years of living in almost solitude, it drove him mad. He eventually lost it and shot himself in that very mansion. It’s been abandoned ever since.” He finally finished. 


The whole time the man told this story, I had an eerie feeling rise within me and chills rolled down my spine. “That’s a pretty creepy tale.” I told him. “You sure know a lot about that place.” Jack turned to face me and said “I’ve been here for a long time now. I’ve witness some things you’d never believe.” 


I noticed up ahead there was a turn off, a dirt road that lead into the woods. “That’s my spot up ahead. You can drop me off at the path, I can walk the rest of the way down.” Jack said. “Are you sure?” I asked eyeing his cane. “Oh yes, I’ll be fine.” He said. “Alright.” I pulled up to the road and let him out. He thanked me again before closing the door and walking off deeper into the path. 


I drove home and curled up next to my sleeping wife. I fell asleep also but had to be right back up at 4am for work the next morning. When I awoke, I decided it would be best if I stopped by the local café before work. 


When I walked in, I was seated at a table and the waitress came to take my order. She was an older lady with a few grey hairs.  “Just a coffee please and a plain bagel.” I said. She took my order but before she left, I stopped her. “Hey, uh this is going to sound strange but have you lived here for a while?” I asked her. She nodded her head. “Have you heard of the abandoned mansion?” I asked, I noticed I sounded kind of eager to get her response. 


“Yes actually, I heard a man murdered his family and then killed himself there. All I know about the place though is the man’s name. It was a  big rumor going around.” She answered. “Well, what was his name?” I asked her. 

“Jack.”
