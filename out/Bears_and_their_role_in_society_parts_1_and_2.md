Good evening my name is Quentin and I’m dead. Not from anything strange or weird, cancer, probably, hopefully. I have have taken the duty upon myself to release the information about them, I don’t know if anyone will get to read this except my maid or the UN who has been spying on me for a decade or two now. I know the “rats” are fake guys like seriously I maybe old but using failed Cold War spyware that doesn’t even look like a real rat is humiliating to me.

Anyways them are a secret race that are both hyper intelligent and bloodlusted. The them are bears. Yes bears, not just one group ALL of them (even koalas). bears are responsible for most world events since 1760(except 9/11 and Nazis,but one neo Nazi group was run by bears in New Mexico in 97. The RFD exterminated all records that were not in the UN archives in the Vatican) I’m getting off track.

the most significant events that the public need to know about bear involvement are the overthrowing of the Russian monarchy, Bigfoot and that evil Mexican dog thing, the Roosevelt treaty and what the Mongolians did with pandas.

Now what are bears? I don’t know. All the UN records point to the now gone ice bridge that was connecting Russia and Alaska thousands of years ago. The remains of the old ones were discovered there, god lucky bear magic only lingers for 500 years otherwise the UN archives would have been “lost” again.

The most important bear groups are the eastern brown bears in Russia, the na brown bears(under the Roosevelt treaty),black bears, Andean bears found down south of Texas to Madagascar and the giant pandas o god the pandas

Well that should be enough for the first part, need to add more fear into the garden gnomes. Remember keep storing human fear into your gnomes so bear shamans can’t curse you, safe travels.

——————————————————————

I’m back from restocking the fear into the gnomes, it takes a lot out of me old self to do this biweekly. It beats paying 20$ for the government to do it (they always halfass the job).

Anyway my maid decided to copy my memoir onto her phone to post it in parts to something called reddit. She got the idea from some podcast about creepy stories. She tried to show it to me once but it just seemed like two gay cops talking about Jesus or something.

Now that out the way time to talk about the Roosevelt treedy established in 1902. Now for you to fully understand the meaningfulness of the agreement you need to know about bear habitats.

You might be thinking that they live in family groups in caves mostly located at least 5 miles away from a human settlement as by the nature nurture act of 47. But this is mostly UN propaganda. Yes they live in caves but in one given area (depending on the size) there are 4 to 32 of these bear caves in close proximity of each other; this is so when in “hibernation” they can all together commune below the earth where the dukes and and the Sharman’s live. (That’s all the info I can get about it but I know Greenland has it. They hate to provide info about the bears after the incident).

Okay you should now understand the circumstances of which I’m about to tell you. So you know the old tale about Theodore Roosevelt and how he saved the bear and he had “teddy bears” named after him? It’s all fucking lies I tell you all fucking lies and o look it’s past my bedtime I’ll have to continue this tomorrow after sexy bingo down at the good ol’ swimming pool. Safe travels.
