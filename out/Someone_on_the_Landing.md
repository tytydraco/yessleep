Not sure if this is sleep deprivation or something real, but I keep waking up to this weird feeling at night—like someone is standing just outside my bedroom door.

The landing is just outside my door. A few feet away, the stairs lead down into darkness. Across from my room, mounted on the wall, is a hallway mirror.

It came with the house, actually. The mirror. Nailed to the wall like it belonged there.

When my door is open, I can see part of it from bed, just enough to catch movement—if there was any.

Even before this, it looked a little wrong. Like the angles in the reflection didn’t match the room—just close enough to fool you if you weren’t really looking.

I decided to keep it for the aesthetics. It must have been worth something.

It started a week ago. I’ll be asleep, and then suddenly wide awake for no reason. My room is dark, quiet, normal. But the hallway outside? It feels…wrong. Like if I open the door, something will already be facing me. Not moving. Not making a sound. Just…waiting.

At first I chalked it up to anxiety. It’s an old Victorian house. Plus, work’s been rough lately. Deadlines. Isolation. That kind of stress will play tricks on your senses. But this feels different. It doesn’t feel like fear. It feels like I’m being cued. Like something’s rehearsing this moment—waiting for me to play my part.

I’ve tried ignoring it. But last night, I swear I heard something. A soft creak. Like weight shifting on the floorboards.

I live alone.

I told myself it was the house settling, but then I heard it again. A step.

I didn’t move. Just lay there, listening. The sound was slow, deliberate. Like someone testing the stairs. One at a time.

This morning, I finally checked. Nothing there. Except…

The hallway mirror was tilted downward.

I never touch it.

[Update: 2:23 AM]

Stayed up tonight. Didn’t plan to, but I couldn’t sleep. Around 1:30, I heard the sound again. A single step. Not up the stairs this time. Above me.

There is no attic.

I stared at the mirror from my bed, barely breathing. In the dark, it looked almost normal. Almost.

Then I saw it.

A smudge. At eye level.

Like someone had been pressing their face against the glass.

I got up to wipe it off.

As I leaned in, I noticed it.

The smudge was oily, like skin.

It smelled faintly metallic.

And as I wiped it, I swear I felt a warmth through the glass—like a breath on the other side.

Something shifted in the mirror. Not my reflection. The hallway. But it wasn’t mine.

The hallway looked…deeper. Like it didn’t end. The walls were stone, cracked in places, leaking shadows.

But they were not random. The layout matched mine—mostly.

The baseboards.

The fixture shapes.

The shadows were falling in the right direction, but not from any light I recognized. Like it was trying to copy the architecture, but hadn’t gotten the lighting engine right yet.

And the stairs…they were not just steep. They were descending in reverse. Like gravity didn’t work there the same way.

And there was something just at the bottom step. Not moving. Not fully in the light.

My phone camera froze when I tried to snap a pic.

When I looked back up…it was gone.

I haven’t slept since.

But I have seen it watching me dream.

[Update: 2:49 AM]

I put the mirror face-down on the floor. Thought maybe it would help.

It didn’t.

I was halfway back to bed when I heard scratching. Faint, like nails across wood. Coming from the mirror.

I left the room. Stayed downstairs for a bit. When I came back up, the mirror was upright again.

Not tilted. Not cracked. Just…standing.

Facing the stairs.

I didn’t even hear it move. I don’t know how long I stood there, watching it.

It’s just glass, I told myself. But it stared the way predators don’t blink. Like it was memorizing me.

But the longer I looked, the more I realized it was thinking too.

Like every second I stared gave it more data.

I draped a sheet over it. Didn’t dare touch the glass again.

[Update: 3:04 AM]

Does anyone else ever get the feeling that some mirrors don’t reflect your house?

That they show something that wants to look like your house. But doesn’t know how.

Something about the angles in the reflection are off. Subtle things. The shadow under the light switch. The color of the carpet. The absence of… sound.

It’s dead silent in the reflection.

And sometimes…I swear I see movement.

The hallway in the mirror always shows the light off—even when mine is on. And sometimes the door on the left side is slightly open.

I don’t have a door there.

I started thinking maybe it wasn’t the mirror that changed. Maybe I’m not in my house anymore. Maybe I’m in its version of it.

I’m beyond scared.

I moved the mirror again, this time into the hallway. Covered it completely. But the sheet won’t stay. It slips off, like something wants it visible.

I taped the corners. Weighed it down.

It did not matter.

It is as if the mirror wants to see—and worse, be seen.

Like attention is part of the mechanism.

[Final Post: 3:28 AM]

The mirror showed the stairs again. Not mine. But closer now.

There was a figure this time. Standing at the landing. Still as stone. No features I could make out. Just…a presence.

The lights flickered when I tried to look away.

And when I turned back, it was one step higher.

I have left the house. Taking this to a friend’s place. But just now, in the car, I glanced at the rearview mirror—

And saw stairs.

Not a road. Not the back seat.

Stairs.

And standing halfway down them…was something.

It looked up. Not at me. At the glass.

Its shape was almost human. But not the way a person is—it was arranged to look like one.

It stood wrong. Not upright, not slouched—just… designed. Like someone built a person from memory and forgot the feeling behind it.

I think it follows through reflections.

If anyone else is dealing with this—do not face the mirror.

Do not give it a face to copy.

If this thing is learning…maybe that is the rule.

Do not give it too long to study.

Do not give it too much to work with.

Do not open your door to what already knows your name.
