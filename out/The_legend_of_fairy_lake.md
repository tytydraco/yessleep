Every place has its ghost story. Sometimes it’s a woman in white wandering the backroads, sometimes it’s a haunted hotel with one room everyone swears you should never stay in.

I’ve built a career — well, a blog — out of hunting down those stories and tearing them apart. Bigfoot? A guy in a rug. UFOs? Nine times out of ten, it’s a drone or a drunk. Haunted houses? Usually raccoons in the attic and bad plumbing.

So when someone emailed me about a lake in Quebec called Fairy Lake, I thought it’d be another easy win.

They wrote: “On Halloween night, when there’s a full moon, the chief’s daughter rises from the water. She sings, and anyone who hears her will never leave the forest.”

It had everything a campfire story needs — tragedy, ghosts, and just enough history to sound convincing. But I was sure it’d be another case of creepy fog + overactive imaginations.

Turns out, I was wrong.

The Legend

The locals say that before settlers came, there was a tribe who lived at the lake. They worshiped the forest spirits, holding rituals by the shoreline. Fires burned, drums pounded, voices carried over the water. They asked for strong crops, successful hunts, protection.

When the settlers arrived, they drove the people out — except for the chief’s daughter. They kept her as a trophy, parading her like an animal. She wasted away under their “care,” starved and beaten.

Before she died, she cursed the land. She swore she would return with the spirits of the forest, and anyone who trespassed near her resting place would be dragged before them.

They say she rises once a year, always near Halloween. Always under a full moon. And when she rises, she sings.

Interviews

I drove up to Chelsea, the nearest town, to ask around.

At the bakery, the woman behind the counter refused to talk. She just stared at me, pale, and said: “If you go there, don’t look at her reflection.”

At the gas station, an old man chuckled when I asked about Fairy Lake. “Tourists go. They never stay long. The lake doesn’t want them there.”

“People actually disappear?” I asked.

He shrugged. “Hunters. Campers. Hikers. Happens every ten years or so.”

Finally, in a bar, I found a man willing to spill. He leaned close, breath heavy with beer. “I saw her once. Full moon. Halloween night. She rose up out of the lake, singing. My buddy said it was a trick, some kind of prank. He stayed. I ran. I never saw him again.”

“You think she took him?”

He drained his glass, not answering.

The more people I spoke to, the clearer it became: everyone in Chelsea knew the story. Most wouldn’t even say her name.

The Approach

Fairy Lake sits an hour’s hike through the pines. By day, it looks like a postcard: tall trees leaning like guardians, moss soft underfoot, water smooth as glass.

But by dusk, things shifted. The birds grew quiet. The breeze that had carried the smell of pine went still. The air pressed heavier against my skin, damp and cold.

I set up camp on the north bank, camera rigs pointed at the water. If nothing happened, I’d at least get good footage for a blog post.

By 11 p.m., the forest was silent. Not quiet — silent. No crickets. No owls. Not even the sound of water lapping the shore. The lake had gone perfectly flat.

My breath fogged in the air, even though the night wasn’t that cold.

I tried to joke into my recorder: “Well, Fairy Lake’s got atmosphere. Creepy out of ten.” But my voice sounded too loud. Like it didn’t belong here.

Then the smell came. Sweet and sour, like rotting leaves mixed with pond scum. It clung to the back of my throat.

I started to feel watched.

Midnight

The moon broke free of the clouds, round and silver. Mist curled across the lake.

That’s when I saw her.

At first, it was just a reflection — a shadow in the water, where no one stood. Then it began to rise, peeling itself free of the lake like a second skin.

She looked sixteen at most. Long hair dripping like weeds, a dress clinging wet to her body, skin pale and thin. Her eyes were pits of black, pulling the light out of the air.

Her mouth opened.

And she began to sing.

It wasn’t right. The sound came from everywhere — under the water, above the trees, inside my skull. Her voice doubled, warped, like two singers out of sync.

“By fire we called, by moon we prayed,
The spirits fed us, the hunters stayed.”

The lake behind her rippled violently. Shapes churned beneath the surface — dozens of bodies thrashing just under the glassy water.

“The strangers came with iron and flame,
They took my body, they cursed my name.”

The moss beneath my boots writhed. My feet sank as if hands were pulling me down.

She raised her arm. Her fingers bent wrong, like broken branches. She pointed at me.

“Now each full moon, one soul I take,
The spirits hunger at dark Fairy Lake.”

Her voice dropped to a growl, rattling in my chest. The water went still. The whispers stopped.

And then she was gone.

After

I don’t remember packing my gear. Only running, branches slapping my face, lungs burning.

My camera footage shows nothing. No girl. No song. Just me, staring like an idiot at calm water.

But my boots are still stained black with rot. Nothing cleans them.

Three nights later, I woke to dripping. My floor was dry. My ceiling was dry. But in the mirror across the room, I saw her — standing behind me, hair dripping lake water, lips moving.

I couldn’t hear the song, but I could see it in her mouth. Verse by verse.

And I knew if I stayed watching, I’d hear it again.

So now I leave the mirror covered at night.

But the dripping hasn’t stopped.

And Halloween’s only a few weeks away.
