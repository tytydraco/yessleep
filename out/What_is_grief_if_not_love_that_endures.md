Today marks exactly 7 months since I ended my last relationship and experienced the greatest suffering of my life. It has been difficult months, where every day the weight on my chest seems like it might ease, but it never does. The feeling of losing someone you love so much leaves a hole in your heart that takes time to heal, and in my case, I don’t think it ever will. I know everyone deals with breakups differently: some go out to have fun, some drown their sorrows, cry, others pretend they’re fine on the outside, and so much more. But some people feel the blow of the loss differently; some feel like the ground has disappeared beneath their feet. I remember watching *New Moon* and thinking the scene where months go by with Bella standing still was a grand exaggeration, but when he left, that’s exactly what happened to me—except, I watched my body slowly wither away.

We met a while ago at an Egyptology convention. The purpose of the event was to announce a new discovery to the other partner universities, which I was part of in my research group: the study of 3 new female mummies brought from Egypt to our lab. He and I were studying the same course, History, and were in the same semester, the seventh, but at different universities, and that encounter seemed almost like fate. It was like meeting someone I had always dreamed of. We spent the three days of the convention together, exchanging ideas, having fun with the talks from other researchers who were poorly prepared to speak about embalming and teachers who were too proud but lacked any teaching skills. When the days together ended, we exchanged phone numbers and kept in touch for three months as our intimacy and affection for each other only grew, until it became an official long-distance relationship. That’s how our relationship went for 9 months. We made calls every day, and on weekends, we would talk for hours on Skype. My roommates at college had some doubts about our relationship at first, asking me what he was like and things like that, as if they couldn’t believe I was dating him. But over time, their patience wore thin, and they couldn’t stand so much mushiness all Saturday long, and they would leave whenever I turned on the camera.

Our relationship was always good, despite the distance. We were always talking about our day-to-day lives and making plans for when we would finally live together. We had everything planned: wall colors, furniture styles, how many children we’d have, what food we’d cook for birthdays, where we’d go for dinner on special occasions, and what we’d say when the first girlfriend or boyfriend came over. Our dream life was perfect, like he was always inside my mind, answering just like I liked. It was easier to live in our idealized fantasy world than in our real lives as struggling university students living so far apart with real problems. It was more fun to hypothetically worry about in-law issues than deal with the 12-hour separation between us.

Then, one day, out of nowhere, he called me with a tearful voice, and without explaining much, he said he didn’t want to be with me anymore, that it was too much suffering for him. He hung up on me, leaving me there with all his suffering on my shoulders. I tried calling again, but it went straight to voicemail. For almost a week, I tried to reach him in every way I could, but it seemed like he had disappeared from my life. I didn’t know any emergency contacts for him to try and understand what was happening. I didn’t know his friends, family, or even his roommates. I didn’t have his full name to search for him on the university website or the phone directory. I was blocked on his Skype and didn’t know how to handle everything so suddenly.

In the first month after the breakup, I could only cry. Nothing made sense anymore. Nothing I liked could be enjoyed without remembering him. My once-dreamed future now felt like a blur of ink. There was nothing left of what I had once idealized; everything was uncertain. I lost about 10 kg, refusing to eat, and this affected my performance in college because I couldn’t even stand up.

By the second month, I had given up on everything. I dropped out of college to go back to my parents' house. The pain, which should have passed by now, became stronger, destroying my appetite, my strength, and my will. I spent my days in bed crying, and another 10 kg vanished.

By the third month, the pain became more and more physical. Now, I could see my bones pressing against my skin. My ribs poked through any clothes I wore, and the pain of being without him seemed to move through my muscles, as if spreading throughout my body, making me feel worse and worse. I felt the breakup under my skin, and as a way to relieve it, I often hurt myself just so the suffering would stop, even if only for a while.

Fearing I would harm myself further, my parents put me in a psychiatric hospital in the fourth month. Their goal was for the professionals there to bring relief to my pain. That month, I was sedated for days, but no medication seemed to resolve the pain climbing my spine and lodging in my chest. The reality was unbearable without the one who knew me better than I knew myself.

By the fifth month, I was seeing two different psychologists to try to understand what was going on. One even decided to go after my ex to try to understand everything and help me put an end to this feeling, but the pain persisted. That month, I looked at myself in the mirror for the first time in a long time, and I was horrified at how I looked now: my skin was gray, my limbs seemed so thin that they felt like they might snap at any moment. My eyes bulged from their sockets, and the beautiful woman I once was had become a rotting, walking skeleton… A MUMMY. This was no longer just psychological suffering; I was at risk of dying. They admitted me to a good hospital in my hometown, where they tried to care for me and understand how I had gotten to this state.

An entire month of hospital stays, numerous tests almost every week, as my body grew closer to complete failure. I suffered more than ever, an excruciating pain as if my skin was tightening around my bones while I felt the parasitic suffering from the breakup running through my body, destroying the little health I had left. Then, one day, my psychologist visited me, carrying a large bag under his arm with a look of sadness on his face. He didn’t seem ready to be the bearer of the terrible news that was to come.

He had records from the university my ex attended—lists of students from 20 years ago to just two days ago, with names marked, but none belonged to my beloved. Pages torn from yellow phone directories from the same time, with the same names marked, but none of them had the name of the man who had left me in this state. His last attempt was photos from the university event. I was in them, my eyes still shining with excitement, happy to study those mummies, but in the 20 photos taken, he wasn’t in any of them. I argued for almost 15 minutes that this didn’t make sense, that it was a bad joke because I remembered him beside me during all the camera clicks, but he calmed me down. Then, my parents came into the room, also carrying a bag, and that sent me into a panic. They took my laptop and showed me the Skype call logs: me, alone, for 8, 10, 12 hours straight, sending messages to a profile that didn’t even exist, messages that were never answered. None of it made sense and it was driving me crazy, my mind spiraling into collapse.

I thought I was going to die. I felt my body giving up. I felt like there was no strength to continue, no more sense in anything. Had I imagined all of that and let myself get to this stage—why? More days passed after discovering my delirious state until the answer came through a test I had previously taken: I was sick. A new kind of parasite had lodged inside me, first feeding on my brain and spreading its offspring throughout my body, consuming every part of me. The delay in identifying it was because no one had seen anything like it before.

The mummy I had studied didn’t get its name in my honor, but the parasite I had acquired did. They are still studying it through samples of me while trying to find a cure for the disease, which not only affected me but also two students from our lab and a professor. While I wait, I feel my body failing more and more each day. My heart is being devoured, and I know I have only a few days left because my ex comes to visit me every day. He cries softly, holding onto my bed, telling me that I’ll be okay, and when I leave here, we’ll pick up all the plans we once left behind.
