Trigger warning >!sexual harassment, possible implied SA!<

When I got the call, at first I couldn’t believe the news.

The voice belonged to the woman who’d interviewed me less than a week earlier. “Lauren Mackerly,” she’d said as she’d held out her hand. Her cobalt suit, sharply tailored to her narrow frame, and formal way of speaking contrasted with the grungy atmosphere of the coffee shop where we’d met.

She hadn’t asked me any questions. Rather, we’d chatted about our respective family histories before she asked *me* if I had any inquiries about Abernathy Industries. When I requested a more detailed description of the nature of the work the job entailed, Lauren refused to expand beyond the vague platitudes in the listing: “workplace support,” “PR assistance,” and “corporate image refinement.”

I asked a second question. “The salary in the listing…is that fully accurate?”

As she nodded, her face settled into a dazzling smile that displayed her perfectly shaped, immaculately white teeth. “Yes, Monica, it is. Those worthy of joining our family are compensated accordingly.”

I’d left the interview convinced my efforts would amount to nothing more than those I’d expended on the other applications I’d submitted in the months since I’d been laid off. It’d had been my first position since graduating from college a year ago.

The posting had undoubtedly attracted a plethora of highly-qualified candidates, especially given its minimal experience prerequisites. I doubted I’d be a serious contender, and Lauren hadn’t treated me as one.

So, naturally, I felt elated when Lauren offered me the position. No longer would I be begging my roommate Elijah for more time to reimburse him with my portion of the monthly rent. No longer would I be asking my parents for even more financial support. No longer would Alice and I begin our date nights nibbling on ramen noodle soup or the same boring plates of store-brand pasta.

I texted her the news right away. Alice insisted on coming over, and she embraced me upon arriving. “I’m *so* happy for you,” she said before planting a kiss on my cheek.

I thanked her through a blush. “I’m sure something will turn up for you, too, before long.”

Alice had been a year behind me in school, and she had yet to land a job since graduating. I’d warned her that a creative writing degree would only get her so far in today’s job market, but she’d insisted on going through with it. She was passionate about her writing, and I loved that about her even as I worried about her ability to ever afford to leave her parents’ house.

*Once we’re both working, and we’ve saved up enough, we can finally move in together,* she’d told me. At the time, it had seemed like a far-off dream. Now, it felt tangible.

We ordered and ate better food that we could cook before settling in together in my bedroom. We cuddled, made love, cuddled some more, and watched a show on my laptop as Alice slowly drifted to sleep in my arms. I set an early alarm and soon joined her in slumber.

When the private security guard came to unlock the lobby doors of my new workplace, I was already there waiting. He was short and burly, and his nametag displayed “David.”

I was dressed in a formal gray skirt suit. During the commute, I’d recounted everything Lauren had told me, such as bringing two forms of ID for the security check.

She’d also said something strange. “*We pride ourselves on maintaining a clean, uncontaminated work environment. Accordingly, you will be expected to comply with our procedures for keeping it that way.*” I hadn’t thought to ask Lauren what she’d meant by that. 

“I’m looking for the front desk,” I told David.

He directed me to another guard, a curly-haired woman named Donna who presided over a kiosk.

“New hire?” she asked.

I nodded. “Ms. Mackerly told me to ask for her.”

“Well, you don’t have long to wait,” Donna replied. She motioned to the front door, where Lauren and a group of four men, all at least double my age and dressed in business suits, had just entered the building. 

“Before you go,” said Donna, “let me tell you one thing.” She leaned across the desk, until her head was close to mine, and spoke in a firm whisper. “Whatever you do, *don’t turn back*.”

“Turn back?” I repeated, perplexed.

Donna ignored me. On a dime, she adopted a bright, bubbly affect as she greeted Lauren and the men who accompanied her. “Good morning Lauren, Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Morgan, Mr. Rogers, and Mr. Fitzgerald.” 

Lauren, alone, acknowledged me. “Look at you, here bright and early! Let me tell you – we are all *so* happy to have you onboard.”

“I’m happy to be here.” 

“We have *much* to show you today,” she continued. “But, first, we need to go through our standard morning protocols.”

“Morning protocols?”

“This way.” I followed Lauren to a set of elevators. By this point, more employees had arrived. The elevator had at least fifteen people on it. Lauren was the only other woman, as well as the only other person who looked to be under forty-five.

We ascended only one floor. To my surprise, the doors opened to reveal a yellow-tiled locker room. I gasped at the spectacle before me of *dozens* of fully naked adults.

As the men who’d ridden up with me dispersed across the room, they, too, began abruptly stripping. After stuffing their outfits in lockers, they headed towards a large, communal shower.

Lauren gripped my arm and led me forward. “Your locker’s this way, right next to mine!”

“Um…” I mumbled, shocked by what was happening. “Is…um…”

“Cat got your tongue?” giggled Laura as she opened a locker for me. “Just leave your clothes here.” She handed me two white towels.

“I, uh…I already showered today.”

“That isn’t good enough, honey! You had to travel to get here, after all. We can’t have people carry the stench of the street in with them. Why, if we allowed that, our office would be a pigsty in no time!”

“But…I just…”

“You just what?”

Instinctively, I averted my gaze from Lauren who, by this point, had removed nearly all of her clothes. “I just didn’t know this was going to happen. You can’t expect me to just strip in front of so many strangers with no warning. I can’t do that.”

“Well, silly, I told you that we take cleanliness seriously! Same decontamination procedures for everyone. Plus, it’s too late to give up now!” A passing figure, donning the same birthday suit as so many others, caught her attention. “Oh, I need to chat with Mr. Ellison – catch up with you later!”

She hurried off, leaving me staring into the open locker before me. *What the fuck was happening?*

The problem wasn’t that I was a prude, or that I was particularly shy about my appearance. I’d been in locker rooms before, though they’d always been gender-segregated. I could deal with a situation like this at a pool or rec center.

But this was a *workplace* - one where, seemingly, I was expected as a condition of employment to be *fully naked* around all my new coworkers.

I considered returning to the elevators and leaving, job be damned.

But, I reminded myself of the salary. I *needed* that money. Without it, I’d be back to groveling – with Elijah, with my parents, with my landlord. Was what was being asked of me more or less dignified than that?

“Whatever you do, *don’t turn back,*” Donna had whispered. The more I thought about the dire tone she’d used, the more an ominous feeling enveloped me. Lauren’s words, too, flashed through my mind: *Plus, it’s too late to give up now!* Was leaving even an option?

*I can do this,* I repeated to myself. It’ll just be like one of those Japanese bathhouses Elijah had mentioned. *Everyone here just wants to get to work. They won’t be paying attention.*

I placed my jacket and heels in the locker. My dress shirt and skirt followed. With the towels wrapped tightly around my waist and breasts, I slipped off my underwear and bra. I took a deep breath before approaching the showers.

Dozens of showerheads dotted the large chamber. Underneath them, my co-workers cleaned themselves comfortably, seemingly at ease with the situation.

At its far end, I spotted a handful of individual shower stalls, their entrances covered by curtains. Relieved, I headed towards them.

I halted at the sound of Lauren’s loud, panicked voice. “Those aren’t for you, Monica!”

I paused, self-consciously sensing dozens of pairs of eyes walking all over my half-covered body. “W-what do you mean?”

Water rained down over Lauren where she stood in one of the room’s corners. She lathered a bluish liquid across her bare chest and shoulders as she spoke. “You have to be with us for a *while* to get a private stall! I don’t even have one.”

“Oh,” I muttered. “Then, um, where do I…”

Lauren cut me off. “You’re standing right under it!”

I glanced up, spotting a shower head installed into the ceiling. Next to it was a red light. “Here?” I asked. “Not even against a wall?”

“No, silly! You have to earn a spot against the wall. But it makes no difference – you’ll end up just as clean, no matter where you shower! Just place your towel on the rack and press your foot against the switch,” she said, gesturing to a flimsy piece of plastic shelving and a round metal protrusion on the floor next to it, “and get to scrubbing!”

*Jesus fucking Christ,* I thought, as I realized that I was expected to clean myself in the center of *everyone*, in a spot fully visible from all angles.

I felt frozen, my feet welded to the floor. How could any of this be real?

Others started to notice my hesitation. “You millennials have it so easy,” uttered a coarse voice belonging to a figure showering under a wall-mounted faucet.

“Um…excuse me?”

“You heard me,” he said, his uncircumcised schlong jostling as he vigorously rubbed soap across his butt and upper legs. “When I was your age, I broke rocks at a quarry. Nearly lost my hand twice in a crusher. Would’ve loved something like this. These days, you young’uns just expect to be pampered. Given your own private stall on day one.”

His comments infuriated me. I wanted to curse at him. To scream in his arrogant ear. To tear out his few remaining strands of gray hair.

But I did no such thing. *I can do this.* I told myself once again. I disrobed and put my weight on the button. 

Warm water descended on me. Doing my best to ignore my surroundings, I used the soap and shampoo on the rack to clean myself as quickly as I could.

Mercifully, no one whistled or taunted me. As far as I could tell, no one had anything that could be used to photograph or film me. For a moment, I felt that everything might be okay.

When I stepped away, a deafening, high-pitched alarm shattered my sense of relative calm. I felt every inch of my nakedness as I again found myself the subject of everyone’s attention.

“Sorry, Monica!” called Lauren, “I forgot to tell you: you can’t leave until you’re fully decontaminated! The system will tell you when you’re ready.”

I reluctantly returned to the shower and continued to clean myself. In the agonizing minutes that followed, I felt more embarrassed and exposed than ever before.

Finally, the light above me changed from red to green. Frantically, I threw the towels around me and hurried back to my locker.

~

“In the future, you’ll need to be faster,” said Lauren, as the elevator brought us from floor 2 to 39. “But I’m sure you’ll catch on in no time!”

Dumbstruck by recent events, I stared at the shiny door before me, where my blurry reflection, once again donning the formal outfit I’d arrived in, shivered from the dampness of my hair in the building’s low temperature.

Thoughts swam through my mind. I’d just been asked to do something humiliating…and I’d just done it, all for a paycheck. What did that say about me?

The doors eventually opened to a marble lobby. I followed Lauren past offices and conference rooms. She stopped when we reached a dead end where several pieces of furniture were stacked against a wall. “And, here it is!” she said with a smile. “Your workplace!”

“What workplace?”

“Oh, sorry, one moment please.” Lauren removed from the pile a flimsy plastic chair and placed it before me. My jaw dropped, I watched as she then lifted an open-front student desk – the kind you’d see in a middle school classroom – and placed it in front of the chair. “Ta da! Your office is complete.”

I felt something snap inside of me. “Lauren, this is ridiculous. First, without *any warning*, you ask me to-”

Lauren interrupted me. “Monica, I get it! One hundred percent. It upset me at first, too. But guess what? There’s a light at the end of the tunnel.” She removed a thick envelope from her purse and placed it on the desk.

~

“*Ten thousand dollars?*” stammered Alice, as bewildered as I’d been. I’d gone straight from work to her place.

I nodded. “But she made me sign something about it. If I don’t keep the job for sixty days, I have to give it back.”

“Maybe you *should* give it back.”

“What?”

“Everything you’ve described…it’s gross. You should quit.”

I shrugged. “Yeah, but…I rely on *so many* people for help as it is. And rent’s going up soon. I can’t turn this down.”

To my surprise, there were tears in Alice’s eyes, and her voice cracked when she spoke. “Monica, I don’t want to be like, controlling about your life decisions, but, I-I don’t *like* the idea of you being, you know…in front of all those people like that.”

I wrapped my arms around her. “I’m sorry. I didn’t think about it like that.”

“It’s okay,” she whispered. “Who am I to judge. Living in my childhood bedroom while you try to support yourself.”

“No, I understand. It’s just…I want to give this some time. I’ll apply elsewhere, and I’ll have something else figured out when the two months are up.”

“Okay.” She looked down as she spoke. “It’s getting late, you know.”

I checked my watch. “Oh, right. I’d better get going.” Alice’s parents didn’t like her having company past nine.
 
~
 
Over the next few days, I arrived at the building as it opened, well before my shift began. That way, I’d at least begin my shower with only a handful of co-workers around me.

While I occasionally caught someone peeking or leering at me – something my death glare usually convinced them to cease – no one did anything worse than that.

A corded phone had been placed on my desk, but nobody ever called it. I used it several times to reach Lauren, who responded evasively to inquiries about my duties.

“You’re doing a *great* job!”

“But I’m not doing *anything*.”

“Just keep up the good work. Oh, and I hope you’ve put your first bonus to good use.”

I had, in fact, burned through much of the money, though not on anything frivolous. I’d paid back my parents for the last two checks they’d sent me, and I’d reimbursed Elijah for what I owed him.

My first assignment came that Friday. Lauren took me several floors up.

The windows that lined the wall of the office she led me to provided a breathtaking view of the surrounding cityscape. A large executive desk made of mahogany wood stood in the room’s center. At Lauren’s instruction, I sat in the matching leather chair behind it.

“Just turn on the computer,” Lauren ordered, “and wait here.”

The computer’s screen displayed across three monitors. It was an impressive setup. But, for now, there wasn’t much that I could do other than admire it, as the computer prompted me to enter login credentials that I didn’t have.

When Lauren returned a few minutes later, she was leading a group of four men, all older and well-dressed. “And right here,” said Lauren, with the forced enthusiasm of a tour guide, “is our newest associate, Monica Wilson.”

“Nice to meet you,” I said. 

“Contrary to what you’ll read in lousy, unfounded articles accusing us of running a homogenous ‘old boys club,’” Lauren continued. “Abernathy Industries in fact has a diverse workplace, as you can see. In fact, Monica has a grandparent from Taiwan!”

“Oh,” said one of the men with a smile. “My family’s from Taiwan.”

“Exactly!” Lauren exclaimed. “Now, please follow me.”

~

I sat, perplexed, for several minutes. Eventually, Lauren slid the door partially open and popped her head inside. “Monica, I don’t have much time, but I just wanted to tell you that you did great!”

“Wait, what? *That* was the project? Who were those men?”

“The type of people who supply this company’s lifeblood, Monica. You made a very positive impression with Mr. Tsai.”

“But…how did you even know about my grandmother?”

“You mentioned her during your interview, silly! Look, I’ve got to go, but I’m sure you can find your way back down without me.”

~

Over the next two weeks, I fell into a mind-numbing routine of greeting David and Donna, showering, sitting at my flimsy desk, and spending the hours that followed on my personal phone. My only assignment during that period consisted of driving Mr. Morgan’s car from the 10-minute spot where he’d left it to a garage.

When my first paycheck arrived, it felt too good to be true. Why were they paying me so much to do so little? 

~

The next week, Lauren reported to me that Mr. Morgan had again requested my assistance, this time by ordering his favorite drink from the bar on building’s top level and bringing it to him in the lounge nearby.

“I can do that, but didn’t you tell me that I don’t have access to the lounge?”

“I’ve arranged for you to have permission to carry out this task. You are to leave promptly after delivering the drink. No looking around, no loitering.”

“Got it.”

“Oh, and one last thing: make sure the bartender uses fresh nutmeg. Mr. Morgan prefers it that way.”

~

Soon after, a man in a tuxedo held the lounge door open for me as I carried a full coupe glass inside. A lush, red carpet stretched across the floor, and portraits of wealthy, well-dressed men lined the walls.

The room’s occupants resembled the subjects of those paintings. They congregated around pool and poker tables and murmured in quiet conversation. One let out a loud ‘sniff’ before handing a rolled up dollar bill to another.

Several made snide remarks about my presence (*“What’s she doing here?” “You sure ‘she’ is the right pronoun? You never know these days.”*), but I ignored them as I looked for Mr. Morgan. He was a little younger than most of the executives, and noticeably well-built.

A young woman walked briskly past me. I’d seen her once before in the locker room, but I’d yet to introduce myself to her. She was the only co-worker I’d encountered who appeared close to my age, she presently wore a fitted black velvet dress.

She approached the poker table, where she handed a wooden box to a man I recognized as Mr. Hoffman. He opened it, revealing a set of premium cigars. “Just right,  Courtney,” he said, brushing his hand against hers as she stepped away.

I flagged her down and asked if she could help me find Mr. Morgan.

“I think he’s in the VIP section.” She motioned to a corridor covered by a purple curtain. “But you can’t go in there, even with the permission you have.”

“So, what do I do?”

She shrugged. “Just wait until someone exits or enters. Don’t bother anyone in here, and don’t try to go in.”

~

For several minutes, I listened to voices from the other side of the curtain. Mostly, they consisted of periodic, raucous cheers, as if reacting to a high-stakes sports game. But, every so often, I discerned something disturbing: piercing cries of misery and pain, all seemingly emanating from the same unfortunate soul.

Eventually, someone did leave the room, and he agreed to fetch Mr. Morgan for me. When Mr. Morgan pulled open the curtain, I got a brief glimpse into the VIP area. There, a group of important-looking men were transfixed by something out of my line of sight.

Mr. Morgan closed the curtain as he greeted me. “Good to see you, Monica.” I handed him the drink, which he sipped. “Perfect,” he announced.

“I’m glad,” I said, thankful I’d been firm with the bartender about the ingredients. “Um, is everything okay in there? Is someone hurt?”

“Don’t be nosy, Monica,” he snapped.

“Sorry.”

“You’re doing well so far, Monica. You’re in my good graces, and I’m a valuable friend around here. And if you want to keep things that way, don’t ask too many questions.” He gave me a playful wink before returning to the VIP section.

~

“How’s the job search going?” asked Alice.

“You’re asking *me* that?” I responded, incredulously.

“Monica! You know I’m trying my absolute hardest. And I *have* gotten a couple story acceptances.”

“Sorry.”

“You told me you’d be out of that hellhole by now.”

“Yeah, but…”

“But what?”

“I…I’m still looking.”

“*Are* you, though? Where have you applied?”

“Forget it.”

~

That night, I looked at my bank account. For the first time in years, the balance it displayed didn’t send me into a panic.

I spent hours crunching numbers – listing prices, projected balances, and potential expenses. Eventually, I arrived at a certainty: I was on track to be unshackled from student loans and the many other obligations that had for so long ensnared me.

Soon, I’d have the life I’d always hoped for – one where I could afford to do more than tread water. 

~

As time went on, I got more acclimated to the showers, to the point that my brain navigated them on autopilot. I no longer showed up unnecessarily early, and I no longer spent the duration of my time there in a state of worried embarrassment.

We were just humans cleaning our natural bodies, and if a few men took the opportunity to gawk at me now and then, I could live with that. The paychecks kept coming, after all.

Meanwhile, the ‘projects’ Lauren assigned to me continued to be uncomplicated and unchallenging.

One morning, Lauren gave me detailed instructions for picking up a box of luxury cigars from an outlet in midtown and delivering them to Mr. Hoffman. I mentioned that I’d seen Courtney carry out a similar task.

“Who?”

“Courtney. I don’t think I ever got her last name.”

“Oh, right, Courtney!” exclaimed Lauren. “Unfortunately, her employment with us recently came to an end.”

“What happened to her?”

“Don’t be nosy, Monica! That’s confidential information!”

“Right, sorry.”

~

The next morning, I arrived at my desk, my hair still damp, to find Lauren waiting for me. “It’s your quarterly anniversary!” she announced. “To celebrate, I have a *very special* assignment for you.”

The elevator took us all the way down to B3, the lowest level. We traveled through a maze of narrow corridors, all painted in a blinding shade of white, and by rooms full of flasks, Bunsen burners, and men in lab coats. Eventually, we arrived at a janitor cart by a door labeled “CR B3-23.”

“Your task,” Lauren explained, “is to clean the room inside. It needs to be spotless and sanitized.”

“I’m happy to help, but, isn’t the janitorial staff better equipped than me for something like that?”

“No, Monica, you’re *just* the right person for the job!”

I pushed the door open, curious how bad of a mess awaited me.

Nothing about the room’s layout – which consisted of three chairs arranged around the central, circular table – was abnormal.

What *was* abnormal was the *massive* amount of red liquid – parts of it a dark and rusted in color, and others a lighter, vibrant crimson – that dripped from the walls and the ceiling into puddles across the floor.

“So, Monica, do you have any questions?” asked Lauren, totally unphased.

Impulsively, my mouth started to form words like “What the fuck happened in here?” and “Are you asking me to wipe up a crime scene?” But, I recalled what so many people had told me: *don’t be nosy*. I shook my head.

~

I worked late into the night. Thankfully, the cart contained protective gear and multiple cannisters of hydrogen peroxide, but scrubbing out the stains took an exhausting amount of elbow grease.

By the time I’d restored the walls and ceiling to their original, unblemished appearance, my muscles were sore, and my body ached. When I repositioned one of the chairs around the table, I found something on it that I hadn’t noticed before: a thin strip of black velvet fabric.

~

When I checked my phone while riding the metro back, I noticed several missed calls and text messages from Alice.

*I’m so sorry,* I typed out. *I totally forgot about dinner. I got caught up in something at work.*

My phone soon buzzed with a response. *It’s okay. I just feel like I hardly see you anymore.*

~

When I reached the room Lauren had directed me to, I knocked at its door.

“Come in,” greeted Mr. Fitzgerald. He sat at a long, ovular table between two younger men who scribbled furiously onto paper notepads.

One of them handed me a blue collar. The nametag that dangled from it displayed “Monica.”

“What do you want me to do with this?” I asked.

 “Dogs don’t talk,” said Mr. Fitzgerald. “Please take this exercise seriously.”

“Huh?”

“Dogs don’t stand on two legs, either.” 

They stared at me expectantly as I examined my surroundings. An exercise mat stretched across the floor in front of the table. On it stood a flimsy wooden doghouse and bowls containing food and water.

“We’re waiting, Monica.”

*Stop asking questions. Just do what they ask.* I placed the collar around my neck and snapped its two ends together. 

This prompted an excited “*Good*” from Mr. Fitzgerald. He removed something from an outer pocket of his suit and tossed it towards me.

It rolled against my shoe. I unfolded it to see Andrew Jackson’s face and the number “20” displayed in three of its corners. 

I dropped to the ground and crawled towards the dog house.

“Very good!” said Mr. Fitzgerald. Shortly after, two more bills hit the ground. “Now, be a good girl and roll around on the mat.”

The mat felt sticky and damp. Something had been sprayed on it, but I’d learned better than to ask what it was.

“A good girl drinks her water.”

I stuck my face into the bowl and swallowed several gulps of it.

“A good girl eats her food.”

I shot a desperate glance at Mr. Fitzgerald.

“Do you need me to repeat the instruction?” 

For a moment, my body simply refused to commit to the action I ordered it to take. *Fuck it*, I thought, as I mustered the necessary willpower.

I filled my mouth with the disgusting pellets and promptly swallowed, using water from the other bowl to help wash it down. I did this a second time, then a third. The food left behind a putrid, fishy taste, and I barely avoided vomiting.

A sizable pile of bills had formed around me. I glanced up from it to Mr. Fitzgerald, who, thankfully, seemed pleased with me. “That will be all.”

I gathered the money – which I estimated totaled at least $300 – and climbed to my feet. I felt filthy, and the mat’s dampness had transferred to my clothes.

“I have good news for you,” he said.

“Yes?”

“You’ll be receiving another bonus. And, you no longer need to shower in the room's center. You’re now permitted to use the spots around the perimeter. Not the corners, though.”

“Thank you.”

“Also, make sure to clean your clothes thoroughly before wearing them again. You’ll want to avoid touching them, and then touching your face, until then.”

~

When Alice arrived at my place that night, I sensed on her the vague, sulfuric scent that the metro tended to leave on its passengers.

“You’re welcome to use my shower.”

“Huh?”

“Never mind.”

We sat in my bedroom, her at the foot of my bed and me in the swivel chair by the closet. “What’s up with your work clothes?” she asked, motioning to the plastic bag into which I’d stuffed them.

“Oh. Don’t touch them. Some kind of harmful chemical got on them today.”

“That’s terrible.”

“It’s alright.”

“No, it isn’t alright. You can’t let them treat you like that. Why haven’t you quit yet?”

I sighed. I wasn’t sure what to say.

“You haven’t actually applied anywhere else, have you?”

I shrugged. “Look, um, I don’t want to talk about that.”

She shot me a frustrated glance. 

“What *do* you want to talk about?” she asked.

“I found a new place. A condominium. I’ve saved up enough for a down payment.”

For a moment, her face beamed. But her expression changed as she started to understand what I was saying. “And you never mentioned this to me?”

“No.”

“Because you don’t want me to move in with you?”

“Look, Alice, you know that you mean a lot to me, but-”

“Are you telling me that this is it? For us?”

“I, um…”

“I can’t believe this,” she croaked. “Look, Monica, I’ll do it. I’ll stop trying to be a writer. I’ll get a real job, and I’ll pull my own weight. I’ll even do night school at the community college like you suggested, if that’s what it takes. We can make it work.”

“Sometimes, in life, hurdles come up, and people take different paths to navigate around them. It doesn’t mean-”

“Did you get that from some HR person? Monica...we were happy together, and now…” She bawled. I brought her a tissue. 

~

After she left, I couldn’t settle down. 

Eventually, I wandered into the frigid air outside. I hailed a taxi. When the driver asked me for a destination, I impulsively identified my workplace.

I soon sat alone at the bar. Two men chatted in the booth behind me about some kind of legal matter.

“So that’s how this all started? Scrubbing our internet presence, the new decontamination procedures, everything? Just because of a pesky lawsuit filed by some [low-level troublemaker](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/lg323q/the_zippers_on_peoples_skin_are_becoming_undone/)?”

“The massive judgment she got somehow wasn’t enough for her – she wants it all to be fully in the public record, too. No redactions or anything. It’s giving legal a headache. We’ll see what the appellate court decides.”

I’d downed two drinks when someone took the seat next to me.

“Mind if I join you?” asked Mr. Morgan.

~

During the ride to his place, I imagined conversations between Mr. Morgan and the other executives. In one version, I was ridiculed and ultimately fired for going along with what he wanted. In another, I met with the same fate as a result of turning him down.

He took my hand and led me to his building’s central elevator. “Look,” he said, after the doors closed, “I know I talk a big game about being on my ‘good side.’ But, in all seriousness, I know there’s a power differential here. You can leave right now, and I won’t hold it against you. You’re totally free to go.”

I’d already made up my mind. I needed something, anything, to take my mind off of Alice, and I yearned to be desired. 

I spoke confidently. “I understand, and I want this.”

~

We got off on the penthouse level. “Frank Hoffman has the unit down there,” said Mr. Morgan, motioning to the far end of the hallway. “But I doubt we’ll be seeing him this late.”

He unlocked the door and flipped on the lights. I slowly took in the extravagant sight around me: the astounding vista provided by the oversized windows; the sleek marble countertops; the private elevator; and the abundance of sculptures and artwork.

He noticed me gazing at a clear acrylic grand piano. As he played a slow, classy piece, I sat back on a corner sectional sofa and closed my eyes.

Sure, this wasn’t my life. I was only an interloper; a tourist. I didn’t really belong here. But, for a moment, I felt like I did – like maybe, just maybe, I’d have a place like this someday.

~

When we got to this bedroom, I put in a little bit of effort, but I didn’t go overboard with it. I sensed he didn’t need that.

Before long, he croaked, heaved, and collapsed against me. As he caught his breath, he held me tightly and whispered something. A name, I think. Maybe ‘Carol’.

I asked him what he’d said.

“Huh?” He sounded startled and quickly loosened his grip. “Nothing, sorry. You good?”

I nodded before I was sure what he meant.

“I, um, I’m going to wash up.” He swiftly proceeded to the nearest bathroom.

I soon followed him there, where he showered under a faucet that extended out of an ornate quartz wall slab.

He told me he didn’t mind if I cleaned up in there. But, when I approached the shower’s glass door, he instructed me not to enter. 

“Oh. I can shower after you, then.”

“No, it’s…it’s not for you.”

“What do you mean?”

He responded in an exasperated tone. “All these questions. You all never learn.”

“Sorry.”

“Look, um, I need to be at work early tomorrow.”

I didn’t know what to say to that, so I just stood there, awkwardly biting my lip as my mood sank into a feeling of bitter emptiness.

“Do you, like, need anything?” he asked. “A ride home, money, or something?”

I got dressed and left. As I waited for the elevator outside, a figure approached from the other end of the hall. I recognized her as Scarlett, Courtney’s recent replacement. From the streaks  of makeup running down her face, I could tell that she’d recently been crying.

“It’s going to be okay,” I told her, although I wasn’t sure why. 

We were halfway down – the floor indicator read ‘56’ – when Scarlett turned to me and spoke in a weak, broken voice. “Can I-” 

She gave up on words, but I still understood her on an intuitive level. I let her lean into me and held her as she sobbed against my shoulder.

In the months that followed, the consequences I worried about never came to pass. Neither Mr. Morgan nor any of the other executives treated me differently. My workdays maintained their pattern of tedious waits between demeaning assignments.

My bank account continued to grow. Soon after I settled comfortably into my small condominium, I began eying listings for bigger, better living spaces elsewhere.

One day, Lauren explained to me that a new employee named Peter would soon begin. “He’ll be performing a role similar to yours. As I’ll be out of the office tomorrow, I want you to greet him and show him the ropes.”

When I arrived at the office the next morning, Peter was already waiting for me in the lobby. He was appropriately well-dressed. His lanky frame and sandy hair reminded me of my high school boyfriend. “You’re here early,” I said, shaking his hand.

“First day, you know,” he said through a nervous laugh. “So, um, Ms. Mackerly never really explained what it is I’ll be doing here.”

“Oh,” I responded. “A little of this, a little of that. Like, sometimes I get coffee for the executives, and other times I assist with testing products. Once, they even had me pretend to be a dog and roll around on some chemical. My skin burned a bit after that, but it went away after a few days.”

The chuckle that followed felt hollow. He wasn’t sure if I was joking.

He followed me up to the locker room. “What the hell?” he said as he absorbed his surroundings and the dozens of nude people inside. “What is this?”

“Just a shower, silly,” I said, as I started to undress. “There’s a spot in the middle of the room for you to use.”

“I’m not doing that. What's wrong with you?”

“It’s *required*, Peter. Everyone has to do it, every day. It’s important to have a clean workplace. Don’t be shy.”

He backed away from me. “No, no, I’m out of here.”

“Peter, please, don’t go,” I begged. “It’s too late to turn back.”

Peter ignored me and fled to the elevator. Soon after he pressed the ‘down’ button, its doors opened to reveal David and Donna, who swiftly grabbed him and dragged him away.

Over the following months, I answered the questions I received about Peter as Lauren had instructed me. “He just walked out during orientation. I never saw him again.”

It is a bleak, rainy day. Flash floods warnings buzz on my phone, and the wind nearly rips the umbrella out of my hand as I scamper inside.

Lauren comes to my desk. She promises a ‘reward’ for my exceptional performance.

She takes me to the lounge. “Not only can you now enter the main area, but you now have access to the VIP section as well.”

She brushes the curtain aside. Executives are gathered around a small bar. Mr. Morgan hands me a drink.

There’s another curtain at the far end of the room. “It’s showtime!” yells Mr. Hoffman.

Lauren pulls a cord. The curtain spreads apart, revealing a familiar young man.

Peter’s mouth is gagged. His body is bound to a wooden circle attached to the wall behind him. His arms and legs, both riddled with scars, are tied to edges behind him such that his body forms an ‘X’ shape.

Peter makes eye contact with me. He emits a muffled cry for help. On the floor beneath him is a crate containing a spiked bat and a stained handsaw.

Scarlett appears. She hands Mr. Hoffman a wooden box. He opens it and gives a satisfied nod. “Now scram,” he says. Scarlett dutifully obeys.

At Mr. Hoffman’s request, I look into the box. It contains a dozen darts carefully arranged in foam indentations.

“Take one."

The one I select is heavier than I expected, and it has a long, extremely sharp tip.

“What do you want me to do with it?”

 “What do you think? Throw it at your target.”

I freeze.

“Think she’ll give up like Courtney did?” says someone.

Lauren speaks to me in a soft, firm voice. “Monica, you need to do this.”

“I can’t.”

“Let me show you.” Lauren announces that she’s giving a demonstration. 

She takes a dart and approaches Peter, stopping at a line of green tape about two meters from him. She draws back the dart and rapidly releases it.

Peter whimpers as the dart embeds itself in his right arm. A line of blood forms, dripping onto the carpet.

The crowd cheers.

“You see?” says Lauren. “It’s easy.”

The executives chant my name as I slowly step forward. I want to throw the dart at Lauren or Mr. Hoffman. I want to untie Peter and escort him out of the building.

But, I’m terrified of what will happen to me if I do anything other than comply. Plus, I’ve come so far, and I’ve lost so much along the way.

I close my eyes and try to calm my nerves. I think about who I once was. The optimism I once had – not just about others, but about myself, too. All the nights Alice and I spent together.

We haven’t talked since I told her it was over. I’ve been tempted, many times, to call her, to apologize, and to try to make things work again. But I’ve long known it was too late to do that, even before she recently started posting pictures with another girl.

“Hurry it up already!” someone yells, snapping me out of my reverie. 

I have to act. What if I miss on purpose? Would that fool anyone?

On the other hand, what if I just did it? I tried to warn Peter. He has only himself to blame for his predicament.

My arm shakes. I let out a roar, draw back, and release.

The dart grazes against Peter’s shoulder before lodging into the wood behind him. Judging by the lack of blood, it didn’t puncture his skin.

The executives hiss and boo as I return.

“She missed on purpose!” says one.

“No, she tried,” says another. “Look at how close it was.” 

Mr. Hoffman holds out the open box. “Take another.”

I look at him, and then at the leering, awful faces of everyone else, before forcing a smile. I speak emphatically. “Maybe next time.”

A silence sweeps over the room. An eternity passes in the moments that follow.

Finally, Mr. Hoffman nods. “Next time,” he repeats.

As I exit, the crowd’s cheering resumes, followed by cries of pain.

“You’re gonna get soaked!” warns David as I open the lobby doors. Indeed, with no raincoat, I quickly find myself drenched. But I keep walking anyway, with no particular destination in mind.

I watch as standing water forms a small rapid on the nearby street. It leads to a storm drain, where the liquid swirls and sinks.

I imagine myself lying down on that road and letting the dirty water sweep over me. Maybe I’d emerge from it restored to the person I’d once been, rebaptized by the pollutants and street grime I’ve spent so long scrubbing from my body.

I shake my head and chide myself for indulging in such thoughts. That person was long gone now, and there was no bringing her back.

A luxury condo building towers over me. I glance up at it, take a deep breath, and begin the walk back to [work](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeaceSim/).
