My friends invited me to go camping for a mutual friend's 25th birthday. I'm hoping they are having fun, but I'm definitely not. I'm certainly trying to do my best and it is pretty sweet that they invited me to tag along because Joey (the friend who's birthday it is) wanted me specifically to come and I don't want to let him down... but I can never do anything except count the days until we're headed home now that the skies are dark from the snowstorms. I tagged along because I'm not sure how much I buy into "The Twisted Walker" and what happens at night if the sky is dark. And what happens if it remembers you.

But last night, after being pestered by one of my friends to come outside to join the bonfire, I shared my story around the campfire. Joey was really in the mood for a scary story, and I figured I owed them all a bit of an explanation for my behavior. So, I sat down around the fire, ignoring the feeling that we were being watched from the dark tree line, and did the familiar setting ups of a scary story before getting into it.

There’s a story when I was growing up called “The Twisted Walker.” There’s a lot of hunters and woods in Carroll County so it could have taken place there, but no one knows for sure. And I always kinda liked that because that means it could take place anywhere and that makes it a little scarier. In any forest or wooded area. But growing up, I mainly liked the uncertainty because it meant that there was a chance it wasn’t taking place in Carroll County. Even now though, I work right next to a wooded area in Maryland and have a view of it from my office window. And with it getting dark earlier this time of year, I keep thinking about this story when I’m walking to my car at the end of my shift. Anyways, I’m pretty sure it’s just a story for hunters to scare them and make sure they are paying attention or remaining respectful of nature when hunting. Or maybe animal rights activists or nature preservationists (like my camp counselors at outdoor school) told it to keep kids from growing up to hunt in the woods. Or maybe it’s all true. But here we go…

I never really believed it because I lived in Carroll County too but in the southern area in the suburb neighborhoods. Granted, I would feel uneasy while walking through the woods when I was younger like something was watching me. And who knows, maybe something was. But I never saw any weird tracks. Nothing out of the ordinary. Except for the time that I went to “Outdoor Camp” which was in the northern area of Carroll County. I say “was” because the camp has been closed for about ten years along with the surrounding area.

In middle school, all the kids in sixth grade would go to Camp Hashawa for Outdoor School for a week. When I went, the kids in the cabin and I had a hard time sleeping during the latter half of the week because we kept hearing noises at night. Not right outside our cabin, but definitely from somewhere in the camp area. When I asked some of the high school camp counselors, they told me about “The Twisted Walker.”

Every night that it’s dark, if there's a new moon or it's cloudy (like it was during the latter half of my week at the camp because of snowstorms and like it had been last night when telling this story), people in the rural areas of northern Carroll County can hear noises out in the woods or right outside their houses. Uncanny voices and shrieks, snarls, pained bellows, and sometimes scratches and knocks if it got close enough to their house. And everyone in the area knows to stay inside and make sure to lock your doors and cover your windows if you hear the noises. But if you had forgotten to lock your doors by the time you hear noises, it’s probably too late. There have been stories of people missing from their homes with front doors left thrown open or shattered bedroom windows next to where they had been sleeping if their blinds weren’t drawn. Regardless of whether someone is taken or not, the morning after hearing the noises in the night, people always find tracks in the ground.

The accounts of the tracks change a lot. Some people say that the tracks look like big pawprints from a canine or a big feline animal or a bear. Some people say that the tracks are cloven like from something with hooves. Some people say that they look like human footprints. But everyone always agrees that there is something off about them.

This freaked out me and a couple of the other kids in my cabin for the remainder of our time at camp, but we all thought it was just a really creepy scary story and/or a prank. At the end of the week, we played a fun survival game in the woods even though there was snow all over the ground. I was hiding near the end of the campgrounds around some dense pine trees and a meadow just beyond the tree line and the camp border. That’s when I found the animal tracks that led from underneath one of the trees and out into the meadow. I can’t remember what the tracks looked like except that I just knew that they were from a predator and something about them seemed wrong. And even though they led out into the meadow and away from camp, I felt unsafe. As usual, like I was being watched nearby. But I learned something about that sensation in recent years. It's your brain picking up on something you either saw or heard, but your consciousness is trying to catch up. I should have realized I wasn't alone.

But nothing happened. The game continued and no kids went missing or anything spooky like that. And I completely forgot about the tracks and the story for years until around high school. That was when kids DID go missing. That’s when a volunteer camp counselor from a neighboring high school went missing. And that’s when the camp was closed.

At this point, Joey's girlfriend and a few others went back inside from the fire. Either I had been doing a good job with my story and it was scary enough for them to want to go back inside... or my story was boring. Regardless, I apologize. But I am also glad that they went indoors. Joey and a few others however were still down to hear the rest of it so I continued with what apparently happened ten years ago.

From what I heard, after some kids went missing one week during Outdoor School, police had found what they said were animal tracks near the cabin of the missing kids and camp counselor the next day. They assumed it was maybe a bear or wolf or something and had animal control search the area and find the animal. Those who did come back said they followed the tracks in the direction they were heading, even the fresh ones that showed up during the search, but couldn’t find anything. The ones who didn’t come back apparently did but they were never seen again, so no one knows. The camp then hired professional hunters to try and find this animal. The hunters tried to hunt it down, but when the same results occurred, the camp was closed.

I knew this was the part that Joey would want to hear so I continued on with the urban legend that was spread around for years since the camp closed.

Now, the rest of the story goes like this. The camp, being county property, was closed and restricted access to everyone except the owner who lived on the location. The owner was a very weird old man who had been there for years. Strangely enough, he had offered very little information during the investigation and claimed he had never heard or seen anything unusual in the area. I call bullshit on that as most people do, but he had been monitored in questioning at the same time a couple of the animal control members had gone missing as well, so do with that information as you will. 

A while after the camp had closed, a couple stubborn hunters with what I can assume were ego issues were still frustrated about not being able to find the animal. The owner reached out to them and invited them to come back to the campgrounds and continue/finish the hunt. The hunters who agreed consisted of a seasoned veteran to hunting, his daughter who was following in his footsteps, and two of the father’s friends with similar hunting experience. They spent days tracking the animal’s prints but couldn’t find anything. At one point, they found a cave that the tracks led to, but when searching inside it, they found nothing. At night, however, they kept hearing noises. Almost as if whatever it was kept taunting them that they couldn’t find it. And with each night, it got bolder. 

One night, the seasoned hunter and his daughter were sleeping in a cabin that the owner let them stay in for the duration of their hunting. The other two hunters slept in another one nearby. That’s when the father and the daughter were woken up to the sound of something scratching the cabin wall from the outside. The father heard his daughter scream, and she told him that she had seen something in the dark outside looking in through the window at her. Guess she had left her blinds open. The daughter’s bravery had left her and she was terrified, but the father was determined and started getting his gear together. Just as he was grabbing his gun, they heard a loud thud coming from the roof of the cabin. He ran outside and looked up, but it was too dark to see anything on the roof. He did, however, find fresh tracks at the base of the cabin that led away into the dark.

The father told his daughter to stay put since she was pretty shaken up and that he was going off to find it. He was convinced she’d be safe since he assumed whatever it was had jumped down from the roof and ran off into the woods. Despite the daughter's protests, he left and the daughter was all alone. She remained on the porch of the cabin, conflicted on whether she should follow her dad or not. In the silence, she kept thinking she could hear heavy breathing and a kind of hissing/clicking noise from somewhere in the dark around her. She looked in every direction and couldn’t find anything around the cabin, but the noise continued as if it were right on top of her.

Scared that the animal might have doubled back and was nearby, she went inside, locked the door, and closed the window blinds. Throughout the night, she kept hearing noises. The cabin kept groaning. The hissing/clicking noise continued. At one point, she heard a loud thud somewhere nearby. Eventually, she started hearing knocking at her door. But each time she called out to see if it was her dad, no one responded. This continued until almost sunrise.

The next morning, her father returned and she told him everything about that night. He could barely take in any of what she was saying though regardless of whether he believed it or not. He was pissed because he searched and followed the animal tracks all night but still didn’t find anything. That’s when they saw the other tracks. There were fresh tracks in the ground circling their cabin. This worsened the confusion and frustration of the father who had followed the tracks the whole time and had never seen them return towards camp. And then they heard the news. The owner rushed over to tell them that the cabin with the other two hunters had been broken into and nearly destroyed. Despite them having locked their door the whole night. One hunter was incomprehensible in a delirious state, needing to be taken away in an ambulance. The other was missing. All he left behind was signs of a struggle and a blood trail leading into the woods.

With the other two hunters being his close friend and hunting buddies for years, the father was furious. Against her insistence to not and his own exhaustion, he took his daughter with him into the woods, following the blood trail to finish this. They searched all day until the sun started to sink in the sky, unable to pick up the track again or any tracking signs that made sense. In fact, it appeared that the tracks were bipedal, disproving pretty much all the assumptions of a four-legged animal the hunters had since made. Finally, they followed the trail of blood and picked up the animal tracks again next to the cave they had found. The tracks were coming out from the cave (the freshest he had seen yet) and there was also the smell of death in the air. The father knew this meant he was on the right track. But after hearing hours of pleading throughout the day from his daughter, he gave in. He told his daughter to stay put as she had been wanted to all day and that he would finish it himself. Convinced of her safety and promising he wouldn’t go far as the animal seemed to be nearby, the father followed the tracks that led away from the cave and further into the woods, once again leaving his daughter behind.

The tracks went on for longer than the hunter had expected. Convinced that whatever this thing had been was close by due to how fresh the tracks were, he continued following them the way they were headed. Further ahead and deeper into the woods. His heart sank when he realized the pools of blood on the ground were getting larger and fresher, but at least this was another sign he was getting close.  Holding onto this hope, he ignored the fact that the tracks seemed to be getting fainter and less fresh, which again made no sense. Finally, he came into a clearing and found something. But it wasn’t the animal. It was his missing hunter friend, torn apart and openly bleeding on the ground and breathing his last remaining rattling breaths. The hunter ran to his side and tried to examine his wounds, but his friend instead grabbed him by the shoulder with his last bit of strength.

“I… it… back… twisted… it’s…” the friend had faintly gurgled, unable to make a sentence. 

“Just try to stay still,” the hunter responded even though he knew it was no use.

That’s when his friend with his final strength grabbed him, pulled him close, and shouted in manic fear, “Backwards! It’s legs! Inverted! Twisted from the waist down! IT WALKS BACKWARDS!”

As his friend’s grip released and he fell silent, everything finally made sense to the hunter. He left his friend and sprinted back the way he had come, following the tracks on the ground the way he should have all along. But when he got back to the spot he had left his daughter next to the mouth of the cave where the tracks had been the freshest, she was nowhere to be seen. All that was left behind has her shotgun, bent and thrown aside in the nearby bushes.

Honestly, I’m not sure how much of the story I believe. Apparently, the hunter had come back home to tell everyone the story before disappearing. Maybe he went back out there to find The Twisted Walker to get revenge. Maybe it remembered him and came to find him first. I don’t like the idea of the second option because the one other thing I remember on the last day of outdoor school is that, even though I saw the tracks in the snow leading off into the meadow, I couldn’t stop fainting hearing the sound of breathing and a clicking/hissing noise coming from the dense trees the tracks had come from. Maybe it remembers me too.

I’ll tell this story now because they are talking about reopening Camp Hashawa after ten years. The owner, still living there, had shot down a bear (even though it looked more like it had been mauled to death) and claimed it was the animal. He convinced the county that it was safe for the kids and camp counselors to return now. I’ll never go back there though or anywhere near northern Carroll County, if that’s even where The Twisted Walker actually is. Regardless, I’ll never go out at night when the sky is dark or cloudy. And if I ever see animal tracks in the woods leading off into the woods in front of me, I’ll never dare look behind me.

And with that, we all went inside. We didn't feel most comfortable being outside at that time. Everyone hung out for a little bit longer inside, but I just said I was tired and went to my bed to sleep. I don't actually sleep though. I didn't last night, and I probably won't tonight. Or the next night. Instead, I'll be straining my ears to hear the voices, shrieks, bellows, and snarls I've been hearing in the distance for the past few days. And I'll be listening again for the scratches and knocks I'm pretty sure I heard last night. And I'll be waiting to hear that hissing/clicking noise again. If I'm lucky to survive tonight too, I'm sure I'll see those tracks in the snow outside the cabin the tomorrow morning.

Hope you are having a good time so far, Joey. Happy birthday. And although I'll never say it to your face, fuck you for bringing me along on this trip dude.
