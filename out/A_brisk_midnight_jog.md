It was an exceptionally cold night, a brisk jog, I had been taking. An Icy burn filled my lungs after every waking breath. Filling my mouth with the taste of iron.
My limbs quaked and felt as though they had been numb from the cold. 
I decided to take a small stop and sit in a bench and collect myself while also simultaneously changing my music to a different genre for maximum efficiency. I didn't expect to be out as long as I had been already, but I guess I forgot how out of shape I had been. I pulled out my wired apple ear buds and listened to the world around me for a moment while I started up at the stars. Living on the outskirts of town, I wasn't surprised to see all the beautiful stars as plain as day. When I realized something. It's... Silent, too silent. Usually I would hear the occasional melody of barking dogs, crickets or coyotes howling in the night, but nothing. Not a damn thing.

I decided to shrug it off and put in my music to continue my jog and did just that, at this point it was now almost 11:00 and was just about pitch black outside, and my anxiety began heightening, the silence wasn't helping, it was deafening. Louder than any scream could ever be. Only stopped by my earbuds, but it's presence still remained, I could feel it in my spine and weighing heavily on my body as cold chills and icy winds. It was then I felt the un deniable feeling of someone watching me, heavily laying their gaze upon my back.

I stopped for a moment, retrieved my left earbud and began turning around to hopefully see another jogger or a friendly passer-by but there was nothing, nothing but the eerie silence that crept it's way back into my ear. Filling me with dread, because the moment I turned around I felt the eyes now lazering into my back once again. I took out my other earbud and spun around expecting someone standing there but nobody was there. Not a soul in my path all the houses lights were off aside from the occasional street light there was nothing. If it hadn't been for this dreadful feeling of anxiety it would actually be quite the Serene experience.

All alone, beautiful stars and highly visible constellations formed above me I kept my earbuds out this time honestly hoping to a Ã hear something other than silence, but there was still nothing. I could feel a strange tension building in the dark cold air. When the silence was broken, broken by a tree up ahead, once I caught gaze apon it I noticed the odd part, it was growing out of the road, it was a massive tree an old oak tree. An odd sense of familiarity washed over me, I somehow knew this tree. It's bright green leaves were glowing and even casting beams of sun through them as if we had been in broad daylight, infact the whole tree had that affect and was swaying in an absent wind. 

It was surreal and uncanny to say the least. It was affected by a wind and bright sun that weren't there. When I saw... Myself? Hauling a large black bag on a tarp with a rope tied to either end which I was holding, I had seemingly been climbing a hill up to this tree, but the road had obstructed it. When it hit me. I knew where that tree was. I watched myself unzip the bag revealing a woman dressed in dark casual apparel, she wore a dark heavy metal hoodie and black sweats. Her face was pale and eyes empty, expressionless. And cold, cold as her once pink lips now turned to a pale blue ish grey. Unmistakable to that of a corpses. I left back down the hill and I began to walk a bit closer when I heard a light cracking of bones shattering back into place and contorting beyond their natural limits. The body stood up and looked at me. It called out my name and took a step that firmly connected with the concrete of the road. Once it did her ancle bone snapped and collapsed in on itself only for her to keep walking as if unfazed by it. She took another step and all the bones in her legs collapsed and she went limp. She was stiff and cold as the limbs of that oak tree in the peak of winter.

It was then the feeling of being watched returned but this time from beside me. I quickly turned on my phones flashlight and shined it into the field beside me and to my horror there was nothing. But the feeling was now from where the girl was.
I turned back to her but she was gone all that remained were her torn clothes and a beast standing above where she once was. It stood in an odd way, it's back legs curled in under her chest and back with recurved leg bones, it was sitting like it was hunched over and crouching. It's arms were extremely long and thin as well and dawned massive hands with five long dark fingers. It had a moose skull as a head dawning the horns of one as well, it's chest still had breasts and the same tattoos she had had were still on he body in the correct locations, they had just been stretched and contorted in a painful looking manner. Her long dark black hair still sprouted from beneath and around the skull. Her neck was long and had ridged spinal bones sticking up just under the skin, buc it's back was worse, curled up like a frightened cat, it's back was filled with large spinal protrusions reaching peak length in the middle of her back and shortening back down as they reached her tailbone. She was extremely skinny as well.

I stood in front of the beast unaware of my next move. It stood tall on its hind legs reaching about 10ft tall in total.it looked down at me and without losing eye contact, it shook some flies from its body. It's skin swayed as if loosely attached to the bone as the creature shook.
It opened its massive mouth and uttered a terrifying phrase. Something I can never un hear. It said my full name first middle and last, and said "My bones, they hurt. I feel them moving." Her voice sounded strained as if she was screaming for hours, but it was definitely hers. "IM SORRY! I UHM. I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT!"
the creature took another two steps forward and dropped down back into crouched position, it's face now inches away from mine. Just then the mouth opened wide, wider than possible and the tongue lay flat against the bottom of its jaw, drool dripped from the top jaw and I heard a light squelching sound from inside its throat. To my horror I saw what looked like a nose emerging from the deep dark throat of the beast, followed shortly by the girls full head. she looked alive again, just like normal. I was too Frozen and terror to move 

She simply said "I don't believe it. I could see the greed and lust in your dirty eyes as you killed me from the inside out. You are scum." before grabbing a hold of me with her large hands and digging her thumb into my chest I felt them effortlessly slide under my ribcage and pry it apart. I could feel the cold night air fill my emptied out body. I felt it on my intestines, and I felt my muscles clenching in the cold air. I looked down with the last remaining life I had and saw her face bathed in my blood and her horns wrapped with my intestines. She then dropped me onto the ground, finally putting an end to my pain the moment my head collided with the asphalt.  






NOTE:
(Part two HIGHLY POSSIBLE. depending on the success of this story I will be making this a series, I have written about this creature of mine MANY times, although if I get into a series be cautious of S/A and dark topics in the same vein. There is lots of background work to be done and I have a whole thing about these creatures and would love to make a whole story if y'all enjoy this. Just lmk in the comments thread)
