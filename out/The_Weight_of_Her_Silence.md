My family doesn’t like to talk about the deaths.

If you ask my mom, she’ll say it was stress. If you ask my aunties, they’ll lower their voices and tell you it was because America was too cold for Hmong souls. But if you had asked my grandpa before he died, he would have told you it was her.

My grandpa came to the U.S. from Laos in the late 1970s. He had been a soldier during the Secret War. He fought in the jungle. He lost brothers whose bodies were never buried properly. When he arrived in America, he brought the war with him, folded neatly into his chest like a second heart.

Back then, Hmong men were dying in their sleep. Healthy men. Young men. They would go to bed and never wake up. Doctors called it sudden unexplained death. The elders called it **dab tsog**, the crushing spirit.

My grandpa used to wake up screaming. The doctors said it was that new thing called post traumatic stress disorder. 

Sometimes he stayed with us when I was little. I’d hear him gasping in the night, whispering prayers under his breath, his voice thin and terrified. Once, when I was about eight, I asked him why he never slept on his back.

He stared at me for a long time before answering.

“She sits there,” he said, pressing into his chest. “If I lie flat, she can sit.”

I laughed. I was a kid, and it sounded like a ghost story. He didn’t laugh back.

“She looks like a woman,” he continued. “But her face is wrong. Too smooth. No age. She smells like old leaves and blood. She comes when you forget who you are.”

That was the first time he told me about her.

He said she had followed him from Laos, hunting for a husband. When she came, he could not move. He could not cry out. All he could feel was her weight settling over him, and the slow, terrible certainty that she would not leave.

“She learns you,” he said. “She waits.”

My grandpa died in his sleep when I was thirteen.

The doctors said it was his heart. My mom said it was peaceful. But I remembered his words, and the way his bedsheets were twisted tight, like he’d been fighting something invisible.

After the funeral, my family burned incense and tied red strings around our wrists. Protection, they said. Tradition. I wore mine until it frayed and fell off.

I didn’t start dreaming about her until years later.

At first, it was just the feeling of being watched. Then came the paralysis. The familiar heaviness. The panic. I told myself it was stress. Sleep paralysis. Science had explanations now.

But science didn’t explain the details.

The woman in my dreams doesn’t move much. She doesn’t need to. She stands at the edge of the room. Her skin is pale in a way that doesn’t belong to any living person. Her hair is long and black, tangled like it’s been dragged through the jungle.

And she smells exactly like my grandpa said she would.

At first, there was only silence. Just the chilling weight of her presence. But as time passed, she began to speak.

Not out loud. Not with words.

She fills my head with images. Me and a beautiful Hmong woman running through the open mountain fields of Laos. Us washing clothes together in the river, tending crops under the sun. Me standing alone on a narrow dirt road, waiting for her to come back to me.

A few weeks ago, she leaned in closer than ever before.

I felt her hands press into my sternum, right where my grandpa used to point. Her face hovered inches from mine, and I felt her cold breath wash across my skin.

I woke up gasping, my chest aching like it had been crushed.

This morning, my mom called me for no reason. Just to check in. Before hanging up, she hesitated.

“I had a dream about your grandpa,” she said. “He looked worried and asked about you.”

I haven’t slept since.

Because tonight, when I closed my eyes for just a second, I swear I felt the mattress dip, as if someone had just sat down.

And I remembered something my grandpa said right before he died.

“She doesn’t kill you,” he whispered.  
“She silently weights until you belong to her.”

If you’re reading this and you come from a family that fled Laos after the secret war, tie a red string around your wrist tonight.

And whatever you do…

**Don’t sleep on your back.**
