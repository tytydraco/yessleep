There’s something really wrong about my old job that still terrifies me.

It’s early May when I get in touch with an old buddy of mine. We hadn’t talked since freshman year but I got a message on Instagram DM from him saying ‘Hey’.

I responded with ‘Hey man.’

‘Didn’t think you’d respond lol. Anyway I was wondering whether you were in need of a job.’

I said ‘No, why are you asking me lmao’

‘Ah shit. My boss said if I can refer someone to the job I’d get a huge pay increase. How much do you get payed?’

‘Sorry dude. I get paid 19$/Hour.’ I replied. I was kinda uncomfortable being asked my wage. I’ve always been very uptight about my money as my dad was an accountant but he lost his mind years ago. 

‘Dude, you’re gonna want this job so bad. It’s simple. Work at a grocery store and get paid 60$/Hour.’

My eyes lit up. This seemed too good to be true but my rent was slowly increasing by the minute it felt like, so this would change my life around. 

‘Lemme sleep on it’ I said to my ‘friend’ as I didn’t want to seem desperate for it. 

I’ll keep it brief and say I didn’t sleep that night. I was buzzed for a new opportunity to turn my luck around. Looking back I know how stupid I was. 

But anywho, I text back back at 6:00 AM sharp and said

‘Yeah I’ll take it.’ 

He didn’t respond. He just hit a thumbs up reaction and then sent me the details.

‘Shift: 7:00 AM - 1:00PM’ and the adress ‘666 Phillips Lane’. No uniform, no rules. Just show up to a random grocery store in the middle of nowhere and work for 6 Hours and get paid 600 dollars a day.


SHIFT 1:

Shift one was odd. It was just me. My friend was nowhere, no manager, nothing. Odd, I thought but I was happy that I could get some alone time away from my roommates back in Maine and sit in the northern snow. 

The first customer came in. I always called him Ayrton Senna (not to his face) as he lead a weird little black goat around (I’m an F1 fan and I love Senna). He never spoke just ordered: 6 Packets of Bacon, 6 cans of soda and 6 Loafs of bread. Every week on a Monday without fail. He was weird. He let his goat stumble around and looked for his usual items. 

The second and last customer came in, I called him Prince Charming. He was charismatic but annoying always trying to sell me things. He only ordered: 2 Beers, 2 Steaks and 2 Bottles of Red Wine. He was an interesting man. 



Shift 2: This is where things started happening.

Started off this surprisingly sunny Tuesday morning with a new customer who I called Merlin (as in the old English legend). Merlin had a tattoo of a dragon on his wrist and a bellowing deep voice. He normally got 6 bottles of water and that’s all. 

The second customer of that day was a farmer. He carried around a pitchfork and was dressed in a tight red leather. He consistently came in every day and was basically the only ‘daily’ customer. He’d come in and buy a pentagram necklace that was for some reason always in stock. Not sure why but I think I know now.

I got a delivery in from some random dude every Sunday of new stock. He left it next to me and got back into his truck. Never spoke once. 

The store closed. I was stocking shelves when I heard weird chanting from the back of the store. I thought some kids were messing around so went around and saw candles on the floor. Lit in a circle. I didn’t think much of it. Just kids trying to make me nervous. In the middle of the circle was 18 Gold Coins arranged into groups of 6. I’m a Christian so I was kinda freaked out by this. However I just once again, swallowed my own terror and chalked it up to ‘kids’.


Nothing happened for about a month until the 6th of June. 

This was exactly one month after the candles incident. 

The day started normally. It was a Friday when everyone came In. I was shocked. This had never happened before. Everyone got their items and walked to the back of the store. The Farmer, Merlin, Prince Charming and Ayrton Senna. The formed a circle and drew a pentagram on the floor. I noped the fuck out. Got my keys, my bag and B lined for my car but it had been graffitied. 

666.

That’s when it all clicked. The signs were all there to stay away from this job but nope. My greedy ass couldn’t resist.

The adress. The people. It all pointed towards something evil. A large red glow possessed the store. I opened my car door, started the engine and fucking charged all the way back to Augusta. I arrived in Augusta to find a cross on my apartment door. Upside down. I noped the fuck out of there too. 

I now live in NYC. I’ve never told anyone about this. The weird thing is, I see the customers around the city. It’s probably hallucinations or PTSD but they are now watching me. All the time.

Now I think about it, my buddy always had an upside down cross as a necklace. I’m an idiot I know. 

 I will never go back to Maine. Never.
