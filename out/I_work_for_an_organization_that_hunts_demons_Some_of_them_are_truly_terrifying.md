I‘m not supposed to be sharing this. All of the work we do is strictly confidential, and for good reason too… If everyone knew about the things we deal with there would be mass hysteria or panic. It is better to enforce the lie that there is nothing abnormal… That the supernatural simply doesnt exist. However the things I encounter in the field are disturbing, and I feel like I would go insane if I continue to keep it to myself.

I work for an independent research firm that deals with the para-natural. Most people believe ghosts and demons are spirits and supernatural entities. That is far from reality. They are very much ‘alive’, and are made of flesh and blood…. at least in their corporeal states but it is not entirely correct to describe them as ‘biological’ entities. At least how we use that term. Almost everything about them defy our present understanding of biology. However they fit neatly into their own phylogenetic tree, as if they are shadows of our evolution, or as one of my colleagues puts it ‘a parody of the human experience.’

Many of these entities are content with keeping to themselves. Provided of course you dont go intruding on the abandoned mansions and secluded forests they inhabit. Invariably some idiot ends up stumbling into their territory and getting themselves killed. Then local police are sent to investigate and they end up calling us or similar organizations. You probably heard of the scp foundation? Well we are like them but we specialize in the things colloquially known as demons and ghosts while they are more generalized. In a way you could think of us as an independent extension of the scp, rather than a completely separate thing. Anyways, we relocate the entities if possible and if it proves too much of a hassle we simply put up warning signs and make up some mundane cause of death for the victims. Contrary to common belief most ghosts are not the tortured souls of humans that died a violent death. They are distinct creatures with many species and are similar in habit to squatters, or vermin. They move into secluded areas… but are always proximal to humanity, always in the periphery of civilization.

Its not known why they are attracted to human presence. There are many hypotheses, and one particular compelling one is they simply relish human fear and suffering.

One recent case I was assigned to a field team dispatched to neutralize an alleged ’Dawn Weeper’, a gynomorphic Category four, Physical. (gynomorphic is a term we use to describe entities that anatomically resemble women regardless of their sex, category 4 is a moderate threat, the higher the number the more dangerous, and ‘physical’, ‘spectral’ or ‘phasmopsychic’ refer to the natural state(s) of an an entity.)

It was rare for them to send researchers like me… usually field work is completed entirely by the Martial department, but some expeditions require scientific advise. I recall the team leader was particular in the fact he is a Spriggan... yes you heard me right. A Spriggan is a european relative of the wendigo. Contrary to popular belief many ’demons’  integrate well into society. Of course some spriggans and wendigo do live up to their kind’s bloodthirsty reputation, but they are not a monolith and many are content with consuming raw animal flesh rather than prey on humans. Contrary to common knowledge wendigo aren’t always terrifying gaunt monstrocities… The well kempt (and well fed) ones can be quite handsome… outside of their disturbingly deep set eyes, hollow cheeks and abnormally tall stature they almost pass as humans. There are female spriggans as well, but little is known about them. They live in sororities in the deep woods and dont interact with people; humans do not become wendigos through acts of cannibalism. They are their separate thing.

It is common for spriggans, vampires and other ‘civilized’ demons to be employed in the martial department. They are naturally, far stronger than humans, and are much faster in their movements. However they are usually only dispatched in the most dire expeditions. I recall feeling confused why they set a spriggan on a mere ‘Category Four, Physical’….

I would soon find out.

Stepping out of our helicopter and onto the site we were greeted by a macabre scene that almost made me give up my breakfast. We were at the lip of a clearing, there was torn burlap fabric and garbage bags strewn around, and bloodied human appendages lay limp on the gnarled weeds that banacled the ground. There was a ribcage with stringy morsels of flesh dangling from its bleached frame and remnants of a papery white dress which belonged to its owner, was still wrapped partially around it. Some distance away from us, partially concealed in the tree line was a makeshift shack cobbled together with rotten boards.
