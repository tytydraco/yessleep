I swear to God if someone doesn't help me I don't know what to do. 

Like, Jesus fucking christ I don't even know how I got to this point. I know this makes me sound like a moron but I need help. 

Just imagine: not even two months ago I was doing fine. I lived in a nice house, nice neighborhood, decent car, loving girlfriend. Then overnight - Halloween of all fucking days - everything changes. 

Right now I'm fucking not even two weeks out from Christmas, motel hopping, on PTO and on the worst stretch of sleep in my life. I don't even fucking know what the hell is hunting me. I mean I know what it looks like, but I don't know what *it* is. 

Something is hunting me. I've seen the blood on the door and the scratch marks. I keep having to pay the damage fees before leaving. I stopped checking out two motels ago. Pretty sure there's an arrest warrant out there for me but I can't stop running. 

It keeps finding me. I can't stop because if I do, it's going to fucking kill me. 

Maybe I shouldn't have pissed off that one weird neighbor I have. 

You know the type: kind of weird, but kind of hot, witchy type? My girl calls it dark academia I guess. I've seen chicks like her during my frat days. Didn't think I would be living two doors down from one and that one had a fucking garden display like it's Halloween all year round. 

It's fucking annoying, you know? My HOA fined me for not cutting my grass once but they let her keep that creepy ass skeleton lizard up all year. I swear I've seen that thing move but people seem to ignore it like it's just the wind. 

But I know it's alive because that's the thing that's hunting me down right now. Like it's a fucking SKELETON HOW IS IT MOVING. 

Sure, I shouldn't have thrown a rock at it when I was coming home from that party. I was drunk and I was fucking mad. 

Then shit started happening. Slowly. Weird shit. 

I didn't even realize it was that thing at first. What kind of skeleton smashes a car window? 

But then my door started getting gouges and branches around my house started getting broken. I saw something move on the ring camera once but the footage went missing. 

Then I fucking saw her smiling at me with that creepy ass smile when I was repainting my door for the third time. 

"Run," she said. Or at least I think that's what she said. She was too far away but I saw her lips move. 

That was the night that it broke into my house and cut my chest up good enough that I had to go to the hospital. 

No one believed me though. Not even the cops or my girlfriend. 

I ran. It still followed me. 

I'm so tired of running. My cash is running low. I'm nowhere near a bank. I'm running out of excuses to give my boss and I think they'll fire me as soon as I step foot back at work. My gf is about to breakup with me too. 

I'm sorry but I don't know what to do. You guys seem to know. Help me? 

Please? 

Before it kills me. It always seems to know where I am and I don't think I can get away quickly enough. Someone please give me some advice.
