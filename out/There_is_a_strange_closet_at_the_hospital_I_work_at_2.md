I had another encounter with this peculiar closet. The grossest and most terrifying experience of my life came from that closet. 


This particular day, I picked up a graveyard shift. Similar routine to evening shift, recycling and garbage to be dumped, closet to be walked past. I was on edge the whole walk down that hall. Waiting for the rattling of stretcher wheels, but they never came. I turned the corner and saw the door at the end of the hall. Room 1555. Nothing was out of the ordinary with it until I walked closer. The door started to stretch and warp. Protruding out of the doorframe like an enlarged stomach breathing. 
"Not right now." I said and dropped the bins off at the exit, flipped the door the bird, and headed back upstairs.


I gave it a few hours before I went back to finish the garbage, figured I'd let the door calm down a bit. There were no sounds of stretchers, and the door was behaving itself. I exited the basement door, finished up with the garbage, and turned around to head back inside. 


Through the little basement window slits I could see the closet. I could see that it was wide open. I gulped, flung open the basement doors, and braced against the wall. No stretchers came flying at me. Maybe tonight the door was going to behave. I approached with caution, grabbed the handle, and pushed it shut. 


The door latched softly, and my nose started to pour. Bright red blood ran down my face and onto the floor. I've had nose bleeds (I've picked my nose my whole life), but this was unlike anything. It was like a waterfall, I felt the blood pool up and eject out of my nose like a dam ejecting water. I looked down at my hand. The blood on my fingers was being pulled towards the handle. I immediately let go of it, causing my nose to completely dry up. I looked down at my scrubs, completely ruined. I've cleaned surgical scrubs and operating rooms, and this was the most blood I have ever seen. Well, that was until I did garbage again. 


I got myself changed, got the blood cleaned, and went to sleep the rest of my shift away. Something was strange when I went back to Room 1555. It looked like the door handle was already wiped. I bled all over it. I decided I wasn't dealing with more bodily fluids after I've seen that much come out of me.


A few days passed by, and I picked up another graveyard, I made sure to bring extra scrubs, and I took a roll of gauze from the Emergency Room, just in case. That time of night rolled around, meaning I had to face the closet again. I  peaked around the hall corner, and the door appeared normal. I felt my nose; dry. So far, so good. I got closer to the exit and closer to the closet. Everything was in order, no nose bleeds, quiet empty halls, and an ordinary closet door. Like the night before, I dumped the garbage and recycling, and like the night before, the closet door opened. I grabbed the gauze from my pocket and shoved it up my nose. Fully prepared this time for Room 1555. I entered the building and grabbed the handle of the closet.  I was ready for my sinuses to fill up with blood, but they didn't. I sighed a breath of relief and latched the closet shut. A warm sensation started in my pants and began flowing down my legs. My head started swimming. More blood than last time, but this time a place lot worse than my nose. 


I felt the warmth in my underwear, I could smell the iron in the air. I looked down and saw a waterfall of blood pour down my legs, and I could see the blood pooling underneath the door. I ripped my hand away from the handle, but it was stuck. It was like the handle was a magnet, and my hand was made of metaI. My head started to float as my body got weak. Finally, I the handle let up its grip, and I fainted into my puddle of blood. I awoke soon after, my scrubs again ruined with my own blood. The floor that I was sitting on was dry and clean. That couldn't be possible. My entire back and pants were saturated in my own dried blood. I got changed and went home for the rest of the night. This will be the last graveyard I pick up for awhile.


When I went to write both these encounters on our Room 1555 page and found another new date. January 21 was written previously, January 22, written after. Again, neither dates were signed.
