I’m addicted to Vinted, i’ve been using it since 2022, i buy everything but books in particular, i love that i can’t buy whatever i want for such a little price, it’s such a money saver. 

About 3 or 2 weeks ago i was scrolling through my feed and i found this post: 
“Horror book from 1967, handwritten”. 
The description was very short aswell, yet very creepy.
“Handwritten, no title. 
I need to get rid of this cursed book” 

I giggled at the description, i thought that it was a good marketing strategy, i didn’t believe in cursed stuff and shit like that so i bought it for only €7, but i wasn’t aware of what was going to happen next. 

The book arrived 4 days later in a normal box, nothing weird. I opened the package as soon as i got back home and the book looked just like the picture, i was so excited i just removed my shoes and sat on my couch reading it like my life was depending on it.

It was particular because it wasn’t about just one single story but every chapter had a different story and protagonist. 

I finished it within 3 hours, it was for sure very scary and creepy, it left me a strange feeling but i refused to believe that it was actually cursed n shit. 
I put the book in my library, ate the leftover pizza slices from lunch and then went to sleep. 

When i was in bed i couldn’t help but notice this weird face on the ceiling staring at me as i stared at it back, but when i’m sleepy i always hallucinate so i didn’t think much of it, just closed my eyes and ignored it.


After 2 or 3 days i noticed that i always felt tired, no matter how much i slept or what hour was it, i always felt exhausted, i always heard weird footsteps and almost inaudible moans, and as if that wasn’t enough that same night i dreamt about that damn book. The words were distorted and unreadable except for the words “it’s too late now”. I woke up confused, with a headache and as i looked to my nightstand to reach for my phone i saw the book there even though i hadn’t touched it since i put it in my library, but honestly i was just too tired to give a fuck, i thought that i probably just put it there without noticing and went back to sleep. 

But it wasn’t over. 

The following nights i started dreaming about the stories that were written on the book, in each one of them i was the protagonist, and every single time i woke up there was the book. On my nightstand, even though i remember putting it back in place every single morning.

One day i couldn’t take it anymore, i thought i was going crazy, i took the book from my nightstand and locked it in my garage, but later that night there it was again. On my nightstand, this time it was open, i didn’t even bother looking at what was written on it, i just took it to the outside and decided to burn it. 

I grabbed a lighter along with the book, i took it outside and burned it. I watched it burn for about 10 seconds, only for the fire to go out on it’s own. I was terrified. 

I opened it to burn the pages directly but as i opened it i saw that the words were distorted and unreadable, just like the first dream i had. The only thing that was clear were the words “it’s” “too late” “now”, all in different parts of the page. 

I left the book there and went inside to text the vendor, but the post i saw when i bought it was vanished. There was no way of contacting the vendor, but i had to get rid of that thing as soon as i could. 

That night i didn’t sleep, i was too scared to even close my eyes, so i just sat on my sofa and binged on family guy episodes, and the next morning when i left the house to go to work the book vanished. That same day i got an email with just a picture attached. 

A photo of my library with the book in it. 

I had to leave work early and forced myself to throw up so they wouldn’t make a big deal out of it. 

I went to in my library room but the book wasn’t there, or anywhere in my house. 

It’s been 5 days since i burned the book,i had to force my sister to come and live with me for a while. I’m scared that something might happen soon. 
I don’t know what to do
