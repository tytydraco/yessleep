I'll start by giving some context on who I am - male and approaching my thirties at the time the story took place.

My partner and I had just moved to a new city, having previously lived in another for just over 5 years.

I worked a remote job which paid the bills (barely) and my partner had just picked up a new job, which had prompted our move in the first place.

We had only been there for a few months, but my mind was already made up.

I hated it there.

The city was a downgrade to the previous area in more ways than one. The main reason however was that I just missed what I had called my home.

I was happy for her. Of course I was. But I was homesick.

More than anything though, I was depressed.

I had been depressed for a while - even before the move.

When I use the term depressed, I don't mean that I was feeling down or blue. I was in a constant state of feeling almost...nothing. I was numb to almost all feelings and emotions other than variants of guilt or shame.

Working from home had its perks, but the cons had started to outweigh the pros after a few years.

I had a routine. I would wake up, eat, shower, work, then if I had free time I would watch videos on YouTube or a film.

Eventually, I became so efficient at my job that I would accumulate several days of free time which left me with absolutely nothing to do in the meantime.

In our old city, I would go and see friends if I could. But even towards the end of the 5 years, I had started to slowly drift away from them and any social interaction bar talking to my partner.

Now that we lived in a new city, I knew no one. And I did practically nothing on my free days.

I watched videos, sure. But I wasn't really paying attention. I was monotonously staring at the screen, hoping that something would change in my life to make it more interesting.

When a day came to an end, I would lie in bed thinking desperately about how I needed a change. I would often fall asleep past 3am and wake up feeling groggy the next morning.

My life was...well, depressing.

I know what you might be thinking: Get a part time job and meet people. Join a club and meet people. Join a chatroom and meet people.

Yeah, I knew these options existed. But when you're depressed, often you'll find yourself exhibiting other symptoms that you didn't even know you had.

Mine was anxiety. Severe social anxiety at times.

I was okay if I was just walking to a local store for some milk, but throw me into a busy shopping mall and it was hell for me. I would sweat and start to hyperventilate.

This wasn't who I was just a few years ago. But working from home and not being social for several years had really affected my psyche. I could no longer do normal things, it seemed.

It was - ironically - being in a busy mall that set off the chain of events that I'm about to tell you.

My partner (who is a girl) loves to go clothes shopping. Since I had started developing these anxiety symptoms, I had dreaded the days when we would go.

It was a weekend - a busy one - and it all became too much for me. I snapped and told my girlfriend I wasn't feeling well and needed some air.

Instead of following me, she continued shopping. I was a bit hurt by this but was even more surprised by her reaction when she left to come and find me.

She was slightly irritated at me but also a little bit concerned. Turns out, she had noticed the way I had been acting in these social situations. I hadn't been the master of disguise I thought I was.

Granted, it wasn't the first time I had ventured out of a store for air but I assumed she had put it down to the "boyfriend hates clothing store" mentality that so many of us have.

She was irritated because she thought I would have tried to get help - or at least try and change some things in my life - to try and manage the symptoms by now.

She told me that she loved me, but she couldn't keep doing this. She reminded me that I had cancelled several plans to meet her new work friends and she couldn't keep making excuses for me.

She really laid into me.

Now, before you leave a comment stating how nasty her reaction was...don't. It was the best thing that could ever happen to me.

In fact, it motivated me to do what I should have done a long time ago.

Kick depression's ass.

When we got home later that day, I made a decision. I would go on a solo trip to a random location and stay there for at least a few days.

My partner was adamant that this wasn't what I should be doing. She suggested therapy and a little bit of social interaction here and there. If it got too much at any point, she promised she would go home with me.

But I didn't want to do that. I've always been a "rip the band aid off" kind of person and I felt that the only way I could truly get over this anxiety - and maybe part of my depression in the process - would be to go into the deep end.

So, the next week I was packed and on my way to a small town in the East, around four hours away by car. I don't live in the US but I do live in an English speaking country, just for context.

I was on edge for the first two hours of the coach journey. My heart would not stop racing and the breathing exercises I had taught myself weren't doing much to calm me.

But somewhere after that two hour mark, my fear began to subside.

It was as if my body had strained and stressed itself out of anxiety to the point where now it was almost...cleansed.

I don't know how to describe it other than I felt as though I had crossed a threshold. I had passed over the wall.

I eased up in my seat and breathed a deep breath of relief. I felt...great. I look back on this moment and realise that the adrenaline helped, but I really felt a sense of beautiful zen there and then.

The rest of the journey was smooth and as we reached the town, I stepped out of the coach and grabbed my luggage. I was staying in a cosy hotel for three days which wasn't far from where the coach had stopped.

I had planned out my several days of sightseeing. First, I would venture around the idyllic town, making a point to engage with at least five people that day. I would grab a drink at the two pubs and make conversation if I could. Alcohol would help, but I didn't want to rely on it. That defeated the purpose of this challenge for myself.

So I did exactly that the first day and it went okay. I had some nice chats with locals and although I didn't reveal my actual reason for being there (I just told them I was travelling), they seemed to be interested in seeing a new face.

This town was more of a changeover point for travellers than one in which you would actually stop and stay in. So they found it nice that somebody actually stopped to appreciate the area.

The second day I had ventured out into the surrounding forest area to visit several locations I had plotted on Google Maps. I had found what looked to be a water fountain, a small gazebo and what looked like an abandoned house of sorts, nestled in the middle of the woods.

I explored the first two which were...uneventful to say the least. They both looked old and well designed but I lost interest fairly quickly.

When I found the house, everything changed.

The place wasn't huge - only two floors - but it was something straight out of a spooky novel. The entire structure was covered in a thick layer of moss, mold and vines. The hinges were rusted - the glass windows shattered.

It was creepy.

I loved horror, so this sparked my interest immediately. After a few seconds inside, the smell hit me. It was a meaty sort of smell. It was fruity too. It reminded me of pate.

Then as I took several steps further, the smell became unbearable. I could hear flies too, so I assumed there was a rotting fox or something sinking into the decaying floorboards somewhere.

I turned and left through the way I came in, not wanting to spend any more time inhaling that dreadful odour.

As I breathed in fresh air finally, I heard a sound. A crack from a twig.

I turned and there he was. A man, around the same age as me, slowly pacing towards me.

"Hi. Smells pretty bad in there, right?" he said, laughing softly.

The sudden introduction of the man had spooked me for a moment, but after he spoke, I felt a bit more at ease.

"Yeah, it smells like something died in there." I said, also laughing.

The man stopped a couple of feet in front of me and extended his hand.

"Robbie," he said.

I told him my name and we began to talk. First, we started on the conversation of travel - and he explained that he was from the West and was travelling too, just like me. He was here for one night and one night only before he caught the coach back.

I found this somewhat eerie but also funny as we were both living in the same part of the country and would most likely take the same coach back the next day.

I was excited now - we both shared common interests in sports and films and he seemed like someone I could genuinely be good friends with. Maybe we could hang out when we both got back? That was the main thought in my mind as the conversation grew in topics.

Now, I don't know what caused it, but eventually the conversation took a strange turn. For some reason, I felt so comfortable around Robbie that I admitted why I was there in the first place. Why I was really there, anyway.

He nodded understandingly and just listened as I told him practically everything I had told you at the beginning of this story.

After I finished speaking, I expected Robbie to say something in response but he just froze. He looked as though he might speak at one point, but suddenly decided against it. Then he looked up at me, his eyes somewhat teary now and spoke firmly.

"I was going to rob you and kill you before we started speaking, you know?"

Now it was my turn to freeze. At first I thought Robbie was just kidding. That this was some sort of sick joke that he was going to reveal with a funny punchline. But no...he just continued staring at me.

I didn't know what to do. I had gone from pure joy at finding a new friend to pure fear of being killed by a man in a forest.

I felt like the world was spinning and my anxiety ramped up to the maximum that it had ever been. Then...he spoke again.

"But everything you told me about how you feel...it's exactly how I've been feeling. I just haven't been able to put it into words."

I was struggling for a response. But I knew that I needed to de-escalate the situation as fast as I could. At that moment, I thought about what I would want somebody to say to me if I had spoken that exact sentence.

I thought about what answer would actually make me feel better as opposed to something safe that somebody might say. I thought about what the man needed to hear.

And I spoke.

"Things might not get better. Not straight away. But trust me...if you can take the first step to get help...you'll be okay. But if you can't do it...it will just eat away at you forever and only get worse. Trust me...I know."

There were large pauses in between my two sentences and my voice was shaking...I felt like I was trying to disarm a bomb verbally. But once my words came out, I was weirdly satisfied with them. I had told Robbie - and myself in the process - that it can get better.

Robbie placed a firm hand on my shoulder and as I tensed up, ready to defend myself if needed...he just said two words.

"Thank you."

He nodded, spun on his heels and quickly walked into the house. I wasn't sure if he was expecting me to follow him, but I wasn't going to.

I didn't waste a moment turning on my own heels and making my way back to the hotel.

I didn't get much sleep that night. I had locked my doors and lay facing the ceiling on the cramped single bed.

I didn't call the police either. I told myself that I was going to wait until I returned to the comfort of my own home. If Robbie caught wind that I had called the police, he may come back to do what he almost had.

One thing had been playing on my mind all night: Robbie was supposed to catch the same coach as me. Or at least he had told me that. When the coach left without him on board the next morning, I breathed in a sigh of relief. He would not be travelling back with me.

The entire journey, I just contemplated the situation over and over again in my mind. When I got back home, I called the police first, then spoke to my confused girlfriend once I'd hung up. I broke down as I told her everything.

She held me in her arms and told me that she felt like this was all her fault. She had been the reason why I had travelled there alone. She should have never shouted at me like that. She should have been gentler with me etc etc.

I told her that she was right to have done what she did. I wasn't crying because I was upset. I was crying because knowing that I was just one wrong conversation away from having my life snatched away from me...really put things into perspective.

I told my partner that the journey had forever changed who I was as a person, and I felt like a set of chains had almost been lifted. I didn't regret a single minute of that trip.

I felt strangely...freeing.

Pieces started to form around what had actually happened as I received a visit from the police a few days later.

The two officers who visited me had been contacted by the branch near the town I was staying in. They had been relayed the information and evidence and now it was their job to come and relay it to me, whilst asking several questions of their own.

The police had found not one - not two - and not three dead bodies in the house. They had found a staggering thirteen dead human bodies, each one piled on top of each other like a corrupted stack of cards.

The bodies were not locals either. Each one had gone missing after leaving a coach in that town. Each one was a traveller on their own journey. Somebody like me.

The police very firmly told me that I was extremely lucky to have had contact with the man and still live to tell the tale. When I told them the full story of what we spoke about, one of the police officers let out a sigh

"That makes a lot of sense now," she said to the other officer.

"What does?" I asked.

"We found one man, matching your description of Robbie, found dead in a river just North of the town. He had bled out from both wrists. We think it was suicide."

I was shocked. Not only about the pile of bodies I narrowly missed, but also that the man I spoke to the other day...the killer...was now dead himself. From suicide no less.

I asked the officer why it suddenly made sense and she simply stated "You told this man that it can get better if he gets the help he needs. You told him that it will only get worse if he can't."

"Yeah?" I was still confused by this point.

"Well, let's just say he couldn't get the help he needed...and he didn't want it to eat at him forever. I think we know why we took his own life now."

I was gobsmacked when the officer said this aloud and so was my partner. She spoke first, stating how dare the officer accuse me of being the reason for this psychopath's death. The officer, to her credit, immediately threw her hands up to apologise, and told me and my partner that she wasn't accusing anyone of being the reason for that man dying.

She merely stated that the man now had a motive to kill himself. That my words must have resonated so deeply with him. He clearly wanted to get help. He wanted to stop killing. But he couldn't. My words had only convinced him that his bloodlust would increase until there was nothing human left in him at all.

I felt a strange sense of guilt at that...but also relief. This man was a burden to society. I don't wish death upon anyone, but one thing is for sure: With him gone, a lot more lives have been saved.

To end this story, I'm going to share just one final thought.

I look back at that conversation with Robbie (which I soon learned from the officer was in fact a fake name) and I wonder if that was the first real conversation he had with another person for a long time.

In a strange way - murdering aside - me and him shared something that day. We were both isolated individuals, who had come out of our comfort zone to share a moment together. We had connected on a topic so dark and thought provoking that it had caused him to do something unspeakable to himself.

Both of us left the town that day...both changed individuals...but only one of us lived to tell the tale.

I thank depression everyday...for saving my life.
