As me and my husband slid into bed to hopefully sleep through the raging storm outside, we heard a noise that caught our attention. It was the noise of somebody knocking on the back door. Except this knocking was intense, like something that was desperate or angry. I sat up, but my husband put his hand on my shoulder.

“Stay here, Shannon.”

I sat as he climbed out of bed and pulled on a jacket. He opened the closet to remove a small handgun. He wasn't a hunter, despite the fact that all his buddies were. Rob worked on a farm owned by his friend's parents. His large hands were rough from years of work, his eyes sunken with dark bags beneath them, his shoulders broad and scarred. He was twenty two. 

We met in senior year of high school. I was working at the movie theater when my manager sent me to kick a group of kids out of one of the theaters. They were yelling about something stupid, so I told them to leave. They did, but their friend apologized on his way out the door. This was Rob. He was kind and his smile was sweet. I gave him my number and we started dating soon after. I went to college, and he stayed behind to start working. He showed up every once in a while for the parties, but was waiting for me at home when I graduated. We bought the house earlier this year and I was eagerly awaiting a proposal. 

He looked back to me from the doorway, “It's probably just a branch or something.” 

He was gone, swallowed by the shadows of the powerless home. I waited for a moment, only hearing the sound of his footsteps. They stopped and the door opened. I heard talking, but not much. I had enough of waiting, and slid into my slippers. 

I walked up behind Rob and saw a teenage boy, no older than seventeen, sitting on our back patio. The heavy rain splattered across his face. He was barely looking at us as he spoke, “Please. Somebody broke in… It's so cold…”

“What do we do, Rob?” I asked.

“Call the cops.”

“Have you seen that storm, they are definitely preoccupied.”

He stopped to think for a moment. I looked back to the boy, to see him lying face down. Rob and I rushed out the door and grabbed his arms. We flipped him over. 

Rob put his hands up to the boy's face, “Hey, are you okay? Kid, are you okay?”

The boy opened his mouth, and a little bit of mud came out as he breathed. 

“Crap,” I said as Rob and I pulled the boy through the door. 

Rob pointed down the hall, “Go get a towel or something.”

I went to a closet in the bathroom and stumbled around in the dark. I managed to find a beach towel and rushed out to the hall. I stepped on a corner of the towel and fell face first into the floor. Pain shot through my face as I pulled myself to my feet. I brought the towel to Rob, who laid it down on the couch before putting the boy on top of it. I grabbed a tissue and shoved it into my nostrils to stop the blood that had begun to drip. 

Rob looked at me and we locked eyes. I knew the look on his face very well by now. He was scared. “We have to try 911.”

I pulled my phone out and called, despite the knowledge that they were definitely busy. “No answer.”

“What? That can't be right, call again.”

“Rob, there is no answer.”

“It's 911, they can't just not answer.”

I threw my hands up to indicate that I was clueless. He sighed and looked back down at the unconscious teenager on our couch. I went to the back door and opened it. Gazing into the storm, I tried to see which house he could have come from. The only thing I could see across the small field was something large swinging back and forth from a tree branch. I closed the door and placed my hands on my head. 

I had no clue what to do. I glanced at the coffee table and saw the gun sitting casually. Rob spoke up, “He's got a nasty bruise on his head.”

I looked and he was right. It was fresh, and deepening in color as we watched. “He must've gotten-” I was interrupted by the sound of the bedroom window shattering. I ran down the hall and into the room to see the rain flying inside through the rectangular hole that was the window. A branch was lying in the frame, but it was at a strange angle. As if somebody had placed-

“Holy shit!” Rob slid into the room, throwing a tarp over the broken window. He locked it in place as best he could. We retreated into the kitchen, where a ding from the coffee machine signaled that the drink was prepared. Rob grabbed the pot and poured a cup. He swung open a cabinet and removed a can of beer, which he proceeded to dump into the mug. 

He emptied the contents into his mouth and slammed it onto the counter. He rubbed his hands through his short hair. He was famously calm under pressure. When a coyote had killed all the farm's chickens, he was called in to clean it up. When the drunken next door neighbor started to shoot at rabbits in the backyard, he went out to calm him down. But right now, he was sleep deprived and upset. 

A roaring screech hit our ears, causing us to jerk our heads to the source. It came from the front yard and was the pitch of a woman. My heart began to race as I realized its proximity to the house. It was at the front door. We opened the door only to find nothing in the dark abyss save for the rain and wind. 

“Shut the door!” The boy leapt from the couch and started across the room. Rob raised the gun at the boys, who froze in place. He put his hands up and repeated himself, “Please shut the door.” 

His voice cracked as he spoke and his breath was heavy. I pushed the door closed. He sighed with relief and Rob lowered the gun slowly. I met the boy's eyes and saw the intense fear within. 

“Why were you out in the storm?” Rob questioned. 

“I-I-My family. We… We were attacked.”

“Somebody attacked you?” I asked. 

A sharp sound erupted into the room and cold shards rained onto the back of my neck. Pain shot through the back of my head as something hard and heavy struck me. I fell into Rob's arms and heard the thud of stone hitting the floor. 

Rob carried me over to the couch and set me down carefully. I rubbed the back of my head. My vision was blurred and my ears were ringing. Rob held up his phone flashlight in front of my face. He turned it on and off. 

“Shit, she's got a concussion.” He pointed to the end of the couch, “Grab that pillow.”

The boy did as he was instructed and Rob placed it behind my head. 

“What the hell was that?” I asked as Rob shoved pain meds into my hand. I swallowed them and pointed to the rock lying on the wood floor. The boy was bent over to pick it up. He removed a rubber band from around it and unfolded a wet piece of lined paper. Rob saw this and ripped the paper from the boy's hand. 

“What does this mean?” He said, dropping the paper onto the coffee table. He turned to the boy, “Do you know what that shit means?”

The boy nodded. Rob began walking to the door and peered through the now broken glass. I looked at the paper on the coffee travel and read the words aloud, “Let me in.”

Rob grabbed the boy by his collar and slammed him against the wall, “What does it mean?”

“She wants in. Don't let her in.”

“Who? Who wants in?”

“I don't know,” He wheezed, trying to catch his breath. “I don't know what she is. She killed my parents. That's all I know. Please don't let her in.” He began to sob.

I stood up and immediately fell onto the coffee table, smacking my knee against the corner. The pain of standing was intense, but I pushed through. “Rob! Let go of him,” I shouted. 

He released the boy and backed away. There was a knock on the door. It was soft, barely loud enough to be heard over the raging winds. We all turned our heads to the door. 

“Don't do it.” The boy begged as Rob readied his gun and approached the door. We could see the outline of a figure through the stained glass that remained. The figure was petite with long flowing hair. Rob shined his phone light through the hole in the glass. A soft, pretty face was illuminated by the light. 

She smiled, “I'm so sorry to bother you, but is there any way I could come in for a second. My car broke down outside and I seem to have lost my brother.”

“Your brother?” Rob asked. 

“Yes, he's skinny with dark hair, 16 years old.” She paused and gasped, “Wait. There he is! Come on, get out here. What are you doing there?”

Rob turned back to look at the boy, who was shaking his head.

“It's cold out here. Come on, let me in,” Her eyes found mine from across the room. “Just for a sec.”

Rob looked to me for guidance. “No.” I said. “We can't let you in right now.”

“Oh come on,” She laughed with the voice of an LA teen. “I would have thought that rock would have knocked some sense into that stupid bitch.”

“Go. We aren't taking visitors.” Rob demanded. 

“Just give my brother, please.” She made a dramatic frown and blinked her eyes. Rob was staring at her in silence for a moment before turning to me. “We have to give him to her.”

“What?” The boy shouted. 

I tried to reason with him, “Rob, what are you talking about?”

“She gave you a concussion, who knows what else she's gonna do to us if we don't give her the kid.”

The boy stepped forward, “I'm not going out there.”

I placed my hand on Rob's chest, “Honey, we can't do that. She's dangerous, we don't know what she'll do to him.”

“I'm not worried about him, I'm worried about us.”

“He's just a kid.”

“And you're my wife.” He turned around and grabbed the boy by the arm. 

“Stop it!” I screamed, but Rob continued towards the front door. 

The boy grabbed at the wall and attempted to pull away but it was no use. Rob was too strong. 

The girl on the porch smiled, “I knew the big guy would understand.”

Rob grabbed the door handle, but I stepped in front of him. “Rob, stop it!”

“Shannon, you know that this thing isn't human. She's asking to let in. She is a goddamn vampire, sweetie.  We have to give her what she wants so that she won't hurt us. We need to think about our future.”

He pushed me out of the way with his elbow and opened the door. I looked around the room. I dug my hand into his pocket and pulled out his gun. He shoved the boy out onto the porch and the girl in the raincoat grabbed him with glee. 

It fired the gun into her eye, sending her stumbling off the porch and into the flower bed. Rob grabbed my arm and I swung the gun around to smack him in the nose. I heard a loud crack and he grasped his face. The boy jumped across the threshold back into the house. 

Rob screamed out, “Just come in here and get him!”

The girl jolted upright, her eyes fixed on the boy. I dragged him behind me as I ran through the house. I looked back for a second to see the yellow raincoat sliding across the ceiling. I reached the garage door and we ran in, slamming the door closed behind us. 

I could hear Rob shouting from the other side as I started the car. The boy pulled himself into the passenger seat after grabbing an axe from the corner.  Rob hollering turned into terrible screams as I hit the button and the garage screeched open. The door was agonizingly slow and I knew that the vampire wouldn't be distracted for long. As soon as there was enough room, I slammed on the gas and sped down the driveway. 

“I'm sorry,” The boy whispered.
