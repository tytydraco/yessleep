I adopted my dog, Bruno, 3 weeks ago from an animal shelter. I was feeling homesick after moving abroad to study university, so my parents encouraged me to adopt my dream pet; a cute, one year old golden retriever. 

However, the moment I brought it to my home, my life has been nothing but a spiraling mess, and now I can confidently say that my life is over. The police will break in any minute now, and my whole family will soon cut contact with me.

Let me explain.

The first incident came a week after bringing Bruno to my home. It was 8pm and I was coming back from the library after a 12-hour-long study session (midterm season’s been rough). I open the door and Bruno jumps onto me, licking my face. I have quickly learned since I’ve adopted him that it’s a signal that he needs to pee.

“Alright alright buddy, give me a minute.” I laugh while putting on his leash.

Opening the door, I walk out to a breeze of fresh air.

“Phew.” I sigh. “Finally!”

As I walk down the street, Bruno stops to smell something. But this time, he was smelling it a lot more intently than usual. I don’t know how to describe it exactly, but he looked a little obsessive, as if the smell started taking control of his actions. 

Before I could gently tug at him to keep walking, he bolts to the left. Shocked, I leap forward and accidentally let go of the leash, leaving Bruno to lunge towards the darkness.

“Shit…” I muttered under my breath. “Bruno, come back!”

I rush after him, roughly a foot behind. After a few blocks, he takes a sharp left turn into a small alleyway. As he ran straight ahead, he quickly paused, almost as if he turned into a statue.

 I don’t think I’ve seen an alleyway that smelt like such shit before. It smelled both dry and moist. Burnt but frozen. It was a weird combination of fire, metal, chicken, and…blood?

My heart skipped a beat as I formed that thought. Why does it smell like blood? Where the hell did Bruno take me to, and how could he smell it from 5 blocks away? It didn’t make any sense to me. I take a deep breath and place my palm on my chest. 

“Bruno…” I say, my voice shaky, my legs starting to feel like jelly.

Bruno blinked and tilted his head to the right, his puppy eyes looking slightly darker than usual. Unnatural, even.

“Bruno…” I say, chills running down my spine. “Come on buddy, it’s time to eat.”

Bruno doesn’t move. Instead, he signals to whatever was in front of him. My eyes widen, but I sigh. Gasping for air (while trying not to make too much noise), I walk towards Bruno slowly. 

Each step felt longer than the last. Even my breath echoed under the silence. Pausing, I turn my head, and my body stiffens.

A man’s silhouette was standing a few feet away from me, looking down at me from the other side of the alleyway. He looked tall, tall enough for me to have to look all the way up to see his head. He had a massive build, a build large enough to take up at least half of the alleyway behind him. 

Looking down, I see a box in front of me, close enough for me to be able to reach out and touch it. It looked to be what the man was looking at (at least from what I could decipher at that moment).

However, the box wasn’t empty. Rather, it had a small drawing. A drawing with a crayon that seemed to be made of something that usually isn’t used to make crayons. It could be blood, maybe that’s where the smell of blood was coming from, I thought.

It was a drawing of a dog; a golden retriever, to be exact. Next to it was a stick figure pulling what looked to be an unusually high leash. High enough for it to seem impossible for the dog to be standing on its feet without choking.

“What the fuck?” I muttered under my breath. 

Looking at Bruno, he was staring right at me, still as brick. This was the most still I had ever seen him up to that point.  

But how was he able to smell such a specific scent from so many blocks away? Why was he so still? Why are his eyes so abnormally dark? Who was that man, and what was that drawing all about?

With my legs shaking and my breath shallow, I quickly grabbed Bruno and bolted out of that alleyway as fast as I physically could, praying that the man wouldn’t be following me. 

Thankfully, I had made it home.

The next incident came 3 days after when I had woken up in the middle of the night. 

Looking around my room, I could see Bruno standing next to the window on top of the kitchen counter (my house isn’t very big so it’s all in the same room). 

His eyes were unusually widened, his body completely still. All except for his paw, which was gently scratching the table with incredible strength. Each screech pierced my ear drum, the moon’s light making his face shine bright in comparison to the rest of the room. However, he wasn’t doing anything else. He was just staring at me, scratching the table’s surface.

However, his face looked…off. I don’t know how to describe it, but it didn’t look like a normal dog. If anything, it looked threatening. Distorted. I don’t even wanna think about it.

Days after, more incidents came with Bruno. He kept barking at walls, pulling me with his leash to random areas at night that I wish not to mention, and even came back home after disappearing for days with dead animals like rats and pigeons.

However, I wish that that would’ve been the day I had brought Bruno back to the animal shelter. If only this would’ve been the end of it, but unfortunately not. If anything, this is where things take a turn for the worse.

A few weeks afterwards and many sleepless nights, my best friend, Luke, invited me over to his house for his 19th birthday party. I was feeling exhausted from all the studying, combined with my own dog making my life harder and more disturbing than it needed to be. 

But I, of course, didn’t want to miss my best friend’s birthday, so I wrapped his gift; a collection of a bunch of new releases from his favourite comic book collection, as well as a birthday card, and made my way to his apartment complex.

Walking in, I noticed there to be dozens of people already, even though I had arrived an hour early. I see Luke and dap him up. Suddenly, my exhaustion wears off and a genuine smile forms over my face.

“Damn you got some insane eye bags haha.” He said, hugging me. “Maybe procrastination and laziness was the best way to live after all.” He grinned, pointing at himself. He then pats me in the back. “Oh, by the way bro, the cake’s over there. Get ready, I got insane plans for today.”

I walk over to the birthday cake and place my present next to all the other gifts surrounding it. However, my brain suddenly flashes to the drawing I had seen a few nights before: the drawing of a dog; a golden retriever, next to a stick figure pulling a leash unusually high. I slap myself and shake my head. No, I think to myself. Today is Luke’s birthday. Think positively, you’re just tired.

Soon enough, all of Luke’s friends arrive and we make a circle around all the gifts and cake. After singing happy birthday and all that stuff, Luke gets ready to open all the gifts. But for some reason, I start to feel nauseous again.

My ears start ringing. My heart starts beating faster. The taste of metal in my mouth comes back, as does a faint but obvious scent of blood. However, I seemed to be the only one thinking that. Maybe I’m just imagining things.

You’re just tired, I tell myself. Just relax, it’ll be fun…

Luke begins opening all the gifts, one by one. As each gift keeps going, one after the other, I start feeling progressively more exhausted and lightheaded. As if my brain was pulling itself away from reality.

My brain flashes back to that drawing I saw in that alleyway. Then Bruno staring at me from the table, scratching the surface. And the fact that Bruno kept bringing me dead animals like rats or pigeons on his mouth constantly.

I try to snap out of it, but eventually Luke gets to my gift.

“My guy’s been overhyping this gift for months,” Luke laughs. “I got high hopes for this one,” he sounded sarcastic, as usual, but something felt off.

I laugh back and force a grin. “I’m telling you, you’re gonna love it!” 

I already know what gift I put. So why did I feel so nervous and nauseous? 

Luke slowly unwraps the gift and opens it. Then before he could even say anything, his mouth gapes wide open, and his hands start shaking.

“W…what?” He mutters.

I force a laugh and make a face. “What is it, Luke?”

Everyone goes silent as he drops the gift onto the floor. Soon enough, everyone also gasps.

It wasn’t the gift I had prepared for him beforehand. Not even close.

“You think this is a sick joke?” Says Luke, still looking at the gift.

It wasn’t a collection of his favourite comic book collection, nor was it a birthday card.

It was my dog, Bruno.

Inside the wrapped gift was his body. His face was bruised and beat up. His body was filled with pools of blood, his body still and cold. He wasn’t breathing. 

He was dead.

And on top of him was the same drawing I had seen that night in the alleyway. The drawing of a dog; a golden retriever, next to a stick figure pulling a leash unusually high; high enough that it is impossible for the dog to be able to stand up without choking.

My body freezes, and my mind goes blank. Before I knew it, everyone is screaming at me, and others are calling the police on me for gifting a dead animal to a friend.

Without having the time to even process the situation, I rush into the bathroom and lock the door.

I can already hear banging outside, police sirens surrounding me, and people yelling in shock. Concurrently, I hear a barrage of notifications on my phone.

They’re from Luke.

From my mom.

My dad.

A bunch of my friends.

Basically everyone I had ever known.

And right outside, I hear more screams

“This is the police!” I hear.

Once again, I start hearing scratching. The smell of blood and the taste of metal comes back. My body starts shivering.

Why was my dog Bruno dead in the gift box? 

Who has done this? 

Is the man I saw that night in the alleyway involved?

Damn it, why is the scratching sound getting louder?

Somebody, make it stop!

Please, I need help, desperately. I don’t know what to do! Why is this happening to me?!
