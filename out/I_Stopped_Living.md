Something happened that stopped my heart, and it never got started again. Still, I didn't die, but *I stopped living*.

No heartbeat. No breath. No appetite, no bodily functions. I've been living with this for a few days, and it's really starting to wear on me. I mean, I'm thirty-two, and I'm dead, or something like it. My senses work, but they don't mean anything. When I pass the bakery down the street and smell the bread coming out of the oven, nothing happens. I don't get hungry, I don't salivate. Nothing. When I see an attractive member of the opposite sex, nothing happens. No physical signs of a libido. Yesterday I bought a sandwich. Just a shitty double cheeseburger from McFucksticks. I jammed the thing in my mouth, tried to swallow, and started to gag.  Even as my mind recoils from the infinite terror of the situation, it *tries* to evoke a response. I still receive and classify the incoming stimuli, but my senses and perceptions no longer have anything to do with my body. And even if I knuckle down and try to make myself feel something, I just get pissed off.

Am I still human? How the fuck am I still upright, walking around, thinking clearly, if my body is dead? It doesn't make any sense, and I gotta wonder if I'm about to start rotting and falling apart. It's scary, and that's an understatement.

I looked around online - that glowing bastion of unbiased information - and found some doctor's notes and research papers that had been typed or handwritten and *scanned* in. Being that the internet seems to encourage most of the population to construct their own version of facts these days, I was trying to read only from sources I could vet. From what I pieced together, mostly from old medical journals, the human body's progression after death appears to go like this:

\- Digestion stops - I guess? I haven't been able to eat or drink anything, so this is a safe bet.

\- Rigor Mortis - Nope. Joints and muscles feel fine. I might be a little extra stiff here and there, but it's mainly in the morning. Which brings me to a point - I'm still sleeping. Shit, I sleep better now than I have in years. And the dreams! Brother, I'll come back to this. First, let's finish the checklist.

\- Liver Mortis? Or wait, that's Livor Mortis. First time I ever heard the term, but it's essentially where blood begins to pool because without a heartbeat, gravity takes effect. This hasn't happened, *as far as I know*. I cut the tip of my right index finger open with a box cutter last night - no pain, a little blood, but it's thick, so it just kind of wells up to the lip of the wound. No dripping. You can wipe it away, no problem, but the wound hasn't scabbed over. Or at least it hasn't yet. So it's just, like, an open wound. 

\- Bloating next? Not really. I also see that foam would normally be leaking from my orifices, happy to report that's a negative as well. Are my internal organs decomposing? Well, it's only been a couple of days, and everything I've read suggests this begins within the first two days, so I guess I'll find out. I took a moment before writing this where I tried to sit and listen, to *feel* my body and see if anything felt different. Nothing really did. 

\- Skin "slippage?" Am I the only one who finds that descriptor seriously disgusting? This begins within the first week, and I've not seen any signs of this. If anything, my skin feels tighter in a way. Not so that it's overtly noticeable; more like if I stop and pinch at the skin on my elbows, feet, whatever. I'm six-two, and despite a penchant for dark beer and bread, I've hung around the 180 mark on the scale for most of the last two decades. Bit of a paunch, and even that feels normal.

Finally, the internet says I can look forward to my nails and teeth falling out in a few weeks and liquefaction setting in shortly thereafter. Seriously hoping my current ability to check "No" on most everything else on this list will translate to not going through that. Liquefaction? Fuck, that's nasty. I'm thinking of Street Trash and betting the ooze from a melting human body won't occur in fifty shades of day-glow hilarity. 

Back to my paunch, or more specifically, the reason for it; I've never admitted to having an issue with alcohol, but I've drunk three or more beers every day for the last twenty-odd years, so, you know, there must be some level of dependency. I mean, I can totally not drink if need be - two years ago, I was in the hospital for a week after I fell out of a tree (long story), and I didn't go into the DTs or anything. Cracking open a beer at the end of the day has always been a bit like crossing a personal finish line. A little reward for making it through. That might be self-indulgent, but fuck it. We all create game plans for how we're going to navigate this clusterfuck reality and the process of aging, and beer was mine. Since all this happened, though, habit tells me I want a beer, but some mental barrier prevents me from actually drinking one. I guess I feel like I don't need it anymore. It's weird, and I have to wonder if this lack of follow-through is because I've already crossed the finish line. If so, WHY AM I STILL HERE?



\*\*



Day Five.

Still pretty much exactly the same as the last time I put pen to paper. I don't know what I hope to accomplish writing all this down, but I can't *not* write this down. I mean, has what's happening to me ever happened to anyone else? Like, in the entire history of the world? I'm thinking it must have, but I'll be damned if I can find any record of it anywhere outside of fiction. I spent the first two days scouring the internet and found nothing. Oh yeah, and that's another thing - I don't sleep anymore, so my ability to keep track of time is gone. It's like the clock doesn't apply. And maybe it doesn't. I mean, if each tick of the clock is just a marker on the map to death, once you stop living, why would you need to pay attention to them anymore?  

There's a weird bookstore downtown. I headed out yesterday and spent the entire day in the stacks, cross-referencing everything from New Age Woo Woo to Crowley to Victorian medical journals. Like I said, weird little store. The girl behind the counter noticed my preoccupations and took it upon herself to strike up a conversation, probably to gauge whether or not she needed to call the cops on this weirdo that had come in when she opened and was still here ten minutes to close.

"Coping, plotting or fretting?"

"Huh?"

"Death. That's what you've been reading about all day, right?"

"A little of column A, a little of column B."

"Funny. I'd figure everyone would have a connection to column C."

"Yeah, well…"

"It's okay. Just curious. You've been here for as long as I have and haven't bought anything. Made me wonder if you were new in town. You know, didn't realize we have a library?"

"Yeah, ah, sorry 'bout that. I'll… I'll take these."

I held up a stack of books and she led me over to the checkout. This was one of those places you don't see so much anymore; it kinda reminded me of a record store more than a bookstore. Giant posters of Ginsburg and Burroughs, yes, but also Tom Waits, David Lynch and, of all people, Cyndi Lauper. Like, old school, "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" era Cyndi Lauper. The cash register sat atop a counter in the front of the store by the door, and I noticed the "Open" sign was flipped inward and the lights were dimmed. 

"Sorry, did you just close?"

"Been a little while," she said while punching in the prices marked in pencil on the inside front cover of each volume I'd selected. She paused on the second from last. "Livor Mortis and the Acceleration of Decay?" She eyed me wearily.

"Yeah, ah… I'm making a movie. A… Horror movie. Like, low budget kinda Joe Begos/Jeremy Gardner."

"Whoah. You're into them? Like Bliss and The Battery?"

Okay, fuck you very much Fate, you salty bastard. Before I stopped living, I'd been single for three years. Couldn't meet anyone to save my life. Now I'm… whatever I am, and suddenly someone pops up with such specific shared interests? This was the equivalent of receiving a billion-dollar inheritance from a long-lost Uncle. I cry bull-chit.

"Ah, yeah. How much do I owe you?"

She gave me a snotty look that, in retrospect, I one-hundred percent deserved. My life might have been over, biologically speaking, but I'd still learned nothing about women.

"Sorry. I'm just… not very good with people anymore."

"Anymore? You seem like a third-degree blackbelt in Asshole to me."

She handed my debit card back to me atop the new stack of books and I dropped my head and slunk from the store out into the rain.

\*\*

I'd taken to keeping my blinds drawn. Like I said, time no longer mattered to me, so all the sun did was remind me how fucked my situation was. I always felt more at home after dark, anyway. 

Seeing as how I just bought a big ol' stack of books, you might be wondering where a dead guy's money came from. See, I was pretty set from a seemingly frivolous investment I made a couple years ago, so as long as I stayed in my one-room apartment in the shitty part of town and used my feet as my primary mode of transportation, I stayed pretty flush. What family I did have was all back East; none of them approved of how I'd carved my niche in the world, so fuck 'em. I won't bore you with specifics; suffice it to say I'd earned my perpetual existence by sacrificing my ties and made peace with it years ago. Buying a $350 stack of books was a touch extravagant for me, but I used to freak out at tiny social interactions even when I was living, so Cashier-Girl's sudden urge to strike up a conversation sent me into a tailspin.

I spent the next day or so pouring through my new acquisitions. Inside two of the volumes I'd nabbed off the modern \*ahem\* "*Occult/New Age*" section of the store, I found a business card for some local version of the Golden Dawn. I don't know if I was more surprised to see this kind of thing still existed or the extent to which this group had gone to advertise. I guess if you're interested in more macabre areas of study and don't want it on record, your best bet is to keep it offline.

Union of Thy Gilded Age - a pretty transparently obtuse way to avoid a copyright claim, but hey, we do what we must. There was no phone or website, just a QR code. I set the card aside and continued to read for a while. When I finally knocked off, I picked up my phone and scanned the code. Nothing happened at first. Feeling cheated, I began to pace. This was the time of night I craved a beer, and my answer had become pacing, so much so that I'd started to wear ruts in the cheap linoleum tile covering my kitchen. A moment after I gave up and set my phone down, it rang.

"Hello?"

"Dost thou seek further enlightenment in the art of defying death?"

How do you answer *that*?

"I guess?"

The line went dead, and a moment later, a text came through with an address and what it took me a moment to recognize as a schedule.
