Since the death of my husbands father and other random shitty worldly things.. (Fuck brexit) we moved back to the netherlands from a village called \[retracted\] I Just tried to show you guys the back of my house... I live with my in laws. If you are interested... take a look at my (very dark footage but watch until I have gotten down the garden in the video until the end... PLEASE!!!! I AM NOT A RANDOM STORY TELLER! THIS IS MY LIFE!.....You SEE my Flashlight WORKING! but it will NOT penetrate the darkness that lies beyond! (and it would refuse to turn the flash  on!) illuminated minimal light!  A Grave stone at the bottom of our  garden. This is going to be proof of a series of event that I have experienced  in this house! Yet... The OWNER BUILT IT!  It is NOT haunted ground! (Not supposed to be anyways!

Yeah ok so, I am the person that is speaking on the video. We live in the netherlands, I do not originate from here, however, I have also been trying to figure out WTF is going on here? (I will make another one during daytime.. I put a fence up.. chicken wire... in hopes that may 2 year old son would not desecrate the ground.

The house I'm living in is that of my stepfather in law, Not my Mother in-laws Husband, Bless his soul, he died in 2014.. choose his own death date... even his way to go... he was ill.. veryyyyyyyy ill.. but the grave stone you see the video is not his, oh no, that is the grave stone of his father (I never met my husbands father, but I spoke to him once, he made me a promise that I so far have been struggling to up hold but I do believe that my husband, and our son is helping with that!!!).  


Since the death of my husbands father and other random shitty worldly things.. (Fuck brexit) we moved, back to the Netherlands.  


Things here are usually calm and peaceful.... The Village in which I live now....Is "the same".  
December he appeared.. I will get a photo of him as soon as I can, for he is the topic of me next chapter in this crazy world around me!  
OK, You all think I'm mad but I will TRY to get a photo of "Him".  
HE is actually a BULL.. A Phantom "Cow" That wanders this ground and a few others (Actually COWS) I see randomly time to time, in between the Christmas trees. Usually the wander through, stop, look at you then wander on and vanish... yeah.. Fun shit eh?  


I have lived here for 3 years.. a bit longer but meh...Things here are strange, ffs I was going so crazy (or so I thought)  That my farther in laws' sister answered my 'WhatsApp' She could help me!  


I thought I was going insane, It turned out I wasn't (I'm not insane and I will recall what happened that night... but I need more clarification... I was speaking in LATIN!)  I have not studied Latin in YEARS but I asked Tante to record it... this is what I said.... "Animas nostras, quia unum sunt, animam nostram ut unum damus". I Will try to get the recording of her Purification of me.....  


It did not work....I STILL SEE and FEEL EVERYONE around me.... I am also half deaf.. not got new hearing aids as of yet...April!!!! :D  I am 36 years old and this shit... i've seen worse but, OH I'm just getting started!

The Dog, he runs in our back door... an out house, if you want to call it that? a ghost dog.. I know it's name but every time Tante tells me it, I come home and forget it! .....Shit...I know and have seen Tante's death Date as 18th July 2023...  
 I just hope that this isn't True... August 23rd 2023 is the death date of my step fatherin law... i just hope i am now correct. :'(  


I hear whispers in the trees of the Dalakker... they are OLD voices but cut off from the fact that people cut their breather-in down to build houses. They Whisper to my son too.. he is only 2 and 1/2, jet HE answers them... I ask him not to.... he is a chatty child.... I, myself am 'sort of' inhuman. I have 2 hearts.  
One is the size of a walnut, and the other if normal sized and both function ok. The oneis like  bypass. They believe that I was a twin absorber, but oh no... I have proven to be much more!   


At this point in time I am typing out... hell.. my life as I se it.. no I'm NOT Schizo, .. my mother had me tested.. hahaha.. but people that have been with me have SEEN what I have seen.

Most of the paranormal that comes to see me.. ..well .. it knows me.. but likes an audience...  


In the next Installment I should probably talk about the haunted forest that I work IN! ...  


I worked just up the road before.. nothing in the building itself but fuck me .. I will tell you all about "The "Twitchier"  (Deemed as the Bird Watcher) in my next installment.
