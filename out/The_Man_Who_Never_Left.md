I grew up in a small town where nothing ever happened. The kind of place where you leave your car unlocked, wave at your neighbors, and expect to live and die within a 10-mile radius. But there was always one house—just one—that nobody ever talked about.

It sat at the very end of my street, an old Victorian that had been abandoned for as long as I could remember. The windows were boarded up, the paint peeled like dead skin, and the yard was a jungle of weeds and thorn bushes. Nobody ever mowed it, yet somehow, the house never seemed to deteriorate beyond its already ruined state. Like time had stopped there.

But the weirdest thing? Every single night at **3:12 AM**, a single light flickered on in the upstairs window.

No one ever saw anyone go in or out. No cars ever pulled into the driveway. The mail never piled up, and the town never sent anyone to condemn the property. It just sat there, waiting.

When I was 17, my friends dared me to check it out. I wanted to brush it off, tell them it was stupid, but the truth is… I was curious. I had always been curious. So, late one night, I grabbed a flashlight and walked down the cracked pavement toward the house, my breath fogging in the cold summer air.

The second I stepped onto the porch, a chill ran through me. The air felt different here—heavier, almost electric. My flashlight flickered, struggling to stay on.

I reached for the doorknob, expecting it to be locked, but the second my fingers brushed against it…

**The door swung open.**

Inside, the air was thick, stale, and **wrong.** The house should’ve smelled like mold and dust, but instead, it carried a faint coppery scent, like old pennies and rotting meat.

The floorboards groaned beneath my weight as I stepped inside. Dust particles floated in the beam of my flashlight, undisturbed for what had to be decades. The furniture was covered in white sheets, but the outlines of old, Victorian-style chairs and tables stood frozen in time. A grandfather clock sat against the far wall, its hands unmoving, permanently stuck at **3:12**.

Then I heard it.

**Footsteps.**

They weren’t coming from upstairs where the light was.

They were coming from **right behind me.**

I spun around, my heart slamming against my ribs. The front door was still open, the night stretching out beyond it. But something felt… off.

Like I wasn’t alone anymore.

The house suddenly felt smaller, as if the walls had inched closer when I wasn’t looking. My breathing quickened, my pulse roaring in my ears. And then—

**A voice.**

Not loud. Not aggressive. Just a whisper, right in my ear.

**“You shouldn’t have come.”**

I bolted. My flashlight tumbled from my hand, rolling across the floor. I didn’t stop to pick it up. I just ran. I barely remember making it back to my house, locking my bedroom door, and diving under the covers like a child afraid of the dark.

The next morning, I told my friends what happened. They laughed, said I was messing with them. But that night, at **3:12 AM**, I woke up with a jolt, my body drenched in sweat.

Something **made** me wake up.

I turned my head toward my window… and froze.

**The light in the old house was still on.**

But this time, something was different.

For the first time ever, **the shadow of a man stood in the window, watching me.**

I told myself it was a trick of the light. That my brain was making things up. That I was just sleep-deprived.

But then, my bedroom door **creaked open.**

I wasn’t home alone.
