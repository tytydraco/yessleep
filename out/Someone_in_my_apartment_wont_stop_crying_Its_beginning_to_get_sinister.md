I can't hear it from my room. Thank god for that.

It's interesting though, it makes me think; we pass by hundreds if not thousands of strangers a day. Yet, we haven't the faintest of an idea what's going on in their lives. What makes them tick, happy, sad. What makes them laugh? What makes them cry?

I have no idea what made that *thing* in the lobby cry.

It started up about two nights ago. Fortunately I live on the fifth floor of a smaller apartment complex, so I'm nowhere near the lobby. I was coming back from the gym when I caught a glimpse of a woman facing the mailboxes we have mounted on the wall. Her clothes looked a little rugged, her hair as quite long as well.

Most people notice if someone else enters the lobby, it doesn't have a lot of room. I was expecting her to flinch or at the very least look my way, but she didn't. She just stood there, facing away. She was sniffling, so I figured it'd be the wrong thing to do to approach.  I simply went about my business, up the flights of stairs that would get me to my cozy abode.

The next morning was an early one, working in the trades makes it so. I descended the stairwell, because our apartment is old and couldn't be bothered to have an elevator. I noticed a strange, droning noise as I got closer towards the lobby. As I was about to come down the last flight of stairs, I could make it out:

Crying.

Weird, I thought to myself. Who's up at 5:30am around here? Most of the apartment residents were either new families or seniors that had no business being up at this time. The thought of a drunkard or some homeless person hopped on substances came to my uneasy mind. I took the last few steps slowly and poked my head into the lobby.

It was the same girl, almost at the same position as before. Her sniffles had turned into a light, but unpleasant sob. Did I leave it be? She seemed harmless, and scared. I mustered up my courage and did something about it.

"You alright?" I called out to her, quietly. "Noticed you were there yesterday, too. Got anyone looking for ya?"

The sobbing ceased, and she looked my way. She seemed quite sickly, her eyes further apart than normal. Her eyes were a bright shade of pink from what I can assume was all the crying.

"I need to stay," she replied, in a voice that sounded like three people speaking at once.

I shrugged it off and went to work.

She was there when I came back. This time, her head was planted on the mailboxes and her crying sounded...angrier?

The unfortunate neighbour that lived close to the mailbox came out from his apartment, with an angry look on his face. He pointed his finger and hovered over the poor woman.

"I've tried to help you four times now! Your crying is getting on my nerves! Leave! Now!" he demanded. Her furious sobbing halted, and I could see her now red eyes fixate on the neighbour. He was a decent guy, must've had a bad day or something.

"Do you need a hand or anything?" I asked, hoping to diffuse the situation a little.

"I'm fine man, I'm fine," he said, waving me off. Honestly I didn't have the immorality or the strength to haul a distraught woman from the complex. I went up the stairs. I got to about the third floor when I heard screaming and yelling from downstairs. I assumed our "on-call" security decided to show up to have the woman escorted off the premises. I thought nothing of it.

I came across the aftermath the next morning, and damn near puked all over the lobby.

There was torn up pieces of body armour, torn up chunks of flesh and hair, and buckets worth of blood strewn across the lobby. How did nobody notice this? I would've expected a whole evacuation of the building at the very least.  I shakily began dealing 9-11 when I heard a familiar, sinister noise.

Crying, coming from that neighbour's apartment.

I noticed the door was cracked open slightly. Something in me was possessed to go in there to look for survivors, or anything really. I heard the crying, it sounded more warped than before. I also heard the sound of something dragging along the floor.

"Anyone home?" I called out, expecting something to pounce on me any minute.

Slowly, the woman emerged from one of the rooms, dragging two bodies in each arm behind her. She was covered in blood. I could almost identify my neighbour, but his head had been caved in too badly. I was unsure who the other one was, his wife maybe? I was frozen in fear, the sound of the warped crying invaded my ears.

She dropped my neighbour, his body hitting the floor with a splat. She pointed towards me.

"I just need to stay, just a little longer. Thank you, I feel better now," she spoke, her voice sounding like a legion of distressed people.

A part of me was hoping the crying would subside, forever. It began again as soon as I shut the door and backed away slowly.

A freakish thing that burned into my ears is that I could hear her running around the apartment dragging the bodies.

I called into work, and then proceeded to barricade myself in my apartment and call the cops. I don't think they believe me, and I'm scared I'm sending them to their deaths. Someone has to do something about it though.

If I step into the stairwell and get to about the third floor, I can still hear it. There's an occasional scream, too. What the hell is it waiting for anyways? "Just a little longer?" what does that even mean?

I'm also terrified that someone else will go and check it out. The noises of the rampaging *thing* are not subtle. Is that on my conscience too? Am I an accomplice in this for not forfeiting my life to fight it? I wanted to put a sign up that would help deter people, but I had no idea where to start.

Multiple people will probably call the entire police force, or more, when they see the carnage that is splattered all over the floor of the lobby.

I took a look at my boots just now, and noticed I left a bloody trail leading up to my apartment.

I just pray that they can handle that thing, and that it doesn't make its way [up the lobby to me.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowAwaytheCJ/)
