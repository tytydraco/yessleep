When I look back on my childhood, I realize how many things I misunderstood how many dangers my imagination painted over with wonder. I grew up in a rough neighborhood, the kind of place where the streets were always cracked, the lights flickered at night, and the people were a mix of tired parents, restless kids, and older men who never said much about their pasts. Even now, something about that place feels heavy in my memory, like the air itself was watching.I was eight the Christmas I thought I saw Santa. I remember waking up thirsty in the middle of the night, the house quiet except for the old heater rattling in the walls. As I walked toward the kitchen, I heard a soft shuffling sound coming from the living room too light to be my mom, too odd to ignore. I stopped beside the chimney, staring at the shadows dancing across the floor.



That’s when I saw him.

A man in a red coat crawled out of the fireplace, his face streaked with ash and chimney soot. His boots were big and black, leaving dirty marks on the carpet. He looked thin too thin for the jolly Santa I imagined but he wore a wide smile that stretched almost unnaturally across his face. His eyes were dark brown, sharp and alert, nothing like the warm, cartoon eyes I knew from Christmas movies.



He pressed a finger to his lips and whispered in a dry crackling voice, “Merry Christmas… I’m Santa. But shh. Don’t tell anyone you saw me. It’ll ruin the magic.”



At eight years old, I didn’t feel fear the way I should have. I just nodded, confused and curious. He spent the next hour sitting on the floor with me, playing with my toys in complete silence, as if noise itself would break some secret rule. He moved slowly and carefully, almost too carefully, like someone trying not to wake a sleeping animal. At the time, I thought he was being nice. Now, thinking back, it feels more like he was listening for something.



When he finally stood to leave, he looked around my room with a strange interest, as if memorizing it. Then he wished me goodnight in that same raspy voice and disappeared back into the dim hallway. By morning, I convinced myself it had been a dream, and eventually the memory sank into that strange place childhood memories go half-real, half-fantasy.

I didn’t think about him again until years later, when I went back home for the holidays. The air smelled the same, cold and dusty, and the neighborhood hadn’t changed much. Most of the old houses were still there, sagging under the weight of time. When I visited my mom, I noticed the house felt smaller, darker, like the walls still held things I’d forgotten.Across the street, an old man stood on his porch, staring. I recognized him not because he’d changed, but because he hadn’t. He had the same dark eyes, the same sharp stare he used to give me when I was little. He’d lived there for as long as I could remember. He always waved at me when I was a kid.

And as I looked at him, something inside me snapped into place. The smile. The eyes. The way he moved.



It was him.
