The first call came in at 2:17 a.m., which wouldn’t have bothered me if I hadn’t already been awake.

I work late. I always have. That night, I was lying in bed scrolling through my phone, half-listening to the hum of traffic outside my apartment. When my phone rang, I almost ignored it. Unknown number. No voicemail icon. I answered out of irritation more than curiosity.

“Hello?”

For a moment, there was only breathing. Not heavy or distorted—just calm, steady breaths, like someone holding the phone too close to their mouth.

“Can I help you?” I asked.

The breathing stopped. Then the call ended.

I told myself it was a wrong number. Or a robocall glitch. I rolled over and tried to sleep.

At 2:17 the next morning, my phone rang again.

Same unknown number.

This time, I didn’t answer. I watched it vibrate itself silent on my nightstand. A few seconds later, a notification popped up: voicemail received.

I listened to it immediately.

It was quiet. No words. Just the sound of movement—fabric rustling, a faint creak, and then a soft tapping noise. Rhythmic. Like fingers on wood. It lasted exactly twelve seconds.

I didn’t sleep after that.

The calls came every night after. Always at 2:17 a.m. If I answered, there was breathing. If I didn’t, there was a voicemail. The sounds changed slightly each time—footsteps, a door hinge, the scrape of something being dragged—but never anything clear enough to identify.

I blocked the number.

The calls still came through.

I contacted my carrier. They told me the number wasn’t active. According to their system, it didn’t exist.

That should have been enough to scare me into leaving, but I stayed. I needed to know what was happening. I started keeping my phone on voice recorder at night, setting it on the nightstand before bed. I wanted proof that I wasn’t imagining things.

On the fifth night, I noticed something new.

Before the phone rang, there was a sound in my apartment.

A soft click.

At first, I thought it was the building settling. Old pipes. Old walls. But when I listened back to the recording the next morning, the sound was unmistakable.

It was the lock on my front door.

Not opening. Just… testing.

That night, after the call, I checked my door. Still locked. Deadbolt in place. No signs of tampering. I stood there longer than I needed to, my hand resting on the knob, listening to the silence on the other side.

The next morning, I found footprints outside my door.

They weren’t muddy or wet. Just faint impressions in the dust of the hallway carpet, leading from the stairwell to my apartment. And stopping there.

No return path.

I reported it to building management. They told me there were no cameras on my floor. They suggested maybe I was stressed. Working too much.

That night, the voicemail changed.

Instead of random sounds, I heard my own voice.

“I’ll answer next time,” it said.

I dropped my phone.

I knew exactly when I had said those words—two nights earlier, muttering to myself after ignoring the call. I had been alone. No one else was there.

I started checking reflections after that. Windows. Mirrors. The dark screen of my TV. I don’t know what I expected to see, but every time my reflection stared back, it felt slightly delayed. Like it was deciding whether to copy me.

The calls stopped after that voicemail.

For three days, nothing happened. No ringing. No messages. I started to feel foolish, embarrassed by how afraid I’d been. I even laughed once, alone in my kitchen, telling myself I needed sleep.

On the fourth night, at 2:17 a.m., my phone didn’t ring.

Someone knocked on my door.

Three slow knocks.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I stood in my bedroom, staring at the hallway, listening.

My phone buzzed in my hand.

A text message. From the same unknown number.

“I’m already inside. You just haven’t noticed yet.”

That’s when I realized the sounds in the voicemails weren’t random. They were familiar. The creak of my bedroom floorboard. The scrape of my kitchen chair. The tapping pattern matched the way I drum my fingers when I’m nervous.

I’m writing this now because the knocking hasn’t stopped. It’s moving—sometimes on the door, sometimes on the wall behind me, sometimes right outside the bedroom.

I checked my front door ten minutes ago.

It was unlocked.

If you ever start getting calls at the same time every night, from a number that doesn’t exist, don’t answer. And don’t assume that silence means it’s gone.

Sometimes it just means it doesn’t need the phone anymore.
