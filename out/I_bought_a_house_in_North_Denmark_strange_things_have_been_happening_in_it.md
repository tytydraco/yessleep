Ever since I was kid, I've always been a very logical and independent person, someone who has always wanted to leave the family's nest to find a place to live on my own and be at peace... cos believe it or not, I was already thinking about these things at the age of 10... Perhaps it was this, that, at just 20 years old, pushed me to leave my parents' house, which I now saw almost as a prison, once and for all, to move into a really nice home just outside Aalborg in the northern countrysides of Denmark (the location was great, and if I wanted to find a good part-time job or start studying again, I could do it cos I lived right next to the city, but not so close as to disturb my peace).

I found it on a website.

The house looked (at least from the photos online) so nice and tidy, both from the outside and inside, it actually was like one of those model homes you see on the cover of magazines. But the most surprising thing was its price... So extremely low!
This was the thing that interested me the most (being a very young and practically broke guy). Although I was interested in the house's very low price, I couldn't help but be suspicious, cos I mean, the house looked amazing, but why in the flying fudge was the price so damn low?? 
Anyway, I immediately decided to put aside my doubts... I had to act logically, because come on if you're not willing to take risks, you'll never get anywhere! So I just decided to leave and move practically right away, in the morning, on the next weekend...

The journey was quite long, 224 km (from Christiansfeld to outside Aalborg), but I managed to arrive just in time in the late afternoon... Welcoming me with an over bearing smile on his face, I found Peter, the seller... He was a fairly young man, who must have been in his early thirties... and looked just like a model employee, you know, the ones you'd picture in stock images. He was wearing black jeans, a white shirt and had dark brown hair and very very light eyes, I repeat, he looked like a very ordinary individual, but... I don't know why, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something wrong about him... something strange, that was not right.

Even the house... that looked so amazing from the photos online had something unusual and felt... off. But I didn't know what, yet.

"Come on in, let's talk about the contract, go ahead!" Peter said calmly as I approached the entrance.

"Ok, I'm coming." I replied coldly "let's make it quick though, I'm hungry..." I continued.

Once inside, we sat at the kitchen table and started discussing.

We'd been talking for about  20 minutes and everything was going ok... until...
I asked Peter why the house price was so low... it was at that moment, that his calm and collected face darkened, in an almost alien-ish way...

"Look, I dont care much... if you don't want to tell me it's ok, it's enough for me to just conclude..." I said firmly, but stopped abruptly. I just couldn't shake the terrible feeling that something was watching me, and it wasn't just Peter...

A shiver ran down my spine as he quickly regained his composure.

"No no, it's ok, although it's very hard for me, there's something I have to tell you. Really..." Peter said to me, regaining his calm expression, but with a shade of darkness hovering on it "You see, this house belonged to my brother Christian," he said... "he was such a joyful person... a really good guy, yes.

He moved into this house just a couple of months ago, can you imagine...

It reminded him a lot of our old home, when we were little, you know." He continued... a forced grin growing on his face.

"However, already after a few days of moving here, he started to change... he became very strange, behaved impulsively and got uncontrollably schizophrenic...

He talked about the voices in his head... 

That they would come and get him...

Horrible things.
He had gone mad...

After a few days we found him in the bathtub, immersed in his own blood, his throat cut, the kitchen knife still in hand... 

suicide... 

my brother... Christian... he... he took his own life!" 

Peter said, his face growing darker, he's demeanor more hostile, the forced grin on his face now an aggressive grimace.

"I'm sorry... I didn't know" I said.

I was starting to feel really uncomfortable...

"It doesn't matter, he's gone now... He's probably always  been crazy and we never knew, or maybe not... but you see, I decided to put this house up for sale to get rid of these terrible memories as soon as possible." He told me, recollecting himself.

I nodded silently.

That same feeling of being watched ruffling me...



We finished our discussion quickly and walked to the entrance. Before leaving though, Peter told me something...

"Hans... I don't believe in ghosts... I'm not superstitious at all, or at least not as much as my twin brother... but please, be careful, because this house doesn't give good vibes to me either... now listen, you'll find a sheet of  paper inside the second drawer of the bedside table, in your bedroom. Christian wrote down a series of "rules" there... I know it's probably useless gibberish, but I decided to keep it anyway, as his last relic. Just in case what he said is actually true... so, if you have to, please make good use of it. You seem like a good guy, so take care of yourself, Hans..."


With that he left.


Now alone in what seemed like the beginning of horror movie I walked back inside to make myself something for dinner.
