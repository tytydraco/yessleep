Have you ever been in love before?

Then you’d know that feeling, that ache that isn’t pain, but still finds its way into your ribs. That steady hum in your chest that tells you you’re exactly where you’re supposed to be.

I asked Elenor to marry me on a rainy Sunday morning in the kitchen of our apartment. The smell of coffee lingered in the air, mixed with the sound of Billie Holiday playing through a cheap Bluetooth speaker and the soft hiss of rain against the window.

She had just spilled egg yolk on her baggy pajama shirt and was half-singing, half-talking to herself as she wiped it with a wet cloth.

“Oh Elenor’s a dumbass who spills shit all the time, If anybody loved her, it’d surely be a crime.”

“Arrest me then,” I said, cutting her off as I knelt behind her, the ring catching a glint of pale morning light.

“Wow, you are so cor—” she started, but her voice caught halfway. Her hands flew to her mouth. The cloth hit the floor with a quiet smack.

“El,” I said softly. “I’ve loved you from the moment I met you.”

“Oh my god, stop,” she said through her hands, eyes already glassy.

“These four years with you… they’ve meant everything to me. I don’t need anything bigger than this, just more of it. More of you.”

I smiled, awkwardly, trying to keep my voice from breaking. “Will you marry me?”

“Yes, of course you idiot.”

I stood, swept her up, kissed her. She was laughing and crying, and I could taste salt and coffee and morning on her lips. When I slipped the ring on her finger, she looked at it like it was a small miracle.

“You could’ve at least waited until I cleaned my shirt,” she said, smiling through tears.

“Well, take it off then,” I said, grinning.

She gasped and tried to wriggle away as I scooped her up and carried her toward the bedroom. She was laughing the whole way, that unguarded, open laugh that made me fall in love with her in the first place.

That Sunday morning was the happiest I’ve ever been.

\*\*\*

Later, lying together in the pale after-light, Elenor rested her hand against my chest, tracing the lines of my collarbone with her finger.

“I have to tell everyone,” she said suddenly, sitting up and grabbing her phone from the nightstand.

She dialed her mom first, sitting on the edge of the bed as she talked. I just watched her, the way her hair caught the light, the way her voice broke between laughter and tears.

I reached over and dragged my fingers down her back in little circles. I could feel her heartbeat through the thin cotton of her shirt.

“Who the hell should I call?” I thought to myself as El giggled in the background.

At that time, I’d lived in the city for just over five years. I moved from my small town for a job fresh out of college. You’d think five years is long enough to make some friends, but the city had proved to be nothing but isolating. The only person I really talked to was my cubicle neighbor, Brian.

That was, of course, before I met Elenor.

We met at a bar I didn’t even want to be at. My coworkers had dragged me there for “team bonding” — a bunch of guys in ill-fitting polos drinking cheap beer and complaining about their “bitch wives.”

I was nursing a Jack and Coke that had long since gone flat when she walked in: the girl in the yellow sundress with chipped nail polish and a messy bun that somehow looked intentional.

She looked like the kind of person who could make a stranger feel at home, and I think that’s exactly what she did to me.

I remember Brian catching me staring. He nudged me, reeking of whiskey, and said, “Go talk to her, man.”

“Nah,” I muttered. “What would I even say?”

“You tell her your name, give her the eyes, conversation’ll make itself. Trust me.”

Before I could argue, he grabbed my wallet and chucked it toward the bar—it landed right at her feet.

“Go fetch, buddy,” he said, grinning like a fool.

I should’ve been furious, but instead I just… went.

“Hey, sorry… my friend’s an idiot,” I said, crouching to pick it up.

She smirked. “I can see that.”

“I swear I don’t usually make my entrances like this.”

“Shame,” she said, tilting her head. “It’s a bold move.”

I smiled. “Worked though, didn’t it?”

She smiled back, eyes glinting. “Guess it did.”

“So,” I said, still half-smiling, “what’s your name?”

“Elenor.”

By the end of the night we were the last two people in the bar, talking about everything from favourite movies to our deepest fears.

After that, I started to actually have a social life. Her friends became my friends, her world absorbed mine. But when I tried to think of someone who was mine to call with the good news, no one came to mind.

I scrolled through my contacts and landed on one name I hadn’t seen in years.

Nick. My brother.

I stared at it for a while, thumb hovering. Then I hit “call.”

The call rang four times before he picked up.

“Holy shit,” Nick said, his voice crackling through the speaker. “No way. The city boy lives.”

I smiled. “Hey, man.”

“Five years, huh? I thought you got abducted or something.”

“Something like that,” I said. “Work’s been... busy.”

“Bullshit. You just hate small talk.”

He wasn’t wrong. I smiled despite myself. “Fair point.”

There was a pause—the kind that sits between two people who used to talk without thinking and now have to remember how.

“So what’s up, Al?” he asked finally. “Not that I’m not honored by your once-a-decade phone call.”

“I’m engaged,” I said, before I could chicken out.

The silence lasted just long enough for me to think the call dropped. Then:

“No shit.”

“Yeah. Her name’s Elenor.”

“Elenor,” he repeated, drawing out the vowels. “Damn, Al. You actually did it. You found someone who can put up with you.”

“Barely,” I said. “She still thinks I’m funny, though. I’m not gonna question it.”

He laughed, that deep, full laugh that sounded exactly the same as when we were kids.

“Damn. Mom would’ve lost her mind.”

I hesitated before answering. “Yeah. Probably.”

He didn’t push it. We hadn’t talked about our parents in years, and the silence between that topic was a kind of unspoken agreement.

“So what’s she like?” he asked, shifting the weight of the conversation.

I leaned back on the couch, looking over at El in the kitchen. She was still on her phone, laughing.

“She’s... the best thing that’s ever happened to me. Smart, funny, way too good for me.”

“Good,” he said simply, and I could hear the warmth in it. “You deserve that.”

I leaned back into the couch. For a moment I just listened to his breathing on the other end of the line. It was strange how quickly things between us started to feel easy again, like muscle memory you didn’t know you still had.

“What about you?” I asked. “What’ve you been up to?”

He let out a short laugh. “Ah, you know. Working construction mostly. Still in town. Still driving Dad’s old truck.”

“Does it still run?”

“Barely,” he said. “But it’s got character. So do I.”

I smiled. “Same old Nick.”

“Pretty much,” he said. “Although, there’s this girl. Hailey.”

“Hailey?” I repeated, sitting up a little. “Like, Hailey from high school? Blonde hair, loud laugh, used to date Jared *\[redacted\]*?”

“The one and only.”

“No way,” I said, grinning. “You’re dating Hailey *\[redacted\]*?”

“Yeah. Wild, right? Ran into her at the grocery store a couple months back. One thing led to another, now she’s got me eating salads and doing yoga.”

“Oh no,” I said. “She’s turned you into a citizen.”

“Shut up,” he laughed. “She’s good for me. We’re still figuring stuff out, but she’s... solid. Different.”

“That’s awesome, man,” I said. “Seriously.”

“Yeah, well, she’s got all these ideas about, like, bettering ourselves. We’re actually supposed to go to some couples retreat thing next weekend.” He paused, clearly amused with himself. “She got this pamphlet from some Amish-looking lady outside a farmer’s market. Says it’s this digital detox, back-to-basics kind of place.”

“That sounds... sketchy,” I said, laughing. “You sure she didn’t recruit you into a cult?”

“Hey, I thought the same thing,” he said. “But Hailey’s all in. Thinks it’ll be good for us. Get away from the world for a few days, clear our heads. Something about ‘reconnecting with traditional values.’ Whatever that means.”

“Wow,” I said. “That’s a sentence I never thought I’d hear from you.”

“Right? But apparently there’s hiking, home-cooked meals, farm animals... She keeps calling it Stillwater Farms.”

“Stillwater Farms,” I repeated. “That sounds like either a retirement community or a brand of bottled water.”

Nick laughed. “Yeah, I know. I told her it sounds like a horror movie. She didn’t find that as funny as I did.”

“She wouldn’t,” I said, smiling. “Hailey always took things too seriously.”

“Yeah, well,” he said, “she’s excited. And honestly, it might be good for us. Things have been... a little rocky lately.”

I heard the honesty there, tucked between the humor. He tried to gloss over it. “Anyway, I was thinking, you and your lady should come. Make it a double thing. She gets her couples therapy, I get to hang with my brother again. Win-win.”

I laughed. “You’re inviting me to a couples retreat that you know practically nothing about?”

“Exactly,” he said. “If it’s a disaster, at least I’ll have backup.”

“I don’t know, man. A weekend in the middle of nowhere with you and Hailey? Sounds like a trap.”

“You’re scared I’ll outshine you.”

“Yeah,” I said. “That’s definitely it.”

He chuckled. “Come on, Al. I’d love to meet Elenor. It’s been forever. We’ll grab a couple cabins, get drunk on organic wine or goat’s milk or whatever they’re serving.”

I hesitated, glancing toward the kitchen where Elenor’s soft voice still murmured over the phone. “Yeah,” I said finally. “That actually sounds... nice.”

“You serious?” he said. “Hell yeah! I’ll tell Hailey she gets her couples retreat after all. I’ll text you the details.”

“Alright,” I said, smiling. “It’ll be good to see you, Nick.”

“You too, Al.” His tone softened, just for a second. “Feels good hearing your voice again.”

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “You too, man.”

When the call ended, I sat there for a while, listening to the rain fade against the window.

Elenor walked back into the room, phone in hand, glowing from the conversation. “Who was that?”

“My brother,” I said. “He wants us to go away with him and his girlfriend next weekend. Some couples retreat thing.”

“Really?” she said. “What kind of retreat?”

“Stillwater Farms,” I said. “Apparently it’s all about... reconnecting.”

She smiled. “That doesn’t sound so bad.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Guess not.”

But as I looked back at my phone with the buzz of a text from Nick, the words *Stillwater Farms* sat there on the screen like they were waiting for something.

***— Day 1 —***

We left the city on a Friday morning that couldn’t make up its mind about the weather. The kind of gray that felt temporary, like the sky was holding its breath.

Elenor packed snacks, playlists, and enough optimism to power the car. I packed one duffel bag and a quiet knot in my stomach I couldn’t quite name.

Nick had texted me the directions the night before; not an address, just a pin dropped in the middle of nowhere, with a message that said:

*Follow the road till it ends. They said they’ll meet us there.*

Elenor glanced at it while I was driving. “That’s not... weird at all.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Apparently we’re being met by our spirit guide or something.”

She laughed, kicking her bare feet up on the dash. The smell of coconut lotion filled the car.

“You think your brother’s nervous?”

“About what?”

“Meeting me. You said you guys haven’t seen each other in forever.”

I thought about that for a second. “He’ll probably pretend he’s not. That’s kind of his thing.”

Somewhere around noon, the city noise had completely dropped out. No hum of traffic, no skyline. Just trees, thick and patient, standing in rows that got taller and older the farther we went.

By the time we reached the end of the pavement, it had turned to gravel, and the air had changed, thicker somehow, smelling faintly of wet hay and cedar.

Nick’s truck was waiting just ahead, parked crooked at the edge of the road. He leaned against the hood, arms crossed, that same cocky smirk plastered across his face.

Elenor nudged me. “He looks exactly how I pictured him.”

“How’s that?”

“Like trouble that never fully grew up.”

She wasn’t wrong.

Hailey was there too, perched on the passenger side, arms crossed, blonde hair tied back. She looked just as she had in high school.

When Nick saw us pull up, he straightened and spread his arms like we’d just driven into a reunion movie.

“Look at this city slicker!”

I stepped out. For a second we just stared at each other; both of us realizing how long five years actually was. Then he closed the distance and pulled me into a hug.

It wasn’t one of those polite hugs people give out of obligation. It was solid, unspoken, real. I hadn’t realized how much I’d missed him, how much I’d loved him, until that moment.

When he finally let go, he looked me over and grinned. “You’ve gotten soft.”

“And you’ve gotten older.”

He grinned. “You’re damn right.”

Elenor came around the car, and I saw Nick’s posture shift immediately. He smiled wider—proud.

“You must be the one who said yes to this idiot.”

“That’s me,” she said, shaking his hand. “You must be the brother who threw him into walls as a kid.”

Nick laughed. “You’ve done your homework.”

Hailey joined us, smiling like someone trying to prove a point. “Alex,” she said.

It was the first time I’d heard her say my name since high school.

“Long time.”

“Yeah,” I said. “You look the same.”

She rolled her eyes. “I’ll take it.”

Nick clapped his hands together. “Alright, lovebirds. Ready for the middle of nowhere?”

“Lead the way,” I said.

We followed Nick’s truck down a dirt road, dust curling in the air like pale smoke. The road narrowed into a single lane bordered by tall oaks and maples, their branches stitching together above us until the sunlight broke into trembling gold patches across the hood.

Elenor rolled down her window and leaned her arm out. “Smells different out here,” she said.

“Like dirt?”

“Like earth,” she corrected, smiling. “Real earth. Not the kind that comes in a bag.”

Ten minutes later, the GPS lost signal completely. The map froze mid-scroll, our blue dot hovering over a blank patch of green.

Then, without warning, the road ended. It didn’t curve or split, it just stopped.

Nick’s truck slowed to a crawl, brake lights glowing through the settling dust. He stepped out, squinting at the treeline like he was trying to find something.

That’s when I saw her.

A woman stood at the edge of the trees, half-lit by the sun breaking through the clouds. Early fifties, maybe. Gray hair tied in a neat braid, a simple linen dress the color of wet clay. Her face was lined but gentle—the kind of face you’d trust without thinking about it.

She looked like she’d been waiting.

Nick waved like this was perfectly normal. “You must be Mae!”

Her smile warmed easily, revealing faint dimples. “You must be Nicholas,” she said, her voice smooth and steady, touched with a southern accent that made you feel at home. “We were starting to think the road swallowed you up.”

Nick laughed. “Wouldn’t be the first time. This my brother, Alex, and his fiancée, Elenor. And you’ve met Hailey before.”

Mae turned to us, her eyes kind. “Welcome. You made good time.”

Elenor smiled, brushing a strand of hair from her face. “We weren’t sure we were in the right place. The road just kind of... ends.”

Mae chuckled softly. “The maps don’t quite know what to do with us. The farm’s further in, and the roads don’t show up online. We use this spot as a meeting place, easier for newcomers.”

She gestured to the old pickup idling nearby. A man sat in the driver’s seat, tall and broad-shouldered, a sun-faded hat shading his face. He gave a polite nod but didn’t get out.

“That there is Harlan,” Mae said. “He’ll take the lead. It’s not far.”

There was something so effortlessly sure about her: a composure that made you feel foolish for being uncertain. She didn’t have the hollow cheer of a tour guide or the stiffness of someone running a business. She just seemed… steady.

Elenor leaned closer to me. “She’s sweet,” she whispered.

“Yeah,” I said, my voice lower than I meant it to be.

Mae smiled again, meeting my eyes like she’d heard me anyway.

“Shall we?”

Nick clapped me on the back. “Adventure time, little brother.”

I forced a grin. “Yeah. Let’s do it.”

El and I climbed into the bed of Nick’s truck; there was no way my Civic would’ve made it down the muddy trail ahead.

The smell of wet soil and exhaust filled the air. Light filtered through branches in long, molten beams that never seemed to move, frozen midair like dust caught in amber.

Elenor rested her head against my shoulder, swaying gently as the truck rolled through the mud.

As the trees closed in, I glanced back at my car parked at the edge of the lane. The windshield caught the sunlight, flashing once before the trees swallowed it completely.

The trees thinned, and then, suddenly, the land opened up.

\*\*\*

Stillwater Farms spread out before us, quiet and sun-soaked. The white farmhouse sat in the center like it had always been there, its paint softened by decades of rain. A rust-red barn leaned nearby, half swallowed in shadow. Wooden fences traced the hills in looping, uneven lines.

When Nick cut the truck’s engine, the stillness rose to meet us—not silence exactly, but a hush filled with the small, living sounds of the place: insects clicking in the grass, a pulley creaking on a line, the faint bleat of a goat far off.

Harlan climbed out of their truck first. Up close, he looked even bigger, shoulders squared, face unreadable beneath the brim of his faded baseball hat. He gave Mae a short nod, then turned toward the barn. The weight of him seemed to pull the air along as he walked away.

On the porch, a man sat with his hat in his lap, eyes on us the whole time. He didn’t move until we were close enough to hear the porch boards breathe under our feet. Then he stood, and the simple act of it made the air feel more serious.

“You must be the travelers Mae told me about,” he said. His voice was low and even—the kind that didn’t need to be loud to be heard. “The road’s a teacher, isn’t it? Always finds a way to humble you.”

“This is Abel,” Mae said, touching his arm with a familiarity that read like gravity. “My husband.”

Abel’s gaze moved over us in no rush: Nick first, then Hailey, then me, then El. Not weighing, not judging. Seeing.

“You’re welcome here,” he said. “All who come in good faith are.”

Hailey beamed. “It’s so beautiful. This is exactly what I pictured.”

“Pictures are flatter than places,” Abel said, one corner of his mouth tipping. “Places insist.”

Mae’s smile widened at that, as if he’d said a private joke out loud. “Before supper, a little orientation,” she said. “Then a short walk, if you’ve got the legs for it.”

We followed her inside for the “little orientation.” The entry smelled like cedar, heat, and something baking. Along the far wall stood a small table: plain wood, and a wicker basket in the center.

“We keep Stillwater simple,” Mae said. “This is a retreat from noise—so we leave the noise behind.”

She tapped the basket lightly. “Phones, watches, anything electric. They’ll be safe here until you head home.”

Nick shot me a look like *be cool*. He dropped his phone in first. Hailey followed. El squeezed my hand and set hers down gently. Mine went in last.

Mae lifted the basket. “Safe as houses,” she said, and disappeared through a side door. When she returned, the basket was empty. “Now. Water.”

The way she said it made me pay attention.

Abel nodded toward the kitchen window. “We keep a separate tank out back for guests,” he said. “Good, clean rainwater. If you need a drink, a wash, anything, use that. The well is for the house.”

Hailey tilted her head. “Is the well contaminated?”

“The well’s old,” Abel said. “Minerals in it can make newcomers mighty sick. Your bodies aren’t used to it.” His tone was ordinary, practical, almost apologetic. “Use the tank and you’ll be right as rain.”

I glanced past him. Through the window, I could see a tall, black-rimmed tank set off from the house, a spigot glinting in the light.

“Shall we stretch our legs?” Mae asked.

\*\*\*

We stepped back out into the late afternoon that felt like it had stalled five minutes before sunset. Abel walked beside us, hat in hand; Mae set the pace without seeming to.

We crossed the yard to a kitchen garden laid out in neat squares: herbs, lettuces, rows of tomatoes strung on twine. A woman straightened up from the dirt as we approached, wiping her hands on a flour-sack towel. Thirty-five by the look of her, hair tied back, sleeves rolled to the elbow. Her forearms were strong in a way you only get from work.

“This is Ruth,” Mae said. “Keeps us honest.”

Ruth offered each of us a firm handshake, friendly but efficient. “If you feel like earning your supper, I’ll put you to real work by morning,” she said, not unkind. “We’ll need an early start. Rain took the soil from the east row.”

Nick grinned. “I can dig.”

“Good,” Ruth said. “You’ve got the arms for it.”

Hailey’s smile stiffened, a quick flash of something territorial crossing her face before she looked away.

Ruth moved on before it turned awkward, humming a tune under her breath that I couldn’t place, something old and crooked, like a lullaby remembered halfway.

From there, Mae led us along a fence line toward the barn. A man about my age stood at a sagging gate, coaxing a hinge back into shape with a handful of nails and a hammer. A wheat stem parked at the corner of his mouth, and an easy grin on his face.

“Jonah,” Mae said. “If it’s broken, he’ll fix it. If it’s not broken, he’ll fix it anyway.”

Jonah stuck out a hand to Nick first, then me. His palm was rough but warm. “Ah, a city boy,” he added, friendly. “We’ve got a rehab program for soft hands.”

Nick laughed. “I think he prefers to supervise.”

“Supervisors get blisters too,” Jonah said. “Ruth sees to it.”

From the barn loft, a skinny young man whistled and waved before vanishing again.

“That’ll be Silas,” Jonah said, amused. “Don’t feed him after dark.”

“Silas,” I repeated.

“You’ll know him when you know him,” Jonah said.

Mae and Abel led us on toward the animal pens. Chickens scratched in the dirt near a small shed. A girl sat among them, legs crossed, braiding flowers into her hair. For a moment I thought she was much younger than she was supposed to be, thirteen, maybe fourteen at most. Barefoot, dress hem torn.

When she noticed us, she scrambled up and dusted off her knees. “You’re new,” she said.

Elenor smiled. “We are.”

The girl’s eyes darted to Elenor’s hand, to the ring there. “Pretty,” she whispered, then paused, thoughtful. “Do you like lemon or blackberry better?”

“For what?” Elenor asked, laughing.

“Just better.”

“Blackberry.”

The girl nodded like she’d been given an answer to a riddle, and hurried off, bare heels flashing in the dust.

Abel watched her go, something like pride softening his features. “And that’s Clara,” he said. “That girl collects sunbeams like they’re chores.”

We passed the tank Abel had mentioned, black-ribbed, cool in the shadow of the house. A tin ladle hung from a nail beneath the spigot. Beside it, a hand-lettered sign: GUEST WATER.

Past the tank, the land rolled down toward a line of trees that gathered thick and dark at the edge of a field. From somewhere inside them, you could hear water, not loud, not obvious, just the steady hush of it, like someone whispering in the next room.

Elenor cocked her head. “Do you hear that?”

“Wind in the leaves,” Abel said easily, though there wasn’t any wind. “Best to keep out of those woods. Curiosity’s a debt that doesn’t stop collecting once you owe it.”

Mae laid a hand on his arm, her voice soft but certain. “He’s right. Plenty of guests have come back from those woods with twisted ankles and bloodied shins. The ground turns mean out there, best to keep to the flat land where it’s kind.”

“Aye.” Abel agreed absently.

I smiled like I believed them, but I could tell the warning wasn’t about the terrain.

We looped back toward the house before the light could decide which way to fall. Just to the right of the main house stood a small guest cabin, two narrow bedrooms split by a short hall, with a shared washroom tucked behind it under a sloped awning.

“This one’s for you two,” Mae said, pointing to the door on the left. “And the one down the hall is for your brother and Hailey.”

Elenor ran her fingers over an embroidered quilt. “It’s beautiful,” she said.

Mae nodded. “The hands that make things put love in them. That’s what lasts.”

Then she left us alone, her footsteps fading into the hall.

El wandered the small space, opening drawers, smiling at the little note on the bedside table: *Welcome, Alex & Elenor.*

“This is so cute,” El said. “It’s like staying at a museum you can touch.”

I stood at the window and watched Harlan cross the yard with a log slung over one shoulder. He carried it the way I’d carry a backpack: absent, unbothered. For a second, his eyes lifted and met mine through the glass. Not hostile. Not curious. Just a long, flat look with something old behind it. Then he went back to the work that was already finished in his mind.

“I’m gonna find a washroom,” El said, squeezing my shoulder as she passed.

“Oh, alright, I’ll wait out front.”

I stepped outside. The air had grown heavier, the gold of it deep enough to taste. Abel stood at the edge of the porch, lighting a lantern, the match burning close to his fingers before he bothered to shake it out.

“It’s quiet here,” I said, walking up beside him.

He watched the flame steady behind the glass. “Sometimes the things that change us are quieter than we imagine,” he said. “By the time you see them, they feel like they were always part of you.”

The lantern light flickered against his face, carving the lines deeper. From inside came Mae’s voice.

“Supper,” she called.

Abel hung the lantern on its hook and straightened. El, Nick, and Hailey stepped out from the guest cabin at the same time, drawn by the sound of a dinner bell.

Abel held the door open for all of us, that same patient calm still in his eyes.

“Come eat,” he said. “You’ll need your strength for the morning.”

\*\*\*

The dining room was long and low, wood-dark and humming with warmth. Lanterns lined the walls, their glass fogged from heat, their light folding everything in amber. The table dominated the room, one heavy plank of cedar that looked older than anyone sitting around it.

Bowls steamed between us. Mae moved quietly, ladling stew with the slow confidence of repetition. “Don’t be shy,” she said, smiling. “The food tastes better when it disappears.”

Abel sat at the head of the table, posture upright but easy, like he’d been carved that way. Harlan sat near the door, shoulders filling his corner, silent as he had been since we’d arrived. Ruth and Jonah faced each other like a pair long used to working side by side. Silas lounged two seats down, tipping his chair on one leg.

It was hard not to feel like we’d wandered into someone else’s rhythm—a pattern mid-beat.

The family didn’t speak much at first. Only the sound of spoons scraping bowls, of Mae refilling plates before anyone could ask.

Mae broke the silence with a smile. “You’ve met most of us already, haven’t you?”

Nick nodded, mouth full. “Think so.”

She gestured gently with her spoon. “Ruth runs the garden and keeps us all fed. Jonah fixes what time breaks. Silas… tries to help.”

That earned a faint laugh from the others.

Silas grinned. “You’re just jealous I work smarter, not harder.”

“Smarter?” Ruth said. “Is that what you call hiding in the loft?”

“Observation deck,” he said. “Better view.”

Jonah snorted. “Better excuse.”

Abel didn’t look up, but the corner of his mouth twitched.

Even Mae chuckled softly, shaking her head. “You see what I live with.”

Elenor smiled at that. “Feels like home already.”

“Hopefully not too much,” Mae said gently. “The world out there’s a hard habit to break.”

Nick gestured toward me with his fork. “We’re the reason you’ve got two city folks at your table. Figured they could use a break from concrete.”

Elenor smiled. “And smog. Don’t forget the smog.”

Hailey grinned. “And rent.”

I laughed softly. “Yeah, mostly rent. City’ll charge you for air if you let it.”

Mae tilted her head. “And yet you stayed.”

I thought about it. “Habit, I guess. You work so hard to afford a life, you forget to live it.”

Abel raised his glass slightly. “Quiet’s not free either,” he said. “You just pay for it differently.”

The fire popped. Nobody spoke for a moment.

Then Mae’s voice softened. “Where’s Granddad tonight?”

Abel didn’t look up from his plate. “In his room,” he said. “Said he needed to listen awhile.”

Jonah nodded, swallowing. “The ground’s been stirring again.”

Mae nodded like that made sense. It didn’t.

The door creaked open behind us.

A girl stepped in, barefoot, dress smudged with dirt. Her braid hung loose, and there were dark stains beneath her fingernails—not wet, but not old either.

Clara.

She kept her eyes down, slipping into her chair like she’d been there all along. Mae placed a bowl in front of her without a word.

Silas leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. “You wash up with mud now, kid?”

Clara ignored him.

He grinned wider. “Guess that’s one way to blend in with the pigs.”

Jonah gave a quiet “Silas,” under his breath, but it did nothing.

Silas dipped his spoon, flicked a bit of stew at her sleeve. “Missed a spot.”

She looked up, expression calm but flat. “You done?”

“Just making conversation.”

“Try harder,” she said, voice low.

Silas laughed, a dry, empty sound. “Careful, sister. You’re starting to sound like Ruth.”

That was when Harlan stood.

The chair’s scrape cut through everything. He didn’t say a word, didn’t need to. His shadow stretched the length of the table.

Silas’ grin faltered. “Kidding,” he said softly. “Just kidding.”

Abel didn’t raise his voice. “Harlan.”

The big man’s head turned slightly.

“Sit.”

He did.

Then Abel looked at Silas, calm and final. “You don’t sharpen a knife on family.”

Silas nodded once, eyes low. “Yes, sir.”

The room exhaled.

Clara finally glanced at Harlan, the ghost of a smile curling at her mouth. “Calm down, big guy. I can handle him.”

A few small laughs slipped through the tension. Mae’s hand brushed Clara’s shoulder as she passed, steadying, grounding.

The meal carried on—slower now, but softer. Ruth asked Nick about his work, curious in a quiet, measured way. Mae asked Elenor about her ring, her smile genuine. Abel mostly listened, weighing silences.

The food was rich, the warmth steady. But every so often, I caught myself noticing the details: like how the family drank from old, earthen mugs instead of the clear glasses set for us, I couldn’t quite tell what they were drinking.

Abel’s hand rested near his cup, but his eyes kept drifting toward the window, as if something out there was listening too.

When Mae finally rose, she did so gently, her voice the soft close of a hymn. “You’ve all had a long day. Tomorrow starts early. The light comes quick here.”

Abel stood as well, his chair groaning. “Rest well,” he said. “Work or not, everyone contributes here.”

Back in the guest bathroom, the air felt cooler. Hailey leaned against the sink, hair tied up, a half-drunk glass of wine in her hand.

“They’re nice,” she said, “but that was... different.”

Nick grinned, rolling up his sleeves as he washed his hands. “Different’s good. I didn’t see anyone glued to a phone.”

“Maybe because they took them all,” Hailey said. “Pretty sure that counts as kidnapping.”

Elenor sat on the edge of the counter, towel over her lap. “They just have their way of doing things. It’s kind of refreshing, actually.”

“Until they say grace over a fresh guest stew,” Hailey muttered.

Nick chuckled. “Hey, you’re the one who wanted to come. You’re just paranoid.”

“I’m aware,” she said, taking another sip. “Doesn’t mean I’m wrong.”

I turned on the tap. It gurgled, coughed, then fell silent. Elenor pointed to the black drum in the corner. “Guest water,” she said.

Hailey crossed her arms. “It’s weird we can’t even use the tap. What happens if you forget?”

Nick shrugged. “Guess you don’t forget.”

Elenor smiled faintly. “You guys think too much. It’s just plumbing.”

“Maybe,” Hailey said, glancing toward the window. “Or maybe it’s something else.”

Nick stepped behind her, pressing a kiss to her temple. “It’s just old pipes, babe. We’re fine.”

She relaxed slightly, smiling despite herself. “Fine. But if I start growing gills, I’m blaming you.”

Elenor laughed softly. “God, you’re dramatic.”

“Occupational hazard,” Hailey said. “I like to keep the mood lively.”

The light flickered once and steadied.

Nick stretched, yawning. “Alright, campers. Big day tomorrow.”

Elenor stood, brushing her hair over one shoulder. “You coming?”

“In a sec,” I said, glancing at the window one last time. The farmhouse glowed faintly through the trees, lanterns still burning inside.

Elenor touched my arm. “Come on.”

I followed her, closing the door softly behind us.

The night felt thick around us, the air cool and wet. Above, the stars burned sharp and endless—millions of diamonds I’d forgotten the city had stolen from me.

\*\*\*

The guest cabin held the day’s warmth like a kept secret.

The lantern on the dresser hissed low, its flame cupped in glass, throwing a soft amber sway across the walls. Outside, the crickets had gone still. The quiet wasn’t empty, just dense, like a blanket pulled over the night.

Elenor sat cross-legged on the bed, brushing her hair. I watched her reflection in the small mirror: the way her eyes didn’t quite look at herself but at the space around her, as if the room were a pond and she was checking what moved beneath the surface.

“You know,” she said softly, “for a place this quiet, it doesn’t feel empty.”

I was half-lying on the quilt, propped on one elbow. “No. It doesn’t.”

She set the brush down and turned, that small smile widening just enough to reach me. She looked like home, the kind that makes you forget what time is doing to you.

When she crawled into bed, the quilt lifted with a papery whisper. Her palm found my chest, tracing slow, absent shapes. Her knee brushed mine; the mattress sighed, old but steady.

“You think they’re asleep already?” she whispered.

I glanced toward the door. “Feels like the whole farm is.”

She smiled. “Then I guess it’s just us.”

She kissed me, soft at first, then deeper, the kind of kiss that pulls the world in close. My hand slipped to the back of her neck, her pulse warm beneath my thumb. The lantern light wavered and set our shadows breathing on the walls.

We moved the way you do when you’re trying not to wake a house: slow, familiar, reverent. For a while, the world was only breath and skin and the heat of being known.

She laughed softly into my neck. “You packed the condoms, right?”

“Drawer,” I murmured.

Her hand reached past me, the drawer giving a small wooden sigh. A rustle, then stillness.

“They’re not here.”

I blinked. “What?”

“The condoms. You sure you packed them?”

I leaned over and looked into the drawer. No box. No wrappers.

“I swear I put them right there. Maybe Nick stole 'em?” I said. “We’ll check in the morning.”

“Yeah,” she said quietly. “Morning.”

She came back to me, though the rhythm was different now, something cautious beneath the warmth.

Then I felt it: the smallest thread of air against my ankle, cool, damp, shaped like a breath slipping through the crack beneath the door.

I froze.

Elenor did too. Our breathing fell out of sync.

“What?” she whispered.

The quiet had shifted tones, same silence, different weight.

A board bent. Not the lazy sigh of old wood, but a careful test of pressure. Then a pause. And in that pause came a breath: long, uneven, dragged through a throat that didn’t quite know how to be quiet. A wet, rasping inhale.

Elenor’s hand tightened on my arm. “Alex.”

The door wasn’t shut all the way. A thin seam of dark where wood should’ve met wood. I remembered closing it, remembered the click. The gap was small, but wide enough to imagine an eye behind it.

“We closed that,” I said, barely above air.

The breathing came again, slow and steady, a soft gurgle like a man half drowning.

“Nick?” El tried.

Silence answered. Then another soft exhale, hot and damp, threading through the crack.

I slipped from the bed. The floor met my feet like ice. The lamp’s glow reached only halfway across the room, beyond that, everything was a suggestion.

“I’ll check,” I whispered.

“Alex, don’t—”

But I was already opening the door.

Nothing.

The hall pressed in close, walls breathing with the heat of the day. The lamp at the far end had burned down to an amber pulse. My heart made too much sound.

I stepped toward Nick and Hailey’s door, the boards groaning softly beneath my weight. A line of light glowed under their door, steady, human. I knocked lightly.

“Nick.”

A muffled voice came from the other side. “Jesus, man. You good?”

“Did you hear anything? Breathing? Steps?”

There was a pause. Sheets rustling. Hailey’s tired voice somewhere in the mix. Nick laughed, low and hoarse. “Pretty sure that was you, dude. You two aren’t exactly subtle.”

“Not that,” I said. “Someone was outside our door.”

His tone changed. “You serious?”

“Yeah.”

He hesitated, then said, “Probably the wind. This place creaks like hell.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Probably.”

But the air didn’t move. Not even a whisper.

When I turned back, my throat went dry.

The front door of the guest cabin was standing wide open.

Beyond it, the night was a flat sheet of black. The curtain beside the frame swayed once, then stopped dead.

For a moment, I couldn’t move. Something had either just left—or entered.

“Nick,” I called softly, but their door stayed shut.

Wearing nothing but my boxers, I took a step toward the open doorway. The air that started to pour in from outside was cold, metallic, carrying the smell of wet leaves and soil. The yard stretched beyond: a wash of colorless shapes, the fence like a spine against the horizon.

And then it hit me like a stone to the gut: *Elenor*.

I ran for our room, hoping, praying, that something hadn’t reached her before I could.

The boards wailed under me. The lamp flickered once, as if flinching from the noise. I reached our door, my hand slapping the wood as I went to push it open, but my palm landed on something warm.

Not warm like sun-touched wood. Warm like skin. Damp. The kind of warmth that lingers after a mouth.

I yanked my hand back. Someone had been standing there. Breathing against the door.

I shoved it open.

Elenor sat up in bed, eyes wide. “Jesus—Alex?”

I scanned the room. Empty. Just the lantern glow, the quilts, the open drawer.

“Door was open,” I said. My voice didn’t sound like mine.

“What?”

“The front door. Wide open.”

She stared at me. The silence between us felt like static.

I shut our door hard and twisted the latch until it caught. Then dragged the chair from the corner and jammed it under the knob.

“If that door opens again, I’m going to lose my shit.”

Elenor’s eyes followed me as I climbed back into bed. “You sure it wasn’t the wind?”

“No,” I said. “Not the wind.”

We didn’t touch. The air between us felt thick—watched.

As I sat awake and watched the door fade into shadow, I swore I could still hear breathing softly through the wood, like the cabin itself had learned the rhythm of our sleep, and was keeping time.
