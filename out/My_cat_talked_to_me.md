I've been pretty sick recently, so sorry if some of the details aren't clear. 

I live by myself with my 3 cats, Coz, Jaks, and Paws McGraw (Paws). My Russian Blue, Coz, is the oldest, he's been with us for 12 years now? Paws and Jaks are both 3yr old tabbies, they came from the same litter. Paws and Jaks share the same brown and black coat, contrast to Coz's silver blue.

We both have our own rooms in the apartment, sharing a single bathroom. I sleep in my fully furnished bedroom, a dresser, a bed, a chair, and a tv, the essentials. Their room has 3 kitty boxes for all of them, overkill, I know, but Coz won't pee in the other boxes and it seems the other 2 picked up on it. So now all of them have their own box.

The problem arised last week. I do the normal and change the cat's litter first thing in the morning. I fill their boxes with ultra micro crystal kitty litter, it's soft and it clumps nice, so it's what I usually use. It also smells quite good too, tends to make me sit in their room more than mine. 

They all rush to their freshly changed boxes to relieve themselves. If I don't change it for a while they tend to poop on the floor. Coz goes last after the other two, he's been slower since his hip was shattered by a car 5 or sum years ago. Ever since then he walks with a limp and he can't jump up onto taller things including my bed and it's painful to pick him up. Sometimes sleep in his room with him so I can remember what it was like before the accident. 

I greet them with the classic, "Good morning, boys!"

I get a meow out of Paws, but the other two are preoccupied with using the bathroom. I make myself breakfast and fill their bowls. The sound of the food clashing with the metal bowl filled the air and the 3 boys clamber over to excitedly eat their food. Again, neither of them will eat out of the same bowl, but they also don't like their bowls next to each other or they'll refuse to eat. 

After they all munch down, they go on their merry way doing whatever cats do in their free time. Me on the other hand, I have to go to work as a mortician for 10 hours a day everyday. I make pretty good money, so cash has never been an issue for me. Considering I live in a pretty populated city, we're constantly busy. Death is a lot more common than you think.

Anyways, after a long exhausting day at the prep room, I come home past midnight to a broken vase on the floor. The cats are all sleeping at this point, but I know it wasn't Coz, so it had to have been Jaks or Paws. 

I walked into their room after sweeping up the mess, to witness each one laying in separate corners. Jaks is still awake grooming himself and the other two are nestled into their kitty beds.

I throw myself onto the floor and to my dismay, Jaks comes over to inspect the situation.

"Hey buddy," I said quietly as he rubbed his head on me.

I start petting his fur and I notice his side is abnormally wet. At first I thought it was just some slobber. So I went to wipe it off and all the sudden Jaks let's out a cry and swipes at me.

"Woah!" I blurt out.

I run over and flick on the lights and I notice the scratch on Jak's side. As well as at the tiny amount of blood on my hands.

"Oh buddy, are you okay?!" I cry out as I run over to him.

My first thought is that he cut himself on the vase, but after further inspection of the wound it looks like it came from another one of the cats. The scratch wasn't that deep, so I poured some hydrogen peroxide and lightly taped a cotton ball along his side. I then shut off the light and fell asleep in the middle of the floor. That's when it happened.

"Mother." A deep snappy almost mechanical voice rang through the dark room. 

My eyes rip open and I'm paralyzed in fear. 

"Mmm- mother." It repeats again.

It's came from one the corners in the room.

"C- Come here, mother."

I finally gain the courage to look over at the noise. It was Coz.

"C- Coz baby, is that you?" 

"Yyyyes mother, I mmmmust share something with you." 

Everytime he stretches out a syllable it sounds like his throat wants him to meow.

"Oh my god, I must be going insane." I quietly panick.

"Nnnnno mother, you are ffffar from it." 

"No, no, no, this can't be happening, you're a cat."

"Don't trust the others."

That was the last thing he said before I never heard anything again. I ran and turned on the light again to see him and the other cats sleeping in their beds. I was about to call myself crazy before I noticed something that gave me chills. There was a tiny amount of blood on the ends of his paws.

Nothing crazy has happened since then, except for a few moments of Coz hissing at the other two cats, so I'll keep you guys updated. Also sorry if I ramble a lot, this just really has me shaken up.
