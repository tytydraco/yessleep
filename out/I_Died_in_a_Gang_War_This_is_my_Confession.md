A dead man walked into my precinct and confessed to the Riverside double homicide. He didn’t want a lawyer. He didn’t want a deal. The case had stumped me for a year, my only unsolved case in a perfect season. Close this one and I’d be 81 for 81. So yeah, I was happy as Hell to hear about a murder.



If you’ve ever been so close to a life-changing event you feel like you can grab it, skin it, and cook it for a seafood boil, you would understand my rush through the halls of the station. Although galloping in high heels through the station would not help me get respect, it was a necessary sacrifice. At any moment, our perp could change his mind.



“Go ahead and run, McKenna, before he changes his mind,” Grayson yelled at me. He hadn’t run anywhere since he became a detective two years ago.



Did no one else have to work? Everyone was out in the hall watching me run. Whatever, they could laugh now, my life would change when this was over.



“McKenna, I heard he’s changing his mind. Get in there!” Officer Boulard said, and I didn’t know whether to believe him or not, he was a real ball buster, despite my lack of balls, but I couldn’t risk it. Time to get my respect. Sprinting like a track star down the hall and bursting through the doors to get the confession from my perp.



“I’m Officer McKenna Broom,” the words came out before we even made eye contact, “and I hear you want to talk?”



The perp blinked twice behind the dreads caging his face. In a sort of ‘is this really happening’ blink, which I thought was because of me but was more because of the story he would tell me.



“Yes,” he said. “You’re Officer McKenna?”



“Yes, oh,” for the first time since they told me about the confession, I took in what I wore: a dress and heels. “Yes, I was heading to meet…” The word boyfriend got tied in my tongue and seemed unprofessional, and chances are I needed his respect for a little bit. “Another client, before I heard you wanted to confess on the Cobra case.”



“And can you confirm your name?”



“Yeah, I’m Damien Thomas.”



“Nice to meet you, Damien,” we shook hands. His was rough. A tattoo of a bleeding headless cobra rested below his knuckles. “Well, if you’re who you say you are, you go by a lot of names.”



Damien dove into his pockets. He shouldn’t have weapons. That was the deal. This would happen to me on the cusp of my big break. One mistake. One failed frisk and one dead McKenna. My hand moved to my hip where my gun should be. Gone. Date night would have been better than death. The thought of crying out occurred to me; pride didn’t let me. Damien pulled something out of his pocket. Time slowed. No, froze. Something banged on the cold metal table, and an echo followed.



His wallet. Damien produced his ID. I examined it and gave it back to him. He was who he said he was.



“I’m Damien Thomas, that’s who I am.” He said it like he had been fighting to say his name for a while. Odd, considering he was about to confess to something that would leave him in prison for life.



“Okay, Damien, I hear you want to confess.”



“Yeah,” he said, and we began.



Forces beyond me made sure the confession never got its day in court. You get to hear it though. The story is something worth dying for. These are his words.



\-----



The snake in the garden is more like me than Adam and Eve could ever be. Like me, the serpent saw beyond good and evil. That’s why I’m confessing. I felt what’s beyond good and evil and have to tell my story.



Last night, sitting in a Waffle House closed to the public, YR Cobra, my cousin, my enemy since I killed his brother, offered me the deal of a lifetime.



“I’ll give you 50,000 dollars and a record deal.” YR Cobra glared at me through his dreads without jealousy in his green eyes, only hate. A 6’3” black guy with green eyes, he was supposed to be a model. We were both supposed to be something different. Before we were in rival gangs, he was my cousin with the Nintendo Switch named Jordan.



“Get out my face with that,” I said, but I didn’t get up because I was begging for this one thing to be true. Hope had my heart fluttering.



“It’s not a lie. I’ve got the deal. I signed yesterday. The label likes my story, and one of my conditions was that I get a label under me and I’ll sign you to it.”



“W-w-w-hy me?” My voice trembled. I repeated the question again, steadying myself, demanding the answer this time. “Why me?”



“You’re family,” he said.



That answer felt impossible, like fixing a shattered diamond. That thing that broke it had more power than you ever could. All the mistakes I made could be mended because of memories we made as children. How could I be so blessed?



YR Cobra laughed, taunting me, spurting venom on my mending heart, and slowly, regrettably, I could only join the laughter because of course, he was lying. That’s fine. A little venom is good for the soul. And yes, as more laughter wretched out of my dry throat, echoing in the empty Waffle House, I remembered who I was and what I was, and the laughter flowed like Patrón from the bottle to the cup of ice.



Once YR Cobra was done, he told me the truth.



“It’s what it always is with us,” he said.



“Business,” I said.



“Business,” he agreed. “The label asked for you. They like that little song you did.” A quiet sneer flashed on his face as he said ‘little song.’ A sneer I took immense satisfaction in, as the whole point of the song was to get under his and his crew’s skin.



I sang out a few bars. “1, 2, 3, 4, how many of y’all we put in the morgue? 5, 6, 7, 8, check the score.”



“That’s the one,” he said, stale-faced, but I knew I was getting to him, and something in me didn’t want to stop.



“And they don’t care if it’s true.”



“No.” YR Cobra’s fist gripped the table, allowing a moment of rage. Oh, Jordan, so easy to read. “In fact, they like it that way. It’s a better story. No one will know you’re signed to me at first. You’re going to get a push by the label. We’ll beef publicly to raise publicity, and then they said they’ll get one of them old heads like Jay-Z or somebody from that era to say something like, ‘Stop the violence’ and give us both a cosign. We’ll make national news. Everybody loves that ‘stop the violence and family coming together’ shit.”



Yeah, that shit.



“Aight.”



“I’m not done yet,” YR Cobra, never able to control his face, smiled and showed off a perfect set of teeth. “8-0, you said that’s the score? Yeah, y’all killed more of us than we did you. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you gotta even it a little bit.” His smile stretched from ear to ear, breaking out of the cage of the dreads pouring down his face. “You gotta kill your boy Mook.”



I didn’t respond. I couldn’t respond. What could I say? I heard water spray on dishes in the kitchen and I imagined the scrub of those dirty dishes and stains that won’t leave; no matter how much you scrub, rub, scrape, wet, peel, beat, stab and shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot. But time passes and the stain doesn’t leave, so you have to move on.



“The record label said you had to do this?” I asked.



“They said something needs to happen. Every TikToker, YouTuber, and streamer will talk about it. Sorry, they don’t talk about turkey drives.”



“Why Mook?” I asked.



“Because I said so,” Cobra’s smile left. It hid at the edge of his business grimace.



“It’s just us in here,” I looked around to confirm it’s true. “And whatever manager you paid off. I could put you on a shirt right now. How do you know I’ll say yes?”



YR Cobra rose from his seat and headed toward the door, giving me his answer without bothering to look at me.



“Because it’s always business between us.”



YR was right. Just another Faustian bargain.



You know what a Faustian bargain is? It’s like a deal with the devil, but it’s named after this guy, Faust. I’d been making Faustian bargains for years, little ones. You do too, you just won’t admit it.



Buy clothes made from child labor : Faustian bargain.

Eat tortured animals: Faustian bargain.

Vote for the lesser of two evils: Faustian bargain.



You make a deal with evil to get what you want.



Once you see we’re all ignoring our rules, and yet, life still ain’t really that bad for you despite your sins, you start seeing what tilts the scales of justice; nothing.



And that’s what I worship. That’s what I held oh, so sacred.



Nothing.



Even in music.



You know anything about drill? No, not the tool, old man. The rap subgenre. It doesn’t bother with the consciousness or romance of mainstream hip hop and is almost exclusively diss tracks.



Real diss tracks and real beef, that makes that Kendrick and Drake thing look like pride week in New York City. People have died over it. I have killed over it.



Every song a drill rapper makes is to let everyone else in their city know how dangerous you are. Then you gotta back it up.



Until a couple of years ago, I didn’t care for drill, street cred, none of that. I was a good middle school church boy. So good, in fact, I’d stay after service to help clean up, and lo and behold, do I see my pastor, my role model, God’s shepherd, and most importantly a married man, banging my (very much married) mother.



To tell you the truth, after I got over the existential crisis, I was happy. I was a nerd taking all of that too seriously. If the holiest man I knew didn’t take this seriously, well, neither would I.



So, I jumped off the porch, as they say. Made some friends and started selling a little kush and then moved up to dime bags, and now, to be honest, my friends and I were close to touching the big leagues and, well, you know the story about Icarus getting too close to the sun?



Well, it was the ghettos of New York in the winter, so there was no sun. But we were using guns to increase our sum so we could get out of here and move somewhere nice to see the sun. But to keep increasing our sums, we had to get bigger and bigger guns, and the bigger the gun, the higher the chance you get sprayed even if you run. We whacked too many guys, and now someone’s got to die so we can be done.



I met up with Mook at his house. Mook’s house always felt sticky and smelled like weed. He lived with his mom who was never home, and he wasn’t going to clean, so dishes and smells roamed free.



Mook watched a pastor on YouTube on a flat screen. The pastor was a big black guy, southern accent. Mook was religious, just bad at it. Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish (I didn’t know he could do that), some weird cult, random spiritual nonsense, and he circled back to Christian again. Yes, he was aware all of these religions spoke against his lifestyle of sin, but like I said, he was bad at it. Some evils are hard to scrub away.



The lie leaped off my lips before he even offered me a hit of the doobie. A simple lie: we were going to hit another crew in a church.



“A church?” Mook asked between coughs.



“A church.”



“I don’t know about icing nobody in a church,” he put the blunt down on the plate and muted the TV.



“You’ve tried to do nastier in a church.”



“When?”



“That girl, Aaliyah.”



“Chill.”



“Tiffany.”



“C’mon.”



“And you tried with what’s her name?” I said.



“No, it would have worked with what’s her name, but I left to save you because you were talking wild on IG live. Your ass was on the phone, ‘They about to jump me. They about to jump me.’”



“And where they at now?”



“They gone, now,” we both said in unison, imitating some viral video we saw years ago. The laughter melted into sticky, remembrant silence. A lot of people had gone now.



Maybe that makes us want to be violent. The fact so many of us are gone and it feels like it doesn’t matter. I knew everyone on the other side we killed. We all grew up in the same neighborhood. That does something to you.



“D, I don’t know about this one. It’s a church, man. I’m Christian now.”



“You’ll probably be Muslim tomorrow. C’mon. Let’s go.”



Gangsters can’t show when their feelings get hurt. Gangsters can’t show pain when you expose their innermost struggles. So, Mook had to fake laugh and ask,



“Why’d you say that?”



That night we entered Saint Joseph Pignatelli Cathedral, run-down, broke-down, and dusty as a place no one had entered in seven years could be. Mook entered first, a loyal soldier leading a snake. Empty pews stretched across either side of us. Mother Mary waited for us on the stage.



Mook kept his eyes forward.



“I thought you said he was praying? I don’t see him.”



“He’s gone now,” I said.



Drawing my gun, I pointed it dead center at the back of Mook’s head. I pulled the trigger.



The explosion of red made me blink. When I opened my eyes, I was free of my gun and sat in a chair. In an all-white diner. My eyes struggled to adjust. The white was blinding.



Believe it or not, I felt a sense of relief. White lights, no weapons; heaven. I made it to heaven. I must have turned the gun on myself and not my best friend. I’m in heaven!



I patted myself. I wore a white gown. Yes, this had to be heaven. My eyes adjusted.



I was in a diner, in a swivel chair. An empty white plate rattled beside me as if someone just put it there.



“Do I order here, Jesus?” I said the words and hope slithered out of me. This place was white, but it wasn’t heaven.



A sign saying “menu” faced me. No words sat under it.



I didn’t move. Losing faith by the second that I made it to heaven, I waited. All-white clothes. A hospital? A psych ward? Was there an accident after, and I was in a hospital? Did they know I just killed a man? I stayed in the swivel chair looking forward at the white menu void of food options. No waitress came to me. Clientele came in. I caught them in the reflection of the counter bar. They dressed normal like they were on a casual stroll.



But it was strange. Various groups sitting at different booths and tables all spoke about the same subject: nothing.



“The space between atoms… what would that be?” a white woman in a silver suit said in one booth in the far corner with her friends.



“The space between the head and the neck. Loki’s wager, y’know?” The smallest black man you have ever seen said with other small black men of the same size.



“Not space, no no no. Stars and gas are out in space, so that’s certainly not it,” a man signed and spoke to the nodding person in his booth. I assumed this person was deaf or mute.



All of these conversations being separate yet related unsettled me. And I could feel the diner guests staring at me. I never saw them, but I could feel them. Randomly, I would spin around in my swivel chair to try to catch them.



I spun round, round, and round that silly swivel chair and I couldn’t catch them. But this was too weird. I got up, walking around the diner to confront someone. The room disappeared. Silent and empty.



“Hey!” I yelled. “Hey!”



No one there. No one answered. No door to escape. I would make them notice me though. I grabbed a chair to smash, to break something. The chair evaporated in my hand. I couldn’t even do that. Defeated, I sat back in the swivel chair.



The chattering returned. The chattering about nothing.



No one was where I heard them. I sat back in the chair and the chatter returned.



“If there is a God, a creator/master of the universe, nothing would be what he can’t do, correct?” A timid wheelchair-bound woman said to her own reflection in the window.



I stayed where I was and didn’t turn to look at them but begged, “Hellllppp me.”



If they heard me, they didn’t care. Nothing was more important than me.



“N-n-n-othing is imp-p-p-possible, the concept is only theoretical in nature and doesn’t exist,” a child said with big cartoonish glasses to a baby in a high chair on a stool beside it.



“No, thing. No, thing. It is a command. Who is thing?” said a man so fat he reminded me of Jabba the Hutt.



My life continued that way for who knows how long. All I cared about was nothing, and that’s what I was stuck with.



“When I woke up, I immediately turned myself in. There’s nothing beyond good and evil, Detective, and I don’t want that anymore.”



\-----



Damien stopped talking and looked at me. The room felt smaller. Like the walls had crept closer while he spoke. I shuddered the fear away. I smiled at him.



“That’s your confession?” I asked.



“That’s my confession.”



“You killed your friend in a church, then had a philosophical breakdown in a supernatural restaurant?”



“Yes.”



I should have laughed. Should have called for a psych eval. Should have done a lot of things. But something about the way he said “nothing”—like he was tasting poison every time the word left his mouth—made my skin crawl.



“Where’s the body?”



“Saint Joseph Pignatelli Cathedral. Behind the altar.”



I wrote it down. Standard procedure. But my hand shook a little.



“Damien, you know this sounds…”



“Crazy. Yeah.” He leaned back in his chair. “You gonna check the church?”



“Of course.”



It was in the church. But do you know what scared me? Whether I found the body or not, I was going to pin it on him. Just so I could go 81/81 in cases solved. I watched over the smelling, decomposed body of a young man and felt nothing for him. Just relieved I could be 81/81. His life didn’t matter to me.



When I die, I wonder if I’ll go to that [diner.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Finchink/)
