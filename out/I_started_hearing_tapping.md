I don’t know how long the tapping has been going on for now at this point. An hour? Maybe an hour and a half?   
  
All I know is that I started hearing the taps at 2:13 am, prior to the tapping I had just hung up with my boyfriend maybe 20 minutes before they started.  
We were still texting as we wanted to finalize some of the last details regarding my next visit to his place since we live an hour apart from each other and we wanted to spend the upcoming weekend together.  


It took me a moment to realize that I wasn’t sitting in the late night silence that I usually find enjoyable and somewhat comforting.

As I started to hear the tapping more frequently I stopped typing away on my phone and stopped answering my boyfriend for a moment to try and figure out what and where the sound was coming from.

At first I thought that it was coming from outside, maybe something in my yard. but after listening closer it took me about half a minute to figure out it was coming from the hallway. Then it took me 2 to figure out what the noise was.  
Taps, small single taps with a second of silence in between them. I wasn’t exactly sure what the taps were on or what was making the sound, so I tried to use the method of elimination.  
  
It wasn’t something on the floor, I have a wooden flooring in my hallway and the taps were too “clear” to sound like anything on the floorboards.  
  
I started messaging my boyfriend regarding the sound and told him that I was a bit freaked out because I couldn’t really tell what it was and I live alone.  
Was it the coats in the hallway knocking against the door of the closet? No it couldn’t be, it’s a sliding door and there’s no way a breeze could get in there.  
There’s no fan in the hallway nor are there any windows either. So it wouldn’t make sense to be anything like that.  
  
It was shortly after thinking about what things I have in the hallway that I realized what the sound could be. 

I have a closet with sliding doors, a shoe rack, some pictures hanging on the walls, a small table and a mirror hanging directly over that table.  
As I listened to the taps again and tried to focus on the sound with these things in mind. I just froze while laying in my bed.

Clear and light taps, the mirror, it sounds like it’s coming from the fucking mirror.  
  
The more I listened the more it became apparent to me that it sounded like it could be twothings tapping the mirror. It either sounded like a tiny piece of metal gently tapping against a mirror or a fingernail tapping against a mirror.  
I really hope that it’s the first guess but even then that wouldn’t make sense since I have nothing hanging above, besides or even near the mirror. It shouldn't be possible for anthing to touch the surface of the mirror.

I told my boyfriend that I think it’s coming from the hallway and sounds like something or someone is tapping the mirror. I like neither of those conclusions seeing as I live alone currently so I should be the only one in the house.  
  
He asked if it could be anything else and asked if I was completely sure that it came from the mirror. He asked me that question what now feels like hours ago and since then I have been holding my breath trying not to make a single sound.  
  
The tapping stopped for a moment but then began again. Except this time, it sounds like it’s moved and it's closer to my room than it was before. The tapping still sounds like it’s on glass of some sort.  
  
My hallway basically connects all the rooms in my house except for my laundry room which is entered through the kitchen and has a back door leading out to my backyard. The bathroom, the kitchen and living room, the small office, my bedroom and the entrance with the front door.  
  
My room is the biggest room in the house, quite a lot bigger than the office and I wanted the space to have a big nice bedroom since it’s only me living here. But the big room is also the closest to the front door.   
My front door has two windows and is just two or three steps from my bedroom door and it's nine or ten steps from the mirror.

I never heard anything or anyone walking in the hallway.
