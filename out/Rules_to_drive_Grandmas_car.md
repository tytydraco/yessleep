**TW: Killing/death**

*For Context: I am 22 years old and was born in the USA in New York. I have a pregnant wife at home. My Grandma lives in Ohio and every time I visit her, she always gives me those weird set of rules I have to follow.*

*I always thought those rules were just stupid and she made them up to scare me until now.*

My Grandma just lost her beloved husband recently and I drove to the state where she lives in, Ohio, to comfort her and spend some time with her.

As always she gave me another set of rules and I thought, that that was ridiculous. Those rules were about a car. I am talking about Grandma's car.

I am going to list all the rules here:

1. When you enter the car, you have to close the door immediately - otherwise, they will catch you (this rule is only for the drivers- and passengers sides door)


2. When the door is closed, lock it... They will try to open the door and once it is open, it is too late


3. Don't feel irritated about the smell in the trunk of the car


4. Whatever you do - DO NOT OPEN THE TRUNK
5. Don't drive at the time between 4 pm and 7 pm


6. When you accidentally drive between 4 pm and 7 pm, be prepared to fight for your life - whatever is trying to get to you will send you to an even worse afterlife. It is worse than hell - trust me


7. Don't try to run away when it is in your car - it is faster than you. You have to remove both your eyes - when it knows you're blind, it might spare you. But there is still a chance that it might not


8. When you drive at night, be careful - If you see a white car behind you, pull over and let it drive away. If you see a red car, drive as fast as you can - I do not care where you are, just drive fast.


9. If you hear something on the roof of the car, take the pistol out of the glove compartment and shoot up until you no longer hear something anymore.


10. Do not get irritated by the shadows at the corner of your eye, it's the ghosts of the ones that died in a car crash while Grandma was watching.


11. When you feel something touch your shoulder, then remove every fingernail on both of your hands, if you don't, you will regret not doing that


12. When you see a restaurant on the right side of the road, get something at the drive-through - even if you are not hungry or thirsty - it is a safety percussion


13. When you see a person on the left side of the road waving at you with a creepy smile - They know where you are and are following you


14. If you feel something touch your neck - swerve into the next tree that you can see - the car will automatically call 911 and send police, firetrucks, and medical help to you right away - even if you are not able to respond


15. If you see ***~~kids with their whole family playing on the road~~*** \- run down everyone with the car... They are not human, they are something worse than **the devil**


16. If you are caught by a spider-looking monster - pray to any god of your religion. Just pray - I can't help you

I laughed at this while grandma gave me a very serious look.

Suddenly, she fell on the ground and we had no cell phone or house phone in the area, so I ran to her car, opened the back door, and strapped her in so that in case of an accident she will not be harmed.

I quickly got into the car on the drivers side and followed rule 1 and closed it immediately, even though I thought that that rule was BS.

I heard scratching on that door and I locked it right away.

''The things that were written on that note in black on white were true'' I thought, but then I remembered, she always made up horror stories to scare me when I was little. ''That just had to be a coincidence ''I figured and drove off.

''Ew - what is this smell? does it come from the trunk?'' I wondered while I hit the break to stop the car and take a look.

I opened the trunk and there was a stuffed black plastic bag. I wondered what it is but I didn't want to betray grandma and take advantage of her trust and the situation so I let it be and closed it again.

I got in and locked the door again, just to be sure - This time, however, there was no scratching

I drove off again to find the nearest hospital, but it was 600 kilometers away from our current location. It will take around 12 hours to get to it when I drive 50 km/h - I hope Grandma can wait that long.

It is midnight and I can't but get distracted by the shadows I see in the corner of my eyes. They look scary. I screamed as some shadow hold up a knife. After it heard me screeching it put the knife down and let me be. ''Maybe those rules are true? I guess I'll follow them, just to be safe''

I am driving on a lonely road and out of nowhere I see, that there is a car behind me - it is white. I decided to pull over and let it drive away in fear of facing serious consequences for not following the rules.

''But wait - Why is it red now?'' I was horrified at the thought that an unknown Entity was in that car so I drove as fast as I can, but it keeps its speed up with mine. There is a restaurant on the right side of the road, but I am not able to stop there and I continue to drive. I hit 200 km/h and it finally got slower.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was scared of losing my life. ''What if it didn't slow down but drove faster than me? What would of happened with me and Grandma?'' while wondering the heater broke and it became cold instantly. I was thinking about the red car again.

''That was scary''

I drove about 350 meters and saw something on the side of the the road. They looked like trees at first but then I relised.

There is not only one, not 2 or 3, but 4 people on the left side of the road waving and smiling at me! I drove faster and I hit the 257 km/h mark. ''I hope they lost me!'' I was shivering down my spine. '' I wanna go home'' I cried while trying to breath normally again

I am at the entry of Kentucky and I figured, we are almost there. Only 400 km left until we arrive at the nearest hospital in Tennessee.

I continue to drive at 250 km/h and got pulled over by a police officer. The policeman knocked on my window and some creature jumped at him ripping out his eyes and leaving hollow eye sockets.

Before it could smash the window, I drove off at high speed into a family playing on the road killing them on impact.

I just entered the capital of Tennessee - Nashville - and therefore in the middle of the state. only 200 km and we arrive at the Hospital.

''The time went by so fast, it is 3:33 am already'' I had in mind '' Only 1-2 hours left until we arrive,! This nightmare is going to be over!''

***<< I was relieved >>***

Out of nowhere, I heard something on the roof of the car but it  didnt bother me so I just continued to drive thinking it was nothing.

I heard something whispering to me '' Rule nine '' which made me panic again. It said exactly the same words 13 times and then it hit me... I opened the Glove Compartment and took out the 9 mm and shot up. It took 8 shots until the sounds were gone. '' Why must it happen to me '' I cried out loud

I saw a Restaurant on the right side of the road and pulled into the drive-through and got a burger, fries, and a side coke.

I drove out and when I was circa one hundred meters away from the restaurant, I started to gain more speed to cut the time in half.

I saw the Hospital and started to slow down until I was in the parking lot.

***<< I rushed Grandma to get Grandma in the hospital >>***

***<< I waited 3 hours there until Grandma woke up >>***

She stood up, walked up to me, and whispered in a demonic voice: '' I told you not to open the trunk!'' That made me anxious and then she bit my neck and told me, that I now only have 5 minutes left to live.

I was scared - No I was terrified. I screamed for help and doctors rushed in. but they couldn’t help me and I now only have 1 minute left.

As I am writing this post, Grandma took out a match, lit it on fire, and threw it on the wooden floor of the Hospital while laughing like a demon.

" Finally... He's dead. His flesh - melted off... His bones, visible... 

***Drive slow and follow the rules, or face the perils!" - Grandma***
