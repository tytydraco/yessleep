This is the 4th time i have had this dream in my life. in the last 5 years, i have had this dream again and again, and nothing changes in the dream. The faces are same. The incidents are same. The *sound is same.* And i always wake up at the same moment every damn time. When i woke up this morning, i made sure to write this so that i don't forget it this time. I don't know what this means and whether its even possible to dream the same thing in such a long time span. If there is anything here that does not make sense or does not have a logical explanation, then just remember that this is a dream. There are things i couldn't remember. The names i used in this are obviously made up. I just tried to make sure you guys can experience a piece of the same dread that I felt in this dream. So i made sure to not add any extra details or any kind of stuff that did not happen in the dream. 

Five of us. Two cars. One road lost in the belly of the woods.

It was late — not quite midnight, but the forest already had that unsettling stillness, like it was holding its breath. The drive in had been uneventful, all trees and shadows. No signs, no sound but tires crunching gravel and the occasional hoot of something winged overhead. When we reached the clearing, the engines clicked and hissed into silence, and we stepped out.

There it was.

The staircase.

Tucked in the middle of nowhere — old, half-broken, overgrown with weeds and moss. It curved up into the darkness like it led to another world entirely. Bits of worn concrete peeked out beneath the dirt, and vines tangled around the rusted metal railings like nature was trying to pull it back underground.

A few flickering yellow streetlights lit the way, scattered along the path like someone had tried to modernize it decades ago and given up halfway. Most of them were dead, but the ones still alive hummed softly, casting broken halos of light that barely touched the cracked stairs.

Locals called it the Wailing Path. Said cries echoed from that forest late into the night. Said people had gone up there and come back… different. If they came back at all.

We laughed about it on the way in.

That laughter didn’t last long.

“Alright,” Kabir said, shouldering a flashlight, “three of us go in. You two hold the fort.”

He meant me and Zayn.

I didn’t argue.

“Why are we even doing this?” I muttered, watching the other three disappear into the tree line.

Zayn leaned back against the car, hands behind his head, totally relaxed. “Bro, this is how legends get made. We bust the myth, we become the story.”

“That’s exactly what people say before they die in horror movies.”

He just grinned, but I caught the way his eyes kept darting to the shadows. The wind picked up, and there it was — the sound.

A long, low wail, drifting through the air like smoke. It wasn’t constant. It rose and fell like breathing. Not human, but not quite wind either. Something in between.

“Tell me that doesn’t sound like a scream,” I whispered.

Zayn hesitated. “It’s wind. Has to be. Through trees or—like—hollow rocks or something.”

We stood there for a long time. The sky stretched darker overhead. The kind of darkness that didn’t feel empty — it felt full. Like the trees were watching.

Minutes bled into nearly an hour.

Then the flashlight beams appeared again — bobbing down the steps, voices rising.

Kabir, Ishaan, and Manu reappeared. Out of breath. Grinning like idiots.

“Dude!” Kabir called out. “You won’t believe this!”

They jogged over, shoes muddy, faces flushed.

“There’s this narrow-ass crack up there,” Ishaan said, panting, “between two huge stone walls. Like this natural crevice.”

“And the wind,” Manu cut in, “the wind goes through it and makes that crazy sound. Like a whistle, but massive. That’s the wailing.”

“Bro, it’s literally physics,” Kabir said, beaming. “All this time, people thought it was ghosts or something. It’s just air pressure and echo.”

Zayn’s jaw dropped. “So the entire myth... it’s just—fake?”

“We solved it,” Manu grinned. “We solved it.”

There was this weird rush in the air. Like we’d done something huge. Like we’d unlocked something sacred.

“Yo,” Ishaan said, “we need to celebrate.”

We drove to a clearing nearby — wide, flat, open. Someone had brought a portable speaker. Someone else had fairy lights and a bunch of random party junk in their trunk — old sparklers, soda cans, chips, some leftover Holi color powder.

It wasn’t planned, but it turned into a party anyway.

Laughter spilled through the air like champagne, bubbling and bright. People danced in a blur of color, arms thrown around each other, faces glowing in the haze of fairy lights strung overhead. The bass from the speakers thumped like a second heartbeat, syncing with the rhythm of a night that felt endless. I was in the middle of it all—smiling, swaying, alive.

Someone shoved a drink into my hand. I didn’t even look at what it was. I laughed, raising it in the air, toasting nothing and everything. My chest felt light, like I could float right off the ground.

Then I saw it.

Something small, metallic maybe, glinting underfoot just past the edge of the dancefloor—half-hidden in the grass. It was out of place, still, while everything else spun. I blinked. Curiosity tugged at me, subtle but sharp.

I stepped away from the crowd, knelt to pick it up.

And that’s when I heard it.

A sound—no, a wail—ripped across the night. A screeching, twisted roar that echoed from somewhere far off but felt terrifyingly close. It was inhuman. Ancient. Like metal screaming underwater. It didn’t belong here.



The music stuttered.

Then stopped.

Silence fell so suddenly it felt like the world skipped a beat.

I looked up, still crouched. The lights overhead fizzled and died, one by one, like a curtain being drawn across the sky.

The air changed—thicker. I stood slowly, the sound still echoing in my skull.

That’s when I saw them.

Bodies—still standing—but wrong. Their heads were gone. Clean. Instant. A massacre that had happened in the span of a blink. Blood shimmered on necks like twisted garlands, catching the faint glow of dying bulbs.

My breath hitched. My limbs refused to move.

I was the only one left breathing.

Just me, the object in my hand, and a silence that rang louder than the wail had. The warmth of the party evaporated, leaving only cold space and the awful feeling that something had watched—and decided I wasn’t done yet.

I ran.

Didn’t look back. Couldn’t. The clearing was behind me, but I knew what I’d see if I turned around.

I stumbled through trees, shoes slipping on wet grass, branches clawing at my arms like fingers trying to pull me back. My heartbeat felt like a hammer inside my skull. I didn’t stop until the car came into view, dark and quiet, like a forgotten artifact in the woods.

I yanked the door open, dove in, slammed it shut. Locked it.

Then I curled up in the backseat. Total darkness. No music. No light. Just silence.

And my breath—shallow, shuddering, helpless.

Outside, the forest waited.

Something moved. A rustle. A brush against the window.

I didn’t look.

I just squeezed my eyes shut and prayed morning would come. Then i woke up.
