“Balam, beri kel, kele ğoy.”

That’s what my grandma used to say. I loved her so much. But then… then she became strange.

When I was little, my grandma often visited our house. We’d drink tea together and play games. She told me stories, baked delicious pies, and always knew how to make me smile. Grandma was a seer. People from the aul came to her for fortunes. She had a special room for that, one with a heavy lock. “Never go in there,” she told me. I didn’t question her; she had a way of making even her warnings sound magical.

Our favorite game was hide-and-seek. Once, I hid near the door to her forbidden room, behind the curtain. I was waiting for her to find me when I heard a knock. Knock-knock. It came from the other side of the locked door.

“Kim bül?” I whispered.

Grandma appeared out of nowhere. Her voice was sharp, her hands trembling as she pulled me away from the door. She scolded me, but later she smiled and gave me tea with pie. That’s how she always was — stern one moment, kind the next.

But many days ago, grandma got sick. Mom said her favorite flowers were hydrangeas and that I should buy her a bouquet. I opened my piggy bank, gathered all my coins, and we went to the bazar. I wanted to buy five flowers, but Mom insisted on four. “Tört gül,” she said. Four flowers.

Two days ago, we went to grandma’s house. Relatives filled the living room, her old visitors from the aul were there too, whispering prayers. We all placed flowers by her photograph. That’s when I asked, “Why won’t we wake her up? I want to give her my flowers myself.”

Mom frowned. Her voice was quiet but firm: “Ol ölgen, balam. Ol mãŋgilik uyqıda.”

I didn’t understand. Dead? Sleeping forever? How could she be? Grandma still visits me at night.

One night, she woke me again. Her face peeked from under my bed, her body dark blue like the evening sky. “Balam,” she said, her voice trembling.
I told her I was tired and upset. I told her people were lying about her. I wanted her to wake up for real. She didn’t answer, only smiled.

Tonight, her voice woke me again:
“Balam, beri kel, kele ğoy.”

I couldn’t resist. I followed her into the dark living room. She stood by the forbidden door, taller than I remembered, her blue skin stretched tight over her bones. She opened the door with ease — the lock was gone — and crawled inside on all fours. It wasn’t frightening. Not at first. It was… strange.

“Kele ğoy, balam.”

Her hand reached for mine. It was cold, colder than ice, and her grip was unbreakable. She pulled me toward the doorway.

Inside, it was dark. The air smelled of earth, dust, and something metallic. I couldn’t see anything, but I felt it. I felt her pulling me deeper into the darkness.

And now, I can’t remember how I managed to escape that place.
