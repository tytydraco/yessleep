Like all good decisions, this one started at the bottom of a five-dollar bucket of Cedar Mountain Ice beer in a bar that was too shitty to stock toilet paper. 

“Dude, you’ll never do it. You simply lack the testicular fortitude. It’s not your fault, you were just born that way.”

I hate hanging out with Niff. His downsides are his personality, body odor, and spirit. But we shared a passion for getting shitfaced on my weekly five-dollar surplus, so I had to endure his presence if I felt like doing something that cost more than free.

“I’ll do it just because you said I couldn’t,” I slurred, standing up and tottering toward the bar. 

I knew she didn’t belong with me. Hell, I knew she didn’t belong in this *bar*. The girl was a goddess who did a bad job of hiding the rareness that nature distributed sparingly beneath an old gray hoodie that was only made radiant by what it failed to hide. 

“Hey,” I grunted.

“Hey,” she responded.

Ha. Fuck you, Niff, I still got it.

* 

“What?” Niff sputtered as I plopped down next to him with a shit-eating grin. 

“I *said* that she wants to see me tomorrow night,” I beamed.

“Fine, you win. I’ll pay back the five dollars and eighty-seven cents I owe you.”

“Bullshit, you owe me twenty-five bucks,” I shot back.

But my mind was elsewhere. Hydra was definitely the hottest girl I’d ever talked to, and the hottest who’d ever spoken to me (we’re not counting Kelsey Fergusen, because she didn’t even want to be paired with me in English class junior year).

“I wouldn’t do it,” Niff warned, snatching my half-full beer from the table and chugging it. “She’s definitely going to steal your kidney.”

“Hey,” I answered as she opened the door to her apartment the next night.

“Hey,” she replied with half a grin.

Wow. I don’t think I’d ever been this on fire before.

“I know you wanted to go out,” she began, “but what if you – I don’t know, maybe came inside for a bit?”

Oh, shit. Niff was right. Hydra was 100% going to harvest my kidney. 

I followed her in, of course.

I stared at her tank top and shorts. “You look… good.”

She bit her lip and grabbed my arm. “Why don’t we sit down?”

I obeyed without question. 

“You’re probably wondering about the camera,” she sighed.

“Huh?”

“Let’s just be honest: you’ve figured it out by now anyway.”

“Huh?”

She stared at me with a sorry gaze. “It will be easier if I just show you. Look, can you promise to wait to the end until you judge me?”

That’s how I found myself sitting outside of camera range as Hydra stared into its blinking red light, once again biting her lip.

Then I heard a familiar jingle; I know an OnlyFans chime when I hear it.

Mixed emotions flooded my brain. I was about to watch her show – but so where a thousand other perverts.

Wait – did she want me to be *part* of the show?

Nothing so awesome had *ever happened to me*.

Then she pulled out a switchblade and things went sideways. 

“Wait!” I gasped, covering my kidney. “What are you-”

But before I could move, she raked the blade across her smallest finger. I would have puked, but the fear locked every cell in my body. 

She moaned as blood spurted across her bedsheets. 

And the chimes poured in. Someone had just paid her big money, and dozens more were clamoring for the chance to hand her cash. 

Crying, Hydra pulled the knife back in a final grunt. 

And, with a tiny patter, her severed finger flopped to the ground.

I didn’t realize that I was falling until my sorry ass hit the floor. I’d never experienced that level of horror before, and I hope that I never will again. Without understanding why, I scrambled to Hyrda’s severed finger and scooped it up. 

A turd niblet found its way to freedom as I felt the warmth of the severed digit.

“Hydra,” I gasped, my mouth dry. But I was too afraid to form any more words. 

She staggered to her feet, holding up the bleeding stump to the camera, before shutting it off. My blood ran cold as she turned shakily toward me, her face now a bird-shit hue of alabaster. 

I offered the finger to her. I had no idea what else to do. 

She stared down at me, gasping. “It’s too late to save that finger,” she croaked.

I dropped the digit and it landed in my lap. I really didn’t think that through, but I was too freaked out to touch it again, so there it stayed. 

“Just watch,” she heaved, holding her bloody, four-fingered hand in front of me. 

I couldn’t have blinked if I tried. 

At first, there was nothing. 

Then a bone poked out of the wound as though it was a tooth erupting from bloody gums a million times faster than normal. That was followed with a coating of congealed blood, climbing the white bone like strawberry jam that opposed gravity. Tendons followed, writhing around the fleshy mess just as hungry worms would. Wrapping it all up were tendrils of skin, stretching wide like crescent roll dough before stitching itself together over the brand-new, pink flesh. 

That’s when the turd niblet was joined by all of its brothers.

“What are you?” I whispered, my voice thin as rice paper.

She smiled and cocked her head, now back to full strength.
