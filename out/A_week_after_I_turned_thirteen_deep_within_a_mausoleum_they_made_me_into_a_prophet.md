**September, 1989**

I couldn’t see the tall man’s eyes.

The mausoleum was dimly lit and windowless. Made it so the only visible pieces of the his face were his paper-thin lips and his thickset jaw, bathed from below in weak, golden candlelight.

*“Are you ready to accept your sacrament, Alex?”* he asked.

I shifted nervously on my feet, careful to avoid stepping on one of the many candles that were melting into the floor.

Earlier, as we drove to the cemetery, Uncle claimed my role in the process was simple: all I needed to do was trust my gut, and if my gut failed to usher me down the righteous path, he encouraged me to do as I’d been told.

That was a different, more external sort of intuition, he said.

*“Yes, Father Mattis.”* I replied, just as Uncle had instructed me to.

*“That’s a good boy.”*

Mattis smiled.

His cigarette-skin lips curled like vipers preparing to strike, unveiling a mouth overfilled with ghost-white teeth. Their hue perfectly matched the mausoleum walls, like he was sporting a pair of dentures chiseled from the same marble quarry.

I’d never met this man before, but I didn’t like the feeling of his smile crawling over me.

And I wished I could see his eyes.

Silently, he receded deeper into the mausoleum, submerging himself in a patch of darkness that the candles refused to touch. His movements were stiff. He did not turn his back to me.

I felt my heart snap and shiver.

None of this felt right.

There was a clinking sound, soft and metallic. Then, the groaning whine of a poorly oiled hinge followed by a square-shaped beam of harsh light emanating from the floor of the chamber. A large, smooth, hairless hand appeared from behind the beam. It gestured towards the light, which I realized was coming from an underground passageway as I approached.

Toes perched at the edge of the trapdoor, I peered down.

The cold air that drifted from the catacomb smelled of mothballs and long-dead wildflowers. Black and orange carrion beetles skittered between cracks in a set of concrete stairs. The Edison bulbs that lined the passageway buzzed with static.

My breathing grew shallow.

I wanted nothing more than to repay Uncle for his philanthropy. He didn’t *need* to take me in after Mom died, a fact he reiterated on a near-daily basis. He claimed that "prophethood" would finally make me self-sufficient.

This sacrament was becoming too much, though.

I turned to retreat, but when I looked over my shoulder, I couldn’t see the exit.

While I was distracted, something had quietly snuffed out every single candle.

*“Do not be afraid, child.”*

My head trembled forward.

His glossy, featureless hand remained, cast angelically in the pearly light, while the rest of him cut off sharply at the forearm, swallowed by darkness.

*“Go now. Hear the dying words of our last prophet. Allow his breath to weave a new vessel for the Silk-Touched God.”*

I scoured every inch of my body for some guiding intuition.

Should I run?

Should I hide?

Should I panic? Wail and thrash and bawl until I finally break this fever dream, waking up safe and sound at home with Mom?

Or should I just keep going?

When all I discovered was emptiness, I borrowed Uncle’s intuition one last time.

*“Yes, Father Mattis.”*

I took a shuddering step into the passageway, scraping my skull against the low-set ceiling. I hunched. Spine aching, nausea brushing against my tonsils, I wondered how it’d all come to this.

A few stairs later, I heard the man close the trapdoor behind me, locking it for good measure.

I descended.

My hands grew sticky with cobwebs as I pressed my palms against the stone walls for balance. A faint melody started to curl into my ears - the soothing murmurs of a piano. At the bottom, the passageway fanned out onto a small landing with an arched metal door. It was old. Flecks of chipped white paint laid like dandruff at its foot.

Without warning, the door creaked open.

I stepped inside.

The room looked familiar.

Oak paneling. Frizzy carpeting, light blue like a robin’s egg. An antique vinyl player in the corner, piano notes warbling from its brass horn as it the needle dragged across a warped record. The material rose and fell like turbulent waves; a memory of an ocean’s tide immortalized in black plastic.

My mother’s wake was nearly identical, save for one key difference.

There was a gaunt, middle-aged man tucked flat into a hospital bed at the back of the room, rather than a closed coffin.

*“Hello…?”* I whispered.

A hacking cough exploded from the *“prophet”* in response.

I crept forward, laboring under the assumption that he was sleeping or otherwise incapacitated.

He wasn’t.

As I rounded the bed, his pale, unblinking eyes followed me expectantly. They bulged from their cavernous sockets with delirious anticipation. A ring of honey-colored mucus was drying around his mouth. Bits of partially digested food adorned his unkempt beard. Black hair hung from his skull in messy tatters, stretches of deforested scalp peeking out here and there.

The horror of human decay hit me hard and fast.

I tried to step away, hands shivering, knees fluttering, but the prophet’s skeletal hand surged up from under the blanket. He grabbed me by the collar and jerked my head close enough that his damp breath fogged my glasses. It smelled musty, but not outright rotten.

He looked at me dead-on.

Then, the man spoke, phlegm rattling around his vocal cords.

*“She’s always been with me.”*

He began to shake his head from side to side.

*“Never alone. Never afraid. Never hollow.”*

The man paused. His eyes darted around the chamber.

*“Well, except for now. Guess she’s under the bed.”*

He chuckled. I tried to pull my neck away, but his grip was surprisingly firm. A sputtering, bombastic cough burst from his lips. Thick gray moisture splattered across my face, some of it into my pursed mouth. I tasted foreign spit.

Just as the room began to spin, he let go.

I stumbled back. His chuckling turned hellish; a malicious, fretful noise. The sound a hyena makes right before it sinks its canines into your throat.

My legs gave out.

Everything around me began to merge. Colors bled like severed arteries. Shapes became blurry, then distorted, then dissolved completely. The sound of the prophet’s cackling melded with the hum of the piano, giving birth to a shrill, incomprehensible song.

A kaleidoscopic orgy of the senses, transcendent and terrifying in equal measure.

Some time later, I found myself lying on the floor, staring up at the ceiling, eyes throbbing from dehydration. I think I went hours without closing them. They felt gritty and numb. It hurt to blink.

When I stood, it became clear the prophet was dead: gaze listless, chest still. As my vision steadied, I considered what to do next.

*Probably should just go home -* a voice inside me whispered.

That seemed right.

I paced over to the door, but as my hand reached for the knob, I had a disquieting thought.

Slowly, I bent down so I could see under the hospital bed,

but nothing was there.

When I climbed back up the passageway, the trapdoor was unlocked. I saw moonlight spilling in from the open double doors as I reentered the mausoleum. Father Mattis was nowhere to be seen. That said, the moonlight didn’t fully illuminate the chamber, and I didn’t rummage through the darkness searching for him.

Something tells me he was still there.

Motionless, watching from the blackness, still smiling,

waiting patiently for my inevitable return.

\- - - - -

Uncle had already departed by the time I got back.

Although the two-mile walk from *Pine Vale Memorial Grounds* was chilly, the mobile home felt significantly colder. I imagine the emptiness contributed. All of Uncle’s treasured belongings - his texts, his protective icons, his specimen jars - were gone. The only proof he ever lived there was a single shred of paper pinned to my weathered mattress with a sewing needle.

I threw on an extra sweatshirt, tore the needle from my bed, and uncrumpled the letter.

*“Alex -*

*You’re in Her hands now, so to speak. Trust your gut. If you require something, you need but ask. Prophethood means your word is a sort of law.*

*Do not follow me.”*

And with that, the man exited my life as strangely as he’d entered it.

I met Uncle for the first time at my mother’s wake.

He was a tall, beady-eyed man, with an unrepaired cleft lip that whistled as he talked. Despite living in a trailer park on the outskirts of town, he arrived at the proceedings dressed in a lavish, brick-colored three-piece suit.

As I stood over the casket, vacantly tracing swirls in the wood with my eyes, he walked over and placed a skeletal, ring-covered hand on my shoulder. After introducing himself, he reluctantly informed me that I’d be returning home with him. He did not express condolences.

I had my doubts about him, but the truth of his identity seemed irrelevant.

Mom was all I had.

There was no inheritance. The state paid for her funeral. Over the three months that I’d lived with Uncle, my belief in our shared blood waxed and waned, but the arrangement was infinitely better than an orphanage or the gutter.

The man offered me a way out, and I took it.

Without fanfare, I threw the letter in the trash and headed toward the fridge. My stomach growled. Sweat was pouring down my cheeks.

I’d never felt hungrier in my life.

There was nothing inside the fridge. Apparently, Uncle purged it before he left. Same with the cabinets, same with the freezer he kept out back, same with the small cigar box by the door that used to hold a few loose bills.

I paced the length of the mobile home. My empty stomach pleaded painfully. I doubled over, gripping my abdomen as it spasmed.

*If you require something, you need but ask -* a voice inside me whispered, repeating the contents of the letter.

Then, I felt it.

A pull from below my breastbone.

An inexplicable magnetism that could easily be mistaken for divine guidance.

I followed the pull.

I stumbled outside. The night was quiet. Frozen ground crunched under my feet as I approached the neighboring mobile home. I slammed my fist into the door, over and over until a shirtless Mr. Peterson swung it open.

He was a salacious, violent drunk on the best of days: not someone I’d wake up at a quarter past eleven looking for a free meal.

And yet, there I was.

*“I need…food.”*

His eyes burned with barely controlled fury. A flush swept down his face, dying it crimson.

“*Food…now.”* I whispered, breathless, hunger pangs twisting my bowels into seething knots.

Mr. Peterson’s hairy knuckles collapsed into a fist. Before he could slug me, I placed my hand on his forearm.

*“You need to feed me.”*

There was a shift.

His fist released.

The flush vanished.

His gaze turned bleary and vacant. I felt a sticky warmth gathering under my palm. I withdrew. A myriad of tiny red pinpoints in the shape of a hand had appeared on his skin, trickling fresh blood.

Mr. Peterson nodded and disappeared into his home.

After wiping the blood off, smearing it carelessly across my pant leg, I brought my hand to my face and examined it. There weren’t any punctures, but the flesh seemed to be subtly vibrating. The creases in my palm undulated like a radio frequency: a blessed transmission from the Silk-Touched God.

A minute later, he returned, arms cradling a random assortment of food - cold lasagna, half a loaf of white bread, an unopened bag of sunflower seeds - and without a single thought in my mind, I devoured it all while he watched.

When I was done, my hunger was better, but it wasn’t gone.

I placed my other hand over his shoulder.

*“More. Everything you have.”* Shards of seed-shells sprayed from my mouth as I spoke. Saliva dripped off my chin in hot, viscous globules.

Wordlessly, the zombified drunk complied.

\- - - - -

From that night on, my life wasn’t exactly simple, but I’d certainly been given a powerful tool to manage the complexity.

When Mr. Peterson ran out of money to support my hunger, I moved on to someone else in the trailer park. Eventually, I realized I could just ask people *for* money, rather than having them buy the food for me.

I selected my unwilling benefactors carefully.

My coercion required justification. Sex offenders, thieves, murderers (convicted or otherwise): they were all fair game. It didn’t feel right to exact tithes from the innocent, though I don’t think the God in my skin cared one way or the other. Virtue never seemed to be Her preeminent concern.

Though I was never quite sure *what* she wanted from me in the grand scheme of things.

On the whole, She left me to my own devices. I lived my life as I pleased.

Every so often, I would feel Her influence. The pulling. The magnetic sensation in my gut, driving me to an unknown destination.

When I was fourteen, she dragged me to a pediatrician’s office. The overworked medical assistant managing the front desk asked me if I had an appointment and where my parents were.

I placed my hand over hers and said:

*“I do, and they’re right behind me.”*

The woman’s eyes turned to lifeless balls of stained glass as she peered over my shoulders, staring at nothing.

*“Right. My mistake. There they are. Go take a seat.”*

I didn’t understand why I needed to be there, but I didn’t feel compelled to question it, either.

The Silk-Touched God exerted Her pressure on me once or twice a year. Letting her take the wheel for a few hours seemed like a small price to pay for what I was getting in return.

The doctor checked me, prescribed me some supplements - vitamins, iron, a probiotic -  and then we were done. As I left the clinic, the pull in my gut fizzled into nothingness.

I quietly thanked my God for her kindness and her wisdom and promptly moved on.

\- - - - -

Truthfully, I liked being a prophet.

I always thought it was a curious use of the word, though.

Typically, I imagined a prophet as an oracle of the divine. Someone who could predict the future based on an understanding of God's will, but that wasn’t *really* what I was doing. Everything I said would come true, yes, but only because I forced it so.

Calling *that* a prediction felt a bit rigged.

\- - - - -

There was really only one limitation to my gift.

For whatever reason, it would become inactive every evening, from about seven to nine PM.

Found that quirk out the hard way.

Six months after my sacrament, I was breaking into a grizzled, thickly built child abuser’s home, desperately low on funds. I required about twenty-thousand calories per day to abate my hunger. When I was young, before I better understood how to manage money, the requirement proved challenging to manage.

The back door was unlocked. He was watching TV on the couch as I snuck up behind him. I placed my hand on their neck and asked them to divest themselves of their life savings, please and thank you.

They flipped around and looked at me quizzically.

That look became predatory in a matter of seconds.

I’m thankful to report that I suffered no true harm, but without going into detail, it was touch-and-go for a moment.

The digital clock on their oven read *9:02* when my blessing finally returned.

Through ragged breaths, hand pushing into his cheek, I asked him to *get the fuck off of me.*

His expression grew vacant.

Blood accumulated under my palm.

Slowly, he released his hands from my throat and stood.

He did not live to see dawn.

\- - - - -

Over the years, I came to notice a pattern to Her influence.

If the cemetery needed something, I was the one who made it happen.

Sometimes, it was simply cash. My gut would drag me across town until I stumbled upon some wealthy, upper-crust-looking individual. I’d creep up to them, grab their hand, and say something along the lines of:

*“Donate ten grand to the Pine Vale Memorial Grounds.”*

Other times, the demand would be a little stranger:

*“Bury your daughter at Pine Vale Memorial Grounds - plot 732A. Make sure she's placed facedown in the casket and make sure it is made of sandalwood. Do not have her embalmed. Do not close her eyes.”*

I’d never know what I was going to say in advance. When the time came, the right words would just leak out.

All the while, the cemetery grew.

More and more mausoleums appeared across the landscape.

I was never concerned that my actions could be causing harm.

Until a month ago.

Late one night, I felt the pulling in my gut. Out of habit, I checked the clock - 10:34 PM. Confident that my coercive blessing should be active, I left for town on foot.

Ten minutes passed. I followed the magnetism.

Eventually, I laid eyes on my target on the opposite side of the street. I speculated about who he was as I waited for the light to turn red. Based on his oil-stained work clothes and his kind smile, he struck me as the blue-collar, family-man type.

Traffic stalled. The light turned. We approached each other on the crosswalk. As he passed, I grabbed his hand and whispered:

*“Go lie down on the railroad tracks. Do not get up.”*

I was stunned. Felt like my jaw hit the asphalt.

Guilt detonated like a grenade in my chest.

The man nodded and then kept walking. Dumbstruck, I simply watched him go.

*Such is Her will -* a voice inside me claimed.

I did not find the sentiment reassuring.

A flurry of honks ruptured my trance.

The light had turned again.

I looked away from the condemned stranger and jogged to the other side of the street. Ruthless vertigo forced me to collapse onto the curb.

I contemplated the weight of what I’d just done. It was crushing.

Suddenly, pain exploded in my gut.

Felt like a whirlwind of broken glass was blustering through my intestines.

I vomited a puddle of blood-tinged bile onto a nearby manhole, sickly yellow fluid with vibrant red streaks bubbling against the metal. The taste of acid hung heavy on my tongue.

*Such is Her will -* the voice inside me repeated.

*Such is Her will -* again.

*Such is Her will -* and again.

The agony continued.

It was a message.

A lesson about questioning divinity.

A reminder of who was really in control.

And only when I pushed the guilt from my mind did the pain begin to quiet.

\- - - - -

I kept my consciousness as clear as I could until the following night.

At seven PM, I let my emotions run wild: the remorse, the anger, the raw shame of realizing I'd been a well-paid pawn my entire goddamned life. It was catharsis, but it was also a test.

My gut stayed silent.

No pain.

From there, a plan crystalized.

A way for me to get the truth.

Apparently, even Gods need sleep.

\- - - - -

Last week, I went to my primary care office for an annual wellness check. Made sure to book the latest appointment I could. Fortunately, the practice stayed open fairly late.

When the doctor stepped into the exam room around six in the evening, he was quick to remind me that I turned forty-eight this year and was overdue for some important cancer screenings. For the third visit in a row, I immediately shot him down. Deferred each and every recommendation to keep my God hidden and happy.

The timing worked out nicely.

When I arrived at my car, it was a few minutes after seven.

Unmonitored, I intercepted my doctor in the parking lot as he was leaving.

I clasped his hand and said:

*“Actually, I changed my mind: I do want to be screened for colon cancer. We’re not going to do the colonoscopy, though. You’re going to order me the video camera that you swallow. The pill-shaped one.”*

In a soulless, monotone voice, he replied:

*“Okay. We’ll call you with the results.”*

I felt wet heat gathering over my palm. I shook my head.

*“Nope. You’re going to email me the video, and you’re not going to peek at it before you send it.”*

He nodded.

*“Oh. Right. That sounds like a better idea.”*

*- - - - -*

The email arrived yesterday.

I considered waiting until seven to open it, but I couldn't.

Body shaking, mind spinning, I sat down at my kitchen table with my laptop and clicked the attached link.

It started out normal. Showed me putting the pill-camera to my mouth.

Then lips, and teeth, and tongue.

Soon as the tiny camera reached my throat, though, I saw my God.

At first, it was just Her legs.

Long, ash-gray, hair-like strands, with spines like barbed wire that were tightly hooked into my flesh. Only a dozen or so threads spiraling around the perimeter of my esophagus to begin with, but there so much more to come.

The pain in my gut started to swell, but I kept watching.

As the camera descended, her legs thickened to the size of guitar strings, and at the base of my throat, I could barely see my own tissue under her writhing vegetation.

The camera pushed through a sphincter, and there she was.

In the corner of my stomach, fused inseparably to my mucosa.

She looked like a cannonball, black and rough-skinned, with a single, hazy, moon-colored eye, thousands of wriggling legs sprouting from somewhere behind it.

It did not appear to notice the pill-camera as it passed by, which rode a braid of her tangled filaments deep into my intestines before they eventually tapered off.

I'd estimate twenty-feet's worth, give or take.

The stomach pain became incomprehensible as she witnessed my betrayal, seeing herself on the computer screen through my eyes.

I thought I was going to die.

Surprisingly, I didn’t.

The agony abated rather quickly.

But as soon as it did, the coughing started.

A constant, hacking cough, just like the prophet before me. It won't stop. Gray mist bursts from my lips with every painful wheeze.

I think that’s how I became a *prophet* in the first place.

He infected me.

Now that I know too much, now that I'm spiritually compromised, maybe she's initiating the end of her life cycle. Disintegrating into a form that can be passed onto someone else.

It's conjecture, but theorizing is keeping my mind distracted from the other change.

I can hear Father Mattis now.

His voice is in the atmosphere, everywhere but nowhere, swirling around me like planets rotating around the sun, soothing and sweet.

He’s telling me I did well, that I’ve served my purpose, and that it’s time for me to come home so he can take care of me in my dying days.

His words make me feel a different sort of pull.

It's a pure, uncoerced intuition.

Honestly, I think I *want* to return to that mausoleum.

Being cared for sounds perfect.

I’m so tired, and I can’t cope with the fragmented truth that I’ve been allowed.

Maybe I’d feel differently if I knew everything.

But my Silk-Touched God doesn’t seem willing to provide anything close to the full truth.

An hour ago, I begged Her for the measliest scrap of honesty.

I didn’t ask whether that man was truly my uncle.

I didn’t ask what the point of all of this was.

Hell, I didn’t even ask her the most pressing question, the answer I deserve above everything else:

*Why me?*

No, I asked her something excruciatingly simple.

*Why did that poor man have to die like that, alone on the railroad tracks in the dead of night?*

Want to know what the voice inside me said?

*Such is Her will*.

I then asked,

*But what is Her will?*

*Why is it necessary?*

*Where does it end?*

And I haven’t heard

anything
