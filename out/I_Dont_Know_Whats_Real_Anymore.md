I don’t know how to say this, but something terrible started happening after I moved into my new apartment a few weeks ago. It was a cheap place, a little run down, but I needed a roof over my head fast. The walls are thin and the floorboards creak, but it was all mine. For the first few nights, everything was totally normal. Then the weird stuff started.

It started small. One night I was sitting on my couch late watching TV when the doorbell rang at 2:13 AM. I froze. I wasn’t expecting anyone. I looked through the peephole and saw nobody. When I opened the door, there was nobody there—except an old Polaroid photo on the doormat.

My heart stopped. The photo was of my living room, taken from outside. Even in the darkness, my digital clock’s red numbers on the wall were visible. The timestamp on the photo read 2:13 A.M. I definitely hadn’t taken that picture. The hallway was quiet and empty. At first, I thought it might be a prank. But I live alone now. So who else could have done it?

After that, small things kept happening. Lights would flicker for no reason. My phone started ringing late at night from unknown numbers that went dead when I answered. One night I woke up feeling like someone was breathing on my neck. I sat up in bed and flipped on the light—nobody was there. I told myself it was nothing. But every night since then, I’ve felt like I’m being watched.

A few nights later, things went further. I was charging my phone on the kitchen table and went to shower. When I came back, my phone was on the floor, face-down. I know I didn’t knock it over. I also noticed a long red mark on my arm, like fingernails had left a bruise. I shrugged it off as stress. But that night I set up my laptop camera on the desk, pointing at the bed. I needed answers.

The next morning, I watched the footage. I expected to see me sleeping. Instead, at exactly 2:14 A.M., it caught me sitting up in bed, eyes wide open, staring at something off-screen. I slid out of bed on my own, silent as a shadow, and stood in the corner of the room, facing the wall. Then I heard a whisper on the audio: “It’s time.” It sounded like me. I slammed the laptop shut. I didn’t remember getting out of bed at all.

My hands were shaking. I leaned close to the laptop’s camera and stared at my own dark pupil on the screen. For a split second, I thought I saw a second face behind mine in the reflection. I blinked, and it was gone. Maybe I was seeing things. In the morning, the bruise on my arm was gone too, as if it never happened. None of it made sense.

Since then, every morning I’ve woken up in strange places around the apartment. I’ve found myself on the kitchen floor, in a different shirt than I went to bed in, or once even standing in the hallway with the light off. Each time, I have no memory of moving. It’s like I blink and suddenly hours have passed. It feels like I’m sleepwalking—or something else is moving me.

I started writing everything down, trying to make sense of it. The paranoia got worse. One morning, I found words scrawled on my bedroom wall in red marker: “WAKE UP NOW.” I have no idea how they got there. The handwriting looked like mine. I was terrified.

I asked my friend to come stay with me one night just to have someone else there. Late that night, I saw him sit up suddenly, eyes wide, looking behind me. When I turned around, nothing was there. He left the next day, shaken.

Then the whispering started. Not from outside, but from within the walls themselves. I began hearing my name, faint but clear, echoing through the vents. I would shout back, “Who’s there?” but only silence answered. It would whisper other things too—sometimes just “You know.” I only caught those two words in every sentence.

One morning I found dried leaves and bits of gravel on my bed. There’s no garden around, no roof to climb, and I had been asleep. How could those get there?

Last night I finally snapped. I yelled, “Show yourself!” and tore through the apartment, flipping a chair and searching the rooms. In the bathroom mirror, I saw my own reflection pale and frantic.

And in the corner of the mirror’s frame, I swear I saw something moving. A dark shape pulsed as if it were breathing. I don’t know how to explain it, but it whispered directly into my ear: “You know.” That was all it said before disappearing. My heart stopped. I have no idea what it meant.

I haven’t been back to my apartment since then. I’m writing this from a friend’s couch, too scared to go home. I barely slept. At exactly 2:14 A.M. I woke up to see something written on her wall: “WAKE UP NOW.”

The same words I wrote, in the same red marker. My friend was asleep; I didn’t write it.

I just keep thinking: what did I bring with me? If it followed me here, what did I unleash? I don’t know what to do. I just know I am not alone.
