I used to deliver pizza for Tony's in Brainerd, Minnesota. Decent job for a college student - flexible hours, cash tips, and most customers were pretty normal. The worst part was driving out to the rural addresses, especially in winter, but the tips were usually worth the extra gas money.

This happened in late February, around 10:30 PM on a Tuesday. I was about to close up when we got a last-minute order - large pepperoni pizza to 4847 County Road 18. The address was way out in the sticks, probably a twenty-minute drive from town. I almost told my manager Jake I couldn't take it, but the customer had already paid online with a fifteen-dollar tip, which was more than I'd made in tips all night.

County Road 18 is one of those narrow back roads that cuts through nothing but pine trees and swampland. No streetlights, no houses for miles, just forest on both sides. I'd delivered out there maybe three times before, always to different addresses, always to people who seemed grateful that we'd drive that far.

I found 4847 without too much trouble - it was a small ranch house set back from the road, with a long gravel driveway and a single porch light. The weird thing was, all the other windows were dark. Usually when people order pizza, they're watching TV or have some lights on, but this place looked completely dead except for that one porch light.

I grabbed the pizza bag and walked up to the front door. There was no doorbell, so I knocked. And waited. After about thirty seconds, I knocked again, louder this time.

That's when I heard it - footsteps inside the house, but they sounded wrong somehow. Too heavy, and they seemed to be coming from directly above where I was standing, like someone was walking around on the roof. But that didn't make sense because it was a single-story house.

The footsteps stopped, and then I heard a voice from inside say, "Just leave it by the door."

The voice bothered me. It sounded muffled, like the person was talking through a blanket or from really far away. And it was deeper than I expected - the name on the order was Linda Chen, but this definitely sounded like a man.

"I need a signature for the credit card," I called back. That wasn't true - online orders don't need signatures - but something felt off and I wanted to see who I was dealing with.

Silence for maybe ten seconds. Then: "I'm not feeling well. Just leave it."

I should have left the pizza and gotten out of there. That's what my gut was telling me. But I was young and stupid and didn't want to get in trouble with Jake for not following protocol.

"I really need a signature," I said. "It'll just take a second."

More silence. Then I heard multiple sets of footsteps inside, all walking in different directions. Like there were suddenly four or five people in there, all moving around at once.

The porch light went out.

I was standing in complete darkness now, holding a pizza bag, listening to what sounded like a dozen people walking around inside a house that had seemed empty five minutes earlier. My phone's flashlight wasn't much help - just created this small circle of light that made everything beyond it look even darker.

I started backing toward my car, but then the front door opened.

I couldn't see who opened it because whoever it was stayed back in the shadows, but I could hear breathing. Heavy, labored breathing, like someone who'd just finished running a marathon.

"Come inside," the voice said. It was definitely the same voice from before, but now it sounded like it was coming from right next to my ear, even though I could tell the person was still standing in the doorway.

"I'm good," I said, still backing away. "I'll just leave the pizza here."

"Come inside," the voice repeated, and this time I heard it twice - once from the doorway, and once from behind me.

I turned around and saw a figure standing about ten feet away, between me and my car. Same height and build as whoever was in the doorway, wearing what looked like a dark coat or jacket. In the dim light from my phone, I couldn't make out any facial features.

My hands started shaking. I dropped the pizza bag and ran toward the tree line instead of my car. I figured I could circle around through the woods and get back to the road that way.

I made it maybe fifty yards into the trees before I tripped over something and went down hard. When I got back up and looked around with my phone light, I realized I'd tripped over another pizza bag. One of ours, with Tony's logo on it, but it looked old and weathered like it had been sitting out there for months.

That's when I started finding the others.

There were pizza bags everywhere in those woods. Dozens of them, all from Tony's, scattered between the trees like some kind of trail. Some looked recent, others were practically falling apart. I found car keys hanging from branches, cell phones half-buried in the dirt, a wallet with a driver's license from 2019.

I heard voices calling my name from back toward the house. Multiple voices, but they all sounded exactly the same. Like the same person talking to themselves.

I ran deeper into the woods, following what looked like a deer path. My phone was at twelve percent battery and I was trying to conserve it, but I needed the light to see where I was going. After what felt like hours but was probably only twenty minutes, I found another road - not County Road 18, but some other rural route I didn't recognize.

I followed it until I saw headlights and flagged down a pickup truck. The driver was this older guy who looked at me like I was crazy when I asked him to call the police. I was covered in dirt, bleeding from scrapes, and probably sounded insane trying to explain what happened.

The cops took a report, but when they went to check 4847 County Road 18, they said the house was abandoned. Had been for over two years, according to the county records. No power, no water, no recent activity. They found my pizza bag on the front porch, but that was it.

I asked them about the other pizza bags in the woods, but they said they didn't see anything like that. They suggested maybe I'd gotten turned around in the dark and imagined some of what I saw.

The next day, I went to Jake and told him I was quitting. I didn't tell him the real reason - just said I was focusing on school. But I asked him about deliveries to County Road 18, and he got this weird look on his face.

"We don't deliver out there anymore," he said. "Haven't for about three years. Too many drivers got lost or called in saying weird things happened. Corporate finally put that whole area on the no-delivery list."

I asked him why nobody told me that, and he just shrugged. "Thought you knew. That address shouldn't have come through our system."

I still live in Brainerd, and sometimes I drive past the turnoff for County Road 18. I've never gone back down that road, but I've talked to other people who've had jobs that required them to go out there - mail carriers, utility workers, delivery drivers for other companies.

Nobody wants to talk about it directly, but I get the impression I'm not the only one who's had a bad experience in that area. The mail carrier told me there are several addresses on County Road 18 that are marked as "undeliverable" in their system, even though the houses supposedly exist.

What bothers me most is the online order. Someone had to place it, had to pay for it with a real credit card. I asked Jake if he could look up the payment information, but he said corporate handles all the online transactions and they don't keep local records.

I still check Tony's delivery area on their website sometimes. County Road 18 is marked as outside their service zone now, just like Jake said. But every few months, I get curious and type in 4847 County Road 18 as a delivery address.

Sometimes it says the address is outside the delivery area. But sometimes - and this is what really gets to me - sometimes it accepts the address and lets me add items to the cart. Like the system can't decide if that place exists or not.

I've never placed an order, obviously. But I wonder who would show up to deliver it if I did.
