Last year, Robert Brigman moved into the house next door. And when he introduced himself to us, my ears rang loudly; tolled like alarm bells. Do you know that feeling? That fight or flight response? It was strange, given that I knew nothing about him.

Rob was a tall man, topping out at six-five, who wore a glum look on his thin lips. Lips half-covered by a shaggy, grey beard. And beneath that bleak expression, he wore loose-fitting clothes: a green leather jacket and flared, black trousers — like some time-displaced prog-rocker.

My new neighbour looked a little odd. No doubt about that. But I still wasn’t sure why he *unnerved* me.

“Have you noticed that he always limps?” asked my friend, Steve, a couple of months ago.

We were passing a football back and forth, half-watching my oddball neighbour mow the lawn, warring with the frost-tipped grass.

I shrugged, rolling the ball back across the slippery gravel. “I don’t know, man. I try to steer clear of him. Ten more months until I move to uni.”

“Isn’t Rob friends with your dad?” Steve asked. “You’ll probably end up seeing him sometimes.”

I sighed. “Don’t remind me.”

He chuckled. “You know, Danny, his right leg always seems to bulge a little more than the other…”

I groaned. “And, once again, we return to Steve’s podcast: Rob’s Knob.”

My friend tittered and let the football come to a stop. “I mean, look at him. He’s carrying a tonne of weight around in the right trouser leg. Has to be. Why else would he be limping?”

“For *any* other reason, Steve,” I replied.

“What about that night in February?” he asked — voice suddenly quieter, as if he were worried that Rob, over the roar of the lawnmower, might hear him.

I shook my head, brow creasing tightly. “We were drunk.”

Steve shrugged. “Sure, but it was real, whatever happened. It woke us *both*.”

“It was Rob’s cat,” I croaked unconvincingly.

Shuddering, I recalled the midnight awakening that followed my birthday outing with friends. Afterwards, with too much alcohol in his blood to drive home, Steve had crashed in my room.

“It wasn’t a cat,” my friend whispered. “You *know* what we saw.”

“I don’t,” I said meekly.

And I didn’t, but I knew that Steve was right. It was no cat. Cats don’t make whatever sound we heard; deep, bubbling, and ear-battering. A deafening noise more like that of a broth on the hob, rather than a living thing. The startling groan yanked Steve and me out of our beds. Sent us scuttling towards my window on knocking, liquor-fuelled legs. And the strongest bottle of booze in the world doesn’t cause joint hallucinations.

As Steve said, I knew what we’d both seen. Something poking over the wooden fence.

In Robert Brigman’s garden, there stood something tall; shaped like nothing earthly and wearing the night like a shawl. It, whatever *It* may have been, came from somewhere else. I know that, and I know it wasn’t a trick of the dim moonlight. Wasn’t Rob’s washing rotary, folded up into a thin pole. Wasn’t an open shed door.

It was alive.

And it spun. Spun, then shot at frightening speed towards the patio doors of Rob’s home. The shape did not rise and fall naturally, like a person, but disjointedly, like nothing I’d ever seen.

“I know I’m not crazy,” Steve said. “I see it in your eyes, Danny.”

Over recent weeks, I’ve been thinking and thinking about that conversation. It wasn’t until last Saturday, however, that I faced the truth. Faced something more than an indiscernible shadow over a garden fence.

I threw a house party whilst my parents were away, and Steve got himself into a little trouble. Not a habit of his, but that last can of Scrumpy Jack really did a number on his tongue. Made him say something regrettable to Terry Roston. And we don’t talk to Terry Roston. Don’t even invite him to parties, but he always shows up. Frightens everybody and delights in doing so.

Hours after the party ended, Terry came back, and he knocked Steve onto his back; flattened my dumbfounded friend the second he answered the door.

I was standing in the middle of the living room with a clear view of the lobby through the doorway. A clear view of that maliciously smiling classmate who, to me, had always looked like something more than a peer. More than a boy.

Terry was bulky. Too bulky for an eighteen-year-old. His form seemed to fill the hallway, and that was why I simply watched as the horror began — as Terry Roston, smiling at me, repeatedly slammed each of his fists into Steve’s face. And whilst he did, he kept his head twisted to the side; kept his wretched gaze locked onto mine. As I said, he delighted in frightening people.

Delighted in horrifying me with the torture of waiting. Waiting to meet the same fate.

Still, I surprised myself when Steve’s splutters started to quieten. One of my feet lurched forwards, and I prepared to challenge the haunting ghoul in the entryway. Terry took a turn at surprising me, however, by stopping short of taking my friend’s life. And it wasn’t that the monster had seen me take a tentative step forwards. It was that he’d heard what I’d heard.

That familiar bubbling sound of *bottomless* depth.

Terry snarled and twisted, clearly ready to turn his fists onto a new victim, but he changed upon seeing something beyond my field of view. Immediately shrank from a hefty, haunting man into a teenager. A boy. Something less. I finally saw the brute as he had always been.

Minuscule.

Then I didn’t see Terry at all, as his ragdoll body was yanked, with a series of snaps, out of sight — yanked towards the front door.

I screamed. Screamed because Terry’s body had disappeared in a split-second. Screamed because he *hadn’t* screamed. And just when I felt the scream die, as the last puff of air left my lungs, there came a second startling horror.

Terry’s body flew back across the entryway, falling alongside an unconscious Steven who lay on the floorboards. The horrid boy lay in a broken tangle of red-stained limbs, but still clung to life. Gasped for help.

With my breath held, I found myself unable to scream a second time, so I simply stood and watched. Watched as a shadow washed across the far wall of the hallway. A shadow I recognised from that night back in February. It was joined by floorboards creaking under some unimaginable, unthinkable weight; one that moved with a stilted, janky motion.

When the shadowy thing stepped past the edge of the lounge’s doorframe, finally revealing itself to me, my jaw hung. There came an unclothed leg; the bare calf and thigh of something longer than an ordinary limb. And at the end of this alien appendage was, rather than a foot, a human *hand* — one with fingers flat against the floor.

Into view came left and right legs of human proportions and design. Three naked limbs moving like some macabre tripod. Human legs swung through the air, propelled forwards by the bending third leg, which emerged from Rob’s groin in place of a member.

The nude, three-legged creature, walking through my parents’ hallway, was lit sufficiently by the glow of the streetlamp at the end of my driveway. It was Rob, of course. I had already known that. I had *always* known that my neighbour wasn’t right. Wasn’t like us — which is a fucking understatement, I know, as the man had a hand-footed leg instead of a penis.

“NO!” Terry screamed, hands raised defensively; mouth full of blood and regret.

But it was too late.

Robert Brigman, the man I’d both correctly *and* incorrectly judged, lowered himself onto his two human legs. Then he lifted the third. The inexplicable limb protruding from his groin. Lifted it over the brutalised body of Terry Roston, for merely a moment, before hammering it onto the monster’s face.

The hand covered Terry’s mouth and nose, and the wide-eyed boy squirmed uselessly under the full might of Rob’s third leg — under the monstrous fingers that shut Terry from the world. Shut his nostrils and lips so that he would slowly and painfully suffocate.

Minutes later, my neighbour lifted his third leg, uncovering the brute who had so nearly murdered my friend. Nearly come for me too. Rob scooped Terry’s body into his alien limb, as if it were an enormous talon; then the inhuman thing turned towards the door swaying restlessly in the wind.

I don’t know what the three-legged thing did with Terry Roston’s body. Don’t know whether the police will ever find out why that boy went ‘missing’. Before my neighbour limped home, he looked at me — the frozen teenager standing in his own piss puddle. Looked at me with glistening, grey pupils; dark eyes that, nevertheless, shone brighter than the black.

That’s about the only thing I know for sure about Robert [Brigman](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
