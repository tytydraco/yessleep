It was your run-of-the-mill, normal as Norma Jean, humdrum, no news is good news kind of Sunday evening. Save, of course, for the whole occupying-the-wrong-space-and-time-and-maybe-even-your-own-body thing. But I guess maybe that’s normal-abnormal for your first day in a new apartment. Where *did* you put the corkscrew? What *were* you thinking when you set the wifi password? Who *was* that sweet little Manx cat softly doting on your ankle while you drank cheap red cab and hammered picture hangers around the living room… and what the hell did he do with Iggy Flop?!!
   
Honestly, it was like I had stepped into a mirror world. Except instead of discovering that I now had, like, a sexy pixie cut or that everyone had fish heads and spoke only in consonants… instead, the hand-towel rack was to the right instead of my left. The bedroom blinds were wand not cord. Iggy Flop’s bowl was in a totally new yeah-but-you’ll-still-kick-it-over-at-6am-when-you’re-hungover-and-refuse-to-switch-on-the–kitchen-lights position in the kitchen. A thousand mundane differences that I had to sort through like jigsaw pieces that puzzled together my new ordinary. So I tried to focus on the ones that made me cheerful: The multi-hued wonder of a sunset-facing living room. The vaguely arousing intensity of a brand-new washing machine. The immensity of a square footage the same as the old square footage but now housing one person instead of two. 
   
Differences I tried to avoid: the empty side of the bed, the bathroom cup eternally lopsided with its single toothbrush, the Antarctic sparsity of fridge magnets after I removed all the triggering ones. Hannah used to say that if you focus on the negative you become a negative. Ironically, it was her words that armored me against the painful thought of her. 
   
*THUMP-THUMP-THUMP!*
   
Another hanger hung ready for its frame. I set the hammer down, reached into the box of pictures, choose a just-me that I had always liked, a photo from a trip to Panama where I stood smiling in front of the Volcán Barú as it loomed over the little town of… what was it, Baguette? Boquette? It was in that fuzzy memory that another difference about the new apartment occurred to me: how goddamn quiet everything was now. Not just Hannah-moved-out quiet. Single-at-thirty-one quiet. I set down the picture frame, stood scanning the room as if I could actually *see* the silence. Kind of quiet where I wondered if somewhere out there was a group of your bog-standard noisy neighbors – you know, the upstairs stomper, the downstairs DJ-in-practice, the hallway lung-hacker with endless phlegm – all stopping abruptly in silent-symmetry, a panic attack mounting in their chests: “DOES anyone hear me?!!” 
   
Which was of course the reason why I heard it in the first place – emphasis on *it* –
   
*Tap tap tap.*
   
Kind of sound you might not even notice in normal circumstances. In fact, it wasn’t until I realized Iggy Flop had ceased doting on my ankle that *I* even noticed it. Might have gone on forever hearing-but-not-hearing that sound, like all the road traffic the mind filters into some auditory closet. But alas –
   
*Tap tap tap.*
   
You’re reading this so I know you know the basic premise, which means I can just skip all the whereabout-wandering, the room-by-room elimination of locations until I arrived, at last, at the pantry. 
   
*Tap tap tap.*
   
Not like a mechanical sound, a compressor or whatnot. The million hidden machineries of living going on in our walls all around us. And not a dripping either. The tapping was more like… a fingernail on wood. You can make the same sound on your desk right now: *Tap tap tap.* Well that was what I heard, standing with my head cocked as I stared at the pantry door. You know the kind: eggshell-white with rectangular panels left to right, top to bottom. Hollow on the inside, a framework of literal cardboard – I know because I once punched a hole in one during an argument – so the sound was subtly voluminous…
   
*Tap tap tap.*
   
Now normally I’m not the skittish type. I can hold my own, keep my shit together. Hannah used to call me her warrior queen, and I like to think I made good on that. So when I say that my first reaction was unease, I hope that doesn’t come across as weak. Here I was facing layers of the unknown – an unfamiliar apartment, an unfamiliar room, even if I technically knew what a pantry was. I didn’t know *this* one. Were the shelves wood or vinyl-coated wire? Was there a light switch or no? Bucket of French-blue paint under the bottom shelf or was that the last place? And then you add to that the tapping. Is it any surprise that my first reaction was not to throw open the door, but to stand there fearstruck?
   
*Tap tap tap. Scritch.*
   
That last bit was something new. A scraping. Not loud, not a fingernail on wood. But soft, like…
   
*Scritch.*
   
…Notebook paper. I looked down to see a sheet slowly emerging from the bottom of the door, blue-lined and ragged-edged. Stood mouth agape watching the sheet as it was fed across the tile, as letters emerged, scrawled in thick Sharpie at the center of the page. Five words, three lines:
   
**“GET OUT**   
**OF MY**   
**PANTRY.”**   
   
Something clicked on in me. Call it warrior queen. Call it reckless and unthinking. I reached for the knob to the pantry door, twisted it, snatched it really – intent to force the unknown into my world. Except the door didn’t budge. No, the *knob* didn’t budge. As if it were stuck. As if something on the inside were holding it in place. 
   
“Hey!” I said, a cocktail of anger and confusion. Hot breath bouncing back in my own face. 
   
“HEY!” I said again, thumping the door hard with my fist. Nearly jumped at the sound of Iggy Flop skittering out of the room behind me. When, from my feet, came –
   
*Scritch.*
   
The paper was working itself backwards now, a tongue returning into the dark mouth at the bottom of the door. I acted quick, sent the heel of my bare foot down, stamping the page like a cigarette to hold it in place. Grit my teeth as I beared down, twisted the page, the sound –
   
*RRIIIIP!*
   
The paper tore apart, rent like flesh from a carcass until, with a jolt, my end of the page gave. The whatever-was-inside had got its piece, leaving me there in rising anxiety, pulse firing in my neck. I lifted my foot, saw beneath me the words, 
   
**“–––MY**   
**PANTRY.”**   
   
Oh no you don’t, you son of a… I left the door, practically shaking, but holding myself together, heading for the front room, for that picture box, the as-of-yet unhanged photo frame. My isolated face contrasted against an active volcano. And beside that frame, the claw hammer I had been using to hang it.
   
I returned to the pantry door, hammer in hand, literally tapping it in my palm, thinking. Thinking? No, psyching myself up. I knew *exactly* what I intended to do. I flipped the hammer in my hands, held it business-end down in two hands. Shoved the claw into the seam of the door frame, just above the knob, metal on wood. I pushed, gently at first, then harder. 
   
*Cruuunch…*
   
Wood splintered, chunks fell. Security deposit? They could bill me. I slotted the claw again, a little higher this time, pushed once more, without all the timid preamble. I shoved the handle. *CRACK!* More pieces. Again. Again. In a ragged edge up the side. As if my intent were to gnaw the door to pieces, one “bite” at a time. I needed a better idea. I had a better idea.
   
I swung the hammer, claw first, aiming for the right side of the pantry door. The whole thing shook in its frame at the impact. I braced the door with my foot and swung again – this time the claw’s teeth sunk deep. I wrenched the hammer, widening the hole. Bits of cardboard crumbled and fell. I hit the door again and again as it bucked against the ball of my foot with each blow. I sent every hostility I could muster into that damn door, a life’s worth of restrained violences that I could now set free – unleash rather – an eyeless brutality that comprehended the world in bruises and broken ribs.
   
I was a wrecking ball of a woman. That was until, rearing back to take another swing – this in a sluggish realization that seemed almost disconnected from the part of me that was trying to beat her way through this pantry door – I noticed something on the left side of this eggshell-white, six-paneled adversary of mine. A protrusion. Small. Cracked. As if, all the while I raged on this side of reality, on the other raged something else.
   
*SMASH!*
   
I shielded myself from flying debris as my hammer burst through to the other side of the door. Except… the debris didn’t come from there, it came from the area of the protrusion. Eyes covered, heartbeat thudding in my ears, I lowered my hand to find that, at equal size and placement to the hole I’d just made with the hammer, was a second hole – a second hammer, in fact! the claw of which jutted from the wood like two metallic teeth.
   
I let go of the hammer, left it hanging in the door as I backed off, nearly stumbling in my attempt to understand what I was seeing. With a scraping sound the two teeth drew back into the boundless dark of the pantry. I glanced behind me to see Iggy Flop cowering behind the picture box, then back into the kitchen at the two hammered-in holes staring back like eyes in a skull. I knew I should run, but something in me, some other boundless dark, made me stay. Made me watch. An abuser’s hard love turned in on herself. 
   
The knob turned. The hinges creaked. The door opened. The black boundary of the void grew and grew.
