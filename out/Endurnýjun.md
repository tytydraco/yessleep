My name is Maria Esperanza. I am a senior researcher at Indyne, a company that focuses on extending human aging, or possibly ending it. Today, an experiment to end aging, that was guaranteed success, failed horribly, and I fear I do not have much longer left to live.

There are always risks associated with these experiments. Subjects die, become disfigured, or lose cognitive capacity. Although these are outliers, they can be expected. Both from the research, and the subjects. 

This... this is an outlier to the outliers. We were testing one of the final variants of our Endurnýjun serum, a rejuvenating produced aimed at restoring youth, while permanently keeping you in your physical prime. Our test subject was an older man, approaching seventy years old. Not even a man half his age could do what he’s doing.

We began the test at 14:00, and I took my place supervising the experiment from a room above the theater. Everything had gone to procedure, down to the placement of the needle in the subject's arm, to the restraints used to hold them in place. I do not know what went wrong, or where we went wrong. After the injection, the subject immediately began thrashing about, frothing at the mouth, squirming and writhing with apparent pain.

After five minutes, the electrocardiogram the subject was attached to, showed a flatline. Disappointed, I directed the junior researchers to begin checking the body for a biopsy on the cause of death. And they dutifully complied.

The second Anthony came near the body, its arm shot up, breaking through the restraints and clamping around his throat. We could do nothing but watch as Anthony seemingly deflated, like a ball that lost its air. At the same time, the body of the subject swelled, a mass under its skin wriggling like worms.

Breaking the remain restraints, the cadaver rose from the table and slaughtered the remaining junior researchers. I called for security, but they arrived too late. It was like the entity could sense them through the door. The moment it opened, it lunged at them, ripping them apart and escaping deeper into the facility.

That was six hours ago, and only now has it begun to quiet down. I hope someone hears this. I locked myself in the viewing area overlooking the research theater. I even called in for outside help. But I feel-
