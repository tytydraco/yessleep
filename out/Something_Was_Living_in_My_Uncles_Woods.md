I’m not sure how to start this without sounding crazy, but I need to get it off my chest before I start convincing myself it never happened.

Two years ago, I spent the summer with my Uncle Gary on his property just outside Holbrook, Arizona. My mom thought it would “build character” to do manual labor. Gary owned about eighty acres of mixed desert and pine forest — the kind of place where you can walk for an hour and still see nothing but sagebrush and dry creek beds.

Gary was one of those guys who never locked his doors. “Ain’t nothing out here to steal,” he’d always say. He lived simple — generator, old truck, a few cows, and his dog, Buddy.

It was quiet there, almost too quiet. The first week I couldn’t sleep because of how still the nights were. No cars, no humming appliances, not even crickets sometimes. Just wind.

# The Whistle

It started with a whistle one night around 2 a.m. I was lying in the loft, half asleep, when I heard it — three notes, low to high, like someone trying to get a dog’s attention. I figured it was the wind through the trees. But then Buddy started whining. Not barking — whining.

Gary heard it too. I heard him stomp out onto the porch and shout, “Who’s there?” in that irritated voice old men have when they’re woken up. No answer.

He came back in and muttered something like, “Damn coyotes. They mimic, you know.” I didn’t know animals could whistle, but I didn’t ask.

# The Thing in the Field

A week later, I was out in the field near dusk, checking the fence line. About a hundred yards out, near the tree line, I saw someone — or *something* — standing still. At first I thought it was Gary. Same height, same build. But he was just… standing wrong. Too straight. Like a kid pretending to be a scarecrow.

I called out, “Hey!” and it jerked — not turned, *jerked*, like a puppet on strings — and bolted into the trees.

By the time Gary came out, it was gone. He looked pale when I told him what I saw. He said, “If you see that again, don’t call out. Just get back inside.”

He wouldn’t explain.

# The Recording

I started keeping my phone on me after that. One night, around 3 a.m., I heard that same whistle again, followed by what sounded like Buddy barking — except Buddy was asleep at the foot of my bed.

I grabbed my phone and hit record. The audio is still on my old phone. You can hear it clearly: a man’s voice, soft, calling, *“Buddy… come here, boy…”*

Gary burst into my room before I could move. He had his rifle and told me to stay quiet. We listened. The voice came again — this time closer to the porch. It didn’t sound right. The words were spaced wrong, like whoever said them was copying from memory.

He whispered, “Don’t answer it. Whatever you do, don’t go outside.”

The voice stopped around dawn.

# The Tracks

Next morning, Gary went out first. He came back looking like he hadn’t slept in days. He told me not to bother checking the porch, but I did anyway after he left to town.

The dirt outside had tracks — not boots, not paws. Bare feet. Huge ones. Each step was perfectly in line with the next, like it was walking on a balance beam. And there were too many. Some pointed toward the woods. Some toward the house. Some… just stopped.

Like whatever it was had lifted straight off the ground.

# The Last Night

A storm came through two days later. Gary said it’d blow over by morning, but that night, something slammed against the wall of my room. Hard. Buddy went nuts, barking and growling at the window.

Then — silence.

No wind. No thunder. Just the sound of something breathing on the other side of the glass. Slow, deep, *human*.

And then — my own voice.  
Right outside the window.  
It said, “Buddy, come here.”

Gary fired through the wall before I could move. The breathing stopped.

When the storm cleared the next morning, we packed up and left. Gary didn’t say a word on the drive to town. He just handed me a folded piece of paper with one line written on it:

“Don’t ever whistle back.”

I tried to go back last year, to visit him. But his cabin was gone — burned down to the foundation. Sheriff said it was lightning.

They never found Gary’s body.

Sometimes, late at night, I still play that recording. I tell myself it’s just wind. But right before it ends, I swear I can hear someone whisper my name.
