We’ve changed hotels. Twice.

Ellie clings to us at night. She won’t sleep unless one of us is touching her. Her fingers find my shirt, or her tiny foot presses against my side. She lies still, breathing softly, but her eyes don’t fully close. Lately, she watches the corners of the room with a focus too sharp for a child her age.

The baby monitor’s gone. Smashed and left behind. Whatever came through it didn’t stay there.

At the previous hotel, it found another way in. The television clicked on by itself—just static at first. Then the sound shaped itself. A voice emerged, slow and deliberate. The words were hushed, but they moved through the room like smoke. And as the voice grew clearer, the bed lamp began to pulse in rhythm, each flicker matching the cadence of the words.

“She belongs to the house.”

That was enough. We walked out within minutes.

In this new place, we stripped everything down—no electronics, no screens, nothing left that it can speak through. I stepped out just now to grab food and turned my phone on for a minute, hoping for a call back from someone who might know what this thing is. While I wait, I’m posting this—quickly. I’ll shut it off again before I drive back. I don’t want it finding us through this.

Still, something follows.

Ellie senses it before we do. She tracks the ceiling, the spaces above doorframes. Last night she reached toward the corner where the walls meet, eyes wide. “He’s watching,” she whispered. Her voice was calm, certain.

She’s not even a year old.

My wife hasn’t said a word since we arrived. She cradles Ellie like she’s the only real thing left, humming those soft lullabies—the same ones we once played on the monitor, before it turned against us. The melody used to soothe her. Now it feels like bait.

I’ve started to wonder how long this thing has known about Ellie. The way she stares into darkness like it’s speaking back. The way she hums the lullaby in perfect rhythm when no one else is singing. Then there’s the way she seems to know things she shouldn’t—how she points to the corner of a room as though she can hear the voice before it speaks. It's like something in her bloodline is calling it to her. My family has never talked about it, but there’s always been an odd, unspoken tension around the older relatives. Something always felt off about their stories. Perhaps they knew. Perhaps we all knew.

We’re running out of places to go. The silence between us is heavy. Every door we close feels like a temporary seal against something inevitable.

Ellie doesn’t cry. She doesn’t speak unless it’s to point, to gesture, to let us know where it is now. Whatever this force is, it doesn’t want us. It wants her. And not as prey.

She isn’t just being hunted.

She’s being claimed.

The house—whatever that word means to this thing—isn’t bound to one location. It isn’t just a structure. It’s following us, perhaps through her, perhaps for her. The voice didn’t say she was in the house.

It said she belongs to it.

And that’s what keeps me awake.

She’s not just a target.

She’s the opening.

And it’s getting closer.
