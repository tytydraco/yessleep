(author note: may become a series if i feel motivated)

So, this is just basic summary of what happened while I was in Oregon. I went to the lake, and on my way back, I saw some ungodly things that no human should ever see. There was blood everywhere, and tons of horrible sights. There were some guns, and a figure I will never unsee.

My name is Bryce, I am 18 years old. I live in Dallas, Texas and I went to Oregon for a vacation. I pulled into the AirBNB and I checked my email for where the key was. I eventually found it, it was very far from where the owner said it was. They said it was under the doormat, it was about 5 feet away, lodged in between two steel beams. I took the key, and I entered the building. It was very empty, and so quiet I could hear my heart beating and I'm pretty sure I could hear my abdominal fluids sloshing as I walked.

The only reason I moved out here was so that I had time to work on this book I was making, about a man who fell into a river and became a being with the power of Zeus.

Anyway, I walked into the building. Everything is normal, right? Nope. I enter and hear a creak noise from across the cabin. Not creaking, just a singular creak. I walk over to investigate. Nothing. I go to bed, since it's late at night and I only got 4 hours of sleep last night.

I wake up at 10:00 PM., everything is normal, until I hear a knock on my door. I get up to check it.

I open the door, and there's a man who appears to be about 20. He hands me pepper spray and a hunting knife. He sets a gun down next to those. "We've been hearing some creepy noises and seeing some creepy things in the woods, and from that lake."

"What do you mean 'creepy'?"

"Whispering, creaking, and footsteps. We SAW a tall figure, about 10-12 feet tall, staring at us. We turn the light on, gone."

"I- I have no words. I'll make sure to watch. Are you guys sure you don't wanna call the cops?"

"No no no, don't do that. The cops don't really care about this kind of stuff. ðŸ˜…"

"Ok. I won't then." 

I get suspicious of him very quickly, and he walks back to his house, which is a cabin maybe 100 feet away from mine. I hear another creak from the back of the cabin, then a whisper, then something running out of the house, but I don't see it. 

"What the hell?!"

The man sprints to my cabin.

"What happened?" The man says, breathing heavily from running back.

"I heard something creak, then something whispered, then I heard something run out and slam the door!"

"Oh, yeah. That's the creature that lives out here. He looks terrifying, but, don't worry. He's not aggressive. He likes to watch you while you sleep, since he's never seen humans before, so they're pretty amusing to him. Just don't fear him. He's nice. We're thinking of a name to give him."

"A-" I freeze for a second. "A creature?! What does that mean?!"

"He's tall, maybe 8 feet, and pitch black. He isn't aggressive though, so don't fear him." The man says calmly.

"O-ok. Noted." I say, my voice is shaky.

I walk back into the cabin to go sleep, and I see the creature staring at me. Not attacking, just staring. I stare back at it, then go to sleep.

Late at night, around 12:00 AM-1:00 AM, I hear a monstrous growl, and then the amplified screams for help from a man. Then I hear flesh ripping, the sound almost robotic. Next thing I know, it's silent. I walk outside to investigate. I see a 15 foot tall creature facing away from me, the man from earlier is hanging from sharp claws on the creature's hands, and I silently run back inside. It isn't until I reach the window that I see the creature completely incinerate the man with a gas fire, then eat the -now burned- body. The creature turns to face me, so I run out of sight and hide in a closet.

"Don't be shy. Come on out!" A deep, monstrous voice calls out, trying to lure more victims in. I stay silent in the closet.

"You know you want to play...." The monster gets louder this time, but its voice is directed in the opposite direction of me. I hear a more high pitched version of the voice. 
"Dad, stop killing people!" I look out the window, and it's the small monster that was watching me in my sleep. 

"Why would I? It's fun."

"Because they still live too, they have feelings and pain!"

The large monster grabs the small one and throws it into the lake.
"Shut up!"

The small one walks out, goes silent, then climbs underground, seemingly phasing through the dirt as it becomes a goop-like substance and lowers into the floor below.

"Now now, who wants to play?" The creature says again.

I sprint to my car as fast as I can. "Come on, damn it! Start!" The car starts, and I speed off, reaching over 250 miles per hour, only to be greeted by loud footsteps. I look back. The monster is sprinting faster than my car. I speed up. 300 miles per hour. It's still faster. It catches up and rolls my car.

"Shit!" I say, panicking. 

The car rolls and I fly around inside, only to be left uninjured when the creature picks up my Lamborghini and looks inside. The windows are tinted, so it doesn't seem anything and just looks away, setting the car down and walking off.

"God... How did it not see me?" I step out of my car and sprint into the forest silently. I head back to the city, only to be greeted by US Army soldiers guarding the border of the city.

"Nobody's allowed to leave the city, sir. There have been many entities spotted and they have been deemed hostile."

I look around. "You mean I'm trapped with that thing I just saw?!"

"You saw it?" The guard looks at me.

"Yes, it flipped my car and I watched it murder a man."

The guard pulls me through the gates. "We need to ask some questions, since we have limited knowledge on whatever these are."

I walk with the three guards that escort me, and they put me in a truck. Right when we start driving, I hear in the monster's voice "Where are you, Bryce?" The guards open fire, and everything goes silent. I hear heavy footsteps retreating form the guards.

"What the fuck?" I look out the back window of the truck, and see the monster running away.

The guard turns to look at me. "That's him? The creature?"

"Yes." I look back at him.

He looks away and everybody goes quiet, waiting to arrive at the military questioning facility.

"Ahhh, we're here!" I say as we pull in. The truck turns off, and the guard goes to open the doors.

I hear loud footsteps, then hundreds of muffled screams right as we get out of the truck. I look out the back window, and there it is, sprinting at me. I sprint off, full speed, without looking back. I feel the ground beneath me go away.

"Help!" I scream, before I hear an explosion, look up, and see a mushroom cloud miles off. The monster drops me and runs, I run off full speed, at 20Â° away from where the monster is. I eventually make it to a safe zone, and I'm safe now.

 Alright, my pen is running out of ink, so I'm g  nna ha  e to st  p wr i ing.
