I was only ten when Lola Esperanza died, but I'll never forget the way her eyes remained open, staring blankly at the ceiling of her small bedroom. The adults whispered about it, their voices hushed and fearful. "She's looking for someone," they said. "Someone to take with her."

I didn't understand then. I was too young, too innocent. But I knew things other kids didn't. I saw things they couldn't. Mom called it a gift, but most days, it felt like a curse.

It started the night after Lola's funeral. I woke up to find her standing at the foot of my bed, her eyes wide and unblinking. I wanted to scream, but no sound came out. She didn't move, didn't speak. She just... watched.

Every night after that, she appeared. Sometimes in my room, sometimes in the hallway, or the kitchen. Always watching. Always silent.

During the day, I started noticing things. The way the adults would fall silent when I entered a room. The guilty looks they'd exchange. The way they'd avoid talking about Lola Esperanza.

It was my "gift" that finally revealed the truth. One afternoon, I overheard a conversation - not with my ears, but with my mind. Snippets of thoughts, flashes of memories. Lola Esperanza, young and terrified. Japanese soldiers. The words "comfort woman" echoing in my head, though I didn't know what they meant.

More fragments came in the following days. Lola's pain, her shame. And then, years later, the mockery. Her own children, her relatives, laughing behind her back. Calling her names. Blaming her for something that wasn't her fault.

I realized then why Lola Esperanza's eyes remained open. She wasn't looking for someone to take with her. She was looking for justice. For understanding.

The hauntings intensified. Objects would move on their own. Doors would slam shut. The adults grew pale and jumpy. But not me. I wasn't afraid anymore.

One night, as Lola Esperanza stood by my bed, I finally spoke to her. "I know," I whispered. "I understand. And I'll make them understand too."

For the first time, she moved. A single tear rolled down her cheek. She nodded, just once, and then vanished.

The next morning, I walked into the kitchen where the adults were having coffee. "We need to talk about Lola Esperanza," I said. They tried to shush me, to send me away. But I stood my ground. "I know what happened to her during the war. I know how you treated her afterwards."

The color drained from their faces. They tried to deny it, but I recounted everything I'd seen in my visions. Their shame was palpable.

"She didn't want revenge," I told them. "She wanted understanding. She wanted you to acknowledge her pain, not mock it."

Tears flowed freely around the table. Confessions poured out. Regrets were voiced. Promises to honor Lola's memory were made.

That night, Lola Esperanza appeared one last time. But now, her eyes were closed, and a peaceful smile graced her lips. She faded away, and I knew she had found her rest.

The hauntings stopped after that, but my "gift" remained. And I made a promise to myself: to always listen to the unheard, to see the unseen. Because sometimes, the dead don't linger out of malice. Sometimes, they just need someone to finally hear their story.
