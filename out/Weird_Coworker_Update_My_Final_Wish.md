Ramy took advantage of his IT privileges and found out that [Omar's work email was deactivated](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/U46lFuzCSZ). He'd quit. If he was planning on returning at some point, he wasn't intending on reprising his role as one of our facility's project managers.

(If you haven't seen my pervious updates, click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/XdByfucl8N) to watch my life fall apart in real time.)

In his letter of resignation that was obtained using methods that are totally legal and ethically sound, Omar claimed that he'd accepted an offer for another position. The letter didn't give any clues as to where this imaginary position was, much to Ramy's disappointment. For now, it seems like Omar is running scared and is trying to cover his tracks as best as he can.

As for the hoofed jinn, I discovered that it had been wandering around in the woods behind my house, still in its catlike form. I started leaving a plate of raw chicken out for it each night before heading to work. I know that it's perfectly capable of hunting on its own, and chicken probably wouldn't be its ideal meal of choice, but I felt bad for the poor thing. After all it had been through, I figured the least I could do was give it a snack.

This went on over the course of a few days. Eventually, the hoofed jinn began to sit on my porch, waiting for me. It would eat, then curl up in a furry ball and sleep. After a while, I got bold enough to try to pet it. It glared at me the entire time, though it let me scratch its head.

All in all, I guess I have a new friend. Don't ask me why I feel the need to befriend everything that tries to kill me. I also would like to know why this is my primary method of forging friendships.

With those two updates out of the way, I have a question for those of you who are more experienced with relationships than I am: do you ever look at the person you're with and it just *hits* you how attractive they are?

Ramy was playing around with my router, brows furrowed together in concentration, eyes reflecting the blue light coming from my laptop monitor. It was something completely mundane, yet somehow, I found myself completely overwhelmed with how gorgeous he was. Is this normal?

*Local Man Discovers He Is A Simp.*

I grabbed the collar of his shirt, catching him off guard when I pulled him into a kiss. After a moment, his arm circled my waist as he playfully nipped at my lower lip. The fabric of his shirt shifted as he leaned into me, trying to back me up against the table. Wait, what was that? I broke the kiss, pushing the corner of his collar down to get a better look.

The necrosis was spreading. I quickly unbuttoned his shirt to see the extent of it. The decay had almost reached the hollow of his shoulder, the lower part of the injury crawling towards his waist like bolts of lightning.

"Jesus," I breathed. "It wasn't this bad two days ago."

With a sigh, Ramy slowly buttoned his shirt up again. "Yeah, you can thank Omar for that. Getting exorcized put my timeline way off."

"Timeline for what?"

"When this body let me take him over, it was on the condition that I make the jackasses that killed him suffer. Even though I've only got one left, the damn body's getting impatient."

Matthew's first set of entries had said that there was one other survivor besides him and his brother. God, that incident with the journals felt like a lifetime ago. What was the third soldier’s name again? Harris. That was it. 

“I wi-” I cut myself off before I could make a terrible mistake. I had almost started my sentence with ‘wish.’ 

Of course, this didn't escape the notice of a certain shithead jinn. With a mischievous smirk, he asked, “What were you saying, Lab Rat?”

“First of all, *fuck off.*” His chuckle briefly interrupted me. “Second of all, I would have appreciated it if you had told me this sooner.”

“I didn't say anything because I'm not concerned about it.” After a moment, he added, “I don't want you worrying about me, alright?” 

“Well, too bad. That's what you get for making me care about you.” I grabbed his collar again, this time pretending to threaten him, “And since you don't seem capable of worrying about yourself, someone has to.”

His cool fingers gently covered mine, keeping my hand where it was. I asked him if he knew where Harris was. He admitted that he didn't. Knowing that Ramy had a time limit made me curse the fact that we'd had to destroy the journals. One of them might've been able to give us a clue about where to find him.

I let the question that was making my chest feel tight with nervousness come out, “How long do you think you have to figure this out?” 

He seemed hesitant to answer, but eventually confessed, “At this rate, probably a month.”

A month? Harris could be in a different country, for all we knew. *A month.* 

I'd been saving my last wish for a long time; this was partially because I did not want to waste it, and also partly because I wasn’t sure what to use it for. Ramy had been trying to convince me to use it to replace the PT Cruiser, his reasons being that not only is the car a piece of shit, but it's also not tall person friendly. I'd always hesitated, thinking that a car was too frivolous. Shouldn't a final wish be for something important?

What could be more important than him? 

“I wish that-” 

Ramy's hand suddenly covered my mouth, stopping me before I could finish. 

“What are you doing?” He asked calmly. 

Clutching his wrist, I pulled his palm off of my mouth to respond, “Helping you?” 

“Don't waste your last wish on me.”

“It's not a waste.” I insisted. “I've got a nice home, two happy, healthy animals, and a good job. What more could I possibly need?”

He narrowed his eyes. “You *know* what my answer to that question is.”

“I'm going to call the shop right now and tell them to install one of those lifty thingies on it to make it a monster PT Cruiser.”

Ramy tried not to laugh in an effort to keep his earlier stern expression, “Don't do that.”

“Bring it up again, and I'll make us both regret it. That car *can* uglier, I assure you.” 

The hint of his familiar smile crept out, “You'd only be punishing yourself, man.”

We were getting sidetracked. I had to bring it back. “Okay, my shitty car is not the point. The point is that I've got a decent life. Yeah, it'd be nice to not have a near death experience once a week, but all in all, I'm doing better than I ever have been in… well, *ever.* For the first time since I can remember, I don't feel like some uncomfortable nuisance that everyone would rather just ignore.”

Ramy's eyes lowered, quietly considering my words 

I ended my speech by exposing myself as the sappiest simp to have ever simped, “The only other thing I have left to want is you.”

He rested his forehead against mine. For a long moment, he didn't say a word, just stayed close to me. 

When he finally spoke, his voice was uncharacteristically soft, “You know, you're the only person that's seen me for more than what I can offer. Wishes. Power. Magic. None of that appears to mean anything to you.”

I whispered, “Like I said. I want *you.*”

Ramy gave me a small smile, “Careful. If you keep saying that, I might end up believing it.”

“Believe it.” I stroked his cheek. “Let me do this for you. Please.”

Ramy’s eyes closed, leaning into my hand. It's not often that I get to see this side of him. I only get brief glimpses here and there. 

With a sigh, he eventually muttered, “It would be best to simply wish for the last soldier's whereabouts. If that's what you really want.”

Without any further hesitation, I made my wish. 

Ramy’s arms tightened around me, pressing me against his chest. He told me to close my eyes. Thinking he was going to kiss me again, I readily obliged, however, I quickly realized that wasn't the case when I suddenly felt wind on my face. A cow bellowed. 

Confused, my eyes snapped open. We were on a ranch. How the *hell* did we get to a ranch? 

A barn that looked as if it had seen better days loomed over us. Muscular black cows wandered around behind a wire fence nearby,  stretching beyond where I could see. The ground was dry and rocky, the landscape devoid of any trees. When I glanced up to see if I recognized any constellations, I was awestruck by the incredible sight above me. I had never seen so many stars in my life. I’d thought that I had a good view of it from my house, but at the ranch, the sky was so clear that I was able to make out the purple arm of the Milky Way swirling across the sky. 

Not to sound like Dorothy, but we *definitely* weren't in Ohio anymore. I'm not sure where we were exactly, but my guess is that the ranch was out west, possibly in Nevada or Colorado. 

I was about to question Ramy about our circumstances, but he was already on his way to the barn. He wasn't wasting time. I hurried after him. 

There was a faint orange light emanating from inside the barn. It was pretty safe to assume that the wish had taken us to Harris. Did he know Ramy was coming for him, like how Matthew did? What were we walking into?

Ramy glanced at me from over his shoulder, “Wait here.”

Not knowing what else to do, I nodded, planting my feet uneasily just outside the barn door.

I've taken the advice some of you have given me to start learning Arabic. It's *extremely* slow going, but… it's going. The reason why I bring this up is because I heard Ramy let out an, “*Uff!*” Which was *not* a good sign. 

I peeked through the doorway and instantly wished I hadn’t. What resembled a hunk of red meat was suspended in the middle of the barn by hooks protruding from the palms of its hands, connected to heavy-looking, golden chains fastened to the rafters. He didn't have skin anywhere except for his face. When Ramy got close, I was horrified when the flayed man wheezed, the sound wet and ragged. He was *still alive.* How could someone still be alive in that condition?

I turned away as Ramy reached for him. There was a gut-wrenching crack. The flayed man went silent. 

Somewhere to my left in the desert around me, I heard the rattle of chains. Heart rate quickening, I darted into the barn, trying to avoid looking at Harris’ hanging body as much as possible. 

Ramy whispered, “Whatever you do, don't run. The angel that did this is still here. If you try to run, it will chase you.”

Glancing around, I saw symbols written in chalk on the ground. Not Arabic. Not anything I’d ever seen before. Afterwards, I learned that it was Enochian. 

Quietly, I asked, “Did Harris… *summon* that thing?”

Ramy replied, “Yes. He must've thought it would protect him. Unfortunately for him, they have no tolerance for those they deem wicked. It appears that he didn't measure up to the angel’s high standards.”

Chains rattled from outside. Closer. 

I swallowed, choking out, “Can you get us out of here?”

Ramy sounded mildly surprised, “Huh. This is new.”

Eyes wide, I glanced over to see that he pulled his collar down. Thick, gray liquid had begun to ooze from the necrotic tissue on his chest. 

“What's happening?” I asked. 

Instead of answering, Ramy pushed me behind him. When he touched me, I was shocked to discover that for the first time since I'd known him, his skin was warm. He felt alive. 

But I couldn't dwell on it right then. The angel stood in the doorway. 

By all means, the angel should have been beautiful. Six pairs of feathered wings shone in a spectrum of pearlescent colors, giving off a light that was painful to look at for too long. His face was perfectly symmetrical to the point of making me feel uneasy, like I was looking at a machine’s idea of what a perfect human man would look like. His violet eyes glowed, not unlike the arm of the Milky Way outside. They scrutinized me like I was prey. He held a gold chain in its hands, the chain tipped with a nasty-looking hook, identical to the ones Harris hung from. 

The angel grinned in a way that made my blood chill, “Who do you serve, ifrit?”

His voice was the guttural, growling voice of a beast, like broken glass against my ears. 

Ramy responded, “I was an avenger. I've gotten what I came for.”

“That's not an answer.” The hook dropped threateningly to the ground, as if the angel was preparing to use it. “Where do your loyalties lie?”

When I took a small step back, the angel's head swiftly tilted, that cold grin now directed at me. “It's you, isn't it?”

*Fuck.*

Ramy's voice was harsh as he replied, “I serve no one. You know well that my purpose is to protect sacred places and things. What could be more sacred than one of God’s creations?”

The angel's eyes didn't flicker from me for even a second, “You treasure a man more than your maker? Or perhaps… this man bound you to him. Enslaved you using knowledge forbidden to him.”

The angel’s head tilted again, an almost feline motion, keeping his toothy smile as his eyes slitted, “Which is it?”

Ramy grabbed me just as the angel swung his chain towards me. I squeezed my eyes shut out of reflex, knowing that its trajectory would take the hook squarely between my eyes. 

Thankfully, it never came.

The ground was gone. What?! Oh, there it was: my back found it for me, and rather painfully, might I add. I had arrived somewhere that was familiar, but my fearful mind couldn't immediately process where. The chorus of ‘Hell and You’ by Amigo the Devil was playing on crackly speakers. The lighting was dim. The sour smell of old beer made my nostrils flare. Slowly, I sat up, finding that I was next to a pool table. 

It clicked into my brain that I was at the dive bar where Aanya had attacked me when we first met. 

Where was Ramy? What was bizarre was that I couldn’t feel his presence anymore. Oh God, was he *still there?* With that fucking angel?

Frantic, I jumped up, the bar's patrons turning to me in bewilderment. One of them was Aanya. She left her place to rush over to me, abandoning the guy that she was most likely intending to eat later that night, who then turned in his seat to give me dirty looks. 

“How did you get here?” She demanded, her voice low to deter eavesdroppers. 

Frantic, I whispered, “I don't know. We were at a barn, there was an angel, Ramy grabbed me, and then I fell- ”

At the word, ‘angel,’ the blood drained from Aanya's face. Without another word, she dragged me out the door. 

Once we were outside, she said, “If you've got an angel after you, we've got to move.”

“How do we stop it?”

“*We* don't. I imagine that's why Ramy dropped you here.”

We got to her car. A Bonneville that wasn't in much better shape than my Cruiser. 

She continued as she got the car started, “You better hope that your boyfriend is ready for the challenge. Angels are not to be fucked with.”

“Where are we going?” I asked, head pounding as blood rushed to my ears. 

She shrugged, “Your house? It's the safest place I can think of. And I'm sorry, but I don't want to drag Jade into this.”

Jade was the name of the girl we'd rescued from Aanya's terrible ex. Aanya had told me a few days prior that the girl had begged her not to bring her back to her parents. I'm not sure what that's about, but I didn't ask. Long story short, Aanya's a mother now. 

Anyways, I understood. Aanya was responsible for someone who completely relied on her. I uttered, “Thanks for doing this. For helping me.” 

“Of course. We're bros now, aren't we?” She said with a smirk. 

The ridiculous thing I said next was something that could've only been conjured by the mind of someone on the verge of snapping, “You got that right, Bromeo and Juliet!”

She took her eyes off the road for a brief moment to give me a withering look. “You know, I'm not afraid to kill us both. I will happily drive this car into the lake.”

Shakily, I laughed, feeling hysteria bubbling in my chest. From the tension present in the Bonneville afterwards, I could tell that Aanya was concerned about me. 

“Don't ever tell Ramy I said this, and I mean *ever* because the last thing that jinn needs is an ego boost.” She began, “But he's strong. If anyone can beat an angel, I'd bet it would be him.”

I thought back to the gray secretion coming from the decay on his chest. What if it was making him weaker? What if that meant that finishing off Harris wasn't enough to stop whatever was happening to him? *Stop.* Working myself into a panic wasn't going to help. I tried to assure myself that this was *Ramy.* A walking Nokia. He'd be fine. Right?

I just wished that I could sense him again. Just so that I could know for sure if he was still alive. Was that the angel's doing? It had to have been. 

During the drive, Aanya ended up breaking the silence by telling me about how she became a churel. I got her permission to retell it here, since I didn't want to violate her trust after such an intimate admission. 

“On my 18th birthday, my parents told me that they were taking me to a big family party.” She chuckled bitterly. “Turns out, it was my wedding."

Horrified, I gaped at her. 

She shrugged a shoulder, “That's how it worked, at the time. After the wedding, he hauled me off to America, saying that he wanted a better life, when really, he just wanted to remove me from everyone I knew. 

“No matter how many times he tried, he couldn't get me pregnant, and somehow, that was my fault. One night, he got especially angry when I didn't ‘choose’ to bear him a son, so he strangled me. The worst part was I didn't fight it. At that point, I'd wanted to die, so I just… let it happen.”

Jesus Christ. 

Aanya then flashed me a wry smile, “But then when I woke up, *he* became the one that was afraid. I followed him for years. *Years.* And thanks to you, I finally got to watch that fucker die.”

Her confessions left me speechless for a moment. I gazed out the windshield, eyes blurry from sympathetic tears as the weight of what she'd told me set in. 

Eventually, I recovered the ability to speak. Somewhat. “I'm… That's all so… I'm sorry that happened to you.”

“Do you know why I told you this?” She asked. 

I shook my head. 

Aanya uttered, “It took dying for me to become who I needed to be. There's a part of me that wishes that I would've done what I'd needed to do sooner, but there’s no point in wanting to change the past.”

She glanced at me. “You might only have now, Lab Rat. If it came right down to it, do you believe that you could abandon who you are now to do what needs to be done?”

I shook my head again, raising a hand helplessly, “I don't know. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say. My brain feels like a scrambled egg.”

“If you had to do something terrible in order to save yourself, could you?” She clarified. 

I thought back to Omar. How despite all that he'd done, I'd let him go. Every other time that I've had to help decide another person's fate, such as Matthew and Aanya's ex, I hadn't been the one to enact it. 

My answer probably wasn't satisfying, “I don't know. I want to say that I could, but… I know myself. I'm kind of a bleeding heart.”

As Aanya pulled into my driveway, she softly replied, “At the risk of sounding like a cornball, I hope that your heart can bleed for you, too. Not just others.”

The first thing I noticed when I got out of the Bonneville was that the hoofed jinn wasn't in its feline form anymore. It was back to the lanky, humanoid figure that it had been before. It sat on my stairs, skeletal hands clasped together. The scratches covering its skin looked like they were starting to heal over. 

Aanya initially got in between us, so I had to reassure her that the hoofed jinn wasn't an enemy. She didn't seem to fully believe me, but she did relent, her eyes guarded as she followed me to the front porch. 

The hoofed jinn raised its head as we approached, its voice childlike as it rasped, “I can't feel the ifrit anymore.”

I informed it that I couldn't either, then I asked if it knew anything about angels. It let out a low growl. 

“That explains it. Angels despise us.” The hoofed jinn gave a sharp-toothed smile. “They have no free will of their own, you see. They only know submission and expect the same of free-thinking beings.” 

As I unlocked the door, I invited them both inside. This was definitely long overdue, but I finally inquired the hoofed jinn about its name. It said that it didn't remember due to how long it had been since anyone had bothered to ask. It had taken the identity of the unfortunate animal tech that it had eaten to get access to our post-mortem room. The poor animal tech's name had been Bill. 

Yes… Bill. I stared at ‘Bill’ for a moment, wondering if the hoofed jinn was joking. It wasn't. Okay. Bill the Flesh-Eating Jinn, it is. It also said that it didn't give a fuck about pronouns, given that it could change its shape at will. It stated that ‘it’ was most suitable.

Naturally, neither of my animals was happy about our inhuman houseguests. I ended up securing them both in my bedroom after Aanya's eyes had begun to glaze with hunger. 

While I was in the bedroom, comforting both of my furry daughters, I sensed Ramy for a split second. He was in the house? 

I rushed out just as a tall, black shape glided out of my front door. As I got closer, I heard Aanya saying, “The *fuck* are we supposed to do with *this?*”

Ramy's body was laying on the ground, the dead man's eyes gazing sightlessly in front of him. The black shape I'd seen earlier must've been the real Ramy, going back outside after dropping off his human host. 

That body had clearly been through the ringer. A necklace of bruises implied that the angel had gotten his chain around Ramy's throat, at one point. Deep cuts exposing the bone beneath were visible on his arms and torso. 

Something else that caught my attention about the dead man was that the necrotic tissue was lighter, now, an odd gray-yellow; some parts of the injury had turned the bright, shiny pink of new skin. 

Astonished, I breathed, “It's healing.”

Blinding white light erupted from outside my window. I shielded my eyes, knowing that it meant that the angel had arrived. Bill's lip curled, releasing a reptilian-sounding hiss from deep within its chest. Slowly, the light became more bearable. Either it dimmed or my eyes simply adjusted. 

“You're going *out* there?” Aanya balked as Bill stomped towards the front door. 

The hoofed jinn didn't answer, leaving her and I to glance at each other in equal discombobulation. Afterwards, both of us rushed to the window to catch a glimpse of the madness going on outside. 

The angel was missing two of his wings, one from the middle set, the other from the lower. His eyes blazed like the hearts of twin flames. His face was no longer symmetrical, the right side of his mouth appeared to have been ripped off, showing his teeth in a permanent grimace. The golden chain he wielded was dripping with Ramy’s blood. 

What was interesting is that the injuries on Ramy's host matched the ones on his actual form. The same sickeningly bone-deep gashes were present in his black arms. Besides that, I was relieved to see that he still had all of his limbs, including the leathery wings, curved horns, and scorpion tail. 

It was hard for my eyes to process the vicious confrontation going on in my side yard. The angel moved in blurs of light and the occasional reflection of Ramy's eyes was the only way I could keep track of his equally swift movements. There was a glint of gold right before the chain narrowly missed Ramy's head. His horns hit the angel square in the chest, then they both disappeared again. 

The chain soared through the air again, the hook embedding itself in Ramy's thigh, forcing him to the ground. He used one hand to catch himself, another to try to wrench the golden hook out of his leg. With a vicious grin, the angel pulled. Even though Ramy didn't make a sound, I could tell by the way his eyes slitted that he was agonized. The angel roughly wrapped the chain around his arm, pulling the hook again, forcing Ramy to move closer to him, his skin tenting nauseatingly, looking dangerously close to getting ripped clean off. Ramy's fingers clawed at the ground, his whole body shuddering. 

I couldn't stand it. The angel's horrible smile was now directed at me, eyes burning at me through the window. He was baiting me. 

Aanya suddenly pulled me away from the window just as I saw the angel's head turn sharply. Bill had lunged at him, its teeth just barely missing the angel's good cheek. 

Aanya was saying something to me, but I wasn't listening. It sounded like I was underwater while her voice was stuck on the surface. My hands shook. My vision was blurred by frightened, desperate tears. 

Why did cheek sting? I blinked frantically, suddenly hyper aware of the fact that I was alive and crouched in my living room. My eyes met Aanya's. She'd slapped me. 

“Forgive me,” She snapped. “But you *need* to snap out of it.”

I nodded quickly, mind racing. Okay. What could I do? Could I do anything? I ignored the hoofed jinn’s furious howl from outside, the walls sounding far too thin compared to the battle being waged outside. 

The chain. It could harm Ramy. The only other time I'd ever seen him in any real pain was after he'd been exorcized. Was it possible that the chain hurt the angel as well?

I whispered to Aanya, “ I think that chain might be the only way we can hurt the angel. If someone is able to use it against him, or at the very least get it away from him, that might be enough to stop this.”

Still shaking, I added, “I'm pretty sure that I’m the one the angel wants. I think… I think he believes that I’m controlling Ramy. Like how Omar did.”

“Lab Rat, if you go out there, that thing will kill you.” Aanya said slowly. “Unless…”

It dawned on her then. If we were to try this, she would have to be the one to distract the angel. She sighed through clenched teeth, “*Fuck me!*”

I tried to be reassuring, “You just need to be out there long enough to get that hook out of Ramy and to tell him what I just told you.”

“And if you're wrong?” Aanya asked.

“Then… I don't know.” I muttered. “We have to try something, don't we?”

She shook her head, jaw tight, “You and that jinn owe me *big time* for this.” 

Aanya gave herself a small shake, stretching her neck from side to side as if to calm herself. Before she left, she made me promise that if anything happened to her, I'd take care of Jade. I agreed. 

When I returned to the window, I saw Ramy had freed himself from the angel's hook, but he was slower now. His tail missed the angel by inches. The angel looped his chain around Bill's neck, using his wings to yank the hoofed jinn into the sky, the chain acting as a noose. 

Ramy collided with the angel in midair. All three fell to the ground, the angel landing gracefully, his grip on the chain not faltering for even a moment. Meanwhile, Ramy struggled with his injured leg, relying heavily on his wings to keep moving. Bill loudly gasped for air, choking as it thudded to the ground. 

I slid the window open a crack and yelled to catch the angel's attention. Another flash of gold. I dropped to the ground, shocked to hear the window break, followed by the glass falling onto the back of my head.  
That meant the angel was completely unfazed by the house's protection. It dawned on me then that he could get in at any moment, if he wanted to. 

The hook had landed on the ground next to me. It started to retract back through the window, but then it stopped. My blood ran cold as I heard Aanya shriek from outside. 

*Please, let this work.*

I didn't think. I grabbed the hook and started to pull it with all of my strength. The links clattered to the ground, seemingly endless as more and more of it passed through the window. How long *was* this thing? 

The chain suddenly went taut as it was grabbed from the other end. *Shit shit SHIT!* I felt myself sliding across the floor, holding onto the chain for dear life. I couldn't let the angel get it back. I *couldn't.*

Two hands grabbed the chain next to mine. Aanya. Her breath was ragged. She sounded close to tears, but she held on, both of us putting all of our weight into this nightmarish game of tug-of-war. I knew that she was hurt, but I didn’t dare break my concentration in order to check on her. If we lost this chain, we were dead. 

As she and I pulled together, eventually, the chain went rigid once again. I grit my teeth, hearing Aanya groan softly next to me. I didn't know how much longer she could carry on like this. 

We both fell to the floor, the chain suddenly slack in our hands as it flew all the way through the window. What happened? 

There was another burst of light outside, followed by a loud crash. Aanya struggled to her feet, wincing, but running out the door with the chain gripped tightly in her fists. Her back was soaked with blood, the back of her shirt hanging in tatters. 

Back at the window, I saw that Ramy had impaled the angel with his tail, the tip driven into the ground to pin the angel in place. Aanya, teeth bared like she was feral, wrapped the chain around the angel's throat, set her backwards foot on the angel's shoulder, and started to pull. 

The angel's fist swung at her. She held her ground. Ramy’s tail embedded itself deeper into the angel's torso, causing the being’s ribs to crack like twigs. Bill limped over to Aanya, picking up another section of chain to help her. The angel began to fruitlessly claw at the chain in an attempt to get it off. His wings thrashed, knocking Bill back a bit, but the hoofed jinn hung on.

Aanya let out a cry. The angel smiled, blood trailing from the corner of his mouth. 

With a wet, ripping noise that I’ll never forget, the angel's head came off. The head’s eyes shifted to look at me once again before his gaze went glassy, that terrible fucking grin still on his face. 

Aanya dropped to her knees, the chain falling limply from her hands. With a snarl, Ramy's tail flicked, flinging the rest of the angel's body away. 

I abandoned the window to race to Aanya's side. When I reached for her, she lightly smacked my hand away, telling me that with how she felt, the smell of my blood could drive her crazy. 

Aanya did her best to smile, “I’ll live. Now, get away from me. We’ll celebrate later.”

Bill was already recovering, stating that it’d keep an eye on her. It sat down crossed legged with her, a bony hand delicately tracing the deep injury in her back. 

Ramy followed me back into the house. Once we were alone, he embraced me, those leathery wings forming a soothing cocoon around me. Neither of us said anything. We just held each other. 

We did it. We really did it. All four of us had bested an angel. 

After what felt like an eternity, yet somehow still not long enough for my liking, his arms loosened their comforting hold, telling me that he should return to his host. 

“You know… your true form isn't so bad, either.” I admitted. 

He winked, “You *really* shouldn't have told me that, Lab Rat.”

I let out an embarrassing yelp as those wings pushed me back into him. Good lord. I can't have a moment of peace around this shithead. 

Afterwards, I learned that angels can't truly die, though I have been assured that it'll be awhile before the one we’d beheaded recovers enough to retaliate. I think that's why the piece of shit was smiling as his head was torn off. But that's future Ramy and Lab Rat’s problem. 

So, I just want to say that I appreciate how many of you have accompanied me on this descent into madness. You've all given me so much advice, some of which has quite literally saved my life. I never believed in the kindness of strangers until I started this series. You've seriously all helped me grow into the Lab Rat I am today and I truly can't thank you all enough for that. 

Originally, I started posting as a cry for help. I'd had no one to turn to as my life was flipped upside down by the strange guy in IT. But now I’m not alone anymore. I have people in my corner, now. This is bittersweet, but… I think this might be my last post. Yeah. It's time.
