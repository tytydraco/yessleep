The first thing I did was take a long shower. You don’t wanna know what I had to wash off. I quietly poked around the house in the early morning and ended up making breakfast. Both Casimir and Jacek were still snoozing away peacefully when I poked my head into each of their rooms to wake them. 

“You look like shit,” Cas remarked, padding past me. “Didn’t you get any sleep?”

I responded by shoving a plate in his face. “Eat.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

“Any signs of the dog yet?” I asked Jacek when he joined us at the table. 

He shook his head, raising his brows as he let out a long yawn and blinked several times. A rather charming effect. “None. I think he got what I was telling him, though. He’s clever. And down in hell, the hounds’ job is to chase down runaway souls, so I think it’s in his blood. Besides, he can go places we cannot. Through walls, closed doors and the like.”

“So you have every confidence in him.”

“Mhm. No telling how long it’ll take, though. I’ve never used him for anything like this before.” He grabbed the cup of coffee that I slid over to him and lifted it to soft, sleep-swollen lips.

I turned my head, trying to chase away a familiar feeling of warmth in my belly, only to find that my little brother was watching me with great interest.

“So that’s how it is,” he said quietly, smiling like a lion.

“Shut up,” I hissed.

“Are we still talking about Licorice?” Jacek inquired, and Cas waved him off. 

“I need to figure out how he found out about my soul. Tom Hayes, I mean,” I hastened to explain. “Any ideas?”

Jacek shrugged. “Sounds like someone sold you out. Either that, or someone actively sought to hurt you. Must be someone you know really well, though.” Idly stirring his coffee, he added, “Present company excluded.”

“I’d never suspect you,” I assured him. “Either of you.”

“Glad you know it,” Cas remarked. “I’m the best thing that ever happened to you.”

“Sure you are.”

“I don’t even wanna imagine how much you suffered in the three years you had to wait for me to be born.”

“Must have been torture.”

Cas nodded approvingly. “I’m just glad you were too young to remember.”

“Thank *God* for you. Now that that's settled, what do you think?"

His face darkened. "I think we should call up the rest of the family. We'll arrange for a little stay. A reunion, if you will, and then we'll see if we can't find out more."

"We should." My head dropped to my chest. "How wonderful."

"Yeah, please save that for when I'm gone. I hate crowds," Jacek chimed in. "But don't worry, I can just go home and then come back when the pup's returned."

"I hope freak dog is alright," Cas remarked. "You're really certain he can do this?"

"I would not have told him to if I didn't." Jacek drank down his last swallow. "So here's what I figured. I'm gonna go home now, and then I'll reach out when I know more."

My stomach did this weird little jolt. "Okay, well. Sure. Good."

"Yeah."

"You gonna go right away, or…?"

Jacek nodded. "I think so."

"Hmm." 

"Need a ride or something?" Cas offered.

I perked up. "I can't believe I never asked you! How *did* you get here? And where do you live these days?"

"You'll show up at my door, won't you? You wanna stalk me," Jacek said, the look in his eyes amused and not wholly unaffectionate. "For real, though, I'm gonna keep this a secret. I need to keep my aura of mystery."

"You do?"

"Yeah. Otherwise you won't be interested in stalking me anymore." He reached out to pass me his empty mug, poking me in the side as he did. "Anyways, I'll get going, and no, I don't travel by plane. I got my own ways. I'll call you up when I'm back."

"Is Licorice gonna find you, though?"

"Well, either he'll come to me or back here, so… it works either way." 

"I guess." I could tell something was off. He seemed pretty antsy to get going. There was hardly anything I could do to stop him, though. "Well, thank you. For everything. If there's anything I can do to make it up to you, let me know, okay?"

"Sure. But I'm fine on my own." He paused. "That came out wrong," he added. "Stay in touch?"

"Of course."

"Good. Keep me posted if anything comes up." He rose to his feet, stretching and groaning in satisfaction as his back cracked. I grabbed his coat for him and he slipped into it while I was still holding it up. When he turned to me, our eyes very briefly met and I felt a sharp pang of sadness. I heard Cas take a drawn-out, slurping sip behind us. Choosing to ignore him, I gave Jacek a very brief hug.

He sighed into my shoulder. "It was nice seeing you again, Fiona."

"You too," I muttered. 

"Jacek, can I talk to you outside real quick?" my brother chimed in.

"Uh… yeah, okay. Like, alone?"

"Mhm. Lemme just see you out." 

The two men left me behind in the living room, looking after them in bewilderment. They stayed outside for quite a while, so I ended up lying down to get some rest. 

The next morning, I went over to the red meadow at first light. I found the Leshy waiting for me, once again in his true form, standing tall among the trees. A creature native to the woods, through and through. Something was different, though. He looked smaller and slimmer, like he wasn't taking up as much room as he rightfully ought to.

*"Heiress,"* he greeted me, and I found that his growling voice didn't send shivers down my spine anymore. Maybe it hadn't for a while. I only noticed it then, though.

"So how long have you been sick for?" I asked, cutting right to the chase.

*"It's that obvious, huh?"*

"Pretty much. But I think I'd know even if you were able to hide it better."

*"I've been hiding it for quite a while, actually."* He lowered himself to all fours so we could see eye to eye. *"I guess now I'll see if it was worth sharing."*

"I'll fix it," I said. 

*"Cocky,"* he replied firmly. 

"Just confident. I'm pretty optimistic these days."

*"Have you lost your respect for the woods, heiress?"*

"Never."

*"Good. Either way, you're about to see something that should open your eyes."*

I followed the wood-demon across frozen ground, casually greeting Gus as we passed him. The branches of the trees around us hung down gloomily, heavy with snow and ice, offering a somewhat mournful sight as we passed them. I turned my head away as we walked by the black gristmill. The twin lakes having frozen over, I could only assume that the Vodyanoy was laid sleeping at the bottom. The Lord of the lake was hibernating. I gave the Leshy a sidelong glance, wondering if he ever allowed himself to rest. If that was even something he needed to do at all.

We found ourselves on a small clearing surrounded by fir trees. To our right, a little mound rose from the snow-covered forest floor, opening into something of a cave. I recognized the location—I'd seen it before, despite never paying it much attention. As far as I knew (and cared) that cave was empty, too. The Leshy stopped me before I could approach it.

*"Watch out. He might be inside."*

"He?" 

*"Do you know what Biesy are?"*

I shook my head no and the Leshy stepped a little closer to me, pressing his snout to my ear. *"They're spirits of nature, much like me, except that they don't seek to guard, but to destroy."*

"You can be kind of destructive, too, though," I argued.

*"I merely protect what's mine from encroachment. The Biesy will take possession of a creature's mind, and then they'll drive it insane. They make it hurt others and kill itself. They're demons, not from hell, but of the earth itself. They choose their habitats at random, they don't care who else lives here or who owns this place. There is no talking to them, they cannot see reason and they have no such thing as mercy. And one such beast has made a nest for itself right here, in the middle of our woods. It's been killing rabbits and deer, but it's been moving on to… well, other entities. It tried to possess me when it first came here, but I managed to fend it off. It's gotten worse since, I've grown weaker… It's been afflicting the woods for a few weeks now, like a disease."*

My heart sank at his words. "It's killing the woods. And you're dying with them."

The Leshy let out a low growl that, despite our somewhat friendly conversation, caused me to recoil. He didn't do anything, though. When he spoke again, he sounded reluctant, almost defiant. *"I wouldn't put it exactly like that, but yes."*

"So how do we beat this thing?"

The Leshy uttered a rumbling sigh. *"I do not know. Clearly. Otherwise I would have done it by now. I… I've no clue. I can kill the animals it possesses, but the Bies itself has no actual physical form. Sometimes it shows itself as a ghost-like apparition. It looks rather human then. But it has no body to speak of. I can't hurt it."*

"That's… troubling."

*"You don't say."* He pawed the ground with branch-like claws. *"Anyways, I think here's its hideout. I've seen the figure hovering around here a bunch of times."*

"And has it ever spoken to you?"

*"No. It's nearly mindless. It's made only of hate. Sometimes, it doesn't even fully take over your mind. Only plants ideas in there. Like an incentive."* He lowered his head. *"So that's all I've learned so far. Any bright ideas yet? I know you and I owe each other nothing, not anymore. I hate to beg for assistance, and I can imagine you'd be rather hesitant to help… considering our history."*

"You're right about that."

The Leshy placed his snout on my shoulder. The unexpected gesture made me flinch, though more out of surprise than fear. I could tell it was meant to convey something other than intimidation. Despite myself, I smiled at the beast. "You're a part of me, Sir. The woods are. Of course I'll help. How long do you think you'll last?"

*"I'm not dead yet,"* he hissed. *"And I merely feel a little… under the weather. That's all."*

"Okay. That's… good enough. Try to avoid the Bies. Don't fight it. I'll come up with something, but until then, just try to lay low. I know it sucks, but if you die, we're fucked either way."

*"Understood. Note how I'm taking orders from you? This is the first and last time I'll do that."*

"Sure," I grinned. "I'll get back to you soon. Don't stray too far from the house. I'll alert my workers."

He moved his antlered head in what was supposed to resemble a nod. We returned home side by side, him stopping at the treeline. I waved to him as I jogged across the red meadow, white skirts flying. Inside, I checked my phone. No missed calls. I'd kinda been hoping.

"What did you talk about with Jacek?" I asked my brother, who was sitting on the couch with his laptop. 

Cas let out an irritated grunt. "The guy's an idiot, isn't he? Just up and left."

"I'm glad he showed up in the first place. I didn't think he would. He helped us out immensely. Besides, that's not really an answer, is it?"

"Trust me, you don't wanna know." He sighed, closing his laptop. "Where were you?"

I took a seat on the armrest beside him. "Discussing something with the wood-demon. We have a new problem on our hands."

Casimir took the new information in with furious brows, listening intently as I told him about what I'd found out.

"Well, shit," he muttered. "What are you gonna do?"

"I'll try and take away its happy place," I explained. "I'll go and smoke it out tonight. Are you with me?"

"Always. But why are we going at night? Just for dramatic effect?"

"It's probably safer, no?"

"If you say so. What do we need?"

We started tearing apart the house for sage and incense to burn and fortunately came across Mom's old stack. The same came in a little bundle and the incense in sticks, so we tied it all together and sprinkled it with oil, creating a nice little firecracker. We then spent some quality brother-sister-time together watching television and preparing mentally for the night ahead of us. Thankfully, it gets dark soon these winter days. I found myself staring at my phone as I was leaning against Cas' chest. Eventually, I excited myself and simply grabbed it, going up to my room to call Jacek. He'd said we'd stay in touch because of my soul, after all. I was just doing that. Nothing more. This meant nothing.

I dialed the number he'd left me and jumped when he picked up after the first ringtone.

"Fiona?" he asked. 

"Yeah."

"Why didn't you text me earlier? Or you could have called…" He sounded relieved.

"Why didn't *you* call?" I returned.

Jacek sighed for a very long time. "You didn't give me your number," he explained when he was done. 

"Oh." I felt the heat creep into my cheeks. "Oops." 

"Yeah."

Awkward silence.

"So, did you get back safely?" I inquired.

"I'm alright. Licorice isn't back yet, though. I don't suppose he's with you?"

"Nope. But I don't wanna pressure him. It's okay if he needs some time." *What the hell was I talking about?*

"Okay. So, miss me yet?" he asked lightly.

"Like a phantom limb." It didn't come out as jokingly as I'd planned, though. 

Again, awkward silence. 

"Ah, any plans for tonight? Something new come up with Tom Hayes?" Jacek quickly pressed out.

"Yes! Yes, actually. Cas and I are gonna go burn sage and incense at a demon's layer. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that?"

"Nooo… What's a demon?" the black miller asked innocently. I let out a snort of laughter. I could hear him chuckle on the other end, as well. "Oh Fiona, sure I do. Sage and incense are a good start. But just what kinda demon are you dealing with?"

"They're called Biesy. Nature spirits."

"Those are a little different than the ones I hang with. I don't think I've ever met one. If it's not from Hell or has to answer to our command, I don't have anything to do with it." He sighed. "Sorry."

"Oh, it's cool. We'll be fine."

"Obviously. So you're off now, huh?"

"Yeah, we're leaving soon. Just wanted to, uh, check in with you first."

"Thanks. Now that I got your number… I can text you," he sang. "I'm much more comfortable texting than talking in person."

"Why's that?"

"I dunno. Anyways, good luck. Don't get killed. Would be a shame."

He ended the call and I smiled, gnawing on the tip of my thumb. For some reason, that had been just the pick-me-up I'd needed. When I went back downstairs, Cas was in his jacket and boots already, looking ready to leave. 

"Do you have your cross on?" he asked me. 

I nodded, holding up the necklace for him to see. "Do you?"

He nodded and thus, armed with salt, a handgun, our special bundle and a box of matches, we headed out into the darkness. Knowing my way through the woods well enough, I was able to navigate us even without the aid of a flashlight. The powdery snow was rather conducive to our sneaking, but the patches where the ground had frozen over gave us a lot more trouble. Not only did we jump at every snap of a twig, every crunch of leaves beneath us, we also had to pay attention not to slip on ice-covered puddles along the way. 

The night had turned deadly quiet. What little rustling we heard in the distance did nothing to ease our minds. Once we'd reached the clearing, we stopped to listen. The silence was nearly overbearing, but at least we seemed to be alone. Either the Bies was sleeping or away. We crept up to the cave entrance with bated breath. Wordlessly, Cas got out a match and struck it as I held out the bundle of sage and incense. The second the small flame had sprung over onto the flammable material, smoke began to rise and I dropped it into the dark maw at our feet. The familiar scent filled our heads as we stayed to watch for a moment.

"This reminds me of Mom," Cas told me in a very, very low voice. 

I was about to respond when we heard shuffling behind us, followed by the sound of wood splintering beneath a considerable weight. Cas and I exchanged a look that told the both of us that the other had a feeling we were fucked even before we turned around. Knowing we'd still have to look, we turned our heads at the exact same time to find ourselves facing a rather familiar creature. 

The two-headed bear was towering above us like an executioner, ready to lop our heads off our shoulders. It had become no less revolting than the last time I'd seen it. This was no sprite or faerie, there was no grace in its terrifying appearance. The second head that had grown out of its neck was visibly underdeveloped and looked more like a contorted mask etched into the creature's flesh. The only thing that had changed were its eyes. Even in the sparse light of the moon, I could see that all four of them were decidedly brighter and distinctly humanoid.

I grabbed Cas by the arm, *hard.* "That's the Bies, it's taken over the bear," I hissed, holding the creature's savage gaze. Neither of us dared to move so much as an inch. The bear glared at us with impenetrable intensity. 

"So, we, uh… run?" my brother offered. "You first."

"Do I have to?" I felt like I was rooted to the spot, a sentiment obviously shared by Casimir. "Can't you try shooting at it?" I implored.

"I can," he answered at length, not averting his eyes from the possessed animal, "but not from the hip; what do you think me for? Some kinda wild west duelist? I need a distraction. You. You distract it."

I bit my lip. My wedding dress once more posed a great hindrance to me here—I had grown rather accustomed to it, that much was true, but it wasn't a good outfit to run in. I likely wouldn't get very far. Besides, I'd read that outrunning a bear was a pretty dumb thing to do anyways. This one was demonic to boot. But Cas was right. I would simply have to trust him.

Without further ado, I took off, leaping over sticks and stones, blindly into the darkness. An ear-splitting, bellowing roar rang out behind me, followed by several gunshots. Then, all of a sudden, Cas was there by my side, grabbing my hand from the side and pulling me along.

"I bought us some time," he panted. "Hurry!"

We ran alongside one another, spurred on by the mental image of the crazed predator tearing us to shreds. Somewhere behind us, another roar sliced through the night air, and I could see that my brother had broken into tears. Branches whipping in our faces, we staggered towards the house as fast as we could. I considered crying out to the guards, but seeing as Casimir's gun hadn't done enough damage to be lethal, I didn't want to draw in anyone else—they'd be more likely to perish in the attempt to help us. What we needed was a higher vantage point. That's when it hit me. There was an outhouse not far from here, and if we were to reach and climb it, we'd have a chance of gaining the upper hand, however briefly. 

I started steering him into the general direction. Panic-stricken, Casimir followed me blindly. "It'll be fine," I gritted out in-between gasps for air. "We can do this. Just stay close!"

A loud "Uh-huh!" was all the answer I received. I was grateful my brother was staying on top of everything though. Maybe it's a family thing, but I feel like we're good at dealing with fear. Sometimes. Finally, the outhouse came into view. I hastened to give Cas a quick leg-up before reaching up and letting him lift me off the ground. Before long, we were cowering atop the small building, leaning against one another and panting, palms and foreheads laced with sweat. 

"Are you okay?" I asked softly. 

"Yeah," Casimir muttered, clearly making an effort to steady himself. 

"You're doing so great," I added huskily. "Not that I'm the authority on that, but… but still."

Cas shook his head. "I could have done more. I hit it in the chest and in the shoulder, but I should have tried for the head right away. One of them, at any rate." He let out a soft chuckle, letting me know he was back to normal. "So, can bears climb?"

I gestured at the enormous creature lumbering up to us from between the trees. "We're about to find out."
