"I'm going crazy. We just ran through our last box of MREs. Current avenues of solution: be hungry. my guys eat first."

I glance up at Private Garrett, who is munching away on a packet of cookies. I glance back down at my notebook.
"If only it could make 'em shoot better."

Sergeant Brown sounds off from the driver's seat. "Give it a rest, man. She ain't writin' your ass back."

I snap my head up toward the driver's seat. "Yeah? How's the wife doing, B?"

Brown snaps back. "Just tryin' to save ya the heartbreak, man. Shit's not good for morale."

I glance back at my notebook. "Your shitty drivin' ain't good for morale, bud."

Brown responds, "Ope—speed bump!"

My helmet slams into the roof of the Humvee. B lets out a shit-eating giggle from the driver's seat. The other soldiers wince in pain. One of them, dazed, exclaims, "What the fuck? I was asleep!" Sergeant Brown retorts with a chuckle, "No dozing off on patrol, fuckers."

A convoy of Humvees drives in a single-file line down a narrow stretch of sandy road. At the front is a large armored vehicle with eight wheels, a manned machine gun, and a cannon on the roof, both facing the path ahead. The sky is blue, but the sun is blocked by the broad, sparsely vegetated mountains surrounding the convoy. Shadows fall across the uncharted road.

The lead truck speaks over the radio: "Convoy, this is Bandit 1. We're approaching the FOB. Give me status on fuel levels."

"Bandit 1, Bandit 2 is up."

"Bandit 3, copy."

"Bandit 4, we're up."

"Bandit 5, good to go!" B exclaims cheerfully.

B sets down his hand mic on the radio and continues the patrol. Four soldiers sit slouched forward in the tightly cramped cabin. I sit behind the driver's seat, my feet propped up on a large rucksack, writing in a notebook with a cigar sticking out of my scowling expression.

"The fuck's got you bein' all jovial now, B?" I grumble through my teeth.

B responds snootily, "The fuck did I tell you about smokin' in my truck, Ellis?"

I glance up at the rearview mirror, making eye contact with Brown. The soldier in the passenger seat, Lieutenant Sherman, interrupts. "This is the one chance he's got to burn one while his wife ain't lookin'. Leave the wretch be."

The driver remarks back, "Won’t have much to complain about when Jody gets in her bed sheets."

I lean forward. "Yeah, tell us, Sarge. The fuck do you know about Jody?"

Sergeant Brown releases his gaze from the rearview mirror, focusing back on the road. "I know enough that I quit smokin'."

I lean back on my bench. "Yeah, thought as much."

I settle back into my notebook while taking a long, satisfying puff of my cigar. A few seconds of silence pass, and Private Garrett scooches forward toward his side window.

"H-Hey! Look! It's a lil' bitty billy goat! Aww, and his momma's there too!"

He points the muzzle of his rifle toward the pair of animals grazing off the side of the road, imitating sounds of gunfire with his mouth. He sways the muzzle upward awkwardly, mimicking recoil.

Sergeant Brown sticks his hand out the window and snaps. "Hey. Hey. Hands and feet inside the ride, dickhead."

At the end of the stretch of road is a checkpoint surrounded by walls, towers, razor wire, and guns facing in every direction. Above the entryway hangs a looming, menacing sign that reads, "Forward Operating Base Faqir."

Brown drives into the base and pulls into an old, muddy motor pool with dozens of various armored desert vehicles parked neatly alongside each other. I hop out of our Humvee, rifle in hand, and slam the door shut behind me. I glance down at my watch. It reads 17:00. Supper time. I wave my hand toward the group of soldiers who exited the vehicle with me.

"Chow time."

They all groan a sigh of relief in unison. "See you fucks tomorrow, 04:30." I make my way out of the motor pool.

Log 77 – Baghdad

"I can't stop looking at the pictures Hailey and the kids sent me. The wait is unbearable. Something about the boredom... the fucking waiting... makes me want something—anything—to happen so I can get my mind off them for a moment.

I guess that's what the desert does to you. Everybody's itching for a fight. I wanted to see action the second I stepped foot in this place. Maybe something's wrong with me. But everyone else feels the same way, so at least I don't have to feel crazy just yet.

I just want to feel her arms around me again..."

Night falls on Forward Operating Base Faqir. The sun is completely obscured by the mountains that surround the desolate sands. The sky is blue, but shadows fall across the land, sending it into an early nightfall. Sparse tents, towers, razor wire, and loosely structured walls construct F.O.B. Faqir, more fondly referred to as F.O.B. Fuck-this-place

I grab my tray of food and make my way to my seat. A group of soldiers are huddled around a large box television with a football game playing: Kansas City Chiefs vs. San Diego Chargers. I spot Private Garrett in the center of the huddle, shirtless and drunkenly screaming at the game.

"If you miss this kick, I'm gonna fucking kill you myself, Ryan! You hear me?"

I walk up to the huddle, arms folded, watching the game. "Don't think he can hear ya, buddy."

Garrett looks back at me with a huge grin across his face. He reaches over, puts his hand on my shoulder, and leans me closer to the screen. The group goes silent, hunching over as Garrett whispers in my ear.

"The score is 20-20, and it's overtime. If the Chiefs make this field goal, we fucking win."

The group watches intently as the kicker, Ryan Succop, kicks at the dirt, readying himself for the field goal attempt. He lines up the kick and scores, winning the game. The group erupts into a hysterical mixture of cheering and protest. Garrett leans over to one of the soldiers.

"Gimme my money, baby! Gimme my money!"

I grin silently as I walk back to my table and finish my plate of food.

As I settle into my tent that night, I breathe a heavy sigh of relief, ending the long, miserable 12-hour workday. I walk past the rows of beds and lockers that neatly align the walls of the semi-cylindrical structure and find my rack at the back of the tent. I notice Sergeant Brown tying a line of paracord together.

"What's up, B?" I ask, removing my blouse.

"Eat shit, Ellis," B mutters, keeping his eyes focused on the paracord.

Befitting the dreary day I'm leaving behind, I mutter to myself, "Fuck this..."

I hang my blouse on the foot of my rack. "They ever find that Syrian lady who went missing?" I ask.

B doesn't look up. "Fuck if I know. Last I saw, she was workin' at the chow hall down the way."

I throw myself onto my bed and reach under my pillow, grabbing a tattered old Playboy magazine before opening it.

"Yeah, her mashed 'taters were shit anyhow," I respond.

B shrugs. "Weird how that happened though. Think her husband went crazy and left her carcass in the mountains or somethin'."

"Ya think so?"

"I dunno. Just what I heard."

I browse the pages of my magazine for a few minutes before tucking myself into bed. "Night, B."

The sounds of grown men chortling and the faint, rhythmic snare of music from a pair of earbuds echo a few rows down from me. I instinctively ignore it as I shut my eyes, ready for the restless few hours of sleep ahead.

A few hours go by, and I wake up with an uncomfortable need to piss. I roll out of bed and throw on my flip-flops. The latrines are in a separate tent, so I head outside.

I make my way over and open the door to find somebody standing right in front of a wall on the other side of the room, staring. Probably just some airhead sleepwalking again.

I walk up to the urinal, where I do my business. As I'm pissing, I hear the person whispering to themselves. It sounds like sobbing between short, heavy breaths and panicked muttering.

"Hey, buddy. You alright over there?"

The person jerks their head up, surprised, as if they hadn't heard me the whole time. Their soft, panicked whimpers turn into a quick sniffle as they wipe their nose, all the while avoiding eye contact with me.

"I'll be fine. Soon."

They look down toward the corner of the wall. "I just really wish you were home right now."

I tilt my head at them and squint in utter confusion. I look at the figure facing the wall and notice long, silky-smooth hair with blonde streaks and hoop earrings. She’s wearing a formal white shirt tucked into a black skirt that hugs tightly around her waist.

"Hailey..."

She turns around to make eye contact with me, her eyes glistening with tears. She doesn't say a word and just shoots me a smile, squinting through her tears.

I rush over and hold her tight in my arms, desperately moving my hand across her hair, unbelieving that the woman I’m embracing is really my wife. She rests her head on my shoulder.

"You aren't real... I'm dreaming," I whisper.

Hailey whispers softly, "Yes... you are."

She strokes my hair as I lower my head against her shoulder.

"But I'm here, baby. And as long as that's true, we'll both be okay."

I wait a moment before feeling tears well up in my eyes. "I want this to be real. I—I... don't..."

I lower myself to my knees, clinging tightly to her clothing. She places a gentle hand on my face as I close my eyes, placing my hand over hers. She whispers,

"Save us, John."

I slowly open my eyes and raise my head, meeting her gaze, as I gasp in confusion. It’s the woman who went missing at Camp Faqir several days ago. She speaks softly in my wife’s voice as her smile fades into a frown of serious intent.

"Save us."

I continue to stare, frightened. Her voice becomes more and more distant.

"Save us."

"Save us, John..."

"Save us... from the Ogre."

I awake to the sound of my wristwatch beeping. The time reads 04:00. I groan with dread, preparing myself mentally for the morning PT session.
