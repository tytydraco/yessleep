I’m sitting at my computer, soaking wet in the clothes I’ve been wearing all evening.

I wanna get this all down while I can still remember it perfectly. 

I say that like I’ll ever be able to forget it.

I was raised Baptist. I’ve lived in the deep south for most of my life, and it was normal to be religious, even zealously so. I went to the usual activities, vacation bible school, church camp, church three nights a week, sermons on sunday, and until I went to college I was pretty much a regular church goer. Once I left the area, getting out of that environment, I sort of fell off though. Suddenly, passing classes was a little bit more important than keeping up with my spiritual health. Suddenly parties and dating were more important than my relationship with God. So, I blinked one day and realized it had been almost fifteen years since I’d been to church, and thought I might like to experience it again. 

A quick Google search showed me a Church in my area not too far out of town. I saw from their community Facebook page that they were having an event on Saturday. Just a meet and greet for new members, bring a covered dish for the potluck, with a spiritual event to follow where new members could get baptized and join the church. I didn’t have anything going on Saturday, so that sounded pretty good to me. I made a macaroni casserole, one of the few things I actually knew how to make, and on Saturday I set out about 3 PM in my best church clothes.

As I pulled up outside the church, I was worried that I might be a little underdressed in my button-up and work slacks. The people going in, men in suit pants and crisp white shirts, ladies in long dresses, and kids in the sort of Sunday school clothes I was used to seeing at different churches, made me think there might be a dress code. I was new though, and I figured that if I wasn’t within the dress code, they would let me know. So I took my dish and headed for the fellowship hall that was set to the side of the church. 

I walked in the side door to a very familiar scene. The welcome was immediate and warm. A woman came to take my dish to the table as the pastor came to introduce himself as Pastor Marshall. I had expected a firm handshake and to be left to mingle, but the Pastor took me to each of the little groups there and introduced me to his congregation. I met his deacons, their families, the alderman and his wife, the treasurer, the under pastor, and about two dozen other families. I was escorted to the food table by some of the deacons and told which dishes were best, which ones were best avoided ("Ms. Liza is a good woman but there are always eggshells in her dressing"), and which had been made by eligible ladies of the church (Ms. Conroy's daughter is about your age and makes a great pecan pie). I was spirited away to a table where I was bombarded with questions and anecdotes and church gossip, and it was like being home again. The church I had belonged to in my childhood was very tight-knit and as the kids ran around and the adults talked and laughed quietly, I felt a sense of homecoming wash over me.

As the food was eaten and the plates were thrown away, we all moved into the worship hall for service.

I sat on the front row with the four or five other new faces and as Pastor Marshall mounted the pulpit, I couldn't help but smile.

I felt a warmth in me and was already thinking about how I would have to change my schedule so I could come on Sundays and Wednesdays.

As he laid out a sermon on acceptance and forgiveness, I began to reflect on my life here. It's hard not to when you've found somewhere you intend to stay for a while. In my mind, I would find fulfillment in the church, just like I had as a kid. I'd meet a nice girl here, raise a family in the church, and grow old with a community to support me.

I know it sounds kind of silly, but we all know the places that our minds go during times like this.

"I see we have some new faces on the front bench tonight. Would any of you like to join our church and get rebaptized tonight?"

I stood up like hot coals had been lit beneath me. I felt moved in a way that I never had to go to the altar, to renew my vows to God, and to be washed clean in the baptismal font. The Pastor smiled as he waved me up, and I had to stop myself from sprinting up the stairs. I was excited, I was in such a hurry to be a part of this.

I had no idea what I was in for.

The Pastor had me recite the affirmation, the renewal of my promise to God, and when he turned to indicate the space behind the pulpit, I realized they had an indoor baptismal pool. I had never seen one of these before, we always did our baptisms in the nearby creek, but as he took my hand and led me toward it, I realized he meant to baptize me fully clothed. I fished the things out of my pocket that I didn’t want to get wet, my phone, keys, and wallet, and set them on the stairs before stepping into the slightly warm water. I wouldn't normally have agreed to let my clothes get wet, I don’t like being in wet clothes as a rule, but I was operating in a daze and when he knelt to dip me, I felt my knees bending as I went down as well.

"I baptize you in the name of the Father, his Son, and the holy spirit. Good Luck."

I opened my mouth to ask why I would need luck, but as he dipped me back, my mouth was filled with water and I was enveloped in the warm embrace of the pool. It didn't have the acrid smell of chlorine like I had thought it would. It was salty, actually, and that took me by surprise. I lay on my back beneath the water, waiting to be pulled back up, and when I opened my eyes, I realized that the hand was gone and I was alone in the depths of the pool.

The pool was suddenly deeper than I remembered it. The surface glimmered miles above me, the bottom was a shadowy thought beneath me, and I was hovering in the depths like a diver. I started to panic, thinking I would drown, but the longer I sat beneath, the less this worried me. I was floating in the placid space, hovering in the placental moment, and I felt utterly at peace with the world and everything within it.

I didn't notice that something was getting closer to me until it was almost too late.

It began as a chill in the water, something that chased away the warmth of that pool. I opened an eye, looking to the far side, and saw a shadow rising from the distance. It was small at first, a black cloud that grew as it floated closer, but it grew wider as it came toward me. It was...I don't know. It was like something you see from the depths when you're still in the part of the water where light can reach you. It was something I was afraid would take hold of me and drag me into the murk where I would be lost.

Whatever it was, it filled me with a dread that I had never known before.

As it continued to draw closer, I thought it might be a whale. I had thought at first that it might be a bank of darkness, but as it drew closer, I could see that the blackness was just how it looked. It seemed to exist inside its own fog of murk, and what I could see of it wasn't terribly pleasant. Its skin was gray, pebbly like a stony shore, and appeared scaled or maybe ridged. Its eyes were huge, and the closer it got the smaller I felt. It was massive, beyond the description of size or dimensions, and the closer it got, the less I wanted to be the focus of its attention. This must be what an ant felt like as it stood on the finger of a human, what an insect feels like before the frog devours it, and I could feel my body vibrate under the strain of its continued existence.

It seemed to lean closer, our bodies inches from each other, and when it spoke, I could feel it in my bones.

"Welcome back, my child."

It reached out a finger, the prints on the end looking like the indicators on a map. Even the end of that finger was bigger than my whole body, and it was like someone reaching out with a building to touch you. I closed my eyes, fearing it would obliterate me with that massive digit, but when it came into contact with my forehead, I was enveloped in a blinding light that burned me to a cinder.

I came up gasping and thrashing from the depths, the Pastor catching me as the congregation cheered.

As their applause rose to envelope me, I looked down at the pool, expecting to see myself floating or standing on the edge of a lip, but the whole baptismal font was only about two feet deep. Standing up, I could see the water wasn't even over my knees. The pastor looked up, still bent and kneeling on the bottom of the pool, and his expression was resplendent. Did he know that would happen? Had anything happened while I had been floating in the abyss? The longer I stared at him, the longer I came to believe that he had known that would happen, and his eyes seemed to be trying to calm me, as he stood up and embraced me as a brother.

As he did, I heard him whisper into my ear to be easy.

"Steady, son, steady. It's a little jarring the first time, but it's all over now. Rejoice in the light, and be well."

When I looked at him again, I could see a deeper understanding in his eyes, something I didn’t know how I had missed before.

When I looked out across the congregation, it was a look I saw mirrored in them as well.

I was speechless, unsure of what to do, and when he led me out of the pool it was all I could do not to break into a run.

He offered me a towel, letting me stand shivering beside the pool as he asked the others if they wanted to come up. When the second man approached, seeming more hesitant than I had been, I grabbed my things and snuck out the choir entrance that led to the Fellowship Hall. It was empty now, the whole space covered in semi-shadow, and within that shadow, I could feel the regard of whatever had spoken to me in the depths. 

The next thing I knew I was in my car and driving much too fast for him.

It was a miracle that I didn't get pulled over, though I briefly wondered who I should thank for it.

As I sit here now, my shaking has nothing to do with the cold. 

If this is the God of my father, the God I have been praying to all my life, then I think I'd rather be an atheist.

Even as I sit here now, I can still imagine floating in that void as the ancient creature regards me kindly, its mind brushing against my own, and the dread threatens to overtake me again.

I’d pray for oblivion, but I know what's waiting there to greet me now.
