The first thing I did after standing up, was to walk back to the door and open it again. I knew it was a long shot, but I had to try. Sure enough, the effort was in vain, and the stairs were gone. The empty hallway of the house was all that greeted me.

I slumped down in a heap. A turmoil of emotions was swimming through my head. I was grateful to be alive and out of that treacherous labyrinth, but I felt supremely guilty in my relief when I thought about Sherrie and how she had been unable to escape with me. I knew there had to be something I could do to help from this side. Maybe I could try and find out what that place really was and how to get her out. Or failing that, get a small arsenal of weapons to go back with.

Either way, since I was back again I had to make the most of the opportunity to try and get help. As I considered what to do, a more mundane concern came to mind, my job. I walked over to where my phone was charging. I figured I might be able to make some calls and arrange some coverage for work while I sorted this madness out.

I nearly gasped when I saw the date on the screen. It had to be a mistake, but my phone said that it was Tuesday, nearly a week after I had gone into the stairs!

Last night had been Wednesday night. That was when I went back inside. How could it have been that long this time? The first night I was trapped in there, it hadn’t been that long, or had it? I could not remember checking the date, but it couldn't be, how had so much time passed while I was in there?

I started scrolling through my missed notifications. I had dozens of calls and angry messages from work and I realized if I had been gone for nearly a week, they had probably fired me by now.

I had no believable explanation for my absence, but the other messages from my parents are what really concerned me. After a lot of check in calls and texts from my mom, the urgency and concern became clear. At first, I assumed it was just because they were worried that I was not answering, but the concern became more specific and distressed as they went on. The last message was very long and disturbingly specific. As I read it, I realized she had known more than she was letting on when I had spoken with her about the room, Sherrie and the stairs.

“Please answer sweetheart. You need to let us know if you are okay. I told your father we should not have let anyone else stay in that room after Sherrie went missing. He said she probably just left, he never believed something was there, but I knew something was not right. He never had the dreams, he never saw them. Please don’t go in. If you see them, stay away. Even if it feels like a dream, there are things in there, bad things."

She was right about that, I morbidly considered as I continued to read her message.

"I think Sherrie went in and she never came back. Many years ago, when we bought the house, we found odd markings carved in the upstairs bedroom from one of the previous owners. It said something about a flight of endless stairs and how they had to get to the top. It said that they appear to those sensitive to the resonance. But after your father cleaned up the writing and ignored the warning, nothing happened. After living there for thirty years, we believed it was safe. But just before we left, I started dreaming about them. The stone stairs, the endless spirals. We never should have let new people stay in that house. You never saw them when you were a child, so we thought you were safe. But not after your last call and all these days....Please son, if they are there, if you see them, you need to leave. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner, your father does not like it when I talk about the stairs and the history of our house. But he does not believe it because he never saw anything himself. Please let us know you are safe.”

I was stunned by the message, she knew. She had seen them, if only dimly. Where the hell had they come from and how many people have been lured in and lost to time and space?

I tried to call my mom back and let her know I was okay, but I found it strange that my phone had no reception suddenly. I had no bars when my room normally had the best signal in the house. I knew it had been a week, but my phone line couldn't have been shut off.

I decided to try and step outside and see if that worked. I walked downstairs to go outside. As I reached the ground floor, I suddenly felt lightheaded. A deep-seated nausea and vertigo kicked in that nearly knocked me on my back. I managed to lift my head up after breathing deep and trying to stop myself from getting sick. I shambled towards the front door, needing that fresh air more than ever.

When I touched the handle on the front door I suddenly felt a terrible chill in my body. I pulled the door open slowly and a profound dread gripped me. Numbing terror set in as soon as I looked through the door. It was not the outside, it was the stairs. I looked on at the towering spiral steps and fell back inside. I slammed the door shut and closed my eyes. I slapped my own face a couple times for good measure and threw the door open again.

The yawning stone edifice greeted me again once more. I slammed the door again harder than the last time and clutched my head. It could not be happening again, and now with other doors!

I started looking around and saw the outside through the windows. I dashed over to the window in the living room and reached for the lock. As soon as the window started opening I saw a curtain of pitch black instead of the outside.

I poked my head in and turned on my phone's flashlight. Then I realized it was the square interior of one of those stone rooms I had waited in with Sherrie. Shaking my head in disbelief, I slowly closed the window and backed away.

I was trapped, it was real, I was awake. It had happened in the daytime this time. Even though I had not gone into the stairs, the stairs had come to me. They were everywhere now and they would not let me leave without venturing back into that insanity.

I had to think of something. I decided to try the basement door. There was another exit through there. I stumbled down the steps into the cold basement. Nearly falling as I moved. I looked around, shining my phones light to try and find the light switch.

I found it and turned it on. As soon as I could see around the basement, I found the door. The only other exit I could think of. I moved towards it and held my breath. Grasping the handle and pulling. It shifted slightly but did not move. I felt an odd resistance, like there was some sort of weight, or pressure on the other side. I didn’t know if it was a good sign or a bad one, but I was desperate to get out of there. I pulled even harder than before and heard a strange sound, almost like splashing water. I gave one last tremendous pull and the door opened.

My mistake was evident immediately, water burst forth into the basement. The briny smell of salt water stung my nostrils, even as it flooded into the basement. I took one look into the doorway where the water was coming from and saw the unmistakable architecture of the stone steps.

They were down there too, and worse it seemed like the basement was a portal to the flooded zone. The water crashed into the basement and I desperately tried to close the door again, but the weight of the water was too much and it threw me off my feet.

I took one last panicked breath of air as the water rose past my head and continued pouring in, filling the entire basement in a few more moments.

I started to swim, desperately seeking the stairs and the door back out. I saw them and I struggled through the crushing current of water pushing me along and battering me into shelves and walls. I saw the stairs and swam as fast as I could.

The door was just within reach, my body ached my lungs burned, holding onto that last gasp of air I had managed before submerging. I swam up and reached the top of the stairs which had not flooded yet and I pulled myself out of the water with great effort. I shoved the door open and as I was about to crawl out and slam it shut, something grabbed my leg.

I looked down in disbelief at a dark green tentacle. I tried to pull away from it but it clung on tighter and I lost my hold on the door and fell back, hal submerged into the water and clinging to the top of the stairs.

There was a terrible burning sensation in my leg as is squeezed and felt like it was cutting me somehow. I tried to pull free again, but the iron grip of the thing wrapped around my leg was enough to stop me from leaving. Not only could I not gain any ground, I had to hold on for dear life not to be pulled back into the dark water.

My leg felt numb as it squeezed again and I cried out. Looking around I saw nothing on the stairwell to help free myself. Worse still I felt like whatever was pulling me, was moving and I heard a low rumbling in the water below and I knew I had to get out of that situation immediately.

Suddenly the staircase banister broke off and I nearly pitched into the water with the loss of balance. I held onto a broken fragment of the top step and suppressed a gasp of pain and the jagged wood cut my hands. Looking back at the bubbling surface of the water, I saw another tentacle emerge. It was grasping and snaking near my other leg. I had to move fast. I reached for the broken banister and kicked the base of it with my unrestrained leg.

It broke off and I grasped for and finally reached the sharp piece of broken wood. I set to work, hacking and cutting and sawing the monstrous tentacle off of my leg. It started to squeeze harder and began thrashing and shaking me as I desperately cut to free myself. The surface of the water rippled and a small whirlpool began swirling.

I tried to look away and focus on freeing myself, but to my horror more tentacles rose up from the water and a giant eyeball was visible in the center of the whirlpool. It stared at me and I felt a numb sensation go through my body. I felt like it would not be so bad to just let go and swim back into the water. To go back to the depths and black abyss from which all primal life emerged from. It would not be so bad, if I just gave up.

I forced myself to look away at the last moment, before I had given up completely. The mental invasion reminded me of the things that attacked me and Sherrie. That thought shook me out of the mesmerized stupor I was in. Remembering the imminent danger, I took another large swing of the broken piece of wood, finally cutting the restraining tentacle off my leg.

There was a low rumbling sound from the water that might have been pain. Then I threw the sharpened wood like a spear right at the eye of the horrible leviathan and dove back out the water and through the door.

Grasping, seeking appendages followed me and even extended through the door, But I barged into it from my side with my entire body weight and the door cut the tentacles off and slammed closed. I was horrified, but alive. I realized I had finally seen the things in the water that Sherrie had said, were worse than the blind ones.

I shuddered and limped along, away from the basement door. I had a large, lamprey mouth shaped wound on my leg that was bleeding and it felt almost completely numb. I hobbled into the downstairs bathroom and grabbed a first aid kit to treat the injury.

Taking a deep breath, I realized I couldn't escape now. Whatever was in there, it was not going to let me leave and get help. I understood now the desperate message that people had taken to writing on the walls before they ventured into the stairs the final time. They must not have had a choice either.

I staggered back to the front door and looked at the portal leading to that living nightmare.

The rational part of my brain battled with my heart when I considered my next move. I knew it would be crazy to try and go back. I knew I should never go back on those stairs if I valued my life and sanity. Maybe I could stay and wait it out? But could I really just leave her trapped in that hell? It would have been cruel to condemn a stranger to that fate, but I found the idea of leaving her even worse.

Despite the short time we had been together, I found myself drawn to her. I wanted to see her again, to talk with her again. I thought of her quirky rhyming and sincere smile, when she had seen me come back from the brink of death. She did not know me, but she had saved me, helped me.

Even if I did not admit I was attracted to her, I still felt responsible. I owed it to her, to protect her, just as she had protected me.

My course was settled, I had to go find Sherrie. Maybe together we could find a way to escape for good. We might find a way to get out while the stairs would let us. It had to work, because if it didn't, then I would be joining her forever in that stone purgatory of endless horror.

I took one last look behind me at the house, then summoned my courage and stepped towards the door.
