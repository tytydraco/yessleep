I’ve been in here for so long. I know the child tried to use my laptop, but all it could do was hit the keys. I came downstairs one morning to a letter at the bottom of my stairs. A note from *it.*

“under stair” it said.

I froze.

I think it feels bad for me. I think it had no choice. It’s definitely not calling the shots, the one with the boots is.

Oddly enough I can still connect to my house’s Wi-Fi from this side, I just need to stay in or around the closet. I need some help on getting back, or maybe even how to communicate with the child, so I’ll tell you what’s happened up until now.

I had just moved into the house. The staircase had been stripped back to bare wood, and a few of the steps in the middle had slight gaps at their base where you could just about see into the closet beneath. I didn’t think anything of it at first; the house was old, and the closet was far too dark to see into properly anyway. But lately, every time I walk up the stairs, there’s a moment where my eyes line up with the gap, and it gives me the eeriest feeling. It’s like when you glance through a door’s peephole and expect to see something staring back, or a shadow moving past.

I told myself the feeling was normal. Like the childish instinct to run up the stairs after turning the lights off so the monsters don’t catch you. Except in the real world there *are* no monsters. At least, that’s what I used to believe.

I should have known something was wrong before I even moved in. When I first came to view the house, there wasn’t a single person on the street. A few curtains twitched, but that was it. An entire road seemingly devoid of life.

The day I moved in, my neighbour was in his front garden watering his flowers. I waved and said hello. He stared ahead as though I didn’t exist, continuing to water the soil. Not even a flicker of acknowledgement. I thought he might just be antisocial, but it happened with everyone over the next few weeks. Kids cycling past. The family opposite unloading their groceries. Nobody reacted to me at all. Not even a glance.

I would’ve thought it was some strange prank, but there’s no way you convince children to commit to something like that.

The final straw was the postman. I was putting up curtains and saw him walking down the street. I realised I hadn’t received a single letter since moving in, not even junk mail. It is 2025, but I hadn’t ever just received *nothing*.

But as I watched him, I saw something stranger. He was cheerfully greeting the kids and chatting with neighbours in the most cliché manner possible:

“Got any bills in there? You can keep them!”  
“Don’t worry, the dog doesn’t bite… much!”

It was like watching a pantomime of 1950s suburbia. The people didn’t even seem real.

But what really unnerved me was what he *did*. At each house he’d walk up the path, stand in front of the letterbox for a second, then return to the pavement and keep walking. Never posting a thing. As though he’d observed a postman from afar but had no idea what posting letters actually meant. I didn’t think it was worth making a complaint about not getting my mail, apparently no one was.

After that, I stopped trying to communicate with anyone. Life settled into a strange routine. Inside the house, however, things began to worsen.

The eerie feeling when I passed the crack in the stairs grew stronger. Around the house, I constantly felt someone was following in my footsteps. When I left the kitchen after cooking, I swore I heard pots and pans clattering behind me. After I had a shower, I could hear the shower curtain sliding back and forth when I had left the room.

It all made me feel like I was losing my mind.

Then came the nightmares.

Every time I fell asleep, I’d jolt awake the way you do when you fall in a dream, but my eyes would open to a different version of my bedroom. The layout was the same, but the room looked decades older, abandoned. I couldn’t move, hear, smell, or feel. It was as though I were a camera placed on the pillow, facing the wall.

The wallpaper was mouldy, peeling in places to reveal damp plasterboard. Part of the bedside table was visible, along with an ashtray overflowing with cigarette butts. I don’t smoke.

These dreams lasted what felt like hours, the room slowly brightening as though dawn were breaking. I couldn’t move at first, not even blink. Over time, though, each subsequent dream granted me a little more control. I could shift my eyes. Then tilt my head slightly. Enough to take in more of the room. A filthy carpet with dark patches; a tattered chair draped with clothes; a stained white T-shirt, grimy jeans, and mud-caked boots at its base.

The last dream in that room was the worst. For the first time, I managed to rotate my head enough to see the window on the wall in front of the bed. Except the window was boarded up. Thick wooden planks nailed haphazardly across it. Through the gaps, I’m sure I could make out movement. A silhouette slowly moving side to side, as if peering in. It would have to be enormous to reach the upstairs window.

I focused all my energy on moving my hand, trying to break the paralysis. My vision began to shake. The silhouette froze. Then a massive hand rose and pressed against the window. One finger raised and started tapping slowly, using its nail.

I woke up instantly.

The nightmares became more frequent. Once every two weeks, then weekly, then every other night.

In them, words appeared scratched into the wall in broken English:

“Live home.”  
“Food.”  
“On TV.”

Something was communicating.

I thought I could break the cycle by switching bedrooms. I moved into the smaller spare room piled high with unpacked boxes. That night I had no dreams. I thought I’d broken the cycle. As if they were anxiety dreams, and I just need to get out of my funk.

Until the day I stood from my desk and heard, ever so faintly, the sound of typing behind me, long after I’d stopped typing myself.

That night, the dream returned. But now I was seeing this room. A *child’s* bedroom. The walls were covered in crude drawings; handprints, stick figures, houses on a street. It was my street. Every house was crossed out. Except mine.

I woke at sunrise, bolted downstairs in my underwear, and ran into the road. The drawing matched exactly. The houses, the street, everything. And still, stood in the middle of the street. Nobody looked at me.

When I returned inside, trembling, I glanced at the crack in the stairs.

And an eye was staring through at me.

I froze. It blinked. Then darted away.

I tore open the cupboard under the stairs. No one. But carved into the walls were strange symbols, unlike any pentagrams or graffiti I’d ever seen. More like crude hieroglyphs.

That was it. I had to leave, even if I had nowhere to go.

But the moment I stepped outside, every person on the street froze and stared at me. Cars stopped. My neighbour stood motionless, hose spraying his feet, eyes fixed on me.

I backed into the house, and they all resumed as normal.

I couldn’t leave. I couldn’t sleep. Every day, every one of my actions echoed. Boots following my steps, pans clattering when I left the kitchen.

One night I didn’t dream. But I was awoken to the sound of banging from my front door. I looked out of the window of the bedroom, and I could see my neighbour continuously banging the front door. I ran downstairs to see what was going on, when a knock on the window beside me caused me to jump. Looking, it was the postman. A blank expression on his face. Just banging on the window to the same rhythm of the banging on the door. One by one each downstairs window started banging, all in exact rhythm with each other. It grew louder and louder as they banged harder and harder. It became deafening. Something splintered on the front door as it started to give way.

I raced back upstairs, only to be stopped dead in my tracks. I was looking straight into the same eye again. It pushed a note through the crack that just had one word on it.

“follow”.

It flicked sideways, indicating the cupboard.

I threw myself into the cupboard and slammed it shut.

Silence.

When daylight crept through the crack, I opened the door, and stepped into a different house entirely. My house, but rotted, ruined, abandoned. Windows boarded from the inside with smashed up furniture. An old fridge barricading the front door. Damp, mould, decay everywhere. It was like the rooms from my dreams, but real.

Movement flickered past the boarded windows.

I ran upstairs, and into my bedroom. The child’s bedroom.

The walls were fully covered in drawings; a sprawling map of the neighbourhood. Every building marked. Notes scrawled in a childish hand:

“Food here.”  
“Don’t go.”  
“Dead.”  
“He watches.”

Huge stick-figures with scribbled eyes were drawn in certain areas, like the park down the road and the woods behind my house.

Outside the window, through a gap in the boards, the neighbourhood was in ruins. Houses collapsed, a crater in the road, trees burnt to husks. Grey desolation as far as I could see.

Then, I heard knocking.

It came from the upstairs bathroom, which was now boarded up and barricaded. Something was pushing on the door and knocking.

I backed down the stairs, and as I did my eyes caught the crack.

I ran back to the closet under the stairs and slammed the door closed. I stared out through the crack, and I could see *my* house. My actual house. Untouched. Clean. Normal. I could hear faint sounds. Someone was in *my* house.

There was a pile of paper that whoever was talking to me used to push the message through the crack.

I began writing page after page.

“Help.”  
“I’m stuck.”  
“Who are you?”  
“Where am I?”

A muddy boot stamped down on my notes, and its filthy hand picks them up, before stomping back upstairs.

I found jugs of what might be rainwater, but no food. I keep pushing letters through the crack. I think the child manages to catch some of them.

I’m going out to look for food and maybe a generator or something to keep my laptop charged. The map shows safe zones and routes I can take to avoid whatever the big stick-man thing is.

In the meantime; does anyone know what I could try?
