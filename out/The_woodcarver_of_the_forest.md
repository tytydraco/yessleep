My name is Kate Fisher, and there is a woodcarver in the forest. This story happened in 2009 when I was 28.

My husband divorced me, after he caught us. I didn't want to do that to him, I loved him you know. I can't get his face out of my head, when he beat the guy he had tears, rage, and discussed all over it. I know God will never forget, and he will never forgive me. 

My mother was disappointed in me, when I told her. My father, right next to her, I can tell that he wanted to say out loud whore. 

I wanted to get out.

So I looked into it, and a house that was dirty cheap, appeared out of nowhere. To rent 900$ a month. Two stories high, deep in the woods. when I say deep its 6 hours away from civilization. So I thought it would have no warm water, no electricity, and a cockroach invasion.

Every single thought I had was wrong. It was nice it had everything. but internet, I didn't care. It was a house, and I didn't want to say no so I got it. The dude that owned it was in his 50s, he was shy and wanted to rent the house. So i looked into it and he showed me around, kitchen, a little cubby space under the stairs, on the side living room. behind the stairs a back door with a shoe rack, and a coat hanger. Up stairs a door on to the right side. bedroom, down the hall bathroom. It was perfect. I asked him who lived here before he left, He said with a Texas accent "I think he left because of a wood Carver." I was confused "cuz of a wood carver?" I said. he looked at the woods "Yea... because of a wood Carver." he said. Thinking there's a people at the time I said "there's neighbors" he looked at me and said "no... you can walk in your birthday suit nobody would notice."when he said that he started saying sorry he didn't mean to make me uncomfortable I said "it was alright" him with a red face walks away saying sorry over and over again to his blue car he said "my father's Canadian... sorry" And he was gone. i was all alone. I went into the house and put cans, pasta, chips and Mr. noodle cups in the cupboards of the kitchen.

 took a shower, the red and white tiles on the ground made me feel uneasy. I think.

My first night was fine, no problems. There was no tv in the bedroom but I did bring DVDs to watch. So I went down and watch something. I think I heard of sticks at the time I thought it was an animal.

I spent 6 days in the house. looking around, making sure there was nothing wrong with the place, and found woodcarvings. One under my bed, on 3th night it looked like a man screaming its teeth unnerved me, Its shape was like a spiral. I didn't know what to do so I left it alone under my bed. another one in the bathroom, found this one under the sink on the 5th night. it was a lady I think? long hair, not screaming this time, it was shaped like a triangle, its nose was huge. oh I didn't mention both of them did not have eyes, they were just holes. It made me have chills. so I watched the god father. It was 9 am when I finished it. Took a shower after the movie   but the carving made me feel horrible like I did something. So I threw it out

The lady carving, kept making me feel on edge. I did not sleep well that night. I felt like it was going to do something to me for some reason. I was praying to just fall asleep. I did... but it was hell not the heaven i prayed for.

sleep paralysis is horrible, I had waking nightmares a lot when I was a kid every night my parents say "you would start screaming out no where we run to your room, and we would wake you up and you would say why are you scared to us." They stopped when I was 14. opened up my eyes and realized I could not move at all. I heard laughing I looked everywhere. laid my eyes on the window, I wish I didn't do that. I saw a man watching me, basically a shadow at the time. my heart was going 100x faster I think I was sweating I don't know, don't care. I think he saw me looking at him he tried to open the window I tried to move with all my will power and... Nothing. I tried screaming and nothing, the man at the window opened it he put one long arm in I heard crunching like sticks. The man still standing outside the window, his arm got longer and longer till he's hand was Inc's away.

I Shot out of sleep, with yellow beams of light. I ran out of the bedroom, flying down the stairs and I was out front. only my panties and tank top on and I froze and said to myself "oh my god..." Running back in the house. "oh my god... I'm a fucking idiot!" Went back in and laughed. I was a fool it was all a dream I thought. God I wish it was. 

On the same day, I went to the store. before that I went in the back, and I realized there was no roof there. so my dream was just a dream I thought then. I got in my car, and started the drive. took 5 hours and I didn't seen a car at all. when I saw people a relief 
Overwhelmed me and I said quietly "thank goodness." I pulled in the parking lot. I checked the time, it was 4:35 pm. I went in, got food that would last me months for me.


The cashier was a 20 year old goth kid. when she was scanning the stuff, I lean on the counter and I said "what's the drama around the town?" I can tell she wanted to roll her eyes out of her skull. 
She was pale, black makeup around her eyes. she spoke "about Robert's wife fucking her neighbor Dennis" my eyes widen, she continued
"Or Billy green setting fires, or that cheerleader had a baby at 16." "...no." I said, she looked at me and said in an annoyed tone "then what?" "I wanted to know about the woodcarver" I said her eyebrows pushed up, she said "the weirdo in the woods?" "Ya." I responded. She came back to life, 
She couldn't stop talking "the weirdo has been doing this for years, when my parents were kids. I think he killed that bear two years ago." She continued "he probably killed those hikers in the woods?" I stopped her there "hold on the bear ,and the hikers, what?" I said she looked at me and said "you're new to this... nice." I said "I want to know about the bear?" She looked at me with a big smile and said "oh ah ok this is what I know about the bear, it was found by 3 kids. the bears skull was gone, a couple of ribs too. the hikers died the some way I think ahhhh the PD says it was a serial killer." She said. I was shocked. A little town with so many secrets 

"Thanks for telling me." I responded, the goth said "well at least I'm not the only one who sees this." I looked at her "only one?" I said with curiosity. she said "everyone tries not to talk about it, it's so weird." I waved goodbye and said "what's your name?" She blushed and said "J... Jacoby" I said "That's a beautiful name."

When I got out, it was sunset. and I think it was 6:25 pm I had three bags in my hands I was going to my car and remember the low Gus tank I put my stuff in the car and walked to a Gus station didn't want to burn more fuel I walked downtown and saw the station, the glowing red light of the billboard.

I went in. some rough neck of a man was at the counter, with cigarette in his mouth, and sunglasses Sitting down. when I got closer I realized, his legs one foot was gone, and the other at the knee. I gasped in shock and he noticed "honey please don't look." He said. in horror i replied "sorry... So sorry" he looked at me and said "ok lady get what you need and get out" I said "do you have ahhhh gus can?" He looked all around sarcastically and said with Gus cans behind him "I don't think so." A dude in the store started laughing hard "stop laughing" he said, the dude stopped but still giggled to himself. I did not know what to say so I said "Ahhhh my name is Kate" with my hand extended, and we shook hands, he said in a deep voice "tom is my name."
I thought and said "do you go hunting?" He took his sunglasses off and said "I don't like shooting at a deer" with vibrant green eyes. I said "that makes two." I asked him "what's with the woods?" Tom said "something is wrong out there." Curiosity overwhelmed me and he said "something fucked is happening, its like urban legends coming true." I said "then go?" He said "I have family here. I just want the best for them, ok" I nod "here and get a full can for free." He said. I said "thanks" tom said "just get out, I'm fucking tired." When I got out, I walked to the side, and I pulled my phone out. and I called my mom... it rang and rang and rang till it hit voicemail I almost cried. I breathed deeply out.
I could not tell you how I felt. It was like I heard 


So I left the dimly green lights of the gas station and went back, it was 6:58 pm. seeing a kid on a porch smoking, a man grilling sausages, and a teen stealing a bike. With purple warm skys I reached my car, opened up the door sat down in the driver's seat and... I Seen it. a wood carving, on the Hood of my car. I got out, and I got closer. I held it in my hands looking at it deeply. it's shape was like a cube, the face of the wood carving. a big smile, nose showed the nasal skull, and no eyes again this shit spooked hell out of me. I filled up the car and went to the police I reported it. but they said there's not enough evidence, and go back home. Hell no, I'm going to stay here, and wait till morning.

I slept there, and another fucking nightmare. I was moving this time, a lamp in my hand with its orange light showed my path. crunching of leaves and sticks under my shoes. I think there was wind, I was saying "hello anybody!" and I stopped. A caped figure it's back to me is crouched to the ground. the cape had sticks penetrating out. it stood up higher than me I think it was 7.5. slowly turned around.

I woke up breathless, with cold sweats. a female police officer seen my act of terror on my face, she walked up "you ok?" She said, I look at her "no I'm not ok!" The police officer looked at me with eyebrows high ''whats wrong?" She said with a Texas accent. without skipping a heartbeat I said "there's a fucking woodcarver in the woods, messing with me!" I said"how long has this been going on?" The police officer said in a plain tone "a week." I replied, she looked at me like my parents did, and said "well I really can't do anything." I was shocked "you can't be serious?" I said "I can do a search." The police officer said, I was so happy when she said that. I got in my car with the officer behind me. 

we reached the house, nothing was disturbed outside. The officer said "why you up here?" I responded "it was 900$ a month." The officer said "ok." She entered the front door of the house, and I stood outside. "Nice place." I heard the officer said "ya... it is." I said nervously a long pause and I heard ''do you woodcarve?" I ran in, and I seen it. the woodcarving one Half was just wood. on the other, head perfectly carved. the only thing wrong  about it... No eyes. I said "it's him. god dame it he place it there!" The police officer put her gloves on, and picked it up. She reassured me "if he place it here, he's fingerprints he's probably on it." She said "I'm sorry I just... feel like I'm losing my mind." I said. The police officer said "don't worry everyone feels like that in life." I said back "I don't think so." Officer said "I think you need to go for a run, or something ma'am" she was right I thought, I have been in a house with no contact with other people, and We talked.

Before she left I asked her "what happened to the hikers?" I said. she looked and said back "oh those poor souls? they got ripped apart. there spines were missing, with there skulls as well. it was a bear Sheriff says. but I don't know, those cuts don't look like a bear did it." 

At the time I did not think about it.  just creepy stories that you tell new people and other hikers to scare them. after all this 10 years later, I did some research, and found a news article. it says 

"4 missing 2 found dead!'" it goes on "6 hikers went to small town called 'blank' they went on August 13th of 2005. 3 weeks passed. the familys opened missing person reports. 3 kids in the woods found Christopher Green, and Donnie Green brothers, dead. both of the men's skin were we're cut in spirals, and both mens skulls were gone. The Family's are praying that the other hikers are still alive." They were never found.

At the time, I never knew that. It gives me chills now, everytime I think about. 

The officer said her farewells, and left with the woodcarving. I know it sounds ridiculous but I started yoga after 2 days. Started going on walks, runs, and meditating. Don't you know it 2 weeks passed, watching movies over, and over, again.

Malachi appeared out of nowhere.

"Oh hey... Mike." I said.
Malachi said "it's Malachi."
I said "sorry."
Malachi "it's all right." 
"Ahhhh Why are you here?" I said 
Malachi said "I'm getting my brothers stuff in the attic."
"Oh how is he." I said 
Malachi "he's fine, he's a bastard sometimes."

He walked in and went upstairs and I went to the kitchen 

"Do you want anything?" I said 
Malachi yelled down "no."

I started to make a sandwich for myself and I heard "got it!" Malachi yelled down 

I was done making my sandwich. He came down with two boxes "I found a box you might like it." He said. He place it on the counter I said "thanks."
"Ok I'll be out of your hair." Malachi said 
"See ya." I said back, he closed the door behind him. I walked to the box and opened it.
Wood carving tools. One look like a sickle, knives. many more steel, sharp objects, in it.
I made a campfire, and throwing the woodcarving tools in it.

Fuck... that... shit, I had enough of that, and plus there was no fingerprints on the woodcarving that police officer took. I was pissed off so
went to the town. I swear to God the drives were there own hell.

I reached the town. had a low fuel can so I went to the gas station.
"hey Tom." I said "oh, hey are you going to stare at my legs." Tom said I thought and responded "sorry just had horrible night." Tom said "it's alright." I got my can filled it up I paid and said "how's the family?" Tom said back "good but I'm worried about the animals." Confused I asked him "why?" Tom taked off his sunglasses and said "the wolves that were found." "I'm sorry but Im not in town often." I said. Tom rubbed his face and said "a pack of wolves were found dissected... the only thing that was taked was they're bones." 
I was wondering what to say so I said "... Nice." With Thumbs up.
He Stared at me with confusing and backed up and, said "... Ya you don't come out much, don't you." "Yeah." I said.

 I just want to say, I'm not a social butterfly.
As kid I was alone all the time. my parents did nothing to help, just left me alone. I think that stunted my growth of social stuff.

After I got my Gus, I went to my car and put it in the trunk, and I went to the bar. I looked around and I seen Jacoby, drinking whiskey out of the bottle. I waved to her she saw me, and she said "heeeyyyyyy!" She was wasted. "Want some help for the way home?" I said she giggled and said to me "no no no... I live up here." She pointed up to the roof, "On the second floor." She said. "oh" i said we talked about cryptids, folklore, urban legend. And I said "how are urban legends even made?" She said in a drunken state "they're made by spirit's I thin... think... That got tired of being fo... forgotten... I read it some where." 
In giggly mood I said "well you have to be careful where you read it from." Her head on the table passing out "think the unexpected." She said "ok girl!" I said. I left her there. I know a dick move on my part. 

I got in my car... drunk, another stupid thing. I put it in drive, and the way home I go. Turn on the radio it was... Billy Joel I was singing out loud not paying attention. I looked a standing upward log in front of me. I turned my car swerving

I think I did a 360 motion with my car, and everything stopped. my hair all messy. I opened the glove box, the flashlight dropped to the car floor I looked, and found it. I headed out, to see what the fuck it was doing in the middle of the road. I looked... nothing.

 I was so confused. I thought it was the beer. Someone spiked my beer. So drove carefully. When finally got to the house, I opened up door, and fell asleep. 

A another dream, this one was weird or weider.
I was on the forest floor. Vines holding my hands, and legs. I was screaming. I don't know why. The colors of the sky change to red. I looked forward and seen a figure in cape. I just saw the outline, it came closer and closer. I broke one of my hands free. try to free the other hand but the thing was right in front of me. I looked up, and I woke up.

I'm sorry I don't write often, and I have to talk about it. because things are going too far.

I got up, blurry vision, head throbbing. I went upstairs. made myself a bath. It felt amazing. afterwards, I got in fresh clothes, I went downstairs, the front door was open. closed it saying to myself what dumbass I am.

I decided to go for a walk. I opened up the back door and went in wilderness. I don't know how long I was walking for, but I found trees, with faces on them. I shook my hole body, and a chill ran down my back. I looked all around more, and more when I squinted. I thought how long had this gone on for? It was just wood carvings after wood carvings after wood carvings, it looked like it was Infinity.

I said "what the hell!"

When I think back. I feel like the woodcarvings on the trees were warnings, I'm so disappointed in past self.


I headed back home. I looked everywhere, making sure nobody was watching me, or follow me. Every crack of a stick, made me go faster. The dark blue sky, it was horrifying. When I seen my house I bolted for it, got to the stairs and fell. I clawed myself up, I think my heart stopped beating but I still
opened the back door went in and locked it.

I had a big golp of air. in and out in and out. tomorrow I'll leave, fuck this place I should had left this place a long time ago, I put up a knife,and left.

I went in my car and hit the pedal. I stopped to the side after 8 hour's of driving sat in the back and slept hoping for dream and thinking of what to do.

I opened my eyes and seen tall lines. Shortly realized I was in the forest not alone. I was where the faces are. I looked all around, bawling my eyes out. With tears running down my face I said "what do you want!" Wind from all directions came to me leaves flying, something right out of the evil dead. I buried my head into the ground. hearing the leaves and... silence thinking it was over. "I just want your face." In child's voice. I booted out of there, I ran, I ran, I ran, and I ran but I could still see the faces on the trees. I tripped and fell, I hit my head, and I passed out not for long. I woke up to this thing, holding me by the neck punched its arm it did nothing. it was wood, the hole thing was wood. it's face was smooth, its hair if you call sticks hair was Sharp. It was wearing a dirty robe, I think with a hood. It raised one of its hands  to its head and scratched the smooth wood on its face off. I realize now it's fingers had wood carving tools in them. And on the other side as well. it's scratched a big smile on its face, standing perfectly still when doing it. it stared at me for long time, watching me struggle. and then it raise one of its fingers to me it dag under my skin on my face.

 think about it. the thing could've ripped off my face so easily but it took its time. 

This is how I die? I thought when screaming for my life.

And I realized I have a knife in my back pocket I grabbed it, I stabbed it in the things head did nothing. I Stabbed it in the face it did something it moved its head to the side and I seen a little Gap so i duged my fingers in, and ripped its face off. The screams of the creature was horrible it was a baby, man, woman everything! It let me go and i started running, I didn't stop for nothing. I reached the road and ran down it. a police car was driving to me. Officer got out and said "ma'am freeze!" One hand on his gun I didn't know why until I looked down, black blood I think. Thank God! He brought me to the police station. 
 
They took my clothes, hosed me down and put me in a waiting cell 

They brought me in for questioning. 
I was waiting. the room well lit not like the shows on TV 
The detective walked in, and sat down. 

He said what happened basically,
I told him everything.


You tested the blood out
Type A I think 
It was not human. animal they believe so 
They believe it was the isolation they put me in the same asylum.

They released me 

The reason why I'm talking about this now is because there's a urban legend called. the wood carver in the forest 

There's been missing people reports everywhere.
And wood carvings in the forest.

It was only in Texas... now it reached
Canada I'm telling you all this because right now outside of my house on my tree a wood carving is there.
