I was awakened from a deep sleep by the creaking sound of my room door. I live alone. Um, I must have been dreaming. I want to change position, but I can't move. What the hell! Come on! I'm running around the room with my eyes frantically, but I can't see anything. It's dark. Only a sliver of moonlight shines through the blinds. Someone's running towards my room! I hear heavy stomping. My heart is beating like crazy. I'm scared to death. I can't see anything. He has stopped somewhere in the area of the open door. I look at the door in a panic and see the darkness grow even darker.

Did someone break into my apartment? But why can't I move? God, I never believed in you, but if you exist, help me. I hear the heavy step again. I'm trying to see what is in the pitch-black darkness, but I can't see anything. Tears are squeezing from my eyes from the effort. I feel a bone-chilling cold. It's like someone turned on the air conditioner and put it right in front of my face. My body is shivering. Please make it stop. Within a second, the temperature in the room rose a few degrees, and I felt a pleasant warmth. I can move again and feel calm. A stone fell from my heart.

A few nights ago, I set up several cameras in the apartment because this strange situation repeats itself every night. I don't dare to look at the footage. I looked once and saw a tall figure in the hallway dressed in a trench coat and hat running toward my room. I turned off the footage out of horror and didn't dare to finish watching it. It repeats itself every night. I don't check the other cameras. I don't want to know what they captured.

I uploaded a video of a shadowy figure to Reddit. Some people were freaked out by it, and others laughed at it, saying it was fake. Then I got the message: "Address?" At first, I didn't understand, but then the man elaborated more, and I understood that he was an exorcist and would help me.

He's finally here, but he doesn't look at all like an exorcist. He's dressed in a biker jacket and jeans. "Hello." I greet him, but he won't even look at me. "Stay here." He walks towards my room. After a while, he returns. He walks past me and speaks one word. "Done." I have a strange feeling about this. I'll look at the footage. It doesn't matter what's on it now that it's gone.

I see him walk down the corridor and stop in front of my bedroom door. Everything has gone dark. The shadowy figure in the hat appeared in front of him. The exorcist opened his mouth, and his jaw stretched down to the level of his chest. His hands went black, and his fingers stretched out like long claws and encircled the shadowy figure. He swallowed the shadowy figure. In the end, he caught a glimpse of the camera. He smiled into it. Then he walked away.

I invited a monster into my house to get rid of another monster. I feel bad. I should feel relief, but it still doesn't come. I have a strong urge to look at the other footage. I'm panicked, scared, and terrified, but I need to know more. For God's sake!

According to the night vision camera, a creature came out of the wall. It had an enormous skull of a goat. The creature was wearing a cloak. It looked like the cloak was sewn together from bits of skin. I don't know why the skin pieces came to mind. I can't tell from the night vision footage what it is. But my gut is whispering to me.

With a screech, it opened the door to my room and bared razor-sharp fangs. A shadowy figure ran out of the hallway with a stomp and attacked the goat's skull. The monster with the goat skull disappeared. The shadowy figure watched me for a moment and then left.

Behind my back, the door is just opening with a creak. But this time, there is no one to save me. I've left my protector, the shadowy figure, to another monster.
