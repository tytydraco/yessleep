It has been a few weeks since I got myself locked in that basement with that thing. I was just picking some food when the door accidentally closed. It has no handle from the inside to stop that thing from getting to me.

I remember my shock when I realised that the door closed, trapping me with that thing. However I haven’t seen it for some months. Maybe it left.

I since started writing what happens in here, hoping that maybe I wouldn’t lose my sanity if I keep exercising my brain, however, it doesn’t seem to work. Unless a miracle happens, I don’t think I will be getting out of here sane. If I even get out of here.

………..

I’ve started to hear some strange sounds coming deep from the basement. I think soon I’ll need to venture there since the food supplies out here are starting to get rarer and rarer. There are a lot of miscellaneous here, and I think that out there, deeper into the basement I will find more food. I have food for 2 more days, and I have one more water bottle. Tomorrow I’ll go deeper.

………….

Today I went deeper, and to my disliking, I was right. There is more food. I can’t stay at the entrance forever, I need to remain deep. Because if I keep travelling that thing will be able to find me. The thing is pretty smart, it knows how to trick me, heck, I think it is playing with me right now, making me think that I’ve been undiscovered. It has gotten very close to me, I think it found me.

There is something weird about this basement. One thing is that there are different rooms of different styles here, in some rooms you can find a lot of good stuff, some even are very useful, like a flashlight. you cannot break anything that is part of the basement, not even the doors. And another weird thing about this basement is that at night, I wake up feeling like something is watching me.

Deep within this basement lay hidden chambers, their secrets shrouded in darkness. Forgotten signs and sentences on the walls, hinting at the basement’s enigmatic past. Strange symbols etched into the floor whispered of arcane rituals performed in ages past, their meaning lost to time. And beneath the cold stone lay passages leading to unknown depths, where horrors beyond imagination awaited discovery.

I really hate this basement and the thing that lurks within it. And I hate the voices coming closer and closer to me. That thing is good at impersonating people, or at least the thing that makes the noises. I even find writing on walls. Every sentence ends with a “(:”

Oh god, it found me. Anything else written on this log is not by m-

Yes it is (: I’m ok (:

If you find this house open the basement (:

There is no threat(:

The basement is lovely, nothing there to make is dangerous(:
