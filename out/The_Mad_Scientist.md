“He’s inside the building, you’re clear to enter” a familiar women’s voice says in my ear

“10-4 Kells” I say back turning to my partner   Ty who’s wearing a similar all black outfit fitted with gear even the military doesn’t have yet
And of-course the standard arrows on our shoulders.

Ty just looks and nods, he’s the silent type when on the clock something I’ve always respected about him, but we he starts to drink you’ll be damn sure you’re gonna have a good time

We storm the large abandoned warehouse with our custom m4’s carrying what some would call “cop killers”.

Clear I say as I walk into the main entrance, Ty just behind me, we see a long hallway with doors on either side, I signal Ty to go left as I go right, my room didn’t have much but seemed odd for a warehouse; the room seems like it’s being used as a nursery but all the kids toys are off; a bear with knifes for fingers, a cat that has something in its eyes not too sure what it is though, and a fire truck with a working water gun that shoots a little to hard.

Tys room was practically the same with similar weird toys that definitely aren’t meant for kids, we both give each-other weird looks as I report the findings to Kells.

“The first 2 rooms are nursery’s, with what looks like killer toys or something” I say into the earpiece, Kells replies saying “10-4 move forward but watch your back, they could be the anomaly”

As me and Ty pass probably about 6 other nursery’s all the same with different toys, we reach the last door at the end of the hall, Me and Ty prepare to breach when we hear movement just through the door, we glance at each other loading a chamber in each of our weapons and storming the door just to see a bigger nursery with what seems to be a workshop in the middle of it with a taller skinny man with mad scientist type hair turns around holding some type of necklace between his fingers.

He begins the laugh as Me and Ty yell at the same time “Drop the necklace and put your hands up”

The doctor looks amused and says “I’d worry about yourself first” with a laugh that only an insane person could make.

Just then the necklace started to glow a blood red as all the toys near us start jumping to life and storms past us to surround the man like a miniature army.

Ty looks at me trying to hide his confusion says “what’s the plan boss”

With a worried look I tell the mad man to put the necklace dow- but before I could finish my words a chit of water hits my bullet proof vest almost actually denting the material.

“Run” I yell as the toys start charging us, beaming down the hallway the entrance slams shut, me and Ty run into one of the now toy-less nursery slamming the door behind us; “What’s the move Kells, we need back up!” I yell

“On the way she replies, just hold on 10 minutes” me and Ty try our best to barricade the door but it’s clear the probably at least 50 killer toys will have little issue getting through, when a laser shoots through the door, looking through the small hole I see the stuffed cat from before as it shoots another laser cutting through the door, I step out of the way turning to Ty and yelling “shoot, shoot through the walls if need just kill these fuckers”

As we fire a hail of bullets through the door and walls we can hear some toys squeak as they drop, but it wasn’t enough about 35 toys still remain and we blew through our only cover.

They storm the room as we finish reloading are rifles, unloading even more shots, as stuffing and plastic flys everywhere I can see they are still coming, just then Ty drops to the floor as I see the bear finish slicing his
Heel, turning to try and safe my partner a baby doll starts crying this deafening screech that makes me have to drop my weapon and cover my ears, right then a hulk fist with a rocket on the back slams into my jaw sending me flying back and through the nursery wall; the last thing I saw before blacking out was Ty getting eaten by a feed me Cookie Monster with piranha like teeth, expecting it to be the last thing I ever see.

I came too about 15 minutes later, seeing toy parts and fire all over the warehouse, when I notice Kells is standing over me; “Thank god you’re okay she says” as I feel a sharp pain in my lower chest where a small laser hole is.
“Oh sorry Eli, we saw you fly through the wall of the warehouse right when we pulled up, so our team immediately stormed in using flamethrowers and catching the mad scientist, it seems something got one last shot off before so bu-“

I pass back out before she could finish her sentence, waking up a day later in a foundation hospital, when a man in a white coat enters the room saying, “oh good you’re awake” and some other small talk like telling me how sorry he is and that it’ll get better, but with this job it never gets better, apparently the necklace has some kind of mind control, once the man let it go he had no recollection of the past 2 weeks, but weather he’s lying or not doesn’t matter, he’ll end up wearing an orange jumpsuit anyway, who else would watch over the new scp.
