I am working with a part timer, correction, he works mostly in the daylight hours, I’ve worked with him before. Smells like the good old marry jane, the devil’s lettuce, you get it. Eyes are always bloodshot and constantly munching on something with that obnoxious loud chewing, and it’s the type of chewing that makes you want to use gorilla glue on their lips.

Daren was still out on his medical leave, my boss decided that I needed help, his name is Terry, also known as *Terrible*, to help me out on the overnight shift until Daren comes back. It’s only been a few hours into the shift, and already Terry has managed to spill coffee on the console and leave crumbs everywhere. 

I’m beginning to wonder if having him here is actually making my job harder. I can already tell this is going to be a long night. Every few minutes, I find myself cleaning up after him or double-checking the equipment to make sure nothing else has been damaged. The constant distractions are starting to wear on my nerves, and I’m counting down the hours until my shift ends.

It doesn’t seem to spook Terry with the oddities at night, either that, I don’t think he notices them, including mustache in the tip jar, in fact Terry had named the mustache, grabbed a permanent marker and wrote on the glass jar. 

He calls it “Reginald,” and now every time I pass by, I see that name staring back at me, and I can’t help cracking a smile. Terry treats the whole thing like a joke, cracking up at his own antics while I’m left wondering how this is suddenly my reality. The oddness of the night shift doesn’t faze him one bit; it almost seems like he thrives in chaos, unfazed by things that would make most people uneasy.

Sometimes, I catch him humming old cartoon theme songs under his breath, totally oblivious to the strange things that go bump in the night. It’s almost as if the weirdness of the graveyard shift is just background noise to him, something he barely registers while he goes about his routine. His carefree attitude makes me wonder if maybe I’m the one who’s a bit too wound tight about trying to survive the overnight shift every night. 

It’s almost like Terry is blessed with some kind of immunity—no matter how clueless or careless he seems, trouble just slides off him. Maybe he’s so oblivious to danger that the universe itself gives up trying to trip him up. Watching him breeze through the night, untouched by the chaos that seems to follow everyone else, I can’t help but marvel at how luck seems to favor the blissfully unaware.

It was unfair. I hate Terry. Daren gets injured on his first shift because he intervenes with the mustache possession, but Terry? The shadow that comes in for candy ended up playing tag with Terry who in his high induced brain thinks its hallucinations. 

While I scramble to keep the night running smoothly, Terry floats through it all like he’s in some weird sitcom. When the lights flicker or the shadows stretch a little too far, I tense up, but Terry just laughs, saying, “Did you see that cartoon dog run by?” as if the oddities are just characters in his personal show. 

It’s hard not to feel a little resentful watching him dodge every consequence with a grin, especially when I’m left shouldering the mess he leaves behind. But in some twisted way, his reckless ease almost makes the shift feel less threatening, like he’s not scared.

That was a change of pace I suppose but it only made it harder to do my job. That was until about 2:47 AM, the bell above the door dinged like it always does when someone walked in. A man walked in wearing a velvet cape, combat boots, and a Burger King crown, he brought in a brown paper bag with their logo on it.

He didn’t say a word, just strutted straight up to the counter, the cape flowing behind him like he was on some kind of grand parade. Terry, unfazed as ever, greeted him with a lazy salute and asked if he was royalty or just moonlighting as a magician. 

The man grinned, placed his bag on the counter, and tapped the crown like it was a secret signal. I glanced at Terry, who looked genuinely excited, as if this were just another episode in his midnight cartoon marathon. The whole scene felt surreal, but somehow, with Terry there, it seemed almost normal.

“I have a quest for you,” the man said in the Burger King crown. 

*oh no.*

He slid the bag forward, looking from me to Terry with an expectant gleam in his eye. “And this quest,” he continued, voice low and dramatic, “requires bravery, wit, and a taste for adventure.” 

Terry nearly bounced on his heels, clapping his hands together like a kid at a magic show, while I just stared, waiting for the punchline, because there was no way in any *normal* and logical situation anyone was going to do whatever this man asked. 

And here I thought Daren was an idiot. 

But Terry, took the cake, he was fueled by curiosity and maybe a little too much of the devil’s lettuce, leaned in and asked eagerly, “Is there a treasure map in there, or do we need to slay a dragon for a Whopper?” The man winked, handing Terry the bag with a flourish. I could already tell this was going to turn into one of those nights that would make us question reality even more than usual.

“Terry, this guy is messing with you, just kick him out if he isn’t going to buy anything.” I warned him.

But he ignored me, actually they both did. Terry fumbled with the bag, his eyes bright with anticipation. For a split second, I hoped it would just be a Whopper and fries, maybe with a bizarre coupon for “free magic tricks with purchase.” But, of course, nothing about tonight has been normal so far. Terry pulled out a crumpled scroll, tied with a shoelace, and a single plastic sword, the kind you get with a cocktail. 

The man in the crown cleared his throat, dramatically unfurling the scroll and announcing, “Your quest: deliver the King's message to the Oracle of the Mountain before sunrise, and return with the secret password.” Terry gasped, clearly ready to accept, while I just groaned, bracing myself for whatever came next.

“Terry if you leave this store, you won’t be coming back.” I warned again, it’s not like I can restrain him from leaving, he’s free to leave on his own free will.

But I guarantee he wouldn’t come back, I heard the stories before I got transferred to this shift, after David ghosted and didn’t show up for a week. On the day shift, my coworkers would say that people go missing on the overnight shift, I’d asked Mary that question before I was assigned this shift. 

Her words exactly were, *“sometimes people go missing for all sorts of time, whether they get kidnapped or decided to go further out towards the hiking trail across the street into the mountain, its not my job to keep track of them, I’m their boss not their babysitter. They have free will to do as they please.”* 

As Terry considered the challenge, I couldn’t help but notice the way the man watched us, his gaze lingering on every reaction as if he was taking notes for some invisible audience. The fluorescent lights flickered overhead, giving everything a weird, dreamlike glow  that always gave me a bad feeling. 

“Well, what do you say? Will you take up the challenge?” 

The mustache—Reginald slammed against his glass prison, as if it too was warning Terry to not fall for this obvious trick of whatever this weird person wanted Terry to do. 

Terry hesitated, gripping the plastic sword like it might actually protect him from whatever weirdness lay ahead. He glanced at me, searching for reassurance, but all I could offer was a tight shake of my head. The man’s grin only widened, and the silence stretched out. 

In that moment, it felt like the whole world had narrowed down to this shabby corner of a gas station, with reality itself balanced on the edge of a dare. Terry finally puffed out his chest and said, “Alright, let’s do it, let’s find this Oracle.” I sighed, already feeling the weight of regret settled in, but deep down, I knew there was no turning back now.

And just like that he left the store with the guy, the strange scroll and his cocktail sword in hand, disappearing into the neon-lit night as if swept away by a story only they could see. For a moment, I stood frozen, wondering if I’d ever see Terry again or if he’d become just another spooky overnight story.
 
“God Damnit, what am I supposed to tell Mary,” I looked over at Reginald in the tip jar, Reginald shrugged its bristling hair, mimicking the motion of shoulders in silent resignation. It seemed to know that whatever happened next was out of both our hands, and for a second, I almost wished I could ask it for advice. But then thought better of it, after all, it tried to possess  a customer and hurt Daren. “What you know, you’re just facial hair.” 

I sank down onto the battered stool behind the counter, my mind racing with scenarios I didn’t want to imagine. The hum of the refrigerator and the distant buzz of the highway outside were the only sounds left to anchor me to reality. I tried to remember the protocol for missing employees, was I supposed to call someone, or just wait?

 The silence started to press in, and every shadow seemed to stretch a little longer. Maybe, I thought, Terry would stroll back through the door in an hour, laughing about some prank, scroll forgotten in his back pocket. But with every minute that ticked by, that hope seemed to fade a little more.

I had mentioned there was an overnight shift manual, it was as thick as three Harry Potter books put together, it was a thick binder, with set of rules, protocols of all given situations. I pulled it out from the drawer underneath the register, on the front of the binder in big red letters: OVERNIGHT SHIFT RULES AND GUIDELINES. 

When I was forced into this shift, Mary briefly mentioned to me when I asked her what to do if something happens and she told me there was the overnight shift manual that it would help in *any* given situation. I thought what she said was weird at the time. But here we are. Now, with Terry gone, the idea of relying on a massive binder of rules doesn't seem quite so strange. Maybe Mary knew I'd eventually need it, that sooner or later something would happen that made its existence make sense.

I flipped the binder open, pages rustling with the weight of years spent documenting every unlikely scenario this place had ever thrown at the gas station. My finger traced down the table of contents, searching for anything about “missing employees” or “unusual disappearances.” 

There were sections on handling unruly customers, late-night emergencies, even dealing with supernatural incidents, a whole chapter devoted to the tip jar, which made me shudder, wait, is it the same tip jar Reginald is in or different one? *Focus Arlen* I told myself. But nothing that seemed to cover exactly what I was facing.

Finally, buried between protocols for “Extreme Weather” and “Inventory Shortages,” I found a heading: Staff Unaccounted For During Overnight Hours. The instructions were frustratingly vague: "Contact management if a team member is missing for more than two hours and complete Incident Form 7B. Ensure store security. 

Do not leave premises until you are relieved." I closed my eyes, trying to decide if it counted as an emergency yet or if I should just sit tight and hope for Terry’s return. The manual, for all its bulk, didn’t have answers for everything, it certainly didn’t tell you what to do when your coworker wandered off with a mysterious stranger and a possessed mustache watching from a glass jar.

Reginald was leering or was it pressing against the jar like it was trying to read the manual, “so I guess I wait for two hours?” I asked, like the mustache is going to answer me from the jar. 

One good thing is that I don’t have to clean up after Terry while I’m working, no more sticky soda rings on the counter or half-eaten snacks abandoned behind the register for me to find. It’s a small relief, but in the strange quiet that’s settled over the store, I’ll take any silver lining I can get.

Still, the minutes dragged. Every so often, I’d find myself glancing at the dusty clock above the snack aisle, counting down the time until I could actually do something other than sit and stew. My nerves prickled with every unexpected noise, the clatter of a dropped can in the stockroom, the whistle of wind sneaking under the front door, even the rhythmic tap of Reginald’s jar as he seemed to settle in for the long wait with me. I tried to distract myself by imagining what sort of “incident” would go on Form 7B, maybe “Employee abducted by eccentric Burger King guy, returned with questionable life advice.”

I wasted most of my time surfing the web a little, looking for news about a possible dead Terry body, there could be a possibility, after all, people go missing a lot on the hiking trail up that mountain across the street. I’ve heard horror stories like Wendigo, Skinwalkers, even Big Foot. 

About 4:30 AM rolled around, I decided to give Mary a call about Terry going missing with Burger King guy on some oracle quest with a tiny cocktail, but before I could, the store phone rang. And I stared at it, debating whether to answer it or not. There wasn’t a rule against picking up calls. But you never know about this gas station. 

Against my better judgement I answered it, “This is Arlen, what can I do for y—”

There was a loud gasp on the other end, sharp and frantic, like someone had just fallen or seen something terrifying. For a moment, all I could hear was heavy breathing, it sounded almost inhuman, raspy and desperate. I gripped the receiver tighter, heart pounding, uncertain if I should speak again or just listen.

My mind raced, every horror story I’d ever heard swirling together as I strained to make sense of the noises. Was it Terry? Did something attack him on that mountain? Or was it just another prank call, the kind that seemed designed to rattle whoever was unlucky enough to be on night duty in this place? 

The longer I listened, the more unsettling the breathing became like it echoed through the phone line from some place far colder and darker than the gas station’s flickering fluorescent lights.

And then, words began to come through, halting, broken syllables at first, like someone trying to force their voice through a wall of fear. “Arl—len,” the caller croaked, my name barely recognizable through the static and panic. “It’s—too late. Don’t—don’t let it in,” Each phrase came with a shudder, like the person on the other end was fighting just to get the sound out, and for a moment, I felt an icy chill crawl down my spine, settling in my bones. 

“Don’t let what in?” I stupidly asked, if I had half a brain I would have ended the call, but I didn’t. 

There was a long pause, just a static hissing, so loud it almost drowned out the frantic heartbeat in my ears. I could hear something else, too quiet and distant, like the scrape of fingernails against glass or a shuffling presence barely out of reach. The breathing faltered and resumed, every inhale sharper, every exhale carrying an undertone of dread that made me grip the phone even tighter than before.

I didn’t respond, I gripped the store phone in my sweaty palms as I listened intently, that I blocked everything out. Something about the warning felt personal, although this wasn’t the first time I’d gotten creepy calls like this. Usually, I tell them to screw off and hang up, but this one was different. 
“Please, listen—” their voice broke off. “—don’t let it in, it’ll devour your soul.” 

I swallowed, unable to force any words past the lump that was forming in my throat. The air seemed to thicken, each second stretching longer than the last, as the gravity of the warning pressed down on me. In that moment, the normal hum of the gas station faded away, replaced by the sense that something unseen was standing just outside, waiting for an invitation.

Suddenly, the uncanny tension snapped, the call cut off, the static vanished, and I was jarred back to reality by the unmistakable bang of energy drinks being slammed onto the counter. I blinked, startled, and looked up to see Tommi grinning at me, oblivious to the chilling conversation I’d just been part of. For a split second, I wondered if he’d noticed how pale I’d gotten, but his easy smile made it seem like just another late shift at the gas station.

I set the phone back down on the counter, “hey,” I said softly. 

Tommie furrowed his brows, “something wrong?” 

I shook my head, as I scanned the energy drinks. 

I forced a smile, trying to shake off the lingering dread from the call. “No, just tired,” I lied, hoping my voice sounded steadier than I felt. The fluorescent lights seemed harsher now, casting shadows that crawled along the walls and floor. Tommi shoved his hands into his pockets, glancing around as if searching for anything out of place. 

For a moment, I considered telling him about the call, about the warning, but something held me back, maybe fear, maybe the absurd hope that ignoring it would make it go away. Instead, I focused on the mundane comfort of routine, ringing up his drinks as if nothing had ever happened.

“A part timer followed a guy dressed in a Burger King crown and a red cape a few hours ago,” I rolled my eyes, “don’t know what to do about that.” 

Tommi snorted, shaking his head. “Only at this place, right?” He glanced back at the door, his posture stiffening just a bit, and I caught the flicker of unease in his eyes before he masked it with another grin. The ordinary weirdness of the night almost made the supernatural threat feel like just another story, almost, but not quite.

“You got a point,” I laughed it off. “Ever get the feeling your being watched?” I asked him. “That’s going to be $7.20.”

Tommi paused, fishing out his wallet and he handed me a crumpled ten-dollar bill and leaned a little closer, lowering his voice as if afraid the shadows themselves might overhear. 

“Honestly?” he said, glancing around with exaggerated suspicion. “If someone’s watching me, I hope they’re at least taking notes on how not to live your life.” He smirked.

I forced a grin. “Yeah, maybe they’ll make a documentary: ‘How Not to Survive the Night Shift.’ I’d watch it, just for the laughs.” trying to keep the mood light even as my eyes darted to the window, searching for movement outside. The world beyond the glass felt just a little too still, and I wondered if Tommi sensed it too—the way the night seemed to hold its breath, waiting for something to happen.

"It will be rated for mature audiences only," he said.

I snorted than I took his ten-dollar bill and cashed it out, and gave him the rest of his change back, he stacked on energy drink top of the other and grabbed the single one left. “don’t look too serious, Arlen, was the part timer a good worker or not?” 

He was terrible and I don’t know why he even worked here. The entire shift felt like babysitting, and I spent more time cleaning up after him than actually getting anything done. “Not really,” I replied. 

“There you go, no one will miss him.” Tommi said, shrugging. “You shouldn’t feel guilty about the stupidity of others.” And just like that Tommi left. 

His words stung a little, but I tried not to let it show. It was easier to accept his reasoning than to dwell on the unease gnawing at me, the sense that something bigger was unfolding just out of sight. 

After Tommi left, I hesitated for a moment before reaching for my phone. The dread lingered, but I knew I couldn’t keep it all to myself. I dialed Mary’s number and told her everything that happened with Terry. She listened quietly, then assured me that when she got in, she’d show me how to fill out the incident form. She sounded more annoyed than anything to fill out that form.

As I hung up the phone with Mary, my screen lit up with a new message from an unknown number. The text was brief, but it sent a chill down my spine: *“Be careful who you trust.”* I stared at the words, uncertainty gnawing at me and I suddenly wished Tommi hadn’t left so soon.

I’m going to have to change my number . . .
