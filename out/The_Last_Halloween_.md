Halloween used to be our favorite night of the year. But as we got older, the magic wore off. The thrill of trick-or-treating was a thing of the past, and haunted houses didn’t scare us like they used to. So, when Sam suggested we all meet at his place to “reclaim Halloween” last year, we mostly shrugged it off. We were seventeen, too old for all that, but hanging out sounded better than spending the night scrolling on our phones.

The four of us:Sam, Maya, Eli, and me, met up in Sam’s basement. We tossed around the idea of watching a horror movie marathon, maybe telling some ghost stories. But then Maya, grinning with a nervous kind of excitement, pulled out something she’d been hiding in her backpack: an old, battered Ouija board. This wasn’t the cheap plastic kind you get at the store. No, this was something ancient-looking, carved from dark wood, with letters and symbols scratched in by hand.

“Where’d you get that?” I asked, eyeing it warily.

Maya shrugged. “Antique shop near the edge of town. The owner tried to tell me not to buy it, said it had a ‘dark history’ or something” she said with a laugh. 

Sam chuckled. “Come on, we’re not kids anymore. A board game’s not going to scare us.”

We set the board down on the ground, and I felt a chill settle over me. The basement felt darker, colder, as though something had shifted the moment the board appeared. But not wanting to be the one who chickened out, I joined them around the table, placing my fingers on the heavy planchette. I could feel the weight of it, cold and strangely rough, pressing against my fingertips.

Maya took a deep breath, her voice barely a whisper. “Is anyone here with us?”

At first, nothing happened. We exchanged glances, half-smiling, trying to shake off the creeping sense of dread. But then, slowly, the planchette began to move, dragging our fingers along with it. It spelled out Y-E-S.

I tried to pull my hand away, but it felt stuck, as though something cold and invisible was pressing it to the board. The room grew colder, and a sour, stale smell filled the air, something rotten and damp that made me want to gag.

“What… who are you?” I managed to stammer, my voice barely audible.

The planchette moved again, spelling out F-R-I-E-N-D. The word seemed to mock us, each letter pressing into my mind, chilling me to the core. Eli tried to laugh it off, but his voice was shaky. “Just some prank. One of you guys is moving it,” he muttered, though he looked as terrified as I felt.

“What do you want?” Maya asked, her face pale, her fingers gripping the planchette so tightly her knuckles were white.

P-L-A-Y.

The air felt like it was pressing in on us, like something unseen was squeezing the life out of the room. I could feel my heart pounding, each beat sending another wave of panic through me, but I couldn’t pull away. And then, as though mocking us, the planchette spelled out one more word: S-T-A-Y.

I heard a faint noise, a low, almost animalistic growl coming from the dark corner of the basement. The shadows seemed to shift, stretching and twisting, and as I looked closer, I realized it wasn’t just a shadow. It was something huge, slowly forming out of the darkness.

The creature stepped into the candlelight, and I felt my stomach drop. It was towering, at least eight feet tall, shrouded in a tattered, hooded cloak that barely concealed its grotesque form. Beneath the hood, I could make out the twisted face of a ram, its horns spiraling out and curling around its head like a crown. The eyes were a deep, burning red, sunken into deep sockets, fixed on us with a hunger that made me want to run and never look back. The torso was disturbingly human, muscular and twisted, but from the waist down, it had the thick, furred legs of a goat, ending in massive, cloven hooves that clacked against the basement floor with every step.

Its rancid breath filled the room, the stench so foul I thought I would be sick. It grinned, showing sharp, yellowed teeth that looked like they could tear through bone.

“Stay,” it hissed, its voice a low, guttural growl that seemed to reverberate through my bones, locking me in place.

I wanted to scream, to run, but my body wouldn’t obey. The creature reached out, one massive, clawed hand closing around Sam’s neck, lifting him off the ground as if he weighed nothing. His face turned red, then purple, his eyes wide with terror as he clawed at the creature’s grip, his legs kicking uselessly. There was a sickening crack, and his body went limp. The creature dropped him to the floor, his lifeless eyes staring up at the ceiling.

I felt Maya’s hand tighten around mine, but she was frozen too, her face twisted in horror as the creature turned its gaze to her. Its rancid breath washed over us, and it whispered, “Play,” as the planchette also moved to spell the word. 

Before I could even think, it reached out, grabbing her by the arm and yanking her back into the darkness. Her scream echoed in the basement, a raw, desperate sound that was cut off too soon. And then she was gone.

Eli and I moved, our fingers finally breaking free from the planchette. We bolted up the stairs, our footsteps pounding, our breaths coming in gasps. But just as Eli reached for the door, he froze, his body twisting as if something had gripped him from behind. He let out a strangled scream, his face contorted in agony before he was pulled back down the stairs, disappearing into the darkness.

I didn’t stop. I tore through the door and into the night, running as fast as my legs would carry me. I didn’t look back until I was miles away, collapsing on the sidewalk, my chest heaving, my mind reeling.

I went to the police, tried to tell them what happened, but they just stared at me, their expressions skeptical. They questioned me like I was lying or losing my mind, asking if I’d been drinking, if maybe I’d imagined it all. I could see it in their eyes—they didn’t believe me. They never searched the house, never looked for Sam, Maya, or Eli. Instead, they told me to go home, to get some rest, to “let it go.”

But I can’t let it go. I can’t shake the feeling that the creature is still out there, waiting. This Halloween morning, I felt it watching me from the shadows, heard the faint clack of hooves on concrete, smelled that rancid breath that haunts my nightmares. I know it’s only a matter of time.

As I left my house this morning, on my front porch was the board. Expect this time, there were dark, reddish brown stains on the letter that spelled out each of my friends names. As I sit here and right this at work, I can feel it behind me. I look down the hallway and I see a shadow hide behind a corner. It’s waiting for me…
