First off, thank you all for the response to my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1d0l2dp/dont_shine_your_flashlight_into_the_woods_at_night/). This is the first time in the ten years I’ve been visiting my husband’s parents’ home that I’ve ever shared these stories with the public. It feels good to talk about the bizarre goings-on with more than just the few people in my inner circle. On the other hand, writing this out has brought to mind several incidents I haven’t considered in years, forcing me to realize just how out of the ordinary this neighborhood truly is. 

Second, Luna and I are fine. I went into the basement with her and watched a movie while she snoozed beside me on the couch, comfortable in the knowledge that we were both safe away from windows and doors. 

The basement of the house is huge; as I mentioned before, red carpeted stairs lead down to rooms that take up the same amount of space as the footprint of the house, if not more. To the right of the stairs there’s an entertaining space with games and movies piled under a massive mounted television and a big squishy sectional that we often joke induces narcolepsy. To the left is my father-in-law’s home office, which mainly consists of various camera equipment piled in haphazard heaps on and around his desk. Back behind the stairs a winding hallway leads to a bathroom, more storage, and eventually a door which opens into the backyard. 

It’s pretty nice for a space historically portrayed as creepy by most popular media. Although being down there by myself might have given me the heebie-jeebies once upon a time, I’ve long since ceased to be afraid of the basement, especially so after I learned the reason why Luna insists it’s the only safe place in the house. 

This was early on in my relationship with my husband, well before we were married or even engaged yet. I had visited the house a handful of times but was staying on my own for the first time while my husband’s parents were out of town and he was away on a work trip. Back then, there were only two or three rules on the list; the ones about Luna, nighttime travel, and feeding Gerald the toad (you would think the door locking one would have been among them, but I had to add that myself after a particularly hairy incident with an angry opossum). Point is, this story precedes any inkling I had that anything weird was going on beyond a quirky neighbor or two. 

I was in the kitchen making lunch when Luna began her appeal for me to go downstairs. This usually looks like whining, soft barks, nudging with her nose, and finally walking over to the basement door and staring disdainfully over one shoulder at you. I glanced out the bay windows and saw nothing but sunny skies, plus the water for my macaroni noodles had finally started to boil, so I ignored her. She waited a moment longer before loosing one weary sigh and trudging down the steps without me. 

No sooner had Luna made her exit than a sharp knock sounded from the front door. I jumped, spilling dry pasta all over the ground. Cursing, I swept the would-be lunch into a paper towel and hurried to the door as a second flurry of knocks echoed in the foyer. My fingers were inches away from turning the deadbolt when I stopped myself. Something in the back of my mind didn’t feel right about the situation; here I was alone on a Tuesday afternoon, my husband’s parents were gone and hadn’t told me to expect anyone, and my dog had hightailed it to the basement. So I looked through the peephole. 

He was, in all respects, a normal-looking guy, but something about him definitely seemed off; it was like he was so nondescript to the point that he didn’t even look real. The color was faded from every part of him, his eyes, his hair, the red baseball cap he wore. His clothes were clean and intact but clearly well-worn. I couldn’t tell exactly how old he was, maybe 30’s or 40’s. He stood eerily still as I studied him through the peep hole, never scratching an itch or turning at the sound of a passing car. When I looked down at his feet, he wasn’t wearing any shoes. 

At this point the alarm bells were ringing loud and clear in my mind. I backed away slowly from the door, trying to make as little noise as possible, when another thought hit me like a bag of bricks: why hadn’t any of the cameras alerted? The second this guy stepped onto the property, any of my father-in-law’s dozens of trail cams should have triggered an Alexa notification. With shaking hands, I pulled out my phone and tapped to see the live feed of the front door. 

There wasn’t anyone there. 

I stared at the screen in disbelief, thoughts crashing like tidal waves through my mind, the loudest of which being I should have gone into the basement with the dog when I had the chance. Even so, I wasn’t ready to let my fear get the best of me. Call it bravado or stupidity or just plain denial, I decided the camera system must be glitching and I was letting my imagination play tricks. This was just a normal guy at the door, and it was broad daylight. What was the harm in taking one more peek outside? 

I pressed my face to the peephole once more and immediately sprang back with a yelp. One colorless eye had stared right back. The stranger abandoned all pretense of normality then; who (or what) ever was outside began an all-out barrage of knocks on the front door, shaking the heavy oak in its frame. The banging thundered through the house, surrounding me on all sides, louder than a freight train and twice as frightening. 

I abandoned post, racing into the basement as fast as my legs would carry me. In near hysterics, I tried calling my husband, his parents, the neighbors, the police, but none of the calls would connect. Eventually I gave up and settled for sobbing into Luna’s short, silky fur as she alternated between comforting licks and low, warning growls. 

We didn’t come out of the basement until the next morning. The knocking faded away after what seemed like hours, but I was too scared to move and Luna wouldn’t leave my side. We huddled together on the couch all night, sleeping little. Eventually though, I could hear both our stomachs growl. My phone was also dead at that point, and had never managed to find service, even as I tried intermittently throughout the night. 

Luna and I crept cautiously up into the kitchen. Bright, warm sunlight spilled into the room, and I breathed deep, willing my body to relax. After I’d fed us both, I walked with her out onto the back porch. We saw it at the same time. 

Luna immediately raced down into the yard, barking her head off, while I stood frozen in the doorway, tears welling in my eyes and bile rising in my throat. There on the back gate, placed just so, hung a faded red cap. 

We stayed inside for the rest of the week, leaving only for Luna to use the bathroom (leashed and close to the house) and for me to accept food deliveries. My instructions were the same every time; text when here, leave at back door, DO NOT KNOCK. I watched the drivers come and go on the trail cams. 

By the time my husband and parents were back in town, I’d decided not to share the story with them. Nothing had really happened after all, and I had nothing to show as proof besides my stacks of takeout containers. There was no footage of the incident; it was like the guy never existed at all. 

Now you may be wondering about the red hat. I certainly hadn’t ventured far enough from the house to come close, and wouldn’t have touched it with a ten foot pole at that. Wouldn’t they see it? No is the answer, because the next time we braved the yard again it was gone. It was like he had left it just for me to see, for me to know he was there and could come back anytime he wanted, and once I got the message, he made sure no one would believe me if I told. So I never did. 

Fortunately, I haven’t come into contact with that particular entity since, although the sight of a red baseball cap still sends me into a panic. I took a brief hiatus from visiting the house after that one. But I missed my in-laws and the dog, and truth be told I missed the house and the land and the mystery of it even though it terrified me. I couldn’t stay away for long, and my fear of the red hat man was easily overshadowed by my love for the family home. 

That being said, these days I always stop what I am doing to join Luna in the basement; I know she has our best interests at heart, and besides, I’ve always hated answering the door for strangers.
