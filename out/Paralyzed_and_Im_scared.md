My hand is still sore from what happened, I have gone back and forth wondering if I should write this, my fingers tremble slightly as if shellshocked from what they experienced. But I know that this is something that I have to do, something I need to do, otherwise I don't know how I'll survive, how I'll cope, I need to feel seen, to feel heard, to voice out my fear and tell someone/anyone what I experienced only then can I close my eyes.

I am 25M and to better understand what I am about to tell you I feel that it would be best to start with some context, I am not very sure how long this post will be but I ask for your patience and understanding, I just need to talk about it. " It" started a few years ago, I was in highschool and in my senior year or as we call it here where I am from ( Form 4), it was a Sunday night and I remember that so specifically because at the time our school had a tradition, per fortnite we would have an entertainment weekend where on Saturdays we would watch the latest movies, usually a sci-fi film and then on Sundays we'd switch between an animated film during the day and a horror film at night.

On this specific night we had decided to watch the Nun, and for lovers of the horror genre you know the first instalment had us switching between the tv and our happy place, it was quite the experience. Anyway after the movie we retired to our dorms for the night, I wasn't particularly shaken as I enjoy horror movies and so I can take a few shots here and there, so I was pretty confident I'd get a good night's rest. The lights went out and the voices trailed off as we all slowly melted into our bank beds ready to embrace some much needed sleep.

Time passed by slowly as I delved deeper and deeper into sleep nothing felt wrong, nothing felt odd, it was going to be another normal night in highschool or so I thought. It started with a shortness of breath like I was scrambling for air, my eyes flattered open in panic, it was still dark and silent, my eye balls darted back and forth scanning the dark  room, everything seemed normal and in place but I could feel something was different. I tried to sit up but my body wouldn't budge, it was as if there was a miscommunication between my body and mind, my head was still against the pillow unmoving, nonchalant, only my eyes were free, what was happening? why couldn't I move?

I could feel my body getting hotter, my shirt getting wetter as I lay there in fear and confusion, from a far I could hear my roommate snoring, "please wake up!", "please someone wake me up!" I wished silently, and then as if answering my plea my finger twitched, then my toes, then my hand and leg, slowly I felt the pressure drift away as my motor functions resumed. I sat up quickly, heaving, trying to take in as much air as I could, sweat dripped from my face to my mouth, what on earth was that? Now at the time I was very religious so naturally I calmed down and whispered a prayer, that gave me a sense of relief. But I still couldn't bring myself to sleep a wink the rest of that night.

Over the next few days I was on edge, scared that whatever I had experienced would make a comeback but it never did. Overtime I chalked it up to just something weird that happened that I didn't need to think about. And I took comfort in that, until it happened again, this time I was back home during the holidays, a few months post incident, it was exactly the same, the temporary loss of motor functions and the sweating. Once I calmed myself I knew I had to get answers and what better way than everyone's favorite search engine Google. It was then that I discovered that "it" had a name, a face, "Sleep paralysis."

It was more common that I thought and I drew some comfort from this, I browsed through multiple articles learning more and more about this entity that plagued me, the more I understood "it" the more I came to terms with it. Over the next few years I'd experience sleep paralysis over and over again, sometimes once or twice a week to other times once  or twice a month, I gradually accepted it as part and parcel of my life and soon I gained the ability to control it. Lying on my bed I discovered that I could induce it, granted it took a few tries but I got the gist of it, this made me feel exhilarated and unique, like a super power that only a few possessed. Knowing that I could reign in this monster made it less frightening, a fact that I was grateful for. 

Fast forward to present day, I am now living alone in a medium sized bedsitter or studio apartment as they are otherwise known and last night something happened, something that was different and new and it shook me to the core, it started a week ago, I had just come from watching a marathon of "Rent a girlfriend" ( I still have some mixed feelings about this anime) anyway, it was 3 am and my eye lids were heavy, I switched off the tv and lights and practically passed out in my bed, I must have barely slept a few minutes when I woke up with a familiar startle, I couldn't move safe from my eyes, I panicked at first but this quickly melted away as it was at this point a usual experience, I lay there waiting for it to pass,  a bit frustrated that it was ruining a really good nap, it must've been after a minute or so that I realized something was terribly wrong!!

Usually my episodes would last a few seconds, a minute at the most, but this felt longer, my heartbeat began to race as I struggled to move what was going on?? I was starting to panic, millions of thoughts raced in my head then I heard it, all the voices immediately extinguished, did I just imagine it? am I hallucinating? It did not wait for me to overthink, I heard it again, a scratch coming from under my bed, again and again, I held my breath, my ears alert and my eyes wide, the scratching continued, it felt like something was tearing at the wooden frame of my bed, the sound became louder and louder as my heart followed the rhythm beating harder and harder and then my toe wiggled, then my finger, I leapt to my feet and headed straight for the switch, in my mind I only wanted one thing, light!

As the lights came on, I scanned the room terrified, my eyes searching for an anomaly, the room was silent, calm, undisturbed, the only sign of life was a small cockroach quickly gliding across the floor and into the refuge beneath my bed which was as you might have guessed empty. I was shaken but relieved, what had I just experienced?!! Later after I calmed down, I recalled that some people who had experienced sleep paralysis reported hearing weird sounds or seeing weird things, for example some reported that as they lay there unmoving, they could see weird shadows in the darkness, according to how they explained it, they saw the darkeness of their rooms slowly collect and morph into silhouettes of entities, sometimes human like or if their imaginations were wild, creatures of some sort, these beings would sometimes move around the room taunting them with their presence or at other times remain perfectly still, like statues, staring, glaring at them, as if asking for permission to move, to come closer.

This revelation seemed terrifying but at the same time comforting, it was at the very least not an unusual experience, but understandably I couldn't get any more sleep, so I navigated to my games folder and launched Bloodstrike and gamed for the remainder of the night. The next few days I was a wreck, I felt anxious and scared to fall asleep, it felt like I was back in the dorms all those years ago, but thankfully nothing happened, sleep came and went as usual and I slowly returned normalcy, "this was probably a one time thing," I hoped, but if it was I wouldn't be writing this.

Last night everything fell apart, I had just come back late from a really long and exhausting day, my muscles felt tense and worn out, my eyes were a deep red begging me to shut them just for a few minutes, once I made sure the door was locked and everything was in place I collapsed on my bed. I drifted into sleep immediately and it felt good, nothing like some deep sleep after a shitty day, but unfortunately this was short lived. I woke up in panic again, but this time the anxiety was different, more pronounced, it was as if my body sensed something was very wrong, I wanted to switch on the lights but my body was pinned to the bed.

"Again!" I thought angrily, why now of all times! My anger quickly melted away as I was filled with the unmistakable sense of dread, though I couldn't see them I felt hairs around my arms become alert, sweat started to trickle down my face fervently, this was NOT normal, and then I heard it, the scratching, my teeth gritted, my heart missed a beat, I was laying on my side facing the wall my back exposed to the emptiness of the room, I began to breath heavily, the scratching sounded louder than last time, more deliberate, more excited, it didn't sound like I was imagining it, it felt real, then I froze, my body clenched up and my eyes deepened, d...di.. did I just hear a growl?

I heard it again, a low deep growl, from my position it felt like the growl was directly under my right ear, our only boundary the mattress I lay on, I had never known terror but what I felt came close to it. The growling persisted every time followed up by scratching, if I thought things couldn't get any worse, they did! The growling seemed to trail off, not growing fainter as if fading but more like it had become mobile, it was moving!! I listened in terror as the growl slowly moved left away from my ear and into the openness of my room. My body was shaking at this point, I could hear my own breath labored and shaky.

Time immediately froze when I heard a loud thud, a few inches from my back, I felt the bed move a little in response to the force, whatever "it" was, was trying to come up, deep down I wished that I had slept facing the opposite side, atleast that way I could see what was happening, perhaps this would have made things less scary I hoped. My back felt drenched and cold, as if warning me that what was behind me was more terrifying than I could imagine. 

Helpless and mortified I listened as whatever "it" was made it's way from under my bed,  the growling was louder and continuous, rising higher and higher as if   the creature was slowly standing up, I pleaded with my body to move but it whispered back a "fuck off" as it remained perfectly still, and then I felt my bed sheet move slightly and almost immediately the growling stopped, I would have felt relieved had the sense of dread not gotten even more louder and alarming, the creature was still there and not just that, it was closer...

This quickly became evident when a warm gust of air blew past my left ear, a whimper escaped my mouth faster than I could stop it, the realization of what was happening made me wish I could pass out. The creature was right next to my ear, breathing, analyzing. I could feel it's cold and murderous stare, it was like a predator imagining all the best ways to devour its prey, I could feel that the bedsheet was at this point filled with sweat, was I about to die?? Then my leg jacked and as if on queue my body became lighter, all thoughts and fears faded and I was suddenly overcome with one clear and primal thought "survive"!! Like the Kenyan I am, I called upon my athletic ancestors, leaping from my bed not daring to look around, to face "it", not until the light was on and we could finally tell fact from fiction.

I tripped on a stool and tumbled, my hand hit the ground hard cushioning my fall, it sprained but I didn't care, my adrenaline served only one purpose, to slam the lights on and I did, the light immediately wiped across the room erasing all traces of the darkeness, finally I had the confidence, the grit to face my oppressor, but there was nothing there. The room was as it had always been, silent, calm, undisturbed. I felt relieved, I felt overjoyed as my legs gave way and I collapsed to the floor my adrenaline emptied out. Was all that just in my head? I was about to laugh at myself for being such an idiot when from the corner of my eye I saw it!!

It was a detail I had missed in my rush to spot the entity, a detail that lay in the open for all to see, full of malice and contempt. On the edge of my bed across the wooden frame just a few inches from where I slept were four unmistakable scratch marks, too long for a human hand to make and deep enough to pierce through the frame and break the fabric of my mattress, whatever I thought had happened, had in fact really happened!!!

I have spent the better part of today spiralling, I haven't eaten or gone out, my body is shaken to the core, I'm terrified and scared, I have tried to rationalize, to find some meaning as to what is going on, but I have no answers only fear. I live alone far from my home and close friends,  I don't know what I can do to escape this endless cycle of fear that seems to thrive on tormenting me, please I need help! As much as I want to avoid it , I'll have to sleep, even if not today tomorrow, and once I do all bets are off, if you made it to the end thank you, you are my witness, I feel comfort in knowing that someone out there knows my story and will at the very least remember.
