In simplest terms, inmate Christophe W. is the most valuable asset in the history of the Agency of Helping Hands. Without him, the agency’s ability to fulfill directives would be critically compromised.



Christophe frequently complains that “I'm the only one who does any fucking work around here.” While untrue, he is integral to the continued operation of the Agency. For this reason, Christophe enjoys unprecedented privileges.



Despite his long relationship with the organization, Christophe’s personal history prior to Agency involvement is unknown. Christophe has been markedly unhelpful in this regard. He deliberately lies about his past on a frequent basis, further complicating a full understanding of his psychological profile. 



This is unfortunate, because from a clinical standpoint Christophe is a complicated individual.



Christophe’s initial diagnosis was of sadistic psychopathy. Due to multiple factors —including active participation in treatment plans, extensive cooperation with agency directives, the unprompted undertaking of relationship-building with staff and other inmates, as well as an informed reevaluation and reexamination of the psychological impact of the first half of his incarceration at AHH-NASCU — Christophe’s diagnoses have been revised. These diagnoses now include behavior addiction disorder, substance abuse disorder, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, histrionic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, rejection sensitive dysphoria, and schizotypal personality disorder. 



Although Christophe continues to display sadistic behaviors, he has developed the ability to control them and now expresses them under sanctioned circumstances only. Due to his significant personal development and exceptional professional value, the Agency facilitates periodic expression of these behaviors as a reward for Christophe’s substantial ongoing contributions Ito the Agency. 



It should be noted that Christophe has repeatedly requested that the Agency retract permission for expression of his sadistic behaviors. The Agency has attempted to accommodate this request on prior occasions. However, suppression of the behaviors uniformly results in undesirable outcomes. Christophe’s most recent requests to disallow expression of the behaviors have therefore been denied.  



Please note that the majority of Christophe’s file, including the details surrounding his rewards, are classified at this time.



Christophe has made great improvements in terms of accountability and responsibility, but still struggles with using language that puts distance between himself and his past actions. This tendency actively impedes his treatment.



Christophe has been observed to display aggressive, intimidating, and sexualized behaviors toward individuals who cause him to feel threatened or inadequate. Some of his behavior toward female staff has been particularly disruptive. Steps have been taken to reduce these behaviors, but they remain a challenge for Christophe.



Another challenge faced by Christophe is his propensity for self-harm. He has been observed to hit himself, cut himself, stab himself, and starve himself.



The most disturbing self-harming behavior is his habit of extracting his own teeth, an action he takes after every sanctioned expression of sadistic behavior. 



It is important to note that Christophe’s teeth always grow back following extraction.



Christophe’s teeth are linked to his notable longevity. He ages physically only when there are no teeth in his mouth. As a result, Christophe has only aged approximately three years throughout his long tenure with the Agency of Helping Hands.



Christophe also suffers mild intermittent temporal lobe dementia that manifests approximately eight hours following teeth extraction. The symptoms no longer manifest once his teeth begin to regrow. 



Agency personnel believe Christophe has suffered significant trauma relating to religion, and wish to know more so as to more effectively treat him and support him.



Christophe is exceptionally cooperative, even going so far as to train and mentor other staff. The primary driver of this tractability (and therefore the foundation of his extreme value to the Agency of Helping Hands) is a desire for approval and admiration so profound that it borders on pathological. This clinically significant aspect of his nature is exploitable—and in fact, successful exploitation by Agency personnel has resulted in his long and mutually beneficial relationship with the organization.



Christophe responds especially well to verbal praise, and has been observed to exhibit camaraderie, protectiveness, and even instances of tenderness to individuals who consistently provide him with positive reinforcement. He particularly craves approval from individuals who exhibit traits and behaviors that he perceives as strong.



To ensure maximal cooperation, Christophe is assigned as a T-Class partner to Commander Rafael Wingaryde, AHH’s highest-ranking field agent.



**It MUST be noted that Christophe is NOT an appropriate partner for ANY female agent under ANY circumstances.**



Christophe is a Caucasian male approximately 40 - 45 years old. He has brown hair and hazel eyes. He stands approximately 6’6” tall with a powerful frame. Aside from his stature, his appearance is unremarkable. He demonstrates extreme care in dressing, grooming, and styling.



Christophe has consistently raised objections to the T-Class field uniform, requesting to exercise sole discretion over whether to wear it outside the facility. In an unusual move relative to their typical handling of Christophe, Administration has repeatedly denied this request.



Please note that Christophe is not subject to standard disciplinary protocol. All complaints, objections, and concerns pertaining to Christophe and his conduct automatically bypass the standard chain of command and go directly to Agency administration. 



Despite experiencing multiple significant challenges, Christophe continues to demonstrate substantial ongoing personal, emotional, and psychological growth, as well as consistent success in the accomplishment of directives assigned to him. The Agency is deeply grateful to Christophe for his work. Without him, operations at the Agency of Helping Hands would collapse. 



Christophe is objectively the best asset in the organization’s possession. It is therefore vital that AHH actively cultivates Christophe’s health, wellbeing, and above all his cooperation by any and all means necessary.

I have forgotten more than I will ever remember. I'm glad for this.



But you don’t care about what I’ve forgotten any more than I do. You care about what I remember.



I remember there was famine when I was young.



My mother went elsewhere with her new husband and their baby because she was pregnant again and we already had no food. They needed to find a place with work and food for their children.



They left me behind.



Her husband said I had to stay. The time had come for me to feed myself because I was nearly a man. What man, he asked me, would take food from a woman’s mouth?



I did not want to take food from a woman’s mouth. Not any woman, especially not my pregnant mother or my baby sister.



But that did not mean I was a man.



I have heard people say that the times were different back then. That everyone was grown and married and making babies and taking care of themselves by the age of thirteen or some shit such as that. Those people are wrong. I was thirteen years old when my mother left me behind.



And I was very much a child. 



I remember I couldn’t feed myself. I remember how my fingers swelled and turned purple after I dug in the frozen mud for roots. I remember killing a crippled rabbit, and weeping at the sight of its skinny body bleeding on the snow. I remember burying it instead of eating it.



I remember going to an abbey for help. I remember it was not good to be in the abbey with the priest, but it was better than frostbite and crippled rabbits even skinnier than I. 



I remember praying for my mother to come back for me, even though I knew she never would. Her husband said I was a man who must fend for himself, and she obeyed her husband in all things like a good Christian woman.



I remember growing up.



Most of all, I remember that I liked to use my teeth.



I don’t remember how it began. I’m glad. I don’t want to remember. I do remember finding girls and women no one cared about in places no one ever looked. 



I was small because I’d had so little to eat for too long, but I was pretty. I got that from my mother. I was also strong. I did not get that from her, though.  



When you are pretty, people do things to you. When you are pretty and strong, people let you do things to them. I wish I had not been pretty. I’m glad I am not pretty anymore.



I remember that I used my teeth many times.



Soon, people began to tell of a monstrous wolf with a taste for virgin’s blood. That was funny to me because none of the women were virgin. But for some reason, a wolf who eats virgins is much more scary than a wolf who eats nonvirgins.



The nuns knew and they hated me. They would not touch me except to beat me whenever one caught me with the priest. But the priest protected me as long as he could, not because he cared for me but because of guilt. He liked that I was pretty. He blamed himself for what I became. 



I remember knowing he deserved to blame himself.

 

Priests had power then that priests today do not. He used that power to shield me, to make the nuns and the brothers  lie about my activities and whereabouts. It was easier than it should have been because I chose women who were lesser. Whores, servants, madwomen, orphans, even witches. The priest especially approved of my witch-hunting. Witches were a very grave matter in those days. He did not like my methods, but he was a man of God, and men of God do not suffer witches to live.



I was good at finding women the world did not care about. My mistake was finding one the world did care about.



She told me she was a servant visiting the city with her mistress. This mistress was kind and had given her ladies an evening all for themselves. She told me we had the whole night. She told me I was far too pretty for a boy.



She told me I was far too strong for a boy.



She told me I was hurting her.



Then she told me nothing, because all she could do was scream.



Far too late — only after I used my teeth — did I learn that girl was no servant.



She was the daughter of a rich man and the wife of an even richer husband. She was expensive. Men do not like it when you ruin their expensive things. They dislike it so much that in the end, they like punishing the ruiner more than they ever even liked their ruined things.



That’s why I was found.



I remember the day the priest could not protect me anymore, when the lord’s men came cresting the green hills on their horses. I remember he shoved me out the door and screamed,



“Run, boy! *Run*!”



I ran.



I ran for days, but no matter how far or long I ran they kept coming. 



I was nearly caught on the fourth day. The man was small and weak, so he was easy to kill. But I could not kill him before he screamed, which drew the search party to me. I was exhausted, starving, terrified, less than any animal. 



So I did what animals do:



I ran into the forest.



Only I wasn’t an animal. Animals feed themselves, something I still could not do. I still could not find roots or kill rabbits. I did find water, but it made me sick. My fever ran so hot I burned my own hands when I touched my face, which was strange because I was so terribly cold. The colors in the world were too bright, and nothing held its shape. The trees stretched, rocks melted, and a deer spoke to me in the voice of my stepfather. It told me to hang myself. I thought people were behind me - the lord’s men, the nuns who beat me, the priest. 



When I saw the house, I didn’t think it was real. This is funny because of all the things I was seeing — the nuns, the priest, the melting rocks and the deformed trees and the deer that wanted me to die — the house was the *only* real thing.



It wasn’t full dark, but stars shone. Smoke came out of the chimney, and chickens milled about, plucking bugs from the grass. The last thing I remember is a chicken coming up and pecking my toe. The toenail was so dirty it must have looked like a bug to the chicken. That made me laugh.



That was the last thing I remember until I woke up.



“There you are,” a woman said.



A long, terrible moan followed her voice, low and inhuman. I thought it was the voice of a demon, which made me believe I was in Hell.



I sat up, screaming. Someone immediately pushed me back.



“Calm down. You’re safe.”



I tried to squirm away, but the speaker pinned me down. I hate being held down. I fought, but not well. I was too tired, too hungry, too weak.



“If you will calm yourself,” the speaker said sternly, “I will feed you.”



I think those were the only words that could have broken through my panic. 



The speaker was a woman. Small and dark, with a hard mouth and bright eyes. “Are you calm?”



Before I could answer, that hideous moan came again. I whipped around and saw —



“That is Anna, my daughter. Don’t be afraid. She is good and gentle.”



The sight of the thing in the corner made me recoil.



She was bony and ugly, with wide glassy eyes. She rocked back and forth and grabbed at the air, making that awful moan. I’d seen people like her in the church. The nuns took them in and cared for them, but the priest said they were abominations. Punishment from God himself for great sin. 



The bony girl turned to me. She didn’t seem to see me, but I felt she could sense me, which made me angry.



“What is wrong with her?” I asked.



“Nothing,” the woman said. 



I felt fear and anger. “She’s an abomination. Punishment for sin, hers or maybe yours.” Hearing the priest’s words in my voice made me even angrier.



“She is no such thing.” Her voice was still calm, but I caught the anger creeping in. I am good at hearing anger. “She is innocent and beautiful, more so than you or I will ever be.”



I had never seen anything less beautiful. “She’s weak. I would kill myself before I lived like her.”



“That makes you the weak one, boy.” The woman got onto her haunches so that we were at eye level. “You are a child. I don’t want to turn any child out of my home, but you must treat my daughter kindly. I am going to teach you politeness and respect, and Anna is going to teach you about different kinds of strength.” 



I would have argued, I wanted to stay in the warm cottage with the chimney and the toe-eating chickens. Learning to be kind to a girl — even a cursed one — was better than the abbey.



Over the following days, I learned much.



I learned Anna could not speak, but she could hear. The woman thought she was probably blind, but could not be sure. Anna liked to stroke the cat and hold chicken eggs. She was very gentle and never broke them. She did not like to hold the baby chickens, however.



Anna also had fevers that gave her terrible shakes. Her eyes rolled up in her head and she seized like one possessed, which made me surer than ever that she was how she was because of God’s punishment.



The woman took Anna outside every day to touch flowers and leaves, cats and chickens, rocks and the fence. As she folded Anna’s hands around each thing, she whispered its name until Anna responded as she knew how — which was, of course, her moan.



“Why do you do that?” I asked the woman.



“So she knows someone is always here to teach her.”



I watched them every day, wishing that Anna’s mother would lead me around the garden and place my hands on flowers and leaves and cats and rocks while she whispered their names. I already knew all the names, of course, but I wanted someone to want to teach me.



I learned to help in the garden. During a harvest, I discovered a special talent: I could smell mold and blight before it appeared. I helped the woman purge ruined vegetables before they could infect the whole crop. Blight had been a problem for a long time, but because of me it was no longer. We had much more food because of it.



But no matter how much food we had, Anna would not eat.



That was why she was so skinny, skinnier even than I had been when I couldn’t eat the rabbit. The woman always worried that Anna would starve.



Anna did not care about starving. She only cared about moaning and spitting her food out and flinging her hands. 



One night, she hit her mother so hard that the plate clattered across the floor. The woman burst into tears. It was the first time I had ever seen her cry. 



I hate crying. I hate people who cry. I hate myself when I cry.



But I didn’t hate the woman for crying.



Before my mother left me, she was sick. My baby sister made her sicker. The second baby made her sickest. Too sick to feed my sister or even herself. On those days, I fed both of them. It was not easy. Sick babies don’t like to eat. Neither do sick mothers. But I managed.



I brought my own plate over to Anna. “You have to eat.”



Anna moaned.



That was as much answer as I was going to get, so I spooned up the softest piece of carrot in my bowl and held it to her mouth.



Without hesitation, she ate it.



And then another, and another.



For the first time in many years, she ate a whole meal.



The woman cried again, but happily this time. “Thank you, Christophe. I’m glad she has a brother like you.”



Feeding Anna became my chore, just like sniffing the crops for blight and cutting firewood and cleaning the cottage before the patients came. 



The woman had many patients. She practiced medicine and midwifery. When patients came, she put Anna in a small, cozy room under the floor. She called it Anna’s nest. It was not because she was ashamed of Anna, but because the patients — especially the ones come to give birth — frightened Anna. It did not help that some thought Anna was a bad omen, the stress of which made their birthing harder.



It became my chore to take Anna down to her nest and sit with her during births. Sometimes I fed her. Sometimes I put her hands on her blankets and carved toys and told her their names while women overhead wailed. 



One night the woman asked me why a boy with such a fine nose and gentle hands had come to the woods in the first place.



I could never tell her. Even the idea of admitting what I had done made me want to die. “I’m not a boy, I’m a wolf. Wolves belong in the woods.”



“So they do,” she said.



I was happy there, feeding Anna and culling blighted vegetables and washing blood from the bedding.



Until the day a patient called her a witch.



That made me frightened and very angry.



“Why, Christophe?” the woman asked. “Why does this bother you?”



“Witches don’t go to heaven!”



“Neither do wolves, which means we are going to be stuck together in Hell just as we are stuck together in this house, so we must learn to get along.”



I admit, her argument impressed me.



She sighed. “I’m not a witch, but I might as well be. If you can’t accept that, then you must leave.”



I did not leave.



The number of chores slowly grew. I became an expert plant-hunter. One sniff from an herb in the cottage for reference, and I could find anything in the forest. I loved smelling the plants in her kitchen and the flowers in her garden. Orris was my favorite, which delighted her. She showed me a blend of orris, beeswax, and rose that she made herself. It was the most wonderful smell. I loved it so much she made one just for me.



That’s how these memories smell to me: Orris, wax, and roses. I wish it didn’t make me hurt to remember.



In time, the witch trusted me with her patients. I didn’t like that because some of her patients made me want to use my teeth again. At least the wanting was mild.



Even if it hadn’t been, I think the witch would have scared it out of me.



The witch was different in every way from my mother. She hurled insults, but only if they were funny. She never yelled at me and never hit me, but scared me if I deserved to be scared. She was not timid or quiet. She was not pretty. She was not a good Christian or an obedient woman. She respected nothing but the people who came to her for help. She did not back down for any reason, and she did not run from anything. I once watched her chase a bear away in stocking feet with a stick. She was so fierce the bear tripped over his own feet and screamed. I did not know bears could scream until that day.



And most unlike my mother, she did not care about men.



I didn’t like this, not a bit. “What about me?” I once asked.



“You are not a man.”



I bristled at her. “I’m not a boy.”



“Of course not. You are a wolf.”



I thought of my father, and I thought of my stepfather who left a child to starve in the snow. I thought of the priest who told me he could not help what he did because he is just a man and all men are fallen.



Those thoughts made me glad to be a wolf and not a man.



Even so, I knew what I had done made me a bad wolf. 



And bad wolves might as well be men.



I did not want to tell the witch what had been done to me. I did not want to tell her about my mother or my stepfather or the priest, but I would have told her all of it a thousand times over if it meant I did not ever have to tell how I liked to use my teeth.



I did not tell her, but somehow she found out anyway.



I was feeding Anna on the day she found out. 



The witch stomped over and slapped Anna’s bowl out of my hands. Anna moaned. For once her mother paid her no attention. She hauled me up and slammed me against the wall.



I have never seen anyone so angry. I have never seen a face that hated me so much.



For the first time since I killed the skinny rabbit in the snow, I wept.



“You’re no wolf. You’re not even a man. You’re a monster,” the witch screamed. “An abomination.”



She let go. I was too scared to stand so I fell, hiding my face in my hands so she would not see my tears.



She raged at me the whole night. She screamed herself into whispers, until blood flecked her lips.



Then finally, as dawn broke and Anna began to stir in her warm corner, the witch kneeled in front of me.



I barely understood that it was her, so scared and small as I was. I shrank away. And when she touched my face, I did not understand it was her at all. The deepest, truest part of me believed it was my mother preparing to hit me, or her husband, or the priest, or the nuns who beat me. It made me scream.



“Christophe,” she said, gently. “Christophe, I am sorry I scared you, but we must talk. I don’t know what will happen after talking. I cannot promise that you can stay. But I promise I will not scare you again.”



She pulled my hands from my face and rubbed them the way I had seen mothers in the church rub the hands of their crying children. No one had ever done that for me. No one had ever touched me except to take from me or to hurt me.



No one except her.



We talked.



And to my great relief, it turned out she knew very little.



If she had known everything, she would have made me leave. I know this. But she only knew about the expensive girl with the rich father and richer husband. I spoke as little as I could, which led her to her own assumptions. Each assumption was to my benefit. That is the way of mothers, I suppose.



At the end of our talk, she said, “I love you too much to make you leave. We’ll burn in Hell together, the wolf with too many teeth and the witch who is his mother.”



That is why she let me stay. That is why I remained Anna’s brother. That is why I continued to be a wolf, and not a man.



But there were new rules now. Since I was clearly no harmless boy, I had to do real work. I found this objectionable because I had been doing work, hadn’t I? Working her gardens until I had blisters, chopping wood until the blisters burst, cleaning until lye cracked my skin, feeding bony little Anna until she spat her food back into my face.



“Those are *chores*, Christophe, not work. Sit, and I will tell you about work. Do you know what they do to women they decide are witches?”



I did, all too well, but I let her tell me anyway.



I have already said that witches were a grave matter in those days. The things done to witches were even graver.



“If they ever come for me, you are to kill me before they can. Do you understand?”



“Yes,” I said.



“Do you promise?”



“Yes,” I said, because I knew it was a promise I would never have to keep.



Her patients knew to keep their mouths shut, but stories have a way of growing no matter what and there were rumors of a witch in the wood. Hunters sometimes came looking for her. For many years, the witch outsmarted and avoided them. But things had changed. After the famine especially, the hunters became even more ruthless. They blamed witches for all their misfortunes and believed that killing the witches would reverse the misfortune.



The witch was afraid for herself, but mostly for Anna. That, I learned, was the real reason she hid Anna from patients: Because the hunters would take Anna’s existence as proof of witchcraft, and kill her as brutally as they killed witches.



That was my work: To chase away the witch hunters, and kill them if need be.



I was very good at it.



So good that for the second time in my life, I heard rumors of a monstrous wolf. This wolf did not hunt virgins. 



This wolf hunted men.



I was an excellent hunter. I did not content myself with chasing my prey away. I killed them, especially when they ran. But that is something I have always done. Back when I lived in the abbey, I still used my teeth on the  girls who did not run, but I always let them go after. Just as long as they didn’t run.



But I did not let witch hunters go, even when they did not run. I should have. I know that now. Killing a few was good, to make people afraid. Killing so many is what ruined everything.



When I was not hunting hunters, I was helping patients. The witch thought it prudent to spread stories of her strapping young son. Men are kinder to women who have other men near them.



I liked helping almost as much as I liked hunting. My favorite way to help was to feed those too weak to feed themselves, and to lay beside the feverish when chills made them tremble. They always trembled less when I held them. Even the witch said I helped the fevers go down. 



While the witch was an excellent midwife, women and babies still died from time to time. Sometimes there were stillbirths, sometimes abortions and miscarriages.



I did not like helping with those because they made me think of my sick mother and baby sister. Looking at them was hard. Most of the time there was nothing, really. Even when there was something, it just looked like…well, a bit like the insides of a rabbit. But sometimes those things that looked like insides had tiny fingers, or even eyes. I hated the eyes. When I think of the word *abomination,* I think of those eyes. I used to wonder if that was what my soul looked like. Slick red masses with broken tiny fingers and knowing eyes.



Through it all, the witch hunters continued to come. So did the stories of the man-eating wolf. The patients spoke in fear, even when the witch pointed out that this wolf had never killed a woman. But the patients only said,



“Because the wolf is a witch’s familiar. She forces him to kill men.”



These rumors made me smile. Not a good smile. A savage one. But wolves are, after all, savage.



Many men had died by then — eight, I think — so a bounty was put on the wolf’s head.



I was not worried. None of the patients knew the witch as such, and none knew her gentle, well-mannered son for a wolf. Even if they had known, I would not have been afraid because I knew in my heart that she would protect me.



The bounty brought scores of new wolf hunters to join the witch hunters.



And then one night, one man hunting both got closer than anyone ever had.



I got rid of him, but carelessly. I thought he was alone, but I was wrong and I did not have time to dispose of his body before his brothers came upon his body.



I hid myself, but barely, and I watched them. They had weapons. The sight frightened me badly. 



But not as badly as what they said:



“The wolf belongs to the witch in the cottage! Catch it before it returns to her!”



I ran as I have never run.



When I burst into our cottage, screaming the alarm, screams were hurled right back at me —the witch was attending an emergency birth and it was going very wrong. The mother was whiter than white, so white she was yellow, and the baby was not moving.



“They’re coming!” I screamed. “The hunters are coming for us!”



“That’s your work, Christophe,” she told me.



“There are too many,” I said.



“That’s all right. I know you did your best. Now let me do my work.”



She put the baby in my arms and tended to the mother.



The baby was already blue. I looked at her and thought of my sister. I wondered if she was still alive. I wondered if the new baby was also alive, or if he was dead like the one in my arms. I did not feel sadness at these thoughts, but tears burned my eyes anyway.



The witch cursed in despair. Then she hurried over and opened the trapdoor to Anna’s nest. “Be quiet, Anna! You must be quiet, as quiet as the cat hunting mice in the night, until Christophe comes to fetch you.”



Anna did not even moan.



“Christophe,” said the witch.



I couldn’t look at her. I couldn’t look away from the baby.



She pried it away from me, gently, and placed it on its mother. Then she took my face in her hands. “Christophe, you know what they do to witches. Don’t let them. Remember your promise. You can tell them you caught me, you caught me in the act of killing this mother and her child, and killed me. That you chased off the familiar. Then you and Anna—



“No. No!”



“Please.” She began to sob. “You promised. I need you to take care of Anna. You have to. Please, Christophe, this is the only—”



And then the hunters smashed their way in.



They smashed my knee next, but that didn’t stop me from fighting. It took two men to hold me down.



The others turned their attention to the witch.



I knew what they were going to do.



It would be horrific. Inhumane. Cruelty beyond cruelty.



I knew it would be like all the times I have used my teeth.



As I watched them bear down on her, I thought: *They want to do what I have done. They are what I am.*



As they stood there laughing and preparing to destroy her, the witch gave me a look. No, not a look. An *order*.



A silent, desperate command.



Seeing that look on her face gave me a final charge of strength. I launched myself from my captors’ grip and landed on the floor beside her.



Then, weaponless and desperate, I tore my mother’s throat out with my teeth.



I remember cradling her, screaming in rage and loathing and grief. I remember the pain in my heart, heavy and rotten, burning.



I remember how she smiled at me.



That smile did not help.



I held her, sobbing and screaming, and I understood that every time I’d used my teeth, it had been on someone like her. Someone no one cared about. I was breaking, my thoughts were breaking as I sat there, weeping and holding her with her blood gushed through my fingers.



A hunter ran at me. I felt a knife, cold and hard in my chest, and I fell forward. I managed, just barely, to keep a blood-slick grip on the witch’s hand.



The world faded.



And then it exploded again into purest, cleanest light.



I stood within a soft golden sun under a gate of stars that opened to something impossibly beautiful: Heaven itself. Beside me the witch who was my mother, radiant and whole, was ascending with her hand in mine.



I wept for joy because I believed I we were ascending together. The wolf with too many teeth and the witch who was his mother, together in Heaven.



Until her hand slipped out of mine.



She kept ascending, but I stayed trapped on the ground.



I reached for her desperately, screaming for her, fingers tangling in her dress. I tore away the hem, which sparkled like a starry sky as it drifted down. When it fell across my screaming mouth, I heard the witch’s voice, gentle and sad:



“*Wolves with teeth can’t go to heaven.*”



The golden light went out.



I was back in the filthy, blood-soaked cottage, gasping wetly through deflating lungs. Something cold and sharp and heavy — another knife — went through me once, twice, three times. I felt hands on me, dragging me away.



And then I fell asleep.



I woke alone in the darkness, blood and rot sharp in my nose. 



I crawled along the floor, searching for my mother. I found her mangled body in the corner, broken and unrecognizable. I curled up beside her and slept again.



When morning came, she was still broken and dead, the same as the night before.



But as I held my hands up to the sunlight, I saw that I was not myself. Or perhaps, that I was finally, truly myself.



Wolfish and bony and feral. Inhuman. Like my outsides had finally been cursed to match my insides. I looked like the abomination I had always been at heart. The monstrous wolf.



Except for my mouth.



You see, where fangs should be, there was nothing. Nothing at all.



The big bad wolf had no teeth.



I laughed until I wept. Then I screamed because for the second time, my mother had left me behind. 



But when I heard Anna moaning in her nest, I remembered I was not the only one she left.



Even though I looked like a monster, Anna took my hand.



I fed her, then I buried our mother and cleaned the cottage and checked on the chickens. As I worked, crying but resolute, I felt myself change. It was slow but unmistakable: I was growing smaller again, less wolfish. Less monstrous. I still had no teeth, but otherwise I looked like myself.



I did not know if that made me glad or angry.



I didn’t have time to wonder because I had Anna to care for. I fed her and walked her out each day. I put her hands on the flowers and the eggs and the cat and told her their names. I sewed her clothes and sang her songs, and tucked her into bed and held her when the fevers made her shudder and throw up. I did all of this every day. I did all of it and more. I promised I would take care of her until I died.



She died first.



The fever came, and no matter what I did, no matter how I held her, it would not leave. Not until she died in my arms and grew cold while I screamed.



I remember that.



I thought I would die with her. That I would go to Heaven with her and our mother.



Instead, my teeth grew back. 



With my teeth grew the desire to use them.



I tried to fight it, but I am not strong. I have never been strong.



My teeth were not the only things that grew. I grew tall, then very tall. I grew strong, then very strong.



I did not grow more pretty. The pretty fell away like my teeth, but it didn’t grow back. I’m glad. I am glad to be strong and not pretty. When you’re pretty, people do things to you. When you’re strong, you do things to other people.



When you are very strong, you don’t have to wait for them to let you.



Don’t look at me like that.



Not like that.



Not you.

Christophe launched himself across the table.



I swung to the side so hard I fell out of my chair. He kept coming, taking a swipe that tore the back off the chair. I've never seen the look on his face. Never even imagined it. It short circuited my fear response and supercharged every survival instinct I had.



Among those instincts was the one that makes me who I am. The one that tells me how to make people talk. The one that told me — from the moment I met the screaming mess in front of me —to never, ever run from him.



I tried, futilely, to put him a restraint hold — a leftover instinct from my old job, one that did not serve me now. He threw me off and whipped around just as the door crashed open.



The right instinct came roaring back. I threw myself in between the intruder — not intruder, my boss Charlie, Dr. Wingaryde — and Christophe.



I felt sick. I wanted to throw up, I wanted to have a panic attack, I wanted to run.



But I didn’t dare.



*Don’t think about what he is, think about who he was. Think about the little boy who cried when he buried the rabbit.*

  


“Leave him alone, Charlie,” I said. “He’s good. He’s done. He did exactly what he was supposed to, so just —”



Dr. Wingaryde yanked me out of the room, slamming the door. Christophe smashed into it the second it latched. He pulled, shrieking every obscenity under the sun, but the auto-lock kept it in place. I couldn’t help but wonder what it was made of, given that even he wasn’t strong enough to break it.



“You did really well,” Dr. Wingaryde told me, practically glowing. “That’s exactly what we needed you to do. *Exactly*.”



The question spilled out of me before I could stop myself: “How many women has he killed?”



“That’s a conversation you can have with him, when and if—”



“*How many*?”



“This really isn’t for me to—”



I cut him off. Rudely. Kind of violently, even. Like seriously, I threw a big tantrum. Big enough that afterward, Dr. Wingaryde told me he’d have rather dealt with Christophe.



That’s easy for him to say, though.



I have a meeting with Commander Rafael Wingaryde in a couple of hours. He’s Charlie’s brother. Perhaps more relevantly, he’s Christophe’s field supervisor. Probably the only person in this facility with enough authority to make Christophe calm down. 



I don’t know what he’s going to say. I’m not even sure I want to know.



All I really know that for the first time since I got here, I just want to get the hell out.
