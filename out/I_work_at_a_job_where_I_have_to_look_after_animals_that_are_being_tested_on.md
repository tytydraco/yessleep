A few years ago I had a friend named Joan.  His father always told us that the place where he works has very unusual animals.  Both me and Joan liked what his father had to say, so we decided that when we grew up we would work there.

 A couple of years later, Joan's father died of bacterial meningitis.  There was a job opening for me, so Joan, who already works there, invited me too.  At that time, I had neither a husband nor children, but I had a job elsewhere.  I politely declined.

 I received a letter.

 A day after the call, I received a letter stating that I had been fired from my job.  I called Joan, but he didn't pick up.  I had to go to his house (I remembered the number of the house, he still lived in the same place as in childhood).  When I arrived at the place, the view of the house stunned me.  Everything was overgrown, there was grass everywhere, the windows were broken, and the house was skewed.  I somehow got up to the door and knocked on the door with peeling paint.
 
 Joan opened the door for me, looking tired and sickly.  When I asked what happened, he didn't answer and just took me to the house.  I began to tell him that I was fired from my job, to which he quietly said:

 "I know."

 I didn't remember the next few hours, maybe even days.  Joan injected me with something that made me black out for a while.  I woke up in the lab.  There were animals around, very ugly and scary.  Most simply mutated not for the best.  A pair of paws, a dozen eyes, an elongated body - all this caused horror and disgust.  But fortunately, I was closed from them by thick glass, which allowed me to observe everyone at once.  Thus began my work as a caretaker.

A couple of minutes later, Joan came to me and gave something through a hole in the glass.  It was some kind of a package.  It contained a slice of bread with cheese and a croissant.  Apparently, there is food here.  So I have to sit here for a long time.

 While I was observing the objects day and night, more than a few weeks, maybe months have passed.  Joan still came to see me regularly in the morning, afternoon and evening.  I tried to talk to him, asked if I would have a vacation and what unusual things I should see, but he was silent and sometimes winced at the sound of my voice.  Maybe he was tired too, working here seven days a week.

 One day I didn't see one of the mutants, and he was able to get out.  I did not immediately understand what was the matter and why the alarm went off.

 The animals were able to get out.

 All the workers ran around the laboratory and tried to catch the brutalized animals.  I also left because I was scared.  I started looking for a place to hide, or better yet, a way out of this Damn Lab.  I wandered for a long time, stumbled upon various kinds of cells and premises.  Very tired after such a journey, i lay down to rest somewhere on the floor in the corridor.

 I was awakened by the voice of Joan, who demanded that I get up.  I didn't understand why he called me a menace and a danger.  We were best friends with him, he always said how dear I am to him, and now he decided to take me and call me a danger, and even inject some garbage that caused me to pass out?!  Well no, that won't do.

 "You are dangerous. I must kill you."

He repeated these words all the time while running after me.  I couldn't stand it, I had to kill him.  I have never killed people, and I probably will not, but at that moment I was driven by pure aggression and anger.  I didn't understand why he did this to me.

 His blood trickled down my arms and he fell unconscious to the floor.  A small mirror fell out of his pocket.  I saw a glimpse of myself in the reflection.

 It was not me.

 An ugly monster was looking at me from the mirror, the same mutant as those who were in the cells.  It couldn't be me.  I have always been a beauty with blond hair and sky-colored eyes, a slender waist and slender legs.  I was scared to look at myself at that moment.

 I did not begin to believe in it, I decided to find out the truth.  My solution was to find the archive and look up information about myself.

 I didnâ€™t find myself in the archive with the employees, I had to dig through the documents with the objects.
 Oh, my.  God.
 I was there.  I was named "Object 2867-F."
 Admission date... It wasn't the day Joan injected me with something.  And not even later than that day.  It was the date "09/19/1980".  This year his father worked in the laboratory.  I could not understand anything, because this year I was not even born yet.  I started looking further.

 It wasn't there. 

I found records that I was told that I had the life of an ordinary person. It was an experiment on me.  My whole life has been just a fantasy.  We were never friends with Joan.  He was an ordinary worker.  But one day the system failed and the experiment was temporarily stopped. All this time I was sitting in the chamber, and not watching the animals...

 I am dangerous.  I must die...
