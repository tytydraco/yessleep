***Don’t ask me how I got my hands on this case, let’s say that some research took place and I ended up uncovering something which I still am not sure it is real. So here it is, the red forest case. The police report is as follows.***

Investigation Update: Virtual Reality Analysis  
Following the discovery of Mr. John Thompson's body and the seizure of the virtual reality equipment found at the scene, the devices were subjected to a comprehensive analysis by the forensic experts  
Findings:  
Upon examining the virtual reality headset and controllers, it was determined that nothing out of the ordinary was found within the system's hardware or software. However, a significant discovery was made within the virtual reality environment.  
A video recording was discovered, capturing moments of Mr. Thompson's experience while playing a game in the virtual reality environment. The game depicted a forest with red trees and red ground, creating a disorienting and unsettling atmosphere. Mr. Thompson appeared to be in a state of panic and distress. He was having a discussion with an unidentified distorted voice during the recorded session.  
The transcript of the conversation is as follows:  
  
Mr. Thompson: Oh God, what is happening? I can't take this anymore! I need to get out of here!  
Unidentified Voice: Oh, poor John. Can't handle the game, can you? Stuck in your little virtual prison.  
Mr. Thompson: I'm trying! But... but I can't move! I'm stuck! My body feels paralyzed, like I'm trapped. I can only move my fingers that control these damn controllers. Everything else...  
Unidentified Voice: (laughter) You thought you could escape? You're at my mercy now, John. There's no way out.  
Mr. Thompson: Shut up… This isn’t real, it’s not real… I need to find the way.  
Unidentified Voice: Reality, virtual or not, what's the difference? You're just a pawn in my game, John. You should have known better than to trust that link.  
Mr. Thompson: Fucking Tom. He sent me a link, said it was an exclusive experience, something thrilling and unique. I trusted him. I didn't expect this! Ooh God what have I done?  
Unidentified Voice: Ah, poor, naive John. Falling for Tom's little trap. You're just another fool who thought he could escape reality. But now, you're trapped in my twisted creation.  
Mr. Thompson: Please stop! There's no escape... I've searched every corner, every path. The forest, it's alive, watching me. I'm trapped. I don't know if I'll ever get out!  
Unidentified Voice: (laughter) That's right, John. Embrace the despair. There is no rescue, no salvation for you. You're mine forever.  
Mr. Thompson: Shut the fuck up! I can't think straight. My mind is playing tricks on me. Someone please help…  
Unidentified Voice: Help? Oh, John, there's no one who can help you now. Your pleas are futile. Your fate is sealed. Enjoy your eternal torment.  
\[Sound of distorted and eerie background noises\]  
Mr. Thompson: There's no way out... I'm lost. I’m done… Please no… no…  
\[Abrupt ending\]  
  
Conclusion:  
The virtual reality analysis revealed a significant piece of evidence in the form of a video recording capturing the conversation of Mr. Thompson's with an unknown individual. The recording indicated his panic and distress, as he expressed an inability to exit the game, which he had downloaded via a link provided by his colleague, Tom. Also the unidentified distorted voice that was speaking in a demeaning manner towards Mr. Thompson and was identified itself as the creator of the game.  
The investigation will now focus on identifying Tom and uncovering further details about the game's origins.
