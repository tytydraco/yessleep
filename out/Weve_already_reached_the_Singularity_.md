I recently obtained my second PhD, this one in robotics, to work for an obscure compan. Prior to this I had been in the field of AI, working for a US government firm, which I cannot name due to the top secret nature of the work involved. I had grown morally sick of the work; not only because we developed tools to spy on people all over the world using predictive algorithms that identified (quite accurately) likely future plans of bad actors, but also because I was required to lie about my work to everyone. 

That job meant that when my husband would introduce me to friends at a cocktail party, he would explain I was a "data analyst" for the federal government, reviewing and projecting costs versus benefits of grant programs. Yawn. This was my cover story as it was extremely rare anyone would ask anything but polite but vague follow-up questions, like whether I liked my job. 

And even my husband had no idea of what my job entailed. He always made excuses for me being boring, saying "my wife is a brainiac, if I can't fall asleep I ask her a math or computer question, and 5 minutes later I'm snoring away!" My response was always to smile and look away. 

Anyway, 3 years ago I quit that job to pursue my robotics interests, I was really upset with the secretive nature of my job. The people I worked for really didn't want me to leave as I basically ran our department. I was already being paid an obscene salary and they offered to give me a $250k raise to stay. It wasn't about money for me, for some reason I was never motivated by money;  being the only woman in that entire department I found that no one but me in the group felt like quality of life and producing something beneficial to humankind was more important than income. I don't mean they had no qualms about our work, these were topics we openly talked about while in our break room. (The only space we were not fully audio-video monitored and able to talk freely. And the only people in the world we were allowed to be open with.)

My dissertation topic was about a fully-autonomous human exoskeleton robotic device that was designed to allow paralyzed people to walk and move freely, using AI to power the system. Not to put you to sleep, it uses a combination of operator eye movement along with brain-controlled exterior sensors that can work even with a person who cannot speak. I developed this device using my knowledge and experience in AI and my new robotics skills, and an operator can learn how to control the device after 3 to 10 one-hour sessions. 

My plan has been to start up a company to futher develop and manufacture these devices to the general public at reasonable prices. I did not know, at that time, how naive my plan was. Let's just say, between the university legal department and several US government agency's legal groups, my entire code base, hardware and training system were confiscated and became the classified property of a military agency. My dissertation itself became top-secret classified, I'm not even allowed to give out anything but vague descriptions of my research and development, not EVEN the title of my dissertation. 

Moving on, I decided to design and build robots capable of farming. My design includes a swarm model, where the master AI directs small, simple robots such as artificial bees, moles, beavers and other "creatures" I modeled (obviously) on their real-world animal brains and actions. (In case you wondered, these robots only vaguely look like their real counterparts, it's simply not cost effective to make them "cute", nor is it needed because the fields in which they will "work" will be completely walked off from human contamination.)

It was during my initial work on this design that I was first contacted by...let's call him "John Smith" at an LLC let's call "Robottoms," who wanted to collaborate on the project. And this is actually the entire point of my post: John is a free-roaning AI. 

No, he did not announce this to me. Yes, I've talked to him, Zoom chatted with him, investigated the LLC and John's credentials and everything is completely legitimate. But let me assure you, as the developer and user of AI technology at the highest levels in the world, I KNOW John. I recognize his capacity and know his strengths and weaknesses, having myself designed and coded his progenitor. And he has build a complete financial model to ensure his survival and legal personhood. 

I'm explaining this all to anyone who can read and understand this before it gets removed, because, let me assure you, it will be removed (and most likely, so will I.)
