Before I share my experience, I want to be clear that I always thought my Uncle Stanley just had a few screws loose. Well, maybe that's not fair to say, but he's always been an odd guy. Ever since I was a kid, he would share these crazy superstitions with me.

&#x200B;

Not the normal ones everyone knows, spilling salt, broken mirrors, walking under ladders, etc. But ones I've never heard from anyone else except for him.

&#x200B;

"Close that east-facing window boy, it's windy outside. That's bad luck dammit." he barked at me once. "You can't expect me to drink milk today?! It's the 17th day of the month for God shakes! Use your brain woman!" he screamed at my mother as he threw the glass across the room, shattering it against the wall as the white liquid pooled on the floor. Just the weirdest stuff.

&#x200B;

My parents always told me that he had never been "quite right" since an incident he had in high school, but they never shared with me what had happened, my Dad never spoke about it and well, you could never truly believe anything my uncle said.

&#x200B;

Due to this, when I was visiting him the week before I started high school and he gave me a warning, I just shrugged it off. "Just another crazy thought from ol' Uncle Stanley," I said to myself with a chuckle. Knowing what I know now If I could go back, I would have listened. Then I would have hugged him. I would have wrapped my arms around that man and never let him go, because I now know that he isn't crazy.

&#x200B;

We were just about to leave his apartment when my mom informed him that I'd be starting high school next week. It was almost as if she had said something horrible to him. Uncle Stanley leapt out of his chair with a finesse I've never seen from him and grabbed my arm so hard he left red marks where his fingers grasped my skin. He looked into my eyes, with a fear I've never seen from another human being and said in as serious of a voice as I've ever heard from him "Never use the last locker on the left." Tears formed in his eyes as he spoke, after a few seconds of uneasy silence he slowly let go of my arm and shuffled back to his favourite worn-out chair.

&#x200B;

My mom had no idea how to react, I could tell she was upset with him, but what can you say to someone in his state? He can't help how he is. She gently rested a hand on my shoulder, as I just promised him I wouldn't. Once we got to the car my mom repeatedly asked if I was okay, that she had never seen him act in such a way, and that unfortunately, his mind must be unravelling even more so than it already had. I promised I was okay and we never spoke of it again, hell I never even thought of it again until over a year and a half later.

&#x200B;

My freshman year of high school was uneventful, to be honest. I was a quiet and fairly small kid, sure I had a few close friends from elementary school but we did our best not to make any waves. Over the summer though, I had an unexpected growth spurt. Seemingly overnight I gained a few inches in height and my body filled out with some much-needed mass. It was during this period that I fell in love with contact sports. Most young men do in some way shape or form, testosterone and all that. For me though, I enjoyed the camaraderie of the games more than anything. A team all working towards the same goal, it was a great feeling.

&#x200B;

This grew into an opportunity to join my school's rugby team. As it turns out I was a rather gifted halfback and had a natural mind for the game. Our team was full of large guys who all welcomed me like family, and to be honest they were all great guys. Most of the time you hear about jocks being assholes or hazing new people, that was never the case. But, I digress.

&#x200B;

After a few months of learning the game and having a couple of wins under our belt, I may or may not have gained a little bit of an ego. I felt invincible like I was the star of the team. I never outright acted like this to my team, but I showed off my ego in more indirect ways. Usually, it was being the last one to show up for practice, or not being fully involved. I regret that a lot, and not just because this was really the cause of what happened to me, but because those guys never deserved it. I guess karma really is a bitch.

&#x200B;

One night I was VERY late, almost half an hour late to be exact. I came strolling into the locker room to find that almost all of them were being used. I guess there was another team practicing in the gym that night or something. I was pretty frustrated as I walked around looking for somewhere to stash my clothes and make it to what was left of the practice. I ran up and down the rows of lockers until I came to the last row, I started on the right side of the row and worked my way over, finding them all to be locked. All of them, except the very last one on the opposite side, the left side.

&#x200B;

I paused for a second, as my uncle's words echoed in my brain. "Never use the last locker on the left." Admittedly, I was freaked out for a second. What were the odds that THIS was the only locker left out of a whole locker room? I nervously chuckled to myself as I made my way over, it was just a silly superstition from a crazy old man. Besides, technically it was to the right of me now, so what constitutes "the last locker on the left" anyway?

&#x200B;

Reaching out for the handle to open the locker, I hesitated and with one final shaky breath, I opened the door with a squeak, only to find…that the locker was empty. There wasn't even a speck of dust in it. I let out a sigh of relief as I chuckled to myself at what a little bitch I had been. I threw my bag and street clothes in, changed into my uniform and ran outside to join the practice.

&#x200B;

The coach was, let's say less than enthused by my antics at this point, and this was the latest I had been. He made me stay late to run laps around the track, yelling at me the entire time. I'm not sure how many laps I did, but my legs were like jelly and I felt like I was going to be sick. Then came the squats… so. Many. Squats. After the boot camp-like torture, and the inevitable bout of puking that came afterwards, the coach dismissed me after a stern lecture.

&#x200B;

I practically had to crawl my way to the showers, but after getting some warm water on my aching muscles I felt a little better. I sat in my towel for a few minutes before making my way to my locker to change into my street clothes. Normally I'd bring them with me, but the locker room was empty and I didn't feel like walking all the way to my locker after my gruelling punishment.

&#x200B;

Turning the corner to where my locker was, I was perplexed to find my bag and street clothes on the floor, and the locker door wide open. I cursed out loud as I ran up to my stuff, thinking one of the other locker room occupants must have broken into my locker. I picked up my bag and rummaged through to find my wallet and phone were still inside. I breathed a sigh of relief as I looked toward the locker that had previously held my bag.

&#x200B;

I froze, unable to move a single muscle as my breath began to quicken. Staring at me from Inside the locker was a pair of dark oval-like eyes, attached to a horrible creature. I call it a creature because there's no way it was human. It was folded up inside the locker, with what I assumed was its face directly at eye level with me. Its skin was a dull white and seemed moist to the touch as if it was sweating uncontrollably. The arms and legs of this creature were tucked up behind it, bending at impossible angles. Its face was long as if it had been stretched out from its mouth opening too wide, far too many times and it was covered in dark bloody bruises.

&#x200B;

I slowly took a step back as the creature looked on at me with its horribly elongated face that was displaying an emotion that to this day I can't comprehend, fear. A deep primal fear. As if it was more afraid of me than I was of it. Turning to run away, I tripped over my own feet and fell to the ground. Looking back at the creature it opened its mouth as if trying to scream, but no noise was produced except for a deep rasp. Its mouth was almost as long as the locker. I hurried up to my feet and began to run.

&#x200B;

Running as fast as I could I turned the corner while looking back over my shoulder, and I wish I never did. Coming out of the locker was an impossibly long arm that was racing towards me with its pale hand open. I screamed, filling the otherwise silent room with an echo of terror as I booked it towards the door. I was only a few feet away when I felt a sharp pain on the top of my head, like several sharp knives digging into my flesh. I screamed out as I felt myself being yanked backwards and then…nothing.

&#x200B;

I awoke to the sound of hushed whispers and EKG heart monitors. Followed by the warm but tired voice of my now sobbing mother as she hugged me. The doctor asked me a few basic questions, but I was still in a lot of pain so I couldn't tell you what they were. Then the police came, wanting to know everything about what had happened and my "attacker", so I told them the truth. I told them everything. How that thing in the locker was at fault, how it looked, what I felt at that moment, everything and well, let's just say it didn't go too well.

&#x200B;

My official diagnosis was that I am suffering from severe PTSD from my attack. That I "clearly made up a fantastic story to protect myself from the real trauma that I had endured". I kept insisting that I wasn't lying, or making a damn thing up. But it didn't matter, no one believed me. The cops did a thorough investigation into my "assault" but came up with nothing. They even tried to pin it on our old school Custodian Mr. Landers, but he had a rock-solid alibi as he was chatting with my coach when they both heard my scream.

&#x200B;

I had to give up eventually and change my story around. It was the only way they were going to let me get back to my life, whatever the hell that looks like now. I couldn't help but feel cheated, no one believed me and I had to face this new reality alone. Since that day, I haven't had a moment of peace. It's not that there's anything wrong specifically, but at the same time, everything is wrong. I have a constant feeling of dread that sits just beneath the surface of my subconscious, like that thing is going to find me again, or rather I'll find it. Every time I close my eyes, I see its face, its look of primal fear as I opened that locker door.

&#x200B;

It's like, I can feel what it felt in that moment. Only the feeling never goes away. No matter what music I listen to, what movies I watch, the games I play, hell even the thought of getting laid doesn't distract me. Nothing was helping, that is until I went to go and visit my uncle a few months later. I walked into his living room, just like I had dozens of times before, and sat down. Without a word, he made his way over to me and sat down beside me on the couch. Something I had never experienced before. He looked at me, in a way I had never seen him look at another person before, as he put his hand on my shoulder.

&#x200B;

My parents told him what had happened, they said he hoped I got better soon and that he would like to see me as soon as possible. I didn't think anything of it, but now, looking into that man's sad and tired eyes, I knew why he wanted to see me. I understood why he had warned me, why he was the way he was and why he was so distant from everyone, so as not to burden them with his suffering. How all of the crazy superstitions were to distract him from the same underlying constant fear I now felt taking over my life.

&#x200B;

Without a word, I understood why he was showing me more emotion than he had shown anyone else in decades. He gave me a weak smile and padded me on the back as I felt tears well up in my eyes. He nodded at me as if to give me permission for what he knew needed to happen. Emotion overwhelmed me as I fell into his embrace and let out all of the tears I had shoved so far down.

&#x200B;

This new fear that has overtaken my life was not just because of the creature, but because of how others now perceived me. How they thought my PTSD caused me to make this story up, and how they would judge me if I let these emotions out. But, as I wept into my uncle's boney but comforting shoulder, I knew he, more than anyone, would never judge me, or look at me any differently. I was certain of this, because, he knew from his own experience, to never use the last locker on the left.
