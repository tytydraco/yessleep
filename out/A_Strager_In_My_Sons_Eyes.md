I should have never ignored the **warnings** about this house.

Hi, I am **Matt**, a **28-year-old single father** to my son, **Ethan**, who is **8 years old**. He was an **unplanned child**, and because of this, his mother **gave him to me** and left our lives. From then on, I have tried to be the **best father** I could be for Ethan.

I work as a **waiter** in a restaurant for **minimum wage**, which makes it **extremely difficult** for me to earn enough money for both of us.

We lived in a **rented house**, but day by day, our **landlord** made it **impossible** to live peacefully. He would **increase the rent** without notice and **blame me** for damages in the house, even though they were there **before** we moved in. So, when I heard that a house was for sale at a **very cheap price**, I knew it was our **ticket out** of this hellhole. But I **couldn’t have been more wrong**.

When I went to check the house with the **dealer**, the **neighbors** were all **whispering**, and even the dealer looked **nervous**. I asked him if there was any **problem** with the house, and he told me that the last person who lived there had been **arrested** for some **serious crimes**.

I didn’t **inquire further** and said, **“Who cares about the previous owner?”** I **sealed the deal** and bought the house. The **first few days** were nice—Ethan got his **own room** and was **overjoyed**. But one thing I noticed was that whenever I tried to **talk to my neighbors**, they would **rush into their homes**, making up **excuses** to avoid conversation. I **brushed it off** as them just being **rude**.

The dealer had told me something **extremely serious** while selling the house. He warned me that there was a **basement**, but I should **NEVER** go there—nor should my son. His face looked **extremely serious**, so I **obeyed** him without asking questions. I **told my son never to go into the basement**. I saw **rebellion** on his face, but he **promised** me he **wouldn’t go there**.

Then came **the day**. It was a **Saturday night**, and the restaurant was **extremely busy**. I told my son that it would take me **some time** to get home and that he should **eat dinner** without me and **go to sleep**.

I **returned home** from my shift, **exhausted**. I went into his **room** and saw that he **wasn’t there**. **Panic** rushed over me as I started **screaming** his name and **searching** throughout the house. That’s when I saw him **coming up from the basement**. He looked at me with a **devilish smile** and **blank eyes** and told me there was **nothing** in the basement. I knew something was **wrong** just by looking at his **face**, but I didn’t **push it**. I simply **told him** to go to his room and **sleep**.

I was **not in the mood to eat**. I went to my **room** and **plummeted onto my bed**. I couldn’t shake his **expression** from my mind—he looked **evil**. And even though I don’t want to **admit it**, I was **scared of my own son**.

The next day, I started **noticing changes** in his behavior. He didn’t **eat breakfast**, even though I kept **insisting**. Then, **out of nowhere**, he **shouted** at me to **mind my own business**. I didn’t **say anything** to him after that.

It was my **day off**, and every **Sunday**, we used to **go to the park together**. But today, he **didn’t ask me** to take him. **Images** of him from the **previous night** flashed through my mind. I **tried** to brush them off, but I **couldn’t**.

I decided to **check on him**, but once again, he **wasn’t in his room**. This time, I **didn’t call his name**. I slowly walked towards the **basement** and saw that the **door was open**. I **peeked inside**, and there he was—my **son**—**crouching** and **eating something off the floor**. It was **really dark**, making it **difficult** for my **eyes to adjust**. But then I saw it.

There was a **dead body** on the floor.

And he was **eating it**.

A **gasp escaped** from my mouth, and I quickly **covered it**, but it was **too late**.

His **head turned 180 degrees**. He saw me, **smiled**, and said, **“You saw everything, Dad. You must go now!!”**

He **screamed in anger** and **leapt towards me**. I **tried to reason** with him, but he **wouldn’t budge**. He **bit my arm**—**hard**. I **screamed** as **blood poured** from the wound. Gathering my **strength**, I **kicked him hard enough** that he **flew back** into the **basement**. I **quickly slammed the door shut** and **locked it from the outside**, buying myself some **time**.

I knew I couldn’t **run to the main door**—it was **too far**, and he was **too fast**. He would **catch up to me** quickly. So, I **ran to my room** instead. There was **one thing** I **hadn’t told my son** about this house—a **secret ladder** that led to the **attic**, accessible from my **room**. I **pulled it open**, **climbed up**, and **pulled the ladder back up**. That’s when I heard a **loud crash**—he had **broken down the basement door** and was **searching for me**.

Desperate for **answers**, I **searched** for the **history of this house**. What I found **shocked me**.

The previous owner’s name was **Mark**. He was a **serial killer** who **seduced women**, brought them to his house, **killed them**, and **ate them**. One **woman managed to escape** and **reported him** to the **police**. They came and **arrested him**, but as they were taking him to the **car**, he **ran back into the basement** and **killed himself** with a **knife**.

Now, I am **certain**—Mark has **possessed my son**.

I know I **can’t hide here much longer**. This was **his house**—he **knows** about the **attic**. So now, I am here, **typing this post**, **begging for help**. I **can’t call anyone**—the **noise** would **give away my position**.

**Someone, please save me before he finds me.**
