Journal of Frater XII of the Esoteric Order of the Other

October 22nd, 1993 - Santa Fe, NM

The Woolworth's lunch counter in Santa Fe. A bastion of normalcy amidst the swirling chaos I've been subjected to. Or so one would hope. I took up a booth with a clear view of the entrance, ostensibly to observe any… fluctuations. Truthfully, it was to maintain an edge against the gnawing anxiety that had taken root since Siouxsie's (Like "And The Banshees", apparently. I been spelling it "Suzie" this entire time) frantic call to my show and her equally urgent followups on random payphones. I was still bewildered at how she managed to catch me when I was near them.

I nursed a lukewarm coffee, the taste not entirely dissimilar to burnt plastic, and observed the midday crowd. Tourists mostly, decked out in ludicrous amounts of turquoise. The kind that make locals roll their eyes. Then, my gaze landed on a figure hunched over a mountain of waffles and a truly alarming quantity of crisp bacon. Small frame, completely swallowed by an oversized black hoodie. One might have mistaken it for a child, demolishing a breakfast that would give even the most ardent lumberjack pause.

I waited. Siouxsie was due any minute. This… child, though, was certainly making a statement. The way the tiny, fabric-covered hands expertly maneuvered a forkful of syrup-drenched waffle into the unseen maw beneath the hood was almost hypnotic. I found myself wondering if this was some new, remarkably efficient method of resource depletion I hadn't encountered. Perhaps a juvenile cryptid with an insatiable sweet tooth? The sheer volume was… noteworthy.

A cough broke my reverie. A tall woman with tired eyes and a no-nonsense aura stood beside the booth. Dr. Eliza Vance. I straightened, a mild surprise flickering behind my spectacles. Before I could formulate a greeting, a small, fabric-draped hand tugged at Vance’s sleeve. The hooded figure from the counter.

“Count Jim?” a muffled voice emanated from beneath the black fabric. “Took you long enough. Though you’re be easy to spot in your getup.”

My gaze narrowed. The voice was undeniably Siouxsie’s, albeit slightly distorted by the layers of fabric. I confess, a flicker of… bewilderment crossed my stoic facade. “Siouxsie?” I inquired, my voice measured.

This was a turn. I was half expecting Vance to be this mysterious nerve-wracked voice on the phone that's been haunting me. Not this... munchkin.

The hoodie bobbed. “Surprise! Turns out, hitchhiking with a former NAORC scientist is faster than waiting for you to drive all the way from Sisterfuckersville.”

Former NAORC scientist. Things just keep getting better.

Vance offered a wry smile. “It's a long drive from Thurber, Siouxsie. Though I admit, the full ‘Count Jim’ regalia is… striking in broad daylight.”

“Right?” the muffled voice agreed. “Like he just stepped off the set of some low-budget vampire Western. You only wear that for the show, right? Please tell me you don’t grocery shop like this.”

My hand instinctively went to the brim of my hat. “Hey, my outfit is stylish and… functional. And it serves as a… recognizable symbol.”

Siouxsie snorted, a surprisingly loud sound considering her size. “Yeah, a symbol of ‘please ask me about my cable access show.’”

“Alright, you two,” Vance interjected, a hint of amusement in her tone. “Let’s focus. We have a lot to discuss.” She slid into the booth opposite me, and with a final, triumphant scrape of a fork against ceramic, Siouxsie, still shrouded in the hoodie, settled beside her.

Vance leaned forward, her expression serious. “Siouxsie is a good acquaintence of mine. She figured you could use my help. I have information, disturbing information, about the NAORC. And about a project they’re running in collaboration with… your associates.”

My jaw tightened. “Yes. The EOTO. The NAORC is placing nice with us for the time being.”

“Specifically,” Vance continued, her voice dropping, “Both organizations keeping tabs on the Waxahachie particle accelerator. The guys in charge there are not just smashing atoms, Jim. They’re… attempting something far more ambitious. Something involving temporal manipulation. And according to Siouxsie, it’s not going well.”

Siouxsie shifted, the fabric of her sleeves rustling. “Not going well is an understatement. Think… messing with things that should not be messed with. And guess who’s right in the middle of it?”

The weight of her words settled heavily in the air. The burnt plastic taste of the coffee seemed to intensify.

Suddenly, the bell above the diner door chimed, announcing new arrivals. Two men, both broad-shouldered and possessing that unsettlingly vacant gaze I’d become familiar with in my tenure with the EOTO. NAORC operatives.

“Company,” I stated, my voice low.

Siouxsie stiffened beside me. “They’re… looking for someone small. And probably someone who smells faintly of waffle batter.”

“Time to go,” Vance said, already sliding out of the booth.

As I rose, I felt a tug on my coat. Siouxsie. “Hold tight,” she whispered, her voice no longer muffled.

Before I could react, she moved. A blur of black fabric, faster than anything I could have anticipated. One moment she was beside me, the next she was halfway to the exit, weaving through tables with an impossible agility. The pursuing men, momentarily stunned by her speed, stumbled over a discarded tray.

And then, something truly remarkable happened. As she reached the door, a ripple seemed to distort the air around her. For a split second, she wasn’t quite… there. More like a flicker on a faulty television screen. Then she was gone, the door swinging shut behind her.

Vance and I exchanged a look. Even through my red-tinted lenses, I could see the shock mirrored in her eyes. Something was undeniably… different about Siouxsie.

We made our escape through the back exit, less dramatically but no less urgently. Siouxsie was already waiting in the alley, leaning against a dumpster, the oversized hoodie still concealing her features.

“Show off,” I muttered, though a grudging respect was beginning to form.

“Had to make an impression,” she replied, a hint of that sly wit I’d heard in her voice earlier. A far cry from her tense anxious pleas over the phone.

A decommissioned NAORC facility outside of Los Alamos became our next destination. Maybe we could find something of use there. Vance worked there in the past and knew its layout; Siouxsie possessed… abilities of some sort apparantely. And I, well, I had... vague... experience with the unpleasant things NAORC liked to keep hidden.

But that can wait till tomorrow. I was overdue for a nap and a shower. We headed to the crappy motel I booked.

Later, while Siouxsie was boredly flipping throught he channels on the motel TV while demolishing an entire pizza, Vance was out getting supplies, and I was sound asleep in a chair, the satellite link on my laptop pinged and woke me up from my slumber. A text message from an anonymous Count Jim BBS user. The words were simple, chillingly so: \[The Red Inquisitioner knows\]. Inquisitor. It has to be the scary dude in the pointy hood.

The implications hung in the air, thick and suffocating. The hunt was on. And we were the prey.
