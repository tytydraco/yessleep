Hey guys, I'm not usually the type of person to ask for advice on the internet but I don’t really know what to do right now. I don't want to be like one of those recipe pages where they tell you their entire life story before actually getting to the recipe, but in order to help me I think it's important to get some background on my situation.

I met my roommate, we’ll call them Cameron, online. I know what you're thinking, I had kinda signed up for some weird shit rooming with some rando. The reason I resorted to finding someone online instead of asking a friend is that a
A) I don't have a lot of friends, and B) The few friends I do have either want to live alone or live with their partner/family so I didn't really have a choice and C) I am not really in contact with my family right now. I would live on my own if I could, but I am currently working as an intern and barely make enough to scrape by. 

This is how I ended up on the “looking for roommates in their 20s” facebook page. Cameron messaged me first, and I thought it was really weird that they didn't have any facebook friends nor a profile picture, but I thought the polite thing to do was respond. However, we got to talking and it seemed like we had a lot in common - we both are okay with clutter as long as it is not gross (i.e moldy food or poorly unkempt bathrooms/hygiene), and loved cats, horror movies, and time to recharge on our own. 

Cameron told me that they specifically made their facebook page to find a roommate and isnt really interested in having a social media presence which is why there is very little info on their page. I can respect that, sometimes I wish I never got my first facebook account at 13 and relished unrestricted internet access. 

Cameron said that they were just moving into the cities this year from a small farming town up north and was a little nervous about living in the cities for the first time. After talking more, we decided to meet up in person. We agreed to meet at a small diner halfway between their current home and mine, which still ended up being a 2 hour drive. They had gotten there first, and when they stood up to greet me I was stunned as they did not look like I expected them to. Cameron was tall, muscular, and incredibly attractive. Their pale blue eyes seemed to glow in the dark and their teeth lined up as straight and uniform as a military cemetery. 

I found myself jealous, as my eyes were dark brown (and not the pretty dark brown like puppy dog eyes, like sewer water brown) and never got braces when I should have. After I got over my initial shock, I bustled my way over to try to cover up my reaction. We shook hands and sat across from one another in an old booth that seemed incredibly worn but still felt welcoming. 

We discussed our desired living situation: how many bathrooms, did we need a dishwasher or in unit laundry, was AC necessary, are we okay with pets, rent budget, and neighborhood we wanted to live in. Cameron appeared to be the perfect roommate, agreeing with everything I said I was looking for in an apartment. I readily accepted their offer to move in together.

We found the perfect apartment and started moving in 2 months after we first started talking on facebook. Neither of us had much so we were able to move all of our things ourselves without having to rent a moving van. Our layout looked something like this: our bedrooms were linked with a jack and jill bathroom that had plenty of space for 2 people to keep their things and get ready at the same time. The front door opened up into the living room with the closet containing the washer and dryer to the immediate right. The kitchen was to the left and there was a small island between the kitchen and living room. I already had 2 cats, Seymour and Audrey, that Cameron was very happy to live with. At first glance, it seemed like we were going to be great roommates.

Okay, sorry for rambling. I just want to show that everything was normal at first. Our lives intertwined seamlessly - I left for work before they got up, and they got home when I was starting to get ready for bed. We would occasionally eat dinner together on the weekends and play video games and watch movies and stuff, and sometimes go out for a beer. That is how it was for the first 5 months or so - until I noticed the hole in my bedroom wall. I saw it after I started to hang things up on that wall and noticed a small chip in the paint. I inspected it, as I did not notice it when we were filling out the form with all the damages from before we moved in so they wouldn't be counted when we got our security deposit back. 

As I looked at it more closely, I saw something that reflected off of my lamp for just a second. I got my phone to use as a flashlight and spotted a small, round, black object that was no bigger than a peppercorn. The hole was too small to reach in with my fingers, so I started searching for things small enough to grab whatever it was. I tried everything I could think of: tweezers, tooth pics, tape, pliers, cotton swabs, you name it. Eventually I gave up and just went to bed.

I couldn't sleep that night, all I could do was stare at the ceiling and think about what it could be. After a few hours of tossing and turning - i decided that if i couldn't get it out, i have to make the hole bigger. I wasn't too worried about the security deposit since the hole was already made, what difference does it make if it's just a little bit bigger?

I didn't have any tools, so I dug around until I found a small pocket knife that my grandpa got me as a souvenir from Alaska. It said, in all caps, “I LOVE MY GRANDPA!!” I slowly made the hole bigger until it was enough to pull the object out with my tweezers. I celebrated as soon as i got it out, until i realized what it was.

It was a pin camera.

I only recognized it because I worked as a tour guide for a spy museum one summer. My mind went blank before the sirens in my head started going off. What the fuck was this? Who put it here? Is it the landlord watching us? Was there a person living in the ceiling that only came out when we were gone? My brain reeled with possibilities, mostly related to situations in different horror movies I had seen (I had just watched 13 Cameras last week), but one thing was certain: I had to search the apartment for other cameras. I just have to wait until Cameron is gone.

Cameron is gone for the weekend visiting family. We had previously discussed that it would be okay to quickly run into each other's rooms if needed, like if the cats were going crazy or we needed to borrow something. I hadn't had a reason to go into their room yet, but I had to see if there was a camera in their room too. I didn't want to freak them out without evidence. I opened their door and was a little surprised at the lack of furniture. 

Cameron had a twin size mattress on the floor without a bed frame, a small desk, and a wooden cutting board that they must have been using as a bedside table. There was nothing on any of the walls, no lamps, and no TV or computer that I could see. It was the polar opposite of my room (it looked like it was straight out of howl's moving castle). I was relieved that I didn't have to move a ton of furniture or take things off of the wall though. I started on the wall next to the bathroom where mine was and when I didn't find it I started searching up and down every wall.

Nothing.

As soon as I started to walk out, I realized I hadn't looked in the closet yet. I went over and pulled open the sliding door and froze. The clothes in their closet were almost the same as mine. I closed the door and left. I was a little weirded out, but we had a similar job and we never saw each other wearing anything other than pajamas or sweatpants so I chalked it up to a coincidence. 

Anyways, I left their room and softly closed the door. I leaned against it and took a deep breath - half relieved and half terrified. It was good that Cameron wasn’t being targeted, but that meant that someone was watching me specifically.

After our last conversation, I'm pretty sure it's Cameron.

The next saturday that we were both home, I decided to bring it up. I brought them into my room and showed them the hole and the camera. They said, “what the fuck dude, thats messed up” but his face showed little emotion. I suspected they were just in shock, as I was when I found it. Then I told them I had gone into their room. They became rigid and slowly turned their whole body at me, as if they were one solid being without joints or limbs. They stared at me and I felt their eyes in my soul as they blazed with an emotion I can't name - fear? Hatred? Confusion? I wasn't sure.

“You went in my room?” they asked coldly. I guess it was more of a statement than a question, but I answered him anyways

“Yeah, I wanted to make sure that there were no cameras in your room so you didn't freak out and tear apart your room trying to find one. I didn't find any though, I guess they're only interested in me'' I laughed, trying to avoid the fear that was striking its way through my veins.

“You. went. In. my. Room.”

“Uh.. yeah?” I was confused. This was something clearly stated in our roommate agreement that we could go into each other's rooms if necessary.

“Did you see anything weird in there”

“I just told you I didn't see any cameras. Don't worry, your room seems normal”

“Okay” silence filled the space between us. I stood under Camerons gaze, feeling as though I were being dissected. Then, Cameron flashed their 100 watt smile.

“Good,” they said. “I can help you search your room and the rest of the place for other cameras?” 

We searched our apartment top to bottom. Nothing. While I was still on edge, I felt better knowing it was the only one. Maybe it was left over from a previous resident freak? I decided to plug the camera into my computer to see if there was any footage on it. Thankfully, it seemed like it was really outdated and had no data on it. I threw the camera away, but decided it would be a good idea to put a small camera in my room to see if anyone strange came in or out. I didn't think to tell Cameron about it since it was my room, and it was a good thing I didn't.

After a few weeks of recording, I decided to review the footage. It was mostly normal stuff: me on my computer, sleeping, cleaning, etc. that is, until the second week.

The door to my room creaked open slowly and a large figure began to walk through the darkness. My breath refused to come out of my lungs as my heart pulsated. When the light turned on, I felt like I was having a heart attack.

It was Cameron.

They started by doing a quick scan of the room before opening my closet. They didn’t do anything, just stared at it as if he was taking pictures with his mind. They did this all around my room, spending the most time looking at the pictures of me and my friends/family on my desk. After a few minutes, they turned off the light and quietly left my room.

After that, I really didn’t know what to do or how to interact with them. I tried to keep it cool but I could tell that I was acting weird, they didn’t say anything about it and went on as usual. I decided to do some background research on them (something I should have done in the first place).

I started easy by googling their name. I knew they didn’t have a social media presence but I still expected something to come up: a LinkedIn profile, a news article, a mention in a dean’s list or something - but absolutely nothing came up. I thought maybe I didn’t spell their last name right, so I decided to look at their ID when they were in the shower. I quietly went to the basket in the entryway where we keep our wallets and keys and slid the ID out of its pocket and froze.

Cameron’s name was not the one printed on the ID.

The picture was definitely them, the blonde hair and wide smile - but the eye color description said BRO, not BLU. I looked closely at the picture and realized that instead of their piercing blue eyes, it looked like the person in the picture had brown eyes. I quickly took a picture of their ID and put everything back as I had found it and escaped to my room.

I decided to google the name on the ID. Sure enough, a fair amount of information popped up. Whoever this person is seems to be a carefree and easy going person with lots of pictures of them with friends and family. I sighed in relief when I clicked on the facebook profile as it was public. I started from the bottom and scrolled through their posts. Most of it was the normal stuff: happy birthday wishes, memories from years prior, pictures of them at events and stuff.

I couldn’t help but notice their eyes. Again, they were not the piercing blue that I have come to know - they were brown, like a puppy staring at you with unconditional admiration. I didn’t think that Cameron wore contacts and I never saw any in our bathroom.

The final post was dated 2 years ago. It said: 

“Can’t wait to move into my new apartment! My new roommate Cameron is the best!!”

Posted with the update was a picture of the person with the brown eyes and another person that I did not recognize at first, until I noticed their piercing blue eyes.

Cameron’s eyes.

I have no words to describe what I was feeling at that moment. My heart sank so deep into my body I thought I would shit it out. I closed my laptop and stared at the wall, my thoughts coursing through my head so fast that it felt like I wasn’t thinking at all.

I decided to just go to bed.

UPDATE:
Hi, I know it has been a while since I posted this and I have to say I am very embarrassed about it. Turns out our apartment had a carbon monoxide leak and I was hallucinating. I am out of the hospital now, thankfully Cameron was at work when this happened and came home to find me passed out. I am not very internet savvy so I am not sure how to edit or delete this post but I did figure out how to comment.I just wanted to update and reassure you all that I am OK! I have decided to move back to my hometown to spend time with my family to take my mind off of things. Cameron is sad but understanding and is looking for a roommate. Attached below is a screenshot of their facebook if you are in the area and looking for a roommate!
