I’ve seen a lot of creepy places in my line of work. Real estate agents can be desperate, trying to offload old, rundown homes, and I’m the guy who has to make them look… livable. But there’s one house that I can’t forget.

It was an old Victorian on the edge of town, one of those that had sat empty for years. The listing agent swore up and down that it was *“perfect for the right buyer*.” But everyone who’d tried to sell it before had failed. So, they called me in to do what I do best—make the place look appealing with the magic of a camera.

The moment I stepped inside, something felt off. The air was heavy, like the house was holding its breath. It was one of those places where the silence wasn’t comforting—it felt *waiting*. I pushed it aside, reminded myself it was just an old house.

I took my first shot in the living room. The dim light from the windows barely cut through the dust in the air, casting long, sharp shadows on the walls. Nothing unusual. Just a run-down house. But when I checked the preview on my camera, I froze.

In the reflection of a dusty mirror, *I could see someone standing behind me.*

I whipped around, heart hammering in my chest. Nothing. The room was empty, as it should have been. I checked the camera again, zooming in on the reflection. The figure was still there—faint but unmistakable. A man, dressed in dark clothes, standing in the corner of the room.

I did what I always do in situations like this—I chalked it up to shadows, bad lighting, and too much caffeine. I’d seen weirder things while photographing houses. Maybe I was just imagining things.

But then, the noises started.

It was subtle at first—just a creak from the floorboards above. Then it was footsteps. Slow, deliberate steps. I could hear them, but every time I walked upstairs, the house was as still as it had been when I first entered.

I kept photographing. Every room seemed to get darker, though. The shadows stretched longer, the silence heavier. But when I looked at the images on my camera… something wasn’t right. The rooms I’d just shot were *different*. The furniture had moved—chairs facing different directions, rugs twisted, and one room had what looked like a figure standing just out of frame.

I’m not one to panic easily, but the hairs on the back of my neck were standing up. I wasn’t alone. Something was in there with me.

When I finished taking the pictures, I left quickly. I had no intention of going back, but the next day, the agent called and asked for the photos. I’d already uploaded them to the system, but when I looked at the preview again, my stomach dropped.

The figure was there, clearer now, standing directly behind me in the hallway mirror. The same man.

I should’ve quit right then and there. But I didn’t. Instead, I went back, alone, to delete the files and fix the situation.

But when I arrived, the house was different. The door creaked open like it had been expecting me. Inside, everything was as it had been when I left. Except for one thing.

The man was waiting for me in the living room. This time, he wasn’t a reflection. He was real.

I tried to run, but the door slammed shut behind me. The air grew colder, and the shadows seemed to reach out for me, curling around my feet, pulling me back.

I didn’t know how I got out, but I did. The door flew open, and I was running, heart pounding. When I got back to my car, I felt… *safe* for the first time in what felt like forever. I thought I was done. That house was behind me.

But that’s where I was wrong.

The next morning, I went to bed early, exhausted. That night, I woke up to the sound of slow, deliberate footsteps outside my bedroom door. My heart stopped. *I was home now*. I wasn’t supposed to hear those footsteps anymore.

I crept out of bed, hoping it was just the house settling. But when I looked into the hallway, I saw him again. The man.

This time, he wasn’t in a mirror. He was standing in my hallway, his eyes locked on me.

And then I heard his voice, deep and raspy, like it was coming from the walls themselves.

**“You took my picture.”**

I froze in place, my breath catching in my throat. I could feel the weight of his gaze, even though his face was still blurry, like the reflection I’d seen in the house’s mirror. But this time, the distortion wasn’t on the photo—it was *in real life.*

**“You took my picture,”** he repeated, his voice more like a hiss than words.

I stumbled backward, my heart thundering in my chest. Was this a dream? Some twisted nightmare? It had to be. There was no way this was real.

But then he stepped forward.

It wasn’t just his movement that made my blood run cold—it was the *sound* of his footsteps. Each one echoed, the sound growing louder, deeper, as if his footfalls were coming from *inside* the house itself. The floorboards creaked beneath him, but I wasn’t the one moving.

I tried to scream, but my voice wouldn’t come out. **My body was paralyzed**. I couldn’t move, couldn’t even blink. It was like my mind was screaming, but my body was trapped in place. I didn’t know what to do, how to make it stop.

Then, I noticed something else.

The shadows in the hallway were moving. They stretched longer, pulling themselves along the walls like they had a life of their own. They slithered toward me, a dark tide creeping over the carpet, reaching out like fingers.

The man in the hallway didn’t move any closer, but his eyes never left me. They were black as ink, empty. And just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore, he whispered something that chilled me to the bone.

**“You are mine now.”**

In an instant, I snapped out of it. My body came alive again, and I bolted. I ran faster than I thought was possible, throwing open the door to my room and slamming it shut behind me. I grabbed my phone, hands shaking, and called the first person I could think of—my best friend, Marcus.

The phone rang once. Twice. Three times.

*“Hello?”* he answered groggily.

*“Marcus, something’s wrong,”* I said, my voice a breathless whisper. “I need you to come over. Please.”

*“What’s going on?”*

I couldn’t explain. I didn’t have the words. All I could do was beg him to come. I could hear the concern in his voice as he promised to head over right away. But the moment I hung up, the house seemed to *shift.* The temperature dropped. The air became thick, suffocating.

I heard those footsteps again. Slow. Methodical. Coming down the hall.

I turned, staring at the door to my room. I was so sure I locked it, but now… I wasn’t so sure. The air felt heavy, like the space itself was bending, folding in on itself.

My phone buzzed. I glanced at the screen. A text from Marcus: *On my way. Stay safe.*

But I didn’t feel safe. I didn’t feel anything but the overwhelming weight of something watching me.

Suddenly, the door to my room rattled. The handle twisted, as if someone was trying to break in. I backed up, my eyes scanning the room for anything I could use to defend myself. There was nothing.

And then, the door crashed open.

There he was. The man from the house. His form was clearer now, standing in the doorway, his face a hollow void of skin, like his features were melted away and replaced by darkness. His mouth stretched into a grotesque smile, too wide, too unnatural.

**“You thought you could leave?”** he rasped, his voice like nails on a chalkboard.

I backed up, terrified, knowing I couldn’t escape. I was trapped in my own room with the thing that had followed me. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it would explode.

But then, a loud crash from downstairs. The door to my apartment slammed open. Marcus.

*“Yo, what the hell?”* I heard him shout from the hallway, but his voice was distant, like he was in another room.

I ran toward the door, but the man was faster. He reached out with long, bony fingers and grabbed my wrist. His touch was ice-cold, as if his very presence sucked the warmth from the air. I screamed, kicking and clawing, but he didn’t let go.

**“You’re mine now,”** he whispered again, and the world seemed to warp around me.

I heard Marcus calling out to me, but it was all muffled. The air thickened, the shadows grew, and the walls of my apartment seemed to close in on me, like the house I’d left was pulling me back, bringing me into its fold.

And then, everything went black.

When I woke up, I was lying on my couch. The sunlight was streaming through the windows, and for a moment, I thought it had all been a nightmare. But I felt *him.*

I turned slowly, my heart in my throat, and there he was again. Standing in the doorway, smiling that wide, grotesque smile. He was *in my home now,* not just a figment of my nightmares.

And that’s when I realized—I hadn’t escaped.

The house hadn’t let me go.

I was *never* meant to leave.
