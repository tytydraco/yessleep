I am not really sure where to begin this, what to say. I do not know how to move forward. Maybe there isn’t a forward for me, honestly. I understand a little of what Grin is now, and how he works. What he is using me for. I will put this last post out here, giving as much detail as I can without… hurting you. Maybe someone, one of you, will have an answer. A way to get rid of him. If not, this may be my last post.



The night he left those gashes in my neck, I didn’t go back to sleep. I simply sat in my bed, staring into the only dark corner of my room. Grin was there staring back at me. He seemed different now, more real. As if the events of the night somehow strengthened him. My doubt of him was completely erased. He is real. 



Eventually I gathered the courage to call a few friends of mine and explain the situation. I didn’t leave out any details and they told me to pack my things and come to them. Not out of belief. They believed I needed help, and they were going to get it for me. I spent the rest of that night packing, and then I sat down to wait till they picked me up in a few hours. That few hours turned out to be extremely interesting, to say the least.



The lamp I had flickered and died. Leaving only the screen of my laptop and phone illuminating the room. Grin immediately hopped down from the corner of the room, but he didn’t approach me. As for me, I think I must have been in shock at the time, because I honestly didn’t have much of a reaction besides thinking - Oh great, I’m sure this is it for me.



It wasn’t me that it was the end for. Instead Grin took interest in my hallucinations, which as of late were less amorphous than they used to be. They were clearly defined and looked like people.. Fucked up people. Scary people. But people. A clear contrast between them and the monstrosity that is grin. He began shoving them around, picking them up and tossing them. He placed his large clawed hand on the shoulder of one, grasping the wrist in his other hand and began pulling. Its mouth opened in a scream but no sounds came out. I watched in horror as the arm pulled out of its shoulder socket and began stretching, until it ripped out completely. There was no gore, no blood, the arm simply disappeared and after a few moments so did the hallucination.



Grin’s eyes seemed to light up with joy. He did this to several others before his eyes lost that happy glow, his grin slightly diminishing. I studied him curiously, starting to think maybe I had misjudged the situation. Maybe I wasn’t in danger? The wounds on my neck would beg otherwise, but he isn’t killing me right now. Just as those thoughts finished flashing through my brain, Grin’s face began convulsing. His mouth began to rip and tear, his grin becoming a huge gaping hole. He turned towards another hallucination and picked it up by one arm, dangling it over his mouth. A terrible scream made me cover my ears. I watched in horror as he slowly dropped the shadowy man into his mouth. Slowly chewing, clearly enjoying the sensation of his mouth being filled. As if this is what he has been waiting for this whole time.



He finished chewing and then locked eyes with me, and then simply vanished. I sat there for a while, numb. Not really knowing what to do. Honestly, I was in shock. After what seemed like hours but in reality was only 30 minutes I finally got a grip on myself. I called my two best friends, and explained everything. They were skeptics at heart, but still amazing people. They told me to pack my shit up, they were gonna come get me, help me get a new doctor and start seeing a therapist as soon as possible.



That was a week or so ago. I started my medication again, and the hallucinations went away but.. Grin did not. My encounters with him over the next few days were mostly mundane, except for one in particular. The house my friends lived in was very large and they shared it with quite a few others. It was more like two houses attached to each other, honestly. Except the 2nd house was full of music equipment, and there was one room in the basement that someone lived in. Grin would be in random parts of the house throughout the day, I could hear him scraping his claws on the walls and floor. He seemed pretty restless. On the evening of my first therapy session which was at 7pm, I was getting ready to leave. Threw on my coat and winter boots, and headed out the door. I was about halfway down the block when I heard a distant scream, one I knew all too well. I turned back just in time to see the front door thrown open and Grin charging through it, his mouth straightened out in a flat line. Almost downturned at the corners. Not quite a frown. He looked around for a second before he saw me, the grin returning to his face. He started walking forward, and then simply disappeared. 



It took a few therapy sessions before my therapist, Mary, got me to start talking about Grin. In the beginning we had mostly talked about childhood trauma centering around my mother, but she could tell I wasn’t leaving something big out.



When I finally confessed to seeing things, our therapy sessions took an entirely different route altogether. She began asking me what kind of things I saw, where was Grin now, was he in the room. That one was easy to answer. Right behind her, slightly leaning forward. If she were to look up she’d see him. Well, from my perspective anyways. She had a lamp in front of her desk, and two lights near the door, which resulted in a dim shadow being cast behind her. 



Grin really liked when I talked about him. He practically hovered off the floor and his body seemed to shake with excitement. I thought it odd at the time that he seemed focused on Mary, but I should have seen it as a warning. He would stare down at her every session. Getting really close, but not quite touching her. 



Other times I have seen him look up into the cameras in the corners of the room. Mary said they were just to document everything and that the footage was localized. Only saved to her computer. Allowing her to go back and analyze body behavior and things of that nature after the fact. Grin seemed fascinated by them.



A week went by, and between Mary, and my friends, I was quite convinced I was crazy. The break in reality that was Grin seemed too real for me to let go of, but their arguments were so convincing. Questions that made me contemplate where my head really was. Mary would ask me things like: “Why is it only you can see him, what would be his motive, how is it that he came to be”. Which I found quite ironic because after speaking with Mary at length it became apparent that she believed in the supernatural, ghosts, demons, angels. That didn’t deter her from being adamant about my condition. 



She was wrong.



The 9th visit, or two days ago, was most likely the end of my life. It was for sure, the end of Mary’s. She started that therapy session much like every other one, pleasantries, progress, anything new? 



“No nothing new, Mary. Just Grin. I have been sleeping a little better since I started the therapy though”



She completely ignored everything after I said Grin. She had a weird fascinated look in her eye. “I’ve been doing some research into more supernatural avenues, and I just want to know what he looks like,” She said, crossing her arms, her eyebrows drawn down in intense thought.



She said something else but I didn’t hear it. Grin was vibrating and his smile was wider than ever. His mouth started busting apart at the corners, becoming a large maw of teeth. His eyes almost popping out of his head, red streaks running through them. He leaned over Mary, his gaping maw of a bladed mouth hovering inches away from her head, his claws drawn up to her sides just waiting to grab hold of her.



“Simon. I asked if you could draw me a picture of him” She asked, noticing where I was staring, glancing upwards and then back at me.  
  
“Is he behind me again?” She asked, but there seemed to be a bit of hesitation in her voice. A small hitch.



I simply nodded in response. Almost afraid my voice would set Grin into motion.



Mary took a deep breath and relaxed, sliding a piece of paper and a pencil over to me.



“Simon, please focus. I know this is hard but we need to get through this. If we can’t make some kind of ground on this you might need to consider stronger psychiatric help.” She said, gesturing at the paper.



I closed my eyes for a second, and tried to center myself. I need to do what she says. I promised my friends that I would do everything in my power to get better, and Mary is a professional. “I am not much of an artist, but I will do my best” I replied, looking down at the paper.



This is when I should have stopped. I glanced up at Grin before I started drawing, and immediately locked eyes with him. His position didn’t change, but he gripped me. I never felt an interaction like this before. I couldn’t look away. He was staring into my soul and I could feel something. A presence in my body that shouldn’t be there. My hand didn’t feel like mine as it started sketching out the exact image before me. It started with Mary. Drawing her long hair and bangs in detail, even adding shading to her face. I slowly, painfully started drawing Grin and his cavernous mouth, hovering over Mary’s head.



I tried to regain control, to pull my eyes off of Grin. I managed to move my hand off the page for a single second, leaving a single imperfect line through the page. It wasn’t  enough. 



“Mary, LEAVE” I shouted at her. 



She looked at the picture in earnest. The realization of what I was drawing hit her and her eyes went wide. She pulled at a necklace that was underneath her shirt but it got caught and tangled. As I finished the picture I felt the compulsory feeling leave my body. Mary glanced down at the page and then up and a scream started to form, but Grin beat her to it. 



He let out a bloodcurdling scream and bit downwards, taking her neck clean at the shoulders, his clawed hands digging into her sides and tearing outwards. Blood and insides splattering over me. It was over in an instant. Mary’s headless corpse in front of me. Dangling from Grin’s mouth was a crucifix on a gold chain, which Mary had been desperately trying to get to in her last moments.



The rest of that day was a blur. At first I was interrogated by a few local police officers, but after the footage was reviewed a few men in suits came to talk to me. The interrogation room was a little dim. Grin was standing there in the corner, still covered in blood, his mouth still had bits of flesh around the edges. His teeth were stained with blood. I couldn’t pay attention to what the men were saying to me. I nodded here and there, did my best to at least appear to be listening. After a while they left, and I was taken to a cell.

  


I was held in a cell for one day, waiting for someone to look at the picture, waiting for more carnage to ensue but it didn’t come. Either Grin wasn’t hungry or whatever weird parameters hadn’t been met. 



Another man came and talked to me, a chain and badge hung around his neck. He was quite tall, maybe 6ft 3 with short blonde hair and a long beard. I caught his name, Mason. The lead detective on the case. He explained to me that they were able to get the video footage off of Mary’s laptop, and wanted to go through it with me. 



“See, until we got this footage you were the only suspect. Now that we have the footage, we know that you didn’t physically do it, but we have questions, "he said, setting a laptop down between us. He loaded up a video and hit play.



I shut my eyes at first, but then resolved to watch it. Maybe I could figure something out myself.

Watching the video footage proved unfruitful. It was clear to me that the detective could not see Grin. The only thing that really worried me was that the picture I drew was probably catalogued into evidence. I don’t think the picture is enough by itself, figured there would be another death by now. Honestly though, I really had no idea.



“Moment’s before this happened, Mary had asked you to draw something. What was it you were drawing? I don’t want to have to watch all of your sessions, but I will. They are all here”



Grin immediately started shaking with excitement again. His eyes fixated on the detective.



“It was nothing, just one of my hallucinations” I lied, the words coming out shakily. He frowned at me, clearly not believing me.



We talked for some time longer, but I didn’t answer any more questions.



I told him I didn’t know what happened, and declined to answer any questions. I asked for a lawyer and then he let me go, saying he’d be in touch.



It’s been a few days since then. I typed this out from my phone and posted it on the go. I haven’t gone back to my friends. I am starving. I am hungry. I am going through withdrawal all over again, but I can’t risk stopping at my friends. I’d have to explain everything, explain what I am sure they had seen on the news. They might be skeptics at heart, but with what has happened now I am afraid they would believe me. So instead I have found an abandoned tent in the woods. Looks like someone who was homeless might have been living here a long time ago, but it’s good enough for me.



rin is growing restless. I can hear him calling my name while I am sleeping.



I don’t know what to do, but I need to figure out something soon. If something like this happens to you, get help sooner. For me it might be too late.



Grin doesn’t hide in the shadows anymore.
