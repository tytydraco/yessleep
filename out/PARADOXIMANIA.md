My name is unspokable by human but you can call me 'omega john' im an alter of the GUY named john, what is alter you may ask, well in this universe there is 5 wall, and your universe is the middle of it, I'm an alter, like my name suggest im an alternate version of John from your universe, I'm from the fifth wall and our job is to protect other wall and your universe that we call 'the xore', from the outer universe that called  'paradoximania', well alter will usually being called by you human as the 'dopelganger' or alien, whatever... 

Just remember, we don't always success fully defending the Wall, that means there is some 'paradoximania' creature roam freely in your universe, we call it 'morphdox' because it could morph itself as anybody, it could be your parents or your best friend, and the people it morphed into.... 

Let me say it in two worlds 'mash potato'
.....

I know it's hard to believe but we believe that there is a a device in your universe that named 'energy manipulation, and kinetic morphing device' or shortly 'ENMANOVICE', what can this device do is that it can manipulate morphdox morphing ability and make it morph into anything we want, but remember there is the demon with two side of face, one is black with wide smiling white mouth, and one side is white with wide smilling black mouth, It has no eye, it is blind obviously, but once it gain the device he could gain his eye back, and all of 5 walls and the 'xore' will be destroyed, completely as a dust..... 
So please find the device, communication end


We met again, listen you may wonder 'why dont you find the device yourself' well, we cant go to your universe because we could turn insane in your universe or even worse, explode. So then let me narrate what happen.and how do i can narrate all of this,let me simplify it,our ability is beyond your knowledge as a fith wall entity but our brain is still weak when we get into your universe or xore, that's why I maybe will say something that normal people normally shouldn't know like another people thoughts and action like this boy, james he is very important, but I cant explain it now 

Its monday, one of the most hated day for james,but he dont realize that this day will be worser than he expected..... 


James walk down the stair after changing his clothes to his school uniform, he wake up pretty late, 'hey mom, whats for breakfast'. 'cereal, eat faster, the bus will arrive soon', 'dont worry mom, you kbow im the fastest cereal eater right?' right after he finished a bowl of cereal, the bus school arrived, he quickly gi wash gis hand and mouth and running to get to the bus, after getting in the bus, he sit on his regular spot next to gis friends, kevin.' hey kevin, how is your day'ask james.'fine,how about you' ask kevin. 'i wake up pretty late but i still coyld eat a bowl of cereal because you know im the fastest cereal eater right', they're both then laught at the james, joking ablut his record of beating everyone in eating cereal the fastest.

right at 9:00 am, theyre arrive at the school, they having some math class for morning, after that a little bit of science, at the recces time something james go to the toilet, just to hear some one knocking on the door stall, he pretty shocked then say 'already occupied' loudly, but suddenly he hear a laughter, a twisted laughter, something isn't right, it's not a human, the creature then bang it's hand on the door telling james to open the door, 'don't you want to play?' say the creature, james then started shouting, the teacher that walk pass the toilet hear james screaming in the toilet and rushing in, james then hear some glass Shattered, and something big hit the door stall like very strong, the door almost shattered into pieces, after a while, the teacher then called james, telling him it's safe for him to get out now, he then get out and find some tall man laying on the floor with his head shattered and full of the glass, the teacher then tell james to get back into the class, he did and run away into the class, james is traumatized by what happening to him, he being silent for the rest of day, when he about to take a bus to go home, he see a police car, parked outside the school, he knows why the police is here, he being very silent in the bus, not like usual, kevin even ask him 'are you okay?, you seems worried by something, you can tell me your problem, I'm your best friends' ask kevin, 'nothing, it just i having a stomachache from the canteen pudding you know' Answer james, 'but..you don't see like....' 'no, nothing else just stomachache, can we don't talk about this' say james after Cutting the kevin word, kevin and James being silent in the bus.

At home james is so surprised to see a cops car in front of his house, he scared something bad might happen, but after he get in, his parent explained why the police here, it's about the man in the toilet, the police say 'it just some pedophile, he somehow get into the school, don't worry he under arrest now.' say the officer. 'you lucky the teacher save you that time' said his mom. After a long discussion, Jame feeling so sleepy and tired and decide to take a nap earlier, 

At 11:23 pm, james woken up by the sound of the glass shattered, he think that there might be a robber in his house, he quickly sneakily get into his parent bedroom that just next to his room, he knocked the door, but nobody answered, he try to open the door... 

'it's unlocked, that's weird.' 


I'm there he shocked to see a window in his parent bedroom is shattered into a pieces and his parents is nowhere to be found, he then turn on a light just to see something horrifying

Someone eye on the floor

He almost puked when he see it, but then something knock on his bedroom door, he knows it's not his parent so he get out throught the window to hide at outside for a while, he lucky it isn't raining tonight, he then hear something destroyed his bedroom door, and then a footstep, after a while, the footstep slowly fade away and he get back in, he go to downstairs to call the police but on the way he get down, he see his parents hanged upside down, they weren't awake, the telephone is behind his parents, he could see that his mom lost one eye. 

He then remembered about the eye in his parent bedroom, he then go get the phone but when he turned back he see some gore scene that gonna terrify him forever, his parent back is like a crab with his back being drilled by some big drill and the rib cage is like spread out to form some kind of mouth but it has ribcage as a teeth and there some thing like egg inside it, he dont even call the police, he just straight up run to the front door, but when he open the front door, he see some big tall figure, it is pretty blur but after some second the creature morph into james, james is very confused by this, but when he turned back to run away, he see his parent in perfect condition, not hanged anymore, no holes, they're perfect, but the smile it's unexplainable. 

The james doppelganger then say, 'your heart is the way to serve our lord, may he get his eye back' the doppelganger then hold james from behind while his parents morph their hand into something creepy, like a knife, james know what they're doing, they want to take his heart for some ritual, but then the police officer from earlier came and save james, his head is bleeding a little bit and his hand is bandaged, he blind the creature with the bright flashlight that james dad own, he then grab james and bring him into his car and get away from there, james then asked what is happening, the officer answered 'you better don't know it kid' 
The officer then drive the car and bring james away from that terrifying house, 

And if you wonder what happen to james, don't worry, he save with me, do you know the officer names? 


His name is john
