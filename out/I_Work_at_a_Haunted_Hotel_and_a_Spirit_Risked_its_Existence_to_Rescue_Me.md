I still work at the Eidolon Hotel, though I’m now a partner instead of a mere employee. And I'm family! It was the following incident that led Mrs. Coriz to promote me, and although it was a terrifying experience, I’m glad it happened!

As I mentioned [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/187lmda/i_work_at_a_haunted_hotel_and_the_tenants_saved/), Mrs. Coriz is the last in her family line, so she hired me to help out in her family’s business. She taught me that spirits weren’t dead people but beings born from extreme pain and suffering that fed off fear, which is why they take the shape of what they believe is scary. She also taught me that spirits were hunted by vipirits. Those guys are born of hate, and they devour the essence of spirits. 

That’s how the Eidolon Hotel came about centuries ago. It’s a sanctuary to protect spirits. I don't know how, exactly, but the Corizs have set up foolproof protection around the building to keep vipirits out. Over the years, it became a hotel, where each room has a spirit tenant, and our guests reserve the room they want to get their scare on. It’s a perfect mutually beneficial relationship between the spirits and Corizs.

With Mrs. Coriz being the only one left of her family, she works 7am to 7pm, and I work the remaining hours. I love my job. It’s a lot of work, but seeing the excitement of the people checking in always makes my day. Sometimes I even stay during Mrs. Coriz’s shift just to see the thrilled looks on the faces of the guests checking out.

You’d think the spirits would have haunting down to an art, especially since fear is their only source of sustenance, but that isn’t always the case. On that fateful day, after the last guest checked in at midnight, I left the *"Be back soon! If it's urgent, call the number below!"* sign on the front desk and ran to the employee area laundry room, finishing up the last of the sheets, pillow cases, and towels. 

After running the dryer, I popped by the kitchenette for a soda, and I jumped when I saw a hideous creature blocking the door. Their long, sallow body arched up from the ground, their saggy skin hanging from the dozen arms sticking out from each side. They looked as though the pale man from Pan’s Labyrinth had a child with a centipede, except instead of eyeballs in the palms, they were all clustered on the face above a blood-red mouth lined with uneven shark teeth.

“Wd. Bunny,” I said, smiling despite my apprehension. “You startled me. What are you doing here?”

The last time a spirit cornered me in the kitchenette, it wasn’t a pleasant [experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18011dv/i_work_at_a_haunted_hotel_and_its_more_dangerous/), but I shouldn’t have been worried about Wd. Bunny. He was the sweetest spirit despite his appearance. He didn’t reply, and I noticed how transparent he was, his silver dull.

“Why are you so clear?” I asked in concern. “Are your guests not getting scared enough?”

Half his eyes looked down while three of his hands fidgeted. “They always want to film their experience.”

“That’s good, isn’t it? It’s free marketing!”

His remaining eyes winced. “I don’t like being filmed.”

“Oh, why?”

A few of his arms shrugged. He never mentioned being camera-shy, but that didn’t need to stop him from scaring up a meal.

“You don’t have to show up to scare them,” I said, settling down on a stool. “I know you chose to look like two of the creepiest things known to man, but you have other ways of scaring people.”

He looked at me with hesitant hope. “I do?”

“Of course. You know Mrs. Coriz adjusted all the leases, you can use physical manipulation now, just don’t damage anything or hurt the guests.”

“I know, but I’m not used to it. I don’t know what to do.” He looked down. “And I’m too embarrassed to ask the other spirits.”

“You shouldn’t be. It’s okay to ask for advice. And I can give you some from a human perspective. Start simple. Make the lights flicker. Turn on the TV, or if it’s on, change the channels or mess with the volume. Adjust the temperature in the room. Make the curtains flutter. Turn on the shower. Stuff like that.”

“That’s enough?”

“Oh, definitely. But don’t do them all at once. Start with a few. Then, pause. That will make the anticipation delicious. Then, hit them with another to make them jump. They’ll love it!”

He licked his lips. “Yeah?”

“I’ll show you. Try it on me, go ahead. Pretend I’m an excited guest filming.” I opened the camera on my phone. “Ooh, I can’t wait until the haunting starts! Where is my mysterious ghost and what are they going to do?”

Wd. Bunny smiled and vanished, and a few seconds later, the light began to flicker.

I gasped and filmed it. “Ooh, is that the ghost or is the bulb going out?”

Just then, the light went out, and I yelped when the faucet gushed open. I jumped off the stool and let out a shaky laugh, only to whip around when the fridge door creaked open, illuminating the room with a faint orange hue. Despite knowing this was all harmless, my heart still raced as I pressed my back to the wall and waited.

And waited.

And waited.

The anticipation was agonizing. Wd. Bunny was following my advice to a T. 

“I guess the ghost is g-gone now,” I said, still filming. “Thank goodne—”

The fridge door slammed shut, and I screamed as something brushed against my legs. I hopped away in an awkward dance, fumbling to open my flashlight, only to wince when the bulb came back to life.

I let out a breathless chuckle as I sat on the stool again, trembling with adrenaline. “That was amazing, Wd. Bunny! You’re a natural!”

He appeared in the doorway again, grinning. “That was the best meal I’ve had in ages!”

“Now imagine how scared the guests will be!”

He licked his lips again, his eyes dancing with opportunities, and I smiled. “Now go up there and give them their money’s worth!”

“Thank you so much for your help!”

“My pleasure! Ooh, wait. You have an old boombox in your room, right?”

He nodded.

“I have a tape in my car of a bunch of creepy songs I recorded last night.”

“A tape?”

“Yeah, a cassette tape. I was thinking of making a copy for every room, but you can try it first! Just hide the boombox somewhere, pop the tape in, and play it at random times. You can even manipulate how fast or slow it plays, or distort it!” I slid off the stool. “Hang on, let me go get it.”

“How do I distort it?” Wd. Bunny asked, following me to the front desk.

“I can show you once I get it. It’s easy!”

Wd. Bunny stayed in the lobby, watching me as I jogged out to the parking lot. After opening my car door, I leaned in to get the tape, and I gasped when something grabbed the back of my shirt, yanked me back, and lifted me up. Wide-eyed, I turned to my attacker, and my heart dropped as I found myself facing a sheer white, indescribable mass of vines.

“Get me in there,” it hissed, its voice reverberating in my head.

A vipirit. I’d never seen one before, but I knew they were as white as spirits were silver.

Panic clashing with determination, I wiggled out of my shirt and left it in the vipirit’s vines as I sprinted towards the hotel. One second, I could see Wd. Bunny pacing anxiously behind the glass door, a second later, all I saw was my car as it fell from the sky and crashed right in front of me. I screamed and skidded to a halt, the momentum sending me tumbling to the ground, and I screamed again as the vipirit grabbed my pant leg and lifted me up.

And up.

And up.

It stopped once it was floating above the hotel, its vine dangling me precariously by a pant leg. 

And I was terrified of heights.

My manic heart was practically dangling out of my mouth as my arms flailed in useless windmills. “Ohhhhmygaaaaaaaaaa!” I panted, my eyes squeezed shut, my lungs spasming as I gasped in what I was certain were my last breaths.

“Get me in there,” it hissed again.

“I can’t! I can’t!” I yelled.

I screamed as it shook me, my pants sliding past my waist. My terror surging, my hands shot up and grabbed the fabric tight, my muscles quivering as I strained to keep myself from slipping out. Blood rushed down to my head and my pulse hammered against my skull, my breaths stuttering as I kept my eyes shut tight.

“You can,” it said. “Remove the protection.”

“I didn’t put it there!”

“Who did?”

“I’m not telling you!”

It shook me again, and I was pretty sure I felt my soul temporarily leave my body as a deathly chill coursed through every one of my tense cells. I was going to die. There was no question about it. None of the spirits were going to risk facing a vipirit, and I wouldn’t want them to. And even if they called Mrs. Coriz, she wouldn’t be able to save me.

“Tell me,” it growled.

This was the job I signed up for, protecting the spirits and Mrs. Coriz, and I wasn’t going to let them down.

“N-Never,” I said, jutting my jaw as I uttered the last word I imagined saying.

My entire organs lodged in my throat as I found myself in freefall, unable to scream or even breath as the wind whistled past my flailing, plummeting body.

This was it.

Any second now, I was going to be nothing more than a puddle of bone and flesh on the asphalt below. 

A powerful force pressed against my stomach, and I grunted as I was jerked to the side, my heart barely following. My confusion overpowering, I dared open my eyes, and I gasped as I saw Wd. Bunny grabbing on to the waist of my pants as he zipped through the air, dodging the vipirit in pursuit.

“Wd. Bunny! No! It’ll get you!” I cried out, flopping around like a ragdoll in his grip.

“We’ll make it!” he said, dipping closer to the ground.

He made a mad dash towards the hotel, and I glimpsed a few other spirits in the lobby, holding the door open. We all screamed as the vipirit let out an ear-piercing screech that was too close for comfort, and I squeezed my eyes as I prayed we’d make it through safely.

I let out a yelp of pain as I crashed and tumbled, and I opened my eyes to find myself facedown on a wooden floor. The lobby floor. Wd. Bunny was floating beside me. We’d made it. 

Trembling, I sat up and turned to the door, watching in terrified relief as the vipirit tried in vain to follow us, Mrs. Coriz’s protection preventing it from doing so. Wd. Rowena mocked it, while Wd. Dolor and Wd. Lýkos shied away, scared despite their safety.

Wd. Layl and Wd. Cobra comforted Wd. Bunny and me, letting us know they called Mrs. Coriz right away, and I thanked them as Wd. Chikara draped a blanket over my shoulders and Wd. Vinashak brought me some herbal tea.

But my deepest gratitude was for Wd. Bunny. “You risked everything to save me,” I whispered, turning to him. “I owe you my life.”

“You were ready to die for us,” he said, his silver flickering with his own fear.

“That’s my job.”

“But it’s not your time. We need you. Mrs. Coriz needs you.”

Tears welled in my eyes. “Thank you.”

A pained screech turned our attention to the door, and we watched in awe as Mrs. Coriz marched up to the vipirit, her hands up, each holding a strange object. She seemed to say something while waving them, and the vipirit shrieked and writhed, trembling as it coiled itself tighter and tighter. Soon it was no bigger than a bright white volleyball, and I flinched as it exploded into a million luminescent shards that dissipated into the night.

The spirits cheered, and then they all vanished as I heard footsteps coming down the staircase. I looked up to see a guest hesitantly peeking down, confusion written all over his face.

“Is everything okay?” he asked, nervous.

“Yes,” I said, standing up on shaky legs. “Do you require any assistance?”

“No, we just heard a ruckus down here and got worried.”

“Don’t worry, it’s all part of the experience,” I said, managing a smile.

“Oh.” He let out a relieved chuckle. “Awesome. You guys really know how to set the mood.”

“Glad to hear it! Enjoy the rest of your stay!”

“We definitely will!”

He went back upstairs, and my smile dropped as I stumbled over and sat on one of the lobby couches. I was still trembling, and my heart felt like it would never slow down. I looked up as Mrs. Coriz entered the hotel, and I wiped away fresh tears when she sat beside me.

“Are you alright?” she asked, adjusting the blanket around my shoulders.

I shook my head.

“Your bravery has not gone unnoticed, and I will replace your car. The vipirits are becoming bolder, which means we must become more cautious.”

“Can you teach me how to do what you did?” I asked, turning to her with hope.

She sighed and looked down, adjusting her bracelets. “I have always been told it is an innate ability passed on through family and honed through practice.”

My face fell. “Oh …”

“But I don’t see why it cannot be taught,” she continued. “And I don’t see why you cannot be family.”

I looked back at her in confusion. “What do you mean?”

“I believe the bonds formed between people are stronger than genetics, and I see you as more than an employee. You are family. I am even ready to adopt you and cement your presence in the Coriz family. This way, you can become partner in accordance with the rules of the hotel.”

I stared at her, my mouth hanging open at the barrage of news that seemed way too good to be true. Family? Adoption? Partner? Me?

“You … really want to adopt me?” I asked, my voice shaking with emotion. “Are you sure?”

“Yes, I am. You never knew your parents, and I never had children. People rarely get to choose who they are related to, but we can.  I would be very proud to be your mother.”

I smiled through my tears. “And I’d be very proud to be your kid.”
