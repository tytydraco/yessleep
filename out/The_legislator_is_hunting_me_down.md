“How much more are you going to handle?” I faced the facts and asked myself this, and I ultimately did what had to be done.

For a menial job, I was surprisingly content on my way to work that day. It feels like forever, but it was only two weeks ago. It was a nice, cool fall morning, coffee in hand, walking down the sidewalk in Downtown Albany - the heart of New York State’s Capital Region. Nothing is glamorous about Albany though, but I’m okay with that.

It was my first job out of college, just to have some cash coming in. I worked in the bowels of the legislative office building; the mailroom. It was a very typical, bustling mailroom you may see in movies. It matched the fast-paced political environment it was contained within—no time for making personal connections, or active listening. Just go, go, go.

I walked through the side entrance to the legislative building I normally walk through. The two security guards, Rick and Johnny were there. I walked through the metal detector, it went off because of my belt or something. They never cared anyway, I just walked on through with my coffee which they also shouldn’t have let me bring in.

Rick greeted me. “Zack, rise and shine. How’s it going?”

I replied, “Not much. Headin’ downstairs.”

Johnny asked, “Are you meeting us for lunch?”

I replied, “Depends how busy today is. But I’ll talk to you later.”

I headed down the stairs, four short flights before entering the swinging doors of the mailroom.

It was much busier than normal. Everyone was sorting through boxes on boxes of mail. On top of this, a mail truck was backing up into the loading port to drop off more mail. My boss, Don, a bald, angry Italian-American man, was on the phone attached to the wall.

Don spoke, irritated and in a hurry, so nothing out of the ordinary. “No. No way. We are at capacity right now. We can’t do that. (pause for reply) I’m balls-deep in mail and print orders, it’s not happening Paul. (pause for reply) It’s in the budget? What are you talking about? I’m talking to you on a corded phone like it’s the 1950’s. (pause for reply) Alright, bye.”

Don hung up the phone and saw that I had just walked in. “Don’t get comfortable Zack, I’m sending you upstairs. Chug that coffee or throw it out, then come with me.” Don belittlingly clapped his hands a few times to signal me to keep it moving, as you would to a dog or cattle.

I chugged my coffee, threw it out, and started walking to Don’s office. I walked past Carl, who I met when I first started working there. We got close and created moments of fun in this tedious job of ours. Carl smirked at me knowing I was already overwhelmed with the work day.

“Buckle-up” Carl said. When I walked into Don’s office, he pointed to three large boxes that were stacked on top of each other.

“The top one is mail for the fourth floor. The middle one is a print order for Room 915, the bottom for Room 917. Put them on a dolly and head on up. Come right back down when you’re done. We’re swamped.” I nodded and grabbed a dolly. I got dizzy for a moment. The hecticness must have really getting to me already.

While restacking the boxes, I got curious and opened the ones that were print orders. Both were rally or protest signs legislators ordered. Room 915’s had signs that read “Defund the MTA!” while room 917’s had signs that read “Black Cops Matter!” I sighed, politically exhausted like everyone else in this state and country, and closed up the boxes. I went to the elevator with the dolly to the fourth floor.

I was particularly excited that I got assigned to deliver mail on the fourth floor. That’s where Jacob works - for Legislator Brunsfield’s office. He’s a receptionist. Even in that role, he particularly has it rough; being in the trenches of politics. I get to retreat to the basement while he has to stay in the middle of it all for eight hours. I’ve had a crush on him at this point for quite some time now and it’s clear the feeling is mutual. I’m going to ask him out on a date soon, I just have to find the time.

While handing out mail, making my way down the hall to Jacob’s office, Legislator Brunsfield happened to speed walk by in an oversized and ill-fitting suit, fumbling with some papers in a stack he was holding. He slowed down momentarily when he saw me.

“Ah, Zack. You can give anything you have to Jacob. Also, can you keep an eye out for a large manila envelope? I’m expecting something important.”

The legislator kept on walking. I replied back to myself sarcastically in a whisper. “Yeah, I’ll sit still and wait patiently for it.”

I finally got to the legislator’s office. I left the dolly outside next to the door and walked in. Jacob stopped what he was doing, saw me, and gave me a warm smile from the front desk. I tried not to get flustered. I gave him a slight smile back.

“Busy day for you too?” I said.

In a flirty, teasing way Jacob replied. “Not at all, pretty calm actually.”

I replied back in the same way. “Your boss is busy, rushing to a meeting, and you’re in here doing nothing?”

Jacob rolled his eyes in response. “He barely knows where he’s going half the time. I had to tell him to tie his shoes like a toddler before he left.”

The phone rang. “One sec” Jacob said, and answered the phone. 

“Legislator Brunsfield’s office? (pause for reply) No. No we oppose the bill. (pause for reply) I mean I can send you to his Legislative Director, but she’s going to tell you the same thing. (pause for reply) I know because you’re not the first person to ask. (Pause for reply) Ok, thanks.”

Jacob hung up the phone. “Nothin’ like being called an asshole before nine in the morning”

He continued. “You have mail for me?”

“Nothin’” I said.

Really? Do you have a large manila envelope by any chance?”

I replied “I’m aware, but no.”

Jacob smirked. “Where are you heading to now? Or can you stay and chat for a bit?” 

“Sorry, I’m heading to the ninth floor. I have some print orders to deliver.”

After I said this, I got dizzy again. So Jacob wouldn’t notice I was trying to catch my balance, I put my hand on the wall to “casually” lean on it. It went away after a few seconds.

“For who?” Jacob asked.

“915 and 917” I replied.

Jacob’s smile vanished. His eyes went wide but only for a moment. He knew he was making a face but tried to hide it. His face almost immediately went flush. Pale. He looked sick, like he was going to throw up.

“I… I’ll talk to you later” Jacob said. As he finished his sentence, the phone rang again. Jacob eagerly picked it up to get out of talking to me. He even turned his head and body partially away from me. It was so unlike him. Clearly it had to do with the rooms I was delivering print orders to. But such a strong response to it was concerning.

Surprised by Jacob’s bizarre behavior and how I didn’t want to bother him by waiting for the phone call to end, I just left. I got the dolly and got on the elevator again to the ninth floor.

I stepped out of the elevator and headed to room 915. While wheeling the dolly there, I realized, out of all the offices I’ve delivered mail to, these two rooms I don’t believe I’ve ever been to. A weird coincidence I guess. But I’ve delivered mail on the ninth floor a million times. I brushed it off and kept walking down the hall.

When I got to room 915, the door was already open. I went in and saw a woman around my age at the front desk.

“Hello. You sent in a print order?” I said. The woman at the front desk replied, seemingly excited to see me.

“Hi, yes, or I guess so. I wasn’t the one that placed it. You can put it right here on my desk.” After I put the box of “Defund the MTA!” signs on her desk, she extended her hand.

“Thank you so much. I’m Samantha.”

“Zack” I replied and shook her hand. She opened the box infront of me and her smile went away as she groaned.

“Oh god, not this” Samantha said, referencing the topic of the rally signs.

“It’s so embarrassing we’re supporting this. Ugh. Add that to the list of issues.”

I paused before replying. “...Then why do you work for this legislator?”

Samantha ignored my question as though she’d been asked that before. She went back to her chipper mood. “Well, thanks again” she said. She saw the last box I had on the dolly.

“Is that for us too?”

I got dizzy again. This was very strange for me. I figured it was probably just coffee being the only thing in my system. It went away before I needed to sit or lean up against something.

“No” I replied. “It’s for next door, 917.”

Samantha went silent. Immediately, an anxious energy washed over her that she was failing to cover up, just like Jacob. She tried to say the following smoothly, but it came out all choppy. She put on a forced smile with it to try and blunt the clear discomfort. “O…Ok. If… I’ll let you get back to your day. Thank you.”

She immediately started to walk behind me to usher me out the door. Once my full body and the dolly were outside the office, she quickly closed the door. What alarmed me the most, besides her and Jacob’s strong initial reactions to, now realizing, specifically room 917, was that after Samantha closed the door, I could hear her softly begin to cry.

I was scared. I was mostly confused, but now I was scared. Maybe I am unaffected. Maybe they are just experiencing something in the political realm that to me will just be interpreted as a rude legislator to interact with. Maybe he voted for or against something recently that is invoking an emotional reaction in them. I don’t know. I’m just delivering a print order. 

I went next door to room 917 and knocked. “Hello. Print delivery.” No one answered. I opened the unlocked door and went inside with the dolly.

No one was at the front desk. I heard talking from within the office, but didn’t know where it was coming from. Completely strange, the white, fluorescent lights of the main room I was in turned red. I wondered if that was an odd choice the office made, or… an electrical issue? That’s stupid. I don’t know why red lights would be here.

I opened a door within the office and saw it was the office’s conference room. It was empty. The lights in the conference room also turned red. I just closed the door. I wanted to get out of the office ASAP. 

I walked toward a back room and realized that was where the talking was coming from. The conversation was tense. Angry. As I got closer, I saw the door where the talking was coming from was half open. The lights in that room were already red.

It was weird. My ears started to have a very slight ringing, while simultaneously, the feeling I had was like I had placed a small amount of cotton balls in them. I told myself that this and the dizziness must be dehydration. I told myself I would grab a water bottle after I dropped off this print order.

There also seemed to be a heat coming from this backroom as I got closer. The heat came in waves. Or pulsating vibrations. The legislature is an old building. It was probably just how the heat was being pumped into the office. Or maybe another symptom I was having.

From around the corner, I saw who I believe to be the legislator of room 917. He was standing behind a desk. Across from him sat a man in a pin-striped suit, facing away from me. On the ground, I could partially see a man around my age. He was sobbing. The legislator began to beat the man on the ground with a belt as the man attempted to shield himself with his arm.

“What did I say? What did I tell you?” The legislator said.

The man on the ground replied. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know.”

“How could you not know you fucking idiot? How could you?”

The man on the ground persisted in apologizing. “I didn’t know. I’m sorry.”

“Now I have to fix this” the legislator said. 

Referencing the man sitting in the chair, the legislator continued. “This is embarrassing. Do you know how this makes me look?”

While looking briefly at the man in the chair, the legislator saw me looking from around the corner. The man on the ground sees me too. Laying there on his side, still shielding himself, he gave me a sad yet intense look that could only be interpreted as one word, or at least how I felt it to be - Run.

I bolted out of the office. I left my dolly there with the print order still on it. I needed to find somewhere quick to hide. My immediate reaction was to go back to room 915 since it was right there, and that’s exactly what I did. I ran in and closed the door back behind me. I leaned up against the door. Frozen.

Samantha was at her desk. She was of course startled. Trying to process what I just witnessed, I could still connect the dots. She was surprised, but not shocked. We looked at each other in silence for maybe two seconds, but as cliche as it was, it seemed like an eternity.

“Run” she said, her voice shaking, but attempting to be as supportive as possible. I couldn’t help it, I still remained frozen.

She said more assertive. “Run.”

I didn’t even bother to check first to see if the legislator, or even the other man that was sitting with him was in the hallway. I just ran. I ran toward the stairwell. The adrenaline had me easily running all the way down from the ninth floor back to the main floor where I entered the building for work.

I went to the security checkpoint I entered. I was looking for Rick and Johnny. They’re security, they would know how to handle this. But, they weren’t there. In fact, no one was there. The normally busiest floor of the legislative building, filled with staffers, building workers, tourists, and protestors, was completely empty.

“Hello?” I yelled. My voice echoed. My confusion and fear only worsened. Where is everyone? Was there some sort of evacuation? A fire? A gas leak? An active shooter? I kept running, down the stairs to the mailroom.

I went through the swinging doors and there he was, standing there across the room. The legislator. His feet were planted firmly on the floor, arms crossed. I know it’s an odd way to describe it, but he looked like an angry, disappointed father. Only Carl was in the mailroom with him. Don and all of the other mailroom workers were gone. Carl was sorting through mail in the same spot I had seen him before.

Carl saw me standing near the door, looking back and forth between him and the legislator. Carl said nothing. What the Hell is happening?

All I could muster to Carl was “Have you seen Don?”

Carl replied “He went upstairs. I think he went to the HR office for something. He should be back in a moment.” At this point, I couldn’t believe I was able to panic even more. I ran away, back upstairs. Maybe Rick and Johnny would be back at their post. Maybe I could find Don.

I got to the main floor. Still, not a single person was there. I got dizzy again. This time, it was severe. I fell but stopped myself from hitting the ground with both hands.

There, was a gun. In the middle of the cold marble floor lay a handgun. After my dizziness subsided, I looked around. Was someone waiting for me to pick it up? I slowly approached the gun, looked around again, and picked it up. I took the magazine out. It had exactly two bullets. 

My confusion and fear transformed. I was now furious. I’m just a mailroom worker. Clearly, the legislator was doing all of this. How so quickly, I’m unsure. After witnessing his violent act, I realized I could not avoid his sudden, orchestrated revenge toward me. To silence me. He clearly planted this gun. If he wanted to play this game with me, I was going to make sure he regretted it. I wasn’t going to “handle” this cowardly. I was going to stand up for myself.

Gun in hand, I went back down to the mailroom. Though the legislator could have taken the elevator upstairs, the mailroom elevator was designated for mailroom personnel only through specialized keys that needed to be turned before pressing floor buttons. I didn’t see him come up the stairs, so I was almost certain the legislator was still down there. Waiting for me. So, I went to him.

When I got back to the mailroom, my anger only worsened. Where the legislator was, standing in the same way, was the man in the pinned-striped suit. Again, he was facing away from me. Carl was still nonchalantly sorting through mail. The man, still facing away from me, pulled out a handgun from his suit jacket pocket and held it to his side. I shot.

I hit the man in the leg. He fell to the ground. Carl covered his head and ducked under the table he was working at. In my path of fury, I must have not seen the legislator hiding in the corner of the mailroom behind me. He charged. I held my gun up, ready to shoot, but he got me before I fired. He tackled me to the ground, and that’s all I remember before things went black.

I woke up to the sound of knocking and a heavy metal door opening.

“Wake up” a man said.

“Your lawyer is here to see you.” The man who opened the door was a police officer. I was in a jail cell. I was extremely groggy and exhausted. I had no more fight in me. My anger went back to confusion, and the exhaustion had replaced my fear. I came out of the cell and started walking to another room with a man who was standing next to the cop.

“Hi Zack” the man said.

“I’m a public defender. I’ve been assigned to your case.”

When we got to a room to speak privately, he explained to me what he read in the police reports, and I explained to him what happened to me. My version.

What my lawyer told me was when I had entered the legislative building to go to work I had a handgun hidden on me. The security guards, Rick and Johnny, who I have known for a bit now, did not pat me down when I set off the metal detector. Both Rick and Johnny were arrested and charged with crimes related to failing to uphold their duties, especially in a government building. Some sort of criminal negligence charges.

With the gun apparently under my shirt, I just started my work day. Security cameras saw me go to the mailroom, leave, deliver mail to the fourth floor, go into Legislator Brunsfield’s office, then head to the ninth floor to deliver the print orders. Well, my lawyer told me I had only one print order, for room 915. The cameras saw me go to room 915, drop off the print order, and then I went back in the elevator, down to the mailroom.

I was told I then dropped my dolly off and walked back up the stairs to the main floor, where I then… stood there. I stood there and did nothing for a full minute, people walking around me, looking at me wondering what I was doing. I then walked back downstairs to the mailroom where I was told I then shot Don in the leg. Before I could shoot anyone else, multiple of my co-workers in the mailroom tackled and subdued me.

My lawyer listened to my experience. What I went through. He really did listen. In the defense of my case, my lawyer decided it was best to go with exactly that. My experience. I learned more during the three-day trial when witnesses were called to the stand. The witnesses were everyone I interacted with that day and more.

Legislator Brunsfield was one of the first witnesses. When questioned by both the prosecutor and my attorney, he reiterated multiple times “The security footage shows I never interacted with Mr. Micall (me) that day, nor was I even at the legislature.” Legislator Brunsfield stated he was at a public campaign event during the hours I was a work. His alibi checked out as the press were there covering it.

Jacob was called to the stand after his boss was questioned. I for sure thought Jacob would understand what went through. Sitting there while being asked questions, his eyes would dart back to me and the person questioning him. He looked scared. Disturbed. I realized he was scared of me. My heart sunk into itself. 

He told the prosecutor when I came in to drop off mail to Legislator Brunsfield’s office that I seemed anxious and handed him a large manila envelope and left without saying a word. When he opened the envelope, there was only one piece of copy paper in it. One big word was written, traced over and over again with a pen - Run. Jacob said he thought it was very strange, but that maybe I was playing some weird game with him. He said he was going to ask me about it the next time I dropped by the office. But of course, that next time never came. Jacob said he should have taken it seriously and began to tear up.

When Samantha took the stand, she said I also seemed anxious. Samantha said that since we had never met before, she introduced herself, but that I didn’t respond and I just left the office after I dropped off the box.

Who took the stand next, though only briefly, was the legislator. The one from room 917. I learned then his last name was Vellar. He did not look like either of the three men I saw in the office that day. Though he was not scared like Jacob was, he was clearly also disturbed. He said while being questioned that he was shocked that “Mr. Micall wanted to hurt me” because, one, he and I had never met before, and two, the day this all transpired was a fairly normal day for him. He was shaken up at the fact that he had no idea he was in possible danger. Security footage apparently showed that I never even stepped foot in his office.

Carl took the stand next. Confusion is really the theme of all of this, and that’s exactly how he looked. Sad and confused, at me. Carl described like the rest of them that I came to work seemingly anxious and hyperaware of my surroundings. The only thing Carl said that I said to him that day was “Morning” in response to Carl saying good morning to me. The next time he saw me was after he ducked under the table when I fired the gun, shooting Don.

Don walked, or moreso hobbled in with a full-leg cast on with a set of crutches. The court transcriber had to get up to help him in and out of the witness booth. Don said he was really busy that day and wasn’t paying that much attention to my behavior when I got to work. Overall, he said I seemed fine. When I got back to the mailroom, Don said he saw me standing at the doorway doing nothing. Just staring at him from across the room. But before he could ask me what was wrong or why I was just staring at him, I pulled out the gun and shot him in the leg.

I don’t know why they were saving Rick and Johnny for last, but they did. Rick and Johnny came in individually, in their prison/jail jumpsuits, handcuffed. They both said the same thing. That I seemed off, that Rick said good morning to me, and that I didn’t respond. They both admitted that neither of them did anything when I set off the metal detector because they would never suspect me of causing any harm.

From there, multiple people in the mailroom were questioned. I kind of spaced out from there. The consensus of what they were saying was that it was a normal work day up until then. Of five of my co-workers questioned, three were part of the group that supposedly tackled me and got the gun out of my hand. They also said that they noticed that I went limp and unconscious before I hit the ground, which was confirmed by the doctor who examined me and said I had no head trauma, meaning my head didn’t hit the ground; at least not severely when I was tackled.

My lawyer was very smart. He was compassionate, but he knew he didn’t want me to know that he didn’t believe my story either, like everyone else. I didn’t even realize till the trial neared its conclusion that my lawyer was pleading guilty by insanity on my behalf. The prosecutors didn’t accept that as a plea deal. Due to my prior lack of mental health history, they argued that this was a premeditated act though for an unknown reason. They tried to push the “over-worked, angry at my boss” motive, but it seemed to go nowhere.

This was a non-jury trial, so the judge had the final say. She found me guilty by insanity, on two counts of attempted second-degree murder as a first-time offender; shooting Don, and aiming my gun at my co-workers. Now, here I am. Writing from a psych institution where I am to stay for 12 consecutive years. It truly sucks. They treat everyone the same whether you’re writhing on the ground screaming and having a mental breakdown, or completely sane like me.

That was not how the day played out. What everyone said happened is not what happened. I was being hunted down for seeing something I shouldn’t have. I’m still being hunted down. 

I was lucky enough in general, but especially on the 4th floor, to get a room here that has a window. As I write this, he’s looking at me. Arms crossed, the real legislator is standing on the ground outside my window looking up at me.  He wants his revenge, and I’m not going to let him have it. I’m not going to just “handle” this and live in fear. Once I get out of here, I’m going to make sure he can’t hurt me or anyone else any longer.
