Hello, I wasn’t sure where to post this but this subreddit felt like the right place, I use to think all the stories on this subreddit where bs but after the past few months I’ve got a dam good reason to suspect that some of them are true at least for the most part

This all started about two months ago, for context I live my mentally I’ll mother who suffers from contamination ocd, which unlike most people believe ocd isn’t a quirky little behaviour like wanting photos to be hung up straight 

It can be and is this case be hugely detrimental to the person suffering and the people around ( me ) since before I could remember I also avoided touching trash or anything that was on the ground when in view of my mother

This has caused some resentment between me and my mother with her poor eyesight and unwillingness to believe anything she didn’t see caused several occasions when I have been near something and she thinks I’m touching it 

So I would be force to go for a shower before I’m allowed to touch anything, recently she had began putting trash in a big pile in the lounge room in front of the chair that serves as my bed as due to her believing my bed is contaminated I have been forced to improvise using a old oversized jumper as a blanket 

Most of my days consisted of jumping over mount trashmore as I called it, getting food and doing what exercise I could before my mom woke up and I would have to begin my mindless binge of YouTube and reddit

Most of the time I kept my headphones in for days at a time, I wouldn’t be mentioning this except I distinctly remember taking my headphones out, if I hadn’t just assumed I imagined this then things might have worked out differently 

I was binging YouTube before I had gotten up to go to the bathroom stepping over mount trashmore before walking into the kitchen and hearing a sound of movement in the lounge room 

I step into the lounge room doorway to look around and heard the sound of something small hitting the floor behind me in the kitchen, my head had darted back to see what it was and spotted one of my head phones on the floor

My moms darted into the kitchen seeing the headphone on the floor she began to berate me saying how much this will effect her plans now that she had to clean the kitchen top to bottom because the head phone might of hit something 

I sighed before saying it wouldn’t have hit anything it was in the middle of the room and it would have just fell out my ear when I was walking
 
Sadly I’ll have to split my story up but it should be don’t in one or two more post, I’ve got to go anyway my grandma is coming to pick me up, it’s been a while since I’ve seen her
