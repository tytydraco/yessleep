The body in the trunk of my car is starting to stink, I expected it to take a lot longer but I guess the heat accelerated the process. I should probably start at the beginning, it's been a hell of a night.

It had been about 2 hours since we left my house. The more I thought about the events that had occurred the less sense it made to me.

 I had childhood memories of john, he was my brother. I was sure of that.  I'm not quite sure what Rachel had slipped into my pocket or pulled out of my pocket or whatever the hell she did but the phone in my hand isn’t mine. 

Sure everything on it was the same, almost like an exact clone but the texture, the feel of it. It just wasn't quite right.

Rachel spoke up, “I know what you're thinking, you have these memories, you have all this going on but you have to trust me. John isn't who you think he is”. She stared ahead as she drove. “These things, the tentacle monsters not only can they imitate people they have a little bit of telepathic abilities. They can mess with memories they can even get a gist of what your thinking. That's why I had to get you away from him, the more time you spend apart the clearer your thoughts will be”.  “Where are you taking me?” I asked. “I can't tell you” she said. “why not?” “I don't know how strong the connection is between you and that thing in your house. If I tell you where we're going it might be able to get an idea and follow us there. In fact I should probably blindfold you just so it can't guess where we are and attack us or ambush us”.

I was not okay with this idea, but as I had learned earlier she could kick my ass so there wasn’t really a point in trying to refuse. 

Next thing I knew we were cruising down what I assume was still the highway, me blindfolded and her playing music on the radio. I had to get out of this car, I wasn't even sure where I was but anywhere was better than in here. 

The car began to bump and make noises, we had pulled off the road. My heart began to beat wildly, this was it, this was either where I met my end for where Rachel proved herself trustworthy. 

I took off the blindfold and looked around Rachel smacked me in the arm “hey put that back on”. Her tone was less than friendly. “Why?” I asked, “if I don't know where we are how could he know where I am by seeing what I see or seeing what I think I see or however the hell that shit works?” “Fine” she said. “Let's just get inside”. 

There was another crappy looking house in front of us, I was not a fan of how things went down last time I followed Rachel into a shit hole house. “Why don’t I just stay in the car?” 

Rachel glared at me, it was clear that I was getting on her nerves. “Dax get the fuck out of the car”. I held up my hands and resignation before opening the door and stepping out, the yard was overgrown and the entire property was surrounded by trees. Behind us strung a long gravel driveway and in front of me stood a small two-story farmhouse with no windows or paint, behind it dilapidated looking shed sat in the back.

“Rachel” I began, “this place gives me the creeps, what are we doing here?” She ignored me, she went to the back of the car and opened up the trunk, from inside she removed a baseball bat and a roll of duct tape. I was officially freaked out. I started to back away and she pointed the bat at me, “don't”. 

I froze “Rachel what are you doing?” I asked slowly. She rested a hand on her hip and gave me an exasperated look, “would you just calm down? Seriously if I wanted to hurt you or kill you wouldn't I have already done it? I've been risking myself to keep you alive okay? A little gratitude would go a long way”. 

I wasn't sure if I believed her, actually no I was pretty sure I didn't believe her. but I didn't have much of a choice either and figured if I played along she was more likely to let me live a little longer. I don't know what she had going on with these tentacle monsters but I was not a fan of this situation.

Rachel caught me off guard when she threw the baseball bat to me, I caught it and I eyed her suspiciously, “what’s this for?” “What do you think it's for dumbass? In case something comes at you, you can whack it between the eyes. I've got my handgun but there's only the one and I'm sure not going to give it up”. “And the duct tape?” I asked. “It’ll come in handy later, first let’s get settled in, we're going to spend the night here and then take off again come morning”. 

Once again I was thrown for a loop, on the one hand Rachel was saying unbelievable things that I couldn't fathom. But on the other hand she just handed me a weapon and told me to defend myself I needed to. If she was out to deliver me to a tentacle monster, or if she was one herself why would she give me something to fight back with? But if she wasn't, and she was actually on my side trying to help me then that meant.. well I didn't really want to think about what that meant. 

Inside the house was as desolate and worn as the outside, all except one room. There was a bedroom in the back of the house that had a bed, a couch and some other odds and end.  Clearly somebody had been using it for sleeping quarters.” Have you been living here?” I asked. Rachel shook her head, “no, but I set it up in case I ever needed to”. “In case something like this happened?” I asked. She simply nodded. 

“Where have you been? Like what happened to you? How did you end up in all this?” I flung my hands around. Rachel's sighed, she sat on the bed and rested her head on her hands. She looked tired, more than just physically tired. She looked aged and worn.

“I guess I owe you some sort of explanation huh?” She looked up at me and made an attempt at a smile before giving up. “That night, the one where I invited you over to watch a movie. That wasn't the first night something like that happened. I know that this is going to sound horrible, and rightfully you’ll be mad but that happened to me before. I just didn't think it was real”. 

She was quiet for a bit, just looking at the blank wall. “I wasn't really much of a social person before college, I was a bit sheltered. A couple guys asked me to come hang out at a party, I figured why not? I kind of knew them, we'd seen each other at class, we talked we even hung out once before. Well one thing led to another, people kept giving me shots, and that led to ripping on a bong and then taking some hits of acid”. 

“I was pretty messed up, at least I think I was. I had never not been sober before. So when some of the people in the group started backing up against walls I just kind of zoned out. Even when, well you know, even when they exploded those things out I just stood there. I didn't move I didn't react I just stood there. They grabbed people, held them down and and, oh God, and they forced their mouths open and shoved these weird egg like embryo things into their throats”.

 She shuddered at the memory. “I don't really remember what happened after that. I just know I woke up on the floor and everybody around me was making fun of me for being a lightweight. I want to say that everybody was the same but they weren't. There were red flags that I should have paid attention to, there was little things that didn't quite fit, but I didn't want to see I wanted it all to be a dream I wanted it to be fake I didn't want to have to deal with the thought of it being real. So I ignored it. And now you are paying the price”. 

I thought about her story for a while. It sounded plausible enough, unfortunately believing her meant that I would have to face the fact that everything that I experienced the last two days actually happened. But I guess I was going to have to deal with that at some point anyways. 

Rachel looked completely worn out, she looked older than I remembered. Even from when she had came to my door two days ago she seemed to have aged. So when she lay down on the bed and rolled facing away from me I didn't bother her. I just sat on the sofa and contemplated all the crap I had gone through. 

If I hadn't been sitting there awake I never would have heard the footsteps on the gravel outside, my first thought was the gun in Rachel's waistband. But it was shoved down the front of her pants and there was no way I was grabbing it without waking her. Nor did I trust her enough to wake her up and tell her that there might be somebody outside. So I did the next best thing, I grabbed the baseball bat and I made my way out of the bedroom. 

The house was pitch black, nothing was moving except the shadows of the trees outside. 

The moon let off with light to navigate by. The sound had since stopped but I was certain of what I had heard. Bat held firmly I made my way to the door. 

I winced with each creak of the floor boards, the sounds seemingly deafening in the eerie silence. 

My arms were trembling and my throat felt tight, it was difficult to breath which was not helping my anxiety. 

My heart beat was audible but at least it was steady if a bit fast. 

I reached out to the front door, it glided open without a sound. Stepping outside I looked across the overgrown lawn. There was just enough of a breeze to stir the tall, dead grass. Each time it rustled I swore there was something moving inside it. 

I hesitated to step down from the front porch, irrationally I felt like something was going to grab me from beneath and pull me under. 

Maybe it wasn’t irrational. 

Gritting my teeth I jumped from the porch, mid air I spun around with the bat held high! 

Under the porch was vacant. I sighed in relief. I wanted to go back inside, to just ignore what I had heard but I knew that wasn’t the right option. So I pushed forward. 

I walked alongside the house careful to scan the area before moving on. I circled the house without incident. I was starting to calm down, perhaps the entire thing had been in my head. 

The only place left to check was the shed, I was painfully aware of how loud the dry grass crunching under my feet was. There was no way anything hiding in there wouldn’t know I was coming. 

I tentatively tugged on the door, it was stuck tight. The ground had swelled locking the door in place. That was all I needed, the coast was clear. I turned back to the house. 

Fuck me sideways, standing next to the house was a figure. Its identity was hidden by the shadow being cast by the house itself. We both stood there watching one another. 

I raised the bat “who’s there?” I tried to sound authoritative but it came out as an almost unintelligible squeak. 

The figure came closer, it had a familiar hobble to it’s stride. 

Even before he stepped into the moon light I knew it was John. I gasped when I saw him, his hair was matted down. He had a head wound that I could see even at a distance. His left eye was swollen nearly shut. His clothes were torn and stained and he was missing his prosthetic foot. 

“Alright chucklefuck, we’re going to get out of here and then I’m going to kick your ass for dragging me into this crap”. I was frozen, John was the last person I had expected to see. 

He still held his shotgun but it wasn’t pointed at me. I tried to think back to my memories of him and I growing up, was he really my brother? Was Rachel the one lying? 

I had memories, there was no doubt about that. But they weren’t as clear as they should have been. Or maybe they were, John wasn’t around much. He was five years older and we didn’t hang out a lot growing up. 

He was getting impatient, “let’s go Dax. Where’s the bitch at?” I didn’t like him calling Rachel that, but it fit with the character I thought I knew. 

“She’s inside sleeping”. He glanced at the house behind him. “And is she one of these squid things?” 

I took a step back “how do you know about that?” He growled, “take a look dumbass, two of those fuckers came in after that girl took you and tried to violate me hentai style. It didn’t go well for them. No more talking, let’s get out of here”. 

I saw movement behind John, it was Rachel! She raised her gun up pointing it at the back of his head. I yelled out “no! Rachel don’t!” 

John spun around and leveled the shotgun at Rachel. “Guys please!” I begged “both of you put the guns down!” 

John snorted, “so she can squid me? No thanks, she ain’t cute enough to pull that off”. 

“you know you can’t trust him Dax, let’s get out of here before the rest show up”. John looked offended, “he can’t trust me? I’ve been looking out for him his entire life! Dax who gave you a place to live? Who drove you to interviews? Bailed you out of the drunk tank?” 

My head hurt, I had so many memories pushing and pulling. Some I knew were fake, others were damn convincing. But I now knew who was manipulating me. 

“Well?” John demanded. “Are you going to pick some girl over family?” I walked up to John, I knew what needed doing. 

“Give me the gun John”. He looked shocked. Rachel must have sensed what I was up to, I saw her finger drop onto the trigger. I threw my shoulder into John knocking us both to the ground. 

A bullet whizzed over us. John swung the shotgun over and fired a single shot. 

Blood and gore blasted across the wall behind Rachel. She dropped her gun and fell to her knees, she clamped both hands around the grisly mess that used to be her neck. 

The terror and betrayal in her eyes froze me. John was back on his feet, his face as cold as stone. He grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me past Rachel. She had dropped to her hands and knees, the noises she was making would stick with me forever. Blood poured freely from between her fingers as she gurgled for air.

My ears were ringing and my head was so clouded I couldn’t focus. John had me in the car and back on the road in no time. 

I felt vomit rising inside me. I barely got the window open in time. I felt John’s hand pat me on the back. “Hang in there little bro, just… just breath”. 

We’ve been driving for hours, I don’t know where we’re going. My memories of John have grown clear while those of Rachel are fuzzy. 

I want to sleep but every time I close my eyes I see her face.

And I learned why are car was starting to smell. John had the bodies of two of those things in the trunk. He’s got some sort of plan, at least I hope he does because I sure don’t. 

John thinks we should ditch the car, our phones and even our clothes so I don’t know if I’ll be updating again. Stay safe out there.
