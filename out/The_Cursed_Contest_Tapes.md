Hey, everyone. It's been a while since I uploaded here.  For those of you wondering who I am, call me Zane. To give a brief rundown, I work as a research assistant to a man named Dean. We’re employed by a specific government branch that deals with the supernatural. Last time I talked about my first mission with him involving a town’s vampire problem which I’ll link [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/qjwp3f/im_a_research_assistant_with_some_stories_to_tell/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Certain events have been keeping me busy these past couple of years, namely, we’ve been investigating these odd videos. Now, we’re no strangers to these kinds of things. You’d be surprised how common cursed videos are, to varying degrees. Not every one of them is like The Ring. Some will just give you really shitty luck after you watch them which may result in your death if it’s bad enough.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, the tapes we’ve been studying aren’t actually cursed. At least, they aren’t in a direct sense. From what we’ve seen, though some contents of them are hazardous in certain circumstances. Of all places, they were discovered at my old foster home. A quick aside, the one I grew up in put heavy emphasis on education.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I actually excelled above the other kids I lived with. In fact, that’s why Dean decided to adopt me. It’s also how a lot of people end up working in our branch. In fact, we have a lot of people working for those institutions in order to find new recruits. I can’t say I approve, but someone has to deal with all the weird stuff.

&#x200B;

I mean there are independent paranormal investigators. A few I’m friends with and they’ve even helped us on occasion. I can see the appeal of being one sometimes. However, I prefer the job stability our branch provides. Anyway, back to the tapes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

One of our recruiters working as a caretaker at my old foster home is friends with Dean. Her name is Stella and she told him the tapes arrived in an unmarked vanilla envelope with the only marking being that they were numbered. The odd thing is the house has a door camera and yet when the footage was reviewed nobody was shown placing the envelope on the mat. While someone could have simply tampered with the camera beforehand, the timestamp was never interrupted. This was the first indicator that the tapes are paranormal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It’s not unheard of for cursed objects to mysteriously appear to people. In such cases, we have a protocol. We have prisoners look at them. Again, I know that’s not exactly ethical, but we’d be losing people left and right to these kinds of things otherwise. Stella sent the tapes over to the sector Dean and I work at.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The prisoner who viewed them isn’t in any physical danger. Mental is another story since they weren’t as exposed to these kinds of things as we are. They’re in the psych ward and I sincerely hope they get better. Knowing we were dealing with a legit threat, we decided to watch the tapes ourselves. I’ll do my best to transcribe them beginning with the first one.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**\[The date shown at the beginning of the video is June 8th, 1986\]**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dean and Stella believe the footage was most likely filmed on an 8mm camcorder due to the quality as well as the date.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The ones in the video are a family of four known as the Stantons. The names of each member are as follows, Harvey, the dad. Frances, the mother, Gwen, their daughter, and lastly, Randy, their son. Gwen seems to be in her early teens or at least a preteen while her brother is a few years younger. In addition to them, some extended family members and friends can be seen. Prior to any footage being shown, there is speaking.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Harvey:** “It’s on, but nothing is showing up on the tv. I think I hooked it up wrong.”

&#x200B;

**Frances:** “Gwen!”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Yeah?”

&#x200B;

Frances: “Can you come down and help your dad out? He’s having trouble.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Footsteps are audible as Gwen descends the stairs. The noise of tampering can be heard followed by the footage coming to life. Harvey smiles at the camera and then focuses it on his wife and daughter.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Harvey:** “You did it, Gwen. This’ll be perfect for tonight. Frances, when did Connie say she’d be dropping off Randy?”

&#x200B;

**Frances:** “I think she said eight, but her and Nate are going to be helping us shop for presents. Gwen, we’ll need you to watch Randy and Jason while we’re out.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gwen’s expression becomes confused.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Wait. I was supposed to spend the night at Luella’s, remember?”

&#x200B;

**Harvey:** “Shit, that’s right.”

&#x200B;

**Frances:** “No cussing in front of the kids!”

&#x200B;

**Harvey:** “Sorry.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “I can't watch them. Stacey and I have been planning this for months!”

&#x200B;

**Frances:** “Well, renting this camera cost us a lot. You can see her next year.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “I wanted to see her tonight!”

&#x200B;

**Frances:** “Don’t raise your voice at me!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*An argument ensues between the two. Eventually, Gwen is forced to comply. Her mother tells her to go wait in the car.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Frances:** “Have you been filming this the whole time?”

&#x200B;

**Harvey:** “I forgot the camera was still on.”

&#x200B;

**Frances:** “Turn it off.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The footage ceases. It resumes this time during Randy’s party. Gwen isn’t shown. At first, it was thought she was the one filming. However, after further review, she can be seen in the back.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*This is where things get odd. The birthday party goes as normal except for one part where the camera instead focuses on Gwen slipping away from the party. Based on her body language, she seemed upset. The camera refocuses on the party and then Happy Birthday is sung to Randy. He blows out his candles and begins tearing into his presents.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*It should be noted that during this the one holding the camera is never addressed or even acknowledged. That is except in one instance. The film stops again. When it cuts back, this time it shows Gwen crying in her room. There’s a noise similar to that of a cicada.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She seems to hear it and looks in the direction of the camera, but not at it. The sound repeats except more loudly. The creaking of her door opening can be heard. The POV switches this time to her perspective. There is a wispy pink trail leading out of her room.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She follows it and it leads downstairs.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I should mention it was at this point did I really start worrying. The stuff up until then was strange, sure. However, none of it made us feel as if there was a real sense of danger. The whole time I wished Gwen would ignore the trail and go back to her room. No such luck.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*It ends in front of the living room TV. It turns itself on.  What’s shown on the screen makes her gasp. Describing it is difficult given the limited resolution of cameras back then. From what can be observed, its shape is similar to that of a cobra-shaped cloud and is a more vibrant pink color to the trail.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Its eyes stand out, being ruby red, and emit a light that is believed to cause hypnosis. This entity is capable of human speech. However, it seems only able to do so through electronics and reflective surfaces. The evidence for this is that it communicates through the speakers of whatever device it’s currently operating through. For example, it spoke to Gwen and its voice was the same as tv static.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Entity**: “Don’t be afraid, child.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Who?... What?...

&#x200B;

**Entity:** “I have many names. You may call me Ludus.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “What are you?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “It’s not what I am, child. It’s what I can offer.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “No, this can’t be real.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For a moment, we thought she would turn away. We wanted her to. I got this urge to scream at her not to trust that thing. I knew there would be no point, though It would’ve done as much good as yelling at a character in a horror movie.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I can bring her back.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gwen Stops.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “What are you talking about?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “You miss her, don’t you?”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “How do you know about that?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I know a lot. You two were close, weren’t you?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus vanishes from the screen and pink light bursts from it. The setting changes again. This time it appears to be a kindergarten classroom based on the layout. Pink and red hearts cover the walls, indicating that this took place during Valentine’s day. The board has the name Mrs. Preston on it and the teacher herself is seated at her desk in front of it.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Accompanying the heart decorations are cutouts of pterodactyls.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At this point, we realized we were viewing a memory of Gwen’s.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Mrs. Preston gets up and walks in front of the class.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mrs. Preston:** “Happy Valentine’s day, everyone. We have a lot to do today, but before we begin I have a little surprise for you. We have a new student.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She calls out in the direction of her door.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mrs. Preston:** “You can come in now!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*A girl enters the room. Shyly, she glances around at her new classmates.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mrs. Preston**: “I know you’re nervous, but we’re all friends here. Why don’t you introduce yourself?”

&#x200B;

**Girl**: “Um…My name is Luella .”

&#x200B;

**Mrs. Preston:** “Good, now what do you say to Luella, class?”

&#x200B;

**The Class In Unison**: “It’s nice to meet you, Luella!”

&#x200B;

**Mrs. Preston:** “Very nice, everyone. Now, Luella, why don’t you go have a seat and get to know everyone? We’re doing crafts today.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The pov follows Luella walking, revealing a table where the students are all seated. Each person has a sticker of their name in front of them. Directly in front of the pov is the name Gwen. The seat across from it is empty. Luella sits in it.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Mrs. Preston begins passing out construction paper, safety scissors, glitter, glue, and crayons.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mrs. Preston:** “What we’re going to do is make Valentine’s cards.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She instructs the class to draw hearts on the constitution paper in front of them. Gwen’s focus shifts to Luella who seems to be struggling.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Do you need some help?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Luella stares at her.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Gwen: “Mrs. Preston says I’m a really good artist. I can help you if you want.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Stacey remains silent but hands her the construction paper she was drawing on. The heart illustrated on it is green.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Is this your favorite color?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Luella nods.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Mine too! What else do you like?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Luella responds this time.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “Animals.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “LIke cats and dogs?”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “Yeah, and birds and hamsters.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “I do too! Let’s put them on our cards.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gwen proceeds to fold her construction paper in half in order to create a card, She then doodles stick figure versions of various. Luella observes her and does the same,  In the background, Mrs. Preston can be heard checking on the other students. Eventually, she gets to Gwen and Luella.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mrs. Preston:** “How are things coming along? Are you doing good, Luella ?”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “Good, Gwen has been helping me.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Mrs, Preston turns her attention to Gwen.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mrs. Preston:** “That’s sweet of you, Gwen. Thank you so much for helping her feel welcome.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gwen looks at Mrs. Preston.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “You’re welcome. I like her.”

&#x200B;

**Mrs. Preston:** “That makes me happy to hear.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Mrs, Preston calls fir everyone’s attention.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mrs, Preston:** “Since everyone is nearly done, I have a surprise.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Mrs. Preston goes to her desk and gets a bowl of candy from it. The class gets excited.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mrs. Preston:** “Alright, settle down now. Remember to mind your manners. Now, I want you all to think of something nice to write down. It could be about one person or even the entire class. Then after you’ve written it down I want you to give the card you made to someone, but the person who gets it can’t open it until I say so.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gwen turns back to Luella. The message she writes on her card is “Wanna play with me after school?”.  She closes her card and Luella does the same. They exchange. Mrs. Preston passes out candy to her students and then permits them to open their cards.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Written in the card Gwen received from Luella is the word “yes”. She glances at her and for the first time in their conversation, she smiles. The footage jumps forward in time. Based on the change in their heights the estimated time passed is somewhere between five and six years. Where they are is inside a house.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Where’s your mom and dad?”

&#x200B;

Luella: “Out.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Again? Weren’t they out  Friday?”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “They work a lot. They deserve to have fun.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “It just seems like they’re gone a lot.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Luella frowns.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “Can we not talk about this right now?”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Okay, so you said over the phone you wanted to show me something?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Luella smiles nervously and tells Gwen to follow her. They go up to her room.  They get to her bed. Then Luella turns to Gwen.*

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “Before I show you this, can I ask you something?”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Sure, you can ask me anything.”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “We’ve known each other for a while so what do you think of me?”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “What do I think of you? I mean you know I like you.”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** ”I know, but…Do you…like me?”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Oh…I never thought you’d feel the same way.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Luella tears up and smiles. Gwen takes her hands in hers and they kiss.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While I can certainly appreciate a tender moment, all I could feel while we watched this play ot was dread because we knew there could only be one reason this was shown. Watching a character you admire die is one thing. When it’s someone real it’s that much worse. I can only hope that somehow if we can stop Ludus that’ll bring peace to its victims.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Luella pulls away, blushing. Gwen clears her throat.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “So uh what exactly did you want to show me?”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “Oh, right, hold on.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Luella bends down and reaches under her bed, pulling out some artwork. It’s of her and Gwen standing in a field of roses while facing each other and smiling. The star-filled night sky is accompanied by a meteor shower. A heart is drawn on the moon.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Luella, this is so…”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “I know, corny, right?”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “No, I think it’s amazing. How long did this take?”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “I”m happy you think so. I worked on it off and on this past week. I didn’t want anyone to see it because well, you know.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Yeah, I don’t get why people are so judgemental. Would you mind if I took it home?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Luella grins.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “That’s why I made it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gwen takes the drawing and places it in her backpack. The footage jumps forward in time, showing the pair doing nearly everything together. In every class they share, they are sitting right next to each other. Sometimes they get in trouble for talking while the teacher is.  They always have matching outfits.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Their favorites are green shirts usually with some kind of design on the front. It stops, showing them in the woods this time and sitting under a tree.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “I don’t think anyone will be bothering us here. Did you bring it?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The view pans down to Gwen’s backpack. As she goes to unzip it, a bandage is visible around her right hand. Concerned, Luella notices this and grabs it to take a closer inspection.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Luella:* “What happened to you?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gwen doesn’t answer. Luella studies her face.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “It was Byron again. Wasn’t it?”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “He grabbed me on my way home, but I managed to get a good hit on him and escape.”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “But your hand.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “It’s fine. At least I managed to get some payback. He’s a lot more thick-skulled than we thought, though.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*They share a laugh at Byron’s expense.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “What if he finds us here?”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “I doubt he’d want people to know he got beat by a girl. Now, can I show you what I brought?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Luella nods. Gwen unzips her backpack and from it pulls out The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty. They open it and begin reading. The footage cuts to the sun setting. It jumps forward again.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The view is blurry as if submerged in water. A finger wipes it away and Gwen speaks with a slight sniffle to her voice.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** "Does he have to?"

&#x200B;

**Luella:** "I'm sorry, but my dad says the job is important."

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** "You have my number. Promise you'll call often."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Luella smiles as tears are streaming down her face.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Luella:** "I will and we still have family living around here, so maybe it won't be long before we can see each other again."

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** "I'd like that. If this weekend is when you move then let's make sure it's a good one."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The video shows them spending time together skating, at the arcade, at the movies, and lastly stargazing at night while sharing some food.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “I’m going to miss this.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Me too. I hope we can see each other again soon.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*They hug and then start the walk back to Luella’s home while holding hands.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “So tragic it couldn’t last.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That voice after spending so much time watching something pleasant was akin to waking up from a deep sleep to find a rabid wolf leering over you.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*What’s shown next is a local news report. The date is June 10, 1986. The anchor is a woman by the name of Aimee Cole.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Aimee:** “Good evening, I’m Aimee Cole. Tonight’s top story is a tragic event. A young girl was found dead in the woods near Silver Oak Middle School.  Police suspect foul play. Although, the investigation is still ongoing. We’ll be sure to give updates as we receive them.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gwen’s voice becomes audible. However, she isn’t shown during this.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen**: “That’s where we were supposed to….No, it can’t be.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Breaking News is what’s seen next. The date is a week later. Aimee is back on the screen.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Aimee:** “Following up on the report last week, the girl has been identified as twelve-year-old Luella Nolan. Police have arrested fourteen-year-old Byron Roberts on charges of her murder.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*There is only darkness for a brief period and then Ludus abruptly appears on the living room TV screen again.  Gwen is breathing heavily. When she speaks again she can’t manage anything louder than a whisper.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Why? Why would you show me that? What was the point of making me lose her all over again?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:**  “To give you a second chance.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “How?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I want to play a game with you, child.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “A game? Why?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “That isn’t something you need to know. What you should is the prize if you win.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “And what would that be?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I can bring her back.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gwen breathes in.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “What?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I can bring her back for you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gwen considers this.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “How do I know this won’t be some kind of trick?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “A game once begun can not be interrupted. The rules once agreed upon are binding. Should you win, she will be revived in perfect health, albeit slightly older than when you last saw her. Do you accept? The game will be a test of pain. You are. of course, free to walk away and pretend this never happened. I’ll give you a moment to decide.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “I don't need one. I accept your challenge. I’ll bring Luella back.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus sounds slightly amused.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I admire your spirit.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Something begins coming out of the tv screen. It’s as if pink static has somehow taken a solid humanoid shape.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was wrong. Whatever it is I can only describe it as unnatural and every fiber of my being screamed that fact at me while we watched it. I wondered if this was the point that broke the prisoner. Did he make it any further? Because it gets so much worse.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus snaps its fingers. A small red arrow made of light appears in the air.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “This is simply a marker. Now, pay close attention. I do not enjoy repeating myself.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “I’m listening.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Once the game starts, the object before us will begin moving. Whoever’s turn it is must tell it to stop. Whoever it touches the most loses and we can not move from our spots.”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Okay, so to win I just have to get it to hit you more than me?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “That is one way to win, not that I’ve ever lost. Let the game begin. You can have the first play.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*At that moment the arrow moves all on its own. It moves quickly, bouncing around the living room.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Stop.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The arrow freezes and so do she and Ludus. A barbed chain shoots out in the direction the arrow was coming from. It pierces through Ludus’s hand and takes off the ring finger of Gwen’s right hand. She screams.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “What the fuck?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Although the wound is fresh, there is no bleeding.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I told you this game was about pain. Didn’t I?”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “But you aren’t feeling any. You’re cheating.”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Oh, I am. I’ve just learned to embrace it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was when we knew the true danger of this creature. I wish I could have helped somehow. Unfortunately, I was merely a spectator to the horrifying game that unfolded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “And I’ll show you something else. My turn.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The arrow moves again. Instead of saying stop, it declares something else.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Hand for a hand.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*This time a chain takes off a hand from it and Gwen. She howls in agony. Ludus chuckles.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus**: “You can choose what body part to target on your opponent if you give up one of yours. What you pick just has to be of equal or lesser importance. Oh, and the brain and heart are instant win areas. It’s your turn, Gwen.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We were on the edge of our seats, hoping for some way that she could overcome this.

&#x200B;

*The footage shows Gwen’s vision doubles from the pain.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Fainting counts as a forfeit. If so, then I suppose the winner is…”

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “My turn…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The face on the form Ludus took shifts slightly almost as if it is smiling. The arrow moves and  Gwen screams out her next words.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Leg for a leg.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The chain slices a leg off each of them. Gwen moans in pain instead of yelling. Presumably, she tried to prepare herself for it.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** "Only one thing can make people take such drastic actions. Unfortunately, it won’t be enough for you to win. My turn.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The arrow bounces around.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Stop.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*This time it takes off both of Gwen’s arms. She falls back, screaming, The view shows her arms severed just above the elbow.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was chilling to see. Why would it do this? What does it have to gain from it? Is it pure sadism or something more? Part of me still can’t believe she kept going even after that. It should be obvious why, though.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Gwen forces herself back up into a sitting position. Although she is able to continue, the pain has once again impacted her vision. When she speaks, her voice is a lot weaker.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “My turn…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*When she commands the arrow to stop it misses them both. Ludus laughs.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “What a shame, girl. It seems the reunification you so desire won’t be happening, My turn.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The footage is blurry, but Ludus can still be heard.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Leg for a leg.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My heart sank when it said this. We knew her fate was sealed. However, she did manage to surprise us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The resulting pain she receives is so immense she is unable to scream. With the last of her strength, she takes her last turn and shrieks out her final words.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gwen:** “Heart for a heart.”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “What?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus sounds surprised in its response. Its body lurches forward as the chain pierces it through its back. A heart is visible on it and right when the chain reaches Gwen, the video ends.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Since watching the video we’ve done some investigating. Thanks to the news report shown as well as several surnames provided, we were able to locate Gwen’s town. We managed to track down friends and family of hers and discovered something surprising. Luella is alive. She works as a teacher at Silver Oak and we approached her for an interview, she was thankfully cooperative.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**\[The following is a transcripted interview with Luella Nolan in her classroom. It was conducted by agent Stella Andersen\]**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Stella:** “Thank you for doing this, Ms. Nolan. I promise to try and get through these questions as quickly as possible.”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “No need for the formalities.”

&#x200B;

**Stella:** “Alright then, Luella. What can you tell me about…?”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “When I was kidnapped?”

&#x200B;

**Stella:** “You were kidnapped?”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “Yes, I’m surprised you weren’t aware of that since you wanted to speak with me.”

&#x200B;

**Stella:** “If it makes you uncomfortable, you don’t have to go into detail. I just need a name if you can give one.”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “There isn’t much to say about it. Some random creep pulled me into his car and drove off. He didn’t get far. Someone saw him and reported right away and the police managed to block him off before he could get to a highway. Luckily, he gave himself up without any trouble. It was horrible at the time, sure, but I’ve made peace with the incident.”

&#x200B;

**Stella:** “I’m glad for you.”

&#x200B;

Luella: "Thank you.”

&#x200B;

**Stella:** “Now can you tell me about a girl you knew by the name of Gwen Stanton?”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “The Stantons? I knew them years ago, but as far as I know, they only ever had one kid, a son. I never got any chance to interact with them before they moved.”

&#x200B;

**Stella:** “Wait, they moved?”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “That’s right. It was when I was about to start high school.”

&#x200B;

**Stella:** “Did your family ever move from here?”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “No, I’ve lived here since I was six.”

&#x200B;

**Stella:** “I think that will do for this interview. Thank you for your time, Luella.”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “Don’t mention it.”

&#x200B;

**Stella:** “Just one more thing. Did you ever have trouble with a boy named Byron Roberts?”

&#x200B;

**Luella:** “No, I’ve never even heard of anyone with that name.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This interview has several troubling implications. Whatever happened as a result of Ludus and Gwen's game changed both the events involving her and people's memories of her. As for Bryon, we aren’t sure why he met the same fate. Although, considering what he did perhaps that is for the best. Then again, we don’t know much about him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We did consider showing Luella the tape as there would be a strong possibility that she would believe its contents. However, it seems almost cruel to do so without being able to offer any sort of comfort. Still, part of me thinks she deserves to know. I guess I have to think about it more. Since Stella interviewed her, we’ve been trying to find everything we can about what Ludus is and its goal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It seems to be after us specifically if the tapes being discovered at my old foster home is any indicator. That thing has been plaguing me ever since we discovered it. Maybe it’s playing a game with us. If it is, I hope with everything I have that it’s one we can win. I can’t promise to post consistently as we’ve had our hands full with this thing, but I’ll update when I am able.
