On a dark night with a cloudy sky, Joseph, a professional criminal who had just robbed a bank, was in a pursuit with the police. Eventually he managed to curve through the woods and lose the police. After curving and getting rid of them, he found that as he rode past on his motorcycle, there were signs that said "Do not approach, house being demolished".

What! Demolition? I don't care, I'll leave tomorrow morning, at least until everything calms down. He said

He then broke the lock and entered the house, it was old and tired, it looked like it was going to fall down before demolition, but Joseph didn't care, it was only for one night, he settled down upstairs, found a room, which looked comfortable, made plans for the next day, then jumped into bed.

He lay there for a few minutes, but then he started to get hungry, so he grabbed a beer and drank it until it was empty. When he lay back down on the bed, he felt as if it was heavy, and the sensation was so strange that he started to get suspicious:

I think I've had too much to drink, but it's only been one bottle and I already feel so strange?

It didn't take long for him to fall asleep, and when he woke up, it was around dawn, and he started to feel very cold, so he noticed that his blanket had disappeared, when he looked around the room, he saw the sheet that was on the other side, next to the closet, he was scared, who put that on him while he was sleeping, he approached to take the sheet, but the closet door opened, and someone pulled the sheet and the door closed quickly.

Joseph froze with fear, he shivered from head to toe, and began to shake, and then he said:

The drunkenness hasn't worn off yet.

He left the room and went into the hallway. When he stopped at the top of the stairs, he stood like a statue and began to tremble when he saw a woman with her back almost two meters in front of the front door, and she seemed to talk non-stop, he didn't understand because he was far away

Hey, lady... Who are...you? And how did you get in here?" he asked.

The woman started to turn around, as she did so, her body crackled as if her bones were going to break, and she started to look at him, but without saying anything, she had big eyes that didn't blink for a second, and they made him more and more uncomfortable

The lights went out and everything went dark like a hole with no way out, and he heard the woman's footsteps running towards him, he became desperate, and started running too, no matter where he went, he felt her getting closer and closer, as he ran without seeing where he was going he stepped on a fragile piece of wood and it broke, and he fell to the ground, scraping his head, and a broken leg, he contained his screams so as not to be heard by her.

She looked at where he had fallen, but all in silence, she went down towards him crawling, he did his best to look dead, the woman began to beat his broken leg, for many minutes, as if she wanted to rip it off

He didn't even move an eyelid, nor did he scream in agony, he was trying his best to endure the pain, she was gone, and he was sweating, and shaking, he had never seen a woman that size, with a deformed face, he did his best to get up, his leg hurt as if it had been crushed, and then he began to crawl, to find something that would be useful, it took him longer to reach the main door, he felt weak, almost without strength.

He turned quickly towards the stairs when he heard something strange, she was sitting on one of the steps and looking straight into his eyes, as if she could see the soul inside.

Please, ma'am, forgive me, I'll never come to your house again, please let me go!

She moved her hands, and he was dragged towards her, she held him, effortlessly lifted him up, squeezing his head where it was already wounded, and started blowing in his face, he felt like a gale in a storm, she stopped, and his vision blurred, the woman threw him against the door, which broke and he went to the other side, it was such an impact that he fell unconscious.

When he woke up, it was morning, and he was lying around in the woods, and next to him was his motorcycle, he got up and was walking normally, his leg was normal, and his head wasn't hurt at all, he was incredulous, but when he took a good look at the motorcycle, all the money was gone, when he turned around to look in the house, it was gone, he left there perplexed and without the money.

As he rode along the road on his motorcycle, he began to wonder if it was the drink, or if he had been shot, the police passed by him but no one paid any attention, as if he wasn't there, and they passed by with frightened faces, in fact everyone who saw him was frightened, he went to the edge of a river near the woods, and his face looked as thin as a skeleton's, his skin so white, that after seeing it his reflection disappeared, and then he realized... Since he had been in that house and felt cold, and suffered those impacts, he was no longer alive... but yes... He looked again at where the house was and it was demolished, and there were ambulances and police...

The end
