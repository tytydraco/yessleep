Logging on…

Okay, finishing the final touches now. Hands-free notes are live and ready to record. This should pick up the team's speech while letting me make my observations through the headset.

"Testing, testing 1,2,3?" Steven, the engineer.

"Okay, seems to be working on screen too, Steven. I’ll test everyone quickly to make sure everything’s up to date and working."

The camp is busy this morning. The sky is its usual offensive splash of color. I try not to focus on it too much. Still no birds, no marine life. Getting further into the island will make trips to the coast harder. But for now, I’ll focus on the task at hand. Time to check in with the team.

"Hello, loves." Tanya, the biologist and meteorologist.

"Hello, folks." Dan, the geologist.

"Test? Uh, hey, I guess." Alex, the medical specialist.

Okay, everyone’s checked in. Well, everyone except the guards. Better luck getting the plants to talk to me. Steven’s working on the rest of the gear for today’s expedition. Tanya and Dan are examining their respective fields. I’m heading to Dan now; he seems to be focused, but there’s anger in his eyes.

"Hey, Dan, I have a question from some folks back home. Also, it’d be great to hear what you’re working on."

"Oh? Shoot, hand me the shovel over there first though."

I hand him the shovel.

"So, someone asked about how there’s soil and trees on the island Alrea..."

"It’s not soil. As for the foliage, I don’t know. You’ll have to ask Tanya, but this isn’t like any crap I’ve dug up before, and I’ve been around the world."

"What is it then?"

Dan motions for me to take a look. The material underneath is some sort of elastic substance, layered, corded, and damp with a strange clear sap. The roots underneath stretch out in a complex, intricate system. I start pulling at one of them.

"What are you doing?"

"I want to see where this leads. Help me out."

Dan and I start working together to uproot the strange plant.

"Pretty destructive," Dan mutters.

"Curiosity’s my weakness."

"Howard, Dan, stop!" Tanya’s voice slices through the air.

I barely hear her over the wind, but we stop. I look up to see her frozen in place, pointing behind us. My breath catches. I look over my shoulder. It’s just an off-white tree. Weird, but...

It wasn’t there a second ago.

The tree has a faint, luminescent top, almost like a lollipop with legs. Dan and I start moving slowly away. Translucent tendrils are feeling around the dug-up area, weaving and searching.

It spits out liquid—blue and purple, a vomitous blend of colors, not mixed but separate and swirling. It’s disgusting. The colors move, shifting as I stare at them. I can feel my stomach churn, but I can’t look away.

The liquid is splattered everywhere. The tree spreads it like some kind of filling. I can’t process it all. Tanya and the others have already left, presumably for the guards.

I feel my hand cover my mouth as the odor hits me—rot, not the usual kind, but something worse. Like the very essence of decay, something ancient and beyond comprehension. My insides are burning like my body is being consumed.

The tree, now still, settles into the ground, resting amid the mess. I’ve had enough. I need to leave—I need time. I just need...

8:30 AM

"Any other pain?" Alex asks, concern lacing her voice.

"No, I’m starting to feel better."

"That’s good. Tell me again how you’re feeling."

"It was kinda like a fever. But I could feel every organ heating up, jolting around, wanting to run, but not out of fear. It was like a gripping reaction. I... I don’t know. I can’t describe it."

9:00 AM

"What did you get us into?"

"No, I’m not thinking of leaving. What about the other teams?"

*Pacing steps*

"No, we haven’t heard anything. Why...?"

"Okay, I get it. Yes... Yeah. Goodbye."

*Crash.*

"Is this thing on again!? Fucking hell. Steven!"



12:00 PM

Alright, everyone’s geared up for our first expedition into the cave system. Dan, almost like a miner, is ready. Tanya’s staying back, but I’m to bring any samples I can. Steven is joining us through his droid—kind of a robo-dog setup. Alex decided the cave folk needed her medical knowledge, so she came with us. The older guard, I’ve decided to call Richard, and I’ve put him in the system.

We’re heading in now. The walls are lined with some sort of goop—I’m sure Tanya would like a sample. The cave is surprisingly well-formed, hard to believe this is natural. Dan says the walls are made of the same materials as the surface outside.

The air is rhythmic, almost like a deep breath of the earth. I pull out my flashlight, but it reflects too much off the walls.

"Here," Dan hands me a glowstick. “I don't like it here. Caves don't form like this.”

He leaned in to tell me this. Almost a whisper. Who is he trying to avoid? Ill have to get him alone to ask later.

*20 minutes later*

"JESUS!"

We’re good—just a false alarm. Steven’s droid fell and almost scared the life out of me. It brushed against my leg. Heart attack avoided. Setting it up again—let’s let it lead the way now.

It’s eerily quiet. This cave has expanded about 75 meters, and still nothing. We’re coming up to a bend, though. Sending Robo-Steve in first.

"Mask up. Air’s thinning." Richard says.

He’s right—no equipment failure, just thinner air. If I wasn’t so on edge, I’d realize it myself. No idea why they have the psychologist in the cave, but whatever.

"Come on, doctor," Alex calls from behind.

No idea how she stays upbeat, but I’m not complaining.

“HvjrEvjfvnRfnE”???



We’ve gone 150 meters now, and I’ve lost sight of Steven. I can’t even hear the droid’s mechanical whirring anymore. The signal .. getting choppy.  I’ll finish this report when we’re out.



5:00 PM

Okay, I’m not sure we should stay here any longer. Calm down, Howard, calm down.

First of all, fuck this dumb piece of equipment. What kind of recorder can’t let you mess around with the recordings? It's Like Word doc woke up and decided to hate me. I asked Steven about it, but he hasn't seen anything like it before.

*Breathe.*

I got separated from the group while switching glowsticks. I ventured forward, trying to find them. I called out and retraced our steps. But eventually, I found a split we missed on our first time around. I decided to check it out.

And I found it.

Broken bits of the tree-things, their insides hollowed out. Nothing inside.

I don’t know what to make of it. Maybe I’m just freaked out, but something feels wrong. I bolted and finally found the others. I tried to show them the room, but it was gone. My footprints in the sludge still lead us there. But nothing no room no trees no nothing. 

Maybe it was stress or a hallucination in the dark. But my gut tells me something’s off. Tanya’s talking about how we could all go down in history for our discoveries here. Not sure I’m much help though. I’m supposed to be watching them for odd behavior, but I’m the one acting like a fool.

My boss said it’s important to keep track of everyone’s behavior, times, and dates. I just need to focus on my work.

Steven’s upset—the droid dog’s broken, in two pieces. He’s working on reinforcing one of his backup droids. I asked why it looked like a cat. He gave me some excuse about it not being designed for caving, but I’m not buying it.

Tanya and Dan are talking about their samples. Tanya mentioned muscle fiber in the plants, veins, and nervous systems. I’ll interview them personally at the end of the expedition. So far, everyone seems quirky but normal.

Alex is still bubbly, probably relieved no one’s been hurt. She listens to loud music as the day winds down, dancing around in her tent. We all give her space.

Richard and Bob take turns patrolling. One route’s shore side; the other’s inland, near the tree. Speaking of…

The tree hasn’t moved. It’s dug deep into the ground, but every now and then it glows faintly like it’s mimicking the stars above. and the stars I've never seen them twinkle like so. Then again I'm a city boy I don't think I've really noticed many stars.

I’m signing off early tonight. I need to rest. Hope you like the formatting better. God forgive me if I make a mistake. Will log in again if anything happens.



**Logging off…**
