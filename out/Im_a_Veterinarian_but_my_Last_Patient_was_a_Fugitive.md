While locking the door of my veterinary clinic after a long day, I heard a sound coming from the examination room. Since my receptionist and assistant had left for the night, Wookiee had to be the culprit.

I followed the noise down the hall, expecting to see my late son’s cat scampering about, and I froze at the sight of a disheveled person rummaging through one of the drawers. They must have snuck in after the last patient.

The intruder whipped around at my gasp, and I realized he was only a kid, his stained hood pulled up and cinched tight around his gaunt face. Before I could react, he stumbled away, fear draining his already ashen complexion as he pointed a gun at me.

“Don’t come any closer!” he yelled, his bloodshot eyes dilated, his weapon trembling in his grip.

I put my hands up, recognizing the signs. “It’s okay, hun, it’s okay. If you’re looking for syringes, they’re the third drawer there, to your left. Take as many as you need.”

He stared at me as if I were speaking a different language. I’d seen that dazed look before. On my son. It seemed like this young man was taking the same ruinous path that stole my beautiful boy from me.

He didn’t make a move towards the drawer, and that was when I noticed his other hand pressed against his side, blood-streaked and shielded by his filthy jacket. My motherly concern merged with my occupational integrity and I walked closer, my hands still up.

“Hun, are you hurt? Is that why you came here? I can help you, I’m a veterinarian.”

“Stay away!” he shrieked, waving the gun as he backed himself into a corner. “Don’t make me kill you!”

I backed away, but kept steady eye contact despite my racing pulse. “You came here for help. I’m good at what I do. Let me see what we’re working with.”

“No! Go away! Just go away or you’ll die!” he said, his voice trembling with desperation.

“I’m not going to ignore someone in need. I may not be a doctor for humans, but I’ll do my best to patch you up. Please, let me help you.”

I approached him again with small, unthreatening steps, my determination fighting my fear, and he shrank into himself. When I made it to his side, his helpless sorrow shifted to mind-blown incredulity as he looked me up and down, his eyes wide and mouth agape. I didn’t know what drugs he was on, but they seemed potent.

“Come with me, hun,” I said, ignoring his smell and the gun as I gently held his arm.

He nodded like a little child and let me lead him to the examination table, where he lay down, his thin legs dangling off the edge. His grip on the gun remained, but he allowed me to lift up his shirt. Beneath the grungy sock he'd been using as a compress, I found a small wound just above his protruding hip bone, its edges jagged as though someone had been digging inside.

I sighed at the destructive effects of substance abuse, but I tried to keep the atmosphere light as I said, “The good news is, you’re not mortally wounded. I’m going to wash my hands now, and then I’ll disinfect the wound, stitch it up, and dress it. Okay?”

He nodded, gulping.

I smiled and turned towards the sink. “My name is Dr. Bacheller, but you can call me Dr. B, or just Doc. What’s your name, hun?”

“Bren,” he replied, his muscles tense as he observed me.

“Nice to meet you, Bren. You know, my son Cody was about your age.”

He nodded, but his thoughts were elsewhere. “Don’t put me under,” he said, his command losing weight as his voice cracked.

“Don’t worry, it’ll be local anesthetic.”

The gun remained in his white-knuckled grip while I worked, but he aimed it away from me, his relentless gaze fixed upon my face. To ease his tension, I kept him informed on what I was doing and how much longer it would take.

“And that’s it,” I said with a smile as I pressed the bandages in place. “That wasn’t so bad, was it?”

He shook his head as he pulled his shirt back down.

“Do you have a place to stay for the night?” I asked.

Before he could answer, a knock on the door jolted him upright. “Don’t answer that,” he said, his gun pointed at me again.

I put my hands up, my pulse spiking. “Don’t worry. It’s probably a mistake since the clinic is closed.”

“Dr. Linda Bacheller?” a male voice asked, booming from behind the door. “This is the police. I would like to ask you a few questions.”

The blood drained from Bren’s face and he jumped off the examination counter, losing his balance and his gun as he fell against the wall.

I gasped and reached out to help him. "Oh, dear, are you—"

Panicking, he shrank away and dove after his weapon, aiming it at me again. “Don’t answer,” he growled, but his eyes showed terror, not malice.

“If I don’t answer, they’ll know something’s wrong,” I said, my hands back up as I kept my tone calm. “I live upstairs. If I’m not here or home, they could get suspicious.”

“No, no, don’t answer, let him go away.”

“Dr. Linda Bacheller? Is everything alright in there?” the man asked. “There‘s blood on the door, I have probable cause to come in.”

“No, please, no …” Bren backed away, his desperate eyes darting from one barred window to the next. "Is there another way out?"

"No. The back door is locked and my receptionist has the only key."

“Dr. Linda Bacheller? This is my last warning before I come in!" the officer yelled.

Bren whimpered and I said, “Let me handle it. I won’t tell him about you, I promise. I’ll just see what he wants. Okay? Bren?”

After a few seconds of searching for an alternative, he gave me a tense, defeated nod.

“Just stay here and relax,” I said with a reassuring smile before I jogged towards my reception area. “I’ll be right there!”

I unlocked the door and swung it open to find a tall police officer with impeccable posture.

“Good evening,” I said. “I apologize for taking a while to answer. How may I help you?”

For the second time that night, someone stared at me as if I were speaking a different language. After a few seconds, I began to get uncomfortable, so I lifted my eyebrows and nodded, prodding him to reply.

“Good evening, Dr. Bacheller, I’m Detective Cho,” he said, eyeing me as he flashed his badge with a flick of his wrist. “Is everything alright in there?”

“Yes.”

“There’s blood on your door.”

“Yes, I apologize if it caused concern. One of my clients brought in an injured bulldog today and I haven’t gotten around to cleaning the blood yet.”

“I see.” He pulled a photo out of his pocket. “Have you seen this young man? He was last seen in the area with an abdominal injury. We believe he may be searching for medical supplies, which is why we’re approaching all hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies in the area."

It was a photo of Bren, probably a screen grab from security camera footage.

Keeping my promise, I said, “No, I haven’t.”

Detective Cho studied me for a few seconds before he frowned and rubbed his forehead.

“Are you alright?” I asked in concern.

“I’m fine,” he replied with a hint of offense as he put his hand down. “If you see him, you must keep your distance and call me immediately on one of these numbers.”

He handed me his business card, and I inspected it before I looked back at him, fear and uncertainty seeping into my mind. “What has he done?”

“He’s a danger to himself and others if he doesn't get the help he needs. If you see him, it's integral that you keep your distance and call me immediately.”

After a moment of anxious hesitation, I said, “Okay, thank you, Detective. I’ll keep an eye out.”

He studied me one last time before he gave a curt nod. “Thank you for your time, Doctor. Be safe.”

He walked towards his car, and I looked at the business card as I closed the door, not sure if I did the right thing. Bren needed help, but getting dragged away kicking and screaming didn't seem to be the correct way to do it. He was a scared kid who needed kind guidance, and I hoped I'd be able to get through to him.

With a deep breath, I turned to go check on him, only to gasp when I saw his frail frame standing at the far end of the hallway.

“Is he gone?” he asked, observing me with suspicious eyes as he aimed his gun at my head.

I put my hands up, attempting to maintain the same calm confidence I previously had as my heart thudded. “Yes, I didn’t tell him you’re here, don’t worry.”

“What’s that in your hand?”

“He gave me his business card.”

“Rip it.”

I complied without protest.

“What did he tell you?”

I hesitated before deciding to tell the truth. “That you were a danger to yourself and others.”

His chin trembled, but he swallowed his hurt as he walked over until he was at the doorway between the hall and the reception. “Go there,” he said, jerking his head towards one of the chairs.

Desperate to help, I pushed past my fear as I said, “Bren, I didn’t tell the detective about you because I promised I wouldn’t, but I do believe you need help. I can help you. Let us figure this out together.”

“No one can help me,” he said, his voice shaking as he jerked his head again. “Go there. Now.”

“Bren—”

“Go there now!” he yelled. “Don’t make me hurt you!”

I flinched at his sharp command and acquiesced, my raised hands shaking as his gun followed me with impatience. This was a mistake. Who did I think I was? I couldn't even help my own son, why did I think I could help a strange boy.

I perched on the chair, tense, my trembling arms still up and my heart in a frenzy as I waited to see what he'd do next. His chest heaved as his agitated gaze scanned me up and down, and I gulped, wondering what thoughts were behind his sunken eyes.

He opened his mouth to speak, but a distant siren made us both jump. Not a second later, he darted towards the door, yanked it open, and sprinted out into the night without a word.

After a moment of stunned confusion, my arms dropped to my side and I released a quivering sob, tears of relief and regret welling in my eyes. Despite being so close to death, I couldn't help but feel like a failure. I couldn't help him. I just hoped he wouldn't end up like my son, discovered on a forgotten curb days after he took his last breath, months after he last heard the words “I love you.”
