**The Pact with Hell – Part 1**

**Chapter 1 – Thirty Seconds Dead**  
The fluorescent tubes above me hummed like a swarm of bees.  
Harsh, cold light stripped every color from the world.  
The smell of disinfectant burned in my nose, sharp as chlorine.

I lay on a narrow gurney, the metal beneath me so unyielding I could feel the pressure all the way into my bones.  
My hands rested on my chest, as if I had to hold myself together so I wouldn’t fall apart.

To my left, a monitor beeped in an uneven rhythm—a nervous heartbeat rendered in machine tones.

I knew I was about to die.  
For thirty seconds.  
That’s what they’d told me.

“Everything under control, Mr. Keller,” the doctor said. Her voice was routine, almost too friendly.  
I nodded, but couldn’t take my eyes off the long, clear IV line that ran from the drip on the wall to my hand.  
The tube gleamed under the light, and I imagined how, in a few minutes, something would flow through it that would bring my heart to a standstill.

And then?  
Nothing.  
Or… maybe Anna.

I squeezed my eyes shut, and instantly she was there—  
Her laughter, bright and warm.  
The scent of her shampoo—lavender with a hint of lemon.  
Standing barefoot in the kitchen on a Sunday morning, hair uncombed, coffee mug cupped in both hands.

It had been two years, but in that moment, it was as if she stood right beside me.  
A car accident.  
A drunk driver.  
A phone call in the middle of the night.

Since then, I’d kept going, but it was only… functioning.  
Delivering letters. Eating when I was hungry. Sleeping when I could.  
No family. No children. No purpose.

When I saw the ad in the paper, it was like a jolt of cold electricity:  
*Volunteers wanted – medical study: controlled cardiac arrest. Duration: 30 seconds. Purpose: research near-death experiences.*

I hadn’t thought long about it.  
Not because of the money.  
But because there was this chance—crazy, absurd—that I might see her one more time.

“Ready?” the doctor asked.  
I nodded.  
My throat was dry.

A nurse stepped up beside me, checking the electrodes on my chest.  
His face was expressionless, like a mask.  
“Don’t move, please.”

I felt something cold creep into my hand.  
The fluid.  
A burning sting in the vein, spreading through my arm like an intruder.

My heartbeat quickened, the monitor beeping faster.  
I could hear my own breath in my ears—short, quick.

Then came the fear.  
Real fear.

Not the diffuse life-fear I’d carried since Anna’s death.  
But pure, cold panic.  
What if they couldn’t bring me back?  
What if there was nothing?  
What if I just fell into a black hole and never came out?

“Relax, Mr. Keller,” the doctor said, as if that were an option.

**Chapter 2 – Anna**  
The chill of the gurney seeped into my back, but that wasn’t what stole my breath.  
It was the thought that this moment—this sterile, glaring here and now—might be the last thing I ever experienced in this world.

My eyes settled on a water bottle on the side table.  
The label was half peeled off, the plastic surface crumpled.  
Such a trivial detail, and yet it hurt to look at.

I remembered how Anna used to crush bottles like that with one hand when they were empty—always smiling, saying it sounded like a tiny firework.

Lavender.  
Lemon zest.  
The scent of her shampoo was so deep inside me, I swore I could smell it even here—though that was impossible.

I was back in our kitchen.  
Sunday morning. Sunlight slanted through the window, catching the steam rising from her mug.  
She stood barefoot on the cold tiles, wearing one of my shirts, the hem brushing her thighs.  
Her hair was a mess, her eyes half-closed.  
She grinned at me without saying a word—and that grin had always felt like a conspiracy, as if she were making me a promise only we understood.

Two years.  
Two years since a drunk driver hit her.  
Two years since my phone rang at 11:14 p.m.

I’d been in bed reading.  
When I saw the hospital’s number, I knew.  
Before the doctor’s voice even spoke, I knew my world had shattered.

“I’m sorry…”  
That was all it took.  
The rest was just noise.

Since then, every day had been a photocopy of the last:  
Get up. Deliver mail. Eat. Wait for night.  
I’d tried to get used to the idea that there was no reason to open my eyes in the morning.

And then… that ad.

Controlled cardiac arrest—thirty seconds of death.  
For anyone else, it was just a bizarre medical experiment.  
For me, it was a doorway.  
Maybe into madness.  
Maybe to her.

“Mr. Keller?” The doctor’s voice pulled me back.  
I blinked, and the kitchen, the warm sunlight, Anna’s bare feet on the tiles—they were gone.  
Only the cold neon light and sterile air of the lab remained.

“We’re starting now.”

**Chapter 3 – The Stillness**  
“We’ll begin with the sedation.”  
The doctor stepped closer, her gaze calm, almost gentle, as if this were as routine as changing a bandage.

I tried to focus on her voice, but every word seemed overlaid with other sounds:  
The steady beep of the monitor.  
The low hum of the air conditioner.  
The faint creak of the leather strap as the nurse checked my IV line.

The smell of disinfectant hung like an invisible wall between me and the rest of the world.  
It burned faintly in my nose, mixing with the damp, metallic scent of my own skin under the slowly warming electrodes.

“Take a deep breath,” the nurse on my left said.  
I obeyed, but my chest felt as if a brick were resting on it.

The doctor held the syringe up, the light bending through the clear liquid.  
“First you’ll get sleepy. Then… it will be still. That’s normal.”

The word *still* hit me like a blow.  
I’d spent so many nights in that eerie, living stillness—the kind that isn’t empty, but full of thoughts you don’t want to think.  
And now, that stillness was going to swallow me whole.

The first drop of liquid traveled down the line.  
I didn’t feel it right away, but I knew it was coming.  
My eyes locked on the point where the needle met my skin—that tiny spot where my body no longer belonged entirely to me.

“Everything under control, Mr. Keller,” the doctor repeated.  
I nodded, flinching slightly as the first cool shiver crept up my arm.

The tingling spread—first to my forearm, then my shoulder.  
My fingers felt foreign, no longer obeying my commands.

The beeping of the monitor changed.  
Barely perceptible, but I heard it.  
Faster. Less regular.

My gaze slid to the door.  
A stupid instinct—as if I could just get up, walk out, and forget the whole thing.  
But my legs lay still under the thin blanket, heavy as lead.

A bead of sweat traced down my neck.  
I thought of Anna, how she sometimes woke in the middle of a warm night, resting her hand on my chest to feel my heartbeat.  
“Just to make sure you’re still there,” she’d smiled once.

Now, she’d never be able to know.

The doctor glanced at the monitor, then at me.  
“It will happen very quickly now. You’ll—”

The rest of her sentence dissolved into a dull rumble in my ears.  
The world began to close in, as though an invisible frame was tightening around my vision.  
Voices dropped in pitch, distorted.

One last thought flashed through me: *Please, let me find her.*

Then—no light. No sound.  
Just one beat.  
And silence.

**Chapter 4 – The Threshold**  
It wasn’t like I’d imagined.  
No sudden jolt, no sensation of losing the ground beneath my feet.  
More like a slow draining.  
Like water seeping from a crack until nothing remains.

At first, there was only darkness.  
Not the darkness of a room at night—this had weight.  
It draped over me, gripped me like a hand that wouldn’t let go.

I wanted to breathe, but the air was thick, as if it were made of something viscous.  
Each breath grew shorter until I stopped trying—  
And realized I didn’t need to.

A dull thud.  
Pause.  
Another.  
Like the far-off echo of a hammer striking wet stone.

It took me a moment to understand—  
That was my heart.  
Or maybe just the memory of it.

The darkness around me began to change.  
Not brightening—growing denser.  
Like smoke thickening until it takes on shape.  
Currents of shadow that moved like water, but flowed sideways, obeying laws I didn’t know.

And between them—color.  
First a pale red, like the ember of a cigarette in the dark.  
Then deeper, pulsing scarlet, threading through the black like veins.

I didn’t know if I was seeing or hearing it.  
Each shift in color came with a sound—sometimes a whisper, sometimes a deep, slow rumble.

Then came the pull.  
It was as if something unseen tugged at my awareness.  
Not violently—more like a child drawing a toy on a string.  
Slow, but inevitable.

I drifted.  
Not down, not up—just away from everything I knew.

When the ground appeared beneath my feet, it was already there, as though it had been waiting the whole time.  
Rough. Cracked. Jagged.  
Like cooled lava with tiny, glittering shards of frozen light hidden inside.

I lifted my head—and the world opened up.

The “sky” was false—a heavy mass of blood-red clouds moving so slowly you only noticed if you looked away for a while.  
Thin fractures split the ceiling here and there, dripping something molten into the distance—metal that never cooled.

The air was warm, tasted of iron.  
Every breath left a film on my tongue, like licking a battery.

Sounds drifted from far away.  
Sometimes like waves breaking on rocks.  
Sometimes like voices—too faint to form words, but too clear to be wind.

Something shifted at the edge of my vision.  
Large. Slow.  
A shadow whose shape was wrong—too many limbs bending at angles that shouldn’t exist.  
I forced myself not to look.

“Anna?”  
My voice was barely more than a croak.  
It didn’t echo—it was swallowed.

Silence.  
Then… a whisper.  
So soft it felt more in my head than in my ears:  
*Come…*

It was neither male nor female, but warm.  
A tone that didn’t push, only invited.  
Like a hand reaching out to you.

I felt my feet move on their own.  
Ahead, a break opened in the cracked landscape—a path of dark, dull ash curving out of sight.  
On either side, jagged rocks jutted upward, fumes leaking from their fractures with the smell of burnt resin.

And with every step, the whisper grew clearer.  
Not louder—just closer.  
*Come… I’m waiting…*
