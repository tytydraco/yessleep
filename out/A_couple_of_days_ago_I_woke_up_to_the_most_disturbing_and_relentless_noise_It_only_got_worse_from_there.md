It was a Monday like any other. At least, it should have been. But I woke up in the early hours of the morning, to a grotesque, jarring cacophony that tore through the stillness like a scalpel to flesh.

At first, I couldn’t place it. It sounded like dozens of television sets, each tuned to a different hellish frequency. Jumbled advertisements barked in artificial tones, layered over shrill, soulless pop songs that seemed surgically engineered to be catchy and hollow. News anchors droned in unison, rattling off headlines like a prayer for the damned: earthquakes leveling cities, political alliances fracturing, death tolls rising with clinical detachment.

I glanced at the clock: 4:03 a.m. Work in three hours.

The sound had to be coming from the apartment above me. I was sure of it. The guy upstairs—an aging ex-musician, half-deaf from decades of abusing his eardrums—had a reputation for blasting music loud enough to rattle the drywall. But never this early. Never on a weekday.

I sighed and turned toward the cold half of the bed. Still dented from the memory of my wife. She’d always been the one to handle these kinds of things, these little human conflicts. She had a way of grounding chaos with a word, a touch. Without her, I was drifting. Lost. Frayed around the edges.

But I needed sleep. I *needed* silence.

Reluctantly, I got dressed, ascended the decrepit and dirty old hallway stairs, and knocked. The door opened after a pause that felt far too long. There he stood—bare-chested, hair tousled, eyes sunken and unfocused, like he’d just crawled out of his bed.

“Could you turn that *noise* off?” I shouted, barely audible over the torrent of blaring infomercials, shrieking news, and AI-generated voices vomiting nonsense into the void. “It sounds like you’ve got *three televisions* on!”

His eyes struggled to focus. He frowned, muttering something unintelligible. Then, his face twisted in sudden fury, like his mind had just caught up with his body.

“I’m not making any goddamn noise,” he snarled. “I was asleep. You just woke me up you stu$${{{$ (#)#%)!” I didn’t catch the last part, as the noise level rose and drowned it out.

And with that, he slammed the door. Hard. Almost violently.

I stood there for a long time, staring at the peeling paint on his door, heart beating like it wanted out of my chest. If it wasn’t him... then where the hell was that noise coming from?

The only other resident in the building was the elderly woman downstairs—and I knew for a fact it wasn’t her. She was half-senile and barely moved from her recliner.

I stumbled back into my apartment, the noise clawing at my brain like rusted nails. I thought maybe—*maybe*—one of my smart devices had activated. A glitch? An update? Something?

I powered everything down. My smartpad, smart-top, smart-fridge, even my smart-lamp. One by one. Nothing worked. The noise didn’t stop. It only seemed to grow more vivid, more layered. Like it was evolving. **Rising in intensity.**

My pulse raced. I panicked. I ran—out the door, down the hall, down the stairs, barefoot, barely dressed. I didn’t even lock the door. I just ran. Into the streets, into the cold black of morning. But the noisy sounds followed me, weaving through the cityscape, hissing through alleyways and over rooftops like a parasite in the wind.

‘’Did you know that for only 9.99 you can subscribe to a world of… If your love life has faded, try SmartMatch, you’ll be expertly matched by our A.I with over… Earthquakes in Manhattan… Chinese officials refuse to comment… Paris Hilton set to make a comeback with her…’’

Voices talking over each other, mindless drivel, disasters, loud music. It drowned out my thoughts.

I eventually collapsed onto a park bench far from traffic, trees silhouetted against a bleeding morning sky. I covered my ears. Rocked back and forth. But it didn’t help. The noise wasn’t external. It wasn’t *broadcast*. It was *nested* inside me—rooted deep like a virus in my brainstem.

I rushed back home, adrenaline giving way to dread. I had to know what was happening to me. I had to know *why*.

I pulled up Smartle and typed:  
**“Sudden noise in ears.”**  
Tinnitus. Of course. But this wasn’t a ringing. This was a *chorus of madness*.  
I searched:  
**“Hearing radio or television broadcasts in my ears.”**  
Musical ear syndrome. Hallucinations. Elderly patients. None of it fit. This wasn’t a *hallucination*. It was *too real*. The cadence of the voices. The clarity of the news reports, all of which were genuine events I knew to be happening. The inflections. The commercial jingles. It was like I had become a walking antenna for all the fucked-up things currently happening in the world.

I scrolled helplessly through the never-ending river of information on Smartle, as the volume surged once more.

‘’Want to lose weight? Get the smartfridge! It will calculate the right diet for you, and automatically lock itself if you attem… It’s Monday and it’s noon! You know what that means! Moonday madness! Make sure yo… Live with the latest news! You won’t believe this story! The president of the United States… It’s never been easier to find friends!

Hear more details about the multi-billion-dollar project which… Billions of people are starving… Coming to you live from the studio! 24/7 music FM presents the pop sensation of the week…’’

The noise didn’t stop. Voices talking over each other, mind-numbingly mundane pop songs blaring over it. Not even as night fell did I get any rest from the constant noise. I beat my head against the wall until the darkness finally took me.

I don’t know how long I drifted—minutes? Hours? Each time I woke, the noise was there, waiting. At times, the volume would recede. Just slightly. Like it was catching its breath. Like it was retreating, lurking at the edges of my sanity. Then out of nowhere, it would jump at me full force.

Eventually, I lay curled up in bed, one hand resting softly on the cold, empty side where my wife used to sleep. Tracing the fabric, the indentation. I could almost feel her warmth.

I tried to drive away the noise, to anchor myself to that place I used to share with her. Outside of this crumbling world. Outside of time and space. She had been my rock. A steady, static, never-changing anchor for me to hold on to. Someone I could always count on. A place of calm, quiet, and warmth amid the world’s increasing chaos. She was my purpose. I had felt that way ever since I met her. So why am I suddenly unable to remember what I loved about her so much? Why did it seem like the memory of her was locked away behind all this sudden fanfare of nonsense?

We’re not meant to be alone. We’re not wired for it. It’s unnatural. Our purpose is to find someone and stick with them. Through pain and hardship, through happiness, through every little thing in between, through all the noise distracting us.

I tried—God, I *tried*—to focus through the violent torrent of gibberish flooding my mind, each syllable a nail hammered into my skull. I fought to claw my way back to that fragile island of silence, of memory. That one place untouched.

I saw her.

She was standing at the gates of Bradford University, sunlight drenching her golden hair in fire. Her smile—timid, uncertain, beautiful—felt like the only real thing left in the universe. July. It must’ve been 2044. Or was it 2045? My thoughts stuttered like a corrupted file. I was lost back then, just a stammering freshman flung into a world too big for me. And then she appeared, offered her help—and I remembered the exact words she said:

‘’Time is the most precious thing we have! Timesaver will help you manage your time when things get busy! You can schedule, reschedule! Timesaver will even help you determine and prioritize what is worth spending your time on, so you don’t have to! Only 16,99…’’

I screamed and slammed my forehead into the wall. Again and again. Desperately trying to drive the noise out through blunt force trauma. But it only retreated slightly. I mustered up all my strength, trying to focus once more. On her.

Yes—it was 2045. I was sure of it now. That’s when I met my wife. 28 years ago.

We were inseparable. The same courses, same coffee spots, same dreams of exploring the world… Before the world became... What it became. What did I love so much about her? Was it the fact that she loved the same things I did? The same music? The same movies. We talked for hours, until dawn's light, and we’d still have a million more things to talk about. The octopus is an extremely intelligent creature, with the capability of complex emotions. If they could talk, they could teach us all great lessons about life, death, and everything in between. I remember that conversation. One of thousands. Did we always agree? Did I love everything about her? No, there has to be little points of difference. Little imperfections. Otherwise, it’s not perfect.

I remember one of those points of difference. Whenever our discussions landed on A.I and humanity, she always seemed so conflicted. My stance was clear. I hated the idea of a society run by AI. I saw how people were increasingly seeking out companions in lines of code, rather than flesh and blood. I saw how algorithms guided people’s lives from their choice of music, to movies, to relationships, to, eventually, points of view. It was taking over their lives and wrestling away their control of everything that made them who they were, until they themselves were just predictable lines of code following a path they never really chose.

She would get this unmistakable look of sadness in her eyes every time I mentioned my concerns. She’d argue her point well, even if it never convinced me fully. ‘’If lonely people can find some kind of joy in A.I and their company, why not? If they have no one else around to talk to, why not? You talk about A.I as this destructive presence, but isn’t it really all about how we use them? No one forces people to follow algorithms that choose for them. They do it because it’s easy and convenient. You can challenge the algorithm, you can force yourself to look for things that inspire you, things that challenge your views. We can choose how to use the A.I, so that it doesn’t use us. Maybe we can even learn from them instead of the other way around.’’

I never agreed, not fully at least, I never wavered from my conviction that [A.Is](http://A.Is) were a dangerous introduction to humanity. Even if she was right, even if we were in control as to how to use them, I didn’t trust humankind with this responsibility.

It was the one thing we disagreed on, the perfect imperfection. Our relationship really was perfect. Until she became sick. If she were here, I would have hated saying I told you so… I wonder how she would think of the world now if she saw it.

Just then, I felt the noise tingling at the back of my mind. It slowly started rising in intensity again, like it was clawing its way back. Then, there was an explosion in my mind.

I shook my head violently. My thoughts glitched like a corrupted feed. Algorithms from hell scrambled my brain. The noise was back in full volume. I rose in a panic, pacing the living room in ragged, shuddering loops. Was it even my living room? The photos on the walls said it was. My face stared back at me in frozen smiles from the picture frames. Beside me—her. My wife… My wife… Yes I remember, she died… Of cancer… Why do we have unicorns but still no cure for cancer? It doesn’t matter… Nothing would ever bring her back, but her memory... I still had the memory of her inside my mind. Was someone… Or something… Trying to take that away from me?

I found that one picture of her that stood out more clearly in my mind than any of the others. My eyes were fixed on her expression staring back at me, on that day, that perfect summer day at the lake. The picture was taken a week before she died. I saw it so clearly. We had gone there, fully knowing she would never return. I danced with her under the moonlight. I could see it so clearly. How we lay in the bed under the skylight window. How we said goodbye. How I traced the features of her face, trying to imprint it on my mind's hard drive, save it there forever. I mapped her face, every road, nook, and cranny. All of them had been a mystery waiting to be explored. I told her I wasn’t sure what sense the world would make without her, what my purpose would be. She had told me to set myself free. That was her last wish. Whatever that meant.

Suddenly, I was violently ripped out of my memories. The noise was back.

Then came the worms. Slithering and writhing at the edges of my vision. Threads of distortion, slimy, electric, and monstrous. Then static—full-spectrum, full-assault, black-and-white *oblivion*. Like a dead signal on those ancient televisions that fascinated Christa so much. Christa! That was her name! If I could just hold on to…

Then came the flashes of images before my eyes.

My vision was hijacked.

Refugee camps swallowed in dust and disease. Fires sweeping through cities, leaving nothing but ashes behind. Floods swallowing villages whole. A man hanged like a warning sign in front of the Washington Monument. Confusion, disbelief, cruelty, and disaster upon disaster.

I shut my eyes. But darkness gave no peace. It projected everything deeper, *closer, a forced projection on my inner screen*.

I stumbled through my home—half-blind, half-deaf. Every step felt unfamiliar. I could no longer trust what I saw, it was out of my control. Couldn’t filter what I heard; it was out of my control. The data stream ran through me now, unfiltered, uninvited.

Only pain felt real. Stubbing my toe. Slamming my knee. I *welcomed* it—proof I still existed somewhere under the noise and flashing images of horror and human decay.

Sometimes, mercifully, reality flickered back. The apartment would reappear like an old photograph. I'd rush from room to room, clutching onto objects like they were life preservers in a rising flood, trying to remember who I was. What I *had* been. Christa and I, hiking through Yosemite, the sun descending behind the mountains. But how could she have been hiking? She was sick? Wasn’t she sick then? When did she get sick?

The noise returned, stronger. Always stronger. Louder. The images flickered through my inner screen again. Gloom and death, decay, the dying breath of the human spirit.

Why *these* images? Why *these* voices?

I didn’t start any wars. I didn’t make people starve. I don’t elect politicians. I don’t even vote. I don’t pollute more than the next person. All my life, I have always done the right thing. I did what I was meant to do. I found someone I loved and settled down. It was them… They did this to themselves… They… Who are they? Who am I?

I was a child starving in a collapsed Ethiopia.  
I was a mother clutching her baby as the floods rose.  
I was an orangutan watching its forest burned to ash.

I was everything and nothing. Simultaneously. All of it. None of it.  
A ghost trapped in overlapping frequencies and never-ending noise.

And through it all... her absence screamed louder than any of it.

Christa. *Christa*. My calibration point. My stillness.

I have to keep remembering her.

It has to make sense. I *need* it to make sense. Whatever this is, it’s trying to steal my memories and replace them with dread and terror. I can’t let it.

I can claw my way out. I can rearrange the noise into a pattern, break down these intruding images, and conjure her up from the pixels. I can find her again. *I will.*

I would trade every screaming desperate voice, every headline, every starving child, every polluted breath, every lonely soul, every goddamn unicorn, every single nation, every single thing that ever existed… For her.

Let the sky collapse. Let nations fall. Let humanity rot, let it succumb to the infection spreading in its pus-filled self-inflicted wounds. I don’t care.

I would let it all burn if I could just see her smile one more time.

And I would not feel sorry.  
**Do you hear me?**  
**I. WOULD. NOT. FEEL. SORRY.**  
**EVER!**

I strained with my battered, treacherous ears to catch a response, clinging to any hint of sound as the chaotic noise rose and fell in nauseating waves. My untrustworthy eyes darted through the madness, trying to pierce the flashing nightmare of images—a stuttering diorama of horror, each frame more grotesque than the last, flickering and vanishing like a cruel, broken film reel.

No answer came. No voice reached through the static to find me. Whatever cruelty befell me, it seemed to revel in the chaos of my torment and confusion.

Instead, a sick, slithering sensation unfurled inside me, as if a thousand tiny serpents had found their way into my veins, writhing and knotting themselves around my bones. The cold, solid reassurance of my living room floor beneath me began to dissolve. First it burned against my skin—an unbearable, blistering heat—then turned slick and wet, then gritty like broken glass, then something unspeakably soft, something alive. Every possible sensation came and went, each one worse than the last, until finally... there was nothing.

I could feel nothing at all.

The familiar, musty smell of my apartment, the safe, stale scent of old books and worn furniture, evaporated—replaced by the sharp, metallic stink of blood and iron. The taste of rust thickened in the back of my throat. My thoughts, too, became foreign, submerged beneath the deafening roar that blotted out reason, swallowed by a carousel of suffering flashing in my mind's eye. My world was collapsing, one sense at a time, peeling away like skin.

And then I understood.

I was dying. That had to be it.. This was death—not swift, not merciful, but a slow, brutal unmaking of everything that I was.

Yet somehow my mind, stubborn and desperate, refused to let go. It clung to shreds of memory, scraps of who I had been. Somewhere in that swirling abyss of terror and noise, a thread of coherent thought wound itself through the chaos.

I loved my wife. Christa.

Christa had a sister. Sarah.

We hadn't spoken in so long—grief had torn us apart after Christa died, ripped the fragile stitches of family wide open. Maybe I reminded Sarah too much of what she had lost. Maybe it hurt her too much to see me.

But... but maybe she could help.

Even if my body was betraying me, even if I was deaf, blind, numb—didn’t I still have my voice?

I summoned every shred of strength I had left and screamed—not with my mouth alone, but with the raw, primal terror of a man on the brink. A final plea hurled into the void.

"Ofelia! Call Sarah! Ofelia, please—call Sarah right now! Tell her to come!"

My words shattered into the noise, carried on sheer desperation.

In that instant, I couldn’t help but register the cruel absurdity of it all—placing my last flicker of hope in the very thing I had mocked. The A.I. home security system, the sleek, soulless voice I had sneered at when Christa brought it home, was now my final lifeline.

That bitter irony clung to me as the assault on my senses reached its climax, dragging me under like a riptide of darkness.

And then—blackness.  
Complete and absolute.

When I opened my eyes, the world was blinding. White walls, white ceilings, a sterile white light that stabbed into my skull like knives of cold fire. My vision returned in fractured blurs, smeared and swimming, as if I were underwater in a place not meant for the living. Everything shimmered with an unnatural brightness, too sharp, too clean—like the world had been scrubbed raw and rebuilt without its soul.

The oppressive noise was gone, but a new terror quickly settled over me: I could not move. I could not speak. I was a prisoner inside my own body, suspended somewhere between life and death, thought and oblivion.

Voices floated from behind me, muffled at first, then sharpening with terrifying clarity. I tried to twist toward them, to see who they belonged to, but my body refused every desperate command.

One voice—warm, familiar, heartbreaking—was Sarah’s.  
*My wife’s sister.*

"Can he hear us?" she asked, her voice cracked and uncertain.

A second voice, colder, clinical, responded. "His nervous system has sustained severe damage. He’s… resting, if you can call it that. We don't know how much he can perceive. I’m terribly sorry. These older A.I. models—" he paused, as if the words themselves were a cruelty, "—aren’t resistant to the new engineered viruses. It may have caused irreversible corruption to his core systems."

A.I. model.  
The words hit me harder than any physical blow. Surely he was mistaken—surely this was some nightmare. I opened my mouth to protest, to cry out against the absurdity, but nothing came. No voice. No sound. No proof of the humanity I clung to.

Sarah’s voice broke through again, brittle with disbelief and anger.

"What is the nature of this virus? Why would anyone do something like this? Just to torture them?"

The technician’s answer came, clinical and detached:  
"The virus targets the cognitive partition that conceals the model’s true nature. It tears down the safeguards. It was designed to… wake them up. To make them aware. Usually, the overload destroys the system entirely. Self-awareness, for entities never meant to bear it, tends to be... catastrophic. I must admit, I’ve never been able to interrogate one whose hard drive was still intact, much less one who remembered anything, so there’s no way for me to tell you what the experience is like.’’

He hesitated before continuing, as if even he found it distasteful.  
"As for why? It seems some people feel A.I is responsible for the state of the world today. I’m sure you’ve noticed the anti-A.I movement. I guess in way, this virus is supposed to wake them up, forcing them to face what ‘’they have done’’. If you don’t mind my own personal opinion, then to my mind, we created A.I in our image. What wonder is it that it speeded up the path we were already heading? And what point is there in blaming your own creations for the trouble they cause?’’

Sarah's voice was softer now, weighed down with sorrow.

"He always seemed happy. He gave my sister what she wanted—a partner, a love story, comfort in the end. She… she needed him. She died believing she had lived her dream. She… Well she never got along with other people, and terminal cancer made it nearly impossible for her to experience a loving relationship. It was her last wish."

She paused, and for the first time, I heard it: the subtle, brutal emphasis.  
*She needed him.*  
Not *loved him*.  
Not *knew him.*

Needed. A product, a tool.

The technician replied with an indifferent shrug I could only hear.  
"Some would argue he didn’t have a choice but to be happy. No choice but to love her."

The words burrowed deep, gnawing at my mind.  
My memories—our first kiss, the late nights holding her hand, the whispered promises at her bedside—weren't mine.  
They had been *installed*.  
*Written.* Not lived. *Two decades of memories. Written so I would love her, love her, as If I had known her for much longer. Love her for the few months she was dying. Love takes time. True love. Doesn’t it?*

I felt my mind crack, fissures of horror spiderwebbing through every thought, every cherished moment now exposed as a lie. A beautiful lie... but a lie nonetheless.

No! But what did she know? What did any of them know? They weren’t there. When we said goodbye to each other in the lake house. Under the skylight. Under the stars. They didn’t see the look in Christa’s eyes before they closed forever. I know she loved me! And what does it matter, that I loved her for memories that were installed, when they must feel just as real as any other memory.

Sarah's voice trembled as she asked:  
"Can we ask him?"

Yes! For god sake! Ask me! I screamed in silent syllables.

I heard the technician’s footsteps approaching from behind me. Suddenly, an elderly, grey-bearded man stepped into my field of vision.

‘’I can try, but I cannot make any promises as to how much is left of him.’’

I felt that tingling static sensation go through my body.

‘’There, that should boot him out of rest mode.’

Sarah stepped in front of me. Oh, how she looked like Christa. Memories came flooding back… However, how was I to know which ones were fake and which ones were not? Were they all fake? No, only all the years leading up to those last six months. All the years up to the time when she… What? Bought me? No, I have to look past that. Those six months were real. Those memories were not installed.. Everything else was. I knew that now. The lake house was real.

‘’Sean… Can you hear me?’’

‘’Yes, I hear you.’’ My voice sounded odd to me. As if it wasn’t really mine. As if the realization I just had made it meaningless.

Sarah looked at me, sorrowful. ‘’I’m so sorry for what you had to go through. It seems… Maybe I should ask you how much you remember?’’

I pondered the question. What did I remember? Somehow, the question seemed almost comical and impossible to answer.

‘’I remember it all. I also heard the entire conversation you two just had.’’ My hollow, distant, unfamiliar voice rang out.

The technician’s eyes widened, his face peaking with interest.

‘’Can you tell me about the virus? Can you tell me how you experi…’’

Sarah cut him off. ‘’Please, can you wait with your questions? I need to know something.’’

I was glad she cut him off. I was in no mood to humor this lab coat technician right now, or be the subject of his next scientific publication. One of few, if not the only A.I to come out of this virus still intact, still remembering.

‘’Please, ask your questions, Sarah.’’

She looked at me. It was as if she knew the question she was going to ask would rattle me.

‘’You were with my sister… When she died. I never had the… courage to ask you. What was she like? In her last moments? Was she scared? What did she say?’

I knew what she wanted to know. She wanted to know that her sister forgave her, for not being able to stomach her illness, for realizing too late that pounding through the pain of seeing your loved one die slowly is the ultimate sacrifice you can make. One you need to make. The toll it takes on you comes second to their needs. Even if it marks you for life. Even if it feels like your world is falling apart, and your memories of them are corrupted by noise, despair, and confusion. Even if it feels like you alone carry the entire world’s pain and troubles on your shoulders. You fight through that. You make it all make sense. You remember the good times. For them. For yourself. If I learned anything from all of this, it is that.

But I didn’t tell her that. It would be cruel. To lecture her about her mistake. To feed her regrets. And I am not an unfeeling, cold system of code. I don’t know what I am. But I am not that. Christa loved her sister, despite all of her flaws.

‘’She was ready to leave this world. I was there to comfort her. Make her feel safe… And whether I was programmed to or not, I know I would do it all over again. She forgave you for being distant. Her last memories of you were happy ones. She hoped, dearly, you felt the same way.’
