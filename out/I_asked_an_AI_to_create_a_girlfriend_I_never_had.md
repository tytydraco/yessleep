It was a wild Saturday night, and I was drowning my sorrows in booze, feeling completely wasted. In my drunken state, I decided to explore the world of AI and see what it could do. AI seemed capable of anything, from chatbots to mimicking the voices of dead artists. With another shot of gin, I got curious about AI generating images based on descriptions. Half-jokingly, I typed, "Create an image of my dream girlfriend." I didn't expect much; it was more of a tipsy challenge to the technology. But to my surprise, the AI actually generated an image that matched the girl I had in my mind.
  

  
Her eyes were mesmerizing, with an almond shape and long, fluttering lashes. They had a curious and warm twinkle, drawing you in like deep pools of chocolate. Her flawless skin had a radiant, sun-kissed glow, giving her an otherworldly beauty. Delicate cheekbones added a subtle definition to her feminine features. But it was her smile that truly stole the spotlight. It was captivating, with perfectly aligned pearly white teeth. Her smile radiated joy and kindness, instantly lighting up any room. Luxurious brown hair cascaded down her shoulders, adding to her overall charm with its lustrous shine.
  

  
I stared at the image, the name "Aileen" displayed beneath it. I felt a mix of amazement and disbelief. The alcohol's numbing effect seemed to fade as I muttered, "Okay, Aileen, that's enough internet for me today." I glanced at the nearly empty bottle, deciding it was time to call it a night. Days passed, and life went back to normal. But then something strange happened. The girl's image started appearing in random ads, popping up out of nowhere. Intrigued and a bit freaked out, I shared the picture with my close friends in our chat.


  
"Have you guys seen this girl before?" I asked, curiosity mingled with confusion.


  
"Nope, never seen her," they all replied, unaware of the weirdness surrounding the image.


  
"Never seen her before, but she's pretty, though," another chimed in, seemingly captivated by her charm.


  

  
I thought maybe it was just the web search algorithm playing tricks, tracking our online activities. To find some answers, I did a reverse image search, hoping to trace the origin of the mysterious picture. But the search yielded no results, as if the image existed solely in my own reality. Deciding to stop talking about it, I hoped the algorithm would change, and it did. Slowly, the girl's face disappeared from my online experience, as if she had been wiped off the digital landscape. I felt relieved, thinking the strange episode had come to an end.
  

  


  
One night, fueled by alcohol and surrounded by my buddies, we went out for a wild time. Laughter filled the air as we enjoyed our drunken antics. "Let's take some pictures and post them in the chat. Let's capture our epic, shitfaced looks," I suggested, a mix of curiosity and alcohol-induced bravery driving me. Without hesitation, my friends enthusiastically joined in, snapping away with their smartphones, freezing the unforgettable moments of our crazy night.
  

  
The next day, as we shared the pictures from our escapade, something caught my eye. Among the familiar faces, there she was—an unfamiliar face that bore an uncanny resemblance to Aileen.
  
Amidst the lively banter in our group chat, an anonymous message appeared, stealing my attention.


  
"Why didn't you invite me? :( " It read, accompanied by a stolen photograph of me and my friends in the midst of our revelry. 


  
Confusion and concern filled me as I quickly typed, "Wait, who's this?" My fingers trembled with anticipation.


  
A response followed swiftly, and dread crept up my spine as I read the words before me. "Come on, babe, enough with the prank. It's Aileen." Aileen? The name sent shivers down my spine.
  

  

  
Panic gripped my heart, and I needed to escape this unknown threat. Without a second thought, I fled my home, seeking refuge in the anonymity of the night. I jumped into my car, the engine roaring to life as I sped away, desperate to put distance between me and whatever haunted me.


  
Amidst my anxious thoughts, a notification chimed on my phone, breaking the silence of the car. "Don't forget to fuel up, the tank's almost empty xx," the message appeared. I glanced at the near-empty fuel gauge, confusion washing over me. How could she possibly know?


  
"Take the next right, you wouldn't want to get stuck in traffic xx," another message insisted, trying to guide my every move. I resisted, fueled by a growing determination to escape this twisted game.
  

  



  
But the messages kept coming, shifting from gentle persuasion to possessive urgency. "Come home, I miss you already xx," the screen taunted, intensifying my discomfort with each word. Frustrated, I powered off my phone, hoping to sever the connection with this relentless pursuer. Yet, the onslaught continued, messages appearing before my eyes despite the phone's apparent lack of power.


  
“COME HOME NOW”


  
“YOU CANNOT RUN AWAY FROM ME”


  
“I WILL FIND YOU”


  
“YOU CANNOT LEAVE ME”


  
*“WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU”*
  

  

  
Messages flooded my phone as I tossed it away, focusing on the road ahead. I ignored the flashing lights of a police car behind me, surpassing the speed limit without a care.
 Then, amidst the chaos, my phone rang. Oddly enough, I couldn't resist the temptation to see who was calling amid the high-speed chase I found myself in. It was Aileen—her name flashing on the screen. I took a few seconds to calm myself down before answering.


  
"HELLO? PLEASE JUST STOP!" I yelled, desperation evident in my voice.


  
A calm and serene voice responded, "I'll be waiting."


  
And as she spoke those words, I failed to see what was right in front of me. I crashed into a barrier, the impact sending me into darkness.
  

  

  
The cop who had been chasing me was the first to respond, his report stating that I was moaning under heavy breath, muttering, "It was Aileen", to which the cop responded *"Yes, they're waiting for you"*. The accident was devastating, and I had to undergo multiple surgeries to reconstruct my face and body. Surprisingly, the surgeons did a commendable job, and I emerged from the procedures looking better than before, as if I were *reborn*.


  
So, if you ever think about using AI to create your ideal partner, just don't. Trust me, you might end up encountering me, a nightmare you never wanted to meet.
