  

I lied on my resume, and I don't feel really bad about it. Even though I wasn't really qualified to deal with the stuff I deal on every shift. Especially during the night shifts. It's rather bizarre and annoying. Mainly the fucking chipmunk. That bastard pissed on my keyboard already two times this morning. I thought about giving him back his eye, I usually don't see him for a couple of nights when I give it back, but I put it somewhere and can't be bothered to look for it.

I work in a small winery. It's just come and go sort of a shop. You tell me what wine you want, and I pour it in a bottle and give it to you. That's easy enough. For nobs or people who know more about wine than I there are five regals with different wines in glass bottles. I don't know a lot about wine, but I'm the only person who dares to take the night shifts, but that's a story for another time. 

During my twelve hour shifts I'm usually disgusted, horrified, or stunned, but mostly just bored, so I've decided to write down some of the stories that happened to me throughout my whole carrier. I don't think that I'll be able to actually get any other job, since I think that I might have accidentally made the deal with the devil, so I'll be working here long after I'm dead. But I like it here. I'd be gone in two months if I didn't like the job. Plus, the signal is terrible here and the town is almost hidden in plain sight. I dished up for a lot of folks who were just driving through and were truly surprised that there's even a town here. Usually, they get fuel from the gas station at the edge of the town and if they manage to get to the small shopping center without being eaten or enrolled into a cult they always seem so surprised to see a winery, so they stock up and continue on their travels. And it's perfect for me cuz' at least I'm not bothered by the feds.

The chipmunk: the chipmunk that I named Fart, on which he took a big offence, lives in the celling of the winery and is a huge piece of shit and I hate him. I don't know why the owner didn't get rid of him already, but it almost seems like he was the one who brought him there. Or it got away from the pet store which is right next to us. I always felt bad for the animals in that pet shop. Let's be honest about their quality of their life. Most of them are in a small enclosure in constant stress with a promise of getting an equally small cage to live in for the rest of their lives. It's a miracle if they see anyone else they understand or if the owner gets them a friend. But it's quite impossible to help them. I could buy the black bunny with white paws, but they'd just replace him with another one. I think I'm gonna get him anyway and get him a friend too, so they don't feel so alone. It's not a good thing to be alone, I know that from an experience.

But what deserves to live alone is Fart. I thought that I was seeing things when this little shit jumped from the celling in the storage room into the box with empty plastic bottles. I had a customer who wanted two liters of Chardonnay when I heard a large bang. First I thought that one of the closets gave out under the weight and peeked inside to see a small furry thing trying to get out the box.

,,What the hell?"

The small beast jumped up on my shoulder. I tried to gently put him on the floor to deal with him later, but he bit my finger and stood his ground.

,, Excuse me. I think that something is pouring on the ground." Shouted the customer. And surely the wine was overflowing from the bottle.

,,Damn it. I'm so sorry about that. I think I a squirrel got into the celling somehow." I quickly jumped to the faucet, took the bottle from underneath the flow and threw a rag on the floor. The small animal was still on my shoulder and was chewing on something. When I realized it was my hair. I yanked it from my shoulder on the floor.

,,What? A squirrel?"

,, It was right on my shoulder didn't you see? It's running in your direction now." I said while pointing on the furry rodent.

,,Hahaha, you're funny." The customer said.

,,I'm not joking it's right on your head." I pointed out.

,,Is my hair that messy?" Laughed the customer.

,, No, your hair is nice, but there's a chipmunk on it. You can feel it?"

,, Maybe you've done too much wine testing today. Don't worry I won't tell the boss. But could you ring me up? You're hilarious to talk to but I'm in a bit of a rush."

,,Of course." I brought over the wine, rang him up while he was still laughing. It was a bit unnerving because the stupid mouse was biting hard into his skin. Blood was dripping on the floor. 

,,Are you sure you're okay?" I asked as he was putting the bottle into his backpack.

,, Are you?" The customer returned the question. 

,,Yes, I'm peachy." I said sarcastically. 

,,Drink some water. Or you'll get a headache." Said the guy on his way out. 

,, I'm not drunk I just thought I saw something. I'm sorry. Have a nice day."

The chipmunk jumped right of his shoulder as he passed the threshold of the shop. The mouse looked my way and it looked like it was holding something. When I realized that it was a piece of the guy's ear I wanted to barf into the sink next to me. 

I don't get flustered that easily anymore and I didn't have a psychosis in twelve months, so I thought I'd check with the others via group chat about this thing. The store had it´s own Wi-Fi router since the Wi-Fi was otherwise patchy and unreliable. 

I learned that I wasn't losing my mind again which was amazing news. I did lose it one time and I wouldn't recommend. But I also learned that the chipmunk is only visible to the workers and to not be alarmed if he chews on some people. 

When I asked them why they didn’t warn me, they said that they were betting on when would I ask about it. 

I cleaned up the mess I made, the invisible blood on the floor and stared at the small animal. 

,, I'm gonna call you Fart." I said. The chipmunk stared at me unimpressed and then stuck out his tongue at me which was very unusual for a rodent. 

Since our first encounter, he hates me. He hides my notes, sometimes fiddles with the faucets and is rather more aggressive. 

One time he was sitting on the counter when I had a lot of (five) customers in the store and made me mess up on several occasions. I don’t know why, but somehow he managed to screw with the ipad on which I was typing the orders and every order would end up on the exact same number of payments: 621 311 251 521 dollars. I don’t know how he made the bill go up so high so quickly, but after his third attempt of ruining my day with constant cancellations of orders I looked at the numbers again and put the numbers to letters. It spelled 6 – F, 21 – U, 

3- C, 11 – K, 25 – Y, 15 – O, 21 – U.

I stared at him blankly for a second and pushed him of the counter with a great force. Sometimes when the aim and force was right, I´d actually hit him and I managed to do so right then. He was so surprised on the suddenness that he showed me the middle finger and ran away. And I had a more pleasant shift thanks to that. 

Well, that’s gonna be all for today, I have to go buy some plants for Marshall. You´re probably gonna hear about him too soon. I have to get his permission first, but yeah. If  you don’t hear from me again, you may assume that the chipmunk, figured out, how to get me killed. 

Thank you for your time
