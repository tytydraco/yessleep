When I was 12 years old, me and my friends wanted to do something fun in our small town. We then decided that it would be fun to explore an abandoned house. What we didn't know is that this would one year later turn out to be a murder mystery.

This was about 100 years ago, from the beginning of the 1920s to the 2020s. There were three brothers named John, Edward, and Theodore. John was a technician so he would often come to households to fix their electronics. Edward sold oil to households so they could warm their house (at that time they used oil to get the heat up) Theodore was the only one without a job because he had a mental illness. When they reached their 80s, Theodore committed suicide. This made the two brothers extremely depressed. John moved out of town to start a new life but Edward stayed. 10 years later Edward committed suicide, he died when he was 90. It's still to this day unknown what happened to John but he probably died of natural causes.

Me and my friends E, H, and S were exploring our small town. There lived about 2000 people in it. Everybody knew each other. S and her friend had seen an abandoned white house close to our school. We decided that we could explore that to see if we could get inside. Next to the white house was a workshop, connected to the house. The door was surprisingly opened. The windows were destroyed, and there was glass everywhere. We decided to go in. Once we were inside I could feel a presence that was with us. It felt like someone was following us. (I grew up with my grandpa haunting our house so I knew what the energy felt like) But other than that it was a pretty normal workshop until we got to what we decided to call "the saferoom" We would meet there to talk about what we've seen so far. It was pretty decorated and did not feel abandoned at all. We found a case. We decided to open it. There was a gun. Not a gun but it was the case to the gun. The case was not an ordinary case it was a handbag made out of metal. It was a big gun.

When we got out of the house there was an old woman that just kept staring at us. Ya'll know Elisa Lam right, when she looked out of the elevator. That was what that woman did. It felt like she played Pick-a-boo with us. Eventually after 10 minutes of her doing this she left. Once she left I looked at the house and looked at the window that was upstairs. Just so you know there was a ladder to the second floor but that ladder was broken. I saw a brown shadow walking across the window, not fast but slow. I could make out some face details. But I don't remember them.

**Winter 2018, five months after John died.**

It was a pretty normal day after Christmas day. I woke up late and ate breakfast when my friend sent me a video from Instagram where a group of people explored an abandoned house. She wrote "I wish we could figure out what really happened in that house we went to last summer" I thought with my skills I could gather some information about that house. Nothing. I ended up finding an article about a woman buying that house. It said that she bought it from John. I searched for his name and I ended up finding a family tree about him. I found his two brothers as well. There was nothing about the history of the house on the internet so I decided to ask my father that happened to live at the same time they were the most active. In the 80s.

They were pretty famous. One had actually repaired our TV in our house. Theodore committed suicide in the workshop WITH the gun. Edward took his life 10 years after Theodore did. Edward took his life in the house next to the workshop. However we could not get in there. In that house our other friend N had seen a shadow on the staircase walking upstairs, slowly. I asked more about this Theodore and what really happened to him.

**One month after we explored the workshop**

There were police officers and ambulances around the workshop. We later found out that they had found Theodore's body in the second floor. They thought that he had committed suicide. But the gun was too far away from him. Theodore had been murdered.
