The computer whirred as Officer Chase loaded up the drive and played back the footage taken from the deceased victim. A decent quality image developed on the screen, one showing the green, vibrant surroundings of Weeping River Forest—brilliant nature, but basked in an eerie, unnatural silence. The footage had come from the bodycam of a hunter and his partner, who’d both been sent into the forest to retrieve samples from animals inflicted with a thus far unknown disease. Of the two, only one of them ever returned.

*“I’m telling you, Frank, I hit it,” the person in view, Eric, claimed. In his left hand he held a hunting rifle, his right hand well removed from the trigger.*

*“Then where is it?” Frank asked, already appearing impatient.*

*“I don’t know, but it can’t have gotten far. That was a center shot.”*

*“Didn’t look like it from where I was standing.”*

*They pushed their way through the dense vegetation, searching for their prey. The picture bounced and lost focus as Frank brushed against the leaves and branches, momentarily obscuring the picture. When it returned, Eric was crouching behind a tree, where his target had fallen over, weakened by the blood loss.*

*“Told you I got it!” Eric proudly announced.*

*“Fine, I believe you.”*

*“You owe ten bucks.”*

*“Whatever, let’s get this done.”*

*Frank moved to get the animal closer into view, inspecting what appeared to be a little fawn. It had sustained a bullet wound to the edge of its abdomen, not high enough to his any vital organs, nor sever important arteries, which meant it would suffer a slow and miserable death. Oddly enough, it didn’t appear to bleed at all, and the short distance it had been able to cover didn’t make sense considering how bad the shot had been.*

*“Where do you think the mother went?” Eric asked.*

*“I don’t know. Didn’t see her anywhere.”*

*“Fawns don’t move around though, unless the mother’s already dead, right?”*

*“Yeah, they usually just hide and wait.”*

*They then noticed a more serious wound on its rump, an obviously old injury seemingly infected by a red, fungal-like pathogen based solely on its optical appearance. Both of the hunters seemed perplexed by the sight, inspecting it more thoroughly. Where the gash itself had come from, also remained a mystery. It hadn’t been shot, nor was the wound clean enough to have been caused by a knife. Though there were bears in the area, it didn’t resemble a bear attack.*

*“Is this what we’re looking for?” Eric asked.*

*“I have no idea. Check if the gunshot wound is lethal or put this damn thing out of its misery.”*

*“Alright, fine, hold on,” Eric said as he prepared his rifle for a euthanizing shot. “Wait, you seeing this?”*

*Eric bent down and inspected the newly created gunshot injury, which should have been bleeding more in spite of its unfortunate location. But something appeared to be preventing the poor creature from bleeding out. Inside the wound, small, red fibers could be seen, stretching in from the direction of its rump. It looked akin to the fungal infection already infesting its old injury, but it couldn’t have moved that fast, unless it was already digging its way towards the fawn’s organs.*

*“What is this shit?” Eric said as he reached his hand out to touch it.*

*“Don’t even think about—” Frank began, but it was too late. Eric had reached the red fibers, which immediately wrapped themselves around his finger, digging through his skin in less than a second. Eric yelped in pain and pulled his hand back, immediately severing the fungus.*

*“Fuck, what the hell was that?”*

*“Just do your damn job and kill the thing while I collect a sample. And for God’s sake, stop touching everything you see. Use your eyes!”*

*“Yeah, yeah, sorry,” Eric said as he finally loaded his rifle, and shot the fawn in its head, killing it instantly.*

*“Good, now we can work in peace. Did the thing hurt you?” Frank asked, not sounding convincingly concerned.*

*“It’s nothing. What exactly are we dealing with, though? Some kind of zombie deer disease?’”*

*“You mean chronic wasting disease? No, this ain’t it. In fact, this looks nothing like that. Remind me again why I brought you on this job?”*

*Frank, using a bit more consideration before touching the infected animal, put on gloves, pulled out a test tube, and cut off a piece of the infected flesh.*

*“This is for our friends at the university. They’ll know what in God’s name this stuff is.”*

With little more of note occurring as Frank secured his sample, and as Eric tended to his minor wound, the footage was forwarded to the hunters’ trek back to the town of Croydon. Officer Chase sighed, warning me of the uncomfortable sight that would soon come. Though I still felt uneased by the situation, even afraid, I had learned to suppress emotions like these.  

“You know, there’s no need to watch this. I can just describe what I saw.”

“Whatever happened, I can assure you I’ve seen worse,” I shot back.

“Alright, if you say so.”

*We now watched the hunters as they followed the main path out of the forest. Eric had fallen slightly behind, complaining about fatigue and asking for a short break. Frank turned to face him, letting out an annoyed grunt, which quickly turned to concern as he saw the state of his partner. Even from a distance, Eric looked noticeably worse for wear. His face had turned pale, droplets of sweat covered his face, and he slouched over as if struggling to stand on his feet.*

*“You alright?” Frank asked, finally able to feign a modicum of worry.*

*“Something—” was all Eric managed to get out, before violently vomiting the contents of his stomach onto the ground. His speech started to slur, and his gait became unsteady. Frank moved closer to support his struggling partner, and only then did we notice red strands of the same pathogen afflicting the deer, now covering Eric’s arm and neck.*

*“Jesus, why the hell did you have to go ahead and touch that fucking thing,” Frank asked as he went to assist Eric stand upright, but the strands of red fibers immediately started rubbing off onto Frank, and before either could react, Eric fell unconscious to the ground. Though both were large men, there was no way Frank could carry his weight without help.*

*“Eric!” Frank called out, gently slapping his friend’s face in a futile attempt at waking him. “I’m going to go and get help, alright? Just stay here. Don’t move!”*

*The footage ended shortly after, either from the camera being shut off, or due to malfunction. Whatever the case, I had gotten all the information I needed to proceed with my case.*

“Where are the men in the footage?” I asked, already assuming they had both perished following the infection, but I needed to know what had happened to their bodies.

“Eric Crawford was never found. We’re assuming that he tried to continue his escape, but in his state, he probably got lost. We’ve organized a search party, but—"

“You can cancel the search party. Eric Crawford is dead,” I interrupted.

“Even if that were the case, we still need to retrieve the body,” Officer Chase argued.

“Actually, you don’t. This case is no longer under your jurisdiction. Whatever killed these two men, needs to be handled with appropriate caution. Your supervisor has already received orders to comply with every request I make, and I expect you to do so.”

“What the hell are you talking about?”

“Call your captain, he’ll confirm.”

Officer Chase did as instructed, and though I wished the man no ill will, he was on a need-to-know basis. The more involved in the assignment he got, the more at risk his life would be. Pushing him aside was a kindness, all things considered, and a quick call was enough to confirm what I had already told him.

“Who the hell do you think you are?” he asked after hanging up.

“Someone who’s here to help,” I said. “Now, tell me what happened to Frank’s body.”

“Mr. Dale died a day later, suffering similar symptoms as his hunting partner.”

“And his body?”

“You haven’t heard?” the officer asked. “They cremated the body on orders from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We hadn’t even concluded our side of the investigation before I found the paperwork already signed on my desk.”

“Damnit,” I mumbled. “They overstepped their boundaries. Do you still have the samples?”

“Already shipped to the CDC,” Chase said. “But don’t worry, there are plenty more bodies where they came from.”

He was referring to the rapidly decreasing animal population within the forest, and the many bodies that had been found with similar injuries. Luckily, the hikers and hunters had mostly thought it better to leave them alone, alerting the authorities without touching the clearly infected animals, an act which had absolutely prevented a major outbreak. All that remained was to contain the threat and ascertain its origin.

“We already escorted a team of biologists and whatnot to investigate inside the forest. You don’t happen to know them?”

“I’m afraid I don’t. Would you take me to them?”

“Since I’m under obligation to follow your every whim, sure,” the officer responded sarcastically.

Because the company had sent me in with only limited information about the newly discovered organism, I was in the dark as to exactly what I was dealing with. But the first part of my job was to designate a threat category to the pathogen and recommend further actions to contain it. So, with the assistance of a few officers, I would be taken to the site of the infection, deep inside the heart of Weeping River Forest.

\*\*\*

Officer Chase let me ride in his patrol car, taking me directly to the scientists in the forest. Progress was slow along the dirt road which had seen better times. Based on the blooming plants and greenery, one would never suspect that something within had gone awry. Chase, naturally, was curious, and kept pushing for answers, wanting to know more about the purpose of my visit, and what kind of threat we were dealing with.

“I have a family, you know. I need to know if I have to get my kids out of town,” he argued.

“Don’t you worry about that, Officer. If we get to that, I’ll make sure people make it to safety.”

“Come on, man. I’m doing you a favor. How about you return it?”

Letting the request sink in, I hesitated to answer, mostly to innocently tease the untruthful driver. I understood his need to know, but he’d be happier if he was left in the dark.

“Well, I’d help you, but since you don’t have a family…” I let my words trail off.

“Fine, I lied. You can’t blame me for trying, though?” he asked, almost embarrassed.

After a twenty-minute drive into the forest, we were about to reach the end of the road and were met with a roadblock kept under control by two more officers. Next to them stood a parked patrol vehicle and van undoubtedly used to transport science equipment for the field team that was nowhere to be seen.

“Chase, what are you doing here?” one of the officers asked.

“I’ve been given the great honor of bringing Doctor Livingston to join up with the CDC team onsite,” Chase said, again with a delightful hint of sarcasm.

The officer sighed, “fine, but you stay here until I’ve called them.”

Using a radio, he called one of the scientists onsite and explained the situation. The deal remained the same—we were to wait at our location until the leader of the operation could pick us up. Half an hour later, a woman dressed in a hazmat suit arrived at our checkpoint. Only once she had crossed the line did she remove the helmet to introduce herself as Lisa Pearson, the doctor in charge of what she called a research expedition. While I had heard her name in some of my scientific circles, I hadn’t been notified that she’d be in charge of the mission.

“Doctor Livingston, I presume. I’ve been awaiting you,” she said with a sly smirk.

“Awaiting me?” I asked. “Is that so?”

“I got a rather stern call from one of your supervisors and was advised that my career depended on our cooperation.”

“More than just our careers, I’m afraid,” I explained.

“That’s how I understood it too,” she agreed, surprisingly unaffected by what could only have been perceived as threats. “Shall we?”

Before venturing beyond the checkpoint, I was ordered to don a hazmat suit like her. Since the nature of the pathogen remained uncertain, we couldn’t tell whether or not it was airborne, or purely transmitted by touch. Taking off my coat, my holstered gun was left clearly visible, but while the officers seemed uneased by the fact, Pearson seemed almost unfazed. Putting on the hazmat suit, I reattached my holster on the outside, refusing to leave my arm behind. In addition, the belt held a flashlight, a knife, and a lighter.

Leaving the officers behind, I joined Doctor Pearson as we headed deeper into the forest, straying off the dirt road. Though I had noticed it before, the overwhelming silence only became apparent once we’d gotten far enough away from town to not be able to hear the sounds of traffic and people. I’d expected at least birdsong and insects, but there was nothing except for the wind blowing through the trees to be heard.

“I’ve read some of your work, Doctor Pearson. I particularly enjoyed your paper on the possibility of an undetected, upcoming prion epidemic.”

“I’m impressed you’ve read it, mostly considering it wasn’t ever published among fears it might cause mass hysteria.”

“I have my contacts,” I replied.

“Oh, I know. I’ve heard a lot about your work. I have high expectations from you on this assignment.”

Genuinely surprised by that last statement, she had piqued my curiosity. “In my field of work, having a reputation is ill advised. How come you’ve heard about me?”

“I have my contacts,” she cheekily replied.

Thin, red strands began to appear among the moss and grass on the ground, all leading towards a point deeper within the forest. In the distance we could hear chatter, slightly muffled underneath the hazmat suits I assumed them to be wearing.

At the research site we met with two fellows working under Doctor Pearson, with two more not onsite, tasked with following the many red fibers littering the ground. The two that were present were hanging over a quickly set up field lab, where they’d examined a dissected animal. Its organs lay on display, wrapped in what I assumed was a fungus, which had turned gray and brittle once the animal had perished, and because the connection to the red strands and cords that led even further into the forest had been severed Two other animals lay ready for examination—another one severed from the strands, and a third, still connected, still breathing, but unconscious. The latter still had the fresh, red fibers attached, a fact I made note of.

“Mark and Gerard aren’t back yet?” Pearson asked.

“Not yet, should I radio them?” Jane replied.

“Give them time, I have a new colleague to introduce you to. This is Doctor Livingston.”

Pearson introduced me to her two crewmembers—Jane Davies, and Gerard Hudson. Those absent were Mark Lawrence, and Bill Connor.

The two briefly shook my hand, seeming almost offended that their work would be interrupted by another party. I suspected they didn’t wish to share the credit. Neither acknowledged the weapon I carried, but their attitudes towards me remained rather cold.

“What can you tell me about the organism?” I asked.

“Well, I can tell you what it’s not,” Jane began.

“Go on.”

“When we first encountered an infected specimen, we suspected the pathogen to be some kind of fungus.”

“I take it it’s something else.”

“It’s not viral, bacterial, fungal, nor a prion. It’s parasitic in nature, considering it feeds off living creatures, but it holds no resemblance to any known species. These red fibers we see scattered around the jungle, are covered in non-striated muscle cells, with primitive intestinal tubes and a vascular system. There’s even evidence of a near invisible, but sophisticated nervous system.”

“Conclusion?” I asked.

“We don’t have one yet, but the organism doesn’t seem to belong to any one part of the phylogenetic tree. It seems almost… engineered.”

Jane paused, letting me digest the information she’d just handed me. Despite the obvious dangers posed by the organism, she didn’t seem worried. In fact, she seemed almost gleeful as she explained the specifics, excited to be studying a brand-new form of life. I had to respect her enthusiasm.

“Why was only one the specimens left alive?” I asked.

“Because we—"

Before Jane could answer the question, a fourth member of the team came stumbling through the forest, out of breath and frazzled. But his partner was nowhere in sight.

“Where’s Mark?” Jane asked, worry clearly present in her voice.

“He’s stuck—trapped inside a cave—I couldn’t—I couldn’t help him,” Bill managed to get out between gasps for air.

“Tell me exactly what’s going on,” Pearson demanded.

Bill collapsed to the ground in exhaustion, clearly having sprinted quite a distance to get help. Once he’d taken a few seconds to compose himself, he started explaining what had happened.

“We followed the fibers into the forest. Along the way they were converging into thicker cords, all leading to the same place—going inside a bear dwelling, which was connected to a cave.”

“Did you go inside?” I asked.

“No, it would have been too risky. We were going to come back and inform Doctor Pearson, but then we heard someone call for help from inside the cave. It sounded like they were stuck,” Bill explained. “I tried to convince Mark that we needed to get help, but he refused to listen—he went inside alone.”

“And you let him?” Jane yelled, agitated.

“What was I supposed to do, drag him back with me?” Bill asked.

“You should have done something!” Jane went on.

“You can berate him later,” Pearson said. “Can you show us where it is?”

“I suppose we could just follow the red strands,” I chimed in, to which Bill just nodded enthusiastically, not ready to voluntarily return.

“Then let’s go,” Pearson said, already gathering a few tools in preparation to leave.

“No, you’re staying here. I’ll go alone,” I argued.

“The hell you will. I’m coming with you,” Jane demanded.

She wouldn’t back down, but the intrigue about the organism had been entirely replaced by worry about her colleague. Though keeping a brave façade, she was visibly trembling, but not with fear for her own safety.

“It’s dangerous.”

“Hence the gun?” she asked. “I was in the marines for a while. I have no aversion to danger. And I don’t need you to guarantee my safety. I’m coming with you, and that’s that.”

Knowing I held no real authority over the team, I agreed to let her come. She was capable, that much was clear, and more importantly, she was determined. Pearson and the rest of her team would remain behind, alerting the officers to the possible dangers, and should the need arise, Person would know who to contact. With that in mind I left her with my own cellphone, the only means of contacting my supervisor at the company.

“If we don’t return within the next hour, you call this number, and tell them we’re dealing with a category five encounter.”

“What exactly does that mean?” Pearson asked.

“Just tell them. Promise it.”

“I will.”

“One hour.”
