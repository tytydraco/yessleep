It’s been a week since my very first unusual encounter with the “Strange Creature”. My nights have become restless and my thoughts started to be more hectic. My anxiety skyrocketed and I’m not going to lie….I’m scared. Really come to think of it, my neighbor is happy, I haven’t complained about her dog interrupting my sleep anymore. I can’t bring it in me to complain actually. what I saw has left a eternal place inside my mind. 

Well aside, my week has usually been the same as always from the outside looking in, but my work ethic completely dropped in productivity. I’m letting this affect me so much that it’s costing me my job... My boss has been constantly worried about my work, but how does one tell management “yeah I got a monster roaming around my backyard every night!” It sounds so fucking dumb when speaking out loud. I wanted to get this work week through so quickly. My body reacted as if I was discharged from the army after seeing my buddies die. It was in every waking thought—My brain completely overstimulated from the thought of the creature. All I wanted was to figure out what it was, I was determined this Friday to finally capture what’s been constantly strutting around my backyard. 

When Friday came around I contemplated it but ended up calling out of work. When talking to my boss I blame it on my health issues, telling my boss that’s why my work ethic was down this week. Good thing I was great friends with my boss because he held his tongue back, but I could clearly feel the annoyance in his tone. I couldn’t work anyways… I stayed up after work all night Thursday and the entire day that Friday. Time was under a spell to only move like molasses because the seconds felt like hours. I was anxious, I didn’t even eat the whole day because my stomach was completely contorted. I bickered and bit at my lips peeling the dead skin off them all day. I never addressed the sun stepping outside once till it was time for me to face my fears. 

When 11pm hit, my body turned into the static on TV.  I guess the lack of sleep finally caught up to me. I could feel my muscles slowly sink into the soft cushions of my couch rubbing against them. I wanted to sleep. My eyelids couldn’t hold on any longer as they let go of the 10 pound dumbbells of curtain eyelids when suddenly; The quiet Nature of silent ambience clashed with the loud uproar of my Neighbors dog barking. His loud voice was more roaring than ever, almost to the point I felt like he was in my house.

It was time but I genuinely couldn’t conjure the courage to power my feet up. My body felt stiff like a totem pole as I sat so deep into my sofa. I’m pinched at my fingers, biting down on my mouth to push myself up. Trying to give myself affirmation to get up so I can confront this demon. Suddenly — The loud roar from the dog turned to a child’s whimpering, then pure silence. The silence echoed even louder than the dog’s roars. Never once in the weeks of the dog barking has it abruptly stopped. It terrified me even more, sending a shock through my whole entire body. I soon heard the rustling of plants, as if a theft was breaking into my house in my own front yard. My body finally recovered and I leaped as fast as I could to see what was really going on.

My heart sank down to the floor and I couldn’t breathe once again. Goosebumps began to flow down my entire body and I felt every bump brush against my clothes. Sweat profusely poured down my body too as if I jumped into a lake before anything. 

It was there. 

It was there. Bent over, crouch over. It was sluggish dragging its feet as it walk across my grass lawn. It was a monster. It’s skin purplish and covered with tiny hairs. Eyes were Crimson Red and it — doubled in eyes. The intense air almost made me fall to my knees. It’s aura so intensely overpowering me. I felt like a man child. I don’t know how to describe it at all. With the little energy I consume, I snap a photo of it… 

I sat there for hours as it disappeared from my eyes, but never my mind. I don’t know what to say anymore. I don’t know what’s wrong or right. How can I go on about my day with the discovery of this Strange Creature. Does anyone truly believe me???
