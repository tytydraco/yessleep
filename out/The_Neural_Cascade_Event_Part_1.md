Entry 1

I worked at a government testing facility. I ran away, leaving my coworkers to clean up the mess. I will not disclose the details of this site, as even if I wanted to host some kind of inspirational raid to stop the atrocities taking place there, you lot wouldn’t get past the first gate. The more details I unveil, the more likely this post will be swiftly covered up and dealt with, as well as my existence. Just assume these are the ramblings of a mad man. This is less of an exposé piece and more of a confessional, praying it may abstain me of my sins. I’m not a religious man but I now know there are things beyond this world, or at the very least, our understanding of it, so I might as well try and cover ass.

I also think it wants me to tell you all about it... I’m not sure. I haven’t been the same since. A throbbing pain permeates inside my skull, clouding my thoughts. It’s a constant pressure from within, sitting behind my eyes, travelling all the way through to the back of my head, caressing me as it fades down my spine. It’s consistency and my nebulous mind has created a constant brain fog, so forgive me if my writing is nonsensical at any point. Again, ramblings of a mad man.

I’ve seen my fair share of horrible things. To be honest, we’re not entirely ethically sound there. The workers’ silent motto is “the ends justify the means”. It helps us all sleep at night if we think we’re doing something for the greater good at the end of the day, finding comfort in some self-imposed moral ambiguity. Yet no amount of mental gymnastics can excuse what we’ve done.

August 19th, a team debrief was held to establish understanding of our next project. Bright and early in the morning my four other colleagues and I filed into the observation room, its interior white like sugar - glistening, pristine surfaces covering every square inch. We gather in the corner, beside the hissing coffee machine, in a queue waiting for our turn. A window into the world we would watch daily filled the wall opposite us. Our debriefer followed us in and stood in front of it. The window and him separated by our workstations, long tables connected and covered in computers and stationery. At first glance it hardly resembled a research lab, more akin to an interrogation room.

Our debriefer read from a clipboard, barely able to see past the mounds of eye bags that rest between his tired gaze and his reading material, droned on about a new, experimental, “revolutionary”, form of communication, lips loose as each word fell out of his mouth. Not a single person in the room was convinced; we all just took notes and followed along begrudgingly like anyone on a Monday morning would. The debriefer looked like Monday morning incarnate. Craig, the man on my right, letting out sigh as he wrote, the woman on my left was visibly rolling her eyes. I’d worked with this team before, some members more than others, and we were no strangers to failed experiments. In fact, I used to work with Craig a lot, and at one point, I even considered him a friend. In recent years, Craig has endured a melancholic depression due to the passing of his wife years ago. Suicide.

Suddenly, what felt like an encore of my morning alarm shook me to attention, waking me more than its predecessor. However, this alarm took the form of a mess of a professor bursting through the door, almost crashing into our desks, then steadying himself as he stood next to our debriefer. A flurry of emotions spewed from this man's demeanor, from frustration to excitement to exhaustion to... paranoia? He was a mess. Untucked shirt, titled glasses, messy hair. He had the eyes of a man lacking sleep, as well as the desire to do so. Yet his chin held so high all he could do is look down on us. As if he could grace the gods themselves. He did not have an ego or high self-esteem. His sin was the pride he had for his work.

“This is no ordinary communication technique!” He announced, emphasizing his words with dramatic hand movements. “Listen well please. I have designed a quick procedure that alters minds. You can think of it as a form of mental walkie-talkie, if you wish to keep your view skewed, just know that it is so much more than that. They have unlocked, um-” a brief pause, lost in thought. “No, actually, I won't get into the details.” He stammered. He went on, and during his tirade our previous debriefer and this raving loon had come to a non-verbal agreement that the old debriefers' work here was done, as he handed over his clipboard and shambled out of the room.

“All I need from you all is to follow the tests I put in your mission outlines and take extremely detailed notes.” The professor said. He walked to the door, this time much calmer and purposeful. “Telepathy people. This is telepathy.” He said over his shoulder on his way out. I now notice that the room's tone had shifted to curious and awake. He couldn’t be serious, right? Maybe he put receivers in these poor people's brains that read their thoughts and sent them to the others. Yet somehow the way he’s talking about it makes it seem worse and more complicated than that. Telepathy? This building is for science, not magic.

All we could do as a team was share a few confused glances before our mission began. Five people, each wearing button up shirts with their allocated number, entered the room beyond the glass wall. Their new home was big enough to comfortably fit them all, full of beds, two private bathrooms in the back-end corners of the room, male and female, a dining table and chairs, and a shelf of reading material present opposite the door they came in. We were to watch these people through our one-sided window for an undisclosed amount of time. And they had “telepathy”. “Ridiculous” was the conclusion I came to.

As I’m recounting my experiences here, I’ve realized that my head is spinning, and the sweat is starting to pool at the base of my keyboard. I wish none of this was true, I wish to return home, I wish to not know what I know. It terrifies me. Anxiety is swelling up in my throat. I feel as though I’ve drunk enough to cause a night full of regret. And it's all beginning to bubble over. The room is shifting and rotating like I’m a lost sock in a broken washing machine filled with shit. My heart sinks below the floorboards of the filthy shack that I've found myself in. Even below the surface I can feel it pounding and urging me to stay alert. Eyes are on me. I’m surrounded by whispering voices that want in, but I won’t let them get to me. Bangs on the door rattle through my ear drum, piercing my skull with each thump, and I feel as though I’m going to collapse. I heave and I heave but nothing leaves me. No barf. No breath. Only desperate wheezes.

Until it stops.

I haven’t drunk a drop of liquor. My room is clean, as it should be. I’m alone, no whispers, no banging. Its ok. I’m ok.

But it feels close.

I’ll continue retelling my story tomorrow.

Entry 2

Whatever “procedure” the professor spoke of earlier had already taken place. All that was left was to test and observe.

The first few days were boring and normal. They all engaged in small talk and got to know each other. A young Korean girl, maybe in her early twenties (She was labelled number 1 on her uniform), confided with a single mother from Bangladesh, she had the most caring eyes and had a strong maternal instinct (number 2). A shorter Caucasian man, (3) was telling an equally short, older uncle from Singapore (4) about his gambling troubles (the reason he’s here). The Singaporean listened intently and tried to give advice with his hands comfortably sitting behind his back. The gambler did not listen in return, only vented. A tall African American man (5) immediately inspected the collection of reading material on the shelves. He seemed quiet and was by far the most physically fit in the group.

Their life details and anything that may be important are in our files. We were encouraged to still use their numbers, not their names. According to our records these were test subjects, not people, it’s almost barbaric. A lot of people here only saw them as such, subjects that aided in the advancement of, well, whatever the government wished to advance, I suppose. Craig was always against this. Made him furious that they “weren't even granted the basic human decency to have a name.” Even now, I can't remember their names.

*Test 1-*

It was simple. We ask them to briefly tell us how they’re feeling, what they’re thinking about, then to think of something specific.

Korean girl (1) was first-

“okay”, “home”.

“Think of sunflowers.” Craig spoke to them through a speaker.

Bangladesh woman (2)-

“tired”, “my children”, again, told to think of sunflowers.

By this point we’d forgotten the professor's speech, and the drawl of work took us over again, sifting through tests and notes as our tasks wore on.

The gambler (3)-

“bored”, “money,” sunflowers.

Singaporean uncle (4)-

“Huh? Oh! Happy", “my new friends.” Sunflowers.

The fit dark-skinned man (5)-

“intrigued”, “your book collection.” Sunflowers.

We then went on to record their brain activity, blood pressure, etc. All baseline stuff. We repeated these tests every three hours for the first day with no noteworthy results. At 2200 hours our coworker, Dylan, a gruff man and a heavy cynic, grabbed the microphone to speak to our guests.

“Do any of you feel anything worth noting?” He grumbled past his thick beard.

“... I’m tired of thinking about sunflowers. hahaha” the Singaporean uncle chimed.

“Do the rest of you feel this way?” Dylan asked the room. His question was answered with shrugs and silence. After a sigh he asked “Hear any... voices? In your head that... aren’t your own?”

He was jumping a bit forward. These tests were specifically structured. We weren’t sure how much the patients knew of what the results of the procedure were, but I knew he was not supposed to ask that. I suppose it didn’t matter as his question was once again greeted by a confused silence. “Typical.” Dylan huffed, off mic, to only himself, I suppose. He walked away and promptly clocked off for the night. Dylan would be in deep shit once this got out, the higher ups are very particular. He was prone to frustrated out bursts at tests he thought were a waste of time.

“What do you mean “voices”?” The tall number 5 asked. We had no answer to give to our neighbors on the other side of the window, so we gave no answer. Anything outside of taking notes and tests was above our pay grade anyway, so we all began packing up and clocking out too.

Gabriella, Craig, and I were the last to leave. Gabriella was shy and thorough with her notes, so she stayed a while to revise and observe at her station. She was deep in her files like a cave diver dislocating themselves just to enter a virgin passage, a hair tie holding back her deep brunette hair from hindering her work. She only halted every now and then to push up her thick framed glasses. I was tired and made myself another coffee on my way out, Craig joined me, though we didn’t speak, so I passed silent glances between Gabriella, the test subjects, and my feet, as if they were playing some invisible three-way tennis match. We, the lucky few, witnessed their first signs. “Stupid sunflowers.” The Korean girl, the gambler, and the Singaporean uncle moaned in unison. They looked at each other confused, as did we. They began a debate on coincidence or not. An hour of overtime note taking and observing, and the rest of us window watchers were able to head home.

This was the first time they did that, spoke in unison I mean, lord knows it's not the last.

I can still hear their synchronized groans.

I need a drink before I think about this anymore. My heart rate is through the roof. Maybe writing this was a bad idea.

Entry 3

I forgot to write today (yesterday?). Forgetting feels nice. Easily achievable with the appropriate amount of pain killers and alcohol. I’ve made sure to stock my temporary motel room with said supplies and spent the day partaking in them. It doesn’t help the dizziness, but I finally feel mental quiet and physical numbness.

I don’t know why I’m even hiding. Why I’m jumping from motel to motel. It could find me if it wants. I’m sure if anyone else from my old job was looking for me, they’d find me too.

It just feels right. To run. It's all I can do.

I’m sorry, Craig, if you're out there. I didn’t mean for this to happen. Any of it.

That last look you gave me will haunt me the most.

Entry 4

Day two of the experiment wasn’t noteworthy, except for the fact that Dylan didn’t come in. In fact, he never came in again. Who knows if he got fired or if another terrible fate befell him. We went on as usual, though. Test, watch as their food is delivered and eaten, test, watch, test. More baselines, asking them how they’re feeling, etc., etc.

In-between tests I tried to make small talk mixed with half assed attempts at humor with Craig and the rest of the crew. “Lovely day for it, huh?” knowing we’d be inside our windowless box all day, the weather not affecting us in the slightest. I don’t think they heard me, because they didn’t laugh. Gabriella buried herself in her work, the woman I don't know the name of would give one-word answers out of politeness but clearly did not want to be spoken to (I did learn her name was Alexa though). And Craig, well, the usual, barely receiving eye contact let alone a conversation. His eyes were sunken and soulless, and he’d lost the extra weight he had around him and then some. He’s still torn up inside over what happened. Does he know it eats away at me too? Or does he sense me as the catalyst? I don’t know what led us to continue to work here, but here we are, the invisible hand of fate guiding us along.

I stewed in my own anguish for most of that day. Silent crew, lack luster results, Craig, all of it was dragging me down. At the time I remember wanting nothing more than a drink, but my 2-month company mandated sobriety streak loomed over me, so a coffee would have to suffice.

The professor snapped me out of my mental crisis with yet another unannounced intrusion.

“After receiving your reports yesterday, I updated your work outline. I’m aware that there are cameras that are monitored, and the recordings are checked, however, I have brought up the possibility of 24-hour personnel monitoring with the higher ups, and they seem to agree.” This alone would’ve brought my blood pressure up another notch, resulting in a very good reason to break my sobriety. If it weren’t for his next sentence, that worsened things still. “So, if anything... happens, we have eyewitnesses. They called me mad, but I already know this will be a great success.” This man and his cryptic nonsense were going to send me over the edge today.

“Are you going to explain a single thing to us? How can we do our job without the facts? Now we’re supposed to monitor them 24/7?” I hissed through clenched teeth, stress weighing on me.

“We don’t know the details of what happened to these people or what will happen. Do they even know?” Craig announced, stepping forward. Craig was a selfless, soft man. He wasn’t even surprised about the extra hours, he just wants to help these people. Looking at him, I noticed that he’d turned pale.

“We’re getting paid overtime for this right?” Alexa added.

“Yes, yes. Please trust me, we will get to all that soon. In the meantime, ... Do your fucking jobs.” The Professors smiley answer turned to a spit and a snarl. On his way out, he mentioned one last thing over his shoulder. “You will be paid double for this of course.”

We apparently need the money just as much as the people beyond the glass because at the end of the day we’re all still here. Exiting our observation room, at the end of the hall, past the locked door of the test subjects, is our new home, fitted with beds, a kitchen, a bathroom and of course a full camera monitoring set up so we can continue our work, day in, day out. We were only allowed in this room outside of regular working hours. Anyone not agreeing to these terms and who wants to go home was instructed to do so but not to return.

Entry 5

There was a knock at my door last night, at least I think there was. Of course I didn’t answer, I didn’t even have the courage to get out of bed. It came during my extensive nightly attempt to sleep after my last entry. Just three quick taps of my motel door, a fair few feet away from me and instantly my breath was caught in my chest, I was unable to move a muscle. Like stone, like I wasn’t even alive, I lay there unmoving, waiting. Waiting for what, I don’t know, but the lord knows I waited. Waiting while the room is filled with nothing but the ticking clock above my head, heart lurching with every tick. And dread. The room was filled with dread, up to the brim. My ears catching every sound, I swear I could hear my own blood pump and yet I couldn’t tell if my heart was as still as I was or if it was fluttering and fleeing the confines of my ribcage. It must have been hours before I almost had the courage to shuffle an inch again. Alas, before my freedom was granted, another knock came. Another quick three taps. How could this be? The exact same knock, hours apart. I was surely hearing things again, I must be. But this felt so real, and my delusions come in quick intense spats, not this prolonging torture.

Was it there? On the other side of the door. Waiting as I too am waiting. Still, as I too am still! Barely breathing as I too am barely breathing! I must be going mad. I can’t take this anymore, I thought. Now I knew for certain that my heart was racing, pumping, pounding! I was about to get up. Dear god I was actually about to go face this thing. Launch from my bed and lunge at the door, a desperate attack, an attempt better than nothing. Better than laying here for eternity. A clashing of symbols, an impact of a waterfall, a climax of an explosion, a RUSH. Fighting the bed sheets that engulfed me, I escaped my own mental restraints and sprinted for the door. Before even a blink could arrive, I did. Right at the door. Fate on the other side.

Of course it was empty. Of course nothing was there. I stood with the door swung open and nothing but cool air brushing against me like a mother caressing and calming a child. As I began to close the door, as it slid past my face and almost shut, I saw it.

A letter sat at my feet.

Entry 6

By now it was August 28th, and we had adjusted to our living standards quickly. Alexa and Gabriella got along well, sharing notes, theories, and even started talking about their personal lives. Gabriella wanted to start her own lab and studies. Me and Craig even began to talk. Small talk and work talk but still talk.

I pushed open the door to our main observation room that morning, balancing a paper cup filled with coffee. Craig was already there, leaning against the counter, staring through the glass.

“Morning,”.

Craig snorted. “Barely. You look like you lost a fight with your alarm clock.”

“I did,” I replied. “It won by a landslide.”

“Good to see you’re still getting your sleep”

I scoffed. “I wouldn’t say that”

“Struggling huh?” He took a sip from his own coffee. “Yeah, me too. If they’re going to force us to sleep here, they could at least give us some half decent mattresses.”

We shared a chuckle, even though we both knew the mattresses weren’t the issue. Then we went to work. We had a routine and things were nice. The subjects reported nothing more than difficulty sleeping, increased appetite and a small amount of anxiety, all of which could be attributed to their environment, so we brought in some requested items for each of them. The Bangladesh woman requested a photo of her family, the Singaporean uncle requested a potted plant, the gambler wanted his marriage ring (he was divorced), the African American man wanted a book from home, and the Korean girl shyly requested her bear plushy, said it helped her sleep.

It was going smoothly. Those were the best days of the experiment. The last good day of our lives.

“What’d you say?” The gambler said as he got up from his bed. Confused glances spread throughout their room as we, the watchers, leaned forward at our workstations.  “Don’t act dumb! What did you say? I “stink”?!” He said something along those lines. This time he received a series of “Huh's” and “what’s”, confusion and tension growing. His gaze was locked onto the Korean girl sitting on the floor with her bear plushy. Her innocence radiated from her, yet the gambler was in denial. He approached her and swiftly yanked her bear away from her.

“I didn’t say shit, you freak!” She screamed in retaliation. “You do stink though.” she grumbled under her breath. This girl was usually quiet, for such a sudden outburst the plushy must’ve meant a lot to her. She couldn’t have been younger than 19 yet she clung to it like a child. By this escalation, the rest of the room began defending the girl.

“What? No, I’m not crazy... I-” he said with shaky breaths as he held his head with one hand and the bear with the other. “No. No! I know what this is. This isn’t how it was meant to be. He said it was like a walkie-talkie! We can just turn it off. Why are you able to hear what I think without my consent! Why can I hear you all! Judging me!” he shouted, fear in his voice, holding the bear high.

*Test 2-*

Craig once again had control of the microphone as he instructed the room to calm down and return the girl's belongings to her. They were told to sit on their respective beds and listen.

“Number one, I need you to focus. Please tell us what you're thinking,” Craig asked.

“I want to go home. Are you sure I’ll be safe in here?” The girl said. Her rage had subsided and was replaced with a growing fear.

“Please look at the rest of your roommates and decide if you can understand what they are thinking" Craig visibly gulped down his empathy as he forced himself to ignore the girl's question and follow the script in our work outline.

“No, I have no idea what they’re thinking.” She responded.

“Number two, what are you thinking about?” Craig continued.

“I think Number three should be removed from this experiment after that outburst.” The Bangladesh woman confessed, her motherly instincts most likely wanted to take care of our youngest guest.

“Please look at the rest of your roommates and decide if you can understand what they are thinking," Craig repeated. After some deep thought, she had an answer for this seemingly silly question.

“I think... someone is thinking of sunflowers again.”

“Number three-” Craig began.

“This is bullshit” The gambler cut off the voice echoing out of the speaker. “And I think someone wants their bear back” he continued. Odd, since the girl already had her bear plushy returned to her.

“Number four.”

“Well, uh, I must admit I was thinking of sunflowers.” The old Singaporean sat, staring at the Bangladesh woman who stared back. “I think she’s thinking of her children.”

“Number five.”

“I... want my bear back...” The tall intimidating African American man sat so smally as he said this, staring at his hands and hunched over.

“That is all for now.” one last note from Craig before he turned off the microphone and leaned back in his chair, brushing his hair back with a long exhale. The people inside the room split off into their usual groups and quietly discussed the results of this test. Number five sat on his own and read. We took our notes.
