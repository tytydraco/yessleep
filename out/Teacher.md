I was a teacher about 8 years ago at a popular private school in town, no one could have predicted how my life would tragically end. 

I was young, I had two babies and what I thought was a loving husband. We had our issues, our disagreements, what married couple doesn’t. He had his mental health issues as well but we also had the American dream, we had love. 

I loved my students as well, always lending them a helping hand, and a listening ear. What more could a person want than a career where they’re appreciated and valued, while having a home life worth  coming to. Not to mention my uber supportive parents too. I had it all, until I didn’t. That night would change everything.

That morning started with an outburst from my husband, he was ranting about heaven knows what, but by evening it seemed the dust had settled. He even sent the kids away for the night to give us some time alone together. How sweet of him, I know he doesn’t mean to get as angry as he does.

We came home from an evening dinner together, I remember the air was damp and cold, typical of the fall here. Nothing was amiss, we talked, we laughed, it felt like we were teenagers again. High School sweethearts. 

We settled on the couch with a bottle of wine, and the evening seemed to pass so quickly. Around 1:00 in the morning, both of us beyond tipsy, my husband began to ask me about a coach from the school. He was a close colleague but nothing more than that, My husband didn’t approve of that answer. 

He began to get louder, probing me endlessly, seeking for any other answer than what I gave. I screamed back a few times, exhausting that I had told him the truth. After being berated for close 15 minutes, I stood up and told him I was going to bed. We were both intoxicated and tired and needed to get some rest. As I walked away, he continued ranting. I wasn’t going to argue any longer. 

I settled in our room, he had finally quit his screaming, thinking back he was oddly quiet. I heard his heavy boots creak across the floor, I could see his feet just under the door. Finally he’s coming to bed I thought. 

The door burst open, I heard the rack of his shot gun, he was charging at me now. I screamed, scrambling to my feet, I darted past him. His eyes were black as night, that wasn’t my husband anymore. 

I managed to make it out of the front door and into the yard, we lived on quite a bit of land. I ran like I had never ran before, but he seemed to move with inhuman speed. I screamed even louder, hoping someone would come to my rescue, but they never did. 

He shot me. I fell, blood pouring from my back and stomach. I could only taste metallic in my mouth, like pennies. My breathing slowed, and all I could hear was him screaming nonsense about his suspicions. Another blast came to the back of my head. It was finished, I was finished. 

The black cleared from his eyes, he stood in horror at what he had done. He screamed and cried, the pain being too much to bear he turned the gun on himself, Kurt Cobain style. 

They found me and him the next morning, my daughter did. I was naked and he was nothing but a headless horseman.
