The rest of the trip blurred into a monotonous haze of dull landscapes and forgettable architecture. Besides the boredom I felt, Will’s enthusiasm, once a familiar backdrop to our lives, now grated on every fiber of my being. I could hardly look at him without feeling a surge of irritation. It wasn’t just his voice or the way he never stopped talking. It was everything about him—the way he strutted through crowds, a charmer at the center of attention, as if the entire world revolved around his smile. He wasn’t just annoying. He was suffocating.

Everywhere we went, he wielded his charm like a weapon, ensnaring another desperate local in his web. A laugh here, a wink there, and suddenly another conversation blossomed, another person in his thrall. I loathed it. The friendly gestures, the casual jokes, always twisted into something predatory, something crude. His eyes, always scanning, calculating, sizing up everyone around him like they were all just potential marks. Each glance, each flick of his tongue against his teeth, felt like an invasion.

I couldn’t stand it.

Between us he stopped cracking his jokes and filling the silence with stupid anecdotes. Something widened between us, with the words neither of us was willing to say. I couldn’t even bring myself to pretend anymore. The silence was deafening. He must have noticed, of course. He wasn’t stupid. But even when the joking stopped, the mask didn’t fall. Will was still Will—too busy charming everyone else to care that I was no longer amused, no longer interested.

By the time our flight home arrived, I was relieved to be leaving.

The only thing that had kept me sane during those days was her. Sable.

Her messages felt right—the one thing that gave me momentum. A cheeky text, arriving like clockwork, would send a jolt through my veins. I’d lie in bed, staring at the black rectangle on my bedside stand, waiting. Anticipating. The inevitable buzz. The vibration. The flicker of movement in the darkness. The rush of blood, the sharp thrill of reading her words.

We would talk. I’d click the pay link. The images would flow. My mind would race. And I would be left a twitching mess.

Without her, the world felt off. The streets stretched endlessly, buildings almost bending at odd angles, each blending into the next, indistinct and unnatural. Conversations faded into static, just lips moving without meaning. The air felt sickening, pressing in around me like invisible hands.

There was the only thing that mattered. Only one thing that felt real.

**Buzz.**

A jolt. A sharp, electric rush. My fingers twitched toward the phone.

**Buzz.**

Fluorescent lights. The hum of computers. Papers rustling.

I blink. I’m at my desk, back at work.

A dull headache pulses at the base of my skull. The artificial lights overhead burn too bright, reflecting off polished desks and glass partitions. The office smells of reheated coffee and old paper.

*“Sam, did you hear me?”*

A voice cuts through the fog. I turn, my movements sluggish, my mind struggling to catch up.

A desk is cluttered with case files. My tie feels too tight, a noose around my throat. The nameplate on my desk reads Samuel Grant, Associate. A familiar weight settles in my chest. 

Will stands across from me, expectant. His voice is just noise, muffled and distant, as if he’s speaking through water. I nod absently, hoping it’s the right response. He exhales sharply, shaking his head. Disgust? Frustration? I can’t make sense of his expression.

**Buzz.**

A message.

**“*****Lieverd*****.”**

**“Yes.”**

I pay, and the image she sends fills my very essence. Her fingers curl around the stem of a wine glass, nails painted deep crimson, pressing just hard enough to leave a mark. The rich liquid clings to the sides, swirling lazily, as if waiting. I swear I can smell it—dark, heady, intoxicating. There’s nothing explicit about it but still my breath quickens. My skin tingles, a rush of pleasure. 

I click the PayPal link again.

—

The city is empty tonight.

Not in the literal sense—people still move along the sidewalks, headlights carve through the dark, neon hums against wet pavement—but it all feels hollow. Distant. Like I’m walking through a painting, the brushstrokes unfinished, the colors smudged.

I move forward on autopilot, my footsteps lost beneath the murmur of life happening around me. Voices blur. Laughter rings sharp, too bright, too false. A couple passes by, hands entwined, their bodies leaning into each other in a way that makes my stomach twist.

I shove my hands into my coat pockets and keep walking.

The streetlights flicker overhead, and for a brief moment, my shadow stretches long against the pavement. 

A shape in my peripheral vision.

My breath catches.

*Sable*.

She’s across the street, poised beneath the glow of a shopfront. A glass of red wine in her hand. Dark dress clinging to every curve, her lips painted deep crimson. A vision of quiet power. A promise.

She tilts her head as if she knows I’m looking.

The air is suddenly thick, the scent of jasmine and rain-damp concrete clogging my lungs. A tone rushes through me like a pulse of pleasure.

And she’s gone.

Only strangers. A man checking his watch. A woman adjusting her coat. A bus rolling past, its brakes hissing.

The buzz in my pocket jolts me, a sudden spark to my system. I exhale sharply, pressing my hand against my chest, trying to steady the erratic beat beneath my ribs.

I pull out my phone.

**“Thinking of me,** ***Lieverd***\*\*?”\*\*

My fingers tighten around the device.

**“Always.”**

**Buzz.**

A courtroom. Dark wood panels. Rows of blank faces. The judge’s voice drones on—an endless monotone, stretching and folding over itself, like waves eroding a distant shore.

I’m standing, speaking. The words leave my mouth in measured, practised sentences, automatic. Am I saying the right things?

A bead of sweat slips down my spine. My pulse is slow, sluggish.

“Sam!”

Will, again.

I’m at my desk. A case file sits in front of me, untouched.

“What?” I mutter.

“I needed those case notes yesterday!” He looms over me, frustration radiating off him.

I slide the files across without looking up. “They’re here.” I haven’t touched them. I know it. He knows it.

Will snatches them, I expected anger but saw disappointment. “Fuck, Sam. I gotta do everything now.”

I should argue. I do feel a surge of anger. I should defend myself. But I don’t have the energy. I let it slide. Again.

Will slinks off. Silence settles in, thick and suffocating.

The only sound I truly hear is the blood rushing in my ears.

**Buzz.**

The city sprawls beyond my window, lights flickering like distant stars. The night presses in against the glass, cold.

I catch my reflection—hollow eyes, drawn features. My clothes don’t seem to fit me anymore. When did I last change shirts? My tie lies forgotten, my buttons mismatched lining my body.

On the bedside table, my phone sits motionless. 

I reach for it. Fingers hovering.

What am I doing?

**Buzz.**

The world sharpens.

A deep breath. The tension in my chest uncoils, my shoulders loosening, as if I’ve been holding something in for hours. Maybe I have.

My thumb hovers over the screen.

A small, involuntary smile as I read her words.

**“Ready,** ***Lieverd***\*\*?”\*\*

**“Always, love.”**

**“Your payments have slowed. Is something wrong?”**

**“Work has slowed down. I can’t bring myself to do it…”**

A pause. The dots bounce.

**“Do it for me,** ***Lieverd***\*\*.”\*\*

I look to her name in my contacts. 

**Mistress Sable.**

**“Yes, mistress.”**

—

I was let go. When? How? The days are all a blur, tangled and slipping through my fingers. Did I even pack? Did I say goodbye? The memory is fractured, distant. I recall vague flashes-Will’s voice, his pleading, his insistence that I stay and keep working. But none of it sticks. I recall an urge to escape… it was overpowering. The office, the files, the sterile lights. I was suffocating. I needed out.

As I left, I thought I saw *her*\-watching me from the lobby. Just a fleeting glimpse, her silhouette framed by the glass doors. Her in her midnight gown, voluptuous chest heaving with her breath as I approach. Her black hair along her sleek collarbone begging to be played with. But when I turned, she was gone.

**Buzz.**

I sit in my apartment, surrounded by chaos—documents scattered like confetti, my laptop blinking at me from the desk with an almost mocking persistence. The light from the screen feels like a spotlight, searing into my skull. It’s too bright—everything is too bright—and I can’t seem to focus on anything. The emails, the notices, all of them blurring into an unintelligible mess.

**Buzz.**

The vibration is sudden, sharp. I whip my phone off the desk, my hands shaking as I swipe it open. The notification stares back at me, a cold slap to my already frayed nerves.

It’s a notification from my bank.

*Insufficient funds.*

I stare at the message, uncomprehending. When did that happen? I had a nest egg, a comfortable cushion left from my European trip. It didn’t make sense.

I quickly check the accounts. My main account is in the negative. My savers hold only a small amount. But then my eyes drift to the list of transactions—each one pulls funds day after day, one after another, steadily draining the account.

All by me. But I don’t remember making them.

I close my eyes, as if that might clear my head.

When? How?

**Buzz.**

The sudden sound rips through me like a jolt of electricity. My mind freezes, my body locked in place, but I can’t ignore it. The phone buzzes again, more insistent now.

I look at the screen.

**“It’s time,** ***Lieverd***\*\*.”\*\*

I sit on the edge of my bed, phone in hand, the dim light from the screen casting an unnatural glow across my face. Trembling, I wait for a moment for her to continue, but nothing happens. My fingers hover over the keys.

**“Mistress, I need you.”**

My pulse quickens as I hit send. The anticipation coils tight in my chest, knotting painfully. I don’t even try to distract myself anymore. I’m fixated. Waiting. My entire world shrinks down to the tiny rectangle of the phone screen.

I stare at my message. The tiny, bouncing dots that are supposed to mean she’s typing don’t appear. Had she read it? Time crawls. I glance at the clock. Ten minutes. Then twenty. I know she’s busy, but… she always responds.

Maybe she’s tired. Maybe she’s dealing with something else. No, she wouldn’t be with someone else.

I text again:

**“Mistress, I’m begging you.”**

No response.

I set the phone down, sitting back on the bed, and let out a long, shaky breath. I want to throw up. My chest tightens.

I wait.

And wait.

Nothing.

**Buzz.**

I pick the phone up again.

**“I’m busy.”**

I read the words over and over, but they don’t make sense. She was ready for me now she isn’t? She’s always made time for me before. She’s always understood.

I send a quick reply:

**“But I need you now. This can’t wait.”**

My heart beats faster as I wait, staring at the screen.

**“You know the answer, Lieverd.”**

The coldness in her words cuts through the air, sharper than I expected. Yet, with the sense of rising panic, a loving embrace awaited me. I exhaled slowly, the tightness in my chest releasing as I pull up PayPal.

I send through the payment.

—

I woke again, lying on my bed, my mind stale with remnants of sleep. I felt disgusting. A cold shiver ran through me, like the final collapse of a crumbling foundation.

I opened my bank app once more, and there it was—everything gone. My finances, ruined. I had nothing left.

Sick to my stomach, I rushed to the bathroom, barely making it to the toilet before I threw up. The thought hit me like a freight train: I did this. I couldn’t remember when or for how long, but I spent it all. Every last cent.

The sensation of everything unraveling washed over me. I needed to talk to someone. I needed help.

I grabbed my phone, fingers trembling, and for the first time in what felt like forever, I reached out to someone else.

The phone rang. A beat of silence. Then, Will’s voice.

*“Sam?”*

I froze, the lump in my throat too large to swallow. Tears welled up before I could stop them. “Will… I need help…”

*“Fuck, Sam. It’s been months.”*

I let that slip by, the sense of time slipping away from me. “Can we meet? Please? Maybe at your place? I need to get out of here.”

There was a long pause, his breath deepening as he considered it.

*“Sam, you stopped talking to me. You ignored me at work, and then you ghosted me after you got fired. Why the hell would I meet you now?”*

“B-because you’re my friend…”

The words barely escaped, and I couldn’t stop the tears from falling. I sniffed them back, hoping I wouldn’t break. Then, I heard a sigh on the other end.

*“Okay, fine. I’ve got something in a few hours, but you can come over. We’ll talk. But you gotta leave after, okay?”*

I swallowed hard, grateful. “Okay. I’ll see you soon.”

*“Yeah.”*

The line clicked dead.

I sat there for a while, staring at the mess around me: the dirty apartment, the ruined bank account and finally my messages. I wanted to feel that warmth again. 

Eventually, I forced myself up and made my way out of the building, my head spinning with thoughts I couldn’t quite put together.

—

Eventually, I made it to Will’s apartment. I stood at the entrance, barely holding myself together in my disheveled clothes and long jacket. I must have looked terrible—like an I'll fitting skin suit on an alien. My hair unkempt, my face pale, and the weight of it all pressing down on me with each breath I took. I knocked on the door, probably a little too hard.

No answer.

I knocked again, harder this time, frustration building in my being.

Then I heard it. A sound—was it laughter? No, it couldn’t be. I thought I was imagining it. But then it stopped, just as quickly as it had started. A pit formed in my stomach, a sinking feeling like something was off. I raised my hand to knock again when Will suddenly opened the door, just enough to look through the crack.

He was flushed, panting, naked. Nothing but a towel.

My breath caught in my throat.

“Will. What the hell?” 

His gaze locked onto mine, and his eyes were dark with something I couldn’t place. He was angry—no, furious.

“I waited for you! You didn’t show up, so I moved on. You ghosted me again!”

My brain struggled to process his words. I opened my mouth, but no sound came out at first. The anger I felt-the betrayal-began to boil over. How dare he accuse me of ghosting him? After everything? I had shown up. I had come here, expecting to find my friend, not… this.

“What do you mean?! I came straight here!”

Will let the door swing open fully, taking in my appearance. I could see the judgment in his eyes, the disgust as he looked me over. The pity I had once seen in him, that faint trace of empathy, evaporated in an instant.

“I gave you *so* many chances, and you threw them all away.” His words were laced with venom.

I could feel the anger rising, my pulse hammering in my ears. “Like hell—” I began, but the words caught in my throat. 

*“Babe?”* A voice called from inside.

A voice I knew.

My stomach churned, my heart clenched.

*“Who’s that?”* she asked, her voice full of innocence.

Everything suddenly clicked into place. I saw what Will was. A snake, who wanted to see me suffer. I felt the floor drop out from under me, like I was falling through an endless void. I should have known. I should have seen it sooner. Will wasn’t my friend—he never had been. This whole time, he’d been playing me, stringing me along, feeding me scraps of affection while he moved on behind my back. To get to *her*.

I felt the anger, the hurt, surge inside me. I couldn’t keep it in anymore. I felt the urge to fight back. I shouldn’t have let him do this to me. I shouldn’t have let myself get this low.

The alien weight in my jacket tugged at me, its purpose suddenly clear. I reached for it, the cold metal a sharp contrast to the heat in my veins. My fingers closed around the handle, and I felt a sense of control, of power I hadn’t felt in so long. I wasn’t going to let him get away with this.

The words spilled out of my mouth, raw and vicious. “You *fucking* asshole.”

I fired the handgun. Once. Twice. Three times.

Will collapsed to the ground, blood pooling beneath him. Dead.

The screaming came next.

The woman emerged from the room, cradling Will’s bleeding body. Her eyes locked onto mine, wide with terror, blonde hair plastered to her face. Blonde.

It’s not Sable.

I froze, the grip on the gun—when had I even gotten it?—tightening in my hand. My mind spun, struggling to process what had just happened. Without thinking, I threw the weapon to the floor and stumbled backward, my pulse racing.

It *wasn’t* Sable.

Her sobs reverberated down the hallway as I turned and fled for the elevator, my heart pounding in my chest. My fingers fumbled with my phone, shaking as I typed out the message.

**“Mistress, I thought it was you.”**

The elevator creaked and groaned as it moved, agonizingly slow.

**“I killed him for you.”**

The doors seemed to take forever to open.

**“Sable. Please.”**

I could feel panic creeping into my bones, gnawing at my resolve. I had to reach her. I had to explain.

Without thinking, I threw caution to the wind. I selected her name from my contacts and pressed call.

*‘We’re sorry, the number you have dialled is disconnected.’*
