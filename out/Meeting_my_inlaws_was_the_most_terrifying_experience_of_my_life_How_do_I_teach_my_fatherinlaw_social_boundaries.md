I made it out of this alive, but not everyone did.

------------------

My father-in-law's a dick.

He has no physical or social boundaries. I have to shower after every meeting with him. [And his family acts as guardians against an army of were-lions, but he didn’t tell me until long after I was engaged to his daughter](https://redd.it/177pvpz).

“Do you need me to help you fight the were-lions?” I asked, my eyes darting back and forth between Lacey and her dad. 

“No, you suck at fighting them,” Frank answered. “Did you not see yourself getting that ass-kicking?”

“Dad!”

“What?” he asked, looking genuinely surprised. “I only said that because of how bad his ass-kicking was.”

“Dad, remember when we talked about boundaries?”

Frank sighed and rolled his eyes toward his overgrown brows. “Fine. Joseph, can you pretend that I didn’t draw attention to how badly you suck at fighting?” He glared at Lacey.

She crossed her arms. “That was better. On a relative scale, not an absolute one.”

Frank shrugged. “I’ll take what I can get from you.” Then he turned his gaze toward me and made his bushy white brows dance with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the bicuspids.

“So when are they coming to kill us?” I interjected, switching to a more pleasant thought.

“That’s the thing,” Lacey answered, her face pale. “We don’t know anything about-”

The door slammed against the wall and five enormous half-men, half-lion beings burst into the room. Each of them was significantly bigger than the one who had caused me so much pain and required a rescue from my fiancée. They glared at us with a dull expression that conveyed nothing but malice; these creatures would clearly fight past the point of certain death if it meant inflicting slightly more agony on an enemy they hated for no discernable reason.

“Oh, fiddlesticks,” I lamented as they surrounded us. 

“JOSEPH! Behind me!” Lacey screamed, lifting the gun.

“She’s got less than five bullets,” snarled the one directly before us. “It’s the only reason she hasn’t started shooting.”

I felt the chill as she froze. 

I knew that she could physically overpower one. But the rule of fighting more than two people at once is to outrun the fastest of them, and that old axiom didn’t really work when we were cornered in a room. 

“Lacey, Frank, they’re flanking us. One on our right, two on our left, two directly ahead. We can’t let them determine the layout of what’s going to happen next.”

“Stay back, Joe,” Frank grunted as he balled his hands into fists. “I’ve faced worse, but they know we’re going to-”

“Act sensible, which is why I have to do this,” I interrupted.

Then I charged the two in front of me.

They braced for the impact just as I dove into a tackle. My shoulders hit their knees, and I knew only pain. 

“JOE!” Frank screamed. “You fucking-”

A single gunshot interrupted him as I turned on the two were-lions, fear driving my heart faster than I thought it could go. I shot to my knees, pain radiating through me, as I turned to face the attackers. 

One lay dead in a pool of his own blood, dull eyes open wide. Lacey’s tungsten bullet had hit its mark. 

I turned to the other, lunging for its neck. I had no illusions of overpowering the beast; I knew I just needed to buy time for Lacey and Frank to finish off the others. I was certain that I could subdue the thing for at least a few seconds before it kicked my ass.

I was wrong. 

Have you ever punched a brick in hopes of teaching it a lesson? Probably not, because you’re not as dumb as me. The lion and the brick were equally open to the notion that I might actually be intimidating, and I failed to slow my opponent by even a fraction of a second. 

He turned and grabbed both of my arms, pain radiating through my body as he stood. Lifting my 191.3-pound body took him about as much effort as it would for me to heft a rag doll, and soon my feet couldn’t touch the ground. 

“Let him go!” Lacey screamed. 

We both looked back to see her standing over two unmoving were-lions, pointing the gun at my captor. A weary-looking Frank was standing up from where a third lay on the ground. 

“If you had a second bullet, you’d have used it by now,” the thing grunted. “You’re just unwilling to accept the fact that your boyfriend isn’t *uuuugnnnnnhhh*” 

He doubled over in agony from where Lacey’s thrown pistol connected with his penis and testicles. I tried to push away, but his grip was strong as ever. 

Lacey darted across the room before I could blink, grabbing the man by the hair, yanking his head up, and jamming her fingers against the base of his neck. He collapsed with all the elegance of loose stool and brought me down on my injured left side.

“Ow ow ow.”

Frank screeched to a halt next to us, gasping for air. “Everyone,” he panted, “alive?”

With difficulty, I rolled away from the dead were-lion. “I really hurt.”

“I can live with that,” wheezed Frank. “Lacey?”

I crawled, shakily, to my hands and knees.

“Lacey?” he asked again. His voice was much quieter.

A chill struck my gut as I looked up at my fiancée. 

She stood, unmoving, while staring at her extended arm. Just below her wrist, an ugly wound was marked by torn flesh and fresh blood.

“Oh shit,” I whispered. “Lacey – do you become one of them once you’re bitten?”

Frank glanced from Lacey down to me, then over to where the gun lay on the ground.
