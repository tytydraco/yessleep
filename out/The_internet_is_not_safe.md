I’ve been on the internet for as long as I can remember. It’s my escape from the monotony of life, a world where I can be anyone, say anything, and do whatever I want without worrying about the consequences. But I’ve learned the hard way that not everything online is as safe as it seems. For the sake of anonymity, let’s just say my name is Danny.

I’m 17, a bit of a shut-in, spending most of my time gaming, scrolling through forums, and arguing with random people on Discord. It’s what I do to pass the time, and if I’m being honest, it’s what keeps me sane in a world that doesn’t make much sense. My parents are hardly ever around—they work late, and when they are home, they’re usually too tired to care about what I’m up to. So, I’m left alone with my computer, my only companion.

One night, I got into a heated argument with a friend—or, well, someone I thought was a friend—on Discord. It was stupid, really, just a disagreement over some game, but it escalated quickly. The insults started flying, and before I knew it, he was threatening to dox me. He knew more about me than I was comfortable with, and that scared me. But more than that, it made me angry. I wanted revenge.

I spent hours scouring the internet, looking for something, anything, that I could use to get back at him. That’s when I stumbled across a GitHub repository that piqued my interest. The description was vague but intriguing: "Phxnt0m.ware - the ultimate information stealer. Gain access to everything on their machine, from files to webcam feeds. Undetectable. The perfect tool for… let’s just say, leveling the playing field."

The name alone gave me chills, but I was too blinded by my desire for revenge to think clearly. It was as if this thing had found me, knowing exactly what I wanted, what I needed. I hesitated for a moment, my cursor hovering over the download button. Windows immediately flagged it as a virus, but the repository page assured users it was a false positive, and I believed it. After all, what did I have to lose?

The download was quick, and when I opened the file, I was greeted by a simple, grey interface. At the top was an icon—a twisted face that I couldn’t quite place. It looked like some kind of demon or oni, with hollow eyes that seemed to stare right into my soul. Beneath it, in bold, blood-red letters, was the name “Phxnt0m.ware.”

A sense of dread washed over me, but I pushed it aside and started building the .exe file. It wasn’t hard—the program did most of the work for me. I just had to select the features I wanted: access to files, webcam control, keystroke logging… The list went on. It felt wrong, but I couldn’t stop myself. I was too far gone, consumed by anger and a need to make my so-called friend pay.

Once the .exe was ready, I sent it to him in a disguised file, under the pretense of it being a game mod. He took the bait and clicked on it without hesitation. I watched as the program executed, a smirk creeping onto my face. We ended up making up the next day—he apologized, and I did too, pretending everything was fine. But I kept the program running in the background, just in case.

That night, after my parents left for their usual late-night shift, I sat alone in my dark room, the only light coming from my computer screen. The house was eerily silent, and for the first time in a long time, I felt uneasy. My computer’s fan started to whir louder than usual, and then a Windows notification popped up. It was odd—just a simple message that said, “Hello.”

I clicked “OK,” thinking it was some kind of system glitch, but another message appeared immediately after: “Are you alone?” The title bar said it was from Windows Security, but something about it felt off. My heart started to race as more messages followed: “Is your door locked?” “Are your windows shut?”

The final message sent chills down my spine: “We are watching, Danny.” My name. They knew my name.

My hands shook as I opened Discord, thinking maybe my friend was messing with me. But deep down, I knew this wasn’t him. I was sweating, my mind racing with possibilities. I received a DM from an account I didn’t recognize. The username was “Sato & Deadlock,” and the profile picture was distorted, showing shadowy figures in a dark forest with glowing eyes.

The messages started flooding in, each one more terrifying than the last. They were speaking in sync, like they were one person—no, more like they were something else entirely. They kept saying my name, taunting me, sending pictures of my house, my bedroom window. I felt a wave of nausea wash over me as they sent images I didn’t even know existed—nudes I had taken in a moment of weakness, stored in what I thought was a secure folder.

“How did you get these?” I typed, my fingers trembling, having to retype every other word because of how badly I was shaking.

They responded with laughter, a deep, guttural sound that seemed to echo in my room. They demanded money, threatening to ruin my life if I didn’t comply. A cryptocurrency wallet address appeared in the chat, and they gave me a deadline.

I had no choice. I sent the money, everything I had saved up over the years. When the transaction was complete, I begged them to stop, to leave me alone. I blocked them, hoping that would be the end of it.

Exhausted, I collapsed at my desk and eventually fell asleep, my face resting on the keyboard. I woke up hours later, the sun barely beginning to rise, with drool pooling on my desk. My first thought was to get rid of the virus, to cleanse my computer of whatever nightmare I had unleashed. But when I tried to factory reset it, an error message popped up: “Nuh-uh. We’re always gonna be here.”

Panic set in. I started pulling cables, yanking the power cord from the wall, desperate to shut it down. But it was too late. My computer screen flashed, the oni icon from Phxnt0m.ware appearing again, this time laughing at me, a low, distorted sound that made my skin crawl.

And then, the messages returned.

“Did you really think it would be that easy?” Sato & Deadlock’s DM reappeared on my screen, their words filling me with dread. “We own you now, Danny. You’ll never be rid of us. We’re in everything—your phone, your router, your mind.”

I tried to delete the messages, to turn off my computer, but nothing worked. The fan grew louder, and the screen glowed brighter, as if the machine was alive, breathing, feeding off my fear.

Then, the screen went black, and for a moment, I thought it was over. But then, in the darkness, I saw them. Reflections of shadowy figures in my window, glowing eyes watching me from the trees outside my house.

I ran out of my room, my heart pounding in my chest. I grabbed my phone, but it was too late. The same messages were there, too. Pictures of me, of my house, of my parents at work. They had everything.

And then, the final message appeared, burned into the screen of every device I owned: “We are Phxnt0m.ware, and you are ours.”

I’m writing this now, not to warn you, but to confess. This is my punishment for what I’ve done. I don’t know how much longer I have before they come for me, but I can feel them getting closer. The shadows are moving, the whispers are getting louder, and the light is fading. If you’re reading this, don’t try to find me. Don’t look for Phxnt0m.ware. Some things are better left in the dark.

Because once you find it, it finds you.
