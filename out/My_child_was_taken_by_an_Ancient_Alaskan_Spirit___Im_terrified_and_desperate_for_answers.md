I’m shaking as I write this.

My hands are barely able to keep the phone steady.

I don’t even know if I’m making sense, but I have to share this. Im terrified, and I need to make sense of what happened before it consumes me completely.

A few days ago, my family and I went camping by a remote lake in the Alaskan Triangle. It was supposed to be a peaceful escape from our everyday chaos. My husband, Marc, and I were excited to spend some quality time with our 5-year-old son, Ben. Everything seemed perfect- at least until the unimaginable happened.

On the second day, an eerie cry began.

It started as a distant murmur, growing louder and more desperate with each passing minute. I thought it was just an animal or the wind playing tricks, but Ben seemed entranced by the sound. He wandered closer to the lake, his tiny face blank and mesmerized. Marc and I quickly went to bring him back, but it was as if Ben was in a trance.

That night, as we lay in our tent, the cries continued. They were haunting and filled with a deep sorrow that pierced the stillness of the night. But we also heard little footsteps. I looked around, Ben was missing. He wasn't in our tent anymore. Marc and I decided to investigate, crawling out of it, hoping that Ben is not doing anything dangerous out there. But what we found was beyond anything I could have imagined.

The lake was covered in a thick mist, and emerging from it was a figure - an otter. Its eyes glowed with an unnaturally light, and its mouth was twisted into a grotesque, sinister smile. The otter looked way too human. The sight was terrifying, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest.

Marc seemed drawn to the figure and like our son Ben yesterday, his eyes locked on it with an unsettling fascination. Just as I wanted to grab my husbands arm, so that he wouldn't get closer to the… thing, i heard a scream.

 It sounded like Ben. 

I turned to see him standing in the middle of the lake, his small body illuminated by the eerie light from the otter. The figure’s hand -  or paw -  reached out, and in a moment that felt like a lifetime, Ben was pulled into the mist. I felt my heart stop. I screamed, trying to reach him, but he was already being drawn into the water.

Marc, snapping out of it and now fully comprehending what he saw, ran towards Ben, desperation etched on his face. I tried to follow, but the mist grew thicker, slowly swallowing them both. I could hear Marc’s voice, filled with both terror and determination, calling out to Ben.  Despite my frantic pleas for him to come back, he moved  deeper into the mist, reaching for our son.

His gaze became vacant, and I could see the struggle in his eyes as he fought to resist the pull of the creature.

And then, they were gone. The mist closed in, but somehow I was able to fish Marc and Ben out of it blindly. The cries of the figure grew fainter as I stumbled back to the car, clutching Ben’s limp body in my arms and Marcs hand in mine. We fled from the campsite, the chilling cries fading into the distance, but the terror remained.

We drove directly to the next hospital, but Ben - our sweet child - was soon pronounced dead.

When we finally got home after a long time staying at the hospital, Marc was different. He’s here physically, but his spirit seems… lost. He stares blankly, unresponsive, with a hollow look in his eyes. It’s as if the thing took something essential from him, leaving behind a shell of the man he used to be.

I’ve spent night and day trying to find out what happened and have since learned about the Kushtaka from local lore - Tlingit stories speak of these half-human, half-otter spirits that lure people with deceptive cries and steal their souls. I never believed in such things until that night.

I’m sharing this because I need help. If anyone has experienced something similar or has any information about these spirits, please reach out.

I’m terrified, watching my husband become a stranger, and I’m desperate to understand what happened. If you have any advice or knowledge, please… I just want my family back.

Stay away from the Alaskan Triangle if you can. I wouldn’t wish this nightmare on anyone.

 Thank you for reading.
