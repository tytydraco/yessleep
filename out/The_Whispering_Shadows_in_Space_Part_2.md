[Roughly a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1f3ozdy/the_whispering_shadows_of_old_delhi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), before being dismissed from the Mission Control at Johnson Space Center - Houston, my life was more or less pretty mundane.

I wasn't there in a very important role, just running routine algorithms and calculations. I grew up watching space movies and always imagined myself to grow up to be an astronaut. This dream however remained unfilled because I wasn't exactly deemed space worthy.

I had almost loathed going to work since every day was the same and there wasn't any excitement left until,  the crew of the fateful Boeing Starliner started reporting problems from the ISS during its third orbital test flight.

Mission Control went nuts and all of us started working overtime and against it to get the crew back to earth safely. Every single day had been chaos since, but what was going to happen next could never be imagined in our wildest dreams.

For the first time since the situation began, the comms had suddenly gone down without a warning. We scrambled to re-establish contact but failed in every effort. After hours of trying, one of the cybersecurity experts was able to retrieve and decrypt audio logs from the crew's personal transponders that had a sync/overwrite threshold of 48hrs.

What we heard in one of those entries had us all ... for lack of a better word... stupefied.

Audio Log Entry: Sunita Williams - September 3, 2024

The recording begins with a soft static, the quiet hum of the ISS systems underscoring Sunita Williams' voice as she begins to speak. There’s a deliberate calm in her tone, but something unspoken lingers beneath the surface.

Sunita: "This is Commander Sunita Williams, recording at 0430 hours. We’re now three months into what was supposed to be an eight-day mission. The Starliner—our ride home—remains docked, plagued by technical problems. Thruster failures, helium leaks... Boeing and NASA have been working non-stop to fix them, but every time we think we’ve got it handled, something else goes wrong. We’ve had to postpone our return to Earth again."

She pauses, the silence heavy, as if she’s gathering her thoughts.

Sunita: "But that’s not what’s been bothering me. A few nights ago, Butch and I started hearing... something. At first, it was just a faint noise, easy to dismiss. Space is full of strange sounds—metal contracting, the hum of electronics, even the distant echoes of our own movements. But this... this was different. A deep, rhythmic pulse, almost like a sonar ping. It’s coming from inside the Starliner."

Her voice takes on a slight edge, the calm cracking ever so slightly.

Sunita: "We’ve checked the systems, scanned for anything that might explain it, but everything comes up clean. There’s no logical source for this sound. Mission Control has been listening in too; they can hear it, but they can’t explain it. The noise isn’t constant; it comes and goes, as if... as if it’s aware of us."

Another pause, this time longer, the static in the recording subtly growing.

Sunita: "Last night, I went into the Starliner alone. Butch was still asleep—I didn’t want to worry him. The sound was louder inside, more distinct. I moved through the cabin, trying to locate the source, but the closer I got, the more it seemed to shift, as if it was avoiding me. And then, for just a moment, I thought I heard... whispering."

Her breath hitches slightly, the memory clearly unsettling.

Sunita: "It wasn’t clear, more like a murmur, words I couldn’t make out. But it was there, threading through the pulse, like a voice from underwater. I called out, but there was no response—just that low, insistent rhythm. I wanted to believe it was in my head, just stress playing tricks, but it felt... real. Too real."

The recording captures the soft thud of something tapping against metal, distant yet distinct. Sunita’s voice returns, quieter now, almost a whisper.

Sunita: "I don’t know what to think anymore. The Starliner was supposed to take us home, but now it feels... wrong. Like something’s waiting in there. Something that doesn’t want us to leave. I’m not sure I’m ready to tell Butch yet. He’s been tense enough as it is, with everything going on. Maybe I’m just being paranoid, but... I can’t shake this feeling."

The silence that follows is thick, charged with unspoken fear. Finally, she takes a deep breath, trying to steady herself.

Sunita: "I’ll check in with Mission Control again in the morning, see if they’ve come up with anything. But for now... I think it’s best if we stay out of the Starliner. Just until we know more."
