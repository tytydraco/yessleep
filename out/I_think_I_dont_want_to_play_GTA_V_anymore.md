I was playing GTA V, as usual, in story mode (with mods), I loaded up my saved game, which was at 80%, but I didn’t feel like doing anything to get it to 100% just yet. I decided to play as Franklin, headed to the garage, and took out his custom gold-colored Karin Sultan RS Classic, with matching wheels and body. Sometimes, I purposely crash into an NPC and chase them when they try to escape, just to see where they go and what they do.

Today, something strange happened. I decided to follow an NPC, and he ended up in a dead-end alley. He got out of the car and started running, which was typical, but my blood ran cold when he pulled out a gun and shot themselves. All the NPC pedestrians around me just stared at Franklin. 

And then the screen flickered for a second. I thought it was a glitch with the mod, but something about the atmosphere in the game had changed. The pedestrians who witnessed the NPC's suicide didn’t scatter like they normally would when they hear a gun shot. They just stood there, frozen, their empty eyes staring, but there was something... off. They no longer seemed like mere background characters; something in the way they slowly turned their heads toward Franklin felt unsettling, as if they were aware of my presence behind the screen.

“This isn’t normal,” I muttered. I pressed the button to accelerate Franklin's car, but it wouldn’t move. The engine revved, but the car didn’t budge. I tried turning the wheels, but it was as if the vehicle was trapped by an invisible force.

The NPCs started walking toward the car. One of them, a woman in a blue dress, approached the windshield. She tapped gently on the glass with her knuckles, as if trying to get in. Her face was expressionless, but her eyes—those damn eyes—were staring directly at me through the screen, like she knew I was there.

I tried to get Franklin out of the car, pressing the button frantically. Nothing. The character stayed frozen in his seat, ignoring every command I gave. My hands started to sweat.

Suddenly, the screen went black, leaving me staring at my own reflection in the monitor. And then, in a barely audible whisper, the words "I see you" appeared in the bottom-right corner. My heart skipped a beat.

Out of nowhere, the image returned, but something was wrong. Franklin was no longer in the car. Instead, the camera was showing a strange angle, like I was seeing through the perspective of one of the pedestrians. The NPCs that had been staring at me before were now even closer to the screen, as if trying to break through it. The game’s graphics were falling apart, but erratically: some textures were warping, while others seemed far more realistic than the game should have been capable of rendering.

I tried to pause the game, but the menu wouldn’t show up. I attempted to quit the program, but my keyboard commands were unresponsive. A message appeared on the screen: *"This isn’t your game. It never was."*

Fear gripped me. This wasn’t a typical mod glitch. Something was taking control. I heard noises through my headphones—faint whispers, as though they were coming from all corners of the virtual world.

And then, I saw him. Franklin, my character, was standing in the center of the screen, but something about him was different. His gaze was empty, his movements robotic. He was walking toward the camera, but not through any part of the map I recognized. It was a void, a dark, empty space I had never seen in the game. And when Franklin reached the center of the screen, he stopped and stared at me, just like the NPCs had before.

The voice came again, this time clearer: *"You don’t control anything."*

Frozen in place, I watched as Franklin slowly raised a gun, pointing it directly at the camera—at me. And in that moment, I knew: this wasn’t just a game anymore. Something, some force, had taken over. I backed away from the keyboard just as the screen went black again.

A gunshot rang out through the speakers.

The screen lit up once more, but this time, it was on the main menu. Everything seemed normal... until I noticed my saved game: that 80% completion now read 100%. But I hadn’t done anything.

Before I could process what had happened, the game’s console command window opened on its own, lines of code I couldn’t understand typing themselves. A final message flashed across the top of the screen:

*"Thanks for letting me in."*

I shut the game off immediately and backed away from the computer, breathing heavily, trying to convince myself it was just a glitch, a damn bug. But as I stood up from my chair, I noticed something gleaming in the corner of my room: a small metallic shine.

It was a gun, identical to the one Franklin had used.
