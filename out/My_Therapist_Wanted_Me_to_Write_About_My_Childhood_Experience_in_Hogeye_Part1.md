So I’ve never done this before, but my therapist told me the best way to get past my extreme anxiety is to start journaling. I was thinking maybe she wanted me to write down the traumatic experiences I had while I was in the armed forces (it was only 4 years of service until I was medically discharged), but she said to start with my childhood, since it could help me “dig into the early roots of your anxiety” as she says. She also says that making these entries will help me with my memory issues.

I was expecting to remember my parents' divorce or maybe even the bullies I had to deal with as a kid.  But I’m not going to lie, I wasn’t expecting to remember the actual disturbing situations I dealt with as a kid. I’m still trying to wrap my head around it all.

Like, did I imagine these things, or did they really happen? Either way, I should write them down because I feel the more I write about them, the more I start to believe they actually happened.

**Entry 1 – The Esther House**

The first thing that comes to mind when trying to remember my childhood is that damn abandoned mobile home in the woods. Like, there was no reason for that place to still be there, but no one ever claimed it. 

Let's start from the beginning.

My family (my little brother and my mom) and I moved to Hogeye, Texas, when I was, I believe, six years old. Which, now to think about it, was almost 20 years ago. It’s a Tiny town right off of I-20. You could blink and you’d miss it if not for the rusted water tower with “Hogeye” spray-painted across the belly. Well, it only says “Hog” since the “Eye” part is so faded you can barely see it. We lived in a run-down little trailer park with a very generic name, Smith’s Trailer Park. At least I’ve always thought that it was generic. I mean, hell, even the cemetery’s name, which it was built around, has an even more generic name, Tough Cemetery. I still get the creeps from that cemetery. But I can’t complain, the trailer park was owned by my grandparents, and they helped us out a lot and even helped raise me and my brother.

Anyways, I digress. This event all happened when I was seven, six months after we settled in. My mom worked nights at the prison. My dad... well, after the divorce, he was pretty much non-existent. While my mom was at work and my little brother was being watched by my grandparents, I spent my time after school riding my bike and hanging out with the other trailer park kids, playing hide-and-seek near the edge of the woods, and talking about normal kid things: Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and other fandoms. A lot of them were a bit older than me. One of the many things they liked to do was tell scary stories to each other. I wasn’t the biggest fan of the stories, but I wanted them to think I was like them, so I stuck around and listened to them. The scariest one they liked to talk about was this urban legend that was spread around the trailer park about a murder trailer. Or, as everyone called it, “The Esther House.”

Everyone knew about it. It was tucked away, I’d say about a ten-minute walk into the woods, just past the overgrown tree line behind Lot 17, stood this rotting green single-wide, half-swallowed by vines and dirt. The windows were busted out. The front door hung crooked on one hinge like a mouth stuck mid-scream. You could smell the mildew before you ever saw the place. But it wasn’t the way it looked that made it infamous. It was what happened there.

Back in the late ’70s, a family lived there, which is how the house got its name; they were the Esthers. The father, Harland, was a quiet, stern-looking man who worked odd jobs and didn’t talk much. The mother, Lena, worked at the gas station just off what’s now called Old Kilgore Highway, and she was known to show up with bruises every now and then. Nobody said anything because folks in Hogeye didn’t like stirring up trouble. They had two kids: a girl named Macy and a boy named David. Macy is 12, and the boy is 6.

One night, the neighbors said they heard loud banging, like furniture being thrown, or a hammer hitting the floor. Then silence. Nobody checked. Just figured it was Harland being Harland. The next morning, Lena and the kids were found dead inside the trailer. It's rumored that it was from blunt force trauma, but there was no evidence of a weapon being used. It's said there was blood everywhere, ranging from the walls, the ceiling, and even in the kitchen sink. Macy was found lying in the bathtub, where she had tried to hide. David was found in the closet, and Lena? Well, she was found unrecognizable in the living room and kitchen area. But Harland? He was just gone. Nowhere to be found. His truck and Lena's sedan were still in the driveway. There were no signs of a struggle outside. No footprints leading into the woods. No forced entry. It was like he killed them, then vanished into the trees. There was a manhunt issued for Harland’s arrest, but after the Police searched for weeks, they found nothing. I mean, they used dogs, they even got some of the state troopers involved, but nobody was found. Not even a blood trail. Just a dead family in a trailer that started rotting from the inside out.

The thing that I think is weird and a lot of other people thought was weird was that there was no media coverage of it, and with it being in a small town, the truth got twisted, and the story got turned into an urban legend. The kids called it cursed. Haunted. Said if you walked into the woods at night, you could still hear the banging: three knocks, slow and heavy, like someone was nailing a coffin shut with a hammer. Some even say you can hear the screams of the children or even the screams of the mother. Some said he was still living under the floorboards, or that he had been taken by the ghosts of his kids. One kid said If you bring a toy inside and leave it in the hallway, it’ll be gone by morning. A girl from Lot 9 swore she saw a face in the back bedroom window once. It was pale and really tall, just standing there watching her until she ran. Nobody was near the woods after dark. Except for us. Now, of course, we dared each other to go. Until one day the dare was serious and some of us decided to go.

It was the two of us in that group of 6, me and this older kid named Derrick, the neighbor kid from Lot 8. He had this idea that if we brought something to leave behind, the ghosts would let us go. I brought my stuffed animal that looked like a great value version of Simba from The Lion King (Yes, I was one of those kids). He brought a can of Pepsi. Not sure why he grabbed a can of Pepsi, but I was too scared to question it. I was only doing it because I got tired of being picked on.

The more I think about it, the more vivid the memory becomes. I remember the light in the woods that day. Faded, like someone turned the sky to sepia. Everything was too quiet. No birds. No wind. Just our feet crunching leaves and the sound of our breathing. Now, if I were in that situation now I wouldn’t have gone because you know something's wrong when not even the animals or bugs are making any noise.

“Ummm, D-D-Derrick, where did th-th-the animals and bugs go? There’s no noise out here.” I asked Derrick.

Derrick was one of the kids I was closest to when I first moved there until I met my current best friend. He was the only one who was nice to me in that park, at least when I first got there. Even though he was a bit older than I, he would take me everywhere with him. He was sort of like a big brother to me. My brother at the time wasn’t old enough to roam the trailer park with me.

“Not sure. It is weird, though. Like they were making noises earlier, plus it's still daytime, so they aren’t sleeping. Maybe it's because the animals and bugs know this area is haunted. OOOOO” He explains as he tries to scare me.

“D-D-Derrick, stop that. I d-d-don’t like it when you try to scare me. I hope the noise comes back.” I whimpered as I hugged my Simba tighter.

“I know JD, but hey, at least you got Simba to protect you if there’s any ghosts out here. Now remember when we get there, it's gunna be really spooky. You remember the story about the place, right?” He asked me while grabbing my shoulder.

“Uh Huh. Do you think it's true?” I asked while I started to grip onto his shirt.

“Not sure, little buddy, but hey, look. There it is, I knew I had the directions right. Actually, now that I think about it, it’s a lot closer than they said it would be.” He utters as he points into the woods at what looks like a small abandoned single-wide trailer.

It looked worse than the stories made it seem, half-sunk into the dirt, one door hanging off a hinge, the windows busted out like the place had been screaming. I stopped walking. Derrick didn’t.

“Come on, dude. They won't stop calling you Skip if you keep backing out of things.”

“But I didn’t think the trailer would be here. But fine, I'll go. I really don’t like it when they call me that. I also really don’t like it out here, it's too quiet.” I whimpered as I slowly proceeded into the trailer right behind Derrick.

Now that I think about it. The closer we got to the place, the more unsettling the silence got. Like, we couldn’t even hear any wind. Just the crunching of the leaves under our feet. It was like the middle of April, so it was really strange for it to be this quiet. Once we got closer to the trailer, the more you could smell became stronger.

“Ughhh, what is that smell?” I asked as Derrick was entering the home.

“Not sure, man, but I smell it too. It reeks!” He explained as he took his first step into the trailer.  

I followed suit, and the smell of the place was way worse than we could imagine. It was so bad we had to cover our noses. It smelled like mold, wet dog, and two very distinct smells. One of them is the strong smell of metal, preferably copper. It was almost like I stuck a few pennies near my nose and took a huge whiff of them. The only way I can explain the other smell was something sickly sweet. Like a combination of rotten peaches or just fruit in general. The floor creaked like it would give out beneath us. Inside, the walls were covered in peeling wallpaper and something darker in patches. I always thought it was mold, but now I’m thinking back to it, it was definitely blood. But as a kid, I wasn’t really sure.

We walked down the narrow hallway, past an old kitchen full of cobwebs and a bathroom with no door. It was one of those trailers where the living room and kitchen were all one room at the front of the trailer, and then it went into what looked like a hallway towards two bedrooms. As we started to make our way to the first bedroom door. That’s when we heard it.

A knock.

Not a small knock either, this was a loud knock. Like almost a bang. Like in the story that’s told. I sounded like someone was nailing a coffin or wood. But that sound didn’t come from above us or even from inside. The loud knock came from underneath us. And I don’t mean underneath us, like just in general, I mean right underneath Derrick. I froze in place and squeezed my stuffed animal so tight I swear I could have broken it if it wasn’t just made of cloth. Derrick looked at me first and then looked down.

“You heard that too, right?” Derrick asked as he slowly started to move backwards.

“Mm hmm,” I mumbled as I nodded even though Derrick wasn’t looking at me.

Now at this point I’m glad I didn’t have to use the bathroom because I definitely would have pissed myself or even probably shit myself from just being in this situation. I was already wanting to head out, and I think Derrick was scared too, but he was trying hard to be the strong, brave type, that is, until we heard it again.

But this time there were three loud knocks. This time, right in front of us. Then a dragging sound. Like something was sliding underneath the floorboards, right beneath our feet. We didn’t even take one second to figure out what that was; we bolted out of there like the Roadrunner. I dropped my Simba somewhere in that hallway, and Derrick dropped his Pepsi onto the carpet. But we didn’t even try to look back. Not until we were halfway back to the trailer park.

And that’s when we saw it.

In the tree line, in the same direction as the trailer, there was a figure. Standing still. Watching us. Not moving. Not blinking. Just... there.

Derrick swore it was a man. I thought it looked more like a kid, probably around Derrick's age. We never agreed on what we saw, and we never talked about it again. Derrick moved two months later. I still wonder what happened to him today, because we never stayed in touch. Some say his parents got divorced, and his mom took him with her. Some say that he was taken to a psych ward because he couldn’t handle what he went through. Honestly, I don’t know what happened to him. I just know someone else moved into his house, and that’s a story for another time.

But since that memory came back, I still have dreams about that trailer. And sometimes, when it’s quiet, I swear I still hear those three knocks.

So, I’ll say this will be my first entry because that’s not even the creepiest thing to happen to me in that trailer park. Hell, now that I'm starting to remember my childhood, in that small town of Hogeye, Texas. But to be honest, I still wonder what would have happened if I had stayed there instead of going into the army.

Well, once I’m able to fully put my other memories into words, I’ll share what else happened to me.
