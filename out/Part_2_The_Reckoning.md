**Sequel to: The Invitation**

"Once spoken, a word is a seed. And sometimes, it grows into something you can't take away."

Years don’t always bring peace. They can cover wounds, sure, but they also trap rot beneath scar tissue. Nine years have passed since that night—the night of the wedding, the night of the woods, the night of the joke.

Nine years since I laughed into a darkness that wasn’t empty.

The bride has three children now, all with her same quiet eyes and shy smile. My cousin—he was there that night too—moved far up north, to the kind of place where the snow falls thick and the nights come early, as if distance could bury memory. But I stayed. I stayed in the same house, on the same land, where that thing began. And I remembered.

Every day.

People said it was nothing. A prank. A trick of light and drink. "Just the forest playing games," they said. “The kind of fear you catch when the fire burns low and the stories start to seep.” I repeated those lies until they sounded like gospel. I convinced myself it was nerves, shadows, the effects of too much liquor and too little sleep.

But the illusion cracked three years ago.

That’s when the fifth village fell ill.

It started the same each time—always to the west, always after a traveler passed through. A quiet settling over the houses. Birds stopped singing. The dogs whined and scratched at doors. And then the sickness bloomed, silent and sudden, like mold blooming beneath wallpaper: pale skin, dark veins, unending fever. No doctors could explain it. No prayers soothed it.

There was a pattern. A path. Like something retracing its own steps. And I was at its root.

The guilt didn’t just haunt me—it *hollowed* me. It stole my appetite, my rest, my voice. I stopped telling stories. Stopped showing up at festivals. I avoided mirrors because sometimes—just sometimes—I thought I saw something else looking back. At dusk, I’d stand outside my house, staring into the tree line, half-hoping to see the shape again. Half-hoping I never would.

Sometimes, I heard footsteps that didn’t belong. Whispers threading through leaves. Once, I found a perfect circle of ash on my doorstep, and no wind or rain could wash it away.

I was twenty-five when it happened. I'm thirty-four now. But I feel older than my father ever looked. Not because of time—but because guilt is a slow poison. It doesn’t kill you outright. It waits. It roots. And then it blooms inside you, filling every part with dread and rot.

So I did what cowards do too late—I tried to fix it.

I started with the elders. Not the mayor, not the council. The real elders. The ones who kept stories instead of led meetings. Those who remembered more than they wrote down. I asked questions. Paid with grain, oil, firewood—whatever I had. Most slammed their doors. Some crossed themselves and whispered prayers. A few wept.

Only one answered.

A blind man named Varun, whose hands were so twisted with age they looked like they’d grown around invisible branches. He lived in a shack built into the bones of an old watchtower, its stone walls covered in ivy and silence.

When I spoke the date—the night of the wedding—his mouth twisted like he’d bitten into iron.

*"Panvati,"* he rasped.

He spat on the floor, like even naming it brought sickness into the room.

“They don’t come from places,” he said. “They come from *wrongness*. From cracks in the order. From *moments*. A word you don’t mean—said where something’s listening.”

I asked him how to stop it. How to *undo* what had been done.

His milky eyes stared through me. “There’s no undoing,” he said. “But there’s a place where some things can be *silenced*. A shrine. Older than breath. Older than sorrow.”

He gave me directions with gestures more than words. South. Into the Ghats. Follow the broken spine of hills until the trees grow too thick for sun. Watch for a ring of stones—not carved, not placed, but *grown* into the hilltop like fossilized vertebrae.

I left the next morning.

I brought little—just food, water, a warm coat, and a silver bangle my mother gave me the year she died. I didn’t tell anyone I was leaving. What could I say? “I’m off to apologize to something made of shadow and silence”?

The road was hard. Paths turned to brambles, trails vanished in fog. I slept beside streams and under crumbling awnings of rock. In some villages, the people turned away when they saw me. As if they *knew*. As if something clung to me that they didn’t want touching their homes.

The closer I got, the quieter everything became. No birdsong. No insects. Even the wind moved differently. Slower. Heavier. Like it was pressing against something that didn’t want to be disturbed.

And then I found it.

Not a temple. Not even a structure. Just a ring of stones at the top of a forested rise, swallowed by moss and shadow. Yet the silence there had *weight*. Not the absence of sound—but the presence of *listening*. Like standing in the pause before a scream.

I dropped to my knees. Palms pressed to the cold ground.

“I withdraw that statement,” I whispered.

Nothing.

I tried again, louder. “I unsay what I said. I was wrong. I was foolish. I spoke in jest, and I beg forgiveness. Take it back. Take me instead.”

The wind died. The leaves stilled. The air thickened like fog.

And then the shadows split.

It didn’t *walk* into view. It *unwound*. Like a moment stretched too far. A shape vaguely animal—four legs, too long. Head low. No eyes. No mouth. Just *presence*. A wrongness in the air, like copper and burnt leaves.

And then it *spoke*.

Not aloud. The words pressed into my mind, raw and formless, like meaning without sound.

**You can’t undo what bore you.**

I dropped my forehead to the earth. “Then let it end with me.”

It approached. Slowly. The space around it shimmered like heat mirage. The scent of damp soil and old blood filled my lungs.

But it didn’t strike.

It didn’t feed.

It just… listened.

**It doesn’t end,** it said. **It waits. For another voice. Another laugh in the dark.**

And in that moment, I wept. Not from fear—but from understanding.

I hadn’t just *seen* it.

I’d *called* it.

It didn’t need a ritual. Didn’t need blood or sacrifice. Just a joke. Just a laugh. Just one careless, mocking word in the dark. And then others. Smirks. Jokes. Doubt. That’s what fed it. That’s what *keeps* feeding it.

It turned. Faded back into the trees. Gone.

But I knew then: it couldn’t be killed. It couldn’t be reasoned with. And it couldn’t be undone.

Because we had given it *permission*.

That’s why I tell the story now. To anyone who will listen. Children. Strangers. Drunk men in bars. Most laugh. A few grow uneasy. Every so often, someone goes pale and says, “You actually saw it?”

And I always say, “No. I *invited* it.”

Because that’s the truth.

And then I warn them:

Don’t joke into the dark. Don’t speak into silence expecting silence back.

Not because something *might* answer.

But because something *already has*.

**Epilogue: The Inheritance**

"Some inherit land. Others inherit names. My son… inherited a silence."

The coughs have worsened. Dry. Hollow. Like the body is rejecting breath itself. The doctors say stress, malnutrition, age. They have no name for the thing that lives in my bones. That gnaws at my memory.

I lie in bed now, frail and brittle. Every bone an ache. Every breath a cost.

But it’s not illness that’s killing me.

It’s *memory*.

My son stands beside me. Sixteen. Still growing into his shoulders. His hair falls the way his mother’s once did, thick and soft around his ears. His hands are strong, but they shake.

He’s heard things. Whispers behind doors. Fragments of stories spoken too low to carry. But I’ve never told him everything.

Until now.

“Come closer,” I rasp.

He does. No questions.

“I need you to hear something,” I say. “And I need you to *listen*—not just with your ears.”

He nods. Silent.

“I made a joke, once,” I say. “That’s how it started. Just a careless word on a careless night. After a wedding. We were walking through the woods, my cousin and I. I laughed into the dark.”

His face twists. Confusion. Curiosity. Fear.

“I didn’t believe the stories,” I say. “But something *heard* me.”

He flinches.

“It’s called a Panvati,” I whisper. “Not born of place. Born of *moment*. Born of *invitation*. It didn’t hunt us. I *called* it.”

I pause. My eyes drift to the window.

The sun is setting. Shadows lengthen across the wooden floor.

And then I see it.

Still. Watching. Standing between trees at the edge of the field.

Four legs. No eyes. No sound.

Waiting.

He follows my gaze.

I don’t know if he sees it.

Maybe it only shows itself to those who called it.

Tears blur my vision. I turn to him.

“I don’t want you to carry the guilt,” I say. “Just the *story*. You have to tell it. You have to *warn them*. Anyone who might laugh into the dark.”

He doesn’t speak. Just grips my hand tighter.

And then he nods.

Not in fear. In understanding.

My breath stutters.

The weight of all these years—of knowing I spoke something into the world that never left—presses down like wet earth.

“I’m sorry,” I whisper. “I didn’t know silence was listening.”

The room dims.

I close my eyes.

And in that final moment, I don't think of the Panvati.

I think of the night I laughed.

And I would carry that into the dark.

If you’re reading this—if you’ve *ever* been tempted to speak into the void, to mock what’s meant to be left alone—

Don’t.

Because it hears you.

And it remembers.
