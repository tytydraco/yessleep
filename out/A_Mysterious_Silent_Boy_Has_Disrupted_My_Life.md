My wife, Lynn, passed away last year in the most tragic way imaginable. I had nightmares for months, but eventually, I made peace with the silence that now filled our home. Every creak of the floorboards reminded me of her absence, but I adjusted to the quiet. Then, everything changed.

It started late one night. I was drifting off when the silence shattered. At first, I thought it was in my head—just a faint scratching, like nails on wood—but then it came again, louder this time, more desperate. Each scrape sent a shiver through me. I followed the sound to the front door. Slowly, I opened it and found a boy standing on my porch. He stared at me—his eyes dark and unreadable. Without a word, he ran into the night, vanishing before I could react.

A few nights later, I woke to a feeling I couldn’t place. Something wasn’t right. I blinked into the dark, my eyes adjusting to the outlines of the room. Then I saw him. The boy. Standing at the foot of my bed, watching me. My heart raced, frozen with fear. We locked eyes. His face was expressionless, almost hollow. It was like staring into an empty well. Before I could move, he bolted from the room.

Something inside me snapped. I threw off the covers, chasing him through the quiet streets. I caught up to him at an apartment building several blocks away, where I met his foster mother. She told me the boy’s name was Noah, and that he had been passed from family to family, always followed by the same label: behavioral issues.

As fate would have it, the very next day, Noah and his foster mother came to my office. I’m a child psychiatrist, and it seemed like more than coincidence. From the start, he refused to speak. His silence was suffocating, like the quiet in my home after Lynn's death. I tried to reach him, but he stared through me, unblinking.

Then, during one of our sessions, the silence finally broke. His eyes widened, and he screamed—high-pitched, frantic, as if he were being torn apart by something unseen. His words were jumbled, a language I didn’t recognize. His voice echoed in the small room, and as he screamed, his body collapsed, hitting the ground with a thud.

That night, my nightmares returned with a vengeance. I saw her—Lynn, my wife, my partner, my whole heart —her lifeless body in the tub, blood everywhere. I could barely function. Noah’s presence was pulling something dark from me, something I had long buried. But I couldn’t dwell on my own pain. There was something deeply wrong with this boy, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever was haunting him was connected to me.

This week, I tried something different during our session—a therapeutic exercise I called “The Mad Game.” We built a tower of blocks, and with each piece, we talked about what made us angry. I kept it light at first, mentioning minor frustrations. But as the tower grew, I pushed Noah to go deeper, to reveal what truly hurt him.

His voice dropped to a low murmur. His eyes locked onto mine, sharp and unsettling. “People who hurt other people make me mad,” he said, his voice eerily calm. A chill ran through me. I leaned in, my voice barely steady. “Can you give me an example, Noah?” His gaze never wavered as he replied, “You know what you did.”

The room went still. Time seemed to stretch out as his words hung in the air. My heart pounded in my chest. Before I could respond, Noah let out a scream—loud, piercing. It cut through me like a knife. Everything blurred. Suddenly, there was blood. On my hands, splattered across the room—walls, floors—everywhere. And then I saw her, Lynn, her lifeless eyes fixed on me. “You know what you did,” echoed in my mind.

I couldn’t understand. Was this real? Was it in my head?

Later that night, I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, trying to steady myself, to shake the image of Lynn from my mind. I stared into my reflection, pale and trembling, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t calm the storm inside me. I leaned closer to the mirror, searching for some proof that I was still myself. But when I blinked, she was there. Lynn. Her eyes empty, cold. Her mouth twisted into a sneer that sent a jolt of fear through me. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. Then, in the blink of an eye, she was gone.

It couldn’t have been real. It was just my mind, breaking under the weight of grief and exhaustion. Right? But this... this was different from before. More vivid. More real. It felt like she was reaching out from somewhere I couldn’t see, forcing me to remember something I had tried to forget.

Then I received news about Noah. He had somehow nearly drowned in his hospital bed, though there was no water nearby. His lungs had somehow filled with liquid. The nurses found him collapsed, his body blue and trembling, a cup of water spilled next to him. They called it a freak accident. Some suggested it was a suicide attempt, but it didn’t make sense. Nothing about it made sense.

They transferred Noah to long-term care, but I couldn’t let it go. I needed to talk to him again, to understand. When I found him, he was awake but hollow, his eyes empty. I sat by his bedside, my voice shaky. “Who hurt you, Noah? Who did this?”

Slowly, he turned his head toward me, his gaze sharp and cutting. He spoke with the same eerie calm. “You did.”

The room went silent. My breath caught in my throat. His words echoed in my mind, and the memories I had buried for so long began to surface. My wife’s death. The way her body floated in the tub, her eyes empty, her skin cold. The blood, the water, the overwhelming weight of it all. Had I found her like that—or…?

I told myself it was suicide. Everyone believed it. But now, Noah’s words gnawed at me, peeling back the layers of denial I had built around myself. The visions of her grew stronger, louder. She appeared in every corner, her once soft voice now a roar in my mind. “Liar,” she screamed. “Liar.”

The guilt consumed me, festering like a wound. Was it an accident? Or something darker? I don’t know anymore. But Noah... Noah knows. He’s tearing down the walls I’ve built, forcing me to confront what I’ve spent so long hiding. I’m terrified of what I’ll find.

I don’t understand. I can’t take much more of this.
