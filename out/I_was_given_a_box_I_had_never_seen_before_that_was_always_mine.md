When an agent of the federal government grants you an “opportunity” in a morally ambiguous tone, you can’t say no. Even if you have a million questions. 

After a year of doing paperwork for various unimportant endeavors, that same agent returned to my office. He gently placed a simple wooden box on my desk. There was an odd and very unique symbol on the top. I noticed a minor tremor in his hands. He spoke with a tone I did not know he was capable of: anxiety. 

“Lift the top with your eyes closed. This box belongs to you.”

It was quite strange to hear this as I have never owned a wooden box with that symbol. I would have remembered. I could only wonder what manner of nonsense encouraged this agent’s play. 

In my typical manner, I had many questions I had wanted to ask before obeying the agent’s instructions. That was the strangest part: I did have many questions. Yes, many questions. None escaped my throat. The same motions my throat makes before I vomit were all that happened. Internally, I was panicking. Was this some sudden onset of nerve damage? Was I mute now? Will I need a feeding tube? 

While my mind spiraled downwards, the box was open. I opened it without asking any of my many questions. Yes, many questions. All of my many questions evaporated upon opening the box. An unusual warmth sat on my mind like a wreath, and the panic was hardly a memory. My throat finally complied with my commands, speaking the words I wanted it to:

“Thank you for this gift. I was always meant to have this box.”

The agent nodded before leaving without a word. 

I closed the box. The latch clicked a second too late, like it was deciding. It was finally mine. Yes, many questions, but not a single one about who this box belonged to. It was me. 

The thought remained. The thought of equivalence with what I was told and what was true. The agent said the box belonged to me, and it does. But that symbol. It was not familiar. I would have remembered it. 

There was tension in my mind. The tension moved behind my eyes and dug in at the base of my skull. It needed release, lest my brainstem explode. 

\~\~\~\~

I’ve had this problem since childhood: if something is said with enough authority, my brain tries to make it true.

I built a career around it — history, archives, museums — anything where words pretend to be reality and everyone agrees to play along.

That’s how I ended up as the federally appointed curator of a museum that displays single objects with vague plaques.

It’s also how the same agent found me again.

\~\~\~\~

The tension in my skull needed release. So I sat at my computer, opened a blank document, and began typing — without deciding to.

AUTUMN 1893.

HISTORICAL RECORD 001.

In 1893, we discovered that standards do not merely describe the world, but that they instruct it.

The federal center status of our city was still in its infancy, and construction of the central parliamentary building was to begin within the next year. The first popular initiative had succeeded, an action of direct democracy. All of these factors contributed to the mass urbanization of our Confederation, inevitably leading to the need for rapid electrification. 

  
It was with this context that our first meeting was called. It was necessary to formalise telegraph protocols, tram timetables, and cross-border correspondence into interoperable standards. Near the scheduled end of the meeting, the Director of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) — more office than man, his authority already printed into every envelope in Europe — demanded the room’s eyes. The majority of the members held him in high regard, as within 60 years the postal union was widely believed to be more successful than the unions of the rest of Europe, overall a pride point for our administration. 

It was here the Director explained how he accomplished this task. From his satchel he produced a rubber stamp; from beneath the table, a nondescript wooden box. The room stared in quiet confusion. He then proclaimed the item as “the Little Future Stamp”, and attributed the success of the UPU to it. The wooden box was closed, and the man stamped it. He showed the resulting stamp to the room. 

Curiously, it did not make the symbol on the Little Future Stamp. Yet, we all agreed it was an address. An address that was not in any words or numbers. With the authority the Director had garnered over the last several years, he said “This box will be delivered to the merchant in our city who needs it most.” The room, myself included, believed him. 

Only later did the compilers of the Special Registry agree on what had occurred in that room: the stamp did not write language. It wrote a standard. An address that required no alphabet because the act of collective recognition completed it. The Director did not so much label the box as he issued a routing instruction to the world; one that reality itself accepted as valid.

He implied, without elaboration, that the stamp had been used before; that the Union’s “impossible efficiency” was not administrative genius, but compliance from the world itself.

He walked outside, myself and a few other members followed, dropped the box into a mailbox, and closed it. He reopened the mailbox, and the wooden box was gone. The demonstration was not alarming because it was impossible, but because it was replicable. 

The next day, I conducted a search for any merchants that received an unaccounted-for wooden box. The merchant was found. However, he could not recall receiving the box. He only said that he had “always had it,” and that this answer felt, to him, sufficient. 

The government’s response was therefore not to deny the event, but to domesticate it: to bring the phenomenon under civil procedure before it emerged under rumor. The Federal Commission for Communications and Standards (FCCS) was founded. The Commission discovered that equivalence itself was dangerous: a perfectly faithful translation produced a single, shared interpretation, and shared interpretation produced “Lock-In.”

The following is the most important article from the charter the FCCS wrote soon after the Little Future Stamp incident:

**Art. V: Publication Principle**  
All official publications shall be issued in multiple authorised languages. Where equivalence is unattainable, the Commission may preserve *parallel authorised formulations*.

*Registry Note:* Within four weeks of the meeting documented above, three municipal departments independently adopted identical filing templates of unknown origin. Two were withdrawn before publication. One circulated throughout.

*Compiler’s Closing Note:* The term “Lock-In” does not appear in the 1893 charter. It entered the Registry in 1895, after the first incident involving public signage. This record was re-circulated internally after the “Tram Map Event.” Cross-reference HISTORICAL RECORD 002.

The box on my desk made a soft, settling sound from inside, as if it approved.

This was the release. My skull felt lighter, my hands warmer. But I did not know anything about what I wrote above until I read it. Where did this knowledge come from?

I have never been a compiler. I do not know anything about these articles or this FCCS. What I do know is that symbol, on the box? It looks like an address. An address I cannot seem to type here. I can’t command my throat when I try to speak it. Yet I understand it perfectly.

What was even in the box?

My uncertainty was interrupted by my printer waking up on its own.

The tray clicked. The rollers turned. Paper fed through like a slow exhale.

I didn’t send a job. I didn’t even have the driver open.

The page emerged warm and blank. Except for a single sentence burned into the top margin in the same dull font I’d been typing in.

**THE TRAM CORRECTS ITSELF.**

Beneath it, in the lower corner, was a faint embossed mark that looked like an address without letters. The same shape as the symbol on my box.
