I sleep with my eyes open now. He is stealing the light supposed to reach my windows. I have placed cloth and nails to the windows like a cross to a demon. How long until I bare all that I have wrought. He waits outside the window, I’m not joking. 

He knows where I live. I think sometimes of the food my father has been leaving me at the doorstep and I wonder if it’s really him. He leaves me meals because I don’t leave anymore. The man who loved the outdoors has found a sanctuary in the very place he sought to escape. 

When Dad texted me, I realized right then he must be my father. He asked if I had gone up, I told him yes. He said I shouldn’t have. 

I told him, yes. 

I thought it had only been a few days since my last post but as I sit here it’s clear it’s been longer. Everytime I pass a corner of my home it falls into deeper disrepair. Time passes with every crossing of thresholds. Something leaving my perception ages, and when I turn to look, the hallway I came from is thrown into incredible shambles. 

The fisherman is here. 

The windowsill is pooled with water very often, sometimes I’m brave enough to open them during the day, and I spy little cut fish. 

Bottom to top. I live a nightmare of my creation. I think I’ll just call it here. I’ll just sit here, and sleep. Eat what they’ll buy me, or wait until the taxman kicks me out. I don’t think I’ll ever leave again. Signing off. 9/20/2024

Well, I left. Funny thing all that… dread. How funny it feels when you understand you’re already in the hallway of hell, and you gotta start walking. That corridor of future suffering scared the daylights out of me. 

Not so much anymore. I still hear him. But I think I have a little time to finish the story you’ve all been generously reading. Thank you. Thanks for reading about Clark and his friend who couldn’t forget him 10 years later.  

My Dad is the one who got me out of that house. When he came knocking in the morning I had been staring at the fisherman that whole night. Wondering if he would move while being watched. He hadn’t. 

But the moment I jumped peering through my room at the knock, I whipped my head back and the figure had indeed gone. I ran to my bedside table and grabbing my revolver, burst through my bedroom door. Sliding to the right and pressing myself to the wall, I looked down towards the front door. 

My father figure silhouetted through the drapes over the cross section window. I raised the gun, and I thought long and hard about who it was. About what I’d rather have, a dead dad, or a fate like Clarks. 

I wish I could say it was an easy choice but it wasn’t. I put the gun in my holster, I didn’t take it off anymore. I cracked the door, the daylight blinding my dark adapted eyes. 

“S-simon? Can you come out?” 

“No. Who- I mean. What are you doing here…Dad.” 

“Well you’ve holed yourself in here…” He gazed past me before continuing. 

“...In this bear cave. I came to check on my estranged child.” 

“Well he is alive.” I listened to the cadence of his words, and the dress of him. It seemed on the up and up. 

“Clearly not well though. Do we need to call \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.” Insert my now ex-girlfriends name I guess. 

“No. I don’t want her to be here right now.” 

“It was the cabin?” 

His response immediately put me on guard. How quickly he had jumped to that conclusion. Too quickly. It was the fisherman. I knew it. I knew he had changed again. On this pretty little suburban street he was trying to trick me. Kill him, kill him right there. Bottom to top. Just cut him up and gut him. Those were the thoughts that swarmed until I saw his eyes. 

Eyes that spoke paragraphs of solemness. Of a place and thing he’d much rather forget. That cabin and everything in it. But right then, he was willing to completely forgo his barriers for me. It was my father. Plain and simple. 

I opened the door,”Hurry in.” 

He took a tentative step. Probably trying to figure out if he was about to end up in a murder doc or something like that. 

“Is this a mid-twenty crisis?” 

“No.” I said curtly. 

“We all have em, the mid-life is popular because it’s easy to explain. But why would people get weird around the mid-twenties. Peak ability to perform in all aspects-” 

“Dad. You know what this is plain and simple.” I spread my arms out as if I was gesturing to the invisible machinations of an invisible man. 

He went to joke again. His favorite coping mechanism. He let the unsaid words die in his throat. Before restarting the sentence. 

“You seem to be worse off than I was when I went up there alone.” 

My arms dropped. I felt my face slacken and in the reflection of my shiny steel safe I spied my disheveled appearance. 

“You went? Again?” 

My father sat the small safe up off it’s side, then sat down on it. I fell into a heap on the floor ready to hear his response. 

“Son, I don’t think you got a lot from me. Most of it’s from your Mother. You did get one thing, and that’s a desire to know everything.” I let a short exhale of breath out before he continued. 

“The desire to not have anything hidden from you. To be the master of all information around you. The thought of something you don’t know would infect the very flesh under your skin until you have to peel at the scab to find it.” He looked around the mess that was once my home. 

“This is the bleeding from your picking. I wonder how close you are to finding your answer?”

“You went again.” I interrupted. His look struck me as odd. As if he’d just lost control. Like a person he thought he could set straight just went off the rails. He looked down, cupping his face. Before flicing his grey and black hair back, his clean shaven face taking on the look of years. 

“Yes. After that night, the man didn’t leave me. Not only had he threatened you. He was somehow privy to an unspoken word that only you could understand. I was of course rage filled. But…admittedly curious of what had happened. Fear gripped me when I saw your look from then on. You’d sing a tune, and after what you had told me you heard. I thought maybe, he knew something I didn’t.”

He swallowed. 

“I left up to the cabin early morning on a saturday. Telling your Mother it was some extra work back at the office. Driving up I immediately felt sick entering that parking lot. My heart was thudding so loud I wanted to pull a U-turn and forget the whole thing. But halfway up that mountain I knew. I knew…” 

“Knew what?” I said unable to stay silent. 

“He was up there.”

His eyes wandered past me to the door as if someone was there. I whipped my head, and when I looked back he looked at me with an expression of pure fright. 

“You’ve seen him since haven’t you?”

I stayed silent. 

“The fisherman.” He again continued. 

“Fuck Simon. What the fuck…you, you’re marked now kid.”

“Marked?” 

“That man in all my years since I went up to the cabin alone has never left me alone. He’s at office parties. He’s in shop windows. He’s in the woods. Why do you think I stopped hiking?” 

I looked down at my hands and did truly ask myself if I had gone insane. 

“When I went up there, night fell suddenly. I could’ve sworn it had only been a few hours but night fell all the same. He came to the cabin that night…he came and he was…I knew him. But something set my instincts on edge.” 

I knew where this story headed. 

“I told him I was going to the bathroom and ran. When I took more than 10 steps from that cabin, you’re mother screamed for me to stop. I took a glance and…and…”

He was shaking uncontrollably now. My father, the nerdy rock of my life was shaking like a leaf. 

“I couldn’t…all twisted….face crushed and spitting blood it was….It crawled and slid. I don’t- I can’t fully describe the thing that took the voice of one I loved. But after that…I couldn’t see her the same.”

The divorce became clear. 

“Dad…he took Clark.” My Dad looked at the wall. 

“I don’t think so son. I think that, Clark might’ve been taken. But not necessarily. whatevers up in that cabin. That’s different. 

“You’re wrong.” He shot me a look like he was a little offended. 

“Well. I hope you’re wrong.” He said simply. “Have you been eating the meals I’ve been leaving.”

“I risk a bite now and again, I’m too afraid he poisoned it, but at this point I’m a goner if he did.”

He softened a little. “Ha, you haven’t seen me dropping it off.”

“I have.” I grew tense and he sensed it. The understanding of what I implied became apparent to him. 

“Then you’ve been ignoring me because…”

“Yes. Let’s not.” 

He let his comforting arm fall by him as he moved to the kitchen. He began to make me some food. I wish I appreciated it more then. I knew for a fact it would probably be my last. I can’t let myself live like that. Even now I know that I had to do it all. All of it had to be done by me. All of it. 

“Do you know anything else about it Dad?”

“No- Dale knows a bit-” he stopped himself mid sentence. Throwing together a sandwich, a practiced meal for a divorced father. 

“Dad.”

“Son, you need to move out of this valley. The man won’t leave you, but I’m 90% sure he’s a figment. He follows me like a curse, but he’s never harmed me. That’s what you need to do. Leave and never turn back. Even if I begged you to come back. If I was sick and dying in this valley you cannot return. You must leave-” I put a hand on his shoulder. They were shaking as if he was about to start crying. 

“Who’s Dale.”

Dale was an old fishing buddy of my Dad’s. He was the one who taught him how to fly fish. What spots were worth a damn, and which ones weren’t. He was an outdoor mentor to my Father. 

So when my Dad arrived at the man’s little shack down by the river, in the middle of the night, he didn’t hesitate to let my father in. My Dad retold the story to Dale, the man listened quietly. Then without oddity, or even confusion he sighed. 

“Your marked.” Was all he said at first. My dad dragged out of him that he had his own experience at the cabin. That the man hadn’t stopped following him. However, he knew a real man lived across the river from him. A man who looked like the fisherman he saw in his nightmares. He dare not approach him. 

But on that night he talked to my father he asked, if he would help him kill the man. My Dad bluntly refused. He had a son, a wife, and most of all the capacity to kill a man was not in his nature. Especially one he could not prove the guilt of. 

Dale was disappointed to say the least, too afraid to rid himself of the nightmare himself. 

“Call him.” Was all I said. 

“I won’t kill a man, I just can’t.” 

“Then introduce me to a person who will. Dale and I could be rid of him.”

“He’s nearing 60 it won’t be so easy.”

“He just needs to guide me there.” 

“What if-”

“Then at least I’ll have peace.” 

That seemed to set him off,”Like hell you will. What do you think peace is? A quick death? Void? Heaven? Boy I know you don’t believe in that so you think you’re going to nothing. What of the taste of good food, and the view of a sunset that never gets old. God damnit, who taught you this shit, because it wasn’t me.”

I was taken aback by his rise in voice. He’d never yelled at me before. Never. I felt like a little kid again, I shrunk back. He wasn’t wrong, but neither was I. 

“I-I’m sorry. But I can’t just continue like this. Dale can help me, please dad.” 

“WELL…I guess I’m going too then.” He grimaced but picked up the phone. 

Hours later, Dale pulled into the driveway. What a character he was. A messy bush of a grey beard that wrapped around his face. Mustache shaved and a big bulbous nose that tickled the edges of his thin lips. Blue eyes that could stare a hole through you, bald head he hid with an old mariners baseball cap. 

He was a burly and short man, thicker than me, and seemingly tougher as well. His arms sprouted white hair and old scars that spoke stories of getting too friendly with a fire. An inch shorter than me, he waddled up to me with suspenders over his grey shirt. 

He reached out, and I took notice of his massive hands. 

I shook,”Hello sir.” 

“Ha, you and your Father are a curious pair.”

He seemed to assess me in near moments,”Ya, you’ll do.” 

He turned to the blue beat up truck and I was walking behind him. My Dad sighed and followed behind us. 

The drive was uncomfortable to say the least. Dale and I sat on the outside, being the largest, and my skinny father squeezed into the middle. I held the side so I didn’t squish my father, the awkward seating arrangement making me crack a small grin. 

I checked my bag to kill some time. This is the list of items I packed. 

-Gloves

-Watch

-Rope

-Hunting Knife

-MRE

-Firstarter

-Lighter fluid

-Headlamp

* compass

And as a little gift from Dale, I was given a monocular night vision goggle. I brought my kimber k6s as well, but Dale was not planning to get close until the deed was done. 

We talked in the truck as we left town, my Dad increasingly uncomfortable with the conversation. 

“He’s throwing fish guts out around 1 a.m. every night.” 

“How do you know that?”

Dale smiled,”I’ve been waiting for this day for a while. I’m too afraid of what will happen if I die. If I miss, he’s got guns. Who’s gonna help? If I hit, who’s gonna help get rid of him? Best case scenario, we’ll float some way down the river, hike up the side of the river. I can take a shot from about 400 yards with certainty.”

“Why not across the river?” I asked, then reasoned the stupidity of taking a shot from 1500 yards. 

“I’m not Chris Kyle kid.” He chuckled. “Plus at night, fuck me. That’s tougher than bear hide.” 

“How will we dispose of it? I brought lighter fluid and fire starter-”

“Good start, but I was thinking. He’s got some pigs over there. I say we chop off the head and hands. Burn and bleach it before scattering it in multiple burial points. Then feed the rest to his little friends.”

I began to get sick at the idea. He didn’t take his eyes off the road but seemed to sense the mood from me and my father. 

“I really just need you to help with the digging. I’ll do the rest, don't worry kid. I should’ve done this a long time ago…fear just gripped me like no other. I’ve seen some things. But that cabin…that man…it’s something wholly unearthly.” 

“What happened to you up there-”

“I will not say. Don’t ask me again.” And that was the end of that conversation. 

The path to his shack is down a long winding logging road. Thick with trees and saw dust from the old trips that used to run through there. Evergreen needles stabbed the sky, and our truck trailed the belly of a beast. 

When we finally made it down, it was sundown. Maybe my least favorite time those days. Dale dropped out of the drivers seat. An air of muted excitement about the old man. I could not share his sentiments quite yet. I was shaking, I couldn’t stop. My Dad put a hand to my shoulder.

“We don’t have to…”

“Yes we do. I’m not living 10 years like this. Besides, I owe Clark one more attempt.” He unclasped my shoulder and I moved to help Dale get his small little metal dinghy uncovered. My Dad watched then moved to help as we got caught on a stump. All three of us carried it past 100 feet of trees to the bank. Dale looked up, and there I saw the fisherman's house. 

A tall wooden building. Two maybe three stories high with a tin roof. A thin stovepipe shot out of the top, and all along the roofing hung fish bones and old lures. My eyes traced downwards to a cutting block, and his door that barely seemed such. More like a piece of driftwood he shoved on some hinges. It hung alone among a mostly bare mountain that I knew, climbed up to \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. I had seen him so long ago. I just hadn’t known it. Then my eyes traced over to his beat up old red truck. 

Then I knew…Clark was not on that mountain that day. The surge of anger bolstered my resolve and I turned to Dale. 

“When do we get going.”

He smiled revealing two missing teeth. 

“Not till 11am youngin. Give it some time. Time is the killer.” 

We sat inside Dale’s shack making preparations. I cleaned off my revolver. I took the chamber out, and cleaned all 6 cylinders. Making damned sure I wouldn’t have a malfunction. I cleaned off the monocular gifted to me. I sharpened my knife, and considered whether to holster it. 

Instead I put it in its sheath and snuck it into the inside of my boot. 

Dale was even more meticulous than I. The cleaning of his hunting rifle seemed almost a ritual for a knight going to war. He checked every crevice, making sure his tool would make the job easier. He had a special attached scope, and I reasoned, it probably had some kind of vision needed. 

My Dad looked down at the python I had given him. He knew how to shoot. He knew how to clean a gun. But I think he was busy contemplating. I ignored the ramifications by busying myself with task. 

My Father would not blind himself to what the future holds. In a way, I was sure he would be more prepared than any of us when it came time. 

Dale gifted us camouflage but I turned everything but the legs down. My black overcoat and dark bali-clava would be just fine. 

We moved towards our goal. My mind went to a weird place in the back of my skull. I trembled. My gun shaking in my hand. 

Dale stared at me, but I only stared across the water at the shack. Before I helped push the dinghy out and jumped in. Three misbegotten voyagers on an expedition. I slowly rowed as if the rush of the river weren’t enough to cover whatever noise I could make. 

My Dad joined me, as Dale take an unbalanced but cursory look through his scope. I rolled up my sleeve and checked my watch. 

-12:00am

I sighed rubbing my face before continuing the rowing. The black water churned, and the dark shape of shore became ever clearer. Until, Dale staring through his scope said,

“Land ho.” 

I stopped rowing instead feeling ahead for the bottom. I felt it touch, and we scooted the thing on land. My breathing had quickened, and my eyes instinctively looked for an exit. My Dad put a hand to my shoulder, I turned without seeing, but knew it was him. 

In the blackness I knew his expression from his voice.

“It’s too late now son. Let’s go.” 

I gulped. The weight of choice had made it’s mark later than expected. I hit myself in the head and grabbed my monocular from my side pocket. 

The toothless grin of Dale almost made me shriek. I jumped a little before he dropped his night vision goggles over his eyes. 

“Let’s do this shit ladies.” 

I wondered if he was ex-military, but Dad just shook his head as if he could read my mind. 

Hiking though the dark with a monocular of night vision is not recommended to anyone under the age of anything. I was tripping and catching myself over and over again. Trying to avoid twigs, and catch myself from tumbling into ruts. The moon had cloud coverage, and I knew a storm would be coming by 5am. 

I clicked and checked my watch. 

-12:40am

A little shock of panic rolled into my system but Dale tapped my chest first. Ahead I saw a small square glow. 

The window to the shack. Dale kneeled and I followed suit. My breathing quickened inside my mask. I dare not speak a word. 

Dale hefted the rifle to his shoulder, and flipping his night vision visor up, stared ahead at the house. He smiled again. 

“No guts yet. We’re good.” He pointed his two fingers over to a small bump and dip in the bank of the forest. I nodded and the three of us crept over. 

Dale immediately sat the rifle down, and laid in an awkward sniper position. I sat staring through my monocular. I clenched my teeth and kept my gun unholstered. I tried to steady my breathing, but nothing would come into focus. 

“Come now boy, I’ll make the shot, and we’ll be done with it. Alright?” Dale asserted. 

I nodded. 

Whispering he continued with a quip,”You’re breathing so damn hard, I thought the storm was coming early-”

Through the monocular of my night vision I saw Dale’s head explode into eviscera. I’d never seen anything like that. The shot rang out and I instinctively turned away. 

The gunman had gotten so close that the natural defense of the body was destroyed in an instant. I turned to my father who stood with his gun up, before I felt a syringe sink into my neck, and dreamless unconsciousness took a hold of me. 

Inky void took on a meaning wholly unknown to before that time. I floated endlessly, 1000 moments, or maybe just one. My mind clawed through the expanse of rushing purgatory. Until my fingers grasped consciousness. 

My tired eyes slowly fluttered open. I wished for a moment they hadn’t. It was a cave of some sort. Rough stone walls, candles thrown half-hazardly around the interior. My hands chained to either side of the chamber laying my chest bare. I tried to move but my muscles had been deadened. Stretched to excretion by my forced positioning. I saw my boots sprawled in front of me along with the rest of my clothes. 

My feet were drenched in a pool of water, I stood on a small outcropping, and looking down I didn’t see a bottom. 

My eyes frantically searched the interior and made purchase on a wooden roof, and a square hatch.

*A mine shaft?*

That was my first thought. 

My second thought. 

*Where’s Dad?*

I began to struggle against my bindings. The cold took a whole new meaning in a dank cave. My tendons cried out bloody murder at my forced stretch. I kicked against the water trying to exit but the chains held my arms firm. I stretched my feet towards the boot. Not like I could hold the knife, but having it with me was better than having it lie across from me. 

I stretched my legs out, trying not to slip and have my shoulders pop from their already waning sockets. 

I grunted and groaned, the metal cuffs chafing bloody edges into my skin. Until my toes touched the boot, I smiled then accidentally knocked the thing over. 

I recoiled at the pain of falling halfway into the water before using my legs to awkwardly crawl back up on the little island. 

My eyes locked with it again. I realized. Right then. Sacrifices were going to have to be made. I looked at my left hand. I took a few breaths. I tried to energize myself for the task. 

Pressing forward I leaned the left part of my body forward, my wrist threatening to snap. So I called the bluff. Pressing my leg out my toes grasped the boot edge and tugged it back, but not before I heard a sound like *Schluh-pop.* I bit my lip so hard blood seeped around my teeth. 

I breathed trying to steady myself and relax as the misplaced wrist raddled inside it’s cuffed prison. 

I slid the blade from in my boot. Gripping it with my toes I brought it onto my little island. Standing there for 20 minutes I realized there was nowhere else to go from there. So I waited. Shivering, unable to relax, I waited. 

Maybe three hours had passed when I heard the footsteps. Lumbering, lurching, awkward steps that got closer with every held breath. I steadied myself and knew…I was gonna die. My eyes began to well with tears. I couldn’t stop them. Shuddering the man came from around the corner. Long locks of black hair, band-tee and lanky step. I turned away. 

“Simon….long time no see.” it said. Sounded just like him. 

“S-SHUT THE FUCK UP. GET AWAY FROM ME.” 

“It’s Clark, did you forget about me already?”

He got close to my face, his stinking breath like tuna and charcoal. 

“Your friend was right where you were once.” The voice much more sickly. 

“He was here. In our little home. We stripped him bottom to top boy. Bottom to top. It asked for him so we did. It asks for all of the Cuhtz sons. Second ones that is.”

“I don’t understand.” I still averted my gaze.

“Better that way. It didn’t really want you is what you need to know. If you would’ve just stayed away from it’s ridge, we could’ve left you be. Yes we could’ve.” 

“It’s-It’s- what are you? Tell me if you’re human.”

“I’m much more. Many gifts. It made good on every promise.”

I heard footsteps from above and looked to the ceiling. My hopes rose, so did the call rising from my stomach. Until a small familiar hunting knife came to my throat. 

“Lose this mr. Lewisman.” 

That set a forgotten wave of panic through me.

“Where’s my father-”

“Shut it.” He said annoyed, as if the answer was so simple. I couldn’t find the strength to fight in that moment. All my limbs went loose. 

“See I’m no normal person Simon. None of us are. You’ll see. Yes your eyes will open when they’ve been covered in dirt and water. We’ll cut you bottom to top. Yes we will. But first we have to show you.”

Four other figures came into the room. I wish I could say they were familiar, or threatening. But they just looked like 4 normal citizens. Flannels, jeans. These were just normal people come to do the chores. That’s what was scariest of all. I screamed and protested, they went to the rolled up chains on the wall, and rolled the levers to give me some slack. 

I launched forward and the fisherman bent back laughing. With one hand he grabbed my hair and with the other he pummeled me until I struggled to get my barrings. I tried to find purchase on the little island, but as I fell to my neck in water I knew it was for nothing. All I could do was hold the knife to my foot and hope that it’s time would come. 

He held my head under the water. I struggled against his inhuman grip. My mind flashed with images of my future. Drowning chained inside this underwater basement. I couldn’t be free. There was no way to be free. I thought of how Dad didn’t deserve this. How none of us did. Then a worst thought appeared. 

Could this man even be killed? When I stabbed the shapeshifter, had he died? Then I thought it didn’t matter. That I’d give it a try anyways. What else was there to do. 

Then my vision went cloudy and underneath the dark water I was dying. My body took over all thoughts or memories. It had one purpose and that was to survive. My body bucked awkwardly back and forth. Instinctual thrashing brought on by self preservation. Water snaked its way through my nose and into my steadily weakening lungs. I swallowed a large mouthful of the black water. 

Somehow through it all. My feet would not let the knife go. Until, I was brought back up, spitting out the water, as one of the bystanders came and assisted me with the ejection. I greedily sucked in the air of the space around me. Until I heaved in exhausted motions. 

“No-No please, I’ll forget it all. I’ll leave, me and my Father will leave-”

“Simon. Stop. This is pathetic. This isn’t the same man who tried to kill me up on \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. This is the child I saw from the forest’s edge. Clark had a talent, and he could hear us. Almost took his teacher by accident. But he came. Yes, Clark came and sealed his own fate. Anyways Simon. We’re going to drown you. Now you can either make it easy or we can play the resuscitation game for the next few months until you’re ready to get cut up. That’s it. There’s no bargaining. You know it better than anyone. You can’t bargain with what’s done. Clarks gone. Dale’s gone. You’re already gone. You might as well be a memory right now. So just stop. Just let this happen.”

I couldn’t even lift a word in reply. They let the chains slacken enough for me to kneel on the rock. My eyes lazily drifted from place to place. I let myself fall again. They came to my side. I didn’t let myself move. They slackened the chains some more in order to pull me out of the pool. That’s when I thrust the knife into the first one. A big spout of red liquid covered me and the ceiling. The other one dove on top of me, and with a grunt of ultimate exertion I stabbed the blade into his head, breaking it off inside. 

He rolled around the floor convulsing. The fisherman was upon me, and I thrust again and again the broken blade into his side. He groaned pulling my own gun from his holster, I grabbed it and we fought. He pulled one chain taught, and it was my left hand. He was pulling the gun up. But my dislocated hand already shattered I allowed it to slip through breaking the thumb as well. Knocking the gun from him I reached it with my other hand. I whipped it up and in a white flash like my mind had been wiped. I held my head but fired anyways so he wouldn’t think of attacking. He was gone when it all came back to me.  

“c-c….COME BACK YOU FUCK.” I lurched forward forgetting I was still chained. I pointed towards the chain and fired. The sound in a room that small made my ears bleed. But at the moment I couldn’t pay it any mind.”

I passed through the tunnel still dizzy and half unconscious. The tunnels turned awkwardly. I ended up in rooms with piles of unknown refuse. Cleaned and bleached bones placed into forms I didn’t guess the purpose of. Instead I just continued. He was gone. Truly gone from wherever I was. I fell shaking, and my stomach purged itself on the cave floor. 

“DAD! DAD!....where…” I weakened, but pointed the gun around me anyways. Afraid the fisherman would be upon me. 

I knew I had to get help. Moving forward the cave sloped down and down. So I followed. Stumbling down the increasingly steep decline.Until, until. I heard the sounds of the woods. I fell through as the tunnel declined into a drop. In a shivering heap, my hand felt a coat. A camouflage coat. I yanked it and covered myself, then I felt the bag. Grabbing the headlamp I clicked it on. Seeing my phone, I thought about how I should call someone. Anyone. But what would I tell them? Instead I wandered forward, until I found a road, then I was moving up. Hoping I’d be picked up by someone anyone before I froze to death out in that fall night. 

A man did come. He helped me back to my house. That’s where I’m at now. In a cold paranoid mess.

I still see the fisherman. I’m glad I haven’t slept because I’m confident, the nightmares are probably worse. I know for a fact they’re worse. But I don’t think the Fisherman has realized.

I know where that cave was. The more I thought about it the more clear it became. 

The Pioneers cabin. That sound of the floor “giving way” was not some fucking old wood. It was a hollowed out portion that led down into that place. I’m going to burn the cabin down. I’ll make sure to leave the hatch open, I’ll drop some kindling down there to create a smoke trap. 

Then I’ll shoot them as they walk out. To be honest, this feels like more of an excuse to go die with all of this. 

I don’t want to be a loose thread, I’d rather be tied up with the rest of the knot. To Stacy, you knew when to get out. I’ll text you the rest of the heartfelt stuff before my little martyrdom. 

To all of you. No, I don’t know where Dad is. But I’m confident in my thinking that he’s also gone. Maybe I’ll go looking one more time. 

I wish I could say that I’ve done right by Clark. But the more I think about it, the more I’m confident this was for me. I wanted to put something that made me utterly depressed to rest permanently. 

Where as I’m sure Mr. Cuhtz, would’ve wanted me to live a life he wasn’t able to. How absolutely foolish of me to squander an opportunity like that. 

Sometimes, there’s no way to fix something. You’ve just got to let something be broken and move on. 

I tried to fix it. That’s my sin. 

I won’t be posting again. 

Bye guys. Thanks for…hearing me lay it all bare.
