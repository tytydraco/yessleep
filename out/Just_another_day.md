I'm stuck in this stupid retail job, living by on minimum wage, I'm the cashier at this huge supermarket chain but I can't be bothered to remember the name right now, all you need to know it's that I got to deal with my fare share of angry customers, idiots and Karens on my time here.

It was just another day at work, I was scaning items like usually then a familiar face dropped by, Ms. Audrey, this sweet old lady, she allways was kind to me and even left me "more money on accident" on some occasions so I allways made sure to go through the hassle of scaning her cupons and giving her as much discount as I could, well this time was like no other, she came to buy her usual two cartons of milk, her bananas and bread with that extra pack of cigarettes, nothing out of the ordinary, she gave me 40 dollars and I gave her 12 dollars in change. Then came Tom, the town's only mechanic, still covered in oil stains from his job, apparently came for his afternoon beers and cigarettes, gave me 30, I gave him 5 back, after that came this little girl wanting to buy a pack of snacks but she was 10 cents short so I said it was alright and I would cover for her, so I let her go. Then came Jimmy and Teresa, who just had their second baby and were frankly dying in front of me from exhaustion, they were doing their weekly shoping spree so I rushed them so that they didnt have to spend much time there, it came out to 45 dollars and 86 cents, they gave me exactly 46 dollars so I gave them 14 cents in change but as I was handing them the money, their baby bit me so hard on my arm that it left a mark even through the long sleeved uniform I was wearing, they apologized profusely and I just shrugged and said "It happens" as I wondered how babies could be that strong, and so after saying goodbye the day went on.

After some people there was Ms. Audrey with her usual two cartons of milk, her bananas and bread and her pack of cigarettes, she gave me a 40 so I gave her 12 dollars in return, then I thought to myself "Wait a second." "Why would she need 4 cartons of milk, wasn't she here like 10 minutes ago?" 
So then I started to pay more attention.. Out came Tom with his beers and cigarettes, gave me 30 so I gave him 5 back, then came the little girl with 10 cents missing, Jimmy and Teresa, again with the same look and same baby crying with the same shopping spree, came out to exactly 45 dollars and 86 cents and they gave me 46 so I thought I was starting to lose it, maybe it was just my brain playing a prank on me right?

Then I started noticing, they were allways the same customers, they bought the same things with  the same money and I gave them the same change, saying the same things, I thought I was going crazy, I started to look at them leaving thinking they were pulling a prank on me "Is it my birthday or something? Maybe they are leaving and entering again to mess with me" but no. I saw them go up to their cars and drive again, but they allways ended up on my line again.. I started looking at the line itself but I couldn't make out the faces past the 3 customers in the front of the line and it seemed to stretch into an isle I couldn't see from there.

Then it got to me. "How much time has it passed since I started my shift?" "Has it been a few hours?" "Days?" "Weeks, months?" "Years?!" "Have I been doing this for decades and only now noticed?" "How am I not tired after working this long" "Is time even passing?" "Was I desperatly trying to towards the end of a line I was nowhere near finishing?" "Was it all meaningless?"

I started thinking "What if I just don't scan anything?" "Maybe that will change something?" But I had this strange gut feeling, that something really really bad was gonna happen if I did, so I just kept on scaning, and getting money and handing over the same change, untill I couldn't take it anymore..

I needed to know when it was going to end

I needed to end it

I needed...

So when it came to Tom again, I grabbed the six pack he was about to but and swung it at his head and surprisingly or not even surprisingly, he didnt fall over and die. No. His face turned into a dark circle like a black whole that could swallow you whole, my hand stung like hell so when I checked it it was covered in blood from where glass had shattered and cut it, then after a few short seconds that felt like hours of this "thing" staring at me, it started shreaking a high pitched screamed that could pierce through anyone's ears, then before long all the other customer's faces contorted into black deep voids too and started shreaking themselves, so much so that it was too much handle so I grabbed the counter and went to slam my head against it as a last ditch effort to see if I would wake up from a nightmare, and it worked?

I suddenly woke up on my bed, my ears were buzzing but I was there. I was relieved it was all a nightmare and I was finally home, so I went to the bathroom like usual and looked in the mirror only to notice I had my uniform on when I saw that bright white nametag with my name on it, weird, but when I went to wash my hands I saw some scars I had never seen before in my life, so I started to panick and said to myself "You're just paranoid is all right", so you can alrwady guess the horror on my face when I went to pull up my sleeve and saw... theeth marks.

What happened to me? Was this real? Am I even real?
