It was around 2am on a Thursday, when I must have dozed off on the subway, after a double shift at work.  


I had done it a few times before, always waking up to the bright lights of the subway car just a few stops too far, only to have to hop off and wait for a train going back in the other direction.  


But this time, I woke up to...  


...Darkness.  


*What the? Where am I?* I thought to myself, before inspecting my surroundings.  


And as my eyes adjusted, I realized that I was still on the train car, its lights turned off, parked at the end of the line.  


*Fuck!*  


I hopped out of my seat and ran to the doors, but they were all locked.  


So I started pounding on them and screaming, "Help! Help!"  


And after a minute of silence...  


...I saw a bouncing light approaching.  


To my relief, it was a train worker, wearing a yellow vest and carrying a flashlight, as he walked along the platform outside.  


I kept yelling louder and louder, until he must have finally noticed me, shining his flashlight through the window and directly into my face.  


"Help! Please!" I called out, as he reached into his pocket, removed a set of keys, and opened the doors.  


"Thank you!" I cried out, so happy to be rescued that I nearly gave him a great big hug.  


"Got yourself lost, did you?" The train worker asked, as he finished relocking the doors and turned back to me.  


He was a tall, older man, with a heavy build and a weathered face.  


"Yeah, I must have fallen asleep." I replied, before surveying my surroundings...  


...Sure enough, I was at the end of the line after all. All around us, I saw countless darkened trains lined up along different tracks, and not a soul in sight.  


"Wow, I've never seen the end of the line before." I said, distracted by the sight.  


"Not many have. No reason to really." He replied.  


"Fair point. So... what's the best way to get out of here?"  


"Oh , don't worry, I'll escort you out. Wouldn't want you getting lost twice in one night." He chuckled.  


"Thank you. I really appreciate it."  


"Right this way." The train worker said, as he guided me down the platform and into an adjacent building that presumably led to the street.  


But when we got inside, it started to feel as though he was leading me further into the structure.  


"Um, isn't that the way out?" I asked nervously, pointing to a hallway with a neon red exit sign.  


"Last I checked, you were the one who got lost. Trust me." He reassured me.  


A minute or so later, when we still hadn't left the building, I stopped and asked, "Seriously. Where are you taking me?"   


"To the lost and found." He said, his face betraying no emotion.  


"Lost and found?"   


"Trust me. You'll see."  


In that moment, I knew something was off, and, looking back at it, I should have made a run for it right then and there...  


...But for some reason, I wanted to know what he meant, and decided to keep following him.  


And when we arrived at our destination, I finally understood what he meant by "lost and found."  


There, at the end of the hallway, was a large cage, containing about ten poor souls, each of which looking sickly, emaciated, and exhausted.  


"This is the lost and found." The train worker said, before opening the door and gesturing for me to enter.  


A wave of panic washed over me, and I tried to run away...  


...But he immediately caught my shoulder, dragged me back over, and tossed me into the cage...  


SLAM.  


...Before slamming its door and walking away.  


I looked around at the others, to find them simply sitting there in silence, staring at me.  


Only one of them had the energy to greet me. "Welcome to the end."  


He was a thin, bald man, wearing a suit that must have been new when he got here, but was now tattered.  


"The end of what?" I asked.  


"Of the train tracks. And, well... everything else, I suppose." He explained.  


"What in the world goes on here?" I asked, still shaking in fear.  


"All we know is that every day or two, he brings someone to the cage, and they pick one of us to take away. What happens after that, is anyone's guess... because no one's ever come back."  


"Wait, what?"  


"Oh, and I'm Phil by the way."  


"Ryan."  


"Nice to meet you, Ryan. Sorry it had to be under these circumstances."  


I spent the rest of the night lying silently in the cage, curled up in its far corner in fetal position, until I eventually passed out from exhaustion.  


Sure enough, when I woke up the next day, the train worker had returned with a stranger, just as Phil had warned.  


"Pick one." Our captor said to the nondescript man, who turned to the cage, and took a good look at every single one of its prisoners...  


...Before taking a moment to decide.  


*Please not me. Please not me.* I thought to myself, as I tried to lessen my posture, and did my best to hide away in the back of the cage.  


And then, the stranger made his decision...  


"I'll take that one."  


...Pointing to someone in the front.  


*Phew.* I thought to myself, before feeling sorry for the poor sucker.  


The train worker then opened the door to the cage, pulled the unlucky prisoner out, locked the door again, and carried the chosen man off down the hallway.  


My strategy of hiding myself away in the back of the cage, and thus avoiding getting picked, had worked.  


So I stuck to that plan, every couple days or so, when the train worker returned with a new stranger.  


But eventually, the number of prisoners began to dwindle, and one night, one of the men that the train worker brought to the cage...  


...Chose me.  


*At least I'll finally know where they've been taking them.* I thought to myself, before the train worker grabbed me by the collar, and dragged me down the hallway with the man.  


A little while later, we arrived at a small room, which at first, appeared to be covered in paint...  


...But I quickly realized that it wasn't paint at all, but instead a collage of splattered blood, caked on to its once white walls.  


The room was otherwise quite sparse, containing only a table at its center...  


...And what appeared to be a rack full of weapons in one corner.  


*Fuck. This is the end.*  


"Now what?" The stranger asked the train worker, as he gave me a strange look.  


"You kill him. That's what." My captor replied.  


"But I've never done this before." The man said, nervously.  


"Here," The train worker said, before grabbing an ax from the rack and handing it to him. "Try this. It's a favorite."  


The stranger took the ax in both of his hands, then looked back at me.  


He was a short, rather unimposing man, with glasses and a bald spot.  


Had he not already volunteered it was his first time, I would have guessed it anyway, as I could see his teeth chattering, and his hands shaking.  


"Here let me get him for you." The train worker said, noticing the stranger's hesitation. He then walked over, picked me up, and threw my torso down onto the table, holding me down, as I flailed my arms, attempting to break free. "Well go on. Do it!"  


"Uh... I don't know if I can." The man replied.  


"Well just start with one body part then. It'll warm you up. You'll be surprised."  


The stranger hesitated for a moment, before taking a step back, then running over, swinging the ax high above his head, and bringing it down on my arm... hacking it clean off.  


"AAARGHHHH!"  


I started screaming and wailing, as the train work nodded in approval. "Great job. Now finish him off!"  


But when he turned back, the stranger was just standing there with wide eyes, in disbelief of what he had just done, ax dangling from his hands. "I... I... I... can't do it."  


"Of course you can!" The train worker encouraged, a hint of frustration in his voice, as I nearly passed out on the table, blood pouring out of my amputated arm.  


"I'm sorry I can't." The stranger replied, dropping the ax to the floor.  


"What do you mean you can't? You paid for this. He's yours. Do it!"  


"No, just give me my money back, I don't want to do it anymore."  


"But he's no good to me now! You cut his arm off. He's used goods! No one's gonna pick him now." The train worker screamed.  


"I don't know." The man whimpered, still torn about what to do next.  


"Well make a decision, he's bleeding out all over the table!"  


"I'm sorry, I can't! Keep the money!" The stranger finally said, before letting himself out of the room and running off down the hallway.  


"Motherfucker." The train worker said to himself, before looking down at me.  


But rather than kill me, he instead removed a flamethrower from the rack and torched my arm, cauterizing the wound and knocking me out in the process.  


I woke up the next day in the back of the cage with gauze wrapped around what was left of my arm, in the most extreme pain I'd ever felt, save for the pain that I'd felt the day before.  


"Take these." The train worker said, tossing me a bag of painkillers through the bars of the cage.  


And then it was...  


...Back to business as usual, as he continued to bring strangers to the cage every couple days.  


But from that point forward, just as the train worker had suspected, whenever he brought them by...  


...No one wanted me.  


"What about that one?" He would always suggest to the stranger, pointing to me, as I lay there, lifeless and armless in the back.  


But every time, the strangers would always decline, saying things like, "No thanks. Looks like someone already had a go at him. I want a fresh one."  


As time went on, and more and more people got picked, eventually only Phil and I remained.  


"We made it pretty far."  My best, and now only, friend in the cage said one night. "Looks like I'm next."  


"Don't say that." I said, "There's still hope."  


"Hope?" Phil replied.  


I stood up, walked over to the cage door, and began to push as hard as I could, before calling back to him. "Help me push it!"  


Phil did as I asked, and together, we tried our best to push and push, but the lock was too strong, and ultimately, the door never budged from its hinges.  


The next day, when the train worker brought a stranger by and asked him to choose between Phil and myself, I raised my hand and volunteered to go, attempting to buy Phil another day.  


But they scoffed at the unsettling condition of my body, and chose my best friend instead, dragging him away down the hallway as he looked back at me and smiled.  


And then it was down to me. The one that no one wanted.  


I was so unwanted, in fact, that it nearly drove the train worker mad, after having repeatedly failed to get rid of me, over and over and over again.   


On one such day, after a stranger had stopped by and left empty handed, the train worker started screaming at me from outside the cage. "You're a pathetic and useless excuse for a prisoner! I should have let you die that day, instead of saving you."  


"Well if you had others, you wouldn't have to blame me now would you?" I replied. "What happened to your once steady supply of victims?"  


"Beats me. Maybe someone figured it out. Or maybe victims just ain't in season right now."  


"Sounds like a supply chain issue to me."  


"Maybe. But I'm still left with the question. What do I do with you?"  


"Let me go."  


"Well I can't do that."  


"Why not?"  


"'Cause you know too much. Where this place is. What I look like."  


"I promise, if you let me go, I won't turn you in. I'll just forget about it."  


"Yeah, yeah. That's what they all say. Easy to say now. Then once you're free you start thinking about this place. Thinking of me. And want retribution for what happened to you. Next thing I know, there's a swat team at my door."  


"Please."  


"Besides, I can't just let you go. The bosses wouldn't be too happy about that."  


"Bosses?"  


"You know, the people that hired me."  


"Hired you? Someone hired you to do this? Who?"  


"You think I know? And even if I did, they made me sign an NDA."  


"Okay fine don't tell me. Just let me go."  


"Nope. If no one takes you in the next week, I'm gonna do it myself."  


Sure enough, a week went by without any takers, and the train worker came walking up to the cage, with a smile on his face.  


"I'm a man of my word. It's time to put you out of your misery." He said, opening the door and dragging me off, down the hallway, and back into the small room with the table and weapons rack.  


When we stepped inside, the train worker instructed me to sit on the table in the center of the room, facing a very specific direction.  


"Now don't look back. But the security camera behind you is recording everything. But only video. So if you want to get out of here, I want you to do exactly as I say." He began.  


"Um... okay." I replied, not entirely sure where he was going with it.  


"Now I'm going to grab a knife from the rack. Then I'm gonna come back over here, and pretend to stab you. After that happens, all I need you to do is play dead. And then I'll carry you out of here, and leave you in the dumpster. You'll wait until dark, at which point in time you can crawl out of it and run away from here. Understood?"  


"I guess. But wait. Why are you doing this?"  


I shouldn't have asked, but I needed to know.  


"Cause I'm getting transferred." The train worker replied, "This lost and found's not meeting their quota.  They’re sending me to another and decommissioning this one."  


"Wait. There's more of these?" I asked, trying to wrap my mind around what he had just said.  


"Yeah. Lots of them."  


"But why not just free me? What's with the theatrics?"  


"Cause they told me to finish you off. And they're watching."  


"And why not just kill me then? Not that I want that."  


"Cause I ain't no killer, kid.  A facilitator maybe, but I don't got it in me to go through with it myself."  


"Uh... I don't know what to say. Thank you?"  


"Don't mention it. Now, before we commence. Any other questions."  


"Yeah," I said, looking him in the eye. "What's your name?"  


"Dave." He said, with a smile.  


"Ryan."  


"Nice to meet ya, Ryan. And apologies for the arm, and what you went through here. It's just business."  


"Sure," I said with a smile of my own, as I began to realize that I probably had Stockholm Syndrome.  


Nevertheless, I trusted him, and went along the plan in full, and he was, as he had promised, a man of his word.  


Later that day, as soon as I saw the daylight turn to darkness through the crack between the garbage bin and its lid, I did as he instructed, crawling out of the dumpster and running as fast as I could to the nearest sign of civilization... a gas station a few streets away.  


After I told my story to the police, they raided the building at the end of the line, but just as my captor had told me, the place had been fully decommissioned, its cage removed and blood-splattered room now clean.  


It took me a little while to get readjusted to the outside world, the real world again, and acclimated to life with just one arm, but I got good at typing with one hand pretty quick.  


Now whenever I take the train, I set an alarm for the time it'll take me to get to my stop, even though I know I could never fall asleep on the train again.  


And every now and then, when I look at the subway map and see the last stop, I think about Dave, and wonder where all those other lost and found locations might be.
