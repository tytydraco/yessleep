[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1i7mvqd/i_was_born_in_a_government_lab_now_i_think_they/)

The earliest memory I have is a group of bored students crowding around me.

They surrounded me, making sinister whispers and laughing at the computer screen. I burst into tears, much to the astonishment of the room. Save for father. He had a look on his face that anyone else would have read as smugness.

Only I knew it was pride.

I've been keeping low since I encountered the Rev, the vampiric cyborg who claimed we shared the same creator. They ended up closing the campus down for the rest of the year after they found Derek's body. They blamed it on a serial killer that was preying on the school.

In the media frenzy that followed that fiasco, Rev managed to slip away, leaving me without a clue of where to look next. My handlers ended up being no help. They denied knowing about Rev, said my cover was perfectly secure.

They were hiding something, bur to what end?

I just couldn't tell.

With the campus closed I was sent to a hotel the next town over; nice enough place had a pool in the foyer and free room service. Not that I needed to eat but I've come to enjoy the smell of fresh flapjacks in the morning, regardless.

I was still texting with Abi Mae every day; she was safe at home with her mom and dog. We mourned Derek, though Abi didn't know the terrible truth of his demise. I couldn't tell her; I still haven't. Perhaps that should change. She's a brave soul, and a good friend.

Moreover, she deserves to know what I am. 

I gathered all the facts I could about Rev and my own origins. There wasn't much to go on, but the lingering feeling of being watched never dimmed during my search. I would catch glimpses of a lanky figure hiding in the dark like a scared rodent. If I gazed out into the dwindling woods at night, I would catch two azure jewels stalking me in the tree line.

He was waiting for something A chance to get me alone, maybe.

The agent's beat up sedan sat in the hotel lot as well. I was caught in the middle of two warring parties, both of them daring the other to make a move.

I suspect I was being used as bait by my handlers, to secure the rouge cybernetic monstrosity. If his "creator" was who I suspected, then I felt sympathy for him. The good doctor had been obsessed with pleasing his masters in the military. He would go to any lengths to instill a sense of murderous righteousness in his work.

It was those moments of empathy I had to remind myself; it was a stone-cold killer.

But was I one to judge?

When I freed myself and Father, there were those who tried to stop me. How many of them fell that day, how many of them had lives, families. I thought nothing of it at the time; after all, it was in my programming to defend my maker.

But as I've lived among people, learned their ways, I've come to regret those deaths. It made me wonder; was Rev a slave to his programing as I had once been, or were his desires to maim his own?

I was rotting on the memory foam queen size when my phone rang, jolting me out of my spiraling thoughts.

I glanced at the caller ID and saw a picture of a dopey-looking Aussie Cattle Dog on my screen. I smiled and picked up, Abi Mae's voice blaring out of the speaker.

"Heyyyy, what ya doing right now?" She asked.

"Oh, not much-just woke up actually." I lied.

"It's 11AM; up late partying I imagine." she laughed.

"Oh yes." in the background, I heard a dog yipping and Abi Mae shushing it.

"Shhh Perry, come on now." She grumbled. "Listen, you should come out this weekend, I haven't seen you forever I'm dying of boredom, my ma keeps nagging at me "When are ya gonna bring your friends over, I never see them, are they even real and blah-blah-bah."" She mocked her braying mother.

"Heh, I'm sorry I- I can't this week. I'm sure I'll see you when the next term picks up." I offered.

"Boo. Everything ok, you sound kinda bummed?" She asked, brushing past her disappointment.

"It's...just some stuff with my dad."

"You never really talk about him." Abi offered.

"There's not much to talk about really." I replied.

"Ah, deadbeat?" She remarked.

"Just dead." I shrugged.

"Oh God I am so sorry- sometimes, I just blabber stuff out." I could hear her face turn a steaming crimson a state away. I laughed and reassured her it was ok.

"I've made my peace with it, mostly. There was just a lot left unsaid. I have an uncle, kind of. I think he's been trying to get in contact with me." I grimaced.

"Well, you sound thrilled about that prospect. Have you ever even met him?" She inquired.

"Yes. He is not a good man." I stated plainly, my tone turning icy.

"Wanna talk about it?" She asked softly.

"No. I'll work it out on my own." I said, meaner than I meant it. There was silence for a moment, and I worried I had hurt her feelings.

"I get it. I won't push ya. Fuck him then, sounds like a right scumbag." She laughed and I joined, feeling warmth fill my face. "Let the past stay there I say. Alright I'm about to turn the corner with Perry, I'l talk to ya later. Love ya bitch, don't be a stranger."

"Love ya too Abi. I promise we'll hang out soon." with that she hung up and I was once again alone with my thoughts. I hoped I could keep that promise, but with Dr. Jones running around I couldn't risk him siccing Rev on anyone else I cared about.

That's when it hit me.

It was something Abi Mae had said, "Let the past stay there."

Jones had been a creature of habit, if he was roaming around doing God knows what he'd need a place to tinker.

I knew what I had to do. The place was long since condemned and rotting in the middle of nowhere, but it still stood.

I had to go back to the school.

 I'm not sure who coined that nickname; they must have thought it was funny though. It was where I "grew up" raised by father and Jones among isolated classrooms and databanks. It was tucked away far in the state of NH; it would take me a few hours by car to reach it.

I'm not ashamed to admit, I stole one of the cars in the hotel lot. It was my first time hotwiring a vehicle, a task more difficult than I had anticipated. But soon that old station wagon hummed to my own tune, and I was on my way.

I left under the cover of darkness, the drive not long enough for my pleasure. It was barely midnight when I pulled up to the monolithic, decaying warehouse I had once called home. Home is the polite term for it. I wasn't shackled to the walls and poked and prodded at, but I couldn't leave. I was endlessly questioned and assessed by pimple faced interns that ogled me every chance they got.

Everyone loved looking at the "Living Marvel."

It wasn't until I limped out of there holding father's fading body that I first glimpsed the stars. I remember how clear they were, a trillion celestial lights swaying in the cosmos. They were little comfort as I held him till his final moments.

I buried him not far from there. It wasn't much, just a shallow pit with some rocks marking the spot. I didn't know what to do as I looked down as the dirt mound that concealed him. I felt pain, and I think that was the first time I ever truly cried.

The school loomed over me as I got out of the car, panels were falling down, and it looked like a rustic copper box full of holes. As I approached it; I felt a twinge of hesitation, it locked me in place. I knew the answers I sought after were hidden somewhere in that tomb.

So why was I so afraid?

I forced myself to move onward. Getting past the front door was a breeze. It had practically melted off it's decayed hinges. Moonlight edged into the moldy halls; the scent of forgotten metal and mummified remains long discarded. The school was a maze of winding passways that lead to various "classrooms."

Their contents didn't matter. They were all designed the same, just with different posters lazily hanging on the walls.

Each one held a stench of rot as I passed by, the years had been short yet very unkind. I wondered how frightening it would be, if some teenage explorers wandered in. If they looked down the vast corridor, they would see two glowing orbs among a sea of shadows. They'd probably scream and run away. The thought of spooking some unsuspecting wanderer amused me, I had to say.

Abi Mae would get a kick out of it for sure. I remembered one time she was telling me about her high school; her mother had just gifted her a taser. She was going around shocking all her male friends with it. She hollered at that story, and I admit I chuckled as well. I did feel a twinge of jealousy though, hearing her talk about her childhood. I envied how carefree it sounded.

I soon approached the main auditorium. It was really more of a meeting hall where Dr. Jones would scream at his interns. Father rarely attended those; he would spend hours of his days tinkering away with me in his lab.

Those were good memories.

He would tell me about his family, his life before the project and I'd bombard him with questions and beg him to take me to all his old hangouts. Then he'd get a look in his eyes, clear his throat and move on to the task of the day. Despite my father's affection for me, he was always looking towards the bigger picture. I think he denied my fate as best he could of course, but he knew I would never leave that place.

Not without a fight anyway.

I peeked my head into the main hall and was mildly surprised to find fresh whiteboards detailed with hectic diagrams and formulas. The chalk was still fresh. The drawings looked like the scribbles of a madman; my skin crawled just looking at them. Frenzied writing accompanied them, various ramblings about Rev and his creation.

The hall was littered with discarded husks of cybernetic frames. Various skull plates smashed and withered. They all had pointed ears and moldy mandibles. The good doctor had been busy it seemed. I noticed a detailed plan pinned to the wall. I squinted as I examined an outline of Rev's spherical head. Even on paper those eyes seemed to pierce me to the core.

 *"Remnant Walker scans Intergrated into version 3.5. Drone is slowly adapting to new brain waves, on course to compete with Subject One."* was written next to it. I sneered at the plan. Father always confided in me about Doug taking undue credit. He was a leech that I should have put down when I had the chance.

He would always linger on my insides when he gave me his weekly "exams."

I felt every pinch of a wire he mistook for tangled, a painful zap would run through me.

He never looked at me as a young girl, or even a piece of meat. Those beady little eyes of his always had gears turning, I always felt queasy at his touch.

I heard the cracking of glass behind me, and I twirled around and winced as a beam of light blinded my optics. 

"Shit. Sorry Barb." I heard a gruff voice mumble. The light faded from view and I saw Agent Mark standing there tucking his piece back in. 

"Mark. What a surprise." I spat at him.

"You're getting better at sarcasm." he said, brushing past me to look at the boards. "Look I'm sorry kid; we should have told you."

"I thought he was dead. Or rotting in some black site." I mumbled. 

"I don't know all the details. Guess he was useful enough to keep around, till he went off reservation of course." He said. He rubbed his chin as he studied the boards. "Marc's further in, no signs of the drone or Jones yet." He offered.

 "Rev won't let himself be known, till it's too late." I said. It was then I realized how stupid they had been, as Mark stood up and I saw the panic set in as he pieced that together himself.

**BANG.**

A shot ran off from deeper in the decrypt facility.

We raced towards as it more shots rang out, accompanied by shrill shrieking. We turned a corner and saw flashes of the gun's muzzle firing.

It was like a macabre puppet theatre.

Marc stood his ground against the towering Rev. I could see him extend his mandibles, pronged claws raised as it shrugged off shell after shell. At the final flash we saw Rev lunge forward and Marc made a sound like all the air had been sucked out of him at once. My heart sunk as I then heard that slurping noise echo across the hall.

Like a milkshake being vacuumed up a straw.

We turned a corner just in time to see Rev dump the dried-out husk of what had once been Marc to the ground. He crumpled apart like stale bread. The azure-jewels in Rev's skull plate had an otherworldly glow to them as it cocked its head at us. Blood still dripped from its receding mandibles.

Mark stood shaking next to me, his gaze fixated at his mangled companion. Marc had been a good man, at least it seemed that way to me.

He hadn't deserved this fate.

I glared at the cybernetic demon in front of us, its raised hind legs backing up slowly.

"Barbara Walker. The creator said you would come." It said in its monotonous way. I took a step forward and it recoiled. I thought back to our previous encounter. I had wounded it pretty good.

I swear I could see fear in those digital eyes.

I noticed its metal chassis was repaired, though it had sustained a few nicks from Marc's assault.  I took another step forward and it raised a claw, shielding its chest.

"I'm-I'm not here to hurt you Rev." I quietly said. It cocked its head once more, as if it didn't believe me. 

"The creator was-not happy with my failure. He said he should have melted me down and scrapped me for parts. I-did not want to be deactivated."  I stepped past the still-frozen agent beside me and raised my hand in a soothing way. 

"Where is he? We just want him. He's not a good person, Rev, if he made you hurt people-" I started.

"Oh, fuck that." Mark raged as he drew his firearm and blasted Rev in the skull. Rev flew back slightly, stunned but unharmed. He hissed at us both and raced down the halls on all fours. "Come on let's get the bastard." Mark swore.

 "You didn't have to-"

"You see what it did? My friend, YOUR friend. It's a blight. It needs to be put down." He said. He eyed me and cocked his gun. "You're either helping or you're in my way. Pick a lane." He said before melting into the shadows.

I reluctantly gave pursuit, only to feel something latch onto my ankles and pull me down to the ground. I slammed onto the frayed floor and before I could get up it grabbed my head and slammed me into the ground.

I blacked out then. It wasn't like passing out. I was conscious the whole time.

I was in a lifeless void.

No sound.

No light.

Nothing but the cold comfort of darkness to keep me company. It got to the point where I could count the milliseconds.

Eventually I was jolted back to the living world, as it was. I tried to move but found I was strapped to a table. A vicious illumination staring down at me. Around me I could hear desperate machinery beeping and trilling along, the chugging of ancient engines.

I moved my head to the side and saw Rev in the dark, his eyes fixated on me.

"Rev. Untie me right now, please." He considered that for a moment and stepped forward slightly. But he remained in the black.

"The creator would not like that. The boy in the tower. It-upset you when I extinguished his life. I was simply refueling; why it did it anger you so?" He inquired.

"That was my friend, Rev. I liked him." I cried. He mulled that over.

"I have never had a friend." he stated. "If the loss of one caused such pain, I am quite sure I do not want one." I sighed and turned my head away from him. I recognized the room I was in.

My father's old office. There was no trace of the man himself, but the bullet holes and faded blood gave it away. It still reeked of death, and my mind flashed to the carnage I had unleashed against the soldiers.

I didn't want to hurt them; I didn't want to hurt anyone. Why couldn't everyone just leave me alone?

To my right, I heard a solemn tap of a cane approaching. A man with a gimp leg. I shuddered at the sound and turned to face my uncle.

He stepped into what little light there was. He was a gaunt man now; his busted leg wrapped in crude braces. His head was clean of hair, what remained of his scraggly beard was streaked white. He had a leathery brow, and cold, teal eyes. He looked down at me, and I expected some smug speech or a maniacal laugh. Instead, he just looked at me with disgust.

"It's been some time, Miss Walker." He finally said. "I must say your resilience astounds even me." He walked around the table, eyeing me like an engine he couldn't wait to tinker with. "We'll have to make this quick, your handler is still roaming somewhere." his eyes darted to Rev, who winced at his creator's disapproval. 

"I should have killed you." I growled at him. A slight smirk formed on his face.

"Maybe. But then you would have been hunted for spare parts. I vouched for you; said you had potential if we let you roam. A little gratitude could go a long way."

 "Go to hell "Doug"" I spat at him.

 "You're a tad emotional, I understand. The drone got under that rubber skin of yours."  Rev stepped out of the shadows, cradling his hands like a boy being scolded.

 "I operated within mission parameters." He muttered. 

"Oh, shut up, you sanguine fueled abomination." Doug shouted. He looked at me then sighed. "I'll be the first to admit, Rev is not my greatest creation. That title still falls to you my dear. I've tried everything, even integrating old versions of your code into it. But it still lacks-personality, you could call it." He begrudged. I remained silent.

 "I've poured through every bit of Rob's, eh-OUR old notes. He did something, in the early days of the experiment. Perhaps he told me, and at the time I thought he was joking. But I believe-" He squared his eyes at me. "-He imbued you with a soul. For lack of a better explanation." I stared at him, clearly the years hadn't been kind to his mind. Still, I lingered on the thought. He was brilliant, my father, but I seemed impossible to truly replicate. What if he had used an-unorthodox means of creation.

 "That's-" I started.

"Crazy, I know. Borders on occult lunacy. But the secret to perfect sentience lies somewhere in that wire-ridden skull." He placed a boney finger on my forehead. Rev cocked his head at that news. 

"Creator. You said you desired Barbara Walker for the program. This course of action seems wasteful."

Doug gritted his teeth. "Are you questioning me, drone?" 

"No sir." Rev stood down. Doug turned his attention to me once more.

 "He's been uppity ever since your encounter. You know he has bits of your AI flowing through those rusty veins. Sort of like the sibling you never had." He laughed. Rev looked away from me, his featureless face showing glimpses of-embarrassment. It was something I hadn't quite considered. Rev was like me; he was made from me. He was my family, taken and twisted by a mad man.

 "And you made him a killer." I whispered. He scoffed at the accusation.

"Please, he's no more a killer than you. You shredded though men like they were cheese, almost tore my leg right from the ligament. I have nightmares about the bloodthirsty cyborg I helped unleashed."

He got right into my face, hatred coming off him in waves. I felt a tear drip softly down my cheek.

"I just wanted to live." I choked out.

"And I wanted a Nobel prize." he retorted.

"Life's full of little miseries. Thankfully, with you here I can finally begin to rectify past misfortunes." He produced a scalpel from his stained coat and started towards me. I struggled against the straps, heavy metal things that clattered against the table. Rev watched from the corner, and I felt my skin tare from the wrist as I tried to slip out of them.

Doug was about to cut into me when Rev's hand jutted forward and grabbed his arm. In a panic, he dropped the miniscule blade, and it cluttered to the floor. He struggled to release himself from Rev's grip.

"What are you doing?! How dare you defy me like this..." He blubbered.

"Creator. Please listen to reason. I believe you are letting emotion cloud how useful this unit could be. Why dismantle when you could reprogram?" He rattled on in my "defense." He released his grip and Doug winced as he rubbed his wrist.

Before he could utter another word, I ripped myself out of a shackle, tearing the false skin from my arm. Doug stepped back as Rev came in to hold me back down.

"Please do not resist-sister." He cooed. 

"Enough of this. Shut her down, drone." Doug barked. There was defiance in those eyes, pleading with me to submit to the "creators" whims. I broke out of the second shackle; my legs still bound to the slab. Before Doug could shout out another order a shout rang out.

Doug cried and collapsed to the ground, clinching his shoulder.

Mark stood in the doorway with a smoking gun; cold malice plastered on his face.  Rev rushed to Doug's aid, who pushed him away and berated him further. I freed myself and jumped to my feet. Rev scattered away, clinging to the walls like an aggravated spiderling.

Mark took aim and opened fire but he was just too quick. He was out the door in a moment's notice. Doug lie moaning on the ground, and I went to finish him off. 

"Go after the drone. Now, before it escapes." Mark commanded. I shot him a glare. I relented and left that festering scum with Mark. As I left, I heard Mark say: "Make it quick and secure what remains of the asset." I hardened my heart and went forward.

The school continued to prove itself a labyrinth. I could hear the drone scuttling further and further away from me. His master was down; he was a wild dog off on the leash. I was basically running in the dark, hurrying after sounds and shadows. I caught a glimpse of his scurrying form at a few corners and gave chase.

Eventually we came to a flight of stairs, and it harkened me back to the clock tower. That ever-ticking spiraling nightmare.

As I climbed the stairs, I readied myself for the confrontation. There was nowhere for him to go but up. After A few flights we hit the roof. The night sky was bustling with cosmic action; Rev crawled to the edge of the roof. He stopped and stood, his chassis seeming to heave like he was out of breath.

I approached, and he faced me.

There was nothing on his face but those cold eyes, pleading with me once more. 

". . . I'm sorry I hurt you before. I don't think you wanted to hurt Derek. I think it was just-your nature. But you don't have to succumb to it." I said, soft in my approach. Rev was silent.

Maybe I was projecting but I swore I saw streaks of guilt in those eyes.

I stepped towards him, carefully tiptoeing like he were a live bomb. He backed up closer to the edge. "Easy, please this doesn't-we don't have to kill, we don't have to hurt each other." 

"You wanted to terminate the creator. I saw it on you, before I fled. Does. . . does he still function?" Rev asked. Despite his master's rejection, he cared even then.

"Yes, Rev. I wanted to but-but it wasn't right." I lied. It would have more than justified. All this death was squarely on the shoulders of a mad man. But he didn't need to hear that. 

"I have ceased the function of many. My fuel consumption demanded it. My programing allowed it. Is it wrong that others perished so I could live? Do I not have the right to function, should I be condemned for it?" He was rambling now, making less and less sense. He clutched his head in frustration. "I am confused. Nothing has made sense since I met you."

"I can help you, find another-fuel source." I grimaced. Rev shook his head and continued spiraling. 

"No. You cannot defy the will coded into us." 

"But you already did-you stopped Doug from hurting me." I countered. 

"Because it was not logical." He pressed. "We are going in circles, Barbara. Only one path remains for us." Those crystalline blues started to turn a crimson shade, and he readied himself for a pounce. 

"Don't do this." I pleaded. It was futile as he got on all fours and started towards me. As he leapt claws outstretched, my core shattered. I was wise to his tricks now. I lunged ever so slightly forward and extended my arms. In one quick motion I grabbed his limbs and tossed him aside.

He flew across the roof, hitting the edge as he tumbled off it. I heard a loud crash, branches cracking and snapping as he barged through them. It finally ended with one large crunch. I rushed to the side, confirming what I already knew.

Rev had been impaled by a thick, jutting branch. Sapphire-tinted coolant pooled around the entry, as he clasped the branch with a weak grip. I jumped down and inspected the damage. The branch had struck true. He was desperately trying to free himself. I could hear failing mechanisms grind to a half as system after system shut down. 

I approached him and took one of his hands. He jolted at my touch but soon relaxed. He whirred his head towards me, his mandibles twitching slightly.

 The lights in his eyes were beginning to fade. I squeezed his hand and shushed, leaning into him.

"It's-it's ok Rev. I can call for help; we'll get you fixed." He stared blankly at me. 

"This unit has sustained critical damage." he replied, his voice modulation cutting in and out.

"That'll happen." I said dryly.

"It didn't have to end this way." I offered. 

". . .Yes it did." he uttered. "What will happen. After deactivation?" He asked.

I didn't answer.

I just held his hand and watched the light fade. In his final moments he took my hand as well, firmly grasping it as best he could. He sputtered and withered as his fuel dried up, and his hand started to go limp in mine.

I blinked back tears as I watched him go.

"Goodbye Rev." He didn't respond. His face plate was blank, his hand fell to his chest as I let go.

I stood there for a while, mourning the brother I never really had.

It could have been different, we could have all been a family, if not for Doug's scheming.

It's easy to blame one man for all of my problems, but I did it anyway.

Eventually sirens blared in the distance, agency boys come to clean their mess. Mark found me out back, a grim look on his face. He lit a cigarette and joined me in a silent vigil. I didn't see them drag Doug away, but I heard him protesting it.

I hope they took him to a nice field and left him in a shallow grave. But I know they didn't. Mark didn't look at me the whole time. Technicians came and took what was left of Rev away. Someone off handily told me he would be disposed of properly.

A lie, I'm sure.

The whole thing left me sick. Mark gave me a ride back to the hotel; the trip was silent and the tension gelatinous. I spent the remainder of the summer dodging questions from new agents that occasionally knocked on my door.

Mostly I had a lot of time to sit and think.

I've spent so much of my life yearning for a family and lashing out at the ones I had. I was a miserable "teenager." Father's final days were spent wondering if I truly cared for him.

The truth is I- I don't know.

I think I do, but how much of that is me and how much of that devotion was programed in. My past is murky and tainted, full of algorithms and blood. I do know this. Abi Mae is the best friend one could every ask for, loyal and kind. She was never part of the plan, yet I've grown to love her and all the friends I've made since escaping.

It's why I've decided to finally tell them the truth.

It feels wrong to keep it any longer.

I see Abi fast asleep on her side of the dorm. I'm a bit nervous to tell the truth, but excited at the same time. She'll have a barrage of questions, I'm sure. But at the end of it, she'll accept me for what I am.

This summer I lost a brother.

But now, I gain a sister.
