The ship looked like a mirage at first -- shimmery and intangible. The cheerful voice of the helmsman caught me by surprise.


"Fuckin' told you, Lez! That's it right there -- the HMS Dagon!"


I always thought the name was a bit garish.


We had been following the trail longer than we thought. This whole endeavor was a fever dream, honestly. Go off into the northern Atlantic, find the Dagon -- a ship that never officially existed. Apparently the good ol' Crown liked to use her to raid and gut native cultures up and down the eastern coast of South America.


The only captain she ever knew was, evidently, my great-grandfather. We had his old, crumbling journals detailing his assignment to the vessel. He led a wild life -- they called him Brazil Bob, a well-established pirate, though his competition was mostly imaginary. He was one of the last pardoned privateers. A pirate under the Crown.


His real name was much less interesting to anyone but me: Robert Thatch. I'm sure he'd be thrilled to know his lineage is still bravely -- or not so bravely -- charting the unknown patches of the sea.


My bravado was superficial at best. As soon as the Dagon came into focus, my blood ran cold. I'm related to a fucking pirate. The fear I was already carrying nestled itself into a cocoon of shame.


Timmy, the young but experienced navigator, loudly asked, "Ready to walk the plank, boss lady?" -- just as the thought was settling.


Poor Timmy.


Without much thought or intention, I spun around sharply, my shoulder clipping his jaw. Timmy went down pretty hard. Crazy how a tap to the chin is a "lights-out button." I'll have to apologize later.


I'd spent years poring over those journals, committing every letter to memory. Then spent even more years developing an algorithm to predict the flow of the Atlantic across a few hundred years. I knew where he disembarked from. I knew where he was going. But I needed to know where he was now.


The Reverie, our vessel, drifted silently alongside the Dagon, dwarfed by its hulking mass. Stepping aboard with a small group of fellow explorers felt surreal. The deck was sun-bleached, but otherwise pristine -- not shocking, though something about its perfection still felt wrong, considering the preservative properties of nearly Arctic, salty air.


She was large, and grand, even for her time. As I surveyed the perimeter of the deck, I ran my hands along the waist-high beams of polished wood. After a few minutes, I realized my eyes had closed, and all I was doing was feeling the grain of the luxurious timber.


It was Timmy who startled me again.


"Been that long since you've seen good wood, huh?"


His voice was slightly slurred from the gauze in his lip, but his indecency was understood. Asshole.


"Timmy. Please, just shut the fuck up," I muttered, monotone.


He replied quickly, his tone a faux apology. "Aw, c'mon, Lez. I was kidding. I know you think I'm funny."


I have never once, in my half a decade knowing Timothy Gonzalez, ever even snickered at his jokes. I stared at him, expressionless, signaling my irritation.


Thatch women do not suffer fools.


As I turned away from him, a glint of metal dangling off the mast caught my eye. I neared it and recognized it as a key. Not an old-timey key like you'd expect, but a modern one -- the word MASTER etched into its surface.


"Hey, which one of you hung this key here? Doesn't this go to one of our storage cases?" I asked -- mostly to myself.


Their blank stares seemed mocking at first. Knowing I wasn't going to get an answer, I assumed someone was planning a shitty prank.


Timmy. Fucking Timmy.


I pocketed the key and continued my survey.


The door to the captain's cabin was unlocked, so I helped myself in. Upon the cartography table, standing central in the cabin, was a metal case. It wore a considerable layer of flaking rust over its matte stainless steel fa√ßade.


The realization was startling, if only because of its implication: this was our case. That was from our ship. But here it was, ravaged by years of ocean air.


Did Timmy put this here? Some kind of paint to look like rust?


I ran a finger along the corroded edge and realized the oxidation was authentic -- not decorative.


The key slid into the lock with a bit of a struggle, but gave a satisfying click as the pins fell into place.


I lifted the lid and was immediately confused by its contents: a simple journal, nearly identical to the ones I'd cherished as a girl, sat centered in the foam interior.


The front cover was wood. Scrawled on its surface was the name: Robert Thatch.


A long, deep gash had sliced through Robert's first name. Scribbled above it was another name: Lezlie.


My name.


The rough-hewn inscription looked fresh. I ran my hand over the carving -- splinters still reaching heavenward.


What the fuck is going on here? I rested my hand against the wooden cover. It was warm to the touch. I swear I felt a faint, but very present, pulse beneath my palm.


I cracked open the journal and began to read the first page.


*I didn't expect such a lofty assignment, given my dodgy past. I suppose they're calling it the Dagon. A bit gaudy, in my opinion. I was called to London to receive my post, and my stipend, and that's where I first set eyes on her.*


*She was grand, and massive -- just as gaudy as her name. They built her in the southern reaches of the New World. The endless jungles I'd only ever heard of. The lumber used to build the ship was not the only spoil to be had from the one-sided conquest. Our navigator, Tim -- of course not his birth name -- was pressed into service.*


*He was quite proficient at reading star charts and understanding the winds and tides. A born seaman. Tim was pleasant, if maybe a bit immature. Hard to hold against him in the springtime of his life.*


*We stepped on board, and her deck was already bleached from the unrelenting sun of the South American coast. The deck was most presentable -- not a fragment of rubbish cluttered her planks. I ran my hands across the beams, admiring the grain of the exotic material.*


*"Oh Captain, I didn't realize you enjoyed that variety of company!" Tim chimed, thinking himself clever, knowing how to speak a civilized tongue.*


*Though the humor was not wasted on me, Thatch men do not suffer fools. I administered penalty there on the deck and backhanded him across the cheek. "Two days for your remark, another for this false familiarity," I stated clearly. I made my way to what were going to be my quarters as Tim was taken below deck to the ship's spacious brig.*


*As I entered, I noticed an odd artifact on the map table. It was rectangular, and the front of it was glossy black, like igneous rock. As I picked it up, the front illuminated and displayed a face -- a woman's face. In the background of the image, lying flat on a table, was the very diary I now write in.*


*What evil craft is at play here?*
