I’ve read on the internet about bacteria and worms and all of that sort of creepy bugs that infect and kill humans from lakes and things, but none of it can be true, as my family have a history of being in the wilderness near my parents home once a year and I, if anyone should notice worms because of my bug shop that had been passed down the family for decades. 

A trait that has been passed down my family is our green eyes, like emeralds as my wife says, but the peculiar property about it is that if you married into the family you eyes turned magically green. My wife, Samantha, was prepared to turn to green eyes as all of the people that had married into the family before her; but there were side-effects to this change which included, migraines, cramps, and dizziness but not enough to hospitalise someone.

A week before mine and Samantha’s wedding we went on our annual trip to the forest with my parents, the forest was filled with oaks, and pines, until we came to a clearing, and we found my parents favourite spot in the woods a little lake beside a boat shack, the boat shack was old and rotting, so no one used that anymore, usually when we go to the lake we swim in the water which my parents believe keep them young and I do too, but Samantha was not buying it, she was adamant about staying dry, but eventually with promises of a massive wedding, she was convinced, we all went in  and it was refreshing, not the clearest water but good enough to swim in.

Our wedding was a large one, lots of wine, food and friends and was one of the happiest  days of my life, we got home and went to bed tired, no time for kissing, and this is where shit hit the fan.

At first at around 11, she had headaches, bad ones at that, then the dizziness, then migraines, I gave her some meds, but it only went downhill from here. She stumbled into the en-suite bathroom to our bedroom, to gather herself, but this is where the crawling started. At first a shrill scream pierced through the house, I immediately jumped up and banged on the bathroom door and she let my in, what I saw next left me in pure terror. A long 4 inch or so white piece of string emerged from her increasingly green eyes, I tried to tug it out but it just kept coming out of her eye, I quickly darted across the room to get my phone and dialled 911. In this time another long string extended from my wife’s ear, I was going to be sick but what happened made me almost choke on my vomit, both of her eye balls softly dropped, from her sockets and onto the floor, exposing a nest of what appeared to be worms in her eye socket and brain, the worms appeared to be bawling the remaining flesh around her sockets, my wife at this point had fallen onto the floor and hard, clearly unconscious, and possibly dead, if not soon. I heard sirens outside my window cutting through the air like a knife, and that is when I felt something wander out of my eye.
