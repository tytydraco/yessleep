[Part 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1dqxaf9/lemme_tell_you_bout_my_swamp_towns_cryptid_part_1/)

I will now recount the events of the Cypress Pointe incident.

It happened too fast for those poor kids to comprehend. It was Liz Derallo’s thirteenth birthday, the day when summer fun turned dreadful. They had all heard the legends, but those three had played in the swamp their entire lives and truly believed they had nothing to fear.

Liz’s best friend Emily always had the best intentions. She was a sweet girl who never wanted to hurt anyone, but she often called Liz "beanpole," despite Liz scowling at the name. On Liz’s thirteenth birthday, Emily took her and her little brother Roland on an errand in the swamp. Emily had planned to make Liz a crown out of the pretty violet flowers, but they spotted a bunny with a broken foot struggling in the swamp grime.

Despite Emily’s buck-toothed little brother, Roland’s protests against the swamps' methane stink, little Emily's heart melted at the sight of the injured critter. Liz fought back tears as she watched Emily gently lift the panicked bunny while the swamp's buzzing cacophony of unseen wildlife droned through the atmosphere. 

Young Roland agreed that they should help, but Liz tried to argue that her grandfather warned her to never mess with the rabbits in the swamp. As if jinxing her, poor Emily immediately tripped and fell, landing hard on the wounded bunny with a crunch—as if collapsing atop a bag of glass. 

Emily lay frozen on her belly, and with tears streaming down her cheeks. The swamp's chorus of croaking frogs and buzzing insects ceased, the cryptic silence turned fetid.

Liz’s grandfather had told her stories of the pink gas. Potent and choking vanilla—worse than any fecal swamp fart. The dank flavor clung onto the back of Liz’s throat like barbs, she gagged and nearly vomited. 

Emily gazed down at the rabbit's guts splattered on her coveralls, but Liz wasn’t looking behind her. A mound, big and silver and green, was rising from the swamp. Emily turned,  and her scream lasted only a moment before her tongue swelled up and burst like a water balloon.

Liz acted swiftly, seizing Roland's hand—his small, trembling fingers wrapped around hers. She turned and ran, her heart pounding in her chest. The Mire Drip’s roar echoed behind her, its deafening howl reminiscent of an industrial-sized hair dryer combined with a cement-mixer. She didn't dare glance back, keeping her eyes fixed on the path ahead, and leaving Emily behind. Despite his small stature, holding Roland's clammy hand provided a comfort, until it became wrong.

Roland's hand transfigured, instantaneously. Changing from damp to soft and fuzzy. Liz's heart skipped a beat when Roland screamed, his voice turning high-pitched and distorted. Whiskers sprouted from his face and his large buck teeth grew to the size of a beaver’s. His bones audibly stretched with sickening cracks and pops that echoed through the quiet swamp. His eyes widened in terror as his transformation continued, twisting his small body into something unrecognizable.

Liz let go of his hand, covering her mouth in horror. She could feel her heart pounding, her hands trembling. Roland hit the swamp floor and shrank down until disappearing into his clothes. The sound of bones cracking and skin stretching was accompanied by the pungent stench of the swamp, the sickly vanilla haze, and the metallic tang of blood. 

Staring at his empty clothes The choking, thick, pink air became too much, its bitterness coating all of her esophagus. Her eyes fixed on the lifeless heap of fabric.

“Roland?” she asked, all but pleading.

From within Roland's clothes, a small brown hare emerged. Liz watched in stunned silence as it twitched its whiskers, and stared with beady black eyes. The hare squeaked once before it scurried away into the woods.

Liz Derallo was found in the swamp two days after she had originally gone missing. This is the story she would go on to tell. She is among the growing number of alleged survivors of the Mire Drip.

I’ve reported on similar creatures in the both the Saffron and Goldenrod accounts. It’s hard to tell if the legend is spreading because the monster leaves these survivors, so more will attempt to trace it, or if there is something more sinister at play.

Every survivor suffers from what we’ve labeled as ‘mire fever.’ They experience psychotic episodes and will only speak about the Mire Drip as a relentless predator. Liz Derallo, like the others, endured these episodes, often trembling at any of the various episodic triggers. She often describes the eerie pink mist associated with the Mire Drip’s specific strand of swamp milkweed. Thick and pungent, with a stench of decay and vanilla that lingers in one’s nostrils.

Other symptoms include PTSD associated with recalling ghastly sounds: the whispers of the swamp, ghosts of victims, and the sickening pop of human blisters. Any shadows trigger episodes, as well as piles of loose cloth, in Liz’s specific case.

Liz Derallo recently kicked the bucket after stockpiling meds, a sad but predictable end that's become the norm for anyone who's tangled with the Mire Drip. This nasty creature seems to have a taste for those who engage in its specific creepy rituals. But, since it’s only terrorizing its local swamp, containment hasn't been deemed critical. However, with global warming possibly shifting its hunting grounds, I’m requesting additional funds to nail down specifics and figure out how to contain this beast before it broadens its [reach.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xef4A6nZeA)
