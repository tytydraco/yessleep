After recently coming across a Reddit post regarding Pigment dispersion syndrome, a condition which results in the pigment of your iris slowly releasing, revealing the pale blue layer beneath, along with a host of other less than desirable symptoms including atrophy of the iris, blurred vision, and even glaucoma, this post triggered a memory within me, long since forgotten. So long ago that I’m uncertain as to whether it was a dream or simply the product of a child’s wild imagination.

I must’ve been four at the time. My parents divorced 2 years after my birth, and I had been at my father’s house for the weekend. It was summer, and I’d been running around the yard enjoying the tranquility of a warm summer day in the countryside, much like many of us kids did in the 90’s before the advent of iPads and other electronic distractions. I’d been collecting different kinds of bugs around the yard which had led me into the garden in the far corner of the yard. That’s when I spotted it—a small white mass within the confines of a bush. At first, it appeared to be a stone of some sort, before I noticed its octopus-like tentacles emerge from beneath it, pulsating with an otherworldly type of energy. Two large blue eyes fluttered open on the mass, glistening in the sunlight. It appeared to be studying me with its silent eyes. Being a curious child, I began to step towards it. And then it happened—the creature morphed before my eyes, taking the form of a majestic bird, one I’d never seen before, its feathers shimmering in the breeze. I was mesmerized, unable to tear my gaze away as it transformed again, this time into a white cat, its eyes still that piercing shade of blue. My four-year-old mind raced with questions, but before I could make sense of it all, my father called me from the house, snapping me out of my trance. I ran back to the house, turning back once more to peer at the creature, its movements fluid and unnatural.

Upon entering the house, my dad had prepared lunch as I watched TV. Slowly, my mind began to drift from the strange creature I’d encountered in the garden. After lunch, my father told me he had to run out for a quick errand, retrieving some tools from down the road from a neighbor he’d lent them to. He said he’d only be gone for fifteen minutes and asked if I’d like to come along. Being all but transfixed on whatever show had been playing on the TV, I asked to stay home. Being only a quick errand, my father relented and set off through the front door.

Minutes turned to hours, and still, there was no sign of his return. Anxiety began to gnaw at my insides as I paced the living room, waiting for the sounds of his footsteps. It had begun to get dark outside when finally he returned home, strangely entering the house through the back door. I breathed a sigh of relief—until I noticed his eyes. Those once warm brown eyes, now a chilling shade of blue.
