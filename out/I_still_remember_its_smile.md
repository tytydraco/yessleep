I live in the Philippines, this is a story from my childhood.

When I was 7 years old me and my family went to the province of *San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan* to spend the summer vacation on. The trip was to the family home of my mom's side of the family, a humble 3 story old house renovated to fit the outgrowing neighborhood. When we arrived, my mom was immediately approached by my excited relatives as it has been a while since we went to the house. While the adults talked I was greeted by my older cousin *kuya* (big brother) Ian and his friend who like to call *ate* (big sister) Joanna.

My *kuya* Ian and *ate* Joanna were close to one another. I actually liked to tease my *kuya* about it that he'll develop feelings for her but he just brushed me off. Me and *ate* Joanna on the other hand were really close, my relatives used to joke how I actually act like her sometimes. We have the same hobbies, music taste, and behavior to some extent.

One day during our 5 day long trip, my *lolo* (grandpa) Uring was inviting me along with my *kuya* Ian and *ate* Joanna to the family owned banana plantation. I was skeptical with tagging along especially with the fact that it was quarter to 8PM that night. But my *kuya* urged me that it was fine, the family plantation is a private property that you can really only enter via the opening on the side of a major highway. He claimed that no one was gonna bother entering through a random opening on the side of the road which leads down a grassy pathway. So with boredom in my head and my old tablet in my hands, I went with them.

When we arrived to the opening in the highway, we went down a short flight of stairs to go to the bottom where the plantation was. When we got to the bottom, I was astounded with how wide the plantation looked especially with the new angle. My *lolo* Uring took me to the old *bahay kubo* or old wooden house as we Filipinos like to call it. It was actually pretty well maintained for something deep in the woods, it even has a bedroom. As I sat down, my *kuya* Ian and *ate* Joanna went off to collect some ripe bananas ready for harvest. My *lolo* Uring said that he'll call me if he needs my help. So I just sat alone in the *bahay kubo* with my tablet, playing fruit ninja as my *lolo Uring* also went off.

As the time went on, I can't help but notice the weird noise in the back of my mind. I thought it was just me until my senses finally kicked in, confirming that something was outside and its the one making the rustling. It was a small and minor sound so I just thought that it was just a group of chickens plucking the ground for food. But the sound got louder, I felt the source of it moving from place to place. I wasn't just the rustling bushes anymore, it was now making this weird growling mixed with random talking-ish noise. As it got louder I couldn't contain my curiosity and thoughts anymore, so I went outside to check.

As I got to the front door, the noise stopped and everything seemed to go back to normal, even the sound of the cicadas went back contrast to earlier where they all just went quiet. But as I went to the back of the *bahay kubo* it all started to go quiet again. The rustling and weird noise also stopped but it was replaced with an eerie feeling as I peeked over the back of the *bahay kubo*. I saw.. nothing, at first. It was just another group of banana trees. But as I squinted my eyes, I noticed, there was something out of place among the trees. I thought it was just another banana tree, a dead one I thought. But as I went closer, I realized, it was a person.

I was skeptical at first to myself if it was really a person. We Filipinos are not really tall people, but whoever was standing next to the banana tree was practically on par with its height, scrap that, it was TALLER than it. I talked to it since it was trespassing my family's property (\*translated) "SIR! What are you doing here? This is private property. You can't stay here, you have to leave.". I found myself pretty dumb for that question, I should have asked what in the world it was doing in a random banana plantation 8:30 in the night. Before I could continue, it moved. The things in its side which I thought were branches especially with how disfigured the look were actually his arms. It fidgeted a bit, before finally looking over its shoulder. Its eyes were black, and the pupil was replaced with a deep white color. I was absolutely horrified at that fact alone, I was frozen on the wooden floorboards of the *bahay kubo* as it finally moved its body, and walked towards me.

As it walked, I got a good look at just how tall it was. It would put some NBA players to shame as it crouched down over to my eye level, I was around 5'3 back then. It was wearing a tattered shirt, the ones you would expect a 14th century peasant would wear during the black plague. I couldn't react or think anymore as it stared deep into my soul with its black and white eyes. And then it happened, it smiled at me. A smile that would make the joker run for his money. It stretched out from cheek to cheek, its teeth were huge and fully white, it was straighter than a military parade. I couldn't stress myself hard enough to explain the absolute horror I felt that at that moment. I could become a billionaire and still never remove that image from my mind.

It leaned closer to me, it was about to put its humongous hands at the sides of my head, The nails alone where half the size of my hands but I felt like it was about to squeeze my entire head with its palms. I couldn't move, I was frozen in fear. At that moment, something pulled me back as I saw the thing's face kicked backward as it felt to the ground with a loud thud. It was my *ate* Joanna! She pulled me in her arms and screamed into the background (\*translated) "IAN! THE KAMAGONG!!" (A *kamagong* or velvet tree is a renowned tree in the Philippines, famous for its strength and durability). At that moment, my *kuya* Ian lunged out from the plantation in the background with a *Kamagong* tree bark and stabbed the thing right in its heart.

It screamed it absolute agony. The *Kamagong* bark drilled into its heart as it oozed out a black liquid. As my *kuya* Ian backed away towards our position. He was visibly shook too, I was hugging my *ate* Joanna so hard I was practically glued to her, as she was hugging me back, I can also feel her body shaking in fear over what was happening. The thing stopped shaking and screaming, it was starting to stand up (\*translated) "RUN! IT'S STILL NOT DEAD!". My *kuya* Ian screamed to us. Before I could react, my *ate* Joanna picked me up and bolted out of the plantation up towards the highway. I was a pretty tall and heavy kid for my age, but I guess the andrenaline got the best of her. As I looked over her shoulder I got a good look of what was happening as we were running up the staircase, I could the see the thing stand up in rage. It lunged its arms at my *kuya* Ian in an intent to kill. But my *kuya* Ian dodged through the opening between its arms and torso. My *kuya* Ian grabbed another *Kamagong* back from its pocket and this time, stabbed it in the neck. As it felled down to the ground, my *kuya* Ian was no longer taking any chances and repeatedly stabbed it multiple times in the neck.

Its screams were now distorted, it went from loud horrifying scream at first, to an adult man scream, to a scream of a young, to what sounded like a pig being slaughter, and then finally, what seemed to be demonic low pitch loud growling. As I lost vision of my *kuya* Ian, my *ate* Joanna finally got us both up to the highway. My *lolo* Uring was there, he was staring intently at the ground and leaning at the back of his pickup truck that was carrying the banana harvest that night. As my *ate* Joanna sat me down on the truck she calmed me down and assured everything was. I asked what will happen to *kuya* Ian was and she replied (\*translated) "Your *kuya* Ian has went through many things to be worried about some demonic entity on his family's plantation.". She gave me slight kiss on the forehead before running back down the highway. I looked at my *lolo* Uring and he was staring the length of the highway and giving it a death stare. He was acting really calm I thought to myself, there's no way he didn't hear that things screams. He probably did, but what was making him think that deep to himself? I couldn't really process anything anymore, I passed out on the back of the pickup truck as my *lolo* Uring finally got to his senses, I felt him carrying me inside the pickup truck before I finally lost consciousness.

The next morning, I woke up surprisingly early at 8AM, I went over to the terrace and saw my *lolo* Uring having breakfast with *pandesal* (traditional Filipino bread) and Nescafe. I sat down next to him and thought about what just happened last night. The rest of my family is gone, my *lolo* Uring started to talk. (\*translated) "They all left to the *palengke* (wet market) to buy stock for next week, you're probably in shock and wondering what happened last night aren't you?" I nodded. "That was a demon, not a fairytale demon, an actual demon. Demons cannot travel to the surface of the earth as we are under the grace of the gods. But humans, they have the capabilities of becoming the medium for demons. We humans, when we are under extreme stress, emotions, or feelings of wanting and needing something. We are exposed to demons looking for a way to the surface world.  Demons appear to us as what we want, trying to trick us into making a deal with them in exchange for what we need, but in reality, they just want our bodies."

In awe and disbelief, I asked where my *kuya* Ian and *ate* Joanna where. My *lolo* Uring said that they were at the plantation burying the body in a proper manner in order for the possessed soul to rest in peace. I asked for some money to commute my way over as the plantation and he actually gave me some. I rode a *jeepney* or traditional Filipino transport on my way to the plantation. As I went down, I saw my *kuya* Ian and *ate* Joanna praying at the spot where the demon was killed, they put a cross on top of it for assurance. My presence was immediately seen and they went over to me in a calm manner contrast to there usual rowdy behavior. We were just about to leave until I remembered, I completely forgot about my tablet. I asked for them to wait as I went back into the *bahay kubo* and picked it up from the couch. As I picked it up though, I felt like it was, brand new. The screen felt smooth and without traces of old use despite being 3 years old and in constant state of use. The tablet was laid on the couch before I picked it up and I saw a string of *sampaguita* flowers on top of it. And on the wall, the word, "*salamat*" was written, which means "thank you" in tagalog. I asked my *kuya* Ian about it as he entered the house, but he looked confused at what I said about the word on the wall. As I looked back, I saw the word on the wall was, gone. We went back to the house and the entire trip went calm for the next few days until we left. My family was not told about what happened that night.

Fast foward to now, im now a teen writing this. My *kuya* Ian and *ate* Joanna are now engaged! Im happy for them of course, but then I thought, with a life experience like that, I'd be more shocked if they just cut each other off like nothing happened. At the family meet as orchestrated by my *kuya* Ian and *ate* Joanna, I saw my *lolo* Uring standing at the terrace, was again eating *pandesal* and Nescafe. I sat down next to him, he then said if I remembered that night that happened 8 years ago. I was moved about what he had said, it felt so random and out of place. I respectfully replied yes and asked, why? My *lolo* Uring started to talk (\*translated) "I never really told anyone this, even your *kuya* Ian. But when the banana plantation was still small and taken cared of by my father, he had a friend who offered to be the caretaker of the land in the night as back then thieves would often steal food from plantations due to scarcity. My father's friend's name was Rodel, and according to my father, he was the nicest person he knew. He was kind, respectful, and a family man. Rodel would often repay small favors with big payments. But Rodel is often in challenges, often working more than one job in order to support his family. One morning, when my father went to the plantation, Rodel was nowhere to be found, his family was heartbroken as the only thing left was his tattered clothes and a mysterious black liquid splattered on the back of the *bahay kubo* you stayed in." My *lolo* Uring ended our conversation with: "I still remember how much my father was told thank you by Rodel."
