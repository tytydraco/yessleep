“I’m just waiting for a room,” my wife said. 

We were in the lobby next to the security guard station. There were only a handful of patients left.

*Thank God,* I thought. *Maybe they’ll see us soon.* 

When we had gone to the ER that morning, the nurse had told us, “if she doesn’t pee in eight hours, come back and get a new catheter.”

Well… it had been nine hours since my wife’s last urination. We needed help.

“I’m going to explode,” my wife groaned, holding her abdomen.

“They’ll see us soon.” I lied, squeezing her wrist. 

A frightened wail sounded at our feet. It was Macy, our newborn, squirming in her car seat. 

Next to us sighed a bald, sickly woman. She had a blood-stained bandage on her scalp and a bone-thin frame.

*Must be cancer,* I thought. 

I gave her a polite smile. 

It was then I noticed — 

— a strange man settled beside her. He was tall and pale and wore faded clothes. It was hard to tell from my angle, but it seemed like his face was —

“Honey.” My wife tapped my shoulder. “Can you ask when our room will be open?”

“Yes.”

I got up and searched for a nurse. But each one was busy or disappearing into various rooms. 

“We’re doing the best we can,” an EMT told me in passing.

I returned to my wife, “Just a few more minutes.”

Another lie.

As I sank in my seat, I glanced back to the bald woman. 

The man who had been sitting next to her was gone.

***

Forty minutes later, an EMT burst into the lobby, pushing a wheelchair.

“A room just opened up! Get her in!” 

By now my wife was spasming. Drool dribbled from her lips.

I helped the EMT transfer her into the wheelchair, then hoisted Macy along as we rushed through the double doors, and found an empty room. 

“Get her on the bed,” a nurse commanded, rushing in with a bladder scanner. 

I watched as they lifted my wife onto the cot. I was terrified, but grateful she was finally being seen.  

As I watched, a gurgling noise grew behind me. I turned —

— something pale and sickly darted from the doorway. 

I stepped out and peered down the corridor.

There was nothing there. 

***

After my wife stabilized, I handed over Macy to be breastfed. Then, I ducked out to relieve my own bladder.

As I made my way toward the restroom, a depressing sob drifted into my ears.

“Please… help…”

It was coming from a room just ahead.

“… oh god… it hurts…”

The voice was so desperate, so pleading. 

I wasn’t a doctor, but I could at least alert the nurses, if needed. I dashed toward the open doorway and noticed —

— a frail woman, maybe seventy years old, lying in bed. Her shirt was pulled up to expose her stomach. And…

… something was in bed with her. 

It was the pale man from the lobby. But now his clothes were gone. His skin was so thin and sickly it looked barely stretched over his bones.

His hands were on her stomach, like he was searching for something.

I was so confused and horrified. My voice shook as I spoke:

“Excuse me…”

The pallid man looked up. His face had two coal-black eyes, an undeveloped, skeleton-like nose, and a bizarre, wet grin.

I spun on my heel and ran.

***

My wife relaxed visibly when I got back. The new catheter was working. Macy was asleep, resting in her mother’s arms.

“My goodness, Todd. You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

“I do? I’m just tired.” 

I made my way toward my wife, so mortified that I fell down against the side of the bed, sobbing.

“It’s going to be okay,” she said, caressing the back of my neck. “I prayed while the nurse was helping me.”

“You did?”

“Yes. I felt this dark presence following me. But it shifted right after the new catheter was put in. Does that sound strange?”

“No. Not at all.”

The sound of footsteps alerted me to the door. 

The pale man was watching us. His worm-like lips turned into a disturbing frown.

“What on earth is that?” My wife asked.

“I don’t know.”

The macabre figure emitted a world-weary sigh, slumped his shoulders, and slinked back into the hall.
