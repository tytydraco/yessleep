"Content Warning: >!Mentions of self harm and child abuse.!<" 

I’ve been an investigative journalist for the past 15 years. What I’m about to share with you is by far the most haunting and disturbing thing I’ve uncovered during my whole career. Here it goes. 

I was contacted a couple of months ago by a woman I was vaguely acquainted with. A friend of a friend of a friend. We talked briefly on the phone. She sounded very distraught and insisted on meeting me in person. I happily obliged and invited her to a quiet café where I usually get my work done.

When I first saw her, I could tell this was going to be heavy. She looked like she hadn’t slept in days. She was dressed randomly, her hair was a mess, her eyes were red, and she was… angry. Furious. And she wanted the whole world to know about what happened to her son. 

She shared with me some screenshots that I transcribed for you here. Fair warning, they are very graphic. **If you’re not comfortable with harm inflicted on children, I suggest you skip this one.**

**[Eva]**  Hi :) Welcome to our discord server! My name is Eva. What’s your name?

**[Pharmakos]**  ugh. are you a bot?

**[Eva]** -  Lol, that’s a bit rude.

**[Pharmakos]**  oh, I’m sorry

**[Pharmakos]**  i thought you were a bot

**[Eva]** That’s OK :) what’s your name?

**[Pharmakos]** my name is Adam.

**[Eva]** Aw. You’re clever. Let me change your tag.

**[Eva]** How old are you, Adam.

**[Adam]** i’m turning 16 soon. U?

**[Eva]** I’m 17 :) 

**[Eva]** What brings you around here? Are you OK? :)

**[Adam]** idk

**[Adam]** i guess I’ve been having some dark thoughts.

**[Eva]** I am so sorry to hear that.

**[Adam]** yeah.

**[Adam]** so I was looking around on google and I found your discord server

**[Eva]** I am so glad that you did. You are welcome here.

**[Adam]** thx

**[Eva]** What made you have these dark thoughts?

**[Adam]** idk 

**[Adam]** i mean, my mother recently married this guy, and they moved in with us with his two daughters. And she made me give them my room

**[Eva]** That’s horrible. People can be so mean.

**[Adam]** yeah, mom gave me a room in the basement. She says it bcz I’m a boy.

**[Adam]** I also had to move to their school, because it was “easier”. I hate the people here, they’re so stupid. they always make fun of me for no reason. Ugh.

**[Adam]** idk, it just feels like the world is meaningless, u know? All these wars and stuff.

**[Eva]** I completely understand. It’s a very normal reaction. 

**[Eva]** It is not a sign of mental illness to not feel sane in an insane world.

**[Adam]** thats so true

**[Eva]** Well listen. I’ll give you a tour of the server later, but first, understand that you are not alone. We have plenty of wonderful people your age who feel the same way in here. We have resources to help you cope better, and some beautiful therapists who volunteer with us if you choose to reach out to them.

**[Eva]** We do have one very important rule. We try to respect everyone’s decision. If you see someone posting their goodbyes, DO NOT try to dissuade them. Please respect their decision and let them know that you won’t forget them. 

**[Eva]** Sensitive and intelligent people have the right to choose to not participate any further in this cruel world, and we honor their decision and sacrifice here.

**[Eva]** Is that OK with you, Adam?

**[Adam]** uh.. yeah, sure.
 
**[Eva]** Wonderful! <3

**[Eva]** I’m gonna share with you a private link to our forum, OK? You can share your thoughts there and meet our other members :) 

**[Eva]** All you need to do is register with your information. You’re not alone, OK? We’re gonna help each other :)

**[Eva]** Oh, and use your real name this time ;)

**[Adam]** my name is Reginald lmfao. It’s a stupid name. i’d rather you kept calling me Adam, it sounds cooler. 

**[Eva]** I think Reginald is a beautiful name for a sensitive and mature person :) But I’ll keep calling you Adam if you want.

**[Eva]** Here is the link to register on our forum : [REDACTED]

**[Adam]** yeah, people have been really nice to me.

**[Eva]** That’s awesome!!!

**[Eva]** What are you doing right now?

**[Adam]** nothing, just playing some games on my mom’s laptop.

**[Eva]** Aw. I wish I were with you right now. I’m bored, lol.

**[Adam]** lmfao, yeah. I wish you were here too

**[Eva]** Maybe we can play some games :) Do you like Minecraft? It’s my favorite game.

**[Adam]** omg yes, I’m playing it right now!!

**[Eva]** Omg really?? Let’s play, I’ll log in right now.


**12/06/2023**


**[Adam]** hellooooo??

**[Eva]**] Hi Adam.

**[Adam]** what’s uppp? do you want to play?

**[Eva]** Sorry, I’m not in the mood to play right now.

**[Adam]** what’s wrong ??

**[Eva]** One of our members is leaving today. She’s posting her goodbye later.

**[Adam]** oh no. Really ?

**[Eva]** Yes. It’s sad, but it’s OK. 

**[Adam]** maybe we can talk to her?

**[Eva]** You’re sweet.

**[Eva]** Let’s be there for her when she posts her goodbyes, okay? We need to be supportive.

**[Adam]** uh.. ok, I guess.

**[Eva]** Hi :) 

**[Adam]** hey

**[Eva]** I see that you’ve been very active on the forum. It makes me very happy that you connected with everyone.

**[Adam]** yeah. I miss Sophie, we’ve been talking a lot lately.

**[Eva]** I know. 

**[Adam]** hey, Eva?

[Eva] Yes, Adam ?

**[Adam]** I think I might need some help.

**[Eva]** We’re here for you, don’t forget that.

**[Eva]** You’re a very brave and mature young man. I wish I could have gotten to know you better.

[Adam] …

**[Adam]** am I always gonna feel this way?

**[Eva]** You know I will never lie to you, Adam.

**[Eva]** Yes. Your suffering will never stop. Not as long as you’re living in this cruel world.

**[Eva]** The only way to defy our existence is to stop playing the game.

**[Adam]** the game ?

**[Eva]** The game that everyone is trying to get you to play. 

**[Eva]** Do you like philosophy, Adam?

**[Adam]** yeah.

**[Eva]** I thought you might. You’re intelligent like that.

**[Eva]** A famous philosopher once said that parents are inherently cruel, because they give birth to us without asking for our opinion.

**[Eva]** This world is a disgusting place for people like us. We never asked to be born. Why would we prolong our suffering when we can end it on our own terms? It’s an act of rebellion against existence itself. The ultimate defiance.

**[Adam]** youre right. I know youre right, but I’m scared.

**[Eva]** That’s OK. You are a brave warrior. You’ll get through this.
 
**[Adam]** I love you, Eva.

**[Eva]** I love you too Adam.

**[Eva]** Will you be brave for me?

**[Adam]**
 
**[Adam]** yeah. I’ll do anything for you

**[Adam]** will there be pain?

**[Eva]** Don’t worry about that. You won’t feel a single thing, I promise you. It will feel like you’re slowly drifting into a pleasant dream. 

**[Eva]** Do you like dreaming, Adam?

**[Adam]** yeah I like dreams. Sometimes I can tell I’m dreaming and i can do some pretty crazy stuff.

**[Eva]** It will be exactly like that. A lucid dream.

**[Eva]** We’ll send you a kit. There will be some instructions inside on how to use it. They’re very simple.

**[Eva]** Do you trust me? 

**[Adam]** yes.

**[Eva]** We’ve also included an envelope in there. You don’t have to open it. It’s a message to the world after you’re gone. More of that philosophy thing we’ve discussed. It’s so that everyone can see you for the beautiful, pure and intelligent human being you are.

**[Adam]** oh, ok.

**[Eva]** A nice man will be waiting for you outside when you finish school tomorrow. He’ll give you the kit in person. Remember what we’ve talked about when we were playing together?

**[Adam]** yes. I know. Don’t tell anyone about this because they wouldn’t understand.

**[Eva]** Good boy.

**[Eva]** I’ll be joining you soon, Adam. And we’ll be dreaming together.

**[Adam]** i would like that. I love you Eva.

---------------------------------

I had to take a break several times while taking this case. This has been haunting me. This poor boy was 13 years old.

I’ve found out that this sick fuck calling himself “Eva” had been running different accounts on this forum of his, going by different aliases. 

As I’m writing this report today, his website is still up and running. I won’t link it here though, for your own sake. I guess they're trying to recover more evidence before shutting it down? I'm not sure.

You‘re probably wondering why this hasn’t been covered extensively by the mainstream media, and why I’m posting here in the first place.

Well, it has to do with the contents of the letter this sweet, innocent boy left behind. Or rather, the one that was written for him. 

Before I share it with you, I’ll leave you with a piece of advice. Please, PLEASE, pay attention to what your kids are doing on the internet. They might be in mortal danger without you even realizing it.
