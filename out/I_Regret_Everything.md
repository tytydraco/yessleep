Hello, my name is Dave. This is obviously a fake name as I don’t want anyone to find out my real identity. I am writing this from the local country prison. Guilt of having to leave my family and friends has eaten me from the inside. I had plans to kill myself, but I didn’t, as I knew that would hurt my family even more. So, I decided to write this here---perhaps to get this off my mind? I don’t know why, but enough of my rambling, let me begin at the very beginning.  
I had been sitting on my bed late at night. I can remember this part so vividly, as it started the events that led me to this cursed prison. The curtains covered the windows, and the only light in the room was from the screen of my laptop.  
I loved true crime, you see. Hell, I even made a somewhat successful podcast---If you could call six listeners within your small town successful. I even dabbled a little on YouTube, though I never managed to reach more than a few views per video.  
With my laptop, I was looking up about what other killers I could make an episode about. I wanted to create an episode about either my small town or from one of the neighboring ones. It had taken me a while, but I had finally found one. It was about a man named Arthur Wells.   Simon Wells---I will never forget this goddamn name for the rest of my life---was the grandson of Arthur Wells, who was that towns first serial killer. He had killed three people in total before being shot by police. I had thought this would be a goldmine of content, considering I hadn’t seen anyone else cover Arthur Wells. Not to mention, I would be *talking* to the *grandson* of the killer, *and* seeing the property itself, which no one has been to ever since his grandfather’s death! But how wrong I was.  
After some back and forth with Simon, we eventually agreed to meet up next Wednesday, early in the morning hours. He was okay with me recording everything and interviewing him on my tour of the house.  
And when the day came, I was prepared. I had worn a hat, a jacket, and had brought my camera and microphone with me. Both were cheap, but it was all I could afford. I had drove to the next town over to meet with Simon.  
My GPS had brought me deep within the woods, to an old abandoned home. I could remember the excitement nearly bursting from me as I parked my truck on the side of the dirt road. A ways away was Simon’s car, with Simon standing beside it, a smile on his face. He also had on a jacket---though I don’t remember if it was gray or black---and he had gloves on, thick ones.  
Even thinking about this now causes my blood to boil from rage partly from Simon, but also at myself. I should’ve just left! But I was too excited for a new episode to feel anything was off about Simon or the place.  
I could still recall Simon’s pleasant tone as he said, “Hello, I’m Simon Wells. You must be David.”  
Thinking about it now, Simon had been acting weird. He had just seemed a little too eager for me to come and for him to show me property. I wish I had that same feeling back then.  
We had shook hands and from there we began moving up the stone path which lead to the house. The house had looked like it was one bad storm away from blowing down. Vines wrapped around the picket fence with chipped paint that lined either side of the path.  
This was the second thing that Simon said that I remembered: “My sister may be coming over, so I don’t have much time.”  
When we entered the house, I don’t recall ever being so thrilled in my entire life. Actually entering a killers home that no one else has for a long time must be every true crime podcasters dream.  
The inside of the house had reminded me of something from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Everything had chipped paint, part of the steps leading to the second floor were collapsed.  
We went through the house. The kitchen had broken tiles and windows, the living room had a shattered, old television and a torn-up couch directly across from it. The windows in the living room had also been smashed, their curtains lightly blowing in the breeze.  
Now was where shit really hit the fan and why I regret not leaving when I could’ve. I was so stupid.  
I remembered that Simon had a massive smile on his face as he reached into his coat pocket with gloved hands and brought out a kitchen knife. Now, I was bigger and stronger than Simon, who looked like a twig, which meant I could easily overpower him.  
Simon had lunged at me with the knife. I had stumbled, falling back and narrowly missing getting slashed across the chest. I had been so panicked that I barely remember what had happened. All I know was somehow I managed to get the knife from Simon and plunge it deep into his stomach. When he tried to get back up, again, in a panic, I had grabbed the knife and stabbed him in the throat, which was the fatal blow.  
At that moment, the shock had hit me. I had just killed a man. But I was then snapped from my shock of the situation by a blood curdling scream that had erupted from the front door. A women had now stood there, terror on her face, phone in hand, 911 dialed. It had to be Simon’s sister.  
Then the police came. Even though I had been screaming that he’d tried to kill me first, they still arrested me. And after a trial, I had been sentenced to life in prison.  
Now as I said earlier, I sit with my little free time on the computer right now writing this for whoever to see. Fuck, Simon. If it wasn’t for that bastard, I wouldn’t be here right now, my life gone, my family upset and horrified. Fuck that bastard for all he did and fuck myself for even going.
