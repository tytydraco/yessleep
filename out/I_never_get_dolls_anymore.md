So a while back I was a young teen around  13 I loved dolls of any kind one doll I got was a sweet blonde porcelain doll.  I named her Anna and she joined the others but pretty soon weird things started to happen. Like my first night with her  I could hear giggling and a loud smash I was too afraid to see what happened so I went back to sleep. When I woke up the next day one of my other dolls was laying on the ground face smashed I was afraid and upset she was the longest one I had I noticed the other dolls there faces all looked to be sad as Anna stood by the edge of the shelve just with a  soft smile I brought the broken doll to my mother who tried to glue her face back together but to no avail. Then the next night i heard the giggling again but they were softer that the others. 
 

the actual doll the voice was a young girl she spoke to me as if I was a  old friend she said she was like me a young girl.  It's been 5  years  I'm now 18 and afraid of dolls.after that incident I gave the doll to a charity shop without speaking much and as I walked out I noticed a young boy getting the exact same doll I haven't slept for a while after that. I only hope the child will be careful with it.  I still have the smashed doll.  I'm 18 and after a couple months of getting away from it my youngest cousin brought that same doll Anna for a Christmas family sleep over. 

  my cousin told me the name was anna I was afraid and my older cousin came in they told me not to worry they would keep the doll away then laughed before taking there younger sister to bed for the night. I stayed awake for a while on my computer in a group call on discord just laughing and having a  good time. my girlfriend asked me about my fear of dolls I let her know I'm, still not into dolls we continued to play games together for so long I was extremely tired. I ended the call with a love you and she said love you too before I logged off for the night. The next day my little cousin was crying telling me her doll had disappeared I told her not to worry and we would find it 


but she screamed at me for apparently taking her friend when I never touched the doll. My older cousin told me that my younger cousin Lilly was just upset and tired about the night before. After dinner we found the doll outside in the grass my, cousin picked the doll up and hugged it she promised the doll that she would never leave the doll again. That night I started getting ready for bed doing my  hair  brushing my teeth. 


I noticed in my bathroom mirror my cousin staring at me the doll in her right hand and a knife in the other I freaked out as she rushed me but I dodged her I pushed her over and ran to my parents room my heart shaking screaming for them to wake up and call the police my mother called the police while my dad grabbed my cousin. She wouldn't stop flailing the knife around. 

When the police came they took us all two police officers spoke to me and my mum  while another two spoke to my dad and my cousin. 

They removed the doll from my cousin and she started crying saying she was sorry and that Anna told her to do it for me abandoning her all those years ago. 


My cousin is in therapy and I am also in therapy she seems to be doing better now without the doll

I don't know we're the doll went off to but I couldn't care less
