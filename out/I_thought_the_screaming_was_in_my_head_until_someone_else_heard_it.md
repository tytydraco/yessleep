I am new to r/nosleep and writing so sorry if the formatting/grammar is shitty. But I need to get this off of my chest. So a little background, I have lived in Dayton, Ohio my entire life and did not leave until recently for college. I am currently a nursing student at the University of Cincinnati and haven't really thought about this until recently when I started having these horrific dreams. For those who don't know, Dayton is a really strange place and it's honestly pretty run down. After the 2008 crash, a lot of businesses left Dayton which left a ton of buildings to rot. Which made it a hot spot for crime, and also supernatural phenomena. 



A few years ago I lived by this park called Hills and Dales, well it's not really a park it's more of a golf course but you get the idea. Tucked inside the trees there’s this old stone tower that I went to all the time as a kid. I lived in an apartment right by the park and would go late at night with my friends, hanging out by that creepy tower. It goes by many names but the one I always heard was “Frankenstein's Castle” and how it got that name is pretty sad. 



Back in 1967 a girl named Peggy Harmeson died inside when the tower was struck by lightning. After that, they sealed the door with concrete so no one could get into it, however you can still climb into the windows which is what my friends and I would do. It’s said that she still haunts the tower, making it a relatively popular place.



We would sit at the top and try to scare each other. Peggy was said to have died on the 11th step so we would see who could sit on the step the longest without getting scared and running back to the top. I lasted the longest, not caving until a little after the four minute mark which I was pretty proud of. However, there’s one night that has fucked with me for the last 6 years. 



It started off normal, It was Memorial Day and my friends and I met at my house around 9pm and we left to go to the tower. My mom told me to be home by 10pm since there was a big storm on the way. Which I thought was odd since that hardly a lot of time. As we walked to the tower it was raining pretty hard but we didn’t care, and pressed on until we reached the tower. 



One by one we climbed through the window to get into the tower. I was the last in line with my friend Carson in front of me. All of a sudden I heard this otherworldly scream from down in the golf course. I whipped my head around and when I went to ask Carson if he heard the screaming, he was gone. I assumed he went inside with the rest of the group so brushed it off and thought it was just in my head and climbed into the tower. After reaching the top, I realized he wasn’t there. I asked “Where’s Carson?”. They all thought he was with me, but he wasn’t. We peered over the edge to see if he was just hiding to scare us but we couldn’t find him. 



We started shouting his name but the wind was so violent there was no way he would’ve been able to hear us. We start frantically looking for him and shouting his name, with no luck. So, I finally go to call him and that's when I hear it. The tornado sirens. 



We go down the steps into the tower and we are all freaking out even more. We didn’t really know what to do, we were stupid kids who were now stuck in this old haunted ass tower. I get a call from my mom screaming at me to get home, and I tell her that we are stuck in the tower. The tower was a good 20 minute walk from my house, so there was no possible way we would be safe walking back. So she tells me to stay put and wait it out. 



The wind screamed through the cracks of the tower and it felt almost alive. We were all so scared, we didn’t know when it would be over or if we would make it out of this tower. 



We didn’t leave until 2:30 in the morning and Carson was still nowhere to be found. Days went by and I spent a few hours at the police station giving my statement. Then nothing. Carson was never found, and after the incident I never really hung out with those friends again. I never went back to that tower, my mom told me to stay away and we ended up moving a few months after that. 



As the years went by It never really crossed my mind until earlier this year when I started dating my current girlfriend. She lived in the same area I used to live in and one day we walked to the golf course to smoke. I hadn’t been there since Carson went missing and walking there brought all those memories back. 



Once we got to the spot she usually goes to, she started packing the bowl she brought. She looked at me, noticing something was wrong. I didn’t tell her about that night, I realize now that I’ve never actually talked about it. She asked, 



“What’s wrong?” 



I told her it was nothing and she handed me the bowl. As I went to light it, my whole body stiffened and my skin was covered in goosebumps. That same inhuman scream I heard all those years ago, echoed through the entire golf course. I dropped the bowl and it shattered, spilling the $10 of weed I had left. I turned to look at my girlfriend and she was pale, staring at me with a look I can’t even describe. 



“What the fuck was that?” 



She asked in the most haunting tone I have ever heard. I told her, 



“We have to go. Now.” 



I take her hand and we start running towards her apartment. Then I hear an all too familiar sound, 



“Zaaach, stop hiding asshole, you aren’t scaring us” 



The sound bellowed through the hilly field and I knew what was happening. It was coming from the same direction as the tower. We sprint back to her apartment and I lock the door behind us. Once we got to her room I told her everything, Carson, the tornado, the screams, everything.  



5 kids went to that tower, and only 4 came back. Zach was never seen again, just like Carson. My girlfriend and I haven’t gone back and now that I’m in college I honestly don't know If I ever would, until 2 weeks ago. 



I started having these dreams where I'm at the golf course and I hear that same scream. I walk towards the tower and the closer I get, an overwhelming metallic taste fills my mouth. When I reach the tower, I can smell the stench of death and then I see it. Standing on top is this creature, standing almost 10 feet tall, its skin looks to be melting off, dripping on the ground by my feet. It has impossibly long arms and it’s completely naked. As I stand there frozen, it drops from the top of the tower and slams on the ground. 



Its bones crunch as it stands up, its mangled body snapping back into place as more of its skin falls off. As I stare at the creature, it turns to me and I see that it has no face. That thing walks towards me, its arms perfectly still as even more skin falls to the ground with every step. Its rotted muscle now visible. 



As I run down towards my girlfriend's house, the creature breaks into a sprint. The running is unearthly, the pacing of each step is off and its strides are unusually long.  Before it has time to catch me I wake up covered in sweat. 



I am currently on winter break and after having those dreams I want to go back. I need to know what happened to Carson, to Zach. Was it that creature or is it more. I will update you on what I can find.
