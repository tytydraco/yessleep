A numbing flame rolled up through my joints as I sat there grunting on the floor, my arms braced beneath me to hold myself up. My jaw was clenched as small grunts of pain and pressure slipped past my lips. Sweat dripped from my brow and splashed to the mats beneath me, sometimes running into my eyes and making them sting. I shut them tightly to block it out and tried to focus.

“C’mon, Hen, you got this,” Trevor urged beside me, “Keep pushing, only ten more seconds.”

I did my best to hold out, but as I began counting off the ticks in my head, around five, it all became too much. 5 more seconds seemed impossible, and with my goal so close, my body figured what I’d done was more than enough. My limbs gave out on me, collapsing my chest to the mats and putting my face into the puddle I’d created. That numbing fire that my active muscles had been suppressing finally sprang to life at their release, and searing pain carved through them while I struggled to recover.

Finally, restoring enough energy to roll onto my back, I looked up at Trevor and shook my head, “This… is… bullshit…”

The boy just smugly laughed, but still gave me a pitying look, “I know, it sucks. You absolutely killed it, though.”

“No, I didn’t. I didn’t even make it the whole time.”

“There’s nothing wrong with that. You gave it your full effort, that’s what matters.”

“Gee, thanks coach.”

“I mean it,” Trevor told me, extending a hand to help me sit up, “If you went the whole timer but were only doing half-hearted push-ups, your body will get less out of that then if you’re working everything one hundred percent.”

“This is so dumb. Why do you do this?” I barked out, my self frustration boiling over into unfair words.

Trevor knew me enough by now to know this was the case, and he just smiled, “You gotta take care of your body. It’ll thank you when you’re older. Besides, weren’t *you* the one that told me you wanted to start coming with me to the gym?”

“Yeah, cause I wanted to put on muscle; I’m sick of being so skinny. *This* is taking care of your body, though?” I huffed, “Beating the crap out of it? I swear, Trev, I’ve felt worse since we started doing this than I ever did. My joints are killing me—I’m aching all over.”

Trevor once again gave a slight chuckle, but it melted fast into an inquisitive look. He pursed his lips then furrowed his brow, “Hen, I think something might be wrong if that’s the case. Your form is great, so it’s not that, and you’ve been complaining about that a lot lately.”

“No, I’m fine,” I dismissed, realizing I’d just brought on a lecture. Trying to escape it, I added, “I’m just being grumpy—I feel fine.”

It didn’t work, and he pressed on, “Have you gone to the doctor at all? You said you would think about it.”

“I don’t need to, Trevor. I just told you, I’m fine.”

“Hensley, your body should not be hurting like that. If there’s something going on with it then—”

“I do not need a doctor,” I said a little more intense than I meant to. I should have toned it back then and there, but the ball was rolling now, “There’s no point in doing it. I don’t have health insurance, and even if I did, all doctors do is say they can help, slap a bandaid on the problem, then send you home thousands in debt anyway. I’m sure it’s just my diet or something. I’m constantly lifting and bending over at work, too; I’m probably just messing something up that way.”

I could see that Trevor didn’t buy a single word I’d just said, but he didn’t press the issue. Like I said, he unfortunately knew me by now, and given that he didn’t leave my sorry ass, he knew how easy it was for my raised voice to turn into a full blow lash out. Feeling guilty, I skirted my eyes to the floor and took a deep breath, a pulse of pain coursing through my aching joints.

“Well, should we get back to it?” I said.

“Sure,” Trevor smiled, “We only got a few more sets to go.”

“Yippee…” I grumbled.

He laughed, then reached out, brushing a strand of hair from my eyes that had broken out of its hair-tie prison. The soft affection made my skin tingle, and for a moment, chased the pain beneath my flesh away.

“Can I make a suggestion?” he told me.

“Depends. Does it have to do with the doctor thing?” I scowled.

“No, don’t worry,” Trev chuckled, “It’s about working out. Just try to pace yourself, okay? The kind of conditioning we’re doing is a marathon, not a sprint. Be slow, be controlled, and space your reps out to fill the whole time. Don’t burn yourself out before you need your energy the most.”

I didn’t respond verbally. Just nodded and turned to my puddle of sweat on the floor.

“It’s a mental game just as much as physical,” Trevor continued, “Your brain is going to tell you that you can’t, and that you don’t have the energy, but don’t listen to it. Keep pushing through, and you’ll be shocked at how much longer you can run for.”

I nodded, then smirked at him, “Alright, are you gonna keep yapping your little motivational speeches, or are we gonna finish working out?”

“Oh, really?” Trevor laughed in rebuttal, “That’s how it’s gonna be? Alright, sassy pants,” he said, leaning in and kissing the side of my head before snapping into push-up position, “Change of plans. I’m going to smoke your grumpy little ass around the table.”

“Good luck. I know your secrets now.”

Trevor laughed again, then started his phone timer. It counted down from three, both of us set for action, then it began.

*Mental. It was all just a mental game*.

That was the mantra I kept repeating in my head as June and Hope hauled another ladder up to Ann and I.

My muscles ached, and my palms were slick with sweat as they clasped the cold aluminum of the rungs. The short break I’d gotten while Ann and I hung on our last bolted set of stairs came to an end when the girls below reached the top, passing the top of the next ladder into our palms. Ann and I locked eyes in silent preparation, then grunted in unison as we began to lift.

The process of scaling the cliffs was grueling, but I had to give it to her; Ann was right. Her idea was working. At least, so far. We were only 3 ladders up and it was coming together, but each one past the first had been a nightmare to set up. I was wrong in my original guess. It was taking a lot more than five ladders to reach the catwalk.

The process went like this.

From the hardware store, we got what we needed. The stone wall anchors, over 80 feet worth of ladders, some rope, a couple of carabiners, and a whole lot of mounting clamps. Unpacking every power tool in the place along with several batteries, we finally found a couple that weren’t corroded enough to have died along with the rest of their family. Using those, we grabbed a power saw and hammer drill, then got to work.

Like I said, the start was easy. All we needed to do was drill our anchor points, line the ladder up, then clamp it into place. From the ground, this was a breeze because we could simply use a second ladder to climb the height we needed, get the wall ready, then bolt the whole thing in at once. Past that, though, I’m sure you can imagine the problem.

If you’ve ever worked on ladders before, you know that at the top, you already don’t have as much stability as you do on solid ground, and that goes double for a ladder pressed against a wall, as you can’t lean a bit in the opposite direction to counter balance yourself. You have to lean away from the wall. Combine this with having to lift another ten to fifteen feet of ladder above your head, then get it to stay there while you mount it, and you have a virtually impossible challenge. If you’ve ever done the thing where you hold your palm flat and try to keep a stick balanced straight vertical, imagine that but with a 50 pound plank of metal.

So we had to tweak the original scope a bit.

Most modern ladders are technically two combined into one, situated up against each other on a rail. Once you get it set up on the ground, you simply lift and slide the second ladder to the top of the first where it locks in and boom, you have a ladder double the height of the first. Since we couldn’t really do this up in the air, and since problem one still stood to prevent us from using this feature reliably, we detached the two parts from one another, making each ladder much lighter on its own, and a mile easier to move around.

From there the problem was still size. Even when we were able to get a ladder to the top, we could only bolt the bottom half of it. It would be too risky to scale up from there to affix the higher part without worrying that the steps would fall away with us on it. That meant that it would be easier to move shorter pieces up, allowing us to get more clamps and supports on them without the instability. Hope, our self-appointed (and very underqualified) OSHA guide for this project, had the idea to saw the cheap aluminum rungs into more manageable sections.

“We need to be safe about this,” she said, “Getting up there doesn’t matter if we die in the process anyway.”

“Hope, that’s going to take us days—maybe even weeks to do all that shit. Cutting through just one of these would take nearly an hour with the tools we have to work with.”

“Can *you* lift a ladder fully over your head, straight up and down right now, Ann?” Hope crossed her arms, “What about doing that while balanced on a foot long stick of metal?”

My jaded clone opened her mouth to respond, a frustraded look on her face, but she knew she was had. With a noise of defeated annoyance, she looked at the ladders we had piled on the ground and scowled. The best she could do was change her angle.

“We all agreed to the risk of this. If something happens, then… well, I hate to say it, but it’s what we signed up for.”

I could tell by Hope’s face that she didn’t like that response. She was still butting heads with Ann over me and the whole house debacle, and that sentence didn’t really help Hope view the version of myself as a solid team player. Still, she explained, “Ann, if even one of us goes down while trying to get up there, that’s it. We’re done, and this idea gets shut down. We need four sets of hands *minimum* to make this work, and if we don’t have that, then we don’t get up to that rig.”

“Yeah, yeah, I get it,” Ann hissed, whipping her head back to Hope, “But you know I have a point too. We’re running out of time, and this is going to burn through a lot of it.”

“Well…” Hope said with a shaky breath. I could sense the fear from her in that she knew Ann was right, “That’s just a risk we’re also all going to have to sign up for too.”

*Pace yourself. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.*

A marathon where a monster is chasing right behind us.

*Don’t burn yourself out before you need your energy the most…*

Ann had been right again about the time part. Prep was long and intensive. Moving everything back and forth, stopping to cut more parts, or to make a run to the store for a part we needed. The cliff face was as smooth as one could be, but it was still uneven, meaning each panel we put up was on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes our clamps wouldn’t reach from where we had to put the anchor, and we needed to jerry rig something together to get it to stick.

Sometimes it’d take a quick minute. Other times, entire hours.

The worst part was all the noise we made. Before our power saw gave out and we needed to switch to a bone saw (something that added more time, by the way) we cut our ladders in the tunnels so the noise wouldn’t reach the surface. the real problem was the drill, however. Normally its whir as it bore into the stone wouldn’t have been too terrible, but the abyss was dead silent, and so its song was practically a dinner bell for anything scampering by beneath or above that had the means to climb.

A few times we got interrupted, leaving Ann and I to scurry back down, and when the beasts came to investigate, they would only pile more time onto our meter by skulking around town.

And that scurrying down part? It wasn’t easy. To make things go faster, our system was that Ann and I stayed at the top, most recent part of our wall rail, and June and Hope would run our pieces up to us. Since Ann and I had to do the most movement up on the ladders—applying pressure into the stone with the drill, wrenching the anchors into the wall, and getting the panels into place—we needed to be tethered in safely. This was achieved with the carabiners and rope that we had, which we would slowly move up the rungs as we went.

The problem was, if the tower light kicked on, and we needed to make a hasty escape, we had to unhook, make sure our tools weren’t going to fall and shatter on the asphalt below on the way down, then climb down our rickety rig slow enough so that we wouldn’t do the same. Pair this with the fact that we needed to have our flashlight on while we worked, and anything coming up from below would see us against the wall like a neon sign for a juicy steakhouse.

There were several close calls for sure. But thankfully, we never messed up beyond recovery.

*Slow and controlled.*

That was the way. Not too fast to mess up, but with enough precision to get done what we needed to.

The higher we got, the more heart pounding each climb became. I said a second ago that our rig was rickety, and that might be an understatement. Some anchors didn’t quite take right, and so the ladders would rattle or shift as we climbed. Hope and June would try to avoid as many steps as they could on these parts. There were also spots at the uneven portions of the wall where you could barely slip your fingers around the rung and could only purchase your fingertips on it. We tried to avoid these too, but during those mad scrambles down to get back to safety that I was just talking about, it was easy to forget and nearly fall when grabbing one.

That was the other part that was terrifying. The fall. With all the other horrifying things here that could kill us, you’d think that fear of heights would have fallen to the back burner, but as somebody who never had that phobia to begin with, let me tell you, there is no remedy for staring down a 50 foot drop to hard concrete. The sinking feeling I got in my gut each time a ladder shifted or slipped, and I thought I was certainly about to meet my end was enough to nearly give me a heart attack. Wouldn’t that be funny? Of all the things to die to here, I lose myself to a heart attack?

I suppose it would be no more ironic than falling to my death, though. I found myself wondering which is more unpleasant, the sting of your heart stopping, or the violent punch of your head splitting open on the ground. I guess either are probably better than whatever the creatures out here will do to us if we get caught.

That part was the most paralyzing of the whole climb. In the silence, when Ann and I would get our next piece bolted in and wait for Hope and June to bring us another, I’d sometimes find myself looking out over the abyss. It was more imposing up there, high above the town. Down there, it somehow doesn’t feel so big next to the buildings and towering mountain behind us, but on the wall? Seeing how tiny the shelf really is against the shadowy backdrop of wherever we are? It was spine chilling. It was stomach churning. It was so impossibly unfathomable that such a place could exist that I couldn’t even process what I was looking at.

Where was this place relative to earth? We knew now that it was ‘a plane apart from ours’ but what the hell did *that* even mean? How did Kingfisher find it? Did they create it somehow? No, that wasn’t possible. Shae had said he was looking for someone. Some*thing*, more likely. A woman. A being so grand that Shae believed she could somehow make everything right.

‘No more pain and suffering,’ he had said.

Then, on the same coin, there was that beast. ‘*Il-Belliegħa’.* The creature that could hear through the roots that I was connected to. One so powerful that even Kingfisher with all of its technologies couldn’t stop.

Shae hadn’t seemed to know about it or have been expecting it when it showed up. Honestly, I didn’t understand how. Not in the sense that he should have known that creature in specific was coming, but it was obvious that something else had to be out there. If there’s something benevolent in this place—something that’s good and can fix the wrongs of our world—it must be far from here; deep, deep down, like Shae said.

Because up there on that ladder, looking out into the abyss, it's obvious that nothing good can come from here. That vantablack that pierces through your soul the longer you look at it is an entity in itself. The abyss really does stare back, and its gaze is a powerful one.

Every moment I look into it, I can feel it. All the things that it holds and has lurking in its guts. I don’t know what they are—I can’t see them, but it’s a feeling one can’t shake. Like that feeling you get when you know you’re being watched. Maybe it has something to do with my link to it, but I don’t believe that it is. Hope feels it too. Ann does even if she doesn’t like to admit it. June is so afraid of it she won’t even cast a glance out to sea.

If Shae was in this place and didn’t expect something like the one that killed his team to come crawling out of the darkness, then he’s an absolute fool, no matter how smart he was to tear through dimensions to get here.

“Hensley.” Ann plainly demanded, snapping me back to reality. I turned from the endless ocean to face her, and she nodded downward impatiently. I followed the motion to see Hope grunting beneath me, holding a ladder panel and waiting for me to take it. I apologized to her and did so, then Ann and I got back to work.

Maybe it wasn’t fair of me to judge Shae for not knowing what might be laying in this place, especially if he had a light at the end of his tunnel drawing him to it. None of us even knew what to make of it.

When Ann and Hope returned from checking the compound door down in the tunnel, they reported that it too, like the door above, had a keypad code. Apparently, being the main base and gateway back to our world, they really wanted to make sure that nothing made it through. Considering the vague sentience from some of the beasts we’d seen here, it wasn’t hard to theorize that if one was able to get its hands on a keycard, it would be able to clamber its way inside. A keypad made sense under those circumstances, no matter how inconvenient it was for us.

That news fell quite a bit to the back burner under our new revelations, however.

Once Ann and Hope had finished reading the logs while June and I sat watching, they each just stared blankly at the screen in silence. After a while, Hope spoke first.

“What a monster… He left them… all those people he was responsible for, he just left them behind.”

“It’s worse than that,” Ann snickered darkly, “He *used* them. Literally.”

A dark chill ran through the air.

“How could you even stoop so low? After dragging innocent people here, how could you possibly do that to them when things go south?”

“Innocent might not be the best nomenclature,” I chimed in, nodding to the laptop, “Shae said that nobody knew what the filters really were, but he didn’t say that about the ‘tributes’ they were abducting. Whether they knew they were doing more killing than they thought, it seems like everyone was more than complicit in letting people wander in here to be an experiment in their little test.”

“Great, so everyone was shit,” Ann grunted, “That makes me feel better about the fact that our souls might be stitched to theirs when that thing comes back and eats us.”

“It’s not going to come to that, Ann,” Hope reassured.

My 3^(rd) clone threw her head back and let out a loud mocking laugh, “Hope, your optimism was cute at first, but let’s give it a rest, okay? Did you just read the same thing I did? This is fucked. We’re all fucked.”

“No, we aren’t! What in there gave you the impression that we can’t get out of here? Those people we’re throw—er—*depositing* into the bin still have imprint on them; enough to get us home if we get them all. It can’t be long before the next rig shows up, and we always have your plan to get us to the top of the cliff.”

“Oh screw off—you hated that plan.”

“Not anymore. Not when we’re out of options.”

“Okay, but if all that doesn’t work, Hope? You going to hook me up to one of those machines to get out? Use me as a filter?” Ann shot a glance to me, “Maybe that’s why you’ve been hacking us up, Hen; this place knew that you needed some fresh bodies for it to wring some more juice out of.”

“Ann, cool it,” I snapped.

“Sure, I’ll cool it. We’ll all ‘cool it’ because even if we get all those bodies and fill that stupid meter, we’re stuck here! The drill is behind those doors, and we’re not getting in.”

“Yes we will,” Hope insisted, turning to June and I, “Did you two look anywhere else on the computer? He had his password written down; he must have done the same with the keyco—”

“He didn’t.” Ann cut back in, cutting her off. Hope let out an annoyed sigh and turned back to her, allowing her to continue for now. “We asked that last scientist for a code and they gave us one. That code didn’t work.”

“They were probably delirious.”

“No, Hope, they wouldn’t have forgotten. Not when they were clinging on for dear life, and we were offering that as their only escape.” Harshly spinning the laptop around, Ann jammed her finger to the screen, “Shae didn’t want anyone getting out of here alive to tell about his shitty crimes, and the man ran this whole operation. Hensley, you found a note at the door from somebody addressing it to Shae. Why would they leave it out there? If they could get into the complex, why not leave it inside? Why wait in the tower for that thing to come back?”

“What are you saying?” I barked, wanting for her to get to the point so that I didn’t have to hear my own pissy voice screeching any more.

“You two seriously haven’t put it together?” the girl scoffed, “Jeeze, I’m going to be the only one smart enough to get out of here, huh? He changed the password. Once he got what he needed from the rigs, he lured the last people on his team alive to the tower, then he changed the damn door code. He would have had the clearance to do it, and he had a motive to. If someone on this side still wanted to find a way out, that’d be a sure fire way to make sure nobody ever does. He wouldn’t have written that shit down anywhere because why would he have? He was already on his way out.”

It felt like the world was falling away as Ann’s words landed on me. Part of me wanted to dismiss the idea and blame it on her steadfast pessimism, but I knew that she was right. The pieces added up too flawlessly. The only way out of this place was through that door, and if the only code was a random sequence of numbers that Shae probably slammed into a keyboard at random, then…

Well, there wasn’t much hope for us.

“T-There has to be another way, right?” June finally chimed in, her voice shaky and small, “They would have had to have made a backup entrance or exit to get in there in case the power went out.”

 “June, the only way in or out of this entire dimension takes power. Why the fuck would it matter if they had a way in or out of the compound at that point?”

June recoiled into herself, clearly regretting breaking her silence and choosing instead to fold back into it.

“Ann, knock it off!” Hope said, stepping forward, “Maybe you’re right, but quit making things worse by being a jerk!”

“Oh yea, cause your happy-go-lucky pep is going to help us so much more when our bones are being snapped and chomped down like baby carrots.”

“Well maybe there is another way!” Hope hissed, making me genuinely flinch with her sudden volume raise. So far, I’d never seen Hope even make an annoyed expression, let alone get a terse tone. “If there’s a door down here and an elevator to the top of the cliff, then there’s gotta be a door up there too! Maybe the codes run separate from one another. If Shae only changed the code down here, then we might still be able to breech the one topside!”

Ann seemed just as shocked as me at Hope’s sudden break, but she was all of my angry parts, and I’ve never been one to handle confrontation well in a fight, “Okay, and what happens when we get up there and it still doesn’t work? Then what?”

“I don’t know! We’ll figure it out! We have this far!”

“Oh, have we? Cause to me, we’re drowning beneath ice! We can swim around all we want under the water, but we can’t break through to come up for air!”

“God, would you make up your mind!?” Hope screamed, “Are you for getting out of here, or against it? One minute you’re gun-ho to find a way out, and then at the *slightest* inconvenience, you call hopelessness and try to drag everyone down with you! It’s the exact reason why we blew up on Trevor to begin with and why we ended up on the road in the first place!”

I could tell that Hope regretted saying that the moment it came out, but it was too late to put the toothpaste back in the tube.

“*Excuse me?*” Ann seethed, her words slicing through the air like cold steel. “No. No—in case you forgot, I didn’t exist when that all happened; that was *her*.” she continued, stabbing a finger at me.

Ann was technically right again, and it hurt. It hurt that Hope acknowledged it too at least indirectly. They may have come from me, but I was myself before they splintered off. It was my decision to say what I said that night I left. Still, the conversation being had wasn’t helping anything, so I just tried to brush it off like I had done to begin with.

“Hey, whoa, let’s take a step back and—”

Clearly, even though I was a subject in the conversation, I wasn’t a part of it. Ann cut me off and continued addressing Hope, “I would have *never* thrown the tantrum that she did that night.”

“Bullshit!” Hope declared, once again making me wince. That was the first time I think I’d heard her swear. “Who do you think that was inside of her saying those things?”

“Oh whatever, Hope! This isn’t some cartoon! It’s not like we were split personalities when we were inside of her! Hensley was Hensley, and she made those calls all on her own. If it was me living our life back home, shit would be getting done!”

I tried to cut in again, “Alright, guys, that’s enough—”

This time, it was Hope that plowed over me, “Oh, you think?” she asked with a snicker, “Is that why you almost left her to die back at the house? So you could step up to bat when we get home?”

Ann came to a complete stop, then clenched her fist. The air around us went ice cold, and June shrunk away behind a desk to avoid the oncoming explosion.

“Yeah?” Ann growled, “And what does *that* mean?”

“Hope,” I pleaded, “It is *fine*; ease off.”

“No, hang on, Hen, I want to hear what little miss perfect would have done back at that house,” Ann scowled crossing her arms, “We went into there to get the body out—that’s what I did. I saw that thing grab her, then yank her through the floor; what chance did I think she had after that? I go to save her, I get killed too, that thing takes the body back, then you and June are fucked. Everyone loses. So tell me, Hope, what did I do that was so out of line?”

I attempted again to diffuse, “nothing; you’re right Ann, now just drop it—"

“You already know what I would have done because I ran in and *did* it, Ann,” Hope spat. “Each one of us matters; we’re all the same person. I know we think differently, but we all came from one mind. If we lose even one of us, we lose a part of ourselves, and I don’t think that can spell anything good for us when we make it back home.”

Ann snorted, “No, Hope, *survival* matters. We all got roped into this raft together against our will; all that’s important is that we keep it afloat long enough for one of us to make it home to Dad and Trevor. And that may sound harsh, but realistically, they aren’t going to want four of us. They only need one that’s close enough to replace the one they lost. Besides, one Hensley was more than enough even before all this shit. You’re the only one who actually gives a damn about our lives, and that includes your own.”

The look of anger in Hope's eyes was genuinely scaring me. Either the pressure of our escape route being barred off had broken her, or she’d finally just had enough of my worse half’s shit.

 “Okay, Ann, then let’s look at this your way. This place clearly morphs and builds on aspects of the people who inhabit it. It can fabricate entire physical memories out of thin air that disappear the moment we pull the plug on them. What do you think might happen to me or you, or *June* if the core that we came from suddenly gets shut down?”

Ann snickered again, but it was less cocky this time, as if she hadn’t considered the idea, “Well, if that’s something we’re worried about, then why is she even coming out with us at all? We may as well just make a cozy little nest for her at the tower that she can sit her ass in and—”

“Shut the fuck up!” I finally shouted, my patience reaching its limit. The girls were loud, but their screaming voices were also mine, and I knew how to use it better than anyone. The two fell hush and turned to me, and I panted a few deep breaths back in before jamming fingers and both of them, “That is *enough*. God, it’s a wonder anyone even keeps our sorry asses around—is that really what we sound like when we yell? It’s ridiculous.”

Hope looked downright ashamed of herself, my snap back finally returning her to her senses, and though Ann still looked upset, she still averted her eyes, my words striking a nerve somewhere in her.

Whipping to Hope first, I spoke a little softer, “You. I know you like to look out for us, Hope, and I appreciate that, but I can make opinions for myself. You have a point about what might happen to you guys when I die, but I do not blame Ann for what she did back at that house.”

Hope looked at me with puppy eyes and an expression like a child that had just been told they were grounded by their parents. She swallowed hard and nodded in understanding. If it hadn’t been my own face, I might have felt even more bad about it than I already did.

Regardless, I turned to Ann next, “And you. Hope is right. Get it together.”

“Oh screw off—” She started to scoff.

“No, zip it,” I said, choking her out with my venomous tone, “If you want to throw in the towel, then that’s fine, but don’t tell us to give up too. Every time we’ve thought we hit a dead end here, we find a way forward. We’ll do it again this time.” With the weight of my frustrations cleared, I shook my head and tossed my hands, “Guys, we *cannot* go insane right now. Not when we’ve already come this far. Hope, you said it at the beginning; we only have ourselves to get through this. Even if we do die, I don’t want to die out here alone… do you?”

My words clearly strummed a chord in all of our hearts. Hope’s eyes watered up, and she leaned against the desk. Ann found one to lean on too, but she just turned her head away with a huff. June turned her head slightly so that she could see around the desk to us once again.

I had been lying when I said I was going on my road trip to clear my head. Sure, part of it was to have time to think, but in reality, it had been a sort of test run. I wanted to see how it would feel to be utterly alone. After my diagnosis, I needed to know what it would be like to die by myself. If it would be easier. If it would hurt less not to see the crying faces of my friends and family. Truth be told, it had. There was something cathartic about being naïve to the happenings back home. Once I got sucked away here, though, and I was faced with what it really means to die alone, I realized I hadn’t considered a very important key.

*I* didn’t want to be alone when I went. I was scared. I was lonely. I felt so lost and confused. All I wanted was to have a warm hand to hold or pair of loving lips to kiss the side of my head. The aftermath of what pain abandoning my loved ones would bring to them became more clear, and I couldn’t believe I’d ever even considered the idea.

Now that it was likely though, the least we could do was prevent that first part, and seeing as I couldn’t have those I cared for in the real world by my side, it seemed we’d all have to settle for the poorest company around.

Ourselves.

Nothing was said for a while, the four of us sitting in our dour little circle and staring at the floor, just trying to think about what to do next. Hope finally broke it by speaking softly.

“I’m sorry, Ann,” she said, “I was upset and just trying to hurt you. I didn’t mean what I said.”

Ann nodded, but didn’t say anything in regards to that apology. She didn’t offer one herself either, but I don’t think the part of me that she was even really knew how. Instead, she spoke her best form of one.

“If we’re going to do my idea to get to the top of the cliff, we’re going to need a lot of stuff.”

After that, our project went mostly smooth. We didn’t talk much to fill the spaces between working, and anything we did say to one another was mainly work related. Sure, the argument had shaken us a bit, but I don’t think it was just that. Our hopelessness was at an all time high, and Ann’s ice analogy had been pretty damn accurate.

If I was wrong, and we couldn’t find a way forward like we usually did, we were going to drown.

Luckily, a small victory came to us as Ann and I sat waiting at the top of the ladder. My heart pounded my chest as I looked down at a scaling Hope, her tiny form growing larger against the pool from the floodlight below. We were so high now that it was dizzying to look down, so I tried to do it as little as I could, but it was hard not to watch our runners when they had no safety to tether them.

When she finally reached us with the next panel, I breathed a sigh of relief and took it happily. Ann and I set to work clamping it in, a process that had become a snail’s crawl at how sketchy things were this high up. Once we were done, Ann slotted her socket wrench into her tool belt, then checked her carabiner before giving the ladder a solid tug. Slowly, she climbed up it, and I watched her from below.

Pointing her flashlight away from the cliff, the catwalk came into view. A sense of vertigo overcame me as I took in the dangling metal steps suspended high over the shelf, and it was made stronger when Ann reached an arm away from the cliff to reach for it. Her palm easily grappled the railing, and all she would need to do is jump to make it.

With a glowing grin, she looked down at me, and I couldn’t help but return it.

Satisfied, we made sure everything was secure to start the descent. As I went, I tossed one last look out to where rig 4 should be, hoping that I would see a new building finally glowing on the horizon. We may have just put in all of this work, but the top of the cliffs were unknown, and we didn’t have any clue what was up there other than the rig. Given that monsters could come from that direction, though, I’d rather delve into the next rig than find out right now. Unfortunately, there was no such luck; it was still only a dark horizon.

We went back down to the tower to regroup and gather our supplies for the journey ahead, but we’re going to head up soon; all together this time. I’m not sure what we’re going to find up there, and I’m not sure if we really can find another way out of this place, but even so, I think we’re all in it for the long haul now, no more reservations.

I don’t think Trevor realized that what he said to me about it all being a mental game was going to apply to a lot more than just working out. What I wouldn’t give to hear him next to me right now, telling me ‘I got this’ and to ‘keep pushing’.

I suppose we have to do that to each other now, though. We’re going to keep clawing at the ice till it either breaks or our nails fall off.

Thank you all as always for sticking with my posts and not giving up on me. I hope I can make it back to update again soon, and that this isn’t my last.
