I’ve always liked to keep things neat.

Not in a weird or obsessive way, just… tidy.

If a picture frame is crooked, I straighten it. If a glass leaves a ring, I wipe it before it dries. I always put things back where they belong, and things *always* have their place.

Order calms me, I guess. Knowing that all things that matter belong, and everything else can go.

I started working for the Nilssons’s two months ago. Live-in housekeeper, after years of being a cleaner at the town medical centre. It’s, comparably, a very privileged position: they travel often due to work, and the children are grown and spend most of their time at school, extracurriculars or with their friends. The house is huge, so there’s a lot to do. Old victorian homes tend to be like that.

Most days it’s just me and my thoughts, surrounded by the things that I am responsible for keeping neat and polished.

I clean, make tea at four, wash up at five, and then read until I’m tired. Simple as that. By the time my day ends, I know exactly where all the little things are, what has been checked off, and what I have to do the next day. It’s predictable and peaceful.

At least until recently, when I found the first thing that was out of place.

I don’t leave things out of place. Of this I am completely certain.

I had washed up as usual, removed every trace of myself from the kitchen and polished the counters until I could see my reflection in the stone. I know I did.

When I later went for a glass of water, there it was: a teaspoon, right on the shiny counter next to the wash bin.

It wasn’t dirty, and I think that’s what bothered me the most. 

*If* I had left it there by mistake, it would have had tea stains on it. But there it sat, spotless and gleaming, as if it had just been brought out of the drawer.

I didn’t think any of these thoughts at the time, of course. Mistakes happen and no one’s perfect. I just gently put it down next to its friends in the drawer, neatly lined, fetched my water, and went to bed.

The next day it was back. Same spot, still clean. 

I picked it up and checked the drawer, counted them. Nine. Ten, with the one on the counter. Again, I put it back, and a sense of unease washed over me. I knew I hadn’t forgotten the damn teaspoon, least of all twice. I was completely certain.

After that, other things began to shift. 

Curtains I had closed in the evening were open before I went up in the morning. The sugar jar turned a quarter inch to the right, its label no longer centred. The kettle would be full of water, even when I had had my final cup of tea the evening before and cleaned it before going to bed.

Nothing was ever *messy*, or missing. Just another type of neat, one that wasn’t mine.

By the end of that week, it was escalating.

I found my cleaning cloths where I had left them the night before, but not folded quite right. Not like I would do it. The bookmark in whatever I had been reading left at the beginning of the chapter I had finished before bed.

The breaking point was when I found the ironing board already set up for the morning. The iron sat on top, cord wrapped the opposite way of how I would do it, but still neat around its handle. The fabric cover still had a remnant of warmth as I ran my hand over it, as though someone had just pressed it smooth.

I hadn’t ironed that day. I was going to, but I hadn’t. I know that.

That’s when I started keeping notes. 

Each night, I’d write down exactly what I had done: Every object moved or folded, every piece of metal polished, every room, every small task. I figured I was probably going crazy, but the thought never sat quite right with me.

I asked the children, of course. Pretty sure they thought I was mad, too.

If I could just *prove* that… I don’t know. That I wasn’t losing it, that I knew what I had done, I’d have my sense of sanity returned to me.

Every morning, though, the list didn’t quite add up. What I had written down for the next day would already be checked, but clumsier than mine. As if a shivering hand, not quite knowing how to hold a pen, had marked it down. Something else would be written down. Sometimes in my handwriting, sometimes not. I did not recognise the little swirls on the S.

So, last night I decided to catch whoever was playing this prank on me in the act. I didn’t understand *why* the family would do this to me, either. I am a good worker. A hard worker. I always go the extra mile.

I decided to stay up. I left the curtains uneven, a used teacup on the counter, one chair in the dining room pushed slightly away from the table. Not messy, not this time either, but distinctly not *as neat*.

I left the notebook in the kitchen, blank page up, pen beside it. Then, I went to my quarters and turned off the lights.

Staying awake was hard. I had still done my duties over the day and my body was sleepy and achy. I am pretty sure I drifted off to sleep several times, propped up in my bed, but never not enough for my brain to rattle me awake every so often.

My eyelids shot open when the red numbers on my alarm clock read right after four in the morning.

The kettle was rattling. I could hear the vintage cord being unwrapped, I know the sound by heart. It wasn’t loud, not really, but it was *deliberate*. Small clicks of metal against stone, a soft rustling as of by fabric as something moved past the cupboards.

I got up, quietly, my heart pounding heavily. *Proof*. I wasn’t crazy at all, there was *definitely* someone in the kitchen. 

I hadn’t decided what to do, yet. I am not big on confrontation, but I figured I would take it as it came. 

The thought that it wasn’t one of the children hadn’t hit me until then, but not it hit me like a train: What if it was some odd kind of burglar? A person who *had wanted* me to feel insane, as a way to later blame me for any theft? 

I grabbed a bookend, shaped like a cat, and quietly pushed my door open.

I crept out the hallway, the cat’s metal ears digging into my palm. The air was still and heavy.

The light from the kitchen spilled faintly into the hallway, making a pale rectangle against the old floorboards. I knew where every creak was, and walked carefully between any weak spots to keep my presence unknown.

There was an outside door in the kitchen. Of course there was. I never used it though, did I? Had I checked if it was locked?

I was still deciding what to do when I saw it through the crack. I froze in my steps. 

A figure stood at the counter, just slightly illuminated by the light. They were wearing *my apron*.

For some reason, that was the straw that broke the camel’s back.

Anger sprawled inside me, and I didn’t think. I just pushed the door open with enough force for it to bang against the wall.

“Who’s there!?” I shouted, raising the bookend above my head.

The figure jerked, sharp and sudden, like a puppet being pulled by its invisible strings.

It *was* wearing my apron. Same knot, same fold across the waist. Under it?

*My uniform*. My own uniform.

Then, it turned around. My brain froze.

The movement wasn’t smooth. Not in a way like when you’ve been caught red handed, but more as if it didn’t know how to move properly. The joins popped, the body turned as if the framerate of the world had been lowered.

There was no face.

Not in a typical sense, anyway. Just a smooth, beige surface, like fabric pulled taut over… something. The shape of that which would be a mouth moved behind the surface, popping it outwards.

“Who’s there?!” It roared, the sound muffled by the fabric.

I dropped the bookend. It clattered on the tiles. 

The thing tilted its head in a sharp twitching motion, the stretched skin where the mouth should be shivered. I opened my mouth to speak.

“Don’t—” it said.

My throat seized. I backed a step. The figure followed. I opened my mouth again, raising my arms in front of me.

“D-don’t come closer!” I said.

“D-don’t come closer!” 

Both our voices were the same pitch. It sounded like an echo.

Then, it laughed. Short, sharp, wrong.

“Don’t come closer,” it repeated. Neater. Tasting the words.

Something finally snapped, and I turned and ran. What else was I to do?

The house was quiet, still, making every noise the more amplified. The creak of the floorboards, under my feet and *its*, my own heartbeat, the drag of bare feet following behind me. I could swear it stepped *before* me, even if that makes no sense.

I hit the short stairs to the quarters, took them two at a time. 

Halfway up, something cold brushed against my ankle.

I screamed, stumbled, nearly fell, but managed to keep running. My arm hit a table on the way up, and I could hear some valuable thing smash to pieces behind me.

Behind, the *thing* was keeping perfect time. Completely even, not frantic nor hurried. Just steady to a perfectly even rhytm.

I slammed my bedroom door and twisted the lock in record time.

It was quiet, for a bit. My heart was racing and my breath was caught in my throat.

Then—SLAM.

The door rattled in its frame.

From the other side, now clear as day, my voice said:

“Oh, my. You sure made a right *mess!*”

Another slam, heavy. Then, the dragging of footsteps. Further away.

It was quiet for a long time, I am not sure how long, until I could hear the brushing of broom bristles and the fragile sound of pieces of glass being swept up.

Then, softly from someplace else, I murmured:

“All things in their place, everything neat.”

It whistled as it worked.

Eventually, everything became silent again. I sat on the floor, staring at the door until morning light broke through the window

When I finally gathered enough courage to move, my legs were stiff and trembling. My eyes felt dry, and I wondered if I had blinked at all for the last two hours.

I turned the lock and opened door, just an inch. The hallway outside was empty. The corridor smelled of polish and hot metal, but just faintly. Clean.

I crept down the stairs, step by step. The kitchen light was still on.

Everything was spotless, just as I would have left it. Maybe better.

I could see the notebook, exactly where I’d left it the night before. Pen rested neatly across the top, perfectly aligned with the page margin.

My heart hammered as I leaned in to read.

At the top, in beautiful cursive: **All things that matter have a place**.

Below it, the list of daily chores. Already, most of them crossed out with neat X’es.

Beside it, folded perfectly and flat, my apron and uniform. I put my hand on them, and the fabric still felt warm.

At the top of the folded pile, a spotless teaspoon sparkled in the morning light.
