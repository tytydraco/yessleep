Going through a breakup is hard. Establishing boundaries is harder. So when my ex, Kyle, asked for some distance after I broke up with him, I understood. He didn’t want to end things, but I knew it was for the best. It hurt, though—after seven years together, we shared a lot of friends and some of our favorite places.

When he DJed at our favorite cocktail bar, he specifically asked me not to come. I was bummed, for sure, because I knew all of our friends would be there. So I sat on my couch, begrudgingly watching Instagram stories of them enjoying themselves when I got a text from Kyle.

Kyle: I thought we agreed that you wouldn’t come tonight.

Me: Yeah, we did.

Kyle: Okay, then why are you here? And you just walked in without saying anything?

Me: What are you talking about?

Kyle: I see you sitting in the corner, texting me right now. Why can’t you respect my boundaries? You know it’s really hard to see you right now.

I was so confused. I sent him a photo of me sitting on my couch, holding up a peace sign and wearing my favorite pajamas.

Kyle: You’re obviously here right now. I think it’s disrespectful and a little strange. You look really bad, Sarah—like you haven’t slept or showered in days. I’ve never seen those clothes before, either. Do you need professional help? I didn’t realize you were taking this so hard, considering you’re the one who broke up with me.

Me: Well, that’s a little insulting—especially because I’m literally sitting at home.

I turned on a movie and watched for an hour before picking up my phone to check Instagram again. My feed was full of clips—friends singing along to the music, boomerangs of cheers with cocktails in hand. Then I came across a video that caught my eye.

In the background, a girl—someone who looked suspiciously like me—sat alone. She wasn’t talking to anyone. Her eyes were wide open, unblinking, as if she was dissociated from the joy surrounding her. Her head was down, fingers poking at a phone screen that was obviously turned off.

That’s when the next text came in.

Kyle: Thanks for coming to talk to me. I really do want to talk about this. I’ll be ready in 10. Meet me out back, like you asked. That’s where my car is anyway. 

Me: I am lost. I have no idea what you're talking about. 

Kyle: Come on, don’t play coy. I’m excited to talk about giving this another chance.

Me: I’m literally at home. I’m not sure who’s there, but it’s certainly not me! 

And that was the last time anyone ever heard from him.

The next morning, they found Kyle dead in his car outside the cocktail bar—with claw marks down his torso and a bite taken from his jugular.

Now, I’m the prime suspect in a murder case.

My only alibi? Some texts and a photo of me sitting on my couch in my favorite pajamas.
