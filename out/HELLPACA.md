I know nobody is going to believe me. Hell, if I hadn’t lived it I wouldn’t believe me either. But I have to tell someone before this thing comes for me again.

When I came back from deployment, I thought farming alpacas would help me heal. I bought a few acres of land outside Fall River put up a barn and started with a small herd. They’re gentle animals. Soft. Curious. Easy to be around. After years of blood and noise I needed that.

For the most part it was working. Until Wooley. 

He was the biggest of them all, a solid black alpaca with eyes that never looked right. Too intelligent. Too steady. While the others hummed or skittishly avoided me, Wooley just… watched. At first I laughed it off. Told myself it was just my nerves. But deep down I knew. There was something wrong about him. 

The first sign was the barn door. 

One night, close to 2 a.m. I woke to a slam that shook the house. I grabbed my flashlight and rifle and headed out, thinking coyotes had gotten in.

The barn smelled wrong like metal and rot. When I swung the light over the pen the other alpacas were huddled into the corner pressed together trembling. My beam stopped on Wooley. 

He was standing upright. On two legs. 

His head nearly brushed the rafters. His front hooves- if you could even call them hooves anymore- hung low at his sides twitching. His eyes glowed pale in the flashlight beam. Mirrored like a predator’s. And then he dropped back down on all fours as if nothing had happened.

I slammed the gate shut and ran. 

After that I couldn’t sleep. Every night I kept watch from the porch with my rifle across my lap. The herd stopped humming completely. It was like Wooley had stolen their voices.

Then came the screams. 

Not animal screams. Human. 

They echoed across the fields starting low like a man groaning in pain then rising into shrieks that made my skin crawl. By the time I got to the barn it was always silent again. And Wooley would be staring at me through the slats his mouth pulled back just enough to show the flat, grinding surfaces of his teeth.

I started padlocking the barn. Didn’t matter. By morning the lock would always be broken.

The night it got inside my house I thought I was done.

I woke to the sound of hooves on the hardwood floor. At first I thought I was dreaming but then the smell hit me- that same metallic, rotting stench from the barn. I grabbed the flashlight, hands shaking and swept it across the room.

Wooley was there. At the foot of my bed. 

He stood tall again, chest heaving, fur slick with something dark and wet. His mouth opened and a torrent of black fluid poured out, hitting the floor and spreading like oil. It moved on its own, creeping toward me, thick and alive.

I fired three shots point-blank into his chest. The sound was deafening in the enclosed room. When the smoke cleared the floor was empty. No alpaca. No body. Just the slick, tar-like stain slowly soaking into the boards. 

I tried to burn the barn the next day. Gasoline, matches, everything. But the flames died as soon as they touched the wood. Like the structure itself refused to burn. The other alpacas were gone. Only Wooley remained, pacing slow circles in the shadows.

I called animal control. The guy on the phone laughed when I told him what I had. He thought I was drunk. 

I don’t know what Wooley is. Demon. Experiment. Some kind of old New England curse. All I know is that he won’t stop. He’s waiting for me to break. To leave the house. 

I can hear him outside right now. His hooves scrape the porch. The boards creak under his weight. Sometimes I see his shadow pass the window tall and thin and wrong.

If I disappear after this don’t believe I just walked away. Don’t believe I sold the farm. 

The alpaca wasn’t normal. 

And he’s still out there.
