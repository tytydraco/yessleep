The darkness settled in and the wind began to howl. I sat in my armchair, drinking my gin with a scowl. The roaring fire crackled and popped, bringing warmth to the cold and bitter November evening. Still I shuddered, even though I did not know about the visitor I would soon be receiving.

Alas, my glass stood empty save for the clink of the ice. On a night such as this, I knew one drink would not suffice. So I stood, steadily supplying myself one more pour, when I heard a knock, a knock at my front door. Still as prey hiding from its predator I stood. Then I stilled my breath for I knew this could not be good.

Who could it be at this hour? My thoughts on this were dour. I set my glass onto the table with an unsteady grip, even though I desperately wanted another sip. Down the hall I went, pictures hanging at my side. Of days long gone by, where I wish I could now hide. 

I opened the door with a loud squeak and a creak. And put on a brave face so I would not look weak. The moon was stationed in the perfect place, to reflect some light on this dreadful place. My eyes gazed straight ahead where someone should be. But there was no one there, no one in front of me.

I stood for a moment, staring at the darkness of the night. Then I closed the door, pausing before returning to the light. Back through the hall I traveled, while my nerves became unraveled. Behind me, something crashed to the ground. I turned and looked where I heard the sound.

A picture lay upon the ground. The glass cover shattered all around. I reached for the photo, slicing my finger on the glass. It hurt at first but I knew the pain would pass.

A drop of blood dripped down onto the scene. Of a better time, before life turned mean. It was a portrait of my younger self with a smile. This was something I had not done for quite a long while. I was posing in a pretty summer dress. It was a happier time, I must confess. 

Another knock echoed through the hall. I steadied myself against the wall. I glanced right back at that photograph. It was like I was looking at a holograph. My mom stood near me with no face. It had disappeared without a trace. Blood streamed down from my bewildered eyes, and I held a knife to my surprise.

The picture flew from my hand like a bird from a snake. This spurred a buried memory I just could not take.  I closed my eyes and breathed in deep and slow, holding it in before letting it go. 

The knocking began to grow in intensity. Although running away was my propensity, I stood there listening to the rhythmic noise. I struggled heavily to regain my poise. Back to the door I went, not sure what to anticipate. It was just a vision, I thought, as my fear began to dissipate. 

Silence overtook the night when I grabbed onto the doorknob. Oh Lord, please take pity on this here poor slob. The door swung open with a mighty force. Like it was kicked in by an angry horse. It knocked me back onto the ground. But I looked outside and no one was around.

Then I felt such a tremendous breeze. It instantly made my blood freeze. Through the hall it went as more pictures came crashing down. A cold chill came over me and I shivered in my nightgown.

With a tightness in my chest, I knew I could not take a rest. So I stood and closed the door. And I hoped the knocking would be no more. One more drink I thought, yes a drink to help me think. So I sauntered silently, sidling back inside my sitting room. Smoke slithered through the air, and it was colder than a forgotten tomb.

Goosebumps sprouted atop my skin. I knew I had let something in. Then I saw the bump above the back of my chair. Even in the dark I could tell someone was sitting there. Sitting there where I had been before. Before I heard the knock, the knock on my front door.

The silence filling the room was suffocating, and I could not keep from hesitating. While I stood, the figure sat motionless. Which filled me up with such great hopelessness. I gathered my nerves and walked through the cold air, keeping my distance from the guest in my chair.

I made my way over to the hearth, still giving the chair a wide berth. Then I turned around to see a ghastly sight in front of me. My hand went to the wall, so I would not crash and fall. This thing had me under its sway. My eyes just would not turn away. 

Thin wisps of gray hair adorned its broken skull. It had no eyes, yet it stared into my soul. A thin dusty cloth hung from its shoulder. I shivered again as the room grew colder. It let out a few gravelly groans and I caught some movement through the gaps in its bones.

I stood silently and still, shrouded in the darkness against my will. Time passed by in silence making my nerves reach their peak. While I stared at this thing waiting for it to speak. But the silence continued to fill the air. I would not break it, no I would not dare.

Finally, I gathered the courage to move, even if this thing would disapprove. Its head followed me as I returned to the table, to get my drink while I was still able. 

With my back turned, I could still feel the icy gaze. I slammed my drink and felt like I was in a daze. Another pour and another drink, and my consciousness began to sink. I closed my eyes tight and took a huge deep breath. Then I heard a noise behind me and was overcome with the smell of death.

A bony hand gripped my shoulder and I felt its fingers pierce through my skin. In my mind I saw its face with a devilish grin. I screamed in pain before falling down onto the floor. It lunged toward me and I became conscious no more.

I awoke on the floor next to some broken glass, and a headache I knew would not soon pass. My body hurt and I felt my shoulder ache. I had a feeling of dread I just could not shake. Then I thought it had to be just a nightmare. But it had given me such a fright there.

I gathered myself up off the thin carpeted floor, and looked at my watch, it was a quarter to four. It was past time to lay myself down for a long rest. I was ready to curl up, like a bird in its warm nest. I looked to my right and saw broken frames and pictures scattered throughout the hall, and a spatter of red all across the wall.

I stumbled to my room and fell on my bed. Horrifying memories filled my headâ€¦of what I had done so long ago. I thought I had buried it far below. Sleep did not come easy, and I began to feel a little queasy. This vision of mine had shaken me right to my core. But then I began to drift off, until I heard a knock, a knock at my front door.
