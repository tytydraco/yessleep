My name is Samantha. I am 26 years old, and just moved into a new house recently. It's pretty decent sized, but due to me finally graduating college and landing a decent paying starting gig, I have been able to afford it fairly comfortably. However, there are some things I didn't realize when I rented it. Whoever had lived here before didn't move some things out, but these things are mostly in the attic. That's the only reason I can understand why they weren't thrown out.  
Of course, a lot of it is junk that I have days sorting through and throwing out. However one find in particular was actually intriguing to me. In the corner of the attic, covered in a sheet was an old analog television. Judging by its worn down appearance, it had to be from the eighties or nineties. Accompanied with it was a VHS player, and a few scattered tapes in a dusty old box. I decided to take the television and tapes downstairs, and see what was on them.  
While the tapes mostly consisted of old movies, a few of them were different. Some of the tapes played what I assume were some family home videos, and even a few film projects by a group of teenagers. I picked up on the names Jack, Nate, and Sarah. Most of the films were pretty bad as you'd expect from some kids who couldn't have been out of high school. However, there was a charm to these short films. After spending the afternoon watching these, I got to the last tape. This one was labeled "10-17-1994".  
I placed the tape into the VHS Player, and it opened up with the group of kids walking through a park. It appeared that Nate was holding the camera, with Sarah and Jack walking in view. As they walked along the trail, they went deeper into the forested area. Eventually, they weren't even on the trail anymore, however Nate was the only one who seemed to be concerned.  
"Are you sure we have to do this?" Nate asked, his voice trembling.  
"Come on, it's just an abandoned building. We are going to record a few scenes, and get out," Sarah said, trying to assure him.  
Jack remained silent, just nodding in agreement. Nate audibly sighed, likely realizing he wasn't going to get out of this easily. After a few more minutes, Jack came to a stop suddenly. He held up his finger to his mouth, and motioned for the others to crouch down.  
At this point Nate seemed to forget he was recording, as his camera was aimed towards the ground. I could still hear them whispering to each other, trying to discern something.  
"J-Jack, what is that?" Sarah asked, her voice now trembling slightly.  
"I think someone else is out here," he responded.  
"Jack… he is… no person could be that tall," Sarah said, clearly trying to keep her composure.  
Nate was starting to breath heavily, still pointing the camera to the ground. Jack and Sarah fell silent for a moment, presumably in fear of alerting whatever it is they were seeing. I couldn't tell whether this was something that they were really seeing, or a part of the movie they were apparently filming. However, if they were acting, it was a lot more believable than the previous tapes I'd seen of them.   
Suddenly I jumped as the camera started to shake, before focusing. Nate had apparently decided to try to get whatever they were seeing on camera. The camera stayed still for a moment, showing a small clearing in the forested area, where there was what seemed to be a strangely thin tree. There was some sort of lighter colored blot near the top of it, but it was hard to make out through the film grain and distortion. As the camera tried to focus on it, the screen tearing began to get more intense. But in a brief moment of clarity, I realized what I was looking at.  
There was no way, this couldn't be real. Maybe they had set up a tall mannequin out there, or a puppet. There's no way a man could be that tall. Whatever it was seemed to stand well over 8 feet, but it was hard to discern without much of a frame of reference in the wooded area. I struggled to figure out what I was looking at.  
Then it moved.  
The white blotch which I now identified as a head, seemed to turn towards the direction of the camera. That's all I was able to see clearly, as immediately the camera became shaky and I heard the scream of who I can only assume was Sarah. This was followed by a shaky camera, Nate presumably running through the wooded area.   
Eventually he stopped and looked up, as the camera focused on what appeared to be an old structure, like some sort of school or hospital building. The building was in a clearing, however some trees and foliage was growing on the far end of it. It really appeared to be lost to time, abandoned in this hellish forest.  
Nate began to walk up to the building, breathing heavily as he got closer to it. His pace quickened and soon he was running, as he got to the door and started pounding on it. The door seemed to be falling off its hinges, and Nate seemed to realize that as well, because his next move was to try to kick it down. After a couple attempts, this worked and he entered the building.  
"Jack?"   
Nate began to call out as he walked through the desolate walls, the building clearly falling apart. It's as if a tornado had run through here. Sections of the wall were completely destroyed, and most of the windows were shattered. He made it to the end of a hallway, then paused. It sounded like shuffling had come from behind him, and his camera quickly darted around. It was Jack, who was holding some sort of pipe. Nate began to walk over to Jack quickly.  
"Jack I'm so glad you ar-"  
Nate's words were cut off as Jack swung the pipe, and the camera fell on its side. From its view of the hallway, it appeared that Jack was standing over Nate. Then he raised the pipe, and yet again swung it down. As I watched, I thought about turning it off. However, it was dark enough where I couldn't make out the details of the violent act. I just sat watching in shock.  
After several more swings, Jack dropped the pipe. He seemed to look over what he had done, his expression blank. Then it was there. Standing behind him. The tall creature, appearing as a man who had been stretched into impossible lengthy proportions. Its head was at the ceiling of the hallway, and its long bony fingers barely hung above the ground. Jack didn't even acknowledge the monster that had blipped into existence behind him. The creature reached its lanky arm towards Nate's corpse, its appendage stretching like a spider limb.  
Then just like that, it was gone. And so was Nate. Jack stood in silence for a moment, before walking over to the camera. He stopped right before it, crouching down to pick it up. Then he faced the camera to himself. His expression was blank, as if nothing remained behind those eyes. Then the corner of his mouth began to curve into a smile. The tape ends there.  
I stared at my television in disbelief. That had to be some sort of strange film project right? But how would kids at that time be able to fake something like that?  
I put away the television and the tapes, and covered it back up. I really didn't want to think about it. I just hoped that what I had seen was some sort of obscure horror film. And I did end up forgetting about it, until yesterday.  
During my morning run yesterday, I saw something unusual. It had been usually foggy, so of course it was hard to tell what I was looking at. But the thing I was seeing stood along the woodline, and its appearance was very familiar. I had assumed that its face was fuzzy, and that I had been unable to discern its features due to the grainy footage of the VHS tapes.  
I never imagined that something without a face could stare.
