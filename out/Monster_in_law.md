"This is my sons wedding!!" 

This became a phrase I heard often. I had just gotten engaged to my beloved Clay. His mother pretended to be excited for us, but she was really only excited for herself. 

Another wedding meant another chance for her to get drunk with all of her friends and attempt to relive her glory days. Honestly, it was pretty sad. 

We had set a date, and everything was going smoothly. We had managed to ignore his mother and were planning the wedding of our dreams. Everything was going perfectly until Thanksgiving. 

Thanksgiving 2021 would become known as 'Intergalactic War I' in our family. My soon to be mother-in-law went completely nuclear. Many plates and many side dishes were injured during this Thanksgiving. "This is my sons wedding!!" she continued to yell as she shredded our guest list. I had foolishly forgotten to invite everyone she has ever spoken to. 

This is when I knew something was wrong. As she tore the guest list her long, crudely painted nails started to grow. They became unnaturally long and pointed. Her mouth started to open, and she was making a shrieking sound. I stared in horror as her teeth turned into long, animalistic fangs. 

While I was frozen in place, I noticed my soon to be husband and his siblings. They were all standing around looking more annoyed than frightened. It was as if this was something they had seen before. "Mom, do we have to do this again?" AGAIN?? I thought to myself. 

In response to her sons question she began lashing at me with her grotesque claws. I had closed my eyes and was prepared to be ripped apart when her daughter stepped in and stopped her. My future sister-in-law had taken on the same grotesque form as her mother. 

I took this as my opportunity to escape. I have never been known for my athleticism, but at this moment I could have out run Usain Bolt. 

Less than an hour after returning to the home I shared with my monster-spawn future husband I heard a knock at the door. "Layla, I'm sorry if I scared you. Let us in." 

I reluctantly went to the door and peaked out. It was the whole family. I figured she couldn't kill me with all of her children present, so I decided to let them in. I owed it to myself to know what was going on. 

I'll spare you all the details, but I learned that my mother-in-law is considered a "mixed breed". Her father was human, but her mother was a succubus. All of a sudden, lots of things made sense. I knew that she was unbearable, entitled, and flat out crazy, but I just assumed that's what happens to old, lonely woman. 

I decided not to let this ruin my relationship. I actually find her much more tolerable now that I know she was literally born to be this soul sucking. My husband and I got married last month and things have been great. We are even talking about starting a family soon. 

I haven't told anyone about my families little secret, but we all get a good laugh in whenever people tell their "monster in law" stories.
