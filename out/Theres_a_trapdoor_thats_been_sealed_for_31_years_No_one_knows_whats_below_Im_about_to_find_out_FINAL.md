The [abandoned house](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ek4kgj/theres_a_trapdoor_no_one_knows_whats_below_it/) sits on a forgotten street in Milwaukee, paint flaking from the siding like dead skin, broken shingles leaving bald patches on the sagging roof.

A putrid stench wafts through the windows. Hidden in the basement of the house is a corpse.

Police have not found it yet, but flies have—multiplying in the eyes of the dead, wriggling through rotting flesh, swarming with frantic activity.

It’s not the first time the house has been buzzing.

In summer of 1948, neighbors complained of a sewage stink. The stink persisted for weeks, until police at last investigated to discover a horrific scene within: bodies leaking into the upholstery; bodies rotting into the bedsheets; bodies staining the hardwood. And in this maelstrom of death, a single survivor.

A male resident of the household named Freddy Wilkins, Jr.

How such a sickly man could have murdered his entire family was baffling, but he was alone, sitting on the stairs with his head in his hands. He kept insisting, “*It’s* still in the house.”

Nobody ever bothered to figure out what “it” was.

The Wilkins house was boarded up.

But 76 years later, Freddy Wilkins is still right.

“It” is in the house.

\*\*\*

Since I’m the one who did the digging into the history of the Milwaukee murder house, it’s up to me, Emma Marie Anderson, to explain how it all ends. But first, a little bit about how it all began…

When my ex texted me out of the blue asking for a favor, it’d been ten weeks since our breakup. Ten weeks since my puppy-eyed con artist dumped me and disappeared, leaving me in the dark as to his fate. And after two months of crying myself to sleep, I finally made peace with the fact that my shooting star, “the one,” was gone from my sky no matter how hard I wished for him. And then suddenly… a text:

HIM: *Hey Babe, it’s Jack. Can I ask a favor…?*

What do you do when the guy you’ve just mourned reaches out for “a favor?” And not just any favor, but a *dangerous* one? The favor: translate an ancient text from Latin and Aramaic and join him at this Milwaukee murder house to release “it” from the basement—a sinister “it” that has taken two teen sisters who were urban exploring. Imagine me, life upended as I see my guy on video call for the first time in weeks, the murder house behind him, all cracked windows and sagging roof and—oh, that piece of shit, he's wearing the heart locket I gave him on our anniversary—never wore it when we were together but now it glints on his neck, as if to say, *“You’re still ‘the one’ to me, Babe.”*

*FUCK OFF*, is what I want to tell him.

But then he sends links. Articles. Pictures of the missing sisters—and oh, Hell. The younger sister is, like, twelve (“Fourteen,” he says. “Her name is Sophie”).

And there’s her older sister, Chloe, who is trans, reported in the news as a missing 17-year-old named “Timothy.”

And suddenly I remember something else about my asshole ex: that I’ve always admired his heroic streak (a heroism he denies, maybe because it is not on brand for a con artist). There’s probably nobody better suited to confront “it” down in the dark than my grifter-with-a-heart-of-gold (that he never wears except, apparently, when trying to wheedle me into helping him).

So all right. *Fine.* I guess I'm helping my asshole ex.

But he’d better not call me “Babe.”

\*\*\*

The “Milwaukee Murder House” stood vacant between 1948 and 1955. During this time, squatters took up residence and occasionally went missing. Rumors of the house being “haunted” swirled. Eventually, it was purchased and remodeled. Carpeting was laid.

The house sold as a two story home—no basement.

It changed owners several times.

Then in the 90’s, the new owners, the Peterson family, tore up the carpet and discovered the hardwood floors. The Petersons were thrilled to find the wood in good shape (other than some stains). That summer, Danny Peterson, 12-years-old, went missing. His four-year-old sister, Alice, told their parents that Danny went down into the basement. But to the Petersons’ knowledge, the house *had* no basement. Alice kept insisting that “it” took Peter, that “it” was evil and lived below the trapdoor. The Petersons moved away without ever finding this mysterious trapdoor.

The house sat abandoned for months… years… decades…

How many corpses lie below now? Now that flies engulf the house again, now that the odor of rot wafts up through the trapdoor that the teen sisters found…? How many souls have been swallowed by this evil house since Freddy Wilkins Jr. first sat on the steps, head in hands, and quietly insisted, “*It’s* still in the house”…?

\*\*\*

Jack has recruited two others to join our investigation into the Milwaukee murder house:

Lucas, a burly firefighter armed with an axe (you may remember him from [Harmony Care Home](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17yzpk0/i_visited_a_care_home_and_theres_something_wrong/)), and Abdul, tall and rugged with a shotgun and holy water.

Then there’s me, with a silver knife and crucifix, and a machete as a last resort.

And of course Jack, weaving like a coyote between a pair of wolves, leading us on the moonlit sidewalk to the murder house, lean and scruffy in his torn leather jacket. Full of bluster and bravado, the guys banter and brandish their weapons, while I bring up the rear, recording notes to myself on my phone and reviewing the notes I’ve already gathered about the house.

Although this is a rescue operation, Lucas and Abdul have a secondary goal. Both men have experienced supernatural phenomena in their lives, and neither has ever been able to show proof to the world. Jack has promised them the creature’s head—and they argue about which of them gets to keep it and who will make the first strike. (They seem not to consider the possibility that if this plan fails *it* will take *our* heads and add us to its rotting pile.)

Being the only girl, I am the voice of common sense. And as we approach the front steps, I hear myself say, “No, we’re not dueling to see whether the axe or machete is better.”

(Seriously, why are guys so dumb?)

Their banter quiets as Jack reaches for the doorknob. Boards hang at odd angles across the windows, as if someone tore them down and nailed them back up hastily. The faintest odor hangs in the atmosphere. Suddenly I remember the headlines from my research:

NEIGHBORS SAY THEY SMELLED PUNGENT ODOR FOR WEEKS

BOY MISSING FROM MILWAUKEE “MURDER HOUSE”

The door hangs ajar—like an invitation. Jack sets a finger to his lips before tugging it wide.

The gaping darkness. The buzzing flies.

The *smell.*

“Fuck,” gasps Abdul.

“Why the Hell would they wanna explore a place like this?” mutters Lucas. “Teenagers do such stupid shi—"

Jack hisses them into silence, even though Lucas is right—for the girls to urban explore a place like this is the height of foolishness. Then Jack tugs me across the threshold, and every hair on my neck rises at the palpable sensation of something… *wrong.* Something off. Something evil about this place.

Cords and cables snake across the dusty floor. Lights line the walls of the room, currently switched off, their cables running to a generator outside. Heavy metal music plays from speakers, drowning out any noises we might make. A single pale lamp illuminates bear traps that glint at the far end of the room. Jack has been busy, apparently, setting all of this up before our arrival. And just beyond the metal teeth—a rectangle of solid black, from which the stench wafts, along with the occasional fly whizzing up from below.

“This is spooky as shit,” I hiss, freezing several steps away from that gaping black rectangle.

“Yeah it’s definitely spookier at night,” he agrees, his voice muffled by both the loud music and the sleeve he holds across his nose. He flicks on another lamp and points to symbols etched into the floorboards. As I watch, he takes a knife from his pocket and drags it along the wood—not even a scratch. He pours lighter fluid over one of the symbols and sets it alight, both of us backing away from the sudden flames. But when they subside, the wooden floorboards are not even singed. He arches an eyebrow at me. “Emma,” he says, “this next part is all you. Once I’m below, once I give the signal, I’ll need you to break this warding…”

\*\*\*

It’s funny—and flattering—that when ~~my man~~ my ex finds something he can’t solve, like a trapdoor warded with arcane symbols and the only clue to breaking the warding in yellowed pages with scribblings of Latin and Aramaic, he thinks, *Emma*. Like I’m some sort of skeleton key to all academic knowledge. I don’t speak either of these languages (I am fluent—uselessly—in French and American Sign Language). I’m just a grad student. Not even started my program yet. But when he sent me snapshots of the pages he brought up from below, I contacted an old acquaintance, Yaira, who actually *is* a specialist in ancient and occult texts. We spent a long time chatting during my drive to Milwaukee before I met Jack at the diner to go over his plan. The symbols are like lines in a web, she explained—together the wards weave a spell over the trapdoor that both conceals the door and creates a holy seal. The spell also affects cameras, cell phones, and memory. To cast or break the spell, she said, finding the “thread” of where it begins and ends is critical.

“You’ve got to use silver,” she instructed. “And you’ve got to do the wards in order. But… the text also warns you’ll unleash a ‘terrible evil…’”

I nodded, thinking of all the corpses down there.

My ex has been down thirteen times, and encountered the “terrible evil” at least twice. The warding erased his recollections of said evil. And so for this plan, Jack will be relying on notes he wrote to himself while below:

1)    *Victim Alive. Must Perform* *~~Incantation~~* *Ritual. Escape.*

2)    *Do not* ***g****o* ***d****own!!! If you want to* ***m****ake* ***s****ure* ***S****ophie* ***i****s* ***s****afe, break the wards that are* ***s****et around the* ***t****rap door. Stay* ***u****pstairs!!!* ***U****se the notes to dispel the wards. Do not come down again, because your* ***l****ight draws it* ***t****o her!! Sophie is hiding* ***b****lind in the dark from the thing that took her sister.* ***I****t was summoned here by the wards, which keep it in this world, but if you* ***b****reak* ***t****he* ***w****ards* ***t****hen that will* ***k****ill* ***i****t (dispel it) and set Sophie free.* ***W****hen* ***i****t is gone Sophie will be able to* ***c****ome* ***u****pstairs safely.*

On the surface these notes instruct him to break the warding to free Sophie. But Jack told me that he suspects he wrote these notes under duress, with the evil below dictating the contents. And so my wily ex embedded a code.

If you assemble the capitals, the first message reads: V-A-M-P-I-R-E.

For the second, if you read only the words with the thickly retraced lines, it reads: ***g****o* ***d****own* ***m****ake* ***s****ure* ***S****ophie* ***i****s* ***s****afe* ***s****et* ***t****rap* ***u****pstairs* ***U****se* ***l****ight* ***t****o* ***b****lind* ***I****t* ***b****reak* ***t****he* ***w****ards* ***t****hen* ***k****ill* ***i****t* ***W****hen* ***i****t* ***c****ome* ***u****pstairs.*

The resultant plan is classic Jack. Risky. Reckless. Like making a blind bet in poker. For all we know, “vampire” is the closest word Jack could think of to match a creature that could be anything from human-adjacent to indescribable paranormal parasite. Yaira’s “terrible evil” is probably a better description, but when I asked her if there were more details, she told me she was struggling to translate the next part but would reach out when she made progress.

… It’s after midnight, now, and nothing from Yaira as Jack prepares to execute his plan. I tap out a final text.

ME: *Anything?*

A hand brushes my shoulder. Jack has turned down the music and is at the edge of the trapdoor, and Lucas and Abdul are in position—Lucas crouching with his axe behind the lone stained and moldy armchair in the corner, Abdul all but invisible below one of the boarded windows, his hand hovering by the switch to power the lights.

It’s time.

\*\*\*

And now, now as my trembling fingers lift my silver knife, I can barely breathe. What if it all goes wrong? What if instead of telling me to cut the wards, all I hear is Jack screaming? What if—*Get it together, Emma. First the seal, then the signal. Lights, trapdoor, action!*

The plan Jack has recited to us runs through my head. *Lights, trapdoor, action!* Sweat trickles down my temple. ~~My man~~ my ex takes the first few steps down, then pauses and looks at me. In the dark I cannot read those hollow eyes, but his voice says hoarsely, “Don’t die. Just—don’t die, OK?”

“You either,” I reply.

God, we suck. Why can’t either of us say anything real? Why haven’t we *talked* about our shit? What if this is our last chance before—and now he’s descending. Every muscle taut, angling toward the pitch dark. And I realize that he does not look how I imagined he would in these crucial moments, like prey ready to scramble from whatever horror lurks below. No. He looks keen. Predatory. And for the first time it strikes me that maybe I’ve got it backwards—that this is not the first, or even second or third paranormal entity Jack has gambled against. On every previous occasion, he has *won.* And so perhaps it is the entity down there who should fear *him.*

But of course that depends on us. Jack has given us the cards *(lights, trapdoor, action!)*, but we have to play our hand. He’s set us around the room like he’s set those metal jaws around the trapdoor opening. And we—Lucas, Abdul and I—we are the teeth that have to snap shut.

Time seems suspended with each footstep, and it takes an eternity for Jack to reach the bottom of the stairs, stack the cans, and finally disappear deeper within… and now my blood rushes so loudly I worry I won’t hear if or when he screams. There’s no more footsteps to keep track of him by. Nothing but the tinny sound of Blue Oyster Cult’s “(Don’t Fear) The Reaper” playing through the speakers (God I hate him for this playlist). I have no idea what is happening. We just have to wait, and wait… and wait…

*BZZZZZZZT!*

I almost shriek. My phone’s vibration roars like a propeller in the comparative stillness, and I quickly silence it. Only to stare at the text that has come through.

YAIRA: *DO NOT BREAK WARDING!*

YAIRA: *I was wrong. ‘Terrible evil’ isn’t what’s behind the seal. It’s what befalls the one who breaks the warding. A punishment/deterrent/curse.*

YAIRA: *It could kill you. DO NOT BREAK WARDING!*

The whole world falls away. It’s just me and that little screen, that flurry of messages, and the tinny notes of “(Don’t Fear) The Reaper.” But Jack is already down there. Already confronting “it.” If I change the plan now…

Angling my flashlight into the trapdoor opening, I poke my head in, but my light illuminates nothing in the pitch black as I call, “Jack? Everything all right?” *Please respond. Please come back so we can discuss—*

“*BREAK THE WARDS!!!*” hollers his voice.

No. Not yet. Not already. “Are you sure?” I shout, preparing to add “we need to talk,” but his frantic shrieking interrupts me—

“*YES I’m fucking sure!*”

My pulse rockets to the moon. “It” has him. There’s no other reason for him to sound so strained with fear. “It” is about to kill the man I ~~usedtolove~~ still love very much. “*Shit*,” I hiss, fumbling for my silver knife. I unfold the yellowed pages with shaking hands. Find the symbol in the wood matching the symbol that comes first in Yaira’s instructions—the one she says represents the “key.” A terrible calm settles over me now that I know what I must do. My arm plunges down, the blade clunking into the center of the symbol. I drag the knife across the floorboard, and feel a sickening lurch in my gut, a tingle along my skin, shivering up and down my flesh. I keep going, stabbing my blade into the next symbol, and the next—on and on, following the pattern on my paper. My heart gallops faster and faster, the beat escalating with each cut until my heart thrums like a hummingbird about to explode from my ribcage. A final sparkling burst, ice crackling across my skin as I rip through the final symbol—

—the world goes black…

… I hear screaming.

“—*RUN, EMMA, RUN, RUN!!!*”

Jack’s voice comes swimming out of the darkness. The buzz of flies. The stench of death. I push myself up on my arms—I must’ve blacked out for a second. From below the trapdoor comes the clatter of metal, cans tumbling, *clank, clanking* across the stairs. The cans! That’s his signal!

“—*NOW!!!*”

Jack’s shout sends adrenaline surging through me.

I catch only a glimpse of the tall, ghoulish figure that emerges from the trapdoor, pale and skinny, with impossibly long arms and sagging skin like sheets of flesh draped over a skeleton. The towering figure lurches out just as I slam the trapdoor shut—

Light bursts around us like a solar flare.

The creature shrieks, staggering back. For an instant, I too am blinded—but as the speckles fade from my vision, I see it, arms curled over its face, wailing, one elongated foot with curving toenails caught in the teeth of a bear trap. The metal teeth have bit the sunken, dead flesh to the bone. Lucas lunges from his hiding place beside the old armchair—but the creature hears him, twisting and lashing out with a long arm, tossing him clear across the room as easily as if he were a beach ball.

*BOOM! BOOM!*

The shotgun rings out, the first shot wide and the second staggering the creature. But it seems more pissed than anything, baring yellow teeth in its wrinkled old man face, one arm now hanging loose by its side. It lunges, grunts in rage at the bear trap still caught on its foot, and twists down, bending its head low—

My fingers encircle the handle of my machete, slick in my grip as I raise it above me. Time slows as Lucas struggles to his feet, Abdul reloads, and the creature finally hears my intake of breath, its head turning as I swing the blade down—

*THUNK!*

The machete embeds in the creature’s frail neck. As I stumble backwards, I see Abdul now standing directly in front of it—*BOOM! BOOM!*

This time, the shots hit. It drops.

Lucas staggers over, sets a foot on the twitching corpse, and then brings down his axe, separating the head from the body.

\*\*\*

Ultimately, six deceased victims would be discovered below. In addition to Chloe, authorities would find Danny Peterson and a member of the Wilkins family under the stairs, their ancient corpses lodged beneath hers. Two squatters would be found deeper inside, tucked behind a chest. And lastly, a small, unidentified and mummified corpse locked in a small closet, the door warded like the one upstairs, but the symbols hastily scrawled. It’s unlikely we’ll ever know the truth about this last corpse’s identity, but I surmise they were once a vampire hunter who came to the house after the Wilkins massacre, and lured the creature into the basement so it could be trapped and sealed off from the world while an accomplice upstairs closed the trapdoor.

My theory is that the vampire was too powerful to be killed when it first appeared, and so the hunter’s only recourse was to play the role of bait, luring it below and using the wards to contain it.

As for the yellowed pages—they were torn from a book Jack would later recover from the floor of the basement, likely dropped by the vampire hunter during the initial pursuit. The vampire knew the pages could unlock its freedom… but it could not persuade the humans it encountered in those early years, the squatters and others who explored, to break the wards (most likely due to the spell’s erasure of memories). But then came Jack—Jack, tempting it with his sweet blood, babbling about deals, about bargains, about freedom, and the vampire remembered the pages then, and tore them from the book, and watched him write a message to convince himself to break the wards. His bargain was a lie tainted with the truth. He *did* release it from its captivity. But the devil is in the details—and after massacring the Wilkins family and others, preying on people through the decades, the creature’s insatiable hunger was finally ended when it made a deal with a devil named Jack.

\*\*\*

“Emma!”

Jack’s voice, muffled, shouts from below the trapdoor, which *thuds* with his pounding. The creature and I are lying on the door, and Lucas sets aside his axe and grabs a spindly arm, drags the enormously long corpse off the door while I shuffle aside, and Jack bursts out. He squints in the bright light, his gaze sweeping the scene: the body, the head, me, Abdul, Lucas. Then his arms are around me. “Thank God you’re alive!” His hands smooth back my hair. “Emma, Emma—you all right?”

“Yeah….” I say, “yeah…” Still catching my breath.

“She fucking ganked it, man,” Lucas says.

“Holy motherfucking shit—do you see this thing, man? Shit!” Abdul is jabbering like he can’t believe the thing that came at us. Like it still hasn’t settled in.

Jack’s lips brush my forehead, and then he is gone—plunged back into the dark. He returns in a few minutes with Sophie clinging to him, one hand around her head to shield her from looking too closely at the decapitated creature, and he steers her into the single dilapidated armchair in the corner and sits her down. “Hey,” he says. “Hey.”

She trembles like a baby bird, eyes red and chest heaving with sobs and hiccups.

“It is *not* your fault,” he says, squeezing her arm. “Do you understand me Sophie? What happened to Chloe is *not* your fault. If you’d left the trapdoor open, Chloe would still not have been able to escape that closet. And the police would’ve gone down and it would’ve killed them and fed on them. And then it might’ve gotten strong enough to break out and kill so many more people, *including* you and your sister. You kept it sealed in. You hear? You *stopped* it from killing more people.”

Sniffling, Sophie finally meets his eyes. Her shoulders shake. He keeps repeating himself until she nods, and she sobs, burying her head in his shoulder.

“… I’m sorry I couldn’t save her,” he says.

It surprises me, how tender he is toward this girl—not that he’s ever been cruel; just that it’s rare for him to be so emotionally invested, especially in a kid he just met.

I wonder if it’s because of Chloe. At Chloe’s age he went by a different name. He refers to her, to “Jacqueline,” as if she were someone else, a sister or a relative. “She was a girl who wanted to be dead,” he told me once, after I found pics of him pre-transition on his mom’s Facebook. “Now she’s just a deadname, so she got what she wanted.”

The Jack Wilde I know is so absolutely himself, it’s hard to imagine he was ever anyone else. It makes me wonder… if Chloe had lived into her future, who might she have been? Reduced now to those headlines about a missing teen mourned under another name, Chloe never had the chance to find and celebrate herself. And maybe it’s been gnawing at him from the moment he tugged open that trapdoor, knowing that no matter how many times he threw himself down into the dark or how clever his plan or how successful its orchestration—in the end, she never will.

\*\*\*

There will be a coverup, of course. There always is. Abdul and Lucas document everything while Jack and I return Sophie to her parents’ house (they actually thought she was spending the night at a friend’s and had no idea of her missing status, which I assume is Jack’s doing, given he had her phone). I call in anonymously to the cops. Lucas and Abdul have cleared out all of our equipment by the time the cops arrive to search the premises, finding a headless, inexplicably inhuman corpse just outside the trapdoor—and below, the many victims of the Milwaukee murder house.

And finally, at just after 2am, in the car just up the block from Sophie’s house where we dropped her off, I set down the phone and suddenly, for the first time in forever, it’s just my ex and me. No plan. No crisis. No spooky paranormal entity. Just the two of us alone together and… fuck. What do we even say to each other? Not that there’s anything *to* say since Jack’s just… catatonic. It’s like all his energy was used in orchestrating his plan. When I try to tell him about the warding, about how I don’t know the cost of breaking it, he barely even hears me and tells me he “can’t brain.”

So we go to a hotel. The clerk asks how many rooms. Lucas and Abdul have opted to forgo sleep (they are still too high on adrenaline) and drive back overnight, so it’s just me and Jack. I stammer, “two rooms, please,” and Jack emerges from his catatonia long enough to hand over his credit card, but suddenly I wonder—was he hoping to share a room? Was *I* hoping to share a room?

No.

We’re not together.

But when we get to my floor, I don’t get off the elevator, instead saying I’ll walk him to his room. And when we reach his door, I ask, “Hey, you doing okay?”

“Yah, I’m good,” he mumbles. I’ve never seen him like this. But then suddenly as he sees me watching him, a shift. And there’s that sweet smile I remember, the one that with his rough bristles and dark eyes always makes me think of a scruffy coyote, and he says, “Thanks again for your help. You were brilliant, like always. And brave and beautiful and—taking it out like you did. Badass, Emma. Bad*ass!”*

I blush. It feels good, almost normal, this interaction between us. Almost how things used to be.

Gold glints on his neck. When did he start wearing the locket? Was it just for today, just for me—plucking at my heartstrings so I’d be more inclined to help him? I reach for it, and my fingers brush his skin. Warm—no, hot—my hand hovering at his chest. His breathing deepens as he watches me.

“Did you put this on just for me?” I ask, playfully.

His dark gaze holds mine in the soft glow of the hotel hall lamps. I don't know why I suddenly take my hand away and step back. It's too much maybe, too fast, and I'm not ready. I just want us to *talk*. The heat fades. And then he gives me that smile again, like he did for Sophie, like he does for everyone, that warm and amiable and disarming smile that makes me think of a dog wagging its tail, and he says, “G’night, Emma,” and closes the door.

\*\*\*

It isn’t until much later that I realize he meant, “Goodbye.” I’m standing in the shower under the stream of scalding water, washing away the grime and sweat and scent of death and terror and stress and adrenaline, and that’s when it hits me.

Because when I think about it, I know exactly what he’s going to do. After all, nothing has changed since our breakup. I forgave him months ago for his [moment of weakness](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1czp6lp/i_met_this_guy_im_really_into_but_i_think_he/) when his demon caught up to us. But he can’t let go of his betrayal. That’s why he calls himself “coward,” “cockroach.” That’s why he’s never tried to contact me. And oh fuck—that’s why he wears the locket, isn’t it? Because it’s the one thing he can hold onto... and suddenly, driven by the certainty he’s going to disappear, I’m out of my room and hurrying two floors up to his, rapping on his door at 3:27am, my heart a bird beating its wings against the cage of my chest, little flutters of panic because can’t we at least fucking *talk* first?

“Jack—Jack! Are you there?”

I’m still rapping, panicked knocks, when the door opens. And he’s looking at me in his boxers bleary-eyed. Relief floods me. Ok, doesn’t look like he was going anywhere tonight. “Can I come in?” I ask him. “I’m sorry I know it’s late…” And he steps back and lets me in and the moment the door closes behind me he presses me against it, his mouth on mine, and the world tilts on its axis. And then I realize no, it's tilted back the way it’s supposed to be, it had wobbled out of alignment before, rocked by how [the Lady](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15wmuwv/i_have_a_million_dollars_and_one_week_to_live_how/) broke us apart. But now we’re back in each other's orbit and I melt against him and everything feels right.

\*\*\*

Over breakfast, my guy is waxing poetic about what a genius I am—I am brilliant, I am Buffy. His compliments leave me a little breathless.

“We make a great team,” I concede.

“Sure do.” He leans his chin on his hand, smiling at me over the hotel’s bland continental breakfast, the locket gleaming at his neck. “You as the brawn, me as the brains...”

I arch my eyebrows. An honors student and perennial teacher’s pet, I’m used to being the nerd. “Uh, I did do all the research,” I remind him.

“You as the brains, me as the brawn.”

“… I also sliced its neck.”

“You as the brains and brawn, me as the gorgeous love interest.”

That makes me laugh. How I’ve missed his cornball humor! I take in his face, cleanshaven now, his dark tousled curls, the pale blue button-down, and my lips quirk. “You *do* clean up nice. So does this mean you’re OK with being together even though you’ve still got that tattoo?”

He's clearly in good spirits, because the sparkle in his eyes dims only a little at this reference to *her.* He shrugs. “Well, since you came to my room and seduced me I just have to figure out a way to make things work.”

I scoff. “I did not ‘come to your room and seduce you.’”

“Totally did and it was hot.”

Everything is good again. *We* are good again. We still have plenty to sort out, but for now, the world is right. Except…

There’s one very important thing I haven’t discussed with him. He’ll find out when he reads this post, like all of you. See, I’ve been researching since that night… I’ve been in communication with Yaira, hoping to find answers before he can worry, but I haven’t managed to yet. So it’s probably time to let him know.

The translation. The warning about breaking the warding. I never fully learned what it meant, the “terrible evil” that would be unleashed on me. But I felt it hit me when I slashed those symbols. And I think it’s affecting my dreams… I keep waking up feeling like I’ve just seen my own last moments, like I’ve just *experienced* some heart-racing horror.

He might not be the only one marked for an early [death.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
