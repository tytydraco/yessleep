So to properly explain what happened to me, a bit of background is necessary. I of course have a podcast, not a typical kinda two friends bantering podcast but one where I write stories and those stories are narrated. A lot like those YouTube videos where it’s scary reddit stories, but my version has good narration and a lack of shitty A.I images. That sounds a bit bitter but I guess I am bitter.



The podcast started off as a university project, it grew into much more. At first it was me and a team of other students, then it became me on my own as people dropped off. I needed a way to have my writing I guess matter, like I have something to say and needed people to hear it.  



The conceit of the podcast beyond it just being narrated stories was the choice. After each episode, the audience could choose what happens next, they were given two options and whatever they decided would dictate what I write for the next episode. This was the cause of the problem. 



Episode 2 they were given two choices just like last time, but this time the audience couldn’t decide. The story featured Marcus, a man with an alien parasite causing him to self cannibalise himself. The choice was whether Marcus should lose control or find help. After the voting window closed, both choices were tied. So I had to do something you know.



Kinda foolishly I hadn’t considered what a tie meant, you don’t expect a tie so you don’t plan for it. So I decided to wipe that story and start a new one, I believe this is the cause for the aforementioned sentience. I started writing episode 3, a new premise, a new story, completely different. But I couldn’t get Marcus and his story out of my head.



Nothing weird, nothing out of the ordinary, just unease. It was a feeling and a feeling alone. I almost felt like I had killed someone. Like he was just an idea, a fictional man I made in my head, not even really a character, just a vessel for narrative, then I started dreaming about him.



Every night for the past week I have been visited by the story in my sleep. At first just a retelling, in graphic detail but only because the story was graphic. Marcus saw a sparkle in the sky, the sparkle entered his body, Marcus began consuming himself and just when Marcus was about to either self destruct or fix, the story ended. Each night the dreams became stranger.



The perspective shifted, on night two I stopped being a watcher and started being watched. I was no longer looking at him as if I was not present. The same things were happening but in every scene he was staring at me. Chewing on his cut off finger, eyes locked on me, they wouldn’t leave, I woke up. This is when I started to take notice.



I’ve had weird dreams before but none that were repeated, there felt like there was a point to these. I was being seen by something that didn’t feel like just a character, it felt sentience. And I know that doesn’t really mean anything, but you can tell you know. When you look into the eyes of an A.I person, the eyes are dead. Marcus’ eyes were alive, more alive then even mine.



Night 3 was the same, night 4 it got worse. I became an observer well not an observer, the observer. I was now in the space, in Marcus’ house. The first thing I noticed was my body, no longer a 22 year old woman, now a frail old creature. I don’t think man is the right word. My limbs were long, inhumanly so, my skin was dry and flaky, bulbous veins bubbling underneath the surface, my skin a ghostly pale. I couldn’t speak. Then Marcus came out of the bathroom and stared at me.



I stood up and ran a hand through my hair, I actually didn’t do any of that, I was being puppeted. I started speaking, I couldn’t hear what I was saying, just a high pitched scream piercing my ears, it was painful. I wanted to wake up but couldn’t. I finished the conversation with Marcus and turned my attention somewhere else, turned it inward.



The room collapsed, the world collapsed and in its place a room, my room. I watched myself sitting at my computer, writing the same episode of the podcast I was now in. The vessel I was in got closer to me, its mouth behind the neck of my past self as it spoke. This time I could hear it. It told me in a raspy and tortured voice to “stop changing” and I woke up.



This is when the fear hit, these dreams, well nightmares, were getting strange and real and just a weird concoction designed to fill me with dread. I wanted them to stop so badly. I didn’t want to sleep that night, didn’t want to see what was next but I talked myself into safety. Dreams are dreams, nothing real has actually happened. My mind is just fucking with me. Before I went to bed that night I listened to episode 2 again, hoping it would give me some ease to remind myself that it was simply fiction made by my own mind.



When I listened to it, it was drastically different. I was in the episode, well not me but The Observer. Instead of what happened originally Marcus left the bathroom and saw it. The same skin I was in last night. The same conversation happened, this time I could hear it. It told Marcus to kill himself, told him that was the only way to end this story in a satisfying way. After Marcus ignored its plea it turned its attention not to me but to the narrator. It told him to stop reading, he didn’t.



He read the lines that someone wrote, he pretended to be shocked that The Observer was here, pretended that he shouldn’t be acknowledged. But it was in the script. One that had my name on it. When the narrator continued reading The Observer was gone and the story happened like it did before today. I closed the episode and began checking the script over and over again. It was different, The Observer was in there and it was written weeks ago.



I asked my friends who had listened to the show about it, tried to act as non insane as possible. To them The Observer had always been in that episode, they even told me that The Observer was voiced by me. My first thought was that I was going insane. I mean if I was right and the past had been rewritten, the implications are horrible. But then I had a slight epiphany.



I don’t know why it came to me but there is this game called Immortality. In it, layered atop reality is a film and to find the reality nestled between, you have to rewind the tape. I did this, rewinded the episode again and again, and weirdly it worked. Beneath the new video was the original one, only appearing in flickers, the original recording, barely audible just trying to break through. Whatever did this didn’t change the past, just pasted a new one over it. 



I was still doubtful of it so I called my friend over and he saw the same as me, saw the old world trying to break through the new. He didn’t remember the old world however, that was a curse only I held. This revelation gave me both comfort and concern. I went to bed that night scared, but I didn’t see the same thing.



I was on a sunny island sitting around a firepit in a swimsuit. Then a robotic voice started talking and I immediately knew where I was, I was in Episode 3. Affection Archipelago, a not so affectionate horror spoof of love island written by me for the next episode of the podcast. I was in it and this time I was in control. Before anything could happen, before the A.I. could finish it’s sentence, I woke up. This dream was a message, I needed to finish the next episode.



Over the next few days I began writing faster, wanting to get the episode done so I could garner some resolution. As I did this my body began changing, subtly but it was happening. Every day that passed my body was becoming more like it. My limbs were longer by about 2 inches. My skin was drier than normal. I wasn’t crazy, I was becoming it.



I wrote quicker and quicker, needing to finish the story in the hopes it would end and it did. I finished episode 3 and sent it off to my narrator. It stopped. Didn’t revert but stopped progressing. It was barely noticeable, just minor changes that no-one notices. And that pretty much brings me to now. I’m scared, really scared.



These aren’t really minor changes, I’m transforming into this monster I see in my dreams and the only way to stop it is to write. Which I can do but I don’t know I feel trapped, I feel like I’m no longer in control of my own life. Everytime I look in the mirror I see it, below the surface, hidden below my facade. A creature I can’t control.



I need to stop this permanently and I don’t know how. What if another tie happens, will it get mad again, will it lash out. Why is this being of power so focused on me? No-one will even believe any of this. My friends and you probably think I’m making this all up as a writer, to make another weird story. But no this is happening and I’m scared for my life. Please if anyone knows how, help me. I can feel The Observer watching me from inside my own body and I need him out.
