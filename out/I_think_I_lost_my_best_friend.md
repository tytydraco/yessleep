God fuck me, ok to give some back story, me and my friends are really close. We've been a group for around 6 years now and I've never been closer to anyone.

Throughout the years there have been some relationships here and there, but when two people, let's call them Bazel and Nicky, in our group started dating we'd thought they'd never break up.

They were perfect for each other in every way, nerdy, loving, and always spent time together.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago Nicky had to move. We all knew it was going to happen, their parents were forcing them to leave state. We were all upset but knew bazel would be the most affected by this. But I never knew It would go this far...

A few weeks after Nicky moved we decided to all get together at one of our houses, just a normal hangout. It felt a little off without Nicky there, but we moved past it and just tried to continue as normal.

These group hangouts usually consist of around 6-7 members. We have Bazel and Nicky of course, then we have Jonathan, David, Maddock, Me, and Bayne. These were all the people present on the day of the incident.

All of us we in one of the bedrooms talking and playing games together. Jonathan and David were on the console playing some type of FPS game while Maddock was sitting on the floor scrolling on his phone. I was watching the two of them play together on the TV when I see bazel walk past the door. I hadn't seen her for a while at this point and followed her out into this hallway.

The hallway was dark, I couldn't see much but the closer I got I started to hear laughter. It was bazel and someone else, I couldn't quite tell but as I approached the door I knew exactly who it was. It was Nicky, that had to be Nicky's laugh. I walk inside the room both excited and confused. That's when I see them, I see Nicky and bazel together, but it wasn't Nicky..

Sure it looked like them, it sounded like them, but no this was not Nicky. The closer I looked at this person I realized they looked completely different. Like someone was doing a look alike competition. I backed away slowly getting nervous, while bazel just laughed and smiled like everything was normal.

I didn't know what to think at this point. Did I mishear? Did I only think I heard Nicky's voice? But then I heard it again, they laughed. It was Nicky's laugh, there was no doubt about it. I just stared at this stranger, then began berating the with the only thing i could think.

"who are you?Who are you? Who are you!" I repeated, surprising myself with my anger.

That's when I turned back towards the fake. They were still smiling, almost giggling but their eyes told a different story. The worry. The fear in their eyes. It was like they were pleading with me, begging me to save them. This wasn't just some imposter, they were forced here. Bazel had forced them here. She had kidnapped this person and forced them to do unimaginable things. I felt my blood boil in the moment, I didn't know what to think. What could i do? This was my best friend we're talking about. This is a person that has been with me through everything, but now staring into a person who has been sculpted to fit her twisted desires all I could feel was anger.

"WHAT DID YOU DO!" I screamed at her with as much anger as I could.

She just stared at me and smiled, she didn't say anything just walked past "Nicky" kissed them on the cheek and went into the kitchen. I looked back towards the fake as a single tear went down their face while they continued to just smile at me.

They were the victim here.

No matter how much I tried to get information from them, it was like their mind was trapped. Whatever Bazel had done to this poor soul left them in this state, unable to properly defend themselves or respond.

That's when the others came in the room. My scream had resulted in quite a panicked response from the rest of the group. Jonathan came in first and immediately came towards to make sure everything was fine. I was just standing there in shock, no longer able to process the situation. All I could muster was a slight gesture towards the fake. At first Jonathan wasn't sure what was happening and just stared at this person confused but then he heard it. He heard the voice.

The fake let out a soft giggle that sounded more like a cry. A voice that was way too familiar. He didn't know how to respond, he shut down like me and just stared at them. Then he became to speak

"w-what happened..?" He was finally able to get out.

"Bazel.. b-bazel happened." I croaked out.

That's when we heard running followed by a hard slam. Maddock had tackled Bazel in the kitchen. He had been by the door listening, not knowing what to think. Until he heard me say Bazel's name, and then everything made sense to him. He took her to ground before anyone could react and just started beating her. Fist after fist, just raining down on her for the crimes against nature she had committed. He was determined to be the hand of God in this situation and be the end all judgment in deciding her fate. But she just kept laughing and smiling, not fazed. Each hit made her laugh harder until she couldn't breathe.

Jonathan and I snap back witnessing this and pull the beast off of her before he can finish what he started. Bazel just continues to laugh, laughing harder than anyone I've seen. Then she sits up, a bloodied mess, and proceeds to call out towards "Nicky". And like a trained animal they come. They go right towards bazels side, continuing to lightly cry in the process.

"Aw, what's wrong sweety? I'm ok, I promise." Bazel says while wiping away their tear. "There's no need to cry."

Upon seeing this Maddock pulls out of grip and slams against Bazel once again. We pull away the fake, trying to separate them from bazels influence. Still just trying to make sense of the situation. Maddock manages to restrain bazel and we all proceed to gag and restrict her.

"What do we do!?" Jonathan cries out scared and confused.

"She needs to be punished for what she did!" Maddock yells.

"I agree but we can't justify killing our best friend. What she has done is unforgivable but we can't be the ones to punish her. We need to call the cops." I say trying to remain calm.

"Bullshit! We can and should be the ones to take care of this. She doesn't deserve any mercy for the sins she's committed." Maddock screams

"We don't know anything yet! Let them investigate her. She's unstable, we'll never learn anything if we just kill her." I reason.

So that's how we ended up calling the police on the whole situation. They arrived and took bazel away for questioning while trying to make sure the Fake was ok. They still weren't responding and told us they think Bazel may have drugged her but couldn't be sure until they were taken to the hospital.

The cops left and we all were just left there stunned. Bazel was a core part of us. Seeing what she had become would forever scar our minds. I don't think any of us will ever be the same, but I don't think this is the end of it.
