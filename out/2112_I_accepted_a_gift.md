My name is Robert Wilson, I’m 59 years old. 21 years ago my wife and children died in a car crash, a truck coming in at 174 km/h collided with the back of my car, miraculously I survived but I’ve faced some difficulties, especially with my psyche, since then, I’ve been struggling with severe anxiety and depression, three years later I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

There’s was an old but functional subway near my town, with rumours about a “ghost train” running through the tunnels from time to time. Around the time I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, I started experiencing severe hallucinations in my day to day life, particularly at night and in darker lighting I would see figures seeming like people I used to know as well as those that seemed far from human in essence. The delusions actually got better, and I stopped seeing as much hallucination for around 4 years after my diagnosis.

Up until later on in the fourth year however. I was never a superstitious or religious person, nor was I even agnostic, however I would start hearing something telling me to go to the old, abandoned subway for a “special gift” from the universe. I believed this to be another one of those delusions I previously experienced, which led to me ignoring it and living my life as useful, however the voices would worsen. The voices and noises would become so overwhelming that they would hinder my ability to think clearly, as well as suffering from constant headaches.

On the 21st of December however, I would become unable to ignore the voices, and succumbed to my own curiosity. It was 2:00AM when I arrived at the abandoned subway, when I entered I felt I was being crushed by my surroundings, compressed by the atmosphere of the place, felt like I was being watched too and the abandonedness of the place didn’t help with how creepy it was. The place was riddled with graffiti and littering, dust engulfing every crevice in the brick walls. I wondered why the voices led me to this place, trying to convince me for about a year. I felt I was instructed to come here, as well as to do the following things.

To let myself lay on the tracks and to rid myself of clothing, I was forced to, I couldn’t do anything else. I stared into the tunnels, it stared back into me, the tracks fading from the corners of my vision. Tears flowing from my eyes, I would start begging to the voice that guided me here, and within the darkness of the tunnel a man would appear.

The ominous man would lock eyes with me and I would start to feel my body surrender, a sense of satisfaction and relaxation would overcome my body. The man whispered to me from afar, 

“Are you ready to receive your gift?”

“Yes.”

Then I was struck by the train, my body turned into a mess of meat chunks and organs.

 I found myself in my bed, it was a dream. I would get up to change into my work uniform until I noticed the scars on my upper body. Exactly where the train smashed into in the dream. I turned on the TV as I saw the news featuring the same subway, however this time with people crowding the place, which cut to an image on the tracks where the exact same clothes I wore in the dream laid when I took them off.

“It has been done, you have received your gift.”

“What gift?”, I thought, confused about the dream and the scars, was it all real?
The voice spoke, almost coldly,

“What happened last night was real, you have been ressurected.”
