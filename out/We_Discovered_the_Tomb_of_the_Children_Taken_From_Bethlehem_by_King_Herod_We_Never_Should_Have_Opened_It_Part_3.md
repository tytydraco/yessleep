The Translation: (Part 2)

*We paused at the threshold. Antipater waved the torch in front of us. Four sarcophagi lay only a few feet away from where we stood, all of them too small for Herod. I knew exactly what lay within, and my bones shuddered in unison with my aching heart. I wondered if Antipater felt the same, given his involvement in bringing them here.*

 *We cautiously made our way inside. As the light penetrated deeper into the cave, I saw that those first four sarcophagi were only the first row of a long line of similarly placed ones that extended deeper into the cave. They ranged from tiny boxes no larger than a hen’s nesting box, to boxes large enough to hold a toddler. Even though the lids were all in place, I swear I could see each and every one of those innocent children lying within.*

 *We continued deeper into the cave, passing coffin after coffin, and I was convinced there’d be no end.*

*When we reached the 12th row of sarcophagi, the walls on both sides became catacombs. Each slot was occupied by a recently deceased adult male, and I instantly knew this to be the remains of the thugs that had taken the Children from Bethlehem. Unlike the occupants of the sarcophagi, no ceremony was given to these bodies. None of the slots contained a single individual. Instead, several had up to three bodies squashed together in the small space, while the majority were filled to capacity with the amputated limbs and heads of the dead stacked for the most efficient filling of the space. The stench that wafted from these freshly decaying corpses was the most dreadful thing I had ever smelled in my entire life, enticing me to pause and throw up. I did all I could not to desecrate any of the children’s sarcophagi with my bile.  Antipater helped me up and gently held my arm as we went on.*

*After what felt like an eternity, we reached the far end of the cave. The 20th row of children’s sarcophagi lined the wall, but the 19th row consisted only of a single adult sized sarcophagus. It was as plain as the 76 smaller ones. However, it was not completely sealed. The lid sat atop, but it had been slid down just enough so that the head and upper torso of the occupant would be exposed.*

*Within the silent depths of the tomb, Antipater and I looked at each-other, our eyes alight with shared hope that our dirty work had already been completed. He shone the flaming torch over the exposed opening, and instead of seeing my brother’s corpse, we saw a wide eyed, pale faced, madman smiling back at us. The sight was so startling that we both flinched backwards and stumbled over the little sarcophagi behind us.*

*The silence was broken by Herod’s laughter. “Didn’t expect to see me alive, did you?”*

*Antipater helped me up, and together we stood over Herod’s sarcophagi and looked down at him. Whilst the rest of his gangrenous infested body was little more than a limp corpse, his face was alive and animated as he continued his hysterical laughter that was starting to sound more and more like that of a demon.*

*The laughter died down and Herod continued, “It is their will that death will forever be evaded of me. I stole their lives, so they will take my rest. Justice at its purist. I did them wrong, so they are to give me my due. I am grateful to be given the chance.”*

*I could see Antipater grinding his teeth as he glared at what remained of his Father within the sarcophagus.*

*I was lost for any words in response to Herod’s bizarre statement. Who in their right mind would willingly surrender themselves to what sounded like an eternity of torment?*

*“Now, to our business against God,” Herod closed his eyes and smiled, as though the topic of the fates of those thousand within the hippodrome was something funny. “I take it the families have been gathered as requested?”*

*Antipater’s fists clenched at his side and he continued to glare at his father.*

*I answered instead. “They are, brother. But before you give us your order in regards to them, may I strongly advise against anything that might bring them to harm? There are almost seven thousand individuals; men, women and children, squished within the hippodrome. If they are all to be killed, I fear the repercussions will not just come from the populace, but from Rome itself. Augustus will condemn your dynasty for allowing such an atrocity to come to pass.”*

*But instead of Herod’s immediate response, I heard a new voice. Or better,* voices\*. It seemed to spawn out of the stale air around us, and sounded like a ghostly chorus of wailing children, “KILL THEM ALL. BATHE THE UNGRATEFUL LIVING IN FLAMES. LET THE LIGHT CONSUME THEM BEFORE THEY JOIN THE SHADE.”\*

*The hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I jolted my head, searching my immediate confines for the source of those voices. All I could see were the lined sarcophagi of the dead children. I looked back down at Herod, my eyes wide with terror and he merely shrugged.*

*“They said it for me,” Herod said. He squinted his eyes as he studied my expression. “Oh come, Salome, don’t give me that look. I understand that Rome will not condone it, but this goes far beyond the realms of earthly powers now. Better for Augustus to despise us, strip Judea of local power and fully incorporate the region into his empire, than to allow The One Who Lived a chance to take my throne. He and his followers can try all they like, but against the might of Rome, they will be like ants trying to take down a bull. The Children have willed it, and so it will be thus!”*

*“Tyrant!” Antipater shouted.*

*He withdrew his dagger from his tunic and held the point of the blade over his father’s face. Antipater brought the blade down, but just before the tip was able to penetrate any flesh, some invisible force caught his hand. Antipater struggled to release his arm from that force but to no avail. Herod laughed as he watched him struggle.*

\*“\*HE’S OURS!” *came the wailing chorus from all around us.*

*Antipater’s blade wielding hand began to lift, until it was high above his head. The fear that wreathed his face told me that he had no control of this movement. Then, as swift as a hare darting into scrub, he was tossed like a child’s toy, back towards the entrance of the tomb. Somewhere near the threshold, I heard his body slamming against stone. If it wasn’t for his agonized screams that soon followed, I would have thought him dead.*

*Herod began to shout so that Antipater could here, “Your reward is due! Your reward is due! Do not be afraid, my son! Together we will be at their mercy!”*

*I left Herod to his mad hysteria, and bolted towards the threshold. Antipater lay in a heap of his own mangled and bleeding limbs, writhing about in utter agony. I came to his side and tried to soothe him, but nothing would penetrate the fog of his pain. All the bodyguards stood near the entrance of the tent, mouths agape, and only Boaz the captain came to assist.*

*We had barely begun to take in the extent of Antipater’s injuries, when the ghostly wailing pierced our ears. It was louder this time and sounded so eerie that I did not protest when Boaz pulled me away from Antipater until he deemed, we were at a safe enough distance from the tomb.*

*Antipater’s agonized screams returned, and this time they reached a pitch unlike any I had ever heard in a living man before. I watched, my eyes plastered to the dreadful sight, as Antipater was once again raised into the air. But instead of being thrown again, his body began to twist in an unnatural way, similar to a sponge being wrung out. Bones, intestines and other internal organs began to pop out from his overly stretched skin. A white substance of a similar consistency to smoke began to etch out of his mangled pores. The substance gathered above Antipater’s contorting body, until a small white cloud, roughly the same size as Antipater had been, hovered there.*

*“YOU ARE NO HERO!” that wailing chorus screamed from within the tomb. “YOU BELONG TO US NOW, JUST AS THE MOTIVATION FOR HEROD’S DECISION AGAINST US, BELONGS TO YOU.”*

*If the voice was speaking to Antipater, it was speaking to little more than a ball of flesh that had once been Herod’s firstborn son. The mangled ball fell to the ground with a grotesque splat; limbs, bones, hair, teeth, all that had made up Antipater, nothing more than a bloody clump of dough. Then, an unseen and unfelt gust of wind must have blown from our direction, for that hovering cloud that had come from Antipater’s pores was swiftly drawn into the tomb, where it was lost to sight.*

*I stood there next to Boaz, unable to fathom what I had just experienced. The urge to throw up at the sight of my nephews remains was surpassed by the whole unreality of what had just occurred. As much as I knew this was no dream, I couldn’t help pinching myself just to make sure.*

*Boaz’ deeply tanned face had taken on the hue of snow and he gently turned me around and guided me through the tent and out the other side where we were rewarded with the warm sun shining down on us. The rest of the bodyguards were also outside trembling fiercely, their composures having clearly faltered at some point during that ordeal.*

*Boaz sat me down on a rock next to them, before he too collapsed to his haunches. For a good half hour, none of us spoke, all silently coming to grasp with what we had seen. At least that was what I was doing.*

*At last, one of the younger guards spoke up. “What are we going to do?”*

*All eyes turned to me, yet I had not the slightest measure of where to go from here.*

*Boaz spoke up. “Antipater is going to be missed.”*

*I nodded at that. Being the heir who was likely to ascend the throne in a very short time, his lack of presence would definitely turn heads and prompt questions to be asked. Suspicion would naturally fall upon me. Even still, I had to return to Jericho. The final order of Herod - of the spirits - needed to be evaded.*

*An idea occurred to me. “Herod is already renown for having lost his mind. He has killed two of his own sons in the past, as well as countless others for no just cause. I don’t think it will come as a surprise when people learn that he decided to execute his firstborn.”*

*Boaz nodded, “I won’t argue with that.”*

*But in my mind, it was not how I was going to address the court in Jericho about Antipater’s absence that troubled me. It was how I was going to rescue the seven thousand people penned up in the hippodrome. They were guarded by blood hungry soldiers who eagerly awaited the order to kill. Combined with their captain’s eagerness for a promotion, I feared that it was not the court I had to worry about but these men. They were the most savage of Herod’s soldiers and had jumped at the idea of rounding up so many people. I shuddered to think how many had taken this opportunity to rape and molest those unfortunates. Denial would be at the forefront of their minds as they were told to release the prisoners, and I wholly expected them to revolt as a result. All the while, the lives of those in the hippodrome remained uncertain.*

*I knew then that the only way those people had a chance, was if we returned to Jericho unannounced and dealt with the soldiers that were keeping them, in secrecy.*

*I turned to Boaz. “How much respect do you have across Herod’s army?”*

*His face regained some of its colour. “Well not a lot, I am only the captain of Herod’s bodyguard. All units have their specialties, and whilst I may be considered elite in the bodyguard circle, I’ll be little more than a novice outsider to the other units.”*

*“But you ARE to be respected, for your role requires the upmost trust of the king. You put yourself down Boaz. I am confident, that if the plan I’m about to tell you is addressed by your lips to some of the other units, they will act faithfully.”*

*“What plan do you have in mind?”*

*“I need you to go about the army- well to those not tied up at the hippodrome - and rally those that will listen to my cause. Herod wants all those people to be killed. It will be a crime even greater than the one he committed in Bethlehem. I refuse to partake in it. But I fear the men who await the order will not heed my word and go about the killings at their own will. We need to dispatch them before they even know what has happened.”*

*Boaz was reluctant at first, and sat in silent consideration as the rest of his guards discussed with me the likely units that could be swayed to follow Boaz. Eventually, Boaz came around and agreed that he will see to it.*

*And so came two days of silent scheming and conspiracy. Whilst all in Jericho believed I was still out with Antipater at the “place” where Herod was residing, I went about alongside Boaz, through the barracks of various units of Herods army, rallying men to our cause.*

*I wasn’t surprised at how many were eager to save those people. Most of Herod’s army were honourable men, despite the madman they served.*

*On the third night, Boaz led the attack on the men guarding the hippodrome. They were heavily outnumbered and surrendered before much blood was spilled, for in the end we had managed to gather majority of the army to our cause. It turned out that most of the men had grown fatigued with Herod’s madness.*

*With the guards gone I addressed the confused mass penned within the hippodrome and simply announced that they were free to go. By the morning, the place was empty, and the seven thousand were well on their way back home.*

*I went to the palace where I was met with a confused rabble of court officials as well as Herod’s surviving sons and likely contenders for the throne now that Antipater was dead. They all demanded to know why the Hippodrome was emptied and of course, asked about Antipater.*

*I told them that Herod had killed Antipater out of suspicion. No one looked too surprised, especially the three sons. As for the Hippodrome, well I told them that it was MY decision. When some argued against that, I argued back. Was their moral compass so low that they would follow the wretched order of a mad king destined to die in days! No further arguments came.*

*All they knew, was that Herod was wanting to spend his final days in the wild where he could be at peace. Until he died, and his Will could be read, I would act as regent. For the time being, my orders to the court were to wait for his passing.*

*And so it was, that I returned to that horrid place accompanied only by Boaz and the guards who had been present last time. I needed to make sure Herod could finally die.*

*I entered the tent with my escort close behind me, and made my way to the still open mouth of that tomb. The clump that had been Antipater’s body was now infested with maggots and filled the space within the hide covers with the stench of decay. I did all my best to ignore the clump of flesh, as I took a deep breath and entered the tomb. I did so alone.*

*Unlike the first time I had walked through that dreadful place, passing child sized sarcophagi in silence, there was a noticeable humming sound that seemed to reverberate from the walls. It was as though the very space in which I was walking through was somehow sentient. I could feel my hair rising up the same way it does after reclining for too long on a pillow. There was definitely an unnatural force at work.*

*For a moment, I swear I had heard Antipater’s voice calling out my name, but it vanished when I tried to focus on it.*

*Passing the walls of catacombs, I was startled to find that the hacked-up bodies of the thugs had been re arranged in a grotesque manner. Their severed heads were arranged in rows along the slots in the wall, each with an arm that had been severed below the elbow shoved into their gaping mouths. The hand that protruded out like a crude tongue, rested on the crown of the head next to it, making a chain like line that connected them all together. All over the wall, the same inscription was scratched into the rock written in very scratchy Hebrew: “They stole our lives, we steal their rest”.*

*The most logical explanation was that this had all been Herod’s doing. But remembering what happened to Antipater, I was forced to swallow the bitter antidote that there was more to this world than meets the eye.*

*I eventually reached the place where Herod lay, and sure enough he was not dead. He lay in that half-opened sarcophagus as though he had been expecting me.*

*“Salome! I was afraid you would not come back. The Children beg their forgiveness for all that occurred to Antipater. They realized they must have frightened you. But rest assured, his soul is with us now.” He beamed at me, and for a moment I was given a glimpse of the face of the brother I had once adored. “You have nothing to fear here, sister. Give your report on the fates of the families in the hippodrome and your services will officially be at an end. Just so you know, I have had my Will amended so that you will be given the cities of Azotus, Jamnia and Phasaelis upon my full surrender to the children. I know you will rule those cities well. Now, sister. Tell me of the families. The Children and I want to hear every detail, down to the last plea of innocence.”*

*I stared at him, weighing up how I was going to address him. At the same time, I felt the static around my hair gain in vigour, and the humming of the space rattle my bowels. Whatever had killed Antipater, that Herod called, “the children” was leaning in to hear my report too.*

*I thought about how Antipater died. How he was wrung like a sponge until the cloudy substance etched from his pores. I thought of how likely it could happen to me if I told the truth of my disobedience of the order. The weight of the presence that lurked about me grew heavier.*

*But instead of prompting my composure to slip so that I would tell them what they wanted to hear in order to spare my own life, a strong defiance gripped my soul. Whatever this entity was that had played Herod like a puppet, I refused to give in to it.* 

*I ripped my gaze from Herod and drove my eyes into the darkness, looking “them” - the players of all this horror - in the eye. Then, I roared into the black, “I let them go! Never would I have allowed your order to pass! Seven thousand souls yet remain in the realm of the living!”*

*The humming all of a sudden stopped, and the static about me relaxed, leaving the tomb as silent as it should have been. Only Herod broke it with his constant questioning, “You did what? Salome? You did what? What?!”*

*I ignored my brother, my body tense in anticipation from a sudden attack by the unseen.*

*“TRAITOR!” screamed the wailing chorus of voices. “THE ONE WHO LIVED WILL HAVE HIS THRONE! OUR DEATHS ARE IN VAIN BECAUSE OF YOU!!”*

*A sudden weightlessness took a hold of me, and I realized I was being raised up to the ceiling. I looked down at Herod, for the last time, and saw his face now a mask of dismay. “Please!” he called out, “She must be mistaken. My sister would never defy such a monumental order!”*

*“SILENCE!” the voices bellowed. An invisible force suddenly drew the lid of Herod’s sarcophagi up and over his face, sealing him within. His screams of torment and horror at this unexpected turn of events was muffled out by the thick stone.*

*The force continued pushing me up against the stone ceiling, and I was certain I was about to be squashed like a bug. My vision began to blur and I knew that my head would explode like a squashed fig at any moment.*

*Despite my agony, I heard a new noise. At first it sounded like a hammer banging against an anvil, but as it grew louder, I knew it was someone running through the tomb to my position.*

*“Release her!” shouted a new voice. I wasn’t sure if I heard it, or it came from within my mind.*

*At once, the pressure was eased and I fell hard on the ground right next to Herod’s sarcophagus. My aging body screamed at the trauma, but I ignored it in favour of this new presence. Standing before me was a Being of incredible power. It beckoned me to stand by its side, and as I did, all my pain seemed to vanish.*

*I stared at it, my mind spinning in circles as it tried to come to grasp with what I was seeing. The Being wore an armour that seemed to be made of pure light, the steel fitting to its body like a second layer of skin. Its face was as pale as the moon and lacked both a mouth and nose. The absence of those features was compensated by numerous holes - as empty and dark as the void - scattered about the upper face that I knew were its eyes. Under other circumstances such an entity would have left me cowering in fear, but I knew it had come to save me from the evil within the tomb.*

*Seeming to have accompanied this Being was a hue that turned the black darkness of the tomb into a dull red.*

*The Being fixed its gaze at the far wall of the tomb and began to shout at the entity that had almost killed me. Without the distraction of bodily trauma, I could confirm its voice was only heard within my mind.*

*“Here me now, Spirits of the unacquainted! Spirits of the immature and inexperienced! Your bitterness is justified, for your lives were wrongly taken from you. You have the men that slit your throats, you have the man who manipulated the King, and you have the King who gave the order. Let that be enough to sate your fill for vengeance.”*

*“BUT SHE DEFIED OUR ORDER!” the wailing chorus responded in an ear-piercing shriek, a much earthier sound than that of the Being.*

*“Salome has played her part in the Lords plans! You will not bring her to harm!”*

*“BUT LIFE! WHY MUST WE BE SHUNNED OF IT, AND OTHERS ALLOWED TO DWELL IN IT?”*

*“Because that is your fate!” the Being bellowed. “Accept it! Just as the myriads of others taken before their time have accepted thus over the millennia.”*

*“ITS NOT FAIR! WHY DID WE HAVE TO DIE, WHILE ONE GOT TO LIVE?”*

*“Because it was God’s Will! He pities what happened to you, but your fates are irrelevant to that of His son Who has come to fulfill all of His plans here on Earth! He needed to live. You lot didn’t. It didn’t HAVE to be the case, but ALAS, Herod saw to your deaths. That is why God is allowing you to have him Body and Soul, as well as all those involved in your untimely deaths, to do with as you will, as a token of His sorrow for your fates.”*

*“WE DON’T DESERVE THIS! WE WANT OUR MOTHERS!” the voices were now crying in a mixture of cries that all Mother’s know too well, ranging from that of the newborn, to the 6 month old, to the two year old. Combined into one, it was the most heart wrenching sound I believe could ever exist.*

*I remembered the procession of confused and scared little boys out of Bethlehem, and before long, I too was crying alongside these Spirits.*

*“On behalf of God, I am sorry,” the Being said. “But if you are too vengeful to accept your fates and rest, then you are to be content with the few lives you have already been given. You are to remain in this place for eternity.”*

*The crying of the voices intensified and the mother in me simply wanted to comfort it, despite all the uncompromising evil it had already committed.*

*The Being - I was starting to realise it was likely a Herald of the Lord - grasped my hand and began to lead me back out of the tomb. Behind us, the crying followed.*

*“PLEASE DON’T LEAVE US HERE IN THE DARK! PLEASE!”*

*But the Herald ignored them.*

*We reached the threshold, and outside the tomb, that red hue was even more pronounced in the filtered daylight under the hide covers of the tent. I was startled to see Boaz and the guards sitting casually, and barely noticing all the commotion coming from the tomb mere feet away from them. Then I realized that they were frozen solid. It was as though time itself had paused for them.*

*The Herald gestured for me to stand out the way, before he went to the large slab that served as the barrier and began to roll it into place.*

*But just before it would be sealed forever, a little boy appeared at the threshold, his face wet with tears and about to be crushed by the stone.*

*“WAIT!” I screamed.*

*The Herald paused and fixed its empty eyes on the innocent child standing in the way.*

*“Please, I want to go home to my mother,” the child said through its whimpering.*

*“You only wish to be free to bring your bitterness down upon the innocent. You are nothing more than sad, hateful spirits, eternally jealous to those who are privileged to yet live, and unable to accept your fate. As I said, you can stew on your bitterness in the darkness for eternity. I will hear no more of it.”*

*In the same breath, the Herald raised its hand and swatted the child like a fly. The boy withdrew into the cave covering his face with his hands as he cried hysterically into the darkness. The Herald sealed the tomb.*

*I was shaking. Not out of fear but pure sorrow and grief. But guilt was the superior. Now I knew the feelings that must have engulfed my brother in the days following his damnable order. At least I hadn’t been the one to pass it. But standing there, watching The Herald shun that child and drive him back into the tomb, I felt just as responsible.*

*The Herald turned to me and approached. “Wipe your tears, Salome. You cry over a well performed act.”*

*I did as I was told, but was still in denial of the whole ordeal. “Are they really so evil?” I asked.*

*“No.” The Herald replied simply. “It’s their unpredictability that is the primary concern. They died too young to understand good and evil. They died with only primal instinct being the basis of their understandings. In their situation, vengeance and jealousy. Without having undergone the fundamental education of controlling and understanding emotions that is compulsory to all who get to experience life, they are destined to do what you may consider evil deeds.”*

*I shook my head, unable to grapple the unfairness of the entire situation. From Herod and Antipater’s killing of them, to now God’s shunning of them.*

*The Herald grasped me on the shoulder, and I was lost in the endless void of its eyes as it continued to speak into my mind. “All you need to know is that God is fond of you, Salome, and sent me in your moment of peril as a token of His thanks for your part in helping His son escape the fate of those children. You do not deserve to share the same fate as your brother and nephew, which, mark my words, is not to be pleasant. They will be tormented by those spirits for eternity.”*

*The Herald paused for a moment as it considered its next words. “That is, unless someone attempts to open this place back up again. I fear that if such a thing were to happen, whether in ten years or two thousand years, the Spirits may have grown bored of their torments of Herod and desire to leave their abode in search of more living to torment. There is no knowing what the situation will be like if such a scenario was to happen, and not even God has the foresight to know if He’ll be in a position to counter it.*

*“Therefore, I give you these strict instructions. As the Toparch of Phasaelis, in which you will soon become, I will have you commission a secondary seal over that which I had rolled in place. Make it from the strongest material you can find and have it cemented in place so that none can crack through it. Upon it, you are to inscribe your experiences of this place and leave a stark warning to any who might dare to open it up. As a further precaution, bury the secondary seal under a thick layer of earth. Do all of this, and the spirits will never see the light of day again.”*

*I knew it was a massive task to undertake, but at the same time I was in no position to argue against it. If it was God’s will, then so be it. The hardest part was going to be keeping its construction as quiet as possible.*

*The Herald continued, “Now, as for Herod’s body.”*

*It walked to a large stone that lay next to the rolled one of the tomb, and touched it. I watched in awe and denial as the stone gradually changed until it was the shape of my brother. I walked over to it, and touched the cool face that looked identical to Herod’s. Even the texture had changed to replicate that of a corpses skin. He looked to be in complete peace, a shroud for the masses to the fate of his true body.*

*“Your succession depends on his body being seen by the court. Place it in an ornate casket fit for his character, and return him to Jericho. Let the histories be recorded without a mention of this place.”*

*And in an instant, The Herald disappeared, the red hue accompanying it. A soft breeze suddenly spawned and Boaz and the men were talking. The world continued to exist as normal.*

*Boaz spotted me and was aghast at my unexpected presence a few feet from where he stood. But then he saw the body of Herod and the sealed tomb and understanding gripped his face. I will forever be grateful to him and his men for their unquestioning loyalty and acceptance of the supernatural, even without ever getting the slightest description of it save for these very words.*

*With their help, we brought Herod’s manufactured corpse back to Jericho, where all his funeral arrangements were made, and relevant successions took place, as mentioned faithfully by Nicholas of Damascus.*

*Here is where my account ends.*

*Please, let this be a warning to any who happen to unearth this site. As The Herald said to me, “there is no knowing what position God will be in to counter them.”*

*It took me a long time to come to grasps with the truth, but it is simply this. The Spirits of the innocent young boys of Bethlehem who were murdered in cold blood under King Herod’s orders, are bitter. They are vengeful, not only to those that saw to their deaths, but to those privileged to live a life that they never had the chance to. This very much includes you who read these words.*

*As I said, do no more than read that which is written on this wall. Turn around and leave this place as it is. If you happened to excavate it, cover it back up.*

*Leave it as it* [*is.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/jaymicafella/)
