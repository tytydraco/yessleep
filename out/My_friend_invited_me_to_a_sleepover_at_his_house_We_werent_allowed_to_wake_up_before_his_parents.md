When I was 11, I was at the very bottom of my class until the teacher, Ms. Henry, made me sit next to the new kid. Thomas and his family moved into town halfway through term, so he just sort of appeared one day.

During his second week, Ms. Henry tried to draw him out of his shell by asking about his favourite TV program.

“What’s a TV program?” he replied.

That got a laugh. Clearly, he was playing dumb to put one over on her.

Everybody thought he’d emerge as the next class clown, but instead he rarely spoke and aced every subject. A few girls tried befriending him—they dug that ‘Children of the Corn’ look, I guess—but agreed he was a weirdo after chatting with him in the lunch hall.

As desk buddies, he and I locked horns. A lot. Because I was left-handed, our elbows bumped together whenever we wrote, and he got super pissed anytime I asked to borrow a pencil, so I of course did this as often as possible. Anytime I asked Ms. Henry to split us up she’d just sneer and say, “Ryan, there’s gonna be times in life when you’re forced to spend time with people you don’t like. Get used to it.”

One day, as I struggled with a difficult maths exam, Thomas offered to help. I’m guessing he finished early and got bored.

It was my first ‘A’. Without either of us ever agreeing to it, he started helping me with homework and tough assignments, and soon my grades improved so much my mom bought me a bunch of Pokémon cards as reward. I offered Thomas some of the one I already owned, but he didn’t even know what a ‘Pokémans’ was.

Then one day, out of the blue, he asked if I’d sleepover at his place. “Father *really* wants to meet you,” he said.

Why did his parents even know who I was? We sat together, sure, but he knew so little about pop culture getting through a conversation was like chewing calt. Still, I wanted to thank him for his help, and my mom didn’t raise any objections, so that Friday I packed some clothes and cycled over to his place.

I drove down several short roads flanked by woods, past a train station, toward the outskirts of town. Thomas’s two-story house sat at the top of a long driveway so steep that I needed to jump off my bike and push most of the way, and all the windows were either boarded up or had the curtains pulled shut.

Things got spooky the second I arrived. Thomas and his parents waited patiently to greet me, each grinning like they were on a poster for tooth whitening. Everybody had matching blonde hair and dressed in plain shades of brown, grey, and white.

A large man introduced them as ‘The Donovan’s’. My pre-teen brain categorized him and his wife as ‘old’, but in retrospect there must’ve been a twenty-year age difference there.

Mr. Donovan walked my bike into the garage while me and Thomas followed his mom inside. Something was wrong with the house—it looked too sterile. No clutter, zero toys scattered about. Plus, the antique furniture was older than my grandparents. In every room, sheets had been draped over objects mounted along the panelled walls, and Mrs. Donovan made a point of telling me that, “Touching the sheets is *strictly* forbidden.”

She led us into a sitting room decorated with crucifixes, crucifixes, and more crucifixes. Of varying sizes. We kneeled down on a colourful rug, facing each other. The only sound was the ticking of a grandfather clock.

At last Mr. Donovan joined our group and led a prayer for the standard stuff: good health, blessed weather. Even though I’d gone to protestant church with my grandparents, I couldn’t figure out what religion we were meant to be practicing. He obviously thought of himself as a spiritual leader, and devoted a lot of time to the ‘blind sinners’ who would suffer ‘swift retribution’ on judgement day.

It wasn’t until he called for a minute of ‘holy silence’ that I heard a low, shaken voice.

I concentrated hard, tuning out the clock. There were muffled cries. From somewhere *within* the room.

I peeked my left eye open. Nobody was watching, although the way the family didn’t stop grinning made me shiver. I glanced around the room. We were alone.

When I turned back towards the circle, Thomas’s Mom was staring straight at me, her smile practically splitting the seams of her face. Quickly I shut my eyes, already anxious to go home.

The silence seemed to last forever. Finally, the spiritual leader clapped his hands and said we should go out back and ‘toss a ball around’. On my way out of the room, I listened for more cries, but the sound had died off. I figured my imagination got the better of me.

As Thomas and I tossed a leather ball back and forth in the long grass, his dad watched from a crude decking area, beaming. Like at school, Thomas threw with his right hand whereas I favoured my left. We kept trying to pass each other bad shots, competing to make the other miss a catch. It was all in good fun, though.

Thomas acted even weirder than at school. Away from his parents he at least seemed interested in subjects like TV, but now he strictly spoke about Bible stories and recited his favourite verses. I sidestepped his questions my spirituality as much as I could.

My arm was aching by the time Mrs. Donovan called us for dinner. In the kitchen, we gathered around the table, and then she brought in a metal pan, presenting 5 boneless chicken breasts lathered in lumpy gravy and canned peaches. Before we ate, everybody linked arms for another prayer, and part of me wished the ritual would never end, because then we’d need to choke down the food…

A heavy silence fell over the room, then those cries started up again. Closer than before.

It sounded like a child, and their voice had a panicky quality. If it wasn’t for the threat of another glare from Thomas’s mom, I would’ve peeked. As the prayer dragged on, the crying became more hysterical, until finally something rattled against the wall behind me. Mr. Donovan’s voice raised, thunderous now, and drowned out the sound. I’m not sure which scared me more, but either way my arms broke out in goosebumps.

The sermon ended five minutes later, and we sat there in silence until the head of the table said, “Amen.”

I checked the corners for sobbing children, finding only more sheets. What then? A CD player? My imagination?

The uncooked chicken made me gag. I didn’t want to cause trouble so I picked around the mouldy peaches and spread out the plate so it looked like I’d eaten more than I actually had. There was chocolate cake for dessert, but Thomas’s Mom went around slicing a piece onto each of our plates, which were still covered with chicken and gravy. By that point my stomach was growling, so I scoffed down a top layer of cake which hadn’t touched anything else.

I wanted to leave. Faking a belly ache, I asked if they would call my mom and have her come pick me up.

Thomas’s dad raised an eyebrow. “No need, we have a special remedy.”

He told the rest of the family to pray for my health and led me out of the room. The front door was on my left, and I briefly considered making a run for it, but the second I did Mr. Donovan’s hand clamped around my shoulder, tight. His smile never wavered, but something about his eyes made me break out in goosebumps. Like an implied threat. So, I let him guide me into a vintage bathroom.

There was a covered cabinet above the sink and the tub was already full. A thick layer of scud—plus a few dead flies—floated along the surface. Mr. Donovan poured something into the murky water (salt maybe?) and ordered me to strip off my t-shirt so I could dip my midsection in.

I told him I’d made a miraculous recovery.

“Ah, the power of prayer,” he said, grinning so wide I could count the back teeth.

After that he announced it was time for bed, despite the fact it wasn’t even dark yet. Upstairs, at the very far end of the hall, a huge object spanning the width of both walls was covered by another sheet.

We got ushered me into Thomas’s room, which was even more dull and lifeless than the rest of the house: a queen-sized bed, one small cupboard, and a single wooden chair tucked in the corner. We needed to share the bed, but only *after* another round of prayer. Then, it was lights out before 9 o’clock.

Alone with my friend, I rolled over and asked what religion his family practiced anyway. He gave the vaguest answers possible, and when I pushed him, became hyper-defensive. So, I said, “Hey, do you ever wanna punch Ms. Henry right in her stupid ugly face?”

That made him laugh. Away from his parents, he became more like his school self. Not normal, but closer than before. We argued over who the hottest girl in class was, followed by the most annoying. Without meaning to I brought up one who always teased him, and it was like all the energy leaked out of my new friend.

“I know everybody thinks I’m odd,” he sighed.

“They just need to get to know you like I did. They’ll come around.”

“You think so?”

“Absolutely.”

He smiled. Then, after a little while, he said, “Hey, wanna see something creepy? I’ll show you if you think you’re brave enough not to wet the bed.”

I rolled my eyes. He wanted to rattle me, like when we played ball. “Sure.”

“We’ve gotta wait until mother and father retire for the night.”

I kept asking what he had planned but he wouldn’t answer. He got a kick out of keeping me in the dark, I think.

He waited until the house fell quiet, and then swung his legs out of bed. “This way.”

In the chilly, dark hall, enough moonlight shone through the windows beside the staircase to see by. As we tiptoed past several closed doors, that crying returned, growing louder as we approached the object beneath the black sheet. *Not* my imagination then…

Facing me, Thomas whispered, “Don’t worry if he looks at you, just make sure you look away fast. You’ll be fine so long as you look away fast.”

Before I could ask what that meant he crouched down, grabbed the corner of the sheet, and pulled it back, revealing an antique armoire. Suddenly the crying became less muffled.

A mirrored panel ran along the bottom section, surrounded by fine, gargoyle-like carvings. Still holding the blanket, Thomas pushed his left ear against the carpet and stared at the glass. “He’s there. Come look quick.”

I just wanted to get this over with. I lay down.

For a second I stared at the reflected hall, confused about why we were even there. But then an out-of-place shape caught my eye. I told myself it was my reflection, but then realized I had no reflection.

A boy was standing in the corner with his back to us. His shoulders went up and down like he couldn’t stop sobbing.

“Do you see him?” Thomas asked.

I swallowed a gulp, my blood running cold.

“Neato, huh?”

My brain scrambled for an explanation. It was a trick. Or a nasty prank. I looked behind me. Nothing. Only a bare patch of wall.

“He’s not there,” Thomas said. “Only in the mirror.”

When I looked back, the boy was much closer and crouched on his side, nose to nose with me. His features were all stretched out, long and narrow like a funhouse mirror, and he had a shock of blonde hair to go with them. His thin lips twisted into a grotesque smile as the boy reached out to me, the tips of his fingers pushing *through* the glass, into reality. I couldn’t move a muscle until his faces only inches away from mine, his breath blasting me in the face like a gust of cold air.

I scrambled away. If my throat hadn’t hitched itself shut, I would’ve screamed. Quickly Thomas dropped the sheet and dragged me up by the shoulder, then shoved me down the hall. Behind us the armoire thrashed from side-to-side, its hinges squeaking, the boy crying again. Now his voice had an almost hysterical quality.

Back in the safety of his room, Thomas pressed his ear against the door until the armoire quietened down.

“We are blessed father didn’t hear,” he said. “Now we sleep. Father said we aren’t to rise before he wakes us to begin the morning ritual.”

He must not have been the least bit scared by what we saw, because he ushered me into bed and dozed off straight away.

But my body wouldn’t quit trembling. What was that thing in the mirror? Were there more of *them*? Is that why they hung sheets everywhere? But why keep any mirrors at all?

One thing was for sure: I couldn’t spend the night in that house. But Thomas’s dad would never let me go. I needed to get the hell out of there without being seen.

After Thomas’s breathing eased into a rhythm, I swung my legs onto the floor and tiptoed out of the room, toward the stairs, but as I approached the top, footsteps came clomping along. I ducked behind the nearest door.

Through the narrow gap, I watched Mr. Donovan march past with a rectangular object tucked beneath his arm. There was a tinkling sound from beneath the sheet. He carried it over to Thomas’s room, grunting the whole way, and disappeared through the door. My stomach lurched into my throat. I didn’t want to find out what he had planned.

I flew down the stairs, carefully, quietly. I kept my hand against the wall for guidance.

The front door was locked. My bike still was in the garage, I hoped, but how did I get there from the landing?

Above my head, there were angry shouts of, “He’s gone!”

No time for plans. I sprinted around the ground floor, flying from room to room. Cries rang out in every one, and now the objects beneath the sheets danced on the walls, bouncing around. The crying child sounded terrified now, like they were in pain.

Past the kitchen, there was a cramped utility room with another door. The temperature plummeted as I bolted through it, into the garage.

The light switch was on the inside wall. I flicked it, then a naked bulb blinked on. Junk was scattered everywhere: car parts, step ladders, boxes of old newspapers. And more sheets thrown over different mirrors, each flapping and twisting. There were more cries, except not just the boy, and for a second I was afraid to move

But then a door slammed shut behind me, and I ran for it.

My bike was propped up against the wall beside the exit, it’s handlebar stubbornly tangled with a Christmas tree. After a few tugs, it came loose, and it was like setting off a Rube Goldberg machine. A mop and bucket fell into a stepladder, which clattered to the floor and sent a bag of marbles sprawling across the floor, and so on.

I grabbed the bike’s handlebars. The exit was one of those old ‘fold-up doors’ you needed to twist the handle to open. My hands were shaking so badly I needed to set the bike aside and focus solely on this task.

The door rotated up. Behind me Thomas’s dad burst into the room, and for the first time he’d stopped smiling. He rushed after me but struggled to get through the minefield of junk.

My bike’s rear wheel became tangled with a sheet, and when I started running it came away like a magician ripping away a tablecloth. I heard the mirror fall the floor and shatter. Laughter rang out, and I when I glanced back over my shoulder bone-thin arms were reaching out of the glass, towards Mr. Donovan. As the garage light rapidly flicked on and off, Mr. Donovan screamed. I will never, as long as I live, forget the terror in that scream.

Pure adrenaline got me out of there. Without slowing down, I sprinted to the top of the driveway and leapt onto the bike and flew down the hill. Behind me, screams rang out from deeper in the house. I didn’t stop to look back…

Mom wasn’t pleased about me cycling home so late, but I made up an excuse about Thomas’s family getting sick and needing to leave in a hurry, so she let it slide. I knew she’d never believe my story.

I tried faking an illness to get out of school because I was so anxious about seeing Thomas again, but she was having none of it. I spent all of Saturday and Sunday wondering about what I’d seen.

On Monday, my desk buddy sat without breathing a single word. We never spoke again and we didn’t bump elbows once.

To my great relief, Ms. Henry announced Thomas’s family had moved again the very next day. I never saw him after that, although for a while I had nightmares about his dad dragging me back inside their house, and they tend to flare up anytime I see a mirror-fronted [armoire](https://new.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/).
