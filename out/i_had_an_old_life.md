years ago, my dad bought some sort of animatronic bear off of craigslist or some other random marketplace, according to the listing it was an old robot the guy was trying to sell quick.


my dad thought it was a good purchase for the coming Halloween, so he decided to contact the seller.


after 3 days we had gotten it, it was super expensive but the dude was saying yes on our negotiations that it actually made him seem like he was trying to get rid of it.


So we got it, and we put it outside next to our house to creep out some kids, but we had noticed, the kids would literally see the robot and start immediately crying, or they would not dare get anywhere next to our home.


the day after, we realize, this animatronic, had been moving on its own?

according to a friend of mine, it had been speaking gibberish and sometimes mustered up English words that said "I will come for you." or "You can not escape.", as well as moving on its own, which i didn't believe at first, but the day after we noticed it had moved, we did not see it in the front of the house, and we searched for it but couldn't find it. 


i said to myself "whatever, Halloween has already ended."

But then, the day after, when i woke up, i saw it, staring at me, this big animatronic bear with torn hands and no eyeballs, only what i could assume was mechanical lights.


as i got up and strated to leave the room, it started to make strange noises, it felt like, being in a dark room with no light, and you know something is in there with you, looking for you, it cant see you, and you also can't see it.


i decided to tell my dad but he wouldn't believe me, until i took him into my room and showed him, but it was nowhere to be seen? they started laughing at me, and saying that i was hallucinating, and saying that i was lying and stuff but i actually wasn't, and then, wait? we had just found it, the same place we left it, next to our door, so my dad decides that this is too much of a distraction, and he decides to put it in my closet, and locked the closet, because mine was the only lockable one.



After a few years of nothing coming from that closet, it, one night, started to make random sounds, you could hear mechanical sounds, like an animatronic moving one of its parts, or sometimes, it would laugh, or worse talk.


" I will come for you." "You will regret." ...


one night, it just stopped, and after a week or two of not making any sounds, i decided to open it, and there i was shocked, it was no longer an animatronic, it looked, rotten, with no legs, it's color had went from Brown to Black, until i saw its eyes turn red, and it said "[laughter] Thank You." 

and it started to shake violently, before it got up, and walked on what i could only assume was metal wires and rods.. it had no visible leg.

i ran for my life, but i couldn't escape, it was too fast, it had catched me.

i was surprised at how it could hold me up, i was a very heavy guy, it opened it's big mouth, and put me through there, bit, bit, bit and i could feel every second of it, with it's big sharp metal teeth, i screamed, and cried in agony, but nobody could hear me, all my cries would go into the inside of it's body, soundproofing any screams from getting out.

i had died.


only then i don't know how much time it had been, but i suddenly gained consciousness, i was, in an alley, it was the midst of night, and i scrambled my way out of there, for some reason, it was very easy to get out of the alley, which looked like a small landfill at night...

until i realized, after looking at my hands... i had became the robot, my "eyes" started glowing red, which is what helped me find a way out of the dumpster, there i sat, with no emotions, i couldn't cry, i couldn't scream, i couldn't. i was an animatronic, desperate for my old life back, as i started to walk to my old house, i couldn't even say a few words without tumbling into gibberish, and i could notice the rare car's you'd see looking at me strangely, I was a monster, and there was no way i was coming back.

with frequent black-outs, i could barely remember anything, it felt like, i wasn't the only thing controlling the robot, i felt full..

i decided to break the curse and jumped into a river near my area, and god do i regret that.



i didn't die, i didn't break the curse, i just felt a huge sharp pain, i was left to suffer..

as i noticed my own body start to break down due to water damage, i felt, i felt, blades going inside of me, and the only thing coming out of the robot's mouth was blood.. i started to lose consciousness, and i don't remember what happened after that, other than, i woke up in a hospital, i was now a child? i cried to try and get the medical staff's attention, but they didn't notice anything wrong.


this was A very long time ago and i died, but i was reborn as a new child? i have already grew up and it was very weird.
