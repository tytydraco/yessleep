Last night I had my first sleep paralysis. I’ve never experience it before, but my nights have been long. I’ve stayed up watching Youtube videos, sometimes I fall asleep watching Netflix.

Anyway last night in my dark room, I awoke tied to my bed and a dark figure standing by my door. I couldn’t stop looking at it. Skinny body and long dark hair. Something kept me on my bed, something kept me from shouting. Then I passed out.

Relived by the sunlight, and my Google searches. I get dressed for work.

Been home since 6pm. Took a nap then woke at 8pm. On 3am I just finished a crime documentary then I turn to lay on my back, taking the sound of  my air tower. Soft quiet noise. Until I heard a knock from my wall. Unsure of what I heard, I laid frozen. Then another knock. I sit up. Suddenly something is banging on the wall.

When moved away from my bed it stopped. Finally I put my ear against the wall. A little snicker? I knock on the wall, like it’s a door. “Someone there?”  Silence.I knew the house next door was empty. On the other side of the wall should be an empty room.“Hello?” Nothing responds.

I lay back down, my eyes on the wall. I closed them.

BANG! BANG! BANG!

In anger, I bang the wall right back! I had enough of this, I just wanted to sleep. We had this competition on who could be louder. After minutes of back and forth, I grew tired of this. I flung my window open, tried to peer over the ledge. I couldn’t see the window. “WHO THE FUCK IS IN THERE?” 

I stood on the ledge closer to the window. Still out of sight. The house had a roofed patio, I stretched my leg to the shingled roof. The street lamp light illuminated parts of the empty room. It was dusty, grimy and abandoned.

Suddenly a women sidesteps in front of the window. I screamed at her sight, my heart raced. A skinny white woman with an oval pale face, wide black eyes and long black hair. I couldn’t look away from her. She bent over to look at me. No smile, no facial expression, just wide black eyes starring at me. She bangs her head three times on the window. She reached for the window lock, I stepped back forgetting where I was, I slipped off the roof. I caught a gutter railing then fell to the pavement.

My ankles and soles stung. I heard scuffle come from the roof, the pale white women popped her head over the patio roof. I panicked, scramble to my feet, I didn’t have my keys or phone. She crawls around the patio roof like a bug. Hands and feet on the patio ceiling, hanging like a spider, she turns to me. 

I run to the back entrance to my land lords floor, I bang on their windows to wake them up, the pale women follows me. She crawls on her palms and feet, her face and eyes fixed on me. They didn’t move or change. She bangs her head on the pavement and then runs towards me.

My heart raced. I run down the block, she follows. My ankles hurt but I pushed away the pain. I turn the corner, I glance at her unmoving face. “LEAVE ME ALONE!”

 I run to other corner, deciding to go around the block. I threw down a few trash cans to slow her down. She runs through my obstacles, face unmoving

.I turn the corner, barefoot and in my pajamas, I grabbed empty beer bottles and threw them at her face. She never flinched. I turned the corner, my street. With the last of my stamina I bolt to the back door. 

I saw the first floor lights on. I see her turn the corner, I run to the back entrance. Thankfully my old land lord opened the door and let me in. I told them what happened, I tell them to call the police. I look out their windows, no sign of her.

I remember that I left my window open. I run upstairs to my room. I see my door slightly open, I burst in, ready to fight but my room is empty. I turn on the lights, shut the window and lock it. I open the closet and check under my bed. 

I look through my kitchen, turn on all the lights. I wake up my roommates and tell them what happened. They’re scared and begin checking their closets. We searched every inch of this place. No sign of her.

When the police arrive, I tell them what happened, they go into the empty house. They find nothing, just dust, bugs, and empty rooms. They go to the room across from mine, they see the open window. They close the window. They come out of the house, asking me more questions. They ask me if I drink or smoke weed. “No I don’t.” I give them the description of the woman. They tell me they’ll run it in the system and then leave.

My roommates go to their rooms. I rest in the living room, until sunrise. The light quells my fears but I know she is still here, somewhere, hiding. I type this out, trying to remember anything to give to the police but the only thing I can remember is her face.

I don’t think I’ll sleep again.
