For those needing to know what's gone on recently in town: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jqzhxu/strings\_part\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jqzhxu/strings_part_i/)

I told Logan about what happened at school. He said that I’m finally coming around to the “real town experience.” I can finally consider myself a bonified Ampletonian since I witnessed a supernatural event. I hate the way he said it and I told him that there was nothing supernatural about it.

My camera was just not capturing the kid in the dark. He had to have been out of frame and out of the range of my phone’s microphone to not be in the mover’s video. These were the explanations my mom gave when I explained it to her. She was upset about Rowan being out in the dark. She told me that she went over to the Kinseys’ House, still feels weird saying that, and confronted them about the child being out.

According to what I was told at the dinner table, the old couple didn’t deny it. They said that Rowan had gotten lonely while they were out and helped himself out of the house knowing they would be next door. Before they’d known he wasn’t in his room he was already knocking on the door.

What my mom did next, I can only imagine. My mom’s not one to get confrontational but when it comes to children and pets, I think she can give any Karen a run for her money. I’ve only seen my mom get that way a few times. Once it was to a family who left their rat terrier in the car on a hot summer day. Mom threatened to break the window herself if they didn’t get their dog out.  

Needless to say, the Kinseys assured her that they’d be hiring a sitter for the child.

“You don’t think they’re ghosts then?” Logan asked. “Even after they moved into the old Walker House?”

“It’s the Kinsey House now. I doubt they’re anything like that, dude. Do you know any ghosts that rely on a moving company to move their furniture?”

Logan shrugged.

I was going over all this with Logan at lunch. He has not seen the Kinseys and Logan has a tendency to let his mind run wild at the smallest details. Might be why I’ve been friends with him since middle school. He’s genuine Ample townie through and through. Believes in all manner of ghosts, cryptids, and aliens. The things that I stopped believing before I learned Santa Claus wasn’t real.

Sorry to anyone who hasn’t been told the cold hard truth yet. Hope your parents enjoy that conversation.

Logan compensates for those parts that I lack. I know that he’ll listen to all of it and give me an honest answer. Hence why I decided to share with him the weird vibes of the Kinsey family.

“Maybe they’re like some other undead or…” Logan stuck two carrots into his mouth and hissed. “*Vampwires.*”

I laughed. Almost chocked on the water I was drinking. I shook at my head at this guess, too.

“They were in the sun.”

“Better not have been sparkling,” Logan groaned.

I think I better leave out the tangent we went on since there’s a lot to cover and covering the horrors of the sexy vampire trend would take pages. There’re more important things to cover here.

Logan said that he wants to come over to my house to see it for himself. He’s certain that there’s something about the Kinseys. People don’t buy a century old mansion without knowing the rumors.

“Could be they’re witches,” Logan said.

I can’t believe that Logan, a guy who jumps to vampires and witches at the sound of new neighbors, is passing Advanced Algebra and Chemistry. God help our school system.

“Maybe they’ve come home to roost,” I said. Ever my dad’s son.  

“What?” Logan asked.

“Nothing,” I replied.

Logan came over that weekend. My parents were okay with it since my mom had to work late and my dad was planning on a camping trip with his buddies. He extended the invitation to Logan and me.

“No thanks, Dad. We got games to play,” I told him.

“You sure, Miles?” Dad asked. “Might get a chance to see American Dippers. They’re the only aquatic songbird in North America.”

Despite the difficult decision between spotting America’s only aquatic songbird and the potential paranormal entities masquerading as my new humble neighbors, I told my dad that Logan and I had plans.

“So long as you’re not throwing a crazy party,” Dad said.

“Is there anyone in this town who would even come to one?” I asked.

My dad took a moment. His lower lip rising as he pondered it for a moment. I’m sure it was the same look he gives when he’s measuring up a tree at work. Deciding if it’s the right size and material for the company.

“I heard Norris has a keg or two of his own moonshine,” Dad replied.

I scoffed and shook my head. “He’s in a retirement home, Dad.”

“Then that’s where the real parties are at.”

My dad patted me on the head before checking on some of his camping equipment in the garage. Logan came by not too long after. We settled into my room with a pair of my dad’s old binoculars that he gifted to me, an oven roasted pizza, and some root beer. When Logan unzipped his backpack, I was unsurprised when he pulled out a golden cross, kosher salt, a sharpened piece of wood, a pocket knife, and a piece of garlic.

“Yum,” I said.

Logan smiled at me. “If this’s real than I’m prepared for anything.”

“Where’s the holy water?” I asked.

He frowned at my question.

“Tried to get some but the pastor said he can’t give it too just anyone. I gotta be in the church to ask for something like that.”

I had to laugh again. I may not believe the stuff Logan believes in but I have to admit that he seems to have a lot more fun in this town when he believes the things that he does. The thought of Logan arguing with a pastor for holy water would be comedic gold.

“You mean you didn’t convert?” I asked.

Logan took a bite of pepperoni pizza. Shaking his head while he did. Causing the cheese to stretch.

“I don’t think my mom would be too thrilled with that. She’d probably call a doctor to check my temperature.”

While we lounged in my room it became apparent that we had no real plan for how we were going to monitor the Kinsey House. We pretty much watched videos on my TV and played some games on the Switch and every so often checked the window next door to see if anything was happening.

World’s Greatest Paranormal Investigators, I know.

My dad stopped in to ask if we wanted anything from the store as he needed to get new stakes for his tent. We asked for more sodas. We had already put away Logan’s things in his bag. When Dad left, it was getting dark. Logan and I turned out the lights in my room to make it seem like no one was in the house.

I watched the Kinsey House through the binoculars. Scanning each window for any sign of movement. As far as I could tell the entire place seemed to have returned to its previous abandonment. None of the lights were on and all the curtains were open. The only sign that someone was home was the car parked in back of the house. After a while some storm clouds rolled in from the waterfront. Rain started to pelt down on the wharf making it difficult to see anything outside.

“I don’t think there’s gonna be any activity tonight dude,” I said.

“Let me check it.”

I handed the binoculars to Logan. I grabbed another slice of pizza and started to go through reels on my phone. I don’t know how long I was swiping for when Logan started to speak up.

“Someone’s coming.”

I went back to the window. A car pulled up behind the Kinseys’ car. Logan couldn’t tell who the person in the raincoat was and I asked him to hand me the binoculars. As I looked through the binoculars, the Kinseys were guiding their visitor into the living room. I knew who she was the moment I saw her blonde hair out of the hoodie.

“That’s Colleen,” I said.

I know Colleen by association. Her husband works with my dad, she works part-time at the library with my mom, and her sons go to the same school as Logan and me. I wasn’t sure why Colleen was in the Kinsey House. But she seemed happy to be there as she smiled down at Rowan.

“What’re they doing with her? Abduction? Experimentation? Possession?” Logan asked.

“Worse,” I said. “They’re having a conversation.”

He gave me an annoyed look as I handed him back the binoculars. I started to think that there was nothing to the Kinsey family. If they were having someone from town over then they were probably trying to make themselves more open to Ample’s residents. Surely, they had nothing to hide if Colleen was visiting them. I went back to playing on my Switch while Logan watched from the window. When I was about to start my next race on Yoshi Island, Logan started to pull me over.

“Dude, they got her,” he said.

“Wha?”

“They got her.” He went back to the window handing me the binoculars.

I checked the window again. The lights were off in the living room. I couldn’t hear anything over the rain and the waves. I focused intently but I could see nothing.

“You see it?” Logan said beside me. I admit I jumped when he spoke. I didn’t know how tense I was until he started speaking.

“I don’t see a thing. What’d you even see?”

“Colleen was laughing for a moment and then…I don’t know. She started to get a weird look then she looked like she was trying to excuse herself and then she fell. I think. She was there and then she wasn’t.”

I didn’t like the sound of that. What Logan was describing sounded serious. There could be a murder next door happening next to us. I was pulling out my phone to call the police. But then the living room light came back on. I looked through the binoculars.

I saw Colleen and Mr. Kinsey standing beside each other. Colleen’s hair looked roughed up but she was smiling. He was speaking to her and she nodded. The smile not leaving her face. It was not the same smile she’d had when she entered. It seemed intense. All her teeth were showing while her lips stretched to her cheeks so fiercely that they could’ve ripped if she forced them any further.

“What’s happened?” Logan asked.

“She’s up,” I said.

“So…she’s okay?” Logan asked.

“I don’t know.”

I lowered the binoculars as Colleen, someone who I’d known since childhood, left the Kinsey House the way she’d come in. An unrecognizable smile on her face as she stepped out, leaving her hair exposed, and drove off in her car.

I had to take a moment to process this. I put the binoculars down, the Mario Kart theme playing in the background, as the lights shut off. I turned around. Frightened as I saw Logan at the light switch.

“Why’d you do that?” I asked.

“They’re looking,” Logan said.

I don’t think I’ve had a truly scary moment in my life. There was one time when I stared down a cliff on a hike with my dad and felt really dizzy staring down at the water crashing onto the rocks below. This was similar to that sensation. I felt the dizziness as my skin started to sweat. I tried to prepare myself for the sight that would greet me as I looked out the window. It was just going to be the neighbors. They were just people. They weren’t anything close to a steep cliff.

It was worse. When I looked through the window, I didn’t need the binoculars to see how the Kinseys’ were smiling. Their mouths were clear enough as they stood behind their couch. While it was difficult to make out and, I think this might be a figment of my scared brain, I remember Mrs. Kinseys’ one blue eye glowing.

I didn’t have long to look at it as the Kinseys’ suddenly laid their heads back on their necks. The motion was so quick that I would’ve thought they’d snapped them if they didn’t keep standing. Logan was back at the window with me as the Kinseys’ raised their arms. The hands loose on the wrists as if there was no muscle in them. They started to flail them back and forth. The motions distorted in the rain.

“Jesus,” Logan whispered.

As the Kinseys’ danced or raved or whatever the hell those motions were, a head started to rise from the couch. It started with the tuft of red hair, then the discolored eyes, followed by a frown. It was an upset child. Rowan. His small body only allowing his head to peek above the couch. The old couple still flailing their arms as their bodies appeared headless. The flailing became more aggressive as Rowan tilted his head questioningly from the window.

“My phone,” Logan said. He was pulling out his phone from his pocket but by the time he got it out the curtains slid closed. I couldn’t tell how they were closed. One minute they were open, the next shuttered.

I turned to look back at Logan. He was setting down his phone and headed for his bag. He stepped on what was left of the pizza. Slipping sauce onto the floor and cursing. He was holding the golden cross and came back with salt in his hand.

“What the fuck, man?” I said as he started to pour the salt onto the window’s ledge.

“We gotta keep it out,” Logan said frantically. “It might try to get in.”

That’s when Dad came back. A box of root beers cradled in his arm. In the span of the Kinseys’ unhinged movements and Logan pouring salt on the window, Dad had returned home. His smile fading to confusion as he took in what must’ve been a strange sight to see his son and his son’s best friend at the window, red sauce streaked across the floor and on the bed sheets, as Logan stopped his line of white on the ledge, and the theme to Mario Kart played in the background.

“Miles,” Dad said. “Please tell me that’s just salt.”

I blurted out that it was and Logan even offered to pour some into his hand to try it. This seemed to ease my dad’s initial fear that I have started to turn junkie. But then we explained what we were really doing while he was out. Logan brought up Colleen being grabbed by Mr. Kinsey only to disappear and reappear like some twisted magician’s trick. I talked about the Kinseys’ movements and even went so far as to demonstrate them for my dad. I think none of this got through to him as he started to seem concerned again. Not from what we were describing but from how it all sounded.

“Let me try that salt,” Dad said.

I yelled at him that we were telling the truth. Logan poured some salt into my dad’s hand. He tasted it. Grimacing after he tried it.

“Okay, Miles. Okay,” Dad said. “You said Colleen was there? She should have a shift with Mom tomorrow. I’ll ask her to ask about it before I leave.”

My dad told us to clean up the sauce and salt as he left the root beers with us. After we’d cleaned, Logan and I spent a lot of time glancing at the window. I didn’t try to go to sleep, neither did Logan. At any moment I expected the Kinseys or their freaky child to appear outside my window. We kept ourselves awake by watching YouTube videos. Logan searched for ones covering the occult and possessions. I listened intently to each bit of information while always making sure the living room curtains were still closed at the Kinsey House.

We didn’t spend the rest of the weekend together. Logan stayed that night but went home the next morning. He told me he needed to do some research. He told me to keep putting salt on the ledge.

“Actually, better do it around the whole house. Just to be safe.”

I told him I would.

My dad did talk to my mom about what happened. She came to my room and made sure I was okay. I think she might be thinking about finding me a therapist. I didn’t argue with her on that. Maybe a therapist really is what I need after what I saw, or think I saw.

Dad already left for the woods with his buddies, Colleen’s husband among them. Mom told me that Colleen had a bad fall at the Kinseys and busted her shoulder pretty bad.

“She was really embarrassed. Has it wrapped up right now,” Mom said. “She was meeting them for a job as their sitter. I’m glad they’re following through on that.”

I wasn’t too comfortable with my mom’s explanation. I still think about Colleen’s face that I saw through the binoculars. Her smile so uncomfortable to look at. My mom said she seems fine but something must have happened. Something must be happening.

In the meantime, I’ve been making sure to pour some salt around the house. I even made a cross out of pieces of wood that I found in the firewood pile my dad keeps next to the house. I’m still waiting to hear back from Logan. He’s been slow to answer my text. I think I’ll have to wait to talk with him at school.
