The Tracks

Hello everyone. Earlier today, I was over at my parent’s house to set up our fireworks. Their whole neighborhood comes out and pitches in for a big party, with all the things you’d expect of a small town 4th of July. Mr. Beckham would cook his stellar, one of a kind ribs with the perfect amount of spice and sweet, Isabel Rockchester would make massive pots of macaroni to feed an army. It was a piece of heaven, and still is today. 

The adults and a few older kids were sitting around a big box fan on my Moms porch, sifting through old Polaroids, low-resolution printed Wal-Mart pictures, and some iPhones being passed around to show all the photos documenting this neighborhoods past. Most of these were baby pictures, specific flowers the older women had been fond of, and holiday gatherings. While sifting through a box of photos labeled “*2012*”, I found something strange. While most of the pictures in this box are subdivided into various mismatched Tubberware boxes and packages, quite a number of them sat on the bottom, loose and scattered around. My hand was drawn to one in particular.

It was a yellowed and worn Polaroid, strange it would be in a box of mostly cheaply printed Blue Bonnet photos and professionally taken football and school pictures. 

I picked it up and smoothed it out on my shirt, trying not to rip the laminate off of it. With this motion came a lot of dirt and unidentifiable dust landing on my hands and shirt. I focused on the grainy and shaky image, trying to make it out. 

Drowning out the conversation everyone else was having, I zeroed in on just the picture. I could see a dusty maroon box and a person in a bright red shirt as the main focus of the image. There are also two more people, each wearing blue and purple shirts respectively. Behind these people stood another person, much taller. They had on an orange shirt.

The identities of the people were impossible to make out, as the image had seemingly been taken from around 35 yards away with minimal magnification. In the way of the shot were also trees and a few blades of grass, almost as if someone had taken it they were crawling or dragging the camera.

I found the image to be weird, but I put it in my pocket, not thinking anything of it. That was, until I found the next photo. It was in a dirty red envelope, and bore no stamp or writing, just the letter “B” hastily scribbled onto the mouth of the envelope.

Delicately opening the fine and fragile paper, as it crinkled in my hands like a leaf, I recognized that inside was another Polaroid, although this one was different. 

The picture was much clearer. It was of 3 kids in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle costumes standing on a porch with their backs turned to camera. The image was, again, taken from further away, but was not shaky or obstructed.

I knew I had to have looked like a ghost, as I began to notice something awful. The house shown in the photo, was my house. The porch I was looking at was the very one I stood on now. 

I felt a chill rattle down my spine, as I instinctively turned around and faced in the direction of where the image was taken from. This is when some memories of that night came flooding back. Something I had tried to forget. The space across from the porch was a power line clear cut, and at the end of the clear cut, sat the train tracks.




It was Halloween night, 2012. Me and my friends at the time, Matt and Tucker, sat on the porch in our costumes. At the time, we were infatuated with Ninja Turtles. We had all the toys, all the games, and pretty much everything we did revolved around the Ninja Turtles. So it was obvious that we would choose to dress up as them for Halloween that year. However, our plan had almost fell through when we realized we didn’t have a Michelangelo. We asked around school for someone to come with us, but everyone else was going as Ninjago characters, monsters, or various action heroes. 

Just when we were going to give up, my dad begrudgingly volunteered to be Michelangelo. He was our hero for the next week or two.

The night of Halloween, Matt and Tucker were walked to my house by their parents, and dropped off. It was still really hot that night, even though the sun had already begun to dip below the mountains. I sweated bullets inside of my costume as we just started our route. Matt and I had spent a week drawing up a plan during our free time at school and in the afternoons. Tucker had generally been absent from this planning time, as he had been at band practice most the time after school.

The night had been pretty normal as far as trick-or-treating goes. We had hit all the houses in our neighborhood, which gave us pretty good full size candy (besides Dr. Miller, who looking back on it, was ahead of his time with those sourdough finger sandwich’s. Crunchy moms would go rabid for those now.). At the end of our Cul de sac we turned around and walked back up the road. We got to the door and my dad opened it to go retrieve his truck keys. Me and my friends stood behind him, hitting each other over the heads with various plastic Oriental weapons. When the door opened up fully, my puppy, Splinter came running out the door. My friends and I found it funny, and found no reason to worry about it, as Splinter was a master ninja warrior and always went out roaming during the day, and nights if we would let him. He always came back to us, no matter what. We’d had him about 4 months at that time, and he knew when to come back for breakfast, belly rubs, and dinner. My mom gave us all a wave as my dad walked us over to the truck. We uncomfortably piled into it, the sound of nylon-on-nylon rubbing filling the truck. We laughed about this noise and replicated it for the 5 minute drive into the town of Jackson Creek, Tennessee.

Living in the sticks meant that our neighborhood was just the warm up for trick or treat, and we had to warm up fast, as the town down in the valley would fill up in no time as kids from all the surrounding towns and suburbs would come streaming in for a quality trick or treating experience. Jackson Creek was the biggest town for about 8 miles in any given direction, and was home to Clancy County’s only public high school and community college. The fledgling town was always pretty busy, even at night, and especially on the weekend. There were as many bars and pubs as there were churches, and as many vape shops as there were Vote Blue signs. For some, a messed up, barbaric place to raise your kids, but for me? It was home.

We spent the night walking around, hitting every store, apartment complex, and pop up canopy behind pickup trucks that would give us something. By the end of the night, we lugged 5 pound trash bags of candy, drinks, toys, and various trinkets up to the parking lot where my dad had left his truck. We piled back in, did our necessary nylon tribal dance, and buckled our seat belts. At this point, the sun had fully dropped below the horizon, and a sky full of stars was visible through the gaps in the not yet dead trees. The southern heat had turned to a soft breeze, and the last crickets and cicadas sang what might be their last songs before a cold front reaped them from the earth.

We arrived home around 10:30, giggling about some dumb joke Tucker made in a mela-tonic state, drowsy from the days fun. There was no school for the next 11 days, as Halloween had luckily fell on a Wednesday and the School Board had decided to just give us our fall break starting on November 1st of that year.

My dad set up the basement for me and my friends, including moving my Xbox from upstairs to the basement and providing two camping cots for Matt and Tucker. 

We promised not to be up all night, but as soon as my dad closed the basement door, leaving us alone in possibly the coziest space of the house, Matt said,

“So, we are totally staying up all night, right?”

“Absolutely!” Tucker laughed out.

“Yeah but, if we get caught then my dad is gonna kill me, and maybe you guys too!” I remarked with genuine concern.

“Yeah whatever, you’re always so afraid to something cool anyway.” Matt said, as he pressed the power button on the Xbox. I sat at the ready with the remote to cut it down before it woke my mom up. We started off with HALO, and Matt wiped the floor with us again and again, until Tucker and I decided to switch us over to Call of Duty. We played well into the morning, until evidently we all passed out playing Call of Duty and eating junk food and candy. 

Around 8 the next morning, my mom came downstairs and called down to us,

“Breakfast is ready if you guys want it!” I shot up first, and my friends followed.

“Last one there is a rotten egg!” I shouted down at Tucker. His legs were a lot longer than mine, and he began galloping up the stairs while laughing. Matt trudged up the stairs behind us, still asleep.

“I made your favorite Sammy.” My mom said. I knew my face was probably burning red. I eeped out to her,

“Mommm, it’s Samuel, remember?” It was just under my breath, but she looked and me and smiled a bent smile. 

I sat down and started digging into my pancakes, topped with raspberry’s, blueberries, and whipped cream. I had scarfed them down and waited for Tucker to finish his 2nd helping of pancakes and for Matt to finish one, evidently sick form the night before. Not me and Tucker, though, we had stomachs of steel. Matt was always afraid of his own cuts and bruises, but I always laugh when I remember Tucker walking back to his house one day after a football game in the green space near the tree line went south, and he broke an arm. Football was then on supervised by a ref (an older sibling disinterested in football or an adult)

We went about the day in ways I don’t recall in detail, but we probably chased around Tucker’s sister and her friends/classmates, who were a grade younger than us. We probably played some kind of made up game, too. “But then again, wasn’t soccer just a made up thing at one point?”, was a point I always made to my parents or other questioning adults when asked what “Ninja Wars” was.

The day that followed this was what stained my memory forever. It was November 2nd, and Splinter had never came home.  We decided to set out on an adventure with my dad to find Splinter, and put new batteries in my dad’s trail cameras. We started close, and after about 3 hours of intense search for any sign of him, we agreed to go with my dad to the local public reserve. He drove us about 30 minutes away and we got out of the truck. The weather was a lot cooler than it was just 2 days earlier, so we had on pants and sweatshirts. The cool autumn air was cutting, and whenever you faced the wind it felt like a thousand knives cutting your face at once. 

We searched every trail our dad would let us, before we started to lose hope. Maybe Splinter really was gone. Maybe…. 




I didn’t want to think about it then, and when I had learned what happened to him I had wished I could just forgot. And for a while, I had.

It wasn’t until I touched the stained burlap bag at the bottom of the cardboard box in front of me that I had remembered. I remembered the night of November 2nd.




We were sitting on my porch, eating hamburgers while Matt and Tuckers parents chatted with mine. They were waiting on their steaks to get off the grill. We were laughing about something funny Tucker had said, along the lines of “Master Chief has nothing on Raphael”. It was a perfect, picturesque fall night. The heat of the grill was enough to make it warm, but not hot, and the breeze was calmed by the cold front moving out.

We heard barking, then ever so faint whimpering. At first we weren’t sure, then it happened a few more times. We all sat silent for a second, in that awkward way everyone does when you are looking for a lost phone that you tried to call to locate. Then it happened, clear as day, I heard Splinter bark, in distress.

I shot up from the rocking chair, probably snapping fibers in the wood. It was coming from the train tracks.

I bolted down the steps, across the street and then the central green space at the end of the Cul de Sac. Then, cutting down the power line, wading through briars and weeds. Tears welled up in my eyes, either from fear or the pain of the plants whipping against my face. Matt and Tucker followed behind by a few seconds, and the adults were just now starting to run towards the tracks. 

I started to cry, face wet with blood, tears, and clammy sweat. I broke through the gap in the overgrowth. I tripped on a loose rock, falling onto my knees and catching myself on my hands. I looked up, and saw a sight that is still cut into my brain as a prayer into a tome. A motionless burlap bag sat on the tracks, stained darkly in the evening. I rushed over to it, my throat on the edge of breaking in sadness. I pulled on the strings of the bag, which were tightly cinched.

Inside the bag, was Splinter. He was cut all over, many of them deep into his skin. His little chest rose rapidly in pain. I picked him up and cradled him. His breathing slowed. He stopped twitching, and he looked up at me. His tail wagged slowly, with its last energy. He panted at me and licked my hand. His held fell into the corner of my arm.

Light had nearly fully faded from the sky, as the sun breathed its final, labored breath, so did Splinter, in my arms.

Matt and Tucker went home that night, and I didn’t talk to them much when we returned to school two weeks later. 




I turned over the first Polaroid I picked up today. It had a “E” written on to it. 

I’ve spent the last hour organizing the various images of me and my friends, of a battered Splinter, and of my cookout, from the perspective of the train tracks. Each had  a letter assigned to its back.

They spelt this:
“Beneath the Oak, you lost the last Spoke.”

I don’t know what this means, and neither does my family. Was I stalked as a child? Why did they hurt Splinter. 

I have so many questions, more than I have answers.

Rest in peace buddy.
