Sonic 2 glitched in a way that shouldn’t be possible

I was eight years old when my dad introduced me to Sonic. He loved the series and wanted me to experience it too. I played a lot back then, but after he died in a car accident, I stopped. It just wasn’t the same without him.

Years passed, and by the time I was 24, I had moved out, gotten a decent office job, and built a stable life. I wasn’t the most social person, but I had a few close friends and a good relationship with my mom and siblings. One day, while walking home, I saw an elderly couple giving away some of their old belongings. Their kids had moved away, and they were downsizing. Among the things laid out was an old Sega Genesis.

I felt nostalgic and asked about it. They said their son used to play it but didn’t want it anymore. I gave them a tip because they were sweet people and took the console home. Wanting to relive some childhood memories, I searched online for a copy of *Sonic the Hedgehog 2.* I was surprised by the prices—most were around $20-$30, but I found one listing for $100. The seller claimed it was a rare edition. It seemed expensive, but I had the money, so I bought it.

When it arrived, I set up the Genesis and popped in the cartridge. The game booted up normally, playing the iconic Sega jingle, but I noticed a small delay before the title screen music started. It wasn’t a long pause—maybe just a few extra seconds—but it felt odd. Still, I brushed it off and started playing.

At first, everything seemed normal. I played as Sonic, running through the first level, expecting *Emerald Hill Zone*. But something was off. Instead of Emerald Hill, I was in *Green Hill Zone* from *Sonic 1*. That shouldn’t have been possible. Sonic 2 didn’t have Green Hill Zone. Even weirder, Tails wasn’t there—Sonic was completely alone.

I kept going, collecting rings, when something small caught my attention. Sonic’s blue color looked darker than I remembered. I thought maybe my memory was off, so I kept playing.

When I reached the end of Act 1 and hit the goalpost, the game suddenly froze. The music cut out, and I couldn’t move. I tried pressing buttons, but nothing responded. Thinking it might just be a dusty cartridge, I took it out, blew on it, and put it back in. This time, it wouldn’t even boot. Annoyed, I gave up for the night, frustrated that I might’ve wasted $100 on a broken game.

The next evening, after work, I decided to try again. This time, the game launched normally, but something was… off. The colors looked slightly muted—almost like someone had turned down the brightness. Even stranger, the intro didn’t play. It just skipped straight to the title screen. I tried starting a new game, but instead of beginning at the usual spot, Sonic was already standing next to the goalpost where the game had frozen the night before.

Now, I was confused. Was this game saving my progress? That shouldn’t be possible—the original Sonic 2 didn’t have save files. But there he was, standing exactly where I left him.

I decided to keep playing, moving on to Act 2. This time, things got weirder. The ocean in the background was gone—just a pitch-black void in its place. Sonic’s blue was now almost black, and the music was missing entirely. My life counter was showing -4.

I had played a lot of old games before, but I had never seen a negative life count. I started to wonder if this was some kind of modded or bootleg version of the game. Maybe the previous owner had altered it somehow. That was the only explanation that made sense.

Then, the game started glitching. Badniks flew in random directions like broken ragdolls, trees were flipped upside down, and the level terrain didn’t line up properly. But the weirdest thing was the grass—it looked almost… real. The texture was too detailed for a Genesis game, like someone had drawn over the pixels with something more lifelike.

The background suddenly flickered, and bright, fast-changing rainbow colors flashed on the screen. I have a sensitivity to flashing lights—it can trigger migraines for me—so I quickly shut my eyes and turned off the console.

I didn’t touch the game again until the next day. I told myself I’d try one last time before giving up on it entirely. When I turned it back on, something new appeared next to the life counter. A message:

**“So, champ, how do you feel? I was right about this game—it’s amazing, isn’t it?”**

I froze. My heart dropped.

That sentence… I knew it.

Those exact words were something my dad said to me when I first played *Sonic 2*. He was standing behind me, patting my head while I played.

I stared at the screen, my hands shaking. How the hell could this game know that?

Then, another message appeared. **“You’re having fun, aren’t you?”**

Tears welled up in my eyes. I didn’t know what to think. Maybe I had mentioned that memory somewhere online? Maybe someone hacked the game? But that didn’t make sense—this was a cartridge, not a digital copy.

Suddenly, the screen flashed again, and when it came back, Sonic was gone. The level had changed—it wasn’t Green Hill anymore. It was the final level, *Death Egg Zone.* The music was replaced with an awful, distorted sound—like something struggling to come through the Genesis speakers. And then Sonic appeared again.

He was standing in the middle of the screen, smiling directly at me.

His body was completely black now, and his eyes were missing. Instead, in their place were hyper-realistic, bloodshot human eyes—staring straight into mine.

Faint screams began to play. They were quiet at first, but they sounded real. A woman. A baby. Crying. Screaming. It was like someone had taken an actual recording and compressed it into the game’s audio.

That was enough for me. I ripped the cartridge out of the Genesis and, without thinking, smashed it against the table. The plastic cracked, the internals exposed. I kept smashing it until it was nothing but broken pieces. Then, I sat there, shaking, trying to process what had just happened.

I still don’t know what that was. A hacked cartridge? A coincidence? A cruel joke? I don’t know.

But I’m never playing Sonic again.
