They say his name is long gone—swallowed by the gold. I didn’t believe any of that until three nights ago. I wasn’t looking for trouble. I was just broke. Tired. Angry. You know that kind of poor where you get mad at things just for existing? That was me. Kicked out of my apartment. Car repossessed. Stomach growling. I was walking past this pawn shop on Vine that’s been closed for years when I saw it.

Not it at first. Just the light. A soft gold shimmer in the gutter, right at the edge of the sidewalk. I bent down. It was a coin. Old, but not dirty. Perfectly round. Heavy in a way that felt… wrong. Like it was full of something.

I turned it over in my hand, and that’s when I noticed the figure standing across the street.

Tall. Golden. Still.

It looked like a statue, but I could feel it watching me. It had no eyes, no face—just a wide, stretched grin. Its teeth were made of rings. Coins. Little trinkets still crusted with the sweat of desperate hands.

It raised its hand slowly—so slowly I thought I imagined it—and pointed at the coin in mine.

I should’ve dropped it. I should’ve run.

But I didn’t.

Because something bloomed in my chest: not fear. Hope. A disgusting, cloying kind of hope. The kind that makes you do things you know are wrong because maybe, just maybe, this is your one shot. I told myself I was smarter than this. That I’d just keep the coin and go.

I turned to leave.

And that’s when I felt it move.

The coin melted. Not in my hand—into my hand. It slid beneath the skin like it had been waiting. My veins lit up with heat. My heartbeat slowed. I dropped to my knees, choking on a breath that wouldn’t come. My skin shimmered. My mouth split open into a smile I couldn’t stop.

I thought I was dying.

Then I heard the voice.

Not outside. Inside. It whispered things I didn’t understand. Numbers. Names. Dates. But I knew they meant something. And I knew they weren’t mine. I was standing again, but I didn’t remember getting up. My hands moved. Not because I told them to—because he did.

The man swallowed by gold.

He’s still in there.

And now, so am I.

We share the same body, but I’m buried deep. I can see through my eyes sometimes, feel my limbs move at night. I watch myself smile at strangers on the bus, hold out my palm, offer the same coin I picked up. It’s always the same words, the ones he said with his last human breath:

“Mine.”

The Glutton doesn’t devour you. It copies you. Spreads like a virus.

You don’t die. You split.

So if you ever see a coin glittering in the gutter, don’t pick it up.

Because you won’t lose your life.

You’ll lose ownership of it.

And you won’t be the only one living in your skin anymore.
