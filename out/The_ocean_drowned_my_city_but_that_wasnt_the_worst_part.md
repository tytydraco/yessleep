I don’t know why I’m finally writing this down. Maybe because the silence is back. Not the normal kind of silence you get at 3 AM when everyone’s asleep. I mean the heavy kind. The kind that feels like something is standing behind you, listening.

People talk about the flood as if it were just a disaster. Like it was wind, bad luck, and water getting too high. But what happened to my city wasn’t just drowning.

It was an erasing.

I lived in Mumbai with my parents in a small apartment above a row of shops. It wasn’t fancy. The paint on our balcony wall was cracked, and the railing had rust stains that never came off no matter how much my mother scrubbed. She always kept plants alive in chipped mugs and plastic bottles. She used to say, “If you can keep something living in a place like this, you can keep anything alive.”

That morning, I was sitting on the edge of the balcony with my legs dangling, eating mango slices she’d cut for me. They were too soft, too ripe, sweet enough to make my teeth hurt. Down in the alley, a fruit vendor was yelling at a rickshaw driver again. Same fight as yesterday. Same insults. Same laugh at the end. A dog barked and chased a plastic bag like it was the most important thing in the world. Somewhere far away a train horn dragged across the sky.

It felt like any other day.

Then my father came home early.

That should’ve been impossible. He worked construction two hours away. Most days he didn’t come back until after dark, tired and covered in dust. But he walked through the door before lunch, soaked in sweat, breathing like he’d been running.

He didn’t even look at me at first. He locked the door behind him. Then he locked it again. Then he dragged the heavy wooden chair from our dining table and jammed it under the handle like he expected something to push its way inside.

My mother turned around, wiping her hands on her kurti. “What happened?”

My father didn’t answer. He turned on the TV.

Every channel showed the same thing.

Waves.

Not normal waves. Huge ones. Black water smashing through roads and swallowing cars. Helicopter footage showing entire buildings disappearing. Reporters screaming over a noise so loud it sounded like the world itself was breaking.

One channel froze on a still image. A woman holding a child, staring at something behind the camera. A wall of water was rising behind her like it had hands.

No sound. Just that image.

“Where is that?” I asked.

My father swallowed hard. “Chennai. Last night.”

My stomach went cold. My mother sat down slowly, like her legs stopped working. Her hand reached for mine without thinking, and her fingers trembled.

“The ocean’s rising again,” my father said. “The storm hasn’t stopped moving. They said it’s moving west.”

My mother didn’t need to ask what west meant, but she did anyway. “Mumbai?”

He nodded.

“They said we’ve got a day,” he whispered. “Maybe less.”

That night, no one ate. We packed bags instead. Rice and lentils, bottles of water, a flashlight with barely any battery left. My mother wrapped clothes in plastic bags like plastic could protect us from the end of the world. My father charged his phone, checked the rooftop ladder, and hammered extra boards onto the door like it mattered.

The power went out before midnight.

The city went dark in sections, street by street, like someone was shutting it down slowly just to watch people panic. The only lights left were candles and phone screens glowing behind windows.

I sat by the window and listened.

No traffic. No music. No neighbors shouting from their balconies. Just wind… and far away, a wet sound, like water moving somewhere it wasn’t supposed to be.

I didn’t sleep. I didn’t even try.

At some point, my mother sat beside me. She didn’t speak for a long time.

“Do you think it’s gonna be bad?” I asked.

She didn’t lie. She never did.

“Yes,” she said.

“Are we gonna die?”

She looked at me. Her eyes were dark and honest.

“I don’t know,” she said.

Then she pulled me close. Her body was warm. Steady. Like if I stayed pressed against her long enough, nothing outside could touch me. I closed my eyes and listened to her heart.

It was the last time I ever heard it.

The wind changed around sunrise. It went from warm to sharp, like something cold had crawled under the city’s skin. The air smelled strange. Not like rain. Like salt and metal. Like the sea was already inside the streets.

We climbed to the rooftop with our bags.

The sky looked wrong. Thick gray clouds churned like they were boiling. Birds flew in wild circles, screaming. The city was quiet in that terrifying way before something terrible happens when everyone knows to shut up and wait.

My father stood at the edge of the roof staring out. His knuckles were white on the railing.

“Anything on the radio?” I asked him.

“Nothing useful,” he said without turning. “Chennai, Nellore, Visakhapatnam… all gone. Kolkata’s trying to evacuate. No one’s answering from Goa.”

His voice cracked slightly when he said it. Just enough to remind me he was still human.

My mother hugged her bag to her chest. “Where are we supposed to go?”

My father didn’t answer.

We all knew the truth.

There was nowhere left to run.

By noon, the streets weren’t streets anymore. Water pushed in from the coast and crawled through alleyways like it was alive. I watched it swallow the market stalls where I used to buy sweets. A man tried riding a scooter through the flood and got knocked over. He didn’t get back up.

More people climbed onto rooftops all around us. Mothers holding babies. Old men carrying blankets. Some cried. Some prayed. One man stared at the sky, whispering to himself as if he’d already lost his mind.

I stayed close to my mother. My hands were cold even though the air was still hot.

Then the sound came.

A deep, low roar.

Not thunder. Not wind.

Something heavier. Like a train, a hurricane, and an animal screaming all at once.

The buildings trembled.

My father whispered, “It’s here.”

At first, we didn’t see the wave. The buildings were too close together. But the sound was enough. Glass shattered from a window nearby. Someone screamed. Then everyone screamed.

And then the water appeared between the buildings like a black wall rising out of nowhere.

It was taller than anything I had ever seen. It moved fast and wide. Trees snapped. Cars flipped like toys. People ran, but there was nowhere to run.

The first building it hit just disappeared.

The second cracked in half.

The third was ours.

“GO!” my father shouted, grabbing the emergency rope ladder.

We climbed as fast as we could.

We weren’t fast enough.

The wave hit like a hammer.

The world exploded into noise. Water slammed into my body and tried to rip me off the rope. I heard my mother scream below me, but the sound was swallowed by the roar of the flood. My father was on the roof yelling something, but I couldn’t hear him.

Then the rope snapped.

I fell into freezing water.

Cold swallowed me. I couldn’t see. I couldn’t breathe. Water shoved into my mouth and nose, burning like poison. Something hit my side, maybe a body, maybe a wall. I kicked and clawed toward where I thought the air was supposed to be.

Hands grabbed me.

Pulled me up.

I broke the surface gasping and choking, screaming without meaning to. It was my father. His face was covered in blood. One eye swollen shut. But he was alive.

Together, we dragged ourselves onto what was left of the roof, a slab of concrete floating in brown water filled with debris and bodies.

I coughed until my throat felt shredded. My father didn’t speak. He kept looking around like my mother was going to climb out of the water any second.

She didn’t.

We found her floating a little away from us. She’d hit her head. The back of her skull was cracked open. She was still warm when I touched her hand.

But she wasn’t breathing.

My father knelt beside her. No tears. No sound. He just stared, like his brain refused to accept what his eyes were seeing.

I looked down at the floodwater.

It was red now.

And I swear… it whispered my name.

We buried her under a broken satellite dish because it was the only thing heavy enough to hold her down. It wasn’t a real grave. Just a desperate attempt to keep the sea from stealing her body, too.

Bodies floated through the streets below. Some bloated. Some tangled in wires and broken wood. Smoke rose in the distance from shattered factories and gas lines. The city smelled like plastic, salt, and blood all mixed together.

My father sat against a wall, eyes closed. Not asleep. Just still.

Hours passed. Maybe more. Time didn’t feel real anymore.

Then we heard voices from a rooftop across the flooded alley.

Low. Male.

“Is that kid still alive?” one of them said.

“Looks like it.”

“Supplies?”

My father stood up instantly. He grabbed a rusted pipe from the ground and pulled me behind him.

“We’re not going with them,” he whispered.

I didn’t understand at first. I wanted to believe people would help each other. I wanted to believe someone would show up with boats and food and rescue lights.

But the way my father said it… he wasn’t guessing.

He knew.

Because the flood didn’t just drown the city.

It drowned whatever was left of people, too.

If anyone’s still reading this… I’ll write what happened next.
