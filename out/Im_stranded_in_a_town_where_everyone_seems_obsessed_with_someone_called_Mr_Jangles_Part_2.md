.....................................................................................

Carla wasn’t at the motel.

I didn’t drive out to check. I called. Spoke to the front desk. They said she never checked in. Never even passed through.

And of course, now I know why…

I woke up later than I meant to. Not sure if it was exhaustion, or the stillness of this place, or maybe just the fact that my body’s finally catching up to the pain. Just before I went to bed, my arm throbbed like hell. I’d left the painkillers in the car and stood there for a long moment, staring at the door, debating whether it was worth it. Then I heard her voice in my head. Mrs. Willes. 

“*Barricade your door. Don’t look out. Don’t answer if someone knocks.”* 

And after what happened just thirty minutes earlier. After someone actually tried to enter my room… well, I bit down and rode out the pain.

Lucy was already behind the bar when I came down, setting up for the day. She had a plate waiting for me. Scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, black coffee. Said she figured I’d need it. I didn’t argue.

As I sat down, I asked her when she locked up the bar last night. She said just after midnight. It checked out. She smirked as she set an expired ketchup bottle on the counter.

“What?” she asked. “Did you hear something, Agent?”

I lifted my coffee, held it there a second. “I believe you already answered that question.” I said. “I heard you locking up. That’s all.”

She raised an eyebrow, leaned on the bar. “He checks in from time to time, you know? New faces tend to wake him from his sleep.”

“That so… What usually draws him out? Mischief? Parking violations?”

“Lying”. She said, smile fading. “He doesn’t like lies”. 

I froze, the fork with egg and bacon halfway to my lips. She looked at me for a second too long, like she was trying to see something beneath my skin.

 “You’re actually serious about him?” I countered, and bit down.

“Of course.” she said. “I’ve met him.”

She told me it was Nadine who introduced them to each other. Just a few months before Nadine was murdered. Nadine had been drawing pictures of him in class. Lucy got curious, so Nadine asked her to come with her after school. Lucy hadn’t believed her at first, thought it was just another stupid prank kids play when they’re bored and want to scare each other.

But Nadine insisted. So she led Lucy down to the creek. And there he was.

Mr. Jangles.

She said he was crouched at the edge of the water, rinsing grime from his hat. He was dressed exactly like in the drawings. His long coat trailed into the shallows, soaking at the edges, but he didn't seem to mind. When he saw them, he straightened. She told me she'd never seen anything like it. He just kept rising, unfolding, until he must’ve been eight feet tall.

He stared at Lucy. He didn’t speak. Neither did the forest. She said everything went quiet all at once. Then, he bowed…

...and began to dance.

A slow, delicate movement. Not joyful. Not menacing. It was somber. Like a ballet dancer performing at a funeral.

“See?” Nadine had whispered to her. And when the dance was over, he bent down, picked a single flower growing by the stream… and offered it to Lucy.

I didn’t press her for more. There was nothing to gain. I just felt sorry for her. They were clearly busting my balls… or just being completely delusional. That’s the thing about local legends. They start as fiction - patches people stitch together when reality doesn’t make sense. But tell a story long enough, and it stops feeling like one. Eventually, it becomes the only explanation that fits. 

Was I starting to believe in him? No... but I was looking for patches to stitch. And right now, Mr. Jangles was the only lead I had. So - at least he’s earned a place in my head.

I thanked her for the food and stepped outside.

That’s when I saw my car.

It sagged to one side, the bumpers practically kissing the pavement. The whole thing looked crooked. It took me a few seconds to realize... the front tires had been slashed. Yeah, I know a knife puncture when I see one, and I sure as hell didn’t hit a nail on the way in. No, these were clean, deliberate cuts. Deep gouges. A precise kind of vandalism.

Rage came up fast and stupid. Same as two days ago. For a moment, I forgot how I ended up in the hospital. I was on a collision course to repeat my mistake. I stormed back into the bar. I could take the side-eyes, the muttering, and all the other small-town bullshit. But someone messing with my Porsche? That crossed a line. My arm might be out of commission, but the other one still works just fine.

Lucy calmed me down, but she wasn’t surprised. “Probably the local skater kids,” she said. “They don’t see cars like that around here.” Then, without missing a beat. “People don’t like strangers who make noise in Maywood. If you’re going to stick around, I suggest you do a better job of blending in.”

She had a point. Since I was unable to drive, she lent me a phone, and that’s when I called the motel.

With no luck tracking down Carla, Lucy helped me get the car towed to the only mechanic in town - Dale Thompson. Fifties. Oil-stained coveralls. Grip like a wrench wrapped in sandpaper. I remembered him from the bar yesterday. He’s the one who stood up when I mentioned Nadine… but then decided to stay. He gave the tires a quick glance and scratched his head. 

“Two days,” he said. “We’re slammed.”

I looked around the shop. It was empty. “I can see that.” I muttered.

He held my stare a moment too long, like he was waiting to see if I had something more clever to say. I folded. Whatever game they were playing, I wasn’t going to win it by pissing off the only guy who could get me back on the road.

With no car and still no sign of Carla, I had no other choice but to start on my own.

Rain was a few hours out, so I hiked into the woods toward the spot where Nadine Willes’ body was found. The distance wasn’t far, but the walk dragged. Maybe I'd just been out of nature too long, but forests like these have a way of stretching space. Every turn looks the same. Every tree. Every rock... and, of course, everything was wet. That deep, bone-soaking damp that seeps into your shoes and socks and stays there. The ground was soft and waterlogged, every step sinking just enough to remind me that comfort was far behind me. Did I have anything positive to say? I guess the forest was beautiful. There’s something about the way trees and animals come alive after rain.

But they knew how little dry time they had left. And so did I. 

I stopped by a shallow creek and held the crime scene photo up to a moss-covered rock. It was the same one. Sunken into the earth like an altar. As I mentioned before, Nadine was laid out on it. Nineteen stab wounds - arms, legs, torso, throat… head. Whoever did it wasn’t in a rush. Didn’t panic. Didn’t try to hide what was done. They stood here... and they took their time.

Sure picked a beautiful place for it.

I'll tell you this - if Mr. Jangles really exists, if he actually did this… then he’s not a ghost story. He’s a sadist.

I took notes as I moved through the clearing, retracing the scene. Tried to picture how it happened. The original cops never agreed on the basics - where she was killed, where she bled out, whether this rock was the murder site or just the stage. Sloppy work, if you ask me. Or maybe just fear disguised as incompetence. Then I noticed something in the mud. A few shoe prints. Women’s size ten.

Carla wears a ten.

I knew that because she once borrowed a pair of my joggers and joked they fit her better than they did me. I crouched down to take a closer look - and that’s when I realized it had gone quiet again.

No wind. No birds. No sound at all. Then, I heard it… keys. Dozens of them. Clinking. Shifting. Moving between the trees.

I spun around - looked everywhere - but there was nothing. Just me. The creek. And the rock. 

Then, all at once, the forest exhaled - the sounds came rushing back, along with something else. Something I hadn’t heard before.

Children’s laughter.

I followed an old game trail through the trees and realized I was closer to the school than I thought. Maywood Mills Elementary - tucked just behind the treeline. I approached the chain-link fence. Kids ran across the cracked blacktop in chaotic zigzags, lost in their own fantasy. That’s when I saw it.

Chalk.

Drawn into the hopscotch squares. His face. His fucking face… The kids were hopping back and forth on it, chanting Nadine’s rhyme.

“Staring at kids like that might get you in trouble.”

The voice came from behind me. A woman - early thirties, warm eyes, cardigan over a frayed dress. “Holly Rogan” she said. “I’m the teacher here.” I introduced myself. Flashed the badge. She didn’t bother to look at it. Of course she knew who I was. The whole town probably did by now.

I gestured to the hopscotch. “I don’t remember me and my friends growing up playing tag around a chalk drawing of Wayne Williams”

She looked at the kids, smiling. “Would you rather they sit at home, scared?” she said. “They’re kids. Didn’t you play Bloody Mary as a kid?”

“I don’t remember Bloody Mary being based on someone who actually murdered people.”

She didn’t respond right away. The kids kept playing.

“I used to think it was just their own little quirky folklore.” she said quietly. “A story adults passed down to keep the kids out of the woods. But I’ve been here five years now. And I’ve seen enough to know…”

She trailed off.

“Wait. You chose to move here? Why?” I asked.

She met my eyes.

“We all have our reasons to disappear, Agent.” Then, she led me inside and called the kids back to class. I hung back a moment and stared at the hopscotch. As the kids filed past behind me, one girl stopped.

“I’ve seen him,” the girl said.

I crouched down. “You have?”

She nodded slowly. “Here. Just a few weeks ago.” She pointed to the fence by the woods.

“Did he say anything to you?” I asked her.

She looked around. Holly was just up ahead, corralling the other kids back into the building.

“He asked me to keep a secret.” she whispered.

“What kind of secret?”

But before she could answer, Holly called her name, and she ran. Disappeared into the school. Holly came jogging back.

“Did Cherry tell you any of her stories?” she said, half-laughing.

“She just wanted to see my badge.” I lied.

Holly nodded, then handed me a scrap of paper. Her number. “If you find anything… anything at all… please don’t hesitate to call. It’d be nice to know we’re not all insane.” Her fingers lingered against mine as she passed the note - just long enough for me to know it wasn’t accidental.

Later, I visited the town’s police station. It was like stepping into a time capsule. Peeling paint, phones with cords, a stack of unpaid parking tickets from the 90s. The desk sergeant snored himself awake as I walked in. Deputy Horace Green blinked at me like I was his first client in years.

“I’m looking into he missing persons cases,” I said.

“Which one?” he asked. 

“How far back do your records go?”

Horace leaned back, scratched his patchy red beard.

“Not far. Fire took most of it a couple years ago.”

“Of course they did... Mind if I take a look at what you have?”

He paused.

“Let me see your badge again.”

I swallowed hard. Pulled it out. Held it steady. Horace studied it… a little longer than I liked. But then he shrugged and stood up.

“I’ll check the back.”

As he disappeared behind the door, I took out my phone. One more try.

I dialed Carla.

The line rang. And then… I heard it. The ringtone. Faint. Echoing from somewhere behind the station. My stomach dropped. But then Horace’s voice rang out from the back. “Yeah? Honey, I’ve told you not to call me at work... yeah, I got a guest... Okay, bye.”

I exhaled. False alarm. He returned a minute later with a dusty old box.

“This is what we got.”

I made my way back to the motel with the files. Out past the tree line, I could see the rain coming - thick, dark sheets crawling across the tree tops. A couple miles off, maybe less. I started romanticizing the evening. Thought about buying a bottle of scotch from Lucy and holing up in my room with the storm. Just me, the files, and a drink strong enough to give me a good night's rest. Maybe I'd call Holly... 

I wasn’t gonna spend the evening with those drunks in the corner booth. Hell, it wouldn’t surprise me if they were the ones who slashed my car. The thought made my blood boil over again. No, I thought it was best if I stayed inside tonight. Alone.

However, when I got back to my room, I stopped cold. There was a note taped to the door. Just two words.

THE DAM.

I stood there for a long time, listening to my own breath. The muffled clink of glassware downstairs. The raspy cough from the jukebox. Somewhere far off, thunder rolled. Then I did it.

I went out.

I shouldn’t have. I knew that even as I peeled the note off the door and folded it into my pocket. I should’ve listened to my gut and waited for daylight to make things feel less… intentional.

But curiosity has always been my worst habit.

The rain hit hard. It came down like a hammer, cold and relentless. Within minutes, I was soaked through. My cheap jacket did its best to keep me warm. The roar of water hitting the canopy got louder with every step - a constant, swallowing sound that made it hard to concentrate. Like the forest itself was trying to hide whatever was waiting out there to attack me in the dark.

When I finally reached the dam, my instinct told me to stay back. So I ducked into the brush.

The dam looked old. Very old. The structure slumped against the earth. Rust bloomed across the iron gates, and half‑collapsed steel beams jutted out at odd angles. Moss and rot clung to everything. A monument to erosion, held together by sheer stubbornness. A thin sheet of black water had pooled beneath the structure.

That’s when I caught the flash of a light. I ducked down and squinted through the wet leaves. 

Two men were wading knee‑deep in the shallows, flashlights sweeping across the water. As my eyes adjusted, I recognized them. It was Horace and the handyman from the bar. They were calm. Focused. Talking low. Their lights skated across the dam’s surface like they were searching for something just beneath it. Fortunately, they hadn’t seen me.

I stayed hidden, snapped a couple of photos with my phone, my hands shaking more from adrenaline than the cold. Whatever they were doing, one thing was clear - it wasn’t meant to be seen.

I didn’t wait around to find out more. I turned back, and left while I still could.

On the way back, I climbed a steep, muddy incline. The rain had carved thin waterfalls through the dirt, washing away leaves and debris, exposing roots and stones that hadn’t seen daylight in years. I was one Dilophosaurus away from being Dennis Nedry in Jurassic Park...

That’s when something caught my eye.

A glint of leather, lodged in the tangled roots of a bush. Half‑buried. Caked in mud. I knelt down and brushed away the soil… and a cold weight sank into my gut like wet cement.

It was Carla’s badge.

Damaged. Peeling. But her photo was still there, her face staring up at me through the fogged plastic.

She’d been here.

That’s when the world went quiet again. Not the water - I could still hear that, pounding and endless - but everything else vanished. Then I felt it….

Eyes.

So I turned.

And there he was. A good distance away, standing just inside the tree line.

Mr. Jangles.

The rain streamed down the tall hat on his head and ran in dark lines along his coat, dripping from the hem like he was melting into the ground. His smile was wide, packed with what looked like hundreds of small, uneven teeth. But worst of all were his eyes… hollows black as coal, devoid of life - empty pits that seemed to swallow all light around them.

He didn’t move. He just watched me.

Then he began to move. Not a lunge. Not a step. No…

He danced for me.

Slow. Controlled. Graceful. Almost... reverent. His arms swept through the air, his feet gliding soundlessly across the soaked forest floor. It was a performance for an audience of one.

I couldn’t look away.

Each movement brought him closer. Not by much. Not enough to notice at first. But closer all the same. Then, he vanished behind a tree...

That's when the cold hit me. The rain. My boots. The ache in my arm. The weight of my body. The world came crashing back all at once. I gasped, stumbled back, and ran. I didn’t stop to look over my shoulder. I didn’t stop to think. I don’t know what took over me, but I ran like my life depended on it - because whatever that thing was, whatever game he was playing…

...my gut was certain he wasn’t going to bring me flowers.

Here I am. Happy to report that I’m back in the relative safety of my little rented room. The door is locked. This time, I’ve wedged a bureau against it… and I’m alive. Freezing - but alive.

I’ve spent the last hour going through the files I’ve got from Horace, and something doesn’t add up. The missing people over the years? They weren’t just kids. They are teenagers. A woman in her thirties. A couple of elderly, men and women. And that’s what bothers me. 

Most serial offenders -  killers, kidnappers - they have a type. A demographic they fixate on. Age. Gender. Color. There’s usually always a pattern… something that ties the victims together, even if it’s not obvious at first. But here? There’s no consistency. No common thread I can see.

Then again, I guess those are human patterns… and I don't think he's human.

Am I starting to believe in him? Am I starting to believe in Mr. Jangles?

I saw him in the woods. That's for sure. I won’t pretend otherwise…

And maybe that’s why I’m going to tell you truth. The full truth.

You’re probably wondering why an FBI agent is panicking in a barricaded motel room instead of calling for backup. Why I haven’t brought in more resources. Why I’m not already on the phone with Quantico.

Well, I’m not an FBI agent.

I’m not a cop. Not even close. And neither is… was Carla. We host a true-crime podcast together - The Dark Report. Maybe you’ve heard of it. If you have, it was probably for the wrong reasons. One of our episodes went viral last year - the wrong kind of viral. It didn't just stir up controversy...

It ruined someone's life... or took it, I guess.

And the fallout has been eating me alive ever since. My inbox is a graveyard of lawsuits. My name is dirt. My reputation - dust. Everyone that I’ve ever worked with has turned their back.

Hell, I turned my back. I traded my morality for clicks.

So yeah - I came here to resurrect my career. The story of Maywood Mills is a story no one has covered before. At least, as far as we could tell. I saw this as my one last shot. A chance to prove I'm more than the asshole who got someone killed. And now… I’m terrified my instincts may have cost me the only person who ever stood by my side.

I don’t feel safe anymore. And I don’t know what to do.

I’m stranded in Maywood Mills.

“He comes for those who dare to stray… to never see the light of day”

Mr. Jangles. They blame him for everything. The disappearances. Nadine. The town’s rot.

They say he doesn’t like lies.

Well…

I think they’re all lying.
