I own and operate my own print shop.

Most of the orders I receive from people are online, usually including wedding invitations, custom stickers, awkward school photos, and designed posters we ship off once they're printed and packaged up. Admittedly, owning a print shop isn't the most exciting career in the world, but it puts food on the table for me and my family.

Last Monday, I came into work and started by looking at my backlog of customer emails. The first one I saw when I booted up my computer was from an ID named facelisting@finalproofs.co.

The email read, "I need these images printed at 11x14 on matte paper (200 gsm). Each page needs to have a half-inch white border around the photo. Then, I need you to bind them with coils into a book. I want a front page for this book with a title in the center that reads, in cursive, 'Faces in Passing: Volume 1'. Let me know how much I owe you for one copy. Accuracy is critical."

Very specific. This person knew what they wanted.
Attached to the email was a zip file with about thirty pictures, each photo of a different person. None of them particularly resembled fashion models; they looked like ordinary people.

Some men and women looked to be in their 20s, 30s, 40s, or higher. There were also a few kids and teenagers in the collection.

I figured it must've been for a community-related project, like some college kid's photography class or something. Some shots were close-ups of people smiling, others appeared to be photographed from a little further away, and a few looked like drawings.

The sketched ones irked me a little. But as long as this person paid me, I didn't see any real issue.

I emailed them back, "Good afternoon! Shouldn't be an issue. An estimate of one copy with shipping will cost approximately $28.42. Here's a link to where you can send your payment."

Immediately, I got an alert on my phone for one payment of $28.42. So, I printed off the book and got it all ready, then a USPS worker came and picked it up along with the other packages that UPS didn't pick up.

Done, and done.

The next morning, I woke up bright and early to find my wife sitting in the living room and drinking her morning coffee. She was looking at her phone while the news played on the TV.

"Authorities are still struggling to locate 27-year-old Sarah Mitchell, who was last seen leaving her apartment on Upper Glenway two weeks ago. She's described as 5'6, with brown hair and green eyes. Anybody with information is urged to contact the local police department immediately. Family and friends are deeply concerned for her safety and are praying that she comes back home soon. Here's a photo of the missing person," said the news anchor.
I looked over at the TV and saw her face. She looked familiar.

It took me a minute to realize I had seen her before. I saw her in the file that the unknown email sent me yesterday.

Why would this person send me a photo of a missing person?

I got to work after that, and out of curiosity, I pulled that file up again. Looking through, I stumbled on Sarah's photo again.

Doing reverse image searches on some others revealed something cryptic to me. They were all missing people.

Haunting portraits of these lost individuals illuminated my screen. Some of these were Jane or John Does; they were never identified.

Whoever was on the other end of this email was using these pictures for something. Whatever that was, it was beyond me.

Were they somehow connected to the missing persons? I took everything I had to the police right away.

An officer said he looked into the email, but it was untraceable, and the address I sent the package to was a house with no residents.

I asked if there was anything else they could do, but he told me they couldn't do anything since no crime had been committed.

A week or so went by when I received another email from them.

"I need another book. Same deal as before, but this time put 'Volume 2' instead. Only one copy is needed. Payment has been sent," they said.

Before I responded to this, I looked at the zip file attached. One of the pictures was of my wife.

I panicked and pulled my phone out to call her, but she didn't pick up. I called so many times, but still no response.

I sped home, but couldn't find her anywhere when I got home. Her car was still here, and her phone, purse, and keys were on the living room table.

It's been weeks, and I haven't heard anything regarding my wife. The police have been no help; they keep telling me there are no leads and they can do nothing.

I reached out to the mysterious email and pleaded with them. I said I would even pay money if that's what they wanted.

The only response I got was another request for a book. When I opened the attachment this time, I saw a police sketch among the other missing people.
It was a John Doe sketch of me
