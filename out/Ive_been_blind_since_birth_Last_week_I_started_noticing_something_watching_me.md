I know how this is going to sound. I’m not stupid. I know Reddit isn’t exactly the best place for a blind person to talk about “seeing things.” That’s the point. I’ve been blind since birth. Total blindness — zero light perception, nothing. My world is touch, sound, smell, memory, and routine. I’ve never “seen” anything, not even in dreams. Not even once.

Until last week.

And now I think I’m going to die.

I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment on the sixth floor of a pretty standard building in the city. I have a system — keys always clipped to my belt, guide stick by the door, phone with voice-over, everything labeled with tactile stickers. I don’t need help. I walk my block with muscle memory. I know the elevator by the sound of its grind, and I can feel when a neighbor’s perfume lingers in the hallway.

That’s how dialed-in I am to my environment.

So when something changes… I notice.

It started five nights ago. I woke up around 3:00 a.m. with this weird sense — not a noise, not a smell, just a presence. Like something was there in the room with me.

I thought maybe my neighbor’s cat had gotten in again. It’s happened before — little bastard slips through cracked doors. I sat up in bed and called out. “Hey… anyone there?” I felt for the edges of my blanket. My hand trembled.

Nothing. Just still air.

Then I felt it. Like a shape in the room. Like how you can feel when someone’s standing too close behind you, even without hearing them breathe. But worse. It felt wrong. Like its shape didn’t match anything that should be able to stand upright. Too tall, but narrow. And still. Too still.

I froze. Every hair on my arms stood up. I reached out into the empty air — and felt nothing. But in my chest, I could feel it… watching me.

Not seeing. Watching.

The next morning, I laughed it off. Sleep paralysis, maybe? A dream I didn’t know I was dreaming? I have a therapist, and I told her. She asked if I was stressed. I said yeah, a little. My job’s been weird lately, and sometimes the city noise gets under my skin.

But the next night… it came back.

Same time. 3:00 a.m. Same presence.

I kept my eyes open — which sounds weird, I know — but when you’re blind, “eyes open” just means “facing the dark.” I laid there, breathing slow, trying not to move.

And this time, it moved. It shifted closer.

The air in the room changed, like it dragged something with it. The pressure. The silence. The texture of the nothing around me.

Then I heard it. Not a word. A sound. A click. Soft. Deliberate.

It had joints. And it was cracking them like fingers.

I haven’t slept since Tuesday. I pretend I’m not home at night — headphones on, lights on (though that’s for the neighbors, not me). But I know it still comes. I feel it standing just outside the room. Sometimes I hear it dragging its hand across the walls. Sometimes I hear it whispering in a voice that sounds like mine.

Yesterday, I knocked over my coffee mug in the kitchen. When I bent to pick it up… I swear I felt something cold brush the back of my neck. A finger. Long. Smooth. Curious.

Tonight, it did something new.

It knocked.

Three times. Slow. On the inside of my bedroom closet.

I haven’t opened that door in a week.

I don’t know what it wants. But it’s learning. It’s figuring out how I move, how I live. How I try to ignore it.

And now I think it knows I can sense it. That I’m not just a blind person to it anymore. I’m… something else.

A mirror? A target?

If you’re reading this, you probably think I’m crazy. I would too. But something is in my apartment. It wasn’t there before. And every time it comes back, it gets closer.

I don’t think I have much time left.

If it touches me again — if it climbs into bed like I think it did last night — I won’t survive it.

Please, if anyone’s heard of something like this… tell me what it is.

Because I swear I never used to see anything.

And now I can’t stop sensing it.

Quick note up top: Yes, I’m still alive. No, I didn’t sleep. Yes, it came back.
And now I know for sure: it knows I can sense it.
It’s not pretending anymore.

At 2:58 a.m., Willow — my dog — started growling at the closet. Not barking. Growling. Real low. She never does that. She pressed into my legs like she wanted me to pick her up, and I could feel her trembling.

And then I felt it again.

Not outside. Not in the hall.

Inside the closet.

It stood up.

The pressure changed. Like the shape of the air shifted. Something tall. Taller than a person. Narrow, jointed. I could feel its form — not by touching it, but by how it bent the room around it.

And then came the voice.

It didn’t speak like a human. It didn’t even make sound. The voice was inside my thoughts. Echoed with my own tone.

“You’re not supposed to know I’m here.”

It sounded disappointed. Like I ruined a surprise party.

Then it moved — up. Onto the ceiling. It didn’t climb. It just… changed location.

And it began matching my breathing.

I called my therapist in the morning. Told her I was “noticing things.” She asked, calm as anything:

“Has it started interacting with you directly?”

I said yes. I asked if she’d ever heard of this before.

Her answer chilled me more than the voice did.

“Some people, especially blind from birth, may perceive things the rest of us can’t.
If something doesn’t want to be perceived… noticing it gives it shape.”

She told me not to sleep in silence.

“It listens better when it’s quiet.”

And then she hung up.

I tried staying out. Took Willow and found a diner. Ordered coffee I didn’t need. Sat with my back to the wall.

Around 4 a.m., the waitress came by. Refilled my cup.

And as she placed it down, its voice came out of her mouth.

“You shouldn’t be able to notice me.”

Then she walked away like nothing happened.

This morning, while brushing my teeth, I felt it.

Not behind me. Not beside me.

In front of me.

Too close.

And in that space — not with eyes, but with something else — I saw it.

A face. My face. Grinning wide.

It hovered there. Inches away.

No breath. No warmth. Just… watching.

I dropped the toothbrush and ran. I slammed the door. I couldn’t scream.

I don’t know what this thing is.

But I know this:

I was blind my whole life.

And now I can see one thing.

Just one.

And it’s getting closer.

If you’re reading this… it means I lived long enough to hit “post.”
I don’t know if I’ll be alive when you read it.

I don’t know if I should be.

At 2:51 a.m., I felt it coming.

Not like before — not from the closet.

From the building itself. Floor by floor. Closer.

I stood in my living room. Heart pounding. Willow shaking at my feet.

And then… silence.

Real silence.

Like reality stopped vibrating.

Then its voice came — behind my thoughts:

“You called me into shape. Now you have to see.”

And suddenly, I saw everything.

Not the world. Not the room.

It.

All of it.

A body made of space. Skin stretched over nothing. Long arms. Twisting joints.
No mouth — but still, it smiled.

And then it touched my forehead.

I blacked out.

When I woke up, I couldn’t move. My ribs are broken. My mouth tastes like blood.

The closet door is open.

And I heard my voice — my exact voice — say from outside:

“I’m going to work.”

It wasn’t me.

It said it perfectly.

It’s out there now.

Wearing me.

I was blind my whole life.

And now I can see it.

That’s all it ever wanted.

To be seen.

To be real.

And now… it is.

Edit:

Hey guys!
Haha wow 😅 just found this old post — honestly no idea what I was thinking. I’ve stopped drinking, feeling way better now. Clear-headed for the first time in a while.

I think I was having a rough patch or something?
All that weird spooky stuff… definitely just stress or sleep-dep or something.
Kinda embarrassing, honestly lol.

If anyone knows how to delete a post, please DM me.
Don’t want anyone getting the wrong idea or thinking I’ve lost it 🤦‍♂️

Anyway, thanks for reading I guess.
Hope you’re all doing well.
