My travels through my life had left me lost. / My masters in Poetry left me broke. / Unable to find any will to write, / I felt as if I was not but a ghost.

I was told "You Need some inspiration" / "Go and read a new book for some ideas." / I figured there was no harm in trying. / Plus I'd been inside for what felt like years.

The blinding sun bore down like a tyrant. / My blue-light damaged eyes could barely stand. / Over 20 hours in a word doc, / Was enough to break the strongest of man.

With income that was in the negative, / I did not have much change to throw around. / Knowing I could not buy anything new, / I had a place in mind that was downtown.

The used book store near me has tons of deals. / Searching through I found this book of poems, / Deep in the bottom of the clearance bin. / The title read, "The Whispers of the Thames"

The name on front read William Shakespeare. / I'd never heard his name on such a work. / The yellow cover aged and bleached by sun, / Pages edged by gold now covered in dirt.

I'd ne'er seen a book in quite ill a shape, / Though many that they sold could be quite worn. / Carefully I flipped to a random page / And from that moment my eyes shan't be torn.

I fingered through, my hands ravin'd, enticed, / Soaking in text as air deep in my lungs. / My eyes entranced I barely risked a breath. / For on e'ery syllable my heart hung.

The story spoke of secrets lost to time. / A river giving truths to those who pray. / A playwright who knew he could not resist, / The story of a long forbidden play. 

This man wrote down the secrets now revealed. / He wrote it down in ink til it ran dry. / His feathered pen ran red, his body torn, / Swearing that he would finish or he'd die. 

The man who's mind was weak unlike my own. / He spoke of hunger unable to sate. / He read the play for days and days on end, / Until all the was left was book and bone.

Beyond my weary eyes the sun went down. / Entranced, I'd not marked that an hour'd passed. / Engrossed in stories, kings and masquerade, / Their sunset twice as bright beyond the vast.

A man's voice shouted over crashing waves. /  He spoke as if I deaf or slow to learn. / As though I was a bother in his way, / His words lacked much, drones of unpregnant scorn.

"Come on man, we're ten minutes passed our close. / Do you think that you can, like, get out now? / All my guys left, told me to lock up when / I could get you to put that damn book down."

With Iv'ry fists I clenched my treasured tome. / What felt like hours, unable to speak. / My thoughts unworthy til embraced in gold, / I finally let out a cracking squeak.

"I shan't abandon this pure work of art. / I'd rather be found in Hell's deepest ring. / For I know that there is no greater pain. / Than that of separation from my king."

I'd been unable to conjure more words. / At least none that I knew would be approved. / The thought of speaking out of line absurd. / I'd rather silence than let filth consume. 

The man reached down and pulled out his device, / He tapped three numbers, then begun the ring. / A whisper from the Thames engulfed my mind. / "You best not let him disobey your king."

As though my body was not of my own, / I felt my legs alight with grace and poise. / For I knew not what horrors were in store, / If I were not to stop that horrid noise. 

To vanquish those who would stand in his way, / I heard his honeyed voice like rays of sun. / My arms outstretched I lept onto my prey, / And held him down, windpipe under my thumb.

His heartbeat thumped in synchrony with mine. / His screams drowned out by ringing in my ears. / As if the lord himself agreed with me, / I saw his yellow robes within his tears. 

I laughed as I felt him limp under me, / His face a simular of storied masks. / Letting go, my mind finally at ease, / Searching for the book became my next task. 

Papers strewn from where my fists had unclenched. / Seams that due to time had come unraveled. / Pages cracked to dust as I grabbed for them. / For I knew not where my king had traveled. 

Final words I'd read had left me searching. / Looking for his gilded crown and shawl. / My brain rings with the King's shames and cursings, / That I have not fulfilled his final call.

Please, if you are out there and you're reading, / If you know any place to find this story, / Deliver me from my pains of pleading, / Help me bring my king to his full glory.
