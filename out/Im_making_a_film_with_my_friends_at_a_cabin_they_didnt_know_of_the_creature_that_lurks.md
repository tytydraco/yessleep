Hello, I'm Mark, and last summer I had a terrible experience. I'm a student at a small liberal arts college. I am part of a film club and have decided to spend my summer break making a movie with students of my club, also friends of mine.

We have rented a cabin in the woods, far from any civilization, to use as our base of operations. So we pack our things and get ready for a "road trip" I suppose.

"Are we there yet?" Ashley asked, sounding bored.

"No, not yet." I replied, trying to hide my own impatience. "It's going to be another hour or so before we reach the cabin."

"Ugh, this is taking forever.." Alexander said, stretching his legs. "I can't wait to get out of the car and start exploring."

"Me too!" Mary agreed. "I'm so excited to start filming for our movie. It's going to be epic!"

"I hope so!" I said, feeling a surge of excitement. "This is our chance to make something really special."

"And it's going to be so much fun!!" Ashley added. "We're going to have the best time ever in the woods!"

We continued to chat and joke as we drove deeper into the wilderness, eager to reach our destination and start our adventure. I miss all of this, our joy to explore the forest, I wish this didn't have to happen to us.

Eventually we made it. I swung open the trunk and grabbed two duffel bags of our equipment, I believe it was tripods and stuff.

"Come on! Grab some stuff and let's get inside!" I yelled, smiling. And they did just that, grabbing  some bags too.

When we entered, the place looked just as expected.

The cabin was small but cozy, with wooden walls and a thatched roof. It had one main room that served as a living area, kitchen, and bedroom. There was also a small loft upstairs where we could sleep.

In the center of the room was a fireplace, where we could keep warm on cold nights. The windows were covered with curtains, and the furniture was old but comfortable.

Despite its rustic appearance, the cabin had all the amenities we needed, including a gas stove, running water, and electricity. We had stocked up on supplies before arriving, so we had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.

Overall, the cabin was the perfect base of operations for our movie-making adventure. We were excited to spend the next two weeks there, exploring the surrounding wilderness and creating our masterpiece.

 "Wow, this place is amazing!" Mary said, looking around the cabin. "I can't believe we have it all to ourselves for the next two weeks."

"It's perfect.." Ashley agreed, setting down her bags. "We have everything we need here to make our movie!"

"And it's so cozy," Alexander said, starting a fire in the fireplace. "I can't wait to relax and unwind after all the driving."

"Me too." I said, feeling a sense of contentment. "This is exactly what we needed."

"I know, right?" Mary said, smiling. "We're going to have the best time here!"

We spent the rest of the day unpacking and setting up our equipment.

"Ok, let's set up the camera here!" I said, pointing to a spot in the corner of the room. "It will give us a good view of the whole cabin."

"And we can set up the lights over here." Alexander said, carrying a tripod over to the opposite corner. "It will help us get the right lighting for our scenes."

"And we can put the microphones on these stands." Mary said, setting up two stands near the center of the room. "It will help us capture the audio for our dialogue."

"This is going to be great!" Ashley said, smiling. "I can't wait to start filming." 

Ashley is a very cheerful and kind person, I'm glad she was my friend before this stuff happened.

We made sure that everything was in place and ready to go. We were excited to start our movie-making adventure, and we couldn't wait to see what we would create.

Except, strange things start to happen. We hear eerie noises outside the cabin, and when we look out the windows, we see something moving in the darkness.

At first, we brush it off as our imaginations get the better of us. But the next morning, we find strange footprints outside the cabin, and some of our equipment is damaged.

"Okay, I'm sure there's a logical explanation for this!" I say feeling a bit stressed.

Mary scoffs and says, "Yeah! Logical my ass! What are even those tracks we saw? I swear we are leaving tomorrow, that's that!"

Alexander followed up, "Mark, we can do our movie somewhere else. Let's pack up and go."

Ashley only nods, not speaking.

"Fine, okay, let's just go then." I say sighing. The movie won't be as cool now but our safety is more important.

Tomorrow arrives and we pack up and leave. But as we are loading the car, the thing that has been stalking us reveals itself. It is a Wendigo, a mythical creature from Native American folklore. I actually know a lot about them from a video game. Perhaps you guys know.

The Wendigo is tall and gaunt, with pale skin stretched tight over its bones. Its eyes are glowing red orbs, and its mouth is filled with sharp, jagged teeth.

We are frozen with fear as the Wendigo approaches us. But we know that we have to do something if we want to survive. So we ran away, we ran to the cabin.

I make it in first, Ashley, Alexander, and Mary follow.

"What the fuck was that thing!?" Alexander asked, his voice shaking with fear, bracing the door.

"I think its a Wendigo man!" I replied, trying to keep my own fear in check. "I'm… What are we going to do!?"

"We have to get out of here!" Ashley said, grabbing her backpack. "Whatever that thing is, it's not stopping."

"But where do we go?" Mary asked, her eyes wide with fear. "We're in the middle of nowhere, and that thing is outside, with our car!"

"We'll figure it out! God damn it Mary!" I said, my voice breaking upon the pressure of our situation.  "I'm sorry, we just have to stay calm and think."

"Easier said than done," Alexander muttered, clutching his monopod.

We heard the Wendigo again outside the cabin, banging against the door and. It was trying to get in, and it was only a matter of time before it succeeded.

"Are you stupid? That isn't going to dent it!" I said, voice filled with fear. "We will have to make a break for it!"

"I can't, I can't fucking do this!" Mary asked, tears streaming down her face.

"Mary calm down!" I said. "We have to outsmart it- Well, we'll have to try."

"Oh my god, we're going to die!" Mary said, her voice trembling. "We can't fight that thing. It's too strong!"

"We just have to make a run for it." I said, trying to sound calm, I definitely wasn't. "If we don't, it's going to kill us."

"But we don't stand a chance, it's faster than us for sure." Ashley said, her eyes filling with tears. "It's going to rip us to pieces."

"We have to stay calm," Alexander said, his voice shaking. "If we panic, we're finished."

"But how can we stay calm?" Mary asked, her voice breaking. "We're about to just run from a monster."

"What else do we do? Fight it and die?" I said, feeling my fear continuously rise. "We have to run for our lives."

The Wendigo found one of the windows and broke through that, and we saw our opportunity. I took the car keys and shoved Alexander away from the door.

"Fucking run! Just run!" We all made a break for it, but I suppose Ashley was too slow. It got a hold of her.

I want to say we rushed in there to protect and save her, but we were all too scared and left her for dead. The Wendigo disappeared into the trees with her, leaving us behind to mourn her loss. We are devastated and terrified, knowing that the creature is still out there, hunting us.

The three of us went to the car as quickly as we could.

"Go go! Fucking- Fucking drive!" Mary yells at me.

I reply frantically, fumbling with the key. "I'm trying! Don't yell at me asshole!" I eventually get it in, and I twist the ignition to on and immediately step on it.

Alexander is looking down at the ground, monopod still in hand.

"We… We just left her… We left Ashley.."

I was focused on the road but I could only assume Alexander was crying.

"Alex, I-"

"DON'T CALL ME ALEX! YOU GOT HER KILLED! THIS MOVIE WAS YOUR IDEA!" Alexander lashes out and starts shaking me.

I swerve the car but manage to keep on the road. Alexander realised the dangers and stopped.

"Alexander.." I said sadly.

We stay silent the rest of the way, immediately filing a missing persons report as no one would believe us. Ashley never showed, I can only assume she's dead.

The movie we were making is forgotten, replaced by the horrors of that night in the woods.

Me and Alexander don't chat anymore, I did get Ashley killed, I wanted to make that movie, and I knew of the rumours of the monster lurking in the woods.
