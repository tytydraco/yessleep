I’m starting this story by saying I didn’t do it.

I know it’s weird to open with that, but I need you to believe me before the media sinks its claws in.

Because the second you see my face splashed across TikTok or my life dissected on some true crime podcast, you’ll stop thinking clearly. You’ll stop trusting that I didn’t kill Denise.

For Christ’s sake, she was a guest in my house.

Yes, she died there. And yes, I barely knew her or even liked her that much. But come on… why would I murder someone *in my own home*? That’s insane.

Denise was new in town, and I only invited her to my Wine Wednesday party because my husband insisted. “It’s not a good look if you invite all the other moms from our son's class and leave her out,” he said.

So, reluctantly, I asked her right at the school gate while picking up my kid. Her face lit up when I did, and I actually felt sorry for her. 

Ever since she moved in with her son, people had been whispering. You know how small towns are. No place for a single mom, especially not one as pretty as Denise.

The other moms hated how she looked. Her curves, her hair, her eyes… they couldn’t stand it. Not me, though. I didn’t care. 

But Tanya, my friend, told me her husband had been chatting with Denise, smiling too wide, offering to help her with her car or whatever. Thank God Thomas, my husband, would never do something like that. And if he did, I wouldn’t just brush it off like she does.

Anyway, I’m getting off track. Let me tell you what happened that night. At least what I remember.

\*\*\* 

She showed up around six with a nice bottle of Italian wine. The other women welcomed her just fine, and it looked like her shot of being accepted. 

That night was girls-only. “No men allowed” was our only rule, and it was supposed to be when we moms could drink, chat, and dance freely.

Thomas usually hated it. He’d normally just leave to meet friends at the bar, but that time he just locked himself in the bedroom. 

Denise was lively and charming there. Quick with the jokes, generous with the wine. For a moment, I thought she might actually click with the group.

And honestly, it really hit me how beautiful she was at the party, especially when I remember what her cold body looked like lying in the garden the next morning.

It was so...

Never mind. Let’s keep going.

\*\*\*

So, yeah. Some of the girls got a little too excited during the party, including Denise. Drinking way too much, dancing like teenagers, begging me to put on more upbeat music.

The mood shifted after the alcohol kicked in. It became a different party, one I didn't enjoy as much.

But what really set me off was when I came back from the bathroom and saw Thomas downstairs, helping the girls with their drinks.

The way he handled Denise’s glass made my stomach turn. So delicate. So careful. Like it was some kind of ritual.

I hated it.

He saw me watching and went straight back upstairs. “I was just thirsty,” he whispered. “I won’t come down again.”

And he didn’t, but the party was already ruined for me.

I slumped on the couch next to Tanya and watched Denise and the others dancing to whatever 90s pop song was on.

That’s when I noticed Denise starting to fade. 

It happened fast. Too fast. Her eyes started fluttering mid-song, like she was struggling to focus. Then she stumbled onto the floor, dizzy.

We brought her water and tried to keep her upright. She looked wasted, even though I swear I hadn’t seen her drink nearly enough to justify that.

When Thomas heard the commotion he came back down. “We should let her rest in the guest room,” he advised.

I didn’t love the idea, but what choice did I have? Better that she rest and go home later in one piece.

So we took her to the room, laid her on the bed, turned off the lights, closed the door, and got back to cleaning up the mess from the party.

That was the last time I saw Denise alive.

\*\*\*

I definitely didn’t hear what the neighbors claim they did that night.

No struggle. No scream. Nothing.

I just woke up early, went to the kitchen to make some coffee, and saw her through the window lying there in our yard, near the garden. Thomas was already downstairs, calling 911. His eyes were wide, red, panicked. He told me he’d seen Denise kill herself.

But no one in town really believed him. Her body showed clear signs of a struggle.

Her nails were broken, she had a deep slash on her wrist, and a blade in one hand, the alleged cause of death.

Thomas said that’s how she did it, and he saw it happen. But the police report didn’t prove him right or wrong. In fact, it proved nothing.

The neighborhood started muttering about how the police chief, Thomas’s childhood friend, might have looked the other way.

And so, they came up with their own crazy theories of what happened.

The first one?

*That I’d done it*. Tanya, that two-faced bitch, started telling people I’d been glaring at Denise the whole night. That I killed her out of jealousy because of the way Thomas looked at her.

You can still find plenty of Reddit threads out there defending that lunatic version.

The second theory? That’s the one the media ran with:

*that Thomas had done it.*

That he drugged her drink, the careful glass he handed her, and tried something that night.

She resisted. He panicked and killed her somehow, then made it look like a suicide before calling his buddy in the police department to help cover it up.

I don’t talk about that theory much. It still hurts, especially after what happened to Thomas the week after.

He shot himself in our garage. I found him there in the morning, lying in a pool of blood.

Some say it was guilt over what he’d done, but I’m not sure. Thomas was never one for guilt.

\*\*\*

So yeah, it’s hard for me to keep repeating myself. But I need to say it again, just so it’s clear.

Stop asking me if I killed Denise.

I did not kill her. I swear on it. I didn’t do it.

I promise you.

Just...

Just never ask me the same about [Thomas.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Accomplished_Low7889/)
