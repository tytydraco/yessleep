I slapped my alarm as quickly and quietly as I could. While holding my hand over the alarm I  slowly turned to see if I had woken my wife. Jane always managed to look pretty, even when she was sleeping, well not really but, she looked pretty to me. I walked to the bedroom door on my way to the kitchen making sure to avoid the creaky aged planks that made up my bedroom floor. I could practically step around them with my eyes closed. Jane has always loved the taste of fresh game, I could never understand what she liked about it but, I loved hunting so it was a nice balance. I tried preparing the pots and plates as quietly as I could but, you know… they’re pots and plates. I told myself she couldn’t hear anything I was doing and the surprise wouldn’t be ruined but, I’m certain I heard her trying to race back up the stairs quietly to spare my feelings.

After leaving the kitchen ready for the meal I would prepare later I grabbed my beautiful bolt action CZ rifle and left out the front door. The outside world greeted me with a single tone that mirrored itself as far east as west. The blinding white frost of the cold winter morning created the illusion of distance at infinity while simultaneously appearing completely flat and right in your face. A gentle breeze made sure my eyes never opened further than a squint. I whistled at my lazy mutt and he poked his head out of his luxurious dog house. I lowered my fist to Bartleby and he used my knuckles to give himself a nice shiatsu head massage. I tucked my hand back into my pockets after the cold strips what little heat I had left. Bartleby bites at my hand annoyed that I put it away. I led him to the passenger side of my truck, opened the door for him and he hopped in closing the door behind him with his jaws on the rag I wrapped around the handle on the inside. I walked over to the driver's side and just before I ducked into the seat I looked up to see her smiling at me from the 2nd-floor window. When I saw her she flinched away but quickly came back when she realized I had already seen her. She gives me a bashful smile and wave and I shake my head chuckling while waving back at her. I start the truck and regret not getting the heater fixed, even on high it’s only barely enough to allow me one hand on the wheel while I warm up the other. At Least she’s a reliable rig.

We cut through the fresh snow with ease on the main road heading towards a nice hunting spot that I frequently visit. Bartleby had already buried himself in his smelly blanket and refused to come out. I pat him over the blanket, “Come on boy, haven’t you slept enough?” He stubbornly gives me a soft “woof”. I reach into the glove box and pull out a package of dried venison. I lay a piece next to his snout and he briefly pokes his nose out to sniff and lick up the treat. I rub his head and continue down the road until I reach my right turn. After arriving, Bartleby and I left the truck and headed towards the treeline. Bartleby immediately finds a tree to mark his territory at, and as I wait for him I begin to load up my rifle one round at a time. The forest is oddly quiet until I hear faint footsteps in the distance, I squint my eyes to try and see what’s causing the noise and I see something coming towards us from in the woods. I used my scope to get a better look at the animal and saw that it was a wolf sprinting in my direction, “huh”. I looked further up and saw an enormous pack of snarling wolves following closely behind the first. My eyes widened as an electric wave of shock sprang from my heart to all of my fingers, despite the biting cold I broke out into a sweat. I hadn’t even realized I dropped my bullets. After they lightly landed on the ground, I had already turned around to run for the truck, stopping when I didn’t see Bartleby following. I must have stopped too quickly because my feet easily lost the ground and I found it with my hands and nearly my face.

 I got up as quickly as possible ignoring my stinging hands, I ran back to Bartleby with the stampede of menacing black fur and white hungry teeth in the background growing in size with each passing moment. You don’t realize how large a wolf really is until you see one with your own eyes. As soon as I could reach him, I grabbed his collar and yanked. He got the message and began following. We weren’t far from the truck but the wolves also weren’t far from us. Their paws were dreadfully audible now and as I ran I couldn’t tell if the panting directly behind me was my own dog or a wild wolf. I must have been panicking too much because after I reached the truck I ended up on my ass again. “DAMN IT!” I exclaimed as I missed the handle by mere inches. I looked up and it was too late, there was no time to make it back in the truck, Bartleby stood over me like a lion. He braced for the gnashing jaws of fierce wolves but the impact never hit. The wolves ran over Bartleby and I as if we weren’t even there. They completely ignored us and continued running as a pack as if they were caught up in a blazing forest fire and had made a temporary alliance with all life in the forest to just escape. I watched them cross the main road I had turned on, their large frames shrunk to nothing in the vast empty canvas that blurred the lines between heaven and earth. The only discernible point of reference was the sun, faded behind clouds with no depth or shadow. I sat there in silence for a moment trying to calm my breath.

Maybe the trees absorbed the wind, maybe the snow muted the ambiance but, after the storm of wolves passed by, the silence of the forest was unnerving. Still sitting on the ground, I laughed to myself in terror as Bartleby licked my face trying to comfort me. I gave him my knuckles and he scratched his head with them. Returning to where I dropped the bullets, I noticed that the divide between the forest and the rest of the world suddenly seemed greater. I stood before the border of two worlds and I willingly stepped into one where I didn't belong.

Walking through the forest I looked up directly at the sun and felt no pain due to the clouds evenly distributing its light everywhere. Still morning, nearing noon. Bartleby found a scent and I followed him, eventually the scent became a small trail of blood. That wasn’t too unusual but, what I saw in the distance was. I jogged ahead of Bartleby because he was still just focused on the trail in front of him. I saw something in the trees. My gaze grew more intense with every step, as a clearer picture revealed itself to be another wolf hanging upright on a tree branch with its innards on display like some sick mad scientist dissection experiment. Its skin was stretched out and pinned to the tree branches as if someone were leaving an animal's skin out to dry in the sun. The corpse was still purging its scarlet fluids onto the massive blotch of fowl black-dyed snow below. My brow furrowed, and my face turned to a scowl of confusion and disgust, the pure white snow around the gorey scene only made the colors seem more vibrant and clear. What the hell could have done this? Bartleby backed up with his tail between his legs, I looked around some more and noticed the surrounding trees all had unrecognizable symbols roughly carved into them. I didn’t know what to make of what I was seeing, it was simply strange and disturbing to say the least.

Finally, we arrived at my little tree fort, hunting shack, shelter, whatever you want to call it. I built her right onto a tall strong tree. Bartleby jumped into the box I made for him attached to a rope leading all the way up. I climbed up first using the ladder steps nailed right into the tree then I pulled the rope to bring Bartleby up with me. The shelter was a small one, standing upright in it was impossible and if I layed down on any side with my hands and feet stretched out I could easily touch each side of the walls. Only one side of the wall had an entire section of wood missing to show the view of the deeper part of the forest, the other walls could only be opened with small hinged hatches acting as windows barely large enough to fit my head. There was a large camo tarp covering the biggest segment of the open wall to keep out the cold. We sat patiently and comfortably inside, protected from the unrelenting cold, but despite the gentle howling of the wind, the forest really was oddly quiet. I hadn’t realized how clearly I could hear my blood pulsing to the beat of my heart in my head until the silence was broken by a gentle knocking just behind my head on the wooden wall where I was sitting. Immediately my veins froze over, my heart sank as my eyes grew.

 I tried to ease my growing heartbeat by thinking “Well it’s probably just a loose branch” I got up hunched over and looked at the hatch on the wall, I hesitated as I began to raise my hand towards the lock when another 3 knocks halted my movement. A weak voice from either a young boy or a lady said “Hello..?” from the other side of the wall. The adrenaline came back and I worried someone out there was freezing, in need of my help but no, that couldn’t be. How did they get up here, have they been here for some time, before I even arrived? Are they just hanging on the tree? No, if someone was out there in need of help, they wouldn’t be waiting outside a shelter, I would have found them in here when I came up. I looked at Bartleby and was surprised he hadn’t started barking, he stared at the wall intensely without moving. I opened my mouth to respond to whoever was on the other side but for some reason, my instincts were telling me to do as Bartleby was doing. Bartleby and I sat still feeling like my heartbeat was being too loud, my body strained from being in an awkward position for too long. It felt like any small movement would mean trouble so I ignored the static in my legs as they fell asleep from being in a crouched position for so long.

The silence was broken by the sound of frozen planks cracking under the weight of something on the roof. I hadn’t sealed the roof as well as the walls so there were slits where the planks joined. Light weakly pushed through and whoever was out there began blotting out what little rays of light made it through with their limbs. It began with one patch covered as flakes of undisturbed snow fell where pressure was being applied, then another landed as the first moved away to a new spot. Another two appeared behind the first two. Whatever was out there, was taking their time crawling on all fours. I began to question whether I had really heard a voice or if the silence of the forest had finally gotten to me. My lungs forgot how to work as I watched it continue across above us. After it reached the edge of the shelter, there was one last creak slightly more audible than the others, the shadow disappeared from the roof and briefly returned where the tarp was hiding us from the outside world. It had jumped. There was a thud on the floor below muffled by the snow, then rapid footsteps that quickly decreased in volume. I finally remembered to breathe again and made my way to the tarp. I lifted it and looked out. Bartleby joined me in my search but we only saw a small patch of upturned snow that broke the wavy frozen white ocean and footprints leading away from us.

 I looked around for a while longer before retreating back into the shelter, Bartleby decided to stay and watch for me. I quickly checked the hatch on the side of the wall where the knocking originated. Sticking my head out, I saw nothing unusual. I locked it again and sat back down still processing the odd occurrence. Had I really heard a voice? A few minutes later Bartleby began softly barking at me, trying to bring my attention back outside. “What do you see, boy?” I asked while making my way over to him. I squinted into the distance where he was looking and saw movement far away. By the color of the animal, I was fairly certain it was a deer. I grabbed my rifle and put my scope in the animal's direction. I saw a deer slightly hidden behind a tree. The shot wasn’t ideal but clear enough. For a moment I had forgotten about all that had happened up to this point but was quickly reminded that it wouldn’t end there. After focusing my sights on the deer I noticed it wasn’t quite standing but not laying down either. And it was lightly convulsing, and momentarily twitching, causing its limp hanging head to rock unsettlingly as if its bone was disconnected, clung together only by flesh and muscle. The deer appeared to already be damaged, maybe a wolf got to it before because part of its coat was hanging off of its body, and the fur was dyed red by its own blood.

Not too long ago I had just woken up, well rested and with all my strength but, this day has worn me down emotionally. My mouth hung suspended in motion to speak but, being unable to find the right words to ask and no one was even around to hear me… No one was around to hear me. I dropped the scope and looked down at the ground in need of a break from the incomprehensible scene before me. After taking a breath I decided the deer was sick, I’d hunt it, but only to put it out of its misery. I had no intention of taking that back home with me. I fixed the scope back on the deer and almost as soon as I did, I jumped when the deer's neck suddenly snapped back in place, its head turned to aim its eye at me and it felt for a split second like we had switched roles. Fear manifested as a shiver down my spine amplifying the winter air around me. I hastily planted the crosshairs on the deer’s chest as if to desperately take back the role of “the hunter” and pulled the trigger without focusing my shot. The banging echo of the gun cracked through the forest bringing it to life only for a moment. In the blink of an eye, a black dot appeared on the deer’s chest as the bullet ripped through its body. The deer shook mildly at the bullet's impact but otherwise stood like a boulder, the wound didn’t even bleed. With no other reaction, the deer simply turned its head and ran off, or at least… it tried to run. I must have severed some sort of nerve because the deer moved like how my dog would walk when I would put shoes on his feet but, Bartleby looked cute doing that, but this deer was simply uncanny.

After the deer was long gone, I wondered if chasing it was a good idea. I didn’t even want to touch it before but, my curiosity pushed me forward. Bartleby didn’t like the idea and whimpered as we first followed the footsteps of whatever was knocking on my shelter. I noticed that those footsteps were oddly humanoid, they were in the direction of the deer that I had shot so I studied them as we went. The walk seemed longer than it should have been, I looked up at the sun. It was just past noon now. I looked around the still forest half expecting to see more odd symbols etched into the bark, “That’d be creepy” I said out loud. Arriving where the deer had been when I shot it, I saw a gruesome scene. Despite the small hole, void of blood that the bullet had made on the deer's chest, the snow here was nearly completely melted away from the nauseating amounts of blood poured onto it. There was a pile of shredded organs on the floor, some bones littered the area and others were still attached to the muscle, there was even a skull there, all belonging to a deer I assume. Steam rose from the heap of warm deer guts and I gagged after staring far too long. Questions raced through my mind, I don’t know what it was that was pushing me to follow the deer I had shot but, whatever it was, it wasn’t common sense. I was stupidly desperate for answers to questions I should have never asked. At this point, snow began to dance down around me from the sky. I had to move quickly before losing the trail. Bartleby loyally but reluctantly followed behind as we walked for nearly an hour in a direction I don’t think I’ve ever walked before.

The footsteps were fading as the intensity of the falling snow increased. My vision was obscuring as the snow slowly became a mild blizzard. I saw a large dark spot in the ground ahead of me, after an hour of walking the ground rose upwards until it became a hill where I stood. The dark spot eventually revealed itself to be the mouth of a gaping hungry cave. I was done at that point, I didn't feel it'd be worth it, and I didn't have time to go off on a side adventure with my wife waiting at home. I was already late so I turned to leave. But, something had caught me off guard. I turned around to check if what I saw was reality. The footsteps I had been following abruptly ended. I was afraid to acknowledge I had been tricked I looked around my surroundings, and where I stood there was a tree-less patch going over and around the cave.

I’ve heard of animals like foxes backtracking to avoid predators but, what kind of animal would use that to catch prey? I looked to Bartleby for answers and he was focused on the trees behind us. I turned back around and followed his gaze. The blizzard was giving the distance a white tint. Bartleby began growling and barking, my hairs stood on end at the thought of an unseen enemy.

I wouldn't have seen it if it hadn't moved. A single hand with long slim fingers wrapped around a tree far away opened like a flower in bloom. The tree was thick and yet, this thing had half its hand around it. I looked upwards and saw the silhouette of a head. The blizzard blurred its features on the thing but I had seen enough. I froze, I hoped that what I was seeing was just an illusion brought on by the blur of the blizzard but I had to make sure. Those few seconds of stillness stretched into hours. I steadied the gun on my shoulder aiming at the now still figure I had to know if there was something really there. Bartleby had been whimpering and his cries increased exponentially as I aimed. Just as I fired the bullet, I felt an electric current shock my left leg. I looked down and saw Bartleby biting my leg hard, tugging at me while whimpering like I’d never heard him do before. He threw my shot off, but I caught a glimpse of the figure recoiling as a misty red cloud bursts from its shoulder. My eyes returned to the figure and it was sprinting at me on all fours, this was no illusion. I didn’t wait to find out what its face looked like undisturbed by a hazy storm. Bartleby led the way into the cave, and I followed without protest. My footsteps echo grew as I pushed further into darkness. Eventually, I found a boulder for Bartleby and me to take cover behind I turned to the entrance and saw the silhouette of the figure pause there standing on two legs. I aimed my rifle again and it ducked down, beginning to crawl again. I could no longer see it, all I saw was the bright outside world at the end of the tunnel.

I sat there with Bartleby for a couple minutes just listening for any movement. The wind caused an almost whistle-like effect inside the cave making it difficult to make out which sounds were real and what was in my imagination. I decided it was best to keep the rifle in a defensive position as a shield rather than hope that I’d have time to lock on to my invisible target guided by sound alone. I thought my eyes were finally adjusting to the dark because I had convinced myself I could see hints of the cave walls around me and just barely the outline of a tall, long-limbed humanoid figure. It was just standing to my left not too far away. I don’t understand why it hadn’t attacked yet. I slowly aimed the rifle at it from my hip, I cannot stress how slowly I moved making sure my aim was flawless. My finger slowly squeezed the trigger, I braced for the recoil and a split second before, mere inches away from my left ear I heard the same weak “hello..?”  I flinched as the bullet hit my imaginary enemy, the flash gave me a brief scope of the area, there was no cave, I was surrounded by trees covered with odd symbols. My adversary had already gotten far too close to me biding its time using the wind as a cover for its incremental movement in the dark.I could hear it begin to make its move but Bartleby miraculously tackled the thing before I or it could react. A struggle began, I heard my dog snarling angrily and the same human voice that said hello except now it was howling like the souls of the damned.

I began yelling, not in fear or any emotion that I could clearly describe, my voice just flowed without my permission, the monster's cries died out but Bartleby was showing no mercy, he continued barking, snapping his jaw and tearing at whatever that thing was. I’ve never heard Bartleby bark so intensely, it was as if he stopped taking breaths in between barking, and continued his assault. I continued yelling as my ears began ringing. After my lungs were empty a warm glow drew my eyes.I looked at my burning home. The flames raged on as I opened my mouth to release emotional pressure through my voice. I don’t know if I even made a noise, a ringing in my ears had begun deafening my audible reality. I was shaking even though I wasn’t cold. The heat from the fire felt like it scorched the hairs from my face. My wife grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me violently. I continued yelling in her face in a delirious state, I stared at her but I couldn’t remember what her face looked like. She guided the rifle in my hands to her chest while chanting something that I couldn’t hear. I kept the rifle fixed on her not knowing what else to do. She eventually walked away to the side of the house and got down on her knees. She began working on something on the floor but I couldn’t see what it was. The ringing in my head was unbearable. I couldn't explain any of my actions if I tried but, without hesitation I lifted the barrel of my rifle to my chin and fired a round into my head. My world flashed and I was plunged back into the dark reality of my situation, the transition shocked the air out of my lungs and I fell to my knees gasping for air.

When I caught my breath I noticed Bartleby whimpering weakly, I stepped towards where I heard him. “Bart…? Y-you okay boy?” My voice quivered. I knelt down near his body, He whimpered softly. I lowered my fist to his head with tears in my eyes. Then I felt a fleshy furless skull, I recoiled before attempting to touch it again, I reached my hand out to confirm and again felt a fleshy body before me. I jolted up and pulled the trigger aiming at the spot where that thing was laying in front of me. All I heard were clicks, I reloaded the rifle in a panic and attempted the trigger again, there was one last whimper as the bullet struck it. I looked towards the entrance, and called out for Bartleby. “Here boy, where are you?” He responded with a strong bark and I saw his silhouette appear at the end of the tunnel.

I jogged to him leaving the cave behind. Stepping outside, the world seemed darker than I remembered, way too dark. I searched for the sun where I last saw it, but it had disappeared. It was now hanging low on the other side of the sky, evening. How long was I in that cave for? Bartleby began walking ahead, I was eager to be done with this day too. “You leaving without me?” Bartleby stopped and turned his head at me, I stopped approaching him “What’s wrong Bart?” Bartleby stared at me and I noticed the wound on his coat, he wasn’t in good shape. A piece of his skin hung loosely around the belly area. “Oh, you’re hurt” I knelt down next to Bartleby and reached for him to check on his wound when he barked violently at me and growled. I sprung back up throwing my hands in the air “Whoa, heh-hey bart, it’s okay. It’s me Bart” his growl faded and he began walking back. I watched him continue for a moment, still a little shocked that he had snapped at me. Eventually I jogged to catch up to him, I watched him carefully as we walked and made sure to keep a distance behind him in silence.

The sun was about to begin its setting phase and we began our long walk back to the truck. I went into autopilot watching the trees go by, we walked passed my shelter in the tree and then the corpse of the gutted wolf until the sight of my truck in the distance returned my lucidity. My steps began to feel heavier the closer I got to my truck, my body tensed up as I put my hand on the door handle. I just stood there holding the door long enough to allow the cold metal to hold me back. “Bartleby…?” I turned to him as I spoke. I peeled my hand from the door and balled it into a fist, lowering it down to him I said “Come here boy” His eyes stared at me, he stood immobile while my fist hung in the air waiting for reception. Eventually he slowly walked towards me and licked my fist. I stood there clenching my jaw, my emotions turned to liquid and pushed against my eyes. I slowly pulled my hand back and gripped my rifle tightly. I closed my eyes forcing tears down my cheek that provided me with brief relief from the cold but quickly froze over stinging my face worse than the air ever could. I slowly lowered the barrel to that things head and immediately it zipped away at astonishing speed, I let out a breath of short-lived relief until it turned left onto the mainroad in the direction of my home.

I dashed to the driver side and hopped in and drove away recklessly. I sped down the road disregarding the speed limit. With nothing else to do I tried to comprehend the horrors of this day but, that only left me feeling overwhelmed, I looked to my right at the passenger seat, the sight of flattened blankets put a pulsing pressure behind my eyes I lifted them hoping a stubborn mut would stick his nose out to greet me. My chest ached, but my body didn’t allow me to shed anymore tears, I couldn’t even moan in pain, only release bursts of pathetic gasping whimpers. Ignoring the roads I shifted off onto where the grass lay under the snow when I saw my home in the distance. I glided towards my driveway as my car shook and bounced violently and I nearly crashed had there not been a pile of snow to slow me down. I threw the door open and as I stood out in the cold of the growing dark I saw my wife standing in the bedroom window embraced in darkness. She had one hand raised waving at me, my muscles went limp and I shook as the strength of my will bled from my very being. I calmly walked up the steps of my porch and pushed opened the door that had already been left half open.

It was just as cold inside as it was out. I shut and locked the door behind me and made my way up the steps making sure to hit every creaky floorboard until I reached my bedroom door. My hands rattled violently as I revealed more of the room while pushing the door open. The thing wearing my wife’s skin waited for me to see it adjusting the stolen skin as it slid over its skull like a cheap mask. Gripping the rifle in my shaky hands I began to raise it to my chin, that’s when it jumped towards me inserting its fingers into my right side like it was warm butter. I don’t remember falling but I sat there against the wall looking at my exposed rib and heaving lung, somehow I never lost my grip on the rifle. When I looked up at the thing it had been momentarily blinded as the stolen skin shifted around its eyes in the commotion. I somehow found the strength to get up on my feet with a horrible gurgled grunt in my throat. I stumbled down the hallway to the hatch leading up to my attic, I struggled to reach it with half of my torso muscles gone. Eventually I brought the ladder down and climbed. I turned around and the thing was still desperately trying to readjust my wifes face onto its own like its existence depended on having an identity, even if it wasn’t its own. I could see its bones shift like they were each their own separate entity. I continued up and locked the hatch when I was in the attic. I stood leaning on the slanted ceiling around me with my rifle aimed at the hatch.

It banged on the hatch each strike fully intending to pulverize the barrier. When it inevitably came up I fired a round into its chest and confirmed my suspicion that a single round wouldn’t do much, especially in my limited time. I finally got a good look at this demonic being, it seemed to have given up on my wife’s face and showed what it was really made of. Its facial features writhed desperately changing shape as if it were waiting for an input, same went for the rest of its body except for the parts where the stolen flesh hadn’t fallen off. I fired again this time aiming at the water heater behind the thing, it hissed moments before the bright flash sent me against the wall. I felt the burn of heat and cold simultaneously, the blaze burned the hairs off my face and the cold behind me made them stand on end. I was weightless for the few moments I spent falling. I don’t remember hitting the ground but I woke up dazed. There was a patch of dirt unbothered by snow on the side of the house where a pretty red leafed plant was growing next to me, I was worried I had crushed part of it with my fall.

The world was blurry and seconds passed by as minutes. The world went dark as I closed my eyes, when I opened them again I heard the shrieking bellows of a thousand souls both human and animal, when I looked at the source of the hellish cries I saw dozens of contorted limbs writhing as fire freed the souls trapped in the demonic vessel. Each of its heads displayed a unique skull spazzing wildly as if it had forgotten what it originally looked like when it was birthed from the rankest bowels of hell. It began to run off aimlessly into the distance as its body fought with itself unable to decide which direction to go. That was the last memory I could recall from the night I lost everything.

And now I lay here staring at a cheap white tiled roof, hooked up to a machine. I can still feel my leg, the nurses say it's called phantom limb syndrome and that it should go away or become mostly undetectable after the first year. I hope to God that whatever that thing was, it died along with my wife and dog but, something tells me it's still out there somewhere, I’m going to have to sell my land to pay for the medical expenses, but I can’t ever truly leave until I know it's dead.
