By the time I arrived at the scene, the street was washed in strobing red and blue lights from half a dozen police cars. Neighbors stood on their porches watching the scene as officers crawled over every inch of the house. Through the window, I could see a young boy on the couch. Margie Caron was sitting on the couch beside him.

The woman was a saint.

It seems I wasn’t the only one who spent sleepless nights waiting for these calls.

As I started up the walkway, Margie saw me through the window. She patted the boy on the back and started to make her way outside. As soon as she reached the front porch, she pulled a cigarette from her pack with a shaking hand and lit it. A patrol officer stepped out and joined her.

“Officer Hundley,” the young officer said. She stuck out her hand to shake mine. “I was the first on the scene, Detective Renfrow. Deborah Stanley is the name of our missing person. Her son, Dustin, said he was awoken by a loud noise. We suspect they were gunshots. There are two shell casings on the kitchen floor by the back door. It appears she attempted to shoot the intruder.”

“Did he get an ID on the intruder?” I asked. “Anything we can follow up on?”

“Dustin said he came downstairs and saw Santa Claus dragging his mother out the back door,” Margie said. “He wants to talk to you, Charlie. I’ve tried to get more information from him, but he says it is a secret he isn’t supposed to tell. After a little bit of coaxing, he said he would tell a police officer. We better hurry.”

We stepped into the warmth of the house and into the living room. Dustin sat staring at the floor, distraught and crying. My heart ached for the kid. Visions of eight other inconsolable children I had let down filled my head.

“Hey Dustin,” I said gently. “My name is Charlie Renfrow and I’m a detective with the police department. Tonight has been scary, but I want to help. Ms. Margie told me you have a secret you couldn’t tell her. Can you tell me? It may help your mom.”

The little boy kicked his feet and sniffled but didn’t look up.

“I’m gonna be in trouble,” he said through a sob. “Momma got hurt and I’m gonna be in trouble.”

“Buddy, you aren’t going to be in trouble,” Margie said reassuringly. “Just tell Charlie what happened so he can help.”

“I talked to Santa and he asked what I wanted for Christmas. I told him I wanted a bike and he said I could have it.” Dustin whimpered. “He told me I needed to leave the backdoor unlocked after Momma went to bed so he could bring it in. Then he took her.”

My head was swimming. The kid had talked to the suspect and he used the boy to enter the house. No wonder there was no forced entry. He gained their trust and the children let him in.

“Where did you talk to Santa, buddy?” I asked. “Did he come to the house and talk to you?”

“No,” the little boy said. “Momma took me to the mall and I said I could get my picture with Santa. He asked me a buncha questions about me and mom and why Dad wasn’t with us. I told him dad got mad and left. Santa said that made him sad and he wanted to bring me a special gift. I told him where we lived and he said to unlock the door, but he said I had to keep it a secret or I wouldn’t get my bike. Why did he take Momma? When is she coming home?”

Melvin Garcia showed up minutes after I finished interviewing the boy. I told Melvin everything Dustin had told me. The mall Santa. All of the questions. How he had told Dustin to leave the door unlocked.

“You’ve got to be shitting me!” Melvin exclaimed. “A mall Santa! The son of a bitch prowls for victims using the kids! I’m going to get in contact with someone at the mall and find this guy's name. Go get some rest. You look like hell. I’ll call you when I get a lead.”

Melvin was on his cell phone before he even got in his car. I talked with Margie and told her to continue talking to Dustin and see if he had any more information. That was the most frustrating possible moment of the investigation.

A woman had been taken, we had got a nameless suspect, and Melvin would have to play phone tag until he located someone that could get into the office at the mall to pull his employment records. I went back to the station and poured through all of the old interviews for any possible mention of a suspect, but none surfaced.

Around 6:30 AM, Melvin called.

“His name is Arthur Phalen,” he said. “He has been the mall Santa for the last thirteen years. No priors. Owns a white 1998 Chevy G-Series van that matches the description from the scene. Sixty-year-old Caucasian male. Six foot two inches. White hair and beard. Go figure. We are en route. Texting you the address now. If you arrive before we do, wait for backup.”

I hung the phone up and ran to the car. My phone pinged with a text message and I punched the address into my GPS. The wheels of my car spun on the asphalt as I flipped on my lights and peeled out of the parking lot.

The address led to a house twenty-five minutes outside of town in a sparsely populated area. I had expected to see other patrol cars as I moved along, but I was the only car on the road. White blanketed fields lined the highway as I moved further into the country.

Radio chatter spilled out into the cab of the car. Multiple cruisers were roughly ten minutes behind me. My stomach quivered and my temples were throbbing. Arthur Phalen’s house was only two minutes away and I was silently praying that I could make it in time.

As I reached the end of the driveway, I could see a two-story farmhouse an eighth of a mile off the road. A ramshackle outbuilding sat beside it. A white Chevy van sat in front of the building’s doors. Fresh tracks in the snow trailed up the drive.

I pulled my car beyond the entrance of the drive and threw it in park before jumping out and heading up the drive on foot. We had all waited for so many years for that moment and I hadn’t wanted the sound of wheels crunching on gravel to give him any warning that we were coming.

Moving from tree to tree for coverage, I made my way toward the house. Thin wisps of smoke drifted from a pipe jutting out of the top of the outbuilding. I was maybe a hundred feet from the door when I heard a terrifying scream from inside.

My heart thundered as a white-hot bolt of fear swam through my body.

Knowing I was nearly out of time, I broke into a run and slammed my shoulder against the shed door with all of my might. The old wood splintered and gave way, almost causing me to tumble to the floor. Rank odors of copper and decay filled my nose.

“What the hell?” said an old man dressed in a red suit trimmed with white fur. He had a leather apron over his neck and held a hunting knife in his right hand. There was a woman, Deborah Stanley, tied to a metal table with ratchet straps.

“Drop the knife and step away!” I shouted, my heart thundering in my chest. “Do it now!”

“Wait a minute!” the old man said. “We can talk this out! Just let me put this down…”

The old man lifted the knife in the air and gripped it with two hands. His face contorted into a sneer as he prepared to plunge the knife into the screaming woman. I fired twice, hitting him in center mass and sending him sprawling into the wall behind him.

Deborah Stanley was wailing loudly as I carefully stepped around the table, gun leveled toward Arthur. A thick pool of dark blood was spreading below him as he lay dead in a scattered pile of gift boxes. The very boxes he intended to use for Deborah.

A chorus of sirens filled the air and I turned toward the terrified woman on the table.

It was over.

Arthur Phalen’s reign of terror is over. For nearly a decade, the man had worked as a mall Santa to collect information from innocent children in pursuit of victims. He used them to get into the house and took the most precious things in their lives. We will never know why.

If I had waited for backup, maybe we would have. But Deborah and Dustin Stanley would never have seen another day together. My need to understand would never outweigh that kind of loss.

We reinterviewed some of the old witnesses. Most of the children vaguely recalled meeting Santa at the mall before their parents were killed. Two even stated leaving the back door unlocked but didn’t tell us out of fear of getting in trouble. A cruel man had manipulated them using the visage of a beloved figure into keeping his terrible secret.

I still see those dead women in my dreams. My own Ghosts of Christmas Past, I guess. I tell them I did my best, but they just look on silently. They always will. They deserved better and I was too late all but once.

It’ll be Christmas in a few days and for the first time in almost ten years, I’ll be spending it with my family. Things with Shaye have been… different. After I killed Arthur Phalen and we recovered Deborah Stanley, she asked me if I wanted to come to stay at the house with her and the kids for a while.

A “while” turned into nearly a year. We eat as a family. Go to the movies. Play at the park.

The kids stick to me like glue. I’m happy for the first time in years.

Shaye holds my hand everywhere we go. So tightly it feels like she will never let go.

I hope she [doesn’t.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/)
