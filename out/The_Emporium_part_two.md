If you want to hear what happened [MONDAY](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/1e30e5xXvD)

*TUESDAY*

I woke up early today, even though I didn't have to. My shift didn't start until 2:00 PM, but I wanted to enjoy whatever moments of freedom I had before coming back to this place. I tell you, The Emporium will drain the life right outta you, if you let it.

But, I'm here now. Definitely clocked in this time, too. No one believes me when I tell them, that time clock is a fucking thief. It's been deleting hours off of my time lately, and sometimes it takes the whole damn shift. Guess I'm the only one it does that to, of course. Bastard.

Chris is here working with me tonight. He's a fairly normal guy I'd say, except the motherfucker does have more fingers than usual. A whole extra hand, in fact, and it's not where you'd expect it to be. Always gets him in trouble. 

The Turd Slug is back again. It's fucking disgusting, but we can't really do anything about it. The more we chase it around, the more shit it smears everywhere. And Lenny does a God awful job of cleaning it up, of course. So, it's honestly better to just pretend like you don't even see it, so it doesn't try to run away from you. 

Other than that, it's been a pretty slow night... so far. I didn't have a lot of backstock to do, so I decided to go and try to clean up The Spill That Never Dries. I know it's a waste of time, but tonight, that's my goal. I call it, 'do nothing Tuesdays', because, usually it's my first day back. But, since I didn't get my day off yesterday, I'll have to work extra hard to do more nothing than usual tonight.  

I go to the janitor's closet and, of course, Lenny's in there, dripping. I hate it when he stands in my way, it's really hard to get all the drippings off the bottom of my shoes. I grab the mop and bucket and head over to aisle 13. 

When I get there, Blind Richard is flailing around on the ground, covered in green slime and holding onto a box of saltines. Must've slipped on The Spill. *Shit...* Now I have to fill out a God damned accident report. And, that motherfucker is *not* blind either, he's faking it. I just know. 

When I bent over to help him up, I suddenly felt a finger slide into a place I was not expecting. 

"God damnit! Chris!!"

"Oh Jeez, I'm sorry man! I was just trying to help." 

"Just, back up... I got it. Why don't you go and grab an accident form from the office." I said, trying not to lose my cool. 

"Okay!" He said. "Where's the office?"

Chris has worked here for at least 5 years, and he's been in that office many, many times. I explain to him *again* how to get there, then go back to trying to help Blind Richard. Only, he's gone. That shithead had gotten up and walked away, smearing The Spill all over the place with his stick. 

I decide to give up on The Spill and head back to the warehouse. Maybe I'll just hide out there until I hear The Hum. Adam is the one running the register tonight. Thank God. That means I won't have to go up there and help... *unless* he has one of his 'episodes.' 

Every so often, Adam gets these little fits where it's like something suddenly comes over him. His eyes turn black, his head spins around, and he starts projectile vomiting all over the customers. I think the fucker needs to be on medicine, or something. But, he doesn't think anything's wrong with him, because he never remembers it happening. Real convenient if you ask me.

When I walk through the warehouse doors, I can already smell it. The Fart Cloud. It must be somewhere around back here. I know it isn't the Turd Slug, because I just saw the little shit over by the milk and it's not that fast. The Fart Cloud never dissipates, it just moves. You pretty much never know where it's going to be, until you crop dust yourself with it. 

I forgot to bring my jacket with me tonight, so I'm freezing my ass off. It's always so fucking cold in here. I used to go around setting all the thermostats to 72, but it seemed like someone kept going behind me and turning them down to 65, so I don't even bother with it anymore. At least I remembered to bring my food. 

The Hum began, and I was just starting to make my way to the break room when I noticed Yogurt Lady over by the coolers. She hadn't started slathering herself yet, but I knew she'd still growl if she saw me. I didn't feel like being attacked tonight, so I turned around. Guess I'm not eating. 

I spent the rest of my shift trying to fill the cans of soup that kept changing into mice every time I'd put them on the shelf. I didn't even try to catch any of them. Maybe they'll eat the Turd Slug.

At a quarter to 9, Chris comes running up to me holding a piece of paper.

"I got it!" He said, excitedly. 

I'd forgotten I even sent him on that mission. 

"Thanks, Chris. Now go put it back in the office."

"Okay! Where's the office?" 

I head up to the front of the store, and apparently Adam had an episode that no one alerted me to. The openers will be pissed, but I don't care. I am *not* cleaning up all this. Besides, they'll blame it on Lenny. 

As I approach the time clock, eager to get home and be done with this night, I hear a squish. I lift up my foot, and it's the fucking Turd Slug, feasting on a half eaten mouse. I kick it across the floor and punch my numbers in. Maybe [tomorrow](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/tTdlukgDE9) will be better.
