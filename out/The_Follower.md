It all started in September 6th of 2023. I was just getting some groceries for my family when I noticed it. I left the grocery at around 8:00PM and drove back towards home when I noticed a car behind me. It was a Toyota sedan. I didn't think much of it at the time.

I stopped at a traffic light and looked into my mirror. The person in the car was off. I can't describe it. The person was a male and he was wearing a gray suit. Nothing alarming right?. I was wrong. The eyes. I don't know why it was wrong but it just was. His eyes were smaller than usual but that wasn't what creeped me out. It was the dullness. The nothingness. Like he was staring into space. Then to my surprise we made eye contact for a second.

" Why am I looking into people's cars?" I said to myself. I usually never gave other drivers to much attention. But the man behind me. I don't know. The light turned green and I made a left and the man in the Toyota sedan kept going straight. I got home at like 8:25PM. I honked the horn and called the kids out to help bring in the groceries.

I don't know why but when I was about to go into my house I looked back to my neighbors house across the street. Him. He was there.  The dull eyed man was next to my neighbors tree watching me. I felt a chill go down my spine. "Sean, do you see that person next to that tree" I said to my oldest son who was 13. Sean looked to where I told him. "I don't see anything" He said back to me. I looked stupidly at him and looked back to the tree. The dull eyed man was gone.

I shook my head. "I must be seeing stuff, I need rest" I said back to Sean.

I didn't see that man for a good while.

It was September 27th, 7:43PM, I was getting gas when I saw him again. He was looking out the store window with those same staring dull eyes. I jumped in my SUV and sped on to the highway. Around 5 minutes later I felt a tap on my shoulder. I whipped back ,my car swerving across the highway nearly hitting another car. Nothing.

Then came October. I had given the dull eyed man a name. The Follower. The Follower was in the most unexpected places. I saw him in the mall. The lake. My job. Time after time. The only place he wouldn't show up was my room.

Now came November. I've requested for a vacation from my job so I wouldn't have to leave my room. I've been lying to my family saying I'm sick because if I told them what I was seeing they would never believe me. On November 16th I spent the day downstairs in the living room. The Follower was there. Watching from the windows. From the trees. And the worst part is he never stops. It's like he has no interest killing me. He's just torturing me. He never attacks. Just watches. I just wished he would kill me. At least I won't have to be haunted day after day.

Now its the day before Thanksgiving. I haven't left my room in 5 days. My kids bring me all my meals to my room. My family has been asking me to come down for Thanksgiving. But I refuse. I am only safe in my room. I don't care about my job. I just want peace. I spend hours browsing the Internet for hours. Nothing. I shiver at the thought of living my life in a room but it's better than seeing It. The Follower.

I'm writing this while my family prepares for Thanksgiving. I have nothing else to do so might as well share my story. I just looked outside my windows curtains and I saw him under my neighbors car. Watching. I don't know why I've been cursed. It feels real. It is real.
