I suddenly woke up, head pounding. It was late, just past midnight. The office was dead quiet, except for the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead. *"I must've passed out,"* I muttered. I was the last one there, finishing up a report that was due in the morning. My desk lamp flickered, casting shadows across the empty cubicles. I should’ve gone home hours ago, but work had piled up, and the thought of my boss’s disappointed look the next day kept me glued to my chair.



Finally, I packed up, exhaustion weighing me down. I walked to the elevator and pressed the button, leaning against the wall as I waited. The light above flickered, dimming briefly before switching back on. When the elevator doors opened, they revealed… nothing.



Just darkness.



No lights inside, no welcoming hum of machinery—just a black void, no elevator at all. Confused, I stepped back and whispered, *"What the—"* The doors slid shut with a mechanical thud, cutting me off mid-sentence. I pressed the button again, hoping it was just a malfunction, but the light over the button stayed off. I hit it again. Nothing.



The elevator was broken again—for the 6th time this month.



Sighing, I turned toward the emergency exit. The stairs it is, I thought. I pushed open the door to the stairwell, the creak of the door echoing through the empty stairwell. The air inside the stairwell was cold, much colder than it had been moments ago in the office. The lights flickered erratically, buzzing faintly, and I felt a strange sensation wash over me—a feeling of unease. I glanced down the long, spiraling staircase. It was a long way down.



As I took the first few steps, I heard the heavy thud of the door closing behind me. The sound bounced off the concrete walls, amplifying in the eerie silence that followed. I descended slowly, one floor at a time, the motion-sensor lights turning on, floor by floor, as I went down. The air kept growing more oppressive the further I went. The stairwell felt wrong—too quiet, too still.



About two floors down, I heard it. Footsteps. But not mine.



I froze, heart pounding. "*I thought I was the last one here—maybe security?*" I muttered to myself. The sound came from below me, faint but unmistakable. Someone—or something—was walking up the stairs. My pulse quickened, and I hurried my pace, the soles of my shoes slapping against the concrete steps. The footsteps below me seemed to quicken too, matching my speed. I glanced over the railing, but all I saw was darkness stretching down into the abyss. All the lights below were off.



I kept going, trying to stay calm, but the feeling of being watched grew stronger with every step. I reached into my pocket for my phone, swiping the screen open. I dialed security, but before the call could go through, my screen went black. Dead.



That’s when the buzzing began.



The faint hum of static filled the air, growing louder. It was coming from the walls, like something was hissing through the concrete. A voice broke through the static, low and distorted, echoing all around me. I couldn’t make out the words at first, just broken fragments of sound. But as I descended further, it became clear.



*"Don’t look down."*



My breath caught in my throat. The voice was right in my ear now, as though someone—or something—was standing just behind me, whispering. I forced myself to keep walking, even as the footsteps below grew louder. Faster.



*"It’s behind you,"* the voice whispered again.



I couldn’t help it. I turned and looked down the stairwell.



At the bottom of the stairs, just a few floors down, the hallway light from the exit casting into the stairwell, I saw a silhouette of a figure standing in the shadows. It was staring up at me, face obscured, but its eyes… I could see its eyes. They were glowing, two pinpricks of light in the dark. It started moving, slowly at first, then faster, almost sprinting up the stairs. Panic surged through me.



I turned and bolted up the stairs, almost slipping over my steps, desperate to get back to my office floor. The door at the top seemed so far away, but I ran harder, my legs burning with each step. I could hear it now—whatever it was—was right behind me, footsteps echoing faster and louder. The voice sputtered again in my ear, but this time, it wasn’t a whisper.



*"Don’t let it catch you."* it shouted.



I threw myself against the door, twisting the handle to open it just as the footsteps reached the final step behind me. I slammed it shut and collapsed against it, gasping for air. Silence fell over the stairwell, and I definitely didn’t dare look through the small window in the door.



My phone buzzed in my pocket, the screen flickering back to life. One new message: *"You’re too late."*



The door handle beside me twisted slowly.



I froze, heart pounding in my chest. The handle shook violently now, rattling in its frame. Slowly, it began to turn. I pressed my body against the door, bracing myself as if I could somehow hold back whatever was on the other side. But the handle clicked.



It swung open with an icy gust, and there, standing in the doorway, was the figure. No face, just hollow, empty eyes glowing in the darkness. I stumbled back, my legs refusing to work, as the figure stepped forward, its body enveloped in a swirling fog that poured into the room. The air turned thick, suffocating. I couldn’t breathe.



*"You’re too slow,"* the voice rasped, mocking me, now right in front of me.



I tried to scream, but my throat closed. My vision blurred, my lungs burning for air. The figure raised its hand, and before I could react, it grabbed my wrist—its touch ice-cold and searing all at once.



But then, its eyes… they bore into me. A light, cold and bright, shone from them, too strong to look away from. It filled my mind, my thoughts freezing as I stared into them—entranced, unable to move. I was stuck, suspended in a trance of terror as the deadlights swallowed me whole. My body wouldn’t respond, locked in place as if time itself had stopped.



In the distance, a voice whispered, this time colder: *"You’ve been here before. This is where it ends—for now."*



The pain was gone, replaced by a hollow, sinking feeling. My mind staggered, failing to come to a sense of calm, failing to make sense of the words. *Had I been through this before?* The last thought I had before everything faded was how slow I had been—how I’d never escape.



Suddenly, everything went black.



I gasped awake, my head pounding. The soft glow of my desk lamp flickered beside me, the office lights humming quietly. I was still at my desk. Heart racing, I wiped the cold sweat from my brow. *"A nightmare. It was just a nightmare,"* I muttered.



I stood up, shaking it off, and packed my things, desperate to get home. As I made my way toward the elevator, I couldn’t help but glance back at the emergency exit door. It was shut tight, the stairwell dark beyond it. The fear from the nightmare still clung to me, but I reassured myself—it was just a dream.



I pressed the button for the elevator.



But then, as the doors slid open, I saw nothing but blackness. No lights inside. The dark void stared back at me once again. My phone buzzed in my pocket. I pulled it out with trembling hands. One new message: *"You’re too slow."*



The hum of the lights faded into silence, and in the reflection of my phone screen, I saw those same glowing eyes staring back at me.
