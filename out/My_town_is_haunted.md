I moved to this town with my mum, dad and brother. It was old, from the 1800’s. We already purchased a house and was moving in with the help of our old neighbours. Whilst we were unpacking I couldn’t help but feel odd. “This town gives me a chill” I spoke to my brother, he replied saying “get over it. It’s old, I like it.” Of course he says that, he loves vintage things. Everything just felt so weird in this town, our neighbours consisted of old people in their 70’s to 90’s. 

As time passed by I got used to it, sort of. The high school me and my brother went to only had 400 kids and 110 staff members. Everyone looked bloodshot. Baggy eyes, red veins. Gave me the ick. We literally had 2 balls to share with for sport and computers from 2006. I hated it. Our town centre was the size of a closet and our post box had 5 spots to put mail in. We had a shopping centre, if you can even call it that. It has 4 shops, one for appliances, one for gardening, an insurance ‘room’ and a shop for school work. Not to mention the grass everywhere was overgrown with trash everywhere! “Disgusting.” I thought to myself. But soon everything I was weirded out by made complete sense after what happened last night. 

Every night at exactly 1:13 AM a noise that I can only describe as a horse clattering went around the street. I have trouble sleeping so this sound killed me. It got to the point I had to discover what it was, so a few nights ago I waited next to a window. It hit, my phone said 1:13 AM. I opened my blinds barely. But to my surprise, nothing. How odd? I was sure I heard it, was it real or my imagination. No, it can’t be. For the next five nights I kept checking but to no avail. Perhaps I was just slow, and I just kept missing it. “No it can’t be” I thought to myself. So I decided to do something I never thought I would do.  I set out to finally find what was happening. So at 1:00 am, I set out. I decided to check the whole town, making sure of anything weird but nothing, so I decided that the only thing left to check was the woods. I ventured out. It was getting Morning more into the sunrise. I was sure that I was gonna miss my chance, but it happened and what I saw will forever be engraved in my head.

I found a cave, nothing odd in it, but as I set more and more into it, I found something. There was a hideous thing that looked fleshy. It made noises that sounded like Horse clattering. As they went on, I felt more and more discomforted and tired. I was almost a zombie at that point. It was then that I realised the truth behind this weird town. There was a fleshy monster hidden in a cave near the town sending out noises that would make the town people into zombies, as they went on people would get brainwashed into these noises. I ran back instantly. Once I arrived back at my house I woke everyone up. “ we have to leave now!” I told them. “What?” Said my confused dad. I proceeded to tell them everything.  They were shocked. That day we left the town, I still do not know what that thing was, but I will for ever be traumatised by it.

Basically, these noises would go out making people brainwashed, because of this, they would lose the ability to do anything, everyone in that town was a worker contributing to the monster.


This was my first story. So sorry if it’s bad lol
