 As an antiques collector, I have seen my fair share of various objects that are both fascinating and intriguing, yet I must not deny that items of a bizarre nature do come to pass every now and then. There were many instances during my "hunting" where I would stumble upon something so bizarre or weird, but as in most cases, it was never something of true value.  
  
In the antique world, there are many instances of scams and items that are far from common only to be prized at ridiculous costs just because "it looks old enough". However, within this sea of deception, often times there would be a hidden gem, a diamond covered in trash. Although I must admit that the particular gem I stumbled upon feels cursed, or perhaps more malevolent, as if maybe it would have been better to stay hidden.  
  
I usually search for various items either online through online groups or at antique events. Moreover, I am more inclined to visit antique stores and perhaps markets where someone might sell their granddad's old rifle, for example. I truly believe that often times "one man’s trash is another man’s treasure," but experience will also often tell me that sometimes trash is just masquerading as treasure.  
  
However, during a visit to the old town of Plovdiv, I stumbled upon a small local festival. There were various vendors, from local foods and jams to embroidery and some local crafts, but there was one that caught my eye. Situated at the far end of the festival’s marketplace, there was a small table that had various antique items placed on it. As I came closer, I started to observe even more items, such as sickles and other tools that were hanging, as well as some old pots and bottles. Various communist coins and pins were often put in boxes next to other Soviet items such as stamps and postcards. As I browsed through the collection, something shimmered in the background, as if alerting me to its presence.  
  
The old man followed my gaze and turned around before looking again at me. I felt mesmerized, as if something was protruding from a case filled with scrap pieces. The man simply walked towards the object, and without a word, he pulled it out. I noticed a small smile carved on his face as he walked towards me with the strange object that was becoming more clear the more he walked towards me.  
  
  
It was a very particular knife, something between a dagger and a mediaeval stiletto. It had a very pointy and almost rusted blade that tapered towards the tip. The blade was about 30 centimeters long and had a spear-shaped base. The interesting part, however, was the cross guard. It seemed to be made of bronze but was polished to almost perfection. The handle was made from presumably the same material and featured a topless woman holding the cross guard. Between her hands on the cross guard, there was an eye slot where a white pearl was situated, while runes were carved on both sides of the guard.  
  
I was mesmerised by the object as it felt heavy in my hands, but at the same time, its weight felt right. The handle design, although not ergonomic, felt comfortable in my hands. I swear, the more time I spent watching its design, the more I was captivated by it. The sun reflected on the handle, and I could feel its rays being amplified. For a moment, I felt the heat coming from them. But with the pearl, I saw various colours swirling as it shimmered.  
A wind had picked up, and I could feel it swirling around me while faint whispers could be vaguely heard. Something finally came down to me, as if being awoken by my senses, and I noticed that I stood a bit further from the stand. The old man seemed perplexed, yet he slowly grinned at my situation.  
He finally broke the silence while pulling up a small wooden box he had underneath the table. "Quite a beauty in it? I was trying to sell it, but no one really showed any particular interest in it. It used to belong to a neighbour of mine, but after his passing, his wife gave us various boxes of his stuff, including this."  
  
He opened the box only to reveal a small cash register.  
  
"If you want it, I can give it to you for 100 leva; now I don't know what it’s worth and never really bothered; I just want to get this stuff cleaned, you know!"  
  
I paused for a moment and took a glimpse at the knife once more. It felt right in my hands, and something was telling me that I should proceed with this purchase—something within me that I cannot describe. Without any hesitation, I pulled out my wallet, gave him his money, and left without saying a word.  
  
Needless to say, the days that followed were uneventful; however, I did some personal digging on my own regarding the dagger and placed it in various online forums, hoping to get something out of it. Multiple people, however, pointed me to some details that I had noticed but had zero knowledge about. For example, someone pointed out that the runes carved on the handle were the same and some similar to the runes found in the Rosetta of Pliska, a 7th-century artefact found in the first capital of Bulgaria. Others pointed out that the woman on the handle had a similar design to the Thracian women that are located in the Thracian tomb of Kazanlak. In addition to this design, some have also mentioned that the blade seems oddly similar to a lance or spear head. However, out of all the users online, one stood out to me. One that had identified the object as Lyudmila’s dagger.  
  
Allegedly, during the 70s and 80s, there was a rise in occultism among some of the elites of Bulgaria. Lyudmila Zhivkova, the daughter of Todor Zhivkov, a renowned communist leader during the People's Republic of Bulgaria, was one of those elites. There were many instances of her seeking guidance or even knowledge from one prominent oracle in Bulgaria called Baba Vanga.  
Vanga has long been an individual shrouded in mystery, as her life was rather tragic. Her lack of physical sight supposedly gave her visions of the unknown, thus foretelling the future and various other events that have and will take place. From what I could gather from this user," he told me that the particular dagger was used by Lyudmila at various occult gatherings as they were trying to reconnect with an ancient civilization called Yeath. In fact, what is even more surprising is that Lyudmila herself has published a research book on the Thracian tomb in Kazanlak, something that would appear to solidify this user’s beliefs.  
  
Things got weirder when the user started to ask me about the dagger and how I acquired it, and he was willing to pay me more than I had paid for it purely for him to have it. I politely declined, as I wasn’t planning to sell it yet. The individual got rather angry at some point and even used various profanities and threats, saying that I did not know what knowledge I was wielding and that it must be guarded by the correct people.  
I closed the conversation and blocked the user as I felt rather unsafe from the whole ordeal, but I must say it sparked a deep curiosity about the item. It wasn’t until I finally met my friend Alexander Dimitrov, a museum archivist,  
When I introduced him to the knife, he had in fact also confirmed some of the information regarding its design. He also mentioned that the brass seemed quite old; in fact, it could be even older than the 19th century. Although my interest peaked, I was feeling a sensation of jealousy. Something boiled inside me as he caressed that knife—something primal and nerve-wracking.  
Alexander then looked at me and placed the knife on the table, followed by a long pause. He smiled and carefully pulled out a small package of cigarettes from his side pocket.  
"I do not know what to tell you, Michael, but if you want, I can take this to the lab tomorrow and check- “  
  
“No, it's fine!” I said this abruptly while I took the knife and wrapped it in the linen cloth I had it in.   
“It’s okay for now. I wish you could leave me for tonight!”  
  
Alexander seemed suspicious of my behavior. I am sure he nodded, took his jacket, and left my apartment. I rushed to the window to check whether he was truly gone, and I could see him turn around and wave me goodbye. I subconsciously knew that both of us were somehow drawn to this knife, as if it sparked something between us—a tension of unknown desires. I knew he wanted it for himself. I knew he wanted it!  
  
Days have passed, and every day I have begun to be slowly absorbed by this cursed thing. It wasn’t until, however, one day, as I was caressing the blade, that I accidentally cut myself. The blood poured, and instinctively, I grabbed it by the handle to place it on the table. As I stood up, however, I felt it. The room began to swirl before me; the wind, accompanied by the very familiar whispers, came back around, engulfing me in their sea of unknown.  
  
I turned and looked at the knife, and I saw it glint as it absorbed the light from the nearby window. I moved closer, and the whispers turned into voices of unknown origin, a language that I could not physically speak yet that I could understand. The handle shone, and colours began to emit from it, causing me to fall into a state of hypnosis.  
  
I have vague memories of the whole ordeal, but the following nightmares that ensued gave me insights into the terror that I was exposed to. I simply remember being awoken in my living room, my clothes torn while blood poured from my chest. My room was in chaos, and I noticed the broken tables and glass around me while the dagger was in my hand.  
  
I remember the anxiety I felt and the horror I felt once I witnessed my body. A slit was made between my brows, and on my chest, I saw marked runes deeply cut into my skin. Blood oozed as I tried to patch them while trying to bring myself back to sanity from my hazy trance. I vomited shortly after, and it could be exhaustion or blood loss, but it didn’t take me long enough to simply pass out again on the cold floor.  
  
My dreams have ever since become more wild and horrifying. Towering and monolithic structures are visualised in my mind. There is a place that feels familiar—a desert or a dried steppe—where the wind is strong and the faint whispers are ever-present. There is light in this place, a bright one, but no source can be seen, as if this place illuminates itself. There were other more grotesque terrors, however. Once I dreamed of an ancient tunnel, and within it something dark loomed, something malevolent.  
  
I saw a small entrance to a deep tunnel; a fire was roaring while silhouettes of people stood around it. They caused a cacophony in my ears while the hidden beast roared in the depths. Pulsating echoes caused me to wake up, sweating as if I had a fever.  
I sent the dagger to Alex without any context and am starting to suspect that its effect has already taken a toll on him. I have already heard about his disappearance and the fact that he was accused of stealing a golden mask from the museum. Now I do not know what his intentions are, but whether or not he knows anything about the dagger or Lyudmila’s following is beyond me.  
  
Although I do not wish to be part of this anymore, there is something that crawls under my skin. Something that begs me for this newly acquired knowledge—a thirst, one may say— It is this thirst that also drives me insane, as the idea of what lurks in the shadows of the vast cosmos and the hidden knowledge it contains excites me. Yet, although the knife was gone from me, we had shared a connection, a connection bound by blood, and I can hear it calling me, and I will probably follow it.  
  
"Slunze dar Yeath!"
