\----

I just tried some of our voyage meals. Today was Insta Mash and a rehydrated chicken leg, and it is safe to say (I don't think the chicken is chicken). 

 I could hardly get the chicken down. It stuck to my throat and slid down at a snail's pace, but the Insta Mash wasn't that bad. I’m about to go into cryo-sleep now. I'll write back when I wake up. 

   

\----



July 2nd, 2176: I just got an emergency wake-up from the ship's AI, and, wait, where is everybody? The air has a deathly stillness, like something isn't right. We are way before our landing date, and everything is surprisingly tidy. Probably those janitorial bots I made, but they’re really just modified Roombas.



\-

Okay, I just looked at Johnson’s cryopod and….. He’s gone. I looked in Marian's, the sweet little old woman who had made cookies for everyone before the launch…. She’s gone, everyone's gone, I'm going to have to check the stock of food and figure out how to navigate and control the ss damned. All dead yet perfectly preserved by the little coolant from the cryogenic chamber, all of them look almost as if they are statues stuck in a perfect state of dreamful bliss, yet also despair, as if they could sense their final moments were coming 

 

\----

Okay, we have about  4 years' worth of food, and I found the guide to flying this disaster, so I'll get back to you when I figure out how to fly this.  And if anyone can read this, please send help. My coordinates are Latitude: 21.45709, Longitude: 153.40030, 35 clicks north. Passengers: 1

  
  


July 7th, 2176: Okay, I figured out how to fly this flaming piece of garbage. It’s getting pretty lonely in here. Today's meal is cheeseburger puree in a tube with dehydrated cola pills. Not bad, the texture is like a chunky clay, disgusting, but other than that, not bad. I’m sending out a rescue beacon to see if any stray voyages see me. If no one sees it in 4 days, I'm going to start flying back the way we came.

  
  
  


July 9th, 2176 Okay I've gotten no response yet but I’m hoping someone will see me. Just in case I've started trying to repair the cryo pods. I’m also going to try to repair the ship AI for ship analysis and to get an ETA on when I get to Earth, but, god, I hope it doesn't come to that. Now, as I drift off to sleep, the only sense of humanity I have to remember is the lonesome blinking light in the depths of space as I peer into the deep, cold, inky ocean on my way to whatever or whoever I'm going to encounter.



\----

  
  


Okay, so I got the Cryo Pod manual, and it seems the problem is the hose, so I should probably check that out. 

\----

It looks like it's leaking coolant, so I'm going to have to find a new coolant hose in one of those fancy soldiers' environment suits that protect them from the harsh environments. We packed them for when we found new planets, and everyone had their suits tailored to them, so I have to get into storage and find my suit.  

  


July 11, 2176 



No one came…  I’m starting to think there is no hope for me I miss my family, but now that I think about it they are probably gone. What if the entire world is gone? What if the only living human left is me, and I'm just stuck in this godforsaken void of despair? I am starting to lose my willpower. I’ll try my best, but I don't know how much longer I can last  

  


July 13 2176

Finally, thank god I got the ship AI working, and I'm going to do an analysis on Earth's condition. I am also doing a ship status report. I’ll write what I find later 

  


   \-----

….. Well, the status report came back from the AI, and… oh god, why, why did I have to make it? Why didn't my pod fail? Earth is gone; it imploded. We drilled the resources until the earth imploded due to a lack of material structure. Everyone died due to our own greed. God, reality is looking bleak. I'm not sure if I'll make it or if there is a reason to try even though there’s no hope in returning to the place I once called home. Home is gone, along with everyone that made it home

That's it, I've decided…. I'm going to set the autopilot to go to the nearest sun, Aurelius, and I'm going to go into cryo sleep. I have everything I need to repair the pod. I'm just going to go to sleep like nothing has happened, and I'm going to let Aurelius’ warmth whisk me away into nothingness. Nothing will remain of the USS Armstrong, and that's okay; no one's left to remember us anyway. Goodbye humanity. We had a good run.

Okay I’m not really sure what's going on but the strangest thing has happened to me. As I was flying into the system's sun there was a bright flash of light but then there was nothing just blackness and before I knew it I was in a house, but not like the ones I know but it was MY childhood home, except something was off, it was almost brighter? I dont know im still a little dazed but everything was more vibrant and all of an orangish hue to it like my poster of all of the astronauts that ever flew up into orbit their skin all had almost a reddish orange to it like a baby rabbit, But I had always dreamed of going into space well I guess I got what I always wanted, in a way. I haven’t found any life yet but maybe this world mirrors the people in my past as well. 

  
  
  


July 17th 2008

  


As I stumbled out of my childhood room something was off, the air smelt like burnt rubber and sulfur, I walked into my kitchen hoping to see my mother in there as she usually was, but when she turned around it was horrendous, it was like her face was play do all melty and wrong in every way. The skin was melting off of her face and I could see her eye sockets exposed and sickening, the bones looked charred and blackened like when she was cremated after she passed, as she was talking to me her voice became almost deeper as it distorted and melted just like her skin, she said only one phrase to me which was the most haunting part “wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake. up” over and over and over as she encroached me. Gripping my shoulders with an inhuman strength she hadn’t been that over powering against me since I was a child. She had started shaking my shoulders and as she did I got smaller and weaker until I was two feet shorter, her voice getting deeper and more shaking like the entire earth was shaking under her stern, haunting tone, “WAKE UP, WAKE UP, WAKE UP” she repeated as I collapsed onto that old wood floor I crumpled into a puddle I shut my eyes and fell into a deep slumber.

  


“Wake up honey, please I need you to wake up for mommy… please” my mother cried as she crumpled into my hospital bed, I slowly opened my weary eyes “Mom? Y-your face? Its normal” 

“What do you mean honey?” 

“I had a dream where I was an astronaut! It was amazing but then i flew into the sun and your face was scary and melted… But now you’re okay! W-w-what happened to me? Why am I in the hospital?”



“We dont need to worry about that right now baby.”

  
  
  
  


December 25th, 2045: I remember this moment from when I was younger I had gotten hit by a car in the street as I was playing. I was only eight it was a miracle I only got into a coma but I remember that dream with only one thought as we depart, what if it wasn’t just a dream, what if I was right.
