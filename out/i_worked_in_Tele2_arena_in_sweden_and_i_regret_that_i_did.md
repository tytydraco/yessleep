It was the early 2000s, and I was working as a security guard at Tele2 Arena in Sweden, a vast stadium where I had been employed for three years. The job was relatively straightforward due to the comprehensive security measures in place, making our tasks less demanding. Each shift consisted of three rounds, completed by myself, Adrian, and the recently hired Alex.  
  
Over the years, numerous staff members had mysteriously vanished during their shifts, leaving only Adrian and me to handle the work. The first to go missing was a 20-year-old named Jonathan, and the fourteenth was a guy named Tucker. This frequent occurrence had reduced our staff, leaving an eerie atmosphere lingering in the air.  
  
One night, as I patrolled the stadium, attending to light switches and restoring power, I reached the final room. This room was inconspicuous, resembling a small utility space with a colossal metal door leading into darkness. The door had a tendency to randomly open, requiring us to close it before moving on.  
  
Despite never entering the room before, curiosity overwhelmed me. However, fear held me back, prompting me to kick the door shut and hastily return to the main office.  
  
"Wow, you look stressed," Adrian remarked.  
  
"Yeah, that damn door is just too much. Why do we always get that weird feeling down there?" I asked.  
  
"Well, it's just because it's unidentified, I guess," he said.  
  
We continued our routine, and the next day, a new addition to our team, Alex, joined. I was tasked with showing him around the arena, guiding him through our nightly rounds.  
  
"Is it just these places three times?" Alex inquired.  
  
"Yep, not harder or easier," I replied.  
  
We reached the final location, the metal door room, and found the door, as usual, wide open.  
  
"Alex, could you close the door real quick?" I asked.  
  
"Sure, but why is it open?" he questioned.  
  
"Well, I don't know. In every round, it always looks like it's been opened. Just close it again, not harder, not easier," I explained.  
  
As Alex approached the door, Adrian contacted me through the walkie-talkie.  
  
"Hey, Stephen? You there?" Adrian's voice crackled.  
  
"Yeah, what's up?" I responded.  
  
"I see that the door is open again. Could you close it real quick?" he requested.  
  
"Yeah, I just finished showing Alex around, and he's closing it right now… Alex?"  
  
I looked at Alex, who stood at the door, staring into the darkness.  
  
"Alex?" I called again.  
  
Approaching him, I grabbed his shoulder, and he snapped out of his trance, looking at me without offering any explanation for his behavior.  
  
"What's in there?" he asked.  
  
Chills ran down my spine, and I couldn't fathom why at that moment.  
  
"I think it's a boiler room. Why are you asking?" I replied.  
  
He glanced at me, then back inside. "Okay, I thought I heard something from inside there, but it seemed to be a hallucination."  
  
Perplexed, I instructed him to close the door, and we returned to the office. Later, during my shift, I found myself back at the boiler room. To my dismay, the door was open again.  
  
"F\*\*\*!" I muttered. I reluctantly approached the door, and through the walkie-talkie, Alex's voice echoed.  
  
"Hey, I see that the light for the 'boiler room' is open again," he observed.  
  
"Yeah, I'm closing it real quick," I replied.  
  
This time was different. Something compelled me to investigate the room. Unwilling to go alone, I decided to talk to Alex through the walkie-talkie as I ventured inside.  
  
"Hey, Alex. I want to go inside the room and investigate it. So, I'm updating you with what I see," I said.  
  
"Alright. Be careful," he cautioned.  
  
As I proceeded, the initial part of the room mirrored the usual rounds. However, I reached a door with four locks, constructed from thick metal. It took me ten minutes to unlock it, revealing a round staircase leading upward.  
  
"Hey, Stephen. I haven't heard from you for a while. What do you see?" Alex inquired.  
  
I explained the door and the staircase. Upon reaching the top, I discovered another room and heard a distorted voice through the walkie-talkie, unmistakably Alex's voice.  
  
"Alex? I can't understand what you're saying. Can you repeat?" I requested.  
  
"Stephen! Y#u %¤st run %w?y! Th(re'&s something %¤#re! he tried to say.  
  
"What? Okay, radio silence, Alex. I don't understand you. It must be a bad connec…"  
  
I looked ahead and saw a series of photos with text. The first depicted Jonathan, labeled "number 1." As I rifled through them, I found Tucker labeled "number 14." The photo that sent shivers down my spine was labeled "number 20" – a picture of me.  
  
Suddenly, a loud bang reverberated from downstairs, followed by a deafening roar.  
  
"WHAT THE F\*\*\* WAS THAT!" I shouted through the walkie-talkie.  
  
Finally, the lagging stopped, and I heard Alex clearly:  
  
"THE MONITORS WERE SHOWING A GIGANTIC MAN/CREATURE OR WHATEVER RUNNING INSIDE THE METAL DOOR AND SLAMMING IT SHUT! RUN FOR GOD'S SAKE! RUN!"  
  
My eyes widened. I couldn't comprehend what was happening. I raced down the staircase and saw someone or something in a doorway. It wiggled menacingly, growling and charging towards me while chanting, "NUMBER 20 SHALL BEGIN! NUMBER 20 SHALL BEGIN!"  
  
I got a quick glimce of the creature. It were a hairless creature, with grey rotten skin and a pale face. It had a twisted smile stretching from ear to ear, although it was unclear if the creature even had ears. The creature carried a long axe that scraped along the floor as it ran. Its appearance was unsettling, with a grotesque demeanor and an aggressive, menacing behavior.  
  
  
I sprinted in panic out of the room, reaching the locked metal door. The creature approached, its roar growing louder by the second. Suddenly, I fell out of the room, and Alex and Adrian swiftly closed and locked the door. They grabbed me, carrying me out of Tele2 Arena.  
  
Once outside, I quit my job immediately, vowing never to return to that place. I even left Sweden, never to set foot in the stadium again. Apart from this, nothing seemingly happened. So, be cautious of the unknown. I should have never entered that room; the door was always open because "IT" wanted us to go in. The disturbance we felt closing it was because "IT" was always watching from the darkness inside of the room.
