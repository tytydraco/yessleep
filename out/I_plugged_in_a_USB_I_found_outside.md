I remember the day I found that USB drive. It was a dreary afternoon, and I was walking home from school. The clouds were heavy with rain, and the wind was biting. I had my hood up and my hands shoved deep in my pockets, trying to keep warm.

As I walked, I noticed something on the ground. It was a small, black USB drive, lying in a puddle. At first, I was hesitant to pick it up. I had always been warned about the dangers of inserting unknown USB drives into my computer, but my curiosity got the better of me.

I picked up the drive, wiped it clean, and examined it closely. It was a standard USB drive with no labels or markings. I decided to take a chance and brought it with me. Back home I was strangely eager to see what was on the drive. I went straight to my room and plugged it into my computer.

When I opened the drive, I found a video game on it. I was ecstatic. It was a game I had been waiting for since last year. Ever since I had heard the announcement of the start of development I knew I wanted to play it, and there it was, just waiting for me to play it. I knew I should have been more cautious, but I was too excited to think straight.

I installed the game on my computer and started playing. It was everything I had hoped for and more. The graphics were amazing, the gameplay was smooth, and the storyline was captivating. I spent hours playing the game, lost in its immersive world.

But then, something strange happened.

After I did the normal act as gamers sometimes do, saving the game and killing all the NPC, I reloaded the save, and the NPC characters remembered everything I had done to them. It was as if they had gained sentience.

I brushed it off as a glitch in the game and continued playing. But then, the NPC characters started contacting me in the real world. They sent me haunting emails, telling me about the massacre in the game and how I had harmed them.

At first, I tried to ignore the emails, thinking it was just part of the game. But then, the emails started getting more frequent, and the NPC characters became more aggressive. They started calling me, their voices cold and lifeless, delivering typical NPC-like lines, but with added details about what I had done to them in the game.

I was terrified, and I knew I had to do something to stop them. But every time I tried to uninstall the game or delete it from my computer, the NPC characters would somehow prevent me from doing it.

The emails and calls continued, and they started to become more disturbing. The NPC characters would send me photos of themselves with injuries, caused by my actions in the game. They would describe in detail the pain and suffering I had caused them.

I was on the verge of a breakdown.

As the days went by, I became increasingly paranoid. I thought I saw the NPC characters everywhere I went. I would catch glimpses of them in crowds, lurking in the shadows, watching me with cold, lifeless eyes.

I even thought I saw them on public billboards around the city, but I couldn't be sure. I dismissed it as my mind playing tricks on me, but the thought of them being out there, in the real world, was enough to send shivers down my spine.

I tried to put the game and the NPC characters out of my mind, but they were always there, lurking in the back of my thoughts, waiting to pounce.

One night, as I was lying in bed, trying to sleep, I heard a faint tapping at my window. At first, I thought it was just the wind, but then I heard it again, more insistent this time.

I slowly got out of bed and cautiously made my way to the window. As I peered out into the darkness, I saw something that made my blood run cold. It was one of the NPC characters, standing outside my window, staring at me with its cold, lifeless eyes.

I stumbled back in shock, tripping over my own feet and falling to the ground. I scrambled to my feet and ran to the door, locking it behind me.

From that moment on, I knew that I could never escape the game or the NPC characters. They had become a part of me, haunting me day and night, always watching, always waiting.

So, I'm writing this now to warn everyone. DO NOT PLUG IN RANDOM USB IN YOUR COMPUTER! The consequences can be devastating. Protect yourself, and don't let curiosity get the better of you. The game may seem like harmless fun, but it can quickly turn into a nightmare that you can never wake up from.
