“Bye!” My wife said as she began to walk out the door. “Bye!” I yelled back before realizing she didn’t hear me. I rush outside to say goodbye. She laughs knowing she closed the door on me before I could get a chance to say bye back. I like to play games a lot, and my setup is in my basement. I walk downstairs to where it is.

I play for a few hours before hopping off. I made a Grubhub order and turn on TV. I laugh at the TV show “Ha! Because they never found him!” I hear the knock at the door. I open the door, say thank you and tipped the guy. And began to eat some of my really good sandwich from Subway.

I hear a window open. We have been having some really strong winds lately and thought that was what it was. I didn’t mind it at first, but for some reason it really bothered me. So I went to check and sure enough it was wide open. I knew immediately someone was in the house because our winds don’t do that. I run to my room and shaking, I grab my handgun. I hear a load crash in the basement.

I try and get close to the basement door, I run outside to my storm cellar. I shut the door quietly as to not alert my position. I see him…he has the same handgun… He also looks shockingly like me, I immediately think back to scary stories I see on Reddit about skin walkers. “Skinwalkers aren’t real…” I whisper to myself. I reach for my phone in my pocket. It’s not there… I had no other choice but to but to fight, I can’t just run back. These doors are pretty heavy and lifting them to go up is gonna make some noise.

I begin to shoot at the “skinwalker.” He sounded normal when I shot him, must’ve been lighting. I dodge a bullet, I take a few more shots then I run back upstairs to grab my ph- Where is it? I used it to make the order! I feel a gun behind my head. He cocks it, “Why the fuck would you keep me in there for so DAMN LONG!” I begin to say you’ve got the wrong guy but as I turn around I notice he is identical to me, I wonder why he sounded normal… At this point, I had no idea why he looked like me. He says “ANSWER THE DAMN QUESTION!” “You have the wrong guy! I didn’t take anyone…” I say calmly. “WELL THEN WHY THE HELL DO WE LOOK SIMILAR HMM?” “I don’t know..”

I get very defensive and pull out my gun. “I gave you a chance…” I say “I gave you food and water to live in there.” “ I’m probably the nicest skinwalker out there.” I could’ve killed as soon as I saw you.” I begin to laugh hysterically. “HA! BECAUSE THEY NEVER FOUND HIM!” I shot him and ate the body. It’s pretty good when you put it with lemon and pepper.

My wife gets back from work. “Hey! What did you do?” “Oh, nothing much.”
