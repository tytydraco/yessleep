The pandemic had hit quite hard on me as I had lost my job working at the local shops and having the store having to lay off 30% of their staff I was one of the unlucky few picked. I wasn't lucky finding any jobs as most had closed or where families that were not willing to take on a 20 old drop out student who never finished. I survived by doing unsavory entertainment for business men and strangers. I don't enjoy it so I won't talk about  its nsavery work and it doesn't pay well.

Besides, there's no harm living with your mother for a bit. How long can this pandemic be, like what 3 months at least I'll be able to find a better job. I thought to myself. Boy was I wrong. A year into the pandemic and money was getting very thin and food prices were through the roof. Some day my mother and I only had bread and butter to eat.

Not to mention my mother's declining health and chemo made it more harder. The pills she needed were quite expensive and most of our money was going towards it but as of lately we couldn't even afford paying for those. 

Now you're wondering when do I start my night shift and the factory. Well while I was prowling the streets looking for potential customers I came across a man standing alone under a street lamp. 

Now I know people are gonna say don't do that you're gonna get yourself killed but I needed money and I was desperate. I walked up to the man and I gave him a gentle tap. The Stranger turned around and looked at me with the coldest stare I've ever seen. He then spoke in a gentle but gruff tone.

"Is there anything I can help you with ma'am"

"I am looking for some work and wondering if you liked to go behind that alley and I'll show you a good time" I replied hesitantly. You never know what customers you're gonna deal with. I ran into a few bad apples and was hospitalized but that's a story for another time.

He looked up and down at me then sighed. 

"No ma'am I'm not interested tonight"

"Please sir I need the money my mother is in dire need of treatment and"...

He cut me off. 

"Look ma'am I'm not interested but I can offer you a job working for me"

I was shocked, it's been nearly two years since I applied for jobs so naturally I accepted.

What's the job? I enquired

He looked at me and gave me a note. Now these should have raised even more red flags but I didn't care, I finally had an opportunity to earn decent money and afford medication for my mother. After he handed me the note I looked and gasped $40 an hour 12 hour shifts from 5pm to 5am.

"Sir are you pulling my leg; I bolted up with excitement not evening trying to contain the excitement. He looked at me.

"You start tomorrow, don't be late. Everything will be covered on orientation so please don't ask and save them for tomorrow".

"Yes sir I" said while walking off.

What a lucky night I thought to myself mother would be so pleased. I got home around midnight not making any money but hey you can't blame a girl who got offered a once in a lifetime opportunity and be distracted. I got home and announced to my mother that I got hired by a company. She was a little skeptical at first.

"Do you know what company you're working for dear?" My mother enquired.

"He said don't ask if everything will be explained tomorrow". I shot back

Mother gave me the coldest stare like I've made the dumbest decision of my life, couldn't blame her I wasn't the brightest when coming to big decisions like these, she always said I went ahead first.

"But mum, we can finally live comfortably and pay for your medications". I retorted.

Mother didn't reply as she had collapsed and was asleep. The cancer had taken a lot from her and had badly any energy to do most menial things. I kissed mother on the forehead and turned off the lights. 

"Tomorrow everything's gonna change for the best." I whispered while closing the door. The next day came across and I ran down to greet my mother who was sitting on the couch watching the tv. Mother, I'm off to work. She lifted a finger to indicate she heard me.

As I opened the door I was greeted with a black Sudan waiting for me on the Parkway.Strangely, I walked up to the car and the dark tinted windows rolled down and I was greeted  by the man I met last night.

"Um hello" I asked shakely.

"Hello miss Alex please get there was a slight change so Im picking you up if that's all right". He replied.

"How did you find my address and also how did you know my name"?
 
"Please get in, all questions when we get to the warehouse". As he waved me in.

Now being a bit skeptical I hopped into the car and we drove off. We passed houses and streets that I've never seen before and street names I couldn't even pronounce. I looked at the man and wondered if I had made a horrible choice in accepting this job offer. I sat in silent dozing off when suddenly the car jerked to a screeching stop.

"Where here the man" pronounced with a grumpy and tired tone.

I got out of the car and looked around my surroundings. It looked like you're ordinary. Mega warehouse. But the oddest thing was that there was now company logo anywhere to be seen.

"Follow me please," the man asked. 
"You'll be working alongside Abby who takes over after you completed your shift but for now she'll be working with you to catch you up on how things work here".

He led me up a flight of stairs where I was greeted by an energetic and outgoing young woman around my age.

"Hi you must be the new guard I'm Abby I'll be going through basic trading and wait to watch for"

I nodded in  agreement. The man had already left us and was long gone.

"Perfect, do you know the basics on how a gun works Alex?" Abby asked.
 
I nodded again
"Well good you gotta know the things out there are very territorial and dangerous down there."

I looked at her in confusion. She must have guessed by the expression on my face.

The mannequins. They are very territorial about the area and hate any intruders. 

I looked puzzled trying to comprehend what Abby said about mannequins coming to life. Great, I couldn't believe her even if I tried. Mannequins that are alive that's ridiculous. So I asked what happens if they get you.

She shot me a look and gestured to follow her down to the floor level. Once we got down there I saw rows and rows of mannequin all lined up in semicircles. 

"It makes it easier to patrol the area like that," she said.

"How many mannequins are there"  I asked curious because the whole floor was covered in the creepy plastic things

"2000 mannequins," she replied.

I quaked at that answer. She fumbled in her pockets and pulled out a keychain and found the correct keys. She opened the door to a dark room and she flicked the switch. I felt shivers run down my spine as I saw from across the room a mannequin that looked exactly like me just sitting in the fetal position. I panicked a bit at the uncanny resemblance it had on me but held it in.

"Um Abby, why is that mannequin locked up?" I answered puzzled. 

Abby replied by bringing out a flashlight and turning the lights off and shining a light on the mannequin. I liked back in shock seeing the mannequin had glowing purple lines where the joints are and bright purple mixed with blue and red tribal paint on its face with a gray line around the breast painted like zig zags and black running down the inner thighs and and chest.

"What the hell?! I exclaimed
"What are they as i said" trying to get a closer look. I got closer to the glass and as soon as my hand touched the glass the mannequin peered its head up and gave me a grin. I jumped back, tripping over my foot and landing with a loud thump on my arse. 

"What the hell Abby, what is that?" I protested in fear.

"Those are the things we're going to have to look out for or…" 
"They are somehow easier to spot with a black light but under normal light it's near impossible to tell the difference between them."

"Or what?"

She shows me another cage. This time stood a disassembled mannequin on the floor. Body parts flayed around the room.

"Or you end up like him"

"Who I "asked 

"Andrew, he got jumped by them and well you see what they can do".  Never let them surround you and always have your pistol ready".

I looked at Abby and back at Andrew. What have I gotten myself into?" I thought to myself. We exited the room and went back to the office. Abby sat down and asked any questions. I asked how to take them down and she replied that a shot or hard hit towards the head or chest does the trick. I nodded and I asked how many are usually down there. And like clockwork she replied.

"Usually we deal with one or two, at most a bit unlucky Andrew dealt with 7 and he got jumped."

I looked at Abby and down at the floor contplanting she noticed my expression. And gave a reading nod that I can handle this. I half smiled back at her not shaking the uncanny feeling of me seeing that mannequin looking just like me. That thing creeped me out the most. Will I turn into one of those if I'm not careful. I kept those thoughts to myself and asked. 

"How often do I need to do a perimeter check?"

"She replied once every two hours so six times during your shift".

Abby got up from her chair and headed towards some lockers where she pulled out a flashlight and a pistol and handed them towards me As Well as a radio.

"Since tonight is your first shift I'll help you out and guide you" she smiled.

We both got up and headed for our rounds around the wherehouse Shing our torches at the mannequins when Abby grabbed my hand and told me to send. Her hands felt off but I ignored it.  She said do you hear that we both stayed still and then we heard a scuttling noise coming from  down the aisle we are in. Abby quickly switched her black light on and the room was illuminated by a dark purple hue. 

We scanned the mannequins when the lights shine onto one its bright patterns had been revealed and suddenly as à animal that has been caught in mid action it lept towards Abby bearing its claws out. Abby quickly got out and shot the thing in the head.The mannequin's head landed with a thump and its body fell apart. I looked shocked.

When suddenly we heard more scuttling coming from Further down. 

'Your turn' Abby proclaimed

I quickly got my light and gun ready when suddenly the scuttling got  closer and I looked behind me to a female mannequin right behind me. I panicked and dropped my light causing it to be dark. I ducked under the table that was close by and in a few seconds I heard gunshots and then this. Abby had taken out the female mannequin. Abby found me under the table huddled into a ball and laughed .

'Don't worry I was a nervous wreck.
On my first day you get used to this, trust me.'

As she spoke to me I noticed that her eyes were glazy and dark thinking it was a trick of the eye. I nodded and got my flashlight and we finished the rest of the patrol. Since it was my first day I was told many things about this place and what they do during the day. When finally home time came I packed my things and waved Abby goodbye.

When I walked out the door I was greeted by the man who picked me up in his black sedan. He looked at me and gusseted for me to go in. I hoped In and we drove off towards my house.

 "Hey, I never got your 
name."
 
 "Ivan replied".

"Well nice to meet you Ivan and thank you" I replied.

Soon I dozed off into a sleep and next minute I was home I got out and thanked Ivan for the lift and he waved goodbye. As soon as I entered the house I got a message from an unknown number. It read as tomorrow pick up at 5pm please wait outside 10 minutes before.I looked up thinking it was Ivan. I looked at the time best. I better get to bed, I thought.

The following five weeks went without incident. I got better at detecting those creatures and Abby was proud of the improvement. The money I received helped my mother substantially   and her health was improving. 

Those all changed however on my 20th week working alone. The day started as  picked up by Ivan and as I headed towards our place I fell asleep once again on the way there. I headed towards the building and got up and saw Abby there. Apparently she told me there was a recent spike in creature sightings and worried she wanted to help me. I gladly nodded. Not question the legitimacy but hey great company would be nice it gets lonely.

We headed towards the locked and Abby handed me my flashlight and pistol and waited for our first grounds of patrol. As the hour got closer we prepared our gear and headed down to the floor. We headed down and Abby suggested we split up and take tow aisle to get more ground quickly. I agreed, we split going down our separate aisle.

As I was about to finish my aisle I heard a scuttling noise. I looked around and saw nothing when my light started to flicker. Panicking, I gave it the old age trick of hitting until it worked. Eventually it shone again. And as I faced it up I screamed in absolute terror as one of the mannequin was only ten feet away from me. 

I shone the black light at it, sighing in relief that it was only a normal mannequin. But the oddest thing is that it looked so much like Abby. I crept closer to the Abby look alike when suddenly it turned its head and started a full on sprint at me. Panicking, I grabbed my pistol and fired a few shots at it..

Fuck I know I got that thing then I realised that the bullets I. My pistol where all blanks fearing for my life I threw the postal at the Abby mannequin and bolted towards the stairs but as I got near them 22 other mannequin were blocking my path. I heard maniacal laughter and turned around to see Abbey look alike a mannequin staring at me. I shone my blacklight at her with revealed fiery red markings adorn her body and maori markings on her back. 

She pointed a finger and 4 of the other mannequin jumped on me with the click of her finger they tore my clothes off leaving me bare. I yelled out to her to stop but she just smiled. I heard a strange noise which sounded like plastic rubbing against plastic. I looked down to see my legs were turning to plastic and they let me go and I fell to the ground.  Saw the plastic creeping up towards me.

My hands got stiff and I couldn't move. Abby then ordered them to throw me into the cage with the other mannequin but somehow it managed to run past us and escape. She then closed the gates and ordered the mannequin to leave. I sat stuck in my position for god knows how long until I learnt to move my joints. It took me a while to learn how to move my fave but eventually I could walk. 

I must escape, I thought to myself. I heard chatter and noise coming towards the door and I decided to sit down onto the fetal position and when I looked up I saw myself staying at me I smiled and she flew backwards and tripped. Realizing this was a loop I planned my escape. And waited in the dark room for almost 3 months when I heard the room doors opening and Abby alongside 4 other mannequins with my plastic body by their side. When I heard the cage unlock I bolted for the exit and toward the staff room where I found this computer I'm typing on.

I don't know how long I have heard them banging at the door. So here's my warning: don't ever take the offer of being a night guard at this warehouse or you will end up with a date similar to mine or worse.
