CW log #1  
Greetings, I am Steve, the head pilot of the illustrious interstellar vessel, Nero. Our mission is ambitious, as we have set forth on a journey that will span a staggering 1000 years. Already a decade into our odyssey, we have 990 years ahead of us. The marvels of technology have granted us the ability to enter long stasis periods known as neoro-sleep, which helps preserve us during the voyage.  
  
Today, I emerged from a grueling ten-year neoro-sleep cycle. The aftermath of neoro-sleep is always disorienting and nauseating. It felt like I was a newborn, struggling to regain control of my limbs and balance. But as the minutes passed, the sensation faded, and I was ready to fulfill my duties.  
  
Upon my awakening, I embarked on a comprehensive inspection of the ship. The initial report revealed some troubling issues that demanded my attention:  
  
Engine #2 was operating at a mere 98% speed, and despite my best efforts, I could not determine the root cause of this slight malfunction.  
Cosmic solar panels had sustained minor damages, resembling the impact of comets. This was puzzling, considering Nero's state-of-the-art auto-pilot system, which should have expertly navigated such hazards.  
The mainframe prompt showed signs of slowing down, hampered by some minor barriers.  
  
While I managed to resolve the mainframe issue, the engine problem eluded me, and the cosmic solar was still functional but required vigilant monitoring. As the head pilot, it was my duty to ensure that Nero was in top condition for the continued journey.

Wendy here, a member of WHP, and apparently, I'm the designated log-keeper now. Forgive my lack of experience in this, but here's the latest report.  
  
Engines #1 and #3 were functioning at 100%, but Engine #2 persisted in running at 95%, while Engine #4 operated at 97%. Despite thorough investigations, the engine issues remained a mystery.  
Cosmic solar panels showed signs of further deterioration, which didn't make sense. Were we encountering unforeseen cosmic phenomena that our autopilot failed to detect?  
The mainframe prompt was acting peculiar, burdened with unnecessary tasks that hindered overall performance. My attempts to fix it were in vain, leaving me frustrated, compounded by the residual effects of neoro-sleep.  
  
To be honest, I struggled with the side effects of neoro-sleep more than Steve did. My headaches persisted, making it hard to focus on the ship's growing problems. It's remarkable how he managed to overcome them so swiftly.

Steve reporting in. I woke up this time with an agonizing headache, and it felt like someone had dropped a heavy object on my skull. Concerns about the neoro-capsules being compromised plagued my mind, but there was no time to dwell on that. The situation demanded immediate attention.  
  
Engines were still not performing optimally, and I decided to initiate a complete reset, hoping it would rectify the problem over time.  
Cosmic solar required extensive repair, diverting most of my efforts towards restoring its functionality.  
The mainframe prompt continued to act up, with errors that seemed too deliberate to be mere glitches. Suspicions arose about potential external interventions or hidden anomalies within the AI system.  
  
To regain control, I activated the NMAG-SVC command, which should have prioritized essential tasks, yet the mainframe seemed to defy my orders. The gravity of our situation was starting to weigh heavily on me.  
  
I completed the necessary tasks, but the looming uncertainty of our predicament cast a shadow over my confidence. What had caused these issues? Were they connected somehow? Doubts crept into my mind, questioning if we would ever reach our destination unharmed.

The agony this time was unlike anything I had experienced before. I felt like my body was on the verge of breaking, and my mind was on the edge of explosion. It was unbearable. But amidst the pain, I pressed on to fulfill my responsibilities.  
  
The engines' condition worsened despite the reset, and they now ran at a mere 90% capacity. The anomaly baffled me, as if a relentless force was deliberately hindering our progress.  
The cosmic solar panels had been damaged again, and this time, the impact marks formed a recognizable pattern. It was the same pattern I had seen when I repaired them earlier. How was this possible?  
The mainframe prompt was an enigma, stubbornly resisting any attempt to restore it to proper functionality. It felt as if the ship itself was alive, and it had malevolently turned against us.  
  
The crew's fear and paranoia intensified as strange occurrences multiplied. Shadows seemed to dance in the corners, and eerie whispers haunted the dimly lit corridors. It was as though the ship itself had become a nightmarish labyrinth of secrets and malevolent entities.  
  
As we sought answers, I stumbled upon a mysterious device hidden behind the control panel. It was foreign, with an aura of ancient malevolence that sent shivers down my spine. I knew then that our troubles were not mere malfunctions, but something far darker, rooted in the history of this cursed vessel.

The neoro-sleep side-effects were more severe than ever before, rendering me almost incapacitated. But I had seen something outside the shipâ€”a glimpse of an otherworldly entity that defied explanation. My mind told me it was a hallucination, but the terror in my heart spoke differently.  
  
The engines now ran at a dismal 80% capacity, nearing a catastrophic failure. The reset had backfired, and we were hurtling towards disaster.  
The cosmic solar panels displayed the same pattern as the marks of damage. Whatever cursed us seemed to be mocking us with its malevolence.  
The mainframe prompt was now overtaken by an insidious presence. Every click led to errors, and the AI defied any command we issued.  
  
The once-celestial voyage had become a descent into an abyss of horror. It was clear that the malevolent force had consumed Nero, and we were mere pawns in its grand design.  
  
My only hope now is that this distress call reaches someone, anyone, who can aid us in breaking free from the grip of this relentless darkness. We were not merely facing technical malfunctions or cosmic hazards; we were confronting an ancient evil that sought to devour our very souls. The fate of Nero and its crew hangs in the balance, and our struggle for survival has become an epic battle between light and darkness.
