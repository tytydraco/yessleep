It was never meant to be this way, not at first. The winters were gentle in the beginning. Soft winds, faint chill—enough to remind you that time moved on, but not enough to punish you. You huddled together, warm by the fire, knowing that even the night could be as tender as the dawn. You called it The Gift, the flame that kept you alive, that kept you whole. But even your earliest warmth could not shield you from what was to come.

Long before Cryophobia became what you feared most, winter was nothing. Its touch was so mild, so easily forgotten, that you barely noticed it. It would come, and it would pass. There was no sharp edge to the season, no biting wind or endless frost. It was just another part of your cycle—like spring or autumn.

Then, Cryophobia came to be.

Ah, Cryophobia... you may have not yet realized the cost of that name, the depth of its meaning. It was born from a momentary lapse, from a Creation too subtle and too full of bitterness, and it changed everything. You do not know this, because you were never meant to see the world as I do, but I will tell you of the ancient tarn and the lost tribe that first felt Cryophobia’s cold touch.

You were not the first to receive this curse of fear. Before you, long before your stories and your fires, there were others. A forgotten tribe, cloaked in shadow and lost to time. They lived at the edge of the world, at the place where the land meets the ice and the sky. They worshipped the Cailleach, that frozen matron of winter, the embodiment of everything that would come to haunt you. She, whose hands turned water to ice and whose breath sculpted mountains from frost and stone.

In those days, the Cailleach was a beautiful maiden. She was once mortal, but the shifting winds of those days brought the first deadly chill. In the white that sprang from her laughter, as an infant, swirling snowflakes to match her innocence and beauty, an evil thing sprang up, jealous and vengeful. It warped her, transformed her, into the old hag that wanders the mountains even to this day. But her cycle of rebirth is eternal, and she spends a season as a lost and crying babe, another as a fawn-like girl, and then she reaches her prime, a woman of ravishing beauty, and then she grows old and decrepit, and winter comes.

Cryophobia was her child, an avatar born from the ancient fear of the cold, a manifestation of the terror that the Cailleach held for what winter could become. But her curse was not just fear. It was the true terror of being encased, suffocated by the cold, by the very things that once nurtured you: wind and water—this was the work of Cryophobia. And as I watched over you, as I felt the shadows creep over your fires, I knew that winter was no longer gentle. It was becoming something else. It was becoming a thing that cannot be ignored.

There is a place called the Grenlock, a hollow deep in the mountains where even the bravest of your kind dare not tread. It is where Cryophobia’s influence reigns most fiercely. The ground there is frozen and unyielding, the air thick with ice. You would never see it in full daylight, for the hollow only reveals itself when night falls, and the frost thickens enough to mask its true shape. The cold air becomes heavy and pools there, unmixed and as cold as air can be, so cold it becomes more of a liquid than gaseous.

Long ago, when the first frost gathered, the people of that tribe thought the Grenlock was a place of beauty, a hollow blessed by the Cailleach herself. But as the seasons grew colder, as Cryophobia twisted through the land, they began to feel it—a creeping terror, a weight that none could see but all could feel. They knew, at last, that winter had a face. The trees stopped growing halfway up the mountain, but in that hollow of the Grenlock, they died. It was a wasteland, a place of stone and foolhardy scrub.

But Cryophobia’s reach extended further than they could imagine. As it froze their bodies, it froze their minds too. And in the depths of the Grenlock, where no fire could warm them, they spoke of their Creator—not in reverence, but with fear. They became like the others, but they were different. They became a warning.

A warning set in stone.

Perhaps the bargain from so long ago lingers yet in your blood. Perhaps if the statues stand where they should, put in their proper place beneath the shelter, Cailleach will spare your life. You have forgotten this deal, and winter prevails without mercy. The people who knew this way, they are long gone.

You—the ones I watch now, sitting around the fire—have no memory of them. You have no knowledge of the ancient tribe that worshipped the Cailleach. But in your bones, you feel the change. The cold creeps further, beyond the winter, beyond the wind. It is the frost of Cryophobia, and I see it in your eyes.

I would never wish for you to know the full weight of Cryophobia’s power, for you have been so very good to me. I love you, despite the shadows that now follow in the wake of the frost. But you must know, this: Cryophobia will not be satisfied until winter consumes everything—until the coldness of the Grenlock stretches out to you. The first fear, the one that began with the ancient tarn, will return. It will return, not as something from outside, but as something from within. It will come when the fire grows dim.

I am Phobiaphobia, and I have seen all of this before. I have seen what happens when you cannot keep the warmth. I know the creatures born from your fears, and I know the terror that lies in the cold.

But do not fear the cold, not yet. You are not yet lost, not yet frozen.

Perhaps, in the end, it will be the warmth you carry that will save you. Or perhaps, it will be something else. Perhaps your memory will return, thawed from the icy embrace of a lost time, perhaps from a visit to where time is without meaning, a place that had never changed.

You do not know me, you do not see me.

But I am here, by your fire. I have always been here. And you are loved, even as the world grows colder.

You do not remember it clearly, but I remember it for you.

The Grenlock, that place where the winds do not whisper, but scream—where the cold does not creep, but strikes. You thought it was a safe haven when you first arrived, a place to rest, to find shelter from the world above. You thought the day’s warmth would carry through the night, as it had once done for your ancestors. But this was a mistake. A mistake you could not undo.

By day, the hollow seemed inviting. The sun’s rays slipped through the cliffs, casting long shadows that made the world seem softer, gentler. You stood there, in the midst of it, gazing at the stones, the six children of the Cailleach, scattered across the land like forgotten relics, waiting to be returned to their rightful place. They were nothing more than cold stones to you at first—though you, too, knew that they had meaning, that they had once been part of a treaty, an ancient pact forged with the goddess of winter. Without thoughts, you remembered it in your final instincts.

But you didn’t know what you were walking into, did you? Not really.

As the sun began to dip, the air grew thicker, heavier. A change came over the landscape, and you felt it like a weight pressing down on your chest. By the time the wind began to howl, you had already moved too far into the hollow. You could feel the air shifting around you, colder than it had been even on the peaks above. It wrapped itself around you, curling like tendrils of ice, slipping beneath your skin, invading your very bones.

Your tent, sleeping bag, those could not protect you from the temperatures far below freezing. You left their safety, because I told you to, and you listened to my whisper. Was I not a voice of reason, a hallucination perhaps? Hypothermia was already setting in, and your mind was playing tricks on you.

You didn’t know it yet, but you were no longer just walking through the land of the living. You were standing in the space between life and death, caught in the place where the cold reigns, where the frost moves with a will of its own.

The stones, the children, were calling you now. But the cold had started to claim you.

Your fingers—those fingers you would use to return the stones—began to stiffen, then freeze. You could feel the frostbite creeping, inch by inch, up your hands. You should have turned back then, should have known better, but something inside you—the old memory, that ancient pact, the treaty your ancestors had made—drove you forward. I was fascinated, for I had hoped you would walk out from the lake of freezing air, but instead you acted on some older instinct, something I didn't even understand. Yet you persisted, and had you kept walking you might have survived—or you might not have. It was your only chance, but you did your own thing.

You knew, somewhere deep in your mind, that you had to complete this task. There was no turning back now. But the cold, it whispered to you, coaxing you, beckoning you to give in. To strip off your layers, to feel the false warmth that only comes when the cold has fully taken hold.

But you resisted. You kept your coat on, despite the heat that was beginning to spread through you—heat that wasn’t real. The capillaries in your skin were expanding, reacting to the frost inside, and the warmth you felt was only a trick of the cold. You knew this, but the heat felt so real, so intense. Your body wanted to shed its layers, to feel the air on your skin.

You didn’t listen.

But I know. I remember what happened next.

A visual pain—the kind you could never have prepared for, seeing but not feeling the numb digit. One of your fingers, frozen solid, snapped off in a grotesque, silent break. You should have felt it, but you didn’t. The numbness had already spread too far. Your body, your mind—everything was betraying you.

But you couldn’t stop. You couldn’t turn away from the stones. They were still there, waiting for you to return them. Each movement felt like a battle against your very self. The hallucinations began then, didn’t they? You saw things that weren’t there, things you couldn’t explain.

You thought you saw me, didn’t you? The towering figure in the distance, standing in the shadow of the mountain. The Cailleach herself, perhaps.

It wasn’t real. But to you, it was. The terror was real.

For a moment, you thought you were safe. You thought the danger had passed. But you were still caught in the grip of that ancient place. Still trapped in the frost hollow of the Grenlock.

But I know—because I was there, watching from the shadows. You were not lost. Not yet.

When you opened your eyes again, the world was changing. The sun was rising, slow and pale over the horizon, casting the frost in a light that softened the edges of your nightmare. The pooling, sinking air, the breath of the mountain Cailleach had stopped. The cold was no longer a weapon.

You had survived.

And then, in the distance, you saw them. The figures above—the rescuers who had spotted you. They were coming, they were going to pull you from the hollow and bring you back to safety.

But you had already known the cold, hadn't you? You had felt its power, its weight. You were on the edge of something ancient, something vast, something that could not be contained by the sun or the wind. You had felt the Cailleach's reach, even if you couldn’t fully remember it.

You would never forget what you saw in the Grenlock.

But I will never forget what you were meant to do, either. I will never forget the stones, or the promise your people made.

You’ve walked through the cold. You’ve seen the frostbite and the terror, the hallucinations that twist your mind. And you’ve survived. But there is always more to remember, always more to understand about the cold.

This is only part of the story.

The next time you feel the chill, remember the stones. Remember the promise.

Remember the Cailleach.
