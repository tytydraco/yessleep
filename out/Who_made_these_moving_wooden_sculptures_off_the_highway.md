About a week ago, some friends and I were driving up to the mountains for a day trip. We do that once a month, usually, schedules permitting. We're all in college, so it's pretty rare to get a common day off. Now, I think one of my friends, who I'll call "Ryan" on here, probably skips class for this, but I'm not gonna rat on him or anything. He's a troublemaker--the sort to *TP* all the trees outside the front of the college, or fill the fountain in the central courtyard with a whole bottle of laundry detergent. He's a shithead. 

I'm the one to drive on these mountain trips, cause Ryan hasn't gotten his license yet--something about the questions on the learner exam being bullshit and intentionally confusing just so you fail it over and over again and have to keep coming back to pay another eighty clams to retry. I guess I agree, but I also know Ryan, until maybe a year ago, still bought shoes one size up to leave wiggle room for his toes. He's twenty one. 

Joining us on these trips is a girl I'll call "Chrissy:" a black haired, black clothed, black makeup goth who got me to stop on the side of the highway one time so she could check out the rotting, half eaten carcass of a buck. Cool, I guess. You could see its sun-shriveled, stinking intestines. Now I know where the stomach sits in the body of a deer. She told me then she wished it had rotted a little more, so she could pop its skull off and throw it in my trunk. 

Since we're here, I'll guess I'll introduce myself a little. I'm "Trent." Not really, but *Nine Inch Nails* is my favorite band, so we'll go with that. I don't know what to say, really--I'm a pretty average guy. An art major--art history, to be exact. So maybe that makes me un-average. All three of us are, so that's where we met--bonded over discussions on *Da Vinci* and *Goya*. 

So anyway, we head up to the mountains to get inspiration. There's a little town up there, too, with a few art galleries featuring obscure local painters and photographers obsessed with bears and elk and mountainscapes. 

The wooden sculptures were about halfway between that town and our home city limits. Real middle of nowhere, overgrown thicket sort of area, with thick-trunk trees like dark mangled columns, all shrouded in wet mist. 

Chrissy had needed to get out and use the bathroom shack cobbled together on the side of the road, so we'd stopped. Ryan wished her luck and she vanished into the shack, leaving us out on the gravel to take in the mountain air. Beyond the shack was a lake, rimmed in trees. We could hear the geese and ducks floating down there, bobbing for fish. 

And then I heard Ryan: "What's that?"

I spun in place, followed his finger with my eyes, 'til I saw something in the treeline across the road. Something wooden and erected out of the ground, but not natural. Not a tree or a sapling or anything. We checked for cars before jogging across the asphalt. 

After a moment to study it, I posited my theory. It looked like some kind of totem pole, but waist-height.  A baby. Immaculately carved into the wood were three faces, all human, all in the throes of different degrees of agony. Suffering. Muscles twisted and warped. 

Ryan said: "Doesn't look native."

And I agreed. We'd studied a bit about Indigenous art history, including their carving in stone, wood, bone, whatever. These faces were not animals, like you might find on a normal totem pole, nor did they have any kind of styling I'd seen from any tribes we'd looked into. 

"Maybe someone just put it here."

And I asked why they'd do that.

"I don't know. Maybe someone got hit by a car or something."

What?

"Like when they put crosses and shit--and stuffed animals. In the spot where someone got hit."

So I reminded him the faces on the totem were screaming. This would make a pretty shitty tribute. He didn't have any more theories, and Chrissy was just crossing the road to see what we were doing. 

She smacked me on the back. "Cool! What's this?"

"No idea. I was saying it might have been a tribute to someone who died. Trent didn't agree."

"Yeah, no that's stupid. This is some, like, metal shit. I would put this in my front yard." She got down to a squat and rubbed the faces with her thumb, feeling the carving grooves.

I said her parents probably wouldn't appreciate that. Then I took my eyes off the thing and looked past it into the woods. That's when I saw a path. I pointed it out and convinced them to check it out. Chrissy was worried about bears, but I had some spray on me. And Ryan would be making enough noise to scare them off for miles, anyway. No need to worry...

We walked for maybe five minutes. Then we found the clearing.

It was wide and circular--perfectly circular, as far as I could tell. And the grass and underbrush had been trimmed and stamped down flat, like what you see in a crop circle with all the corn stalks. The sculptures were supported on thick wooden boughs embedded into the dirt, filled in with concrete. There were three of them in total, each completely unique, all carved with inhuman precision and perfectly smooth. I guess I could see how a human might make them, but then I remember the details of what I saw, and I don't know.

Spinning bowties wound in and out of complex curves, which in turn revolved around a constellation of spheres. All of it looked to be synced--timed perfectly to make this intricate movement happen. The second was a teeter-totter, around which a corkscrewed disk spun, running up and down the length of the board. Teeth interlocking with teeth, grooves within grooves. Like the mechanism of a clock, made in pine. The last one was a moving triangle--some kind of tesseract that formed and broke constantly, I can't even begin to guess how that one worked.

Chrissy was fascinated, and drifted amongst the contraptions, always keeping a safe distance from their churning. I didn't know what Ryan was doing--I was far too intrigued by the tesseract. Something about it drew me in and held my attention. Like watching ice crystallize in double speed. It was quietly dangerous. Flailing wooden limbs looked heavy enough to crack a skull open, but it hardly made a squeak. Just the occasional rubbing of a peg or screw, or whatever it was holding this together. 

At some point I realized we'd been here for a while, none of us speaking a word. I looked down at my watch and saw an hour had passed. That didn't make any sense. I shouted to Chrissy, which seemed to break her out of a trance. 

"What?"

I told her again.

"Are you... what are you talking about? Is your watch broken?"

I checked--double checked with the time on my phone. One hour. 

"But... but we just got here. When did you check the time before--at the car?" She came over to me in a cloud of charcoal perfume. A scratch at her ghost-pale leg through her fishnets. "What the fuck..." That came after she checked her own phone. One hour. "Oh my God, Trent, what the fuck?"

Ryan hadn't come over. I looked up and found him standing by the teeter-totter, his one hand white-knuckling a big, knotted stick. He didn't acknowledge our presence until I shouted at him a second time, at which point he flinched and stepped back from the sculpture. We walked over and he turned to us. He was crying.

And he said: "It took her skin off."

It felt like a cold blanket settled over me. It felt like a chorus of eyes were watching me from out of the trees, and I found myself scanning the rim of the clearing almost unconsciously as I asked him what he was talking about. 

"My sister... Um... She was strapped into... *that.* That *thing.* And, uh..." He wiped his eyes and sniffled. "That spinning wheel was pulling her skin off, like... wringing it off her body. While it was... going up and down. But she's... she's not there."

Chrissy had her hand over her mouth. "What the fuck? Was it, like... were you picturing that? Or-"

"-No, I saw it. I fucking saw it. Right in front of me. She was screaming and flailing. For hours... just fucking hours. Until she stopped."

All I could think to do was ask why he was holding a stick. I don't think I'd ever seen him like that in the whole time I've known him. Not once. 

He looked surprised to see it in his own hand. "To get her out... maybe. But it's so strong."

I wanted to leave. Seeing those sculptures bouncing and twisting in my peripherals conjured up images of skeletal, wooden hands with sharp, grabbing fingers. Claws of some creature buried underground, poking up through the soil like the fangs of a huntsman spider. Luring. And the crazy thing: even with that in mind, I still felt drawn to them. There was a desire to touch them--to see if I could arrest their silky movements, then start them up again. See if I could make them go faster or slow them down. 

But the fear won. We walked down out of the trees and came once again to the screaming totem pole with three faces, no clearer as to its origin. Then to my car, where no sense of safety came until we were miles down the road. The rest of our trip that day was ruined.

I don't think I've had a good night's sleep once since that day. Every time I drift off, I have dreams where I'm back in that clearing, half the time watching them move in silence, the other half watching as they flay and mangle and rip the limbs off of people I know. My parents, my siblings, my friends. I see Ryan on that teeter-totter, the way he'd seen his little sister, having his pelt screwed up and torn off by the spinning corkscrew wheel. I see Chrissy sometimes, and those dreams are the worst. She's always caught in the tesseract, with her limbs tied each to a different corner, being kneaded like dough. Arms over legs, legs over arms, until flesh and bone break. 

So please...

please...

If anyone knows about these sculptures--who made them, why they made them, or why I keep seeing them in my dreams, please share. I don't know if I can take any more.
