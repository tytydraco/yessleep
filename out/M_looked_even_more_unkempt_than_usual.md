Deep, purple bags and his normally bloodshot, dark brown eyes had gone glassy, seeming to have aged. The beard he’d grown helped hide the pockmarks and acne scars, but the flakes of dandruff caught in it ruined any chance of dignity. His camouflage jacket hadn’t seen soap in months and smelled like burnt weed, stale cigarettes, and sweat.

Coming to his place was always a gamble, twitching neighbors lurking, needles glittering, distant gunfire echoing through the walls. And that was just the lobby. His apartment was a whole other ecosystem of decay and poor choices. But M always had good shit.

“I’m sorry, they were out,” he said, voice scratchy. “But I’ve got something. Unlike anything you’ve ever tried.” His grin spread wide and crooked. The idea that he didn’t have coke hit like a gut punch. I wasn’t leaving with cheap grass, and I’d sworn against ever using anything requiring a needle. That line was the only one still standing. “What is it?”

He fished around in his jacket, muttering, before pulling out a tiny jet-black pill. He held it out in his left hand, the one with bones inked over skin and the word FUCK tattooed faint but forever. On the couch, his girlfriend shifted, eyes half-open, mouth dry. “Is real,” she slurred.

Advice from someone with open meth sores wasn’t high on my list. “What is it?” I asked again.

M blinked slow, like the idea of explaining anything hurt. “Well… I don’t really know. Bought it from some motherfucker said it was amazing. And it cost a hell of a lot, so it better be.” His breath was rancid. “I tried it.” He motioned to the couch. “Kath tried it.” She stared at me, pupils huge, head dipping like a puppet with cut strings. “Is great,” she whispered.

I’d always been cautious, but M had never burned me before, not once. “What does it do?”

He flashed those chipped, missing teeth. “Hard to explain. You gotta see for yourself.”

I sighed, annoyed. “Physical effects? Side effects? Risks?”

He shook his head too fast. “No OD. I’ve been taking ’em for… uh…” His eyes searching the ceiling for the lost math. “A while. And look at me.” He swept his hand down his body like he was modeling for a magazine. “I’m doing great.”

He looked like a nightmare given flesh. He looked like M. “How much?”

“A grand.”

“You’re fucking joking.”

“It’s worth it,” he insisted, serious now. “Honestly? It’s a deal.”

M was strictly cash, and I’d only brought half that. “I’ve got five hundred.”

He ran his tongue over those cracked lips, thinking so hard you could almost hear the wheel turning inside his skull. “You’re a good dude,” he finally said. “And a good customer. I’ll let it go for five. And if you don’t like it?” He tapped the pill with a grimy fingernail. “Money back. Swear to God.”

Being called a good customer by my dealer didn’t exactly fill me with pride. Still, a half-off mystery drug with a refund policy? Hard to turn down. M never fed me bullshit, if anything, he was brutally honest. So I handed over the five crisp hundreds, still warm from the ATM. He slid them into his pocket like they were already gone. “You won’t be disappointed,” he said, and for a moment, he almost sounded sincere.

The pill in my hand looked… ordinary. Tiny, smooth, jet-black. I’d sampled more than my share of substances, and this was just another pill. “When do I take it?”

That shook him awake. His eyes sharpened, pupils pinning. “At home,” he said. “Wait till you get home.”

Driving back across town, guilt rode shotgun. Ten years of weekend binges and after-work joints, enough to know better, not enough to stop. I wasn’t some burnout. I had a career. People who cared about me. A future that wasn’t entirely bleak. That pill sat in my pocket like a loaded gun, but the excitement buzzing through me made every rational thought feel like a lie. Maybe the mystery was the hook.

Back in my apartment, I set up like I was prepping for surgery, glass of water, bowl of Doritos, couch angled just right so I wouldn’t choke if I passed out. I turned on the TV, gave myself exactly one second to second-guess… then tossed the pill down my throat.

It hit fast. My brain throbbed, not painfully, more like someone had plugged it directly into a generator. A wave of euphoria flooded out through my limbs, warm and relentless, the kind of high that felt like it might lift you out of yourself. It was big. Almost too big. But it was good. Good enough. Darkness closed around me like a blanket.

When I opened my eyes again, sunlight was cutting through the blinds. I’d slept hard, but woke sharp. No cotton mouth, no headache, no dread. Just… lightness. My heart steady. My mind clear. The pulse from last night still hummed in my skull, a reminder. I stood, stretched. I felt good.

But as that black-pill afterglow settled into the back of my skull, a thought pushed through: was a thirty-second miracle really worth five hundred dollars? I decided it was not.

I checked my phone. 12:24 PM. Missed notifications. One stood out:

M: How was it

I stared at the screen for a minute, thinking how to phrase it without sounding like an idiot:

Me: Good, but I fell asleep almost instantly. Is that supposed to happen?

I went through the rest, friends checking in, a reminder from my mom asking when I’d visit, emails from work and spam alike, two Hinge messages, and Tinder begging me to come back and swipe away my loneliness. I answered a few things, and then swiped down to check any new notifications.

M: Oh thats weird. Damn. U want ur money back

I blinked. A fast response from M was already a miracle. A refund offer from a drug dealer? Biblical. I said yes. He said I could grab it next time I came by for coke or weed.

I made a decent breakfast, showered, and decided to hit the gym, my first weekend visit in a while. I ran. I lifted. I actually felt… good. My heart wasn’t clawing at my chest, my lungs weren’t filled with regret. The effort felt earned instead of punished. I was cooling down when she walked in.

Tight athletic wear stretched over curves that didn’t apologize, long legs that carried confidence in every step. Then the details hit: freckles like sun-kissed stars across her cheeks, deep green eyes, and hair the color of copper catching fire. She looked like the kind of woman who only existed in commercials for experiences I couldn’t afford. My gaze lingered half a second too long, because her eyes found mine. Reflex kicked in, I smiled. Something small. Easy.

She smiled back. Warm. Real. And I turned away before I could ruin it.

Women like her didn’t notice guys like me. But that moment? It happened. And I wasn’t desperate to chase it. For once, feeling good was enough.

I drove home with the windows down, music loud, the city rushing by like it was finally rooting for me. I showered, scrubbed off the sweat, then dug my blender out from under a layer of dust. A protein shake and a solid couch rot sounded like the perfect reward.

I opened Tinder. A couple new likes, always flattering, rarely promising. First profile:

Jazz

25

Esthetician

Less than 5 miles away

Almond skin and a body-hugging white dress that made “flowing” feel like a sin. Curves that looked soft to touch, collarbones like invitation lines, thighs toned and dangerous. Her profile showed she wasn’t trying hard; she didn’t have to.

I swiped right.

It’s a match.

I literally blinked. Twice. Then dove through her profile. Every picture was a different kind of perfect, with effortless angles, confidence, and a smile that suggested she already knew the answer to any question worth asking. Definitely a 9. Maybe a 10. Women like that typically existed online only to lure lonely men into subscribing. I tried to think of something clever. Smart. Funny. Anything.

Me: Hey

Pathetic. I tossed my phone aside, pretending I wasn’t waiting, eyes glued to the TV but brain glued to the hope of a message. Ten minutes felt a lifetime.

Notification: Jazz sent you a new message.

Jazz: Hi :)

Two hours later, we were sitting at a bar across from each other, like this had always been the plan. Her voice curled warmly around every question. I kept her talking; curiosity makes anyone interesting. She ordered a whiskey sour. I hesitated. Normally, I needed liquid courage, rum and coke, gin and tonic, whatever dulled the edge. But I didn’t feel that edge. I ordered a club soda.

Her eyebrow arched, light suspicion. “You don’t drink?”

“I do,” I said with a shrug. “I just don’t need it tonight.”

She leaned in slightly. “How come?”

The answer slipped out before I could weigh it: “I’d rather be drunk on you.”

Stupid line. Somehow worked anyway. She blushed, eyes dropping, then rising again with a spark.

Two hours after that, she was moaning my name into the darkness of my room, nails digging crescents into my back. No numb haze, no chemical delays, every nerve was awake, tuned to her. I felt her breathing change, felt the shiver of her thighs, felt everything.

That same warm pulse from the pill thrummed somewhere beneath the skin of my skull.

Was this what it did?

Did it make the world sharper?

Did it make life… better?

If so, five hundred suddenly seemed like a steal.

I fell into a rhythm: work, gym, life. Not watching the clock crawl toward four, not counting the hours until that first joint. Work was still work, but it stopped feeling like a slow drowning. I focused. I cared. And people noticed. My boss pulled me aside one afternoon and said he was impressed. A week later, I got a two-dollar raise, my first in five years.

The fat burned off. Muscle followed, defined, visible, finally matching the version of myself I’d always squinted to see. I kept seeing the redhead at the gym. Our schedules crossed on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. After a month of exchanging shy, knowing smiles, I finally introduced myself. She was Rachel. Pre-med. Of course, she was. But I didn’t rush anything. I didn’t need to. Suddenly, I had options.

Jazz, with her impossible curves and easy, hungry grin. not the serious type, just the fun one.

Mikayla, soft-spoken and curvy, a first-grade teacher with laughter that made everything feel warm, definitely the serious type. And a couple of others floating pleasantly in orbit.

Even M texted. More than once.

M: Need coke or somethin man

M: Got weed, too.

I told him no. I told him I didn’t need anything. Not anymore. I even told him to keep the refund he owed me. He offered to hang out instead, and I turned him down gently. Not because I was judging him… but because the smell of his apartment still clung to my memory like mold.

I was busy. Actually, genuinely busy.

Mom’s health got better. My sleep got better. Everything got better.

The memory of that little black pill didn’t vanish, exactly, just sank slowly into the background, like a dream you almost forget until some detail later jogs it loose.

Life was good. Months passed.

I was midway through a set of calf raises, killing time between reps, when I noticed Rachel raising the bar for squats. Of course, it was hard not to when she was wearing pale green booty shorts that clung perfectly and a matching top that made her eyes pop in the mirror. She braced, dipped low… and her legs suddenly wobbled.

The bar tipped.

Before I could think, I was behind her, hands catching the bar and guiding it back onto the rack. She stumbled, then straightened, cheeks flushed, not from the workout.

“Oh my god,” she breathed, pressing a hand to my chest. “Thank you. Seriously.”

Her smile was warm enough to melt steel, and the spark in her eyes hit me like a hit of adrenaline.

“Anytime,” I said. “Just glad you’re okay.”

That night, we were sitting across from each other at a little Italian place. Later, soft, manicured fingers traced idle circles on my bicep as the lights dimmed in the theater. By the time the credits rolled, her head was tucked onto my shoulder, and everything felt easy.

In the parking lot, kissing her felt like being seventeen again, electric, messy, impatient. It would’ve been too easy to take it further right there. “I think we should stop,” I managed, breath ragged. “I really like you… and I don’t want to screw that up.”

The way she looked at me made resisting feel like victory instead of denial.

We lasted exactly one day.

After dinner the next night, we walked down by the harbor, the water reflecting city lights. We talked for hours, family, pasts, futures, stupid fears, secret hopes. Every sentence felt like another thread stitching us together. Somewhere in the middle of her talking about med school rotations, I realized with absolute clarity: I loved her.

Back at my place, clothes hit the floor, and she rode me like she needed me to exist. Every nerve in my body fired. By the end, she was breathless, legs trembling; I was flat on my back, shaking, pulse racing like I’d just outrun death itself.

She curled into me, lips brushing my ear.

“I want that forever,” she whispered.

The next morning, we called it official.

Jazz took it well enough, Mikayla didn’t. She asked if she’d ever meant anything, then blocked me before I could answer. I’d done the right thing; honesty counted for something. And I had the girl of my dreams.

Rachel and I moved in together after two months, reckless, impulsive, completely perfect. She left her roommates scrambling to fill her room, but it was fate. My apartment was closer to the hospital anyway, and she was about to start her post-grad rotations. It just made sense.

It’s wild how fast a place stops being yours when a girlfriend moves in. Extra pillows that served no functional purpose. Pastel throw blankets. Art prints with quotes about gratitude and growth. A skincare routine invading the bathroom cabinet. And the duvet covers, layers of them. But I loved every invasion. Rachel filled the empty spaces in my home and the hollow spaces in my heart. I became the guy I used to clown my friends for being, missing boys’ nights, and smiling at my phone like a moron. And I was happy. Truly, happy.

I switched companies a few months later for a better salary, better hours, and a better future. The gym took a backseat. Belly softening. Muscles fading. Rachel’s too, she traded heavy squats for long nights with textbooks and hospital corridors. We joked that our love was caloric. We didn’t care. We had futures to build and a life to enjoy. Rachel was still buried in clinicals and coursework, but she always made time to laugh with me, to touch me, to hold my hand, as if she was afraid of letting go. And I held her the same.

Our one year rolled around on a beach, three days of pretending the world only consisted of salty air, turquoise water, and each other. I spared no expense. She knew what was coming. Everyone would’ve known, my thumb nervously brushing the box in my pocket, the way I couldn’t stop staring at her under that orange-pink sunset. I got on one knee, the ocean roaring approval behind me.

She gasped, like she didn’t see it coming, and then she was crying, mascara streaking as she laughed and nodded, nodding before I even finished the question. Tears of pure joy. Her arms wrapped around me, the ring catching the last light of day. It was the happiest moment of my life.

We truly made love that night, our night. I’d always thought “making love” was just a polite way to say “sex.” But as we moved together, our eyes locked, our breaths mixing, I finally understood. It wasn’t about the act. It was as if the world were disappearing everywhere except where our bodies met.

After, we lay tangled in each other, whispering our future. Wedding details. Honeymoon fantasies. Two kids, maybe three, names that made her smile into my neck. Every detail a promise the universe had already signed off on. I drifted to sleep with her soft breaths warming my shoulder, thinking I’d never been happier.

Something in my skull flickered. A pulse. A short electric snap. Not pain…just wrong.

I reached for her. Empty. My fingers brushed something sharp, plastic. A bowl clattered to the floor, Doritos scattering.

I wasn’t in bed. My body was slumped sideways on a lumpy couch. My eyes opened, slow and gritty. White walls. Dim TV glow. The stale smell of cheap liquor and loneliness. My apartment. My old apartment.

I stayed still. Completely still. When the truth finally dug in, I lurched upright, heart clawing its way out of my chest. I grabbed my phone, hands shaking, scrolling through the gallery that should have been overflowing: beach sunsets, squats at the gym, pictures of her asleep on my chest, us. Nothing. No Rachel. No engagement. No year of love.

Just a reflection of a man no one was waiting for.

My stomach twisted into a brutal knot. I stumbled into the bathroom and retched violently, gagging on air, tears mixing with spit as I crumpled to the floor. The grief was animal, howling out of me in broken, ugly bursts. I heaved until nothing came out but sobs.

When I could breathe again without choking on heartbreak, I crawled back to the couch, curling into myself like something small trying not to be crushed. Time passed wrong. Minutes or hours. Eventually, I checked my phone again, eyes blurry. 12:24 PM.

M: How was it

My fingers moved before the grief could finish destroying me:

Me: I need another one.
