My house is close to a slum. Its not a bad neighborhood, just that this area used to be a cheap place to rent and the wrong crowd stayed too long in that building. Several families of dubious intent lived there and made everyone around feel unconfortable about it. It wasnt a matter of us looking  down these families but rather it was a thing of them not being "friendly" (also the stench of rotten shit was pouring out of every corner from the place) . We all knew they were behind the occasional theft around the block, muggings, drug dealing and other things. I experienced a mugging of sorts when a person approached me menacingly and asked me for money. There was no knife or gun, but the guy got too close too me and his friends surounded me and asked me for a spare nickel. I gave them ten bucks and they left me be.

When a new landlord bought the place they were living, things were uncertain of what would happen. Word on the street was that the new landlord was very strict with rent and THEY started getting angry. A lot came through our mind,  maybe they would change for good, maybe they wont.

Then, the first death occured to one of the worst family. Notorious guy who beat his wife and stole a couple tires around the block. The woman, addiccted to crack, and gossiper. Their child was the most obnoxious kid I have ever heard. All of them died on a fire. Sad as any death is, we all were happy they would not bother us no more but it was only the beggining of something nasty. Details were grim. The fire  department chief stated that everything about the tragedy wouldnt match properly, some parts were typical of a voluntary fire but some other wouldnt make sense. According to his report, the sinister was indeed caused by someone, but the family wasn't eager to stay, their routes of escape were blocked. The main door by fire and the windows, boarded from the outside. They were found in the main room, died suffocated but the broken glass, clawing on the boards and the broken knuckles of the guy were unusual. In the end, police ruled out the process as an insurance fraud and filed the case.

Another family (Grandmother, grandson, wife and brother in law) "died" under mysterious circumstances, dissapearing one after another. The first one, was her in law. The wife went to the police to ask for an investigation on the grandma as the main suspect. Officers checked the house, asked questions but nothing was found. The wife was next, then the grandson. When the third person went missing, the police visited the grandma, the sole survivor of the family (and main suspect).

-I didnt do anything. It took them-

-Ma'am, you need to be more specific. We need to understand what happened- an officer asked with contempt.

-The thing, the thing in the sewer crawled in the night and took the girl's brother . Then, it grabed my son and his wife- the old lady whined. This family wasnt the worst, but the two guys had a beef and were constantly fighting. Sometimes the son would win, sometimes the brother in law. And when the in law would win, he had to leave the house for a couple of weeks. The old lady was dangerously crazy, She had  no remorse in using a knife and stab either the wife or the in law. Both of them went to the hospital a couple times because of stabbing wounds and nothing would stop granny's madness until time would let her chill down a little. For this, police had a hard time beleiving what she said.

-Ma'am, we need to check the place, its the law- there were already some reports about her, she got sued by the wife, but things would get deescalated because the brothers needed a place to live and the strange marriage was so dependant that they had to stick together

Nothing was found and the old lady was left to be, but a police car was left close in case something suspicious would happen. And then, it occured, the lady vanished. What brought everyone  to know this was the stench of rotten food. When the police entered the house, you could tell nobody left in a rush, nor there was evidence of struggle. No letter or note of suicide was found so the old lady was simply filed as "Missing".

Intoxication, food poisoning, property treaspasing and assasination, among others, were the following happenings that caused the families to die. A lot started to change, less crimes, less menacing people and the smeel turned into something, fishy. Things were so gruesome, that we stopped feeling relief of these people leaving and started feeling pity of whatever was going on. The worst was certainly the family that died of malaria. Doctors asked if they traveled recently but things dropped quickly when they realized this family was dirt poor.

It was very sad because they had 2 childs who suffered a lot because of the disease. Headaches and vomiting led the kids from crying their lungs out to simply lay down, hoping for death as a better option.

I started poking around to find out what happened and thats when I met a cop who did the same. 

-I beleive nothing makes sense here-

-Everyone thinks that, but most people prefer to look away and pretend everything is fine, because of the landlord promise- he said

-What promise?-

-That he will rebuild the place and turn it to better, probably a small convenience store or something-

-I dont like it, just because we hated these people doesnt mean they deserve to be treated this way-

-Well, nobody cares-

-But what if this is only the begginig? What if the landlord decides every home around wont fit his plans?-

The cop stared at me and concluded-You got me there kid. What's your plan?-

-I cant get in, but you can, right? So try and look things that may seem out of place so we can start figuring out what happened-

-You sound like there is a conspiracy of sorts-

-Well, how could the family get malaria if they havent traveled to a tropical area and we are experiencing cold weather?-

-Ok, you got me again kiddo-

-I will keep an eye through the day if someone suspicious comes around and you will inside the property by night, so nobody bothers you-

-Agreed-

I set a cheap camera from my window to the entrace and kept an eye while working. A motion sensor would send me movement alerts.

Half of these notifications were dull. Kids playing, ladies walking around, a guy snooping inside the property (probably trying to steal something) and a couple false alarms.

During the night, I thought the cop would go in and do a quick research, but things went off. After seing an initial notification of him getting inside the building, five minutes passed, and then, he returned and waved me for something in the camera.

-What happened?-

-Come, you need to see this- he whispered

A weird goo of sort was close to a gutter in the middle of the building and a familiar smell of rotten sea food flooded my nose.

-So....is that it?-

-No-he said, visibly shaken- This wasnt here when I got inside.

-So, maybe the sewer spat something?-

We heard some steps from one of the apartments. we took cover trying to figure out what could make that noise.

The landlord waltzed from one of the abandoned places with a smiling face, it looked almost as he was happy  seeing all this pain and death. He walked to the sewer and stoped. Suddenly, he started moving  like one of those air adds from the car retail store, except, his arms werent waving around, nor his hair was all spiked. A weird noise echoed the empty yard, like when the sink clogs and starts to absorb water with difficulty. Then things went for the worst, the landlord's foot strarted to get absorbed (or something ) by the sewer. It seemed like he had no bones and as if he was made of jello. Slowly and surely the whole man started fitting in the hole with a bizzarre manner, as some sort of cartoon character. 

The whole ordeal make the cop and I open wide our eyes in disbelief and fear and when the head reached the hole, his face started to distort in a creepy way, twisting the mouth into an impossible lenght, as if part of his lips were kissing the gutter, and then, the sewer drained the whole head popping the left eye. The ocular organ popped out and for a couple seconds, it was the only thing out of the hole, it started circling around, like trying to locate something until for a moment, it stared in our direction, as if he noticed our presence. Then a pop sound came out and the eye dissapeard leaving a couple of drops of the weird goo. We stayed frozen for almos a minute, and that was good, because as the eye dissapeared, showering a small quantity of drops of goo into the floor. An object flew out of it, I wasnt sure of what was it, but it looked like a syringe. The item touched the floor for something that seemed like an eternity but in reality it may have passed 5 seconds. Then, a noodle-tentacle of sorts emerged the gutter to grab the thing that was on the floor and took it away. 

When the cop and I regained senses we looked at each other and started blabing.

-D...d...did you see that? Was that a syringe?- i muttered

-I....I dunno, I....we... WE NEED TO GO!!!-

And as soon as he finished the sentence, he jumped into his feet and ran away.

After that I wasnt able to reach the guy but an idea came to my mind. What happened there was that every tragedy in the slum was caused by the landlord. He would appear in the middle of the night and set the traps for each one of the tenats, cause different tragedies that would distract the attention from the sewer so he could escape and get rid of people with no retailation. Fearing he may really see me that night, I decided to leave my house and go into a different neighbourhood. Far north, where squids and things like that cant live. Hoping, I will never see again something like the landlord
