I don't go into much more detail about when and why I ended up there; let's skip it for now.

**So.**

The rain poured down relentlessly, drenching the city in a veil of darkness. I stood before the unremarkable façade of an old, abandoned hospital, with boarded-up windows and walls worn by time. This place was called "The Surgeon's OR," a notorious spot where those in dire need sought refuge, unaware of the sinister secrets that lay within. Tonight, I was not a hero or a villain, just an ordinary man named Jack, who had stumbled upon this eerie sanctuary in search of shelter from the relentless storm.

I have a very keen sixth sense, and I knew that something was wrong with that hospital! But I didn't have any other option, so I decided to enter.

Pushing open the creaking door, I was greeted by an unsettling silence that enveloped me like a suffocating fog. The dimly lit interior added to the sense of unease, and the flickering lights cast macabre shadows on the peeling walls. The air carried a distinct smell of dampness and decay, mixed with an overwhelming scent of antiseptic that made my stomach churn.

The waiting room was a haunting sight - dilapidated furniture and medical equipment scattered around as if frozen in time. The reception desk was adorned with a flickering neon sign that read "Surgery" in crimson letters, creating an eerie ambiance. Despite not being a talkative person, I felt an unusual urge to speak to the figure huddled in the corner.

A man, wrapped in tattered clothing and trembling from the cold, was seated across from me. His face was obscured by unkempt hair and a hooded jacket. I could barely make out his features, but I sensed fear and desperation emanating from him.

His mysterious aura intrigued me, and I found myself wanting to talk to him.

"Hello?" I called out, my voice echoing through the desolate room.

The man looked up, revealing weary eyes that seemed to carry a lifetime of sorrow. "Who are you?" he asked, his voice quivering.

"Just seeking shelter from the rain," I replied. "What about you?"

He hesitated for a moment before responding, "I... I needed help. I have nowhere else to go."

Curiosity mingled with concern as I asked, "Help with what?"

He glanced around cautiously, as if afraid of being overheard. "I have an illness, a curse, that no regular doctor can cure. I've heard rumors about a mysterious healer who can fix any ailment in this place."

The words "help," "illness," and "cure" are expected in hospitals, but "curse" raised my eyebrows. I figured he might be using the term metaphorically, attributing his suffering to a curse.

I nodded, understanding the desperation that might drive a person to seek out such extraordinary remedies. "Well, I hope you find the help you need," I said, offering a faint smile.

Just then, the door to the operating room swung open, revealing a figure clad in a long, dark coat and wearing a hood that concealed his face. The Surgeon had arrived.

At that point, I sensed something dangerous and creepy from him immediately!

"Welcome," the Surgeon's voice echoed chillingly through the room. "Who shall be my patient tonight?"

The man beside me stood up hesitantly, drawn by the prospect of finding a cure for his affliction. I watched as he followed the Surgeon into the operating room, the door closing behind them, leaving me alone in the foreboding waiting area.

Time seemed to slow down as fear took hold of me. I felt consumed by the unknown.

Minutes felt like hours as I waited, the silence broken only by the occasional distant rumble of thunder. An unsettling feeling crept up my spine, and I couldn't shake the sense that something was profoundly wrong in this place. My instincts urged me to leave, but an inexplicable curiosity held me captive.

Finally, unable to bear the suspense any longer, I approached the closed door of the operating room and pressed my ear against it, trying to discern any sounds from within (Yeah, I know it was stupid, but it worked!). What I heard was the chilling echo of whispered words, murmurs that sent shivers down my spine.

"I give you relief from pain, but there must be a price."

I couldn't make out the other person's response, but the Surgeon's voice grew even more sinister.

"Are you willing to sacrifice your memories, your past, for a new beginning?"

"Sacrificing memories!" These words raised my eyebrows again! It was kind of funny, and I couldn't help but imagine the Surgeon in a black suit, wiping out patients' memories with a device like we see in Men in Black movies.

But that funny imagination vanished instantly when I heard the man's voice!

The desperation in his voice was evident as he pleaded, "Please, I'll do anything to be free of this curse."

With a sudden, gut-wrenching realization, I understood that this mysterious healer demanded a horrifying trade-off for his services. He took something precious from his patients in exchange for healing. What dark secrets lay hidden in their stolen memories?

Fear and concern gripped me, but before I could act, the door swung open, and the man emerged from the operating room. His gait was unsteady, his eyes vacant, as if something vital had been stripped away from him.

"What happened in there?" I asked, my voice quivering. (I'm stupid!)

He glanced at me with a haunted expression but said nothing, shuffling past me and disappearing into the night.

Torn between leaving and confronting the enigmatic Surgeon, I took a deep breath and stepped into the operating room. The Surgeon stood there, his dark coat billowing ominously.

"Ah, another seeker," he said, his voice sending chills down my spine.

"What do you do to them?" I demanded, trying to mask my fear.

"I offer them healing beyond comprehension, but nothing comes without a price," he replied cryptically.

"I won't let you hurt anyone else," I said, mustering as much courage as I could.

A sinister smile curled upon the Surgeon's lips. "You misunderstand. I do not hurt them. They come to me willingly, desperate for relief from their suffering. All I do is provide them with what they seek."

The Surgeon's words baffled me. Could it be that people willingly gave up their memories and pasts to escape their pain? It was a horrifying notion, but one that seemed all too real in this unholy sanctuary.

"You have no right to play God like this," I said, my anger overshadowing my fear.

The Surgeon shrugged indifferently. "I do not force anyone to come to me. They choose to seek me out, and they choose to make the trade. The burden of their choices lies with them."

His cold logic sent a chill down my spine. He had rationalized his malevolence to such an extent that he believed he was a savior. But deep down, I knew he was anything but.

Our conversation was cut short as the walls of the corridor seemed to come alive, closing in on us with supernatural force. Trapped, I glanced at the Surgeon, who merely stood there, unperturbed. He had orchestrated this encounter

, and I was nothing more than a pawn in his sinister game.

As the walls drew nearer, I closed my eyes, accepting my fate. But at that moment, a memory flashed before me – a cherished moment with my family, a reminder of the love and happiness that defined my life. With newfound determination, I fought against the suffocating walls, using the strength of my memories as a shield.

The Surgeon watched with cold detachment, his sinister smile widening as if enjoying the torment he inflicted. But I refused to yield. With a final surge of strength, I broke free from the crushing walls, leaving the Surgeon behind in his unholy sanctuary.

As I stumbled out into the rain-soaked city, I knew I had survived something unspeakably horrifying. The Surgeon's OR remained a place of darkness and malevolence, and I vowed to warn others of its existence.

In the days that followed, I sought help from the authorities, but it was as if the Surgeon's sanctuary had vanished without a trace, leaving no evidence of its existence. It was as though the malevolent healer and his horrifying operation had returned to the shadows from whence they came.

But I knew the truth, and I couldn't let the city forget the dangers that lurked within its abandoned walls. The Surgeon may have disappeared, but the haunting memories of that night would forever linger in my mind, a constant reminder of the unholy sanctuary that preyed on the desperation of the lost and the suffering.

The incident changed me, leaving me haunted and vigilant, ever watchful for any signs of the Surgeon's return. I couldn't erase the chilling images from my mind, the stolen memories stored in jars, and the suffering of those who had willingly traded their pasts for fleeting relief.

In the dark corners of the city, I whispered warnings of the Surgeon's OR, hoping to spare others from the dreadful fate that awaited those who sought his sinister remedies. But as the rain continued to fall, I couldn't shake the feeling that the Surgeon's malevolence was not so easily vanquished.

To this day, I remain haunted by that night, and the eerie sanctuary known as the Surgeon's OR continues to haunt the depths of my nightmares. I share this chilling tale as a warning, a cautionary tale to all who dare to seek desperate remedies in the shadows, for some secrets are better left undiscovered, and some darkness is too sinister to comprehend. Beware the Surgeon's OR, and pray that you never find yourself entangled in its malevolent grasp.
