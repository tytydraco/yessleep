To help you better understand why I am where, I’ll provide some context on how I ended up trapped inside of these bizarre walls. And then maybe you could help me...

I’m a young architecture student living near an upper class neighborhood in my town. I’ve always wanted to explore it and learn more, by observing, how luxury homes are built, as this is the career path I want to pursue. However, I never had the courage to start my adventure. I’m a middle-class boy, and I would clearly stand out like a sore thumb in a place where I don’t belong. I’ve always been excluded, and I didn’t need another place to feel inferior.

But now, at the beginning of the semester, our professor assigned us an urbanism project. We’d have to analyze houses, report their characteristics, interview residents, analyze this informations and align them with the neighborhood’s location and how it interacts with its surroundings. For me, this was a sign. So, I decided to muster up my courage and, overcoming the sense of inferiority that has always weighed on me, I went to explore the beautiful streets I’ve always been curious about. Now, I know this was a mistake.

The neighborhood is very noble and antique, similar to the beautiful suburbs filled with millionaires per square meter, isolated in their mini pieces of heaven outside the city. The level of security, even though it’s in a central region, seems quite high, as most of the houses I passed had low walls or none at all. They were imposing and grand yet welcoming and cozy, with charming adornments and references to old styles, bringing a bold and interesting vibe to the neighborhood. The streets are framed by wide sidewalks made of well-cut cobblestones and flowerbeds where trees, certainly older than me, stood.

Walking under the shade of the trees, I came across a huge, dense wall. It was very strange because, in those 30 minutes of walking, I had gotten used to the open view that allowed me to even see inside some of the residences.

The wall was covered in numerous types of climbing plants that clung to the stones that formed it, almost invisible due to how dense the layer of plants was. Although apparently healthy, it hadn’t been cared for in years. The vines grew freely but organized themselves in a pattern, as if a perfect ecosystem had been created on the stone blocks by itself. But contrary to what you might be thinking — like a messy, chaotic tangle  — the vines and moss grew in an orderly pattern, as if they knew how to look beautiful. It was so attractive that as I walked along the sidewalk following the wall, I ran my hand through the foliage, following the beautiful curved patterns that formed. I was in love with the beauty of those plants.

I continued walking for a few more meters. It was incredibly relaxing. The weather was cool, the air moist and light, filling my lungs with the distinct freshness of natural plants. My hand, already damp from the moss, continued its journey along the elliptical patterns, and on my shoulders, I felt the dew from the large trees dripping.

Even now, I think it was strange how much water was in there. I don’t remember the last time it rained here, and the leaves of the trees sparkled with drops as delicate as small diamonds. The walls were also quite damp, but that was justifiable due to the large presence of lichens and moss. I think. I was so distracted by the patterns of the vines that I didn’t even notice when I reached a protrusion in the wall of leaves. Surprised, I looked around, trying to orient myself.

I had walked almost an entire block. Indeed, it’s no wonder why the house is walled. Even in this neighborhood, the other houses looked small compared to it. As I gathered my thoughts, I noticed a woman in my peripheral vision while trying to figure out where I was. She appeared to be around 50 years old, or maybe a bit younger.

The woman seemed to sense that I didn’t belong there, just as I had feared, almost as if she could smell my middle-class scent. So, on impulse, I approached her and asked very politely:

“Hello, ma’am, I’m an architecture student conducting field research in this neighborhood, analyzing the houses, basically” I tried to smile, and surprisingly, she smiled back, but crossed her arms. Then I continued:

— So haha I noticed that these high walls really stand out around here. Do you know who owns this place, where the entrance is, so I can ask a few questions?

As I turned to point out which walls I was talking about, even though it was clearly obvious since they ran along the entire street, I was shocked to realize that it was already dusk. I had arrived in the neighborhood at exactly 11 a.m. to start my work. I had walked a lot, but it still didn’t make sense to me that more than 5 hours had passed. I had explored two streets before coming across the wall and following it.

As I pointed to the large mass of foliage, I noticed from the distance that the wall was much more peculiar than I had imagined. It was almost totally covered in vines, which now, from farther away, across the street, definitely formed a complex pattern, unnatural.

Moreover, near the protrusion where I almost hit my face, there was a narrow, very tall door, at least 11 foot tall. It was a distinct color, quite unusual for modern houses, but it matched the wall perfectly. A blue that resembled bronze when it starts to oxidize. The door was incredibly decorated and seemed to have been handmade, as its detailing and carvings were very delicate and small, covering every inch of its surface.

On the side of the door, several monoliths of the same color, although with different heights, stretched out of the wall, forming an upward curve to the top of the wall, which was about 13 feet above the door.

One thing that caught my attention was that none of them were covered by the vines, leaving them perfectly visible and somehow following the same pattern as the plants. “Were they installed later?” I wondered. Now I’m starting to think there’s something strange behind this.

I continued following with my eyes and came across huge metal plates that seemed to weigh tons. I don’t know how an old stone wall full of vines could still support so many plates, especially at the top. They were squares of about 5 feet, as detailed as the door, but certainly made of a different material, with a rougher texture and a matte finish. They were all colored: burnt pink, absinthe green, deep blue, bloody red, and pale purple.

Looking carefully, I could see that, unlike the gate, where some parts were missing and it was clearly poorly maintained, the plates seemed perfect. Even though I felt they were older than my grandma. They were all carved with grooves and recesses that formed images of countless types of fungi, algae, and plants that I had no idea what they were, aside from some insects, which stood out for being golden. All these elements together formed different symbols, totaling seven. Four in the center of each plate and three at the intersections between them.

I was snapped out of the hypnosis I was in by a drop of dew on my forehead. After this dazzling vision, I looked again at the little bit of sky visible between the trees and realized it was already getting dark. Until now, I have the feeling that time doesn’t make sense anymore.

This definitely snapped me out of the trance that those plates had put me in, and I looked around again. The woman, the neighbor of the wall, was no longer there. I guess she got tired of me standing there like an idiot and left.

So, I made the stupid decision to go to the gate. When I got close, I felt extremely uncomfortable. Now, up close, the details of the gate were even more noticeable. It probably took years to design every centimeter. And now it was in decay, with moss accumulating in the deeper details and a kind of slime covering the wear, as if trying to hide it. It was as if nature wanted to preserve the perfection of something as beautiful as that gate.

I covered my hand with my coat and went to knock, but at that exact moment, I was blinded. My eyes burned, and I was disoriented in the midst of a bright light. I staggered back three steps and saw a damn spotlight, almost like a sun, turn on right above me, a vibrant, almost toxic yellow. As my eyes burned, I squished them trying to see and noticed a small door opening at the top of the gate. It was a boy, apparently. I couldn’t see the face in detail because the light was blinding anything near it.

I decided to continue my endeavor, ignoring the sensation running through my body. The curiosity of knowing who owned the house and where those incredible pieces came from blinded me completely. If regret could kill, I'd already be six feet under, buried.

Like a moth to a flame, I needed to know more. So, I said, “Hi, you live here, right? I’m an architecture student, and I think the architecture of the house is amazing. Can I...” Before I could finish, the person had disappeared, and I only heard a decompression sound, like when you open a jar of pickles and all the compressed air is released, along with a sound of rusty metal scraping against itself, sending shivers down my spine. A strong, earthy smell of dust, mites, and mold invaded my nose.

I felt some of the mold falling on my face. I blew it off quickly while opening my eyes again. As my eyes focused, I saw a boy, apparently around his 16. I’m quite thin, but I could certainly carry that boy in my arms. He was fucking skinny. With a hesitant look, he stared at me and almost whispered, “You can come in. It’s been a while since I’ve seen anyone... I mean, no one comes here.”

Then, in a bizarre attempt to soften the terrible mood before stepping through the gate, I said, “Ah, but you’ll definitely make more friends, and they’ll come visit you. I used to be introverted too.” At that moment, he looked at me out of the corner of his eye, over his shoulder, which had some level of lordosis. His amber-yellow eyes stared at me intensely, and he said, dryly and firmly, “Now you’re my friend.” Almost automatically, I said a trembling “yes” and walked through the gate. Another stupid decision for the list.

“Come, I’ll show you the house. I’m sure an architect will appreciate the house like we do, unlike others,” he murmured.

The gate closed, and I felt the air compressing again, as if it wanted to suffocate me. I felt something dense around me and the sensation of rarefied air, as if the oxygen was being sucked out of me before it even reached my lungs. The air was stale, and the smell I had noticed at the entrance became much worse as I entered. The feeling that I was dirty made me shiver under my coat, as if the mass of gas mixed with dusty mold was clinging to me.

I found myself in a very small hall, but it maintained the height of the door, which made the room even more claustrophobic. Tiles the size of my palm covered the entire floor, with the same designs as the plates. There were hundreds of them, all certainly handmade, their delicate painting and golden details were standing out even in the dust and dim light. The light fixtures reminded me of the Art Nouveau style, around the 1890s, the end of the period. Many houses were still built in this style until the 1900s, as it demonstrated great wealth since many pieces required highly specialized human labor. However, the beautiful crystal flowers proved to be weak. And with the lack of any windows, I felt like I was sinking in a lake of murky water.

Lost and making notes and sketches of the small hall, which was with only me, light fixtures, tiles, and a small table, I felt a cold hand on my back... My soul shivered like drops of cold water when they hit hot oil.

My eyes, which were still not fully adjusted to the dim light as they are now, searched for the origin of the chill. I looked to the side and saw the boy staring at me, his vibrant yellow eyes, just like the scarabs drawn on the floor shining in the light of the fixture, staring at me. His pupils were huge, absorbing as much light as possible. As I stared at him uneasy, he adjusted his posture, seeming much more comfortable, he changed, and said:

“Beautiful, aren’t they? I still remember the first time I saw them being unpacked and arranged on the floor. I was enchanted.”

I said with a forced smile: “Yes... very beautiful. I’m amazed by the work done in this house.”

At the time, I hadn’t even realized what he had said, but what did he mean by having seen the pieces being unpacked... had they been restored and reinstalled?

Even without noticing his words, I had a discomfort stained on my face that I couldn’t hide. No matter how cordial and friendly he seemed, he carried a strangeness that I can’t explain.

“Follow me,” he said softly, stepping in front of a staircase with a beautiful arch made of the same material as the door, which now locked showed the details of its interior, intact on this side, allowing me to see the capital letter “N” in the center.

He repeated, “Follow me”, seeming annoyed that I hadn’t complied with his request. When I turned in his direction, he was already going up the stairs in the narrow staircase. A more robust person would never fit there; there was at most 27 inches of space between the walls. I probably entered through a passage that wasn’t the main one.

The floor of the staircase was also made of tiles, but these were matte and unique, one for each step. They were very well finished and watercolored, looking as if they were made of water, so perfect was the painting. The corners of each step were rounded with a metal piece, forming a triangle with an eye in the middle, golden like the boy’s eyes... getting lost in the notes and sketches that I was making on my iPad and trying to remember the dates when each technique I saw before emerged, I was abruptly interrupted.

“We’re arrived,” I heard in my mind. The boy was standing in front of a wooden door, two beautiful light fixtures illuminating its surroundings.

With a bit more light, I could finally see more details of the boy. He was wearing a beautiful blue cardigan, with some wear spots and slightly stained, but still nice and clearly very expensive.

One thing I can't stop thinking about now is that the stains seemed a little puffy on the fabric and had a slightly velvety texture, exactly like the lichen that was covering the defects of the gate... How long had he not worn that cardigan, or did he wear it regularly without washing it? The more I think about it, the weirder everything feels.

Returning to the moment I truly entered the house, which I now know is a mansion, the boy had knocked on the door three times.

He looked at me over his shoulder without moving any other muscle, like a damn owl. Now I understood why he had no friends. I used to be emo, but this was way weirder than anything I've ever done.

“Now we can enter,” he said, smiling.

Rich people have more useless social protocols than I can enumerate, but knocking on the door of your own house before entering was new. But nothing was bothering me more at that moment than the happiness of that boy to receive a strange, nosy visitor at home — me.

Until something else caught my attention: sounds of stuff being dragged across a wooden floor, metal creaking and footsteps. What was I going for, entering a fucking banker?

Before I could sink into paranoid thoughts, he opened the door with effort. It was indeed a massive wooden door, most likely made of ebony, which would make it one of the most unique doors in the world, incredibly heavy and expensive.

I passed through it.

And now I’m here, alone, sitting in an armchair in the large entrance hall. Everything here seems untouched for years, my footprints are printed in the dust that sits on the floor. From where I’m sitting, I can see the dust dancing in the faint light of the wall fixtures and the large chandelier hanging from the ceiling.

There are countless paintings on the walls, ranging from still lifes to family portraits, but one then stands out, is right in the middle of the wall where the stairs to the second floor are located. It’s at least sexteen feet tall, and the ceiling here is even higher than the walls outside.

This painting, from what I can see from where I’m at, appears to be a mother and her two children: a baby resting in her arms and an older boy, around ten years old, standing beside them. It’s certainly an old painting, both because of the style and size, but mainly because of the level of oxidation in the varnish, which is very yellowed.

I’m trying to focus on analyzing every corner of this place to occupy my mind and not give space for a breakdown. The boy went down some stairs, which I can only see from the end of a corridor that is located in the other room on the right.

He said he would call the governess since his mother was busy and could only meet me later, so he wanted her help to welcome me with excellence. That boy has been gone for over 30 minutes... I really don’t know what to do. The large door I entered is locked; I don’t see any door knobs or locks, just the same crest with a large “N” in the center.

After testing the door, I slowly, trying not to make the floor creak, walked over to one of the large curtains that stretched from the floor to the ceiling between the paintings. When I looked behind them, trying to move them as little as possible, hoping to see traditional 19th-century windows, I was surprised by beautiful, incredibly detailed herbal-themed stained glass windows that took up much of the space the curtains covered.

Hoping for a possibility of an escape to the outside, I pulled the heavy velvet curtain a bit more, and a cloud of dust, carrying that characteristic earthy, musty smell, flew over me. I waved my arms, trying to disperse it while coughing. After regaining control of my breathing, I turned my eyes back to the stained glass, and at that moment, I knew I was fucked.

The damn stained glass was fake, attached on the wall and artificially illuminated by some kind of fluorescent monolith that glowed in a toxic yellow behind it. Several of these glowing stones extended across the entire stained glass, making it shine. It was a beautiful sight, but all I wanted to see was the sidewalk with its lampposts or at least an external garden that could be my way out of this crap.

That’s why I’m writing this. I’m trapped, cornered, and I don't know what to do... I just heard a noise of something heavy being dragged upstairs.

I have a few options: wait for that damn boy to come back with the governess, stay sitting here until the mother shows up or explore for an exit. I have the room next door that has the hallway that leads downstairs, the stairs to the second floor and also another opening on the opposite side that looks like it leads to another large room. I can clearly hear water dripping from there.

I've tried calling everyone, my dad is on a work trip. I've called him 3 times and he didn't answer. I tried my two best friends too and both haven't called me back. I think the bitches are still sick from the frat party they went to yesterday, even though they knew about the work we had to do... I hate reckless people, they do crazy shit and still always get away with it, they've always been adventurous, they even broke into an abandoned theme park and nothing happened. But now if I do something a little different it ends in me being stuck in a weirdo's mansion that is apparently occupied by a governess, an absent mother and mold.

I even called the emergency but they simply said it was wrong to make prank calls and hung up on me. I really don't know what to do. I'm scared to death and it seems like every second I feel more trapped and spied on. While I'm writing this, the sound from upstairs continues and it seems like I'm also feeling a vibration coming from the floor, but it might just be my anxiety creeping me up even more.

The battery of my phone is half dead and I decided to write this to try to ask for help and also leave proof that I was here…

I think I'll investigate the paintings a little more, look at the stained glass windows and maybe I'll find a door behind the curtains.

Wish me luck, I'll update here if I find a way out or something else.
