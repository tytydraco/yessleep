Since the night of the Heathstead fire, the sleepy town of Blythe had become a buzzing hive of paranoia and superstition. After all, it wasn’t every day that a well-respected couple in the community would both meet such horrible fates. I wish I could say I was a steadying and guiding influence during these turbulent times. In truth, I was utterly lost. 



I was doubting myself and what I saw that night, and several townsfolk were beginning to doubt me too. While there were only rumors at first, word spread that I might have been involved in the fire. 



Now, these rumors were obviously false, and I spent my days saying as much, but rumors have a nasty habit of taking root. There were a handful of occasions when one of the townsfolk would ask me directly what my involvement was. While I swayed most with a partially edited version of the truth, there was one interaction that didn’t go as smoothly. 



I was performing a baptism for the youngest son of the Marlon family when the doors to the church burst open with such force they rattled on their hinges. I had barely turned around when a large, burly man with a bushy beard struck my jaw, sending me crashing into one of the pews. Mr. Marlon jumped into the scuffle before the burly man had a chance to throw any more punches.



“You fucking BASTARD! There is a special place in HELL for you!” He yelled.



I would come to find out this was Gregory, Marie’s younger brother.



“Hey Greg, settle down now,” Mr. Marlon said, straining as he held back the larger man.



“I am going to FUCKING KILL YOU!” Gregory shouted.



I tasted blood as I rubbed my jaw. Gregory huffed and yanked himself free of Mr. Marlon’s grasp.



“Count your days, preacher.”



Gregory spat on the floor and stormed out of the church as quickly as he entered. The Marlons awkwardly stayed for a few minutes before excusing themselves, leaving me alone in my empty church. 



While this was the most violent incident, it was far from isolated. It did little to help my growing self-doubt and I spent many nights that first week after the fire sitting up at night, barely able to let my mind drift long enough to fall asleep. Frankly, I was grasping at straws. I still had no idea what was happening, if anything was happening. After all, what evidence was there to go on? Some weird phrases and a supposed figure in the window?



I visited the remains of the Heathstead fire several times that first week. By now the days were growing colder and the North Atlantic wind and spray were brutal, but I felt like there had to be some clue, some hint, to what greater game was unfolding. There was nothing. All that remained were the pictures of Johnathan’s final moments, Marie’s plea for help, and the blackened remains of the place they called home.



It was just over a week after the fire when I believe I made my first breakthrough, only it wasn’t by my own doing. I was sitting up in bed, scrolling through the pictures of Johnathan’s final act, Spots curled up on my lap purring, when I first noticed the scratching. At first, I wrote it off as a tree branch brushing against the side of the church. The church was built a little way into the forest.



But the scratching persisted and after a couple of minutes, it became rhythmic. I slowly got out of bed, much to Spots’s annoyance, and began to walk the church. My room was connected to the back of the church so all I had to do was put on my slippers and grab a flashlight. 



There wasn’t anything noticeably out of place, I walked the interior walls listening intently for where the scratching was coming from, but it seemed to be coming from everywhere at once. 	



As suddenly as it started, the scratching stopped. It was a little unnerving but I stayed out in the nave for a little longer. The scratching never returned. I went to bed that night writing the whole instance off as nothing more than an overactive imagination. I didn’t even notice that Spots was hiding under my bed. 



Now at the time, I didn’t know what this meant, but a few days later I realized what caused the scratching. I was in the forests behind the church again on my normal walk, everything finally feeling as if it was going back to normal after the Heathstead fire. I turned at the Old Growth Tree and was approaching the back of the church when I saw it. 



It was another rune or symbol, just like the one Johnathan had made. It was carved into the side of the church and was nearly a foot wide. It possessed the same intricate details and looked as if it was carved with someone’s nails. Honestly, I didn’t even think about what this could mean or why it was carved into the side of my church. The only thing I thought of was that this was the proof I needed that this wasn’t limited to the Heathsteads. I snapped a picture and ran inside, almost stepping on Spots’s tail as I did so. 



I attached the Heathstead pictures and the picture of the new symbol to an email addressed as urgent meant for Cardinal Black. I quickly summarised my findings and sent the email. It wasn’t until after that I realized I probably sounded stupid, crazy, or both. But the thrill that I finally had my first lead to understanding what was going on in Blythe was too intoxicating. I felt like I finally had a grasp on what was going on. 



That night I lost my grasp yet again.



I had fallen asleep waiting for a response when I suddenly awoke with a start. A high-pitched squeal was echoing through the church. It sounded like nails on a chalkboard. I shot up and stumbled out of bed into the nave. The sound was following a straight line from somewhere at the back of the church towards the front doors. I froze realizing this.



The scratching stopped at the door and silence stretched out for several painfully long seconds. I swallowed dryly as I took a step back. Three heavy knocks echoed through the empty church causing me to jump. They were slow and deliberate, almost as if they were being restrained.



Three more knocks echoed from the door. 



“W-who is…” I started but my voice was weak. I cleared my throat before trying again, “Who is it?”



The ear-piercing squeal started again, this time moving down the door and stopping just above the keyhole. There were a few errant scratches before I heard something that made my blood run cold.



Two knocks followed by a strained, inhuman, “Go-ddd.” 



Whatever was at the door suddenly crashed against them with a force so great the doors splintered before running off into the forest faster than any man could. I backed up from the door until I hit the wall on the other side of the church, slowly sliding down until I was sitting, never once taking my eyes off those doors. I sat like that the entire night; too stunned and afraid to move. 



My laptop dinged from the other room this morning. Another priest is on his way out here to Blythe. I wish I could feel good about this news, but all I feel is sick. I still don’t have many answers but I do know one thing. Something sinister is afoot here in Blythe and I fear I might be its next target.
