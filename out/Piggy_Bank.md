Its just paper. Stacked paper adorned with the face of a monarch who has probably never held her own, dependant of course on where in the world you find yourself. 

Maybe on your paper there’s an astute man in a curled pale wig, a controversial icon of world peace, or even a collection of animals who would see the paper as something entirely inconsequential. 

It isn’t really inconsequential though, is it? *It isn’t really just paper.*

It’s the source of all conflict, the source of all war and the source of all pain and anxiety for the person who lives without it. It’s something most spend their lives obsessing over, frantically trying to stuff as much as they can into their pockets regardless of who they have to step on to get it. 

*Money makes the world go round.* 

I used to tell myself it didn’t matter. 

I used to repeat “it’s just paper” in my head every time I watched the last few pieces I had being placed into a cash register. I tried so hard to focus on all the things that are said to matter more. Things that *should* matter more.

Love. Family. Health.

All the things *they* say money can’t buy. 

The smile on the face of the nomad who prides himself on having nothing. 

I wish I had the resilience of that nomad. I wish I could smile at the sun, the rain and all the moments in between. I wish I could be grateful just to be breathing. I wish I didn’t *need* that paper and happiness was just a natural state of being. Nirvana. 

I wish I was spiritually rich enough to not be concerned about being so fucking poor. 

But humans aren’t conditioned that way. We aren’t taught to love the earth, or how to survive without subscribing to the societal norms that this civilisation expects. We’re conditioned to assimilate, to want nothing more than the glory of excess. 

The nomad is a rarity. People… most people… *they want the world.* They want as much as they can get, as much as they can stuff into their pockets. They want *everything.*

I felt the same. I am most people. 

I’d never been wealthy. Never got to taste the excess that I so desperately craved. I lived my entire life resentful of the people around me who had money, working every hour under the sun trying to get my own little slice of more. Scrubbing floors and pots and toilets in a convoluted attempt to make my fortune. It never came.

Money stays with money. It can’t buy a brain, but it can buy opportunities. The human race isn’t a fair one, we don’t value the fittest anymore. No. It’s survival of the richest. 

We all dream of a windfall. A bag of money that falls from the sky and rids us of all our worldly problems. A happily ever after smothered in that monarchs face. When you’ve accepted, as I had, that the windfall isn’t coming, it’s prospect is somewhat ridiculous. 

Thirty six years and I’d accepted my lot. My studio flat, my string of shitty minimum wage jobs, the paper bills that lay strewn across my doormat, littered with threatening red. I wasn’t destined for more. That slice I yearned for belonged to someone else. *That’s what I thought.* 

But today I finally got my windfall. *My* beautiful windfall. 

I found it inside the cistern of a nightclub toilet I was cleaning. Stacks of paper, enough to change my life completely. Enough for me to leave everything behind and start again. Probably the stash of a hapless drug dealer who hurt plenty to get his slice. 

I’d been cleaning this place for a while, long enough that they’d trusted me with the keys. Even though I knew I was the only one in the building I still turned to lock the cubicle door. I guess subconsciously I knew what I was doing was wrong, but in that moment I couldn’t care less.

I reached into the cistern and clutched at stacks of cash, feeling the smooth surface and sharp edges crumple as I forced as much as I could into my pockets. Wincing at the vicious little paper-cuts that inflicted my hands as I tried to press more screwed up notes into an impossible space. 

I stared into the cistern. The eyes of that monarch staring back at me multiple times over. I felt the sweat lining my forehead as I realised I’d run out of space. The panic that clouded my rational thought and judgement started to rise. I considered leaving, taking what I had and considering it a win

But it wasn’t enough. Not enough to warrant my inevitable firing, or the chaos that would then follow trying to find another job to make ends meet. I wanted it all. *I had to have it all.* 

I grabbed another piece of paper. I looked at the monarch, *repulsed*. Repulsed by my own desperation and the power that paper held over me. It was so much more than paper, it was beautiful, terrifying and  *intoxicating*. 

Scared and shaking, I clenched my fist around it, feeling it scrunch into the smallest ball I could force it into.

*Then I forced it down my throat.*

One by one, I choked on the tiny, screwed up pieces of notes. Feeling them twist and scratch as they passed through my esophagus. They unraveled as I swallowed hard, wrapping themselves around my insides. 

I knew it wasn’t rational. But I couldn’t stop. It was animalistic, like that paper was the only nutrition I’d had in months, sustenance needed to survive. I suppose that was true in a way. 

I swallowed every note. Every last soggy, bacteria-ridden piece of cash from inside the club toilet. I’m not proud but I did it. By the time the last one had finally gotten far enough down my throat for me to be able to take a gasp of breath, I could taste my own blood. 

I don’t know what the plan was. There never was one. Just a desperate, pathetic human being trying to protect his only chance at a slice of more. 

I tried to leave the club. To run off into the sunset to retrieve my prize and start the life I’d always dreamed of. 

I made it to the door but my legs gave in. I can’t feel them anymore. The taste of blood and bile is stronger than it was before and I can feel the embrace of the monarch on my innards.

There won’t be another person in this club for a few hours, and I doubt I have that long. I know I should be calling someone. A friend, family member… an ambulance. But I can’t. I can’t risk it. I’m too frightened of what I know they’d do…
