I’ve read a lot of the stories that people post on this site and most of them are fantastical and almost certainly not true, but a fun read nonetheless. The same can’t be said for the story I’m about to tell you. There’s no supernatural monster or nameless entity here, just a warning against the common horrors that walk the streets every day.

This happened to me back in 2016. I won’t be including any names or locations for reasons that will become obvious later. I had been living on my own for a couple years, nothing fancy, just a ground floor apartment with a landlord that was nice enough to let me have a pet as long as it wasn’t a dog or cat since he was allergic. So it was just me and my hedgehog, Quilliam. 

I was sitting on the couch, watching tv, and Quilliam was exploring my empty popcorn bowl for any stray crumbs when I heard something outside. The curtains were closed (what lunatic keeps their curtains open at night?!) but I could just see through the gap between them. A man was standing a reasonable distance from my window. I could see the glow of a cigarette in his hand and figured he was waiting for someone or just having a smoke outside before going in for the night.

Nothing to worry about. 

I went back to my movie and immediately forgot about the man. 

I must have fallen asleep at some point because the next thing I knew I was opening my eyes to the Netflix ‘are you still watching?’ screen and Quilliam was nowhere to be seen. 

And something was tapping on the window. 

Not a knock or anything especially startling, just a tiny little tap, like a sparrow pecking at a mosquito against the glass. Honestly, that’s what I thought it was. Nevermind that it was the middle of the night and any self-respecting sparrow would be safely tucked away in its nest. The mind has a funny way of accepting the most comfortable answer, whether it makes sense or not. I wouldn’t have thought anything of the noise if I hadn’t spotted Quilliam sitting on the windowsill, curled up in a ball with the curtain stuck in his quills. 

“Quilliam, how did you even get up there?” I grumbled, starting to tease the curtain out of his spines while he stayed stubbornly curled up. 

It had to move before I noticed it. Before my eyes started looking out the window and not just at it. 

A hand, the finger poised to tap its nail against the glass. A hand attached to an arm. An arm attached to a shoulder. A shoulder attached to a man. A man peering through the window at me.

This is the part where I give some sort of unsettling description of the man. His 'greasy black hair' or 'too-wide smile'. But I couldn't tell you the first thing about this guy's appearance. He was just a man. A man looking in my living room window.

I didn’t scream. I don’t scream. But I gasped loud enough to count as a scream. I snatched Quilliam off the windowsill and locked us both in the bathroom while I called the police. 

The man was gone by the time they got there, of course, and there wasn’t much else they could do other than tell me to keep my doors and windows locked and call them if he showed up again. 

I wish that was the end. I wish I could tell you that I never saw him again; that I went to stay with my sister for a few days and everything was fine. But if that was all I wouldn’t be posting this here. 

I tried to stay in my apartment for a few more days after that, and every night I would see the silhouette of the man standing a few feet away from my window. He never got as close as he had that first night, but he was still there. He wanted me to know he was there. Once he even waved at me when he noticed me looking at him. 

He never came into the building. Never knocked on my apartment door. Just stood outside the windows and looked in.

I called the police every time I saw him and he was always gone by the time they arrived. Eventually I could tell the police were starting to get annoyed with me. I was the paranoid lady that was wasting their time every night.

I couldn’t sleep. I pinned the curtains shut so there wasn’t a gap but I would still lay in bed and think of the man standing on the other side of the curtains, waiting for me to open them and see him. Because he was there. My neighbors started asking me if I was seeing anyone because they noticed a man hanging around my apartment. The lack of sleep started to affect my work. When I fell asleep at my desk in the middle of a phone call I knew something had to change.

I took a week off work and stayed with my sister for a while. By which I mean I slept on her couch for the whole week while she spoiled Quilliam with grasshoppers and crickets from her garden (no matter how many times I told her not to give him random bugs from outside). But it was good for me. My frayed nerves smoothed out and I started to feel like myself again. I couldn’t crash on my sister’s couch forever though, and once my week off was over I packed up my things and headed back to my apartment.

For the first month back I was paranoid. I jumped at every noise, especially after dark, and triple-checked that everything was locked at all times. I didn’t see the man, but I was sure he was there, waiting for a chance to look in my window again.

But, once enough time goes by without incident it gets easy to start slacking, to get back into a comfortable routine instead of a safe one. 

It was August, an unbearably hot August, and even with air conditioning my bedroom was always like a brick oven in the summer. (And an ice box in the winter thanks to the air vent being placed squarely under a solid oak dresser.)

So I left the window open.

I know you’re all screaming at me now, but think about it from my perspective: I hadn’t seen the man in a month. Maybe he saw my apartment standing empty for a week and thought I had moved so he moved on too? I just wanted to be comfortable and not have to lay in a pool of sweat for another night, and the breeze coming in the window felt so good. I thought I could leave it open for a few hours and then close it again once the room had cooled down. 

I wouldn’t have woken up if Quilliam hadn’t been making a commotion in his cage.

My God….

I would have slept through it all….

I opened my eyes to a pair of eyes looking back at me. Eyes that were open so wide they were almost vibrating. The top half of a head peeking over the edge of my bed and two hands gripping the edge of the mattress.

I said before that I don't scream. I screamed this time. I screamed so loud that my neighbor upstairs stomped on the floor and yelled at me to be quiet. 

The man was smiling. Smiling like a little kid playing hide and seek who had been spotted. He scurried out of the cut screen in my window with a giggle and disappeared behind the surrounding buildings.

I called 911 this time, not just the police. God bless the operator for listening to my unintelligible sobbing for the five minutes it took for the police to arrive. 

This time there was enough evidence of a break in to keep them from being annoyed with me, but there still wasn’t much they could do. I couldn’t give them a description and he hadn’t left any evidence behind that would help them find him. So it was the same advice: keep all the doors and windows locked and call if I saw him again.

Yeah, no.

I moved out the next day. Back to my sister’s for a while and then to a whole new state. I even changed my name in case he had figured that out somehow. 

I haven’t seen him since, but that doesn’t deter me now. I insisted on an upstairs apartment this time and the windows have never been unlocked since I moved in and the curtains stay closed. I can’t even bring myself to sit by windows in public places anymore. I know that one day I’ll look up and he’ll be standing there looking at me.

So let this be a warning to all of you.

Keep your windows locked.
