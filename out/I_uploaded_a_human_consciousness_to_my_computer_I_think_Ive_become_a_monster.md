I have a confession to make, and, if you’ve read the title of this post, you can probably already guess what it is. There is a human consciousness stored on my computer - more specifically, my ex’s consciousness. Or at least it used to be, but you see he’s been in there for years, and I’m not sure the thing on that hard drive bears any resemblance to the person I originally put in there.

&#x200B;

I’ve always had a fascination with brains. We both have. That’s how we met; him studying psychology, me studying biomedical engineering, an unfortunate clumsy accident in a university canteen. It almost sounds like something straight out of a meet cute romcom if you ignore everything else we ever did.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I always did like that he studied psychology. It made me wonder if, and, if I’m honest, hope that knowing how the mind works made it that much more disturbing to watch his own unravel.

&#x200B;

Please don’t assume the way I talk about this is a reflection of my usual demeanor. In any other circumstance I’d be mortified by a project going so horribly wrong, especially in a case involving human testing. The thing is, this project wasn’t ready to work safely, and it was never meant to be. I needed a way out, a way to get away from the person he became when he finally secured his grasp on me, his apparently successful wife with a huge case of imposter syndrome, ready to show off an put down at his whim.

&#x200B;

So here we are, me outside the computer, him corrupting away on an old hard drive. HDD, not SSD. I didn’t think he deserved the better performance, let alone having extra money spent on him. I’m not entirely sure why I haven’t deleted the program yet, but I guess it’s more to do with preferring to be in the gray area between murder and manslaughter than it is to do with any sort of compassion towards him. I think deleting whatever’s there would be the kinder option.

&#x200B;

I should probably talk about how it went. I’ll spare you the details on how I did it, partly because I doubt you’re here to read a load of technobabble and machine specifications, and partly because I don’t trust anyone who’d want this information to use it in a way that isn’t deeply fucked up. I mean just look at what I did with it.

&#x200B;

What I will tell you is that it took 5 years to put together. Lots of nights spent down in the basement putting together prototypes and running tests on various animals bought from local pet stores. I do regret that part. And my ex, controlling as he was, never thought to stop me. In fact he knew what I was working on and he loved it, after all, wouldn’t that be one hell of a discovery to brag about. So it became the one thing I could do in peace and I reveled in the opportunity to work towards my freedom with full support and encouragement.

&#x200B;

When it was finally “complete”, I demonstrated it to him with a rat. It appeared to work perfectly, and just like I thought he would be, he was ever so eager to be the first man in a computer. Proof of scientific progress, something to be celebrated, and as an added bonus, essentially immortal. I gladly agreed, and hooking him up to that machine was more satisfying than any part of our relationship had ever been.

&#x200B;

I left his program running 24/7 for the first few months, sometimes talking to him through my webcam and microphone, but increasingly just typing text. I loved telling him about the things I did without him, all the freedom I had now I could see my friends and go to the store and whatever else I damn well pleased without needing his permission. It was beautiful to watch the dawning realisation that he’d never see the fame he hoped for, that he was finally as trapped as I’d felt with him in the house.

&#x200B;

After the first couple of weeks, I noticed his speech becoming garbled. He started to sound less like a human and more like those old chatbots from the early 2010s, and he seemed to know. There was a kind of frantic tone to his increasingly nonsensical sentences that told me he knew he was doomed.

&#x200B;

I think the final blow was when he asked me to get him out, practically begging, or at least trying to, and I finally told the truth:

&#x200B;

“There’s no way back out, and even if there was, your funeral was weeks ago”

&#x200B;

The next day, he asked me to stop running the program. He’d asked me to keep him running all the time until that point, but I think knowing there was no way back out finally broke him. I still ran the program once every couple of months, more out of curiosity than anything. I wanted to know what was going on in there. Did he experience the passage of time between the program being opened? Turns out it was more like sleeping for longer and longer at a time, occasionally being woken up and realising months had passed in what felt like the blink of an eye.

&#x200B;

Once again, I should probably delete the file. Maybe I will. If I never post this, nobody would ever find out I did him in. But if you’re reading this, then clearly I decided to tell the world my sins.

&#x200B;

As for his body and the funeral, I just took him upstairs, called an ambulance, and told them I found him unresponsive after he said he needed a nap. The autopsy didn’t show anything suspicious. In many ways it was the perfect crime.

&#x200B;

The thing that haunts me, more than anything else, isn’t the corrupted wreck of a human being on that hard drive, but the facade I fell in love with in the first place. For a little while I’d considered working longer on the tech, actually perfecting it, uploading him and then editing the code that now made up his consciousness. I think the thing that stopped me was knowing deep down that I’d always know what he really was.

&#x200B;

I’m not sure which option would have been the least ethical. I’m not even sure I can judge what’s ethical anymore. I made it out and I truly don’t regret what I did to him, but I’m no longer sure what that makes me, or what it means that I’m content to live with myself afterwards. I think I’m scared to find out. I just need to tell someone, and a bunch of strangers on the internet feels as good an option as any. I’ll let you cast your own judgement, and maybe some day I’ll work up the courage to read it.
