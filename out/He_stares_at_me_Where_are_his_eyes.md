Sometimes, I truly and fully believe that we are just lucky to live in the good reality. I feel like we walk and talk surrounded by what we call normalcy, and are blissfully ignorant to the putrid and decaying terrors that thrive under this first layer. I think there's a bad reality, an *other place.* Here, and there.

And sometimes it bleeds through our lives. Things - desperate, slippery, darkened - just squeeze through. Like roaches, trying to live.

That's how *he* came here. I feel it. I'm not superstitious, but *he* is the image of what I imagined the other place would look like. His face is burned and his eyes are wide and never-blinking. His body is burned, too - his skin does not exist - or never did, his black flesh just clings to his bony shoulders and incorrect limbs.

He has hair. He can smile. Does he know what it means?

I saw him a while ago - I was stoned out of my mind. I puked the first time I saw him.

I think he follows me because he feels I am afraid. He just stares. Every time I am alone, his face pops up from behind a door, a window, under the bed, anywhere. Hair dangling. Eyes wide. Mouth closed, sometimes.

I don't know what the fuck this thing wants, but he's lucky I wasn't very sane in the first place, because, no matter how much I fear him, he can't get me to act on it. My head is already pretty numb from the pills and I could not give a fuck about what he plans to do to me. I am afraid, yes, as any other human being, but that can't get me to do anything to confront him.

... those were my thoughts for the majority of last year. I think he finally cracked the code - he finally found out how to make me afraid.

See, a few days ago, I felt him staring at me again. I felt his presence and saw his burned silhouette through the doorway. I wondered what would happen if he were to come closer - could I have the courage to touch him?

I looked up from my computer and stared at him. He stared at me back, but his eyes were gone.

Instead, two empty, black sockets looked back at me. I squinted. I shifted in my couch - the sockets seemed to follow. *What the fuck?*

I frowned. Why were his eyes gone?

"Hey... what do you want?" I finally asked, unsure of what to do. "You've been here for a year or so. I'm tired."

He didn't answer. Just pointed to his eyes.

"Yeah, I saw. I can't help you with that."

He lowered his hand, slowly. His fingers twitched, like they were remembering something. Then, he tilted his head, not in confusion, but more like he was... listening. I didn’t hear anything.

Then he turned and walked away.

That was the first time he *left*.

And I should have felt relief. But I didn’t. I felt like something had been decided without me. Like a conversation had happened in a language I didn't know, and I had just nodded at the wrong moment.

The next day, the shadows in my apartment started behaving differently.

Then I noticed the apartment was wrong.

Slightly.

The angles of the ceiling didn’t meet cleanly anymore. The light fixtures were dripping, ever so slowly, something dark that disappeared before touching the floor. And the windows… didn’t look outside.

They looked into *another* apartment. And something was moving in it.

I ran to the bathroom, turned on the faucet. Nothing came out but a long, rattling wheeze - like a throat clearing itself in the walls. My reflection wasn’t there.

He was.

Staring out at me from the other side of the mirror. Close. Hair dangling. Eyes still gone. Mouth smiling.

Except this time, I realized something.

That wasn’t *my* bathroom behind him. The tiles were wrong. Cracked. Wet. Alive, maybe. And hanging just behind his shoulder was a hook made of what looked like bone.

I stepped back.

He mirrored me, perfectly.

But then he *lifted his hand*, while mine stayed still.

And pointed at me.

And pointed behind me.

I turned.

And saw nothing.

Until I looked *down*.

One of its eyes was shoved into the floorboards, watching me. That was when I realized that he hadn't given up on his sight - just chosen to watch me from different angles. Even if he was gone, or even if I could clearly see him, I wouldn't know where *he* watched me from. I'd never know precisely where his eyes were. 

It makes me wonder... I've always been more sensitive to these... anomalies of the world. My friends claim nothing is wrong with my apartment, but I know what I saw and I know he is still watching me. Maybe you won't believe me.

Have you ever thought the way a tree's bark resembled eyes was funny? The way the knots in a plank seemed to look at you? 

Have you ever noticed how water circles move, as if it's blinking?

They're everywhere. Sometimes I catch glimpses of his eyes. Sometimes I don't. Doesn't take away from the feeling of being watched.

I don't know what to do.
