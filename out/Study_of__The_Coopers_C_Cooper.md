C. Cooper's statement are as follows.

" 

The trailer we were in when this happened was worn down by both time and lack of upkeep. However, the warmth inside it and the  siren song of heavy rain on the roof called me to sleep like a sailor to the depths. 

I remember I placed worn and tattered work boots by the door upon my entry and my ex wife had served some kind of beef stew that, while not great was warm and filling. 

Our newborn, [J. Cooper] wouldn't stop whaling and my ex wife continued to prove herself incapable of any sort of mediocrity. His bitching persisted despite her half assed efforts to pretend to be a capable mother. 

This show soured my experience and I quickly moved myself away from them and lumbered to the shower. 

The hot water and steam did what it could to distract me from the fact that I'd given up pretending to care for this farce of a family. 

[The ex wife] was dramatic and fiery when we'd met. Attributes a younger more rebellious version of myself found sexually intriguing. However, after the pregnancy these atteibutes were now aimed at me and ground down both my mind and emotional state like sand paper day in and day out. 

Long work hours left me physically exhausted, but even more so than that the 25 to 30 foot walk from the car to the trailer when I got home weighed on me more than an eternity of hard labor.

The bastard kid was born yellow and moody. Some sun would have done him a lot of good. But the shit head chose to be born during a historically rainy October.

I finished my shower, and took a few shots of Jim I kept hidden in the towels. Quickly I shot passed the two leeches who were in my trailer and made my way to a warm bed.

The relaxation of my muscles initially hurt and then released a mix of bliss and looseness in my body that almost made my life worth living at that point. 

The blissful void of my unconscious state was interrupted by light knocking on our bedroom door. When I looked around I saw both my [ex] wife and [J. Cooper] had joined me in bed and were asleep. 

The light knocking continued but I was drawn to it. Like a moth I was intoxicated by it's allure. I walked slowly to the door and put my hand up to the hollow core door. I could feel the subtle vibrations of the light knocking calling to me.

There was another feeling building in my stomach. A choice. Somehow I felt that opening that door was entering the realm of something else. Something more than this shitty life. 

I opened it without hesitation.

Standing in the hallway was a woman. She was beautiful. She was clad in a blue sundress. The whites of her eyes glowed a pale yellow to me while her pupils were surrounded by an ocean of pale blue. 

She didn't seem to notice me initially. But seemed to look through me. 

Regardless, I closed the gap between myself and her. I needed to connect to her. This ethereal allure and the possibility of an escape from my current life left me powerless to resist. 

When I was close enough to touch her. She seemed to move slowly. Laying her hand flat. As if I was supposed to lay mine on top of hers. 

Doing so, she felt comforting and caring. But somehow, I just knew this emotion was not directed at me. I also knew my hand was immobile. 

My assessment of the situation was interrupted by immense pain. I couldn't react but I felt it. Warmth running down my arm and the flesh of my hand severed by cold steel. 

When I was finally able to move I screamed. A large kitchen knife had been stabbed through the palm of my hand with more than half of the blade visible through the other side. 

I continued to scream and tremble when I fell. I looked up at the woman and she continued to smile and walked into the bedroom where they slept. I stood up to slam into her but I fell with a loud thud to the floor instead of making contact with her. 

This woke up my [ex] wife and the baby [J. Cooper] I was rushed to a hospital and blood was all over the living room.

The ER told me I had more than 30 large cuts and a massive stab wound in my hand. 

I don't know what the fuck happened that night but the pain meds at the hospital were the first ones I'd ever had and I still blame them for "


Mr. C. Cooper continued to blame hospital staff and medical practitioners in general for his addiction to pain killers and spiral into alcoholism. But the continuation of the statement does not relate to the experience of the indeterminate.
