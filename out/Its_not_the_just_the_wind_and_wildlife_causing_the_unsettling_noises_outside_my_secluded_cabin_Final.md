  Once I managed to regulate my breathing and crazy thoughts, I called the police. I wasn't about to investigate this one alone, even with only the sounds of the dwindling storm beyond the walls. Max was still acting uneasy, stealing glances at the door on occasion, but was no longer growling or barking.   
  
  
  With it being close to five in the morning at this point, the 911 operator seemed reluctant to send anyone out at first, recommending that I wait until sunup. After I described what I saw in the footage; though, he assured me that a squad car would be here within the hour.   
  
  
  A good two hours later, as the sun began to rise, I heard the car pulling up. Between the rain still coming down quite heavily, and the world beyond these walls no longer cloaked in darkness, I was fairly certain that they wouldn't find anything.   
  
  
  The officers were friendly enough, while obviously irritated about having to come out here at this hour. They walked around the cabin for a while, after I showed them the unsettling footage, but they didn't find anything more than the damaged camera.   
  
  
  It looked as though it had been nailed by a baseball bat, the entire casing split in multiple places, and the screen shattered. Officer Grange, the taller and younger of the two, appeared a little unnerved by both the damage to the trail cam and the silhouetted figure on the video.   
  
  
  He assured me that there was no trace of anything to worry about in the vicinity of the cabin or any sign of someone attempting to break in. I told him about the unsettling noises over the previous weeks, but he just shrugged those off.   
  
  
  He said that a forest at night can produce a wealth of eerie sounds, between the wind and the wildlife, suggesting that I was simply not used to my surroundings yet. Given that I was accustomed to a more populated area, I couldn't deny that he was likely right, but that didn't make me feel any more at ease with my current situation.   
  
  
  Once they headed out, certain that whoever had smashed my camera was likely long gone by now, I locked up and fell into my bed. With how exhausted my body and mind were by this point, I passed right out, even with my thoughts still all over the place.   
  
  
  The following morning, I made a trip into town to replace the broken camera, along with a small cage to hopefully protect it from further attacks. When I returned to the cabin to find the door open, and no trace of Max, I felt my heart practically leap into my throat.   
  
  
  I ran inside, barely registering the split wood around where the doorknob used to be, calling out for my dog. Without the slightest whine or moan replying to me, I sprinted back outside, practically screaming the name of my faithful companion. Still nothing–not as much as the rustling of the dried leaves or scampering squirrels.   
  
  
  Before I headed back into the cabin, trying to figure out if I should call the authorities again, I inspected the one remaining camera, mounted by the tree line. To my surprise, it still had not suffered the same fate as its sibling, and I hoped that it could reveal what went on over my brief trip into town.   
  
  
  Fighting to convince my near-spasming fingers to obey my commands, as they trembled against the screen of my tablet, I finally managed to cue the most recent footage. I watched on as my truck pulled away, the echoing sounds of Max barking his pleas to not be left alone in the background.   
  
  
  With my chaos-fueled thoughts, his bargaining yelps inspired a sensation of guilt, driving a series of nails into my chest. As the video progressed, showing nothing more than the wind stirring the leaves, I managed to regulate my breathing and racing heart–something that didn't last for long.   
  
  
  As the barking began to settle down, Max having finally accepted my departure, the next few minutes passed by uneventfully. That was until the barking not only resumed but grew more frantic than before. It was no longer the hopeless yelps of a dear friend, upset that his roommate had ditched him, but the frenzied and borderline manic howls of anger and fear.   
  
  
  It took me a moment to register what was happening, as my eyes panned across the screen. But when I focused on the ground, maybe fifteen to twenty feet from the patio, where the forest floor appeared to be swelling beneath the leaves, I could almost feel my heartbeat stop cold.   
  
  
  I had been pacing back and forth, with my device clenched between both hands. But when a slender and bony hand breached the ground, like the undead rising from its grave, I found myself stumbling in search of the closest chair.   
  
  
  I fell onto the plush, cushioned seat of my recliner, my jaw unhinging at the sight of the skeletal figure, as it appeared to be birthed by the dirt and grass. Max was wailing even louder, as I whispered words of denial to the imagery before me.   
  
  
  Long, matted, and stringy hair fell upon the bony shoulders of the hauntingly slender man (?), as he approached the door, dragging his bare feet across the ground like a pouting child. He was wearing only torn and stained jeans that hung from his scrawny frame as though there were no legs within them.   
  
  
  Stopping short, only a foot or two from the door, he tilted his head to the ground, his hair peeling away from his shoulders as he hunched over. Crouching down, almost to a sitting position, he raised back up with something in his hand, resuming skidding his heels closer to the door.   
  
  
  The footage was somewhat grainy, making it difficult to make out what he held. But as he raised it above his head, I could see the rough shape of the hefty rock, before he slammed it down upon the knob, protruding from the door.   
  
  
  Over and over again, he crashed the large stone against the knob, until it tore away from the door, falling to the wooden deck below. He did not enter, only stood before the entryway, as it creaked open, ever so slightly.   
  
  
  With Max barking all the more aggressively, neither the one before nor the one behind the door showed any motivation to pass through. It felt as though there was a silent staring match going on, both participants daring the other to make the first move.   
  
  
  When the slender figure began to back away, turning slowly with his head still tilted, revealing only that matted hair and emaciated chest, I tried desperately to release the breath I was holding. He showed no haste in his movements, as he returned to the spot from which he had exited the forest floor.   
  
  
  Lowering himself to his knees, he leaned over, with his arms outstretched, slowly slithering into the earth, like a creeping snake. I watched on in horror until the ground had swallowed him whole, leaving barely a trace of his arrival.   
  
  
  I still gazed on, slack-jawed and trembling, zoned in on that patch of dirt and dead leaves, just waiting for the figure to spring back out. It wasn't until the unyielding barks grew a little louder when I noticed the door to the cabin creaking open, with a curious Max, peaking his snout across the threshold.   
  
  
  I shouted at my tablet, begging my faithful hound to stay, my heart threatening to tear itself in two. I continued my pointless bargaining, as my dog strolled onto the front deck, sniffing the wooden planks in between his barks.   
  
  
  He still sounded agitated, but more focused on his investigation, edging closer to the spot from which the figure had both appeared and vanished. I knew what was coming, as Max stopped in place, brushing the leaves with the tip of his nose. But when that skeletal hand sprang from the earth, snatching him by the collar, a muffled howl was all he was able to let loose, before he was pulled into the earth.   
  
  
  Momentarily paralyzed by the events I had just witnessed, I just sat there, my flesh spasming from head to toe. Snapping myself back to reality, I jumped to my feet, running to my bedroom to grab my gun, and tossing my tablet onto the bed.    
  
  
  I pulled it from my nightstand with one hand, dialing 911 with the other. The operator told me to stay put until a squad car would arrive, but my thoughts were so frantic by this point, I had no idea what to do. I just paced back and forth, with the woman on the other end of the line making her best attempts to call me down.   
  
  
  I had just about convinced myself to take a seat and wait for the police to arrive when I grew aware of a scuffling sound beyond the splayed-open front door. Standing at the entrance to my bedroom, the voice of the operator fading into an echo behind my fear, I backed into the room, closing and locking the door before me.   
  
  
  I cut my eyes to the gun in my hand, to the window of my bedroom, and to the tablet, resting face down on the bed. I picked it up, my violently trembling fingers once more battling to navigate the touch screen, pulling up the ongoing footage from the trail cam, mounted at the tree line.   
  
  
  He was just standing there, only feet from the front door again, seemingly glaring at the entrance. I whispered this to the 911 operator, while she demanded that I remain in place until the officers arrive. But when I heard the creaking of the boards of the front deck, and saw that haunting figure on the screen stalking closer by the second, my rational mind was completely muted by my fear.   
  
  
  I dropped my phone as I charged the door to my bedroom, throwing it open to see the pale, wrinkled flesh and skeletal frame standing on the threshold. The stringy, gray, and muddy hair only parted enough to reveal that pure white and bloodshot eye gazing into mine, but that haunting gaze almost froze me in place.   
  
  
  As he took one more step, crossing from the outside world to the one within these wooden walls, I snapped out of my paralyzed trance, holding my gun outstretched.   
  
  
  “I'll do it,” I said, the cold metal shivering in my hand.   
  
  
  The man only staggered closer, still gazing into my fracturing mind.   
  
  
  “I'll fucking shoot! I swear to…”  
  
  
  As his casual saunter transformed into a run, charging right at me, I pulled the trigger. With my shuddering extremities and almost crippling fear, I can't honestly say if I meant to fire that bullet into the wall, or if my aim was dramatically altered at the time. But when my pistol discharged, the man instantly turned, sprinting back through the door.   
  
  
  I ran after him, hoping that I could stop him before he dove back beneath the earth, but he didn't stop. By the time I reached the treeline, my side-splitting from the hastened sprint, I could only make out his silhouette, while he darted between the trees ahead.   
  
  
  Moments later, while I stood in that same spot, my heart still racing, I heard the sirens drawing closer. Even with my harried thoughts all over the place, I knew it would not be the best idea to greet the officers with a gun in my hand. So I headed back into the cabin to set it down, before walking back outside.   
  
  
  Two cars pulled up, one of which contained the two officers from before. If nothing else, that saved me from having to explain the entire story again. I did feel a little apprehensive about my having gone against the recommendation of the operator, charging out with my gun in hand. But Officer Grange said he would have likely done the same.   
  
  
  It was honestly quite impressive how quickly the four got to work on investigating the scene. It didn't take them long to uncover the truth behind the man's appearance from beneath the ground either, peeling open the well-camouflaged flap that blended seamlessly with the surrounding terrain.   
  
  
  While they would not allow me to descend with them into the underground structure, what they did reveal to me about it may haunt me for the remainder of my days. The two who climbed down were pale and shaken when they came back up, one of them retching across the leaves.   
  
  
  With the scent emitting from below, my guts almost rebelled as well, so I can only imagine how much more potent it was inside. Without being too descriptive, they told me about the scattered bones, traces of viscera, gore, and human waste, all over the sizable structure.   
  
  
  The underground dwelling, which was only one, wide, but well furnished room, reached under the cabin itself. Though Officer Grange told me there didn't appear to be any trapdoors, or hidden entrance into the house, it still left me horrified, knowing that the stranger had been right beneath me, this whole time.   
  
  
  It would appear that this man had been living there for quite some time, feeding off the wildlife he dragged into his domain. They found Max, unconscious but still grasping onto life, my heart breaking as they carried him out. He was in bad shape, with multiple, oozing wounds that looked to have been made by human teeth.   
  
  
  Did this man devour these poor creatures raw, feasting on their flesh while they still fought to survive? How did he keep them from fighting back, while he ate them alive? Would I ever be able to get this imagery out of my head?   
  
  
  Within the day, more vehicles showed up, sealing off the area to fully investigate everything. I would have to relocate while this was ongoing, but I was not planning to stay either way. Suffice it to say, I had lost my desire to live out in the middle of nowhere.   
  
  
  I am very happy to report that Max recovered from his many brutal injuries. He has a few limitations, a limp on his right foreleg, and he's not quite as spritely as he used to be. But I can only imagine how much an experience like this can traumatize an innocent dog. He's slowly coming back to himself, and I make sure to let him know, every day, how grateful I am that he survived this nightmare.   
  
  
  It's been some months since I moved away from that cabin, having relocated to a well-populated, suburban street. Yes, I'm still not a fan of being surrounded by people, coming and going. But I find a certain degree of peace in the sounds of garage doors opening, cars driving by, and children playing outdoors. At least I know where those noises are coming from.   
  
  
  They never turned up anything on the man who lived beneath the ground, just outside that cabin in the woods. They did; however, discover that not all of the bones belonged to animals. I can't help but wonder if the previous residents of that little house did indeed move away, or if they lived out the remainder of their life in that forest, after all.   
  
  
  Somehow, I have a feeling that, no matter what happened that day, I would have been vacating that cabin one way, or another. Yeah. I think I can get used to the life of a [suburbanite](https://www.reddit.com/r/WillRayne/s/7qfI6sDFKC)
