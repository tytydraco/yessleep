Never in my life did I ever think that I would have to come out and say something like this.

You could call it every mother's worst nightmare, call it the worst thing that could happen to your child, call it whatever you want. But, my daughter, Bekka, hasn't been seen since last Thursday.

I've filed at least three police reports and put up the obligatory missing child posters on every land post, which would eventually be covered up and forgotten like my daughter if she's not found soon. I called everyone in my contacts until I broke down into a series of sobs until my face was almost unrecognizable.

I don't know what I'd do without my daughter, ever since her father left it's just been us. That's the only place I could've possibly fathomed she'd go alone, she's such a patient girl. That same sliver of hope was being decimated by a call from my ex-husband Trent in regards to if I knew where she was.After a series of screams and insults for being so ignorant that she could've been here if I had just watched her, he finally said something that could help me get a lead on her.

She left her new phone on the kitchen counter before she vanished.

I almost instinctively hung up the phone, barrelling into the kitchen, and grabbing the phone off of the counter. What I found was... nothing? Even though her phone was relatively new, there should've been some sign of life on it, but there was nothing. No pictures, No contacts, No nothing of use.But there wasn't exactly anything either. After a certain point of looking, I just gave up. She had probably reset her phone before she disappeared, I thought, my eyes glancing at the Echo Dot across the room. She had always loved using that damned thing. I would have to come down in the early hours of the morning to ask her to turn off Love Story by Taylor Swift or some other cheesy pop song like that.

I don't know exactly what, but something deep inside told me to play that song, it would make me feel closer to her. She had played that song right before her disappearance.

My finger hovered over the hot pink music app, tears forming in my eyes as I opened the app.When I opened it I was beyond confused when I saw the oddly placed arrangement of recordings in a playlist without a cover titled, " 1".

Waves of hope quickly began brewing into a wild storm of anxiety in my stomach as I opened the contents of the playlist.

The playlist had 4 songs or recordings on it all made by her, all titled times, 3:14 AM, 3:15 AM, 3:16 AM, and 3:17 AM. They were all in chronological order based on the time they were recorded I surmised. I clicked on the first recording, expecting to be hit with pleas from my daughter, and that she had been kidnapped and was okay but I needed to get her asap. As bad as that seemed, anything was better than nothing, at least she would be okay.

What I was met with was the polar opposite of that, I was met with a series of low groans that sounded like they were tearing something apart by the seams. It sounded like I was being torn apart. accompanied by a shuffling that could have only been made by some kind of foliage in our yard. What the hell? I opened the remained of recordings, and they all had the same animalistic noise, only each recording got a little bit louder. In the first recording it was far away, whereas in the last recording, I could almost feel the thing breathing its hot breathy air on my neck, creeping up on me.

I exited the playlist, and opened the second titled "2".

This time, I heard shrills of terror as soon as I opened the first and only recording titled "4:00 AM". I could tell that they were from my daughter by the way that the voice trembled and quivered like a little girl, mine.

Then my mind stopped.

Her Dad. The dog.

She had recorded that stuff to send to me and accidentally downloaded it.

Trent bought a massive pit bull, Bullet two years ago. She must've been with her dad that night. She was at her dad's.

Trent.

I drove as fast as the speed limit would let me until I got to his house, banging like a madman until he answered the door.

Trent's door swung open, a horrified expression plastered on his face." Where's your dog? I need to know-"  
" In the back, she's been-"

I darted into the backyard, where my daughter had to have been before she left. She was at her dad's house playing with the dog. What the hell happened? I slowly stepped into the back of the backyard, vomit beginning to form in the back of my throat as the closer I got to that dog the more a putrid scent filled my nostrils

I walked over to the dog, each step felt a little closer to vomiting.

And nothing in the world could've stopped the vomit that poured out of me when I saw my daughter's bracelet next to the dog as he chewed on a bone the size of my daughter's femur.
