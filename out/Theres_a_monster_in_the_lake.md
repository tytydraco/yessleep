Today I was walking through the woods down by where I work, theirs this little path that winds down past the lake. Me and my dad used to go fishing at the lake I remember the musty smell of stagnant water, the buzzing of the dragon flies and mosquitoes. All of that came rushing back to me as I remember my father’s killing, he was killed by the monster of the lake, a dark demon born to kill and tear families apart. I was there when my father was killed, he was sliced limb from limb only to be swallowed by the lake, I was standing there covered in his blood I ran from the lake in fear of the monster. The police found me walking down the highway 3 miles from the lake they picked me up and interviewed me, they asked me questions and I blamed it all on the monster, “he was the one the killed my dad” I kept saying they kept me in the interview room until my mom arrived, there was a nice deputy there who brought me hot chocolate and told me it was all going to be ok. My mom almost threw up at the sight of me covered in my dad’s blood, there was a big investigation to find my dads killer they chocked it up to trauma or shock my blaming of the monster of course some believed. The news that there was a monster in the lake spread like wildfire, there was regional news coverage and people even came from other states to see the lake where the lake monster lived hoping to catch a glimpse, of course I hoped they wouldn’t.

 

The next few months were like a blur the news eventually moved on the case got dropped due to a lack of evidence, my mom used to take me down to the lake to visit the place where my father was taken from us, she visited more often than me almost daily, of course she would be the next to go. The monster stalked her from the trees watching and waiting for the perfect moment to strike, she was wearing the same red striped scarf she always wore. He snuck up behind her reached up high and wrapped his fingers around her neck choking her, first she turned red the same shade as her scarf, then turned blue gasping for any air she could like a fish out of water, then nothing her eyes glazed over and her body went limp. He proceeded to hack the body apart pieces of her flying everywhere, blood spattered the grass pieces of flesh scattered the trees surrounding the lake until she was dragged into the lake and fell to the murky depths. Once again there was a buzz of people coming into town to try and catch a glimpse, some people took advantage of the situation selling t-shirts and mugs plastered with pictures of what they thought the monster looked like it was green and scaley with large claws the size of pencils and big almost frog like eyes, of course I was the only one who knew what the monster looked like. There were camara crews at my door asking me all sorts of questions and wanting me to describe the monster if it wasn’t for that deputy I might have spilled everything. She took me in she was kind and sweet almost as sweet as her hot chocolate, so of course she was the next victim.

 

The detective’s name was Sarah she was great she had a nice smile but that made the monster angry, he didn’t like me to be happy he was watching me always waiting to take something away. Sarah began investigating the killing of my parents again even though at this point it had been so long that it was considered a cold case, but I think that she was doing it for me, I think she thought I needed some sort of closure but the more she investigated the closer to the truth she came. The monster began watching her when she slept, he would walk down the hall open her door and stand there waiting for the prime moment, I didn’t want to hurt her, but the monster said we had to, if she found out the truth she wouldn’t love us anymore and we would get into trouble. We took a knife from the kitchen in our hand and slid it into her chest soft and slowly it was so sharp it was like butter, she sprayed blood all over the room it began pouring out of her mouth and she began to choke. I fell to the ground crying on the floor, or did we begin carving I can’t remember but she ended up where they all end up in the lake. It has been 12 years since that night I let the monster out every so often just enough to keep it satisfied, the towns folk say the monster saved their town with so many people coming every year our town has become a bit of a tourist attraction. It keeps the monster at bay and me in business as the new sheriff, that being said our towns missing persons are the highest in the state.
