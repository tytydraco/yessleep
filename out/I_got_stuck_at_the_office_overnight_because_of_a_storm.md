My alarm rings at 7, I snooze it three times. 

By 7:30, I know that if I don’t get up I will definitely be late to work. Sam’s body is wrapped in my arms and her skin is warm against mine. I squeeze her closer for a second and breathe her in: she smells like clean sheets and vanilla. A deep breath later, I unwrap my arms, doing everything I can to not stir her as I slip the arm underneath her head free. I sit up and swing my legs off the bed and become a machine with the sole purpose of preparation for the work day. Time becomes immaterial and when I return to my body I am wearing a white button-down shirt, blue tie, black slacks, and black dress shoes that were slightly too tight but not so tight as to warrant replacement. Breakfast is yogurt with protein powder mixed in so I can stay full until my lunch break at noon and a cup of coffee. I hear Sam’s footsteps above me as she gets up to go to the bathroom. The creaking of floorboards in our townhouse is one of the few signs that there is life here when I am getting ready for work. Sam is lucky enough to work from home so she won’t be properly getting up for another forty-five minutes at least. Sometimes she will come and say goodbye to me before work, but today she returns to the bed. I hear her steps returning to our room and I hear the springs of the bed as she lays back down in her spot, sans one boyfriend. I finish my coffee and sigh. 

Then I am in my car and halfway to work. I pull up to the light, my blinker clicking in my ear as I wait for all the cars going in the opposite direction to pass. I repeat my daily mantra of “Why the fuck isn’t this a protected left?” 

By the time each of the cars pass, the light is yellow and I speed through the intersection before I get stuck in the middle of it. One of the cars honks at me as it tears through the space where I used to be. The images of a crash flash through my mind as I keep driving and prepare for the second left turn I have to make into the parking garage. I come to a halt and turn on my blinker one final time. I stare in my rearview mirror at the cars I am holding up and probably making late for their own days at work; thankfully, none of them have started honking at me yet. There is not enough room on the side of the street to pass me, all of the street parking has been taken. They have no choice but to wait behind me, and I have no choice but to make them. 

Mercifully, the wait for this turn is not nearly as long, and I pull into the garage and find a spot quickly enough that I have a minute to sit and breathe in my car before I have to rush up to the office. I focus on the way my breath feels as it flows through my nose and imagine each of the little pockets in my lungs filling with air. After I’ve taken three of these breaths, I push open my door and step out of my car. My footsteps echo through the parking garage; the clicks of my dress shoes on the concrete playing back to me like a metronome. I scan over the license plates to see who came in today. The Friday before Memorial day usually turns the place into a graveyard, the empty parking spaces now tombstones for my coworkers who have quite literally gone to a better place. 

Bowman is here, because of course he is. He hasn’t taken a day off since his wife moved out. I think he is sleeping at the office. He is always the last person left at the end of every day, no matter how late we end up staying, and his car is also always here no matter how early I arrive. He’s been hovering behind my desk for three weeks and I doubt today will be any different. The reports for the Exeter account need to be finished by today, which they will be, but Bowman certainly doesn’t seem to believe that. Of all the things that his wife took with her, she decided to leave the stick that was up his ass. Poor bastard. 

The elevator is empty, and the light is still flickering. It went out completely around the third floor like it always did, and it’s back on by the fifth. The fourth floor is always dark on the ascent to the eleventh floor where the office is. That shaded moment always feels oddly comforting to me. For a couple of seconds, I am not here, I am still asleep in bed with my arms wrapped around Sam. Then the light flashes on again and I am blinded, and the momentary peace is burned away  — nothing more than an afterimage in my mind. 

The eleventh floor is bustling in its quiet way when I reach it. The tapping of keyboards and the plodding of feet on the carpet fills my ears and I add to it as I quickly slip over to my cubicle. I turn on my computer and listen to the whirring of its fans as it blinks into life. The little light that begins at the center of the screen as it turns on always makes me think of the Big Bang. Suddenly a tiny universe bursts into life in front of me and now my work day has officially begun. 

From there the hours begin to blend together. The tapping and plodding continues until it fades into white noise that accompanies my nearly endless clicking, typing, and yawning. Every now and then the monotony is broken by the cracking of my joints or the appearance of Bowman at my cubicle asking for any updates on the Exeter reports.

“They need to be completed by the end of the day, you know,” he says. There is coffee dripping from his blond mustache. He licks it off and repeats, “the end of the day, Frankie.”	“I asked you to call me Francis, Bill,” I say back. I don’t take my eyes off the computer, I continue filling in cells in the spreadsheet dutifully so that he knows I am dedicated to my work and there is no need to worry. The sense of cordiality that he assumes he has with me has been a source of frustration for my eight months at this job, but no matter how many times I correct him on my preferred name he continues to think he has earned the right to call me by a nickname: a nickname I don’t even use in my personal life. No one calls me Frankie. I have always been Francis, but for some reason I am Frankie to William “Bill” Bowman and no one else in the office or elsewhere. 

“Oh that’s right I’m sorry, bud. But I’ll let you get back to it, it seems like you’re really in the zone. Talk to you later, Frankie — oh sorry again.” He chuckles at his mistake but I don’t even flinch. He is right about one thing, I am in the zone. 

When I look up next, it is noon and I hear the chatter of my coworkers as they all leave the office to go get their lunch. For whatever reason, no one else ever really seemed to stay here for lunch. I always hated leaving work to get lunch. It used up so much time to leave and come back that I always feel like I wasted the only time I have to myself during the workday. I hit save I think about four times before I get up and head to the break room. I follow the pattern of the checkerboard carpet, stepping in repetitive L shapes like I am a knight on a chess board until I get to the breakroom. 

I didn’t pack a lunch, so I just buy a bag of chips and a soda from the vending machines and call that a meal. Sam is certainly awake by now and she’s certainly seen my lunchbox sitting on the counter —- left behind once again. My phone buzzes in my pocket and I already know it is a picture of that very lunchbox along with a slightly aggressive message asking why she bought me that thing if I was never going to use it. Which is fair, if I’m being honest, but I also just prefer to stay in bed the extra few minutes than make a turkey sandwich that I will probably find to be soggy and disgusting by the time I get to my lunch break. The texture of soggy bread makes me gag, and if that happens, I’ll just throw the whole sandwich out anyway, so why waste the food? I have explained this to her, and she responded with the, admittedly reasonable, point that I can just make something else for lunch instead. But I keep buying the material for turkey sandwiches. At least I make them on the weekends, or for a quick dinner if she’s not home and I don’t feel like cooking. 

The chips are crunchy and cheesy, with just a little bit of space which wakes me up. The soda is a cold, sweet diet cola that washes down the chips with ease. I let out a belch, say, “Excuse me” to the empty breakroom, and return to my desk. I spend the remainder of my lunch watching videos on my phone and nursing the cola. Once 1:00 hits, I slowly begin the process of logging back on to my computer. Over the last few months, I’ve managed to perfect the process to such a point that my password is entirely muscle memory, the files are a quick find, and the process of cell-filling begins anew.

Except the files aren’t there. I scour my saved files from top to bottom. I check my trash folder. But there is nothing, the Exeter reports have exited. 

My face collapses into my palms and I feel my chest tighten. I try to take deep breaths but they all come out shallow, and the air begins to taste disgustingly stale, like the floor has become airtight and we’ve all been recycling each other’s breath for the last four hours. My mouth goes dry with my rapid breaths and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. 

“Fuck me, you can’t be fucking serious. What the fuck what the fuck what the fuck?”	I keep clicking through my computer’s files but turn around when I hear Bowman’s familiar tone, “Well that’s some harsh language you’re using Frankie. Is everything okay?”

I spin in my chair and see him standing at the entrance to my cubicle. The gray of my little enclosure’s walls bring out the bright pink of his cheeks and the burning redness of his tie. 

“Hey, Bill, no, things aren’t okay. I lost all the Exeter reports.”

“What do you mean you lost them?” he asked, “Didn’t you save them?”	“Of course I saved them Bill! I saved them like three times before I went to lunch! But they’re gone! My computer must have crashed while I was gone or something. The files have fucking vanished.”

“Whoa, whoa, take it easy there, Frankie. No need for the language. Look we need those by the —”

“End of the day, I know. But I don’t know how I can get that much work done by the end of the day. That was a whole week’s worth of work.” I rub my temples and I swear I can feel my brain pounding against my skull. The pressure builds directly behind my forehead and it spreads until it feels like my eyes are going to pop out of their sockets. 

“Well, Frankie bud, I can maybe see if we can get pushed, let me get on the line with Exeter and I’ll see what I can do. But you may have to stay late tonight.”

“Fuck me,” I mutter to myself. I’m supposed to take Sam out to dinner tonight to celebrate finishing up this project. I promised her I’d take her to the Italian place we usually save for our anniversary. We were going to share an order of tiramisu. 

I take out my phone and shoot her a quick text, “Going to have to stay late tonight, mind if we push dinner to tomorrow?” 

The three dots showing that she is typing appear on the screen and I begin holding my breath. I set my phone down on my desk and return to my computer, I reboot the thing and hope that will somehow pull the files out of limbo.

“Texting the Missus, Frankie?” I jump. I didn’t even register that Bowman was still there. 	

“Uh, yeah, yeah, letting my girlfriend know that I’ll be home late. Could you get in touch with Exeter, Bill? I’ll get back to work.”	

“You got it, Frankie, I’ll get right on it.” He walks away. He still has that mug of coffee in his hand. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever seen him without that mug and a bit of coffee in his mustache. I listen to his receding steps as he returns to his office. Once I hear him turn the corner and the sounds of his steps disappear, I take out my headphones and put on some music. 

My phone buzzes and a computer generated voice reads out Sam’s reply, “Yeah, tomorrow is fine, babes. Be careful on your way home, there’s supposed to be a pretty bad storm tonight heart emoji.” 

I type out a quick response, “I will be, love you,” and send it to her. I jump back into the work, recreating the files to the best of my ability. At this point I don’t care how good the work is, so long as it’s done. 

\~

The time ticks by; Bowman comes by at 4:44 to say that Exeter will accept the work so long as it is sent to them before the end of the calendar day — which means I have approximately seven hours to finish this or I risk losing my job. 

I take breaks to use the bathroom and buy a few energy drinks from the vending machine in the breakroom. I drain one in under an hour, but pace myself through the others so my hands aren’t shaking while I fill in the reports. By the time the end of the business day rolls around, I have tunnel vision to the point that when I look up the office has emptied out completely. I get up to look around and the only office with anyone left inside is Bowman’s. I check the clock and it is already five minutes to six. I pause my music for the time being and just start walking a lap around the perimeter of the place. I walk past the windows and see the storm clouds that Sam mentioned rolling in. They block out the orange-purple twilight and leave only a vast expanse of bluish gray. I catch a single lightning bolt in the distance and start counting to determine how far off it is. I only make it to two. 

I shake my head. There’s no way it was that close. It was on the horizon, nowhere near the building. But another strike fires off in the distance, and again the thunder follows almost immediately. 

“We’re in for a big one, huh?” 

I nearly jump through the window. “Jesus Christ, Bill, you scared the shit out of me.”	“Oh sorry about that Francis, how’s the Exeter report coming?” He’s holding another cup of coffee. That has to be at least his fourth cup today. I guess I can’t judge though, I’m one and a half energy drinks deep at this point and I’ll probably drink at least one more to get me through the night. 

“It’s good, I should be done in a couple of hours. I just needed to take a break.”

“Oh, I hear you, you gotta rest sometime. Thanks for working so hard on that, I’m sorry you had to cancel your dinner plans.” 

I stare at him and he looks at me quizzically. He raises his eyebrows at me and the wrinkles that appear on his forehead make it look like his receding hairline is frowning at me along with his mouth. 

“What is it bud?” he asks. 

“I just didn’t think I mentioned my dinner plans.”. 

“Oh yeah, you said it when I came by after lunch.”	

I shake my head again and look back out the window. “Must have forgot, it’s been a long day.” 

“That it has, Francis, that it has. If you need anything, I’ll be sticking around a while longer. I’ll be over in my office.”	

“Thanks, Bill. And thanks for remembering to call me Francis.”	

“Huh? Oh yeah, of course. I figured I should work on that.” He takes a sip of coffee, licks the remains from his mustache, and heads back to his office. 

The thunder continues rolling in, and suddenly the skies open up and it’s pouring rain. The windows are drenched in moments and I can barely make out the world outside the glass. All I see on the street are the lights of the various cars on their way home from whatever jobs they had been working. Their horns blend in with the sound of the thunder and rain forming a cacophony of rage both natural and man-made. Eventually I return to my cubicle and recommence my work. I can feel the crash from the energy drinks coming as I sit down, but I’ve at least finished filling in the dozens of cells in the spreadsheet and am onto the summarizing of all the data. With any luck, I should be home by eight and I’ll be able to at least treat Sam to some Chinese food and a shitty horror movie. I put my headphones back in and relaxed electronic beats fill my ears, blending perfectly with the patter of rain on the roof and windows. My eyelids become heavy as I continue typing. The screen blurs in my vision and the steady beat of the rain slows my heart down. I let my head slip backward and hang off the back of my chair. I take in a deep breath, and I shut my eyes. 

\~

When I wake up, the office is dark. The rain is hammering against the windows even harder than before, and the only light is from the occasional flash of lightning outside. I grab my phone to check the time, but it doesn’t turn. 

“Fuck me, what time is it?” I switch my computer on, and the tiny Big Bang bursts on the screen and nearly blinds me with its blue light. The clock on the screen reads 11:11. “What the hell? Why didn’t Bowman wake me up?” I mutter to myself. I tuck my phone into my pocket and move to go check on Bowman’s office. But before I do, I pull up the Exeter reports to make sure they’re still open and haven’t vanished into thin air again. When I open the files, initially everything looks fine, the summaries of the data are all there and everything looks the same as when I left it a few hours ago. If I really pushed I could probably finish up in an hour or two and I can probably figure out how to backdate the email when I send it over to Exeter. But as I continue scrolling through the document, the paragraphs of data summary vanish and are replaced by one phrase repeated over and over.

*We’re in for a big one, huh?*	

*We’re in for a big one, huh?*

*We’re in for a big one, huh?*

On and on it went, Bill Bowman’s voice echoing in my mind, the sound of him slurping his coffee bouncing inside my skull like a pinball. I clench my teeth and get up; I storm over to Bill’s office ready to scream at him for letting me fall asleep and not finish the reports in time. 

I get to his office and find it locked, but I can just make out his silhouette slumped over his desk. I slam my fist onto the door and start calling his name. “Bill! Bill! What the fuck man why didn’t you wake me up?” He remains asleep. He doesn’t even stir. The only sound in the office is the fading slams of my fist, the rain, and the thunder. I stand alone at Bowman’s office door heaving out breaths. I scan around the office and look to see if there are any other signs of life around me. The only light is coming from my cubicle. I walk back toward my space and try to remember where the lightswitch for the floor is. I run my hand along the wall searching for it, and eventually I find it. I flip it on and light fills the eleventh floor. But light isn’t the only thing that appears.

Suddenly there are people everywhere. They are in their cubicles, wandering to and from the breakroom, talking about their plans for Memorial Day Weekend as if it were still the middle of the work day. 

“Hey there, Francis, how are the Exeter reports going?” I jump forward almost an entire yard. “Whoa there, didn’t mean to startle you bud. You okay?”

I turn around and see Bill Bowman. “Hey Bill, they’re good. I should be done by the end of the day. Hey, what time is it?”

“Oh, it’s 11:11,” he chuckles, “make a wish, Francis! I wish it was lunch time already.” 

I let out the meekest laugh I can muster. “Thanks, Bill. Thanks. I should get back to work, I’ll let you know if I need anything.”

“Sounds good, Francis, we’re in for a big one tonight, huh?”

I turn back and stare at him. “What was that, Bill?”	

“The storm, we’re in for a big one!” he repeated. He licks the coffee from his mustache again, but it isn’t coffee. It’s clear water. He’s dripping wet. His shirt is clinging to his skin and I can make out the beater that he’s wearing underneath. His thinning blond hair is plastered to his head, and rivulets are running down his head and onto his face. The water drips into his coffee mug until it is overflowing and spilling onto the floor between. I lift my foot and hear the squelch of the wet carpet as my weight transfers to my other foot. But he just keeps sipping from his mug like nothing is happening. It spills past the rim and soaks his chin and neck. I spin and look around the office to see if anyone else notices what is happening, but everyone is continuing about their routines as if everything is normal. The wet smacks of feet on the soaked carpet get louder and louder as more people get up from their desks to move around. They all begin to converge on me, and like Bill, they are all soaked to the bone. 

“You all right there, Francis?” His voice is muffled, he is speaking to me through water. I turn to face Bowman and the water that was dripping from his body has turned from clear to a cloudy tan, as if he had just emerged from a muddy river. His hair flows downward with the wet,  and his head becomes as smooth as an egg; bits of his mustache drop into his coffee mug. The fingers around the mug’s handle sag and hang. The skin is loose and droops further and further until his fingers melt around the mug completely and he loses his grip. The mug clatters to the floor amongst the growing puddle of Bill. His worn down dress shoes and slacks drip into formlessness. I stare at my own hands to see that they are still intact. They are fine, but a drop of water falls onto them from the ceiling. I stare upward and the ceiling is gone. There is only a vast roiling cloud above me. A torrential downpour is released from above and I am completely drenched. I spin to look at all the other people from the office and see that they have all suffered the same fate as Bowman. Their faces have been washed away by either the rain or their sweat or whatever the water that initially appeared had been. One by one they all begin to collapse into puddles of soupy flesh. The liquid on the floor rises and the colors swirl as their clothes, skin, blood, and insides all conglomerate into a pool of whatever it is my colleagues were made of. I wade through the thickening sea that is my office and head directly for the elevator. I splash through the liquid that is now halfway up my calves. I make it to the elevator and slam the down button. Maybe if I can make it to my car, I can escape whatever the hell is happening here. 

The door of the elevator slides open and the liquid rushes in and I with it. I slam the button for the parking garage and hammer the close button at least a dozen times before the doors finally shut and my descent begins. I fumble in my pockets for my keys; I find them and bring them out, but they slip through my soaking fingers and fall into the muck around my feet. I dive down to grab them, but the pool in the elevator has turned completely opaque. It is just a swirl of dress shirt white, khaki, and deep, fleshy crimson. I feel along the floor of the elevator but cannot find the keys. My hand knocks against something, and I see Bowman’s mug floating next to my hand. 

Bubbles ripple around my arm, and I feel the vice-like grip of a hand grab me by the wrist and pull. I grab the elevator’s safety bar to keep myself above the surface, but the grip of whatever is holding on to me is strong enough that after only a few moments I feel my fingers begin to unwrap. I try to wrench my other hand free from whatever is grabbing it, but each time I pull it pulls me back twice as hard. I turn to look at my hand on the safety and watch as my fingers slip from around it. My hand burns and stings and I see trails of red where my fingers have been dragged away. The more my grip loosens, the worse the feeling that courses through my fingers becomes. The muscles of my arm are straining and my fingers are on fire as they melt away further. Finally, they give way completely, and I am pulled beneath the surface. I stare at my free hand and see that all that remains of my fingers are the final knuckles that are now trailing off and dissolving in the strange water around me. I can see the light of the elevator above and can even make out the floor numbers through the thick liquid that surrounds me. The surface of it is clear as day despite the opacity it had when I was above it. 

The elevator passes by floors eight, seven, and six, each number repeated three times as the light is refracted through the water: 888, 777, 666, 555. I turn around to face what pulled me down and see a body of clear flesh. It is almost like a jellyfish — its body is gelatinous and featureless, but unmistakably human. It pulls me deeper, moving hand over hand up my arm, tearing away my sleeve as if were merely wet paper and leaving red, oozing imprints wherever it releases its grip. My other arm continues to melt away into the vast sea around me and soon my sleeve floats emptily. Blood is pouring from my shoulder and a red cloud forms next to me, but I don’t even feel lightheaded. My chest is tight from the lack of breath to fill it, and I turn back to the creature as its right hand reaches up to touch my face. In its smooth, glass like face, I can see the floor number reflected in its refracted, distorted way. 

444.

The lights cut out from above and the creature and I plunge into darkness. I hear the grinding of metal above me and the sudden *clunk* of the elevator as it stops. The doors scrape open, screaming with the sounds of metal against metal as I see the liquid around me begin to flow outward through the door’s opening. The current pulls the creature and I upward and we spill together out onto the fourth floor. 

I gasp for air and get up onto my hand and knees. I can feel the warmth of my blood spilling from my shoulder, and my remaining arm burns in all the spots where the jellyfish man had grabbed me. I heave and groan through the pain as I force myself to my feet. I can’t see anything around me. There is only the sound of my breathing and the splashing of the water.

I feel a relentless vibrating in my pocket. I pull out my phone and the tiniest bit of light illuminates the floor. There is nothing around me. The jellyfish man is gone. All there is is myself, and the endless pool that I am knee deep in. 

I look at my phone screen and see that I have gotten over a dozen texts from Sam: each one is some variant on the same theme. She is frantically asking where I am, if I am okay, if I have left the office yet. I unlock my phone and call her. 

I put the phone to my ear and it rings. 

“Francis? Babes are you okay? Where are you?”

“Sam! Sam, Jesus Christ. Sam, I’m trying to leave the office but something is happening. I’m really hurt, I think I’ve lost a lot of blood.”	

“What? What is happening? Were you in a car accident?”	

“No, no I don’t know what’s going on. The office is flooded. I don’t even know where I am. I think I’m stuck on the fourth floor, there’s nothing else around. Everyone is gone.”

“Flooded? What do you mean? How could the water reach the fourth floor?”	“I don’t know! Just, check my location on your phone okay? And call an ambulance to come get me. They’ll have to find me somehow. I’ll shout and scream so they can hear me, hopefully.”

“Okay, okay, I’m checking it now — ” 

She falls silent. I stand waiting as I feel the warmth of my blood move past my waist and down my leg. 

"Sam? Babes?”

“Francis, it says you’re right outside the house.” 

“What? No, no I’m still in the office. Something must be wrong. That’s impossible.”	

“Babes, I don’t know what to tell you, my phone says your location is right outside. Let me go check.”	

I hear her footsteps through the phone and the sound of our stairs creaking beneath her feet. The sound of it echoes around me as if I really am at home. I swear I can hear her movement above me just like I did this morning. 

“I’m at the door right now —”

A rectangle of light appears in front of me, and I see a woman’s body backlit standing in its center. The phone falls from my hand and I hear it splash into the water. 

I stumble forward until I feel my feet bump against our front steps. I clamor up them and collapse into Sam’s arms.

“Francis, oh my god, what happened to you?”	

“Oh god, I love you so much, Sam. I’m so happy to see you.” I feel tears streaming down my face and disappearing amidst the drenched surface that is my face. They fall into my mouth as I begin to cry and I taste salt and iron. 

“Oh shit there’s so much blood. I’ll call 911!” I watch as she types the number into her phone and raises it up to her ear. “Hello, yes, my boyfriend needs an ambulance right away, he was in some kind of terrible accident. He’s lost his arm and a ton of blood.” She holds me closer and I shut my eyes and continue to weep into her shirt. 

“Thank you, I love you so much, Sam,” I heave out. 

“Yeah, tomorrow is fine, babes. Be careful on your way home, there’s supposed to be a pretty bad storm tonight heart emoji.” I stare up at Sam’s face. Her expression is blank and she is staring straight ahead. She opens her mouth, and the automated voice of my phone comes out again. “Yeah, tomorrow is fine, babes. Be careful on your way home, there’s supposed to be a pretty bad storm tonight heart emoji.” 

“Sam? Sam what’s going on?” I sit back up and feel her arm release from around me, and where it had been there is now a searing, burning pain. Water drips onto her forehead, and as the streams flow down her face, her features are melted away and all that is left is a clear, gelatinous surface. 

I fall backward and clamor back out the door, but the thing that used to be Sam follows. It crawls on its hands and knees after me. Each time a limb hits the ground there is a sickening wet sound. I fall backward down the stairs and into the pool behind me and momentarily fall beneath the surface again. I shoot back up as quickly as I can and rise to my feet so I can run. The jellyfish Sam crawls down the steps, and its joints seem to give out as it descends. It collapses into the dark water and vanishes. I run as fast as I can through the water, but with each step I sink deeper and deeper. 

I stop for a second and look down. I am chest deep now, but when I turn to look back at the open door, it is still sitting just above the water line. I reach down to feel my legs, but there is nothing there past my knees. I let out a scream at the dissolution of my body and flail as I try to keep my balance, but it is pointless. I tip over and fall beneath the surface. 

Once again the floor has vanished, but it is completely clear beneath, and illuminated despite the darkness that had surrounded me only a second ago. I use my remaining arm to spin my body and behind me I see that there is nothing remaining of Sam’s appearance on the creature, it is back to its original clear form. And it is swimming toward me. I scramble to try to swim away, but the remains of my limbs serve as poor propellers and I am overwhelmed in moments. The creature once again moves hand over hand up my body, leaving its prints in its wake to bleed and burn. Finally, it reaches my face. 

Both its hands clutch either side of my head and it pulls me in close. It presses its face to mine, and the spot where its mouth should be contours my own lips in an excruciating imitation of a kiss. I feel my lips dissolve into the creature’s face and its body fills with an expanding red cloud. It presses further and I can feel my teeth begin to vanish, then my tongue. My nose goes as well. It mercifully reaches my eyes a moment later, and everything goes dark. I can still feel its stinging, fiery touch on my cheeks but I can no longer watch as my body is stolen from me. But as the creature continues its encroachment, I feel less and less. Soon, I feel nothing at all. I revel in the nothingness, in the oblivion, and then there is nothing left of me to revel. 



\~



I am clear but I am not hollow. My limbs float freely around me. I feel no structure in my body. I am loose, wiggling slowly like a rag doll cast into the sea. Above me I can see the storm clouds distorted through the shifting surface of the sea that was once my coworkers. I can just barely make out Bowman’s mug still drifting on the waves of melted flesh and cloth. I try to move my left arm and it follows along accordingly. I move the right arm next, and begin pumping my tentacle-like legs and slowly push myself upward. 

As I get closer to the surface, I gain greater control over my new body. Soon I am able to easily move myself through the sea and in no time I feel my fingers burst through the surface. My head surfaces but I do not take in any air. I have no mouth or nose left to breathe. I continue kicking until I suddenly find firm ground beneath them. I struggle to keep my new form standing, but with focus I remain on my feet. I put one foot in front of the other, and slowly make my way across the empty expanse of the fourth floor. The darkness that I am steeped in betrays nothing of where I may be heading, but I keep moving. I reach out a hand in front of me as I walk, and after what seems like a mile of clumsy, barely supported steps, I feel my hand press against a wall. I run my hand down it, and I feel the metallic plate that holds the elevator button. There is only one. I press it, and as it lights up, it shows an arrow pointing upward. Light cracks through the darkness and I am standing just outside the elevator. I step inside. 

There are no buttons for the floors, the doors simply shut behind me and the elevator lurches upward. I stare at the numbers above the door, they still look as if they are being refracted through water. 

555.

666.

All the way up until 1111. 

The door opens, and I am standing at the threshold of my office. I step inside the room and I hear the thud of a shoe heel on a carpet. I look down at my body, and I am restored. I am once again standing in my black slacks and white button-down. I reach into my pocket and find my phone, it is nine on Saturday morning. 

“Look at you coming in on Saturday! And Memorial Day Weekend Saturday at that!” Bill Bowman is standing in front of me, his hands are empty. “How are you doing, Francis?”

“You always call me Frankie, Bill.” I stare at him, he is bone dry. He is wearing the same clothes he wore yesterday. His shirt is wrinkled as if it had been slept in, and his tie is loose. 

“Well you asked me to stop doing that, if I recall,” he says. He puts his hands in his pockets and looks me up and down. “Figured I should put in more effort with that, especially with how hard you’ve been working.”

“Right, thanks Bill. I appreciate it.” I step further into the office and head off toward my desk. When I get there, I turn my computer on and I watch that little explosion of light again. My background appears; it is a gif of jellyfish swimming through the ocean.

“Hey Bill, I think I left my house keys at home, I’m gonna go grab them if that’s alright?”

“Oh yeah, sure thing, Frank — Francis. Take your time. That report will be here when you get back.”	

“Thanks man, see you in a bit.” I get up and walk as fast as I can back to the elevator, doing my best to not break into a sprint. Once I get in the elevator, I take out my phone and look at my messages to Sam. The last one is the one I sent her Friday afternoon, telling her I was going to be home late. I type out a quick message to her.

Coming back home, want me to grab breakfast on the way? I do not wait to see if she answers.

When I reach the garage, I run to my car and jump inside. I pull out and nearly hit a cement barrier in my rush. I drive toward the exit and flick my turn signal. 

As I drive outside, it starts to rain.
