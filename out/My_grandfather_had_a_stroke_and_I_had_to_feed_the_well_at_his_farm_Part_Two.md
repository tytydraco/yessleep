For those of you who don't know, I've been living on my grandfather's farm after he had a stroke. If you haven't already read my first post, you can find it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iyrgm0/my_grandfather_had_a_stroke_and_i_had_to_feed_the/)

Sorry for taking so long to post an update, but running a farm is hard work. I've finally been able to head back in town where I can connect to the internet. I appreciate the advice I got in the comments for my last post as well. Some suggested just informing the neighbors of the situation and leaving. I actually considered it, but recently found out I can't. One of you suggested taking advantage of the well to profit it from it, but my grandfather already has optimized the farm for profit. This is with the exception of one person's suggestion to plant poppies on the farm. I don't think I want the DEA to raid my grandfather's farm, so I'm probably not going to grow illicit drugs. Anyways, it's been a rough couple days. I don't know entirely where to start, so I'll just jump into it.

I drove home from town after my last update. I spent as long as I could enjoying the small piece of civilization I still get to experience on occasion, and ended up driving home at night. Night time in the country is a different kind of dark compared to the cities. The only thing in the world is the little patch of reality carved out by your headlights and the sea of stars crowding the sky above. I had planned to get home, call Pearson, the coroner, and leave him a voicemail at his office explaining that I was leaving and someone else would have to feed the well. I would gather all my things, pack up my car and drive back to the city I called home in the morning. I would leave the ravenous hole in the ground for some other poor soul to enslave and escape back to a real life to live. I could probably get my job back at the warehouse pretty quickly and my mother had been kind enough to cover the rent on my one-bedroom apartment, so I knew there was a life to go back to. It may have been mediocre and even a little depressing at times, but it was nothing compared to being stranded on this island in a sea of corn. I felt like a shipwrecked sailor, looking out at the golden waves around me and wishing for a rescue that wouldn't come.

I pulled into the driveway after midnight, watching as the farm house materialized from the darkness. I couldn't see it in the night, but I knew the well was lying a short distance away down the path next to the house. I could feel its presence even if I couldn't see it. I could feel its indifference to the horror it had inflicted on three generations of my family now. I could feel it waiting for its next meal, patient and foreboding. Mostly, I could feel its hunger.

I did my best to not look in its direction as I climbed the wooded steps of the porch to go inside.

I walked in and was met with a wave of exhaustion. There are no days off on a farm and work starts early, so my night time foray into town had sapped every bit of the energy I had left. I went upstairs and didn't even bother changing before falling into bed. Sleep didn't take long to overtake me, but it was far from restful.

There's a question that has been eating at me since I first learned of my grandfather's secret in the well. He said that his father had negotiated with the thing and made a deal. I have yelled into that well quite a few times, but it had never spoken a word. I was left with the distinct impression that it couldn't form human words, so I wondered how my great-grandfather had communicated with it. That night, I got my answer.

I had the most horrifying dream I have ever had in my entire life.

It started with me looking up from a hole in the ground. I remember feeling so hungry that it *hurt.* I could hear movement around the top of the hole accompanied by human voices. I know now that I was hearing people, but in the dream, I didn't think of them as people. In my dream, my mind told me that it was food above me, not people. I could feel the need to fill my stomach gnawing in my guts, salivating as the food crept closer. I saw a figure in the sunlight shining above me, and suddenly, I was bursting through the surrounding ground, my oversized mouth closing around the man above me. I noticed in the split second before I snatched him up that he was a Native American, then heard him screaming as my teeth ground wriggling flesh and snapped bones. I could feel the warm blood bursting from the body as the screaming stopped, could feel it mixing with the chewed flesh as I greedily swallowed. Then, I was back in the hole, looking up.

This time, it was different. An old man came and stood over the lip of the hole, chanting with outstretched arms in a perfect tableau of worship. While the words should have been foreign to my ears, in the dream, I understood them in an instinctual way. There was one word that stood out though. I learned the thing's name.

“Atahsaia, we ask you to accept this offering in return for your blessing. We are your humble servants, and you, our magnanimous master. We feed you, Atahsaia, and in return, you feed us.”

With that, the old man withdrew from the edge, stepping backwards. A young woman came forward, calmly standing above me. She held her arms outstretched as the old man had, then let herself fall forward. Again came the sensation of flesh and bone being broken as wet crunching filled my ears, echoing all around me in the confines of my subterranean dwelling. Over it, I could hear the old man speaking again.

“Praise Atahsaia! He is the well of life! We feed the well and the well feeds us!”

The next scene to come to me was the most surreal of all. I saw a young man in a field who looked eerily similar to me. He was digging, alternating between a shovel and pick-axe. He kept looking over his shoulder in my direction as he worked, a worried expression on his familiar face.

I looked over to the farm house nearby, its fresh-cut wooden planks instantly recognizable to me. It was the farm I currently inhabited. There, on the porch, was a young woman holding an infant child in her arms. I realized I was looking at my great-grandmother, my grandfather sleeping in her arms.

When I looked back at the young man, he was stacking stones in a ring around the boundary of the hole he had dug. As he placed the last one, he looked at me.

“So, that's it then. You stay there and restrict yourself to human meat once a year, and I'll see to it that you never go hungry. My descendants will keep this covenant as well. My child and my child's child and so on shall uphold it until the end of time. In return, you bless our crops and cease hunting us. That's the deal. We feed the well, and the well feeds us.”

Then, I was looking up from the well, an abnormally large moon shining down the ring of stones above. A bright moon. A harvest moon. I saw the young face of my grandfather look down it, a grim expression fixed on his features. That's when I heard the screams.

A man in chains was led to the edge, three men forcing him over the stone barrier as he cried out.

“No! Please! I don't want to die! This is inhuman!”

In response, one of the young men wrestling with him punched him in the back of the head hard enough to cause the man to start bleeding, scarlet rivulets dripping down his neck. The man who had hit him was dressed as a police officer. He held the man by the collar of his shirt and pushed him until he was staring me in the eyes.

“Please! Please don't do this!” the man continued to beg.

A short second later, he was tumbling towards me, eyes widened with fear as he screamed.

When I awoke, I could still taste the man's flesh in my mouth, could still feel his blood gushing from his body with every crushing bite. My ears could still hear the wet crunch as well, but beneath it, a voice that sounded like a cross between the crackling of a fire and stone grinding on stone spoke very low.

“Uphold the covenant.”

The first thing I did was jump out of bed and run to the bathroom to vomit. The flavor of human flesh was still fresh in my mouth, a foul taste of copper and raw meat. I heaved over the toilet for twenty minutes, my stomach aching as it emptied its contents. I half expected to see bits of flesh with bones jutting up through them when I looked in the toilet to flush, but thankfully, it was just the half-digested remains of last night's dinner.

I rinsed my mouth out, then stared in the mirror. The man looking back had dark rings under his eyes and a tired expression. It was still my face, but I could see the pain and horror of my experience etched into every line of it. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, trying not to remember the voice I had heard as I had awoke and failing. The voice of Atahsaia. The voice of the well.

I tried not to think about it as I began the daily chores of running a farm. I spread fertilizer over fields, fed cattle, sprayed insecticide. The whole time, a deep feeling of dread spread through me. I knew it was down there, lying in wait beneath my feet, its hunger growing. I tried avoiding the well all day, taking care to walk widely around it as I passed. I couldn't help but envision an enormous arm reaching out from it and grabbing me as I screamed, pulling me into its unfathomable depths to become nothing more than another meal. The covenant my great-grandfather had made with the thing seemed a flimsy protection from such a creature.

Inevitably, the time came for me to feed it. As I tossed the hunk of beef into the pit, I quickly plugged my ears with my fingers to avoid hearing the sound of meat and bone being snapped and chewed. Regardless, the sound still reached me and made me feel nauseous.

I turned towards the house, walking away from the well as quickly as possible and trying not to get sick again. This time, I succeeded, but immediately felt ill in a completely different way when I got to the end of the path leading from the well. A car was parked alongside my own and my brother, Daniel, was standing beside it.

It's not that I didn't love Daniel. After all, he was my brother. We had grown up together, shared a childhood together. It's just that as his life went one way, mine went another. He was successful, which I hated to say, made me more than a little envious. At my age, I didn't have a girlfriend, much less, a wife. I didn't have a job with great prospects, just my little forklift gig, which I was now fired from. While he had a wife, a great job and money, all I had was this farm that I desperately wanted to leave. While he had a life, I had the well.

“Hey, Chester,” he said to me when I approached. “I'm sorry I took so long to get here.”

“What are you doing here?” I asked him, a little more harshly than I intended to.

“Well, I came to check on you...” he responded, unconvincingly.

“I'm fine. Thanks for coming.”

“Chester, there's no need to be hostile. I just wanted to pay my respects to Grandpa Silas.”

More like pick over the farm for anything of value before attempting to sell it, I thought.

“His funeral isn't for a few more days,” I said coldly. “There's a hotel in town you can stay in.”

“Why wouldn't I stay here?” he shot back with some indignation in his voice.

“There's no wifi or cell service out here. If you really want to sleep here, you can, but it's pretty boring.”

“That's fine. I'll take the guest bedroom. After all, I want to be present when we start trying to sell the place.”

“We're not selling the farm,” I replied.

“This place is half mine, Ches. I know you can't buy me out, so I'm selling it. We can split the money after.”

I took a deep breath. After all, this was my brother. Maybe I could trust him.

“You don't understand, there's something going on here. We can't just sell this place.”

“Yea, what's going on?” he asked harshly.

“There's something in the well.”

“What? Have you lost your mind?” he responded with a look of derision.

“I know it sounds crazy,” I explained, “but there's something down there. Something evil. Grandpa Silas told me to feed it.”

I spent the next hour sitting at the kitchen table with him explaining everything that had happened. I even showed him our great-grandfather's journal, hoping he'd understand the grave situation we were in, but instead, he responded with incredulity.

“Chester, you've either lost your mind, or this is some stupid hoax to cheat me out of my half of the farm.”

“Damn it, Danny, how do you explain the journal!”

His face changed into one of genuine concern.

“You clearly wrote it. I'm worried about you, Chester. If you really believe this, you need help. Let's just go see mom.”

“You don't believe me? Fine, come with me.”

I led him from the house, stopping in the cellar to grab a hunk of meat, and headed for the well. Once we stood before it, I tossed it in and waited for the crunch of Atahsaia feeding to ring out from it, but it never came.

“I'm calling someone, Chester. You need help.”

“I'm telling you, it's down there! If you get me committed, it'll get loose and kill everyone around here!”

Danny pulled out his phone, which I slapped out of his hand. He responded by giving me a hard shove.

“Knock it off, Chester. I don't know if you're just crazy or trying to fool me, but we're selling the place and splitting the money. It's time to accept it.”

“You're going to get people killed, Danny! I'm not going to sell it!” I screamed.

“Fine, you've given me enough here to have you committed anyways. Once I sell it, I'll send you your half of the money. It's time to stop playing farmer and go home, Ches!”

He bent down to pick up the phone that had dropped to the ground, so I shoved him away from it. He managed to keep his feet and responded by punching me in the face.

“Stop it, Danny! You don't understand what's down there!”

Daniel hit me again, so I kicked him in the leg. After that, we were on one another, punching and hitting each other repeatedly. This culminated in Daniel catching my chin with a strong swing that left me sprawling on the ground, the world dimming and swirling as I tried to regain my senses. Through my blurred vision, I watched him pick up his cell phone and turn back towards me.

“You're scaring me, Chester! I'm calling the police! Maybe jail will be better than an asylum anyways!”

I could taste blood in my mouth, reminding me of the dream I had last night. I spat the blood onto the dirt and rolled to my side. Danny was unlocking his phone and dialing what I knew was 911. With a gasp of effort I pushed myself into a sitting position. If Danny made that call, I'd go to jail and the thing in the well would be free to renew its hunting. People would die.

I forced myself onto my feet and charged at Danny, tackling him hard enough to take us both off our feet. We both landed hard on the ground, but I was dazed and Danny wasn't. He hammered me with blows, managing to roll us over and get on top of me. He struck down hard enough for me to feel my cheek split and begin bleeding.

“Fuck you, Chester! I ought to throw you down that damn well for this shit!”

He stood up, yanking me to my feet and dragging me to the edge of the well.

“I don't see anything down there, do you?!” he cried out, forcing me to bend over the stone barrier and peer into the inky depths below.

“Danny, stop!” I managed to choke out.

“In a few minutes, I'll get the cops here and you're going to jail. Then, I'm going to sell this damn place and go home! I don't know what kind of help you need, but you better pull it the hell together!”

He pushed me a little lower, my feet leaving the ground as I gripped the stones I was now balanced on.

“Do you see anything down there yet?! Are you ready to get a grip yet?”

I felt a surge of anger and frustration shoot through me as I spun around and punched Danny in the face as hard as I could. As he stumbled back, my feet found the ground again. I grabbed him by the shoulders and spun him around, shoving him into the stone wall of the well as hard as I could. I hadn't really thought about it, just knowing there was an object there that I could drive him into to stun him. However, as he made contact with the well, I watched in horror as he tumbled over the side. I ran forward, intending to help him but already knowing it was too late. As I reached the edge and peered down the hole, I was just in time to hear it.

A loud, wet crunch.

Then another.

I stumbled back and fell to the ground, tears streaming down my face as another rang out.

“No...” I said in disbelief.

I sat there for a long time as the chewing subsided and the air was filled with the sound of wind whispering over crops and insects buzzing lazily. I buried my bruised face in my hands and sobbed, overcome with guilt. I didn't care that Danny had attacked me, he was my brother. He had every reason to think I had lost my mind. Hell, I had wondered the same thing hundreds of times since coming here.

“Why couldn't you just listen to me!” I screamed, though the person it was intended for was now incapable of hearing me.

I finally stood up, walking over to where he had dropped the phone on the ground and picked it up. I could see that it was attempting to dial out to emergency services, the number on the screen showing “911.” I put it to my ear, hearing the busy signal and remembered there was no cell service in this area. I pocketed the phone as I was overcome with a fresh wave of grief and realized my brother had died for nothing.

I walked back to the house, noting Danny's car still parked next to mind. I felt cold and numb at this point, not fully accepting what I had done. I sat down on the porch and stared at the sun as it began to set and paint the world in its gold and rose hues. Finally, I made the decision I hadn't even realized I was considering.

I knew the well had to be fed, but I was done. In that moment, I had finally reached what was my breaking point and decided someone besides me would have to figure out what to do. The whole town could get swallowed up for all I cared. I couldn't keep living with the fact that I had killed my one and only brother.

I walked inside the house and picked up the old, corded phone fixed to the wall in the kitchen and dialed out to 911. I asked to speak to the police and, after a short pause, was connected to a gruff male voice.

“You said you have a crime to report?”

“Yes... I would like to report a murder.”

There was a pause and a sharp intake of breath. I swallowed hard, the fear and finality of what I was about to do hitting home. I almost hung up the phone, but thought of my brother going over the side of the well. I realized that thought would repeat in my mind until the day I died. I pushed on.

“Hello, are you still there?” I asked.

“Um, yea. Okay, can I have your address?”

I gave him the exact address and when I was done, I added, “I killed my brother.”

“Please remain where you are,” the voice responded in a terse tone.

I didn't have to wait long. In less than fifteen minutes, I could hear cars pulling up outside the house, so I went outside to meet them. I exited with my hands above my head, expecting drawn guns and loud commands, but none of that came. Instead, they were just getting out of their vehicles. I decided to say something to get their attention.

“Don't worry,” I called out to the four police officers, who just calmly meandered from their cars at a slow pace to stand in front of the farm house. “I plan to come quietly.”

Two of the police stared at me from a distance, while the other two leaned close to one another and held some whispered conversation. Then, they parted and one of them walked to me.

“Okay, Chester, let's go inside for a little talk.”

I didn't know how to these things normally go, but the last thing I had expected was for a conversation at the kitchen table. I took a seat as the officer sat down across from me where my brother had been sitting a few hours earlier when he was alive. The police officer had short, black hair and piercing eyes. He was maybe in his mid thirties or late twenties. He stared at me for a few seconds before speaking.

“So, you're saying you killed your brother?”

“Yes sir. It was an accident. I shoved him near the well out back and he fell over the side.”

“I see...”

“I would like to turn myself in,” I added.

“Listen, Chester, I understand that you're worried about your brother, but going to jail won't bring him back,” the officer said sympathetically.

“What do you mean? I killed a man. I killed my brother! I have to face justice. Just be sure to feed the well while I'm locked up. I know that sounds weird, but-”

The officer cut me off.

“Chester, your brother went missing. His wife will be getting a note tomorrow stating that he has decided to leave the country. I know you miss him, but doing this won't bring him back.”

I suddenly felt all the blood drain from my face.

“What are you talking about? I killed him! Take me to jail!”

“Don't worry, Chester. We'll try to find him, but with these things... who knows?”

The officer stood up, just as I heard wheels on the gravel road outside. I followed the officer to the door, berating him the whole way.

“This is insane! I killed him! I killed him!”

“Chester, if you did that, there'd be a body,” he responded in an even voice as he opened up the front door and went outside.

I followed him out the door, ready to continue protesting, but fell silent when I walked onto the porch. I could see a tow truck just starting to turn the corner of the road in the distance, my brother's car being pulled behind it.

“We'll keep looking, Chester,” the officer said, walking back down the porch steps towards his car. “In the meantime, get some rest and try not to worry. Oh, and don't forget...”

He turned around and looked me in the eyes, one hand on the door of his car. He had an angry look on his face, full of threats unsaid. He didn't need to say them. The way he gripped the gun strapped to his side with his other hand said everything he needed to convey.”

“Feed the well, and the well feeds us.”

The message was clear. They knew about Danny's wife. They likely knew about my mother. I wouldn't be the one suffering if I didn't do what was expected from me.

After that, the two squad cars began to drive away. I sat down on the steps of the porch as the sun completely vanished behind the horizon and the deep night of the rural countryside fell over the land.

I didn't even know how to fathom what had just happened. I understood it in an analytical sense, but I just couldn't comprehend that it had really happened. Danny was gone and I couldn't even be punished it for it.

If I had felt trapped before, it was nothing compared to the sensation that now overwhelmed me. I wondered if the rest of my life would be spent here on this farm, yearning for the city lights of my old life, yearning to face justice for killing my own brother, a slave to Atahsaia. A servant of the well.

In some ways, maybe that's what I deserved. Killing my brother was an accident, but I felt a need to be punished for it. I had originally intended to spend the rest of my life inside a prison cell to atone for it, but I suppose this farm isn't entirely dissimilar.

I reached in my pocket, pulling out Danny's phone and hit the button on the side of the device. The phone lit up, and I could see his lock-screen. It was a picture of the both of us as kids, here on the farm. I remembered that picture; My mom had taken it while Danny and I were running around and playing in front of the corn field. We were both smiling with an arm around each other. We couldn't have been older than eight and nine. I buried my head in my arms and sobbed.

I decided I'd keep his phone, making a point to look at the picture on it every day, never letting myself forget what I had done. To rub salt in this wound, I could see that his wife had texted him just a little while earlier.

“Miss you, honey.”

I knew she'd never receive a response. She'd get a note tomorrow. Maybe she would hold out hope for a little while, but one day, she'd accept that he was never coming home. At least she'd persist with the lie that he was still alive somewhere. The same goes for my mother. Only I would know the truth, a truth I would have to carry alone.

I looked at the picture on his phone again, realizing that Daniel had loved me and cared about me, even if he had been unable to express it. That picture was all the proof I needed to see. Looking at it now, I can feel my chest growing heavy with anguish and my eyes stinging with the force of holding back tears.

I miss my little brother.
