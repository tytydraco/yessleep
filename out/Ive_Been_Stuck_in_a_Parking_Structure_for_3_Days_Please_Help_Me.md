Hi there. If you’re reading this, I really could use your help. As you’ve probably gathered from the header, I’m stuck in a parking structure, like the ones you find at a mall or a college. I know it sounds strange, they have exit signs and they're not exactly complicated structures, but this is different. It’s difficult to tell how much time has passed, but my phone says it’s February 2nd. That means I’ve been in here for almost 3 days now. 

3 days ago, on the 30th, I had a very important interview. I work for a fairly prestigious tech company, and the position I’m going for would almost triple my salary. Not surprisingly, I was incredibly nervous and anxious about it. I’m great at my job, but I’m terrible at speaking. This wouldn’t be the first interview I’ve blown just by coming off as weird or awkward. For weeks, ever since I found out about this opportunity, it took up all the space in my mind. I started having nightmares about it which created a sort of self-perpetuating loop: I worried the interview would go poorly which stopped me from sleeping well which made my performance at work worse which made me worry more about the interview. It got pretty bad, honestly.

But the night before the interview, the night of the 29th, I didn’t have a nightmare. I mean I thought it was a nightmare at first, it looked just like the other nightmares I had been having. But it was different. In the dream, I was in an ornate office, one that clearly belonged to someone important. I was sitting in a comfortable chair in front of an intimidating desk made of dark, polished wood. At the desk sat a middle aged man with a wide grin. He looked just like any business professional you would imagine, save the air of hunger laced in both his gaze and his smile. I could see out the window of the room, but there was nothing outside. Not as in there was nothing interesting or it was mundane. I mean outside of the room was nothing, just darkness.

You see, I had similar dreams before. Normally, at this point, the man, who I knew to be someone important in my dream, would tell me I’m fired or I didn't get the job, something along those lines. But for a long time, he just looked at me. I felt words form in my throat; nervous, rambling explanations of why he should hire me, but he cut me off before they left my mouth.

“Do you want to succeed?”

His voice was odd, it shifted pitches and tones seemingly at random. It sounded like every word he spoke was an impression of a different person. His mouth was strange too. It moved far more than it should have. When it opened to speak, his jaw moved too far, his lips were too animated. Still, I couldn’t handle the anxiety I’d been experiencing anymore so I told him the truth,

“Yes.”

His grin grew wider and his pupils narrowed into thin slits. He spoke again,

“Are you willing to be tested?”

I had no idea what he meant. But like I said, I’m great at my job. I knew I could handle whatever test he had for me. So again I said, 

“Yes, I am.”

Without another word he extended a hand out to me, which I then shook, my arm moving without me willing it to. As soon as I did, I woke up in my bed at 6am. I felt great, like I had slept for a full 8 hours when in reality, I hadn't gone to bed until around 3am. My morning routine went as smoothly as usual; I showered, got dressed, ate breakfast, and got in my car to drive to the interview. It was uncharacteristic of me, but the anxiety from the weeks prior had evaporated, leaving me with a sense of confidence and excitement. I could do this, I knew it for a fact.

There was no traffic that morning and I got to my interview early. I pulled into the 4 story parking structure and grabbed a spot right by the entrance. I practically skipped to the waiting area outside of the office, and they called me in almost immediately. 

The interview went amazing. I spoke with a confidence I’ve never had before. I had an answer for every question, and I could tell I was impressing my interviewer. It did feel a bit weird when I spoke, my mouth moved in a way that wasn’t entirely familiar to me. But it hasn't happened since, so I’m not terribly worried, at least not about that.

I’m happy to say I got the job on the spot. I’m actually meant to start tomorrow, on the 3rd. So if anyone has any ideas on how to help me with the problem I’m about to describe, please let me know quickly. As soon as I shook my new boss’s hand, a chill ran through me. My confidence left me and I could feel my knees buckling like they usually do in high pressure situations. But I didn’t let that bother me, if anything, it gave me a feeling of triumph, like I was gloating. I had cheated my nerves and now it was too late for them to ruin this for me. 

I was ready to go home and relax for the first time in weeks. I got in my car with a smile on my face and backed out of my parking spot not yet noticing how dark it had gotten outside. I had parked on the 4th floor. The building connects directly to the parking structure and this was the nearest spot to where my interview had been. Honestly, it was a small miracle that the spot hadn’t been taken earlier.

A started my drive, following the exit signs that pointed me left and then down, then left and down again. This kept on for 20 minutes. I stopped the car for a bit to gather myself. My line of thinking was that I had been numb to my nerves earlier and they were catching up to me now. I figured I would park again and wait for someone to leave the building so I could either ask for directions or just follow them out. But no one came. An hour went by, then 2, then 3. 

At this point I had had enough, so I got out of my car. Rows and rows of cars lay ahead of me. Behind me were both the ways up and down. The air felt incredibly humid and heavy, almost foggy. There was a sign on the wall labeled, “FLOOR -12”. I stared at it for a while, not sure if this was a joke or if someone had made a mistake. 

I figured I had been driving down for a while so I’d walk back up a floor or 2 just to see if maybe I could find someone. As I did, I could hear scraping coming from somewhere above me. The noise echoed down the concrete halls. I called out nervously,

“Hello?”

The word bounced off the walls and floors as it ascended the parking complex. The scraping stopped, and the world went dead silent for a singular moment that lasted an eternity. Then, the air was filled with the most bone-chilling scream I had ever heard. Footsteps rang out loudly from above. They were headed towards the ramp leading to the next floor- to me. 

I don’t know who or what that was, but I had no interest in finding out. So I ran to my car and pulled out of the parking spot, nearly flooring the gas pedal as I resumed my descent. In my mirror, I saw it. A huge, spindly, pale grey humanoid thing, chasing after me with lopsided strides. The best word I can describe it with is crooked- it’s limbs twisted and curved like gnarled tree roots.

I am not exaggerating when I tell you that I watched this monster in my rear view mirror pick up a sedan and throw it at my car. Luckily it missed and the sedan smashed into a support column to my left. I drove as fast as I could without flipping my car on the sharp turns until I felt comfortable enough to slow down. It must’ve been 50 floors lower than where I started. I followed the signs that still somehow read, “EXIT” in glowing red letters. And so, down I went, hoping that I would find the exit at some point. I can’t turn around, not knowing that thing is somewhere back there. 

And that has been the last 3 days for me; driving deeper and deeper into this never ending cage. I keep a case of water bottles in my trunk and I have trail mix and beef jerky to last me a while, but I really am starting to panic. I have a charger for my phone that I’m using to type this out. But what happens when I run out of gas? I won’t be able to charge my phone and worse, I’ll be stuck outside and moving much slower. I shudder at the idea of that thing catching up to me. 

Some of you may be asking, “Why not just get out of the car and go over the side of the parking structure?”

I already tried that. Just like in my dream, there is nothing outside of this place, only inky blackness. All I can see looking either up or down are endless levels of the same parking structure. 

I also want to note that, until floor -302, the parking spots had all been chalk full of other cars. But now I only see 1 or 2 occasionally. Things are getting worse and I’m starting to think I’m not the first person this has happened to. I drove by a dark green Jeep Wrangler the other day with a massive hole through the windshield. Shattered glass and stale blood littered the inside. The door hung open and a trail of dry blood led away from the car, trailing off towards the edge of the floor- towards the darkness. 

I can’t tell if the non stop driving is getting to me, or if I’m losing my mind, but I keep seeing things. As I’m driving, I'll occasionally see a figure peeking out from behind a corner or a column in the edge of my vision. But when I turn to look, there’s nothing there. I hear noises occasionally, too. Not the scraping, usually. But sobbing. I can hear faint sobs echoing through this place but I can’t tell if they’re coming from above or below me. Even the air in here acts strangely, changing rapidly from cold to hot. The air conditioning in my car has helped with this but again, what happens when I run out of gas?

So, as you can see, I’m in a bit of a conundrum currently. I’m trying my best to stay optimistic, but it's difficult and I feel like I’m at the end of my rope. My low fuel light came on not long ago, and I’m freaking out a little. 

If you’re reading this, could you please help?
