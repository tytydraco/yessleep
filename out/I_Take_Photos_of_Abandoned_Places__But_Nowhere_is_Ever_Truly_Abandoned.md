It's been a long time since I tried to tell this story. Every time I've tried, it's cost me. I'm tired. I just want to be heard. To think, as I stare down the barrel of maybe once getting through it all, that this started because I found a camera.

The first time I got into photography was at eight years old. I stumbled upon my mom's Pentax K1000 35mm film Camera. For months, for every store we went into, I wanted to know if they had film and if my parents would buy me more. The fixation eventually passed, its place filled with some other creative outlet.

The second time I got into photography was at twenty-four years old. I had been laid off and, after six months of floundering, ended up moving back in with my parents. While putting some excess boxes of cutlery and kitchenware into the attic, I stumbled upon my mom's Pentax K1000 35mm film Camera. Amid a spiraling depression, it became a sliver of joy. That camera became my excuse to leave the house. I was back in my hometown of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, about three hours north of Nowhere and six hours from the life I had spent building since I moved away at eighteen.

Wilkes-Barre is an economically and metaphorically depressed town wedged among similar towns. Based on what I learned as a kid, the area had collapsed when the coal mining industry left it behind. It's the type of place where everyone knew everyone, but most people wouldn't travel more than three blocks from where they lived. Asking someone to travel twenty minutes over for a show was treated like asking them to take a sabbatical to walk the Alps. I establish that only because what I remember the most from that transition was how incredibly lonely I was. I also wanted to set the stage for just how barren the area was. Wilkes-Barre is characterized by blocks of old and unused structures, many linked to old industries that left decades before my family moved there.

This is the environment where my love of the unnerving and the weird met my nascent creativity with a camera. It was a pretty short walk from using my camera for rudimentary urban pictures to sneaking into unoccupied buildings to engage with illicit abandoned photography.

I can still recall the first time I knowingly and with forethought entered through a broken window. I know for many people that's pretty tame, but for well-behaved, good grades, rarely out past curfew me, it was a pretty big deal.

A block over from the square that is charitably called Wilkes-Barre's Downtown Area is the bloated corpse of an old train station. Atlas Obscura \[[1](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wilkes-barre-abandoned-train-station)\] indicates that the station started operations in 1868 and was initially closed in 1972. But that's not how I remember it.

At some point in the early 2000s, the station and a few old rail cars were retrofitted into a kitschy club called Banana Joe's. This still isn't how I remember it. Near as I can tell, the club only lasted a few years. Their website \[[2](https://bananajoes.tripod.com/)\] (still up for some reason) still has events listed for Friday, May 21st. With that, my best guess is the club closed sometime in 2004. By the time my family moved there, sometime in '06, the club was long gone.

The clump of train cars around the old station tower, with exposed and broken machinations is what I remember. This was the first time I knowingly ventured into somewhere I explicitly knew I shouldn't be just for the sake of photography.

It started as a simple afternoon driving around the area, occasionally stopping to take a few pictures. I recall it being early spring, the occasional breeze justifying carrying around a windbreaker. I eventually stopped at the abandoned Banana Joe's. While poking around the exterior, I became aware of a pseudo courtyard, a natural alcove created by the position of train cars around the station. The stump of a dead tree was surrounded by detritus and the type of crawling bush that always seems to be drawn to the trash left behind by civilization.

[Image: RailCarCourtyard](https://64.media.tumblr.com/de30b82e2f07231bcf37f071a988223a/688cbf98e9cda711-9d/s640x960/9286c8d4301275fbd85678e1fb44b59363bdafb1.pnj)

While getting my shot of the narrow scene, I found an entrance that undoubtedly many had before. One of the windows had been entirely broken out, no glass left in or around the frame. It was also easy to access, with a locked train wheel providing plenty of footing. For an instant, I stood in front of the window before my skin crawled. With nerves alight, I left the copse as quickly as I could while still trying to remain casual.

I have found a lot of people won't pay you mind if you look like you're supposed to be there. At least, most people didn't seem to pay me mind.

That's where my first excursion ended, but the gears had already started turning. I had glimpsed an interior that was decrepit and colorful. It was alluring in the way most bad decisions are. The suggestion to return and casually lift myself through the window sat in the back of my mind for weeks. 

It took a few outings where all I brought home was disappointment (more than the usual amount I carried, anyway.) 

Nan Goldin once said, "Getting a good picture is like diving for pearls. You take a thousand pictures to get a good one." I've come to conclude that this isn't universal. Maybe for an accomplished Photographer, that's what it feels like, but for most, you can dive till you drown and never find a pearl simply because you aren't talented enough to form one. I was frustrated; my subject matter wasn't engaging enough. I was settling for still lifes of a life no one would slow down to appreciate even if they could afford to. I needed something unique, something most people couldn't see from their car windows.

It was time to truly entertain the idea of "breaking" into the vacant husk formerly known as Banana Joe's.

Over the next few days, I prepared. I purchased five fresh rolls of film, which exhausted the local Corner Store/Pharmacy's stock. I took apart my Pentax and cleaned it thoroughly. I felt like I needed to be prepared. If only I understood what I needed to prepare. I misinterpreted the jitters that snuck up on me every few hours as excitement. I shrugged off my anxieties as the resistance of a "good kid." There was little besides the approaching rainstorm that could change my plans. When I woke up to driving sheets of precipitation, I briefly considered leveraging their overtly spooky trope but eventually thought better of it. If my camera or the film got soaked, the expedition would be worthless. So, I waited two days for the weather to clear up.

The day finally arrived. It was muggy, intermittently cloudy, and surprisingly warm. Even just walking down the long path to my car, my clothes began to cling to me. It wasn't a pleasant sensation, but it was one I was willing to ignore. I had tacitly promised myself that this trip would prove I had an eye and could take quality pictures.

Unaccustomed to breaking the rules, I became overly cautious. Sure, I was comfortable bending rules or following their spirit rather than letter, but this time, I was knowingly and willingly outright breaking a bylaw of the community. 'No Trespassing' signs had been evident at every corner on my first visit and had done enough to keep me out of the unwelcoming maw of dilapidation, but this time I would not be swayed.

I drove around the block once, making sure there were no cops loitering in the lot or stopped in the burger joint's parking lot at the end of the street. I needed to be sure there would be no one who knew better witnessing my transgression. Of course, there was no one to worry about. As I made the first of my planned right turns around the block, I swore I wouldn't go through with my plan if even one thing was out of place. I was promising myself to be safe as much as I was looking for an excuse to bail. The second right came, and I became painfully aware how suffocatingly thick the air was even in my car with the AC up; maybe it wasn't a good idea to be active for too long on such a day. I pushed the trepidation aside; I had a plan that needed to be followed. I could prove to be good at something. For a change, I could validate all my chaotic creative impulses. The final right turn passed without incident, and once more, from around another set of unused structures, the relic of the old New Jersey's CNJ station reemerged. I parked across the street near what I thought was a hair salon. I never studied the business closely enough to be sure.

My walk was slowed by how thick my skin felt. I became sticky with sweat in minutes, before I even made it across the street. My tee and loose button-up gained a suppressing presence around my chest. The strap for my bag became more garrote than support. I had struggled enough with bloody feet from dance to know my slippery socks were not fit for prolonged use. It seemed I would have to exchange momentary discomfort for something that would make me feel worth.

Damp and short of breath, I found myself at a corner of the building I hadn't given attention to my last visit. At first I thought maybe there'd be an easier entrance than the window around the other side and tucked into the (accidental) courtyard. Nails guarding the handle indicated that the door had been secured from the other side.

[Image: DoorNailedShut](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a92a4c957c5be62da976ae7f97112afe/9851d78c51bfc874-00/s640x960/8d0ed82dd8d748d92d5b714f43a231c97af74bd6.pnj)

So Plan A it was. Plan A was more reliable anyway; it was a concealed entrance where my (ever so tame) crime could go unnoticed. Entry was as easy as I anticipated. The window was large enough for me to fit through without taking my bag off.

I took a moment to appreciate my first steps beyond the threshold. The room ran away to the shadows. Vague shapes started to form a map in my mind. I was on a raised walkway, overlooking what I guessed was a dance floor -beyond it was a stage. Off to the left, the pathway opened up to an area where I could picture people gathering around the boxy half-wall I assumed was once a bar. Near me was a set of collapsed stairs where my path lead to the dance floor. They would prove easy enough to bounce over using the few stable element left.

With all the pretentious care befitting my aspirations, I retrieved my camera. The lens cap came off. I double-checked the Frame # Counter and the Shutter Speed. I had to drop the speed and remind myself to remain still while taking photos. The film I had gotten was 200 ISO, great for clearly lit areas but not ideal for the dank ruins I found myself in. It was what I had access to, though, so I had to make do. I began snapping up images of the detritus of the buildings run as a nightclub. It was the type of things you'd expect: flyers, plastic cups, cheap beads, even a cash register.

[Image: AbandonedClubInsideCollection](https://64.media.tumblr.com/71531eb6bd6cc3f4014883934cf94cec/cfcda6843efdc2c7-02/s640x960/1dc613d141816a73cf2b3f951edd87fdb06ef318.pnj)

I was surprised at how wet the building was. It was a wet soaked so deep in the bones you could smell it. It was the sourly-sweet type of decay one could breathe in deep in the forest. It made me acutely aware of the risk of something as nasty as black mold. The thought was easily shrugged off; I hadn't given up smoking yet, and it took more than that to initiate my long-dormant, depression-strangled survival instinct. Living past 30 was for those who gave a fuck.

Now, because the club was frankenstiened out of train cars, it was pretty easy to place where I was on my mental map. The place was just a bunch of intersecting boxes, all of which were pretty cleanly separated. For the first half-hour or so, I just wandered around the two cars that made up what seemed to be the brunt of the dance area. All the while, I was aware of the two doorways at the edge of the room, the passageways teasing far better-lit environments. Of the two doors, the one attached to the dance floor, I surmised led to whatever the central station had been turned into. I wasn't quite prepared for what I'd find, I thought I was. On my way to the central building, I peeked through the other door and became confused.

The hall was obstructed by a wire door. I'm still not sure what it was doing there. In my mind, it doesn't fit the tourist-trap-inspired tropical cabana vibe the rest of the club aimed for. It's not like the door was blocking; it could easily be walked around, but it felt like a barrier that I couldn't convince myself to overcome. Thankfully, it wasn't between me and the central building I was headed for.

[Image: WireDoor](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bdb2181bba599e825d1e65507950dcbc/41a3882ed467476e-c1/s640x960/f6b514e616a1a0baaa5324571fea869d7c095fa9.pnj)

Compared to the low-ceiling and narrow lengths of the previous rooms, the limited open space of the old station house felt cavernous. It was a layered space with furniture and belongings splayed out in a way I could only describe as Lewis Caroll-esque. Skylights left the room bathed in a much more even light than the previous train cars I had wandered through. Overall, The actual spaces were small. Under normal circumstances, you could measure the time to walk from one room's edge to another in seconds.

[Image: CentralRoomPt1](https://64.media.tumblr.com/db885cf3130b72e134971fdc875d2f7a/2a5e8b8e3fa0cb5e-d2/s640x960/1d41ed67fc35bad3969d5fa2d3d8c608fcaea375.pnj)

It was the first time in what I would begin to make an ill-advised hobby that I became aware of just how present people are *everywhere*. Dozens of discarded items and lost trinkets hinted at stories of those who had trespassed before me. There was one story that stood out.

A bible, discarded clothes, broken chargers, notebooks filled with someone else's ramblings, and a handbook from the local prison. It was a collection of items that evoked in me a rare sympathy. The notebooks, though sopping wet, were still decently legible. At least the page they were already turned to was legible, I was not about to touch them. In part out of fear, they'd just disintegrate. I was also compelled by a general aversion to whatever grime coated them. The notebooks spoke of being in communion with God and being graced with the ability to control the Sun and Moon. It wasn't all sensible. These elements near the handbook from the local prison painted for me a picture of a person who struggled with Religious Delusions, someone in and out of prison simply because society refused to find other ways to help them. At least, that's the person I envisioned.

In the corner of the room, under a spot where the roof wasn't as decayed, was a mattress that was more mildew than fabric. Unfortunately, that seems to be one of the hundreds of images that has not survived the years. At the time, I was pretty confident that the person to whom all these things belonged had moved on. Everything was so still and rigid that it was hard to imagine anyone being there in at least a few months.

Everything echoed, too. My footsteps, heavy breaths, the shutter of my camera. If someone else had been there, I'd have heard them by now, for sure. I was so confident of this. I'm not sure if I was just really good at lying to myself or was too eager to buy any reason to remain calm enough to continue exploring.

Now, this room was only half of the old station building. Two darkened openings connected to what I assumed was the other half. If my mental map was accurate, the door I had seen on the outside with exposed nailheads would also be in that area, and I could get a look at what was nailed to the door to keep it shut. I never would get a chance to figure this out.

One of the archways was barred by a desk with an ancient desktop computer. It left the path at the farthest side of the room from where I entered. Getting through that doorway was like missing that step on the stairs on the way down. The type of miss where you don't fall down, you don't get hurt, but suddenly your brain tells you the world you expected is wrong. Ice falls through your chest, and you're suddenly aware that you may need to act out of instinct to survive. That's how I felt. 

The room was dark, so much darker than I expected. It was black shapes cut out of the room by distant and newspapered-over windows. I still don't know what was different about the ceiling here that it didn't have the ambient light. It was dark and brooding, eliciting a sense of threatening claustrophobia.

It's exactly what I was hoping to find.

I took a deep breath to steady myself. I turned down the shutter speed, getting anything to be preserved through the emulsion of silver halide. I brought the viewfinder up to my eye. The rule of thirds, image motion, path of the observer, all thoughts that went through my head as I lined up the shot. I wasn't going to capture any of the details my naked eye could barely see, but I was hopeful that I could catch the impressions -shades of black and gray to paint some harsh space. After painstaking seconds of shifting and twisting my body, I had my shot. Imposing shapes loomed on either side of the viewfinder, cascading to a low that warped around the distant outline of a doorway, feint glows filtering in from the top. I was sure I had my image. I only had to trust I hadn't screwed up the camera settings. I didn't get to bask in the feeling, though, the hope that I had found my pearls.

Something new caught my eye.

On the right side of my viewfinder, the shape was becoming increasingly unnerving. I had initially just seen it as a tall object to anchor my shot, but now something about it was annoyingly familiar. I knew what the outline looked like, but I didn't want to entertain the idea. I had to. The figure was just a little too human. I could make out hunched shoulders and a bowed head. I could swear by the way the darkness swirled around it, that it was breathing.

I told myself I was wrong. If it was a person, maybe it was just a transient who had been trying to get out of the storm. Maybe another disaffected youth just looking for somewhere away from the world. I let out a weak "hello," and at the time, it felt like I was yelling. Looking back, though, I'm not sure I made any sound, and the echoing noise was more likely a choked chirp of the words stuck in my throat. Whatever the sound I actually managed to vocalize, there was no response. Perhaps this was just a case of pareidolia.

I ignored my accelerating heartbeat to try and get another photo, just in case the first one didn't come out. In case I twitched, or that particular frame was defective. I was here to find my style, and some shaken nerves weren't about to chase me off.

I'd been more scared before and still done dumber.

The shutter of my camera was sharp and snappy, but not alone. There was another loud snap.

The figure had changed.

The figure had changed, it had moved.

I could not simply ignore that the soft curve of what I had assigned the role of shoulder was now a gnarled and twisted limb, an arm with gut-churning angles and fingers like aging branches.

The air of the room was thin, and my diaphragm refused to move. My back went rigid. The scathing silence that followed the echo of the shutter snap burned into my ears. I hadn't imagined it, I couldn't have. The shape was one way, and now another. With my camera lowered, I could see in better detail the inky texture of the outstretched limb.

Panic bounced around my head. I needed to run, but my legs resisted. The part of my memory drenched in animal documentaries that I watched growing up knew flight often only served to trigger predators.

*Why did I assume it was a predator?*

I can't exactly recall what I thought at that moment. I can vaguely recall my consciousness was a roiling cacophony of assumptions and attempted assuaging that went nowhere. Maybe they were just a homeless person having a moment. Perhaps they were a kid being purposefully creepy. Even through whatever my brain was telling me, the reptilian chemicals in my brain knew I didn't want to find out.

On trained tiptoes, I backed away from the anxiety-blurred shadows. The only thing that had my focus was that swaying, outstretched hand. Even bathed in the glow of fractured daylight, I felt no safer.

The distance to the next room, once so tiny, may as well have been the horizon and my escape beyond it was the other side of the Atlantic.

Every little thing I had clambered over went from speed bump to fortress parapet. The simple broken steps I had monkeyed my way around now seemed like a threatening no-man's land.

I needed out, and now.

My racing mind prevailed. I just needed to be alert. I had gotten this far without incident.

Breaths were kept shallow, each inhale a fight against my quivering body. I sidled around the detritus of the room, frantic eyes tracing the narrowing distance between the threatening shape and the archway.

Was it moving?

No, it couldn't be. I couldn't believe it was; if I believed it was moving, I'd have to give into the fight-or-flight of the base creature we all ultimately are.

It was moving, though. In my memory, I remember those pointed fingers turning and swinging through the air, manipulating the space to the doorway. I told myself it was a trick of light through a frenzied state of mind.

Out of view, or so I hoped, I tried to figure out how to walk again. I needed to see where I was going, but I couldn't just turn my back to …well, I don't know what, but I couldn't expose myself to it. I found a way, an awkward uneven pace where I kept myself at an angle where the flattening darkened entry was at the corner of my eye if not in the center of my attention. Each step was planned and calculated between glances. I was careful to slowly distribute my weight, with theheel of my foot placed down first, and the weight slowly distributed to the flat of my foot and then my toes. I'm not sure if it was real or worked to silence my steps, but I had read it as tactic somewhere about something.

My knuckles whitened around my camera clutched close to my shriveling gut.

I made it back to the dance floor. The yawning maws of the distant dark were hardly visible now; only in my mind's eye could I place them near the obfuscated wall. Surely, I had escaped the worst of the danger -I needed to believe that. The next true hurdle was the stairs out of the dance floor, and then it was only a few steps back to the dreary reality from which I had slipped.

I could see the broken-out window.

I felt the urge to stop and cry when I realized I had to put my camera away. It was time and motion that'd turn into sound I felt I couldn't afford to make. I didn't have any good alternatives. My ears filled the room with a high-pitched hum as I strained for any other sound. I struggled through the labor of opening my bag, trying to suppress the rustle of fabric -the effort was in vain. The thump of my camera settling into place may have as well been a gunshot. I didn't even know I had bit my lip till I tasted blood.

I stared at the threshold behind me till the room swam around my obsessive focus. Nothing from the room changed. My commotion had gone unnoticed.

Through gritted teeth and strained muscles, I worked my way up the desecrated steps. It was my last trial to prove I should be allowed to return, surely. At the top of the steps, I caught a taste of false security. My exit was right there, only a few steps away.

A glance behind me was meant to remind me the room I left was unchanged.

It had changed.

The corner of the desk, the one I had seen against one of the archways, had moved from the left side of the door frame to the right. It had moved.

No, I had to be missing something. My perspective had to have changed, I had to just be noticing a different piece of furniture.

I wasn't. I could see the edge of an outdated computer monitor.

Hands over my mouth pushed a whimper back down into my throat, where it got caught in my chest. Heart pulsed against the sensation like a hammer against a stubborn nail.

'*Please, I want to be wrong. Let my memory just be bad.'* I remember thinking.

The change within my own line of sight had been so slow, so subtle, it was almost complete when I noticed it. An overly organic darkness had leaned around the corner of the old station's repurposed entry. Something was moving. *It* was moving. No, no, no. *It* had to be *them*, I thought at the time.

I felt like I had plunged into cold water. That moment after a jump where the world just stops, where you're pressed in from all sides. That transition from falling to floating. The world was still, the moment briefly paused.

Then chaos.

My control broke.

I sprinted the single stride to the window and clambered through it with a disregard for my hands, which I still feel lucky to have not damaged.

My knees buckled as I landed in the isolated space between the repurposed rail cars. I sucked up fresh air in a ragged breath and bolted back toward the pothole-ridden parking lot. I was on the other side. I was out. I turned back to the old station.

I stood there a long while before I burst out laughing and throwing my fists over my head. The adrenaline still flooding my system burst out as joyous relief. Dread turned into euphoria. I even went as far to allow myself a "Woo!" I had won. I had won!

So I thought.

I did not know my experience that day had sown a seed of doubt in my shadow. Given time and plenty of time and food, it would bloom into a thorny brush that pulled at me every waking moment. We're not there yet, though.

It wasn't till a week later I'd see the fruits of my labor. The last two images I took did not turn out as expected, but at the time, I was elated to have found my pearls. The shots were horrendously flawed, but something about their strikes of color spoke to me. It was the type of art one could only find in flaws, and I had plenty of those. I had found my direction, something more than just trying to capture reality.

Even after all this time, these almost simplistic images speak to me. Maybe it's because of what they cost me.

That’s about as much as I and this ancient tablet’s battery can take. I’ll return when (and if) I can salvage the time.
