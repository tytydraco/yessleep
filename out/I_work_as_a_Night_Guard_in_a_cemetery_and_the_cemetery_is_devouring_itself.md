If you have read them already and have made it this far, thank you for joining me in this living nightmare. I appreciate all of you that have stuck around this long. Enjoy as we crest the final hill towards the end.

I had never dreamed of being a Night Guard when I was young. I never expected to work as a Night Guard for nearly fifteen years now, spending my nights silent as ghosts and spirits talked to me and tried to get out of their persistent purgatory.

When I was 19 I married my highschool sweetheart and planned on having a big family. I began working for her father after our marriage doing a job I hated but made her family happy. When we found out she was pregnant, something she shared with her father and myself on our shared birthday, everyone rejoiced as our plans for the future began to fall in place. At 21-years-old I had a job that paid decently for a company I would eventually inherit, a loving wife expecting a child, and a plan for my future of perfectly mundane mediocrity.

However, due to complications beyond our control, we lost the baby. Both of us sank into depression and turned to our own self-destructive machinations. I shut myself out from the world, spending the nights that I didn’t drink myself to slumber pacing the night away, unable to sleep.

The distance between us grew, for my part I failed to think about how the miscarriage had affected her. I never went to her about what had happened, too consumed in how I felt. When the divorce papers came I wasn’t surprised, what did surprise me was how fast the next guy came in and swooped her off to greener pastures.

Where everything had seemed so bright at 21, at 22 everything was dark. When I awoke in the tree just outside of the cemetery, tangled in a mess of drunken stupor and tree branches. Eli and Isaac had found me and managed to coach me down. After sobering me up over breakfast I poured out my sob story and how I was basically broke after the ex-father-in-law had fired me as soon as he had heard whispers of divorce.

The two men took pity on me and worked out a deal with the cemetery director at that time to hire me on. Isaac had me move in with him and his wife and they both became my pseudo-grandparents. During those first few months of working for the cemetery I was under the close eye of Isaac, anytime I would try and go to a bar, he or his wife would somehow appear before I could order my first drink and ordered a bunch of hot wings to go and telling the bartender that I was on the wagon. Isaac saved my life, and when he was certain that I wouldn’t fall back into old habits, I moved out. We had a celebratory drink of diet coke and pounds of hot wings. 

In those early years I would ask from time to time before every shift why we didn’t just chain the gates shut and patrol the perimeter. The answer I always received was that it wasn’t possible and quickly dismissed because the cemetery director wouldn’t hear anything about it.

All these years later, the cemetery director still refuses to close the cemetery. There had to be a reason behind it. There was no way for me to ask Michael why the refusal had been so steadfast, so I turned to the only place that I could imagine could give me some insight. The Town Hall. Our town has a small museum in our town hall that talks about the founder’s family settling our town. I searched the entirety of the museum as well as any of the record books from the library that had to do with the town’s founding and the cemetery.

In 1793, the founder settled the area but was plagued with attacks from natives and frequent illnesses. The lack of easy transport made getting supplies into the interior of the state difficult and the fear of the settlement failing before it could ever get started was on the minds of many. When the founder was told that new leadership was needed, a Hessian turncoat who joined the Americans in the Revolutionary War was sought after among the men to become Mayor and handle the needs of the settlement through more competent action. Within the year, the settlement was thriving and by 1795 was officially incorporated as a town. In the Town Charter it was established that the position of mayor would be voted on by all residents of the town for a life appointment. The Hessian won the vote, a vote determined by every man, woman, and child of the town, thankful for the guiding hand of a soldier who had miraculously solved their problems. The Mayor, grateful for his position, sought to do all he could for the town.

Believed to be a true patriot, the mayor would call on the men of the town and preach the importance of protecting the young country. The men, grateful for the little blessing that found them and their families, always answered when the mayor called. The Mayor, caught in scandal of the disappearances of the men he called and the illicit behavior with the widows of those lost men, found his own luck run out.

However, he did leave behind a legacy that would carry his bloodline throughout the town. The bastard children of the disgraced mayor found their way into the functions of the town. By the end of the 18th century at least a sixteenth of the town could trace back their family line to the same point-of-interest. Most important of all, the cemetery director, a position that had once been merely as caretaker, was always held by someone connected to the mayor’s bloodline. The Night Guards, in contrast, could trace a thread back to the younger brother of Mad Michael.

Victor, the six great-grandson of that mayor, was the current director of the cemetery allowing for the continued sacrifices to continue eight generations later. I took this revelation to Eli, Kyle, Thomas, and Jacob. After much debate it was decided that we needed to come up with a plan before we took any immediate action. For the time being, we would refrain from making any sudden moves.

That night I locked the North Gate as Thomas locked the South Gate. We met at the fountain, determined to ignore any actions of the spirits and only move from our game of chess, checkers, and chinese checkers with Michael when it was time to lock the gates again. As Michael gave his vague predictions of horrible fates whenever another dark vessel neared us, I thought over how we could end the cemetery. Sensing the gears of my mind turning with devious determination, Michael would whisper of what the spirits wanted if the gates were to be unlocked.

Late into the night, howling could be heard and the three of us saw the horde of moss and decay rush to the North Gate, tripping over their elongated obsidian black legs made of ash. Thomas and I followed the horde to discover the gathering mass of spirits eagerly salivating the prey trying to scale the gate. Two teens trying to enter a place that wanted to feast, stopped at the sound of footsteps clicking on the asphalt and closing in. They dropped from the danger they could not perceive and fled back into the safety of the town, away from the cemetery.

The sullying of the feast that was willingly entering the mouths of a starving congregation was returned with horrid screams. The fury of spirits that could not touch us, was fueled with the rage of a refusal to comply with their demands. Our silence did not calm the squall of their anger.

I felt a sense of pride at Thomas’s devotion to our silent pact as Madam Dubois hovered before him, her ample mossy breasts centimeters from his face, but with maggots and yellow ooze dripping from her mouth and eyes. When her tongue licked at rotten sponges of teeth, he closed his eyes and stepped forward to the gate and waited for the last fifteen minutes before it was time for the gate to be locked again. I hurried over to the South Gate, an entourage of burning chimeras and spiders made of steel and marble following close behind. Waiting for me at the gate, Teddy coiled around a lumbering corpse dressed in priestly garbes, the wood and stone of his body crushing the man before his jaw unhinged and he swallowed the body whole. I locked the gates as Callahan, someone I once found a comfortable audience with, was consumed by a fellow being of the night.

The Cemetery was beginning to devour itself.

Soon, that would be all it was capable of doing.
