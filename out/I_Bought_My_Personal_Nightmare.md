I linger in the corners of this house, unseen, a breath of cold in a world too warm. I’ve watched its walls age, its floors creak under new feet, its memories twist in the minds of the living. Time means little to me now, but I remember the night it all unraveled. September, the air thick with storm, or maybe just silence. The details blur even for me, a ghost who sees too much.

The boy was ten. His name escapes me, but his face—sharp, pale, wide-eyed—burns clear. I watched him wake at 5:30 a.m., or perhaps 5:03. The clock’s face was a fleeting anchor in the dark. He slipped from his bed, chasing the promise of cookies, his small feet padding toward the kitchen. The house held its breath, as it always did when something was about to break.

I drifted behind him, a shadow among shadows, tethered to this place by a force I cannot name. The hallway stretched long and heavy, the air pressing against my formless edges. Then came the sound—a doorknob’s slow, deliberate twist. I felt it before I heard it, a ripple in the stillness.

The boy froze. I hovered closer, drawn to his quickening pulse. And then he saw it. Not me, but him. A figure cloaked in smoke and shadow, human in outline but wrong, so wrong. Its eyes glowed white, featureless, yet they held the boy like a vise. I saw them too, those eyes, and they stirred something in me—a memory of a memory, a life I no longer claim.

The boy screamed, a sound that tore through the house and through me. The figure flinched, startled, as if it hadn’t expected to be seen. Footsteps pounded—his father, charging from the bedroom, his mother’s voice trailing in panic. The shadow fled, bursting through the front door into the woods beyond. I followed, gliding over the earth, watching it dissolve into the night. Not a burglar, as the father would later claim. Something else. Something that felt like a wound in time.

I stayed with the boy as the years passed. His memory of that night warped, frayed at the edges. He questioned the smell, the sounds, the shape of the thing. But those eyes—those bright, white voids—clung to him, unyielding. I saw him carry them into adulthood, a weight he couldn’t name.

Then came the old woman. I watched her fall on the sidewalk, her frailty a performance. The boy, grown now, helped her up. Her smile was too sharp, her eyes too old. She spoke of a reward, his deepest desire. I tried to scream, to warn him, but my voice is only air. Her hand closed over his, and she whispered something that made the world shudder. The living don’t feel it, but I did—a crack in the fabric of things.

He vanished. Not into darkness, but into nothing. I felt the house groan, as if it knew what was coming.

When he returned, he stood in the old house, on the bathroom floor, the mirror fogged. It was that night again. I watched him step into the hallway, his body no longer his own. He was smoke and shadow now, his eyes white and endless. He saw the boy—himself, ten years old, trembling in the dark. The boy’s scream split the air, and I saw the man stagger, caught in the echo of his own terror.

His father’s voice roared, footsteps thundering. The man ran, crashing through the door, into the woods, branches clawing at him. I followed, my form flickering in the wind. He collapsed against a tree, sobbing, shaking, his truth breaking open like a wound.

He was the shadow. The intruder. The eyes. The demon he’d feared all his life.

I watched him realize it, his mind folding under the weight. Maybe he was haunted. Maybe he was mad. Maybe time had betrayed him, looping until he was both hunter and prey.

I linger still, in this house, watching the boy who became the demon. I see him in every shadow, every creak, every moment where the past and present collide. He was the architect of his own ruin, and I, the silent witness, can only watch as the story repeats, endless and unbroken.
