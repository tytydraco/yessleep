Let me start out by saying a few things about myself. I've had a number of unfortunate medical conditions, one of which greatly limits the use of my right leg. I won't give out any details on who I am, but suffice it to say that I'm relatively young but because of these conditions I've spent most of my life cooped up in a small apartment, living off of disability as I can't work.

Because of this I don't have any friends- and what few family I have is too busy to visit me more often than once a month. I've spent months whiling away alone in my apartment- usually doing nothing but watching Netflix or surfing the Internet.

I discovered astral projection purely by accident- I had fallen asleep while watching a movie and had a very vivid dream- I was watching myself sleeping and not watching the movie. I would've just chalked that up to me dreaming- but I had never had a dream that felt as real as this. 

I woke up nearly instantly after and I would've written it off as nothing else than a dream except it happened again two weeks later. This time it lasted longer, and to my  joy for a brief while I could move around as I had so long ago.

I woke up again and this time I began doing research into what was happening. I got the idea that I wasn't really dreaming, but was able to actually leave my body while sleeping. It sounded crazy at first but as I read up on other people's experiences I marveled at how close they were to mine. And to add a bit more context, again, I normally never remember what I dreamt. 

There were some sites on how to astral project, and with all the time in the world on my hands, I figured, why not? I started meditating daily- most of the tips and tricks I read online were worthless but I found a few gems. I hesitate to mention what works given what happened to me however.

Initially it was very fun. I could, in this weird dream-like state walk through walls and other barriers. The physical world no longer limited me- after a while I found that I could even float.

I went outside and explore the streets outside. I was invisible, but it was amazing to get out of my self-imposed prison. 

But it was here that I began noticing a pattern- one that I should've paid more attention to. The further and further that I went from my physical body- the less *real* the world seemed. As in, the physical world. It began to blur around me- and this should've been the first sign that I was taking things too far. In most of the accounts I had read people at most went a few feet away from their real bodies- I was almost wandering up to half a mile at times.

And then one day- it happened. I went too far.

And when I did, something... broke. The world seemed to shatter as if I had gone through a wall. And it no longer felt dream-like, it fell all too real.

I was in space- or it felt like space at least. I saw the twinkling of millions of tiny lights- though now that I think about it, I don't think they were stars. My thoughts were interrupted however, as I noticed... *it*.

It was a massive shadow- roughly humanoid but extremely misshapen. It had six pairs of eyes, and at first it was observing the lights above but then, I had the misfortune of it turning to look at me. 

And that clearly triggered something in it. It seemed alarmed- with its movement speed increased tenfold. All six pairs of eyes latched onto me.

I could feel the anger and rage emanating from it. I could feel its hatred.

horrified, I tried to go back... but that's a bit hard when you're a disembodied spirit and have no idea where *back* is supposed to be. 

In a moment of desperation, I just thought as hard as I could of my physical body, willing myself to go back, to find that I had suddenly woken up on my sofa, drenched in sweat.

But I knew that was no dream. I'm not sure exactly what happened- but I have a theory. The further I went from my physical body, the less I got attached to this world. I think my soul entered another dimension- though no matter where I search online I can't find anyone with a similar experience to mine. 

One thing frightens me deeply though- when I said I had seen stars earlier, but realized they weren't stars- I have a good idea now of what I really saw. I could hear things coming from those glowing lights- voices, that is. Human voices.

Those were souls I was looking at. I don't know what the monster that saw me was- some kind of reaper, a god, or a demon- but I know it was angry when it saw me. I was somewhere I shouldn't have been- I had trespassed into a world I was never meant to be in.

I've never tried astral projecting since then- and if I ever see myself accidentally outside my body I immediately dive back in. There is no way that I want to go far from my physical form anymore. I don't think I'll survive another encounter with that monster.

So take it from me- a warning, no matter how bored you are, or how tempting it may seen- do not try astral projecting. Most advice is garbage so I don't think anyone of you will get very far, but if you try long enough, like me, you'll succeed. 

And end up meeting that monster.
