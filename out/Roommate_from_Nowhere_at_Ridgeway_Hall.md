Moving to college was something I had been waiting for since I could remember. Growing up in a small town in Ohio, life had been predictable, too predictable. There were only so many times you could walk down the same three streets, wave to the same neighbors, and eat at the same diner before the monotony of it all began to eat away at you. College was supposed to be my ticket out, my chance to start fresh. To reinvent myself.

I chose this university because it was far enough from home that I wouldn’t run into anyone I knew, but not so far that I couldn’t make it back if I needed to. The campus was beautiful, with sprawling green lawns, old brick buildings, and a mix of historical charm and modern innovation. Ridgeway Hall, the dorm where I would be staying, sat on the far edge of campus, a little separated from the newer buildings. It was one of those old, ivy-covered structures that looked like it had been around for centuries.

When I first saw it, standing tall and slightly worn at the end of the long path leading from the main campus, it had an almost foreboding presence. The ivy snaked up the sides of the building, thick and dark, and the windows were narrow, their panes cloudy with age. There was something cold about it, something that made me shiver despite the late summer warmth.

“Ridgeway Hall, huh?” the cab driver had said as he helped unload my bags. “You’ll hear some stories about that place.”

I had laughed it off at the time, eager to get inside and start unpacking. But now, as I stood in the entryway, staring up at the winding staircase and the dark wood-paneled walls, I felt a pang of unease.

The building smelled faintly of old wood and something musty, like books that had been left in a damp basement for too long. The lights were dim, casting long shadows across the floor. I hadn’t expected luxury, of course. I had read the reviews and seen the pictures online. Ridgeway Hall was described as “charming” and “historic,” which I now realized were code words for “outdated” and “creepy.”

I found Room 318 on the third floor, tucked away at the end of a narrow hallway. The door creaked when I pushed it open, revealing a small room with two twin beds, two wooden desks, and a single window that looked out over the campus. The walls were a dull, off-white color, and the floor was covered in an old, threadbare rug that had clearly seen better days. It wasn’t much, but it was mine. For the next few months, at least.

I set my suitcase on one of the beds and looked around. The air in the room was stale, like it hadn’t been aired out in a long time. The window was slightly cracked, and when I walked over to close it, I noticed how dirty the glass was, making the world outside look hazy and distant. I could just make out the silhouette of the clock tower across campus, shrouded in mist from the light rain that had started falling.

A sigh escaped me. It wasn’t what I had imagined, but it would do. I spent the next hour unpacking, filling the dresser drawers with my clothes and setting up my books on the desk. The emptiness of the room was unsettling, and the quiet was almost oppressive. There were no sounds of other students moving in, no doors slamming, no music playing down the hall. It was as if Ridgeway Hall existed in its own bubble, disconnected from the rest of campus.

After finishing my unpacking, I decided to explore the dorm. The building had three floors, and from what I had read, it was one of the oldest structures on campus. The third floor, where my room was located, seemed to be the least occupied. I passed by several closed doors, but I didn’t hear any noise coming from inside. It felt like I was the only one here.

The second floor was a little more lively. I heard the faint sounds of conversation coming from one of the rooms, and the common area at the end of the hallway had a few people lounging on couches, scrolling through their phones. I waved to a couple of students as I walked by, but they didn’t seem to notice me. They were too absorbed in their own world, which suited me just fine.

The first floor, however, was eerily quiet. The lobby was dimly lit, the old chandelier casting flickering shadows on the walls. The floors creaked beneath my feet as I walked, and I could hear the faint hum of the building’s heating system. There was a strange smell down here, too, something metallic mixed with the musty scent of old wood. It wasn’t overpowering, but it was noticeable enough to make me wrinkle my nose.

I found the laundry room and the small kitchen tucked away in a corner near the lobby. They looked as old as the building itself, with outdated appliances and peeling wallpaper. I wondered how many students had passed through Ridgeway Hall over the years, how many had lived in the same room I now occupied. The thought made me feel small, like just another temporary occupant in a place that had existed long before me and would continue long after I was gone.

On my way back to my room, I passed an old corkboard near the stairwell, covered in faded flyers and notices. Most of them were announcements for events that had long since passed, but one flyer caught my eye. It was a simple white piece of paper with bold, black letters that read:

HAVE YOU SEEN ETHAN MARSHALL? Missing since last semester. If you have any information, please contact campus security.

I stared at the flyer for a moment, my heart skipping a beat. Ethan Marshall. The name sounded familiar, but I couldn’t place it. I hadn’t heard anything about a student going missing before coming here, and the fact that the flyer was still up made me wonder if they had ever found him.

The thought of someone disappearing from campus, especially from the same dorm I was now living in, sent a shiver down my spine. I shook it off, telling myself it was probably nothing. People went missing all the time, didn’t they? It was probably unrelated to me or my new life here.

Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease as I headed back to my room. Ridgeway Hall felt different now, darker somehow. The shadows seemed longer, the silence more oppressive. I was glad I wasn’t alone, my roommate would be arriving soon, and having someone else around would make this place feel less... haunted.

When I reached my room, I noticed the door to the room next to mine, Room 317, was slightly ajar. I hadn’t seen anyone enter or leave that room all day, but now I could hear the faint sound of movement from inside. Curiosity got the better of me, and I paused for a moment, listening.

It was subtle at first, just the sound of fabric rustling, like someone shifting in bed. But then I heard something else, something that made my blood run cold. A soft, rhythmic tapping, like fingers drumming on a desk, growing louder with each passing second. I didn’t want to intrude, so I quickly stepped away and headed into my room, closing the door behind me with more force than I had intended. The tapping stopped as soon as my door clicked shut, and the silence that followed was deafening.

I sat on my bed, trying to shake the unease that had settled over me. I told myself it was nothing, just someone moving around in their room. But deep down, I knew something about this place wasn’t right.

And I hadn’t even met my roommate yet.

The following day, I woke up early, feeling a bit more settled after my strange first night. The rain had stopped, and the campus looked brighter under the pale morning sun. I decided to spend some time exploring the main part of the university, trying to familiarize myself with the layout of the buildings and find my way to the dining hall.

It was a peaceful morning, with only a few students milling about. I grabbed breakfast, found a quiet spot outside, and enjoyed my meal while watching people pass by. It was nice to feel part of something bigger, even if I didn’t know anyone yet.

Later in the afternoon, I headed back to Ridgeway Hall, my thoughts drifting to my roommate. I still hadn’t heard from him, and a part of me wondered if he had decided to back out last minute. The idea of having the room to myself was appealing, but at the same time, I was looking forward to meeting him. It would be nice to have someone around to share the experience of living in a new place.

When I reached my room, I noticed the door was slightly open. My heart raced for a moment, thinking back to the flyer I had seen the day before about the missing student. But as I pushed the door open, I saw someone standing by the window, his back to me.

He was tall, with messy brown hair and a relaxed posture, as if he didn’t have a care in the world. He turned around as soon as I entered, flashing me a friendly smile.

“Hey, man. You must be Alex, right? Sorry I’m late. I’m Ethan.”

Ethan. My heart skipped a beat at the name. I forced a smile, trying to shake the unease that had suddenly gripped me. There was no way this could be the same Ethan from the flyer... right?

“Nice to finally meet you.” , I said.

Ethan immediately made himself at home, tossing his backpack onto the other bed and starting to unpack. He didn’t seem to notice my hesitation, or if he did, he didn’t acknowledge it. Instead, he launched into a casual conversation about the dorm, asking me how my first few days had been and whether I’d checked out the dining hall yet.

Despite my initial wariness, I found myself warming up to him quickly. He was easy to talk to, with a laid-back vibe that put me at ease. Within minutes, we were chatting like old friends, swapping stories about our hometowns and our reasons for choosing this university.

Ethan had a way of making everything feel normal, even when it wasn’t. His presence was calming, and for the first time since I had arrived, I felt like I wasn’t alone. We spent the rest of the evening talking, getting to know each other, and by the time I went to bed, I was glad to have him as my roommate.

But as I lay in bed that night, staring up at the ceiling, I couldn’t stop thinking about the flyer. Have you seen Ethan Marshall?

I told myself it was a coincidence. There had to be more than one Ethan on campus, right? It wasn’t an uncommon name. Besides, this Ethan was here, unpacking, settling in. He wasn’t missing.

And yet, the unease lingered.

Over the next couple of weeks, life at Ridgeway Hall settled into a routine. Classes began, and I quickly found myself juggling the workload, figuring out which professors were sticklers for attendance and which ones didn’t care if you ever showed up. College life felt like a blur of new experiences, late nights, and endless cups of coffee.

Ethan and I got along surprisingly well. We didn’t have any classes together, but we spent most evenings in our dorm room, chatting or doing homework. He wasn’t much for small talk in public, and though I occasionally invited him to join me when I grabbed food at the dining hall, he often declined. It didn’t bother me at first, I figured he was just more introverted than I was, preferring to keep to himself.

But the more time I spent with Ethan, the more I started to notice the little things that didn’t add up.

For one, Ethan never seemed to eat. At least, not when I was around. Whenever we sat in the dining hall together, he’d grab a tray like everyone else, but instead of eating, he’d just push his food around the plate, barely taking a bite. He’d talk and laugh like everything was normal, but his fork rarely reached his mouth.

“Are you on some kind of diet?” I asked one afternoon, as we sat in the dining hall. “You barely touch your food.”

He looked up from his tray, his expression calm. “Nah, just not that hungry. I guess I have a weird appetite.”

I nodded, not wanting to press the issue. But the more I thought about it, the more it gnawed at me. It wasn’t just his eating habits. Ethan didn’t sleep either. At least, I never saw him sleep.

Most nights, I’d go to bed around midnight, and Ethan would still be sitting at his desk, staring at his laptop or reading a book. I assumed he was just a night owl. But what really started to get under my skin was that he’d still be awake when I woke up in the morning. His side of the room was always perfectly neat, the sheets on his bed untouched, as if he hadn’t slept at all.

One night, I decided to ask him about it.

“Hey, do you ever sleep?” I asked, trying to keep my tone light. “You’re always up when I go to bed, and you’re still awake when I wake up.”

Ethan glanced over at me, a slight smile playing on his lips. “I guess I just don’t need as much sleep as most people,” he said with a shrug. “I’ve always been like that.”

His answer was vague, but I didn’t push it. Still, it left me feeling uneasy. I couldn’t help but think about the missing student flyer I’d seen on the first day, Have you seen Ethan Marshall? And how no one on campus seemed to know my roommate.

As strange as it all felt, I tried to convince myself I was being paranoid. I mean, maybe he was just an unusual guy. Everyone had their quirks, right? And despite everything, I liked having him around. He was a good listener, always there when I needed to vent about a tough class or a weird interaction with a professor.

But the small, nagging feeling that something wasn’t right kept creeping back in.

It started with subtle things. Small enough that I could brush them off as my imagination.

One evening, as I was getting ready for bed, I noticed something strange on Ethan’s desk. He had left for the library, so the room was empty except for me. His laptop was closed, but his notebook was open, and there was something written on the page.

I didn’t mean to snoop, but the writing caught my eye, thick, black letters scrawled in what looked like frantic handwriting. I leaned in closer, squinting to make out the words.

I’ve always been here. I’ve always been watching.

I froze, my heart pounding in my chest. The words seemed to pulse on the page, like they were alive, breathing with some strange energy. I blinked, my head spinning. Was this a joke? A prank?

I closed the notebook quickly and stepped away from the desk, trying to calm myself down. It was probably nothing. Maybe he was writing a short story or something for class. Writers sometimes scribble down weird ideas, right?

But as I climbed into bed that night, I couldn’t shake the feeling of dread that settled in the pit of my stomach.

The next day, I noticed more strange things. The way the lights flickered whenever Ethan entered the room, casting long, dark shadows across the walls. The way the air felt colder when he was around, as if his presence somehow drained the warmth from the space. The shadows themselves seemed to stretch farther than they should, crawling up the walls and wrapping around corners in ways that didn’t make sense.

I didn’t say anything to Ethan, but I started to avoid him when I could. I made excuses to spend more time in the library, studying with classmates, or grabbing lunch off-campus. I still couldn’t bring myself to confront him, what would I even say? “Hey, I think you might be some kind of... what? A ghost? A demon?”

I wasn’t even sure what I was dealing with, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t normal.

The first real incident happened on a freezing January afternoon, right after the first big snowstorm of the season. Campus was buried under a thick blanket of snow, and the air was so cold it felt like my skin might crack. Most students had retreated indoors, but Ethan suggested we go for a walk to “clear our heads.”

I agreed, hoping the fresh air might help me think straight. Maybe I was reading too much into everything. Maybe I was just stressed out from classes. I needed some time away from the dorm to clear my mind.

We walked side by side across the campus grounds, the snow crunching under our boots as we made our way past the old brick buildings and through the empty courtyards. The campus felt deserted, almost abandoned, with only the occasional student hurrying by, bundled up in layers of scarves and jackets.

At one point, I stopped to tie my shoelace, crouching down on the snow-covered path. Ethan waited for me a few steps ahead, watching as I fumbled with the laces. I glanced up, about to make a joke about how cold it was, but the words caught in my throat.

There were no footprints where Ethan stood.

I blinked, my heart skipping a beat. I looked down at the snow around me, my own footprints were clear and deep, cutting a path through the snow as I had walked. But when I looked up at Ethan again, the snow beneath him was untouched, smooth and undisturbed as if no one had been standing there.

“Ethan...” I said, my voice shaky. “Where are your footprints?”

He glanced down, then back at me, his expression calm, almost too calm. “What do you mean?”

I stared at him, my mind racing. “Your footprints. You’ve been walking this whole time, but there’s nothing. No tracks.”

Ethan shrugged, his eyes dark and unreadable. “Maybe the snow’s just covering them up.”

That didn’t make any sense. The snow hadn’t been falling for hours, and my footprints were still clear as day. I opened my mouth to argue, but the look on his face stopped me. There was something in his eyes, something cold.

I swallowed hard, standing up and brushing the snow from my jeans. “Yeah, maybe,” I muttered, though I didn’t believe it.

We continued walking, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was terribly, terribly wrong. The unease gnawed at me, tightening like a knot in my stomach. I glanced back at our path again, and sure enough, there were only my footprints trailing behind us.

The footprint incident gnawed at me for days. I couldn’t stop thinking about how impossible it was, Ethan walking next to me with no tracks in the snow. I tried to explain it away, chalk it up to stress, exhaustion, maybe even paranoia. But I couldn’t get rid of the feeling that I was missing something. Something important.

After a restless night, I made a decision. I had to figure out what was going on with Ethan. It wasn’t just the footprints. It was everything, the way he never ate, never slept, the way the room felt colder when he was around. I wasn’t crazy. There was something wrong with him, and I needed to know what it was.

The first place I went was the dorm office. It was tucked away in a small, musty room in the basement of the administration building, where the floors creaked and the walls were lined with old filing cabinets. The dorm supervisor, a middle-aged woman with graying hair and thick glasses, sat behind a cluttered desk, typing away on an ancient computer.

“Excuse me,” I said, stepping up to the desk. “I have a question about my roommate, Ethan Marshall. I just wanted to check if there were any issues with his records or if there was anything I should know.”

The woman glanced up at me, her eyes narrowing slightly. “Ethan Marshall? What room are you in?”

“Room 318.”

She frowned and turned to her computer, typing in my room number. A few seconds passed, and her frown deepened. She clicked through a few more screens, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest.

“I don’t have anyone by that name assigned to your room,” she said, her voice confused. “It shows you’re the only occupant of 318. Ethan Marshall never checked in. He was supposed to be assigned to your room at the start of the semester, but he never arrived.”

I stared at her, my mind reeling. “That’s impossible. He’s been living with me for weeks. We’ve been hanging out, going to class, everything. He’s my roommate.”

The woman shook her head. “I’m sorry, but according to our records, Ethan Marshall never showed up. You’ve been listed as the only resident in that room.”

For a moment, I couldn’t speak. The words swirled around in my head, but they didn’t make sense. Ethan wasn’t real? How could he not be real? I had talked to him, spent time with him. He had unpacked his things in our room. He had walked beside me in the snow, even if the footprints weren’t there.

“I... I don’t understand,” I finally stammered. “Can you check again? There has to be a mistake.”

The woman clicked through a few more screens, but she shook her head again. “No mistake. You’re the only one in 318.”

I thanked her and left the office, my head spinning. How could this be happening? How could Ethan not exist? The weight of the situation pressed down on me, making it hard to breathe. I walked out into the cold winter air, trying to clear my head.

Maybe I was losing it. Maybe the stress of moving to a new place, starting college, and adjusting to life away from home was messing with my mind. But it didn’t feel like that. This was different. This was real. I knew Ethan was real.

I spent the rest of the day in a daze, barely able to focus during my classes. My mind kept returning to the same question over and over again: Who is Ethan?

By the time I got back to Ridgeway Hall that evening, the sky had turned dark, and the wind had picked up, howling through the narrow alleyways between the old brick buildings. I trudged up the stairs to the third floor, my mind still buzzing with questions. As I opened the door to my room, I was met with the same familiar sight, Ethan sitting at his desk, his back to me, staring at his laptop.

“Hey,” I said cautiously, stepping into the room. “You didn’t happen to swing by the dorm office today, did you?”

Ethan didn’t turn around. “Nope,” he replied, his voice as calm and relaxed as always.

I hesitated, unsure of how to broach the subject. “So... I was there earlier. They said they didn’t have you listed as my roommate. Like, officially, you never checked in.”

There was a brief pause, and for a moment, I thought he might not answer. But then he spoke, his voice still eerily calm.

“Yeah, that’s weird,” he said. “Probably just a mix-up. You know how those records are.”

I stared at the back of his head, my pulse quickening. “It’s more than that. They said you never arrived on campus. They don’t have any record of you being here.”

Ethan’s fingers stopped typing, but he didn’t turn around. “Huh. That is strange.”

He didn’t offer any further explanation. No excuse, no protest. Just that is strange. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and I felt a cold shiver run down my spine.

“You never talk about where you’re from,” I said, my voice shaky. “Or what classes you’re taking. You don’t eat. You don’t sleep. And that day in the snow... you didn’t leave any footprints.”

This time, Ethan did turn around. Slowly, almost deliberately, he swiveled his chair to face me. His eyes were dark, and there was something unsettling about the way he looked at me, something I hadn’t noticed before.

“What are you trying to say, Alex?” he asked, his voice low.

I swallowed hard, my mouth dry. “Who are you?”

For a long moment, Ethan didn’t say anything. He just stared at me, his expression unreadable. The air in the room felt thick, heavy, like it was pressing down on me, making it hard to breathe. The shadows in the corners of the room seemed to stretch farther than they should have, creeping up the walls like something alive.

Then, Ethan smiled. But it wasn’t the friendly, easygoing smile I had grown used to. It was cold, distant, and somehow wrong.

“I’m exactly who you think I am,” he said quietly. “I’m your roommate, Alex. And I’ve been here the whole time.”

I took a step back, my heart racing. “But... the records...”

“Records can be wrong,” Ethan said, standing up from his chair. He took a step toward me, and the room seemed to grow colder, the shadows closing in around us. “People make mistakes.”

I felt trapped, backed into a corner by his presence. “What do you want?”

Ethan tilted his head, his smile never fading. “I already have what I want. You.”

My breath caught in my throat, and I felt the room spin around me. The realization hit me like a punch to the gut. Ethan wasn’t real. He was never real. He was something else, something pretending to be my roommate, something that had been living with me, watching me.

I turned and bolted for the door, my hand fumbling with the doorknob. But as I yanked it open, I felt a cold hand on my shoulder, pulling me back.

“You can’t leave, Alex,” Ethan whispered in my ear, his voice cold and sharp like ice. “You belong here now.”

I wrenched myself free from Ethan’s grasp, stumbling out into the hallway. My heart pounded in my chest as I ran down the corridor, my feet slapping against the cold, tiled floor. I didn’t know where I was going, anywhere but there.

The hallway stretched on forever, the walls narrowing as I ran. The lights flickered overhead, casting long, distorted shadows that seemed to move on their own. My breath came in ragged gasps, and I could hear the pounding of my heart in my ears.

Behind me, I heard Ethan’s footsteps, slow, deliberate, unhurried. He wasn’t chasing me, but I knew he was following. He didn’t need to run. He knew I had nowhere to go.

I turned a corner and skidded to a stop. The hallway in front of me was gone, replaced by a wall of darkness. It was as if the building itself had swallowed the corridor, leaving nothing but a void in its place. I turned back the way I had come, but the hallway behind me had disappeared as well. I was trapped.

Ethan’s footsteps grew louder, echoing in the empty space around me. I pressed myself against the wall, my hands shaking, my mind racing. This couldn’t be happening. This couldn’t be real.

But it was.

“You can’t run, Alex,” Ethan’s voice echoed through the darkness, coming from everywhere and nowhere at once. “You’re already mine.”

The air grew colder, and I felt a pressure in my chest, like the very life was being drained from me. The shadows twisted and writhed, closing in around me like black tendrils.

I could feel Ethan’s presence, closer now, suffocating, oppressive. I closed my eyes, my mind screaming for a way out, any way out.

Suddenly, the pressure lifted. I opened my eyes, and I was standing outside Ridgeway Hall. The cold wind whipped at my face, and the night sky stretched out above me, clear and bright. The building loomed behind me, dark and silent, as if nothing had ever happened.

I stumbled away, my breath coming in ragged gasps. My legs felt weak, and my head spun with confusion. How had I gotten out? Had it all been a hallucination? A nightmare?

As I stood there in the freezing cold, staring back at the window of Room 318, my breath fogging the air in front of me, I couldn’t make sense of it. Ethan was just standing there, his cold eyes locked onto mine, not moving, not blinking. For a moment, I felt paralyzed, unsure of what to do. It was already night, and the chill in the air was biting through my jacket. The campus was eerily quiet, the only sound being the soft whisper of the wind. I didn’t have a choice. I had to go back inside.

I turned and made my way back toward Ridgeway Hall, my steps slow and hesitant. The building loomed ahead of me, darker than it had ever seemed before. As I reached the entrance, the door creaked open with a groan that echoed in the stillness, as if the dorm itself were sighing at my return. The warmth inside hit me immediately, but it felt wrong, thick and suffocating, like the air had grown stale and heavy in my absence.

The hallway was dimly lit, the flickering lights casting strange shadows on the walls. As I walked down the corridor toward the stairwell, I swore I could see movement out of the corner of my eye. Flickers of darkness seemed to shift, almost as if the shadows themselves were alive, creeping along the walls and floors. I glanced over my shoulder, my heart racing, but there was nothing. Just the empty hallway behind me, as silent and still as it had been moments before.

I reached the stairs and ascended to the third floor, my hand gripping the railing tightly. Each step felt heavier than the last, as though the air was pressing down on me. By the time I reached my floor, the entire building seemed unnervingly quiet, too quiet. No sounds of other students moving about, no music, no voices. Just the sound of my own breathing, shallow and uneven.

When I reached my room, I stopped in front of the door to Room 318. My hand hovered over the knob, my heart pounding in my chest. I didn’t want to go inside, but I had no other option. With a deep breath, I pushed open the door.

The room was empty.

Ethan was gone.

His side of the room looked untouched, as if he had never been there in the first place. The bed was perfectly made, the desk neat and orderly, no sign of his presence. But something was wrong. The air in the room was colder than the rest of the dorm, and the shadows that filled the corners seemed darker, thicker. I stepped inside cautiously, the door creaking shut behind me with a soft click that made me jump.

As I moved toward my bed, I noticed small, strange things out of place. The lamp on Ethan’s desk flickered on and off, casting brief bursts of light that made the shadows dance in ways that defied logic. A soft tapping sound echoed from the walls, like fingers drumming in a slow, deliberate rhythm, though there was no one there. The tapping would start and stop at random intervals, each time sending a chill down my spine.

The wind outside howled, but the sound seemed to filter through the walls as if the building itself was breathing. I sat on my bed, my back pressed against the headboard, trying to steady my thoughts. The longer I sat there, the more I noticed things moving out of the corner of my eye, small, fleeting shadows skittering across the floor, the faint sound of whispers that I couldn’t quite understand. It felt as if the room itself was alive, watching me, waiting for something.

I don’t know how long I stayed like that, frozen in my bed, heart racing, eyes darting around the room. The strange occurrences persisted throughout the night. At one point, I heard a door slam down the hall, but when I opened my door to check, the hallway was empty. The dim lights above flickered ominously, casting long, unnatural shadows that stretched and twisted along the walls like grasping hands.

Hours passed like a blur. The entire dorm seemed eerily deserted, as though I were the only one left inside. The oppressive quiet was unbearable, broken only by the occasional creak of the old building settling and the unsettling whispers that continued to swirl around me, just out of earshot.

And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the strange occurrences stopped.

Morning came with the soft light of dawn filtering through the grimy window. The warmth of the sun seemed to banish the shadows that had haunted the night, and for the first time since I had returned to the dorm, I felt like I could breathe again. I was exhausted, my body heavy with fatigue, but the unease in my chest had lifted slightly. I convinced myself that it was over, that whatever had happened during the night was done.

I left my room, eager to escape the stifling atmosphere of Ridgeway Hall. As I walked down the stairs, I overheard a group of students whispering in the lobby. They spoke in hushed voices, their faces pale with shock.

“Did you hear? They found a student… in one of the rooms on the third floor.”

My heart skipped a beat, and I stopped in my tracks, listening closely.

“Who was it?” one of the students asked.

“They said it was Ethan Marshall,” another replied, her voice barely above a whisper. “He went missing last semester, and… they found him this morning. Lifeless, in Room 317.”

A chill ran down my spine. Room 317. The room next to mine.

My heart pounded in my chest as the realization hit me like a wave. Ethan, the Ethan I had spent nights talking to, laughing with, had been gone this entire time. The Ethan I knew wasn’t real. He had never been real. He was nothing but a ghost, trapped in this place, pretending to be alive.

I stumbled back, the world around me blurring. Ethan had been reaching out, searching for something, closure, perhaps. And now, with his body found, maybe he had finally found it.

I couldn’t stay in Ridgeway Hall any longer. I packed my things and moved to a different dorm that same afternoon. The air felt lighter in the new building, the silence not so oppressive. But even as I settled into my new room, far from the haunted halls of Ridgeway, I couldn’t shake the feeling.

Somewhere, in the shadows of Ridgeway Hall, Ethan was still watching. And though I had left, a part of me knew that I could never truly escape.
