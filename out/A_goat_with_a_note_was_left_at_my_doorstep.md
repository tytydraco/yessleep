Yesterday morning I woke up to a notification on my phone—it was from my ring doorbell. I was still half-asleep, but then I noticed that it was 3:23am and a little pulse of adrenaline made me wake up completely and check the notification. I clicked on the “person recorded” button and I honestly thought what I saw was a joke or some sort of prank at first. The first thing I see are two fratty looking dudes with those neon colored trucker hats on. They’re running toward my door and they’re carrying some sort of animal that’s writhing around in their arms.The film quality is grainy, but I see that their eyes look pretty frantic and scared. They were wearing N-95 masks, so I couldn’t really see the rest of their faces. This is when I realize that they’re placing a goat in front of my door. It has rope around its neck and some wooden box at the end that’s holding something. At this point I’m already speed walking towards my door and I grab the bat that I keep in my mudroom closet closest to my door.



By the time I reach the door though, I can hear the frat bro’s lifted truck peeling out from my street. I opened the door as fast as I could, but their truck was already halfway around the corner of the street I live on and I didn’t see a license plate. I look down and there’s a black, brown, and white goat staring up at me. At this point I started laughing, because I honestly was kind of impressed by what I thought, at that time, was a kind of dumb, albeit impressive prank. Now I had some goat to deal with, but that’s when I remembered the box from when I was watching the app video. I knelt down while it “bahhhhed” at me and opened what looked almost like a small jewelry box. I pushed open the folding metal clamp and then found a small rolled up piece of paper inside. At this point I’m holding a little length of rope that was fashioned into a collar on the goat. My dog inside is going crazy inside his crate, because he always does that whenever anyone is at the door. I’m joking to myself that maybe he’s jealous because it looks like I’m about to take this goat for a walk and not him. The goat looked up at me, it had yellow eyes and had those creepy horizontal pupils that goats have.



I open up the note and immediately go from annoyed/slightly amused to dread. 



This is what the note said:

*We did something wrong. Sorry but ur just the unlucky house. If you want you can just give it to someone else, but it will kill u if you still have it by sundown tmrw. Really sorry, we tht it was just a book.* 



What?



I had absolutely no idea what to do. I definitely believe in weird stuff and I’m conspiratorial. That being said, this seemed like just a really bad joke. Something made my stomach feel sour though. So I’m standing at my open door still with this note in my hand and a goat, and I have no idea what to do. What am I supposed to do, call the police? I brought the goat into the kitchen and tied its rope to my table. All in all it was actually a pretty chill goat and I pet it a few times. I could tell it liked being next to me, but being next to it almost made me feel colder. After a while, I even got my dog to calm down. I tried looking up some animal control places, but they were all closed of course. At this point, I’m much calmer and I’m starting to realize that I had definitely been pranked. I started to relax, but then really weird things started happening. 



It’s around 3:45 at this point, and I’m searching on the internet about what to do with a goat or animals at night. Most everything tells me to call 911 if the animal is dangerous, but it’s obviously not. 



All of the sudden  I start getting this really bad piercing headache and my dog starts barking again. I walked into my bedroom to get some tylenol, and the headache stopped immediately. Like right away. I open the door and it starts again. I went over to my dog, because he started whining instead of barking. That’s when I noticed that his ears had small trickles of blood falling out of them. This makes me go into a bit of a panic, because even though it doesn’t make sense, I somehow *know* it has to be the goat doing it. Right after that, I hear glass shatter all throughout my house. I run to the bathroom, still holding my dog, and I saw that my bathroom mirror shattered. 



Now here’s the part where I start to feel terrible about what I did next. 



I have a neighbor that’s actually pretty nice to me, but he always has a big Trump flag outside their house, and I’m pretty sure he reported me to the local police department one time because my car was parked in front of his house when I had friends over one Saturday. So I kind of rationalized this away as me needing to take care of my dog and clean up the broken glass in my house, but around like 4:30am I brought the goat over to their door, knocked REALLY loudly and ran off back home. They don’t have a ring camera or anything.



I got my dog into bed and just kind of hid under the covers (don’t judge me) until I fell asleep and then I slept in. 



I got into work late for my shift as at my cousin’s car repair place, he’s hired me while I’m in between jobs and I don’t want to let him down—honestly it was a really crazy day with a lot people coming in, so I almost forgot about it, got home late, fed my dog and passed out. 



When I woke up though, it was around 5am and I heard sirens and there were flashing police and ambulance lights outside my window. I stepped out and there was a stretcher being put into an ambulance right outside my neighbor’s house. This next part probably sounds the most insane out of everything so far, but I swear one of the ambulance techs made this weird look at me like he knew what I was thinking, and I also swear he had horizontal pupils.



I found out later that day that my neighbor had a heart attack. 



I had to post here now though because I overheard a cop who was at the repair shop because he was having car troubles. He was telling my boss about my neighbor’s 911 call. Apparently he kept shouting about how someone was staring at him through the walls. He said that there was another voice. The cop said maybe it was my neighbor’s voice just in a manic state, but that both ‘my child’ and ‘their mistakes’ can be made out at certain points. 



I feel like I caused this. Did I?
