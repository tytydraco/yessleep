No good deed goes unpunished… no evil deed goes unappraised.

I speak now as a man who is defined by clarity. If I had been asked- referencing my definition- a few years ago, I would have hesitated, pondered, perhaps even zoned out in the ether of existentialism; eventually I would reply: Making my son happy.

If you asked me- once more referencing my definition- a few months ago; the words would practically fly from my lips like an uncaged crow: Survival. 

My son was killed by a drunk driver who- by taking my son- took a word from my vocabulary and mutilated it; violated it. Loved. I had to say I loved my son. I couldn’t wake up and look him in the blue marble eyes and smile and say: I love you. That word was taken from me by the last person I’d expect. 

His mother didn’t bother showing up to the funeral: “I don’t want to see my son like that, fucker!” translation: “I don’t have any clothes not stained with cum or soaked in crack smoke, fucker!” And other than me and my father-in-law, the pews were empty.

“Thank you for coming, Immanuel.” His hand was as soft as sandpaper but gentle.

“Of course, Kiddo. This isn’t something you face alone… Sasha not comin’?” His eyes kept mine open, kept them alert. I shook my head and he nodded his. It felt like his hand was glued to my back, keeping a constant, pleasant pressure on my shoulder. The service was short and despite paying for the lecture, I only had one person to eulogize to. 

“He never got to meet you. I’m sorry about that. Just everything with Sasha… I was so bitter. And I didn’t even know you existed till you just kinda… appeared while she was first showing… signs.”

“You don’t need to apologize. It’s not like I’ll never meet him. I’ll end up in the same garden he is. So will you.”

“I think I’m gonna be okay… I just need some time.”

“Well once you’re ready… I’ll call you.” I raised an eyebrow for a frame, but smiled crudely and nodded. I Ubered home- I suppose the driver was typically chatty, but picking up a tear stained man from a funeral house was a hint enough- and tipped the fella 15 bucks for the quality AC.

8 glasses of cinnamon pain killer were enough to get the tears to stop. As I went for a 9th, the first knock came. *Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap.* Through the peep hole I saw a lean white man with slick salt and pepper comb-over. He wore a black suit and tie. I opened the door, expecting a mormon and noticed he now wore glasses too. They were thin and circular. I must have missed them in my hasty once-over of him. I thought he looked better with them anyway so I didn’t pay it much mind. “Y– Yes?”

“Hey neighbor! I just moved in down the way, but the movers won’t have my stuff there till tomorrow. Could I borrow some lunch meat or something?”

“Um…” It was a weird question, but houses aren’t cheap, especially not in my area, so who am I to deny a man tight on cash. “Sure-”

“You look lost.” I was stunned for a moment. “Did you just move here too?” Relief escaped my lungs. My drunken gait was indifferent from a man lost in a new, too-big house. 

“No no… just a little… Little too many stiff ones.” I faked a chuckle and his chuckle followed, even faker than mine. It was oddly reassuring. He faked his laugh to make me feel better about faking mine. I smiled for the second time that day. “Do you wanna come in, get some coffee?”

He took two steps back and looked up at the sky with a sarcastic examination. “My dad always told me to play things safe, but where is the harm in living a little dangerously?” Now I actually chuckled and swung the door wide.

“Coffee at 6, you must be a Knievel.” He walked inside

“One, actually, but I prefer Lou.” And stayed for about 3 hours, sharing stories about his time serving as a missionary and pastor.

“It’s been a while, but Egypt was an oven! You simply cannot escape the heat. I can only imagine it’s worse now with global-warming and all.” *Sip.* “But, I was out there with a dozen of my guys trying to spread the ‘Oh-so-good word’ and help some of these people, but we-” He stifled laughter while he spoke. “We ended up getting chased out by some hippie in a damn curtain!” He practically screamed in laughter and I followed suit. “But, little did he know, I don’t get chased out that easily… Man, it’s getting late. I ought to head home– Thank you. Thank you for humoring an old fool.” He stood up and threw on his jacket.

“Of course. And thank *you,* I needed the laughter.”

“I always provide.” He bowed slightly and I chuffed. “You mind if I come around again, see how much more I can steal from ya?” he giggled and I wheezed.

“Come and take what you want anytime, friend.”

“Well I like your doors, so I’ll start there.” And once more I wheezed in a caffeinated-drunken gigglefit. He stuffed down his laughter and extended his hand for a shake. My hand rose, but was snatched back as my phone rang loudly. 

“Shoot–”

“No worries, get your call, bud. I’ll see ya later!”

I grit my teeth, embarrassed but nodded and waved, before shutting the door and rushing to my phone. “Immanuel?”

“Hey, Kiddo. I just wanted to check in on you.” The velvet gravel voice of Immanuel bucked in my ears and in my motion my stomach twisted to a knot. It felt years had passed since I thought of him- of anything other than booze, coffee, and conversation.

“I- I’m…” The world came back to me. “I’m… better. As *better* as I can be.”

“Good good. I was wondering, and you can say no, if you’d want to come to church with me Sunday?” 

“I- Uh… I don’t know if that’s where I belong. I don’t- I’m not-”

“I’m not asking you to. And, trust me when I say, you need to. But it’ll help.”

I chewed on my cheek. “Alright. Where is it?”

“Don’t worry about that part, I’ll pick you up at 5:30am. Deal?”

“Deal.”

The next day, around 3pm, Lou: *Tap Tap Tap,* then cracked open my door and peered in. I craned my neck, cheeks slightly tear stained as I gripped a photo of my son in Thomas the Tank engine costume me and him had DIY’d for Halloween.

“Hey, Bud… Bad time?”

“No no no… I’m just… thinkin’.”

“What an atrocious sin, oh how hell will punish you.” He cracked a meek smile. 

A humming chuckle rose in my throat but died there as well. He walked in, the suit was a dark shade of red today, nigh-black, and sat next to me on the couch after shutting the door softly. “Your kid?”

“Mhm. Elie. He’s 3 here and I swear he’s the cutest kid ever born.” My stomach dropped and fiery guilt swelled but swiftly died.

“I’d be hard pressed to disagree.”

“I uh, would work for days every October to help him choose what costume he wanted, Then we’d go get the materials and spend a week pouring our hearts into it- till it was perfect. Then he’d go out, and get maybe… 3 pounds candy. Guess how long that bucket would last?”

“2 days.”

“N– Yeah! Without fail! 2 days it’d empty and he’d say the same thing: ‘Never again dad, never again.’ I did everything to make him the happiest he could be. Make him know he was loved.” Gently, so gently I had at first thought the picture floated from my hands, Lou took the picture and stared at it with a distant glimmer in his eye.

“He’s in a better place now.”

Tears flowed again. “I hope so… If I had it my way, he’d be in his room right now, building some skyscraper with his magnet tiles. But, maybe he is. Just not here.” A rock grew in my throat and an opaque haze blurred my vision. “I’m sorry for… all this- can i get you coffee or a sandwich or something?”

“No no… I just wanted to swing by and say hi, I gotta unpack and’ll be at it all day.”

“I could help ya if you need?”

“No, I got a legion on payroll. After they get done doing all the grunt work, I’m gonna put on some blues and decorate till I’ve got no wall space left.”

“How far down the way are you?”

“You know the fork in the road, about a mile or two…” He conjured a mental map, “That way.” He gestured west. “The yellow one. 

“Oh… The manor house?! Wow… you’re *rich* rich.” 

“Yeah, she’s a nice place, no damned AC, but I’ve been through worse than heat.” He tapped the picture with his index finger then opened, and swiftly closed his mouth.

“What?”

“Oh nothing… I was just gonna ask… ask if I can keep this?” He looked queasily at me, embarrassed.

My lip pulled back behind my teeth, then relaxed. “Yeah… I got plenty.” 

He brightened. “Thank you!” He stood up and set his hand on my shoulder. “You were a good dad.”

“Thank y-” I barely remained intact. “Thank you.” And he left.

I went to bed that night with an alarm set for 4:00 so I could wake up, adjust, shower, dress, and get coffee made by 5:15 all to be ready by 5:30 for Immanuel. REM came quicker than usual and similarly, left quicker than typical. 

*Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap*

2:52am, the clock on my nightstand blared in red dashes. I sat up- floaty headed- and lurched towards the door out of my bedroom; sluggishly traveled down the hall, shambled down the stairs, and peeped through the peep hole. Lou stood facing away from the door in a maroon suit. I swung it open and was met with his smile, he had been facing the door; hadn’t he.

“Lou?” I grunted.

“Moses! I’m glad you’re up. May I come in?”

I hesitated, confused. “Ye- yeah, of course.” As he entered, I spotted that he held the picture of Elie in his hand. 

“I need to talk to you, my friend. Sit.”

“What’s up?” I said, more awake now.

“What I’m about to say… it’s gonna sound weird.”

“What?”

He rolled his tongue along his lips.”You’re son. How did he die?”

“Wha-”

“How did he die?”

“Don’t ask me tha-”

“Moses.” His face lost all luster and kindness.

“When the car… spun out: the back passenger seat slammed in a pole and… he was– Why are you asking me this!?”

Lou answered swiftly. “Who was the drunk driver that day?”

“No… please no.”

“Who?”

I began to weep. “Me… I had gotten… and I thought I could manage… but the rain… I lost control.” Lou dove to my feet, his hands cupping my face and directing my eyes towards his.

“Shush, shush… it’s okay, it’s okay. Look at me. I know the pain you feel. All too well. And- and… can help you. I can bring him back.”

“Wh-”

“I’ve done it before, brought people back from the other side. Myself a time. You can see Elie again. Have Elie again. all yours, like before.”

“How– No, no! It’s not right.”

“It’s perfectly right, because it’s what you want. Here.” His index finger tapped my heart. “I know, because I know it all.”

“How?”

“You just have to ask.”

“That’s… That’s it?” Lou nodded. My lips trembled and my body quaked. “Can you bring my son back?”

“Yes.” His hand rose, and so did mine. It glided forward then recoiled as my phone rang up the stairs. I turned to face Lou and he shrugged. “Now or never.” Without a thought, my hand swam forward, and shook his. “Congrats my friend. All things are how they should be.” My racing heart eased its pace and we both smiled. “Better go get that call.” He chuffed.

I dashed up the stairs, all hope and joy and passion reignited. Love came back to vocabulary. I raised the phone to my ear. “Hello?” I chirped.

“Why did you shake his hand?” Immanuel sobbed.

“What? Immanuel- what’s wrong?”

“I told you we’d see him in the garden someday. Did you want it that bad? Was it worth your soul?”

“What?”

“You could have saved yourself… I made you to be wise… how could you think so little?” And the call ended.

“Moses… He’s back.” He shouted. *Lou* shouted. Lou One. Low One. I dashed downstairs, tripping halfway down and riding my spine to the ground. I scrambled up and panned my gaze to Lou. Elie stood beside him, eyes wet with tears. “Say: Hi, Elie.”

“No!” I wailed, cascading to my knees.

“Yes…” I fell to my side and wept against the planks. “Get up Moses. You don’t have much time.” I clambered to my knees and crawled into the living room.

“Elie.” I sniffled.

“Dad?” Elie murmured. “Are you okay?”

“No…” I broke down again. 

“Moses… Look at me.” He knelt to my side and pulled me to my knees. “You have 10 minutes. Heaven will only let him be out here for 10. Short. Minutes. Mo. You already paid, no point in crying. Spend this well okay?” His voice was new. It was slicker and polished. It was soft. It was kind. He removed his pocket square and cleaned off my face of the water works. 

I shuddered toward Elie who smiled now that my complexion was less glum. “How are you, Buckshot?”

“Good, Dad! I've been at this pretty garden with Immanuel. There are all these fruits that I didn’t even know existed!” His smile was as bright as the day I lost him. His voice as innocent and curious as everyday he’d woken up. 

“That’s amazing…” We talked for what felt like an eternity with an end. Each minute felt like some grand and critical part of the world was falling away, but also: that it was used to its fullest before its loss. He told me of relatives he met and friends he had made. He spoke of the food and the music. The wings in the sky. 

“I can’t wait for you to see it, Dad.” Some part of me knew, but a glance to Lou confirmed it. 

“It’ll be a while before I do… But, I’m sure the wait will be worth it.” I held my son as the last lie I’d ever tell him fell away from my mouth. His warmth grew then dulled. Lou walked to my side, Elie’s soft skin becoming gritty as whatever he was made of turned to dust on the furniture.

It broke back out, tears cleaning and dragging away spots of the dust. “I’m sorry Mo. I really am.”

“You’re a fucking liar.”

“The worst part is: I can’t be… I’m not allowed to not do… this to people. Most of the time, I enjoy it. I get to look evil souls in the face as they come to understand. But, cases like these… I wish I didn’t have to.”

“What do you mean?”

“I wish you could know.” His cheeks became wet. “I’m so sorry, I was begging you’d say no… Goodbye, Mo. I’m moving today.” And he left. 

Clarity fills me now. Of definitions I’ve given myself, this one is- unironically- the clearest. I have been given a profound understanding of how many things are watching everything you do. How many things cheer and jeer. How little they lie. That’s the part that still hurts. More than any other. 

Demons lie, and they fail because of it. But, the Devil will give you nothing but the truth, and that's why he will always get you. They call him the king of lies, but not once, not with me or any other human past, present, or future; has he ever lied. 

He smiles, dresses well. Smells of honey and speaks so compassionately. He’s gentle and kind- so, so, so kind. His face is never the same, but it’s always only his. He will look like you least expect, but most enjoy. He will ask for little things, and soon he’ll ask for everything; and you’ll give it to him. 

You only have one hope. If you hear a knock (3 taps, 3 times) on your door and  the man on the other side of the door is dressed in a deep red suit that could almost be mistaken as black, don't answer. Just pray and unlock the door. Because if he is at yours, you deserve whatever is coming.
