Most mornings, when I'm getting ready for the day—brushing my teeth, fixing my hair—I'll catch myself in the mirror.

You'd think that after a lifetime of seeing your reflection, you'd have a good sense of your appearance. Right?

I've heard that your perception of yourself differs from how others see you, but I've always known what I look like.

I'm just me, plain and simple. My name is James, and I'm 28 years old.

Occasionally, whether it's a stranger or some casual acquaintance, somebody will tell me that I look like a celebrity. Or someone they know.

I never knew any of them well enough to make that kind of connection, and the celebrity stuff always threw me.

This isn't something that's ever happened with the people close to me; it's only ever been people in my outer circle or beyond that. And it's something that's only been happening more recently.

One day, a year ago, someone told me, "Hey, you look like Keanu Reeves!" The next time it happened, I was told I looked like Brad Pitt; another day, I looked like Tom Cruise.

One time, a lady told me that I looked like the spitting image of her brother. Another time, somebody came up to me all buddy-buddy, acting like we go way back, only to be mistaken. You get the idea.

I always found it strange how wildly the comparisons varied, but ultimately, it didn't affect me, so I shrugged it off.

It doesn't make sense, though. I never thought I looked like any of those celebrities. So why do I look so familiar to complete strangers?

Sometimes, I wonder if they were even seeing me—the *real* me.

I want to share a bit about myself so you can better understand my situation. I live in the town of Larkspur, Colorado, with my mother; her name is Ashley.

She's kind-hearted and always had my back. I'm fresh out of college with my bachelor's and still haven't landed a career, so she's letting me stay with her for now.

Well, not just me. My daughter, Zoey, is here with us as well. She's five years old and the light of my life. Everything I do in life, I do for her.

I got clean—for good—for her. I went to college for her. And now, I’m trying to build a future for us both.

The only reason that I've more or less gotten my shit together was because I wanted to give her the same happy life that my mom gave me growing up.

You see, I never met my father, not even once. Not that I'm sad about it or anything.

I mean, how can you be unhappy about someone you never knew? Like mother-like son, I suppose. Neither of us needed my father.

I've always loved it here; the mountains, the quiet, the nature. Wouldn't trade it for anything.

It's a peaceful town. Aside from the Renaissance Festival, a pub, a few restaurants, and a park, not a lot going on. My daughter loves the park, though.

Some nights, after Zoey's in bed, I'll stop by the pub just down the street. Everyone knows each other for the most part. Small-town stuff.

Sometimes, I'll go with my mom, sometimes with a couple of buddies I've known since high school. If you grew up in a small town, then you probably understand.

There's a girl who works there, Jennifer. She's new in town. Last night, I finally asked for her number, and she said yes.

I tried to play it cool but left the place blushing, my heart on fire. I waited until today to text her so as not to seem desperate, and we've been chatting it up for a few hours.

I was sitting in the living room tonight, watching TV with Zoey and our dog Luffy (big anime nerd here). I was introducing her to Dragon Ball Z; we're in the Saiyan Saga.

Zoey and I were on the sectional couch, and my mother sat in the adjacent reclining chair. Her face, half-asleep, was buried in her sewing book.

Something weird happened as I sat on the couch with my daughter curled up comfortably on my side. I heard a voice behind me.

A faint whisper. I turned around to look at the staircase and hallway directly behind us, but there was nothing.

"What's wrong, Daddy?" said Zoey.

"Nothing, dear, just thought I heard something," I said back, wondering if that was real or just in my head.

A few minutes passed, and Nappa had just killed Piccolo. Gohan was devastated, but I've seen this part a thousand times. I was just excited that she got to see this.

Suddenly, I froze. I couldn't move at all. The whispering returned—no direction, no source. Just a low murmur closing in from all sides.

I couldn't distinguish any of the words, though. They were unintelligible. I still couldn't move and felt immense pressure rising from every direction.

The intrusive whispering started getting louder and more exasperated as the peripheral of my vision narrowed into a single point.

Tunnel vision—I’ve had it before, but not like this. Not in years. Then, I came back, and it all stopped.

I gasped, inhaling all the stolen air back into my lungs. So hard that Zoey and my sleeping mother jumped in surprise.

"What happened? Are you okay, James?" my mother said, obviously worried.

"Just... tunnel vision. Freaked me out, but I'm okay. Sorry I scared you," I replied.

I needed some air. I could fool them, but something was wrong with me. What the fuck just happened?

I haven't felt helplessness and fear like that in a long time. I stepped outside for a cigarette.

I know—it's a bad habit, but I'm trying to quit. I never do it around my daughter. The air helped, a little.

I started to feel better, so I buried what just happened. There wasn't anything I could do. I drank some water, put Zoey to bed, and tucked Luffy in beside her.

She was still worried about me, so I told her I was alright and loved her more than anything else. This helped her. I read her a bedtime story and kissed her on the forehead.

"Sleep tight, princess." With that, I closed the door as she dozed off.

"You haven't had tunnel vision like that since you were a kid. Are you sure you're okay?" my mom whispered, standing outside the door.

"I don't know. But it's over now, and I do feel better. Thanks for checking on me. I love you," I said back to her. She put her arm on my shoulder, and with a smile, she hugged me and said her piece.

"I love you too. I know this is a difficult time in your life, and you may be unsure of the direction you need to take. But you're smart, and life will make more sense before you know it."

"Whatever pain you're dealing with right now won't even cross your mind a year from now. You should get some sleep."

I just nodded and gave her a smile. I went to get myself ready for bed. I preferred to shower at night, so that's what I did.

I was brushing my teeth in front of the bathroom mirror afterward. The steam from the shower hadn't cleared yet, so the mirror was still fogged, smeared from the shower and my nightly routine.

In the warm incandescent light, I caught a brief glimpse of myself. My face was hazy—just condensation, nothing alarming.

I wiped a clean circle into the mirror with my palm. But nothing changed. My face wasn't there. I squinted.

No—wait—it was almost there. Somehow, the incandescent light felt fluorescent now, cold, clinical, like it didn't belong.

The sound of the sink running water slowly faded as the vague details of my face crept behind the glass. The outline of my head and shaggy hair was there, as was a slight suggestion of cheekbones.

A blur replaced where my eyes, brows, nose, and lips should've stood prominently. Almost smearing into my face like wet paint.

Normally, my reflection would come into focus right away. But this time, it was wrong—flickering, unfinished, like it was buffering.

To put this in perspective, it looked like one of those photos where someone's moving, their face caught mid-motion and not quite obvious.

My eyes stood out as looking unreal—glassy, vacant, like a mannequin. I leaned in, and my reflection lagged behind like it didn't want to meet me.

What the fuck? I blinked and shook my head briefly; when I looked again, I was normal. It was me again.

I lied to myself and said it was due to the overwhelming stress I've been feeling lately. Yeah, that was it.

I haven't been getting much sleep lately, and the pressure of being a single father and pursuing a successful career has weighed heavily on my mind.

This could be a symptom. I've heard people hallucinate when they're stressed and sleep-deprived.

A small yet intrusive thought clung to the back of my mind: Was that really me? But again, I repressed it.

Nothing I can do, so there's no point lingering on anything. I rinse my mouth, splash some cold water on my face, turn off the light, close the door, and go to my room.

It's probably nothing. Sleep deprivation. Stress. My brain messing with me. I keep thinking about what people always say: "Hey, you look like—"

And after tonight, I'm not sure that's a compliment anymore. I'm not even sure it's true. Something felt off. Maybe I'm just overthinking.

I'm on my laptop, finishing a few job applications before passing out. Still, I figured I'd post here and ask—

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Or am I actually losing it? Just curious.

*I think.*
