I looked out of my window today since it's summer I thought I should write this to put my mind at ease, it's been five years since this nightmare began and no one talks about it, all people know is that when it's winter you don't go outside at night and you don't go into the woods. 

I live in Montana in a city in Cascade County known for its water falls on the riverthat goes through it, it's big enough that you don't know everyone but small enough that news travels fast, so when someone was found dead just outside of town everyone was talking about it. It started in the winter of 2019 when a body was found by a group of teenagers just outside of town heading to a well-known camping site. His name was James Moore, he had been mauled by somthing the sheriff said it could not be determined what exactly killed him, some said bear others said mountain lion, maybe even a pack of wolves but no one had a concrete answer just speculation people found it creepy and strange then moved on. 

Only two weeks later it happened again, on the road leading out of town a house owned by a young couple had been broken into and said couple had been killed, the woman had been killed in the bedroom ripped to shreds, the man had been killed in the living room and dragged up the side of the house and skinned, the back door had been torn off it's hinges. The whole situation made it seem like foul play, but many people pointed out the absurdity of someone dragging a dead body up the said of a bricks house, no one could make sense of it. 

I was just a young man with a part-time job I was just trying to get by in life, I lived in the more suburb part of town and one night I came as close to death as I would ever like. I had to walk home one night, Montana is notorious for shity weather in the middle of winter snow will melt and become slush only for it to get incredibly cold again and the slush becomes ice and car crashes ensue. This night was a warm warm one, for a Montana winter that is. I walked home hands in my pockets cursing myself for not getting gloves for some unknown reason. I walked down the street looking ahead of me as a gas station came into view, it was to the right of me and from my position I was to it's said and could see I into the alley behind it. My thoughts where on random things in my day-to-day but it all came grinding to a hult right as I saw something out of the corner of my eye in the alley. I saw a faint blue orb my unbearable curiosity was nagging at me to turned to the right and I saw it, all I could see though the inky vale was four blue eyes not like two different eyes but one thing with four damn eyes, it stared right at me but then I saw something moving above it's head mabey a tail or an arm? I ran as fast as I could. 

I don't remember the run home I just woke up in bead. I looked on the news and another body was found right behind that gas station. Two more where found the next month. That's how my town has been for five years, every winter it comes through town the number of victims are always different no set pattern, hell one year there where no victims just sightings. 

It's July now and I dread the changing of the seasons, I write this because I have never been able to sleep right because of it. Have a nice summer everyone.
