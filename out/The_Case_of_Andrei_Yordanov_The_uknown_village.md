 “They keep dancing how – the children, the women, oh god their feet”

Please start from the beginning I had replied. The man before me stood frozen in fear, his eyes wide open while constantly zoning out before talking. He did not move, but there were subtle twitches in his eyes and mouth, while his fingers fiddled while sometimes scratching his hands, a clear sign of anxiety.

**Andrei Yordanov, age 23, undiagnosed – Possible signs of Post Traumatic Disorder, Anxiety and perhaps early stages of mental instability.**

This is the 3^(rd) session after we had found him and I must say each session becomes more worrisome. He was found unconscious near a river bank just 40 kilometers of the closest main city of Kartzali in Bulgaria. He was dressed in traditional menswear, while he had bruises and minor wounds along his body and face. Parts of the clothes were torn but what shook us more where his feet.

The sole of the leather shoes were torn off revealing his foot sole, whatever was left of it that is. It seems as if the man has walked barefoot through concrete or rough asphalt, as the skin seemed shredded and scrapped revealing parts of the bone even. Some of the fingers dangled barely on muscle tissue while covered in dried blood and soil.

Although his physical state had been stabilized, I cannot say the same for his mental health, for with every passing session it seems that it deteriorates. From his medical history, we had seen that he was rather healthy individual and never showed signs of madness nor anything that would indicate that he was diagnosed with any mental instability. From what I had transcribed by him recounting some memories from the events that took place before we found him I suspect that he was subjected to some form of terrors that was beyond his understanding.

Following is a summary of the transcribed sessions of Andrei.

“It was a pleasant Saturday afternoon, I had left my home city of Plovdiv in order to visit my grandparent’s village near the outskirts of Krumovgrad. My plan was to stay for the weekend and return by Monday so I could attend my afternoon classes.  As per usual, I took the ordinary route I always take, which takes me through Asenovgrad and then about 20 minutes

I can reach Kartzali, approximately a 40 minute drive. However much to my surprise that day there were some road maintenance that caused me to detour through a different route which added about additional 20 minutes. Half an hour into the drive, my GPS signal got lost causing me to miss an exit resulting in me driving towards the region of Pamporovo, which was initially not the direction I was heading at all. “

Andrei paused for a moment, and took a big breath before continuing, his eyes were sunken into thought, as his next words or perhaps phrases were equally weird to him.

“I remember… how suddenly the weather changed from a semi cloudy day to a full on over casted sky. Thinking that I would add the closest village and perhaps try to retour was the best option I tried to maintain this road in hopes that would lead me somewhere. The GPS signal was getting worse and I could barely rely on it, but the worst part was the sudden downpour than came down on me.

The rain made the driving more treacherous as the one sided road became suddenly quite slippery, there were various moments where in sharp turns I thought I would have certainly fallen due to my visibility being almost none. It wasn’t until I found a small opening on the side of the road where I pulled over and thought that perhaps I could wait the rain die out. I was quite high in the mountain, and I could tell by the lack of signal in this area along with the various street houses that can be seen far in the distant. But alas my misfortune in this tale has barely began.

Whilst contemplating my choices inside the safety of my car the sounds of pouring rain intensified hitting the rooftop. The tapping grew stronger, but the use of my air conditioning inside the car made me feel rather cozy and safe. My window shield was covered with water splashes every second, while outside a slight mist could be seen. I laid back to relax a bit and in hopes that the rain would eventually as I said stop.

I woke up abruptly as my mind had seem to realize that I should have been awake, and immediately felt the difference in the temperature around me. It took me moments to realize what was happening as my mind was still in this dreamy state of mind. The outside sky was no longer grey but dark, in the distance I could see street lights indicating again how high in the mountain I was.

*“*No, no no – this cannot be happening*”* I said as I quickly checked my phone and noticed that it was past six o’clock in the afternoon.

“Damn it, I cannot believe this! – And still no fucking signal? This is absurd!

Okay Andrei, calm down, I will just send the message and retry once I get signal, and I will just have to drive carefully. Thank God the rain had stopped at least.”

However upon trying to start the ignition, to my surprise the car would not start. Noticing the battery icon on the dashboard filled me with rage, causing me to slam my fists onto the steering wheel. The horn sounded in the silence, echoing across the mountain making me realize how alone I was at this moment, and how vulnerable I have become.

I decided to exit the vehicle and stand near the edge of the road in hopes to see someone coming to ask for aid. The air was cold, and I could sense it cutting through my thick coat nonetheless, making me shiver, the only light was the near full moon whose light reflected onto the muddy road, the sky seemed to be clearer now allowing for this miracle to occur.

I stood about ten minutes outside my car whilst having a cigarette when I finally noticed two small dots in the distance. I was ecstatic, so without hesitation I rushed into the road in hopes the man would stop. The dots seem to become bigger and finally shining so bright that blinded me, I walked back at the edge of the road while the unknown vehicle pass by me. I tried to peek and see whether the vehicle has stopped, but the light was still flashing into my eyes.

“Hey, please stop” I yelled in desperation, coughing in the process as the exhaust smoke filled my lungs.

It was an old looking red pickup truck who had halted about five meters to where I stood. The sound of a handbrake was heard, while the roaring engine broke the silence. I quickly rushed to the side passenger’s window and knocked on it, and ultimately it slowly began to come down. The silhouette of an old man came into view, the reflection from the headlights and the moonlight shining through his window revealed partially his grizzly face. His beard was greyish and short while he wore a marine cap and what appeared a woolen overcoat.

“Hey sir, thanks for stopping, my battery died do you have a battery starter pack or a working phone to call the tow service?”

He didn’t respond immediately, in fact he did not even turn to look at me. His cigarette burned almost reaching his moustache but the man did not flinch as only a puff of smoke came of his mouth, before taking a glance outside his window towards the sky.

“Hello, do you speak Bulgarian?”  I repeated. The man then slowly panned onto me, his eyes glinted as he finally spoke with his deep and raspy voice, the one you can occasionally hear from a heavy smoker.

 “I am sorry, I was – tired- I see you need help”.  He inhaled sharply, and took another puff, while taking a glimpse from his rear window.

“I have no such tool that you seek – but my village is just – five minutes away from here, I returned from my farm and we can ask some of the locals there”

He took another puff before getting some of his stuff from the passenger’s seat and opening me his door.

I was hesitant, his demeanor was strange, but nonetheless I was running out of options. I know it was foolish to join him but it was either stuck here in the freezing cold with no idea where and what to do, or miss out on a potential exit. His interior is what you would expect from an old farmer in the mountains, a messy and dusted dashboard, while bottles, tools, bags with fruits and veggies to be scattered onto the floor. The smell of dust and cigarettes would hit you immediately but it was bearable.

“So what’s the name of the village” I finally asked hoping to find it into the offline mode of the maps I had.

He did not answer directly, he always seem to be slow in his response, but given the fact that he might be just tired I often would not think about it much.  We made a sharp turn, and then he looked at my direction and said:

“Oh it’s a joyful village- Tanchovo” he said finally after short pause, before taking a cigarettes out of the box with his mouth.

“You want some- these are good”

The brand was something I haven’t seen before, I guess an old brand Bulgarian one for sure for in Cyrillic it wrote Rodopi, the name of the mountain range.

While puffing at the strange cigarettes I tried locating this village, but much to my dismay I could not see it anywhere near the area I was last located neither through the search bar. I could feel the anxiety overwhelming me as if slowly becoming worried about the whole situation.

“Tanchovo-  hmm never heard of it” I murmured.

The man did not respond at least for a solid two minutes which felt like eternity to me. Then without any warning after a sharp turn, he shook my shoulder causing me to unglue myself from the screen. 

With his thick and rough index finger he pointed towards the road, and there I finally saw it. Up ahead reflecting at the light emitting from the trucks headlights a bright white sign came into view.

“Tanchovo welcomes you”

I sighed in relief, as my worries seem to drown a bit. The road became bumpier and one could see the decrepit buildings left and right. Old stone houses with torn down walls and sunken rooftops, a clear evidence of another forgotten and unkempt Bulgarian village. The street lights would illuminate little, and there you could see broken windows who within an abyssal darkness would lurk. Under the same light, one could see the morbid decorations of the wooden electric poles, hundreds of obituaries just plastered all over the pillars and even walls of houses, this village must has seen a lot of death.

Few minutes had passed and we have already reached the village’s center, there the scene could be seen as more welcoming as some lights from the nearby houses could be seen illuminating. He parked in a parking spot just outside the village’s church which loomed over us. Its entrance and tower were visible by the encircled light posts around the center. My feet splashed onto a small poodle just I exited the vehicle, and I began to observe the wet cobblestone ground, the air was fresh as scents of pine and other floral hints could be picked up.

 

 

I took a moment to admire the surroundings, although even in the darkness one could not dismiss the once blooming beauty of this place. The once white plaster walls of the stone houses now are peeled and cracked as if the skin of a rotting corpse, the ceramic roofs would cave in as the wooden supports are soaked and rotten from the water they had absorbed, other houses would be unfinished as one can see the brick layout and uneven paint jobs, a rather depressing sight.

The moon shined above us, gleaming and somehow making me feel safer as the clouds seem to have dissipated and made way for its light to wash over the village.  The man walked before me and with a quick nod he indicate me to follow him. I followed him while maintaining some distance, whilst still trying to get some signal at my phone, something that proved to be quite pointless. I sighed from frustration and I could see the old man before me giving me a slight smirk as his cigarette burned into the night.

We eventually halted before a small well decorated house, for what I could understood was a tavern. The old man took his final puff and flicked the burning filter outside before taking a nice inhale through his nose and proceed to spit to the ground. He turned around and with his raspy voice he exclaimed:

“Why don’t you join me for some drink, it has been a stressful day and I know it’s not late but you got some time, I figure you must be hungry”

I was a bit upset, I simply wanted a battery pack to start my car and get it over with, but alas he was my only ride here so I was kind of stuck.

“Can we have a quick one and then please get my car started, I really need to go today to my grandparents”

The old man smiled in what I can now recall a more sinister smile but then I could have not placed it under such terms.

“Oh you will see them no worry, plus my mechanic Michael could be here…. He could probably fix your…. ehm…. Car.

 



We entered the tavern and I was immediately greeted with the contrast of the outside world. There were nearly 20 people inside, almost perhaps the whole village. They all stopped what they were doing, and I could see their eyes following us from the moment I entered the tavern. None of them spoke for a brief five minutes, until we finally reached a small empty table near the corner.

The place was warm as the huge fireplace burned in one of the ends of the tavern, people began slowly speaking back to their usual stuff making it more alive than ever. There was a sensation of relaxation in here, as if we were safe. A young girl came to our table, probably around her mid -20s with a long blond braid going down her waist, and those eyes of her- my god- deep green eyes that I simply got lost into.  I think the old man ordered some homemade brandy and a platter of various meat cuts and cheese, and from there I remember very little.

I have visions that we drank the first bottle, we were chatting for long about some traditions and that the village is very famous for its dancing tradition. At some point I remember traditional music being played, a man dressed in old clothes started playing the accordion while another man the bagpipe, more people joined after wards and it was an orchestra at this point.

I remember the girl was at our table at some point and the old man had left, or we joined another table by ourselves? I have no idea.

The next thing I remember was waking up by the sun hitting my eyes. And upon opening them I saw the semi opened window before me. I startled and got up while realizing that my head felt heavy. It took me a minute to register my surroundings.

The room was partially illuminated by the morning sun, but I could see it looked like a very old inn sort of house. The iron bedframes, the wooden cabinets and the carpets on the wall was of typical fashion. I wore a long white linen shirt and next to me I felt some slight movement, I turned to the other side of the bed only to see that tightly wrapped under the blankets was this girl from last night. I think her name was Nastia… or was it…. Nadezdha? I am not sure to be honest.

I got up hoping to make the least amount of sound possible, but as soon as I placed my foot on the wooden floor I could hear the cracking sound echoing in the room. I slowly turned around and I saw her open eyes facing me.

“Up so soon?” she murmured, “we still got time to rest you know.  She slowly got up revealing her uncovered torso. Her hands wrapped around my shoulders as she softly spoke to my ear.

“The festivities won’t start until noon you know”

I was still taken aback and I haven’t yet processed the situation, my mind was still in an alarming yet somehow comforting situation.

“Festivities? What festivities…. And my grandmother… God she must be worried” the final statement made me realize that I had spent the entire night in a random village when I simply wanted to fix my car.

I started running around the room looking for my staff while the girl simply watched me and smirked.

“I need to get to my car… my stuff where are they?”

“Here” she said as she opened her arms as if showing me the place.

“Here are your stuff silly”

I watched in awe as she got up the bed and wore her own long white gown. She came closer and took my hand and placed it at her waist.

“I think you need some breakfast to relax and then I will help you with your stuff”

She left the room leaving me alone for a brief moment, while I still pondered on what the hell had happened. I’ve spend at least five minutes searching this damn room only to find nothing of my own. There were some traditional pants and some other garments folded neatly onto the wooden chair. Feeling the cold wind coming from the window I decided to wear them.

The breakfast was mostly silent, as she rarely spoke and I was too baffled and too deep into my own thoughts to when and how I was about to leave this place. It wasn’t until the front door opened and an elderly woman came in the house.

The young woman immediately got up and walked towards her. I couldn’t hear what they were saying but I could see sometimes they would glance at me, giving me the impression that perhaps something involving me was being discussed.

Nadezdha finnaly came and stood near me, she leaned and whispered to me in her soft voice. I must admit, that although my mind was racing with thoughts of how I wished to leave this strange place and the need to escape, her voice was majestic, as if ethereal. It captivated me, I felt like a sailor being drawn to its death by a beautiful siren. And her gentle hands – oh God, when she wrapped them around my shoulders- all the weights I carried seem to vanish.

“Honey, I will go change and my mom will help me I will be back soon.”

Before I would mutter any word, she left along with her mother to the upstairs floor. I could hear the sounds of the stairs creek as they ran. Soft giggles would be heard as well as some indistinguishable phrases.  I honestly felt this was my time to leave, but again there was this feeling that something was wrong, as if I shouldn’t.

The front door was left semi open, and I could see the light coming through it. My chance of escape was laid before me, yet somehow I was being conflicted, I don’t know why I was struggling. I barely know these people, yet something was calling me- something was telling my heart to stay.  I do not know why I decided to stay, in hindsight I would have just stormed outside, but in reality even if I did, I still had no idea where I was exactly.

While pondering on the options, I heard rapid footsteps coming from upstairs, and then they slowed down as they made their way downstairs. With each step the wooden stairs creaked, and I could hear her mother singing in a low tune, as if humming. Nadezdha finally came down the stairs and stood next to me, and she was simply stunning in more ways I could imagine.

 She wore a white dress with red and green embroidery on the sleeves, a typical red apron with geometrical designs was secured on her waist and as per typical Bulgarian fashion the Thracian golden belt buckle was in the center.  Her floral headdress adorned with coins on the forehead and sides would shimmer under the light coming from the nearby window.  She seemed emotionless, strict if I may say, as if a looming melancholy was surrounding her. Her mother’s singing equally subdued but it felt solemn by that time, but in my ears I could not focus on it, for my focus was only targeting Nadezdha.



She came closer and reached out her hand in which I took without hesitation. But once I grasped her soft palm, she began heading towards the exit as if guiding me. While stepping outside the house I felt a sweet breeze washing over me. The cobble stone paths were wet from an apparent rain, and I could feel the freshness in the air. The scent of pines and evergreen gave me comfort, and for once I could feel serenity within this uncertain situation.

Not too long though has this silence lasted, for I heard the sounds of drums and bagpipes in the distance, as if slowly making its way towards the street we were standing in. Nadezdha did not flinch to the sound, not even bothering with its existence, she seemed to be entranced in her own way, and her gaze was simply fixated to the house before us. I asked multiple times on the purpose of this music and on what was going on but alas I received no answer.

The sounds of traditional music came ever closer and I could start seeing people approaching playing their instruments followed by more people. Suddenly I noticed that more people came outside their homes and stood near the doorframe. We all just watched and waited the parade to come closer so we could join. And as expected, when the players bypassed us Nadezhda without any hesitation, pulled me into this organized chaos.

We marched for a couple of minutes around the village gathering more people until we finally met in a familiar place. Almost the whole village, comprised of both elderly, young people and children stood in the village’s center. Nadezhda, turned her eyes to me and for once I could see some form of emotion, she put her hand in her red sash and slipped me something in my hand while leaning to my ear and giving me a small kiss on the cheek.

“Put these in your ears- but  subtly- don’t ask questions”

There was something soft in my hands, with a texture of oily clay, I took a subtle glimpse and it was some form of candle wax, similar to the ones used in church candles. Two small balls were in my palm so without any hesitation at this point I obliged to her command. I took a glimpse around and I saw everyone was focused on the band that slowly made their way into the center while the people slowly started arranging themselves in a circle holding hands.  I managed to stick the candle wax deep into my earholes muffling most of the sounds immediately.

 

I turned and saw that Nadezhdas ears were empty, and her eyes began to water. She perhaps noticed that I was watching her for she turned to me. There was a smile, a smile of regret and sadness. Pity was well engraved in her expression, but she quickly turned to face the band in which appeared to stop. Some men came close to the center carrying a wooden platform with bunch of wooden planks and placed it in the center, followed by a local priest and two young children carrying some church banners.

The priest began walking around and blessing the participants followed by the younglings. In the meantime the men began assembling quickly the platform and on it they started placing the planks in some sort of pyramid shape, while some other men began adding some hay to its base. Of course the first thought to mind was some form of burning pyre, but most holidays where much later so I was rather confused as to what this was.

The priest came near me eventually, his face was stern, his expressions seemed cold and fixated as if eager to get it over with. The scent coming from the thurbile was particular, nothing familiar as to the one that I had ever had in church growing up. It felt earthier and somewhat sweet as if someone mixed dirt and flowers and gave off a scent. It reminded me of early spring, after rain.

Once the blessing was done the priest and the children took their place around the circle as well, no speech seemed to have been delivered but on everyone’s eyes there was a sign of sort of sadness and seriousness.

“*What the hell is going on-“*

Before my thoughts could finish, two of the men that constructed the pyre lit it on fire. And soon the band began to play, I could faintly hear the music through the wax-plugs, it was still there but not as strong. I noticed the people beginning to dance, a dance in which I was familiar with but haven’t done in a while”

Andrei paused for a moment before continuing his story. His eyes were fixated on his laps, his hands tightened in grips as if his memories were becoming more vivid.

“What was the dance Andrei?” I asked.

He took a moment before he could answer.

“Kopanitsa” He eventually whispered, as if daring to say its name.

Andrei exclaimed and eventually after couple of minutes he had continued his story.

“So we began dancing, the music penetrated my ears and I could barely hear it to its fullest, but there was a trance sensation something that came over me that I could not stop. I do not remember how much I danced but what remember was the horrors that I’ve witnessed.  As we danced, I saw a young girl maybe mid twenty’s falling slipping and leaving the circle. The remaining participants did not care however, they began walking over her stepping her with each step. Her white dress immediately was covered with blood as her face was barely recognizable.

Worst part was when I came closer to her, and I also stepped over her, I could feel the wet blood splashing on my socks and being soaked. But I could not stop, I somehow didn’t want to!

Minutes later more people began dropping like flies, the worst part was these two kids that we stepped over crashing their small hands and backs. I could not hear screams, only the beating of drums and sounds of bagpipes. I closed my eyes for a moment, and I swear I thought it was only for a couple of minutes, or so I thought.

Before me was pitch darkness, only the fire illuminating the center, more bodies were covering the floor and making more difficult to dance, but the rhythm grew ever more stronger. At some point I could not see faces anymore, it felt as if I was driving in the highway full speed. The light from the fire became one and was circling around me and it was blurry, I felt tired, I felt my feet burning and below me I felt the rough texture of bones and cobble.

It was in this haze where I closed again my eyes, and once again I was surprised at what I saw. Sun was rising before me and people were far less than the ones we began with, Nadezdha was still next to me but I turned and saw her face was equally tired, as dark circles were formed underneath her eyes. The rays of sun washed over me, and I felt its warmth, but I felt the dizziness, I tried to distinguish some shapes but it was unrecognizable, but the music seemed more faded much more than before. My neck leaned back and I stared at the sky spinning, and I was praying to anything to unleased me from this curse.

Soon enough through my ears, I could hear a whisper, as if someone calling me. I looked to my right and I saw Nadezhda holding my hand, her mouth lips were dry, not as red and plump as the night I saw her, which I have hard time remembering when it was. Her voice reached to me somehow through this chaos.

A miracle? I do not know honestly!

“Now… that the music is not as strong…Leave”

With one motion she released my hand, and halted immediately. This caused me to fumble but she pushed me backwards leaving the other hand that I was holding. I rolled back somehow and everything was spinning for way longer. I tried to stand at all fours but the dizziness was so strong that I lost orientation. I think at some point I looked at the direction of the dance and the figures were slowly making sense again, but I did not care I crawled into an unknown destination until the last thing I remember.

I remember falling through foliage, and as if rolling my vision was blurry and still disoriented. Next thing I know is I was laying in the hospital. I do not know where this place was, I do know how I exited this horrendous place. But god damn it was it horrible. The bones, the blood the children the men and women it was a mess. And they danced! They kept dancing! -  And I danced probably over her even for I know!”

Andrei finally broke down in tears and that was the last part of the sessions so far. Everything he mentioned was beyond queer and strange. The strangest part was while speaking to some of the detectives that were on this case, is that everything happening in “Tanchovo” is beyond peculiar, as such village does not exist in the maps. At least in modern ones, and in a much different location.

 

**Notes for self:**

Kopanitsa a type of national dance which the dancers follow the rhythm of the music and increase their dancing speed as the music progresses to a faster tempo. Usually is danced by huge groups and one common feature of its style is the constant spiral pattern that occurs. As the participants dance around a circular motion, they create a spiral shape which grows smaller and smaller towards the center before unraveling again and continuing.
