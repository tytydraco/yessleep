I live in Charlotte but my family is from Brazil so maybe this is just a Brazilian thing, but whenever I would get lost in like a mall or Costco as a kid my dad had this whistle he would do, it sounds something like a bird call, it would reverberate and pierce through any crowd, and I would respond by mimicking the whistle so we could find each other, did anybody else's parents have something similar?

 I didn't make this post just to ask that question but it was on my mind since I've been reminiscing, my family has an old cabin up in Ashe county that we liked to spend our time in during the summer, it was nothing special, little more than a stack of logs and a roof but I always enjoyed the time we spent there. It's situated at the edge of town just off the main road on top of a bit of a hill with the woods behind it. The whole place is a very peaceful area, the kind of place where you could just sit on a porch swing and let time bleed away. And I've been sent up early to get the place sorted for everyone else coming in the summer (my immediate family and a few relatives coming over from Brazil). The place is a bit of a mess considering it's been a few years since we've come up here, thankfully there ain't any rats or mold however there's enough dust to swim in.

Even though I'm here by myself it's been alright having something productive to do whilst out of university, but the thing is I've been hearing it, the whistle that my dad would do. It's been coming from the forest near the cabin and at first I thought it was just the wind or maybe a bird but it's just too familiar, it sounds exactly the same as when my dad would do it. Maybe I'm just hearing things but the whistling has brought back a memory from my childhood, I couldn't have been older than 7 at the time and I've received too much head trauma playing football in highschool to have a picture perfect memory so forgive the lack of detail.

I was playing around the back of the cabin with our dog, Canela, while my dad was grilling something and mom was taking care of my younger brother up on the patio, form the patio there was only a little over 200 feet of cleared out space before you hit the edge of the forest which my parents would always tell me not to go wander off in. 

However I got distracted, Canela caught scent of a rabbit behind the trees and decided to chase after it, I went after it along with Canela, trying to keep up with her as much as my small kid legs would allow. But the rabbit had lost the both of us and I had gotten the both of us lost, I was a little worried about finding my way back but I could hear my dad whistling for me. so me and Canela headed in that direction, we were stopped on our path by a crow picking at the remains of the rabbit we had just been chasing. By this point my dad managed to catch up to us, appearing from behind, opposite the direction of the whistling. After dragging us out and back to safety I got an earful from both my parents about running around in the woods by myself, got a spanking for my trouble too.

I'm gonna head into town tomorrow morning and I'm planning on asking some of the locals if they know anything about the whistling but if y'all have any ideas that would be appreciated as well, I'll make a few edits down the line to keep you posted.

Edit 1: 
I wrote that last part in a fit of not being able to sleep last night so hopefully I'll be a little more concise with my ‘research’ today. I had breakfast at a local diner, it's the same diner that me and my family would all go to when we would visit, it's a quirky little place with old torn up leatherette on the seats in the booths, tobacco flowers on all the tables and instead of a regular bell that you would see at any other diner, this place had a cowbell. 

I got talking to a few of the locals asking them about birds in the area and what they sounded like, I mimicked the whistle the best I could but nobody seemed to have heard anything like it before. I got to talking to the owner about it, he's been running the place as far back as I could remember, he didn't know anything about the whistling but he did warn me not to get lost In those woods again and he told me the story that he would always tell me to scare me off from playing in the woods.

 In the town a long while, back before i was born, there was a Boy who live there, he liked to play hide and seek in the forest with his friends, his parents were fine with this as long as he was back for supper and the way his parents would call him back was by ringing “this very cowbell”, the Boy would always find his way back after hearing the bell and he wasn't ever late. This ritual would continue on for years and as the Boy grew up into a Man he would do the same practice with his Son, and his Son was always back for supper after hearing the bell. 

One day when his Son, and no matter how many times i was told this story over the summers he was always  “about your age”, he wanted to go exploring the forest on his own and the Man was alright with this ”as long as your back for supper”, but that day he was late, by the time he got home his food was cold and his coke was warm and flat (i'm pretty sure that the last detail was added in specifically for when the story was told to members of my family). And over that week the son would always come back home later and later into the evening until he didn't come home at all, the entire town searched for his son but he was never found and every day the Man would ring the bell before eating his supper but his Son never came home. 

While it's nice to visit the diner and speak to the townsfolk again, but this didn't give me any answers, I'll be heading into the forest after this to try and figure out what that whistling is.

Edit 2: 
  I've been walking around the forest for a bit now. It's quiet and the wind is calm, very picturesque, but something feels a bit off. I've been keeping a lookout for birds to see if the whistling was a bird call and I haven't seen any, like at all, not a single bird in this forest. Getting annoyed of this aimless wandering, I try and be more proactive, I whistle, I whistle again and again but there is no response. Next I make an  attempt to talk to the forest,
 “ hello? Is anyone there? Can you hear me?”
 I even try shouting my fathers name but I get nothing, the forest ignores me, the sound doesn't even echo. I have no idea why I thought that that would work, I haven't been here too long but maybe this place is getting to me, it is a little unnerving being here on my own. 

I've been here for about two hours. I was thinking about calling it a day but almost as if it knew the forest starts whistling again, I started following the sound but the sound never got any closer, it felt as if it were running away from me. I try responding with a whistle of my own, now the whistling coming from within the forest is clear, I feel like I know exactly where it is. I know this one is a little short but I'm going to put my phone away so I can focus on finding whatever is making this sound.
   
Edit 3: 
I don't know if what I saw was real, but I swear that I'm not crazy, I'm sitting on the ground on the edge of the forest writing this but you have to believe what I'm saying, please,  just for my sake. Just after the end of the last edit I spent some time pinpointing the location of the whistle. I would hear a whistle and respond with a whistle of my own each time getting closer until I reached the source of the whistle in a clearing in the forest.

In the clearing squatting around a disemboweled deer carcass were four creatures that made a mockery of all men created in god's image, they were massive, taller than me while still squatting, had three fingered birds feet, the torso and arms of a man that where disproportionately long with black feathers lining the arms from the wrist back that then draped off to form wings and a massive crows head. My fear anchored me to the ground, I couldn't move, hell, I couldn't breathe. They stared at me, uncaring for my presence, they did not move, they did not do anything but whistle, beckoning me to them. I finally manage to force my legs to run away but no matter how far I ran I could still hear the whistling and the further I ran the taller the trees got and the distance to the edge of the woods grew, but I managed to make it to what I hoped would be safety.

My blood ran cold as I found myself back at the clearing, this time they were much larger than before, still whistling but seemingly ignoring me, crowding around the corpse of a man. I nearly vomit when I see one of the creature’s beak pierce the man's stomach and then begin to scrounge around, it was not long before it was able to pull out one of the man's intestines, whipping its head back to swallow it whole. The other ones now begin to dig up the entrails of the man pinning him down and fighting over their share of his remains. Even though he seemed to be dead before they began to feast, there seems to be no intention of letting go, they still whistle at me between bites. I get out of there, my legs might break from how much force I’m exerting just to run. As I start making some distance I finally stop hearing the whistle and I start to hear the cowbell from the diner, I chase after the sound without a second thought.

Again I'm at the clearing, the creatures are cawing mimicking the cowbell, they seem to have found another victim. Two of them are offering a boy up to a third creature, the boy is still alive and screaming as the creature begins to pull at the boy's head, the skin on his neck slowly unravels to reveal the flesh underneath which then begins to stretch and tear open, the boy's screams begin to gargle as his blood flows into his throat. I can see his bones now and I can hear his tendons snap. It is agonizing to watch as his head becomes fully detached, no remorse is spared when the creatures cast aside his head which finally signals the last creature to rip out what remains of his spine and then vomit a putrid substance into the hole of the newly created carcass.     

I've been vomiting profusely since I escaped, moreover I cannot remember or even fathom how I made it out of the forest, they must have allowed me to leave. There is no way in hell that I will allow my family to visit this place. I've made up my mind, I will burn down the cabin and hopefully all memory of this place with it.
