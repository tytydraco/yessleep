My name is Andrew. I'm writing this because I can't fall asleep from all thats happened. I will try to write everything down this night because it could help me cope with all that just happened.

My mom died when she was giving birth to me at the local hospital. At least that's what they told me. Three years later my dad thought it was a good idea to leave me with my grandparents a state away in Colorado, in the hopes of getting himself and his thoughts on the same page. A few days later he went missing and was never found. I had to live with my grandparents in rural Colorado surrounded by forest and at least 5 miles away from any known civilization. What could possibly go wrong? I was homeschooled so I didn't have any friends back then. But at least i had a lovely grandma that would make me breakfast every single morning. She would make me chocolate cookies too, every friday and i would always eat them in one sitting. Not like she made much. My grandpa was the closest person i had to a father and he was an overall great person. When he needed to go for work far from the familiar mountains of Colorado, he would take me with him. He would say "Young men there's much more to this country than Colorado." I would ignore him like any teenager should and just went with him because it was fun. It's all like a distant dream a dream I woke up from years ago. but it wasn't and I can't come to terms with it.

I still remember vividly, it was around 7:30 in the morning and winter was in full swing by then, so an electric heater was a necessity.
My electric heater was pretty small about the same size as a basketball, so because of that i could basically put it anywhere I wanted and when summer started I decided to put it in the attic. I often went up there mostly to tidy the place and hide my smoking addiction from my grandparents.
To get to the attic you have to climb up a somewhat broken staircase and pray to god it doesn't break. When you climb up the staircase there is a small balcony leading you to an old wooden door, on it there is a poorly taped piece of paper that looks like it has been there for a decade or so and on it written with a black marker in a somewhat bold font "THE ATTIC". I still remember writing it and taping it on the wall when I was just 5 years old, my grandma was yelling at me "Young man get down from that stair case right now or you're going to hurt yourself!".

From when you open the door there's a small square shaped window kissing the roof, on the wall facing you.
On the left and right side there are two shelves, about 6 feet opposite from each. They are loaded with half broken electronics and a few photo albums from the 80's and 70's. I had put my electric heater on the top right corner of the left shelf right next to the small square shaped window.
So, I opened the door and set one foot in, it was warm, another and the cold winter air pierced through my skin. The small square shaped window had been opened and not for a few hours or even minutes but a few seconds. it was like it had opened on its own through the shearer will of mother nature.

I thought there was a logical reason why or how the window had been opened but I couldn't think of any. So I just brushed it off and closed the window. As I grabbed the electric heater from the shelf a notebook fell down with white covers, covers thicker than any other I've seen. on the front cover written with a black permanent marker with a somewhat bold font was written "THE LAST THREE YEARS OF MY LIFE"
When I first saw it, I couldn't stop looking at it. Seconds turned into minutes and I felt my soul slowly leaving my body. 

"Andrew honey you have been up there for ages, is everything okay?"

before i could even process the mere question, I felt my soul go back into my body, but I felt like I was missing a part of it. no it was replaced, replaced by a part of its soul or whatever that thing was. It made me sick, made me want to throw up. but I didn't and I managed to say that I was okay to my grandma. I didn't want my grandparents to know about this.

"Okay sweetie hurry up, breakfast is almost ready."

When I knew that my grandma went in the kitchen. I grabbed the notebook with my right hand and opened the attic door with my left. Went down the half broken staircase praying to god it didn't break, And made it to my room. I got out a box, underneath my bed, filled with clothes I had as a kid. Threw out all the clothes and put the notebook at the bottom. While trying not to look at it. I put all the clothes back in the box and put it under my bed. Just like before. I went to the kitchen where my grandparents were. I said good morning and sat at the table just like any other day. 

But My mind was infested with the question, Who really was my father? No matter what I did I couldn't get it out of my head. So the next day when me and my grandparents were having Dinner, I finally got the courage to ask my grandfather.

"Grandpa sorry but, who exactly was my father?"

His eyes widened, dropping the fork he healed firmly in his hand on to his plate of two fried eggs and a few bacon strips, my grandma made him. His eyes turned towards the blank wall behind me, twitching a little and taking deep breaths. All while my grandma just sat there staring into her plate. My grandpa finally took one short breath from his mouth, his eyes and head finally turned towards me as he was about to give me the answer I was so eager to get.

"Son, we don't talk about him anymore, he's dead to us."

They both slowly got up from their chairs. My grandpa rushed outside got in the truck and drove off into the night. The head lights barely lit the poor gravel road that leads to civilization And my grandma started cleaning up the table even though the food was still warm. 

Not only i wasn't given the answer I desired, but now I was paralyzed. Only being able to open and close my eyes every few seconds. Feeling hours had gone by. My eyes turned to meet the clock that was in the living room on the shelf above the new shine tv my grandparents bought. The two hands pointed at 12 a clock sharp, not moving an inch. Then I too got up from my chair, my body seemingly moving on its own. And walked down the small but empty and barley lit hallway leading to my bedroom, collapsing on to my bed. 

I asked my grandparents a few more times over the week but every time they would just stare at the hard Wooden floor for about half an hour.  Then they would continue on with their day just with one exception, ignoring me for the rest of the day. I got fed up so fed up I opened the box of clothes under my bed, grabbing the clothes out the box and throwing them on my bed. I knew it was a risk that I had to take if I wanted to know more about my father. 
So i got the box under my bed i opened it and began grabbing and throwing the clothes from the box on to the floor, i finally got to the notebook I sat down on to my bed and started going through the pages.

As I was flipping through the pages of what i thought was an empty jornal, only the desolate black rows hinting something had to be written, a small picture fell face first on to the hard wooden floor, giving of the stench of ink like it been printed mere seconds ago. There wasn't much to look at the back of the picture but when i turned it, not a thought crossed in my mind that the man i was looking at wasn't my father. Even tho the picture was messy at best and he looked of high school age he still looked like my father. there were Also minor mistakes, likely caused by an old beat up printer combined with human error. For example like the small purple ink drop on his left cheek or his eyes almost merging together where his nose was supposed to be, it had shook me to my core. it wasn't what i was looking for and yet my curiosity went through the roof.

I left the jornal and picture on the bed and i went to my grandpa. Who was sitting in the living room on the sofa watching tv with a can of shity beer by his side. The words started coming out of my mouth just as the river dumps its water is into the ocean "Grampa" i stoped for a second acknowledging the thought that he would ignore me just like all the other times i asked him yet still I needed to finish what I started. 

 "Grandpa, who really the was my father".

He inclined his had down towards the hard wooden floor, his eyes widen turning more red with every passing second. I yelled at him i even broke one of the glass cups that was conveniently placed on the dining table waiting to be thrown at the wall. he didn't even flinch he just kept on staring down at the cold wooden floor. And as the game ended and people started to cheer on the winers on the shine new tv i was not even bothered to clean up the pieces of glass tha had torn through the carpet. 

And as I was walking down the hallway littered  with pictures of my father up on the walls, I head footsteps coming from my room. at first I thought that it was my grandma but when I got closer to my door aicould hear who ever was in my room was jumping, walking and even running at times. Then I knelt down and put my ear to my rooms door but I couldn't shake the feeling that it wasn't mine anymore. Then it stopped it walked to the door and knocked where my ear was I jumped. Now standing I slowly went to the door handle and slowly turned it then I tried to open it but the door seemed stuck at least i told myself that. because it could have very well been the person or whatever it was, now not walking or jumping but stoping me from getting into my room.
I put my body on the door and Slowly butcherly began to push on it more and more. And then something cracked and the door opened. And what I saw that day was tiptoeing the line between reality and pure fiction. The jornal layed open on the cold floor driping blood from the thorn pages. The picture it too layed on the floor thorn from the neck up. What the heck do I do.
