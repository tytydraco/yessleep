I had a guy on my Snapchat for a few months, let's call him Dave. We initially connected on Tinder, where we exchanged some messages before he started sending me snaps daily.

One night, I asked for Dave's number because I wanted to get to know him better. He called me right away and we really hit it off at first. Strangely, Dave called me no caller  ID because he said he was calling from a work phone. But at the time this was not a concern.As we got to know each other, Dave opened up about his background - he was brought in by foster parents at a young age after something happened to his biological parents. His biological sister Emma, slightly younger than him, was also brought into the foster family later on.

He asked me about my family and I mentioned I  don‚Äôt really keep in contact  with my dad because of the vile things he's done in the past. Dave latched onto this and said he loves when girls have "daddy issues." He wants a girl who will call him daddy in the bedroom as well as ‚Äúdad‚Äù.This led to Dave making a series of extremely disturbing and concerning comments.

He claimed at age 13, he lost his virginity to someone much older. I expressed that he was a victim in that situation and but he tried to downplay it and said he "enjoyed" it at the time. Which made me feel at the time really bad for him because he was taken advantage of as a child. Dave then asked about my sexuality - I admitted to being bi-curious and interested in exploring with a woman.

That's when Dave spun an alarming tale of having a threesome with his biological sister Emma, who he said is bisexual. He claimed to have walked in on Emma having sex with an ex and decided to join them.Which I debated was incest and he explained it wasn‚Äôt anything like that. Dave later on set up for me to talk to Emma on Snapchat.She was great to talk to , we talked frequently we were even intimate at some point.Which I told Dave about and he told me he doesn‚Äôt really mind .As I continued to talk to her she brought up the threesome story, even saying she wanted to touch Dave's penis, implying an incestuous relationship.Which I found sickening especially since I developed a liking to her.

Dave sent me  photos of a large penis, claiming it was his own. He said his size previously caused him to send multiple women to the ER with bruised cervixes. I had actually asked Dave to prove his size out of curiosity, which is when he sent those photos. He then insisted repeatedly that I needed to "loosen" my vagina by sleeping with other men before we could have sex.I told that‚Äôs not necessarily how it worked but I do see where he was coming from to an extent and I asked wouldn‚Äôt it make him feel uncomfortable and insisted it doesn‚Äôt. Dave seemed to disapprove when I mentioned the two guys I had casually slept with in the past. Weirdly, he then reinforced I should sleep with this other man who had added me on Snapchat instead, let's call him Bob. I‚Äôm not sure how long Bob was on my ‚Äòadded‚Äô on Snapchat because I don‚Äôt often check and I had no idea at the time that Bob was involved in this disturbing situation with Dave and Emma.So I proceeded to add him back.

Disturbingly, Dave stated he's aroused by girls who act like little children, with waxed "childlike" vaginas. He wanted any potential girlfriend to tell him how "young" her vagina was, even using an example like saying it was "14 years old." He also made the repulsive, pedophilic claim that if we had a daughter together, he would want me to check if her panties were ‚Äúwet‚Äù.He told me if I was in a bathroom taking a dump he would want to sit and watch me and to wipe me afterwards üíÄ.

I hadn't been on a date in a while and was going through a self-destructive phase. But I had already started talking to Bob and having nice conversations with him, so it didn't seem fair to cut him off just because of Dave and Emma's strangeness since I thought he was separate from that whole situation. I naively agreed to go on a date with Bob, not necessarily to sleep with him but to see where it went because he really did seem like a nice guy.

Around this time, I started to suspect Dave might be catfishing me. He claimed to be getting a new tattoo and showed me a stencil.At this feeling I had a bad feeling about him and I wanted to continue to talk to him to reveal the truth. I reverse image searched  some of his pictures and found a Reddit post with him topless titled ‚ÄòNatty or  Juice‚Äô , which to my surprise in this image included his instagram account which I haven‚Äôt seen.The significance of this photo was this was the same photo he sent me when he was doing his ‚Äòskincare‚Äô.I also found  the same photo he once shared with him posted on Snapchat when he debated having a tattoo done which had a stencil for the areas he wanted tattooed and this same picture was on this Instagram account with a different name and this exact photo was  in  his 2022 photos.

I then found Dave's TikTok, where his bio listed him as an Aquarius - but when I had asked his astrological sign before, he told me he was a Scorpio. When I confronted him about lying about his sign, he claimed it was an "inside joke" about his ex.

Strangely, when I met up with Bob, he sounded exactly like Dave on the phone and made similarly disturbing sexual remarks.He told me when he left he was going to meet up with a couple of friends at bar and when I purposely messaged Dave he told also had plans to go to bar with his friends and it may be a coincidence they both described the same sort of bar.

After my date with Bob, Dave and Emma stopped messaging me. There were tons of inconsistencies in the stories and details Dave had provided about himself and Emma. I don't know if he was catfishing me completely, if he and his biological sister were pushing an incest fantasy, or what other disturbing scenario was really going on. Regardless, I knew I needed to cease all contact immediately due to the major red flags and incredibly alarming nature of Dave's claimed behaviors and comments, especially the repulsive pedophilic remarks.

This is my first Reddit post, so please be nice. I will never put myself in that type of situation again. I don't encourage the risky behaviors I engaged in, and I urge others to stay safe when interacting with people online or in person. Learn from my mistakes.

Does anyone have a theory of this might actually is ?
