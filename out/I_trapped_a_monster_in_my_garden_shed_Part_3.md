[\[Part 2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13362dc/i_trapped_a_monster_in_my_garden_shed_part_2/)

I’ve experienced the will of God before, but this has been one confusing step after another. If I had to say where He is taking me, my answer would be simple; I have no idea.

But I do know one thing.

My entire outlook on the fiends has changed forever.

The day started off in the same way as the past two, with a check on the barricades, corpse clean-up in the yard, and frying another half-pound of ground beef for Cricket. With an old pair of sneakers, some clean clothes that looked right about her size, and a bucket of soapy water hanging from one arm, I took the wooden tray full of beef and headed for the garden shed.

Cricket sat wrapped in her blue woolen blanket behind the shed door, only her moldy head visible above the cocoon of navy-blue. I could see her hazy white eyes staring in between the slits in the door, and even though it would have made me shudder a few days ago, I admit, I smiled.

*Like a little kid playing hide-and-seek.*

She chittered happily the instant the door swung open and bobbed her head at smelling the cooked meat.

“Good morning to you too.” I pushed the wooden tray into the shadows for her. “You’re just a ball of energy today. That blanket must have done the trick, huh?”

Cricket shoveled down her breakfast in the same ravenous manner she always had, and I set the bucket of suds down nearby. My loop-pole was hidden behind my back, and I moved carefully, not wanting to spook her.

“We’re gonna try something new today, okay? You might not like it, but it will be good for you. We need to get those cuts cleaned up, and then put some better clothes on for rainy weather. Sound good?”

Of course, Cricket simply licked the hamburger grease from the wooden tray, and cocked her moldy head to one side quizzically, unable to understand my words. But as soon as I lifted the sponge-covered end of the loop-pole, soapy water still dripping from it, she recoiled with a low warning hiss.

*Great. She hates baths. This should be fun.*

“Come on,” I tried to scrub at her arms, but Cricket slashed at the sponge with her cracked fingernails, the poor yellow square absorbing one hateful attack after the other. “I know it sucks, but this is for your own good. You’ll feel so much better.”

Still, Cricket darted back and forth, fighting me every step of the way. At last, I gave up, and decided to drag her to the bucket. If I couldn’t get her scrubbed down, at least I could dowse her with the warm, soapy water, and that would help a little.

She glared at the pole, and lunged for the far corner, ready to avoid me at any cost.

“*Gotcha!*” By some stroke of luck, I managed to drop the nylon loop over Cricket’s greasy head and leaned backward with all my might.

There are deep-sea swordfish that have fought with less fury than that scrappy little critter did. Screaming with the hoarse, demonic screech that all the moon-eyed fiends made when they were riled, she fought tooth and nail to jerk the pole out of my hands, to drag me with it when that didn’t work, and to gnaw her way through the loop when I began to win the tug-of-war. Despite her manic strength, I still had a good twenty pounds on her, and kept the snapping, rasping beast at bay. Inch by pulse-pounding inch, I pulled her toward the waiting bucket of suds.

Cricket’s food caught on a loose board, and without warning, she flew forward.

I stumbled back, the sudden release of tension taking me by surprise, and we tumbled together into the bright morning sun.

*Oh no.*

We both froze, our eyes locked on each other in mutual horror.

Cricket’s chest heaved with hard, sharp gulps, as if her sooty black lungs couldn’t drag in enough air between the screams. All her limbs twitched uncontrollably, and she clawed with feeble fingers at the nylon loop still twisted around her neck. The fiend’s eyes widened, and black gooey tears ran down her dirty face.

Shocked at the adverse reaction, I wriggled away, still clutching my end of the pole to keep her pinned, too wary to let Cricket up. Every instinct I had told me that she needed to go back into the shed *now*, but I was too stunned to react quickly enough.

Her clammy skin bubbled up in strange, painful-looking lumps, then turned crusty and black, as if burning in a furnace. The mold-green hair crumpled into dust, her ragged clothes became stiff charred sheets, and all four limbs contracted into a hardened, rock-like ball. Right before my eyes, the fiend seemed to be drying out into a massive lump, like a piece of charcoal with legs.

For one brief second, Cricket tried to raise an arm to me in an almost pleading gesture, film-white eyes boring into mine, and let out something like a high-pitched croak of desperation.

And then . . . stillness.

*No.*

Tears sprang to my eyes, and I fell to a seated position, poking at Cricket’s rigid black limbs with a hesitant finger. Her skin felt dense, almost like a hand-carved statue now lay in place of what had once been a living thing. Every dead one had that hard wooden layer beneath their skin, but now *all* of her flesh was solid, as if any of the human-like softness had been burned away.

She didn’t move, didn’t respond, and all the noises from her tortured throat had stopped.

“Oh God.”

A groan of despair rippled through me, and I couldn’t help but sob. Since losing Stacy, I’d had nothing, and no one, save for the Lord. Cricket, as creepy and unnatural as she had been, was the first real tie I’d had with the world in months. Now she was gone, and her last moments of terrible suffering had all been my fault.

*How could you be so stupid, Adam? All for a bath. You killed her over a freaking bath.*

“Cricket,” Sniffling, I cradled her bald, scorched head in my lap, and let all the months of grief, pain, and loneliness boil over. “Cricket, I’m s-so sorry, I’m sorry, I d-didn’t mean to . . .”

I rocked back on my heels and held her close, my salty tears splashing off her still face in agonized rivulets. In that moment, I clung to Cricket’s lifeless wooden fingers, but in my head, I was back in the hospital morgue, gripping Stacy’s limp icy hand, and wishing I’d gotten a chance to say goodbye. It wasn’t fair, I knew everyone was a sinner, but I didn’t see how I deserved this kind of punishment. Had God turned on me? Had I done something to anger Him?

*Why, Adonai? Why would you give me something to care about, and then take it away? Haven’t I suffered enough? How much pain do I have to endure for you to be satisfied?*

Another gunshot echoed from somewhere over the ridge, and I forced myself to open my eyes. I didn’t want to burn her like the others. No, I’d bury her, like a proper human, in the cemetery, and if anyone did finally come along to object, they could sit outside and wait for the rest to show up. I had brutally killed my only friend, and she deserved more than a cremation.

Wrapping her in the faded wool blanket, I carried Cricket to the edge of the tree line, that way she could always be close to the shadows. Every step hurt my soul, and I remembered vividly the last time I’d been in a cemetery. So much pain, concentrated in one place. Now, I would have to add one more story, one more marker, one more shard of human suffering to a long line of misery that seemed to have no end for me.

*I have to do this.*

I looked down at the woolen bundle on the ground and choked down a spasm of sobs.

*For Cricket.*

Hefting a shovel I’d retrieved from the parsonage, I stabbed the grass, and let every slice in the soil echo deep within my chest.

Hours ticked by, and yet I didn’t stop, fresh tears falling like rain from my face. Something about attacking the earth, digging deeper and deeper helped soothe my pain, turned my bitterness into fuel, and gave me purpose. I was a preacher with an empty church, in a county with apparently no people, who had just murdered his only friend in the world, but at least I could dig a mighty fine grave. I’d dig the best grave ever for Cricket.

At last, as the sun sank lower in the sky, I tossed the shovel aside, and let out a long, shuddery breath. It was time. I had to get back inside before dark, and the hole was deep enough. Tomorrow, I would pack my things into a knapsack, grab my guns, and head for New Wilderness. There was nothing left for me here, nothing good. I had failed in every way I could think of.

Nudging the blanket-covered body to the edge of the hole, I wiped my eyes on one shirt sleeve, and sniffled. “Goodbye, Cricket. I’m sorry, for everything.”

With one hard shove, I let her fall into the grave.

*Crunch.*

A sound, like an enormous fortune-cookie being split open erupted from the hole, and a foul stench hit my nose. It stank like rotten eggs, a thick, heavy scent that settled in the back of my throat with a sour tang. Around the body, a large pool of glistening black sludge slowly spread in a circle as if she had been punctured, and all the disgusting goo was seeping out.

*I wish this was a bad dream.*

I forced down a gag, and stepped to the side, reaching for my shovel to start backfilling the grave.

*Crunch.*

Every muscle in my body went rigid, and I stared down at the corpse. I hadn’t touched it, hadn’t dumped any dirt or stones down on it. It shouldn’t have made any noise.

Hesitantly, I bent down, and tugged the blanket away from Cricket’s scorched head.

A line appeared across the barren scalp, and I stumbled backward.

The line widened, becoming a crack, then a split. Soon the entire blackened head was crisscrossed with a spiderweb of fractures, more appearing all over the frozen limbs and torso. Something was *in* there, I realized.

Something trying to claw its way out.

With a disgusting *slurk*, a large chunk of black sloughed off the face of the corpse and tumbled to the bottom of the grave.

Deep, ragged breaths sucked air from under a loose flap of the ebony crust, and the figure in the grave spasmed, arching its head back as if drowning. Beneath the layers of solid black mass, something dark reflected the fading sunlight, moving in stunned jerks.

An eye, one with golden irises, moved to look everywhere all at once.

One of the arms snapped from its molded position, and the fingers began to break free, gouging at the face in a rushed, frantic attack. The thing seemed to be moving faster by the second, and I found myself paralyzed by confusion. Was this a trick? Had she been playing dead all along, and now she would rip into me with renewed hatred for her mistreatment? Or was there some other horrible thing buried inside this freak of the unknown, some otherworldly parasite that was burrowing its way out to seek a new host?

*Kill it. Beat it into the ground, dummy, before some mind control spider-thing crawls out and eats through your esophagus.*

The shovel weighed heavy in my hands, and I stood over the decrepit hole in the earth, ready to finish the job.

Ice flooded through my veins and riveted me to the spot.

*What the . . .*

A face. There was a face under there, with creamy pale skin, sandy-brown eyebrows, and at least one golden eye opened wide in terror. A set of satin pink lips were parted behind the crust that kept half of her mouth sealed shut, and she frantically clawed at it, chips and chunks falling like rain. She coughed and choked, but fought for every breath, rolling over onto one free hand, and two still-captive knees.

*Crack.*

The crust along her back gave way, and the girl arched her spine like a cat, vomiting onto the mud an inordinate amount of pitch-black sludge. Her hand shook as she tore at the plates that encased her head, revealing another eye, the rest of her sheet-white face, and a mass of tangled blonde hair balled-up beneath the smooth charcoal covering. Tears rolled down her grimy cheeks, at first black like the vomit, but then clearer and clearer as the seconds ticked by, and she wept with a hoarse, raw wail.

I dropped the shovel and jumped down to slide my arms under hers, dragging the girl out onto the soft green grass of the cemetery. Together, we yanked pieces of the black crust from her shaking body.

She puked until tiny brown chunks that looked like carved wooden teeth came out, and her own pearly white molars emerged from the tide of abyssal sludge. It sounded painful, and in between gagging on the foul-smelling stuff, the girl groaned in agony, like she was being tortured.

Her eyes rose to meet mine, full of pain and fear. “P-Please . . . *help.*”

Thousands of jumbled questions swirled in my head, but I just pried more of the gooey, slimy plates off her skin, which left behind a smelly residue the color of used motor oil. “Take it easy, just stay still. Stay still, you’re alright, you’re okay. Keep breathing for me.”

“I . . . I c-can’t.” She vomited again with force, and the flow started to wane, less black bile coming up now.

“Yes you can.” I stifled my own nausea and loosened a chunk of black casing from the back of her neck. “Focus on my voice. Deep breaths, in and out.”

In a few moments, the puking stopped, and the girl collapsed to the grass, most of her body free of the crust.

I sat next to her, staring in bewilderment. Not twelve hours ago, she’d been a white-eyed, moldy-haired monster, clawing for my throat, and now . . . now I had no idea what I was dealing with.

*I have to call someone. Wait, who am I kidding? They’ll think I’m crazy. No one answers the phone anyway.*

Rolling to a crouch, I tried to keep my slime-covered hands steady. “Are . . . are you okay?”

The girl squirmed as she clawed at the greasy residue that covered her willowy body in irritation. “It itches. I have to get this off, it *itches*.”

Glancing at the orange rays of the sinking sun, I offered a hand to help her up. “Can you walk?”

“I . . . I don’t know.” She swallowed, which must have tasted horrible because she gagged again in the next second. “My legs feel weird. *Everything* feels weird.”

Despite this, she slid one hand into mine, and I pulled her up.

As wobbly legged as a newborn fawn, the girl’s slender legs buckled instantly, and she went down with a yelp.

Somehow, I managed to catch her, wrapping one arm around her shivering shoulders, and slid the other under her knees. “Whoa, whoa, easy. Maybe we’ll leave walking for later, yeah? Let’s just get inside.”

She didn’t protest, but tears glistened in her eyes once more, and she started to sob. “Why won’t my legs work?”

“They will.” With the trembling girl curled up against my chest, I headed for the back door to the parsonage as fast as I could go. “Just stay calm and keep breathing.”

It had been years since I carried a woman over a threshold, and even then, it hadn’t been a medical emergency with Stacy. She would have been perfect for this situation, always the calm, collected one with injuries. But then again, I doubted she’d ever dealt with anything like this, and as I stomped through the narrow door of my dimly lit kitchen, I tried to think up a plan of action.

*Get her cleaned up, check for bleeding, or was that airway first? No, she’s breathing okay so far, its circulation that’s next. Oh Stacy, I need you here so badly.*

Shuffling down the hall in my muddy shoes, I shouldered the bathroom door open, and bumped the light switch with my elbow.

Yellow light flared to life from the bulbs ringing the mirror, and the girl shook harder in my arms.

“So cold.” She whispered, her teeth beginning to chatter.

*Please don’t go into shock, I don’t even know what to do for that.*

I knelt to set her down inside the round white bathtub and reached for the stainless-steel knobs. “This should help. Just stay awake, okay? Don’t pass out.”

Warm water sent plumes of steam wafting into the air, and I tugged the little metal plunger up to switch the flow to the showerhead. My shirt was soaked in moments, but I didn’t care. Instead, I handed her a clean washcloth, and grabbed for a bottle of bodywash.

“Here, I need you to scrub, hard.”

She obeyed without question, the oily slime dissolving in the steady rain of water, and the rest of the black crust followed suit. I poured liquid soap over her tangled hair, and she dug more pieces of black crust from her skin with disgusted gags. Slowly, the girl started to breathe easier, her shivering stopped, and some of the color began to return to her pale face.

*Check her legs.*

It was as if Stacy had tiptoed up beside me, her voice smooth and reassuring in the fog of my memories.

*If she can wiggle her toes, that’s a good sign. Check, now.*

Doing my best to be gentle, I gripped the girl’s right ankle, and poked at her toes one by one. No dense woodiness greeted my touch from beneath her skin, just the typical softness of a human foot. “Can you feel anything? Pain, or pinching anywhere?”

For a moment, she stared at her foot, and the toes wiggled under my thumb.

She gasped back a sob of relief and nodded. “Yes, I . . . I can move them. I can feel my legs.”

Our eyes met, and we both looked at each other for the first time since the gravesite. She had high cheekbones with a spattering of freckles across them, a slightly upturned nose and solid golden irises that almost gleamed with a metallic luminescence in the steam of the shower. Her long wavy hair was colored like rich autumn honey, and her skin took on a warm pinkish hue now that it had been wiped clean. Just as I had predicted, she was beautiful, and yet . . . was this still Cricket?

*The sunlight. It caused her to, what, molt? Shed her skin? Mutate?*

At my gaze, the strange girl flushed a darker shade of red, and pulled her knees to her chest, wrapping her arms around them to help cover herself.

My ears flared with an embarrassed heat, and I scrabbled backward on my heels. “Sorry, I . . . I didn’t mean to stare.”

“It’s okay.” She hid behind her curtains of soaked blonde hair. “I guess I just haven't warmed up yet. The water helps.”

*Duh, Adam, get it together.*

“Sure. I, um, I’ll get you some fresh clothes. Will you be okay here for a bit?”

The girl made a show of wiping down an already clean arm and nodded. Myself, I tried to bore a hole through my shoes with both eyes, feeling quite out of place all at once. I’d been married for seven years, I knew what a woman looked like, but it seemed this one had sent me right back to my high school days of awkward stammering and scatterbrained thoughts.

Red-faced, I handed her a towel from the rack on the shower door and lunged into the cool safety of the dark hallway.

Running a set of fingers through my soaked brown hair, I backed up against one wall, and tried to stop my whirling thoughts. I’d almost accepted the strange new creatures that the forest seemed to regurgitate every night that passed, but now . . . now one of them had become human?

*If I wake up to find this was all a hamburger-helper induced nightmare . . .*

But I knew that wasn’t going to happen. I had been immersed into this ethereal corner of Ohio for too long to believe otherwise. Somehow, in some trick of otherworldly biology that eluded me, the screeching fiend that had been Cricket was now a golden-haired woman sitting in my shower. Had this always been possible? Was this an act of God? Had I been standing on the precipice of a cure for whatever those *things* were all this time?

“Clothes.” I shut my eyes and forced myself to concentrate. “She needs clothes.”

By the time I’d finished tearing through the unpacked totes stacked up in my bedroom, it looked like a bomb had gone off, with bits of clothes thrown everywhere, random items heaped up together in little piles, and spare shoes all mismatched over the hardwood floor. I didn’t exactly have any women’s clothes with me, so I walked back to the bathroom with a brand-new toothbrush still in the box, paired with some old sweatpants and a T-shirt that I hardly wore anymore.

Ten minutes later, the knob on the bathroom door clicked, and out stepped the stranger who I’d pulled from her own grave, dressed in the loose-fitting gray sweatpants and baggy red T-shirt, her damp hair draped over one shoulder in a river of spun gold. She still swayed a little on her bare feet, as if she didn’t quite trust her own legs just yet, but the girl greeted me with a sheepish wave.

“Hey.”

“Hey.” I echoed, both mesmerized, and terrified. “Feeling better?”

She braced a hand against the wall for support, and breathed a long, exhausted sigh. “Still really sore. My stomach keeps flopping like a fish. Where am I?”

“Ohio” The words tasted strange now that I had to use them out loud, almost like forbidden chants to some pagan ritual. “[Barron County](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/125343t/i_got_an_email_from_a_whistleblower_things_arent/).”

She rubbed the back of her neck, flexing it from side to side. “Never heard of it. Who are you?”

*So, you don’t remember me. Okay, that either makes this super easy, or super complicated.*

“My name is Adam Stirling.” I did my best to smile, though it only sent fresh waves of fire through the skin over my cheekbones. “I’m, uh, a preacher here. This is my church.”

The girl opened her mouth to answer, but frowned, a flicker of horror slicing through her shiny golden eyes.

My stomach knotted, and I wondered what I’d done in the span of a few seconds to upset her so much. “Is everything alright?”

“No.” She shut both eyes, squeezing them together as if she had a migraine, and her breaths went back to being shallow, and ragged. “I . . . my name. I don’t know my name.”

My brain tingled with static unease, but I inched a little closer. “What are you talking about? Can’t you remember?”

Her eyes opened again to meet mine, brimming with tears, and despite my best efforts, I couldn’t find anything threatening in that gaze.

“No.” She whimpered, her lower lip trembling, and I could see her fighting the panic with everything she had. 

“Okay, well, what do you remember? Anything?”

“I remember trees.” It was as if the words were caustic to the girl with the way she whispered them in growing discomfort second-by-second. “Big trees and running through the mud. I remember being cold, feeling hard rocks under my feet like on a gravel road. Gunshots. A big ball of fire. Pain. But after that . . . nothing.”

*A road surrounded by trees. Why does that sound so familiar?*

“Look, don’t stress about it, alright?” Deciding to wait until later to press her on that topic, I held up my hands to reassure the golden-haired stranger. “I’m sure it will come to you, just give it time. You want something to help settle your stomach?”

To her credit, the girl seemed to muster her fortitude, and forced herself to breath slower. “Yes please.”

I offered her my arm, and she wrapped hers around it after some hesitation, the two of us shuffling down the long, narrow hallway of the parsonage in bewildered silence. Neither of us seemed to know what to say, her concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other, while I simply tried not to think about how nice it felt to have someone’s hand on my arm again. It was a mysterious, guilty, and exciting sensation, Stacy’s memory enough to send jabs of torment through my heart, while the stranger’s shy smile made my brain turn to useless mush.

“Wait here.” I guided her to the low brown couch in the living room and jerked my head toward the kitchen. “It’ll just take a second.”

She made another apologetic smile and rubbed at goosebumps on her bare arms. “Thanks. Do you mind if I lay down? I’m exhausted.”

*That would be all those nights of throwing yourself against the shed walls.*

Shaking the thought away, I gestured to a red-and-white checkered quilt draped over the back of the couch. “Help yourself. Like I said, ten seconds, and I’ll be back.”

Grateful for another opportunity to duck out of sight, I paced in the kitchen and massaged the bridge of my nose in a flurry of contemplation. Night would be here in minutes. I could already see movement in the distant tree line, the bat-winged creatures in the treetops peeking out form under the protective layer of leaves, the glow-antlered deer venturing out among the low shadows, and more than a few pair of white eyes watched the church from the bushes, as if they somehow knew something had changed. Would they attack the church in waves now? How would I explain to the person in my living room that we were surrounded by monstrous imitations of nature, and that less that twenty-four hours ago, she’d been one of them? What would she do when I did? Could I even trust her, or was this some kind of vampiric trojan horse, where I’d wake up to find her chewing on my esophagus the instant I let my guard down?

*God, I need direction. Speak to me. Tell me what to do.*

Somehow, as if on cue, my eyes rested on a small, framed picture on the windowsill above the sink, adorned with the swirling letters of scripture.

*‘My ways are not your ways, my thoughts are not your thoughts, sayeth the Lord.’*

“Very helpful.” I muttered, and yanked open the aged yellow refrigerator to grab a green aluminum soda can. “I could have told you that. *None* of this is how I would have done it. Especially taking away Stacy.”

That last bit came with some venom, and I made a point of avoiding eye contact with the picture as I trudged back down the hallway.

“Here, this should . . .” As soon as I walked in, I stopped myself, a thin smile crossing my weary face.

The girl lay curled up on the couch, burrowed into the soft cushions with the quilt wrapped around her from head to toe. Her hair had begun to dry, the silky tresses reflecting the nearby glow of a few lamps that I kept switched on for comfort against the creeping shadows of the night. Fast asleep, her shoulders rose and fell with each delicate breath, and the freckled face that poked out from the covers looked more peaceful than ever. She seemed . . . happy, or at least content, and every doubt or suspicion I had faded into fuzzy warmth beneath my ribcage.

*Been a long time since anyone fell asleep on my couch but me.*

Allowing myself a few more moments to take in the smooth lines of her face, the way her golden hair rippled over one ear like a stream of sunshine, I left the unopened can of soda on the coffee table by the stranger’s head and trudged for my room.

And this is where I’ve been since then, floating back and forth between eerie distrust and veiled relief, all my emotions rolling over and over in my mind like a rock tumbler. I have no idea what I’m going to do tomorrow, what I’m going to say to her, or what this means for the rest of the white-eyed fiends howling at the moon outside. All I can do is pray that God is patient with my many questions, and that somehow, I can help the girl who used to be Cricket figure out just who she really is.

I need to go. My eyelids are getting heavy, and if I don’t start doing something else (like cleaning my very dirty Winchester) I may fall asleep at my desk.

Which, in this case, could be a deadly mistake.
