Here’s what I know.

All started with that old house looking down from the hillside, I’m sure of that.  Broke windows, sagging roof and holes in the walls showing the dark inside.  Sitting off on its own from the rest of the town about 10 minutes walk through the trees.  Been lying there empty since before I was even born and I just turned 33 last month. 

I remember when I was little the other kids used to make up stories about it.  Say that in the basement, where the stone was crumbling and the wood rotted through, there were tunnels into the mountain.  Tales got crazier from there on out but they always started that same way.  Kids just trying to scare each other, I suppose.  

Still, no-one was ever brave enough to go see.  I sure wasn’t.  You would never see me further than the line of rusted metal in the grass, all that was left of the fence and gate.  I would stay right there while the others dared each other to go closer, to look inside, to go inside.  They never did.  Something about the place, you know?  Silence like a weight on you.  It wasn’t quiet like a regular thing is quiet, like a … a table, or a bike or such.  Sounds stupid now but that house was quiet like an animal.  Like something watching you and waiting for you to look away.  

Hell I can’t explain it right I don’t have the words.

So my momma told me she saw someone leaving that place.  Said they come right out through where the front door used to be, just after midnight.  This woulda been 3 nights ago.  

She can’t go out much now but she sure does like to keep an eye on things.  Can sit at that window for hours on end, doing her crosswords and watching.

“I saw em all right.” she said to me the next morning, “Sneakin out of there all surreptitious like.  Up to no good I’d say.  Wouldn’t be hiding otherwise.  Are you listening Marshall?”

“Yes momma.”

“What did I say?”

“You saw em sneakin.”

“That’s right.”

We was talking over breakfast (bacon and eggs) then I done the washing up.  Well I’m saying breakfast, was more like 1pm but that’s when momma gets up so that’s morning for her I guess.  Me and Noah, that’s my nephew he is 3 and a half, we already ate cereal at 8am early and watched cartoons like we always do.  

That stuffs not important, is it?  I'm sorry.  I’m not too sure what is or isn’t important so I’m just putting everything I can remember.
Where was I at?  Oh yeah, I got it. 

I heard voices out in the street and peeked out to have a look.  It was Officer Winters talking with our neighbour, that’s Miss Jacobsen.  This was real unusual seeing as, far as I know, she has never before had a visit from the law.

I finished cleaning up and went out to have a listen because, if I’m honest, not much interesting happens in town.  They were both out on her porch when I got there, Officer Winters standing and Miss Jacobsen sitting holding her walking stick out in front.

I recall him saying “ - so you ain’t seen or spoke with any of them? Not since last month?”

Miss Jacobsen, she said “Not a word. Even then wasn’t more than a hello.”

He said “Well, can’t claim I wasn’t hopin for a different answer, but it is what it is.”

Then she said “Jesus H Christ.  Marshall!  You ain’t even good at eavesdropping you idiot you just standing right there.”

“Ah I’m sorry Miss Jacobsen.” I replied, “Hey Sheriff.”

“I ain’t a sheriff, Marshall.  Officer Winters is just fine.”

“Ah yeah that’s right.  Sorry I keep forgettin.”

I feel like I say sorry a lot of the time but I’m also screwing up constant so I guess it works out.  

They was done so Mr Officer Winters came to our house next.  I let him in and got him a seat in the kitchen.

My momma came in with Noah, she had been doing her puzzles and he had been pretending to help.  Took her a minute to get settled and get her breath back.  It’s hard for her to walk much nowadays, she is quite a heavy lady (she would say “stout” if she was being nice).  Once we was all ready Officer Winters told us why he was visiting everyone.

He went on a bit but the gist of it was this.  Couple of miles over there was a house looking on the lake.  It was retired couple living there, had been since it was built.  Now here I must apologize because I didn’t see them often and their names escape me.  So Mr Winters had swung by to check on them as he did every month and neither of them was home.  But their car was there.  So he tried to phone and no answer.  Dropped back the next day and still no sign.

“Could be on vacation.” I said.

“Could be Marshall, could be.  Odd though that they wouldn’t tell a soul, not even their families.”

He sighed and got to his feet.

“Sure it’s nothing to worry about,” he said, “just strange is all.”

That’s when momma told him about the figure she had seen up at the old house.

“You certain, Millie?” he asked her.  That’s my mommas name I don’t think I mentioned that.

“Shit yes I am.” she said, “Was a full moon and clear sky.  Rest of me might be decrepit but my eyes is just fine.”

“Okay okay.” he held his hands up in surrender but he was smiling too.

Everyone liked Mr Winters even momma, she wasn’t really angry.  They had known each other all their lives I think.

I remember Noah had come over and sat on my knee.  Mr Winters smiled at him and took a long look around, eyes lingering on that house through the high trees.

“Okay then.” he said, “You folks just be careful, you hear?  Make sure all these doors and windows are locked at night.  I know most likely it’s nothin but best to be on the safe side.”

“Always do lock em.” momma said, which wasn’t quite right because it was me does it but I didn’t say nothing.

“Bye Sheriff.” I said.

And Noah said “Bye shrf” and Mr Winters rolled his eyes but he laughed too.

Not much else happened that night I don’t think.  About 8 it was pitch black out, so I said I was taking Noah up to bed for his story.

Momma said “It should be you reading to him Marshall not the other way around.  Goddam ludicrous, you can read and write well enough you ain’t that stupid.”

“It’s mostly just animal names and pictures momma, he can do it fine.  And he likes readin and I like listenin so where’s the harm?”

She started swearing but dropped her glass so while she was picking it up I made my escape.  She had started drinking earlier than usual, which I can tell you is not a good sign for the night ahead.  I wanted to tell her to stop but I’d tried before and I know a hopeless cause when I see it.  Figured why have the argument again.  

In truth, most nights it was nothing.  Sometimes though she would go up to my sisters old room with a bottle, that’s when it was trouble.  I’d hear her crying and I’d just stay away till she needed me cause I didn’t know what to say.  Hard for her to get up the stairs, harder to get down drunk, but she wouldn’t listen.  That’s how it’s been and I didn’t know how to change it.

When me and Noah finished reading I tucked him into bed with an extra blanket because it was sure getting cold.  He asked me “Will it snow, Uncle Marshall?”

“Maybe.”

“I think it will.”

“Well you may very well be right, let’s see in the morning. Goodnight Noah.”

“Night Uncle Marshall.”

“You just shout me if you wake up and need anything, okay?”

“Okay.”

I remember thinking it was amazing, just last year he only knew a couple of words now listen to him.  I thought to myself he is growing up and I don’t know if I’m happy or sad about it, maybe both.

When I went downstairs I started my nightly list.  I have it all written down so I don’t miss anything.  Lights out, doors and windows locked, chores done.  That sort of thing.
 
As I was near finished I saw Officer Winters again through the window, heading up the hill with a flashlight out.  I watched that light flickering through the trees all the way up, then right around that house. 

I imagined myself being there with him, me in a uniform with a badge and gun helping people.  You ever do that?  Imagine another life, still yourself but where things wound up different?  I get carried away doing it, daydreaming.  Too often I think.  Always have since I was little I can’t help it.  Must be watching too much TV that does it, that’s what Suzanne always said.  That was my sister, Noahs mom.

The rain was coming on when I saw the light working it’s way back down.  I felt the cold creeping into the house too so I pulled the curtains and fixed myself a coffee.

Momma had long since passed out on her bed so I fitted her oxygen mask on her and took the empty bottle and glass downstairs.  Then I got myself wrapped up on the couch and watched some old movie.  I fell asleep right there but kept get woken up, wind or some other noise rattling the windows.

*

I went out walking the next afternoon, this would be yesterday.  momma had been up early, said her cough came on and she couldn’t shake it so I left Noah sitting in bed with her watching cartoons.  

Now, being a little thick around the midsection and having a weak chest runs in our family.  Hell even Noah has asthma.  So I figured a few years back I should start exercising.  I usually walk a big loop out around town, down past the river.  I say river but it’s only about a foot deep and 10 across.  I come back along the main street after about 20 minutes. 

Isn’t much of a town I suppose, not anymore.  About a hundred different reasons have shrunk it down over the years.  People don’t stay.  Say there’s nothing here for them but I don’t understand that.  I think, especially in the fall, this is just about the most beautiful place in the world.  Red and gold leaves covering the place as far as you can see, looks and feels like a fairytale.  Maybe that’s just me.  

Now though, in the cold and wet with the sky all gray, most of all you notice the empty houses.  Seems like every second home has gone quiet.  Hard to even remember the families that were there before.

When I was getting near home I saw Mr Winters and another officer getting out of their vehicle.  I went over.  

I heard the other cop saying “We are in the ass end of nowhere. What do you expect?”

Then Officer Winters said “Can we help you Marshall?  Or are you just gonna stand there listenin?”

“Sorry sheriff.”

“I ain’t a sheriff.”

“Ah yeah sorry.”

I’m terrible at remembering that.  I just got it in my head that he is and I can’t shake it out. Lucky he was always so patient and didn’t get angry with me like other folk.

“So what you guys doin?” I asked.  I didn’t like to interrupt but I also didn’t want to be accused of eavesdropping again.

The other cop rolled his eyes but Mr Winters answered while he was getting gear from the trunk.

“Well Marshall, it’s like this.  I went up the hillside to that house last night to see what was what.  And I considered going in on my own.  Except this ain’t one of those detective shows you are always watching, this here is real life.  And seein as I didn’t want to fall through a floorboard in the dark and break my goddam legs, I devised an alternative course of action.  I called the only other officer within a hundred miles of this godforsaken town, that’s Rob here …”

“Hey Marshall.”

“Hey Rob.”

“... and asked him if he would be so kind as to meet me here this very day.  Now I will go and search that house, with backup, in daylight.  Actin on common sense is not quite as excitin but does result in less broken bones.”

I hadn’t recognised Rob at first.  We all met him once before last year when the sheriff was on vacation.  Rob had come to introduce himself which was very kind of him.

“So Marshall, how’s that nephew of yours?” Rob asked, “He must be what … 3 now?”

“Oh Noah he is good.  And yes sir he is 3 goin on 30.”

“Ain’t that him playing in the middle of the road?”

“Ah shoot yes it is.”

I high tailed it up the street and gathered Noah up onto the porch.  He was saying he was just bored as anything so I got us a couple of drinks and we watched the sheriff and Rob head on up that hillside.

It was real quiet in the street as we sat there, felt as if everyone had decided to just stay in for the day.  Don’t think I even saw a bird in the sky, but we both thought we saw a few flakes of snow which Noah was very happy about.

Up the hill Rob and Mr Winters had disappeared inside that house.  Was around then I realized that I hadn’t seen Mr Eggers that day.  He lived across from us and was usually out front tending his plants or working in his garage with the door open.  But he hadn’t been out on his porch that morning and he was always out there at that time.  He was a man of very regular habits and I’d never known him to break them.

Now the two officers, they had been in that house a while, maybe 15 minutes.  My eyes kept straying back to Mr Eggers place because it was just so strange.  I was thinking I should go and knock his door to see if he was okay when I noticed it wasn’t even closed, it was just lying a couple of inches open.

I sent Noah up to his bedroom and started to go over there when I saw Rob and Mr Winters reappear.  Rob bent over at the waist, looked like he was being sick.  Mr Winters was on his phone.  Both had their weapons out which I had never seen before.  They headed back down and when they got closer I saw they was both white as sheets.

The two of them went straight back to their vehicle and, since I figured I should tell them about Mr Eggers, I tagged along behind trying to catch up.  I heard bits and pieces of them talking on their phones.  

Rob said “...bare minimum of ten but it’s impossible to tell …” and I heard Mr Winters say “...everyone you can get. I have never seen anything like it…”.  

In between they talked to each other about how bad the weather coming tonight was.

I caught up to them.

“Mr Sheriff, sir?”

“Not now Marshall.”

“Mr Eggers door is lyin open and I ain’t seen him.  Not since yesterday mornin.”

Mr Winters looked at me then over at the Eggers house.

“I’ll call back.” he said to the person on the phone and hung up.

He started walking toward Mr Eggers place and I followed.

“What was in that house up there sheriff?  You both look white as sheets.”

“Not now Marshall.”

“Is Rob okay cause I thought I saw him being sick.  Was -”

“Marshall.  Not now.”

Behind us I could hear Rob still talking the whole time.  Mr Winters chapped at the door and it swung back a little.  He stepped inside.

“Joseph?” he called out, that is Mr Eggers first name.  There was no reply.  “Marshall, ask Rob to come in here please and you wait at the door.”

He had his hand on his holster and sounded real serious so I did as he asked with my mouth shut.  The two of them went in together a minute later and I stood there on my own in the street feeling useless.  

I heard them shouting on Mr Eggers and could see them moving through the window.  I remember the door was still open so I peered inside I couldn’t help myself.  Down the hallway I could see into the kitchen at the back.  The window was smashed and I saw broken glass.  There were dark patches on the floor.

Mr Winters reappeared in the hall and I shrunk back pretending I wasn’t doing nothing.

“Get out of here Marshall.  Go check on Noah and your mom.  Quickly now.”

I didn’t argue.  On the way back home I found myself shaking a little and not just from the cold.  Night always comes quick in the winter and yesterday was no exception.  What light we had left was barely getting through the clouds.  

It had gone quiet again.  That heavy silence like I was being watched.  

My eyes were drawn to the darkest places beneath the trees, the pitch black out of the moonlight.  I had slowed to a stop and it felt like the world had too.  I stared.  

There was something there I was sure of it.  Still and silent in the dark but there was something there.

Then I snapped out of it and ran.

When I got in our front door I was soaked in a cold sweat from head to toe.  I didn’t really know what to do so I shouted momma and Noah and started checking locks on doors and windows.

“Marshall what the hell are you doing?” momma was struggling down the stairs with Noah behind her, “Whats going on?”

“Somethin bad is happenin I don’t know what.  Mr Eggers is missing I think and Mr Winters found something up at that house that shook them up terrible.”

As I was answering her I saw marks on the outside of the window.  Scratches on the glass and wooden frame.  They hadn’t been there the day before.  I stood there still for a second, just staring.

“Marshall, what nonsense are you spoutin?  Where’s Joseph?”

I was thinking about Mr Eggers broken window.  I thought about noises waking me up in the night.  Then I just stopped thinking about it because I started shaking again and I couldn’t stop.

Once I got everything locked I calmed myself down and explained it all to her as best I could.  While we were talking I looked out and saw Mr Winters coming back to our door.  In the distance behind him I could see Rob at another door.

“You got your shotgun, Millie?” he asked when he came in.

“Course I do.  Ain’t used it for near twenty years though.  You plannin to elaborate?”

“Got some help comin but I don’t think tonight.  We got to get through tonight.”

“You ain’t answerin me.”

“You can stay locked in here, I won’t start forcing people to move that would be a whole other set of problems.  But if you don’t feel safe then some folk are gathering with me and Rob in the town hall, you are all more than welcome.”

“Safe? What in the f-”

“I’m not going talk details with anyone, Millie.  I am certain it will not be of help.  People are missing and I believe there is still danger to others.  That’s all I’ll say.”

As he was talking his eyes drifted back up to that old house and then locked in place.

“What is it sheriff?” I asked.

He didn’t move, didn’t take his eyes off that house.  I don’t know what he saw but it had his attention that’s for sure.

“Lock your door.” he said, then he called for Rob and they headed straight back up there. They were moving quicker this time and had their guns drawn along with their flashlights.  Not even in my imagination did I want to go with them. 

When they were both up there they stopped, one at either side of the front door.  I thought I heard Mr Winters shout something but with the wind picking up I couldn’t make it out.  Then they went in fast, one after the other.  

I had went out a few steps from our porch, straining my eyes and ears to see or hear what little I could.  The wind whipped at my clothes and I felt the first touch of rain.

Someone screamed.  

It came from the far end of the street, not the hillside.  Sounded like a woman.  I looked down there but I didn’t see anyone.  So I walked out a little further, trying to ignore my heart rattling in my chest.  

Then I saw her.  I think it was Mrs Edmonson, though I can't be certain.  She staggered out of her door then fell to one knee.  

I had just started down the street when something else came out the house behind her.  It snatched her up without a sound, dragging her back in there like she was a rag doll.

I have never been so scared in my life.  I can’t even describe it, what I saw.  The size of a man, maybe a little smaller.  Moving low to the ground, always out of the light.  

It was too much for me.  I was so frozen in place I’m not sure I was even breathing.  

I caught movement out the corner of my eye, something fast between the trees.  Close, maybe 30 feet away.

“Whats wrong Uncle Marshall?”

“Noah! Sweet Jesus you scared the life outta me. Get back in the house come on.”

“What’s wrong?”

“Go go go, into the house.”

I grabbed him and rushed back in, so quick I forgot to lock the door.

We heard a gun fire somewhere down the street and Noahs eyes went wide.  Could hear people shouting too.  Then more shots but this time they sounded like they were from up the hill.

I started to panic and I couldn’t calm myself.  Momma was talking but I couldn’t hear her voice, just a rushing in my ears and I was hot all over.  

I started thinking about my sister of all things.  You ever get that?  Something stuck in your head and you can’t shake it, looping over and over like a broken machine trying to start.  A few weeks before she passed she told me “Only takes a moment for everything to change.  Everything to be taken away.  You don’t know what your world will be tomorrow.”  I didn’t know what to say to her so I just sat there, holding her hand.

I had started repeating those words over and over under my breath and it took Noah pulling on my arm to shake me out of it.  My momma was shouting at me and I felt like I was going to vomit.

When I managed to clear my head I told her I wanted to go to the town hall but she wouldn’t have it.  She said there was no way she could walk that far or stay there all night.  The two of us were shouting at each other and Noah was getting upset.

The front door slammed open behind us and we all jumped near out of our skin.  Mr Winters was in the doorway, half carrying Rob who was barely conscious by his side.

I remember he said “Need your help.” and there was a tremor in his voice I had never heard before.  His face was shining with sweat and streaked with blood.

They stumbled forward together and Rob cried out.  Mr Winters swung him down onto the floor and Jesus Christ that poor boy was torn to pieces.  

I seen people hurt before.  Car accident when I was a boy, dog bite a few years back.  But I have never seen anything close to what I saw that night.  I can’t even imagine what could have done that to him.  

There must have been a dozen strips torn out of his chest alone.  Blood was pooling on the floor faster than you would believe.

“What done that to him? My -”

“I don’t know, Marshall.”

“But what -”

“Not now Marshall!  Get me water, towels, bandages if you can.”

I ran to get them as quick as I could but I was shaking again and kept dropping stuff.  When I got back Rob was gasping for breath, loud like a drowning man just pulled from the water.  His face was ghostly pale. 

I knelt beside them with the water and that’s when I saw his left arm.  Hanging in his torn shirt sleeve, hand stripped away at the wrist with nothing left but broken bone all white and jagged.  I had to turn away as I was nearly sick. 

There was so much noise, Noah crying in the next room and momma trying to quiet him.  I was muttering again under my breath and I couldn’t seem to stop.  Mr Winters was talking to Rob telling him to stay conscious and trying to press his hands on wounds but there were too many and too much blood.  

Rob was wanting to speak but between his ragged breaths and the wind from outside the words got lost.

Then nothing.

It was sudden.  He stopped breathing, stopped moving.  So quick it shocked us all into silence. Mr Winters slumped back, bandages half unrolled in his hands.  He seemed to be fighting with himself for a second before realizing it was hopeless.

A man had died right there on our hall floor.  Where Noah was playing with his toy truck that morning.  And we barely even knew him.

It all becomes a blur after that.  The hours mixed up into just the bits and pieces I remember.

Momma wouldn’t go and I couldn’t make her.  She just kept saying “Take Noah and get out of here.” and she wouldn’t listen she just wouldn’t.

Noah being pressed in to my arms and he started screaming for her when she pushed me back out of that door, clinging on so tight he was hurting me.

Mr Winters pulling my arm saying we couldn’t wait any longer.

I saw shadows moving in the trees, shadows the size of people but they didn’t move like people.

There were voices shouting on Mr Winters.  I saw the big main door of the town hall was open with light spilling out and people going in.

A car at end of road swerved wildly and overturned.  Another was half in the street with the drivers window smashed and no-one inside.

Then we were running to the hall, me carrying Noah, rain stinging cold and getting in my eyes.  Mr Winters had wanted to get to his car first but it was sitting in the dark of the trees and he didn’t think we could make it.  I heard gunfire again but I didn’t know where from.

We went inside the hall.  I saw Miss Jacobsen there already, she was holding her arm as if it was hurt.  I think there were about 10 of us there but I’m guessing.  I can’t even remember who.  Just scared faces and I was one of them, people who couldn’t do nothing, trying to block up windows and doors and a couple holding weapons they hadn’t looked at never mind used in years.

I was sucking in every breath like it was my last and I sunk to the floor still holding Noah.  He was crying and hiding his face in my chest.  A window smashed and people were screaming again.  Guns firing deafening loud in the hall and everytime Noahs body shook in my arms.  

I wanted to run but there was nowhere to go.  I saw people dragged out through the windows, wide eyed and fighting and crying for help.  I don’t know what took them.  I only saw flashes, clawed hands like dark wood, fast and hissing as they moved, never in the light.  There was blood on the walls where people had been pulled out.  I saw in the windowframe closest to me a bloody fingernail sticking up in the wood.  Through the smashed glass I could see the rain coming down in sheets and movement in the dark.  Dozens of shapes, too fast to follow.

I remember saying “My mom.”

“She didn’t make it Marshall.” Mr Winters was beside me again, his face was bleeding and he was loading his gun.  I think we were the only ones left but I can’t be certain.

“Did you see her?” my voice was trembling, “Because you don’t know, you don’t she could-”

“She didn’t make it.”

And his eyes begged me to stop asking and I knew why.

Then he was pulling me to my feet and telling me to run.

“What are we gonna do?” I said, “How are we gonna get out of here?”

“You’re gonna take Noah and run, Marshall.  The back road across the river.”

“Christ it’s raining like ice, must be 20 miles and-”

I never got to finish because he pushed me hard in the back and told me to start running.

The cold hit me.  Noah cried out and I tried to wrap my arms further round his back to keep the worst of the wind off him.  I was frozen on the spot for a second, still not knowing what to do.  Then another gunshot went off and I heard movement in the trees.  So I done what I was told and ran. 

Noah kept saying my name over and over, “Marshall Marshall Marshall” and I didn’t know how to calm him as I couldn’t even calm myself.  Could hardly get my breath to answer him.

I ran, between trees then through the shallowest part of the river, stumbling and crying like a baby myself.  I heard a gun fire for the last time and close behind us something fell in the dark.

I told Noah not to look, just close his eyes and hold on as tight as he could.  I thought any second we would be caught, those hands would grab us both and pull us down and there would be nothing I could do.

I fell more than once, so panicked I could hardly get my feet under me.  I just tried to turn it all off and keep going.  The pain, cold, exhaustion.  It didn't take long before I couldn’t feel my arms or legs from the cold so at least they didn’t hurt much more.

Wanted to stop and shelter from the rain, even for a moment.  Try to get my breath.  But I kept hearing things behind us and knew we couldn’t stop.  Noah was crying that he was so cold and shaking against me and I didn’t know what to do.

I thought of my sister telling me to look after him.  Thought of my mother.  It was all they ever asked of me and I was trying but I didn’t know how.

Hours must of passed.  Noah had stopped crying an shaking and I didn’t know for how long, I had been almost out on my feet.  I shook him, tried to make him speak or even cry or anything, anything at all.  

I stopped because there was no choice left and he was so cold and it was so dark I couldn’t even tell if he was breathing.  I took off some of my own clothes and put them round him but everything was soaked and freezing and I couldn’t stop.  

Do you understand?  I thought I heard those sounds behind us again and I picked him back up and started running and I didn’t know what to do.  I told him, look Noah it’s snowing.  Look, you were right.  But he didn’t answer me.    He didn’t answer and I couldn’t feel him breathing and I didn’t know what to do.

I kept running but it was too late.

*

We made it here at daybreak, just as the sun was coming up through the mist.  The world all white between the black of the trees and it could have been a dream but for the weight in my arms.

Couple of townsfolk found us on the road in.  They thought I didn’t want to let him go and I didn’t but it was really cause I couldn’t move my arms.  Cold and tired had locked up just about every muscle I had.

I’m in the house of one of the locals here who recognised us.  They got a doctor here, dragged out of his bed to come over.  He asked me what in Gods name was going on?  The police came through here last night, he said, going at a hell of a speed and haven’t come back down.  And had I seen Officer Winters?  Because one of their neighbors is missing.

I tried telling them the truth and they looked at me like I was crazy.  I don’t know what else to say.

I keep imagining I hear Noah crying.  That he wakes up and calls my name.  Like I saved him.  I keep on imagining it no matter how I try to stop.

Only been two days since everything was normal.  Two days and it’s all changed, everyone I had has been taken away.

Wonder what the world will be tomorrow.
