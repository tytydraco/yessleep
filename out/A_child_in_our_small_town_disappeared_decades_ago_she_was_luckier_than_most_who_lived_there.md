It happened on Halloween night in 1994. In a town of just over 500, the crimes we knew of were always mundane and not very much tended to happen, which is why the disappearance of little Janey meant so much to everyone. Kids were out trick-or-treating and parents were snuggled up at home watching cheesy horror movies, and by all accounts, it was a typical Halloween evening.

That was until the night grew late and the children in their adorable costumes made their way home with buckets full of candy. All were accounted for, except little Janey. The whispers of a disappearance only began the next morning, when word from the parents about the situation filtered down into the playground conversations of the children.

*"I hear little Janey was taken last night".*

&#x200B;

*"I hear the boogeyman got her".*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*"I hear she's never coming back".*

As the days went on, concern began to turn to fear. All of a sudden, the parks and streets were devoid of laughter and parents nervously shuttled their children back and forth between home and school. Not long after, search parties were set up in the hopes of moving closer to the truth, and practically the entire town spent days on end combing through the dense surrounding woods. Nothing was ever found. Not her bright pink backpack, not a loose hairband, nothing. By this point, the townsfolk gradually accepted the devastating truth of the situation at hand. The mean-spirited whispers of the children in the playgrounds were true, little Janey was never coming back. There would be no closure, no divine sign of her whereabouts and no indication of whether she was still alive or not. A few days after the search parties considered their efforts a lost cause, there was a vigil by the roundabout little Janey frequently spun round and round on. It took place past dark on a chilly November afternoon and the candles each townsperson was asked to bring along lit up the otherwise dreary playground. Sniffles and infrequent sobbing pierced the moment of silence preceding a speech by the mayor. The town never recovered after what happened, and that night was the breaking point. Many families left, fearing for the safety of their children and today the population is around a quarter of what it was in the fall of '94.

The events of that night and the weeks following it have been retold to the best of my knowledge. I use that phrasing because I was not there myself for the majority of what took place.

My name is Janey, and two weeks ago I received a letter in the mail. It was from my parents.

The truth of what happened that night isn't what you might have thought. The town harboured a vicious, sinister secret. My parents first told me about it a few weeks before Halloween 1994. Every 50 years, a cohort of children of the same age were chosen. Put on a terrible list. When the last child on the list reached the age of 18, they would all be offered as a sacrifice in a demonic ritual in the depths of the woods. Upwards of fifty freshly adult men and women were brutally torn apart and buried on the edges of the town. Forever forgotten about. Once the semicentennial culling was complete, the townsfolk who knew what happened were forced away. Urged to never return nor to tell anybody, lest the unholy forces the culling was designed for direct their anger at them. I was never told who these forces were, nor why the sacrifices needed to be made. My parents told me because I was on that list, destined to forever be concealed in an unmarked grave in those woods, surrounded by those who suffered the same terrible fate. They told me to disappear, to run as far away as I humanly could and to never return. They told me I had to forget about the existence of the town, of their existence and of the existence of everything I had ever known. To never tell anybody where I had come from, least of all whilst I was still a child. I couldn't risk being taken back. The revelation was followed by many sleepless nights and any moments of rest being punctured by violent nightmares. I wished to go back to the ignorant bliss of my childhood, to rid myself of the horrifying inevitability of my future in this town without leaving my entire life behind. But I couldn't.

Halloween was the ideal night for the plan because I could slip away in an innocuous costume and the adults of the town would be too preoccupied with the festivities of the night to give too much notice to a stray child had I been noticed. Much of what happened that night is a haze, but I ran until I couldn't any further and was eventually picked up by a truck driver under the pretense of being lost. I lied and told him I was from the next town over and eventually ended up in foster care when authorities couldn't locate my parents. I presume they might have found them, but they claimed they had nothing to do with me. If that is what happened, I remain grateful to them. I live a relatively nice life today because of their sacrifice.

If anybody is from a small town where a little girl named Janey vanished into thin air 30 years ago, please know that your peaceful existence is held up by an immeasurably evil secret.
