My eyes immediately shot to Mikey’s bed. He was lying there, facing the wall in the same position he had adorned the night prior. Last night… Was that all a nightmare? I didn’t want to find out. All I wanted was to put as much distance between myself and Mikey as possible.

I trudged into the kitchen, rubbing my eyes wearily. The tantalizing aroma of eggs and bacon greeted my nostrils. I practically floated up to the counter where Grandpa sat, reading the paper and sipping his morning coffee.

“How’d you sleep, kiddo?” he said, tousling my hair.

“Good,” I lied, hoping he wouldn’t detect the deceit polluting my statement. As silly as it was, I didn’t want Grandpa thinking I was a coward for having a bad dream.

“How do you want your eggs, Caleb?” Grandma asked over the appetizing noise of sizzling bacon grease.

“Scrambled, please.”

“Coming right up.”

“I sure hope your brother is feeling bett-”

Grandpa paused mid-sentence. A chill crawled up my spine as the atmosphere of the room shifted. We all turned our attention to the doorway.

There Mikey stood, still as a statue. The bug-eyes plastered on his face were now bloodshot and marred with bulging spider webbing veins. He was staring… straight at me. All the dread from the night before returned tenfold as I quickly averted my gaze.

“H-hey, buddy. You want some breakfast?” Grandpa said, coaxing him to join us. No response.

Mikey wouldn’t take his eyes off me. I didn’t know what to do. We sat in tense silence, waiting for something to happen.

“Okay, Mike. Let’s take a seat at the table,” Grandpa said, hurriedly rushing him to a chair. Mikey’s legs moved, but his eyes remained glued on me. I gulped, a dry lump working its way down my throat. Suddenly I wasn’t so hungry anymore.

“Uh, I have to go to the bathroom,” I said, excusing myself from my spot.

“Hurry back, Caleb. Your eggs are going to get cold,” Grandma said.

I nodded despondently and trudged to the bathroom, locking myself inside. I *had* to get away from Mikey. But how?

I formulated a plot, ultimately deciding to play a twisted version of hide and seek with my brother. I was never an overly creative kid, and it was the best solution that my sleep-addled brain could conjure up. I crept out of the bathroom, returning to my family. Mikey’s empty stare fell directly on me the moment I entered the room.

“Thanks for breakfast, Grandma. I’m not really feeling hungry, though. Maybe you could give it to Mikey.”

Concern washed over her countenance, sending a pang of guilt streaking through me like a lightning bolt.

“What’s wrong, sweetie? Are you not feeling well? Come, join us at the table.”

“Agnes, let the boy be,” Grandpa said, shooting me a knowing look, “he’ll eat when he’s ready.”

I mouthed a silent thank you as Grandma conceded.

“Okay, but it’ll be here if you change your mind.”

I bolted to my room, desperate to escape Mikey’s gaze. I hid there until he showed up, deadpan expression eating at my conscious. I ran, slamming Grandma and Grandpa’s door shut and slipping under the bed. I could hear his footsteps in the hallway, slowly tracking me down. It took him a while, but eventually he found me. Those vacant eyes sent a shiver rippling through my body. I again darted away to a new spot.

Things went on like that for the rest of the day. I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a little exhilarating. It was like a constant game of cat and mouse. Once nightfall came, I was exhausted. Hours of hiding from my brother had really taken a toll on me. I was ready to take a trip to dreamland and forget about Mikey’s weird behavior, just for a little while.

“Goodnight, boys. Sleep tight.”

“Goodnight, Grandma,” I said, rolling onto my side and promptly snoozing, Mikey staring at me all the while.

I was jolted awake to a freezing sensation slashing into my cheek. Wind. I was outside. Why was I outside?

I drearily opened my eyes, panic spiking through my chest like a spear once I realized where I was. I was met with a view of the stars and a labored dragging sound. It was me. I was being dragged through the snow. I started squirming, fighting to free myself from whoever, or whatever, had taken hold of me. I painstakingly rolled onto my stomach and the culprit was revealed. It was Mikey. And he was taking me to the lake.

I thrashed and convulsed in his grasp, battling tooth and nail to free myself to no avail. Mikey, or whatever had taken control of his body, was too strong. He tugged me by my shirt, effortlessly pulling me closer to the water’s edge. My shirt. That was my salvation.

I slipped it off just as we reached the ice coating the lake’s surface. Mikey continued forward unphased, as if he hadn’t noticed the sudden lack of weight in his grip. I watched, tears threatening to spill down my cheeks, as Mikey carelessly made his way to the middle of the lake.

Each reckless footfall sounded like a crashing meteorite. As he reached his destination, somehow completely unscathed, he turned to me. Those dead bulging eyes connected with mine, and for the first time in a while, I was able to discern a genuine emotion behind them. Fear.

Mikey lifted his foot and brought it down hard, cracking the ice. He raised it again, preparing to repeat the process. The ice was already brittle from where he’d fallen the first time. One more stomp and he was done for.

“Mikey, please. Don’t do this!” I wailed, pleading with whatever was in the driver’s seat.

A tear rolled down his cheek as his foot came crashing down, sending him plummeting into the frigid water. I waited, hoping to see my brother kick or flail or scream. But he didn’t. Mikey never resurfaced.

I flew back up to the house, sobbing my eyes out and waking my sleeping grandparents. Grandpa returned to the lake with the same bundle of rope from before. He searched the water with a flashlight while Grandma called the emergency services.

Mikey was never found. He was declared missing on this day eighteen years ago. I can’t truly move on from his disappearance. He’s been legally declared dead, but I know that he’s still out there somewhere.

Because every year I make the eight-hour drive to visit my grandparents. In the winter I return to the lake at night, free from prying eyes. Sometimes I swear I can see Mikey’s blue, tumescent face peering back at me from beneath the ice. And now, he’s always  [smiling.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)
