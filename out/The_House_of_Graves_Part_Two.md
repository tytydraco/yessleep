[If you haven't seen it, here's part one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kb2d37/they_call_it_the_house_of_graves/)

It was harder than I thought, keeping to myself the revelation of the encounter with a faceless version of my best friend. For a week or two after, looking at Raul made my head buzz with confusion and an undercurrent of fright, like it was full of bees. Luckily we parted ways early that morning.

I decided to wind down by doing a half hour session of painting; I’d hardly touched my supplies since we’d moved in. I had visualization issues, something a doctor in my childhood called aphantasia. If you told me to see a house in my mind’s eye, or an animal, it was like a fleeting blur, footprints washed away in the surf.

I needed references. I pulled up a photo of a woman’s face online. I started blocking out the rough colors. And I thought. And I thought. And I thought some more.

If I hadn’t been dreaming when I saw that other Raul, then what had happened? Had his face not coded into my memory? And there was another thing to consider, that it was the house itself, somehow. I hated that option, and I promptly dropped it as one did with all intimidating ideas.

I was adjusting to my inverse sleep schedule, much to my delight, but my friend and roommate Martin wasn’t of that opinion. He was convinced I was dreaming, sleepwalking what happened, and his wife, Rebecca, agreed. Raul was a bit more supportive, seemingly sold on the idea that maybe someone had come in and I’d seen wrong or misunderstood.

As for me, I had no fucking idea what to think. So many of my senses defied that sleep had been involved. I’d heard Raul, felt him bump into my shoulder, smelled his overbearing cologne, saw his…blurred, smeared, missing face.

Being on campus was a good break from everything. The contrast of Santa Fe and Halliton was like going from a bygone decade to present day. My hometown in Oklahoma wasn’t fancy, but at least we had a McDonald’s, truly a sign of wealth. With my head clear, I was able to keep my focus on my classes and studies, only nodding off for a few minutes in physics.

I met Martin in town at the electronics store nearest the edge of Santa Fe toward Halliton.

“Ey,” he nodded in greeting.

“You look like you’re waiting at the bus stop for your first day of kindergarten,” I chuckled. His puffy coat was ridiculously full.

“Better than looking like a bum,” he gestured to me. “Seriously, when was the last time you shaved?”

“I dunno, a week ago?”

“You do not pull off the five o’clock shadow, my friend. You need to commit to the full beard or nix it. You…” He looked hesitant. I wondered if he was going to apologize, but honestly it was true about the facial hair. “You look drained, Warner. You sure you’re, like, sleeping well? Hydrating?”

“Yes, Dad.”

“Ew. No. Never again. Let’s go inside.”

We bought the camera doorbell. Mostly, it was for Becca’s comfort. I considered broaching the topic of our house’s reputation to my friends as we drove back in our cars. I tapped my fingers on the stick shift as I weighed the options. It was better to do my own investigating. I was going to have to Nancy Drew a little, and research our so-called “House of Graves.”

God, what a damn awful name.

I rolled down the window as Martin started heading to the wraparound porch. “Hey, I’m going to the library to study.”

His shoulders slumped. “Dude, that’s just eating into your time to rest.”

“That’s my problem, stop shouldering all the weight, Mart.” I said it more gently than chiding.

Walton-Graetle Library was pretty big for such a small town, and the books near reached the ceiling. I had no idea where to start. My library experience was simply checking things out or going there to do homework when my shit dad sucked up random drugs into his nose. Mom seemed to think getting sloshed on wine made her any better.

“Excuse me,” I approached the counter where a man and woman were standing idly as kids tittered and ran around between shelves. “I was wondering if you could help me with something.”

They turned around. The woman was about my mother’s age, brunette with her hair styled choppy and upward, reminding me of a peacock with the feathers fanned out. The guy younger, probably somewhere between me and Martin, with wheat blonde hair long in a low pony down his back and trendy glasses perched on his nose. I already knew his car smelled like weed, probably the good stuff too. They seemed taken aback, probably having seen most faces around town over the years.

“Sure,” the older woman volunteered, chewing open mouth on gum. “Whatcha lookin’ for? Fiction? Nonfiction?”

“No, uh, I’m new in town.” They didn’t seem surprised at that. “I’m a little curious about Halliton. I like looking into the history of older places like this, and I didn’t find much on my own. Do you have old newspapers or something?”

Mostly true. Found fuck all online, to no surprise. And I was invested in Halliton, now that it was home for the time being.

“Sorta, some of the newspapers and public records are scanned here for easier access.” The older librarian explained. “Those things tend to wear out over time in print. For the rest, you’d have to chance it with the Historical Society, other side of the building, facing Briarton Street. Shane, you show him how to get around on that old computer.”

Shane led me to an area separated in a corner of the building, just shy of being in view of the periodicals. The computer wasn’t ancient, but certainly would struggle to run most newer software. Thankfully, the scans were viewable through their own separate app, hyperlinked with different years to navigate through. After Shane tapped and clicked around to get me used to the UI, I was ready to get started.

I decided to idly search through the years at first.

Anyone over the age of fifty would know about our house on Harrow Hill, Barb said. I selected the minimum year and decided to move forward from there. Most of the information was inane. Town fairs, fruit stands and farmer’s markets, mayoral elections, weddings and funerals. Funerals seemed the likely place to begin the macabre search I’d signed on for.

Apparently small town living was good for the body or something. Obituaries few over the years. Ten in 1974, eight in 1962, but an alarming spike in 1943, with a total of twenty plus obituaries. None mentioned Harrow Hill. And the number had to be accurate. Halliton didn’t seem like the type of place that would let a death slip through the cracks.

I wondered if I stopped now if I could forget everything.

I stopped dillydallying, wiping my clammy palms on the knees of my jeans, and entered the keyword “Harrow.”

*Ethyl Thompson, aged 92, left this world to join our Lord in her home at 8 Harrow Hill in the quiet hours of Sunday morning, surrounded and survived by her family of four sons and two daughters.* – Dated January, 1975

*Gary Cottle, a Town Hall representative, found dead outside his home on Harrow Hill, December 1st, 1975. Sheriff Cooke, lead investigator, determined no foul play. Cause of death likely due to a fall from a ladder outside his home on Harrow Hill. Gary, Halliton’s favorite local handyman, preferred hanging his own Christmas lights, according to his wife. A member of the local church, the townsfolk of Halliton will greatly miss his presence.*

Two in one year was a hefty coincidence, but not impossible. An accident and natural causes was hardly cause for alarm.

Until I found the missing persons. A young woman, February 1913. A mother of two, October 1943. And one that struck me. A little girl named Danielle Evers, 1993. It wasn’t her name, or the year that stood out. It was the name of her father.

Cohan Evers.

Cohan was an uncommon name, not popular by any means. It was possible there was more than one, in a town like this, but I couldn’t shake that as coincidence.

I wasn’t able to get much farther in my research before Shane approached apprehensively from the corner of my vision. I turned to him, and he cringed at interrupting me. It was all right, my brain had short circuited with the new information.

“Hi.” His voice was kind of nasal. He stood with his fingers playing and poking through a hole in his knit sweater. His eyes on the floor before he raised them to meet mine. “Um, you know, I’m curious, too. About your interest in the town. Where are you from?”

“Oklahoma.”

“Not too far from here.”

An awkward pause.

“I’m Warner, by the way.”

“Warner,” he repeated. “It’s kinda rare to have people move in here. Much less people that care about the town enough to research it.”

“You lived here your whole life?”

“Yeah. Most of us have. I can name nearly everyone in my high school graduating class.” He chuckled. “So, what are you looking up? I could probably help you. Our search system for this old stuff is kind of hard to navigate. I’m the one who created it, so I know some of her quirks.”

“Um,” I floundered. “Nothing in particular. Just some events, getting a feel for what the town stands for.”

“I call BS,” he said flatly. “That’s why I came over here. If you need something niche, I can help. Is it genealogy?”

“No, I’m, uh, researching the history of the house I just moved into.”

“Oh,” he nodded. “Not too weird, I guess. Where do you live?”

I hesitated. “8 Har–”

“8 Harrow Hill?” He finished for me, a little too excitedly.

“Yeah,” I admitted sheepishly. “Its reputation precedes it?”

“Um, yeah?” He pulled up a stool from a table behind the nook I was stored away in. “We used to call Harrow Hill *Hell Hill*.”

I hung my head. What the actual, pisspoor fuck?

“Are you kidding me?”

“Don’t get too excited, kids have gone up to check things out over the years and nothing has ever happened. All the popular stories are made up, sort of like the man with a hook hand kind of thing. Stuff that just gets passed around.” He bounced his knee and chipped away at the black polish on his fingernails.

That gave me some hope. Some. However, the spaces that hope couldn’t fill felt like they were being gnawed on by some toothy animal.

“What kind of stories?”

“Well, a guy in the grade above me, Michael Hitch, says he and his friends drove up in his truck and saw a woman run into the woods. His older brother told him that if he went to 8 Harrow Hill he’d find vodka and smokes hidden in the crawlspace. Up until after we graduated, no one had lived there. Kids will do all kinds of stupid things to someplace abandoned.”

I couldn’t help but agree with that. Raul and I once joined in on marking up an old mall with graffiti with other kids from my school before the police started catching on.

“So as he’s looking for the booze, one of his friends pulls on his leg, and he starts flailing everywhere, remembering all the old stories. 8 Harrow Hill and its supposed many ghosts. He books it to the other end of the space beneath the house, and when his head broke free of the dark beneath he *swore* he saw a woman all in black run into the woods and vanish almost on the spot.”

“Kinda cliche.”

“Exactly!” He snapped his fingers, revealing knuckle tattoos of your stereotypical alien head and a ouija board planchette. “People have no appreciation for the art of a good urban legend. Especially the real scary ones.”

“Are there any about my house?”

He opened his mouth, finger in the air, but drooped. “I kinda feel like it’s better not to know, as much as I love telling it.”

“Bro.”

“Okay, okay. There is…*one* story that’s based on something true. I’m not sure if I feel comfortable talking about it.”

“More terrible than calling my place The House of Graves?”

“You’ve heard about that?” He grimaced. “They called her Mad Marsters. The story goes back before the town was properly founded, just a few lone houses like a settlement in the West.”

“She someone who lived in the house?”

“So the story goes. It’s more of a nursery rhyme, but, like, gruesome? Kind of like a folktale kids and teens would tell around a bonfire to freak each other out. Seriously, I can tell it to you, if you want, but if you’d rather not know I think that’s the reasonable choice.”

“Fuck it,” I turned my chair around with a screech of metal against wood to face him. “Go on, tell me.”

Either he could hear my frustrated exhaustion, or really dreaded sharing, but he began reciting with an olden day gusto, back when ghost stories were a popular pastime:

*“Mrs. Marsters was a mother,*

*Seven sons and just one daughter.*

*Daughter said what had got her,*

*Cursed eyes black as midnight water,*

*Man of gray indeed the father.*

*Daughter Marsters had a son,*

*Out in 18 hundred 21.*

*Born with screams from twisted lungs,*

*Mother saw him Devil-spun.*

*Killed the Devil’s bastard son.”*

I took it in. “That’s batshit. Y’all learned that as kids?”

“Didn’t you have urban legends in Oklahoma?”

“Yeah, but like Sasquatch or The Deer Lady or a giant octopus in the local lake.”

“Oh,” he looked kind of bashful. “I mean, we have things like those too. Not the octopus. In a lake? How would it get there and survive?”

“I don’t know, I don’t think there’s such a thing as a freshwater – *what am I talking about?* So, the Marsters were a real family?”

“Yeah, it’s part of the reason the story exists. No one knows if the information is true. People tend to make things up about people who don’t conform with the standards of an era. Kind of like tabloids but with more blood spatters and spectres.”

“So she probably wouldn’t be in the scanned archives,” I pushed a hand through my thick, unruly hair.

“Nah, I know Tara like the back of my hand. Old media is a great way to dig up small town weirdness.”

“Tara?”

“Town Archive Retrospective Apparatus. A little tryhard, but I’m a very bored man. Listen, if you want my opinion, you’re not going to find anything in here easily,” he threw a thumb toward the computer. “About Mad Marsters, or the house itself. You’ll need the Historical Society. Maybe word of mouth. I can introduce you to Ulysses.”

I furrowed my brow. “Ulysses.”

“Yeah, he’s head of the Society, worked there most his life, and I think he’s about eighty at this point. If anyone knows anything, it’s him.”

…

I couldn’t bring up Danielle Evers to Cohan. Where could I even begin? Hey, I heard about your missing daughter? No way. 

When he came in for his usual snack run before setting out for the night, I saw him so much differently than before. How did one handle the pain of a missing child? When I left home at sixteen, my parents didn’t give a shit. My uncle Ken took me in until I graduated high school, and I never heard a peep about them since. I realized at that moment I owed my uncle a phone call. It had been a minute.

“You know, I never asked you before,” I started speaking to Cohan as I rang him out. “Aren’t there more busy places for a trucking job? I know Halliton’s honey and jams get exported all the time, but there have to be places that pay more.”

“Mm,” the sound sort of grumbled in and up through his chest as he considered my question. “My late wife and I were about your age. We wanted to live far away from busy cities without being too far for some creature comforts. Pay’s good ‘nuff since it’s cheap living in Halliton.”

I nodded. “Makes sense. Sorry for butting my nose in.”

“No need for sorries, you’re a good kid. Much better than that fella that works during the day. Nice guy, dumb as dirt.”

“I’ll try to keep myself smart,” I grinned and put his cash in the register. “Stay safe out there.”

Before he left, Barb came in. A rarity, to see her around others. Cohan nodded to her. “Haven’t seen you in a while, how’s your husband?”

“About the usual. Gonna visit him in the hospital tomorrow again.”

I blinked rapidly. I had no idea Barb was married, or that her husband was ill. Not knowing about Cohan’s life was one thing, man was an enigma until you got past his many layers of intimidating, stoic affect. Barb, however, was a massive oversharer. But I supposed talking about her staunch belief in extraterrestrials and her gallbladder was a little different from infodumping more personal things about her life.

“Doctors think he’s got cancer.” She explained to me as she set some energy drinks and some snack cakes. “They can’t tell what kind. Other day when I was able to sneak some time in with him, he’d scratched his neck to bleeding.”

“He was a smoker, right?” Cohan patted his denim breast pocket. “Know Hannah at Ermaline’s tries to tell me to quit every time I stop in for a bite. That’s the risk we play, after all.”

“Ain’t no damn throat cancer. They’ve sent tubes all up and down his mouth since he started getting sick.”

I’d never seen Barb this agitated before. Her hands shook as she gave over the cash for her purchase. Part of me wanted to put a hand over her shaking, tattooed one, but remembered who I was. The convenience store counter wasn’t just a barrier between us, it also represented the divide between the people of Halliton and myself. Fact of the matter was, I hardly knew these people, and wondered if I ever really would.

After they spoke a bit more, Cohan left, an extra stoop to his shoulders. Reminiscing about his late wife seemed to take a load of energy from him, and I felt no better for it.

“Boy,” Barb curled her finger at me as a gesture to lean in, as if we weren’t the only people in the building. “I have more to tell you about that house of yours, but I’m running late on my delivery route as it is. Are you free Sunday?

I considered it. I had no classes, but tended to use days like that for extra sleep. What Barb offered was still tempting. Too tempting.

“I am, until my night shift.” I admitted.

“Good. Give me some paper, I’ll write down my address.”

“You could give me your cell phone number, too.”

“Hate those things. Only have one in case I have’ta call in for an emergency or if someone updates me about Bellamy.” I assumed that was her husband. “Besides, it’s something I’d rather talk about with free time. Don’t want to spook you.”

*Oh, no,* I wanted to assure her, *I’m plenty spooked already.* “What time do you want me over?”

“I like to sleep in. Let’s say 3 o’clock.”

I could appreciate that. 

I tore off some receipt tape and she scribbled down her phone number, directions, and an address on Tremblay Court. I folded it and put it in my pocket, not wanting to lose it. When she left, I hung my head in my hands, a small tear freed itself from my eye and with shaking shoulders I steeled myself for another night of stocking and waiting on less colorful customers to come on through. I could not recall a time I was ever this overwhelmed.

…

I returned home as the sun was setting, about 5 o’clock. Martin was right, as the guy was annoyingly often, I had bitten off more than I could chew with my time today. I’d only have about six hours to eat and rest before I’d need to clock in for work. No one was home yet, so I threw the last of the leftover lasagna in the microwave, horked it down (burning my tongue), and practically threw myself into bed, hoping sleep would magically kick in.

Fucking 8 Harrow Hill. Normally, I slept with the lights out, curtains closed, but the idea of sleeping in the dark, or worse, resting consciously in it spun little threads of fear down my spine. A spider, slowly encircling what it intended to eat. Like I was being fed to the House of Graves.

I dreamt of bright, all consuming light. A circle above me through the ceiling of my attic bedroom. It was the sort of dream that you knew something more had happened once you’d woken up, but no amount of focus or force could squeeze even one drop more from your mind. All I knew was that I was rising, rising, rising. Drawn slowly into the air like the hot yolky substance in a lava lamp.

And then a drop. So sudden, so heavy, so windless. It was like a burst of gravity suddenly began to work on me once again, and I knew I had fallen.

I flung myself up from my dreaming. Sleep clung to me as cobwebs would, the last remnants of a spider and her web.

I wasn’t in my room. I couldn’t see, but I could tell. The smell was off, and what I’d woken up on was far from the softness of my mattress, even less soft than a carpeted floor. I fumbled for the phone in my pocket and frantically lit up the space around me. At first, the veil of sleep was still thick over my eyes, I couldn’t quite make out what I was looking at.

It was my basement art studio.

I knew where the light was now, and tripped over myself to get to it at the base of the stairs. I felt wrong, the back of me sort of gluey, my clothes sticking to me in something thicker than sweat. Once I pulled the string bulb, the room partially filled with light. I moved frantically to the painting I’d been working on that morning. All the shaping, blocking of color, the face I’d set aside to render more when I had free time. It was all gone.

The face was smudged away, blurred and smeared as if a hand had rucked itself through the paint and destroyed whatever work I’d put into it. I checked my own hands, and that’s when I noticed it. My hands were covered in tarry black muck. Twisting around to look at my back as much as I could, I saw that the same was true for the rest of behind me too. My back, my boxers, my legs, even the soles of my feet.

I hurriedly snatched up the rags I used for wiping up paint, and I saw it. The shape of myself, printed in the same black guck that covered half of me, and in seconds I saw a drop ooze down onto the floor. I looked up, and the same substance was seeping through the ceiling above it, also in the shape of my body. I cleaned myself up as best I could so I wouldn’t tread any of the mystery goo onto the hardwood floor above.

Another wet imprint of my body, and above on the ceiling, another. Upstairs, on the floor beneath my attic bedroom and ceiling above another, and the final connecting piece – black, sticky, tarry, gooey, tarry and strange – in the shape of my body collected like a wet ink blot all over my sheets.

The smell, noxious and sulfuric and acidic, burnt hair and brimstone and rank, foul piss. All of it hit me at once, and the next thing I could remember was the cold water hitting my back, running down my hair and into my face. My skin felt sore, that sort of boiled and pink feeling of having taken the hottest shower that the bath could churn out.

I threw myself out of the small glass shower, practically drowning in the hot steam, and I could hear my friends downstairs, laughing and talking. Maybe they hadn’t seen it, hadn’t smelled the mess that had overtaken every floor of the house. I don’t know how they could, but that must have been it.

My clothes were gone so I threw a towel tight around my waist, barreling down the stairs with such frantic speed that my roommates came to check on me before I’d hit the bottom.

It was gone.

“Warner, why are you only in a towel?” Raul asked, hand held up in front of him to block the sight of my damn near naked body.

“You didn’t see it?” I ran back upstairs to check the upper floor. Nothing. “You didn’t smell it?”

I checked, and I checked, and I checked. By the time I was about to fly down the basement stairs, Martin caught me with a firm hand around my upper arm.

“Warn!” He shouted, loud enough to make me flinch and started to bring some rationality back to me. “What the hell is wrong with you?!”

I looked around. Becca was crying, and Raul comforted her, wiping tears from her with the thumbs of the hands holding her cheeks. Martin was looking at me like I was some freakish creature. I pulled my arm from him and ran down the stairs.

“You have to see – I was – I –” Martin joined me at the bottom of the stairs. “No! It was here! I swear I – I’m not making this up! There was this black stuff, all stuck to me, and my painting, it’s all fucked up!”

“What are you talking about, man? What painting?”

“That one!” I pointed to it frantically, my eyes holding his beseechingly, hoping somehow he would take me seriously.

He walked past me and I pushed the wet hair from my face. I sat on the last step and hung my head low onto the caps of my knees, rocking.

“Warner, come here.” His voice was stern, but cracked at certain syllables.

I joined him and began to shake. “No, *no!* I swear, dude!”

The painting was gone, or rather, blacked out. Martin ran his finger across the paint and smudged it between his fingertip and thumb.

“Warner, you painted over this.”

“No! I didn’t. I came home, at the last of the lasagna, I…I fell asleep, lights on, and woke up down here. And I was covered in this smelly black stuff, like jet black, and –”

He cut me off with a soft, sympathetic expression, eyes like a wounded animal. “Warner. When Becks and I got home, there wasn’t a light on in the house. Not in the kitchen, the living room, or your bedroom. We could see that even from outside. The whole house was dark. And Becca and I shared the leftovers between us just earlier.”

“No,” my head spun, full of bees, buzzing and buzzing and buzzing. “I’m not making this up, I’m not –”

“You dreamt it.”

“No! I woke *up*. I woke up!” I explained to him the black tar, how it was in the shape of me, how it – *I* – had oozed through from the attic down with it. It sounded more and more insane as I relayed it. “I’m losing my mind.”

“No, it’s this situation with the convenience store, your classes.” He put a hand on my clammy shoulder. “You’re going to dry off, get dressed, and you’re calling out of work tonight.”

“I can’t.”

“You can. You told me before, your boss would be fine with last minute changes. You’re going to take some cold medicine, we’ll all watch a movie together to calm down, and we’re going to make you an appointment with a real doctor. One outside of Halliton.”

I found myself nodding slowly. It did sound nice, to spend some time with my friends and have some dreamless sleep.

“Okay.”

I went upstairs, and as I was pulling a sweatshirt over my head, I realized something. The bathroom, the basement, and even my laundry hamper once I started to fill a load in the washer. Nowhere.

The clothes I’d worn to bed had completely disappeared.
