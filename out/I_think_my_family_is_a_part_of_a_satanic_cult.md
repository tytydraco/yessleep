It was one of those countless nights when sleep eluded me entirely. My phone's light illuminated my face as my thumbs swiped through endless feeds, my eyes desperately seeking something interesting to focus on. Just another typical episode of my insomnia, or so I thought, until a sound changed the course of my entire existence. But I'm getting ahead of myself.  
  
Allow me to introduce myself.  
I'm Brianna, an ordinary high school teenager. My life has been a routine mix of school, friends, crushes, and the usual teenage drama. Since childhood, my life has been pretty typical. I grew up with loving parents—my mom, a devoted Christian, and my dad, who shares her faith but is less religious. I also have a little brother. My life was as mundane as it gets, filled with the usual family routines and high school drama, until that night. That night marked the beginning of a terrifying nightmare that would change everything.  
  
It was around 3 a.m., and for the past four days, sleep had been elusive until at least 5 a.m. I knew I had a couple more hours to go before the familiar heaviness would settle over my eyelids. Frustrated, I decided to put my phone away and try to get some rest. As soon as I closed my eyes, I heard footsteps outside my door, jolting me awake. My heart raced as I reassured myself it was just my mom getting up to use the restroom, like she did every night. But the footsteps didn't stop. I then heard another set, heavier and more deliberate. I assumed it was my dad, but a nagging thought crept into my mind, "What could they possibly be doing up at 3 a.m.?" Trying to shake off the unease, I closed my eyes again. But then I heard the front door creak open. A surge of adrenaline shot through me. The realization hit me like a cold wave—there could be intruders in the house. The footsteps I had assumed were my parents might belong to strangers. Panic set in, and I was frozen with dread. Little did I know, the truth awaiting me was far more terrifying than anything I could have imagined.  
  
Thirty minutes had passed, and the only sounds were the faint rummaging of items, fueling my suspicion of intruders. Yet, something didn’t add up—I heard my mom's voice, which contrasted sharply with my doubts. All sorts of thoughts raced through my mind, but nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to witness.  
  
An hour had passed, and I finally mustered all the courage I had. Frozen in terror for the past hour, I decided it was enough—I needed answers to the questions swirling in my head. I cautiously made my way toward the door and with trembling hands and a heart pounding louder than ever, I cautiously made my way toward the door. The door handle was cold as ice, sending a shiver down my spine as I gripped it firmly. Slowly, I pressed it downwards, desperate to make as little noise as possible. As the door creaked open, the noises became unmistakably clear. The sound of chanting filled the air, growing louder and more ominous with each repetition. It was a language I couldn't comprehend, and it only heightened my dread. My heart raced, and I felt the blood drain from my face.  
  
I took one step forward, then another, and another, until I stood behind the translucent curtain that separated me from the scene that would haunt me forever. Beyond it, the darkness was pierced by the flickering light of countless candles illuminating my home. With trembling hands, I moved the curtains and what i witnessed was even more sinister than it sounded. I saw around 4 people wearing a black robes which covered half of their faces only reaviling a slight portion of their face that allowed me to recognize my mom and dad. they all were holding a candle and standing around what looked like demonic symbol which looked like something a cult would have and it had been made with something red upon closer look, it looked like rice, red rice?  
  
Regardless of my will to go back to room and pretending i never saw that , my legs went numb and i was unable to move, as if some enity was holding me tightly in place, wanting my parents or whoever those people are to see me. I did everything it took in my body to move and beat the paralyisis i was experiencing and i finallly breaked free dashing to my room as fast as i could've possibly imagine while th chanting got deadly loud up to the point that when i closed my door i could still hear it loud clear. i feared about my brother and suddenly the voices stopped. It was over, but the terror of that moment lingered into my memory forever.  
  
Needless to say i did not get an ounce of sleep that night.  
  
The sun rised but I was still wide awake still processing the horrors of last night, Questions swirled relentlessly in my mind, each more unsettling than the last. Were those really my parents amidst that gathering? How could they be involved in something so chilling? And how long had this been going on for? My family shared everything with me but the word cult wasn't ever mentioned in our house let alone joining one. Our home had been filled with crosses and pictures of Jesus, symbols of faith and protection—or so I had believed. But the scene from last night painted a different reality, one that defied everything I thought I knew about my family's beliefs.  
  
As time passed by, my parents and bother woke up at their usual times and blended into their routines, soon it was my time to wake up aswell and i gathered all my courage and went out, facing my prents after what i had encountered last nigh. Mom lit up as she saw me and greeted me with a hug, while i still looked a bit uncomfortable, she asked me if i was alright and i, with a bit of unease, nodded my head. My dad soon left for office and my brother and mum went to their separate rooms, while breakfast was ready for me at the dining table, but i didnt feel like eating. Being alone in my own house felt a terrifying now but i seated myself, attempting to eat.  
  
All of a sudden, my thoughts were interrupted by a loud buzz coming from my moms phone, which she had apperenatly kept on the dining table. I was never a nosy person but after the events of last night, i was bound to find out anything more about the strange ritual yesterday. I picked up her phone and started going through it and what i found was beyond my wildest nightmares, beyond my imaginations.  
  
I swiftly grabbed my phone and a few clothes, then bolted out of the house. My only refuge was my best friend Ashley's place—the only person I trusted. When she saw the panic on my face, she let me in without a word. I spilled everything: the messages I found revealing my mom's plan to sacrifice me in the name of Satan tonight, the drugged breakfast meant to keep me asleep all day. I was terrified and couldn't think straight. Ashley calmed me down and went to get some water. Alone in the bathroom, I tried to steady myself. But then I overheard Ashley on the phone, saying, "She's here at my house." My heart sank. Was Ashley in on it too? Was my mom behind everything? Now, I'm huddled in this bathroom, typing quietly. Ashley keeps knocking, asking if I'm okay. I'm planning my escape through the window, wondering if the only people I trusted were the ones planning to end my life.
