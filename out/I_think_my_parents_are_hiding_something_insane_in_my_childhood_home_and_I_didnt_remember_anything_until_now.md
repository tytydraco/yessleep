It’s been a long time since i’ve thought about home. I haven’t talked to my family in about a decade, and I honestly didn’t have any desire to — until I got a letter. 

The letter was from my dad. It read all about what they had been doing in the past few years, and that he was “just reaching out to say hello” But of course, I turned the page and it was a plea for money. My mother had just passed away, and well, took all of her money with her. I’m not going into detail, but my father is essentially in a lot of debt. But then, he said something I most definitely wasn’t expecting. 

He apologized. He said he couldn’t say what for just yet, but that he would explain it all soon. Although I have no clue what that entails, it made me realize something. Not only had I not talked with my family, but I hadn’t thought about my childhood at all. I could barely even recall what happened throughout any of my life before I left. Luckily, I kept a journal that i wrote in all the time as a kid, so I just read through it and learned some disturbing information that I’ll share with you all now. 

Growing up, my family lived in a quaint old house with a rich history. It was the kind of place that felt warm and inviting during the day, but as night fell, an eerie atmosphere settled over the rooms like a thick fog. But there was one room in particular that stood out from the rest—a room that had been locked away for as long as anyone could remember. My parents always told me to stay away from it, warning that it was off-limits and not to be disturbed.

Of course, being the curious kid that I was, I couldn't resist the allure of the forbidden room. I spent countless hours staring at its ornate door, wondering what secrets lay hidden behind it. But no matter how hard I tried, I could never shake the feeling that something dark and sinister lurked within.

Then, on the eve of my thirteenth birthday, I decided to take matters into my own hands. While my parents were out for the evening, I crept down the hallway and fumbled with the lock until it finally gave way with a satisfying click.

With bated breath, I pushed open the door and stepped inside, my heart pounding in my chest. The room was bathed in darkness, the air heavy with the scent of dust and decay. I hesitated for a moment, the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end, but curiosity got the better of me, and I pressed on.

As I explored the room, I noticed strange symbols etched into the walls, their meaning lost to time. Old furniture lay scattered about, covered in cobwebs and draped in faded sheets. But it was the mirror at the far end of the room that caught my attention—a mirror so tarnished and warped that it barely reflected my own image.

Mesmerized by its strange allure, I reached out to touch the surface, but as my fingertips grazed the glass, a cold chill swept through the room, sending a shiver down my spine. I recoiled in horror, but it was too late.

The mirror began to shimmer and warp, its surface rippling like the surface of a pond disturbed by a stone. And then, in an instant, the reflection changed, revealing a dark and twisted version of myself staring back at me with empty eyes.

I tried to scream, to run, but I was rooted to the spot, paralyzed with fear. The dark version of myself stepped out of the mirror, its movements mirroring my own with uncanny precision. And as it drew closer, I could feel its malevolent presence enveloping me like a suffocating cloak.

Just when all hope seemed lost, I heard the sound of footsteps echoing down the hallway. My parents burst into the room, their faces pale with shock as they took in the scene before them. Without hesitation, they dragged me away from the mirror and slammed the door shut, sealing away the darkness that threatened to consume me.
 
But after that… the journal was empty. That was the last thing I wrote about. At least, so it seemed. As I was putting the book back into a box in my attic, a small sheet of paper fell out. It read: 
 
“None of this is real. This is not you. You are me. You trapped me here forever. Soon you will pay” 

So now I’m sitting on my bedroom floor, shakily trying to write this out. If anyone has any ideas of something I should do, please let me know. Should I reach back out to my dad?
