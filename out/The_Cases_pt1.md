I’m not supposed to writing this right now. I’m making my name up so they won’t find this post. What I’m about to show you can never leave this subreddit . I’m tired of hiding these things from the world and it’s about time you all knew the truth. Yes, cryptids, extraterrestrials, and the paranormal are real. They have been here far longer than we have thought but they don’t want you to know about it. I am one of the people who’s supposed to keep these secrets safe, but as I’ve come learn, secrets get people hurt.

I will not be disclosing my name for safety reasons, along with not revealing name of our foundation. We capture the unexplained and try to communicate with them if they are sapient enough for conversation. I will be disclosing a case we recently came across out our foundation. Some cases come in and they appear to show no threat to us or the world, but everyone once in a while we come across things that are a danger to society and must be corrected.

The first case I will discuss is Case #5 Mother Maren. This case was the first successful capture of a P class anomaly. Since we can’t touch the paranormal, we must rely on different rituals to keep them contained. This isn’t my area of expertise so I leave it to the paranormal containment unit. This is their first successful capture so kudos to them. From here own I will copy my logs I have kept over the span of three weeks and share them with you.

Researcher: (Classified)
Case #5
Subject: Mother Maren
Class: P

Log 1:
This is (redacted ). We have finally captured a P class anomaly. Subject is thought to be cause of three missing persons are incidents.The date is April 7th 2022, subject is subdued by a picture of a small girl hanging in the corner of the room. Subject seems to be drawn to the picture and will not turn away from it. Subject is a tall woman with long hair. Her arms stretch all the way down to her feet. Her clothing is a faded pink dress which is torn and tattered. Since the subject hasn’t turned around I haven’t seen any distinct facial features. I will now try make first contact with the subject a Spirit Box.

“Please state your name and age for me.”
Subject doesn’t respond.

“Subject 5, please state your name an….”

“Maren”

“Ok Maren, can you explain why three girls went missing in Beaufort, South Carolina?”

Subject ignored question and continued to stare at the wall. Ten minutes later subject points to the picture in the wall.

“Her”

“What about her Maren?”

“Can’t find”

The picture the subject was referring to was a picture of a young girl with long black hair. Subject continues pointing at the picture and starts to cry.

“Where”

“What importance does this young girl have to you Maren?”

“Daugh(static)”

“Maren can you please explain about the missing persons in South Carolina?”

“Thought…they….her”

“What happened to them Maren?”

Subject didn’t speak for 2 hours. After enough time passed I decided to leave the subject alone and come back another day when she felt like communicating. After this first interaction my mind felt hazy. My arms started to itch along with my legs. Don’t know if the was caused by my shot nerves or by the subject. Further research must be done. End of log 1

Log 2:
Five days went by and still no movement or contact with the subject. Many of my colleagues have felt the same itchiness while being around or looking at the subject.  We all went to the medical bay to see if any pathogen has found it’s way into our bodies, but nothing was discovered. Hopefully the subject will want to communicate with us in the next couple of days. End of log 2

Log 3:
We decided to do some hands on test with subject 5. One of the volunteers at the foundation went inside her containment and attempted to touch her. The subject didn’t seem bothered by our volunteers entrance.

“I will not be speaking. I don’t disturb the process.”

Volunteer nodded and continued to approach the subject. Volunteer touched the back of her dress. No side affects shown so far. At 9:06, volunteer started scratching his arms. As time went on the scratching started to grow violent as flesh was being ripped from his arms. 

“Let me out! Let me out damn it!”

Volunteer started banging on the door to be released but we could not risk a disease spreading in our facility.

“Please….it hurts! It’s crawling inside of me! Get it out!”

Volunteer continues ripping flesh of his body till his bone was exposed.

“I can feel them! It’s in my eyes!”

Volunteer proceeds to scratch at his face. After a minute he began to rip into his eyes. He finally mango rip both of his eyes out and the scratching stopped. The volunteer turned his body towards the observation window. Blood was running out of his sockets with pieces of flesh hanging off from his arm. The words that came out of his mouth still puzzle me to this day.

“Don’t let anyone in my room unless it is her.”

Volunteers body suddenly collapsed onto the floor. I was speechless at what I had witnessed, but these experiments must be tested. We decided not to retrieve the body and to blacken the windows, so we couldn’t see the corpse or her anymore. We had to rely on motion detection and our infrared cameras. My itch began to worsen after this experience so hopefully not seeing the subject will break the effects it has over me. It feels deep in my skin. End of Log 3

Log 4:
No motion has been detected and subject hasn’t moved on the cameras. It’s time to try and communicate with her again.

“Maren can you hear me?”

Subject did not respond

“Maren do you care to tell us more about your daughter.”

“Beautiful.”

“What was her name?”

Motion was detected and I quickly made my way to the cameras. The subject had moved her gaze from the picture to me. I went back to talk to her.

“Do you even remember her name Maren?”

This question appeared to enrage the subject as she moved from her corner to the observation window. I started to feel something crawling around in my chest. Without even thinking clearly, I ripped off my clothes and started to scratch my chest. It felt like bugs crawling around in my rib cage, at the time I wanted them out so I began to scratch harder. I could feel something crawling underneath my skin. Flesh started to rip as blood covered my hands. I started screaming from the agony I was enduing. Doctors from the medical bay rushed into take me to the infirmary. They tied to to the gurney so I would stop picking at my open flesh. 

The doctors poured rubbing alcohol on my open wounds to clean them off in case of infection. It felt like my body was being set on fire. After a couple of seconds the itching stopped and my mind went back to normal. They ran some X-rays to see if anything was really there but nothing showed up. I stayed in the infirmary to make sure it wouldn’t start back up again. After a while I came to the conclusion that being anywhere near subject 5 will cause the victim to feel as though something was inside of them. The closer you get the quicker it will happen. I finally recovered from my injuries and made up my mind that we could not contain the subject. We didn’t know the exact radius that would cause this event to happen so the foundation had to let her return into the world. It may not be the right thing to do but we can’t afford to lose anymore men. We will conduct test on residence of Beaufort to gather more information on how to properly contain her. I’m sorry. End of log 4, Case #5



To my readers, I hope this will find you well and you will stay safe. As for me I quit working as a researcher for the foundation 2 weeks ago. I stole some documents and audio logs to warn you all of the dangers in our world. They may want to protect you from the reality of it, but I want to make sure you all know what lurks in the shadows. I will try to post more cases when the time is right.
