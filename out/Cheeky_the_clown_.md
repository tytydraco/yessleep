It was me,my dad and my little sister driving down a dirt road in October 2016. I was shit scared of going out at night because of this clown bullshit everyone was on about at school.

We were going to my grandma's for the night and I hate to say it but we may of got lost and ended up on a random dirt road. My dad is an easily angered man so when he figured out his satnav wasn't working he was not happy. But tried to distract himself with the radio. 

Well me and my sister were playing eye spy and as we approaching a bridge she went dead silent and didn't move a muscle. She gently tapped me on the shoulder and gestured for me to look out of the window. And I shit you not somebody in a clown costume was stood on the bridge. We noticed a sign in his hand that read "cheeky the clown". 

He must've noticed we were looking at him as he waved at us and started to walk with the car. My sister waved back but I yanked her hand and told her to stop as I certainly didn't want to be on the news the next morning. 

We got off the bridge and he stopped following us. From what I can remember he was about six foot, certainly a good build and the costume only made him look bigger. 

My dad was oblivious to the clown as he was focused on the road and the radio. We continued too play eye spy for the rest of the drive and we ended up forgetting about it. Well my sister did I in fact didn't I was plagued all night at my grandma's thinking about it.

Well the next morning we were going home and decided to take the same dirt road as my sister said it was "so fun to play eye spy". But on the dirt road a tree had collapsed and we had to follow another dirt road which lead to the bridge. This took us until night we were on the bridge and this time I was on the side where we saw cheeky and I didn't see him. Until we had gotten of the bridge I looked out of the back window. And there he was with the sign but this time covered in blood. He began walking towards us and then began running towards us. My dad asked what I was looking at and as he saw cheeky with a bloody knife in hand running at our car he stepped on the gas  getting us away as fast as he could. 

Over the years I forgot about cheeky until last week I got a letter at my door I opened it and it said "cheeky hates that you don't visit him anymore". I thought it was just my sister playing a prank on me until a couple days after I received another letter it contained pictures of my house, my kitchen and most disturbingly a picture of me sleeping. And it contained a note "cheeky misses you" written in blood the blood looked extremely fresh and well for the next  part to make sense I need to go back about a month ago. 

So about a month ago I let my dog paddy out for a wee as you do. And he wasn't there when I shouted for him I searched my back garden and he wasn't there at all no trace apart from a bit of blood near the shed. I put up posters and searched all over for him but no trace of him. Until the letter. 

Behind the pictures and note there was hairs black curly hairs. Paddy's hair. I sent these in to the police and they confirmed it was Paddy's hair. I have since moved out of this house and gone to my parents and haven't received anything from cheeky. I haven't heard back from the police about this investigation since and I honestly don't know what to do this will most likely be my last post on this unless I gain an update.
