When strangers ask what happened to me, I tell them I was mauled by a dog.  That’s the quickest way to shut down the conversation. Sometimes there’ll be a follow up question, and it’s almost always, ‘What kind of dog was it?’ I tell them it was a pit bull, because that makes sense to them, and then I’ll change the subject so that they know that it’s time to shut the fuck up and talk about the weather to the nice lady with the scary face. 

I learned early on not to make a joke about it. For a while, my go-to response was ‘my blender jammed and I tried to fix it with my face!’ Turns out people don’t appreciate that. The kind of person who will straight-up ask you what happened to your face thinks they’ve just proven what a compassionate and concerned person they are by asking.  Throwing it back in their face is like a rejection, and it turns out that assholes are super sensitive about rejection. When you’re a woman with a face like mine, you’re not allowed to have a sense of humour about it. If you don’t play the dutiful victim and provide a relatable explanation, they will never forgive you. Women under 45 won’t talk to me at all, by the way. A face like mine is every woman’s worst-case scenario. They’ll just ask each other if they know what happened to me as soon as they think I’m out of earshot.  

Only my close friends and family know what really happened that night.  It’s a version of the truth that I knew they’d be able to digest. To be honest, it’s been so long since I’ve revisited what really happened to me that I can’t be sure that I’ll be able to remember everything. Although having said that, the minute I decided to write it all down, small details and even whole snatches of conversation from that night have come back into sharp focus. A little too sharp. After what happened today, I know I have to get it all on the record and post it online. Besides, there’s a chance one of you will come across this thing at some point.  And maybe my story will help you survive.  

I got very, very lucky. That’s the only reason I’m here. And that’s the season I can have a sense of humour about my face. I’ve cried enough tears in private about this over the years, and as far as I’m concerned that earns me the right to make light of the worst thing that ever happened to me. I have a deep understanding of the kind of bullet I dodged.  

 I’m a bottle of wine in, so excuse any spelling mishaps or grammatical whatevers. I write for a living now, because it’s the kind of job I can do from home, and True Crime is one of the last safe havens for journalists, so I’m hoping my muscle-memory of stringing words together is going to keep this legible as I get steadily more bat-faced drunk. Christ knows I’m going to need to be VERY inebriated to relive this night for you.  I’ve kept this door locked for a very long time, but I’m going to tell you now what my own mother does not know. Consider this to be your trigger warning. For all the worst things.  

..... 

Picking up a hitchhiker probably wasn’t my best idea, but I was getting pretty tired of sobbing in the car with no one to tell me to snap the fuck out of it.  There was still a lot of road between me and Sydney that night and what I really needed right now was an unsympathetic ear. I’d spent the last one-hundred Ks scouring the roadside for someone, and now here she was. A lone backpacker, trudging along the highway on-ramp with her thumb out. She had brown skin, a frizzy afro and a bright smile that she’d flashed as I drove past.  In the end it was that smile that moved my foot to the brake pedal. 

I watched her run lightly along the side of the road towards the car, lit red by the brake lights. She was short but solidly built. Light on her feet like a boxer. I bit my lip as the stranger trotted up to the open passenger window and leant in, her frizzy brown hair brushing against the top of the window. 

‘Thanks! It’s getting a bit cold out here. I’m so glad you’re not a man!’ 

I smiled at the strong kiwi accent. Maori, was my guess. ‘I know!  They’re so… rapey.’  

I gripped the steering wheel a little tighter, wincing at myself. Hitchhikers were supposed to be the creepy ones. Rapey? Seriously. 

‘They *can* be a bit rapey, yeah. I’m going to Sydney.’ 

‘Me too! Well... via my parent’s place on the South Coast?’ 

’Sounds good. Can I come? I can find my way from the coast.’ 

I smiled. ‘Of course. Should I pop the boot for your…?’ 

‘No I’ll just dump it in the back seat, if that’s okay.’ 

I realised that the back door was still locked. I fumbled for the button and unlocked it. ‘There we go.’  

The stranger didn’t open the back door though. She climbed into the front passenger seat and tossed her backpack into the back from there, nearly hitting me in the face as she did.  

‘Ooh sorry! Sometimes they drive off after your bag’s in. Force of habit. That’s why I didn’t put it in the boot.’ 

‘Ah! Smart.’ 

 She smelled nice, like sandalwood. 

 ‘I’m Natia.’ She pronounced it ‘Na TEE ah.’ 

 ‘Kate.’  

 We shook hands like we’d just sealed a deal, and I pulled the car back onto the freeway. 

 

..... 

 

It took an hour for the conversation to settle down. Fuelled by my nerves, I’d short circuited my default ‘chatterbox’ setting where I talk non-stop about myself and had opted for a continual stream of questions that I pop-quizzed at my new passenger. She had answered my queries with great patience. She was Samoan, not Maori, though raised in New Zealand and had crossed ‘the ditch’ to visit various cousins dotted around the coast north of Sydney.   

‘Okay, so there’s my Fat Cuz, my Rough Cuz, Rich Cuz and Shit Cuz. Every one of ‘em owes me money or a favour, so I’m cashing in. Fuck ‘em!’ Natia laughed loudly with a singular ‘Ha!’ ‘But enough about me.  I need to suss you out too, you know.’ 

‘Oh, sorry. It’s been like twenty questions since you climbed in and I’ve been grilling you non-stop.’ 

‘Little bit, yeah.’ 

My eyes left the road to check her face for signs of irritation, but there was that warm smile again. 

‘Were you crying when you picked me up? What’s going on with you?’ Natia’s voice softened with genuine concern, and I felt my tears gather themselves up for another outing. 

‘Well I’m going to Sydney to break up with my boyfriend.’ 

Natia shook her head and waved her hand in front of her face. ‘Oh no, I’m sorry.  It’s none of my business. Ask me another question.’ 

 ‘No, no it’s okay really. It’s probably good to talk about it.’ 

‘Well not if you start doing the ugly-cry and can’t see the road. You pull over if you start that shit, okay?’ 

I laughed, and my stupid tears retreated again. ‘Okay, safety first!’ 

 ‘And foremost, yeah. So you’re breaking up with him, but... you don’t really want to?’ 

‘I have to!’ 

‘Because?’ 

‘He’s a bass player.’ 

‘Oh, girl. Say no more!’ 

‘An American bass player.’ 

‘Cute?’ 

“Very. He’s been living here for five years, but he’s on tour now with this top twenty… tweeniebopper.’ 

‘Okay, don’t tell me who, I wouldn’t know ‘em.’ 

 ‘You wouldn’t want to. Anyway, Gabe has all these new Instagram followers because of that and he’s kinda …sleeping his way through them all.’ 

I winced and turned to Natia. There was no trace of the comforting smile now, but she put her hand on my arm as a consolation. 

I shot her a blurry smile. 

‘It’s okay. Really, it’s okay. I definitely should have seen this coming.’ 

‘Mmm hmm.’ 

‘I mean… I was one of those Insta-groupies myself eight months ago. Hashtag: Stupid.’ 

‘Well. Never say hashtag ANYTHING to me ever again… but good on you for pulling the plug. You deserve better.’ 

‘Oh I know.  I do. I mean ANYONE would. It’s just… I dunno.’ 

I sighed at the dark road ahead. ‘I was happy with him, ya know? I really liked who I was when I was with him.’ 

‘Wow, yeah. That’s so…’ 

‘Cringe?’ 

‘I was gonna say lame, but yeah… I know what you mean.’ 

 ‘I really didn’t want to cry my way to Sydney, ya know? And then I saw you out there in your leopard print tank-top and you needed a lift, and I needed to talk, and here we are!’ 

‘Well I’d stop for this tank-top, too. I’m glad you stopped though, girl. I was freaking myself out after the sun went down. It gets a bit creepy out there.’ 

‘Well you’re braver than I am. I could never hitchhike on my own.’ 

Natia sighed. ‘Well I can take care of myself. I’m a black-belt in karate.’ She pronounced it ‘kara-teh.’  

‘No shit!  Really?’ 

‘Nah not really. I make sure I work it into the conversation early though. How convincing was I?’ 

I smiled. 

‘Well, points for pronunciation, that’s for sure. Kara-teh. I would *not* be fucking with you.’ 

‘You BETTER not!’ 

 

…..

  

As the night wore on, the traffic was reduced to an occasional passing white flare. Now that I had someone to talk to, I could crank the heater up, and the car was now toasty and warm. Talking with someone was a much nicer way to stay awake than driving with the windows down and being blasted by the cold night air. Now the icy wind blew against the outer shell of the little red car, trying to regain entry. We ignored the night wind as it tried to scream its way into the conversation, whistling at a crack somewhere and trying its best to frost the windscreen. I turned off the freeway and began weaving my way through the unfamiliar back roads that led through the dense bushland, up and over the dividing range and towards the sea.  

’So what was creeping you out back there?’ I asked, once the green display in the dashboard had flickered over to midnight. 

Natia put her arms around herself, as if remembering the chill. ‘Oh, you know… nothing specific.  Just a feeling. Like somebody was walking with me.’ 

‘Oh that is creepy! Like behind you?’ 

‘No, more beside me. Like… it’s stupid, but I was thinking if I turn my head, I’m gonna see something walking next to me, staring at me with big crazy eyes, and a big smile on its face or something. Don’t worry, I know not to whistle after dark in this country. I didn’t summon the wotsit...’ 

 ‘Oh yeah, right the uh…’ 

‘Featherfoot, yeah. You guys have some scary spirits over here. Best not fucked with.’ 

‘Ugh! Goosebumps, look! Do you say goosebumps or goose-pimples?’ 

‘Goosebumps!  Who the fuck says goose-pimples?!’ 

‘Uptight Americans. Gabe’s sister said Goose-pimples.’ 

‘Oh fuck that. And fuck her especially! Fuck that whole family while we’re at it! AND their pimples.’ 

I giggled. Natia seemed to find the quickest possible route to ‘fuck ‘em,’ on every topic. Not in a bitter, aggressive way, just in a ‘I don’t have time for that shit’ kind of way, which was pretty endearing.  

‘I’m not that worried about spirits and ghosts or whatever but I’m always freaking myself out too,’ I said. ‘Especially when I’m driving alone.’ 

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Natia turn to look at me.  

‘Well let’s hear about it then! You’ve already got your goosewotsits going.’ 

I gripped the wheel tighter and shifted around in my seat, getting comfortable. ‘Okay, so whenever I see like a piece of clothing lying on the side of the road?  Like a shoe or something? I automatically think it’s all that’s left of someone. The only clue to some horrible murder.’ 

Natia laughed her single, braying ‘Ha!’ and clapped her hands together. ‘Of course! Yeah I always think that too. Like it’s evidence. I never touch ‘em when I’m hitching.’ 

‘And if you DID stop to pick it up…’ 

‘The killer will jump out from behind something and get you?’ 

‘YES! He totally would, wouldn’t he?’ 

‘That’s why he left it right there on the road, girl!’ 

‘Exactly! You think that too, really? When you see a road-shoe?’ 

Natia looked out of the window, surveying the darkness as it rocketed by. ‘Road-shoes. Yeah. I reckon everybody thinks that when they see them out there. That’s why nobody stops. They’ve probably been there for years.’ 

There was a silence in the car as we both stared out of our windows at the night, thinking of all the empty shoes lying beside all of the roads out there, and of all the killers lying in the grass close by, waiting. 

‘Okay what else you got?’ Natia said, breaking us out of our thoughts.  

I shook my head. ‘It’s too stupid.  You’ll think I’m an idiot.’ 

Natia punched me in the arm. ‘Come on, you started this. And I already think you’re an idiot. Instagram groupie…’ 

I sighed a long sigh, and held up a finger. 

‘Okay, but I’m not stupid.  Remember this.’ 

‘Righto, you get a pass THIS time!’ Natia turned away and muttered, ‘…crazy bitch.’ 

I laughed, and punched Natia in the arm. I felt very awkward doing it. I cleared my throat. ‘Okay, so here it is. You know when you’re driving along…’ 

I paused for a long time, milking the moment. Natia pursed her lips and widened her eyes. ‘Mmm hmm.’ 

 ‘…and you see a box lying on the road?’ 

Natia nodded, her smile faltering. 

‘Well… I always think… like the first thing that pops into my head is that…’ 

I turned and locked eyes with Natia. We both spoke together: 

‘There’s a baby in that box.’ 

We both gasped, a stereo gasp. It was such a cartoonish moment that we both laughed, Natia with her big singular ‘Ha’s, and me with my rapid fire ones. 

‘Well it’s the most likely scenario,’ Natia said, matter-of-factly. ‘Box in the road? Gotta be a baby in there, girl.’ 

‘Oh my god!  We’re both IDIOTS!’  

’No I’m not,’ Natia said, sobering suddenly. ‘There COULD be a baby in them boxes.’ 

‘Yes. Box-babies.’ I agreed, gesturing to the road. 

‘But who puts them there? And why?’ 

‘I know! It’s ridiculous.  But I can never run them over.’ 

‘Well, you shouldn’t, you know.’ Natia said, straight-faced. ‘You probably shouldn’t run down a box-baby. Besides, there’s a chance it could be a boxed-up fuel pump or something that's fallen off a truck. I’m not into babies, but I’m not gonna run one over.’ 

We both shuddered. 

‘Oh, I couldn’t live with myself! Can you imagine?!’ 

 Natia shook her head. ‘The box would be ruined, for starters.’ 

‘…and the baby! You’d feel it under your car… kaTHUMP! And you’d have to stop and look. Oh! I could not deal with that.’ 

Natia shook her head and said, ’That poor box!’ 

‘And baby!’ I added.  

‘Obviously.’  

The road rushed towards us, racing to connect us to the worst night of our lives. I can still see that dark road. For years it’s greeted me the minute I close my eyes to sleep. It’s been ten years since I picked Natia up on the side of that road, and I know that when I close my eyes tonight, no matter how many bottles of wine I’ll have chugged down by then, I’ll see that windscreen view, those quiet white lines rushing at me out of the dark.   

The monotony of the drive eventually wore our smiles away, and soon the conversation followed suit. I remember asking if she wanted me to put some music on, and apologising that all I had on my phone was Taylor Swift. ‘1989’ had just come out and I’d already listened to it all the way through three times before I’d stopped to giving her a lift. Natia had smiled politely and said, ‘Nah I’m okay thanks.’ And the conversation kind of petered out after that. 

 The wind whistled in at us now that it could get a word in edgeways. It sang to us of the killers it had passed on its travels, of the blood it had cooled against their itching palms, and of all the boxes it had passed on the road.   

Another hour passed in relative silence. The small red car plunged into the dark bush, following the winding road towards the coast. There was no oncoming traffic now, and the white gum trees arched over the road, almost touching in the middle. The little car plummeted down this ribcage of bush like a submarine in the deep, exploring the belly of some long dead sea creature.  

 Safe inside the car, I navigated the winding road as my passenger dozed beside me. My eyes fixed themselves on the path ahead as rain began to whip at the windows, drowning out the screaming wind. The drumming, howling roar set my mind’s needle in a dark groove. Up ahead, the road pulsed forwards, and I remember imagining the broken white lines to be a tally of the victims that it had claimed. Car crashes, pedestrians…I wondered grimly how much blood had been soaked into its skin. I thought of the tendrils of road dividing off again and again in every possible direction, covering the entire continent like a network of dry veins, waiting to be quenched. 

I’m not adding this in for drama, by the way. The more I write, the more I remember… the conversation with Natia has returned to me word for word. The thoughts I had… the sound of the wind outside… I’m remembering now that my right ankle was feeling tired from working the pedals, which is an insane level of detail. I guess when your mind has been through something like this, everything about that night gets seared into your memory, waiting for you to shine a light on it.  

I’m getting shaky now - I know what lies ahead. I have my meds handy, sitting just within reach beside my laptop, but it’s not time to take them yet. 

 

..... 

 

It had stopped raining, and Natia was still sleeping soundly when I saw it. It was waiting for us up ahead, sitting on the wet road just left of the broken white lines. I nudged my hitchhiker awake. 

‘Natia! Look!’  

‘What? Wassat?’ She sat up a little, rubbing at her eye. 

‘It’s a box,’ I said. 

Natia snapped fully awake with a jolt. ‘Fuck off,’ she said. 

‘No I think it is! Look…’ 

Natia leaned forwards, squinting. 

It was definitely a box. A worn brown cardboard box, with shiny brown tape criss-crossing around it, sitting in the middle of the road. It was coming up fast. 

Natia turned to me. ‘Run it over.’ 

‘What?! I can’t!’ 

I turned back to the road, just in time to see the box baring down on us. I swung the wheel to the right, and the car swerved away from it and onto the opposite side of the road.  

Natia shot a hand out to the dashboard. ‘SHIT!’ 

I pressed my foot to the brake pedal and jerked the wheel to the left. The car lost its footing on the road, skidding sideways. 

‘No! Fuck!’ I eased my foot off the brake and then pressed it again softly. The car skidded sideways down the road, tyres screaming for purchase on the wet seal-skin tar. The steering wheel ripped itself from my hands, almost breaking my thumbs in its thick whirring spokes. I gripped it again and seized control of the thing. The scenery spun past us.  

Road.  

Bush.  

Road.  

TREE. 

I slammed my foot into the brake pedal, and the car stopped with the sudden chunking sound of roadside gravel. A gigantic tree stood only two meters from the headlights - an ancient, impossibly huge ghost gum, white and smooth. The headlights reflected back onto us off the tree’s iron skin as we stared at it, our thoughts shattered by thundering hearts. 

‘Are you.. you okay?’ I heard myself say. 

Natia did not turn her head. She spoke as if addressing the tree. ‘I’m alive, yeah. Not okay. Fuck no I’m not!’ 

I shook in my seat, thumbs throbbing. The tears wanted to come, but they were too far down on my body’s list of priorities right now, so I cried with my voice. ‘I’m so, so sorry.’  

I put my hands to my mouth, thumbs stinging. 

‘It’s okay. You did okay. We’re okay,’ Natia told the tree. ‘Probably saved us, girl. Good job.’ 

I turned and looked at her. 

It was the first time I had really seen Natia’s face clearly, lit so brightly by the light reflected from the tree. I’d thought she was older than me, but she looked younger in the bright light, her eyes big and brown.  I nodded at her, and Natia smiled so brightly that I had to look away.  

I exhaled a shaky breath, threw the car into reverse and backed it onto the empty road, parking it just behind the two ragged tyre tracks where we had veered off. I wrenched the park brake into position and before I knew I had done it, I’d unbuckled my seatbelt.  

‘I just have to check the car. It’s a piece of crap but it’s my brother’s. I think we hit the…’ 

I opened my door and stepped out of the car on legs that felt more like cooked noodles. The black rubber lines on the wet road circled and snaked behind the car, taking my thoughts with them.  Back down the road… to the box.  

It sat there quiet and square, lit red by the rear lights. It was still intact.   

I hadn’t hit it.  

 ‘Natia, come with me!’ I said. My eyes were glued to the box.  I could not look away.  There’s no other way to describe it.  

Natia opened her door and popped her head out. 

’The fuck I will! Get back in the car.’ 

I strode towards the box on my noodles. I wore my hair shoulder-length back then, and it whipped around my face in the wind. My feet were numb.  

The box sat waiting for me.  

‘Kate! Jesus. Get back here!’ Natia hissed, keeping her voice down. 

I was only meters from it now. The bottom of the box was slightly soaked from the road, but the rest of it was dry. 

‘It must have been put here after the rain…’ I called over my shoulder. 

Natia glanced furtively to her right, at the dark gaps between the trees. ‘Leave it!’ She pleaded. ‘Please, girl. Leave it there. Let’s go.’ 

‘I’m just going to move it off the road. It’s gonna cause an accident!’ 

 I had reached the box. It was only knee-height. I put my hands around it and lifted it. I loosened my grip and dropped it. It wasn’t empty. 

 I fumbled around the sides, stretching my numb fingers along the slick brown packing tape, feeling for the end. I found it and pulled it off the cardboard, releasing the flaps in the top.  I dug in my jeans pocket for my phone and switched on the LED torch.  In one hand, I held the phone, shining the quivering light into the box as I opened it with my free hand. 

I couldn’t speak. The world sank around me as I stared at the small thing huddled at the bottom of the box. 

‘Fuck…’ I said, ‘Oh fuck.’ 

‘What! What’s in there?’ 

‘It’s a baby!’ 

Natia slammed her door and stormed towards me and the box. ‘Don’t you fuck with me, now.’ she said. 

I looked at her, feeling the blood drain from my face. ’Shit, what do we do? It’s a baby.’ 

 Natia ran towards me and jabbed her finger at me as she spoke. ’Don’t fuck with me!’ she shouted. ‘I hate pranks.’ She looked down into the box. ‘Fuck me! It’s a baby.’ She grabbed the phone from my fingers and shone it into the box. 

The baby was no more than six weeks old, pale white and curled up on its side on top of a dirty blue blanket.  Its tiny hands were clenched in front of its mouth. Its lips were blue, and its white skin was a network of faint purple veins. Beneath the blue blanket, the bottom of the box was covered with what looked like finely crushed eggshells. 

‘It’s a fucking baby. A dead fucking baby in a box…’ Natia said, as if narrating the scene for the visually impaired. The baby was dressed in a dirty light blue singlet and a disposable nappy, and it stirred as the night air began to seep into the opening of its box, drawing its knees up tighter. 

We clutched at each other, eyes wide and glued to the not-quite-as-dead-as-it-looked baby in the box.  

‘He’s alive,’ I said, dumbly. ‘Jesus he’s…’ 

‘And I told you to run it over…’ said Natia, ‘We could have… oh my God, Kate. What do we DO with this fucking box-baby?!’ 

We stared at each other, horrified. 

Natia grabbed me and shook me. ‘It’s a fucking box-baby.’ she repeated, shock having reduced her to relating the obvious. 

‘I know!’ A fresh wave of horror washed through me like ice water. ‘It really is.’ 

The baby let out a tiny cry, huddling into itself, shivering. 

Natia stepped back, as if the baby were a bomb that had just armed itself. 

I reached into the box and scooped up the tiny creature. 

‘Oh he’s like a bag of ice…’ 

‘We need to call someone NOW,’ Natia commanded. ‘Like right now we need to call triple-one.’ 

’Triple-oh.’ 

’Triple somethin’, girl because someone left a baby in a box. On the fucking ROAD.’ She was whipping the light around at the roadside now, scanning the dark, dripping trees for whoever had done this.  

After a moment, Natia turned her efforts to calling for help, swiping and tapping at the screen. The wind had died down, and I noticed that the bush was completely silent. Not a single chirp from a cricket or the usual chorus of frogs ringing through the trees. It was as though they were all watching us, silently engrossed in our little drama. 

‘There’s no signal out here.’ 

I was still rocking the baby, which slept on, nestling into me. There was a faint smell on its breath, which at the time I couldn’t place. It was sour milk mixed with something sweet and syrupy. 

I realised six months later what that smell was. While I was still in intensive care, my brother had smuggled alcohol into my hospital room - a can of Bundy and cola. The second I smelled that sickly sweet rum, I recognised it from the night I’d lost my face and threw up hospital food all over the bed. I knew right there that I would never drink another drop of rum. Now I can say without a doubt that someone had dosed that baby up with rum in its bottle so that they could box it up without waking it.   

My tears were coming now. I looked up at Natia and she must have seen the total helplessness I was feeling because she took a step forward and softened her voice.   

‘It’ll be okay now. We’ll take it to a hospital… somewhere.’ 

I nodded, and turned to take the baby back towards the car. 

‘Hang on, girl! We should bring the box. The cops are gonna want to dust it or something.’ 

Natia bent and grabbed the box, which peeled off the wet road with a faint sucking sound. She followed me back to the car, still scanning the silent bush for whoever had left it out there.  

I opened the driver-side door and carefully eased myself into the seat, holding the fragile thing in the crook of my elbow.  I leant to the side and pulled the lever that pushed the seat back a foot or so from the steering wheel. 

 ‘Will the box fit in the boot?’ Natia asked from outside. 

‘No there’s not much room in there.  We probably shouldn’t crush it down. Chuck it on the seat behind me?’ 

 Natia opened the back door and put the box carefully on the seat beside her backpack. 

‘Will it need its blanket, do you reckon?’ Natia asked, pulling it out of the box and brushing the eggshells off it. 

‘He might, yeah,’ I said. 

Natia held the old blanket up to her nose. 

 ‘Ugh, smells like oil or something. Better leave it.’ She threw the blanket back into the box, and then paused.  ‘Oh shit!’ she said. She reached into the box and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper, which was folded into a square. She unfolded it, her hands shaking, and read it to herself.  

 ‘What the fuck…’ she whispered. Then she slammed the car door and shouted ‘Hang on!’ 

 ‘What?’ 

 Natia trotted around the car, gripping the piece of paper in her fist. 

 ‘What?’ I repeated, blinking as Natia passed the headlights. 

‘There’s a note! Hang on.’  

She bundled herself into the front passenger seat and shut the door against the night chill. 

‘They left this under the blanket. Holy shit, Kate.’ she said. 

‘What? What’s it say?! Show me.’ 

Natia fumbled with the note, and then unfurled it so that I could see. Scribbled across the paper in thick black marker were the words:

DON’T LET IT KNOW YOUR NAME.
