 

My brother Dylan adopted a dog from the cat and dog shelter last week. At least that's what it looks like, but I'm not sure.

I first saw him when I was walking back from the bus stop. He was eating the grass while my brother stood there holding his lead distracted on his phone. "Dylan!" I shouted. "You never told me you had a dog!" I called out, patting my legs.

"Yep, I did! Adopted him. His name's Coco, German Shepherd."

Coco finished chewing on the long bits of grass and glanced at me, I've saw many dogs but this one freaked me out. His eyes were very human like. But, he wasn't excited or jumpy or anything like other dogs. He just stared blankly with his cold eyes.

"He's so big!" I exclaimed while crouching. "Can I pet him?" I asked.

"Erm, he's a bit uncomfortable right now." said Dylan looking at Coco. "I have to give him time to loosen up and get comfortable, well that's what the shelter said." he explained. He looked at his watch. "Oh shit!" he called out. "I've got to go. C'mon Coco!" he said while tugging his lead.

I stared at them while they walked away, Coco glanced back and quickly turned away.

\*\*\*

The next time I saw Coco was on Thanksgiving. I had to pick up Dylan and take him to Mamar's house. (Nickname for Mom.) So I decided, it would be good if we just chilled for an hour then I took him.

As, I pulled up I saw Coco at the window staring at me, not my body my eyes all the way till I got to the door. I rang the doorbell and I heard tapping coming towards the door. I turned around looking at my Audi SQ7 parked outside his house. I turned back around to find Coco staring at me through the window at the door. I jumped out my skin.

The door creeked open. Dylan stood there, "Hey, you're a bit early!" he said joyfully.

"Yeah, just thought I'd catch up" I said while looking at Coco who was staring at me with no emotion with them blank eyes.

"Come on in then!" he said while holding open the door. "Want a coffee?" he asked.

I nodded. Dylan made the best coffees, he has a coffee shop near the beach and it's won every year for best coffee. I couldn't say no. I followed Dylan to the kitchen and Coco followed directly behind me.

\*thump thump thump\* Coco had heavy footsteps, nothing like a normal dog. On a normal dog you would hear the nails clicking on the floor like, \*click click click\*. I shrugged it off.

I glanced back at Coco, and watched how he walked, he walked like side to side. Very clumsily, like a penguin waddle, but with all fours.

"Hope you like Americano," Dylan said, as he pulled the mug from the coffee maker.

"Wow, that smells like heaven" I said, taking the mug from his hand. He laughed as he sat down at the table.

"Learned from the best" he said, then pointing to a picture of our Nana. "I miss her." he said, frowning.

I lifted the mug, blowing on it. I sucked the brim and liquid came out, it was boiling. My mouth burned.

I looked to the right, and there was Coco, watching, staring, lurking.

I heard grumbling. "Ohhhhh. I need to go to the bathroom. Excuse me." he said, coughing and rushing out the room upstairs.

"You're a bit of an odd dog." I said, looking at him while taking little sips.

He just \*stared\*.

"What?" I asked, looking behind me, nothing. I looked back at him, still staring.

"Your daddy is very nice, he is going to look after you." I said, in a baby voice.

Coco looked down at the floor.

His fur was very rough, not soft like it should be. \*\*Rough\*\*. I analysed him even more until.

I heard something.

A quiet noise that came from the dog. It sounded like a whisper. I stared at him, amused. It sounded like a human, \*whispering\*.

"\*help me\*"

I pushed back the chair and stood up. What the hell did I just hear. I raced around the chair back and forth, thinking. Freaking out. That dog, had just spoke the human language. It stared at me, blankly.

I heard a flush then groaning. Followed by footsteps, I sat back down and held my mug.

"Hehe, sorry about that just got a stomach ache, you know?" he chuckled, as he sat back down facing me. "Anyways, how was the coffee?" he asked, holding his hands.

"Spot on, just how I like it!" I said. "Wait.." I recalled something. "SHIT!" I called out. "Thanksgiving isn't this week, it's next week, Mamar and Papa are on vacation!" I said, hitting my head.

Dylan chuckled. "Rookie mistake, buddy." he patted my shoulder. "Well, in that case you better get going." he said, walking through the hall.

I stepped out onto the porch, I walked over to my car. I waved at Dylan and Coco, Dylan waved back, smiling. While, Coco stared. That stare sent a shiver down my spine.

\*\*\*

"I swear to god, that dog is fucked up."

The kids were asleep, Me and my wife were sat on the couch, beer in hand, with The Wolf Of Wall Street playing in the background as we talked about our day.

"So, you're saying it only stares?" she chuckled, while sipping her beer.

"Yep."

"And.. he walks weird, and never barks?"

"Spot on." I said, while doing the O symbol with my hand.

She laughed while shaking her head, "That sounds so odd, I remember my friends dog, also did this weird screeching noise."

I laughed as she laughed with me, we exchanged stories, downed beer, and then went to sleep. I was lying on the couch, wide awake. An idea popped into my head, what if I snuck and watched Coco and Dylan. I giggled thinking about it, testing if he's a good security dog! I probably wouldn't of done it without the beers, but the beers give you courage.

I went downstairs grabbed my keys and got in the car and went to Dylan's.

I parked over the road, and snuck into the front porch and stared into the window, I'm surprised Coco didn't see me.

Light of the chandelier filled his living room, Dylan was on the couch on his laptop while Coco was on the floor, lying down.

After 5 minutes, Dylan got up and closed his laptop and disappeared upstairs. Coco stared, but didn't take tail.

I was walking back to my car, then I saw something on the corner of my eye.

Coco was stood up in the living room on two hind legs, a small opening appeared in his chest and a human hand came out and snatched the Dominoes, Dylan was eating.

I stared through the window, heart beating rapidly.

What is that thing?

A costume or a whole different creature.

I ran out of there, hoping it didn't see me, I stubbly ran to my car, started it up and sped off. I got to my house, opened the door and locked it. I checked it was locked about 10 times.

I got up to bed and wrapped up in a blanket like a sausage in bacon on Christmas. I was awake, thoughts going through my head like a wildfire.

I didnâ€™t expect to fall asleep. But I must have, because the next thing I knew, a loud bang woke me up in the night.

\*thud thud thud\*

\*\*Knocking.\*\*

Someone was at my front door, someone or something.

I opened my phone, and checked my ring doorbell. It was Coco. Headbutting my door. I called the cops, and got the footage. I don't know what that was but it haunted me for the rest of my life.
