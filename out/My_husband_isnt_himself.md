My husband has always been an asshole. We got married fresh out of high school, and he gave me a black eye for our first wedding anniversary. He drinks every night, he cheats every other night, and I swear every fucking dollar he gets he spends it on the pokies. In short, he’s a good for nothing piece of shit. And I’m stuck. I’m a stay at home mum with a 3 year old and a toddler with no friends and no family worth talking to. 

I felt so trapped for so long but things have been different recently. He came home from work last Friday at 6PM, just in time for dinner. Except he’s never on time. We’ve had the same argument about him getting home at 2AM reeking of beer and weed more times than I can count. But… there he was. He came in and gave me a kiss, then kissed our two daughters on their foreheads, then jumped in the shower. 
I was stunned. We had dinner, and he asked about my day, put the girls to bed, then cuddled me on the couch while we watched a movie. He didn’t even crack a beer. When we went to bed that night he cuddled up to me and kissed my neck. Then he said, “I love you” for the first time in… god, years. 

I slept in the next morning. Normally he wakes me up at 5 so I can make him breakfast, but I woke up at 6!!! And he’d made breakfast! I can’t even tell you the last time someone cooked for ME! He gave me a hug and a kiss before he left for work. He’s never been like this. Even when we were in high school he was a dick. I guess when you’re a loser and he’s gorgeous and popular you tend to overlook things. Anyway, when he got home that night he’d brought me flowers! We had the best sex we’d had in years that night. 

I did find something weird a few days after this change, though. I was doing laundry and some of his clothes had blood on them. Not a huge amount, but more than a few drops. He does work a manual job though, so I dismissed it as a workplace injury. When I found human teeth in his underwear drawer… that was a little more concerning. 

I began to watch him a little closer. It was easy, I wanted to be close to him. We went out on a date night to a movie and we were cuddling in the theatre. He runs hot now. Like- space heater hot. 
Also he normally wears this ratty singlet around the house but he’s started wearing button ups (I’m not complaining) but I caught him with his shirt off the other day when he was changing. He has this squiggly, circular scar on his left shoulder blade now. It looks years old but I swear it’s new. 
The most damning thing was when I caught his reflection in the bathroom mirror the other day. I was in the shower and he came into the bathroom to grab something. We made eye contact in the mirror and I swear his eyes were completely black. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that my husband is a demon. Or something like it. Possessed by an unholy being or spirit or whatever. I’ve also come to the conclusion that I don’t care. This demon is way better than my husband ever was. He’s sweet and romantic and loving. He’s a great father, too! Fuck you, Craig, I’m glad you got possessed.
