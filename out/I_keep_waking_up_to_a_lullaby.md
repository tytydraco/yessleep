I used to think sleep paralysis was just one of those quirky brain glitches that you read about on WebMD at 2 a.m. Something like: your body falls asleep while your brain stays awake, so you see things that aren’t really there. Science, right?

But science didn’t prepare me for the lullaby.

It started one night in late January. I’d been stressed out, work deadlines, my mom recovering from surgery, bills stacking up. I chalked it up to insomnia. I woke up around 3:30 a.m., the house dead quiet. My room was dark except for the glow of the streetlight bleeding through the blinds.

And then I realized I couldn’t move.

I’d heard of this before, sleep paralysis. I told myself it was normal. Just wait it out. But then, as my eyes adjusted, I saw someone sitting in the chair across from my bed.

At first, it looked like a shadow. Tall. Slouched forward. Too still. Its face was hidden, but I could see the curve of its shoulders. I wanted to scream, but my chest was locked.

That’s when it started humming.

The sound was soft at first, a tuneless murmur that almost sounded like static from an old radio. Then, clear as a bell, it turned into a lullaby.

Goodnight room… Goodnight moon… Goodnight noises everywhere…

My blood turned to ice. It was the voice of a woman, gentle, sweet, motherly. But warped, like someone dragging their nails across a music box cylinder.

I grew up with Goodnight Moon. My mom used to read it to me every night until I was too old to admit I still liked it. Hearing that voice sing it now, in my dark bedroom, while I couldn’t move it made me want to claw my skin off.

The shadow leaned forward. My eyes strained against the dark, and I could almost make out its face. Not quite human. The skin too pale, stretched too tight. Its eyes were pits, reflecting no light at all.

Goodnight cow jumping over the moon…

Tears leaked from my eyes. I tried to close them, to shut it out, but I couldn’t. My body wouldn’t respond.

And then it whispered.

Not singing anymore. Whispering. Right into my ear, though its mouth was across the room.

“You never said goodnight to me”

The paralysis broke like a snapped chain. I shot upright, gasping, clawing at my throat. The chair was empty. My bedroom door was shut. I was alone.

Or I thought I was.

The second time was worse.

Two nights later, I was careful. I left the TV on for background noise, set my phone flashlight within reach. I thought maybe it was a one-off stress hallucination.

But at 3:27 a.m., I woke up again. Frozen. Same position.

This time, the humming started immediately.

Goodnight kittens, and goodnight mittens…

The chair was empty. But the voice was closer. Much closer.

I realized with growing horror that it wasn’t coming from across the room. It was behind me.

I couldn’t turn my head, but I could feel the weight on the mattress. The slight dip, like someone kneeling right beside me. Warm breath tickled my ear.

Goodnight clocks, and goodnight socks…

My tears soaked the pillow. I prayed, begged silently, promised anything if it would stop.

The singing cut off. Dead silence.

And then, the whisper again.

“You forgot. You forgot to say goodnight. You always forget me.”

I felt a hand, cold, spidery fingers brush my cheek. I thrashed, finally able to move, and nearly threw myself onto the floor. My lamp clattered, my phone skittered under the bed.

Empty. The room was empty.

I didn’t sleep again that night.

I tried to rationalize it. I really did. I googled sleep paralysis demons, hallucinations, stress-related hypnagogic phenomena, every possible explanation. I even considered seeing a sleep specialist.

But then it followed me.

At first, I thought maybe I’d imagined it. I was at my mom’s house, helping her with groceries. She went to bed early, and I crashed in the guest room.

2:55 a.m. I woke up. Couldn’t move.

But the voice was already there, waiting.

Goodnight nobody, goodnight mush…

I wanted to scream for my mom, but my mouth wouldn’t open. I stared at the ceiling fan spinning lazily above me, and in one of the blades, I swore I saw a reflection that wasn’t mine.

A face. Pale. Too close. Smiling.

When it whispered this time, I understood something I wish I hadn’t.

“You were mine first. Before her. Before all of them.”

It’s been three weeks now. I don’t sleep much. I can’t. Every time I drift off, I feel the paralysis creeping back, like sinking into wet cement.

And the lullaby always follows.

But lately, the song has… changed.

It doesn’t just repeat the book anymore. Now it improvises.

Goodnight Adam, goodnight dreams…

That’s my name. It knows my name.

Goodnight failures, goodnight screams…

It’s tailoring the lullaby. To me. To my life. To things no one else could know.

Last night, the final verse nearly stopped my heart:

Goodnight mother, asleep down the hall… Goodnight Adam, I’ll take you all…

I woke up with scratches on my arms. Not self-inflicted. Too long. Too sharp.

I don’t know what this thing wants.

Maybe it’s always been with me. Maybe that’s why I hated sleeping alone as a kid, why I begged my mom to keep the nightlight on until I was twelve. Maybe I didn’t outgrow it—I just forgot.

And now it’s reminding me.

I’m writing this because I don’t know how much longer I can fight it. I feel weaker every day, like it’s draining me with every song. Like it’s pulling me closer to something I won’t come back from.

If I disappear..if I stop posting, stop showing up at work, stop answering my mom’s calls, it wasn’t me.

It was the lullaby.

And if you ever wake up frozen, and hear that voice humming from the dark corner of your roo

Don’t listen.

Don’t let it finish the song.

Because once it sings the last line… I think you belong to it forever.
