“How privileged you are.” A voice crept out of the darkness. 

It’s incredible what adrenaline can do to the body. Moreover, it’s incredible how quickly the brain can use that adrenaline. Before I’ve even seen the details in his face, I’m aware this man is a stranger in my home. Someone I was not expecting to be within the walls of my sanctuary. I take a mental note of my physical state. I'm refreshed, but still wet from my shower. Less than a full second has gone by, and my entire body is pulsating, my heart lurches at the walls of my chest, my lungs pick up their pace and my asshole is sewn tighter than grandma’s stitching. 

I turn and face him. The calluses of my bare feet scrape the tile floor. Several years as a child running wildly through tall grass and gravel roads have made my feet near bulletproof. 

“Move no further.” He says. 

His jawline is ever long. As if he were a humanized cartoon. His bleach blonde hair met with striking blue eyes. With such recognizable features, I question why he isn’t masked. 

I’ve already come to terms that the wet towel around my waist will meet the floor below once I move to protect myself. So I will either lose my decency, and beat this guy’s ass while naked, or simply die in the most embarrassing way possible. Oh well, I don’t have much to show off anyway. 

“To open your doors without looking, it’s astonishing. How you just kept your back turned towards its entrance, as if you had nothing to worry about.” It’s true, I hadn’t looked into the hallway after opening the bathroom door, keeping my focus on cleaning my watch with the towel at my hip. But then again, who is expecting this creep to be there waiting for me. 

“I was waiting for you.” Yep, totally makes sense. 

“Who are you?” I whisper. 

“It’s not of any importance, I’m afraid. What is important is what you do next.” The stranger said in his disgustingly thick British accent. 

He waves to me to walk down the hallway. One open hand points down the corridor, his other wafting at me from the wrist. Both of which, much like the rest of his body, are covered by black leather. Gosh, how did I never hear this guy coming?

I take a step toward the hallway, and once again my brain fires off faster than the speed of light. Within this small step I conjured my plan. If this European creep lets me walk across him, he’ll receive an elbow to the jaw. Followed by me working him to the ground. Then when the opportunity presents itself, I’ll sprint towards my phone on the bathroom counter. 

However, if the man walks in front of me and leads me down the hallway - I’ll roll with Plan B. As he escorts me in my own home I’ll quickly gain ground on him. Calmly speed walking and lunge for his knees. That will bring him down and I can use the precious seconds to make it back to my phone. 

I take my second step, inches from the exit of the bathroom. He hasn’t moved, just the flailing of his enormous hand. The man is not much taller than myself, but his extremities give his body a peculiar frame. Long arms, powerful huge hands and broad, bold shoulders to match them. 

I take my third step, breaking the barrier of the bathroom’s threshold. Then the large wafting hand clasps onto the back of my neck. His fingers dig deep into the muscles just underneath the base of my skull. As if I were a child being dragged away from a mess I’d made, the man ushers me down the narrow hallway. I didn’t account for anything physical so early in our introduction but some men just can’t contain themselves. 

He leans closely into my ear. His lips nearly brush against my tragus. “Where is your laptop Kyle?” The spit from his whisper coats my eardrum.

I hesitate, and slow my walk. Surprisingly, he loosens his grip and allows me to turn my head and face him. “My name is not Kyle.” 

We glare at each other for a moment. I leave my mouth agape, breathing lightly. “I’m Jake,” I say “Jake Fitzpatrick.”

The stranger glares longer. His palm then collides with my cheek. Quicker than any pump of adrenaline, he slaps me again. His grasp moves from my nape to my throat. He pushes my head against the wall behind me and leans in close once again. “I will not repeat myself.” 

“I…I’m serious.” I struggle to get out as the heathen presses his hand on my esophagus. He moves upward grabbing ahold of my jaw. I feel his clutch tighten underneath my teeth as he viciously throws me to the floor. Just as I look upward, my head is redirected to the hallway carpet. He swings again, and again, and again. His leather bound fist mimicking a cement block. I feel my face turn warm, and blood drip from my nose. 

The man ceases his beating and stands upward. He looks down on me and holds his gaze. His piercing ocean eyes grow hateful. “I really don’t know man.” I say as bloodied spit leaves my lips in the same sentence. 

He groans and then grabs ahold of my arm. He hoists me halfway up and then tosses me backward into my living room. There goes the towel. 

I’m not sure what chemical my body would have to release next to hinder my astonishment of the stranger’s strength. Somehow, in this horrifying moment, my confusion outweighs my fear. He walks toward me, his boots press softly into my beige carpeting. He crouches in front of me, “Kyle, I know you’re not telling the truth. Quite frankly, I’m not amused. I will begin snapping every bone in your body… Give me the lap-“

Once again, my marvelous brain reacts faster than any lightning bolt could. With zero hesitation, I quickly curl myself in front of the man and eject both legs into his chest, sending him backward. He grunts as I make contact. Within the same movement I leap to my feet. I sprint into my kitchen, which faces open towards the living space. Grabbing the first knife within view, I spin around to face my attacker; who is already back up, moving close, and really, really pissed off. 

As he nears I slash the air in front of him with the serrated steak knife. My family jewels bouncing from thigh to thigh as I attempt my defense efforts. He lowers himself, crouching like an Olympic wrestler. I try to match his height and create distance. We circle each other within the kitchen’s octagon. As we round the countertops I do what any terrified man would do - I grab a second fucking knife. This one however is my large butcher’s knife, its wooden handle still soaked from yesterday’s wash. 

He leaps forward towards my knees. He manages to wrap me and pin me against the lower cabinets. As if I were no weight at all, he lifts me into the air. Just as his momentum begins to shift, and I feel as if he may slam me onto the kitchen counter, I send both knives into his back. The butcher’s knife lands, but makes minimal damage versus the stranger’s leather jacket. The serrated knife, however, finds a sweet spot along the seams, entering his body. 

He grimaces in pain, and lets out a deepened grovel. He then spins and tosses me into the living room like a discarded napkin. I land on the floor, leaving both blades in his back. He falls over, clenching his fists on the ground. Both objects protrude from his back like a bug’s wings preparing for take off. He again slams his fist onto the kitchen’s linoleum. He curses, whimpers, and begins to sweat profusely. 

He spreads his fingers across the floor, and lets out a hideous scream. His hands then burst through his gloves, revealing black fingernails, and horribly hairy knuckles. 

I push my back against the wall, and then gather myself to my feet. The intruder begins to appear to change in mass, but I’m not exactly sure what I’m watching. He cries again as he vomits on the floor. 

He howls, as if he’s never experienced pain like this. Hell, I’ve never experienced whatever is going on. 

He vomits again, spewing food remains and white foam on the kitchen floor. He jerks his head upward. He looks in my general direction, but doesn’t make eye contact with me. His crystal blue eyes begin to weep and his skin blushes and swells around them. He strains his neck, revealing massive veins. 

He cries out again, this time it sounds more like a man. He looks downward, then back up and finally our eyes meet. He’s fucking pissed.

I’m so confined in his invidious gaze, I barely notice his teeth have grown. They’re massive now, actually. Canines point out from his lips and weave through other jagged teeth that now fill his mouth. “What the fuck is happening?” I whisper. 

He hastily pans the room. I try to track where his eyes go but I’m unsure what he’s looking for. His leather outfit tightens around him and begins to pull away at its seams. His skin darkens and fine hairs sprout from his face. He faces me again, this time the side of his jaw pointed towards the ceiling, like how foxes do when they’re curious. 

All at once, as if he finally gave in, his body accelerates into a huge stature. His nails lunge from his fingertips and peel the flooring underneath. His jacket bursts open on his back, and although it faces away from me, I can see long dark hairs spread down his spine. His face pushes forward and he smacks his jaw together as he coughs. His nose stays in place against his face as his cheekbones rise forward. 

He stands up. 

As he rises the butcher’s knife falls from behind him and clatters on the floor. The steak knife still protrudes from his back, hanging on like a loose tooth. He snarls at me, his monstrous teeth move around another set behind them. As if the razor sharp canines were curtains for his human molars. 

I feel myself start to pass out. This has gotten terrifyingly out of hand. 

Like a hail mary throw, my brain sparks its magic once more; I remember what I was doing just before showering. I look to my right and on the coffee table is my laptop. It was gifted to me at my first college, it's a cheap Lenovo, it can totally go. 

Without any hesitation I move towards the table and seize it. I startle the beast, and he moves forward, but halts himself when he comprehends what's in my hand. He’s so much larger than he was seconds ago.

Our eyes meet. I have no idea what this thing in my living room is anymore and I’m praying this gets it out of my sight. I sprint towards the sliding glass door behind me. It leads me out to a wooden deck and I launch the laptop into the parking lot below. Just as soon as it leaves my hand, the hulking figure bursts through the opening and snags the device before it meets the ground. 

His feet slam onto the concrete. Without missing a step he speeds off to the forest in front of him on all fours, carrying the laptop in his mouth (mouths?). His nails click-clack against the pavement until he disappears behind the trees. His body is as dark as the shadows he’s now surrounded by. 

I look downward to find my downstairs neighbor, Cortland, staring at the woods and then back up at me. “You really need to find some nicer girls, champ.”
