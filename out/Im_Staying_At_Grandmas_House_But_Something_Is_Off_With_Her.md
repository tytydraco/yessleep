Grandma lived with her Birman cat, Pedro, as her only source of social interaction. Grandpa had gone to fight in World War Two and never returned. Grandma never spoke about him. We didn't even know if she remembered he ever existed and that she was ever married to him. She had no photos of him, she slept in a single bed and if you spoke with her you would assume she had been single her entire life.

I opened the front door of Grandma's house and placed my suitcase at the foot of the stairs. I was welcomed by the meows of Pedro. I had brought a small gift bag with me which held a cat toy. I knew how much Grandma loved Pedro so the toy served as an indirect present to her as well as the cat. I took the toy out of the bag and Pedro immediately began rubbing his head against my legs as a sign of gratitude. I bent over to give him the toy and gently pushed him away. He scampered straight back to me continuing his thank you ritual which was more annoying than it was gracious.

I heard Grandma's voice from the kitchen.

"OP is that you? You are just in time. I'm just in the kitchen making dinner. You wouldn't be a dear and help me set the table, would you?"

I walked into the dimly lit kitchen and saw Grandma bending down by the oven wearing an apron. She didn't turn to face me although I could see a faint reflection in the oven glass as I approached her. The lighting wasn't enough to paint a clear picture but she seemed to have an angry expression on her face. As if whatever she was cooking wasn't abiding to the laws of the recipe book on the countertop.

She lifted herself from the squatting positing and turned to face me. She had grown a lot since I'd last seen her. That isn't necessarily something I thought I would ever really about my grandmother but she was towering four inches over me at least. I looked towards her face and saw her grinning down at me.

"Oh, I'm so glad you came! How was the journey? Did Pedro give you a warm welcome? Come here and give give your grandmother a hug."

She wrapped her arms around me and leant in to give me a kiss on the cheek. Her lips had always felt like dried up sandpaper and eight months later since we had last met, they felt no different.

She handed me some cutlery and asked if I would help her set the table as dinner was ready to be served. I grabbed two plates from the cabinet and walked into the lounge. Grandma was a simple lady. Her lounge hosted a wooden bookshelf, small table with two chairs tucked beneath it, a cat house for Pedro and a small TV which faced a yellow rocking chair. I could tell by the wear of the yellow paint that this is where Grandma spent most of her time presumably watching TV or reading.

I lowered the plates onto the the mats which were neatly placed on the table. I placed a fork, a knife and a spoon down in a pile on the right hand side of each plate and returned to the kitchen to help Grandma with the rest of the preparation.

As I walked back to the kitchen, I heard a clatter coming from the lounge. I rushed back to find Pedro meowing proudly. He had knocked most of the contents of the table onto the floor and was nonchalantly parading around the lounge. I collected the fallen cutlery into my hands and took them back to the kitchen to rinse off.

I walked into the kitchen but Grandma was nowhere to be seen. The oven light was off and the oven mitts had been removed from the handle so I assumed she had started loading the food onto the table. I must have missed her on the way back to the kitchen. I washed and dried the cutlery and walked back to the lounge.

Grandma was sitting on her rocking chair and the glow of the TV rested on her face. The table was set and Grandma had already fixed herself a plate and was eating it, whilst she was consumed by whatever she was watching.

"I apologise OP. I completely lost track of time and didn't realise that my favourite show was starting. I hope you don't mind if I eat over here. I don't mean to be rude." As she spoke, the food in her mouth decided to take flight and land at her feet.

The TV faced away from the rest of the room which made it impossible for me to see what she watching but it was clearly more interesting than me. I sat down at the table and served myself a small portion of food. I didn't know exactly what it was and at this point I didn't care to ask but it smelled pretty good. I guess it was some sort of meat and vegetable casserole.

I looked over to Grandma as she was fixed to the TV, shovelling the casserole into her mouth. Once the plate was empty, she lifted it up to her face and began to lick it clean. The whole experience was bewildering. Grandma was always extremely polite and respectful, especially in the presence of me and I was now watching her attacking her plate like a ravenous dog. As the plate covered her face, I noticed that the base of it was slightly reflective. I squinted my eyes and noticed what was being displayed on the TV. It was static.

My heart dropped. Was this her favourite show? I looked down at my plate which still held untouched casserole and suddenly no longer had an appetite. I had also noticed that my fork was missing so I used that as enough of a reason to not eat. I must have forgotten to bring it back from the kitchen after it had dropped.

Pedro was pawing at the cat toy I had brought for him and I noticed that it was all chewed up and resembled a bundle of frayed rope more than it did a toy. Grandma was still watching TV. She hadn't made a sound in a while and I didn't want to disturb her so I pulled my phone from my trouser pocket and began scrolling mindlessly through my home screen in search for some mental stimulation.

I peered over to Grandma, who was still invested in her show, eyes ablaze with fascination. I looked back down at my phone and opened up the settings app and began exploring the plethora of adjustments I could make to my screen. Then, I felt a tap on my shoulder.

My head shot up and Grandmas' rocking chair was vacant.

I turned slowly and Grandma was perched just above my right shoulder looking at my phone screen.

"You children nowadays don't know anything about social interaction. I haven't seen you for so long, my dear. How about we play a game? Do you know any good games we can play?"

She pulled out the chair opposite me and began tapping her fingers on the table awaiting a response.

"There is a game I play with my friends called 'Would you Rather?" I awaited acknowledgement.

She gave me a welcoming nod.

I went on to thoroughly explain the rules of the game to her.

As the look of confusion on her face turned to eagerness, she asked if she could start first.

"Would you rather eat an apple or a banana?"

I looked at her blankly. I had just spent the better part of ten minutes explaining the game and this is the best she could come up with.

I replied back discontented, "An apple."

"Correct! Ding, Ding, Ding. That is one point for you." Her eyes gleamed.

"No Grandma, there are no correct answers. We have to discuss which of the options we would each choose and the reason why. Also, the questions need to be a little more thought provoking. Let me give you one."

She looked down coyly at the table.

"Would you rather get ten thousand dollars right now or get twenty dollars every time you use the toilet for the rest of your life?" That was the best question I could come up with at the time.

"Money has no value to me so I would choose neither."

I looked at her blankly.

This verbal tug of war continued until she was finally starting to get the hang of the game. We had now asked each other a handful of questions but things started to get very strange when we moved onto negative scenarios.

It was my turn to ask the next question but she jumped in during my thought process.

"Actually, I have a great one. Would you rather die by being suffocated by a pillow in your sleep or would you rather die from multiple fork stab wounds in your neck?"

I looked at her waiting for a laugh to confirm that this was a joke but she stared at me solemnly with a strange glimmer in her eyes.

"Remember the rules. You must answer every question."

I let out a fake yawn and outstretched my arms before looking up at the clock.

"I'm starting to feel a little tired. Perhaps I should go to sleep."

She reluctantly lifted herself from her chair and guided me up to the guest bedroom where I would be spending the night.

It is hard to describe the overwhelming dread I was feeling. The atmosphere in the house felt very unsafe and I was feeling uneasy at the thought of spending the night here. I don't know what happened to Grandma. I don't know if this even is Grandma but I want to leave.

Eventually, tiredness crept up on me as my fear slowly dissipated and I fell asleep.

I was awoken by the sound of scratching at the door and exasperating meows. Pedro had been getting on my nerves the entire day and now he was doing the same at nightfall.

I lay still in bed hoping that he would eventually get bored but the meows grew louder and the scratching became more desperate.

Maybe he was hurt. I rubbed my eyes, flicked the bedside lamp on, placed my feet on the wooden floor and began walking towards the door.

As I reached for the door handle, I heard a gasp. I was no expert in the feline species but I knew for sure that cats didn't gasp and if they did, their gasps didn't sound identical to that of a human's gasp.

I opened up the door looking down to where Pedro would be. It was pitch black out there but my eyes could just barely pull together an image of fluffy pink slippers. It was Grandma.

I took a step backwards to create a gap between us. She took a step forward to close the gap and she was now standing in the bedroom. The lighting from the lamp illuminated her silhouette and I could make out that she was clutching a pillow in both hands.

"Oh darling, I just wanted to check that you didn't want an extra pillow. Grandpa would always complain that our pillows were too thin to get a good rest. I didn't wake you did I?"

Her beady eyes stared at me awaiting a response.

"Thank you Grandma."

I reached out and disarmed her of the pillow.

"No, you didn't wake me. I just heard distressed meows and thought Pedro was hurt." I replied back.

Her wrinkled hands covered her pencil-thin lips and she let out a childish giggle.

"Your mind can play all sorts of tricks on you when you are tired. Get some rest and I will have you downstairs for breakfast in the morning."

I thought that was a strange way of phrasing that sentence.

She left and closed the door behind her.

Eventually, a much welcome wave of tiredness swept over me and I was back into a deep slumber.
