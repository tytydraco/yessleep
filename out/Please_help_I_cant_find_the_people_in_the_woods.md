I'm really hoping that somebody can help me, because I'm at the end of my rope here.

Here's my story.

A few weeks ago, I went out drinking with some friends. The night was going good, we were bar hopping, stopping at different bars downtown and dancing and drinking and then moving on to the next. But, around 2 am, we started to get tired.

We were going to my friend, Manuel's, house since his apartment was closest and were planning to crash on his floor. I don't remember who suggested it, but we decided to cut through Greenbelt Park. Probably not our brightest idea, but in our defense we were pretty trashed and in the end it turned out to be an amazing choice.

So we're cutting through the woods and we're all sort of holding onto each other and talking and being loud when we see this light through the trees. Remember it's like 2 am. Technically the park isn't even open after sunset, so there shouldn't be anyone there except for drunks like us.

My buddies want to check it out, but I'm sort of concerned. Like what if we walk into a drug deal or something and get shot? But they were already heading toward the light and I wasn't about to be left in the middle of the park by myself, so I followed.

Once we got closer, we could hear music. I don't know how to describe it. It was like weird Renaissance music with lutes and harps and stuff, but with this crazy drum line pounding underneath it. I could feel it in my chest before we even stepped through the trees.

It didn't take long for us to follow the light and music to the clearing where there was the craziest party I had ever seen taking place. It was wild!

Everyone was gorgeous, like 10/10 runway model hot! They were all tall and willowy and dressed in crazy clothes. Some of the women looked like they had just stepped off the set of Lord of the Rings, but then some of the others looked like they just came from Tokyo, all street fashion and chunky sneakers and punk jackets and heavy eyeliner. And they were all drinking this golden liquor that smelled like honey while they talked and sang and danced.

At first we all just stood there staring like? This had to be some kind of crazy underground rave or something right? And we just stumbled into it? What were the chances of that?

I know we must have been standing there with our jaws on the ground for a while before this nice girl, Giselle, came over to talk to us.

"Are you lost?" she asked and laughed this crazy laugh that sounded like bells. She had this weird accent too. I'm usually pretty good with accents, but I couldn't pin down where she was from at all.

Guys, the night we had in the park had to be the best night of my life. We danced and drank and ate some of the most delicious food I've ever tasted in my life. Everyone there acted like we were the most interesting people in the world, even though I know for a fact we are not that interesting.

The whole thing sort of blurs together in my mind, but I know we must have been there for hours. Definitely long enough for the sun to come up, but it never did. It felt like the party went on for forever, like a high that never faded.

At some point Giselle came over to me and said, "You better get home, if you want to go home at all."

I didn't and still don't understand what she meant. But the last thing I wanted to do was give these new friends of mine the impression that I was the kind of guy to overstay my welcome. And besides I had assumed we would always be welcomed back.

God I wish I knew then what I know now. I never would have left.

So, I gathered up my buds and we stumbled back through the trees. We laughed and talked and sang and danced all the way back to Manuel's house where we collapsed anywhere there was a clean bit of floor and slept past noon the next day.

The following night, we all went back to the park. We wanted to see our friends again, listen to their crazy music, eat their delicious food and drink their honey flavored liquor. But the park was dark and quiet. We couldn't even find the clearing we had spent so long in the night before.

"We can always try next weekend," Manuel had said, at the time.

But I wasn't sure I could make it until next week. I had already started to forget the songs, the words felt wrong in my mouth even as I hummed them over and over to try and get them to stick in my head.

You can probably guess what happened next. The party wasn't in the park the next weekend either or the weekend after that. I've started going through the park every night looking for it, even though I don't live anywhere close to downtown.

I can't sleep without dreaming about it. My days feel washed out and empty. I just count the hours until I can go back to the park and look for my lost friends and their beautiful faces.

My pals aren't doing well either. When we meet up we all look like shit, with dark bags under eyes and our clothes are starting to hang off us. Normal food tastes like dirt compared to the food we ate that night.

I need to find my way back to them. Someone has to know who they are and where they meet up! Please, I swear that we had a connection that night! They're probably as desperate to see me as I am to see them.

If anyone knows how I can find them or how to put me in touch, please let me know. I'm desperate.
