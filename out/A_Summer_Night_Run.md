It is the Summer of 2022, and I cannot escape the heat. The heat that is the crowded, cloying musk of Kilkenny city on a sweaty Saturday night. It grimes against my mind like the late June humidity on my skin.  
  
I had been robbed of what felt like half the Summer, having suffered a bad case of Achilles tendinosis, and had spent most of May and June endlessly stretching and pacing like a caged cat in a bid to nurse it back to functionality.  
  
And so it was with the backdrop of weekend banter wafting from the city that I felt like running once again, at long last. Running away from the city, away from the noise, the grime, the shouting and the decadence, and into the sweet dark embrace of the city limits.  
  
A cheap car driven by fools drunk on even cheaper beer belches past as I near the entrance to the canal, shouting incoherently at me. Leaving civilisation behind was perhaps the only thing I would have in common with them that night.  
  
I turn left and run into the darkness, feeling the air already grow cooler. Were any to cast their gaze down that dark lane, all anyone would see would be the outline of my grey vest vanish into the dark.  
  
The ambient moisture of the river Nore cools the sweat on my collar as I run through the dark of the canal at a steady pace. There was no need to rush. The damp scent of earthen banks and dried muck permeates the air. My skin tickles with rivulets of sweat and stray midges as I glide through the black to the rhythm of my own breath.  
  
My eyes are slow to adjust, and for moments here and there, the dark is so dense that I almost feel as if I would collide with it. Nothing solid ever comes, only the swish of the night-cool breeze colliding with my own breath.  
  
The belly of clouds above me, lit dull orange by the glow of streetlights, gives way to darker clouds as I move away from the city limits. My pace is briefly interrupted as I vault a rusted gate that marks the beginning of the countryside; countryside that knew nothing of clubs or cars or noise.  
  
The only noise here was that of the birds, of rushing water and falling twigs, and an ecstatic silence that was present long before man had noises of his own to make.  
  
Onward I run along a narrow grassy path by the riverbank, split in the middle by damp muck, slowing my pace as my eyes adjust to even deeper darkness. I lose myself to the pace, focusing on the dips in elevation, patches of muck wet with three-day old summer showers, and a stray rock here and there.  
  
The path opens up to a wide field, lined with trees which separate the field from a nearby woods to my right. To my left is another line of trees going all along the riverbank, separated in the middle by a clearing by the bank and a lone tree often used for picnics; my first stop.  
  
I slow to a walk as I near the tree, and feel myself stop abruptly.  
  
My already hammering heart leaps into my throat at what I see there.  
  
Picked out in the monochrome static of my burgeoning night-sight, I see a rope swaying gently in the night breeze. Suspended from the rope by the neck is the still body of a man, the black outline of limbs and torso unmistakeable. I am no stranger to death thanks to my line of work at the time, and so I approach him, thinking that if there is at all time to save them, I would have to take it. No one else could; I am the only one there. I had left my phone at home in my pursuit of solitude, and so emergency services could not be reached either unless I turned back, and by then it would be far too late. If it wasn’t already.  
  
How I would even cut him down, I did not know.  
  
My worries are swiftly blown away with the river-cooled breeze; the sound of rustling plastic draws a relieved chuckle from me. Through rotten chance, the rope is just a rope swing, used by teenagers to swing into the river on hot summer days. The “body” as it happens, is a black plastic rubbish sack skewered onto nearby branches for ease of access. Whatever way the silhouettes had lined up as I approached had made the scene look like that of a suicide.  
  
Shaking my head at my own foolishness I run on, the adrenaline putting a spring in my step for the rest of my run.  
  
I cross a small, rusted beam of metal over an old, dried stream that serves as a bridge into the next field.  
  
This field is used as a training ground for the nearby equestrian centre, but I expected to have the field to myself at that late hour.  
  
As I ran, I begin to feel unease, as if I was not supposed to be there. I knew the field to be open to walkers by day, but part of me worried if that was not the case at night. Surely they would have a gate or some way of keeping people out at night if that were the case?  
  
I begin to dismiss the thoughts - clearly my run-in with the hanged bag had shaken me more than I realised.  
  
As I cast my eyes towards the blackness of the treeline at the edge of the field, my heart leaps again. The pale form of a horse in the darkness looking at me. It began to walk slowly, cautious but curious of me, likely not used to seeing people during night.  
  
A thought comes to me unbidden; It’s not a horse.  
  
So sudden was the thought that I furrow my brow in confusion, openly scoffing at the absurdity of it.  
  
The horse drew closer so that I hear its hooves on the muckier patches of the ground. That voice of instinct speaks to me again, more urgent now: It’s not a horse.  
  
I find myself analysing its every movement - the sway of its head, too lethargic to be anything but a puppet barely held up like a mask of something that a malign intellect thought was equine.  
  
The way its legs move, too smooth and too slow in an arachnid padding gait, without the gentle flick of the hoof at the end of its step; as if it were the one trying not to startle me away.  
  
I strain to look into its eyes as it drew nearer, black pits carved into a sheet of skin obscuring something in a predatory masquerade. All wrong.  
  
Instinct screams at me to run, not to allow this thing to do what it intends to once it gets close enough to me; a naive human who ran where people were not meant to run on dark and heady summer nights such as this.  
  
Instinct practically screams at me now: IT’S NOT A HORSE IT’S NOT-  
  
A horse. And nothing more. It politely stands beside me, and I stroke its jaw. It sniffs my hand with innocent curiosity, and I tell it off playfully for the scare it gave me.  
  
‘Things must seem a lot less scary through your eyes hmm? You probably saw me coming clear as day.’  
  
I leave it with a parting pat and exit the field at a walking pace so as not to startle it.  
  
As I resume my run, my path back brings me near to a small treeline in front of a stream. My senses on guard, I hear noises in quick succession. A twig falling, a branch being swept aside, and a splash of water. A fox? A Badger? Too big, I think. Too big to be making noise like that. So what was it?  
  
I am filled with a sense of dread that is seldom felt within the comfortable bounds of modern civilisation. Ever-surrounded by light, safety and plenty, without any doubt that the cliché bumps in the night are simply those of people, human kindred surrounding us in a blanket of tribal comfort.  
  
In rare cases, in dark back alleys or inscrutable stretches of rural night, one may feel an overwhelming sense that if they were to take another two or three steps into the dark, that they would be met with malice so deep and untold that nothing might be left of them come morning’s light.  
  
I feel that dread now, and, an inexplicable desire to step towards it.  
  
My reason for doing so was, in hindsight, quite foolish. I wished to go home with a story. I wished to be able to say that I had stepped towards that nameless dread that I’d wager everyone has felt at least once in their life, to tell of what I would or would not find in those shadows. Perhaps it was the runner’s high and the adrenaline. Perhaps I’d been cooped up too long.  
  
I push myself to take a step towards that dark streamside ditch.  
  
I manage only one.  
  
From a nearby ditch, a pale form makes itself known to me. It stands up as if rising from a crouch, a sinuous thing of spindly pale limbs and a bulbous head, pocked with tiny black eyes too numerous to count. My breath stops dead as my mind processes what it is seeing. It begins to sway in an uncanny mockery of a friendly wave, and I ready myself, entirely unsure of what this thing intends to do to me.  
  
And suddenly, the artifice drops as my eye’s cruel joke comes to an end. My would-be sinuous assailant was nothing more than some growths of ground elder weed, their white flowers and long stems lining up perfectly in a mockery of the human form, distorted by the night and my own imagination.  
  
The adrenaline from the night’s consecutive scares sends me swiftly home, scoffing between breaths at my own foolishness.  
  
But was it really foolishness? Was it foolish to listen keenly to the silence between heartbeats, to the sounds of things unseen that move through the ditches and thickets outside of the lights of our cities? Would I be foolish to listen keenly that way now as I run home, to glance myopically into the blackness behind with my feeble human eyes? To run just a little bit faster as imaginary jaws nipped at my heels and gnashed at the chilled sweat along my back?  
  
As I make it back to the sanctuary of streetlight, I catch my breath, drinking in the still night air and listening to the reassuring buzz of the streetlight above me. I gaze into the dark once more, now that my mind and heart are at ease.  
  
That same dread wafts from it, borne on the river air. That same certainty that were I to step back into it, that terrible, nameless things would happen to me.  
  
Some strangers walk past me on a leisurely night outing of their own. Their boisterous speech and smell of drink reminds me of the men who had driven past me earlier in the night. They now felt like my closest kin compared to whatever lay in the dark behind me.  
  
They mean to walk down the dark canal that I had come from, but they pause, and turn to take the right-hand path towards town instead.  
  
Even in their drunken stupor, they feel it too.  
  
I gaze once more into the black before I retreat to the sanctuary of my home.  
  
Not foolish, I thought, with more certainty than ever before. Not at all.
