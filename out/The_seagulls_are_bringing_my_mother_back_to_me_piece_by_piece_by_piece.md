The first morning, it was a dull gray tooth, speckled with sand and smelling strongly of brine, deposited on my bedroom windowsill like a gift. I didn’t understand how it was on the *inside* of my home, given that the window had been closed and locked all night.

I tried not to think about it.

The next morning? It was a damp white clot the size of a golf-ball, with a cloudy pupil and an iris the color of moss, a lush and familiar green-brown. 

Woke up earlier that morning, before sunrise. I could still hear them - the flock. Cawing on my front lawn. Tapping along the shingles. Skittering somewhere inside my house, though it was hard to say *where* exactly. Sounded like they were in the walls, but the space was only a few inches thick. They couldn’t fit. Lying in bed, desperately pretending to be asleep, I theorized they must be in the vents, then; it’s the only hollow space they could fit in.

Some quiet part of myself knew that theory was wrong, though.

They were inside the walls.

Even if they shouldn’t be able to fit.

The third night, it was a finger, swollen with sea-rot and inflexibly straight, as if pointing, the digit severed mid-accusation. They left it for me to find on the windowsill, same with the eye, same with the tooth. At that point, I could deny the truth no longer.

There was a wedding ring tightly fixed on the finger, and I recognized the jewelry.

They were bringing her back to me.

\- - - - - 

I threw those profane totems in the trash, slamming the steel lid shut like they were liable to jump out after me. Within the hour, I had my real estate agent on the phone. He kept asking me questions, but I couldn’t make out what he was saying. High-pitched static plagued our connection. My end of it, at least. He claimed he could hear me just fine.

Out of the blue, inexplicably, I had an idea.

*“Could you hold on a second?”*

I set the phone down, paced across the kitchen, opened the trashcan, and submerged the water-logged flesh under a thick layer of unused coffee grounds; a makeshift burial for a few fractions of my long-lost mother.

When I got back on the line, the connection was crystal clear.

*“Yup, I can hear you now. Bad coverage, I guess.”*

I walked into the backyard, closing the screen door behind me. The gulls hadn’t delivered an ear yet, but I didn’t think that precluded the flesh from hearing me.

*“Tim, I need you to get me the fuck out of this house,”* I whispered.

Wild fear thrummed at the base of my skull. My mind raced, imagining all the possibilities.

The sun was setting.

I wondered what the flock was going to bring me tonight.

\- - - - - 

Before the week was up, I’d moved to the opposite end of the city. Not sure why I believed that’d make a damn bit of difference, but I couldn’t do *nothing*.

Without skipping a beat, they started from the beginning.

The first night, it was a tooth.

The next, an eye, and then, a pointing finger with a wedding ring.

There was only one difference.

Each piece was lightly dusted with unused coffee grounds.

So I moved again. Didn’t even bother unpacking. Clearly, I hadn’t traveled far enough. I needed to migrate further from the sea, further inland. That’s where I’d be safe.

When I arrived at my next home, two states over, I felt a glimmer of hope in my chest. Nothing changed, though.

The first night, it was a tooth.

What’s worse, the flock seemed to be getting angry with my futile relocations. I don’t think I slept that first night, and yet, when I examined myself in the bathroom mirror the following morning, I found my skin newly covered in cuts and bruises. Nips and pecks up both forearms, across my chest, down my back - everywhere - and I didn’t feel any pain until I laid my eyes on the wounds. Standing in front of my reflection, mouth gaping, color draining from my face, agony rushed across my body like a tidal wave, the sensation of a hundred beaks pulling and prodding at my skin until it burst.

The second night, I attempted to catch them in the act.

When I heard them cawing on the front lawn, I leapt out of bed and sprinted to the window, pulling the blinds up with such force that the drawstring broke.

Didn’t see a single gull outside, but I heard a bevy of gentle wingbeats overhead. They moved before I could get a look. Maddened by exhaustion, I bolted out of the bedroom, to the windows on the opposite side of the house. I was dead-set on at least *seeing* them.

As I tumbled through the hallway, panting, tripping over myself, there was the soft, muffled clicking of talons meeting wood beside me.

They were in the walls.

With a grin and an uncontrolled fit of laughter, I ran downstairs and pulled a hammer from a half-empty moving box. I stood still. Steadied my breathing and perked my ears. Another few muffled clicks emanated from somewhere behind me.

I swung around and sent the hammer’s claw crashing into the plaster. When I wrenched it out, I saw a glimpse of something in the small, splintered hole.

Pulpy, white, feathered meat, squishing through the crawlspace at an unnatural speed.

Something about the sight extinguished my frenzy.

I released my grip. The hammer clattered to the floor. I collapsed shortly thereafter.

Cautiously, tears welling under my bloodshot eyes, I plodded towards the hole. Once I was close enough, I placed two trembling lips to the orifice.

*“Hey…M-Mom…M-Mom…I’m…I’m sorry,”* I muttered, pleading, groveling.

*“No more deal…no more deal…”*

I repeated that phrase over, and over, and over, and over again, until sleep finally took me.

Some time later, bright light gleamed against my closed eyes, body cradled tightly in the fetal position, head resting on the floor.

My eyelids creaked open. My vision focused.

A single cloudy pupil stared back at me.

Want to know the worst part?

I don’t even remember *what* we argued about, all those years ago.

I mean, I was eight, for Christ’s sake.

We were at the beach, just her and me. I don’t remember the car ride. I don’t recall walking along the boardwalk or setting up our umbrella in the sand.

I just remember anger. Vicious, seething, white-hot anger.

I sat on our towel, stewing, rage marinating in its own venomous juices. She was ignoring me, reading a book, sipping dark liquor from a silver flask. Or maybe she was trying to start a conversation; maybe I was the one ignoring her. Maybe the flask is a detail I added after the fact, something to make me feel better about my part in her disappearance. It’s all so hazy.

At some point, she stood. Went to the bathroom, I think.

While she was gone, something began creeping towards me from across the beach.

Superficially, it *looked* like a gull - beady eyes with gray wings and a down-turned beak - but there was something fundamentally wrong with it. I could see chaotic clusters of tangled blood vessels throbbing beneath its chest. Its breathing was hoarse, labored, and deep. It walked on a pair of six-toed feet, most of which were talons, but some of them were more akin to elongated, human-like toes.

No one seemed bothered by its presence. Kids ran by it without blinking. Adults talked and laughed and threw frisbees around it, completely indifferent to the creature.

Eventually, it was right in front of our umbrella, unblinking eyes locked on mine, and I sort of just…knew.

This thing was offering me something. 

A deal. 

And I was still so, so angry.

I wanted Mom gone. 

Vanished. Extinct.

I wished her *dead*.

The gull’s beak rasped open. A wet, pink tongue unfurled from inside its mouth, unraveling like a fire hose that’d been coiled into a taut spiral. The glistening appendage twirled towards me until it landed at my feet.

It wanted something in return.

It desired tribute.

Something to seal the deal.

I didn’t have much of myself to give, but before too long, I had an idea.

I reached into my mouth and pinched one of my upper canines. It was a baby tooth. A part of myself that was due to fall from me any day now. I twisted and yanked on the canine until its thready connections broke. Without hesitation, I laid the chunk of bloodstained enamel onto the tongue. Like the crack of a whip, the salivating tendril and its prize receded, flying back into the hungry blackness of its maw. The sound of it chewing on my tooth, grounding it into a fine dust, was unbearable. 

Suddenly, movement in my peripheral vision pulled my attention away from the gull.

It was Mom.

She was walking towards the ocean, arms fully extended at her shoulders, her body a cross. Her steps were languid, but deliberate. Like the gull, nobody seemed bothered by her odd spectacle. Even when her legs carried her into the ocean, even when her head disappeared below the tide, no one cared.

I cared. I think I cared.

Or maybe I smiled.

Like I said, my memories are hazy.

This was all so long ago.

\- - - - - 

Fearing the damage that might be done if I don’t stay put, I haven’t moved a fourth time.

Over the last few months, they’ve returned most of her to me. Unsure of what else to do, I've decided to give Mom a true burial. 

Her piecemeal body looms below the dirt in my backyard.

As I type this, I can hear her through my closed bedroom window.

She isn’t speaking, per se.

The sound is higher. Shrill, guttural, dripping with spite and confusion.

A caw of sorts. 

Mom wants me to know that she feels like I did that day.

So, so angry.

And once she’s finally complete, I think she’ll find me.

She’ll rise from the earth, trudging through the house in the dead of night. 

From the false safety of my bed, I’ll hear her lumber up the stairs, down the hall, and into my room, with a question burning on the tip of her festering tongue.

Mom will want to know why I did that to her, why I agreed to its deal.

I think she’ll be curious about why I was so, so angry as well. 

And when she realizes I don’t have anything to tell her, when she truly understands that I don’t have an explanation to give,

I think I’ll be in really, really [big trouble.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)
