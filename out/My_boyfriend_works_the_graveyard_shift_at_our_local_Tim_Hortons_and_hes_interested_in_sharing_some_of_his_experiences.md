My boyfriend and best friend, Emmett, works the graveyard shift at a 24-hour Tim Hortons in our small town (which, for obvious privacy reasons, I won’t be naming). Every weekday, he goes in at 9 in the evening and gets off at 4 in the morning. He shares his shift with 2 others: Ella and August (aliases for, again, obvious privacy reasons). And he loves telling me all about the weird shit he experiences there. So, one night, I had an idea.

"How would you feel about sharing your spooky stories with the Internet?" I ask.

Emmett raises a brow. "Where? YourGhostStories.com? Does that place even still exist?"

"Oh, God, I forgot about that place," I say, laughing. "I wrote fake stories there as a kid. People actually believed them, too. A few even accused me of being evil or something 'cause I had the word "devilish" in my username."

Emmett chuckles and shakes his head. "Troglodytes."

I grin and lean against his shoulder. "Reddit. There's a page dedicated to creepy stories."

"Reddit. Mhmm." Emmett puts an arm around me, pulling me closer. "Not a website with a stellar reputation, Isla."

"So?" I look up at him. After 9 years of being together, he still gives me butterflies.

He returns my gaze, and a tiny frown appears on his face. "I don't want people making light of this stuff. I already know *you* don't believe it."

I shake my head. "I *do* believe it! I just don't think it's fuckin' ghosts, Emmett. There's always—"

"—a rational explanation, as you love to say," Emmett finishes. "Sugar, you don't work there. It's not really your place to pass judgment."

"All right," I say, standing up. "I'm not going to argue with you about this. I love you, and I love it when you tell me about your Timmie's specter. And I want to share him with other people. Why's it matter if they "make light" of him? That doesn't change your lived experiences."

Emmett sits there for a little while, bouncing his knee. That's something we both do when either we're waiting or we're thinking. So I give him time. I tell him I'm making us hot chocolate, then head down to the kitchen, praying we still have some giant marshmallows left.

So, listen. I believe Emmett. I mean, I believe that he's seeing and hearing genuinely odd shit at that Tim Hortons. I just... I don't think it's a *ghost*. I truly don't. I think that, maybe, Emmett is hearing some ghost stories from one of his co-workers, and then getting spooked when they decide to fuck with him, or a breeze from the drive-through window blows a cardboard cup off the counter, or the pipes or toilet or whatever make a weird noise. It's an older building, been around for decades. Older buildings always make weird noises.

Still, I feel like a bit of an ass when I let some teasing slip through. What can I say? I'm a skeptic. Emmett used to be, too. I loved that about him. I love rational, level-headed people. Don’t get me wrong, he's still rational and level-headed, just... well, now there's this, too. Looming over us. Thinking about it too hard kind of makes me sad. Dunno why. 

Hopefully, hot chocolate with giant marshmallows soothes my melancholy. 

It usually does.

After finishing our drinks, I head back upstairs and return to our bedroom to see Emmett lighting up the fireplace.

He turns to look at me. "Setting the mood."

"Oh? Are we... engaging in sexual intercourse?"

Emmett laughs and shakes his head. "Such a romantic. But no. Later. Right now, we’re gonna get spooky."

My heart skips a beat. "We're sharing your stories?"

"Mhmm."

I place Emmett's drink down next to him, then take a seat on the bed and boot up my laptop. "I'll type as you talk."

"Sounds good. This'll be word for word. Don't change anything. Got it?"

"Understood, cap'n."

Emmett gets to his feet, approaches the bed, and gives me a *look*. "Move over, sugar."

I smile and scoot to the side a bit.

He takes a big sip from his mug, then places it gingerly on his nightstand and sits down next to me. There’s a look on his face that's just one note away from neutral, but I can’t seem to figure out what it is.

I study him as my laptop signs me in. "You really sure about this?"

He raises a brow. "Are you having second thoughts?"

I laugh. "No, but you are."

He sighs and shrugs. "We'll see how it goes. What kind of response we get."

I nod. "If you don't like it, we never have to do it again."

As my laptop finishes booting up, I pluck a giant marshmallow out of my hot chocolate and let it melt in my mouth. *Marshmallows really do make everything better*. Finally, my desktop greets me: A photo of our cream-colored kitty, Jujube, staring out of the window on a snowy evening. He'll be turning 2 in May. I love the shit out of him.

Emmett is watching me, his hands wrapped around his mug. "You typing this in WordPad?"

"Yep," I reply, double-clicking the icon. I wince as the blank white screen blinds me.

Emmett smirks. "Are you ready?"

"Uh-huh," I reply, my hands hovering over the keyboard. "Just... whatever incident comes to mind. Take your time, lover."

He nods, staring at nothing in particular. And then he begins.

**EMMETT:** First one that comes to mind wasn't too long ago, actually. It was near the end of January, on day 3 or 4 of that fucking insane blizzard. Power never went out because we'd already turned the generators on.

**ME:** Canadians know.

**EMMETT:** Yep. We hadn't had a customer in over an hour, I'm assuming because of the storm. And, you know, it being about 2 AM. Ella and I are sitting at a table, just chatting. She's telling me about... MBTI? I think that's what it's called. Kind of interesting, I guess. Well, not really, but she can make anything seem neat if she's into it.

**ME:** Is she the one who got hit by a car last year? Drunk driver?

**EMMETT:** Mhmm. She's lucky the cocksucker only broke her leg and shoulder.

**ME:** She's doing well?

**EMMETT:** Yeah. Anyway, we're sitting there, she's telling me about how I'm some jumble of letters... don't remember. *laughs* Sorry, Ella. Suddenly, August comes out from the kitchen and just stands there. Just *stands* there. Watching us. Completely silent. I only knew she was there because I saw her in my peripheral vision.

**ME:** Huh. You know, I don't think you've ever told me this one.

**EMMETT:** No, I haven't. Because I knew you'd never believe me.

**ME:** I do believe you. I would've—

**EMMETT:** I know. Just let me finish, sugar. So, I ask August if she's all right. She... slowly, really slowly, moves her gaze to meet mine, but it... it wasn't... how do I put it? Normally, when you look from one spot to another, it's instant, or appears instant, at least. Look between me and my mug. See? Eyes back and forth in what feels like one movement. But when you're watching something move around, like, say, a doctor's light, your eyes move smoothly. There's no "instant" or "singular" movement. Picture a 30 FPS video versus a slideshow. That's how August looked at me. From the air between Ella and me to my face. You can't do that unless your eyes are following something.

**ME:** Did either of you have anything on the table that might've been producing steam?

**EMMETT:** No. Nothing.

**ME:** Is August... mentally unwell? Like... could she have been hallucinating?

**EMMETT:** Isla...

**ME:** I know, I know. Only offering an outside perspective. I just don't want you to be scared.

**EMMETT:** Don't worry about that. Anyway... August took so long dragging her eyes to me that Ella had more than enough time to turn around and witness it herself. She isn't saying anything, just watching August slowly meet my eyes.

**ME:** What happened?

**EMMETT:** August is still just standing there, staring at me. I call out to her again, ask her if something is wrong. I just... know, in my gut, that this is another "incident" with... whatever the hell is haunting that place.

(I notice that Emmett's eyes are welling up.)

**ME:** Baby? Are you okay?

**EMMETT:** I'm... I can't believe this. I'm fuckin' crying. What the fuck?

(At this point, I put my laptop aside and moved closer to Emmett, extremely concerned. I asked him what was wrong, and he said that getting these experiences off his chest, specifically by telling *me* about them, was frighteningly and unexpectedly therapeutic. He explained that he only ever let me know about the "small ones," and kept the "more fucked up ones" to himself because he thought I wouldn't take him seriously. He said that me finally hearing what he'd been through was like a truck being lifted off his chest that he hadn't known was there until right now. I felt fucking horrid and told him how sorry I was for making him feel so alone. We cried together for a bit before he requested that I keep writing. I asked him if he was sure, and he said that he was. I made us some more hot chocolate, and then we continued.)

**EMMETT:** So... back to what happened. I call out to August again, ask her if something is wrong. She doesn't respond, and I start to notice how unbelievably still she is. It doesn't even look like she's breathing. It's as if every part of her has been paused except for her hair, which is fluttering around a bit because she's standing right underneath a vent. Ella's still looking at her, so I can't see her face, but I can tell from her body language that she's creeped the fuck out.

**ME:** Jesus... I mean, I would be, too.

**EMMETT:** I say August's name. Three times, each louder than the last...

(Emmett stops talking and cocks his head to the side.)

**EMMETT:** Do you hear that?

**ME:** Please tell me you're fucking around.

(I'm getting a bit freaked out, and am tempted to stop typing.)

**EMMETT:** I thought... no. Never mind. I'm on edge from talking about this, so I'm hearing things. *laughs* Don't worry.

**ME:** Let's go get Jujube.

**EMMETT:** Of course.

(We leave to retrieve our cat. It takes a few minutes to find him because he's sleeping under my recliner. We bring him back to our room, where he snuggles contentedly into Emmett's lap.)

**ME:** That's a great quality loaf. No limbs at all. Zero.

**EMMETT:** His tail is wrapped around his side, too. Nice and compact.

(We both laugh. Emmett pets Jujube for a bit before continuing his story.)

**EMMETT:** So, like I told you, I yelled August's name a few times. Ella's shaking, looks like she wants to fucking bolt. There's this tension in the air, and it's getting worse and worse. Like, when you're watching a horror movie and you *know* a jump scare is coming. And then, she... August's eyes slide over to the drive-through window, just as smoothly as they did to me. Not her head. Just her eyes. And from where she's standing, the window is pretty far to her right, so by the time she stops, she's looking fully to the side.

(Emmett takes a small sip of his cocoa.)

**EMMETT:** And she starts moving. Somewhat. Her chest and shoulders begin to rise and fall, rapidly. As if she's seeing something that's petrifying her, but she can't move. I can hear her, too. Her breathing. She's... fucking *terrified*. Fuck, so am I. So is Ella. Just as I'm thinking about standing up and confronting the situation, her head begins moving. Slowly. So slowly, I couldn't be sure if it actually *was*. But it starts to... speed up. Just enough for me to know. Her head, and only her head, is rotating at what is still an excruciatingly slow pace, as if she's about to look behind her. She's breathing even faster now, and starts whimpering faintly. But she isn't shaking. The movement of her head is... it is unnaturally smooth and fluid. Her neck is tensing, hard. Isla, it looked like she was fighting the movement of her own body. When I think about it now, it was as if an invisible hand had wrapped its fingers around her skull and started twisting. Like... how you open a water bottle.

**ME:** What the fuck?

**EMMETT:** The closer she gets to looking behind her, the louder she whimpers. Ella is pressing all her weight against me. She’s crying. I stand up and shout and wave my arms in the air, as if... I don't know. Trying to get the attention of whatever's about to... to break August's neck. And it seems to work. Her head stops turning. But now, I feel like I've fucked up. I think, "It’s coming for me."

(Emmett begins gnawing on a marshmallow. I stare at him, waiting.)

**EMMETT:** Nothing happened. And then, well... you know that feeling of an impending jump scare I mentioned earlier? There's this... sound, it's like... how do I describe it? Imagine a cross between a gunshot from a revolver and an upstairs neighbor dropping something heavy on the floor. It was fucking *deafening*. Do you understand? I couldn't hear properly for the next 3 days.

**ME:** I understand. I think.

**EMMETT:** I'm sure Ella screamed. I know I did. But the bang was so sickeningly loud, I didn't hear either of us. It sounded as if it came from every direction at once. A moment after it happened, I realized that at some point, the pounding winds from the blizzard had ceased. Because now, they were back.

**ME:** But what happened with August?

**EMMETT:** Her head and arms were hanging out of the drive-through window. She was unconscious, so I had to pull her back inside.

(Emmett takes a sip of his cocoa. Jujube lets out a high-pitched huff.)

**EMMETT:** She came to fairly quickly. No more than 3 minutes after I brought her inside. She didn't remember anything, but she was terrified. Inconsolable. She couldn't stop crying. She told us she felt... violated. Grievously violated. Like the deepest, most indescribably intimate parts of her *being* had been defiled in ways her mind was not biologically capable of comprehending.

**ME:** I don't... I can't... how do you recover from that, then?

(Emmett looks down at Jujube, fast asleep on his back, arms and legs stretched out.)

**EMMETT:** I haven't seen her since.
