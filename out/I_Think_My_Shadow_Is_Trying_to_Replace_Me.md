I don’t know why I’m writing this.  
I mean, I do know why. Someone needs to know.  
It’s important. But at the same time… maybe it’s not real. Maybe I made it all up. Maybe if I stop thinking about it, it will go away.  
But I can’t stop thinking about it.



**Day 1 – A Small Anomaly**

It all started with something stupid. A tiny detail. I was washing my hands in the bathroom, and I noticed my shadow on the wall was slightly… off. Just a little. As if it wasn’t perfectly aligned with me. Nothing strange, not really. Maybe a trick of the light, an odd reflection. But it unsettled me. I raised my hand. It followed. Normal. I smiled. It smiled back. Nothing be alarmed of. I think I need  some more sleep, I feel tired.



**Day 5 – Paranoia Creeps In**

I can’t stop watching it. It’s stupid. But now, I check it all the time. Every time I move, I make sure. It’s there. Always there. But sometimes, I feel like it hesitates. Like it has to think before it mirrors me. I’m just tired. I haven’t been sleeping well those past few weeks.  
I think I haven't, right ?

**Day 12 – They Don’t Understand**

I told Marc at work. He laughed. “Dude, it’s a shadow. It’s not alive.” Of course. Of course a shadow isn’t alive. But WHAT IF he’s wrong? I mean, what \*is\* a shadow, really ? A void. The absence of light. But if it doesn’t really exist, then how can it be there ? How can it move ? How can it smile ?

**Day 20 – There's Something Wrong**

I barely sleep anymore. Every night, I watch it. Sometimes, I think it watches me too. It’s getting sharper. More… defined. But I feel blurry. Unfocused. I avoided my reflection this morning. Something was wrong with my face. It seemed… less mine. Maybe I’m slipping away. Maybe the shadow is taking up more space.



**Day 26 – Nonsense**

I went to the store to buy milk. The floor was soft. Like skin. Every step felt like I was walking on something alive. The store lights were too bright. Too white. My shadow was clear. Too clear. It looked like it was suffering from the light. I need to go inside, or it might die. I left without buying the milk.



**Day 32 – Disappearance**

I didn’t see my shadow today. It’s gone. But I can feel it. I know it’s watching me.



**Day 40 – BLURRING**

I think I slept. Or didn’t. There was a door, but it was both open and closed at the same time. I saw my reflection. It wasn’t me. I said “hello,” and it replied, “I almost got you.” Why is my shadow speaking through my reflection ? Why do my thoughts echo in a language I recognise but don’t understand ? Why aren’t my hands my hands anymore ? Why am I the shadow now ?
