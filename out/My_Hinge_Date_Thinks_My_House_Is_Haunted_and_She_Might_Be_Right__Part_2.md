*How did I get this ghost? What was it?* The questions spilled out of me to Penny.

“Everyone tries to complicate ghosts, like there’s always some backstory or they latch onto you because it’s someone you knew or something. The truth is it’s just a glitch in the afterlife system. Some get lost and hang around. They try to cling to any life they can find and hang on so if you get stuck with one that’s it,” Penny explained. 

*I needed more. Why me?*

“It’s totally indiscriminate. It’s like a virus. Like your water heater guy could have left in here, the pizza guy could have brought it. Usually, if you’re mentally healthy enough you don’t notice them and they wilt and go away. They live on attention. Clearly you’re not clear of mind. That’s why I told you to stay home, we don’t need you out there running around, spreading it around,” Penny answered. 

*But it looked and acted like people in my life? My exes. My mom.* 

“They evolved that to show up as people you know and love so you would keep them around. If you’re healthy enough, it doesn’t present that way, and the only way to beat it is to get better, which you seem to struggle with doing. It talks to you. It interacts with you. It drives you crazy. What do you think happened to all those homeless people out of the street screaming at nothing?”

*So the house isn’t haunted? It’s only people that matter?*

“No, that whole ‘it’s the person that’s haunted, not the house’ is just an excuse made up by writers to keep the family in the house in movies and books and stuff.”

*How do I get better?*

“Just you gotta let the thing in and be stronger than it. Don’t give in. You never should have fucked that wild ex when she showed up. You knew she was bad news and probably could have given you and S.T.D., or got pregnant. You knew the ex you liked wasn’t real. Deep down. You knew she wouldn’t just show up unannounced and want you again, but you let it in.”

*So what do we do?*

“WE don’t do it. You do it. I’m leaving and you just have to fight through it and not let this thing take you down. It will eventually fade.”

*Okay, all good, it can’t kill me?*

Penny hesitated. I didn’t like that. 

*Right? There’s no documented cases of a ghost hurting or killing…*

“You think ghosts leave fingerprints? D.N.A? You hear of someone dropping dead randomly of a heart attack while otherwise healthy? Fall in the shower? Someone who doesn’t seem depressed committing suicide? They mess you up in to doing it.”

This information didn’t set well. Neither did Penny leaving, despite her encouragement that I could get through it, along with a reminder that I couldn’t leave the house or interact with anyone. 

*Wait.*  I ran out and caught Penny before she drove away. Clearly bothering her, but I had to ask her the question. 

*“Don’t you have it now? The ghost?*

“Kind of like a virus. Once you get through one, you’re immune,” Penny said and drove off.

I was on my own. I turned on every light in the house. Turned on a bunch of electronics, just like Penny said. I wanted to draw this thing in this time. 

I sat there, numbly watching T.V. and waiting, trying to remember the things that Penny told me. 

I had to just let it come and ignore it. Not give in. I couldn’t leave home. It would get fainter and fainter and I had to just keep pushing through. Don’t reach out to her, that would show weakness. Just ride it out. Try to sleep. 

That’s what I did. I went to bed. 

Then it started. 

I was lying in bed and I felt the heat start to crank. I started sweating profusely underneath the blanket I had pulled up over my head.

I could feel it there next to me. Next to the bed. 

Then I felt it start to pull on the blanket. It was strong. I was not going to be able to fight it off. 

I soon found out. I was soon looking at my younger brother, James, who passed away when he was in his early-20s. 

Always stronger. Always more confident. James was a force of nature with no fear. Which is why he passed away - thinking he could drink entire bottles of liquor and drive, and not get caught, or drive off a highway and crash his truck. 

This was the kind of thing James would do growing up. Go into my room and pummel me. Pin me. Wrestle me. Assert his dominance.

He started to climb on top of my chest and I turned away. I laid on my side and just let him keep trying to wrestle me and grab my attention. 

This virus of a ghost was diabolical. It knew James would rupture my heart. Even worse than my mom. 

I never got to say goodbye to James. He was just gone one Sunday morning when I woke up. My older brother. The one who stood up to anyone who picked on me. Reduced to ashes off of Highway 9.

He kept chiding me in my ear to try and get me to fight back the way he always would. He took everything in me not to turn around. 

Then I felt him twist my ear. I felt real searing pain. He cranked it hard a way he never would in real life, reminding me it wasn’t really James there torturing me in my bed. 

*Penny had said like a real virus, it was going to get worse before it got better and I could see the light.* 

I finally got out of bed and ran to the bathroom. I could finally breathe for a moment and collect myself. 

Then the lights started to flicker off and on. An annoyance James would love to terrorize me with when we were kids. 

It took a second but James started to come back into picture in the bathroom mirror - drenched in blood, his neck ripped open. The sight of it got me to start crying uncontrollably. I could barely see my tears were so thick. 

James started to plead to me - begging me - sounding soft and pathetic and hysterical and scared in a way I never imagined my big, bad, older, brother could. 

“Please, please, please, you gotta help me.”

There was nothing I could even do by the looks of it either - he was bleeding out, and fast. His blood was splashing all over me. 

He leaned all his weight on me and I stopped fighting. I let him take me down to the floor. 

Then he flicked out the lights and I felt myself start to feel like I was suffocating.

I woke up in the bathtub - half-full with water and the shower pounding water down on my face - cold and shocking. Penny stood next to the tub, looking pained, but relieved that she saw life on my face. 

It took me a second to realize something else odd - the lighting was dim and murky. It was candlelight. 

“It got you to turn the power out and I can’t figure out how to get it back on,” Penny explained. 

I couldn’t think of how I would have even done that, especially considering I had just woken up from a black out. 

“It had you deep. You were almost gone,” Penny went on. 

“What happened?” I asked Penny. 

“I realized I had to come help you. I also realized it’s my fault. I relapsed,” Penny said. 

I had no idea what that all fucking meant. Apparently, with Penny’s explanation, it meant this:

She went home and was greeted by the awful violent spirit of her abusive dad. His presence gave her a revelation - she wasn’t getting creeped out by the spirits in my house that first night she stayed over, she was creeped out because my house really reminded her of her horrible childhood home, where her dad terrorized her.

The vulnerability my house kicked up in her had left her open to getting invaded by the virus of new spirits - bad ones. And she had left that energy at my house that first night, and it festered and grew with the darkness and vulnerability inside me. 

But she would make it right. It was all her fault, and she was falling apart. 

I heard the grotesque sound of a gristly throat clearing outside the bathroom door. I saw Penny’s face drop in a way that made me very, very uneasy. 

Someone tried the door handle. It rattled. Locked. I heard an angry man scream at the door. 

“Open the fucking door, right now.”

“Can’t it just get right through the door anyway? It’s a spirit. Mine did it.” I asked Penny. 

“It’s what this one wants to do. It wants to get angrier,” Penny whispered back. 

Penny killed the candlelight. Pure, unfiltered darkness reigned again. 

The angry man kept yelling belligerently and trying the door. He pounded on it, nearly breaking the thick wood. 

I had been through a lot. My body felt ravaged. I had no idea if I was going to be able to sustain whatever pissed off evil was going to come through that door very soon. 

I knew one thing though - I was going to fight for Penny. I wasn’t going to let this poor woman suffer any more. Even if she was supposed to be my sherpa and how she was the one crying scared. 

I felt Penny run away from me. She was out the bathroom door because I could stop her. 

I could hear a struggle out there. 

I went out into the living room. No one was there. 

The front door was wide open. 

I watched Penny’s shitty car drive off down the street.

Penny wouldn't reply to my texts, calls, or social media requests. I wasn’t sure if she was alive or dead. 

I never felt or saw odd things in my house anymore though. I felt truly alone again for the first time in a long time. In a good and a bad way. 

The solitude allowed me to reflect on everything with Penny and what she said - the way the ghosts appeared and presented themselves. How there were good and bad spirits. 

I wondered if Penny was just one of them all along. A good one. 

I let it go and happily went on with my life, just more thankful. 

I dated again. I got a girlfriend. 

Said girlfriend and I went to a farmers market one day. I drifted away as she got lost in some jewelry stand or something I wasn’t interested in. 

I wandered by a candle booth. The curly hair of the woman manning it caught my eye. It was Penny. Undoubtedly. 

My eyes lingered on her as I walked past. 

She never noticed me. That was fine with me. 

I kept walking.
