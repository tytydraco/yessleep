So this happened a few nights ago, my memory is hazy and I don't exactly remember how or why I went there but I was in a big building in my city, I'm not sure what it was used for, most likely business offices, but all I remember is taking the elevator and noticing how it kept going down forever.

The elevator itself was pretty unique, it had numbers from 1 to 9 but the elevator never went up. In fact whatever you typed with the numbers would show up in red on screen on top of the keypad and it could fit three digits. So if you pressed 8 it wouldn't go up to the 8th floor but instead would go down to the 8th basement floor. If you typed 2,5,8 it wouldn't go up to those floor respectively like a normal elevator would, it would instead send you down to the basement floor 258.

In first instance I remember of taking that elevator there were other people in the elevator and they typed something I couldn't see properly and it went down to the 80th basement floor. I went out and was already shocked because how can a basement even be so big. I decided to go down on that floor and everything was eerie, it was all concrete, like a backstore or a loading dock for a big store. There was an inclined ramp and some strip curtains but it felt so weird... I explored a bit around and it was mostly mechanical rooms that were making weird noises, they seemed to go on forever and there was no one else there besides me, as if the people who dropped off with me disappeared. I was too scared to explore more so I went back in the elevator.

Then I don't know why but the elevator kept going down and at this point I was terrified because assuming how deep this place was, what if the elevator got stuck down there or had an issues. I'm not claustrophobic but this wasn't a good feeling at all.

Inside there were, again, people in it but I was too scared to use the keypad and mess it up so I just stayed in hoping it would go up. Unfortunately it didn't. It kept going down and we reached the basement floor 400 in a few seconds; I have no idea how an elevator can be so fast.

I went out and it was the same thing, more mechanical room, ramps and strip curtains. I ran back into the elevator and fortunately this time it went up and I reached floor 0 which is the exit of the building. When leaving I noticed a sign on the wall that said the number of floors in the building. It must have been put there as a mandatory sign for the elevator or to follow some civil engineering laws. It was just an elevator pictogram with a stickman going inside the elevator and next to it was written "380".

It reassured me as at least I know it doesn't go deeper but I was confused why I reached floor 400 if there is only supposed to be 380...

The first thing I did when leaving the elevator was to go talk to the employees at the reception and asked them how many floors did the building have, they weren't very helpful and told me they didn't know the exact number but they said it was a big building.

Honestly, I was just glad to be out and left this god-forsaken building never to come back. I don't even remember how I got home, all I'm left with is the memory of this scary building.
