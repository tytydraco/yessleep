[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/181u02j/has_anyone_heard_of_the_wobbly_man/)

Hey everyone, sorry it’s been a couple days, for those that didn’t read part 1 it’s linked.   
  
So Jack was taken into foster care over the last couple days, I had thanksgiving at the local diner here in town because my family live on the other side of the country. I ordered my plate of turkey, stuffing, mash potatoes and gravy and a few other sides and the nice waitress named Peggy swore that the pumpkin pie was to die for so I ordered a slice of that also. I decided to look at some of the other drawing that Jack gave me before left the other day.   
  
I had asked him who “The Wobbly Man” was and he just drew a picture with a blue square with The Wobbly Man standing in the middle of it, at the bottom of the page he had written:   
“he came to my window…”   
  
What the hell, I have never read anything more creepy. But my mind considered something…   
  
What if the Wobbly Man was a neighbor or someone that had come to his window? Predators have done crazier things to get their target.   
  
I was in the middle of my meal when someone sat down next to me. It was Officer Kelley. I guess we both were still “on duty” today. We had a nice dinner and I asked him if he could investigate sex offenders that were close to where Jack lived, He said he would.   
  
While in the middle of eating my pie, Kelley’s walkie went off, “10-68 at 2468 West Monroe Street”   
  
I asked him what that meant, he told me someone had called for police at that location.  
  
He stood up as I began to dig around in my bag, I pulled out the sticky note, I knew it had sounded familiar   
  
It was the address to the foster family Jack was staying at,  I stood and explained this to Kelley, he agreed I should come too.   
  
I drove my car and followed him as he pulled up there was a large black mark up the side of one of the windows on the top of the house. It had been from a fire.   
  
The foster parents came outside to talk to Kelley, apparently Jack had went to bed and the Mother woke up to go to the bathroom and smelled smoke, she opened the door and saw Jack by the window a large fire in a smalled trash can near the window and the fire had spread to the curtains. Busting out the window and causing the scorch marks outside.   
  
I walked in and saw Jack sitting at the dining room table. He had dirt on his face and looked scared like he was in trouble.   
  
“hey bud, funny seeing you here.” I joked and he smiled. We talked for a little while.   
When I went back outside I over heard the Foster parents telling Kelley they wanted Jack moved.   
   
It being the holiday, its going to be hard to find someone to take him. I didn’t plan on doing much anyway so I rudely butted in and said I could take him atleast for the night. and could try to call CPS in the morning.   
Kelley agreed and helped Jack pack the little stuff that he had in a black trash bag.   
  
We arrived at my office. I felt like it would be inappropriate to take him to my apartment. Plus I had a small pull out cot at my office that he could sleep on and I could sleep at my desk.   
  
Kelley left after helping me get Jack settled and then I walked him out. Thanking him again.   
  
When I got back to the playroom Jack was sitting at a table drawing. He drew me 2 more pictures while I set up the cot and then tucked him in.   
  
The first one had a picture of Jack smiling along with his Sister (Allison), Brother (Dylan) and then a lady in a orange dress and gray hair she clearly had trays of cookies in her hands,   
At the bottom of the page it read:   
  
“grandma came to visit today she brought cookies with her, we love her cookies”   
  
I smiled and flipped the page and my smiled fell into a frown, the second picture had the family dog (Teddy) covered in red crayon, big black X’s over his eyes and then behind him was a dark blue car with dark windows but in the window… there were red eyes….   
  
Below this page it read:   
  
“Mommy said Teddy was sick and had to go to the doctor, The Wobbly Man said Mommy lies…”   
  
I was at a loss for words, the family dog, which from the pictures looked like a golden retriever, had been hit by a car and died and Jack watched it happen, how sad.   
  
I walked to my desk and set the pictures down and then walked back to Jack and tucked him in.   
  
As I turned to walk away I said goodnight, he was drifting off to sleep at this point but managed to utter out something that broke my heart:   
  
“goodnight miss Caroline, I love you.”   
  
I just smiled back at him and told him goodnight and shut the door and went to my desk, I opened the drawer on my left side and pulled out the bottle of whiskey I kept there for emergencies. I poured me a small glass and sipped on it till I fell asleep.   
  
I woke up a few hours later and went to check on Jack he was still asleep, I checked my phone and Officer Kelley had texted me asking if everything was okay. I’ll message back in the morning.   
  
I decided to hop on here for this update real quick and I’ll try to update tomorrow when Jack wakes up. We do have a session tomorrow also so hopefully I can get more of the story from him and finally figure out what all happened to him and his family and how he was the only survivor…
