I’ve never been particularly susceptible to strong emotions. I’m not talking about the usual shocks or jumpscares—no, I’m talking about how I’ve hardly ever been deeply affected by anything in my life. I guess I have God to thank for this tranquility that has shaped my existence.

But even so, I can’t shake this feeling of unease right now. It’s hard to explain, especially since I left behind those childhood fantasies that used to stir my imagination. It’s curious how, from a young age, the unknown fills us with fear, and that feeling seems to linger with us well into adulthood.

Have you ever felt like something is watching you from the darkness?

It’s normal; it’s just a survival instinct we’ve carried through the ages, because nothing is more natural to living beings than self-preservation. Ironically, it’s the same instinct that makes us tremble before a final exam, that makes our hearts race when talking to someone we like, or that brings tears when we feel alone... Things that aren’t real dangers but still exist. So it’s no surprise that we’re afraid of what we can’t see.

Ghosts, demons, monsters—all those creations of our wild imagination born from uncertainty, that sense of insecurity we feel when we can’t control a situation. And it’s easier to attribute that unease to external forces. But really, there’s nothing there. So why should I be afraid of being alone on the stairs?

I’ve gone up these stairs thousands of times before, yet I always feel overwhelmed when I slowly climb this narrow space as night falls and the cold of the darkness fills the small void, dripping down the clay-stained walls, damp from the rain that seeps through.

This is the first step.

I’ve never understood it. I don’t scare easily, and this situation doesn’t resemble the typical low-budget horror movie scene where something terrible awaits once the protagonist descends into a dark, empty basement. On the contrary, I don’t feel this discomfort when going down—it’s only when I go up.

Curious, isn’t it? I’ve always felt a heaviness when climbing up to my grandparents’ rooftop. It’s one of those irrational feelings that stick with you from childhood, something you can’t explain logically. The rooftop has nothing but a pleasant view of the house across the street. Still, it doesn’t help that the surrounding houses were built with an extra floor, and despite the open sky, I always feel like I’m trapped in some kind of surreal stage with an invisible audience.

I don’t think my grandparents ever cared about building a second floor beyond a small room in the corner. The rooftop, covered in dirt blown by the wind, was perfect for playing with my cousins when we were kids. It was always a "safe" place where our parents didn’t have to worry about us being hit by a car or encountering strangers. Whenever we visited our grandparents, we’d inevitably end up there, chasing each other and playing until we were exhausted.

I remember those days with happiness and innocence. Once, I thought I saw a gnome among the flowerpots, but beyond that, there was never anything that scared me or any accidents that left me traumatized. It wasn’t like that at all.

Maybe what unsettles me is something more specific, something more senseless: the small room at the far end.

That room wasn’t filled with torture devices or candles for esoteric rituals; it was just my grandfather’s workshop, where he spent his time practicing his craft, his profession. He was a skilled sculptor, especially with wood, and it’s no wonder he combined those talents to create crucifixes and religious figures that sold well in our small, devout community.

That little corner was well lit, so he could see every detail while carving. For us kids, it was the perfect place to hide during games of hide-and-seek, or to play house, or to wait offstage when we tried to perform our makeshift plays. There weren’t many other places like that, so that room was perfect for our childhood fantasies.

But something always felt off when I had to go into that room to wait. Maybe it was the warmth held by the scattered wood shavings, like a small oven or heater, or perhaps the strange acoustics that made my cousins’ voices sound muffled, as if I were underwater, slowly drowning. Or maybe—just maybe—it was all those cold, empty eyes staring at me from the shelves and furniture around the room. All those pale hands pointing at me, pleading for mercy—or perhaps secretly judging me. Those reminders of blood seeping from crowns of thorns and hearts ablaze, painted with firm brushstrokes, as if begging for forgiveness from some merciless being...

Fear of God? Naturally. Ever since I was little, I’ve been told to honor and respect that omnipresent figure of authority who will judge my actions after I die, who knows all my mistakes—even the small ones I didn’t notice until it was too late. Those tiny acts of selfishness we overlook, which are carefully examined to decide whether we’ll be rewarded or, if not, condemned to eternal suffering.

There’s nothing to worry about. If you were a good person in life, then... Why should I fear death right now?

I step up again.

Honestly, I don’t even think about mortality as a real possibility. We usually take things for granted until they’re no longer with us. I didn’t even think about it when my grandparents passed away.

They were very close, though not exactly united. They argued sometimes, and my grandfather would retreat to his workshop. Maybe those figures, which made me uncomfortable, relaxed him. The smell of dry paint often lightened the mood when the room was silent and still. They both passed away within a short time of each other, as if trying to accompany each other into the afterlife… But I’m not sure I can say they’ll be together.

I always thought I’d like to be more susceptible to these things—not for the thrill of fear, but to make family gatherings more interesting, where we share our strangest experiences. Objects falling on their own, doors slamming shut, echoes in empty rooms... None of those stories resonate with me since I’ve never experienced anything like it. But my cousin Berenice was different.

My aunt always said she had a gift—a strange way of boasting about her daughter’s ability to see angels. Supposedly, they accompanied people to guard them. If you were lucky, Berenice could even describe the angel watching over you.

She couldn’t see them clearly, but she could make out the length of their wings, the whiteness of their robes—generic details, nothing important. I always thought it was ridiculous. Why would someone be able to see beings of light like that?

Oddly, unlike my aunt, Berenice seemed annoyed whenever someone brought up her "gift." You could see the disgust on her face whenever, during family gatherings, someone asked her to describe their angel again. Except when she spoke with our grandfather.

It’s funny how a single trait or activity can bind two people, even more than the blood they share. My grandfather’s fascination with Berenice’s ability to see these figures grew to the point where it became almost an obsession.

We often saw them chatting in the living room—he on his single-seater and her bouncing around on the larger couch, describing in detail the spirits of light she occasionally saw. My parents once called it a sweet bond.

It didn’t take long before my grandfather started taking these conversations to his workshop. I noticed how he eagerly sketched small drawings based on Berenice’s descriptions—white hair, long legs, robes fluttering in the wind, swirling folds. All these ideas were carefully translated into perfectly modeled, meticulously painted figures, which he would later sell to local temples or collectors.

And so it went on for years. My grandfather’s curiosity about bringing my cousin’s strange visions to life grew stronger with each passing year. With time, Berenice began to discern new details about the beings she saw. Soon, these luminous creatures took on various forms. She said the angels weren’t always attached to people; they flew freely through space and sometimes simply waited in specific places. They weren’t as easy to spot anymore, but she could now make out more than just silhouettes—items they held or rough facial features.

Of course, these descriptions ended up in my grandfather’s creations. He listened, sketched, and sculpted exactly as Berenice described, never doubting her. Not even when she started mentioning impossible features: twisted grimaces, additional eyes in odd places, joints bent the wrong way, extra heads—or missing ones. All of it appeared in the final sculptures that now adorned only his workshop. It was no surprise these new creations didn’t sell like the traditional figures.

I never understood why anyone would want something like that in their home, even if it was sacred. Why would anyone want a reminder of suffering and stigma?

I take another step.

As time passed, Berenice stopped describing angels to us. I assumed it happened when she reached adolescence and lost interest in such things. But she never stopped visiting my grandfather, and he never stopped sculpting her bizarre visions. The wooden bodies that once faithfully resembled human forms began to have large empty holes. The paint grew darker, coarser, compared to the shine that reflected from the pale skin of earlier figures, which now seemed hidden behind their opaque layers.

The last time I heard Berenice talk about angels was at one of our family gatherings. She sat on the long green sofa that now rests behind me. We were all gathered around her, sprawled on the carpet and couches, listening reluctantly to the words she spoke.

Apparently, the number of beings she could see had increased, and their features were becoming clearer to her. Being in our grandparents' house allowed her to see them more vividly. She commented with mild curiosity that the house seemed to attract them, to the point where she could count on meeting at least one new one with each visit. My aunt swore it was a blessing from God.

Berenice described new details about how the shadows that formed in the folds of their robes and flesh, where the light didn’t quite reach, created large, hollow voids, as if the material itself didn’t exist. Then, all of a sudden, she gasped. She froze, staring at the staircase—the very one I’m climbing now—with such a blank, lost look that I’ll never forget it. I can almost feel her watching me right now.

Her mother could only say, “It’s nothing,” as she wrapped her arm around Berenice’s shoulders. But small tears started rolling down her cheeks, gradually turning into deep sobs, occasionally interrupted by guttural cries.

My grandmother rushed to hold her, trying to soothe her. All the adults did what they could to ease her suffering—everyone except my grandfather, who, blinded by some incomprehensible fascination, insisted she describe what she had just seen in great detail, despite my grandmother’s repeated scolding, telling him to leave the child alone.

Berenice took what seemed like an eternity to say anything. Minutes dragged by as her cries turned into wails that even our younger cousins began to echo in a haunting chorus. The atmosphere was so overwhelming that I retreated into a corner—the furthest one from the staircase I couldn’t bear to look at, knowing there was nothing there. But I couldn’t shake the thought that maybe something really was there, something I couldn’t see.

Berenice finally opened her mouth and stammered a few words to our grandfather—words that, I’m sure, no one fully understood.

“I saw it.”

“What did you see, child? What did you see?”

“I saw Jesus.”

I climb two more steps.

Berenice never visited our grandparents again. She couldn’t bear to step into their house. I ran into her a few times, but I never dared to ask her about what had happened that night, and I didn’t want to try to understand her intense reaction.

My grandfather, on the other hand, became obsessed with uncovering every detail of her experience. He would visit her regularly at her home, even though he had never cared to do so before the incident. My uncles told me he even offered to pick her up from school, just to help untangle the puzzle of the image she had seen. I stopped asking about it after my grandmother died.

After that, my grandfather’s health worsened, and his mental state deteriorated. He was never present at family gatherings anymore, always locked away in his workshop. My mother tried several times to pull him out of there, but he always gave her a dry response, saying he was working on his masterpiece—the reason he had dedicated his life to sculpting.

He was committed to something unorthodox, no doubt about that. I only saw him once more before he passed. He looked neglected—his hair and nails had grown unnaturally long, and the few rotting teeth he had left gave his breath a foul stench. Yet he seemed happy. He said he had completed his greatest work and, in his own words, was now ready to rest in peace.

He died shortly after.

His funeral was modest, held in a small chapel in the city center. The whole family gathered one last time to say goodbye to his thin, lifeless body, lying beneath the imposing figure of the Virgin Mary, arms open and face serene, which he himself had sculpted years before. Berenice was the only one who refused to attend.

The service went on as expected: a long sermon from the priest, small sobs here and there, and the sounds of sniffles from runny noses filling the hour that seemed to stretch on forever.

Until the tranquility of the moment was shattered by whispers and murmurs from the back of the room. There, kneeling at the open glass doors, was Berenice. She appeared unconscious, but tears streamed down her face, and dry, choked breaths escaped her lungs as she struggled to catch her breath.

To outsiders, it must have looked like the heartbreak of a grieving granddaughter, unable to cope with the loss of her beloved grandfather. But I knew it was something else—something that was probably there at that very moment, something no one else could see.

Looking back, maybe it wasn’t the best idea to come here alone. Maybe volunteering to retrieve my grandmother’s crucifix—the one my grandfather left hanging on the workshop door, the one he specifically asked to be buried with—was too much for me. But I’ve never been one for strong emotions.

Who better than me, immune to the fear and uncertainty of my cousin’s stories, to venture out into the lonely night of our grandfather’s wake to retrieve something so insignificant from that now sad, desolate place?

I take another step.

Six steps so far. Just ten more to go—a little more than halfway, and then I can grab the damn crucifix, run down the stairs, and never come back to this house again.

“Look up,” a voice said—one that wasn’t mine.

It was an intrusive thought, no doubt. I hadn’t realized until now that I’d been staring at the steps the whole time. My instinct for self-preservation told me to keep my eyes down. How silly. Was someone watching me in the perpetual darkness of the night? One thing was certain—I had forgotten to turn on the light before I started climbing. Going back to fix that wasn’t an option, not when I was so close.

I reached out, pressing my hand against the damp wall to keep my balance as the sudden awareness of my surroundings hit me. A sense of security swelled in my chest, a flash of self-assurance, reminding me that solitude wasn’t dangerous—it was safety. If there’s no one around to harm you, there’s no reason to fear what you can’t see... Unless, of course, you can see it when you look up.

I heard a loud thud, followed by a ringing in my ears. A wave of pressure pulsed from my temples down to my legs, leaving me frozen, unable to respond to the alarms my brain was screaming at me to run.

There, at the top of the stairs, in front of the door—strangely wide open, inviting the cool breeze to brush against my face—there was a grotesque silhouette. Its presence was imposing, and without even touching me, it made my blood rush through my body at such a speed that I could feel it retreating from my limbs like a colony of ants.

That silhouette—it was undoubtedly the figure my grandfather had worked on so intensely until the day he died. The air grew thicker, pressing against my face with every gust of wind that slammed into me. Finally, the feeling of being watched wasn’t just my imagination. Now, it was right in front of me.

It was a tall figure towering over the doorframe that separated me from the real world. Maybe it was just the angle, but to me, it seemed to block out all light that could have slipped through from the starry sky behind it, giving the illusion of a divine halo.

But there was nothing divine about it. In that moment, I understood what Berenice had tried to explain, what she had struggled to make sense of when she saw it with her own eyes. I wouldn’t dare call it Christ, not by any stretch. My heart pounded in my chest, my body trembling in time with a heavy march that made me feel anchored to the step beneath me.

Its body was covered in a long, loose, purple robe, adorned with gold. The folds of the fabric clung unnaturally to its frame, revealing a disturbingly thin figure. The hyper-realistic carvings of its wooden torso showed ribs that didn’t align naturally. Not only did it have too many ribs, but they also jutted out at strange angles, as if someone had tried to force them back into place after carving them.

Its hands pointed toward me, palms up in a gesture of prayer, but its fingers were uneven. Some were missing joints, as if they had been donated to the longer ones. But they all had nails—long, black nails extending from decaying flesh, where bits of raw tissue, streaked with black, peeked through like congealed blood from a fresh wound. Some nails curled into grotesque spirals, making my stomach churn with revulsion at the abomination before me.

Its hair was matted, soaked in a viscous fluid, and paled in comparison to the crown of thorns embedded so deeply into its skull that the thorns seemed to grow out of it. They distorted its ears, its cheekbones, and even pushed one bloodshot eye entirely out of its socket, though it remained attached by a thick layer of hardened skin, holding its face together.

This was no blank expression, no peaceful or merciful face. For the first time, I saw real terror and suffering in its features—a being begging for help, its face covered in cracks where insects crawled, burrowing into the hollow body of the statue.

I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, but my mind kept telling me over and over again that it was real—more real than my own existence. Sweat ran down my back, soaking my hands as my nerves frayed. Its mouth twisted into a grimace that could have been either a scream or a mocking grin, its lips barely holding back some incomprehensible wail from deep within.

Finally, I understood why Berenice had broken down when she saw this thing. She had lived with this horror, forced to relive it over and over while our grandfather immortalized it without remorse. I understood now, as tears streamed down my own face, and I found myself frozen in place, unable to move. The paralysis gripping my muscles was stronger than my desire to run. I had to remind myself, as terrifying as the thought was, that it was just a lifeless piece of art—just the sculpture my grandfather had carved for months.

I sighed in relief, but then my thoughts struck like lightning in a storm:

Why was this figure outside the workshop, standing exactly where Berenice had seen it for the first time?

A cold knot tightened in my stomach as I heard the slow creaking of wood from above. The sculpture was just a collection of raw materials, assembled to resemble something caught between the human and the divine—something that shouldn’t be able to move on its own. But it did.

Amidst dry creaks and hollow groans, its hand stretched toward me as if waking from a long slumber. But the worst part wasn’t the arm—it was the sense that something behind that lifeless face had begun to stir, as if an external force was filling its features with awareness.

A chill ran down my spine as I realized that this figure wasn’t what it seemed. It wasn’t just a sculpture. There was something else trapped inside it—something that was now starting to smile, opening its thin lips wider, revealing a row of jagged splinters twisting inside its mouth.

Soon, my sobs turned into prayers that echoed in my head, but I couldn’t even feel them. It’s natural to be afraid of something you can’t see—it’s natural to fear God... But in this moment, as I stand on this staircase that points to heaven, I know that God can’t see me.

The figure began to lean forward, the sound of dripping breaking the silence of the night. I could see it lower itself onto a step.

My instincts screamed; the alarm finally went off. I clutched my pounding heart and started to descend. I couldn’t see anything in the thick, oppressive darkness surrounding me. All I could do was count.

Five... six... seven... How was this possible? I hadn’t even made it halfway up the stairs, but now they seemed endless. The air grew denser, almost suffocating.

My panicswelled as I glanced behind me. The figure had only taken two steps, but it was closer to me, as if I had never moved at all.

I screamed in desperation. My body was moving, but my mind was frozen, fixated on the presence that would eventually reach me and drag me away, just as it had symbolically claimed my grandfather—and perhaps had tried to take Berenice, too.

I lost focus, stumbled, and fell into the darkness. The fall felt eternal. I could only think of getting as far away from that thing as possible, from the entity creeping toward me with every passing second. Soon, a burning pain shot through my shoulder, spreading down my arm. I opened my eyes to find myself facedown on the living room floor, in front of the unmistakable green sofa stretching across the room.

I couldn’t stop crying, but I knew I had to run. I scrambled to my feet and bolted for the door, not daring to look at anything but my escape.

When I finally returned to the wake, my uncles were worried, and my mother asked where I had been. Apparently, I had been gone for about two hours, and no one had been able to contact me until that moment. I didn’t know what to tell them. I had no idea how to explain what I had just experienced.

I also couldn’t explain how my grandmother’s crucifix had ended up pressed against my chest. All I knew was that it had left a red mark from the pressure with which I had been clutching it. But now, as I realized it was over, I felt relieved that at least I had accomplished my goal.

I never returned to my grandparents’ house. There was no reason to. Eventually, the family stopped gathering. Without our grandparents, there was no excuse to meet again, no way to escape the pressures of work and daily life.

Some time later, I ran into Berenice. She seemed distant but more at ease than the last time I had seen her. I didn’t have the strength to tell her what had happened, but I did anyway. I had to.

The seriousness on her face told me everything. It was as if memories she had fought hard to bury were coming back.

She just sighed and admitted that since our grandfather’s death, she had gradually stopped seeing angels. She chalked it up to growing up, dismissing them as childhood fantasies she no longer belonged to. Deep down, I knew it was her way of protecting herself from what had happened.

Sometimes we lie to ourselves to calm down, to make ourselves believe that the feelings we once had were nothing more than survival instincts, that the things that hurt us were external and no longer exist—that they were buried long ago and can never return. But deep down, we know that’s not true. We know that feeling will never truly go away, no matter how hard we try.

It’s hard to forget that our actions will be judged when we die, that God will confront me one day and demand complete honesty—to make me recognize the moment I forgot to feel His presence, the moment I feared something that, in its own twisted way, represented His existence and magnified His eminence.

The moment I ran from His touch, from His creation... It’s painful to realize this now, to be fully aware, and to have to live with the dread of knowing that one day, the gates of heaven may close for me and for Berenice—just because we refused to climb when the time came.
