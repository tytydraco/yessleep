My ramblings will make no sense unless you've also read my [initial report](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1dmqk1c/comment/la5byl6/?context=3).

“I wish I could undo it all. I wish I could take it back.” Without context, without direction. I wished to undo it all. Everything. I think I accidentally wished to undo everything that ever has been.

I didn’t see much of anything that first night. There wasn’t really any tangible proof that I made a mistake.  but the sense of the wish being granted in an unintended way was as clear a truth in my mind as is my name. There was certainty that my wish, unfinished, had reached a force beyond our comprehension, and that force replied with an excited vigor.  
  
And what’s worse, is all this time later, as I write this, it seems that only but a very few can see this devastation. People go about their days, completely unaware of the damage I’ve wrought upon them. They do not react to the embalming of our present. They live on, existing seemingly separate from what I’ve done. But I see it happening. I know it is. And I know I’ve not yet completely lost my mind. My sanity is intact. My observations and experiences have been shared.

I stood there at the precipice of life and death. The wind roared from far below as the ocean tried ever harder to press forth against the timeless cliff face. A truth was borne within me that my wish had been granted.  
  
The first signs were subtle, such small things at first, almost imperceptible. My house was moved a few feet to the west. Every other line on the sidewalk between 10^(th) and Havannah (13^(th)) was gone. The air weighed just a little less. I tried to rationalize these discrepancies, convincing myself that my mind was playing tricks on me.

But then the absences and discrepancies became more pronounced.  
  
The absences became more pronounced. I woke up one morning to find my house shifted several feet to the west, as if the universe had casually decided to relocate it overnight. The lines on the sidewalk between 10th and Havannah Street vanished, leaving a smooth, unmarked expanse of concrete that unnerved me every time I walked over it. The air itself felt different, lighter, as if it were slowly being siphoned away.

At first, I tried to rationalize these discrepancies. Perhaps there had been construction I wasn't aware of, or maybe the city had decided to repave the sidewalks. I convinced myself that these changes were merely the product of an overactive imagination, a mind strained by guilt and grief.

But then, the absences became impossible to ignore.

People began to disappear. Parts of them, anyway. It started with acquaintances, people I saw in passing but never really knew. I first noticed it at the grocery store. I was standing in line, lost in thought, when I looked up and saw the cashier, Jack, who I'd chatted with on numerous occasions. A friendly guy, always quick with a smile and a joke, albeit always exhausted. But today, he was missing part of his head. It was simply gone, leaving a smooth, featureless void where his eye and temple should have been. Yet, he seemed completely unaware, scanning items and chatting with customers as if nothing was wrong.

"Hey, Jack," I said hesitantly when it was my turn, eyebrow furrowed. "How.. How are you feeling today?"

He looked at me with his one remaining eye, his smile as bright as ever. "Hey there! How's it going bud?"

I stared at the void, my mouth dry. "I’m uh, do you... feel okay?"

He chuckled. "Never better! Just another day, right?"

I nodded, trying to ignore the nausea roiling in my stomach. I paid for my groceries and hurried out of the store, somehow denial already mounting at what I’d just seen.  
  
The barista at the coffee shop was next. I went in for my usual coffee, hoping the familiarity would ground me. As I approached the counter, I noticed something was terribly wrong. The barista, a cheerful young woman named Allisson, was missing parts of her hands. The middle, ring, and pinky fingers on both hands were gone, along with portions of the hands themselves. Yet she moved with the same fluid grace, preparing coffee as if nothing were amiss.

"Good morning! What can I get for you today?" she asked, her voice bright and cheerful.

I stared at her, my mind reeling.  
  
“Did you notice me new ring?” She asked with enthusiasm. It must’ve looked like I had, since I was just staring at her hands. “Dave proposed to me last night! Can you believe it?!”  
  
“Uhh…” Was about all I could manage at that moment. I also noticed her right elbow was gone.  
  
After a brief pause, she pressed on “Oh but never mind that!” She chirped. “What can I get started for you?”  
  
"Uh, just a latte, please."

"Coming right up!" she said, turning to the espresso machine. I watched in horror as her fragmented hands worked the machine with practiced ease. She frothed the milk, poured the espresso, and handed me the cup, all without missing a beat.

"Here you go! Enjoy your coffee," she said with a smile.

"Thanks," I muttered, taking the cup. As I left the shop, I glanced back and saw her serving the next customer, her smile unwavering despite the voids on her hands.  
  
Soon, it was my friends. One evening, I called my friend Mark to talk about the latest book we were reading for our informal book club. The phone rang endlessly, and when I visited his apartment, I found it empty. His belongings were gone, even his tacky 80’s wallpaper he had installed by himself in his kitchen. His neighbors claimed they had never seen him before.

*-George Berkeley*

I noticed it in conversations too. I would be speaking to someone, and mid-sentence, they would blink out of existence, as if they had never been there. Their words hung in the air for a moment before dissolving into nothingness. I started to avoid talking to people, afraid that my words would somehow trigger their disappearance.

One day at work, my colleague Jane was tasked with explaining a project to me. Mid-sentence, she just swirled in upon herself. It took about 3 seconds, and she was gone. I blinked, trying to process the visual emptiness where she had been standing. My other colleagues continued working, oblivious to the fact that Jane had ever existed.

"Did you see that?" I asked, my voice trembling.

"See what?" my manager replied, not even looking up from his computer.

"Jane. She just... disappeared."

He gave me a puzzled look. "Who's Jane?"  
  
One morning, as I walked to the corner store, I felt a strange sense of foreboding. I felt as though I would walk through water at any random moment. The sun shone brightly, and the birds chirped in the trees, but an uneasy feeling settled over me. I couldn’t shake the sense that something was terribly wrong.

As I approached the store, I saw him, my first Bleeder.   
  
He was standing at the entrance, a man in his forties, wearing a plaid shirt and jeans. At first glance, he seemed perfectly normal, but as I drew closer, my stomach twisted.

Most of his head was missing, a gruesome, gaping wound where his face should have been. Blood poured from the wound in a continuous stream, cascading down his neck and soaking his shirt. The sight was horrifying, a macabre fountain of crimson that seemed to defy the laws of nature.

Following the blood trail with my eyes, it lead to his car which was also dripping blood from the doors

He stood there, oblivious to the blood, chatting casually with a passerby. They were discussing the weather, laughing as if nothing was wrong. The passerby, a woman with a shopping bag, didn’t seem to notice the torrent of blood, nor the fact that she was standing in it.

The man finished his conversation and walked into the store, leaving a trail of blood behind him. Inside, he greeted Jack, the cashier, who smiled and handed him his usual pack of cigarettes. Jack’s void wasn’t hemorrhaging though, it was the same as it was the other day. Blood splattered the counter, but Jack didn’t react, his hands moving through the crimson mess as if it were air.

I felt that awful mouth watering feeling, the urge to vomit quickly became overwhelming. I stumbled backward, my vision blurring. I needed to get away, I needed to catch my breath.

As I turned to leave, I glanced back one last time. The man was at the register, counting his change, completely oblivious to the blood pouring from his head. The cashier continued to smile, unfazed by the gore.

I fled the store. Outside, people went about their day, chatting, laughing, completely unaware of the man bleeding, maybe to death, inside the store.

Back at my apartment, I locked the door and collapsed onto the couch, my heart still racing. I tried to rationalize what I had seen, but there was no logic, no explanation. The bleeding man, the oblivious people, the world’s growing strangeness—it was all too much.

It took me a while to ffind the nerve to leave my apartment again, but I still had responsibilities at  that time that needed addressed.

I started noticing changes in my own reflection. The mirror in my bathroom showed me as I was, but there were moments when my image seemed to flicker, replaced by a distorted version of myself. I would see shadows behind me, dark shapes that shifted and writhed. I would turn around quickly, but nothing was ever there.

Over the following days, I began to notice quickly increasing voids in the world around me. Places that had once been familiar were now replaced by dark, featureless spaces. It was as if some visual parts of reality were being consumed by an unseen force, leaving behind pockets of nothingness, though the function of the objects remained. Interacting with these pockets was possible as well, with no notable adverse effects.

One night, as I walked home, I saw an entire block of buildings vanish before my eyes. The streetlights flickered and went out, leaving a gaping void where homes and businesses had once stood. I stood at the edge, staring into the darkness, feeling a profound sense of dread.

It was a few weeks after the wish that I encountered my first Eater. I was walking through the park, trying to clear my mind, when I saw a shadow that seemed too dark, too solid. It moved slowly, with purpose, and I watched as whatever it bit turned into a new void.  
  
At first, I thought it just a trick of the light, but as I approached, the sense of wrongness grew. The entity was not just a shadow; it was an absence, a void where nothing should have been. It moved with an eerie, deliberate grace, consuming everything in its path.

I watched, awestruck, as the entity consumed a tree. The tree didn’t simply disappear; it was as if its visual existence was being devoured, leaving behind an empty space where it had been. The air around the void shimmered slightly, like heat waves rising from the pavement. I could still feel the presence of the tree, the air disturbed by its branches, but it was no longer visible.

The entity continued its slow advance, moving toward a bench where a couple sat, oblivious to the approaching darkness. I wanted to shout, to warn them, but my voice caught in my throat. The words died on my lips as the entity reached them. They too were consumed, their bodies vanishing into the void, leaving only an eerie stillness behind. The thing vanished with the bench, and the people.

I waited and watched, looking for any sign of “the eater”. When I determined that the eater was gone, I ran to the bench, my heart pounding. The space where the couple had been felt strange, as if the air itself was different. I waved my hand through the area, feeling a slight resistance, like moving through water. The couple was still there, in a sense, their matter occupying space in a dimension that was perceivable but not directly observable.  
  
The space felt the same as the “walking through water” sensations I would get as I traversed the town.
