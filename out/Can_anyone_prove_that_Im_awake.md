 

I woke up to the sound of rain tapping against my window. It was a dark and stormy night, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. As I lay there, I remembered the dream I had just had - it was so vivid and realistic. I dreamt of a woman, standing at the foot of my bed, staring at me with a blank expression. I couldn't see her face clearly, but her eyes seemed to be filled with sorrow and pain. I tried to shake off the feeling, but it lingered with me as I got out of bed.

I walked to the kitchen and made myself a cup of tea, trying to clear my head. As I sipped on my tea, I couldn't shake off the feeling of being watched. I paused for a moment, listening for any unusual sounds, but there was nothing. I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me.

Just as I was about to go back to bed, I heard a faint noise coming from the living room. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest. I slowly got up and tiptoed towards the living room, my hand gripping the kitchen knife tightly. I peered into the living room, but it was empty, nothing out of the ordinary. I let out a sigh of relief, but the feeling of unease lingered.

I walked back to my room and climbed into bed, trying to shake off the feeling of unease. But just as I was about to drift off, I heard a knock on the door. I sat up and listened, my heart pounding in my chest. The knock came again, this time louder. I got out of bed and cautiously made my way to the front door. I hesitated for a moment before opening it, and there she stood, the woman from my dream, with the same blank expression and sorrowful eyes.

I screamed and slammed the door shut, my heart racing. I could hear her laughing on the other side, a cold and sinister laugh that sent shivers down my spine. I ran to the phone and dialed 911, but the line was dead. I realized then that I was trapped, with no way to escape from the woman from my nightmare.

I could hear her voice, whispering my name, taunting me. I knew I had to keep moving, to find a way out. I ran to the back door and tried to open it, but it was locked. I could hear her getting closer, her footsteps getting louder.

I was running out of options, and I knew that she was going to find me. I could see her reflection in the window, standing right behind me. I turned around to face her, but she was gone. I looked around frantically but she was nowhere to be found.

I realized then that I was still dreaming. But this dream felt too real to be just a dream. I woke up again, this time in a cold sweat, and I knew that the woman was still out there, waiting for me to fall asleep again. I couldn't shake off the feeling that this was only the beginning of something much more sinister. I knew that I had to stay awake, to never fall asleep again, because the next time I do, she'll be there, waiting for me.

It's been days since that night, and I haven't been able to sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see her face, and I can hear her voice whispering my name. I'm not sure if I'm still dreaming, or if this is all real. But one thing I know for certain is that I can never let my guard down again, because she's still out there.
