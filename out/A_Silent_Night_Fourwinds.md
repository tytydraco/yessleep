Shifting the gears and just flooring the truck would not have worked I knew so I had to build up the speed, my mind was racing through every form of PTSD and my body wanted to freeze. It was a cold morning but from the fear and adrenaline I did not care as I pushed the truck to the max, I passed the thing, and it began to run behind the truck. It was fast and I wasn’t exactly a mile away from it, so I managed to catch up with the truck and hit the side of the truck. The impact was not exactly earth shattering but it still causes me to momentarily loose control, since the ground was hard from the cold i managed to keep some control and pushed it forward. Looking at the rear view the massive hand of the thing was holding on to the rear door. It slowed the truck a little but the adrenaline in me kept the gas pedal down, I could feel the strain on the tires but honestly it didn’t make much of a difference as it had to let go from the strain and I bolted forward.

I darted for my gate and onto the main road out, I kept one eye on the rear view and could see it running forward after me. Once on the main road I gained speed and saw that it could not catch up, then after a few steps it disappeared into the woods, after that I kept my eyes on the road but knew it will probably be stalking me. After a few miles I could feel the adrenaline withdraw and the fatigue kicked in and my hands were shaking from all this, my vision was also slowly fogging as I wasn’t exactly at peak health, so I knew I needed to stop and catch my breath. After another 20 minutes I saw a few cars coming my way with the sheriff’s car at the front, I hailed at them, and I could see they were slowing and I did the same and stopped in front of the column of cars.

I then placed my hands over the steering wheel and my head on top of it, I needed to breath and could hear the sheriff call my name. What felt like a second was a few minutes as the sheriff had run out of his cruiser and found me slumped over my wheel, he opened my door and with the help of the few locals brought me out and lay me on the side of the road. The doc was with them, and he gave me an jab of something to wake me up, I opened my eyes and looked up at the grey sky trying to remember where the actual fuck I was but I guess the rush of memories was just waiting for me to fully wake up. I was helped up and could see several men walking around looks towards the woods as if something was about to jump out.

The sheriff squatted down and handed me a tin mug of coffee which I took and enjoyed its warmth, I then realised I was only dressed in a flannel shirt and jeans for exactly warm for this cold. I took a few sips and could feel the memories walk in and then recounted exactly what happened after I dropped the phone, the men were also listening, and none spoke till I finished. The older of the group I knew as Old Jeb spoke first, “looks like you had a run with the ‘squach Mason, this one looks like he must be pissed at someone. Your shots may have just ticked him off further, you still alive may give us some hope but we need to head on over to your place and see if we can finish this thing.”

The other man muttered their agreements, the sheriff stood up and spoke, “I know y’all want to finish this fucker before it gets to your places, but we need to do this with a plan or we all die. Marsh boys, Jeb and Tom you move on forward and keep an eye out, anything moves fire first, we need to either end it or maim it. I don’t want to go back with a few less men you got that. Mason you will be with me, your truck will stay here, that flat you got will not take you any further anyway.” I looked at my truck but did not see where the flat was, I got up and walked over to the other side and saw, there was a large dent on the back and the flat was worn down to the rim. It was parked on the side of the road and the men were already pilling into their cars and I followed the sheriff to his cruiser.

I checked my shotgun and cocked it, the round was ready and it was already loaded for me thanks to the Marsh boys. I sat back and waited for the sheriff to start, he radioed to his station on the situation and asked for more units to be sent in case things got out of hand. I looked at the men in cars, they looked angry and ready to butcher anything that stood in their way. Blood will paid in blood in this place, there was not simpler solution here unless there was a reason for it, there have been generations of families wiped out by this simple rule but there were others that rose. My family descended from farmers that worked the hard land and lumber here. The sheriff handed me some jerky, “you need to eat something, whatever that thing is I need you to be sharp. It may be a sasquatch but only care to know what it really is after its dead. I heard the body count in the other place was as high as 10 people so whatever it is I would rather have it with an extra hole in the head.”

I asked about the girl and the sheriff mentioned that she was air lifted out as there was nothing the doc could do for here, also the state troopers refused to assist as they had too few to spare along with the wardens. We were on our own, like I said our government did not care for us small town folk, fuck them. Blood for blood.

As we drove back to my place I was started to go over all the details in my mind and trying to figure out how it managed to hide in the barn or did it try to rip out the door looking for me. I was running the whole situation in my mind as the convoy drew closer to my home. One moment I was looking out the window with my shotgun ready the next I hear loud bangs from the front cars, they were firing at a particular spot in the trees, looked like they saw something move. The sheriff shot out and signalled to stop firing, he turned to see where they were firing and there was nothing there, I got out and joined him. Walking over to where he was I looked down at the door and could see where my truck had passed there were black gouges on the road, looking back I never thought I would be such a situation but here we are. I stood next to the sheriff and looked over to the spot that was smoking from all the firing, walked forward without thinking to take a better look and the sheriff put a hand on my shoulder to hold me back. There was nothing there just a shattered trunk and fallen leaves, I looked around and could feel the eyes of something on me. It was here or it was just the paranoia but I could feel a tightness in my chest and now my blood was freezing. I turned to walk back to the cruiser along with the sheriff as something flew out of the forest and hit the first car, it was a broken branch and I dove for the ground as the men in the second car began firing at the direction of where the branch flew from.

After a few minutes the firing stopped and then there was complete silence in the air, a loud roar was heard coming from the woods and that just about froze everyone. One by one the men got out of their cars and huddled together looking out in every direction, their guns were ready and they were scared now. Whatever courage they had was unloaded in the first round of bullets now all that was left was raw fear and instinct to survive. They muttered prayers and cruses under their breath, slowly looking at everything and anything, I was up and looking around to see and I noticed the shadow moving the woods and I pointed my gun at it. Noting where I was looking the men also followed my line of sight and aimed their guns, it was then another thing flew out of the woods from another direction and a couple of them knocking them on to the ground the other scattered and began firing haphazardly into the forest, the sheriff tried to stop them but the fear had now a complete grip of these men. I knew this tactic as it was used by the Vietcong to split platoons of soldiers, the simplest tactic but the most effective. This however shattered my mind, there were more of them, I turned to the sheriff and shouted “there are more of them, tell the boys to get back into the trucks we need to get out of here or we are dead sheriff.” Just as I finished the line something darted out of the woods and grabbed one of the closest man and yanked him into the woods, his screaming could be heard and then snap.

The silence returned at it was like a landslide it covered everything; the men were in total shock now and it looked like we were ambushed. One by one the men slowly began to huddle again and move towards where the man I knew as Tommy Wilkes was taken into. I followed them as I did not want to stand alone, we crossed over into the woods and it the shade it was another world we entered. As we trudged forward all the men were quiet just looking in every direction. I looked around and could feel my heart pounding in my chest and my breath felt like I was breathing in hot sand.

We found Tommy’s remains and a couple of the others lost their breakfast, Tommy was ripped in 2 and his entrails were scattered around him along with all the blood and viscera. To me it looked like he was a grenade victim, I walked closer and began to examine him better the sheriff tried to gather the rest to bring some order, a couple of them were screaming at him while others were crying doom. Tommy was ripped in 2 but 2 different hands and now I understood completely what was happening, one hid in the barn while the other ripped the doors out thinking it was saving the other. I got up and told the sheriff we need to leave now. I heard the roars again but this time there was one more.
