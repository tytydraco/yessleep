Have you ever heard of the “Infinite Hitchhiker’s Game”?  
Of course you have. I know Jake’s been posting about it around here. But let me tell you something: the game is so much more than what you were told. My name is Maya, and this is my story on the other side of the Endless Hitchhiker Game.

I grew up in a big city, fast, hectic life, chaos and noise. It wasn’t exactly an easy childhood. My mom had a loud laugh, the kind that makes you want to laugh along, but she always carried this sadness with her. She had her own demons, and apparently the best remedy she found was to numb herself with alcohol and other drugs. I honestly try not to hold grudges, but one day she just left for good, leaving me behind,apparently her lap only had room for the addiction, not for a six-year-old kid.

When she disappeared for good, I promised myself I would never become like her: so desperate to escape my own reality that I’d get lost along the way.

But irony is the universe’s favorite pastime. Years later, there I was, getting into a car next to Jake, just to prove that this stupid game was exactly that: an urban legend blown out of proportion by the boredom of small towns.

I won’t waste much of your time recapping what happened out there on the road. If you’ve made it this far, you’ve probably already read his part. ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lqrpxg/what_happens_if_you_play_the_endless_hitchhiker/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))

So I’ll be direct: in the end, it wasn’t Jake who stayed. It was me. And what nobody tells you, what none of those damned legends ever mention, is that when you stay, you don’t stop driving. I’m writing this… well, I’m not really sure why. Maybe so someone on the other side knows I’m still here. Or because I’m afraid of forgetting who I am. Because here, on this road, everything conspires to make you forget.

Forget your face, your name, who you loved. All that’s left is the driving and the rules. Now I’m the one holding the wheel, obeying lists I don’t even know who wrote, stopping to pick up strangers on the shoulder.

And if you think the game ends when someone “wins” or “loses,” I’m sorry. There’s no victory here, there’s only more road. So if it’s any good to you, here it is: the truth about what happens after. The story from the other side. My story.

I wish I could tell you it was quick, painless, almost like falling asleep and waking up somewhere else. But it wasn’t like that. When Jake left, or rather, when they took him out of here, the world around me didn’t explode in light or swallow me into a black hole. It just… kept going. The yard with the hanging bulbs was still there, the wet ground under my feet. The passenger turned to me, that thin smile still carved on his face, and held out his hand like someone asking you to dance.

I hesitated. I felt my whole body protest, an urge as old as fear itself, the instinct to turn around and run. But my legs wouldn’t move. I can’t say if it was pure cowardice or something more sinister, like the road itself had grabbed my ankles, keeping me there, rooted. Those shadows (dozens of spectators watching us) still frozen all around me. When I finally took his hand, his skin was cold as steel.

He guided me through the lights, in silence. Each bulb cast shadows that crawled along the ground in a slow, almost lazy ballet, but there was nothing beautiful about it. Whispers brushed the edges of my hearing, words that seemed spit from the corners, muttering my name and curses. I forced myself not to listen. I quickly learned that here, in this place, paying too much attention to things is the fastest way to be consumed by them.

We crossed the yard and came to a road I didn’t remember seeing before. It wasn’t the narrow, damp highway we’d arrived on, nor the cracked asphalt I swore I’d driven with Jake. This new stretch looked… hastily built. The ground was a patchwork of different kinds of asphalt, each piece slightly different in color, joined by crooked seams like scars. The side was lined with crooked lampposts, but only half of them worked. The darkness there had a strange thickness, almost liquid, like it dripped from the pines onto the road.

That’s when I saw it: the car. It was there, parked next to a moss-covered mile marker. A dark, old sedan, rounded edges in a design I couldn’t place. It looked freshly polished, but the reflection was wrong, it showed images that didn’t match what should’ve been behind me. When I got closer, I saw the steering wheel had no brand emblem, just a smooth, dull metal circle that seemed to pulse faintly under the diffused light.

The passenger gestured for me to open the door. I did. The leather seat creaked under my weight, releasing a dry, earthy smell that I couldn’t tell if it came from the upholstery or the car’s age. Before I could say anything, he leaned in through the open window and placed something in my hand: a small pocketknife with a short blade, the handle carved with symbols I had no idea how to read.

— *“You’re gonna need this,”* he said.

I just nodded. There was no room for questions, even though I had a thousand stacked on the tip of my tongue. He then opened his hand and gave me a piece of thick, yellowed paper. The rules. The text was written in thin letters, with one of those fancy, elaborate scripts like old-time documents. I read them, one by one.

1. Pick up any hitchhiker who sticks out their arm, unless you’re already carrying one.
2. Never ask where they’re going.
3. If they start crying, turn up the radio until the crying stops.
4. If the hitchhiker offers you something during the ride, refuse three times; they’ll insist.
5. Keep the center rearview mirror tilted slightly upward. Never look at the ground beside the car.
6. If someone on the shoulder asks for a ride with both arms raised, close all the windows and don’t slow down.
7. When you need to refuel, always pick the second gas station you see. The first one is waiting for you.
8. Accept the hitchhiker’s payment, no matter if it’s money or not.
9. She’s chasing you, always behind you. Avoid stopping too long. She only rests three hours a day.
10. When you hear three knocks from the trunk, don’t stop. Accelerate.

My stomach twisted when I reached the last ones.

When I looked up, the passenger was already gone. Vanished the same way he’d appeared: no warning, no sound. It was just me and the car, and a road that seemed to stretch on forever ahead, calling me.

I turned the engine on. The rumble was low, almost gentle, like the car knew it would have me for a long time. So I pulled out. And that’s how my new job began. Only much later did I realize I never felt hunger or sleepiness in this place. I always stop at stations (the second one, as the rules say), buy something to chew on, but it’s an empty habit, just so I don’t forget what it was like. I don’t need to sleep, but sometimes I rest my head on the wheel and close my eyes, trying to pretend I’m still just human.

And every time I think too much about it, I feel the pocketknife in my pocket grow a little heavier, like it’s reminding me that despite everything, I can still choose to fight. At least for now. The stations are relatively safe places where I can relax a bit, fill up the tank, get an internet signal (I’m at one while I’m typing this) and even take a shower if I feel like it.

And you’re probably wondering about Rule 9, who *she* is, the one who’s always chasing me. Well, I guess it’s time to talk about her.

Her.  
My mother.

Or rather, a sick parody of her. On my run with Jake, we found her in a swampy forest clearing. The Passenger seemed to enjoy how scared I was of her. A deformed creature, about four meters tall, thin, almost an embodiment of my own fear, and worst of all: she looked like my mother, her dark hair now hanging over her face, greasy. Her eyes are two frantic orbs spinning in every direction, looking for something to lock onto.

And that laugh… It’s not just any laugh, it’s a twisted version of those long laughs she used to have. There’s something almost primal in it that makes me feel nostalgia and threat all at once.

Now I live balanced on this thin wire. I can’t stop too long because she always comes. I have to keep moving, picking up strangers on the roadside, following rules like an endless loop of work. All the while, deep down, I carry this thread of foolish hope that maybe one day I’ll find a way back home.

But part of me already knows that’s just another lie I tell myself so I can keep driving.

And so I go on. Deeper into the road, engine humming low, always moving. Sometimes I forget my name for a few seconds, and the static on the radio pulls me back. Then I repeat it to myself, so I don’t lose it for good.

My name is Maya. I’m in the game.

I wish I could say the rules make everything predictable. That by following them to the letter, I was safe from any danger, like they were some kind of shield against this place’s chaos. But the truth is, even routines here can betray you. Especially when you start to feel too safe inside them.

That’s what happened the other day, when I stopped at the second station.

They’re all pretty much the same. Rectangular structures, corrugated metal roofs, dying lights that throw yellowish patches onto cracked concrete. Inside, the shop usually has narrow aisles, shelves loaded with packages you can’t read, no expiration dates, no nutrition info at all. And almost always, an attendant, someone I have no idea if they’re human, another lost soul like me, or just another quirk of this road.

Until then, they’d never given me a reason to worry when I stopped. Those attendants would fill up the tank, ask if I wanted it full in a flat, monotone English, take my payment without really looking at me. It was almost comforting, a tiny piece of normal life from the other side.

But that day, the second I pulled in, I felt something was off.  
It wasn’t the wind, too still or the buzzing lights inside too loud. It was a smell. The kind that fills your mouth in the wrong way: metallic, thick, like biting into a coin. When I stepped inside, moving slow, trying to ignore the low hum of the freezers’ compressor, I came face to face with it.

The attendant’s head. Just lying there on the floor, still inside the red cap, a thin line of dark liquid dripping from the half-open mouth, stained teeth. The eyes, two cloudy pits, staring so hard I swear I thought they’d blink.

Behind the counter, something moved. A wet, repetitive sound, like chewing raw meat. I snapped out of it and ducked behind a toppled shelf, peeking through the gaps.

I saw the arm first. Long, skin so pale it looked almost see-through, showing dark veins pulsing slow. The fingers ended in sharp nails, hooked like claws, digging into the headless body of the attendant, ripping chunks straight into a mouth that opened on the thing’s neck.

I was panicking. Even the Passenger felt like a civilized threat, like "a manipulative entity". But this, this was savage, animal. It reminded me of that dark figure that chases me, sending another shiver down my spine. I started backing up, toward the door, eyes locked on it the whole time, until I stepped on something and the floor creaked. The chewing stopped. A frozen second. My whole body screaming to run. Then the thing’s head turned to me.

Or heads, because only then did I see it. From the shoulder sprouted another jaw, grinning with a twisted, almost childlike joy, spitting blood between gray teeth. The creature hissed, half whistle, half scream, and sprang over the counter, its body stretching like a whip, arms reaching all the way to the floor. I screamed, turned on my heels and ran, smashing into a row of shelves, knocking down moldy packages that burst in green dust.

It came after me. Fast. The sound of its claws digging into the floor was uneven but too quick, matching my heartbeat pounding in my throat. I tripped near the door, slammed my shoulder into the glass, which shuddered under the impact. When I turned to push through, the thing was already there, stretching its arm for me, its damp stench like sewer breath.

That’s when I heard a dry crack, something slicing the air. The thing’s arm hit the ground, spraying black sap that hissed when it touched the linoleum. A second later, the extra head exploded in a dark spurt.

The creature let out a guttural sound, half whistle, half shriek, and turned toward the source of the shot. A man standing at the back door, holding a small, almost handmade crossbow, already reloading. He wore a thick, battered jacket, the fabric stained and faded to some color between green and brown. On his left arm, strapped with leather, there was a red cloth band marked with dark lines like runes. A cord of black beads and tiny bones swung on his chest.

The car parked outside was pitch black, covered in scratches that, under the station lights, formed almost a pattern. Lines and spirals etched into the metal, ending in a symbol on the driver’s door: a circle inside a triangle, split down the middle by a crooked line that looked like it was burned in.

He stepped forward with this calm, predatory pace, feet silent. The crossbow fired again. The bolt, or whatever it was, slammed into the creature’s chest. It screamed and collapsed in a twisted heap, still twitching.

I was on the floor, half propped on a shelf, breathing so hard I saw black spots dancing in my eyes. The man passed by me without a word, checked the dead thing, then walked to my car. He opened the gas tank, started filling it up like nothing had happened.

When I finally caught my breath and stepped outside, he just shot me a quick glance. Gray eyes, deep-set.

— "Next time, watch your step."

I wanted to ask who the hell he was, or thank him, or say anything at all, but my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth. He finished filling the tank, closed it up, wiped his finger with a rag, and headed to his own car. Before getting in, he lifted his chin at me just slightly, almost respectful.

— "Don’t stay longer than you have to. She never stops for anything."

And then he was gone. The engine faded into the road, taking with it the only person who seemed to have any control over this place.

I just stood there, frozen, the car purring next to me, still wondering who that man was. And more than anything, what that red armband meant, the cord of beads, and the symbol carved on the door.

But I guess out here, some questions only feed more hunger into whoever’s listening.  
So I climbed back in, turned on the radio, a folk station this time, its static oddly comforting, and drove.

Always forward. Because here, stopping too long is never an option.
