I’m from a small town in the UK, small enough to give me a funny accent and for most people to draw a blank when I tell them the name. It’s a seaside town that was popular in the Victorian times as a holiday resort but has since fallen off in modern times thanks to its growing population of Vape Shops.

This happened back in the early 2000s, when you could still smoke in pubs, and my father used to take me to the local quiz nights on a Friday when my mum was working night shifts and couldn’t look after me. My memory is a bit fuzzy so I might miss a few details, but I can still taste the lime cordial and fizzy water treat my dad would buy for me while I doodled on the quiz sheet.

The man who hosted the quiz was called Captain Rhod. He would only respond to his title, and every night when he hosted the sloshed patrons would always call out an eager “Aye, aye Captain”.

Captain Rhod had retired to my town after years in the navy. He got a hefty pay out after sailing a HMS liner with faulty wiring. He always told the story of how he stepped in a puddle whilst doing rounds and got zapped (his words, not mine), leading to him having these intricate scars trailing up his leg. If you got him drunk enough he’d eagerly whip his trousers off so you could have a look.

I liked the Captain. He used to sneak me a packet of crisps when my dad wasn’t looking, and he could do this incredible Donald Duck impression.

Everyone liked the Captain.

I suppose he got bored after years of hosting the quiz and farting about in my town. I think after years of trailing the sea, the land just gets boring. He had a bright idea to purchase his own small boat and set sail again, telling everyone how he was going to spend the rest of his retirement out in the ocean, and when he finally popped his clogs, he hoped the boat would keep sailing endlessly.

He anchored the boat out on the harbour, slowly transforming it as the days went by. I remember my mother asking him why he didn’t buy a new boat with all his money, and he simply scoffed at the notion.

Anas platyrhynchos domesticus: Call Duck. The design choice for Mallory, chosen by a primary school student as the mascot to accompany Captain Rhod on his solo mission, built by the local city University engineering students. Her webbed toes were orange painted steel in the shape of sturdy triangles to support her fat aluminium body. Her rear end had a special revolute joint intended to allow her to wag her tail when prompted. Captain Rhod chose a special voice command, “clever girl”, to prompt this movement. The Captain had even named his maiden ship after the prompt, proudly painting the name on the side of the hull.

The student specifically requested Mallory be able to blink periodically, citing his disdain for robots not naturally doing this, and fearing her eyes would get dry. And so, every 30 seconds, thin sheets of metal would close over Mallory’s eyes and swiftly retract.

The Captain adored Mallory’s design, lifting her up into his arms and calling her a clever girl whenever she waddled into the room. A special ramp was built for Mallory, to allow her to sit in the chair next to him on the ship. The ramp build was not dissimilar to a Helter Skelter, as a ramp too steep would cause Mallory to helplessly topple onto her side, and Captain Rhod would have to vigilantly rescue her.

In his adoration for his companion, the Captain tweaked her design to allow her to dance to music. Spoken in his own words, “Well, we’ll out there for the rest of our lives, you know. I can’t expect us both to sit in silence, and I can hardly dance on my own.”

The dance in question once again allowed Mallory to “waggle” her tail and bend her knee joints up and down. The Captain noted that Mallory’s favourite song was ‘Celebration’ by Kool & the Gang, and he made sure to burn it twice onto the CD he brought for the journey.

The Captain was due to set sail on the 11^(th) of that month and had spread the word around town.

“Be there at half nine in the morning, I want a chance to say goodbye to you all before I go. And make sure to bring enough lagers to keep me going.”

And so the 11^(th) came, and my parents held my small sticky hands all the way down to the docks. My father had brought along some crisps for the Captain, aiming to tease him about all the times he used to sneak them to me. And we waited at the harbour. And we waited.

Nine thirty came and went, and we could see the Captains little boat bobbing up and down the water, but no sign of the man himself. My father and a few of the other blokes started chuckling amongst themselves, believing him to have overslept due to a hangover. They decided to go up to the Clever Girl and check on him after twenty minutes or so had passed. I was starting to get grouchy, and my feet were sore after walking and I was not subdued about my pain. I think they would’ve waited longer for him if I wasn’t moments away from a tantrum. My dad handed me the crisps to “keep safe” while he went and inspected with the other men.

My dad was only in the boat for a few minutes, before he sharply walked back over to me and my mum and grabbed our hands. He had turned a sickly pale colour and was muttering something to my mum. I, of course, was too preoccupied staring down at the crisps and figuring out how to open them with my tiny hands.

I’m sorry to say that this is where my memory fades, with my mother picking me up and carrying me back home, but I do remember not seeing the Captain again. I has assumed after all these years he had set sail and died peacefully at sea, still sailing even in death.

I brought him up to my dad last time I went home, mentioning how we should go for a pub quiz again like we used to. I saw my father shudder at the thought, so I pressed further;

‘Like we used to, with that Captain guy’

‘God, don’t mention him. Poor bloke’

‘What do you mean? I thought he set sail’

‘You’re joking? The boat never left the harbour. We found him sat in his chair in front of the steering wheel.’

My father then divulged the details I was too young to piece together.

The men had found the Captain in his chair, as stated. Well, most of him. His lower jaw looked like it had been yanked downwards and was left gaping, a mixture of blood and drool dripping from it. My dad said the mans stomach had been wrenched open, the same way a child greedily opens their presents on their birthday. My father had only glanced in horror, but swore that his innards seemed lacking, whatever that means. Apparently, there was no sign of entry, nothing apart from the Captain on the ship. The only lead they had was the slight flooding of the lower deck, caused by a small tear on the inside of the hull.

But Mallory was found on the Captain's lap. Her battery had burned out at some point during the night, and the thin sheets of metal had closed over her eyes. A closer inspection of the robot's parts after she was disassembled by the University students showed that her revolute joint had worn through and became so thin it could almost snap.

Those who found them stated that Mallory was nestled in the Captain's lap, with her body and face looking towards the window at the front of the ship. Her Helter Skelter ramp had been pushed against the captain's chair, and there were scratches along the metal floor of the ship leading from the co-captain's seat.
