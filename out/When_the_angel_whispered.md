I awoke to a room of silence, there was no sound, no wind, no voices, I couldn’t even make out my own bodily sounds. I realized that the sounds hadn’t stopped but my ears didn’t work, I couldn’t hear. I was completely deaf, all because that beast spoke once. To give a bit of background, I am a scientist, and my task was to discover God, prove its existence. My team had been at this for generations, I was not the first to try and discover it but I certainly hope I’m the last.  
This dates back, all the way to my grandfather's grandfather, my great great grandfather, back in the 1860’s. They tried everything, and as technology got better so did the possibilities to find it. I won’t bore you with the exact process in which to do it and because I would be executed if I so much as hinted at how to do it. For ease of storytelling, let's just say it's a portal of sorts. A year ago we set up the necessary equipment to try and contact the other side, to get a hold of something. That fateful day, we made contact, we made it to heaven. It was beautiful, it wasn’t in the clouds, nor bright white. This place was so beautiful, I couldn’t put it into words, think of it as taking every great aspect of nature and putting it on the side of a mountain. This mountain overlooked this beautiful forest with an expansive canopy. There, in front of us was a man in ancient Arabic clothing, holding a stone tablet. This must be Peter.  
He looked at us with an understanding expression.  
“I see you have been successful in your endeavors to reach heaven without finishing out your mortal time” Peter said in a sultry voice as smooth as warm butter.  
It soothed the soul. We had so many questions, we were actually so surprised it worked that we accidentally closed the portal. We wrote down what we found, reported it to the right people and wrote down the questions we wanted to ask. We wanted to get this right the first time. When we turned on the portal we sent a small team of five in. I wasn’t one of them but from what they told me when they started asking Peter all the questions that were written down from memory because according to them, the only thing you can bring are the clothes on your body at the time of your arrival. They tried asking questions or even getting into the gates but Peter told them that it was not their time. He didn’t answer any of the questions though, he told them that it would all be revealed to them in due time.   
We were not happy with this answer, we came to do one thing and that one thing was to get the definitive truth that God is real. It took months to get ready and set a plan in motion, lots of trial and error. We got ready on that fateful day, today, about 3 hours ago. I and a team of 7 others opened the portal and we stepped through. We figured out the one thing that can get through, a crucifix, we needed answers and we needed that bad. One team member held the crucifix up and started chanting in Latin. The canopy below began to rumble, and shake as a hole opened up in the ground, fire and stone began to spew from the hole, setting the whole forest on fire. Peter ran over and phased the man from existence, we knew he couldn’t get rid of this threat on his own so we blackmailed him. Let us into heaven to ask some questions and we’ll stop this invasion from below.  
It worked, but not in the way we expected, we called of the attack and he opened the gates, we walked through and were immediately greeted by the blinding light of multiple angels, they said no words, they had no physical forms, not like biblically accurate angels nor human-like angels, they were nothing and everything at the same time. One of them pushed us back, shoved us back through the portal and noticed all the satanic research we had to do to be able to blackmail Peter. The angel became visibly enraged, it didn’t change physically but I just knew it, I could feel it. Then without warning, it spoke, in a deafening whisper, the loudest quiet sound, it had no voice yet every voice, at once. It said a few simple words but they had so much meaning.  
“God help you all”  
I fell to my knees clutching my head, clawing at my ears, to make the pain stop. I screamed an imperceptible scream, not that it couldn’t be comprehended but no one could or would ever hear it. Before I passed out, I saw people being erased from existence, popped like sick balloons, torn limb from limb, filled with holes from an imperceptible force. Then I'm out like a light bulb. That leaves us here now. I just finished talking to my boss about what happened, everyone but me is dead, the machine is dead and for the life of me, I can't remember the correct calculations to get it running again. According to the official report, the experiment was a failure and the evidence proved inconclusive. Inconclusive my left nut, if anything, I give up on science, I am now a man of religion, I even started preaching my own spin on heaven, the only true reality. Please, if you can, avoid the mistakes I made. From what I heard, they plan on recruiting civilians to be guinea pigs so remember that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
