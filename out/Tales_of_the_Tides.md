**Chapter 4 – The Gathering**

The wind carried the smell of salt and rain from the sea, sweeping through the mangroves before it reached the village. Dakuwaqa stood beneath the old breadfruit tree beside the house, its roots rising like knotted veins from the earth. The mourners’ voices drifted from inside — soft hymns, the rhythm of quiet weeping. His mother’s funeral had drawn them all back — people he hadn’t seen since he was a child, faces he only half-remembered, names spoken in whispers when his mother was still alive.

He had grown up away from them, in the city, where his mother kept him far from “family business.”  
Now, they had all come — uncles in dark sunglasses, cousins with gold chains and sleek cars, women with heavy perfume and careful smiles. They carried envelopes, whispered to each other in corners, and kept their eyes on the men who spoke least.

Inside, the air was thick with grief and something else — something that felt alive. As the minister spoke, Dakuwaqa noticed his uncle Savenaca, the eldest of his mother’s brothers, place a small bundle wrapped in *masi* beneath the coffin. Another uncle, Koli, poured kava into a wooden bowl and murmured words that didn’t sound like any prayer he’d heard in church.

When the lights flickered, everyone paused.  
A few women crossed themselves.  
His cousin Mere whispered, “It’s the *kalou-vu*. They know she’s gone.”

Dakuwaqa felt a coldness move through his chest. He tried to tell himself it was just the rain, the heaviness of loss, the exhaustion — but when he looked again, Savenaca was standing by the door, his eyes fixed on him, as if weighing something invisible.

Later that night, after most had gone to sleep, he wandered outside. The moon was full, silvering the wet grass. From the beach below, he could hear laughter — deep voices and the dull thud of a *tanoa* being struck. He crept closer.

There they were — his uncles and older cousins, sitting in a half-circle around the bowl of *yaqona*. The air smelled of the ocean, strong and briny. In front of them sat a pig’s head, a bowl of black liquid, and a spear stuck upright in the sand. His uncle Savenaca spoke first, his voice low but heavy with authority.

“*Na vanua e sa rawa mai. Na noda kalou e vakarorogo tiko.*”  
(The land has opened. Our gods are listening.)

They each took a drink, then began to chant. The rhythm rose and fell like waves — names he didn’t know, words that belonged to another time. The sound pulled at him, familiar and foreign all at once. For a moment, he thought he saw something move in the water — a dark ripple breaking the surface far beyond the reef. The air seemed to hum with energy.

Then Savenaca looked up, straight at him in the shadows.  
“Dakuwaqa,” he said quietly, as though he’d known he was there all along.  
“Your mother kept you from this, but the blood still calls.”

The others turned.  
No one spoke for a long moment. Only the sea answered — a whisper against the shore.

Dakuwaqa felt torn between two worlds — the faith his mother had taught him and the old power that pulsed through the sand beneath his feet. He took a step back, heart pounding, the chant still echoing in his ears.

Behind him, the wind shifted, and from the dark sea came a single splash — as if something vast had stirred awake.
