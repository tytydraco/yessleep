I’m a Luddite. That’s what my best friend Charlotte calls me, anyway. It’s not that I hate technology or don’t find it helpful. I do, and I use it daily. I just happen to find most modern technology intrusive. Not to mention expensive. You put a microchip into a simple coffee maker, and suddenly, it’s triple the cost. Sometimes, it feels like everything we own these days has some sort of needless digital aspect that most people will never use. 
  

  
The point is I like to keep things as analog as possible. My apartment, a studio in the “up-and-coming” neighborhood, was chock full of hand-me-down furniture and decor. More than saving money I found older stuff cozier. The aesthetic was less “Here comes the future, bitch” and more grandma’s house. Charlotte was not a fan. She would never come right out and call it ugly, but the implication was there. I didn’t mind. It fits me, and that’s all that mattered.
  

  
Despite Luddite tendencies, the one technology I used all the time was my phone’s camera. I took a few photography classes in college and was bit hard by the bug. I find the media perplexing and thought-provoking. When you look at a photo, you’re presented with a world within a frame. Regardless of the artist’s intent, you are free to assume anything about the tiny fraction of the world you’re privy to. There is no wrong answer. A picture of a riderless tricycle might mean the loss of childhood innocence to a person struggling with adolescence or a reminder that kids never put away their toys to a parent.
  

  
Photos were illusions based on reality. I found that idea magical.
  

  
My shutterbug ways meant I had several hard drives and online storage spaces filled with thousands of pictures. My desire to give my little flophouse character and the affordability of printer paper meant that my apartment walls were filled with my favorite pieces. Some really startling pictures are on the walls, but more are stored on my hard drives. I hated that I never got to see them. I felt terrible because I knew I had some real gems buried in digital ground, waiting to be unearthed again. I just needed the right tool.
  

  
Enter the FotoVue digital frame. I’d known about digital frames for a while, and despite my reluctance to modern technology, those things seemed pretty impressive. Especially the FotoVue. Even with my Luddite leanings, the FotoVue was something I desired, but the price kept it a dream and not a reality.
  

  
Until I found a used one at Goodwill.
  

  
Goodwill had become my sanctuary. Since I’m on a strict budget, furnishing an apartment became a Herculean task. Some days, I swore kidnapping Cerberus was more manageable than finding an affordable table. I was stoked when I saw a flier announcing that a new Goodwill had opened just down the street from my place. An affordable store within walking distance of my home was a reason to celebrate. I told Charlotte, and we planned to visit.
  

  
The area where the Goodwill was located had previously been a burned-out shell of a decrepit warehouse. The warehouse, an OSHA nightmare manifest, caught fire a year ago. I remember coming home from work and seeing the blaze from a mile away. I could feel the intense heat on my cheeks as I passed by. I’d never seen so many firefighters in one place at once, save for a hunky firefighter calendar I bought years ago. The guys fighting this immense inferno, though, were wearing their gear and not just suggestively posing with hoses. 
  

  
The owner of the urban blight said he planned to fix it up, reopen the place, and hire a bunch of locals. Good paying jobs, he promised. He didn’t do any of that. Instead, he let the building rot like a dead squirrel on the side of the road. The building has been vacant since the blaze. Just another burned-out husk in a city with quite a few of them.
  

  
But, living up to its name, Goodwill turned this lemon of a building into lemonade. Charlotte and I arrived early and must’ve beat the rush because the place was a ghost town. There were no people except for an ancient-looking woman nosing around old paperbacks and a few scattered workers in blue vests. We preferred fewer people in the store, though. Fewer people meant we had a better chance of finding quality stuff.
  

  
I was on the lookout for anything weird or kooky to add to my décor while Charlotte was looking for unique items to resell online. Her side hustle had started as a way to clear out her father’s home after his death (he was a hoarder) but had turned into a real cash cow. Turns out she had an eye for things she could flip and a way with ad copy that made even the ugly shit she picked up move as well.
  

  
“This place is huge,” Charlotte said.
  

  
“Yeah, it used to be a warehouse for dollar store goods or something.”
  

  
“They did a good job with the rehab. You can’t tell that there was ever a fire here,” Charlotte said, looking over some glassware, “Surprising amount of decent stuff here, too.”
  

  
“We found a gem,” I said, eyeballing a hotel-quality lighthouse painting.
  

  
“If you’re talking about the store, yes. If it’s about that painting….”
  

  
I laughed and rolled my eyes. I turned to the front desk and found two things that caught my attention. One was the cute guy working behind the register. The second and far more crucial thing was a FotoVue digital frame. I grabbed Charlotte and nodded toward the FotoVue. She looked up from the Halloween-inspired glass she was inspecting and nodded in approval.
  

  
“Not bad. Vests are hard to pull off, but he’s doing it.”
  

  
“No, not him. The FotoVue!”
  

  
Charlotte and I moved over toward the glass case so I could get a better look. My jaw dropped when I clocked the price. Most of the time, people at second-hand stores generally knew how to price their goods. Typically, “high-end” electronics were among the costliest things in the store. Apparently, not everyone at this Goodwill knew the value of their luxury items. Whoever had set this price had underestimated it by a hundred bucks.
  

  
“Holy moly,” I whispered to Charlotte. “Look at the price.”
  

  
“Shit,” she said, “you’ve gotta snag that.”
  

  
“It’s still too much,” I said, peering into my purse and finding more receipts than cash.
  

  
“I will front you the money,” she said, “I know how badly you want one, and you’re never going to find one this cheap.”
  

  
“Are you sure?’ I asked.
  

  
“Hey, I’d rather front you some cash to buy something useful than you spend your own money and buy another garbage motel painting.”
  

  
I gave her a look, and she laughed. “The art on my wall speaks to me,” I said, defending my design eye.
  

  
“It speaks to me too,” Charlotte said, “It’s telling me that you deserve something better to look at.”
  

  
I laughed. “It’s not all THAT bad.”
  

  
“It is,” she said with a smirk, “but I know how many incredible photos you have wasting away. You deserve to show them off.”
  

  
I looked back down at the FotoVue and shook my head. It would look great in my apartment, Luddite leanings be damned. After a beat, I nodded and thanked Charlotte for the offer. “I really appreciate it. Things have just been so tight lately, ya know?”
  

  
“I know, but I’ve had a good month on eBay. Got you. You owe me a home-cooked meal, okay? I’m so over UberEats.”
  

  
“Done.”
  

  
Charlotte knocked on the glass and called out to the clerk, “Garcon, can we have a word?”
  

  
The cute clerk turned to us and flashed us a beautiful smile. I felt a fluttering in my chest because the warm smile caught me off guard. He was better looking up close – shaggy black hair that flopped into his face, deep, dark eyes, and full lips, complete with a small hoop pierced in the corner. I felt myself blush and almost let out a little chuckle. Charlotte noticed my reaction and rolled her eyes.
  

  
“Calm yourself,” she murmured.
  

  
“Can I help you ladies?”
  

  
“I hope so,” I said, instantly regretting it and feeling blood rush to my cheeks. Still, he was an unexpected bonus to this trip. A genuinely pleasant surprise, like finding money on the street.
  

  
“Tall order, but I’ll do my best.”
  

  
“Can we get the FotoVue?” Charlotte asked.
  

  
“Yes, you can.”
  

  
“Is that the real price?” I asked. I felt Charlotte kick me.
  

  
“Is it too much or too little?” the clerk said.
  

  
“You could probably knock off five or ten bucks,” Charlotte said. “Absurdly overpriced.”
  

  
“I can ask my manager,” the clerk said, turning around in a circle. He grinned, “Noah said it’s okay to knock off five bucks.”
  

  
“Noah?” I asked obliviously.
  

  
“That’s me. And you are?”
  

  
“Wren.”
  

  
“Like the bird? Cool,” he said, flashing that winning smile. “Well, Wren, you’re lucky because this just got dropped off this morning.”
  

  
“The witch dropped it off,” another clerk said, wedging her hefty body through the tiny opening between the glass counters.
  

  
“Ethel is a lot of things, Mona, but she’s not a witch,” Noah said. “She’s just kidding.”
  

  
“I’m not,” she countered, “If witches are real, then that lady is a witch.” She nodded towards the ancient lady we had seen looking over the paperbacks earlier. Apparently bored with the selection of Dean Koontz and Stephen Kings, she had moved on to old board games.
  

  
“Do a lot of witches play Parcheesi?” I asked.
  

  
Noah laughed, and I felt a charge shoot through my body. He had a nice laugh. This little attraction was starting to grow. I couldn’t help it – I was a sucker for pierced, dark-eyed souls. The fact that he was pleasant and funny only added to the attraction. The more I thought about it, the more tailor-made he seemed for me. There really is something for everyone at Goodwill.
  

  
“Why do you say she’s a witch?” Charlotte asked.
  

  
“She’s bored,” Noah said, “When she’s bored, she makes up backstories for customers.”
  

  
“That’s true,” Mona said, “But in this case, it’s not a story. I know a few people who know all about Ethel. They’ve seen her doing strange things all around town. It all points to one thing: she’s a witch.”
  

  
“Strange things? That’s all you have? Nothing specific?”
  

  
“How about her casting spells, dancing in the woods, all that kind of witchy stuff,” Mona said, “I think I even saw her with a black cat, too.”
  

  
“Dancing in the woods? Ethel? She’s seventy-five.”
  

  
“That’s what she wants you to think,” Mona said. “She’s probably an ancient menace.”
  

  
“That gives things away at Goodwill?”
  

  
“If you can understand the devil, you’re probably a devil yourself, Noah.”
  

  
“I would hope the devil wouldn’t have to hold down a nine-to-five job.”
  

  
“Like jello, he moves in mysterious ways.”
  

  
Charlotte and I laughed. Mona had a point. Noah looked back at us and rolled his eyes.
  

  
“What’s the story you made up about us?” Charlotte asked Mona.
  

  
Mona turned and took Charlotte and me in before nodding. “You want me to say lesbians out for a jaunty time, but that would be easy.”
  

  
“I don’t think I’ve ever had a jaunty time. Wren? You ever jaunted?”
  

  
“Not to my knowledge, no.”
  

  
“Exactly,” Mona said, “I’m going to say that you two are treasure hunters who have come into the Goodwill to find an elusive and dangerous totem that, in the wrong hands, could lead to your death.”
  

  
“That’s so much more exciting than just looking for things to sell on eBay,” Charlotte said.
  

  
Noah shook his head, “When I first started, she told me I was an ancient druid in search of a perfect robe.”
  

  
We all laughed. Mona ate it up. This was a fun group. I turned to the budding author and asked, “Do you read a lot of thrillers? Because these all sound like the plots of a good airport read.”
  

  
Mona winked, “Maybe I write airport reads.”
  

  
“She doesn’t,” Noah said. “She has a wall of books that she reads and steals ideas from when she should be pricing jeans.”
  

  
Mona sighed, “Don’t speak ill of the creative process, Noah. Inspiration comes from everywhere.”
  

  
“Here, here,” Charlotte said, slapping hands with her.
  

  
“That may be true, but I told Lou we’d have these jeans priced before he gets in. Don’t make me out to be a liar, huh?”
  

  
“Fine,” Mona said before giving us a bow. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to waste my god-given talent for crafting stories and go sort through a bunch of old jeans.”
  

  
Mona grabbed a pricing gun and squeezed back through the counter and off to the back to tackle the piles of used pants. As soon as she was gone, we all started laughing.
  

  
“She’s something else,” I said.
  

  
“She makes working here an adventure, that’s for sure.”
  

  
“So, Noah, how about we get that FotoVue out.”
  

  
“Oh, yes. Of course,” Noah said, unlocking the glass counters and handing me the box. “You have a lot of photos to display?”
  

  
“You have no idea,” Charlotte said, “She’s an amazing photographer.”
  

  
“Amateur photographer,” I corrected.
  

  
“Don’t sell yourself short. You have a gift.”
  

  
“I took a photography class at the learning annex last month,” Noah said, “I’d love to see some of your work. Pick up some inspiration.”
  

  
“It’s not as good as Charlotte is making it out to be.”
  

  
“Better than mine, which are mostly just close-ups of flowers or insects. Real ‘baby found a camera’ stuff.”
  

  
I laughed. “We all go through that phase. I’m sure they’re wonderful.”
  

  
“You haven’t seen my work yet.”
  

  
“I bet she’d like to see some of it,” Charlotte said, giving me a shove into setting up a date, “she really does have a good eye. She gives great advice. She’s made my business Insta account sparkle. How about it, Noah?”
  

  
His face flushed red. “Uh, I mean, yeah, I’m open to it. If, if you are, of course.”
  

  
“I am,” I said. “Give me your number, and we can set a time to grab some coffee and discuss some photos.”
  

  
“Awesome,” he said. I handed him my phone, and he entered his name and number before sliding it back. “I still have to charge for the Fotovue, though.”
  

  
“Strike one,” Charlotte joked.
  

  
I looked at the phone. For his name, he wrote, “Noah, Goodwill (does not have dangerous totem).” I laughed. “Nice name.”
  

  
“Just wanted to make sure you remembered I don’t deal in dangerous items,” he said before adding, “except maybe those lawn darts.”
  

  
I laughed. “Just to be safe, keep the lawn darts at the store.” 
  

  
Noah completed the transaction and carefully wrapped the digital frame before handing it over. “I hope it’s a good home for your memories,” he said with a nod, “I hope I hear from you soon.”
  

  
“I think you will,” I said.
  

  
“If the witch lady brings any old Gameboy games, give Wren a call, huh?” Charlotte added.
  

  
“She does mention Tetris a lot, so there’s a chance we’ll be in touch,” Noah said with a slight chuckle.
  

  
When we finally left the Goodwill, I was on cloud nine. Charlotte gave me some grief, but she was also happy for me. The moment she saw Noah, she knew I would swoon over him. She knew my type. The fact that he was kind of a dork pushed her into action.
  

  
“You owe me,” she said on the car ride back to my apartment. “I made that happen.”
  

  
“Maybe the witch put an enchantment spell on the FotoVue. We only clicked because of magic.”
  

  
“The old bat with a pointy hat had nothing to do with it,” Charlotte said.
  

  
“Seriously, thank you so much for the FotoVue.”
  

  
“Stop thanking me. It was my pleasure. I expect to see that bad boy filled with lost classic photos when I come over for dinner.”
  

  
“That much I can promise. I’m going to load it up as soon as I get home.”
  

  
I dropped her off outside her apartment and headed home. When I arrived, I started loading photos into the FotoVue. It took some finagling, but I was impressed once I got it going. Like archaeologists finding undisturbed ruins, a world of wonders came to me. Photos I had forgotten about were getting their proper due. Memories of moments past came flooding to the forefront of my brain. Seeing Charlotte and I at different ages, maturing into the people we are now. I was thrilled.
  

  
I snapped a quick picture of the frame and shot it over to Charlotte. After a few, she sent back a text reading, “Looks good. Though, I can’t help the irony of taking such a poor-quality photo to show me how you display high-quality photos.” I texted back, telling her to shut up with a winky face emoji before crawling into bed. Minutes later, I drifted off to a deep sleep.
  

  
I woke up before the sun the following day. I hadn’t planned on it, but a night of tossing and turning morphed into an early day. Though I couldn’t remember the details, I knew I had a run of horrible dreams. I woke up several times during the night for reasons I couldn’t recall.
  

  
I made myself a cup of coffee and tried to fight off the early morning stupor when a photo flashed on the FotoVue I didn’t recognize. Well, I did recognize what was in the photo, but I didn’t remember taking it. 
  
It was the front door of my apartment.
  

  
I glanced at the timestamp in the corner of the photo. It was taken last night at around two in the morning. That didn’t make sense. I was asleep. Even if some stranger snapped this picture, getting it on my FotoVue would be almost impossible. They’d have to know the web page I used to store my photos, my sign-in information, and where I kept the FotoVue files. I was the only one who knew all that.
  

  
Yet, here was an unwelcome present from a stranger staring me in the face. I grabbed my phone and opened the drive where I kept anything to see if anything had been uploaded last night. There was nothing. I searched for the photo itself and, again, found nothing.
  

  
“What in the world?” I mumbled.
  

  
The picture on the FotoVue changed, and there was another photo I hadn’t taken on the screen. This one was inside my apartment, about a foot from where I stood. I felt a creeping coldness climb my body. Had someone come into my place last night?
  

  
I looked back at the door, and it was still locked. I ran to the one window in my apartment, which was also closed and locked. “Okay, what the hell?” I said, feeling goosebumps rise on my arms.
  

  
I live in a studio space, a classy title covering up the sad truth that my house was one big room with an adjoining bathroom. That said, I’ve done my best to create different “rooms” in the space. The corner where my bed is, for example, is surrounded by bookshelves that function as walls. I placed a curtain rod between two shelves and gave myself a “door” of billowy curtain. While these improvements helped break up the space, if someone came in, they’d easily find me. I’d only be able to head to the bathroom where there was no outside access.
  

  
I’d be trapped.
  

  
The FotoVue screen changed again, and my heart started thumping like a bass drum. It was a photo of me sleeping in my bed. I gasped and in my sudden fright, I knocked my coffee mug off the counter. It shattered on the floor, sending a razor-sharp fragment rocketing into my leg, slicing it open.
  

  
“Shit,” I said, looking down at my bloody leg. I dodged the shards of broken mug and fetched a paper towel to help stanch the flow.
  

  
As I pressed Bounty to my skin and watched my blood soak in, the picture changed again. This time, it was on the whiteboard I had in my bathroom. My notes had been erased, and a message had been scrawled in handwriting I didn’t recognize. It read, “I see you when you’re sleeping.”
  

  
I ran to my bathroom and ripped open the door. Sure enough, the message was still there. My head went fuzzy. I felt my skin crawl and knew I had to leave there immediately. I grabbed my things and dashed out the door.
  

  
Naturally, I ended up at Charlotte’s place and spilled my guts. She could tell I was rattled – I was still wearing my pajamas, for God’s sake – and said we should call the cops. I agreed. About an hour later, we decided to meet them at my place.
  

  
I don’t know what I was expecting, but there wasn’t much the police could do. They took a report and told me to keep my doors locked. Absent any evidence, their hands were tied. I asked if they were going to fingerprint anything and they said if nothing was stolen, they wouldn’t bother. They told me to be smart and stay safe before they left.
  

  
“Well, at least they have a record of it now,” Charlotte said, trying to find a silver lining.
  

  
“My doors and windows were locked. There was no way anyone could get in here.”
  

  
“No one else has keys?”
  

  
I shook my head no. “What’s really confusing me is where the hell these pictures came from. They’re not in my drive.”
  

  
“Yeah, that’s Unsolved Mysteries weird.”
  

  
“Can I stay with you tonight?”
  

  
“Of course,” Charlotte said, “I was planning on it.”
  

  
I packed a bag for an overnight stay (or two). When I went into my bathroom to grab my toothbrush, I noticed a new message on the whiteboard. In the same handwriting as before, it now read, “We’re not strangers.”
  

  
I walked back out of the bathroom in a hurry. “You didn’t notice any of the cops going into the bathroom, did you?”
  

  
“No, why?”
  

  
“Someone was in here again,” I said, trembling, “there is a new message on the whiteboard.”
  

  
“What?”
  

  
“It says, ‘We’re not strangers’.”
  

  
“What the fuck does that mean?”
  

  
“I dunno,” I said, feeling the bad vibes glom onto me, “but I want to get out of here.”
  

  
“Agreed, but lemme do something first,” Charlotte said, opening my tiny pantry door. She grabbed a flour sack and sprinkled a bunch on the kitchen floor near where I kept the FotoVue.
  

  
“What are you doing?”
  

  
“If anyone comes at night, they won’t see the flour and they’ll leave footprints. Maybe then the cops can do something. If nothing else, we’ll know if they come back.”
  

  
“Always thinking,” I said. “Why I love you.”
  

  
“I know,” Charlotte said.
  

  
We hustled out of the apartment, and I was sure to lock it behind me. We went down to the street and saw a familiar face walking past. Noah. “What are you doing here?” I said.
  

  
He pulled out an airpod from his ear, “Whoa, hey. How are you doing?”
  

  
“How do you know where I live?” I asked, those bad vibes returning.
  

  
“You live here?”
  

  
“Maybe,” Charlotte said. “Why are you here?”
  

  
“I was meeting a friend for lunch at the Vietnamese place down here,” he said, confused at the serious looks on our faces. “Did I do something wrong or…?”
  

  
“No,” I said, “Just had a weird night.”
  

  
“You okay?”
  

  
“Yeah, just a little freaked out.”
  

  
“Do you need anything? Can I help?”
  

  
“No, no,” I said.
  

  
“What’s the name of the restaurant?” Charlotte asked.
  

  
“What?”
  

  
“The restaurant you’re going to meet your friend at.”
  

  
“Uh, Pho Connection, I think. Something like that. Any good?”
  

  
“Never been,” Charlotte said. “We don’t want to make you late for your meeting.”
  

  
“Oh, well, I hope your day gets better. Look forward to getting that coffee.”
  

  
“Yeah,” I said, my face not as chipper as before. Noah’s eyes looked crestfallen, but he held it together.
  

  
“Have a better day, huh?”
  

  
We parted ways. As soon as Noah was out of earshot, Charlotte shook her head. “He’s lying. There isn’t any restaurant named Pho Connection near here.”
  

  
“Are you sure?”
  

  
Charlotte pulled out her phone and checked. Sure enough, no Pho Connection. I felt my stomach flip. “Maybe he got the name wrong?”
  

  
“I dunno, but he seems sketchy as hell.”
  

  
“You think he broke into my house?”
  

  
She didn’t answer which was an answer. We left. As we did, I looked over my shoulder to ensure we weren’t being followed. No one tailed us. For the moment, we were safe and secure.
  

  
That night, Charlotte and I ordered pizza and watched movies. She lived in a more upscale part of town, and the security showed. Cameras everywhere, alarm systems in place, and her building had a doorman. If someone tried to come get me, they’d have to get through several layers of safety to do so. Still, we double and triple-checked the locks on all the windows and doors before we called it an evening. Being the incredible friend she was, she let me sleep in her bed and took the couch.
  

  
Despite the terrifying incident from the previous night, I felt calm as I went to bed. I felt confident nothing could get in. Even if it was Noah, he had no idea where Charlotte lived. After some mindless scrolling, I finally felt my eyelids get heavy and fell asleep.
  

  
Charlotte’s yelling is what woke me up.
  

  
I ran into her living room to see her standing and staring at something in her kitchen. Her face still had sleep creases, but she was wide awake now. I ran to her side, and she grabbed me tight. “What’s wrong?” I said, adrenaline coursing through my veins.
  

  
“There’s something in the kitchen.”
  

  
“What?”
  

  
“I was dead asleep and heard something fall in the kitchen. When I woke up, I swear I saw a person’s shadow on the wall.”
  

  
“Did you see anyone?”
  

  
“No, but...but I had a dream someone was standing over me.”
  

  
“What were they doing? Did they say anything?”
  

  
“I just heard a camera click.”
  

  
I felt my stomach drop. I moved away from Charlotte and headed towards her kitchen. She tried to stop me, but I brushed her off. When I got around the kitchen bar, I saw a USB stick lying in the middle of the floor. I went over and picked it up.
  

  
“What the fuck?” Charlotte said, confused.
  

  
“Should we plug it into your computer?”
  

  
Charlotte sighed. “I’m going to hate this, aren’t I?” she said as she pulled out her laptop.
  

  
I handed her the USB and sat next to her on the couch. She placed it into the computer and found several photos inside. “Here we go,” she said as she clicked on the first.
  

  
It was a picture of the front door of my apartment. The timestamp indicated it was from tonight. The person who took the photo cast a shadow on the door, but we couldn’t make out any details.
  

  
“Doesn’t look like Noah,” I said.
  

  
She clicked on the next photo. It was the inside of my apartment. Again, it was from tonight. Again, the shadow of someone we couldn’t see. The third was a photo of my bed. Someone had violently thrown off all my pillows and sheets. Pictures I had on the walls around me were torn off and ripped in half. “That seems like an escalation,” I whispered.
  

  
Another photo. My bathroom. Trashed. All of my things were ripped out of the drawers and thrown around. The whiteboard read, “You can’t hide. I always find them.”
  

  
“Sweet Lord,” I said, my voice tightening like a vice.
  

  
“You can’t stay there...like ever,” Charlotte said.
  

  
We clicked on the next photo, and our skin started crawling. This was a photo of Charlotte’s front door. 
  

  
“What the…” I said.
  

  
“Fuck,” Charlotte finished. She clicked again, and it was a close-up of Charlotte sleeping on the couch. Tears filled her eyes. Mine, too. “What the fuck is going on?”
  

  
“I’m so sorry I brought this to you,” I said, putting my hand on her shoulder.
  

  
“Shut the fuck up,” she snapped, “You didn’t do shit. Some evil fucker is messing with us. We’re in this together, okay?”
  

  
“Okay,” I said.
  

  
“Sorry, I snapped.”
  

  
“It’s fine. We’re in this together.”
  

  
“Goddamn right,” Charlotte said. She clicked again, and our hearts dropped. It was of us sitting together on the couch, looking at the computer at that very moment. Charlotte popped up like a spring and snapped towards where the photo had been taken. There wasn’t a soul there.
  

  
“How the hell did that get on there?”
  

  
“This is some Voo Doo, shit, dude,” Charlotte said.
  

  
There was a hard knock on her door, and we both let out a yelp. Charlotte grabbed a butcher knife and approached the front door. She was terrified, but a firm resolve was hardening her. It filled me with confidence. I grabbed another knife and joined her at her side.
  

  
“I didn’t see anything through the peephole.”
  

  
“Should we even bother opening it then?”
  

  
“We have knives.”
  

  
Logically, it didn’t make sense. If this thing could move through walls and snap photos of us sleeping or sitting on the couch without us knowing, what good would a knife do? But at that moment, Charlotte was making sense. I tightened my grip.
  

  
She quietly undid the chain lock, opened the deadbolt, and placed her hand on the knob. She slowly turned it and pulled the door open. She screamed, and I was ready to stab whatever was waiting there, but I dropped my knife in disbelief.
  

  
It was the FotoVue.
  

  
“How?” was all I was able to spit out.
  

  
Charlotte grabbed it, slammed the door shut and locked it tight. The FotoVue screen instantly popped on and started displaying photos. It wasn’t even plugged in.
  

  
The first photo was Charlotte and I while we were shopping at the Goodwill. I felt my blood boil. Noah had to be doing this. Who else could it be?
  

  
“Was he stalking us? How long has this been going on?”
  

  
“I’m going to hack his dick off,” Charlotte said, still holding the knife.
  

  
The photo changed, and my anger subsided some. It was a photo of Noah and I chatting when I purchased the FotoVue. Someone else must’ve taken the photograph. 
  

  
Next up was Charlotte and I leaving Goodwill, heading towards her car. It looked like someone had snapped this photo while hiding in the bushes. But there was something else off about the picture. In the left corner, you could see a reflection of something in the store’s glass. In a quick glance, you’d never see it, but once your eyes caught the shape, it was hard not to see.
  

  
“Is that a face?” Charlotte asked.
  

  
“That’s...not human.”
  

  
Before we could stare longer, the picture changed again. It was my whiteboard from home. In that same scraggly writing as before, it read, “Get ready for a surprise.”
  

  
The picture changed. It was Charlotte and I staring at the FotoVue in her apartment. There was a large shadow cast on the wall behind us. It was huge. It also wasn’t human.
  

  
As I turned around, the apartment lights snapped off, and I felt something slimy touch my shoulder. I screamed and swung my knife and hit something. The lights flickered back on, and I saw Charlotte holding her arm. A large gash had been cut across it. I dropped the knife, and it clattered on the floor.
  

  
“Jesus, Char, I’m sorry! Here, here, let me get something,” I scrambled for a towel to wrap her arm. “It touched me,” I said, panic turning me manic, “I...I swung out of instinct.”
  

  
“Did it speak to you?”
  

  
“What?” I said, handing a towel to Charlotte.
  

  
“It spoke to me,” she said, shock starting to outmaneuver adrenaline.
  

  
“What did it say?”
  

  
“It said,” she paused, allowing her brain to process, “it said it wants our souls.”
  
My eyes welled up, “I...I don’t even know what to do or who to trust or anything.”

“This started when we got the FotoVue at Goodwill.”

“I don’t think it’s Noah.”
 
“What was the name of the other lady we talked to? The one who said we were lesbians. Mavis? Marge?”
 
“Mona,” I said.
 
“Mona! It has to be Mona.”
 
“Okay,” I said, “Let’s say Mona is behind this. What does that make Mona? A ghost? A demon? A witch?”
  
“She’s about to be a dead bitch,” Charlotte said. “Get dressed, we’re going to Goodwill.”
 
Fifteen minutes later, we pulled in front of the Goodwill. Or, rather, what had been the Goodwill. Instead of seeing the building we had shopped at a few days earlier, there was nothing but the old, burnt-out husk of the warehouse. We both got out of the car in a daze. We had been inside the building a few days earlier. I had bought something here. I had met Noah here.

Now, here didn’t even exist.
 
“The fuck is going on?” Charlotte said, taking the words right out of my mouth. “Where is everything?”
 
“It’s... it’s gone,” I said, walking through the burned-out front doors. Inside the building, dozens of pigeons fluttered in the rafters of the burn-scorched roof. The walls were charred and stained with black smoke residue or crude graffiti. The floor was cracked, broken, and filled with trash that blew in the wind. Sun peaked through a few holes in the roof and created shafts of light all around me.
  
As I took in the rubble, a piece of paper drifted from the rafters. I snagged it as it passed. It was blank, white paper. 

“What is it?” she asked.
  
I held up the paper, and an image started to bleed through. It was like some sort of magic ink had been activated by my hands. It was a picture of Charlotte and I standing in the warehouse. Under the photo in that deranged handwriting were the words, “Look behind you.”
  
As soon as my brain processed the words, I felt a presence behind me. I could feel hot breath on my neck. The stench of roadkill roasting in the noon sun flooded all around us. A hoof beat down on the concrete behind us and echoed around the cavernous warehouse.
 
I dropped the paper and glanced over at Charlotte. She was terrified and didn’t move a muscle. I should’ve been petrified, but a rising wave of anger flowed through my body. This thing had put us through so much, and I had had enough. I turned on my heels and was face to face with….Noah.
 
“The fuck?”
  
“I thought you liked me?” he asked.
 
“What even are you?”
 
Noah’s pleasant smile morphed into a too-wide Cheshire cat grin. The white of his eyes filled in with an inky blackness. His voice dropped several registers, and he spoke with a flat intonation that inspired menace in my heart. “I’m everything and nothing. I am the inescapable doom. The creeping blackness of night. The one who devours souls. I have been feared since before man and will until the light of the world dissolves.”
  
“What do you want?”
  
“Your soul,” he said before his jaw unhinged and flipped back on his head. His mouth kept opening until his body turned inside out. His vital organs and intestines slapped onto the ground with a wet smack as maniacal laughing filled the warehouse.
 
I screamed and turned away in horror. I stepped to run but slipped on the viscera that had pooled around my feet and fell to the ground. Charlotte was stone still, except for her trembling hands. The trauma had paralyzed her. I wanted to call out, but the words died in my throat when I tried. I was so afraid my voice went silent.
 
“No use in fighting,” a garbled voice called out from the sloppy pile of guts. I looked away from Charlotte, and when I looked back up, I didn’t see a revolting inside-out mess of guts and blood. I saw Mona. She smiled and shot a finger gun at me.
 
“Can I tell a story or what?”
   
“Wh-what?” I said, my voice finally breaking through.

“Don’t like this form? What about this one?” she said before grabbing a hold of her shoulders and ripping her body in half. Inside was the gore-covered body of Ethel, the old woman Mona called a witch. I realized at that moment this wasn’t one person. This creature was nothing more than a nightmarish nesting toy. A Matryoshka doll of doom.

“H-how are you doing this?”

“Your kind only sees the truth they want to see,” Ethel said in her deepening tone. “Illusions based in reality.”

“What are you?”

Ethel laughed. “I am whatever you want to see, girl. Do you not find this form pleasing? If not, I have one more to show you, but I guarantee you won’t recover from witnessing my true form,” the old cackled.
 
“Are...are you the devil?”
 
The old woman smiled. Before she could respond, I saw Charlotte’s spell break. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small crucifix. She snapped around, and screamed, “Fuck you!” She pressed the cross into the woman’s forehead. It sizzled when it came in contact with her skin, and the woman let out a roar that rattled the building.
  
She reached down to me and offered me a hand. “Let’s fucking get out of here.”
 
I grabbed her hand, and she damn near yanked me to my feet. We both ran past the creature as it hollered in pain. Its form changed from Noah to Mona to Ethel and to scores of other people we’d never seen before. We didn’t stick around to what it finally settled on.
  
As we got to the car, I spied the FotoVue. I ripped open the door and pulled out the digital frame. Mona had said we’d buy a cursed object, and she – or whatever she truly was – hadn’t been lying. I needed to break the curse. As much as it pained me, I slammed it down on the ground, shattering it to pieces. Charlotte fired up the car and screamed at me to get in.
 
I did, and we rocketed off as soon as the door closed. We didn’t slow down until we were miles away. When we shut the car off, we both started sobbing and hugged each other so tight we could’ve turned coal into a diamond. No words were exchanged. None were needed.
  
After we broke our embrace, I finally asked, “Where did you get the crucifix from? Aren’t you an atheist?”
  
“My mom,” she said, “she put it in my car when I first bought it, and I never removed it. I hated it but felt guilty throwing it away, so I kept it. When we pulled up and saw the Goodwill was gone, I thought it might not hurt to have it on me.”
  
I laughed, and she joined in. We cackled together in her car, parked at some random gas station in the middle of nowhere. If anyone would’ve seen us, they would’ve thought we were high. If we told the reason why we were laughing, they’d think we were insane.
  
Hours later, we made our way back to her place. We didn’t know if this thing had been defeated, but we made a plan regardless. The first was to reach out to the church to see if there was something they could do. This was a long shot, but it seemed like the only option based on what we had seen. We also contacted someone to “cleanse” our apartments. It seemed like mumbo-jumbo, but I went with it.
   
Since I had destroyed the FotoVue, I hoped I had severed the link between myself and the demon. I stayed with Charlotte for several more days until things returned to normal. I told her I was ready to try going back to my place. She said I could stay longer if I wanted, but I had always heeded the advice of Ben Franklin that guests, like fish, started to smell after three days.
   
My apartment was weirdly still when I entered. Most everything was where it should have been except for the photos that had decorated my walls. Like the USB pictures had shown us, they had been ripped off the walls and torn into pieces. I saw little Wren and Charlotte heads populating the floors everywhere I looked.
    
The other thing that remained was the flour Charlotte poured on my kitchen floor. However, this, too, had changed. Something had walked through the pile. Something with cloven hooves. The flour’s residue trailed all around my apartment: my bathroom, my couch, my bed. 
    
My ceiling. 
    
“Are those footprints old or new?” Charlotte asked when she saw them. The question buzzed in my head. Did these come when the creature had come looking for me the previous night, or had they come since we fled Goodwill? I didn’t know, and that fact chilled me.
  
“I’m telling myself they’re old,” I said, feeling tears well in my eyes. “They have to be old. They have to be before we stopped that thing because if they’re not....”
   
“Then they’re old,” Charlotte interrupted. I looked into her eyes, and she gave me a reassuring smile and patted my back. “They’re old, Wren.”
  
“What if they’re not?” I said, my voice quivering.
  
“Then we find another cross and cram it up the devil’s ass.”
 
I laughed. Charlotte always had a way with words.
