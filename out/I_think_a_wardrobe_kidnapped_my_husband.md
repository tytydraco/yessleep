Things have been a little rough for us lately.

But I was hoping that us moving into a new house would help. I think my husband Dan shared that belief. I knew he was struggling, but I thought things were turning around for him.

He went missing last week and I’m not sure what to do. I know I should go to the police, but I just think he got involved with something he shouldn’t have. He was making money very quickly over the past month, and it really freed us from some stress.

I feel really terrible. Right now all I have to go off is his journal. I got him one of those Moleskin ones for Christmas and he started using it when we moved.

**February 2**

*Today was a long and tiring day. Me Sarah Alex and Emily moved into the new house off Oakland ave It's not what Sarah and I imagined but it’s a start. We've been struggling more than I’d care to admit recently.  I was laid off again. Terrible timing sense we just bought a damn house. Three times in two years I imagined life differently. I wish I went to college maybe I would have done more for the family. I hope Sarah loves me as much as she use to*

**February 5**

*Sarah is picking up extra shifts at the hospital. Shes amazing. Alex and Emily are doing well in school which makes us feel like great parents. They apparently are even using Apple laptops in some of the classes. I thought we were cool in high school when we got to go to the computer lab and sit at a desktop for an hour and learn to type. Anyway, I dropped off applications at all of the dealerships service departments. For the rest of the week I want to fix up this place and make it feel more like a home for us*

**February 6**

*I touched up the paint and put new handles on the kitchen cabinets. I spent the rest of the morning working on the dryer in the garage. Were making it a makeshift laundry room until we decide what to do. The drum is making crazy noise when we run it with a full load of wet clothes. I think it needs a new belt. I also need to find a place to store some of my old tools since Alex is always practicing juggling his soccer ball in the garage. I know he does it even though I tell him not to. Last thing I want him to do is knock something over and get a major cut from a saw blade*

**February 11**

*I’ve gotten sidetracked by something I found in the basement. An old wardrobe. It’s crazy, I don’t remember seeing it when we toured the house. It’s old and damp. It does something. I don’t know. I can’t explain. I made little hooks for my tools and hung them up. Then I left the drill on the baseboard of the wardrobe. It’s an old, crappy drill but has always done the job for me. Well I went to get my drill today to work on the dryer again and it wasn’t there. A super expensive drill with all sorts of nice drill bits and accessories was sitting there. The thing must cost four or five hundred bucks. I never seen anything like this. I am going to try something tomorrow when Sarah goes to work*

**February 12**

*I can’t believe it! I put three dollar bills into the wardrobe. An hour later, I checked. There was a $100 bill in there place. I’m going to the bank tomorrow to get more money. I think I can fix our problems. Also Miller Brothers called about a position but I told them I’d call them back*

**February 16**

*Luck has finally rolled my way! I took the family out to a nice dinner tonight at Red Lobster. I don’t think finances will be causing us issues anymore. I’ve made $4,000 with the wardrobe. I am gonna get more expensive things to put in it*

**February 22**

*Sarah is wondering if I’m doing illegal stuff. I didn’t know how to respond. Not because I’m hiding anything, but because I don’t know if it’s illegal. I guess I am hiding something the more I think about it. I told her I won the lottery. $50,000. She hugged and kissed me. It made me feel succesful. We talked about moving to somewhere nice but I know that’s not a good idea. I don’t want to move the wardrobe. I also figured it’s best to not draw too much attention to us right now*

**February 24**

*Things are going great still at home. Well for the most part. Something has been on my mind lately. But I’m not sure what to do. The kids are healthy and in school. Sarah is doing great and has been able to cut down on picking up shifts. I have stacks of money put away for rainy days and all our bills. I’d like to put myself in the wardrobe and see what happens. I don't know how to explain it but I feel like I have to. Like the wardrobe is whispering to me*

**March 5**

*I went ahead and climbed into the wardrobe.*

*I knew it had unknown risks but was too curious about the prospects. I felt an incredible tingling rush through my body when I closed the door behind me. I allowed myself to stay in it for just a few minutes. I already feel different, sharper. I don’t know how to describe it.*

*When I stepped out of the wardrobe, I was greeted with a world that seemed both familiar and yet completely foreign to me. The colors were brighter, the smells more pungent, and the sounds more vivid. My mind was ablaze with new thoughts and ideas, and I saw the world in a way that I never had before.*

*Suddenly, everything made sense. As I looked out at the world, I realized that so much of what I had once thought important was now trivial. The things that had once consumed my thoughts and feelings were now mere distractions from the greater questions that the universe posed.*

*I know that I have a role to play and that my journey is only just beginning. But first, I need to make sure that Sarah, Alex, and Emily are set up with more permanence.*

**March 7**

*I went to look at a strip mall to potentially purchase.*

*It has six commercial occupants, a few of them doing impressive numbers. Around $500/sq ft. The entire lot is valued quite richly, but we're quite liquid at the moment and need to become the opposite. It’s a cliche for someone in our shoes, but I’ve undoubtedly realized Sarah and I need to prepare ourselves to launder this money I'm generating. The strip mall was about an hour North.*

*On my drive up, I noticed a pain in my head. It was a sharp, stabbing pain that turned into a deep, dull ache... It was cold, almost feeling like there was ice suddenly inside of me. I subsequently noticed a sudden hunger to return to the wardrobe. It was unsettling.*

*But I continued on my way.*

*While I was walking around with the realtor, touring the area, I noticed the pain growing. I think it gets intenser the further away I get from the wardrobe. I wonder... No, I have this innate feeling I need to go back to it for longer. I’m missing a piece of the puzzle. Tomorrow... I'm going to figure out what's going on with this mysterious object I've found myself intertwined with.*

You guys are all caught up now.

I know I’m going to sound crazy, but one piece of all of this has just left me beyond confused. I went to the local county assessor's office this morning and asked them about the house. They pulled out the blueprints and explained to me that while our house once had a basement, it was closed off and filled in 30 years ago after a chemical spill.

I’ve been telling Alex and Emily that dad’s away for a job interview. I told my parents the same thing. I just don’t know what to do. I'm so worried about Dan.
