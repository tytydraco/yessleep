I've been taking surveys as a side gig for the better part of two years. I needed the extra cash. While getting paid to do surveys wouldn't make me six figures and certainly wouldn't be enough to pay my monthly rent, it was another way to supplement my income. If you're thinking this must be fake, it isn't. I've made real money deposited into my bank. On average, it’s a couple of dollars a day, and at best, about 50 dollars a month. The amount varies depending on the survey site; some pay only pennies, while others pay a dollar or more.

For the most part, the surveys are straightforward. You answer questions on a broad range of topics, enter your demographic information, and the survey host decides if you qualify. It's frustrating because you miss out on high-paying surveys. It really can be hit or miss. I've been tempted to change some of my answers during the pre-screening, but the websites catch on quickly. So, I end up qualifying for less than one percent of the surveys I take.

I actually quit the whole survey-taking gig a few weeks ago. It was one single survey that made me question my entire moral system and what I might be capable of. Though that’s not the only reason, it's the main reason I'll never take another survey again. I honestly never believed such a survey existed. How do I even explain it? The questions didn’t ask how much TV you watch in a week or how you feel about different brands. No, these questions wanted to know if you’d commit literal crimes or just really messed-up things that, in good conscience, you would never do. But I took it anyway. I’ll have to take you back in time to the day my whole life turned upside down.

It was an average Saturday afternoon. I had just gotten back from my daily bike ride around the park near my apartment complex. I figured I’d wind down with some music and take a couple of surveys to continue my weekly streak and get a five-dollar bonus. After hours of not getting past the pre-screening, I was ready to call it quits. Then, I noticed a survey that had an unusually high payout. I gasped out loud and nearly cursed to see that it would pay five hundred dollars for fifteen minutes worth of questions. It sounded too good to be true, but I needed the cash, so I clicked the button to take the survey and was immediately redirected to an entirely new website. The site didn’t look like a normal survey host website. It looked like something from the dark web. My entire screen was black except for a skull vector logo loading in the center. I tried to exit by clicking the escape key, but no matter how many times I pressed it, the windows start menu wouldn’t show.

I couldn’t even locate the cursor. The page took up the entire screen, and all I could do was wait. A few moments later, my screen started to glitch, and rows of ones and zeros scrolled across the screen, followed by a welcome message. It read as follows:

"Hello user, thank you for taking part in our survey. This survey is being conducted as part of a psychological experiment to determine how morally sound you are depending on how you respond to the following questions. It should take about fifteen minutes to complete. Upon completion, you will be rewarded a hefty amount of five hundred dollars."

I scratched my head, wondering what kind of survey would offer this much money and what sort of answers would need to be given. I’ve run into countless hosts that screen you out in the middle of a survey. In retrospect, I wish I would’ve been kicked out. I wish I hadn’t given all the right answers. But most of all, I wish I had never clicked on the offer in the first place. But I was desperate and almost believed I’d get even bigger offers. I’d be willing to do anything to get the money. Anything.

Just as I finished reading the message, my screen went blank. A few seconds later, random letters scrambled together to form the next message. It read as follows:

"Before you can proceed, we would like to quickly inform you that this is not your everyday, run-of-the-mill survey. The reason we are offering so much money is because our team of professionals wants to put you to the ultimate test to see how far you are willing to go for this monetary reward, and we know that even the most straight-laced person can’t resist a thick wad of cash. In a few moments, a 'next' button will appear at the bottom right of your screen. Click on it when you are ready to begin. Good luck."

The message disintegrated from the screen, and a 'next' arrow appeared. I hesitated. I still wasn’t sure what I was getting myself into. That last message spooked me. What did it mean by 'not your run-of-the-mill survey'? But before I could press anything, my cursor started flashing rapidly on the screen and began hovering above the arrow as though it was waiting for me to click it. So I did. The screen started glitching like crazy. There was static feedback and a horrible white noise that was so loud my ears could have erupted. Then it stopped. The screen went black again. For several minutes, nothing happened. I thought my computer was broken. I couldn’t get it to exit this creepy website.

After some long, arduous moments, a bunch of random letters formed the first question. It read as follows:

"Would you give your dog a plate of fresh, ripe sliced avocados?"

What the hell? I read the question a few more times, thinking there was no way someone would unironically make up such an absurd question. I began to think some edgy basement-dwelling twelve-year-old made up this survey to troll people. It was plausible. But the idea of giving my dog avocados (how did it know I had a dog to begin with?) sent shivers down my spine. Avocado is one of the foods you shouldn’t give to your dog as it causes death. Alarm bells were going off. The voice inside my head told me I needed to get off this site. But the question disappeared and was replaced by a yes or no option.

I was obviously going to choose no. My dog was my best friend. My only friend, for that matter. The cursor appeared, but just as I was about to select the no option, it pressed the yes option for me.

Okay...that’s never happened before. Was my computer being controlled? I couldn’t move the cursor away. It was stuck, like there was some kind of glitch. I was afraid I’d get a virus. I probably already had one, as I’ve risked getting on survey websites that could steal my information. So getting a virus was definitely plausible.

I sat there stunned, my mouth wide open. I took a moment to compose myself. At least there would be a chance of cashing in the five hundred dollars.

What happened next was indescribable. A large plate of sliced avocados materialized right in front of me, almost as if it had teleported from another dimension. There was no technology on earth that could make objects appear in random places. Unless the government was hiding secrets. But who was behind this? Maybe it wasn’t a twelve-year-old after all.

I looked back up at the screen. There was another message that read as follows:

"If you chose yes, grab the plate of avocados and feed the entire plate to your dog. When finished, click on the next arrow. If you fail, we will send someone to do it for you."

This had to be a nightmare. There was no way any of this was real. I tried to rub my eyes, pinch myself, and slap myself hard across the face. But the plate was there, as real as anything else in that moment.

I pulled out my earbuds and slowly arose from my gaming chair. I took the plate and called my dog, Jeremy.

“Here boy! Daddy has a surprise for you. A yummy surprise! Here boy!”

My dog, an Australian shepherd, came running into my room from the hallway. He practically leapt into my arms. He got onto his hind legs once he saw what I was holding. He stuck his giant tongue out in anticipation. I put the plate down in front of him. He started to sniff it, but Jeremy made a whimpering noise when he realized what was on the plate. He backed away from it. He clearly knew I was serving him poison.

Something came over me. Something I’d never felt before. I felt a determination, a strong desire to get my dog to eat the avocados. I grabbed him by the collar, but he wouldn’t budge. He planted his paws firmly on the ground. I tried with all my strength to nudge him forward, but my dog was heavy. I needed to think quickly. I ran into the kitchen and grabbed his favorite toy. I plopped it right onto the plate and watched as he lunged forward, taking a mouthful of avocado as he scooped up his toy and started chewing.

It only took seconds before my dog began making weird gagging noises. He spit out his toy along with chunks of avocado. He began to choke and foam at the mouth. Then, he suddenly collapsed on the floor. I panicked and violently shook him to get him to wake up, but he just lay there sprawled on the ground. He was dead. My dog was fucking dead. I killed him. I fought back the tears welling up in my eyes. This was some sick joke, and I wasn’t interested in playing anymore.

I went back to my computer and saw that there was a new message. It read as follows:

"Wow. We didn’t know you had it in you. Congratulations! Don’t worry, we’ll be sure to cover the funeral costs and send your dog to doggy heaven where he can have more of that delicious avocado. Dogs can’t resist that green stuff. Your next question will be a bit more of a challenge, but you should be able to complete it in under a few minutes. Proceed when you are ready."

I was beginning to sob. I was honestly going to turn myself in right then and there. I’ve never once thought of harming my dog. The idea was so out of scope. Yet in that moment, I felt like something took control of me. Like some psychopath hopped into my body and did the deed for me. Strange, huh?

My cursor immediately clicked the arrow before I could do anything. I wanted to force shut down my computer. I pressed hard on the power button, but nothing happened. Instead, another message came up, and it read as follows:

"I wouldn’t do that if I were you. You must complete the entire survey for full compensation. You don’t want to miss out on that five hundred now, do you?"

I let out a long sigh. There was no getting out of this like I thought I’d be able to. This was just the beginning of this horrific nightmare.
