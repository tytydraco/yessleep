The word slithered into my ear, warm as breath: You.

I spun, heart jackhammering, but the hallway was empty. The bulb above swayed on its cord, buzzing louder, shadows dancing across the walls like insects under glass.

Then the smell changed.

It wasn’t just rot anymore—it was food. Or something pretending to be food. The scent of meat roasted too long, charred on the outside but raw in the middle. The sour reek of milk left on a counter in summer. Sweetness rotting into vinegar.

It drifted from a door at the end of the hall. A door I hadn’t noticed until now.

The knob was brass, green with corrosion, but warm when I touched it—fever warm. The voices in the walls hissed frantically:

“Don’t.”

“Not there.”

“It’s waiting.”

I opened it anyway.

The dining room sprawled before me, long and low-ceilinged, the table stretching far too long for the size of the house. Candles guttered in tarnished holders, dripping wax that ran in thick ropes onto plates already buried under piles of food.

I gagged when I saw it.

The platters were stacked with meat, but not cuts I recognized—too jagged, too irregular, bone protruding at odd angles. Some pieces still had hair, others teeth embedded in the gristle. A tureen at the table’s center overflowed with something gray and stringy swimming in cloudy broth, the smell of it burning my eyes.

And seated at the head of the table was the man.

Not the one I’d first seen. This one was worse.

His skin hung loose, sloughing off in sheets that stuck to his shirt. His eyes were bright, feverish, one larger than the other as though it had swollen and never gone down. His mouth twitched, lips slick, opening and closing as though chewing invisible food.

“Sit,” he croaked. His voice sounded wet, gurgling through a throat clogged with phlegm. He gestured to a chair pulled out, its cushion stained dark.

I shook my head, words clawing at my throat but refusing to come.

The man’s grin widened until his cheeks split. Blood welled at the corners of his mouth, but he didn’t seem to notice. His tongue, black and swollen, flicked out to lap it up.

“Sit.”

The walls groaned. The floorboards buckled. The whispers hissed frantically now—pleading, begging.

I backed away, but the chair scraped across the floor on its own, closer, demanding. The smell of rot thickened, choking me. My stomach heaved.

And then I heard it.

Chewing.

Not from him. From under the table.

Something shifted beneath the cloth, scuttling quick, the fabric bulging outward like a dog pressing its back against it. Wet sounds followed—tearing, crunching, slurping. The table shuddered with each bite.

I couldn’t stop staring.

A hand shot out from beneath the cloth. Not a human hand. Too many joints, fingers bent backward, nails black and hooked. It scrabbled at a platter, seized a chunk of meat, and yanked it back underneath.

The man chuckled, the sound a wet rattle.

“They’re hungry. You wouldn’t want to be rude.”

The whispers screamed now, rising over each other until the walls seemed to pulse with their desperation.

“Leave.”

“Before it sees you.”

“RUN.”

The thing under the table shifted again, and the cloth slipped.

For the briefest moment, I saw it.

A face. Childlike, but stretched wrong. Eyes too big, mouth too wide, teeth crooked and wet. Its skin was raw, patchy, slick with something black. It grinned up at me, strings of meat dangling from its lips.

And it whispered, in a voice that was almost mine:

“Stay.”

I staggered backward, hit the doorframe, and bolted.

The man shrieked behind me, the sound jagged and furious, rattling the windows. The table overturned, platters crashing, meat and bone splattering across the floor. The thing under the cloth scuttled fast, claws scraping wood, chasing.

I sprinted into the hallway, the door slamming shut behind me with a force that rattled the walls.

The whispers quieted.

The house sighed.

But I knew—I wasn’t alone anymore.

Something was following me.

I ran until my lungs were knives. Until the taste of iron coated my tongue. Until the hallway bent into itself like a snake eating its tail.

Every turn spat me back where I’d started. Same sagging wallpaper, same flickering bulbs. My boots slapped against the same stains. I knew because I started marking them with my fingernail—scraping a line across the wall. But when I came around the corner, the mark was already there. Deeper. Older.

Like I’d done it before.

The whispers were quieter now, faint as breath against glass. I strained to hear them, but they slipped away when I focused, like water between fingers.

That’s when I noticed the smell.

It had changed. Less rot, more…sweet. Sickly sweet. Like fruit gone overripe, bubbling into mush. I gagged, pressed my sleeve to my nose, but the scent clung inside my sinuses.

I followed it without meaning to. My legs carried me like I was dreaming, each step heavier than the last.

The hallway opened into a bedroom.

The air was worse here, humid and cloying. The bed sagged in the middle, sheets mottled with stains I didn’t want to identify. Flies buzzed in the corners, fat and lazy, their wings glistening in the bulb’s jaundiced light.

And on the nightstand sat a picture frame.

I froze.

It was me.

My face, blurry, caught mid-laugh. A photo I didn’t remember being taken. My arm was around someone—a woman, her face turned just enough that I couldn’t see her clearly. But she wore the bracelet I’d bought for Emily, my ex.

I whispered, “What the hell…” My voice cracked.

The whispers stirred. “You’ve been here.”

I dropped the frame. Glass shattered across the floor, slicing through the buzzing silence. My heart pounded so hard my vision blurred.

And then I saw it.

The photo wasn’t in the frame anymore.

It was on the wall.

Dozens of them. Hundreds. My face over and over, caught in moments I didn’t remember. Eating at tables I’d never sat at. Standing in front of this house, years older, years younger. Sometimes smiling. Sometimes crying.

Sometimes not alive.

In one, my skin was gray, lips blue. In another, I was slumped against the wall, flies crawling across my face. In another, my eyes were gouged out, sockets packed with something dark.

I stumbled back, tripping over the bedframe. My head cracked against the post and stars burst across my vision. When the blur cleared, the room was different.

The photos were gone.

The flies were gone.

The bed was neatly made, white sheets tucked hospital-tight.

My chest heaved. I pressed my palms to my face, nails digging into my skin, whispering, “I’m losing it. I’m losing it.”

But when I lowered my hands—

The bed was occupied.

A woman lay there, still under the sheets. Her hair was damp, clinging to her forehead. Her skin sagged, waxy and pale, but her chest rose and fell in shallow breaths.

I knew her.

I didn’t know how, but I did.

“Emily?” My voice cracked.

Her eyes snapped open.

They were white. Empty.

Her jaw unhinged with a crack. The sound that came out wasn’t human. Not a scream. Not a word. Something in between, raw and endless, like every voice in the walls had funneled into her throat.

The bulb above popped, showering the room in glass.

Darkness swallowed everything.
