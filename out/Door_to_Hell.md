I had just moved into a new apartment, excited for a fresh start. The building was old but had a certain charm, and my unit was everything I wanted spacious and filled with light. After settling in, I went downstairs to get my keys from the receptionist. She was friendly, smiling as she handed me the keys. But then her tone changed. She leaned in and said quietly, "Welcome! Just so you know, don’t mess with the door with no number on your floor. It’s... better left alone."  
  
I thought her comment was strange, but I was too excited about my move to think much about it. I headed up to my apartment, brushed it off, and spent the rest of the day unpacking. Everything felt perfect, and the place already felt like home.    
  
That night, things took a turn. While unpacking, I started hearing weird noises from down the hall. At first, they were faint creaks and faint sounds I tried to blame on the old building. But as the hours went by, the noises got worse. They didn’t sound like random creaks anymore. They were horrifying wet, squishy sounds combined with terrifying screams that sent chills down my spine.    
  
I tried to tell myself it was nothing, maybe just my imagination. But I couldn’t ignore it. Curiosity got the better of me, and I found myself standing in front of the door the receptionist warned me about the one with no number. My heart raced as I reached for the doorknob. I hesitated, but then, finally, I opened the door.  
  
What I saw inside was a nightmare I’ll never forget.    
  
The room was like a slaughterhouse. Bloody, dismembered bodies were scattered everywhere, rotting and unrecognizable. The smell of death hit me instantly and made me gag. In the middle of the room, a figure crouched over a fresh corpse, its hands covered in blood. I froze in horror as it slowly turned to look at me. Its eyes were wide, wild, and full of madness.    
  
I snapped out of my shock and turned to run, but before I could get away, it lunged at me. It slammed me to the ground, and I felt its claws tear into my chest. Sharp pain shot through my body, and before I knew it, darkness consumed me. My last thought was the horrifying realization that I wasn’t going to make it I was its next victim.  
  
When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed, my body covered in bandages. I was alive, but barely. The doctors told me that someone had interrupted the attack just in time, saving my life. They called it a miracle. But there was no relief for me. Memories of that night were burned into my mind the mutilated bodies, the killer’s insane eyes, the helpless feeling of being attacked.    
  
I moved out of the apartment as soon as I could, never daring to return. But the story didn’t end there. The killer was never found, and other tenants started disappearing, fueling rumors about what might be happening in that building. A place I once thought would be my fresh start had turned into a place of terror and tragedy.  
  
Even now, I can’t shake what happened. The sight of those bodies, the sounds, and the overwhelming fear still haunt me. I learned an important lesson from it all always trust your gut. When something feels wrong, it probably is. Sometimes, it’s better to walk away than to find out the truth. I’ll never forget what that building taught me, and the scars, both physical and emotional, are a constant reminder that some doors are better left closed.
