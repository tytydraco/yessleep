(note: this is my first time writing a horror story, so please be nice, but constructive criticism is welcomed. thanks, enjoy.)

It’s been a year since I had my wife, Lauren, admitted to Ozark Trail, a mental institute thirty minutes from our house.
it wasn’t something i wanted to do, but a dreadful decision that Lauren’s parents and I had to come to.

Her behavior started to change after our three year anniversary of being married. We’d just had our house built on my parent’s old property, our healthy daughter was four months old, and everything was going great.

It might have been a few weeks after we celebrated three years that I noticed she had stopped showering as often.

I don’t pay attention to when or how often my wife showers, so it was only when I noticed the greasy matting in her hair and the smell of body odor wafting off of her when she crawled into bed with me, that I realized she hadn’t been keeping up with her hygiene.

She told me she had just been too exhausted and couldn’t be bothered to shower.
My first instinct was to be disgusted by this. But then I immediately felt like a huge asshole when I took postpartum depression into account. So, I offered to help Lauren shower.

I brushed the tangles from her hair and I stood in the shower with her while she washed herself.
Then I brought her to bed, kissed her forehead, and we both went to sleep.

That wasn’t the first time I’d had to do that. From that point on, Lauren’s mental health and her overall ability to care for herself had taken a significant downward turn.

Her maternity leave had ended two months after our daughter’s birth. However, Lauren told me that she convinced them to give her an extra two weeks of paid leave, but when I noticed that our joint checking account was not staying at its usual amount, I began to grow suspicious.

When I called her work to ask about why she hadn’t received a paycheck in the last couple of weeks, they said that her maternity leave had already ended, and Lauren never showed back up to work. She never even contacted them.

When I confronted her, she cried and said she was sorry for lying. She told me she was afraid to go back to work. She didn’t want to leave our daughter alone.

“But she won’t be alone, she’ll be with a sitter,” I had said to try and console her. She looked up at me with her eyes red and swollen from crying. “I don’t want to leave her alone,” she had repeated and grasped onto me tighter. I just let her cry in my arms. I didn’t know what else to say.

I called Lauren’s mom the next day. I told her that Lauren had been incredibly depressed for a while, and I wanted to take her out for a day, just us together.

We were both exhausted from taking care of the baby, but it was clear that it had taken a much greater toll on Lauren than it did me.

Lauren’s parents agreed, happily, to watch Anna at our house. It was the first time they’d get to watch their only grandchild and it made me feel good that they were so willing to help us out.
However, when I told Lauren about this, she began to panic. She insisted that we could not leave Anna alone.

Again, I assured her that Anna wouldn’t be alone. She would be with her parents.
She began to cry, but I didn’t hold her this time. I took her by the shoulders and firmly, but calmly, I asked, “why can’t we leave Anna alone?”

She stared into my eyes for what felt like forever, a desperate, exhausted look in her eyes. I didn’t want to say anything else, because I had a feeling she was about to say something that would make everything fall into place, and I didn’t want to jeopardize that.

But what she said only made me more confused, and terrified.
She whispered it, like she didn’t want anyone to hear, even though we live on nearly a hundred acres of woods, with our closest neighbor being a mile down the road.

With tears still streaming down her face, in the quietest voice she could manage, she shuddered, “it wants to take us away.”

As much as I would have loved to throw my wife and baby in the car and drive as far away as I could, as quickly as I could, I didn’t. I stared back into those red, horrified eyes and I asked, “who wants to take us away, Lauren?”

She shook her head and blinked, more tears falling down her red cheeks.
“Not you,” she said, nearly sobbing by this point, “Anna and me.”

I believe in the paranormal. I’ve been a Christian my whole life and have always been consistent in my beliefs.

But I am a believer in logic too, and I did not believe that there was any non-corporeal being out there coming to take my wife and child.

So, when Lauren’s parents arrived the next morning, the three of us convinced her to let me take her out and let her parents watch Anna.

It was the first time in months she had been out of the house. First time in even longer that we’d gone out to do anything together.

When we had first gotten married, and our house was still in the construction process, we spent a lot of time in town, about fifteen minutes from our property. 

There’s a little diner that we both loved to eat at, and it became a special place for us.
We became regulars and the staff knew us by name. When Lauren was pregnant, the waitresses had given her gifts: onesies and sleepers and booties.

I was sure that going there again would lift her up, mentally.

Maybe she needed to be around other women.
It was a stupid hypothesis, but I was willing to try anything to help her get better.

The girls at the diner were excited to see Lauren. They showered her with hugs and that welcoming kind of love that women always seem to have for each other.

They asked about Anna, begging to see pictures of her, asking us when we were going to bring her to the diner.

All the while, Lauren was still detached. She’d given them hugs and answered their questions about the baby, but that was the extent of her friendliness.

She wanted to sit, so I told her to pick out a booth for us while I showed the girls dozens of pictures of Anna, from the day she was born up until that morning (I took a lot of pictures).

When the waitresses had dispersed and went back to work, one of them stayed behind. I knew her name was Carol, even without reading her name-tag.

Quietly, she asked, “is she alright?”

She nodded toward Lauren, and I looked in her direction. She was sitting in a booth, back facing me, just staring out the window and at the trees.

“I know it’s none of my business,” Carol added, “but she looks exhausted.”

I didn’t want to have this conversation while Lauren was sitting fifteen feet away, so I just smiled and said, “well, having a baby is hard.”

She gave me a knowing look, like she knew I was lying, but she nodded and walked away. I looked over at Lauren to see her still looking in the same direction and when I walked around to sit opposite her in the booth, she wore a blank expression.

“Lauren?” I said as I sat down.
She looked through me, expressionless.
“Honey?” I said, reaching out and touching her hand.

“Hm?” She said, looking at my face now. She looked sort of uncomfortable.
I rubbed her hand gently. “Anna is fine,” I reassured her.

She didn’t respond.

Carol came over to our booth, pen and notepad in hand.
“What can I get for y’all today?” She asked, flipping the notepad to a new page.

I looked at Lauren, “I think I’m in the mood for those pancakes we used to get all the time.” I squeezed her hand a little, and she smiled.

It made my heart soar to see her lips curl up into that beautiful grin that I hadn’t seen in weeks.

Carol wrote that down, “two orders of pancakes, and how about some coffee to go with that?” She asked, looking between us.

“That would be great, Carol. Thank you.” Lauren said. And though it was small, she smiled at Carol too.

I could’ve jumped with joy at that. She was actually smiling.
I was sure, in that moment, that my idea had really worked, and bringing her out really did help her.

After having breakfast, we spent the day going to various stores. Though Lauren was still mostly detached and spent a lot of the day in a daze, she was still able to pick out a few things for me to buy for her.

Afterward, I took her to the lake and we watched the sunset.
I decided to give her a gift that I’d been waiting to give her.

A week before our outing, after I had gotten off of work, I had gotten Lauren’s favorite necklace fixed at a jeweler’s shop not too far from home.
When the necklace, a silver chain with a ruby charm attached to it, had broken, Lauren was devastated. Her father had given her the necklace when she was sixteen and she’d worn it everyday since.

She’d been meaning to get it fixed, but never actually got around to it. So, I took it upon myself to do it for her.

We were sitting on a bench, her head leaning against my shoulder.
I pulled the necklace out of my pocket and showed it to her, wordlessly.
She looked at it, and then looked at me.
She took it from my hand before grabbing me and hugging me tightly.

I smiled as I held her warm body against mine until I felt her trembling. She was crying into my shirt, her hands gripping me as tiny sobs racked her body.

“Hey,” I cooed softly, “hey, it’s okay.” I held her tightly and let her finish crying.

I didn’t know why she sobbed like that, but she did. And she kept crying until the sun had gone down and we were ready to leave.
She let me clasp the chain around her neck before we got into the car and went home.

I thanked Lauren’s mom and dad for watching Anna and paid them $50 for spending the day with her. I know they would’ve done it for free, but it felt wrong to ask without giving them something in return.

They decided to spend the night with us, as it was late and neither of them were great drivers in the dark.

Alice, Lauren’s mother, helped Lauren get Anna to sleep while Lauren’s dad, Roger, and I made a late dinner for the four of us.
We decided on spaghetti, as it was quick and required basically no effort.

We all ate, went to sleep, and everything was fine for the rest of the night.

Lauren slept in, like she usually had been. So, I was the one that saw Alice and Roger out.

It was the weekend and I didn’t have to work, so I decided to make breakfast for Lauren and I.
I was grabbing the eggs out of the refrigerator when I heard a blood-curdling scream. First from my wife, and then Anna.

I dropped the entire carton, the eggs cracking and spilling out onto the tile.

The single flight of stairs felt like an eternity while I kept shouting my wife’s name with no answer.
When I got to Anna’s room, I saw her crib had been tipped over, and Anna laying on the floor, still screaming, while Lauren rocked herself in the corner, sobbing loudly.

I will admit that I hesitated at first. I know I shouldn’t have, but my first instinct was to rush to my wife and ask her what happened. But then reality crashed down on me when I was hit with another one of Anna’s heart-piercing cries.

I scooped my child up into my arms, searching her for any kind of injury and I began to coo her, to no avail.

She kept screaming in my ear as I rocked her.

Lauren finally looked up, tears and snot running down her face. She was crying like a toddler.

“What happened?” I shouted at her.
She began to sob again like she didn’t want to answer me.

I put Anna in her crib once I’d steadied it back to its original position.

I hated to raise my voice at Lauren, but I had to. I practically screamed at her, “what did you do?”

“Her face was gone!” She screamed back, choking on her sobs, “it was gone!”

Our child’s face was still fully intact, but her words still made my stomach drop.
My wife was losing her mind.

“What did you do?” I repeated, calmer, but still angry.

“I fell- I dropped her- I-“ she just kept crying.

She was holding her head, squeezing it like there was something inside it that she wanted to get out.

Anna was still screaming.
I took a deep breath, trying to be rational.
I realized then that Anna hadn’t eaten last night. Lauren never fed her before taking her to bed, and she hadn’t yet eaten this morning either.

“She’s hungry, Lauren.”
I picked Anna up out of her crib. “You have to feed her.”

I carried Anna to her mother, kneeling down so we were both on the floor.
Lauren hesitated, whimpering. Her mouth quivered and more tears beckoned at the waterlines of her eyes.

“Please, Lauren.”

She wiped her tears on her nightgown and reached out to take the baby.
I sat by her side, rubbing her arm while she let Anna eat from her breast.

We must have been a sight there on the floor.
Two exhausted people, both losing their sanity; one losing it a lot faster than the other.

I didn’t tell anyone about Lauren dropping the baby. I didn’t want anyone to think we were abusing our child or that Anna was in any kind of danger with us.
With me, at least.

I did, however, tell the professionals at Ozark trail that she had been having hallucinations along with extreme depression.

Once again, I didn’t hone in on the specifics for them, but I did say that I thought she was a danger to herself, but not to others.
She’s a sweet woman, she would never hurt anyone intentionally. Though, out of fear, I wasn’t sure.

I signed a bunch of paperwork, gave them my insurance information, and all that was left to do was to get Lauren to sign too.
That would be the hard part.

They advised me to tell her that it was more like a vacation than a mental hospital stay. They said that rehabilitation would be good for her. For all of us.

Her parents agreed.
At first, they offered to stay with her while I was at work. But out of fear that Lauren might accidentally hurt Anna again, especially in front of other people, I told them that wasn’t necessary.
However, I did take them up on their offer to watch Anna while I was at work. After all, I can’t bring a baby with me to a factory that makes car engines.

That night, after I put Anna to sleep and got into bed with Lauren, I told her about the meeting I’d had at Ozark trail.

I didn’t hesitate. I told her that I needed her to sign the papers, giving her consent to be taken in and held under the hospital’s supervision.

She didn’t say anything, she just laid there, her eyes open as she stared through me.
I didn’t let up, continuing to persuade her. I was practically begging her.

I even threatened to divorce her if she didn’t sign them, which wasn’t true and probably a shitty move on my part, but I would’ve done anything. It was our child’s safety that was on the line if she didn’t get help.

After nearly an hour of my begging and her looking at me with those big, terrified eyes, she agreed.

I took the papers out of my nightstand drawer and she sat up in bed, taking them from me along with a pen.

She hesitated, staring at the paperwork.
Finally, she said something. “Do you think I’m crazy?” Her voice trembled like she was on the verge of tears.

I didn’t know what to say. I couldn’t say yes, but I couldn’t say no either.

“I think you need help, Lauren.” I put a hand on her shoulder and she started to cry.

Her tears dripped onto the papers, creating little circles of wet in the printed words.

She stared down, “I don’t know if I’m losing my mind.” Her breath hitched before she continued, “but I see people. I hear them talking and they say I’m going to die.” She looked up at me. “Protect Anna,” her voice broke, “please.”

I nodded. I thought, the only thing I’m protecting her from is you, but I didn’t say it.
I told her I would protect Anna and that nothing was going to hurt any of us. She would get help, and everything would go back to normal.

Dropping Lauren off at Ozark trail was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. She cried the whole way there, cried while she held our baby, and cried as a nurse led her into the building and out of my sight.

I looked down at Anna, cooing in my arms.
As I strapped her into her car seat, I muttered affirmations to her, which might have been more to console myself than they were for Anna’s sake.
“She’ll get better,” I said as I clipped the tiny carseat straps over Anna’s chest. “She’ll be back in no time.”
Then we drove home.

After putting Anna to sleep, I laid on the floor and fell asleep next to her crib. It was the best sleep I’d had in months.

Things went relatively smooth for the next couple of months. I would take Anna to visit Lauren every weekend, Lauren’s parents watched Anna everyday, since they’re both retired.

I had spoken to Lauren’s doctor a few times since admitting her, and it didn’t seem like she was making significant progress. She was still depressed and was having the occasional meltdown. 

One meltdown was caused because she had apparently seen a woman standing outside her window. 

When the staff asked what the woman looked like, Lauren chose not to answer out of fear that they wouldn’t believe her.
Her doctor explained that it could take months for her to fully recover from her diagnosis, postpartum psychosis, and to redirect my energy to taking care of myself and Anna while Lauren rested.

That was easier said than done, but I managed.
Anna was six months old, and had just started teething.

I was letting her chew on my finger with what little teeth she had when my phone rang. It was the middle of the night, so I thought it might have been one of those telemarketers that I would usually ignore.

The number was from the hospital where my wife was.

I answered, sitting upright in my chair, Anna’s eyes flicking up to me in curious infant wonder.

“Hello?” I answered.

“Hi, this is Selena, from Ozark Trail Rehabilitation. I’m calling in regard to your wife, Lauren.”

Without hesitating, I asked, “what happened?”

She was silent for a few seconds. I wasn’t sure if she was hesitating or distracted. I could hear the typical hospital noises in the background: phones ringing, people talking.

Finally, she responded, “she managed to get out of the hospital tonight.”

I was standing by that point, pacing with my daughter on my hip. I was already looking for my keys while I spoke.

“Where is she?” I’m sure I sounded more frantic than I intended.

“She’s here, at the hospital. The police were able to track her. They found her walking on the road, just outside of your property. They figured she was trying to go home, so they followed her there.”

I exhaled, relieved.
“Is she okay?” I asked.

Her tone brightened, “she’s perfectly fine. No visible injuries, but she was covered in dirt and sticks like she was walking through the woods before they found her.”

I didn’t think to ask why she might have been in the woods. I was too relieved to hear that she wasn’t hurt.

When Anna was seven months old, Lauren was discharged from Ozark Trail.

To say she was better was an understatement. She had become an entirely new person.
I didn’t even notice that she had lost the color in her complexion until I saw that she’d gotten it back.

She wore the same clothes as when I had dropped her off, only they fit better after she was discharged. She’d regained the weight she had lost from when she went days without eating more than a few bites of anything.

When she wrapped her arms around me, I felt my heart soar. This wasn’t like any hug I’d had from her in the past three months. This was a hug that said, “I love you.”

I could almost feel gratitude in that hug.

We spent the day in bed and when I asked her about her stay in the hospital, she didn’t have much to say. I didn’t pry, because I didn’t want her to think too much about what we went through before she was admitted.

Everything was perfect. I had helped my wife and our lives could resume. I smiled to myself as I held her in my arms.

Life went on.

Our daughter started to talk around eleven months old and her first was “mama”.
I was a little disappointed that it wasn’t “daddy” or “dada”, but I was proud anyway.

Lauren had stopped breastfeeding after she came back from the hospital.
When she had attempted it again her first day back, she seemed uncomfortable, a little disgusted even.

She had handed Anna back to me and said she should probably eat something else from now on.

I found this a little strange, but I didn’t question it. It was her decision, ultimately, and if she didn’t want to do that anymore, it wasn’t my place to impose on that choice.

However, this wasn’t the only way she had seemed to distance herself from Anna.
She stopped responding to her when she cried.
She didn’t wake up when Anna would start waling at five in the morning, and even when we were awake, she would ignore Anna’s cries.

There was one night where Lauren and I had been up late together. She was straddling my lap and kissing me when Anna had suddenly began to cry.

“I’ll go get her,” I said, moving to get up.
I couldn’t though, because Lauren wasn’t getting off of me. She kept kissing me,
her lips trailing down my cheek and neck.

“Lauren.” I said louder, “Anna’s crying,” I had to push her off of me and she landed on her side on the bed.

She’d gotten angry at me for that.

She slept on her side, facing away from me for the entire night.

All of this, I chalked up to her still recovering from her postpartum psychosis.
Anything was better than having to go through all of that again, so I didn’t complain about her mood swings.

Maybe I was stupid for that.

A month passed, and Anna was already a year old.

We threw a party for her first birthday in our front yard. We didn’t have a lot of friends in the area, especially because of how rural our town is, but a few people showed. Some girls from the diner, Lauren’s mom and dad, and a friend of mine from work showed up. Daryl, my coworker, brought his German Shepherd, Sadie, to the party.

Anna absolutely adored Daryl’s dog. Sadie licked her face and it made Anna giggle harder than she ever had.

The waitresses that showed up took turns holding Anna and playing with her.

Lauren was inside for most of the party. She complained that she had a migraine.
It wasn’t a big deal though, because I did a good job of keeping our guests entertained.

Although, Anna was clearly the main attraction.

Once everyone had finally had a chance to hold my baby, she was given back to me. I held her while talking to Lauren’s dad.

“Mama, mama” Anna kept repeating.

I ignored this, as she repeated the word “mama” about a hundred thousand times a day, and I was more interested in talking about Roger’s ‘71 Pontiac GTO.

Anna began to point up at the house, saying “mama” again.

I glanced up to where she was pointing.
Lauren was standing at our bedroom window, staring down at me. I couldn’t read her expression, but when I waved, and had jokingly shaken Anna’s hand in a waving motion too, she didn’t wave back. She just kept staring.

Finally, toward the end of the party when everyone had begun to leave, Lauren came out of the house.

The only guests left were Daryl and his dog.
We were sitting in the grass, talking, while Anna played with Sadie.

Lauren’s shadow casting over Daryl’s face made me look up to see that she was standing behind me.

“Hey, honey.” I smiled at her, “you feel better?”
Her arms were folded and she was smiling down at me. 

“Yeah, I took a nap, so I’m feeling fine.”

When I turned back to look at Anna, Sadie was staring up at my wife, her lip curled up into a snarl.

I pulled Anna up into my arms as Sadie began to growl viciously, and then barked at my wife like she was some kind of animal.

“Hey!” Daryl yelled at his dog, pulling her leash to keep her from attacking Lauren, as it was evident that it was what she was about to do.

Lauren just laughed and went back inside.

I didn’t wonder why she wasn’t afraid, then. I was just happy that she wasn’t upset.

That same night, on my way to bed, I was about to walk past the guest bathroom upstairs, when I noticed the door was cracked. I walked quietly, so Lauren wouldn’t notice me, as I could hear her in there making faint sounds.

It sounded like she was laughing quietly.

My intention was to creep up on her and scare her. Something we used to do to each other all the time when our house had just been built.

I crept toward the door, and peered inside.
She was standing at the vanity, looking in the mirror.

She smiled wide at herself and then her face fell back to its normal position.

She smiled again, but this time, she waved.
I almost laughed because it was such a bizarre sight.

She smiled again, waving, and quietly she said to herself, “Hi, I’m Lauren.”

My face wrinkled into confusion. It was like she was rehearsing how to speak to people.

“I’m Lauren.” She said and smiled, waving again.

I stopped watching her. I just stood in the hallway, staring at our family photos hanging on the wall.
Our maternity pictures, Anna’s ultrasound photos, a picture of all of us the day Anna was born.
Everything was so much better, then.
Sometimes It felt like my wife never fully returned from Ozark Trail.

She was happier and not completely depressed, yes, but somehow not completely Lauren.

I wondered if that could be attributed to the medication she’d been prescribed.
Or maybe I was just remembering her wrong.

I went to go peak at her again to see if she was still practicing lines in the mirror, but when I turned to look, she was standing at the crack in the door, watching me.

I nearly jumped out of my skin, “Jesus, Lauren-“

“Were you watching me?” Her eyes narrowed. She looked angry.

“No, I-“ I began to stutter over my words. She was never intimidating to me before. “I was gonna scare you,” I admitted, sheepishly.

She slammed the bathroom door on me and locked it, leaving me in the hallway by myself.

It’s been a little over four months since that night, a year since I had Lauren admitted to Ozark Trail.

Since Lauren had been applying for jobs, we started to look at daycares to send Anna to while we both worked.

I was doing most of the work, as Lauren didn’t show much of an interest in anything having to do with Anna lately.

This had caused a few arguments between us, which usually ended in Lauren getting mad at me because I was “putting Anna before her”.
I’d never taken Lauren to be selfish, but she was really acting like it recently.

Tonight, we laid in bed together.

Lauren reached over and cupped my face and began kissing me.

She had been a lot more ‘excited’ in the recent months, which I couldn’t complain about.
I was half expecting her to be pregnant again by now, as she hadn’t been on the pill since before she was pregnant with Anna. But weirdly, she wasn’t.

I was kissing her neck and got to her collarbone when I noticed something that made me pull away.

“Where’s your necklace?” I asked, looking up at her.

“What necklace?” She responded, still lost in a daze of ecstasy.

“The ruby one. The one you wear all the time.”
I tried to remember the last time I’d seen her wearing it, but I couldn’t.

She was silent for a long time.
“It probably just fell off somewhere.”

I sat up, “do you want me to look for it?” I began moving the blanket to see if it could’ve been somewhere in our bed, but she stopped me.

“It’s just a stupid necklace. Don’t worry about it.”

I stared at her in shock. “But you love that necklace. You cried when it broke.”

She looked about as confused as I did before she just rolled her eyes and insisted that the necklace didn’t matter and went back to kissing me.

I woke up at around seven this morning to a voicemail from my neighbors on the other side of the woods, about a mile out.
An elderly couple in their late eighties.

I put the voicemail on speaker and set my phone down on the nightstand so I could listen to it.

“This is Joe.” The old man coughed, thick and loud, before continuing, “my wife’s been complaining, sayin’ she smells som’n dead off in the woods. It’s prob’ly a deer or som’n, but she said she can’t sit on the porch and drink ‘er coffee ‘cause it stinks too bad. I’d go out there and look, but I’m afraid I’d get my walker stuck and won’t be able to get back home. Anyway, thanks.”

The voicemail ended.
I groaned.
The last thing I wanted to do on a Sunday morning was get out into the cold November air and search for a dead deer.

I got out of bed and put on a pair of jeans and a thick, flannel shirt.

I was putting my shoes on by the front door when Lauren came up behind me.

“Where are you going?” She asked.

I turned to look at her as I pulled my coat on.
“The neighbors want me to go find some dead animal out in the woods, they said it’s making their whole yard smell bad so I’m gonna go do something about it.” I zipped up my coat.

“Let me go look,” she said, grabbing her coat.

I didn’t mean to, but I laughed. “Lauren, if it’s a deer, that thing is probably bigger than you are.”
She looked disappointed by my response, so I said, “I’m just gonna go drag it to the road so no one can smell it anymore. It won’t take that long.” I kissed her on the head.

“Just stay here with Anna,” I said as I walked out the door.

She held it open and stood in the doorway as I walked down the steps.

I could feel her watching me as I made my way toward the woods and when I reached the tree line, I looked back and saw her standing on the edge of the porch, the front door swung wide open as she kept her stare locked on me.
I shook this off and started into the woods, still unnerved.

I could smell death in the air, not long after beginning my trek through the sticks.
The sharp wind whipped through the trees and made it hard to hear anything besides the leaves crunching under me.

My cheeks and nose were stinging with cold and I regretted not wearing a mask.

I could feel my eyes beginning to water as the stench of rot overtook my senses.

Before I realized what had happened, I was on the ground.

I’d tripped on something, which I soon realized was a hole in the ground. A massive hole, about two feet deep and at least six feet wide.
When I sat up, I realized that the hole had been filled in with leaves, which were now all rotted into little brown corpses.

Not only that, but the smell of death was so close that I almost vomited.

I sat up on my knees in the hole. Something wet left reddish-brown spots on my jeans, which I thought was mud at first, until I remembered that it hadn’t rained here in at least a month.

That’s when I saw it. A red stone shining against the morning sunlight.

At first, my heart soared with joy because I realized I had found my wife’s missing necklace.
But when I went to pick it up by the chain, it resisted. It was attached to something.

I pushed enough leaves to the side to reveal something that made my stomach turn and I did vomit that time, off in the leaves next to the rotting corpse underneath me.

It was a human, but its face was gone and it had been scalped. Both of its eyeballs were there, staring up at me. What was left of its jaw, teeth still intact, was wide open and maggots had nested in it and were eating at the muscles of its skinless face.

Even through the decay, I recognized those eyes.
I threw up again when I realized the rotting corpse was my wife.

Confusion and terror and guilt flooded me like a river. I could’ve drowned in it. But I didn’t.
Because I was pulled back to reality when I heard the crunching of leaves behind me. I didn’t need to look to know who, or what, it was.
