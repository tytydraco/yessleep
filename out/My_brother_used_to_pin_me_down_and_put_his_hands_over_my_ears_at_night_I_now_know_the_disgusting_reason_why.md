I thought it was normal that my brother would pin me down on my bed and place his hands over my ears while I slept. We would sit like this for hours before he would finally let go. I now know the horrifying reality of what he was doing to me.   
  
I never found out why he did this, and no matter how hard I asked Brendan, he didn’t tell me. My parents tried pretending as if they were a happy couple, and they tried to act like it was all okay, but I knew they must’ve been having an argument or a fight. I would soon discover that the real reason was so much more horrifying.  
  
I knew Brendan wouldn’t tell me why, so I decided to start spying on my parents. This was something I did all the time, but I found nothing. The only useful thing I gained from all this wasted time were my mom’s favorite railing positions, but there was nothing else. The way they talked to each other made it seem like everything was perfectly fine. The only times I knew something was wrong were when Brendan would visit and cover my ears.  
  
As time went on, I got better at sneaking my way around parts of the house without anyone noticing, and I learned how to walk without making any sound whatsoever. Which is why tonight, I decided I would creep up to Brendan's bedroom and peek in through the keyhole. At first, everything looked normal, but as my eyes moved to his desk, I saw it. His laptop was opened, and there was a video playing on it. I knew I had to see what it was, so I opened his door and walked over to his desk. After some consideration, I pushed play. This would soon become the biggest mistake of my entire life.   
  
At first, it took me a second to realize what I was seeing. There was a man strapped to a table, completely unclothed. He was in a bright white room, with a mirror next to him. Suddenly though, another figure walked into frame. They were wearing a mask and a crimson uniform. They pulled gloves out of their pocket and put them on. By this point, everything in my body was telling me to stop watching, but I continued anyway. The figure picked up a scalpel from the table and started making large cuts into their flesh. I watched as the man first lost his fingers, and then his arms. His screams filled the room as blood spilled all over the once white floor. I couldn’t take it anymore. I closed the laptop and quickly ran back to my room and locked the door. I couldn’t believe what I had just seen. Fear quickly consumed me as I tried to think of any reason why my brother would be watching a video like that. At first I considered that it could be a movie, but I deferred. The sounds of bones breaking and flesh being ripped through were too real to be from a movie. Maybe he had a reason to explain all of it, but I knew I couldn’t ask him. There was only one option I had left.  
  
The next morning, when Brendan wasn’t home, I went into the kitchen to speak to my dad. I told him about the video I had seen, and I told him about everything. At first, his face turned to a nervous expression, and it was like he was worried about something. But it quickly changed to one that was more calm and relaxed.  
  
“You don’t need to worry about that. Brendan is taking a criminology class this year, and that’s just something they have to show people.” he said in an innocent tone  
  
“Are you sure though dad? It looked so real, and there was so much blood.” I replied back, still not convinced.  
  
“Well of course it looks real, how else do you think people are supposed to get used to being around blood?” he said back.  
  
That answer made sense to me, and made me start to reconsider everything. Maybe I was wrong, and maybe it really was just for his college class. I decided to brush it off and just forget about it all.  
  
After that talk with my dad, it was like the visits from Brendan at night stopped. Normally they would happen twice a month, but there hadn’t been one in 3 months. That was until tonight. Now usually, I would be asleep when he visited, but tonight was different. It was summer break, so I was still awake, handling business in the bathroom when I heard Brendan open the door to my bedroom. He called out my name, and I heard him pull the sheets off my bed looking for me.   
  
“Is he awake?” I suddenly heard my dad ask from the hallway.  
  
“He’s not here.” Brendan responded back.  
  
“He must be spending the night at a friend’s house. That’s good though. Just make sure you stay upstairs.” my dad replied.   
  
I considered coming out from the bathroom and telling them that I was home, but I stayed quiet, and waited until I heard them walk downstairs. I quickly got up from the toilet, and snuck downstairs. I expected to see someone, but it was empty. I was confused at first, but then I heard faint noises coming from the basement. I couldn’t tell what I was hearing, so I went to the basement door and tried opening it, but it was bolted shut. This wasn’t normal, as I had never seen these locks on the door before. I considered just leaving it, and going back to my room, but I had to know what they were doing down there.  
  
I looked around the kitchen for anything I could use to pry the door open, until I came across a lock pick in the back of a cabinet. I walked back to the door and began picking the five locks, each more complicated than the last. As the last lock came free, I felt chills shoot down my spine. It was like I knew something about this was horribly wrong, but I just never could’ve imagined how much worse it would really be.  
  
I opened the basement door, and slowly began sneaking down the stairs. After every step I took, it felt like the noise I had previously heard got louder and more clear. As I reached the bottom step, I finally realized what I was hearing. Screams. Loud ones. They reminded me of the ones I had heard from the video on Brendan's laptop, but they were worse. I could tell it was from a girl. I looked around the basement for a moment, trying to figure out where they were coming from. That was when I saw a soft white glow coming from behind an old shelf in the corner. I quickly approached it, and quietly moved it to reveal another door. This one was different though. It was old, and covered in bloodshot red stains. I put my ear to the door and started listening.  
  
“You are going to die tonight.” my father said in a heavy tone.  
  
“God does not forgive your sins. He tasked me with taking care of you, and making sure you get what you deserve.”   
  
“Please, please I’m sorry. I’m not a sinner, I don’t know what you’re talking about.” the woman shouted.  
  
I immediately knew whose voice that was. It was our mom. My heart stopped, and I was about to burst through the door to stop him, but I knew I couldn’t. I knew he would kill me too.  
  
“You don’t have to do this! Please, I’m your wife for Christ's sake!”  Mom shouted  
  
That was the last thing I heard before her cries were replaced by loud screams. Screams that could be heard across the world. What followed was the sound of several bones being broken, and the ripping of flesh. It went on for several minutes, until finally my father spoke.  
  
“It's time to clean up,” he said.  
  
That was when I knew I had to get out of there. I had to tell Brendan about what I had just witnessed. I quickly moved the shelf back into place, threw my blood covered shoes into a bin and ran to the stairs. I was just about to reach the top when I felt a familiar hand cover my mouth. It was Brendan. He started pulling me back down the stairs and towards the glowing white room. As he was approaching it, he pulled me close and whispered:  
  
“You should have just covered your ears.”
