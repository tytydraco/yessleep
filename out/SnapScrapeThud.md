**December 19, 11:48 p.m.**

I wasn’t planning to write this tonight. I haven’t opened this laptop since before the fall. But the house is making that noise again, and I don’t know what else to do except type while it happens.

If you’ve ever heard someone die—not seen, not found after, but heard it happen—you’ll understand why silence feels dangerous to me now. It’s been almost a year, but I can still hear it perfectly:
Brendan’s voice, thin from the cold. The scrape of his boot on the roof. His laugh—God, that laugh—right before the line broke.

*Snap.*

*Scrape.*

*Thud.*

That rhythm carved itself into me. Sometimes I forget his face, but never the sound. Even with the TV on, even when I fall asleep drunk, it waits behind everything else.

Tonight, it came from the attic.

At first I told myself it was the heat settling, or maybe snow sliding off the shingles. But the heater’s been dead for weeks, and the snow stopped at sundown. I sat downstairs with both hands on the table until the sound stopped, just long enough to make me feel stupid for noticing. Then it started again—three short pulses, heavier this time, like something trying to remember how to fall.

I know how this sounds. I know what grief does to a mind. But something is moving up there. And I swear the rhythm is getting closer.


**December 20, 12:07 a.m.**

It was the first real snow of the season. Brendan was in his element—music too loud, cider steaming on the porch, Christmas lights tangled around his shoulders like tinsel armor. I remember him saying, “One more strand and the house’ll finally look alive.” He always wanted things to glow.

I was still at work. He called me on video around six, camera flipping between his grin and the tangled strand of bulbs. The connection kept freezing; more static than picture, but enough for me to see him against the roofline.

“Does it look straight from down there?” he joked.

The image stuttered, and I told him to get inside—it was getting dark. He laughed. “You worry too much, Mark. It’s just the roof.”

Then the screen froze on his smile. The sound kept going. A shift, a creak. 
The muffled slide of gloves on ice.

*Snap.*

*Scrape.*

*Thud.*

Silence so deep I thought the call dropped. I said his name again and again—“Brendan? Hey, are you okay?”—until only static answered. Then one short, wet breath that didn’t sound human.

I don’t remember the drive home. Just exhaust fumes, snow swallowing every sound except that rhythm looping in my head. When I found him, the phone was still in his hand, my voice echoing faintly through the speaker.

That was a year ago. And now the house still *hums* when the temperature drops, as if trying to undo what it did.


**December 20, 12:41 a.m.**

Something’s wrong with the ceiling.

A faint dark patch above the kitchen doorway—damp, pulsing with heat. Veins of discoloration running through the plaster. If I stay quiet, I can hear it: faint ticking, deliberate, rhythmic.

*Snap. Scrape. Thud.*

The same order. Always that order.

I turned off the lights. The sound kept moving, pausing just long enough to trick me before it started again, softer and closer. The air smells like iron. The attic hatch bulges—slightly—as though something heavy presses from within.

I’m trying to convince myself to sleep downstairs. But the ceiling just shifted, dropping grit into the doorway. The house feels like it’s breathing.


**December 20, 1:27 a.m.**

I can’t keep pretending I imagined it.

I pulled the attic latch. The air that drifted down was warm and metallic. Dust fell in a sheet, hissing when it hit the floor.

The boards above were damp. The insulation hung loose, darker at the center. I crawled toward the Christmas boxes, my phone flashlight shaking in my hand. Everything looked half‑melted. Cardboard collapsed, edges slick.

Then I saw it: a blond‑grey hair, caught on a nail. More, woven into the rafters like sinew. I brushed insulation aside—and something underneath twitched.

The plank beneath me answered with a crack. *Snap.*

A drag of grit inside the wall. *Scrape.*

Then, from below, a heavy *Thud.*

I stayed there listening until the sound stopped. The thing beneath the boards was still breathing.


**December 20, 2:06 a.m.**

I keep telling myself I imagined it, but my hands won’t stop shaking.

Where the ladder stood, dark smears trail across the tile—rust‑colored, oily. The ceiling sagged overnight, rhythmically dipping like lungs remembering how to breathe.

Residue coats everything. The walls are tacky. The wood grabs my palms and stretches fine threads of clear, sticky film when I move away. The air tastes like iron and varnish.
Then—the sound again, now in the fridge wall. *Snap. Scrape. Thud.* The drywall trembled inward, showing fibers that pulsed like veins.

I backed off and left footprints that gleamed too dark for water. It feels like I’m the part that’s intruding now, like I’m contaminating it.


**December 20, 3:12 a.m.**

The house is syncing with me.
Every breath I take, it echoes. When I hold my breath, it holds too.

Frost has formed inside the window glass, branching across the pane like veins. The patch on the ceiling burst—sap‑colored liquid dribbled down the wallpaper. It smells of iron and pine.

The rhythm changed. Slower. Controlled.

And then I realized—it’s timing itself to my heartbeat.

When I whispered Brendan’s name, the vent exhaled it back. My voice, wrong, stretched thin.

The tiles under my feet softened again. The grout stretched. Each light flickered with my pulse. If I stop moving, the bulbs dim. When I step back, they brighten, almost relieved.

When I exhaled, a vent above answered with the same breath. Lungs learning to mimic speech.

It isn’t haunting me anymore. It’s repeating me.


**December 20, 3:58 a.m.**

The house is trying to hold me.

My hand stuck to the counter. Beneath the laminate, something moved—warm and wet. Thin clear threads stretched between my fingers when I pulled away. The surface swallowed my handprint.

The hum returned, vibrating through every glass. The chandelier trembled. The rhythm found me again. Inhale. Exhale.

I stepped back—the tile rose under my heel like muscle flexing.

The kitchen wall sighed, fogging over. In the mist, my name: Mark.
Then Brendan’s laugh, right beside my ear. The air vent breathed: *”One more strand…”*

The wall rippled, paint cracking to reveal something wet beneath, shifting as if learning to fit around me.

*Snap.*

*Scrape.*

*Thud.*


**December 20, 4:33 a.m.**

I tried to leave. The door won’t open.

The knob pulses under my hand. The wood remembers where I pressed. The floor lifts softly with my heartbeat.

The hum fills every corner now—house and body matching pace. When I breathe, the wallpaper rises too. When I stop, it waits.

Something brushes my ankle; the pull is gentle, sure. Warmth climbs my legs. The ceiling lowers, veins expanding underneath the paint.

And then the sound comes, perfect this time—my own breath keeping time with it.

*Snap.*

*Scrape.*

*Thud.*

The walls fold inward. The light flickers once.

It’s easier not to fight it anymore. Easier to breathe the same breath.

When I inhale, the room expands. When I exhale, it answers back.

Underneath it all—quiet, patient, loving—the rhythm continues.  

*Snap.*

*Scrape.*

*Thud.*
