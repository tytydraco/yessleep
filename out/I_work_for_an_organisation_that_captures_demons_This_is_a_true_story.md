I‘m not supposed to be sharing this. All of the work we do is strictly confidential, and for good reason too… If everyone knew about the things we deal with there would be mass hysteria or panic. It is better to enforce the lie that there is nothing abnormal… That the supernatural simply doesnt exist. However the things I encounter in the field are disturbing, and I feel like I would go insane if I continue to keep it to myself.

I work for an independent research firm that deals with the para-natural. Most people believe ghosts and demons are spirits and supernatural entities. That is far from reality. They are very much ‘alive’, and are made of flesh and blood…. at least in their corporeal states but it is not entirely correct to describe them as ‘biological’ entities. At least how we use that term. Almost everything about them defy our present understanding of biology. However they fit neatly into their own phylogenetic tree, as if they are shadows of our evolution, or as one of my colleagues puts it ‘a parody of the human experience.’

Many of these entities are content with keeping to themselves. Provided of course you dont go intruding on the abandoned mansions and secluded forests they inhabit. Invariably some idiot ends up stumbling into their territory and getting themselves killed. Then local police are sent to investigate and they end up calling us or similar organizations. You probably heard of the scp foundation? Well we are like them but we specialize in the things colloquially known as demons and ghosts while they are more generalized. In a way you could think of us as an independent extension of the scp, rather than a completely separate thing. Anyways, we relocate the entities if possible and if it proves to much of a hassle we simply put up warning signs and make up some mundane cause of death for the victims. Contrary to common belief most ghosts are not the tortured souls of humans that died a violent death. They are distinct creatures with many species and are similar in habit to squatters, or vermin. They move into secluded areas… but are always proximal to humanity, always in the periphery of civilization.

Its not known why they are attracted to human presence. There are many hypotheses, and one particular compelling one is they simply relish human fear and suffering.

One recent case I was assigned to a field team dispatched to neutralize an alleged ’Dawn Weeper’, a gynomorphic Category four, Physical. (gynomorphic is a term we use to describe entities that anatomically resemble women regardless of their sex, category 4 is a moderate threat, the higher the number the more dangerous, and ‘physical’, ‘spectral’ or ‘phasmopsychic’ refer to the natural state(s) of an an entity.)

It was rare for them to send researchers like me… usually field work is completed entirely by the Martial department, but some expeditions require scientific advise. I recall the team leader was particular in the fact he is a Spriggan... yes you heard me right. A Spriggan is a european relative of the wendigo. Contrary to popular belief many ’demons’  integrate well into society. Of course some spriggans and wendigo do live up to their kind’s bloodthirsty reputation, but they are not a monolith and many are content with consuming raw animal flesh rather than prey on humans. Contrary to common knowledge wendigo aren’t always terrifying gaunt monstrocities… The well kempt (and well fed) ones can be quite handsome… outside of their disturbingly deep set eyes, hollow cheeks and abnormally tall stature they almost pass as humans. There are female spriggans as well, but little is known about them. They live in sororities in the deep woods and dont interact with people; humans do not become wendigos through acts of cannibalism. They are their separate thing.

It is common for spriggans, vampires and other ‘civilized’ demons to be employed in the martial department. They are naturally, far stronger than humans, and are much faster in their movements. However they are usually only dispatched in the most dire expeditions. I recall feeling confused why they set a spriggan on a mere ‘Category Four, Physical’….

I would soon find out.

Stepping out of our helicopter and onto the site we were greeted by a macabre scene that almost made me give up my breakfast. We were at the lip of a clearing, there was torn burlap fabric and garbage bags strewn around, and bloodied human appendages lay limp on the gnarled weeds that banacled the ground. There was a ribcage with stringy morsels of flesh dangling from its bleached frame and remnants of a papery white dress which belonged to its owner, was still wrapped partially around it. Some distance away from us, partially concealed in the tree line was a makeshift shack cobbled together with rotten boards.

The team leader exhaled sharply and shook his head. His voice was authoritative but it was clear the carnage shook him. He uttered some military type jargon. His team nodded and they advanced towards the building. He turned towards me.

“labcoat, this is definitely not a category four. What the hell are we dealing with?” He barked

I paused for a moment. His remarks echoed my own thoughts.

“Well based on the description provided by the police… “ I blurted as I fumbled through the notes in my fanny pack.

“Ahh here we go! sighted at daybreak, Black tears streaming endlessly from empty black eye sockets, garbled crying of a woman, Black matted hair draping over face, and gaunt frame with putrid rag clothes, it matches the description of a dawn weeper… but this doesnt look like the work of a dawn weeper does it?” I asked rhetorically.

He nodded. Turning his head over to the shack as a member of the field team jogged out of the decrepit building.

“Sir! All clear, but Dr. Calfe should come look at this… artifact”

The team leader nudged me lightly on my shoulder and they escorted me to the shack. There was a pile of candy wrappers and tin cans piled up at the entrance which I did my best to step over. The shack was spatious, and the mid day light failed to illuminate its dark interior. There were no windows or openings in sight, only the entrance we used to enter the building.

“S-So despite their name Dawn weepers arent actually crepuscular, they dont like sunlight though so they typically stay in the shadows during day time” I exclaimed attempting to break the silence.

The team leader nodded as he shone his flashlight into a corner of the shack scanning for threats.

We walked for a few more minutes when we reached what may have once been a bedroom. A mess of boards were haphazardly piled together, blocking what must have been a second entrance to the structure, and light shown in through spidery gaps between the boards. There was no bed, but a wiry mass of branches, bone, and random pieces of fabric that made up some sort of a nest.

“This isnt the home of a Dawn Weeper…” I spoke with dread.

“Its a Generic IU isnt it?” The team leader inferred.

I nodded solemnly.

A Generic Identity Unknown, is something we pray we would not encounter. Not a specific ghost or demon, Generic IU is an umbrella term assigned to entities that have not been previously documented or encountered. Think of them like zero day vulnerabilities in computers.

Other members of the team pooled behind us. They were stonefaced and awaiting orders.

The team leader opened his mouth to speak before we all glanced behind us with congealed dread. We were tailed by interminable darkness. The entrance through which we entered was gone replaced by solid wooden planks that seemed to have always been there.

“Labcoat! What the hell is going on?” The teamleader yelled, a mix of fear and surpise resonated from his voice.

I wanted to reply ‘how should I know?’ but I knew it wouldnt help anyone.

“I suppose the IU may have a phasmopsychic state?” I replied thoughtfully.

Without hesitation the team members retrieved brown paper pouches from their suits and ingested the powdery substance enclosed inside. . It was a dehydrated decoction effective in  treating para-natural psychological disturbances. I followed suit.

I wish I hadn’t. As soon as I ingested the substance. I saw a gaunt spindly woman sillhouetted against the harsh afternoon sunlight streaming in through the entrance. With impossible speed it crept towards us, its body contorted into impossible angles accompanied by sickening crunch of bone which sounded like it was right beside me.

“Reminds me of a Kune kune” The field leader quipped.

“I wish it was a kune kune” I answered in jest.

“Shoot to kill!” He ordered.

The team didnt need any encouragement. Orange flashes erupted from their assault rifles as a barrage of silver alloy bullets tore into the flesh of the Generic IU. Chunks of pale clammy tissue splattered onto the ground, but the creature did not relent. As it reached us, I realized how impossibly tall it was, it stood at least seven feet from the ground. Greasy black hair erupted from pasty porcelain scalp, its emaciated body was veiled in yellowed rags which reeked of excrement and decay. True to the police description its eye sockets were empty holes so dark that it looked like they were painted on its face.

It emitted a muffled scream, that sounded like the croaking of a person being strangled. Flailing its lanky arms wildly it grabbed the soldier standing next to me. The Wraith tore a handful of bloody ribs out of his chest and he collapsed on the ground gasping in shock. The soldiers broke formation bullets whizzed through the air as the creature contorted its torso, deftly evading the projectiles.

The back of its hand connected with my waist and I felt excruciating pain stab through my abdomen. I dropped to the floor and the wraith loomed over me. Black bile gushed out of its eyes dribbling onto the back of my neck, and I felt it rake its finger down my spine…

I thought it was the end of me, but a violent force knocked me on my back and sent the creature reeling. Sprawled out like a starfish I weakly lifted my head and I saw the team leader barrel into the entity, his hands buried deep in the bullet wounds. The Wraith unleashed a guttural scream and flailed its arms madly in the air, desperately clawing at the team leader. Yellow streaks of light trailed from the glowing orange iris of the spriggan as he ripped a huge throbbing mass of organs and pink flesh from the Wraith’s sides. I crawled to my fanny pack which lay a few feet before me and made a note in my sketchbook.

‘Class seven: Androgynous, Physical, Phasmopsychic’ I jotted down with a trembling hand.

Medical personel arrived shortly at the scene. There was one casualty, and all of us were injured… minor things like broken ribs thankfully. Fortunately there was no evidence of biohazardous properties or ‘curses’. The creature’s remains were extracted and sent away for analysis and a cover up story was created to explain the civilian deaths.

I was shaken, but it was a nice interruption to the monotony of lab research, and I got to witness the discovery of a new species of ‘ghost.’
