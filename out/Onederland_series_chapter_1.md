Chapter 1

Red or Blue, Red or Blue,” she muses aloud with her nursery rhyme logic.


Next, she releases a handful of red and blue pills, which scatter like glass marbles on oak. She eagerly divides the two colors into separate piles and then snatches up the different colors in opposite hands. She was “told” she had at least a 50/50 shot of getting what she chose. Her choice was always what she wanted.
 

Dressed in her Tea outfit (she imagined it as wearing a costume), she was allowed entrance. The costume was rather scratchy, tight, and restricting. That’s not the important part though. The allure lies in the fantasy of who or what you become (to others and in your own mind).  It’s no different than dressing up as a ghoul or vampire for Halloweeen! …At least that how she sees it. 
 

Anna started nervously glancing back and forth between her enclosed fists. She wondered what would happen if she should make the wrong decision and everything that bad happens is directly because of her choice? Oh, How terrible that would be!  How could I find out if  my choices have negative effects? What questions would I ask? Then a giant honey  bee buzzed in front of her face and stopped her loose train of thought. Phew! Even thinking about other people exhausts me!
 

Anna gleefully peers into her pockets which hold the transforming pills. So…back to these pills…But I didn’t think these kind of pills worked like that. I figure I had already seen as much as possible being large. However, being small would open up unexplored tunnels to find treasure and meet new people.” I hope I get red,” she repeated like a silent mantra in her head as she excitedly jumped up and down on her tip-toes.
 

Just so you know, EVERYBODY in town is popping pills left and right like Pez Candy from a toy kitty head.” It’s the new wave of living!”  Ironic, trendy people whispered in back alleys. The street mice squeaked and “sqwerd” in agreement. 


Maybe this would be HER chance to WIN the treasure hunt. It was always someone else’s fault each time she didn’t win. If only “he” hadn’t …x,y,z. Why not win this time?! Theres no one else around to screw her up! What luck?


Anna loved taking the blue pills and feeling SO large and powerful. Nothing was out of her reach: no sweet, sauce, or biscuit. She could also drive an automobile. She could sit up straight, reach the pedals, and hold her hands at 10-and-2. She practically felt the breeze blew through her straw-colored locks. However, she had no interest in motor cars; she preferred to walk barefooted through the open meadows.
 

Oftentimes, she like pretending she was an adult where no one could tell her what to do, how to act , or what to think. She couldn’t wait to grow up and no longer be controlled. “Wouldn’t life be grande!” she surmised. 
 

It had been a little while since she was even able to get her mitts on the little red devil. She both tosses the pill and opens her mouth to nab the pill out of mid-air. This trick failed to amuse her mother, but she often caught Father emulating a wry smile. 
 

She decided to bring Fluffy—the albino, red-eyed, ultra-soft, but overfed rabbit—along for company. She remembered how boring it was having no one to talk to last time she went underground. Who would there be to verify what she learned and saw and in fact that she was the future victor of the treasure hunt? The rabbit made the perfect companion and witness. 


Anna’s mind drifted off again to wonder about Fluffy. She imagined asking him questions in “bunnyese”. “How can you see color if your eyes are red? Is everything you see some shade of red?” She imagined stumping him. 
 

Anna's head began to tingle and pulse with an aura— the signal that the pill was about to take effect—Poof!


First, a gossamer mist collected over Anna. Currents of air started to swirl and eddy counterclockwise until the mist gathered into an apparent mini cyclone. It illuminated progressively brighter until it reflected pink light. The rays grew more and more intense until the whole tunnel was lit in a blinding pink light. Once the intensity peaked, the rays diffused immediately and the once-illuminated mist seemly evaporated into the cool damp tunnel air.


It all happened so quickly that it seemed as an imperceptibly small smoke-like cloud encircled Anna (and caused the shrinkage). “It wasn’t magic but rather modern science,” she stated as if she had direct knowledge. 
 

She grasped  Fluffy’s leash and dragged him down into the abyss. 

 
They swirled down for seemingly forever. What was distorting time through space?
 

Did the Timemaster play with the clocks of time? During the fall, she lost all concept of how much time had passed. It seems like hours passed but she knew it only took a minute in reality. 
 

The TimeMaster used the brocade as a backdoor entrance into his chrono-chemystry. What he termed his science—which he used to manipulate time in his lab (and space nearby). 
 

He lived somewhere between the two planes of existence. You could only meet him by traversing these planes. 


Poem 

 
She asked him if time would stop
Giving the human nature of The Clock
Or if time didn’t care of you died any day
People went to work and children still played
