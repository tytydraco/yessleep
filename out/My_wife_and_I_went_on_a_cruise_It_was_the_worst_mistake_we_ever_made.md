I woke up to my wife sobbing gently in the bed beside me. Our tiny passenger cabin on the cruise liner acted like an echo chamber turning her gentle weeping into echoed cries. When I opened my eyes, the soft light from under the door illuminated the room in a soft light that sent thin shadows crawling up the walls.

My eyes focused in the darkness to see Nancy sitting up in bed. She was clutching the phone from our bedside table in her hands. A soft voice was speaking through the earpiece, but I couldn’t understand what they were saying.

“Nancy,” I said in a gentle tone. “Is everything alright?”

“I don’t know, Marvin,” she replied. “I’m scared.”

“Who is on the phone?” I asked, pushing myself up into a sitting position. “Something wrong with the kids back home?”

Nancy’s muffled crying morphed into defined wails when I mentioned the children. That cruise was the first time since we had the kids that we had taken a trip without them. It was our tenth-anniversary celebration and we decided to make it just the two of us.

I’m glad we didn’t bring them. Who knows if they would have made it back home?

“Can you tell me what’s wrong, sweety?” I asked again.

She opened her mouth to answer but nothing but mournful sounds came out. I tried to give her a minute to collect herself, but her composure didn’t return. Gently, I pulled the phone from her hand and held it to my ear.

*This is the Sea Lantern Cruise Line information center! We regret to inform you that multiple cases of norovirus have been reported aboard the ship. At this time we will be instituting a lockdown measure to slow the spread of the infection.* 

*All passengers are to remain in their rooms until inspected by SLCL medical personnel. If you are suffering from vomiting, diarrhea, or cramping, please report this to medical staff during your checkup. You will be reimbursed for any and all ports of call canceled due to this unfortunate event.* 

*Thank you for choosing Sea Lantern Cruise Lines. You may hang up now. This message will play on a loop.*

*This is Sea Lantern Cruise Line…*

I leaned across Nancy and sat the phone back on the hook. Pulling her close, I squeezed her tightly to my side and felt her body shudder with no silent tears. She clutched my leg and I could feel her nails begin to sink into my skin.

“Easy, Nancy!” I proclaimed as I reached down to check if she had broken my skin. “What has you so worked up? Norovirus is no big deal!”

Nancy sat up and turned her head toward me. Even in the dim light, I could see the fear in her eyes. Her jaw quivered as she tried to find her voice.

“I know it isn’t a big deal, Marvin,” she replied shakily. “We went on a cruise with the kids two years back. There was a big outbreak of norovirus then, too. The ship didn’t go on lockdown.”

I ran my hands through my hair. She was right. The captain had made a few announcements over the loudspeaker of the ship, but life had gone on as normal. A few of the onboard bars and restaurants had closed, but otherwise, there hadn’t been a change.

“We were on a different line that time,” I said in an attempt to soothe her fears. My tone was probably unconvincing as my mind began to untangle the troubled thoughts creeping around inside. “It’s probably just a company policy. Let’s try and get some sleep before some rent-a-doc comes to knock on the door and take our temperature.”

Nancy muttered in agreement and put her head back on her pillow. I stretched myself back out on the too-small bed and pulled the covers up to my shoulder. The steady hum of the engine lulled us both back to sleep.

I woke again to the sound of muffled screams. My pulse quickened as I jolted up in the bed. Sitting stone still, I listened intently for another outburst, but none came.

Only the constant hum of the massive engines.

It had been something in my dream, I thought to myself and settled back down into the bed again. Nancy was snoring peacefully beside me and I placed my hand on her back. She shifted her body as she shrugged the blanket off of her shoulder. The rise and fall of her back as she breathed helped to slow the panicked thumps from my heart.

*Sympathy panic, Marvin. That’s all it is. Nancy got a little worried earlier and it spooked you too. Calm down and go back to bed. This vacation will be gone before you know it.*

Just as I was settling in, I heard someone knocking heavily on a cabin door in the hall followed by a loud voice. Through the door, I couldn’t quite hear what they were saying. It was the medical team, I thought. Making rounds to put all of this silly business behind us.

I gently stood from the bed and crept to the door, placing my ear against the cold wood.

The voice of two men filled the hallway.

“One soul lost and one awaiting treatment.,” said the first man. The sound of flipping pages followed. “Male and female. David and Joyce Carmichaels.”

“I’ll call for the removal team,” said the second man. “Which one needs treatment? The man or the woman.”

“The man,” the first one replied. “He’s pretty weak.”

I could hear one of the men walk back into the cabin before the single gunshot resounded. 

I fell onto the floor in shock.

“Treatment complete,” said man number two. “Last cabin on this floor. Looks like Marvin and Nancy Compton. Pop the door.”

White noise filled my ears as I heard a plastic keycard slap against the magnetic lock of our door. The heavy wooden barrier pushed in and light flooded through the opening. Two men dressed in Hazmat suits stood in front of me. The man in the rear had a gun.

“Good evening, Mr. Compton,” said the first man. “Are you or your wife feeling ill?”

A medical team wearing the same hazmat suits came to our room and examined us. It seemed to shock them to find us in perfect health, terrified as we were.

They had us put on two hazmat suits and raced us to the elevator. Two men escorted us down the main hallway and through the empty lobby and onto the main deck. We didn’t see a single soul other than the medical team.

No matter how many questions we asked, they remained silent.

We approached a helicopter that sat idling on the deck. Lounge chairs and white towels sat scattered all around. The team pushed us into the chopper where we belted up and lifted into the sky. Nancy clung to me more tightly than she ever had before.

As we moved over the side of the ship, it finally made sense. Why we hadn’t seen anyone else.

On the deck were bright white body bags. [Thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/) of them.
