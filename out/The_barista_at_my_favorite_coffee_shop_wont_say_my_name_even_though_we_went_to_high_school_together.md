There’s a coffee shop downtown next to the park. If you go there at the right time, you can avoid the early morning rush. But arrive too late? You’re stuck behind a long line of hipsters.

I like the place because it’s five minutes from my apartment. Just a straight walk out the door and a few minutes later, I’m sipping the best latte in Southern California.

But the one thing that irks me about the place is the barista, Steve.

He never remembers my name, even though we went to high school together. I mean, sure. People drift apart. Times change. But we were close for a couple years, until he transferred out to another school.

It just seemed odd to reconnect and…no matter how many times I reminded him…he never recalled my name.

This whole ordeal started last summer. I had just started a new job and was eager to impress my boss. I hustled into the cafe, workbag slung over my shoulder, and heard: “Hey, it’s you.”

I recognized the voice instantly. “Steve?”

Sure enough, Steve was behind the counter, making drinks. He still had that trademark curly hair and thick glasses, like he was straight out of Silicon Valley.

“Nice to see you, man…”

We made our reintroductions, and I ordered. Everything seemed normal at first, but when he went to write down my name, he hesitated. “I’m sorry, what’s your name again?”

“Harry.”

“That’s right. How could I forget?”

He wrote it down and I paid. That was that.

Weeks turned into months. Steve was there almost every morning. Each time, I’d have to remind him as confusion spread across his face.  

“It’s Harry, remember?”

“Right. Silly me.”

He’d scribble my name on the cup, and I’d play it off. But if I was being honest, it bothered me. And the more it happened, the angrier I got.

One day, I built up enough courage to ask him: “Steve, what’s going on, man? We’ve interacted for, like, three months. You still don’t remember my name.”

“No. I’m sorry.”

“We hung out every day in high school.”

“Yeah. Trippy.”

“I think that’s pretty odd.”

“Must be a confusing name.”

“Harry?!”

“I understand your frustration. I’ll do better. I promise.”

I left the shop, annoyed, but satisfied that he’d sworn to try harder.

That promise didn’t last long.

The next day, the same thing happened. I was so irritated!

I decided to confront Steve, once and for all, but this time, outside the coffee shop.

I waited in the park across the street. Watched him exit the cafe at four fifteen.

He must’ve lived nearby because he didn’t climb into any cars or call a rideshare. He just slung his backpack over his shoulder, headed for downtown.

I trailed him for about five blocks before I finally called out. “Steve!”

He stopped and raked his gaze toward me. “Hey! It’s —”

And then it happened…his mind blanked.

“— Harry!”

“Right. Right. I’m sorry. What’s up, Bud?”

I hurried to his position, doing my best to act calm.

“Look, Steve, this might not be a big deal, but I have to ask. What’s with the name thing?”

“The name thing?”

“Why can’t you remember my name?!”

At this, Steve’s eyes widened and his lips twitched. He arched his back like he was in severe pain.

“Steve, you okay?”

“Yes. I’m okay.” His voice sounded strange, robotic. “What were you asking me?”

“It’s just weird that I’ve been coming to your shop for four months. Every time I order you forget my name. I have to remind you each time. I just wanted to know…are you trolling me? Did I piss you off in high school and now you’re getting back at me?”

“Oh no,” Steve said. “It’s not that at all. It’s just…”

He started hitting his chest, like he was having a panic attack.

“Steve, relax. I didn’t mean to freak you out—”

“Your name is Harry. Your name is Harry. Your name is Harry.”

“Steve! Chill!”

“YournameisHarry. YournameisHarry. YournameisHarry.”

I grabbed Steve’s arm, trying to calm him.

But he tore free, started running in a circle.

I was so creeped out. I backed away. My voice soft and measured.

“Look, Steve. I’m sorry I stressed you out. Let’s forget we had this conversation.”

I disappeared around the corner. I could still hear him repeating:

“YournameisHarry. YournameisHarry. YournameisHarry.”

That night, I arrived at my apartment, exhausted. Flopped down on the couch. Opened my computer to catch up on work.

All I could think about was Steve’s reaction. What the hell was wrong with him?

After finishing my work, I showered, got ready for bed, and turned on the TV to stream a movie. God knows how long I watched it before falling asleep.

Sometime later, I jerked awake to the sound of movement in the kitchen.

PFT-PFT-PFT. It resembled footsteps, shifting along the tile of my dining room.

PFT-PFT-PFT. I glanced at the ceiling. Was it my upstairs neighbor? No.

I glanced at the clock: 2:30 am.  

PFT-PFT-PFT. The hell?

I grabbed the golf club near my bed, ventured to my doorway, sweating.

The strange movements accelerated.

I wondered if it was a rat, searching for food.  

“Hello? Anyone in here?”

I flipped on my kitchen light in the hall.  

CLICK. The entire kitchen and dining area lit up.

I searched every corner of the apartment. Opened each drawer and cabinet, wondering: what was that? A mouse? A bat?

I didn’t find anything, so I shut off the lights. Went back to bed. But this time…

…I placed the golf club a little closer to my nightstand…

…and plugged in a nightlight for good measure…

It was a few hours later when I awoke to more sounds in my bedroom.  

PFT-PFT-PFT. PFT-PFT-PFT.

I opened my eyes. A humanoid shape stood at the end of my bed. Breathing heavily.

“Hello?” I gasped, my voice tight with fear. Then —

CREAK. The shape lowered itself onto the bed.

I reached for my club. But a firm hand gripped my wrist.

Another slapped down over my mouth, silencing me.

There was just enough glow from my nightlight to make out the intruder’s face —  

— it was Steve —

“Give me your name, Harry.”
