[\[Part 43\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1o668ky/the_call_of_the_breach_part_43/)

Even with my eyes shut, the flash was blinding.

A bright white burst tore across the landscape, the shockwave rattled my bones, and clouds of debris flew over our little section of trench as Jamie and I cowered at the bottom. I pressed my hands to both ears, turned my face to the mud to protect my eyes, and screamed with a voice I couldn’t hear above the explosions.

Searing heat came in the next millisecond, like a bonfire that we were too close to, and the air itself became unbreathable. My lungs twitched as though I were trapped underwater, the gasps painful in my throat, and the dirt under me shook with massive sledgehammer blows from each detonation. I had no idea if Jamie still lay beside me, the entire world now confined to the insides of my skull, arms and legs curled up in a vain attempt to ward off the inferno.

An eternity passed, a lifetime of choking, screaming, burning, cold mud on one side and terrible flame on the other. My mind fuzzed with panic, all resolve gone, courage melted like snow in the missiles’ path. I wanted to pass out. I wanted to die. I wanted anything, if it let me escape.

*Adonai, please . . .*

Like a giant invisible switch had been thrown, deafening silence rang in my ears, my throat constricted with several hard coughs, followed by a steady rain of ash and debris from the sky. My body spasmed, pain spread across my left side, and the heat lost some of its intensity.

Sharp twinges on my hand made me groan, and both eyes flew open.

*Fire. I’m on fire.*

My homemade uniform had combusted under the onslaught, little flames chewing at the green material on the shoulder, back, and left sleeve. Scorch marks had turned my pant leg on that side grayish-black, and one of my boots smoked from the rubbing oil melting away. The sour scent of my hair told me the lower part of my ponytail had met its end in a similar fashion, and I lunged for the nearest wet spot in the mud with a dry, strangled yelp.

Rolling around in the soupy morass, I gasped in relief as the flames went out, smothered by the damp filth. Pangs in various places on my skin told me I’d taken a few burns, but all four limbs moved, and I could still see, so I guessed I was alive.

*I need air.*

Stunned, each breath short and tainted by pockets of smoke, I pulled myself up the ragged edge of the trench and found a clean breeze waiting for me. It felt better than anything I’d ever tasted, cool and fresh on my sore throat, but the victory was short lived as my bleary eyes adjusted to the gloom.

What had once been a green forested valley typical of southeastern Ohio was now a wasteland of craters, churned mud, a few steaming pools of snowmelt, and flames. Fire blackened tree trunks lay scattered across the valley floor like broken toothpicks, and the ones left standing toppled over one-by-one in the winter wind, groaning as the charred wood gave out to the pull of gravity. Flash-rusted hulks showed where vehicles had been, both ours and ELSAR’s, none left running in the no-man’s-land before the ridgeline. Every bush had turned to ash, the grass all gone, not so much as a twig left untouched. The scorched zone must have run for a mile or more in every direction, an enormous dark spot on the weary earth that smoldered with the stench of cooked flesh.

Panic, confusion, and realization hit me all at once, both legs shaking beneath me. My knees buckled, and I slumped onto the reddish-brown clay, chest aching in a way that no bullet or shrapnel could inflict.

*No one could survive that.*

Overhead, steel rotors whirred closer, and my head swam as the adrenaline left my system.

I turned to find Jamie motionless in the trench behind me and crawled to pull her from the mire. “Jamie? Jamie, wake up. We have to go, come on.”

*Whop, whop, whop, whop.*

Like phantoms in a child’s nightmare, two dozen black shapes swept down from the clouds to land across the valley, others circling overhead, while one team headed for the ridgeline. The helicopters were loaded down with rocket launch pods, and in the doors of the transports I saw multiple air assault troops ready to deploy on the ends of their safety harnesses. Those deployed in the valley moved in coordinated squads, and as they began to pick through the bodies on the field, it hit me what they were doing.

Clean Sweep was entering its final stages.

“We have to go.” I crouched low to stay out of sight, knowing they had night vision equipment and thermal sensors on their helicopters to see everything we could not. With hands that didn’t feel like my own, I groped in the shadows for my Type 9 and bumped something in the snowmelt.

As I lifted the weapon up, I fought the urge to sigh in heartbroken disappointment.

My trusty little submachine gun had been across my chest when Jamie tackled me into the trench, but now its tubular receiver lay split open, an enormous chunk of cooling shrapnel lodged in the steel. It would have been a death blow to me had the jagged piece of metal gotten past the gun, but without a shop and a welder, it was basically useless scrap now. The bolt couldn’t go forward, the receiver was bent, and even the magazine was stuck in place. Without my Type 9, all I had left was the Mauser pistol clone Andrew made for me all those weeks ago in New Wilderness, one copied off Chris’s sidearm, yet another reminder of everything I’d lost.

From the inky sky, two helicopters hovered lower to drop their ropes, and squads of enemy soldiers descended onto the ridge.

*Bang.*

One of our wounded tried to reach for his gun and was shot, the assault teams moving forward to disarm the bodies as they went. Sporadic fire began to pick up from the opposite end of the hill we sat on, but I knew that those men were too far away to reach us in time.

I knelt beside Jamie and ran my palms over her, feeling for anything sharp or ragged. Four fingers came away from the back of her head slick with new blood, and my heart sank.

*She needs a medic. That’s a bad concussion at minimum. If her skull is cracked . . .*

At the nearest landing site, a third Blackhawk landed directly amongst the perimeter of assault troops, and the doors slid open to reveal a team of five Auxiliaries. They climbed out to join their comrades, and as they did, I noted how the figure in the center barked orders to the rest with absolute surety, the shouts inaudible above the helicopter engines.

I didn’t need to let my vision sharpen to know it was *her*.

Red hot anger boiled under my skin, and I stooped to pry Jamie’s grimy Kalashnikov from the earth, lifting the gun to my shoulder. They weren’t far, maybe a hundred yards or so, and with the multiple small brush fires I had decent visibility.

The wind kicked up, cold and wet, while I propped the Ak on the edge of the trench to line up the sights on Crow’s helmet, knowing no amount of Kevlar could stop a rifle round this close. She’d killed Tex, she’d tortured Kaba, and her rockets had killed my husband. There was no way I would let this chance pass me by. Crow couldn’t be allowed to live.

*Ow.*

Something stuck into my side, and I glanced down to see the muddy canvas sling bag at my hip, with the launch panel still folded between layers of plastic to shield it from the moisture. Its metal corners poked me just below my ribs, and I understood then just what a fool I’d been, how close I had come to dooming us all. Sure, I could easily take down Crow with one shot, but then her entire assault force would know where I was. They would storm this trench, kill me, capture Jamie, and take the launch panel for themselves. Koranti would have the nukes, we would be leaderless, and my best friend would likely be tortured for the rest of her life by the ghouls of the Auxiliary Forces.

Biting my lower lip in exasperation, I lowered the gun and slid back into the trench next to Jamie.

*Okay . . . new plan.*

I dug into my war belt and found the last bandage I had, using it to wrap the cut on her head. Jamie didn’t stir, her breathing slow and regular, but I knew in this temperature her soaked clothes were our biggest enemy. Hypothermia wasn’t far off for either of us, and if I couldn’t get her to somewhere warm and dry soon, it would be over.

By contrast, my jacket remained somewhat dry on the inside, so I used it to cover her up as best I could and propped Jamie on a ledge in the mud above the meltwater. Icy gusts savaged my exposed neck, the long sleeve shirt underneath barely enough to keep the cold at bay. Still, I dragged two corpses from the next foxhole over and laid them on top of Jamie in a jumbled pile, in the hope that it would be enough to make our enemies overlook them. This done, I shrugged off the canvas sling bag, jerked the two little keys from the panel, and stowed them in a pouch on my belt. The panel went under the stack of bodies, held by Jamie’s curled arms beneath my coat to protect it from the elements. With any luck, the enemy wouldn’t catch us both, and if Jamie survived, she could carry the panel to safety.

*Please, God, don’t let them find her.*

“I’ll be back.” Emotion tightened in my throat while I brushed some bleach-blonder hair from Jamie’s face and thought back to the night she and Chris had rescued me from that pile of moldy shoes. “Just sit tight, okay? This won’t take long.”

With the AK in hand, I crept through the flooded trench, shoulders hunched against the cold as I tried to formulate my next move. The demolition bunker had been somewhere close by before the shelling. I had to find it and set off the charges to blow the pass. If I could manage that, perhaps the explosion would be enough to distract Crow’s men so that I could drag Jamie to the southern cliffside. I would lower her with ropes, vines, anything I could find, and once we were safely on the ground, build a crude sled. We survived the southlands once, and I could do it again; I would do whatever it took to save her life, even if I had to walk all the way to Ark River through knee-deep snow.

First, I had to avoid being shot.

Like a snake, I wriggled over the top of the trench and inched forward on my belly in the frigid muck, hauling the rifle with on hand to avoid jamming dirt into its muzzle. There were soldiers everywhere it seemed, and I resorted to dragging myself through waterlogged shell holes, collapsed sections of trench line, and across fallen debris to avoid being spotted. At last, the leftmost end of our flank came into view through the gloom, and I headed toward the low-slung roof of logs that made up the bunker.

“Clear.” A gruff male voice came from my left, and terror oozed through my veins as boots slogged in the mud close by.

There were three of them, Auxiliary helicopter troops in gray uniforms with the usual armored vests and helmets, making their way toward me as they checked the dead for weapons. If I stood up to run, they would spot me in a second. If I opened fire on the men, more would be drawn to my location, and I would be overrun. If I stayed where I was, they would be right on top of me in a few moments. I had to do something, anything, but my brain seemed to be out of good ideas.

*Come on Hannah, think, think, think.*

At the last second, my eyes landed on a nearby machine gun pit, and the grisly heap of corpses that had once its defenders. They’d taken a direct hit from a mortar round, the men awash in their own viscera, a jumbled pile of arms, legs, and shredded clothing. None moved, nor would they ever again, but even in death I realized they might still serve our cause.

Wriggling over to the pit, I forced back a series of horrid gags as I slithered down amongst them, the cooled blood smearing on my face, hands, and neck. Its coppery scent mixed with the rankness of loosened bowels from the dead to create a suffocating stench. The corpses weighed heavy in a macabre blanket of repulsive gore, some making hushed groans as I pushed on them, expelled air from their lungs like the wails of old-fashioned ghosts. In my blind burrowing, the taste of death crossed my chapped lips, forcing me to spit to keep the blood from running into my mouth. My stomach heaved in revolt, the situation unbearable, but I swallowed what bile attempted to rise and dove further into the grave.

Slick guts met the palm of my right hand as it sank into the torn abdomen of a dead ranger, and I almost passed out from the nausea.

“There’s more over here.” One of the auxiliaries called, and their boots squelched closer.

A terrible thought chose that moment to cross my mind; even as muddy, bloody, and ragged as I was, I in no way looked as dead as the men around me. Fr this to work, I had to camouflage myself further, and a glance at the dead man whose guts lay out his front solidified my decision.

*Forgive me; I have no choice.*

With trembling fingers, I reached through the abyss and pushed my hand into his shattered torso.

In the days before New Wilderness had fallen, before my infection, before so much had changed the way I saw the world, Jamie had taught me basic hunting skills, field dressing in particular. We’d practiced gutting animals that had been killed for the butcher’s stalls in the market, since I had not been ready to venture beyond the walls at that time, and it proved to be a dirty job. You became very acquainted with the way fat slipped through your fingers, how sinew sounded when it snapped loose, or the sensation of connective tissue ripping under a hard pull. This occasion had proven to me why Ranger girls trimmed their nails short; even after I’d washed my hands several times, I still managed to picked chunks of viscera out from under my fingernails for hours on end, and the light smell of pig fat lingered there for an entire day afterward. That had been an unpleasant but necessary experience.

This . . . this was hell.

I kept my eyes screwed shut, mainly as a way to prevent myself from vomiting, since I could hardly see anything in the pitch blackness anyway. My hand gathered fistfuls of ropey intestines to drape over my shirtfront, some loose enough to come without a fight, others still connected by fat and muscle. At each gouge my fingertips grazed the underside of a lung, bones from the spinal cord poked at my chipped fingernails, and things broke free at my insistent tugs with wet *slurps*. Teeth gritted against a thousand screaming voices in my head, I laid some loose flaps of torn skin on my face, scooped pooled blood into my clothes to hide the lack of open wounds, and rolled one of the corpses atop my back as I lay on my side. This done, I shoved Jamie’s AK and my war belt underneath me and stretched out beside the eviscerated corpse just as the first jackboot crested the edge of the trench.

Heart pounding like a metronome in my chest, I relaxed my closed eyelids to look more natural and went limp.

“Clear.” One of the men above grunted in disgust. “Whew, those mortars really tore em up. That smell’s gonna be stuck in my nose for days.”

The second auxiliary jumped into the machine gun pit, his boots making a dull *thud* on the corpses, and he rifled through the pockets of the man who lay across my back. “Check and see if the others have any good loot. Norman found a 14-carat diamond on a dead chick the other day, *fourteen carats*. Can you imagine wasting that kind of money on worms like these?”

A third voice chimed in, this one skeptical and irate. “I’m not digging through a bunch of dead terrorists for knockoff jewelry. They probably have tons of lice, maybe fleas. Seriously, get out of there, you’ll get AIDS or some shit.”

Doing my best not to move, I prayed like mad that they wouldn’t choose to roll me over. If they found my gear and took the launch keys, everything would be lost. If they discovered I was alive, the best thing I could do would be to stick the muzzle of Jamie’s AK in my mouth. I’d seen Organ cruelty before, knew what they were capable of, and from the way they spoke of our coalition, they wouldn’t hesitate to gut me like a rabid dog if I so much as flinched. My lungs burned, the slight, shallow breaths I took not enough to sustain me, and I knew I would have to gulp down a full one sooner or later. It felt like drowning, but I had no idea when I could surface again, the enemy mere inches away.

*Don’t breathe, don’t breathe, don’t’ breathe . . .*

“Ooh, this one’s still warm.” A rough hand groped the back of my trousers, and the looter in the pit shoved my legs aside to search the corpse underneath me, bracing a nonchalant hand on my hip as if I were a rock or tree stump. “And relax, will you? With how cold it is, any bugs they got will die soon. Besides, you want to leave it all behind for the logistics guys? We killed them, so their stuff is ours, fair and square.”

The first man let out an impatient sigh, and I heard a rifle safety switch off with a dull *click.* “At least make sure they’re dead before you go feeling em up. If we miss something and General McGregor finds out, she’ll shoot all three of us. I’m not covering for you if they search your pack and—”

*Whoosh*

*Boom.*

Something whistled overhead, and an explosion rippled through the ground.

“Contact front!” The first man shouted, and their rifles barked to life, raining hot brass all over the corpses and myself. The ones that landed on my exposed hands, face, and neck burned enough to make me wince out of reflex, but I forced myself not to move, even as the pain in my skin pinched like wasp stings.

“Flank right, go, go, go!” The third man shouted, and all three Organs dashed away from the pit as gunfire erupted over the hillside again, remnants of our forces opening up from somewhere across the ridge.

As soon as they left, I freed myself from the smother of dead limbs and gasped for air, swatting hot casings from my collar and hair. The stink of death rose fresh in my nose, and I fought hard not to vomit as I dug my weapons from their hiding place. This time, however, my stomach won out, and I leaned over to empty what little I had in me onto the mud, head swimming with dehydration. My guts hurt, exhaustion clawed at my mind, and the cold was taking its toll. If I contracted a sickness from this, it could very well finish me off before a bullet would.

*Keep moving, ranger, this isn’t over yet.*

Onward I went, crawling on my stomach like a lizard, until I slid over the ruined parapet of our leftmost trench position and down into the entrance of the demolitions bunker.

Truth be told, “bunker’ was a rather generous term for what was little more than a glorified hole in the ground covered with logs for a roof. A viewing slit had been hacked into one side of the dugout overlooking the pass between the ridgeline below, and a doorway cut into the opposite end to access the trenches. Some old wooden crates had been used as seats by the observers, but they were overturned on the floor, the rangers gone. I had no idea if they were alive or dead, but from the way they’d left the detonators, hooked up and still under their protective tarpaulin against the far wall, I figured they weren’t coming back to their post.

With one hand, I tugged aside the tarp and stared at the detonators in the gloom. They seemed unharmed, the batteries in place, the wires uncut. I had no clue if the wires buried under the snow to the multiple charges were still intact, or if the charges themselves were, but I had to hope.

Kneeling, I flipped the safety release switch on the side to see the little red warning light come on, indicating the unit had power.

I lifted my head to peer out the viewing slit, searching the shadows of the valley for any sign of movement. None came, save for the teams of ELSAR troops roving across it in slow, deliberate patrols to look for survivors.

Tears brimmed in my eyes, but I gripped the wooden plunger to yank it upward into the *ready* position.

*Goodbye, my love.*

With a strangled sob, I shoved the handle down with a metallic *zip* of little winding gears\*.\*

*Ba-room.*

Huge geysers of dirt flew into the night sky like great dragons of mud, blotting out the stars overhead. One by one, I did the same with the other two detonators, and the ringing in my ears throbbed as the earth trembled under my boots. Dirt and snowmelt rained from the log ceiling, but as the last of the explosions died, I squinted over the viewing parapet to check my handiwork.

The pass, with its destroyed armored vehicles, bodies, and shell holes, was no more. Huge mudslides had sealed off the road with piles of rock and dirt close to thirty feet high. It would take weeks to clear with the heaviest of bulldozers, and I knew ELSAR didn’t have that much time. Soon, Barron County wouldn’t exist in our world anymore, and once we ended up in our destination, the enemy would no longer have the resources they had access to now.

*Okay, time to go get Jamie, and run like hell.*

I ducked out the bunker door and hoisted myself onto the muddy battlefield once more. Gunfire whirred back and forth, more reinforcements from our side moving in from somewhere to the east, and the enemy helicopters did their best to lift off before they were destroyed. One already burned in the nearest landing zone, and more rockets streaked from the trees to smash others from the sky.

Looking around, I didn’t see anyone nearby, and crept forward, daring to crouch instead of crawl. I hadn’t expected to get this far, and my success buoyed my confidence. Maybe we could survive this after all.

Spotting a break in the intense fire, I decided to seize my chance, and sprinted over a small clearing between shell holes.

*Whack.*

A stream of bullets impacted on a stone to my right, and something bit into my right ankle with a whit hot flare of pain.

The rifle flew from my hands, my momentum betrayed me, and I cried out in pain as I crumpled to the muck. Hot blood oozed down the insides of my combat boot, and I knew with a sinking feeling I’d been hit.

Through the murky night, a slender figure jogged my way from the direction of the burned helicopter, an M4 carbine in hand.

I tried to drag myself out of sight, swept the ground around me in search of Jamie’s rifle, but found nothing.

*Oh no.*

With one shaking hand, I drew my pistol, but a sudden kick to my ribs sent me rolling.

Prying the gun from my fingers, Crow unbuckled her helmet to toss it aside and slid one hand to her plate carrier to draw a gleaming combat knife. “Got you.”
