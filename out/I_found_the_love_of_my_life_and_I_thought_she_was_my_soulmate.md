**I met my wife a long time ago and thought our life was perfect. Our life was perfect until I discovered something horrible.** 

So I was 18 years old at this time of my life and I wanted to marry someone really badly. I went to bars a lot to search for a woman suitable for me. I wanted a loving, caring and motherly woman who would care for our kids. 

I wanted to have at least two children. 

So one night I went to this bar. I believe it was called Craig’s bar and restaurant. It was a nice small and cozy place where you could drink in peace and have good conversations with people without the music being too loud. There were people dancing on the dance floor. Then I spotted this beautiful woman.

 She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. She had long hair that was a deep red colour. Amazing facial features and an astonishing body. I felt butterflies.  
  
I got nervous as I realized that I had to go talk to her. I shook off the nerves and approached her. ‘’ Hey, What’s up?’’ I started casually. Her answer took a while but then she said ‘’Nothing much. Just vibing’’. I could feel that she found me attractive. “Want to grab a drink with me?” I asked. Took a lot of courage to get those words out but I was glad I did. “Sure!” 

We walked to the bar counter and I ordered a beer and she ordered a cider. After that we got ourselves a table and sat down. We talked about life and about everything. I fell in love, I could feel we had good chemistry and I asked for her number but she insisted that I’d spend the night at her place and so I did. Nothing sexual happened but we slept in the same bed and the conversation that started at the bar didn’t end until we fell asleep.  
  
Her name was Rosanne and she had really beautiful green eyes I couldn’t see at the bar. They almost looked like they belonged to a snake.

The next morning I woke up feeling like shit. “Heyy! You’re up” she yelled all excitedly. I flinched as I thought I was home alone. “Hey! you scared me,” I told her and barely got a word out as my mouth was so dry. “Did you sleep well?” I asked. “Yep” she told me and went to the kitchen.  
  
She came back in 15 minutes and brought me breakfast to bed. ‘’Ohhh nice! Thank you so much’’ I said to her while giggling like a little kid.‘’I love cooking and I thought you deserved a homemade breakfast’’ She answered and blushed. So we spent the whole day in bed and I spent another night there. The next day I went home and talked to her on the phone. Actually after those two nights spent there I called her every day. We usually talked for a couple of hours and got to know each other so well. We also went on dates every other weekend. She was perfect for me. I wanted her to be my wife and soulmate for the rest of my life. I was also perfect for her or so I thought. It felt so sudden, how could I fall in love so quickly?

A year goes by and it was awesome. I proposed and we got married. The wedding was small and modest. We invited only a handful of people and it went really well. It was simple but effective. At one point my wife disappeared and came back hours later. It was weird and a bit rude to the guests. Her dad came to me at one point and said ‘’Where is Rosanne? She always disappears at the worst moments.’’ Whatever that meant.  
  
She seemed completely normal after she was back. At one point though I was sure I saw her pickup a frog and put it in her pocket. “What is she going to do with that?” I thought but left it at that. I figured she was just drunk and wanted to prank me as I was pretty drunk too.  I can’t even remember anything after that. The wedding was perfect.A month later we were out eating at a restaurant. ‘’How do you feel about having kids?’’ I asked.   
  
I had been thinking of having kids for six months and she would make the perfect mother. ‘’I don’t like kids. They are loud and they smell,’’ She answered. ‘’Have you thought about us having kids? I would love to have at least one,’’ I told her all excitedly. ‘’No my darling. I don’t think that is such a good idea,’’ she told me. I was dumbfounded.‘’What do you mean?’’ I asked. She told me that she can’t be around kids for some reason but I deserved them and some day she would be ready. The woman I married didn’t want kids with me, why?  
  
We left the conversation at that. I kept thinking about it for a couple of weeks but figured out she would tell me when she was ready for kids. 

After that night she woke me up by bringing me breakfast. ‘’Good morning my handsome prince’’ She said and gave me a plate full of eggs. bacon and beans. ‘’That was really kind of you my dear’’ I told her while smiling very widely. She always made me breakfast on the weekends. It was the best.

The next week, my wife disappeared again. It was Saturday and we watched a movie on our couch. Suddenly she leaves in a hurry and the weirdest thing is that she didn’t even say anything, she just left. She came back 3 hours later. It was almost midnight and that was weird.  
  
I was just watching the movie alone when all of a sudden I heard. “Babe, want to go upstairs?” I jumped so high that I hit my head on the lamp. “Woah, where did you go?” I asked while visibly annoyed. “Don’t worry about it my darling” She calmly told me.  
  
I did not go upstairs with her that night as I was pretty mad at her for leaving during the date night we had planned. I slept on the couch that night and I reconsidered our relationship the whole night.I kept debating with myself about whether I should stay or leave as this was deeply unsettling. It was a huge red flag,  
  
I had thoughts about her cheating on me but I married her so I trusted her and it was just a passing thought. 

The next week a similar thing happened. We were supposed to go eat dinner at a restaurant. I had reserved a table at a very high end restaurant. I was excited because I saved a lot of money for this specific date night. As we are leaving to the restaurant she says “I need to use the bathroom, go start the car.” I do just that and around 15 minutes go by. I began to wonder, where is she? How is she taking so long? 

I waited another 15 minutes. Nothing. She didn’t come back so I decided to go check out what is going on and why is she taking so long.

I went inside and walked upstairs to our bedroom. I thought she would be there putting on more makeup or doing some finishing touches, maybe even doing her hair over and over. I walk in and she’s not there. Only thing I see are her clothes on the floor.   
  
The same clothes she was supposed to put on for our date. “Why are these on the floor?” I thought. It was bizarre that she would do this on our date night and it was not the first time either. 

I started to look around the house but she was nowhere to be seen. I walk in the kitchen and I hear this weird hissing sound coming from under me. The basement, why would she be there? There was nothing in there and no reason for her to go inside the basement.  
  
I walked the stairs to the basement and it was dark. It also smelled really funky. It was very warm and humid there. That was not the case earlier.  Then I hear some movement behind me and look over there. It’s dark but I have a flashlight so I turn it on. ‘’hisssss’’ It hissed at me. The half snake half woman hissed at me.‘’What the fuck!’’ I yelled at the monster who turned out to be my wife. The puzzle just clicked and that’s where she always disappeared to.  
  
‘’Don’t look at me’’ She said with this raspy, snake-like voice.  
  
‘’How could you hide this from me?’’ I asked while getting angry at her for hiding this.  
  
‘’I thought you would leave me if you knew,’’ She told me.   
  
‘’Is there a way out of this? Is this a curse?’’ I wanted to figure out how this was even possible.   
  
‘’It’s a curse that can’t be lifted,’’ she answered. ‘’ I can’t be saved. Please kill me and stop this madness’’ Rosanne said while starting to weep.   
  
I thought about it for a while. She returned to human form and we talked this through. She did not want to live anymore because every time she turned into a snake. She got this hunger for human souls and she told me she prefers to feast on younger people as their souls are more pure than grown humans. I had to think about the situation and what could be done.  
  
Every night I had these nightmares of her stealing children and feasting on their souls. It was terrifying to think about. I kept going back and forth between killing her and helping her.   
  
You are thinking ‘’Why would he help her?’’ I know it sounds bad but I got that idea because she was perfect.  
  
We had a nice relationship and I never had to worry about anything after coming home from work. She kept the house clean and made me dinner. I couldn’t make my decision then and there. I needed to think it through.  
  
One day we talked about the situation on our hands and she told me how and why she was cursed. She told me that when she was younger her parents were homeless and wanted to get stability in their lives.  
  
They found this mysterious ad on a lamp post and it was about some shaman helping people get what they want. So her parents went to visit that shaman and they got an offer. They would get everything they ever wanted but it would cost them their first ten thousand euros. It was clear the money had to be their first ten thousand ever. They accepted but didn't know what would happen if they didn’t pay him. She told me that because they were homeless after they got the money they totally forgot that deal made with the shaman. 

The shaman never told them what would happen if they would not pay him. Soon they found out. As her mother gave birth to my wife she was healthy and all was well but by the time she turned five. She would turn into this half snake half human form. Her parents did not know what to do. It was not natural and so they remembered the shaman who helped them out of poverty. As they visited the shaman he told them that it was too late to do anything and it was all their fault for not following their deal. My wife got cursed by that shaman because her parents forgot to pay him.   
  
Hearing this made me want to help her even more. She did not cause this and deserved a good life. A good life that was ruined by her parents' actions. One day, exactly 5 days after what happened I was walking on the street and I saw this poster of a shaman offering spiritual readings. I got an idea and went to visit that shaman as soon as I could. I located his cottage which was a little hard to find but I managed to find it. I knocked on the door. He opened the door and he looked old, really old. He looked like he was over 90 years old.

I then asked him about the situation and he told me that he was the shaman who helped those homeless people. He also told me the same story my wife did and that gave me a little  bit of hope.  
  
He spoke very calmly and was not one bit angry.  
  
He told me that there could be a cure but he had to check from some book, so I waited.   
  
30 minutes go by and he comes back. I can feel that the thing he found is not good. ‘’There is no cure or any way to reverse this,’’ He told me. He also said that it was a strong curse because they had made a deal. Once the parents and the shaman both agreed her fate was set. That felt so wrong, I had so much hope in me. That was all for nothing. I still decided to stay with her and not let her die. It was not an option.  Before leaving the shaman's hut he said something weird. ‘’A person’s love is the only thing capable of removing something this horrifying’’. I didn’t answer and just left.  
  
I walked back home feeling pretty low. I could not get that sadness to go away. It was a 15 minute walk and I kept thinking about what would happen and how we could cure her.  
  
I got to the front door and opened it. The house was really quiet, no sounds at all. ‘’Rosanne’’ I shouted but no answer. I walked up to our bedroom and there she was. She was laying on the bed and there was blood all over her. I started to cry as I realized she had done what I couldn’t.   
  
There was a note beside her and I read that. In that note she told me how much she loved me and how great I was. She also apologized for doing this but she could not endanger anyone anymore. She also told me that we would get married in the next life.  
  
I read it and with each word I cried louder. I just kept having these flashbacks of all the good things we did together. All the late night walks, dancing at our wedding, dreaming about moving to another country and all the late night laughs we had before falling asleep together.  
  
I lost everything that night.  I lost her, the brightest light in this world of darkness. I still have her clothes in my closet and I still can’t let go.
