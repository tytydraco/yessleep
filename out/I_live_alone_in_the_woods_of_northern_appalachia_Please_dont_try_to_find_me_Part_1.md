People out here know better. They're wise enough not to go into the woods at night. Bears, of course, are the first thing that might come to mind. Couple of big cats out here too. But if you ask the right person, they'll tell ya you'd be lucky if that's all you come across. They're a superstitious lot.

Or they would be, if they weren't right.

Me, I'm not from the region, and I'd rather not tell you where I'm from. All you need to know is that there's a ratty little shack, deep within the woods, that I call home. Far from civilization.

It was a frigid January night when it happened. When I lost the right to walk amongst men. Me and a couple of the guys, we were camping out - this one guy, Barry I'll call him, was a real rugged sort. He always wanted to prove what a "real man" he was - granted, he lived up to his own standards. He hunted, but never wasted a scrap of meat or even bone. He was a hard worker, brawny as hell, but not violent. He drank his whiskey straight, and I think he genuinely liked it that way - and though he drank a lot, his wife and kids loved the guy. Firm, but gentle with his family, the way a real "man's man" should be. Frankly, he had already become everything he aspired to be - he had nothing to prove, but he still insisted on this trip. 

It was 4 of us, and as we sat around the roaring campfire in thick winter coats, chugging beer and cracking dumb jokes, the miserable cold felt far away. But once the beer ran out, everybody but Barry was ready to hit the hay. He had decided he wanted to go for a walk - at night, in the woods, in January. I protested of course, but he was an unshakeable sort of man - and so I relented. He had a 357 on his hip and a shotgun strapped across his back - and quite frankly I wasn't worried. He was "built different", as you kids say. I didn't think he'd get lost, and any animal that crossed his path would get blown away real quick. So when we woke up, rising with with the winter sun, and Barry hadn't come back, our first assumption was that he'd come back, slept, then gone for a morning walk as well. Maybe to grab more firewood. 

After a couple hours, he didn't come back, and I went out lookin for him. The forest floor was smothered in a thick layer of snow, and as I crunched my way through the silent, hibernating woods, my hand never strayed far from my own handgun. I wish I could tell you that my search bore no fruit - or that Barry had come back on his own while I was out, or that I ran into him in the woods, or...

Well, he was in pieces. Dried blood had splashed halfway up the trunk of an old pine tree, his left arm had been ripped from his torso. His right, missing from the shoulder down. And his stomache had been torn open - I would say Barry had been disemboweled, but whatever killed him had eaten just about everything in his lower abdomen, and only tattered skin and bits of flesh remained. I threw up - only natural, given the circumstances. Dizzy, my throat burning and my heart wrapped in the icy grip of absolute terror, I barrelled back the way I came, ready to grab the other 2, hustle into the truck and get the absolute fuck out of there.

When I got back to the camp, one of the other guys - we'll call him Ted - had gone out looking in another direction. Ted was a heavyset man, not exactly fit, but he was a good guy. The other - Tim - had stayed behind for when I got back. I told him what I saw, through gasps of exhaustion and terrified hyperventilation. The two of us might have taken off that second, left all the supplies behind, but for two reasons. Firstly, Ted was still out looking for our deceased friend. Two, Ted had the keys to the truck - it was HIS truck. So we stood, and shivered, and waited for Ted to come back. He must have got himself real lost, because day turned into sunset turned into dusk before we finally saw him again. He saw me and hastened towards us, huffing and panting - by the lack of horror on his face, I figured he hadn't even stumbled across Chuck's body.

A moment later, a flash of white fur burst from the woods behind him - I barely had time to shout his name before it took him to the ground. He screamed, for all of half a second, before the huge, wild beast tore his throat open with its viscious jaws. I pulled my gun, opened fire - a gesture less than futile. It elicited little more than a yelp pf pain, and a moment later the beast turned its anger onto me. It lunged, and I reached out my left hand, instinctively, trying to push it away. I lost that hand a moment later, and screamed louder and higher than I thought I could. Then, Tim made the same mistake as me - pulling his rather impressive 12 gauge from the back of the truck, he unloaded 6 rounds into the pale beast. This, too, only succeeded in pissing the monstrosity off. I'm not proud to say that, as it savagely slaughtered the last of my friends, I selfishly hobbled to the truck. I locked the doors, hoping that somehow the thin metal doors and glass windows might keep me safe.

As I looked down as the stump of my left arm, I held back tears of agony. And as I noticed Ted's keys sitting on the dashboard - they were in the truck all along - I did not hesitate. With my one good arm, I jammed them in, and thanked God, Buddha, Vishnu and just about every other deity I could recall when the old Chevy started up. I booked it, of course - a small shred of guilt nagged at me for a moment, but what the hell could I have done? The other 3 were surely dead, and I couldn't help them in my condition, anyways. Speaking of my condition, I was behind the wheel for maybe 5 minutes before I passed out due to blood loss.

To Be Continued.
