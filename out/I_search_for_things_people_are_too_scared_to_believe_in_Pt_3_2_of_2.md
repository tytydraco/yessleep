The next case is a weird one. Still gives me chills thinking about it from time to time. This case follows some irregular sightings that happened. This maybe could have been how this whole weird phenomenon started.  
  
“The Clown.”  
Case log: 09 Location: Minnesota  
  
This is an unusual one. Today while scrolling online through certain back channels, I saw a bunch of people talking on forums about seeing a clown. My first thought was a Gacy wanna-be, then the next was some people trying to get some scares out of people. Halloweens passed and it’s the middle of winter. This person or people have to be delusional. It’s probably nothing but a prank.   
  
It's now been a few days and I’ve decided to check the forums again before I decide to leave. Still just a few sightings here and there, nothing really caught my eye until I saw a link to an article. Guess this clown or clowns stepped up their game because two people were stabbed and one was killed all in a night. The curious thing about this though is that these all happened within just a couple hours. Looking up the locations of each it would have taken a couple of hours to go back and forth from the towns. I still don’t know if this is something that is up my alley, but the town is only an hour away. It doesn’t hurt to take a look.  
  
Today I snuck into the hospital and was able to interview one of the stab victims. Then I made my way to the next town where the victim died and spoke with the coroner. To start off I interviewed the stab victim, getting into his room was pretty difficult. Turns out he has a watch on him, but everyone has to go to the bathroom or eat at some point. It took two hours of sitting there and reading until the guard finally got up and went somewhere. I knocked on the door and let myself in. The man stared at me curiously until I told him what I did and asked for an interview. He agreed.

M: “Thank you for your time, Mr…”   
  
J: “You can just call me Jacob, or Jake. whatever works.”   
  
M: “Ok, Jake, Thanks for giving me the time of day. Not many people would. To start off, can you tell me the events of what happened?”  
  
J: “I just finished up my shift and was heading out to my car when I noticed something in the tree line by the parking lot. It was a little windy out and snow was blowing so I didn’t really know what I was seeing. That is until I got a closer look.”   
  
M: “What did you see?”   
  
J: “It was someone dressed as a clown. Not just a mask, but the whole fucking get up. Red nose, big shoes, and all the makeup. It was like I was at the circus. It was just standing there watching me. I got creeped the fuck out of course, I mean it's a damn clown in the trees. So I started to jog towards my car. As I was moving across the parking lot the clown was following but still in the trees. I just don’t get it. One minute I was in the front of the parking lot and he was like thirty feet away in the trees. Then as soon as I turn to unlock my car, he's right behind me. No noise, no sound, just there. Then a sharp feeling in my side and I wake up here.”   
  
M: “That sounds utterly terrifying. I am honestly just as confused as you are. You only saw one person? There weren’t two there?”   
  
J: “Yah… it was not a fun time. I’m sure it was just one person. The clown was dressed the same and looked the same. Also, the police said there were only three sets of tracks. Mine, one heading to where I was found and the next was heading back into the forest. Same shoe size, shape, and imprint. I was told that the shoe prints looked oversized and misshapen. They said they followed it as far as they could into the forest but they just disappeared. One second they were there, the next they weren’t.”   
  
M: “Interesting, that's very surprising considering the amount of snow on the ground. There should have been at least something. But for it to just be gone is… hmm. I’m sure you’ve heard that there were two other victims. Did you by any chance know them?”   
  
J: “No, no idea who they are. It’s sad to think about though. I mean, two of us survived and one didn’t. The thought of that bothers me. I could have been him, I could have died. I just feel bad for his family.”   
  
M: “Is there anything else you can recall? Anything that might help me find this clown or clowns?”   
  
J: “I’m telling you, man, it was only one clown and nothing more that I can think of. Sorry, I couldn’t be of more help officer.”   
  
M: “Oh, I'm not a.. Nevermind. Thank you for your time again and I hope you get better. Have a good day.”

After I had finished transcribing this interview, I packed my stuff up and decided to head to the next town over. It was about an hour drive, long enough for me to reflect on the interview. Something he said just didn’t sit right with me. Only three sets of footprints. That would make it almost impossible for it to be more than one. So that begs the question itching in the back of my head. Is this all some sort of elaborate prank gone too far, or is it actually some sort of supernatural being?   
  
As I entered the coroner's office the temperature inside was about the same as the outside. The smell of death and decay came over me sending shivers down my spine. There was no one at the desk and flickering lights were sending my senses into overdrive. It felt like someone was watching me. I could have sworn I even saw someone in the corner of my eye. It was one of those weird moments where you think you see someone, but actually don’t. I know there is a saying for it, but I can’t remember it off the top of my head right now.   
  
Staring into the darkened corner of the room as the lights flickered put me in some sort of trance. It felt as though all my senses were focused on where I thought I had seen someone. Finally my concentration had been broken by the coroner touching my shoulder. He asked if I was alright and after I replied that I was fine, he brought me into his office.

C: “So what Can I do for you Mr…?”   
  
M: “I was hoping we could talk about the man that had been stabbed the other day. On the phone you said there were some irregularities.”   
  
C: “Straight to business kind of man, I understand. There’s just the small means of compensation we discussed. That nice watch on your wrist would do mighty fine.”   
  
M: “Five-hundred should be enough, here.”   
  
C: “Damn, that watch aint worth this much but business is business. Ok, let us get started. This man had been stabbed only once right under the sternum. He then dropped to the ground and bled to death. My best guess was that he passed out from shock and by the time he came to he had lost too much blood. Little strength left and the freezing temperatures didn’t fare for him.”   
  
M: “Who found him, and what was the irregularity you told me about on the phone?’  
  
C: “See, here is the kicker. The only witness was a teenage boy on his way home from work. Kid said he saw someone dressed as a clown attack a man then stared at him smiling. So of course, the kid shit himself and ran off. Only to bring help a bit later. He just didn’t get to help in time. The other… interesting thing I found was another person's DNA on the body. It was on the outside of his jacket and also around the wound.”   
  
M: “So whose DNA was it? Were you able to trace it back to someone?”   
  
C: “Oh, I was able to trace it alright. But get this. The other DNA found on him was one of the other stab victims a town over. Somehow, his blood ended up on this scene.”   
  
M: “That’s impossible. The attacks occurred all within about twenty minutes of each other. How would his blood get on this guy?”   
  
C: “I have no idea. It’s spooky as shit. All I know is that I will be sleeping with my gun and shooting anything that resembles a clown. So a little tip of advice for you, leave town. Hell, leave this state and don’t look back. Let the local authorities deal with this lunatic.”   
  
M: “Thank you for the advice and your time. I might just take you up on that.”   
  
C: “Have a good night now. Be safe and thank you for doing business.”

As I exited the morgues' faded metal doors I noticed snow falling outside the lobby window. The main lobby was somehow even more dark than when I had first entered. It was as though half of the fading lights finally burst. Trying to comprehend what I had just been told I began to make my way to the front door. A few feet away from the door I dropped my tape recorder on the old, wet, yellowing tile and it began to play. The only noise that could be heard coming from it was the static of an empty tape being played. Bending down to pick it up words from it echoed into the cold dark room. “It was someone dressed as a clown. Not just a mask, but the whole fu-” It stopped as I hit the pause button standing back up.   
  
I slid the recorder back in my pocket and as I looked up I saw a person standing outside the main entrance. Not just an ordinary passerby, but someone who was dressed up like a clown. It was only half of their body. The other half was obstructed by the building. It looked as though the clown was just barely peering into the office. A huge frown came across his fading white face then it slowly began to turn upwards into one of the most terrifying smiles I have ever seen. The corner of its mouth looked as though it was about to reach his eye. Then to make matters worse, he opened his mouth showing old brown and decaying teeth. Drool began to drip out the bottom of his mouth as we stood locked in a staring contest. Too afraid to lose, I studied everything I could see. His teeth were sharpened and his tongue was all black. The uniform he was wearing was covered in what looked to be a mixture of blood, mud and snow. Getting a quick glimpse down I noticed his shoes were almost pristine. It was as though he had shined them.    
  
Looking back up every other dirty or bloody part on him was clean. His shirt was no logger covered in blood or mud and the only sign of snow on him  was a smile pile growing on the shoulder I could see. My eyes met his face again and there appeared to be nothing wrong with it anymore. It just looked like your normal old style movie clown with makeup. Next thing I know he blew his hot breath on the cold door making it fog up. I wasn’t able to see his face anymore because of it, but then he slowly pulled up his hand and drew a smiley face before walking off. Pulling together all the courage I could muster, I ran outside and looked in the direction he walked towards. Nothing was there but an empty sidewalk illuminated by the yellow incandescent glow of a street light in snowflakes.   
  
It has been a couple of days since the last clown sighting. After I saw him a person was stabbed in a town half an hour away. I went looking around that night for the clown, following the oversized shoe prints into an alley before they just disappeared. If I hadn’t frozen in place, maybe the other person would still be alive. Sadly, I can’t spend too much time dwelling on it. I am going to head over to the next town and see what I can figure out.   
  
I spent the day today walking around the town asking a couple of people if anything weird has been happening. Most said no, and the few that said yes, weren’t in the mood for an interview. I only got a few passing words of “Clown”, “stabbing”, and “dead”. Once it hit eleven, I decided to call it quits. I was pretty tired and in need of some food. There was a gas station that was thankfully open, so I decided to stop there. It was going to be a long night writing this all down, transcribing and trying to piece it all together.   
  
Once inside I made my way to the surprisingly clean coffee section to pour myself a cup. The dark liquid filling the cup put me in a trance. The lights reflecting off the black stream along with the rich smell made me realize how tired I actually was. I stood there for a moment watching the steam do its little dance from the cup into the air until something caught my attention. In the reflection of the window I saw one of the best late night snacks. A delicious sleeve of mini powdered donuts. It has been a while since I have had something sweet, and they would hit the spot.  
  
After I finished my journey through the rest of the isles, I headed to the front to pay. Surprisingly there was no one at the register. I thought to myself that they must be in the bathroom or something and I should just wait. About five or so minutes passed and still no one showed up. Getting a little irritated I decided to just set a twenty on the counter and leave. Walking out of the store I finally realized why no one was helping me. In the little partition between counter tops I noticed a dark crimson liquid slowly making its way across the floor. Leaning over the counter I saw a guy who was in his twenties lying on the floor, blood slowly pouring out of his neck.  
  
I waited for what felt like an hour for the cops to arrive. They put me in cuffs right away and began asking me a bunch of stupid questions. Sitting there silently on the curb staring up at the cop talking to me, I noticed something. Behind him about thirty yards away was a man in the tree line. Not just an ordinary man, but one dressed up to look like a clown. He stood there, head slacked to the side with a big toothy smile on his face. Blood covered his outfit and I could see the glint of a knife in his right hand. Staring it down, he began to slowly raise his free hand and wave at me. It was the type of wave where the fingers meet the palm. Then he just stopped and stared before bending backwards. His arms were up in the air following his head until they finally touched the ground behind him. It was inhuman the way it looked. His head touched his calves and he began to slowly walk backwards into the trees until I couldn’t see him anymore.   
  
After about an hour the cops let me go. They finally were able to watch the tapes and saw that the guy was killed by a clown a couple minutes before I pulled up. Once morning hit I went back to where I saw the thing in the tree line but it was futile. Snow blew over the tracks and there were only a few indentations. When I got back to my car I noticed something on the windshield. A red clown nose that squeaked when I picked it up.   
  
I stayed in town for another few days, but nothing out of the ordinary popped up. No more clown sightings, stabbings or weird phenomena. Once the police cleared me, I decided to pack up and hit the road again. No need to stay in town if there’s nothing to stay for anymore. Another case for the books, sadly I can’t finish this one just yet.   
Case log: 09 Status:Ongoing/Unsolved   
  
So there you have it, just a few of the cases that I have worked on. I know I have a lot more, but I don’t want to sit here and bore you with everything that's happened in the past. I’ll share some more in the future but for now that's it.   
  
At least, that should have been it. While packing everything up into their perspective files and boxes I noticed something irregular with a file. It was facing the opposite way from all the others and picking it up, I noticed that it was also very thin. Turning it around and facing the right side towards me, I read “C. Randolph.” Along with very faint and unrecognizable scribbles followed by “C08-18”.   
  
Opening the folder and looking at its contents made me realize why it was so thin. Nothing was in it except a little cassette tape, and a torn out piece of paper. This wasn’t right, see, I make three copies of everything. Yes I know, it’s very tedious and takes a while to do. But, it’s always just in case something happens to one of the files. I have an audio recording, a digital transcript, and then the most barebone version, hand written. The handwritten portion is mainly contained in my journals, but I have copied them to other papers as well.   
  
What made this so confusing, was that these two were the only items. Usually there are a lot of papers, a bigger map, pictures, and an actual file. Grabbing the cassette tape and loading it into my player I noticed that it was wound in the middle of the tape. Which was even more off putting because it is either at the end or the beginning. Have I listened to this before? Have I found this file and went through it just to forget it again? How many times have I done that? All these thoughts rushed through my head before finally ceasing once I pressed play.   
  
The loud noise of static pierced my eardrums and made me stand at attention. It sounded like when you accidentally bump the tune button on your radio and the signal switches. But you can still hear the faintness of the previous station. That's what it sounded like, static with a low and almost unrecognizable voice behind it. I couldn’t understand what it was saying or trying to tell me. Pulling the cassette player closer to my better ear, I could just almost make out some of what was being said, but it wasn’t enough. Closing my eyes to try and focus on it more helped just a little bit and then I could finally hear what it was saying. Deep below the static were the words….   
  
“I came across this tape just randomly out in the woods. Nothing appears to be on it. Just static and a low gurgle.” Shot into my ears like someone screamed it at me with a megaphone. It was my voice though, not the voice I was just about to hear underneath the static. I was so close, I swear I could finally understand it. It was saying… What was it saying? Fuck, I can’t remeber now.   
  
Setting the cassette player down and looking outside, I noticed that the sun was just beginning to rise. That’s not right though, it was night time just a second ago. I listened to the tape and it was night, closed my eyes trying to figure out what was being said, then opened them to… morning? I couldn’t have been listening to that all night, that’s impossible. Turning back around and looking where I placed the cassette tape, I noticed a colored paper beneath it. It was an old wrinkled torn off piece of a map. On it were parts of Wyoming, Nebraska, and Kansas. With the majority of it being Colorado. There was a small circle and dot on an empty section of Colorado. No town names nearby or anything. Just a mile marker and a single road.  
  
Well it looks like I know where I’m going. I need to figure out what’s with this cassette and empty case file. Wish me luck.
