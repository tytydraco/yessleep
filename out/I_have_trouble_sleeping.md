It started the way it always does. I’m staring at the ceiling, the darkness of my bedroom pressing down, heavy and suffocating. My mind feels like a record stuck on a single groove, thoughts repeating and folding in on themselves. I tell myself it’s fine. Sleep will come. It always does, eventually.

The clock ticks louder than it should, every mechanical shift of its hands a sharp intrusion. I don’t have to look at it to know it’s late, but I do anyway. 2:13 a.m. I roll over, dragging the covers with me, and squeeze my eyes shut. My body feels exhausted, but my brain won’t shut up. What did I forget today? Did I leave the stove on? No, I didn’t even cook tonight. But what if I did? I almost throw off the blanket to check but stop myself. No, this is just my mind playing tricks again.

My room feels wrong. The silence isn’t comforting. It’s alive, too still in a way that doesn’t belong. I try to ignore it, focus on the rhythm of my breathing, but it only makes the quiet worse. It’s like the air itself is watching, waiting.

I roll onto my other side, my back to the door. My eyes sting, desperate for rest, but no matter how I position myself, my body doesn’t settle. The mattress feels lumpy, too soft, too firm, somehow both at once. My pillow smells faintly of detergent, the clean scent irritating rather than soothing. I fluff it out, punch it into a shape that might cradle my head, but it doesn’t matter. I still feel like I’m lying on a stranger’s bed.

The clock ticks again. 2:19. Six minutes have passed, though it felt longer. Or shorter. Time doesn’t feel real right now.

I turn back over to face the door. My bedroom looks the same as always, shadows stretching long and deep, but there’s an unfamiliar edge to it tonight. It feels like I shouldn’t be here, like I’m trespassing in my own home. My throat tightens as I scan the room. Nothing’s out of place. My dresser is where it should be, the clothes I abandoned earlier still draped across the chair. My phone sits on the nightstand, its screen dark. I almost reach for it. Maybe I can scroll myself to sleep, drown out the restless noise in my brain. But I don’t. Something about the thought of turning on the screen feels… wrong.

I flip onto my stomach, burying my face in the pillow. The darkness behind my eyelids is more oppressive than the one in the room. It feels thick, as though something is pressing down on me, making it impossible to breathe properly. I turn my head to the side, gasping in the cool air, and freeze.

Something creaks. It’s soft, barely noticeable, but I hear it. My heart pounds against my ribs as I strain to listen. The sound doesn’t come again, but my skin prickles as if the air around me has shifted. I glance toward the door again. It’s shut, as always. The house is silent. I tell myself it was nothing—just the old wood settling, the way it sometimes does when the temperature drops. But it doesn’t help.

I roll onto my back again, staring at the ceiling. The ticking clock seems louder now, almost echoing. My chest feels tight, my limbs heavy. I try counting my breaths. In. Hold. Out. I make it to twenty before the rhythm falls apart, my mind wandering to something else. I hate this feeling. Being trapped inside my own body, my own mind, like I can’t escape myself. Sleep should be easy. Just close your eyes and let go. Why can’t I let go?

The air feels colder suddenly. My blanket isn’t enough. I pull it tighter around me, but the chill settles into my skin, deep and aching. I glance toward the window. The curtains are drawn, but the faintest sliver of moonlight seeps through the crack where they don’t quite meet. It paints a pale streak on the carpet, faint and harmless. But my eyes linger there, drawn to it. There’s something unsettling about it, though I can’t explain why. It’s just moonlight.

I shift again, turning onto my other side, and close my eyes once more. My breathing is shallow now, every exhale catching slightly in my throat. I can feel my heart, steady but too loud, like it’s trying to compete with the ticking of the clock. I try to focus on it instead. Count the beats. Let it drown everything else out. But I can’t.

There’s another sound. Not the creak this time. Softer. A faint whisper, so low I can barely hear it. My eyes snap open, my heart slamming in my chest. It’s gone as quickly as it came. I tell myself I imagined it, but my body doesn’t believe me. My muscles are tense, my skin tight with goosebumps. I lie there, frozen, listening for it again. The silence is too thick, too alive.

I reach out for the lamp on my nightstand, my fingers trembling. The light will help. It always does. But just as my hand brushes the switch, I stop. Something in me—some primal, animal part—screams not to do it. Don’t turn it on. Don’t make it worse. My hand falls back to the bed.

The whisper comes again, clearer this time. My stomach twists. It doesn’t sound like words, not exactly. Just… sound. Air moving in a way it shouldn’t. It’s coming from the far corner of the room, where the shadows are deepest. I can’t see anything, but I can feel it. Something is there. Watching. Waiting.

I tell myself it’s nothing. My mind is playing tricks on me. Sleep deprivation does that, makes you see and hear things that aren’t real. I shut my eyes tight, willing myself to believe it. But the sound doesn’t stop. It’s growing louder now, closer.

My throat is dry. I want to call out, to yell, scream, anything. But I can’t. My voice is caught somewhere deep inside me, buried under layers of fear. I press myself deeper into the mattress, clutching the blanket like it’s a shield. The whispering shifts, circling the room. I don’t want to look. I don’t want to know. But I can’t stop myself.

Slowly, I turn my head toward the corner. My eyes adjust to the darkness, picking out the familiar shapes of my room. The chair. The dresser. The faint outline of the door. Nothing is there. Nothing is ever there. But I can’t shake the feeling that if I look long enough, I’ll see it. Something I don’t want to see.

The whispering stops. My ears ring in the sudden silence. My heart races, each beat loud and painful. I force myself to breathe, slow and deep. The air tastes strange now, metallic and sharp. I tell myself it’s fine. It’s over. But I know better.

A weight settles on the edge of the bed. My body stiffens, every nerve screaming at me to run, but I can’t move. I can feel it there, pressing down on the mattress, pulling the blanket tighter around me. My breath catches in my throat. I don’t want to look. I don’t want to see.

The weight shifts, moving closer. The blanket slides, just barely, but enough. I clutch it tighter, my knuckles white. My chest feels like it’s caving in, my lungs refusing to work. The air around me feels wrong, heavy and thick, like I’m drowning.

And then I hear it. A breath. Soft and slow, right next to my ear. My entire body locks up, every muscle frozen in place. I can’t think, can’t move, can’t breathe. The sound lingers, warm and wet against my skin.

I squeeze my eyes shut, praying for it to stop, for the sun to rise, for anything to save me from this. But the darkness doesn’t lift. The breath doesn’t fade. It stays there, steady and unrelenting, as the clock ticks louder and louder, marking every second that passes.

And I know, in that moment, that I’ll never fall asleep again.
