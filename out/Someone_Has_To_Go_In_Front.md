  
 I’m writing this now because sleep isn’t happening, and because the smell is back—the wax, that animal tallow stink I can’t wash off my hands no matter what I try. My name is Diego, I’m from Madrid, 32, project geotech for a small firm. Last weekend—Saturday night, October 11, 2025—I went out to the woods above a village in Lugo province with two friends, Mateo and Iván. We weren’t chasing anything supernatural. We wanted to finish a mapping job and make it fun with an overnight at a ruined hermitage that locals swear is safe if you keep quiet and don’t provoke the place. It was supposed to be easy overtime: cross-check coordinates, test a drone path over chestnut groves, sleep under a roof older than any of us.

 We’ve known each other since university—field labs, cheap beer, and colder mornings. Mateo films everything; he edits workplace videos into mini-docs nobody watches except our moms. Iván is the practical one, recently divorced, the kind of guy who checks the spare before he checks the map. I’m the one who says yes to too many things. The plan was simple: drive up, grab a caldo at the village bar, hike to the hermitage before twilight, shoot stars, test the drone grid for Monday’s survey, sleep, and go home before lunch on Sunday.

 The bar smelled like soup and wet wool. The old man at the counter—Emilio, he said, though everyone called him don—asked where we were sleeping. When we told him the hermitage name, he pressed his lips together, then laid a small ashtray on the table like it was a talisman. He said certain nights the woods are crowded in ways you don’t see. Don’t answer if someone calls you by name, he told us. If you feel a gift pressed into your hand, drop it. If the wind goes still and you smell wax, step inside a circle of ash and wait without speaking. We smiled and promised we’d be careful. He didn’t smile back.

 We left the bar into a drizzle that turned to a fine mist by the time we reached the trailhead. Galicia does damp like a second atmosphere. The path threaded between chestnut and oak, the kind of green that eats sound. The hermitage sat on a shoulder of rock above the village; we could see its slate roof when the trees opened. Mateo was talking about timelapses of moving cloud; Iván showed me a photo of his little boy with a plastic dinosaur, the first thing to make him smile all week. Everything felt normal. Better than normal, honestly. Work had been loud and here it was very quiet.

 The hermitage was exactly as Google had promised: four walls, one door hanging wrong on rusty hinges, and an altar made of the same stone as the hill. We set the stove on a flat rock, ate bread and cheese and the last of the caldo in plastic. Mateo whistled softly as he fitted the tripod plates; Iván stretched his bad knee and grunted. I felt that city static peel off me. After sunset the clouds burned away and the sky went fierce, stars speaking like they only do far from streetlights. We were three men and the cold, and it was good.

 On our second pass to fetch water from a rivulet below the clearing, we cut a corner and found a fork I didn’t remember from the map. In the center someone had traced a ring of ash. It wasn’t a campfire ring—too clean, too careful—and there were drips of wax on a stone the way kids make when they tilt a candle over paper. A small cross of twigs lay half-buried, soggy. I kicked it gently and it slid with a rasp. Iván said some village kids must’ve played at Holy Week. Mateo squatted to film and then stood quickly, shaking his head like a horse does when a fly touches its eye.

 We put the drone up to check canopy gaps, but it came home early with a full battery like it had hit a ceiling we couldn’t see. Mateo swore softly, tapped the controller, sent it again. Same thing. While he fiddled, Iván and I noticed a leaning cross—two sticks tied with string—propped across the path we’d just taken in. It hadn’t been there ten minutes earlier. I set it aside without thinking. The air felt heavier, like a shop before closing where the clerks are waiting for you to leave.

 We got proper night around eleven-thirty. The headlamps went red to save our night vision; the stove ticked. When I checked my phone for the time later, the lock screen said 01:07 with the seconds frozen—no signal, just the hour like a painted sign. I locked it, opened again. 01:07. It was funny until it wasn’t. Somewhere to our right, down the slope, a man’s voice said my name. Not loud—more like a greeting from a neighbor turning the corner. Diego. The way my mother says it when I answer the phone distracted. I turned halfway and caught Iván’s sleeve. Don’t answer, he said, and I realized he was kneading his jaw like it hurt.

 We killed our headlamps and crouched behind a low stone. The lights we thought were farmhouses moving through the trees were not farmhouses. They were hand-held, a wavering little chain of gold sliding along the slope. I smelled the sea for a moment, impossible so far inland, brine cutting through leaf rot. Mateo raised the camera but didn’t press record. Between trunks I saw shoulders hunched under hoods, faces like washed-out photographs, and at the front a taller figure carrying a cross that looked heavier than any one of us would want to lift. The candle flames burned steady even when the mist licked at them. Somewhere behind us the voice said my name again, softer. Diego.

 We held as the column passed below, but the front figure turned uphill, smudged by branches, and without hurry came toward us until I could have touched the cross. A second hand lifted, offering it, patient. I’d like to pretend I remembered Don Emilio’s warning quickly, that I dropped my own hand instantly, but the truth is I reached and only stopped because the wood felt cold in a way wood isn’t supposed to. My palm came away wet, slicked with a wax that wasn’t quite wax. The world tilted an inch. Mateo hissed my name through his teeth like he could pull me backward with it.

 We ran without dignity. The procession didn’t chase. It didn’t need to. Tracks we knew a couple of hours earlier refused to be where we left them. The nearest structure was a hórreo, a granary on stone legs ten meters off the path, and we piled into it and dragged the warped door nearly shut. The slats let in threads of light and the smell of old grain and mouse. Outside, candle-glow passed like a tethered river. My palm burned cold where the not-wax had smeared; when I wiped it on my pants it left a dull sheen like oil.

 The latch rattled lightly with no wind to move it. Then something small and pale pressed under the door: not a finger but the idea of one, a bulge of wax finding space the way water does. I stamped and it flattened, smearing, then gathered itself again—slow, patient—until Iván ground his boot hard enough to drive it back. He whispered a prayer I didn’t know he knew, not showy, just words from somewhere older than us. Mateo said please twice, to the room or to the air. Someone outside moved past, a sound like cloth brushing bark, measured as a tolling bell.

 I tore open the ashes tin from the stove, hands shaking so badly I almost dumped it into the gaps in the planks, and traced a ring around us on the splintered boards. It felt ridiculous until it didn’t. When the circle closed the light from outside thinned, like fogged glass between us and them. The latch lifted and dropped once, twice, nine times—counting the knocks made my throat hurt. None of us spoke. The smell of tallow was so strong I could taste it, fat and old. Through the slats I could see sandals but no feet in them, just the leather, and then nothing at all, like a page turned.

 Dawn came like someone lifting a wet cloth. When we finally opened the door the air moved again and the birds made the usual cheap jokes. On the threshold hung a new stick cross from the latch we hadn’t fastened, twine still wet. In the mud below the steps were footprints—naked, human-looking, all heading away downhill toward the stream, no pattern of return. On the granary floor the ash circle was scuffed but unbroken. I picked up a loose ribbon I thought was trash and saw my initials stitched in tarnished thread. D G. I don’t own anything with embroidery.

 We didn’t talk about it as we packed, because talking would mean deciding whether it had happened. The hermitage looked like a postcard you could buy in any petrol station: pious ruin, forgettable. I scrubbed my left palm with sand and water until it went raw, but the sheen remained and the smell stayed, like I’d been helping butcher something. On the way down none of us wanted to be first; none of us wanted to be last. We returned the drone to its case like we were apologizing to it.

 Back in Madrid I told myself we’d been overwrought in a place geared for ghost stories. I kept telling myself while I scoured with dish soap, with coffee grounds, with rubbing alcohol until my skin protested and the smell lingered anyway. I slept a few hours Monday and woke at 1:07 a.m. exactly with the sound of slow steps in the hall outside my apartment, steps that stopped at my door and then continued past like a neighbor pacing with a baby. Tuesday, the same. Wednesday, I dreamed I was carrying something heavy down rows of trees and the weight wasn’t a burden but a task I’d been given long ago, something I’d forgotten and was glad to remember.

 Thursday I opened Mateo’s shared folder to sort survey clips. Most files were perfect: shaky jokes, skyline, Iván complaining about his knees. One clip I didn’t recognize started black, then showed the three of us crossing the clearing in a jittering gold light. The camera was low, like set on the ground. We passed in front of it and I froze. I was barefoot. I don’t remember losing my boots. A black strap crossed my chest and something long and dark rose over my shoulder. The timeline said 00:03 on October 12. Behind me, Mateo and Iván kept a respectful distance with their heads dipped like mourners. I closed the laptop so fast the mug jumped.

 That night Don Emilio called. He shouldn’t have had my number, but he said Iván gave it to him to ask if we’d found a rosary. No, I said, we hadn’t borrowed anything. He hummed in a toothless way and told me not to answer if someone came to return what I’d already taken, and to check my bags for anything that wasn’t mine. After we hung up, I opened my pack and found, beneath the drone charger, a strap of cracked black leather that smelled like smoke and old churches. It fit my chest without adjusting. I put it on the table and went to wash my hands again. When I came back, the strap lay in a neat circle, like it wanted to be a ring around something.

 Earlier today I ducked into the chino shop on the corner for batteries. I passed the shelf of candles and one stub, the cheapest sort, sputtered and took flame. There was no lighter near it, no matches. The clerk didn’t look up. I stood there like an idiot watching the wax run in a line down the side, a perfect thread that reminded me of that thing pushing under the hórreo door. When I got home, the hallway smelled faintly of salt air though I live 600 kilometers from the sea. Something had been pressed into my mailbox slot, and I half-expected a candle to fall. It was empty.

 If you grew up in Galicia you probably have a name for what we stumbled across. I didn’t grow up there, but my grandmother did, and some of her stories wore the same shoes: a procession that moves like an errand, the living conscripted to lead the dead, the weight in your hands a cross you shouldn’t accept. I thought those were for scaring kids into coming home before dark. Tonight, before writing this, I made a small ash circle on a plate because it feels less ridiculous to be ridiculous on purpose than to pretend none of this is happening. The strap they offered me—because I think that’s what it was, an offer—sits coiled like a sleeping snake. I keep smelling wax when the wind is perfectly clean.

 I keep thinking about the video frame and how calm I look carrying that weight. I keep thinking about how the flames didn’t flicker and how the air didn’t move until we drew the circle, and how a ribbon with my initials lay where I’d stand to leave. If this is a prank, it’s a mean one that knows too much. If it isn’t, then there’s a schedule I’m not making but that keeps me anyway at 1:07, the minute my phone learned to be only a sign. It’s late again, and the steps are back in the hall—pace, pause, pace, a knock lower than knuckles, something like wood on wood. I’m going to post this and then sit inside my little ash ring like a child because I don’t know what else to do.
