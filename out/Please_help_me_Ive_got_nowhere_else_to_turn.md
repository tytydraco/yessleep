Hi everyone,

I'm new to this subreddit and I'm hoping to get some advice on a strange occurrence that has been happening to me for the past few weeks. I suspect that most of you are going to think I'm making this up but everything I'm about to tell you is 100% true. I'm not sure if it's just my imagination or if there's something more sinister at play, but I'm starting to get really scared.

It all started when I moved into my new apartment. I had been looking forward to living on my own for the first time, but things didn't quite go as planned. The first night, I was woken up by a strange noise coming from the wall behind my bed. It sounded like scratching and tapping, like someone was trying to dig their way through the plaster. I was scared, but I tried to brush it off as just a mouse or something.

The next night, the scratching and tapping started again. This time, it was louder and more persistent. I tried to ignore it, but it was impossible to sleep through. I got up and looked behind the wall, but there was nothing there. I couldn't see any holes or cracks, and the wall was solid and intact. I was starting to get really freaked out, but I still tried to rationalize it as some kind of rodent problem.

The following night, the scratching and tapping was even louder and more aggressive. It sounded like it was coming from directly behind my head, like someone was trying to get inside my skull. I was terrified and I didn't know what to do. I couldn't sleep, and I was starting to feel like I was going crazy.

As the nights went on, the scratching and tapping continued. It was getting louder and more persistent, and I was starting to feel like I was being watched. I would wake up in the middle of the night to see shadows moving on the wall, and I would hear whispers and whispers coming from the corner of the room.

I tried to talk to my friends and family about it, but they just thought I was being paranoid and making things up. I didn't know who to turn to, and I was starting to feel really alone and scared.

I started to do some more research, and I found out that the building has had a history of strange occurrences throughout the centuries. People had reported seeing ghosts and hearing strange noises, and there were even rumors of a former funeral director who used to live here who was rumored to have been involved in some kind of dark magic.

I was horrified, and I started to wonder if I had accidentally stumbled into some kind of portal to the other side. I was starting to feel like I was being haunted by the ghosts of the deceased, and I didn't know how to protect myself.

I tried to talk to my landlord about it, but he just laughed it off and told me that it was probably just the old pipes or something. I didn't believe him, and I started to feel like I was trapped in this haunted apartment with no way out.

I started to see things during the day, too. I would catch glimpses of shadows out of the corner of my eye, and I would hear whispers and whispers coming from the walls. I was starting to feel like I was going crazy, and I was terrified that the ghosts were trying to possess me.

I didn't know what to do, and I was starting to feel like I was losing my mind. I was scared to sleep, and I was starting to lose weight and look pale and sickly. I knew that I needed to do something before it was too late.

I'm normally a pretty rational person and I don't really think I believe in ghosts but this was pushing me to the brink of sanity. So despite myself I decided to go to a spiritual healer for help. She told me that the ghosts were trying to communicate with me, and that I needed to learn how to protect myself and communicate with them. She gave me some crystals and incense to burn, and she told me to meditate and focus on my own energy.

I started to follow her advice, and despite my reluctance and disbelief, things did actually start to get better. The scratching and tapping stopped, and the shadows and whispers disappeared. I was starting to feel like myself again, and I was finally able to sleep peacefully at night.
 
It was quiet for the next few months, but I still haven't been able to shake the feeling that the ghosts are still there, watching and waiting. And then last night the scratching and tapping returned. I sat up most of the night petrified but I must have drifted off at some point because I awoke in the early hours of the morning and there was a person standing at the foot of my bed. 

I couldn't move, like I know the phrase "frozen with fear" but that wasn't it, I literally couldn't move I was stuck in place, all I could do was move my eyes. The figure stood there with me staring at him for about an hour then I blinked and he was gone.

I'm still not sure what to do, and I'm hoping that someone on this subreddit can give me some advice. I don't want to live in fear anymore, and I want to find a way to protect myself and my apartment from the ghosts. I'm stay over at my girlfriends tonight so finger crossed I'll be safe.

Please, if anyone has any advice or has experienced something similar, I would really appreciate it. I'm at my wit's end and I don't know what to do.

Thank you.
