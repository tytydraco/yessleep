**May 13, 1986**



**Midst Of World War III**



My name is that of a war criminal. For now, you can call me Collector 662.



I was forbidden to speak about my profession in any capacity. All of us were. We knew what would happen, that one final action that was supposed to unlock our deep set fears of reprisal. There was no going off-book. We were obedient, and we were silent. If we did what we were told, we were handsomely rewarded. Everything we could ever want. All we had to give in return was our compliance.



So why did I run away?



It’s a long story, one that I’ll try to put into words here. No matter what I say though, it will never describe the full extent of what we did. That part of my life where I did some of the most terrifying, inhumane things a person could possibly do and saw things that would mentally break a mind of stone, is desperately trying to be sealed away forever in the deepest corners of my being.



It always breaks free and floats back to the surface, shaking me at the quick of everything that I was. I remember wishing that it would stop, but that was just wishful thinking. It would always be a part of me, whether I liked it or not.



To be frank, I’ve been “wanted” for a couple months now. These people don’t want me silent, imprisoned, or even dead. It’s a whole other reason that I’ll get to. For someone in my position, you can never be too safe. You keep a low profile, stay away from public spaces, use fake names, and change your appearance. Most of all, you don’t stop moving.



Staying in one spot for long is a fucking death sentence. I’ve got a place to hold up in. They’ll be here eventually, but I'll be long gone. Better yet, I’ll be someone new.



I’m going to tell you everything I know…how I became involved, what my job entailed, everything we did. I will be blunt. This is 100% unadulterated. It’s the truth and nothing but the truth. There’s no point in lying anymore. The world doesn’t know what’s happening, but soon they will.



I hope you’re still reading, but I’m not going to waste any more time. Here it is.



Let’s wind the clocks back to 1967.



I was a young man. Of course, that fact alone perked Uncle Sam’s ears up. I should’ve been in college working towards some sort of overall life achievement. Instead, I was plucked right off the street alongside millions of other unfortunate souls to go die in some bumfuck jungle. Now that I think back, it’s not like it was a fucking surprise anyway. I’m an American man. Going to war is practically a rite of passage.



See, I was at the point in life where a man has grown just enough to feel something for his country, but hasn’t yet grown out of that mindset that it’s a bunch of bullshit. It was rough, with a few close calls here and there. In Vietnam, the culture shock alone was a nightmare to deal with.



That combined with the heat, the constant rain, all of the things that the enemy used as a weapon to grind us down mentally. It was a bad time. I remember being pretty low. It’s not like we were getting any love back home. The news coverage and shit we got was nothing short of propaganda. They’d paint us to be the good guys, but we were the fucking bad guys in this war.



Things like that take a toll on you, but not that much to do what we did.



My squad was losing it. We were being torn apart from all sides, and all hope was gone. We went from being a ragtag group of go-getters to a single, desperate mindset; kill or be killed. That was our plan. We were doing whatever we had to do to survive. It didn’t matter who or what they were, we’d fuck them up. We’d burn their homes and villages to the ground. We’d slaughter their families, and we’d make their own lives worse than death if we had to.



I don’t remember exactly how it began, or when it ended. I think the first person I saw die was a woman. A young woman, around 24, 25 maybe. This younger kid shoved a whole Bowie knife down her throat. He pushed it in deep. Slowly, he inched it back out, and the woman was like a river, so much blood flowed out of her mouth.



The look on his face was fucking terrifying, man. It was like he was in some strange, dreamlike state. His eyes were blacked out, his pupils huge and dilated to a fucking tee. You know that look you get when you’re high off your fucking mind? It was like that, but with a different sort of madness on his face. We had all seen that look before. It was our own. We were all fucked in the head after so much time.



After that, it was a blur. All I remember is walking through the village, blacking out, then walking some more. I didn’t give too shits. I was angry. I was sad. I had no more use for the world, and there was no way in hell that I’d go back to it. This was it. Death or nothing.



Next thing I knew, I ended up in some field hospital. We caused quite a ruckus that night. Apparently, I was quite creative with my methods of torture and killing. The whole time, I was laughing like a lunatic.



I wasn’t sorry though.



Of course, it was no surprise when they yelled and spat at me, threw me around a bit, and slung all sorts of creative insults my way. The doctors, nurses, even they all thought that I was done for. All I did was laugh though. Even as one of my superiors punched me in the face, causing me to fall down to the ground and cough up crimson shit, I was still cackling.



My former squad and I lived out what we thought was the rest of our days in a damp and dirty makeshift prison. None of us talked to one another. We didn’t eat, we didn’t sleep, we didn’t even count the days with little tally marks on the walls. All of us were zombies, moping around in dazed, dreamlike states. Our brains had shut down completely.



It was the first and only time I’d eaten a rat. With a little knife I made from a broken off floor panel, I cut into the thing while it was still alive. Peeling back the skin and muscle, I saw the juicy insides sloshing around. I sank my teeth in and devoured whatever I could. Diseases were the least of my worries. I was already a disease to the world anyway.



With only a day left until our execution, there was a knock at the door. It slowly inched its way open, the first sunlight in ages pouring in. Our clothes were caked with dirt and grime, our hair went down to our shoulders and itched with bugs, and we were skeletons draped in thin skin. We huddled back against the walls as two gentlemen walked in.



The first was the general, acting all smug with the cigar nearly falling out of his mouth. The second was a middle-aged man with a black suit and tie, sunglasses, and fedora. He was painfully thin, almost as thin as us. We heard them speak in hushed murmurs to one another. They passed each other all sorts of documents and files.



At one point, the general glared at each of us with a look of utter disdain and hatred but also like he was running a thought through his mind. He turned back to the other man, saying, “Now are you sure?”



The other man let out a small chuckle, “General, trust me. They’ll be put to good use”.



Breathing a hefty sigh, the general shook his head and promptly left our cell, leaving us alone with this stranger. He stepped closer, and we stepped back. It looked like he was analyzing us, sizing us up, figuring out everything that we were.



His smile was sadistic, and his eyes were full of mania. I wanted to punch him in the face so hard that he would be a vegetable for the rest of his life. With that aside, I still listened, curious as to what he had in store for us.



“My name is Dr. Alexander Graves,” he began, “I understand you’re responsible for the massacre at Dang Minh. Your execution is to be carried out tomorrow at the crack of dawn,” No one said anything, “I don’t particularly feel like wasting your time, so I’ll be blunt. You’re the absolute worst pieces of shit. You did the worst things you could’ve possibly done, and to what end? You caused death, civilian death, and not only that,” He gazed at my former squad leader who couldn’t keep his hands to himself, and then back to the rest of us, “You should’ve taken those bullets for yourself”.



In hindsight, this was stupid of me to say, “We did what we had to,” I said, my mouth opening for the first time in who knows how long.



“No,” Alexander shook his head, stifling a laugh, “You did what you wanted to. You chose to make yourself more powerful, killing and mutilating those weaker and defenseless than you. You’re animals, but that doesn’t mean you have to go to waste”.



Our former squad leader interrupted, “What the hell are you talking about?”



“See, my friends and I have a mission, been working on it for as long as I can remember. In Antarctica, a special place is being constructed. Right now, the government is in the dark about its true intentions, thinking that we’re testing products for their wars. No, we’re really trying to expand upon science itself. We’re trying to create weapons for the future. What we want to use though are not just any weapons…they’re weapons of flesh and blood, man-made beasts designed to kill.”



The former squad leader’s face contorted in disgust, “Look, I don’t know what kind of shit you’re talking about, but I know I don’t want to be part of this. You aren’t the government. We don’t owe you shit”.



“Yes, you do,” Alexander said, “Your superiors have already approved it. If you refuse, you’ve basically given them the go-ahead to come and kill you. This isn’t a chance for you to atone for your sins. Frankly, there’s no redemption for you. But if this is who you are, then so be it. Join me, and you can unleash yourselves like never before. This is what you want, right? I guarantee you, this isn’t like anything you’ve seen."



The more he spoke, the more we realized that he might actually have a point. We were assholes, the lowest of the low. We didn’t have anything to lose. For us, this was a real opportunity. None of us knew what Alexander meant, and it seemed like crazy talk, but if we could finally let loose, unleash our darkest desires on…something…or someone…then so be it. This was a chance to be a part of something greater.



We agreed.



**May 16**



Two unknown vehicles were parked outside my safe house. I felt it necessary to gather my belongings and make my escape. I’m held up in an abandoned factory. It shouldn’t be long until they’re here again. Luckily, I’ve got several escape points. Hopefully it’ll be enough.



I neglected to mention this new war.



A couple months ago, there was a false flag operation in Cuba, intending to paint America like the aggressors. A few things led to another, and low and behold, we’re at war again. Surprise surprise, it’s with Russia. Both countries have nukes. So far, no one’s used them yet. We're not going to, at least not yet. The world is going to get a rude awakening soon. It’s going to be the end of the world as we know it.



Not for the reasons one might think, however.



I soon came to realize that my former squad and I were just a small drop in the endless sea of inhuman wrongness. There were hundreds of us, “recruited” from all over the world. We trained for years to become “collectors”. Who we worked for was multiple choice. I never learned what they truly called themselves, it was some ancient alien language I couldn’t ever hope to understand. For the purposes of what they stood for, we’ll call them Project VR001.



They had a mission, you see, one that could take advantage of an ongoing man-made conflict foretold to bring about the death of humanity from generations past. That false flag operation in Cuba? The reason why the world is in shambles, why the world’s two strongest countries are clamoring to be the ones on top, even if the rest of the world is dead and buried?



We did that…that chain reaction that had the exacting effect we craved. Maybe humanity could just do it themselves? If not, then we’ll step in.



Why? Why would we want all this chaos? Well, Project VR001 was all about bringing the death of humanity, all so new dominant lifeforms can rule. There was some cult-like group at the top that were trying to unleash some ancient prophecy that told them exactly how to do this, a prophecy that they’ve had for centuries.



It’s a prophecy in which humanity has to die so that a new dominant life form will arise to take our place, and with that new race of gods, there will be a new golden age, where everything is done the right way, where only those worthy of being in this higher plane will live.



Before I go on, let me say that there are things in this world that the common man can never hope to understand, things that have no right to exist. People try to gain some logical high ground that they created in their minds with what they call facts, logic, and common sense.



They explain the weird and mysterious away with big words and long drawn-out explanations that make their followers go “ooh” and “ahh”, denying every notion that there’s anything else beyond that because…it’s not realistic enough for their own liking?



Project VR001 would laugh in their faces. For them, plain, boring-old science wouldn’t suffice. They had to go deeper. Those unspeakable rituals they used, tapping into the unknown, looking beyond the veil, bending and breaking the rules of reality to their liking. We blended it all into one noxious mixture. It gave everything we created life like never before, but we weren’t going to stop there. These were some of the most brilliant minds of this world…minds that should’ve never been allowed to think.



To create these things, what we needed was pure organic material…blood, skin, bone, muscle, tissue, guts, nerves…just walking meat of all kinds. I was part of one of many teams who provided that. Project VR001 didn’t want fake, synthetic nonsense. These things were real. We couldn’t just manufacture the required meat ourselves.



So they’d get us to “round up” a victim. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that humanity is a resource to be tapped into, and it’s one that goes to waste when it’s not taken advantage of. We had a variety of methods for our job, ranging from the subtle to violent. After abduction and injection of the chemical that made them go nighty-night, they’d be transported to the base in Antarctica.



We didn’t just deal with live humans though. It could be any living creature. You know, you had your rabbits, your foxes, your deer, your dogs, your cats, you name it. I could only imagine people’s faces when their beloved pets were gone. We’d get as many live ones as we could, they’re in better condition anyway. 



The better the condition, the better the quality of flesh that you get. All of our subjects, human or otherwise, were kept in crates or cages until we had all we needed. Sometimes we had to put humans and animals together…lots of accidents.



You can probably imagine the smell, rancid, stinking, stale. So many people, so many animals, in such a cramped space, I’ve never smelled anything worse in my life. Even I smelled better as a prisoner-of-war. But really, the only thing worse was the noise. It was a dreadful cacophony of suffering between all of our permanent residents.



The humans made the most noise, they yelled, they cried, a lot of them pissed and shat themselves, and the children, oh boy the children, they would never shut the fuck up. Usually they were first in line to get some modicum of peace and quiet. The animals were always none-the-wiser to their fates.



And before they knew it, it was time.



To be honest, I never knew the exact process required to create them. It was only for the scientists, bioengineers, and other fucks behind those closed doors to know and for us, the measly collectors and the cattle to the slaughter if anything went haywire, to never find out.



Our only job at that point was to throw them inside and leave, maybe guard the door if some parent tried to be a hero and save their kid. However, we did get to see the end products. Initially, when we were still in the early testing phases, most of our creations were hybrids. Cats with foxes, pigs with wolves, humans with dogs, you get the point.



A lot of them died a few minutes into their new lives. If an experiment failed, I and a few others had to go in and retrieve them. Their bodies were a mess, contorted into unnatural shapes and sizes. Their guts had melted together or spilled out in pools of fluids. Their skin would either be stretched, different colors like patchwork ice cream, or gone altogether.



Sometimes they just laid there, their bodies still and lifeless. Every now and again, their dead eyes would open up as if to mock us, their keepers, for wasting our time with something so foul and which yielded no results. Yeah, our job was to dispose of them.



Some survived though, and they were used as a basis for moving forward.



With time, we got better and better. The scientists still counted each failure as a victory. They would study and evaluate the results of the experiments, taking everything into account and trying to replicate the results, if they were beneficial. If the experiments didn’t go well…they would try to figure out what went wrong and attempt to fix it. Through trial and error, they got better at it. We are able to progress to totally new and original creatures.



Some of them, you couldn’t even tell what they originally were anymore. You’d have to go in with your own eyes to truly understand what we were dealing with. They were imbued with the desire to kill, but they were also impervious to any outside harm, essentially invincible. Rapidly, they would evolve and mutate in any way they needed. Even if you blew them to smithereens, they would still find a way to come back. Let’s just say no human could be in the same room as them without being torn to shreds.



Sometimes, we’d watch them fight, which wasn’t a problem since they couldn’t die. You could see the stress building and exploding out of them at all times.



I’m going to describe some of them, not all. They created tens of hundreds of them, and as I write this, there’s more to come. I don’t have all day, so here are some notes on the ones that made an impact on me.



Subject 9: A nine-foot tall bipedal rat; once an ordinary street rat; long snout; floppy diluted tongue; large ears; expanded eyes; muted pink tail; razor sharp teeth and claws; gray fur; skinny and boney; makes high-pitched squeaks, hisses, screams, chattering of the teeth, and howls; horrendous stench, mix of roadkill, raw sewage, and old cheese; extremely feral, will attack absolutely anything; can tunnel underground at astonishing speeds; carries diseases like rabies, typhus, leprosy, bubonic plague, and cholera.

Subject 25: A five-foot tall bat-like creature; once a fruit bat caught in India; rather small compared to the others; gray ashy body; two eyes, huge black pupils; short snout; razor sharp fangs; tall ears; two flexible wings, long span; feet with sharp nails, able to hang upside down; makes low-pitched roars and hisses; nocturnal; ambush predator.



Subject 66: A humanoid; once a mentally ill patient named Richard Kneller; exceptionally pale skin; black hair; large black eyes; black lips; wide open mouth with teeth and gums protruding outwards, like a maniacal grin; never stops laughing, ever; extremely strong, able to break down doors and walls, can throw cars; able to perform incredible feats of agility; when inflicted with damage, it makes an extremely eerie screaming noise, mouth elongates and pupils enlarge; contorts into unnatural positions;

Subject 333: An artificial sentient supercomputer housing all of Project VR001’s top secret files and documents; once one of Project VR001’ own Kenneth Waterford; top scientist that betrayed his own; released files, quickly contained, and in an ironic twist of fate, became Project VR001’ guardian against breaches from external parties.

There were so many more, but you get the picture.



Maybe I’ve had time to correct my mistakes. I’ll tell you this, they were never mistakes to begin with. I knew what I was doing all along.



Does that make me the bad guy? Yes, yes it does.



At the same time though, I felt like something was breaking inside me.



No, it wasn’t as if I was suddenly growing a conscience and morals. It was more like I was a shell. If I didn’t care during Vietnam, I most certainly didn’t care now. The would-be subjects screaming for help, their sad puppy-dog eyes staring back at me. In me, there was nothing. I didn’t even have moments of hesitation.



I wasn’t some underdog who tried to step up to the big mean villains in an act of selfless heroics. I didn’t give a shit about that. By this point, I had lost my mind completely…again. I was angry…at who? I don’t know. Project VR001? My fellow collectors? The creatures? The world? I didn’t shoot up the place, I didn’t kill Alexander or any of the other head honchos up top, this wasn’t some action movie.



I just ran. I had nowhere to go, but it felt so good, like a weight off my shoulders. The snow had picked up, but I didn’t care. I ran, ran, ran until I couldn’t anymore. What I did do was climb aboard one of the cargo ships that came by every now and again.



I just thought, “Fuck it” and I hopped on. Being a collector all this time, I received the necessary training to become practically invisible. That’s what I did. Somehow, no one ever found me. I rode out the huge waves and terrifying storms. When we finally arrived in America, I hopped off. I’ve laid low ever since.



Are you expecting me to be the hero here? Warn the whole world of Project VR001? Expose their activities? Lead a resistance to try and take them down? Why would I do that? It’s all pointless exercises. I’m just telling you what I experienced and how I feel about it. Maybe I should’ve stayed, but something was compelling me to break free. I’m so conflicted. I don’t want to break free. I don’t think I’m gonna be on my best behavior for long.



There’s literally nothing we can do to stop Project VR001. Don’t even bother trying to kill their creations. You can’t. They’ll mutate, evolve into forms unknown to nature itself. Nukes won’t do anything. In fact, they might just speed up the process.



A global catastrophe is coming. It’s not a matter of if, but when. As humans, we like to think we’re invincible, that we can take anything on, but there are things in this world, in this universe, that humble us, make us look tiny, like little insects. We’re nothing. You? Me? We are completely and utterly nothing.



They’re tracking me every which way. In fact, those same two cars from three days ago just parked outside. I’m seeing four collectors get out. I remember them all…46, 880, 232, and 78…and I know exactly what they want to do to me.



All I can say is keep your loved ones close. Hug them tight, tell them how much you love them. Personally, I don’t have anyone to love. I’m pretty much alone in that fact though. Something’s coming, a conflict unlike anything the world has never seen before. No one’s prepared. It seems like the last chapter of humanity is now.



Sometimes, back in Antarctica, when I was walking past all those awful creatures, I’d just stop and stare at them. For some reason, that made me feel a connection to them. No matter how different we were, separated by bullet proof glass and barbed wire, they and I were at least on the same wavelength. Pain is all we know.



I’ve tried committing suicide. I can’t, though, not that I don’t want to, it’s just that I can’t. I don’t want to stay alive. Something’s stopping me. Death is waiting for me, but it seems like he’ll have to keep waiting.
