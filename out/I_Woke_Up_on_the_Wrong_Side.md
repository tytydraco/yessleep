Posted this because I can’t stop thinking about it. I don’t know if it’s trauma or something worse. Please just read.

What I’m about to tell you changed my life. On paper, it made me clinically insane. I’ve accepted that this is my reality now. I go through the motions, but I can never forget how things used to be. I miss the way it was before we fell.

It’s not the fall that scares me. It’s that no one else remembers it happened—and that I’m no longer the person I was before it did.

Ten years ago, I worked as an assistant for a famous singer from my home country. I won't say her real name or where we're from. Let's call her Simona. My job was to accompany her on tour, make sure she had everything she needed, answer important calls and texts—you know, the usual assistant stuff.

In June 2015, Simona went on one of her biggest tours ever. We traveled across the country, from the biggest cities to the tiniest towns. Everyone wanted to see her, everyone knew her songs, and every radio station played her music. Simona was on top of the world, and I got to be part of that.

Usually, we traveled by bus. Our country isn’t that big, so it worked fine. But for the final concert, there wasn’t enough time and the distance was too far. So the manager arranged for a private jet to save us a whole day.

I’ve never been afraid of flying. I didn’t grow up flying, since I come from a poor family, so every flight felt special to me. I know a lot of people fear flying because they hate the lack of control. But for me, that was the comfort—I didn’t have to think. I didn’t have to do anything. I had no control, and that was a relief.

This flight was supposed to be no more than two hours. It had been a stressful summer, and my sleep schedule was wrecked. I barely got three hours of sleep each night. So I was really looking forward to resting in the air, maybe even sleeping the entire flight.

Everything was fine. Peaceful. I felt calm.

Until I stepped onto the plane.

I’m not afraid of flying. Not at all. But something about this flight felt wrong. The moment I stepped inside, my heart started pounding like I’d just run a mile without warming up. Sweat trickled down my back. I felt a stabbing pain in my gut. And then came that falling feeling—like when you’re almost asleep and suddenly feel like you’re dropping off a cliff.

I staggered. A quiet, panicked noise escaped my mouth.

And then—it stopped.

Everything went back to normal. The anxiety vanished. My heart slowed. I couldn’t understand what had just happened. The rest of the crew looked at me with concern and asked if I was okay. I gave a small laugh, shrugged, and said I was probably just tired.

We took our seats. I had a row to myself. I couldn’t shake what had just happened. I rarely get anxiety and had never had a panic attack. But again, I blamed the sleep deprivation.

As soon as I closed my eyes, I was out.

I wish I hadn’t fallen asleep.

Because maybe, just maybe, things would still be normal.

I woke up with a jolt. Chaos. Screaming. Blinking lights. We were falling. The plane was in a nosedive.

The noise was deafening. The screams from the people—you can’t imagine them. It’s nothing like in the movies. When a person knows they’re about to die, the sound that comes out of them is… unspeakable. The worst part is hearing the moment someone realizes they’re about to stop being conscious. Being aware that you won’t be aware anymore—that’s the most terrifying thing of all.

I had never feared death before. And I always thought that in a situation like a plane crash, it would all happen so fast you wouldn’t even process it. But you do. I was fully aware that I was falling. That I was about to crash. That I was going to die. And I couldn’t accept it. I thought people found peace in the end. I didn’t. I screamed. And then everything went black.

I can't see anything. But I feel everything. I feel every bone in my body. I feel the weight of the plane pressing me down. I smell the metallic sent of blood. I feel my skull crushed. I felt the blood pouring out of me. 

I knew, in that moment, that I was about to die. I knew I had only seconds of awareness left. That waiting, inside that pain, was both an eternity and a void. Right before I faded, I heard someone whisper in my ear:

"Now everything turns."



And then I was gone.



Then I existed again. On the plane. Whole. Clean. Safe. Nothing was wrong. I was in shock. I can’t describe that feeling. I had died. Really died. It wasn’t like waking from a dream just before impact. I had been dead. 

Try to imagine how it felt before you were born. You can’t, can you? You can’t because you didn’t exist. There was no awareness to be aware of. That’s what dying felt like.

Like trying to invent a new color. There’s just nothing there. Nothing at all.

And now I existed again. Conscious of my own consciousness.

We had landed. The rest of the crew was already walking off the plane. I looked down at my hands. And stared. And stared.

Something was wrong. Nothing big. Just… missing. Then it clicked. My birthmark. The one on my right palm, at the base of my thumb. It wasn’t there. It was on my left. I turned my hands over. Same thing. The small brown constellation of three dots—my Orion’s Belt—was now on the right hand. Everything was mirrored.

I stood up in a panic, hit my head, and let out a groan. And froze. That didn’t sound like me. I cleared my throat. It sounded wrong. Not like my voice. I didn’t dare say anything else.

I was shaking. Was I having a stroke? What the FUCK was wrong with me? I walked, legs trembling, off the plane and into the fresh air.



It was so surreal. I moved carefully down the steps and walked toward the crew a few feet ahead. I sped up and approached the manager, planning to ask the time and whether the flight had been smooth—I had slept the whole way.

The moment I opened my mouth, I stopped. The voice. It wasn’t mine. I panicked. The manager looked down at me. I panicked harder.

Let’s call him Ollie. I’d been in love with him since the day we met. That kind of love that makes you want to puke. I knew, instantly, I’d never stop loving him. He never loved me back. But we had an affair. He used me. I let him. I knew his body like my own. Every mark, scar, freckle, wrinkle. I loved them all. After we were together, he always had this disgusted look. But I took it, because I knew he’d come back. He wanted my body. I gave it.

But now… now his face was wrong. Not completely. Just… off.

His nose leaned right instead of left. His right eyebrow sat higher. And the scar he had—the one on the left side of his forehead? It was on the right. Ollie was mirrored.

I must have lost my mind. Ollie looked at me like everything was normal. No confusion, no weird reaction. He asked me if I needed anything. I stared, then shook my head.

 must have looked strange. Silent. Staring. But nothing in his expression hinted that he thought anything was weird.

I didn’t speak for the rest of the day. I pointed at my throat and shook my head with a smile to suggest I’d lost my voice. I barely looked at anyone. Because the more I did, the more I saw the reversal.

But it wasn’t just people. Or my reflection. The whole world was wrong. My body was wrong. My heart was beating on the wrong side—left, instead of right. My tattoos were all reversed. Cars drove the wrong way. People shook hands with their right—even though they never had before. And my left hand? My dominant hand? I couldn’t write with it anymore. It looked messy. Childlike. I had no control over it.

It took a while to understand my new voice. I recognized it, but I couldn’t place it. Until it clicked.

It was the voice that whispered in my ear when I died.

And when I woke up, I had a new body, a new voice, a new me.

As I said before, I went mad. But now I’ve accepted that I’m not where I used to be. So now I’m in your world. Where everything is reversed from mine. Back home, everything was left. And now, everything is right.



Yeah, I know. It sounds crazy. But I’m writing this in case someone out there recognizes what I’m saying. In case someone else has ever… "woken up on the wrong side".
