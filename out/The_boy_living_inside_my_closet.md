When I was eight, no-one believed that there was a little boy living in my bedroom closet. At first, he scared me. Each night, after my parents left the room, he’d quietly opened the door until I could see the shine of his huge dark eyes. He didn’t talk. He didn’t move. He only stared until the morning eventually broke.

One day over breakfast, I spoke of the boy to my parents. Mom waved me away with a spatula, pointed to a chair and pushed a stack of pancakes onto the table. Dad didn’t hear me. He was sat opposite, reading a newspaper and blindly stabbing at his food with a fork.

Disappointed, I concluded that my parents were no use. I would never speak of the matter again. Perhaps the boy could tell me what he was.

He visited most nights. My parents pecked me on the cheek, turned out the lights and closed the bedroom door. The stairs groaned, then the television turned on. Moments later, the closet creaked ajar. He was in there somewhere, beyond the thick band of darkness. I peered into the closet, determined to will the boy into existence. 

“Hello?”

My amber nightlight found his unwavering stare. Copper sickles in the shadows.

“Who are you?” I croaked out.

Silence was his only answer. No matter how many times I spoke to him, all he did was stare. And I could never sleep. Instead, we watched each other until the red morning light lanced through the gap in the curtains.

One night, the little boy revealed more of himself to me. 

“Who are you?” I asked, like I did every night.

“A friend,” a voice said from somewhere in the room.

The boy took a half-step forward. His face shone bluish in the moonlight; a pale mask that hovered in the darkness. Those eyes were wide pits of oil. The shape of his face shifted and shivered like something was crawling beneath his flesh. He looked like a bug. Suddenly, I became worried that his face might open. Like the way the sunflowers had bloomed in the garden. 

My heart knocked about in my chest. My breathing was fast and shallow.

“What do you want?”

Silence.

“Can I come into your room?”

I looked at the bedroom door. The thin line of yellow light shining through from the corridor. The distant sound of the TV . Then, I returned to the boy, whose face seemed higher over the ground.

“Why? Don’t you have a room with toys of your own?” 

“I have lots of toys in here. Right at the back of the closet,” he said. The flesh in his cheeks churned out of time to his words. “Maybe you can see them some time.”

Were there really toys in the back of the closet? There were my clothes and shoes and... Dad’s boxes still taped up from when we moved. Maybe the toys were inside? Or behind them? And a room large enough for the little boy and I to play.

The idea of new toys excited me. But, I really didn’t want to go into my closet. Not while it was dark and not while the boy was here. I’d explore it another day, when the sun was high and there was lots of noise in the house. For now, the little boy’s room could wait.

“Maybe later,” I said.

“Okay,” the boy said. His voice was nearly a whisper. “Can I come into your room?”

I looked again at the bedroom door. I noticed the TV was off. Footsteps padded across the carpet outside. Then, with a click of a light switch, the yellow light beneath the door snapped out of view. A door shut somewhere in the house.

Back to that face in the closet. A fragile little hand wrapped around the edge of the door. It moved like a spider. 

I should’ve called out to my Mom or my Dad. Should’ve asked for help said no.

But I didn’t. Even though it felt as though I was doing something wrong I said, “Sure, you can come in and play.”

The little boy pushed the closet door wider than he had ever done before, then dragged out his body. 
At first, I thought he was in a sleeping bag. Like the ones we’d taken camping last summer. Then, as he peeled away from the darkness, I could see a hulking mass of leathery skin, webbed in veins and flecked with shining lumps of scar tissue. 

His body moved weirdly. Sharp shapes pressed against the skin then fell away. Like a sack filled with elbows and knees.

The boy thing slowly dragged it’s way across my bedroom floor using two long spindly limbs. Its movements were awkward and clumsy, as though it was the first time it’d tried. Rasping out laboured breaths, the boy thing eventually pulled itself alongside my bed. 

“What do you want?” I asked with my bedsheets pulled up to my nose.

His giant insect eyes snapping around in his head in all directions until finally locking onto me. Then, with a voice like a detuned radio, he said, “I want show you something special.” 

“What do you mean?”

“Come,” it said, stretching out an arm and pointing towards the closet, “it’s in there. I want you to see it.”

“What?” I asked. My eyes squinting at the dark shapes in my closet, trying to make sense of what the boy thing was pointing to. “What is it?”

The boy thing stared at me for a moment in silence. Then said, “It’s a secret. Just for you and I.”

“What kind of secret?”

The boy glanced about then drew in close. He smelled like the time dad found a dead mouse behind the radiator. Those big black eyes were smoky mirrors. The television screen when the sun is  low in the sky and you can only see yourself. And a mouth that chewed on every word he spoke.

“There are secret rooms in your house. And your parents don’t want you to find them.”
“Why?”

The little boy shrugged. His big eyes blinked one at a time. His face shifting in the moonlight like a shadow on the wall.

“Can you show me where they are?”

He nodded slowly and smiled. “They’re beyond the narrow door.”
