I moved into a new apartment a few weeks ago. The rent was manageable and the place itself was pretty nice.

When I first talked to the landlord, I asked him about the other tenants. He told me that the only one of note was the woman who lived in the apartment above mine. He described her as a hermit. Apparently no one had actually *seen* her in years and her rent was being paid through an inheritance. I jokingly asked if she was actually alive or not. The landlord got a kick out of that, but he assured me that she was.

At the time, I didn’t really think much of it. In fact, a quiet upstairs neighbor sounded pretty nice. 

Unfortunately, I didn’t know what I was in for.

The day after I moved in, I was in the kitchen cooking dinner when I heard some footsteps above me. 

All the apartments in my building have the same floor plan. What this means is that my apartment layout is exactly the same as hers. My kitchen is directly below her kitchen. The same goes for the bathroom, bedroom, hallway, etc. 

A few seconds after I left the kitchen, when I was about halfway down the hall, I heard her footsteps again. When I went into my room and grabbed my phone off the bed, she stopped right above me.

What’s the big deal, right? She was just walking to her bedroom at the same time I was. 

Well, here’s the thing. When I walked out of my bedroom and headed back towards the kitchen, so did she. I could distinctly hear her lumbering steps as I made my way down the hall and into the kitchen. I stopped in front of the stove, and a few seconds later, so did she.

Speaking of her footsteps, they sounded wrong. They were heavy and a bit labored, as if the simple act of walking was difficult.

As the ground beef sizzled in the pan, I decided to test something out.

I quickly walked out of my kitchen and into the living room, stopping in front of my couch.

After a couple seconds, she walked out of her kitchen, followed my exact path, and stopped directly above me.

I left my living room and walked over to my front door.

Sure enough, so did she.

I walked the entire length of my apartment a few times, stopping at one end to let her catch up, and then walking back down to the other.

Somehow, she always knew exactly where I was. And for some reason, she was obsessed with being in the same spot.

“How are you doing that?” I whispered to myself, staring up at the ceiling in disbelief. Before I could test her further, the smell of smoke began to fill my apartment as my dinner burned on the stove.

As I raced back into the kitchen, she tailed closely behind.

It continued on like that for a few days. All day, every day. Any time I was in my apartment, she would follow me from room to room. 

I racked my brain trying to figure out how she knew exactly where I was at all times. I even pressed my ear to my floor to see if I could hear the people below me, but the floors were thick enough that I couldn’t pinpoint their exact position.

One night I woke up around two in the morning to go get a glass of water. As I was holding a cup under the faucet, listening to the flowing water, do you know what I heard?

I heard her fucking floorboards creak as she left her room, went down the hall, and stopped above me.

At first, I tried to ignore it. I really did. But trust me, that is easier than it sounds. The person living above me was obsessed with following me, and that’s kind of a difficult thing to ignore.

It started affecting my sleep schedule. I just couldn’t fall asleep knowing that she was above me, listening to my every movement. 

Multiple times a night, I would get out of bed and go to the other side of my room just to see if she would follow.

She always did. 

No matter how late at night it was, no matter how long it had been since I last moved, she always knew.

It started to get so bad that I actively avoided going home. I would stay at work late, go out drinking, and some nights I would just drive around aimlessly.

You want to know another weird thing? I never heard anything else from her apartment. No running water, no fridge opening, no furniture being moved. The only sound that she ever made was when she would follow me.

One day, when I had a friend over for dinner, I told him what was going on. At first, he didn’t believe me. He thought I was just being paranoid, so I decided to show him. I stood up from the table and walked to the other end of the living room. Without fail, my neighbor followed along. I moved around a bit more, and every time, she tailed along.

“How’s she doing that?” my friend asked. “Like, how does she know where you are?”

“She must just have really good hearing or something,” I sighed.

“Wait, I have an idea,” he said, walking over to where I was standing. We both stood there in complete silence before my friend walked down the hall.

My neighbor didn’t move.

He came back to my position and silently gestured for me to move.

I headed down the hall, and my neighbor followed. When I walked back into the living room, my friend was pale as a ghost.

“Dude,” he said, “she isn’t following the sound of footsteps. She’s following you.”

We tested this out four more times. 

Without saying anything, we would both walk in opposite directions. Every single time, my neighbor chose me. She didn’t follow him a single time. It was always me.

My friend offered to let me stay the night, but I declined. I was sick of being scared to live in my own home.

Later that evening, after my friend had left, I was doing the dishes. When I put the last plate away and stepped into the living room, I heard her creaking floorboards above me.

“Damn it, that does it,” I muttered to myself.

I stormed down the hallway, grabbed a broom from my closet, and stood there. Once I heard my neighbor reach my position, I struck the ceiling with the end of the handle three times.

Then she responded.

Loud stomps reverberated through the ceiling. I was so startled I nearly dropped the broom.

It was as if she was hurling her entire body against the floor, again and again. Each slam came faster, harder, like she was trying to break through the ceiling and punish me.

“Jesus fucking Christ!” I yelled. “Stop! For God's sake just stop!”

To my surprise, she actually did. The loud thuds came to an abrupt end, leaving me in silence.

I collapsed against my wall and sank down to my knees, trying to calm my racing pulse.

Later that evening, I was tossing and turning in bed, as usual. 

I desperately wanted to step outside and smoke a cigarette, but I knew that if I got up, I would have to listen to her follow me. After debating it in my head for nearly twenty minutes, my nicotine addiction won out over my fear. I got dressed, grabbed my keys, my phone, and stepped out into the hall, not even bothering to turn on the lights.

As I made my way down the dark hallway, I noticed something. Or rather, the absence of something.

There were no footsteps above me.

I walked up and down the hall a few times, and there was still nothing. For a moment, I was overjoyed, but then I spotted something.

Something that made my heart race.

My front door was open.

Just a crack, but it was open. 

Hall light spilled through the tiny gap and partially illuminated my living room. As I approached it, I saw that the little chain lock had been snapped clean off.

My breathing became unsteady as I approached the door, lightly testing every step.

And that’s when I heard something that made my stomach churn.

A giggle.

It was faint, but it was there. The unmistakable sound of a woman giggling. And it was coming from my bedroom. 

I slowly turned around and stood by the door, peering down the unlit hallway I had just come from. 

My breathing hitched when I saw it.

Something slowly leaned out of my bedroom doorway. It was so dark that I couldn't make out any features. All I could see was the vague shape of a human head with long, stringy hair.

I couldn’t move. I just stood frozen, mouth open like an idiot. 

The figure giggled again, its voice echoing through the hall. Its weight shifted, and the floorboards creaked beneath it as it stepped out of my bedroom.

That’s when my fight or flight response finally activated.

I threw my front door the rest of the way open and sprinted out of my apartment. I raced down the stairs and burst outside. The warm summer night made me sweat as I ran towards my car. Crickets chirped faintly beneath the sound of my heavy breathing as I got inside and locked the doors.

As I turned my keys in the ignition, I looked through the windshield and up at my bedroom window.

Something was pushing the blinds aside, looking back at me.

I don’t think I’ve ever driven so fast in my life. I peeled out of the parking lot and sped down the road, constantly checking my rear view mirrors. Once I got far enough away, I pulled off to the side of the road and called the cops.

I explained everything to them, and they were at my apartment not long after. They searched the place high and low, but they weren’t able to find anyone. They said that someone definitely broke in, but aside from the destroyed lock, it didn’t look like they had tampered with anything else.

They knocked on my neighbor’s door to try and ask her a few questions, but no one answered. Apparently, her behavior wasn’t enough to convince the cops that she was the one who broke in. And since I didn’t actually have any video evidence, they wrote my suspicion off as paranoia.

I’m staying with my friend now while I look for a new place, preferably something on the top floor this time. I don’t know what was going on with my neighbor, all I know is that it’s not my problem anymore. And now, every time I drive through my old neighborhood, I make sure to stay far away from that apartment building.
