Racing to the building I see the anomaly a huge 9ft arachnid with red spiky fur, and claws for legs

“Are you seeing this Mike?” One of my partners says as we pull up about a mile from the warehouse that’s being destroyed faster than any modern day construction vehicle could

“10-4 Rodney, alright everyone grab your gear time to go” 

“Could put this in your book mr wannabe author” Sydney says laughing 

I scowl back and say 

“Sydney, Rodney, and Lewis y’all go secure the area make sure nothing breaks the perimeter; Carl and Jack y’all are with me we’re gonna try to take this bitch down”

Jack looks at Carl “one last job right?”
Both nodded their heads

“Is this the biggest you’ve seen Mike?” A worried Carl says

“No, but definitely the creepiest” I say trying to sound more confident then afraid 

Grabbing our equipment we split up into our two groups and go to take the creature down

Walking up to the building I see sacks hanging from nearby tree

“Are those?” -Carl
“Looks like it, radio to Sydney let them know to call for backup to take care of these egg sacks behind us” 

“10-4” - Carl says

Closing in on the target I check my automatic m4 with AP rounds, double check my mag and look back to see my crew do the same

About a quarter of a mile away we take aim behind a fallen down tree and begin to fire

“Focus on one leg at a time, if we can rip them off one by one it should bring this fucker down or atleast make it easier to”
“10-4” my crew says as we begin to open fire on the giant spider 

As we open fire the creature lets out a deafening screech as one of its legs get ripped to shreds by bullets 
Now on guard the creature turns to us and starts sprinting towards us as one of its 6 legs drags behind

“OPEN FIRE TARGET THE EYES!” I scream as the creature barrels towards us

Opening fire the bullets seem to damage a few eyes but do little damage to the abdomen 
Only fueling the rage the creature spits some sort of acid like saliva that burns it way through the tree

“FIND BETTER COVER AND WHERES THAT BACKUP” I yell 

As we run from the creature the eggs behind us start to break open releasing a ton of 2-3ft large spiderlings 

“What the fuck” Jack says as we jump over and dodge the incoming trees in our path 

Seeing a huge piece of metal that must’ve been part of the roof of the warehouse me and Jack hide behind it when we hear a death curdling scream from behind 

“CARL!” I yell into my radio peeking over the metal to see him being covered by spiderlings until his screams become muffled and eventually silenced

Jack begins to step himself up like he’s about to run out but before he can I grab him slamming him back down 
“He’s gone I’m sorry Jack but your husband is gone” 
Tears streaming from his face “this was our last job, I had to do one last job” he says now cradling himself 

Slapping him I whisper “get yourself together, if you want a body to bury let’s take this fucker down” I know dark but shit what else am I to say

Nodding Jack gets back onto his feet and wipes his tears radioing to Sydney I say “ETA on backup? We- we lost Carl” I say with sorrow

“Fuck, 5 out just hold a little longer” Sydney says sounding fearful
“We’re keeping the strays away it seems most of the spiders are with you” 

“10-4” I mutter back into my radio 

I scan my surroundings to see a broken down shed behind the warehouse 

“Alright Jack on 3 I’ll run to the shed and you run towards the hill top let’s split these fuckers up”
“1…2…” taking a breath we nod to eachother “3!” I yell running as fast as I can to the shed as we both start shooting the spiderlings running behind us 

Almost behind the building I turn to check on Jack when 
“Swoosh”
A giant legs sends me flying into the shed going through one off the thin metal walls

I awake maybe 3 seconds later to see Jack being burned alive by acid to covered to even hear his screams 

“Fuck, Jacks down” I radio to Sydney
“I think I’m next” I radio over as I see the spider now turning to me and stomping over still dragging the half torn leg 

“Mike! Come in Mike let me know you’re okay backup is almost-“ I look at my radio t 
“Say again… SYDNEY!” I yell as a swarm of spiderlings lifts me up to be eye to eyes with the creature

“I won’t beg” I say to the fucked up looking spider infront of me as I grab an incendiary grenade from my belt and drop it underneath me as the swarm of spiderlings burst into flames underneath me I start falling into the fire

The spider now oozing the acid from its mouth lifts it legs to finish off my now half burnt body
As my vision fades to black I hear one last shot sounding like it was from a Barret M82

Watching the head explode I smile and whisper to myself “backup” as I begin to accept my fate and slip out of consciousness 

3 weeks later surprisingly I woke up in a hospital with the remaining members of my crew apparently having been overran by a swarm of spiderlings themselves 

Turning to a mirror a see half my body is now wrapped in cloth, I guess my nervous system must be fucked because I can’t feel any pain well that or a hell of a lot of drugs

Turning to my right I see Sydney and Lewis

Groaning I say “so y’all both made it out”
She smiles and says “yea better then you apparently”
And the others I ask knowing the answer
“Gone” Sydney says her expression turning sorrowful

“Atleast if you write that book now you’ll have proof from injury’s she says trying to change the attitude in the air

“Yea this will be one hell of a story” I say laying back into the bed
