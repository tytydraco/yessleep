I share this with the hope that maybe some of you have visited this place, but forgot, as it happened to me the first time.  


It all started with a group of people, me included, going somewhere. The trip starts with a trail trough wilderness, many crossroads, if you take the wrong path your dreamscape will change and not reach the final destination, or at least that was my feeling.  There are subtle signs telling which is the right path; for example a pointy rock on one side of the road, while the other has nothing, if you continue following the path that has more features you are on the right track.  


Eventually if you make the right choices, your dreamscape will change into some building with corridors and halls, they are painted trypan blue (#1C05B3) and they are filled with beautiful ladies, tempting you to make a stop and distracting you from your objective.  


Along these corridors there are many rooms and no windows, cigarette butts and trash on the floor, a dark atmosphere lingers. You should not enter the rooms and continue on the main hall which is again, filled with beautiful ladies matching every possible taste. They may also request you something, in this case one of them winked very sexy at me and asked me to deliver something to the end of the road, a Lego character, I found it weird but dreams don't make sense most of the time and for some reason I accepted it. I continued through the dark, blue halls and eventually I reached what seemed like a bar and I realize the group of people is no more, they probably took the wrong turn or stayed with the ladies.  


The dreamscape opens and you can see a landscape trough the bar's windows. It seem like it was day time, while in the corridors for some reason it seems its night time. In the bar there are families who seem to be oblivious of the bar's nature and for some reason it seems to me that its also a hotel.  


I went to the bar tender who looks like a rough underworld bike rider guy and feel the need to present the Lego piece, as it seems this is the end of the road. He looks at me and for some reason I know he is the kind of guy you have to be very careful with what you say, as if I don't treat him with respect or say the wrong thing he will kill you. There's also a chef who has a look of someone who has taken many lives, predator eyes, and also a kind looking server, who also gives the vibe of someone who knows the ins and outs of the underworld. All of them are standing behind the bar's bar.  


After presenting the Lego piece the bar tender tells me that now I can make any request I want. For some unknown reason I tell him that I want to change my name. He then tells me that I would have to pay 400$ for that and then I realize I don't have money with me, as in dreams that is not possible. So I now feel like I'm fucked cuz in some way I disrespected him, asking for something I cannot afford. The chef gives me a mean look and the atmosphere suddenly feels heavy; I try to think what to do next.  


I look around the bar's bar and I see famous people is there too, among them Taylor Swift and Zendaya of all people, both asking the bar tender their own requests, and I cannot avoid the feeling that this place is familiar and suddenly I remember, I've been here before, the wilderness trail, the blue halls, the bar... But never got to speak to the bar tender, so this is my second time here.  


After that realization, the bar tender tells me: "Do I know you? you have been here before, right?"

And then adds: "Remember, there's people who are full cups and people who are empty cups."  


After apologizing to the bar tender for my disrespectful request in the best way possible to not make him angry,  I try to make my way back out of the bar, tracing my steps back through the corridors and halls; for some reason I know if I don't trace my steps back I wont be able to wake up again and get stuck there. On the way out some of the dreamscape change but if you take the turns with more features it will eventually lead you out to the wilderness trail.  


As I finally was about to reach the wilderness trail, exiting the corridors and halls that's it, the dream ends, but when I wake up I remember all of this and feel like this place exists somewhere on the oneiric realm, but is very hard to get to.  


It might seem like a rant or a crazy person's dream, but for some reason I feel compelled to write about it as I went there twice, and the best thing is this is a real story of a real dream that happened to me.  


About the famous people, I don't know why it was those two, is not like I'm a fan or follow them on social media, they were just there, asking for requests.  


Who knows, maybe this directions will help some experienced dreamer to get there and prove this oneiric place exists...
