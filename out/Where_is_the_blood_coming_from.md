I'm a longtime lurker here and thought I would share something that happened to my parents about 30 years ago. I'm a huge fan of paranormal stories, I love trying to rack my brain for explanations but this story has always stumped me, my parents (both skeptics) and anyone they've shared it with. So I'd love to hear if anyone else has experienced anything like this or has a reasonable explanation for it.

In 1995, my parents lived in Bangalore, India for about a year due to a contract job my dad had found there. It was meant to be a temporary gig so when his office offered them a duplex apartment to rent, they gladly took it. It came with the usual perks of upper middle class India, i.e., a couple of bustling maids that took care of the cleaning, groceries, and most of the cooking. Life was bliss for them, a childless almost newly-married couple, with basically everything taken care of.

At the time, my mum wasn't working so she stayed at home while my dad went to work. On their floor, there was another apartment with an older woman living in it, who she politely said hello to a few times but she always looked at my mum a bit strangely and that made her a bit uncomfortable. On their third or fourth interaction, the older woman asked her, "Are you okay living in that flat?", to which my mum had probably nodded, and she asked her again, "Do you not sense anything?", which was a confusing question to my mum but the woman didn't explain further. Eventually, she started telling mum to not stay there by herself whenever she ran into her, and my mum thought maybe she was just a bit confused and paranoid, maybe due to her age.

On some random sunny and cool morning, at around 8 AM, everything was normal. One of the maids had just mopped the floor, my mum and paternal grandmother (who was visiting them briefly) were in the kitchen, and my dad was in the living room on one of the armchairs, reading the newspaper. The set up was such that there were two armchairs with a small table in the middle for the landline phone, and a large balcony with sliding doors to the left, if you were sitting on one of the chairs.

The phone rang. My mum picked it up, and it was a relative calling them to break the news that my maternal great grandmother had passed away, she was over 90 and had passed due to natural causes. My mum was very close to her grandmother so she was naturally quiet upset. She then handed the receiver to my dad to also speak to whoever was calling them. When he stretched his arm to take it, a big drop of something that looked like blood fell on the floor. Then another smaller drop fell after that, then another one, and another one, until it finally stopped near the sliding doors, skipping my dad's feet. They describe it as the kind of blood you'd see if you cut your wrist open.

After speaking and hanging up the phone, both of them stared at each other in absolute confusion. The maid had just cleaned the floors, neither of them were cut anywhere, the ceiling had no leaks...then what just happened? Even though they were skeptics, they could not find a single reasonable explanation to what that was. The maid, who was still around, refused to go anywhere near it so it stayed. Eventually, the "blood" dried up, and turned brownish and powdery. With time, they had to stop dwelling on whatever that was and their lives went back to normal. My mum, a little confused and concerned, took the old woman's advice and would now spend her afternoons at a nearby library. My dad would meet her there on the way back from work, and then they'd come home together.

Months passed, and this incident had been pushed aside almost entirely. It was their last night in that house. The following morning, they would catch an early flight and leave Bangalore for good. They were both in their bedroom, packing and organizing for the trip. My mum accidentally dropped something on the ground and when she went to pick it up, it was action replay. The exact same thing happened again, one big drop followed by smaller drops, skipping her hand. This time, it freaked them out to the point of them considering a hotel for the few hours they had left in that house. They left Bangalore without any explanation for it.

The next young couple that was scheduled to move in there were also friends of my parents, contracted by the same company. They were even bigger skeptics and paid no heed to anything my parents told them, and so they moved in. On some night, the wife woke up thirsty in the middle of the night and walked downstairs to the kitchen to get some water. When she was on her way back up the stairs, the same thing happened. With every step she took, a drop of blood fell next to her foot, and then another, and another. It scared her tremendously and she had an epileptic seizure and fell. The sound woke her husband up, and he came running and helped her back to bed. She was eventually fine.

In the morning, however, the husband was convinced that it was some kind of practical joke. He scraped up the blood, now dried, using some stiff cardboard and put it in a tiny bottle to get it tested at a lab on the way to work. When he stepped out of the building, he hailed an autorickshaw or auto for short (3-wheeler, also called a tuktuk elsewhere) and got in. The second he got in, the driver somehow lost all control, the auto spun 360 degrees, flung him and his office bag out. The driver was fine but the husband had a broken arm, and the tiny bottle couldn't be found anywhere even though it was in a deep pocket in his zipped office bag.

There are a few smaller instances from this apartment but this is quite long already so I'll close it here. Lastly, the apartment still exists and we've passed by it several times during our trips to Bangalore.
