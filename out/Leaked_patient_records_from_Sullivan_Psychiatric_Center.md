>Mom and dad fought today. It was loud. Me and Abigail stayed in my room and played barbie dolls. Abigail makes me play Ken but today she played Ken cos she knew I was sad. I like playing with Abigail better than with my older sister Jane coz Jane always makes me play Ken even when Im sad.

I dont know what Abigail looks like coz she always wears a white thing on her face. She says its called a “vail” like she’s going to get married which I think is pretty funny.  
>  
>Abigail is my best friend. I dont know how old she is but I think shes younger than me coz shes the one who wants to play barbie dolls all the time but I dont say anything because I dont want to hurt her feelings.  
>

>  
>I dont even tell Abigail this but some times I wake up and he is on the ceiling. I know right!! He hangs there and stares at me and his eyes get all black. Then I get scared and ask dad what are you doing but I don’t remember anything else. I think I just went back to sleep.  
>  
>***06/01***  
>  
>I dont want to write stuff down but Abigail says I should do it whenever they fight so Im doing it again. Today dad got mad and I dont know why coz he didnt look madder than usual but mom got scared and she said go back to your room now. So I did and I hid in there and downstairs I heard mom crying a lot and screaming leave my family alone dont hurt my girl.

>  
>***06/03***  
>  
>{There is no written entry for this date. \[Patient\] included a drawing in crayon of what appears to be a very dark, small space, similar to a closet. There is a figure curled up in the corner. All around this figure are distorted figures with glowing green eyes. \[Patient\] refuses to provide context for the drawing, but when pressed, \[he/she\] claims that the figures are dancing.}  
>  
>***06/14***  
>  
>Today when I came home from school everything was quiet which is weird coz mom is always home. I found her in the kitchen but she was facing away from me and she smelled really bad. I hugged her and her skin ripped a little bit and it was all black and REALLY nasty and I got scared and said mom whats wrong and she turned around and said nothing sweety and her eyes were black. I went up to my room coz she was scaring me and Abigail was there.

>***06/15 - 5:39 PM***  
>  
>Diary I dont like this. Im in my room and Im crying mom is downstairs but it isnt her. Dad hasnt been home since yesterday and I can hear her she keeps calling and calling me and saying \[REDACTED\] come downstairs I love you sweety I just want to hold you and laughing. Her laugh sounds really weird diary. Its really deep just like dads voice and kind of rumbly but it kinda sounds like its a bunch of people talking at the same time. But only when she laughs.  
>  
>She keeps coming up to my door and saying let me in but the door isnt locked. Abigail told me not to open the door or she would get me. I dont know what that means.  
>  
>I got home from school and Abigail made me go to my room and shut the door and she said “I have to go now but you have to stay here and when your mom gets home dont open the door no matter what she says coz shes trying to trick you”  
>  
>I said why coz I love my mom and Abigail said thats not your mom even though it is.

>***06/15 - 6:06 PM***  
>  
>{There is no written entry here; \[Patient\] has provided a drawing. We see a line drawn in crayon in the middle of the page. On the right side is a figure crouching on the floor, and on the left side is a shadowy silhouette with glowing green eyes and disproportionate features—the most noteable example being its extremely long extremities. There is a speech bubble coming from its mouth that reads, “Please let me in I \[illegible\] you sweety.” The figure on the right has large teardrops coming down its face, colored in blue.}  
>  
>***06/15 - 6:14 PM***  
>  
>Mom is mad at me she says come out or Im going to hurt you I mean it. Shes banging on the wall and scratching it I think and yelling and screaming. Im so scared. I dont know where Jane is.

>  
>I havent written in a long time coz everything has been ok. Dad and Jane still isnt back but mom isnt weird anymore and I asked her if she was ok and she said what do you mean sweety.  
>  
>Tonight for dinner she made some soup and I love moms cooking but the soup smelled really weird. It made me feel sick to my tummy. I asked her what was in it and she said it had a special kind of chicken I havent tried that she picked up today and that she knew I would love it. She said Jane was joining us for dinner tonight but I think she said that to get me too eat coz I couldnt see her anywhere.  
>  
>I couldnt do it diary. I was really hungry but I couldnt eat the soup. Earlier I saw mom chopping up some meat and it was bright red and it smelled soooo bad. I went up to my room and now Im writing in my diary.  
>  
>i dont want to go to sleep. Im afraid that shes going to be on my ceiling when I wake up. I dont like it when dad does it and I wonder if maybe she’ll do it coz recently she doesnt act like mom anymore.  
>  
>***06/28***  
>  
>I keep waking up with a bunch of bruises and stuff all over my arms and legs and sometimes my face. Today I had a big scratch on my forehead. Abigail seemed really worried even though it didnt hurt a lot and she made me bandage it before I went to school.  
Today my teacher Ms Cunningham asked me if I was ok and I said yeah why coz Abigail said if anyone finds out then theyll take me away. Ms Cunningham looked worried and she talked to someone on the phone and made me stay after class.  
>  
>I got really scared coz I wanted to be home before mom. Finally I ran out of the classroom and I know its bad I feel so bad dairy. But I got home and went to my room but then on my bed I dont know what it was. It made me really sick diary. It was all of this red stuff and bones like the kind that dogs chew and there was some slimy pinky things everywhere and I think I saw a heart in there.  
>  
>I started crying and I ran out of the room and into the bathroom. Abigail came and she sang me a song and I kept crying and crying until mom got home.  
>  
>***06/29***  
>  
>I was so hungry I finally took a sandwich from mom for lunch. I got to school and I took it out of my bag and I felt some stuff on my hand. Then I pulled it out and there were a hundred billion ants all over my hand. They were crawling everywhere they had eaten all of my sandwich meat and made holes in the bread.  
>  
>I started crying and then I couldnt stop. Ms Cunningham took me to the nurses office. The nurse said I had a panic attack and made me stay in there.  
>  
>She asked who I have at home and I said Abigail. she said is that your sister and I told her that Abigail was my best friend and we did lots of cool stuff together and she could do tricks like appear and disappear and go through the wall. I told her I had a sister but Jane hasnt been home so maybe she went camping like she did last year.  
>  
>The nurse looked sad. I dont know why. Then she asked if anyone else was there and I said no just me and my mom. The nurse said ok I’ll call your mom and I got scared. I said NO NO NO and started crying really bad and the nurse got really scared but she called my mom anyway.  
>  
>My mom came and picked me up and she seemed normal. I think she got taller and one of her legs is bent so she cant really walk well. She still smelled bad but she also smelled like the stuff my sister wears in the morning in all those pretty pink glass bottles she wont let me touch.  
>  
>Mom said “thanks for looking after her shes a handful but I love her so much” then she took my hand and her hand was really cold and I could feel her skin falling off. It was all rotten in there like steak in the fridge for too long. I tried not to cry.  
>  
>I finally finally went home and I went to bed without eating Im scared of ants.  
>  
>***06/29***  
>  
>I woke up and mom was on my ceiling just like I was scared of. Except she didnt look like mom at all. Her skin was black and falling off and underneath it I could see all of her bones and her blood and I started screaming and crying. Her eyes were green to.  
>  
>Mom smiled at me really wide and her teeth were too big and behind them I could see a whole other bunch of teeth there were so many. Then her tongue came out and it was so long and I started screaming loud. She was talking in all those voices and saying you cant run anymore I have you to myself.  
>  
>Abigail came in and stood in between me and mom she said the time for your games is all done and called mom a name that wasnt hers.  
>  
>Suddenly she started glowing really bright. Mom started screaming a lot and there was black stuff coming from her mouth getting all over. Then Abigail said close your eyes \[REDACTED\] so I did and there was this noise and when I opened my eyes mom was gone.  
>  
>I saw Abigail she was sitting on the floor so I ran and I didnt think about it and I hugged her. She yelled at me but not soon enough.  
>  
>I felt bad so I jumped back and then I saw that her veil fell off and I could see her face. She wasnt my age at all like I thought. She was an old lady. She had so many wrinkles and her eyes were really far back in her head. She smiled at me and said its ok \[REDACTED\] I protected you but you need to leave now.  
>  
>I said Abigail what do you mean and she started crying she said go get out of here I’ll come with you later. She said run out of the house so I did.  
>  
>Outside there were a bunch of flashing lights and scary men in black clothes. One of them took me and asked all these questions like where is your mom and are you hurt and I said no and I dont know and I told them that Abigail was in the house but they didnt listen to me.  
>  
>***06/30***  
>  
>{This is the last entry in the diary that \[Patient\] has submitted to us. In it there is a drawing of a large, grotesque figure with black skin, which is peeled away in parts to reveal jagged protrusions of blood and what looks like a mass of organs hanging out of its stomach. Its eyes are bright green and it smiles with a mouth full of teeth. All of its limbs are bent at awkward angles—most mentionable is its left arm, which is twisted into an almost rectangular shape.  
>  
>The page adjacent shows an image of a girl wearing a white dress. Her hair is gray, and her skin is covered in wrinkles and not filled in. Her eyes are black.}

>END TRANSCRIPTION

\[Patient\] explained that these entries were written days before Jennifer Cunningham tipped the police line of a potential child abuse case and an investigation took place, during which authorities discovered raw human flesh stored all over the house, as well as multiple discarded and rotting pieces of entrails (among the identified pieces were two hearts, a kidney, a pancreas, and chunks of the large and small intestines—varying sizes indicate that multiple different victims were involved).

Underneath the house, there was a basement which may have once served as a bomb shelter. The floor, walls, and ceilings were covered in red paint and symbols which experts have identified as Satanic sigils. There were also various stains of blood, vomit, saliva, and fecal matter.

The patient in question has been transferred to a secure mental health facility to treat diagnoses of post traumatic stress, paranoid schizophrenia, psychotic depression, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, major depressive disorder, and others. The investigation is still underway, with primary suspects including \[Patient\]’s parents, who may have been involved in cult activity. There is no record of recorded missing cases under the names “Abigail” or “Jane” during the time that \[Patient\] claims that both respectively did so. “Abigail” was most likely an imaginary friend, whereas “Jane” may be among the unidentified victims whose brutalized remains were discovered scattered around the house.
