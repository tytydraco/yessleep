I think I’m being punished for what I did. Maybe I deserve what’s happening to me. Most people will think so, but why don’t I deserve a second chance? Is what I did so bad?

-

I know a guy named Andy. We’ve worked in the same business for over ten years now, and he’s always been a schlub like me until the last few months. 

He was always a little overweight, had thinning hair, and deteriorating ambitions that come with middle age. He was in that nice comfortable rut where you’re making just enough money to look down on most people, but somewhere in the back of his mind was a little voice that told him that he was meant for more.

I’m the same way. As the years go by, that voice gets weaker and weaker. Time devours everyone’s dreams, and like most people, Andy and I both were actively feeding it from our own hands. Spiritual suicide.

One day that changed for Andy.

He came into the office and something was different. Everyone could tell that something had changed, but no one was able to put their finger on what exactly it was. He was always the nicest guy, but he was always a little melancholy. I think that’s what I noticed first. He seemed truly happy.

That first day, he made one trade. He took more money than he should have, and put all his eggs in that one basket. The next day, out of nowhere, he tripled that account. He did that over and over again for a month.

He started to look better, not younger, just better. He lost the weight, his eyes were no longer tired but bright, and he was always reading or spouting off some kind of obscure but interesting thing he had just learned. He had a spring in his step and a power to his speech that just made everyone who happened to talk to him feel better. 

He had been in that office for so many years that he had faded into the background and became no more remarkable than the fake plants that decorated so many of the offices. But then, over a period of a week, he became everyone’s favorite person. Fucking Flanders. Everyone and everything was attracted to him, including money.

His wife would come by the office every once in a while, and she seemed to have gone through the same change. I fucking hated how happy they looked.

One night I came home to my wife and looked around our house. An empty husk with staged family photos of kids who no longer talked to me, long dead pets, and a time ravaged wife who I resented for sticking with a fucking loser like me. My existence was hollow.

Midway through dinner, I got up without a word and walked to my office while my wife asked me what was wrong.

“Everything. You, me, the kids, my fucking life. Everything.”

Was that me talking? I wonder about it now. How much of the horrible things I’ve done were actually me?

I got a hotel that night, and for the third time since I’ve been married, I paid for sex. It wasn’t something I’m proud of, but I thought it would make me feel better. More vigorous and youthful somehow.

It didn’t.

-

“Andy! Andy, can I take you out to lunch today? I’ve really got a problem and I’m hoping you can help me fix it.” It was the best way to try and get him alone. He gave me that new stupid smile he always had on his face and agreed.

I was lost and I needed help.

-

I talked with him over two plates of outrageously priced pasta for an hour. I asked him what his secret was in every way possible, but he just kept saying it was clean living. I kept pressing and pressing to no avail, just the same new age shit.

“Andy, I’ve been diagnosed with cancer. I’m not looking for a cure, but I would like to live out the rest of my life having tried something different. Seriously, I need whatever the hell it is you’ve got. I want to have a few good years with Helen and my kids.” 

I didn’t give a shit about my wife. I didn’t give a shit about my kids. I didn’t have cancer. What I had was a fucking boring life and a fucking brilliant knack for lying. I also had a face that was able to sell whatever bullshit I was spewing, and that moron fell for it just like I knew that he would.

He pushed his plate to the side and leaned closer over the table. In that dimly lit Italian restaurant, my life changed forever.

“Would you believe it if I told you that you might not really be you? That you’ve passively given consent over the years to living a life that you don’t have to live?”

“What the fuck does that mean?” He frowned at the profanity.

“Like, what if the world over years and years, poisons all of us with all the garbage we consume? Like there’s something in us that feeds off of all that junk, and just grows and grows. Until we just give up any fight we had in us because something in our brains tells us that it would be better to just give in. My wife gave me a secret. She had been going through an inspiring change, and I fell in love with her all over again. 

Everything about her changed. Not just the outside superficial stuff, it’s like she got back a lot of that stuff I remembered about her from high school. That spark. She started asking me questions. Getting me to think about who I really was.”

My lying face was interested, but inside I was rolling my metaphorical eyes. He went on and on about his fucking wife and the fucking kids that they never had because they were both too busy with jobs that didn’t really mean anything.

I wanted to tell him that kids weren’t all that they were cracked up to be. Mine were a couple of dream and time vacuums with voracious appetites.

“When she thought I was ready to hear it, she finally told me this little secret that she had stumbled onto. A friend of hers gave her a couple of pills.”

“Drugs?”

“Kind of. I’m not really sure what they are. I’m only allowed to tell one person about this, and if what you’re telling me is true, maybe I can help you more than you know.”

“What do you mean?”

“Maybe it can help with the cancer.”

I forced my eyes to well up. There’s nothing more pathetic than a man who is on the verge of crying and holding it back to look stoic. Andy “Flanders” ate it up and even reached across the table to grab hold of one of my hands. 

“I’m gonna help you.”

Bingo.

-

The next day, Andy gave me two small pills.

“Take these tonight. Rent a hotel room and grab a bunch of fast food. Something really bad for you. Take one before you eat, and one about a half an hour after you’re done. This is important. You need to do this exactly as I’m telling you, and there is a risk.”

“What risk?”

“You need to be alone with no chance of someone around. Once you take these, you’ll be in pain for a little while, but if anyone else is around, they won’t be safe. If you’re being honest with me about everything, then it’s going to be painful, but you’ll be okay. If you’re not being honest with me, it could go really bad. Way beyond bad actually. You are being honest, aren’t you?”

“Andy, I’ve never been more honest with anyone than I have been with you the last couple of days.”

He smiled that stupid smile and clapped my shoulder.

“Tomorrow, everything is going to be different for you. Call me tomorrow and I’ll tell you what happens next.”

-

Later that night, I did everything he told me, up until a certain point. I had rented a hotel room and got two bags of Five Guys. I looked at the pills, and I stopped before I even started.

I began to wonder what could go bad. Why did he have to be so damn cryptic? He didn’t mention death or anything, but I wondered what might happen.

It didn’t take me long to figure out I couldn’t go through with it without knowing the consequences, and it didn’t take me long to figure out what the next step was.

-

I hardly spent any effort asking Helen to forgive me; she had always been easy. She always forgives me and maybe that’s where some of the resentment came from. She had already eaten, so I opened a bottle of wine and crushed up the first pill, and poured it into her glass.

I needed to make sure the pills were safe for me to take. I didn’t feel comfortable taking them in some hotel room where if something went wrong, no one would know.

I thought if anything terrible did happen to Helen, I’d be there to make sure that she got help right away. If something great happened to her, then I would simply tell Andy that I needed another couple of pills to give to my wife, and then take them myself.

It was a win, win.

I watched her for thirty minutes and nothing about her changed. I let her drone on and on about things we could do to make our lives better, knowing full well that if everything went to plan with these pills, I would leave her regardless of the positive effects that they might have on her. I was hoping for a whole new life; why would I start it with the woman who fucked up the previous one? That’s what I thought, anyway.

Another glass and the other pill.

It was a long night of listening to her talk. We finished two bottles before she was ready for bed, and nothing had changed about her whatsoever.

On one hand, I was relieved that nothing bad would have happened to me had I taken the pills, but on the other, I was furious that no change seemed to occur at all.

I fell asleep next to her after telling her multiple times that I wasn’t in the mood for sex. 

-

I remember the smell woke me up before the wetness did. Then I heard Helen groan and vomit.

She ran for the bathroom, spewing out of both ends.

I got up to watch. She was sitting on the toilet and vomiting into the wastebasket.

“Oh my God! My stomach! Don’t come in here!”

She kicked the door closed before she heaved again.

“Helen? What do you want me to do?”

“Nothing, just… just try and clean up the bed please.”

“Ok.”

I stripped the bed and I was gagging at the smell of everything that was on the sheets. Some of it was on my leg, and even though I wanted to stay to hear what was going on, I ran to the spare bathroom to wash it off.

I hurried back as quickly as I could, and I heard the shower.

“Helen? Helen?”

After a moment, I opened the door and saw that she had climbed into the shower. The bathroom floor was slick with everything that had come out of her. 

“I’m so sick. Do I have food poisoning?”

“Do you want me to call a doctor?”

“No. I’m just sick.”

Her face was bright red, and her nightgown was plastered to her body. I remember feeling more relief than guilt. I thought she was going to be ok, but I was determined to get back at Andy for what he did.

“God, my insides are all in knots.”

I remembered that he had told me that it would be painful, but it seemed to be going quickly for Helen, whatever the hell it was doing. She stood up and exhaled loudly.

“This is embarrassing. I’m ok.”

“Don’t be embarrassed honey, it’s ok.” I turned toward the bed and thought to myself that we were going to have to sleep in one of the guest bedrooms. There was no cleaning our mattress. That’s when I heard Helen scream.

When I turned, she was looking down. Something long and black was squirming down her leg, and it was coming out of her backside.

“Oh my God! Jeffery! Jefferey!”

She slipped in the tub and fell down. Before she could say another word, or I could grab my phone, more things began to crawl out of her. They were like thin black worms that whipped about in agony springing out from inside of her; dying things looking for something to hold onto. 

She was screaming and I was standing there in shock. It happened so quickly. The worms writhed in the bottom of the tub finding nothing to grasp, and then they extended upwards, finding a grip on the safety bar. They contracted and became thicker. The safety bar groaned as the tile that it was attached to began to give. A thick fleshy mass attached to the end of the worms spilled out of my wife and slopped onto the surface of the soiled tub.

Helen kicked it as she got to her feet and staggered out of the bathroom. It made a painful sound that I can’t possibly explain. Like some beast crying out underwater. She collapsed next to me, and I held her while we watched it thrash  and cry inside the tub.

“What the hell is that thing?”

I couldn’t say anything. I just stared at it as it convulsed in the tub. The arms were extending and jerking into the air, slapping against the shower walls. Andy’s words ran in my mind.

“*Like there’s something in us that feeds off of all that junk, and just grows and grows. Until we just give up any fight we had in us because something controlling our brains tells us that it would be better to just give in.*”

“It’s some kind of parasite.” Helen looked up at me.

“What?”

“Andy. Andy gave me some pills.”

“Andy Tackett?”

“Yeah.” I was stunned. Shocked. I should have shut up. I wasn’t thinking. “He said something about things growing inside of us, and then he gave me pills to get rid of it. I just wanted to know that they worked. That it wasn’t some kind of trick.”

“What did you do?”

“Nothing.” I was still watching the thing dying in the tub. The water from the shower was pelting its leathery skin, and began to make sucking noises against the wet porcelain.

“Did you give me some kind of pills? Why would you do that to me?”

I looked down at her, and before I could even say anything else, I felt something wrap around my ankle. 

It started to burn. 

Helen pushed away from me and crab walked across the floor backwards as fast as she could while those worms extended out of the tub. It felt like thick rubber bands were tightening around my leg.

I tried to crawl away, but my head felt heavy and there was a warmth spreading upwards from where the worms were squeezing against me.

All my limbs were jelly and I felt like something was taking over my brain. Inside my mind. I couldn’t scream. It was drugging me. Helen was standing a good distance away from me, and her face was a mask of horror while the thing slowly pulled itself out of the tub and undulated across the bedroom floor. Helen ran out of the room while it began to crawl inside of me. Its muscles were contracting and relaxing and contracting again as it squeezed inside and upwards through my guts.

I blacked out.

-

The next morning, I felt sick. All the mess was still there, but Helen was gone. I tried to call her cell, but she wouldn’t pick up. I called an ambulance. I obviously couldn’t tell them what happened, but I needed help. I told them I had severe stomach pains and I felt like I was dying.

Several tests were run, and I insisted on an x-ray. Nothing was found. Just like Helen, whatever it was that had crawled inside of me was gone.

I felt relief, but I had never felt so sick in my life.

I stayed home for a few days. Andy came by the house on the fourth day. He wouldn’t come inside.

“Andy. Andy, I need help. The doctors say there’s nothing there, but I feel terrible.”

“You should. They’ll never find them, but there’s two of them inside of you now. They’re going to be fighting each other to feed.”

“I need the pills, Andy.”

“If you had done what I said, the one inside of you would have died without a host.”

“I need the pills.”

“That’s not how it works. I was only allowed to give it to one person. Now Helen has the choice of who she helps.”

“Andy, please help me!”

“She’s doing fine by the way, in case you’re interested.”

“Helen? She talked to you?”

“That night. She came to our house. We explained everything to her. You know, the things you didn’t explain before you gave her pills that were meant for you. How could you do that to your wife?”

“She’s better now though, right?”

“That’s not the point. You could have taken them yourself, and then explained everything to her so she could make that decision for herself.I don’t know how long you’ve got carrying two of them. You better pray that your wife forgives you. She has children she could help instead of you.”

He turned and left me.

-

Helen hasn’t forgiven me, or spoken to me. My health is declining and I finally broke down and explained to a couple of doctors what happened. They think I’m crazy. I know there’s only one way to get better. If there’s anyone out there reading this, who went through something similar, please reach out to me. I need help. I don’t know how long I have.

I’m so sorry for everything I’ve done my entire life. Somebody help [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyhorribles/).
