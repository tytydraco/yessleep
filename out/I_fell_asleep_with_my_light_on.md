*I can’t move.*

The words repeat in my head, slow and flat.

My eyes are closed, but the room is still there: a dull orange glow pressed against the inside of my eyelids. The lamp. I left it on. I remember that much.

I try to open my eyes.

Nothing.

I try to lift my hand.

Nothing.

My breath is the only thing I can feel. In. Out. Too loud in my chest.

Then something else joins it.

A low buzzing. Not in the room. In my ears. Like power in the walls. Like the house itself is humming. It swells until it’s all I can hear, then fades just enough to remind me it’s still there.

I swallow. It doesn’t work.

From the hallway, there’s a whisper.

So soft I almost miss it.

Not words. Just the shape of a voice.

It stops.

The buzzing fills the space it leaves.

Then the whisper comes back.

Closer.

This time, I catch something in it.

A breath, and then a word.

My name.

So quiet it barely exists.

Cold prickles crawl up my arms.

My door is open. I know I left it open.

The whisper drifts past the doorway, fades, then returns again. Back and forth. Like someone pacing just out of sight.

Another breath.

Then a word, pushed out on warm air, low and soft, like it’s meant only for me.

“Here.”

I try to call out. My throat doesn’t move.

The whisper breaks into pieces. Little breaths. Little sounds. Too close together to be wind. Too uneven to be anything else.

Then footsteps.

One creak in the floor.

A pause.

Another.

They pass the doorway.

Stop.

The buzzing grows louder in my ears.

The footsteps turn around.

Then come back.

This time they don’t pass. They stop right outside my room.

I hold my breath without meaning to.

Nothing happens.

Then one slow step crosses the threshold.

The orange glow behind my eyelids dims, just slightly. As if something tall has moved between me and the light.

Something is in my room.

I feel it before it touches me. The air changes. The space beside the bed fills.

The mattress sinks.

Slow. Gentle. The weight settles in beside me, close enough that the sheet tightens between our bodies.

Warm.

My heart pounds so hard it hurts.

I try to scream. My mouth won’t open.

The bed creaks as it shifts, fitting itself to me. A leg. A hip. A body pressed along my back.

Then it breathes.

Right against the back of my neck.

The air is warm. Damp. It lifts the tiny hairs there and lets them fall again. The sound is deep and close, not matching my own breath at all.

I am completely still.

One breath.

Then another.

Each one closer than the last, until it feels like its mouth is almost touching my skin.

Something inside me pushes. Fights.

My chest jerks.

Air tears into my lungs in a broken gasp.

My fingers twitch.

The breathing behind me stops.

I drag in another breath. My toes curl. My jaw cracks open.

The weight lifts.

The mattress rises as the space behind me empties.

I can move.

I lurch forward, sucking in air, rolling onto my back, my eyes fly open—

The room is empty.

The lamp glows. The door is still open. The hallway is dark and quiet.

Nothing is there.

I sit up, shaking.

Then I touch the back of my neck.

It’s still warm.
