My brother, Johnny, passed away when he was only six years old after a lengthy battle with leukemia. His death rocked my entire family, but Mom took it particularly hard. She’d been adamant that he would eventually take a turn for the better. That one day, all the years of taxing treatments and costly medical procedures would finally pay off. But they never did. All the prayers in the world couldn’t prevent the inevitable.  
  
Mom became a bit of a recluse after that. She was often inconsolable, weeping for hours in the somewhat comforting familiarity of Johnny’s room. Dad and I did our best to help her, of course, but her grief overwhelmed her. Weekly therapy sessions, family excursions, nightly prayer circles. Nothing worked.   
  
One evening I shuffled past Johnny’s room on my way to the kitchen, when I saw her sitting on his bed, silently flipping through his favorite children’s book. I scanned the room, heart shattering all over again upon seeing all of Johnny’s discarded toys lying exactly where he’d left them. It was like a time capsule. A pertinent reminder of what we’d lost. I cautiously approached Mom, choosing my words carefully so as not to upset her.   
  
“H-hey, Mom. Mind if I sit?”  
  
She glanced up at me, then back down at the storybook before giving me an approving nod. I tenderly plopped down next to her as she turned to the final page.   
  
“But then, he nibbled a hole in the cocoon, pushed his way out, and he was a beautiful butterfly.”  
  
A single tear trickled down her cheek as she closed the book.   
  
“He always loved that story. I still read it to him every night, in case somehow he can hear it.”  
  
“That’s really sweet, Mom. I’m sure he looks forward to it every day.”  
  
She gazed blankly at a mountain of stuffed animals stacked precariously in the corner.   
  
“I miss him so much, David. What I wouldn’t give for just one more second with my little boy. It’s not fair! Out of all the children in the world, why did He have to take *my* baby?”  
  
She broke down into hysterical sobs, her languished wails echoing off the periwinkle walls. I held her for a long time, unable to prevent the tears from spilling from my own eyes. After what felt like an eternity, Mom finally wiped her face with her sleeve, and I relinquished her from my grip. We sat in silent memoriam, our sporadic sniffles the only noise to drag us back to reality.   
  
“David?”  
  
“Yeah, Mom?”  
  
“Do you remember the tiny music box Johnny used to carry around with him?”  
  
I chuckled lightheartedly.   
  
“How could I forget? He wouldn’t let it out of his sight.”  
  
“Can you help me find it?”  
  
I cracked a broken smile.   
  
“I sure can.”  
  
We searched for the music box for hours to no avail. We looked under the bed, in the closet, behind all the furniture. It wasn’t anywhere to be found. We left no plushie unturned, but we still couldn’t locate it.   
  
We were forced to call it a night. I trudged to my room, promising Mom that I wouldn’t abandon our mission. I was determined to find it. But after a week of relentless scouring yielded no results, I was beginning to lose hope. Mom, however, wasn’t so quick to surrender.   
  
“Mom, I hate to say it, but I don’t think we’re going to find it. We must have searched this room a thousand times over.”  
  
“David, I know it’s here. Maybe there’s somewhere we haven’t looked. His closet?”  
  
“Already checked it.”  
  
“What about the nightstand?”  
  
“I’ve sifted through it countless times. Look, Mom, I think we’re just going to have to accept the fact that it’s gone.”  
  
Tears welled in her eyes, as the thin dam holding them back began to falter. Well stood in tense silence, Mom mulling over my words.  
  
“No. I won’t give up. It’s here somewhere and I will find it,” she said, a twinge of frustration seeping into her tone.  
  
I nodded. I stepped out, sensing that she could use some time to herself.   
  
That night I again slipped by Johnny’s room. The door was closed, which was a rare occurrence, but not unheard of. I pressed my ear to the wood, trying to gauge if it was a good time to pop in. That’s when I heard it. The music box.   
  
The all too familiar tune of Claude Debussy’s “The Nutcracker” drifted from within, the notes floating like feathers to caress my ears with their harmonious melody. I flung open the door, heart bursting with pride for Mom’s resilience. But she wasn’t there.   
  
A deep dread began bubbling like tar inside me. If Mom wasn’t producing the noise, who was? I had to pinpoint the source of that canorous tune. I began frantically turning the room upside-down in desperation. I tossed aside action figures and pillow pets, panic fueling my frenetic frenzy. I peeked under the bed, and I froze in shock. A pair of red radiating eyes glared back at me.   
  
Shadow shrouded the entity, its loathsome stare sending ice shooting through my veins. Dim light lined a perimeter that I presumed it could not cross. But the thing that nearly made my heart stop, that awful horrid image that I still can’t erase from my head, was the sight of my mother cradled in its grasp, slowly, methodically cranking the handle of the music box.   
  
She beamed at me, white teeth glimmering in the darkness. I melted into the floor like I was being forced down by invisible hands. Mom spoke, each demented letter joggling in my brain like a ping pong ball.   
  
“David, Johnny came home. He wants you to play with us.”  
  
That was all my mind could take. The scene before me was simply too much to process. Blackness bathed the perimeter of my vision, and I lost consciousness, glimpsing Mom’s nauseating grin one last time before I did.   
  
I awoke in my own bed nearly an hour later. Dad had found me crumpled on the carpet in Johnny’s room. Mom was declared a missing person the next morning. Neither her nor the music box have ever turned up. Dad thinks that she may have taken her own life. That the utter hopelessness weighing on her psyche had crushed her spirit. But I know what really happened. And I pray that whatever came for her that night doesn’t return to reunite us.
