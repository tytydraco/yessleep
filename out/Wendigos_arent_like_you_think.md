There’s a feeling you get when you’re out in a holler at night. Trees rising up around you like the great teeth of some ancient being. A feeling of hopelessness, loneliness at how small you are. But also, a fundamental sense that you are a part of it all. It’s overwhelming and in that moment you can feel God. It’s been years since I’ve got out in the woods again. I miss it. Ache for it. But I worry about what will happen if I go back out there. 



I’d heard tales of the witikow from Cree boys I’d go fishing with. Monster men who succumbed to the sin of gluttony and placed their own survival over that of the community. It was a spirit, they said, an old and evil spirit that crawled into men. It was the kind of scary story shared amongst young boys playing at being men. A chance to boast of how you’d slay such a beast; a lesson taught on how to avoid becoming one. 



It was in the winter of ’88-’89 that I encountered a witikow, or what most folk now call wendigo. I was camping with my brother Nate and our friend Takwakin. It was before the first snow and we had been amongst the trees for a week, living off of the land. We were each of us skilled enough at hunting, Nate and I eager to test out our new rifles. But game alone isn’t enough and so we foraged too. I don’t see colors right, so the foraging fell to Nate and Takwakin. 



So it was that I would check and gather the snares each morning while they broke camp, and each day we stopped I would set camp while they foraged. It was a carefree time whenever we went roaming in the woods. Not easy, but simple and without the complexities of society. We had each other for company and though there were times there was want of a woman, this was easily dealt with by a quick trip alone to the river. 



Nights were the domain of stories. We would sit out amongst the moon and stars and take turns telling the stories of our youth. Takwakin’s were my favourite, for I hadn’t heard their like before. Nate's were well old and familiar, bringing comfort in repetition. I had no craft at speaking. Felt like words got caught in my throat and tied my tongue up. They didn’t mock me, though, not like the other boys back in town. 



A full moon shone overhead on a perfect cloudless night and Takwakin drew our attention to it. “You know there’s a rabbit up there?” He asked, his breath frosting and the hints of a smile playing on his face. Nate and I laughed.



“No, I’m serious.” He said, still smiling. “There was a rabbit who wanted to go to the moon, so he asked all the birds in the land to take him. He asked the jay, but jay-bird said ‘I am too small to carry you’.



“So, he asked the goose, for it was larger than the jay and could support his weight, but the goose too said no. ‘It is too cold up so high’ the goose said ‘Already I fly from place to place to avoid such cold. I will not fly to that cold rock'.



“At this the poor rabbit had lost hope that he would ever touch the moon. But brother crane had heard the rabbit’s pleading. He was strong and not afraid of the cold. ‘I will take you.’ He said ‘but you must hold tight to me, for it is a long fall if you let go.’” And with that Takwakin sat back and closed his eyes. Nate kicked his foot.



“Out with it.” Nate said.



“What?” Takwakin asked, smile growing.



“O-out w-with the rest!” I said.



“Y'ain't ever told a story that didn’t have no ending.” Nate said. We were both leaning forward now, the fire between us crackling encouragement to our plight. Takwakin delighted in our hanging on his word. Telling tales is what he loved most. Said it was a way of keeping alive what we otherwise lost.



“Fine, fine, if that is not enough.” He relented. He sat up again and the light of the fire danced in his eyes. “The rabbit hopped onto brother crane’s feet and wrapped his paws as tightly around his legs as he could. So tight the scales dug into his soft skin. And the crane took flight. 



“It is a long way from here to the moon, and very cold and so the crane flew as fast as he could. So fast that poor rabbit nearly slipped and fell away, so he clutched tighter. But the ground didn’t want to part with the rabbit and greedily pulled him back down, but still the rabbit held on. So tight the crane's short legs got stretched and stretched. 



“Finally they made it to the moon and rabbit, breathless from the journey, patted crane's head in thanks. But, rabbit had held so tight his paws were bloody and it left a mark on crane’s head. And this is why all cranes today have long legs and red marks on their head. A gift from the moon rabbit.” And with that he pointed out dark patches on the moon that looked like a rabbit. I went to sleep that night with thoughts of the moon rabbit. 



I awoke to a soft noise in the woods, whispering on the verge of hearing. A fellow fur trapper, more than likely, about his business before first light. But there was a smell too. An awful smell. Like someone had ripped the guts from a wolf and left them to steam in the snow. Predator guts stink different. It’s subtle, but you come to notice it after a while. A wrongness there more than in other creatures. A warning, maybe. I drifted off with memories of helping pa skin a whole pack of wolves down by the creek and a voice that might have been my pa's telling me to come outside. 



I awoke again to bustling activity. Takwakin was burying the remains of the fire and bundling his gear and share of skins. 



“C'mon, we need to leave this place.” He said, as much to me as to Nate.



“W-what about the t-traps?” I asked.



“Leave them. We’re heading back.” Takwakin said. I looked at Nate but he just shrugged. So we got to work packing up. 



We’d been snaking a path along the north side of the river, long and wide. A journey that had taken us seven days but could see as home in as little as two. And Takwakin was setting a pace to see it done. The sun rose high in the sky, but its warmth never reached the ground and before it reached its apex we had lost it in a blanket of white that heralded the coming snows. 



Nate had kept his peace far longer than I’d expected before the silence wore on him too deep and he had to pry. 



“What’s the hurry, what did you see?” He said, moving up to match Takwakin’s step, leaving me to hurry behind. Fat flakes of snow spiralled to the ground like manna from heaven. I stopped and caught some on my tongue like I had when I was still a young boy. When I looked ahead, I saw I was quickly being left behind and doubled my pace to catch up. 



“You’re fooling.” Nate was saying. “It was probably a trader with a fresh kill.”



“No, it was witikow. A Kihtehayah has the hand of one; it still lives. Claws and scratches to escape its confines. As children we are brought to see it. That we might know the signs of the witikow: their sight, their smell. It was witikow.” 



Nate stopped, allowing me to catch up. Takwakin had always spoken jokingly of the witikow; we had never heard of this hand before. I thought of that smell from last night. The voice, half-heard in my dream. Takwakin finally stopped too.



“Come on! It tracks us even now. We need to get back. Our only hope is in community.” Takwakin said and started moving again. Nate and I rushed after him.



“If it’s following us, why can’t we smell it?” Nate asked.



“When you stalk deer, do you approach upwind that it might notice you?” We walked in silence after that. Snow came down faster, settling heavily on the forest floor. Flakes whipped by in the corner of my vision, conjuring images of the witikow darting between trees after us. Twigs cracked in the distance, snow crunched, and the wind hissed and howled. Normal sounds of nature I’d grown up with turned blood curdling by Takwakin’s words.



It was before nightfall that we started setting up camp. Takwakin said it was dangerous to move at night. We’d build a big fire, stay together and have a weapons loaded and to hand.



“The witikow is a coward.” He said. “Strong enough in body to tear through ten men, but weak in heart. It fears being outnumbered. It wants to draw us apart. So we stick together.”  



We only had Remingtons calibered at .22, bought earlier in the year because Nate and I had been taken in by the store clerk’s patter about what a great invention it was. Takwakin had an old Winchester yellow boy, which was a .44 at least. I wasn’t convinced any would be effective against a witikow. 



We were in a holler we’d camped at on the way out. The fire raged in the middle of the camp, burning as high and bright as we could manage. We’d made a stash of firewood here on our way out, anticipating snowfall. The snow had stopped but still blanketed everything, making the trees look even more like giant teeth and the fire a lapping tongue. 



Sleep did not come easily to any of us as we sat around the fire, cradling our rifles. Fear burned in my veins, but like the fire it could only burn so bright for so long. I drifted. 



A scream pierced the night and I jolted awake, gripping my gun tighter. The noise was high and soul shredding. The sound of imminent death and helplessness. My heart stopped in my chest as my eyes darted around for the source. I could see Nate and Takwakin doing likewise. Then the begging started.



“Nate!” The voice was so high and pained. Filled with fear and anguish. It took me a moment to realise I knew the voice. It was the voice of my mother. “Zeke! Help, oh sweet Jesus mercy!”



The sound of my name coming from my mother stirred my stomach and my bowels near gave out. I was frozen in terror. Mother was out in the woods with that thing. Nate, always the brave one, jumped to his feet and darted towards the screaming, but Takwakin tackled him.



“It’s not her.” He said, doing his best to keep Nate pinned. “The witikow takes voices.”



“How does it know what she sounds like?” Nate asked. Suddenly the fight went out of Takwakin and Nate was able to push him off. He pulled himself up and grabbed his gun from the drift it had fallen to.



“It already killed her.” Takwakin said. 



“Maybe.” Was all Nate said before he marched out into the darkness, rifle raised. We watched him disappear and did nothing. 



I don’t know how long we sat there, it could have been seconds, it could have been minutes before a shot rang out. The lightning crack was enough to set me off. I jumped to my feet.



“W-we have to go after him. S-stick together, y-yeah?” I said. Takwakin was still on his knees. He looked up at me and gave a slow nod. I helped him up and we walked shoulder to shoulder into the darkness after Nate. 



Each step was a shuffle forward, half-blind in the darkness but for the moonlight. The cold burned my hands and my trigger finger itched and shook in anticipation. 



“d-do you s-see anything?” I whispered. 



“I'm over here!” Nate shouted as if in response. It came from up ahead to our left. Then the explosion of a gun burst directly ahead of us. And another voice rang out.



“Liar!” This was also Nate's voice. Dead ahead. Takwakin and I both stopped. He gestured straight ahead; I nodded. We continued forward towards the source, guns now trained off to the left. 



A wet tearing sound suddenly filled the air and the smell of iron overran the decay. My brother howled like a dying dog and then another shot rang out and the witiko cried out in kind. A piercing sound, like an owl possessed by the devil. We rushed forward, dreading what we would find.



Nate lay against a tree, his body covered in the shining black of blood in moonlight. It poured freely from his chest and throat, steaming in the snow. I ran to him and held him tight. He was past saving and we all knew it. So, I hugged him and told him it was all OK and he’d be welcomed into the kingdom of heaven. I kept muttering to him even as his jerky breathing stopped and his body went limp against me. 



“Zeke, I’m sorry but he’s gone to his ancestors. We need to move.” Takwakin said, he was still scanning the trees for any signs of the witikow. “Zeke.”



I lay my brother down and my heart with him. I tried to wipe the tears from my eyes but only succeeded in getting blood on my face. Above me, the wind rustled a tree branch.



“Zeke move!” Takwakin cried and a shot rang out. A great weight dropped on me. Bones and sallow skin, reeking of death and far too heavy for what it was. The face was lolled by my side, so human and yet so inhuman, neck twisted at an impossible angle.



“Th-thanks.” I said, trying to pull myself out from under it. Takwakin pulled the lever on his rife, aimed and shot the thing again clean through the head.



“It’s not dead yet. We’ve got to melt its heart.” He said. He dropped his rifle and helped roll the beast off of me. As it rolled I felt a horrible pain spring from my stomach. I looked down to see blossoming black where my belly should be. The claws of one hand twitched wildly still, clasping and unclasping at a lump of flesh that used to be me. 



Between the sight and the pain it was too much. I threw up and felt my stomach rub against the ragged hole. 



“Think I’ll just lay here a while.” I said. “You go on ahead and burn the heart. I’ll catch you up.” Takwakin looked at me, at the wound, and nodded. He pulled a knife from his belt and cut the heart from the witikow, careful to stay clear of its twitching arms. He wrenched the heart out and it shone in the moonlight. 



“I’ll share your story.” Takwakin said. I nodded to him and he walked into the night. I knew when he’d burned the heart because the body spasmed violently and then was finally completely still. 



And in that stillness the shadow rose up.



It drifted like a black cloud from the witiko and hung over it. There were no eyes, no anything really, but it was watching me. I wish I could say that it overwhelmed me and claimed my body as its new home. That I could absolve myself of the guilt. Have my hands washed clean of sin. That is not how the demon works. 



It tugs at your mind, bringing some thoughts to sharp relief, while making others blur. I stared at the smoke of undeath and I realised I was not ready to die. That there was a way, a terrible way, I might yet survive. 



May the ever-merciful God redeem my soul, though I bare a greater sin than Cain. My teeth sank into my brother’s already torn throat and I drank his cooling blood like it was nectar. His flesh fell apart before my teeth like the finest steak and the shadow filled me. 



I ate of him until my stomach distended and still I was not sated. I tore the flesh from him by the handful and slid it down my gullet lost to all but the hunger. And then a smell caught my nose. The most mouth-watering smell. If this slab before me was leftovers from the icebox, then the smell was meat still on the pan, sizzling. 



Takwakin. There was such emotions battling on his face I do not know how one man may feel so much. Sadness, regret, hatred, betrayal, disgust. He battled to comprehend his mind and what he must do, but I was singular. There was only the hunger. 



My hands were on his throat in seconds, squeezing, squeezing. I think back on it now and hate myself for the unadulterated glee I had in that moment. And am overjoyed by the serendipity that followed. 



A rustle underfoot and the grey form of a rabbit bounded between the trees. I watched it in wonder, regaining a glimpse of myself. I released Takwakin, mercifully still alive. I tried to speak, but found I couldn’t. Strips that had once been my brother filled my oesophagus. 



Takwakin gasped for breath and looked at me. I can only imagine the conflict he felt then. I placed a bloody hand upon his head  and I ran into the woods. 







The change came on slowly. No matter how much I ate, or what I ate, I wasted away. Hunger clawed at me relentlessly and there was no respite in dreams for I could not sleep. The cold seeped into what remained of my skin until the fires of Hell couldn’t warm me. And as I ate, I grew. Limbs extending, stretching, cracking, breaking, healing. There was nought but pain and cold and hunger. 



I succumbed to it. I resisted for as long as I could, but the devil has an eternity with which to tempt. I ate of the flesh of men and still I was not sated. I was lost to the hunger, hidden by the cold. I wandered the woods for longer than I care to think. Until, one night I found myself once more in a holler. It wasn’t the one from my youth, but it awoke feelings that had long withered in me. I felt hopeless. I stared up at the full moon and saw in its shadows the rabbit, just as Takwakin had pointed out. I wept, icicles that carved at the flesh of my face and remembered that I was a man.



I found it easier to temper my hunger in crowds than around individuals. Some innate desire of the shadow to remain hidden? I do not know but I seized upon it. Where once I had secluded myself in the distant places, now I sheltered amidst concrete trees. There were still incidents, but they became more and more rare.  Each was confessed before God in the twilight hours at an empty church. 



Recent events have torn the veil from my eyes and exposed my hubris. I thought I had conquered the shadow  and could return to a semblance of normality. I decided it was time enough that I had a place of my own instead of wandering. I found an apartment. One so bathed in death that people stayed away from it and that is where I took up residence. There were six others on the ninth floor with me and 78 in total in the building. I knew the smell of each. Knew which order I would like to eat them in. The shadow pulled at my mind, bringing thoughts of how easy it would be to slip from room to room undetected. 





I fear I will not be able to resist the shadow if I remain and so I am moving on once more. But I felt the need to share this with you, with everyone. The witikow, wendigo, isn’t what you think. It is a shadow waiting to claim the heart of any foolish enough to accept it. And at least one of us only seeks to live a peaceful life.
