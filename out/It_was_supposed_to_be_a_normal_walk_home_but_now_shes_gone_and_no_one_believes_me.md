I should’ve known something was wrong the moment we stepped into the trees.

Emily and I had taken this shortcut a hundred times before. We knew the path well—how the dirt turned to gravel near the old oak, how the air always smelled like damp leaves, how the distant hum of the highway never quite faded.

But that night, everything was different.

The air was thick and heavy, pressing down on my chest like a weight. The trees loomed taller, their gnarled branches curling like skeletal hands. And the path—God, the path—looked darker, as if the earth itself had been charred.

“We didn’t take a wrong turn, did we?” Emily asked. Her voice was soft, but I could hear the edge of unease.

“No,” I said, but I wasn’t sure.

The forest felt different. The usual sounds—crickets, rustling leaves, the occasional hoot of an owl—were gone. Silence swallowed everything.

And then came the whispers.

At first, they were so soft I thought I was imagining them, just the wind through the trees. But then they grew clearer, curling around us like fingers.

"Stay."

"Stay with us."

I froze. My skin prickled. Emily grabbed my arm.

“Did you hear that?” she whispered.

I nodded. My throat was too dry to speak.

A shadow moved in the corner of my eye. Not an animal, not a person—something else. It was tall and thin, its limbs too long, its body shifting between the trees like smoke.

Emily’s fingers tightened around my wrist. “Megan, run!”

We took off.

Branches lashed against my arms. My breath came in ragged gasps. The trees around us twisted as we ran, their trunks bending unnaturally, shifting when I wasn’t looking. The path ahead stretched forever, winding where it had never wound before.

I risked a glance over my shoulder.

The shadows were closer.

The whispers had changed. No longer soft. No longer distant. They were laughing now—low, rasping, hungry.

Then Emily screamed.

I skidded to a stop and turned just in time to see her hit the ground. Something had wrapped around her ankle. A root? No. Not a root. It was alive—black, slick, writhing. It pulsed as it dragged her backward, toward a massive, rotting tree with a hollow mouth gaping open at its base.

“Megan! Help me!”

I dropped to my knees, grabbing her arms, pulling with everything I had. My nails dug into her skin.

But the forest wasn’t letting go.

The tendrils tightened, winding up her legs, wrapping around her waist. The ground beneath her was shifting—opening—as if the earth itself wanted to swallow her whole.

The whispers grew deafening.

"One must stay."

Emily’s eyes locked onto mine, wide and terrified. “Megan,” she gasped. “Go.”

I shook my head frantically, tears burning down my face. “No—”

"One must stay."

Her fingers slipped from mine.

And she was gone.

The ground sealed shut as if nothing had happened. The trees straightened. The path reappeared. The forest was quiet again.

I stumbled back, my mind screaming that this wasn’t real, that this couldn’t be happening. But the weight in my chest told me the truth.

Emily was gone.

The forest had taken her.

And as I turned and ran, sprinting toward the edge of the woods, I swore I could still hear it whispering—soft, beckoning, patient.

"Stay with us."

Emily’s funeral is tomorrow.

They said she was attacked by a bear. That they found what was left of her deep in the woods, torn apart.

But that’s a lie.

There was no bear. I know what I saw.

I tried to tell them, but no one believes me. My mom says I’m in shock. The police won’t even look at me when I talk about the whispers.

But I know the truth.

The forest took her.

And I don’t think it’s finished it wants me.
