To describe the setting, I was at my Grandmothers house in a very densely populated suburb. My grandmother is in tune with her spiritual body. She works with chakras and a whole bunch of other weird shit. In simple terms, she's a spiritual healer. 

This incident took place in April of 2020, which just so happened to be the Islamic month of Ramadhaan. The month in which Muslims fast from sunrise till sunset. 

I crawled into bed on a Tuesday night as usual.
At around midnight I got hungry so I made my way downstairs to the kitchen. Upon reaching the kitchen I hear two cats fighting outside.
My grandmother lives in a gated complex and she is the only one there who owns a cat. 
Out of curiosity, I open the door that leads from the kitchen to the backard. As soon as I opened it, something ran across. From the right to the left. It moved so elegantly, almost as if it floated through time. 
The sound of claws scraping on the floor echoes around the other side of the house. 
It galloped, not as a horse, but rather a small monkey.

The only way I could describe it is it looked and felt dark. It lefts streaks of black matter as it ran. A dark and twisted aura surrounded it. Unable to define its features I could only see something I'd describe as a black entity of nothingness. Grabbing a broom that was against the wall, I chased it as soon as it initially ran past the door.
I cut the corner half a second after it did and It was no where to be seen. Vanished into thin air.
Keep in mind, this is still Tuesday night.
Losing my appetite I go back to sleep.

In Ramadhaan, Muslims are encouraged to wake up early before sunrise to have breakfast before the fast begins. One can only eat up until sunrise, and not beyond, until sunset.

Wednesday morning I awake at 8. Missing all my alarms I set so that I could have my early breakfast before sunrise. I check with everybody else after they wake up and they had the same issue.

I relayed the story about the cats that were fighting to my Grandmother, but she assured me that her cat was in her bed last night.
That when my stomach dropped
After describing the features of what I had seen the previous night to her, she told me she knows exactly what I'm talking about. 
It was a Demon or just the Devil, also  known as Shaytaan is Islam.  She has had multiple ecnounters with them, and my description matched what she too had seen.

This hasn't haunted me but has been a story I've wanted to share on this sub reddit for a while

I try to explain what I saw that night to people but nobody can seem to relate or back it up.



Willing to listen to anyone who has any info <3
