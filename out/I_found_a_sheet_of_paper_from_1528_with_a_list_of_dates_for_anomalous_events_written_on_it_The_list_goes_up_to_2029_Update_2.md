[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/135xsid/i_found_a_sheet_of_paper_from_1528_with_a_list_of/)


It's time to dive back into the sheet of paper that predicted this. The paper with the dates and names. Why was it hidden underneath my floor? Why did I have to be subject to one of the many events it hinted at? And why was I the main victim? I'm definitely the victim of a mad group, or cult, but what exactly points to me being the main victim?


Also, I still needed to translate the first two pages as well.


My other self and I, standing by the security station, watched as the four gun-wielding cultists walked through the living room. I looked around for anything that could be of use, but unfortunately, nothing in the room would be enough to ward off the intruders.


I was relieved when four police officers stepped in with their guns drawn. They stood in one spot for about a minute before opening fire, but all fell in the span of a second. My heart sank watching them fall, and seeing their blood pile up on the carpet.


The keypad glitched out, then, three seconds later, the handle turned. I froze.


"Don't worry," I said to my other self, shaking. "I'll just ask them what they want."


The door swung open. The four gunmen stood right outside. Three of them aiming right at us. I rested my hands on my hips, hoping this would end in good spirits.


"Please step out of the room," said a woman on the far left. "We want to do this peacefully. Come with us."


"What do you want from us specifically?" I asked in a shaky tone.


"It's best we tell you in a safe place," said the woman.


"Well, this is a safe room," I said.


"A place alternate versions of ourselves wouldn't be able to break into," said the woman.


"If you want to do this peacefully, why are you aiming guns right at us?" I asked.


"Being scary is how we persuade," said the woman. "If you aren't fearing for your life, you won't do what we say."


These people were downright creepy. I felt the need to keep talking so I could ease the tension within me.


"Can you explain the sph-phere that popped up in the library?" I asked, shaking.


"It's a rope between worlds," she said.


"I mean, what is it made of?" I asked.


"That's none of your business," she said.


There it was. Not knowing something filling me with dread.


"Please just tell me," I asked.


"No," the gunmen said in unison.


Four police officers hurried down the stairs into the basement and told the four gunmen to drop their weapons. One of the men told the officers the BS about being peaceful, then the officers opened fire at them. A red mist flew out of the heads of two of the gunmen. The two who survived, one of the men and one of the women, shot at the officers, sending them all to the floor.


"Why aren't there guns in here?" asked my other self.


"What?" I asked. "We don't need guns."


"Come on," said my other self. "You know we do. I know you know we do."


She was right. I wanted this to end peacefully, but self defense was integral.


The two remaining gunmen turned to us.


"Don't you want to get out of town?" asked the woman. "Away from all the creatures?"


They were trying to persuade me. I was consumed by dread. I didn't know what to even do. Backup had to arrive at some point, and maybe they could take out the remaining gunmen who were still adamant about taking me to someplace?


"Where do you want to take us?" asked my other self.


"We'll show you," said the male gunman.


"Not enough," I said. "Just tell me where you want to take us."


I began to hear more sirens. They blared louder and louder as the seconds passed. The two gunmen exchanged looks, then they put their rifles on their backs. For a couple seconds, I was both relieved and confused. I got my answer when they each pulled out a small handgun or taser. They pulled the triggers, sending an electric shock through my body. I fell to the ground.


The gunmen dragged us across the cold basement floor, over the bodies that reeked an atrocious smell, and up the stairs. As the sound of marching boots rushed in, the gunmen dropped us on the stairs, reached for their rifles, and opened fire down the hallway. I was left on my stomach, so I had a good view. They put gas masks on as smoke filled the doorway. I couldn't move my hands, so I coughed like hell as the smoke entered my lungs. My eyes watered up as well, so I couldn't see what was happening anymore.


Luckily, I could move my fingers again, then, within seconds, my hands, feet, arms, legs… and once I could move every part of my body, I lifted myself up. My eyes and throat were still stinging, so I crawled down the steps until it calmed. I noticed my other self was crawling down with me. I won't forget how red her face was.


The gunfight was still going by the sound of it, so I rested my head on the steps and waited it out. The gunshots rang out for another minute before everything went silent.


My other self and I reached into each of the pockets of the cultists. The men had phones, wallets, and folded papers. The women only had folded papers. We read each of the papers, only to find out they each read the same thing.


"Your truth doesn't exist. Only Nnotz's truth."


Nnotz? Who or what is that? Why is it spelled that way?


We climbed up the stairs, then, cautiously, I peeked around the corner. Another one of the gunmen was laying on the ground on the other end of the hallway with four holes in his upper back. Some officers were laying further away. My heart sank.


As I looked at the horrible sight, I noticed a sheet of paper lying in between one of the officer's bodies and a door to what I guessed was a closet. Assuming it was the page Greyson was holding up, I told other me I was going to go fetch it. She asked me what I'd do if one of the gunmen was right around a corner. My heart sank at that possibility, so I grabbed one of the officers' guns, stepped over the three bodies, and plugged my nose to keep out the atrocious smell.


Once I made it to the other side of the hallway, I bent down, jolted my head as I swore I thought I saw something moving in the corner of my eye, picked the sheet up, then tip-toed back to the basement door, where I read what was on the paper. It was a bunch of random symbols. There was no way I was going to understand any of it. My other self told me she too was confused about it. I slid the note into my pocket.


I thought we were in the clear until my other self opened the front door. There was a blurred covering on the other side, blocking the exit. I reached out to touch it. It was hard plastic, fused with the door frame and the floor. We tried pushing it, punching it, cutting it, but nothing worked. We checked the other doors and the windows for a safe exit, but the same hard plastic covered those exits too.


My heart sank. We were trapped inside. My other self called the police, then she told me the police said they were currently outside, trying, but failing, to get in.


Great. Why? I didn't ask for this. And that smell was getting bad…


Once we found something to cover our noses with, I told my other self about the pages I found underneath my floorboards. She had a look of disappointment on her face as she responded by telling me she wishes she could read them. I assured her, telling her I took pictures of them. All I needed to do was translate the first page for now, then the second one after we're done processing the first.


I looked up an image-text to text converter. Once I found one, I used it to convert the Old English writing on the first page to regular text, then I put it through an online translator. This is what it read:


"If you're reading this, it's because I'm stuck in the past. I'm from an alternate reality in which I worked with an organization who tracked anomalies across North America. They were called Erradalie, a powerful organization established in 2025 that was widely regarded with respect across the world. In the 10 years proceeding the organization's creation, the rate of anomaly-type events across North America went down by 70%. Similar organizations were set up in other parts of the world, operating on different continents. 10 years after their creation, anomalies-type events went down by 80% worldwide.


Creepy creatures were becoming a thing of the past. Governments guarded slips to different realities like they were atomic bombs. They were far worse than that though, I promise.


In 2050, the US, China, UK, and South Africa all released reports about the most dangerous alternate realities. The HETR report. You won't believe the stuff described in those documents. A reality where a laser that turned entire planets into hellholes had hit Earth. A reality in which the second you enter, you get torn to shreds by the wind. Realities featuring invasions of all different kinds… and militaries did their best to keep the monstrosities from those places away from our reality.


All was good until a psychopath showed up and destroyed everything we had. Her name was Arilyn Campbell. In 2056, she arrived and assassinated every head, every guard, and fried every server. Apparently that wasn't enough, because she then stole our technology. In the span of 10 days after her rain of crime, killer creatures had poured out of every slip in the world to the extent anomalies went up by 50%.


We chased after her. We actually managed to find her in a reality where a giant jellyfish-like creature was floating above the Arctic Circle. From what I heard, that is. My team got eaten by a chilling creature I cannot begin to explain, but I kept going, running from all the other scary stuff that inhabited that reality, including people in grey robes who kept talking about this god-like thing called Notes. Possible spelling error there, as I'm going off of pronunciation. I called it weird, so they sent three-eyed humanoids after me. I hadn't run so fast in my life.


We made it to a town named Bradford, in Ontario, Canada. I found Arilyn sitting on her porch. When she saw me, she looked back at her phone with a bored expression on her face. I took out my badge and held it up for her to notice. She looked up from her phone, eyed the badge, then got up from her chair and walked over to me.


I told her exactly where I was from and told her I wasn't going to take any excuses for her behavior. She reminded me of Black Widow a little bit. She had a mostly-deadpan vocal tone and, based on security footage from back at HQ, was quite stealthy. But she was a terrible person. She tased me, took my wallet, and tore up all of its contents right in front of me. She told me I wasn't going to be needing any of it where I was going.


Ari sent me to a reality where everything was seemingly fine, but then she sent me back in time to that reality's past. When I found out what era I was in, all I could mutter was "fuck you." Dirt roads, horses, stone buildings out of the mid-second Millenium… I was nervous, but my worst fear was realized when I saw the date. April 2, 1520… She sent me to a time period over 500 years into the past.


I didn't blend in at all for the first few years. I couldn't understand old English, my shirt had a 21st Century logo, my general style looked nothing like the style everyone else was wearing. Luckily, I managed to impress people through artistic works, so I didn't stay homeless for long. No, I'm not actually Leonardo Davinci, and, unfortunately, I never ended up becoming famous for my work. But hey, at least I enjoyed it. Of course, aside from those times where I painted just to settle my dread. Lots of dread over many different things. One thing I haven't mentioned was failing and not making enough money to live, then getting stalked by some serial killer because of the vulnerability I would have.


I was glad I got to make enough money to get a house at all, otherwise I'd have to steal… and getting caught would mean being put in jail. I was not curious about the condition of 1500s-era jails.


I hid my phone from everybody in fear I'd be seen as some otherworldly being. Once my battery died, that was it for me using the notes app. I still keep it with me though. Afterall, it's my phone.


Some of the words and names I'm writing don't exist in this time period. I wrote about the US above. What the hell is that in 1528? It doesn't exist yet! I'm praying somebody comes to rescue me. I'm in my 40s. If I don't catch the BUBONIC PLAGUE, I should live to see at least the 1580s. Hooray? That is unless I'm missing some facts. I never looked into biology and medicine all that much. I'm still scared shitless of catching a disease. I've probably used too much soap by now.


Living in the 1500s is terrifying for a time traveler with no way home whatsoever.


If you're reading this and you have the tech necessary, travel back in time to June 17, 1528, two days after I'm writing this, and meet me at (address, London, England.) We can fight Arilyn and her cronies in her home reality.


Here's some proof. Here are the dates of every major anomalous event that took place from 1528 through 2028, with an important extra entry from 2029. Written beside each are the names of relevant people and places.


June 15, 1528"


This was chilling to read. Imagine being sent back to the 1500s with absolutely nothing to do about it. No home or job either. Everyone you know is far from being born. Is Arilyn the head of the wild cult hunting me down? Is she the reason I'm trapped in this house? Chills ran down my spine as I thought, what if she comes here? And the reality with the creature over the Arctic Circle… is that one of the realities being brought closer to ours?


Notes is Nnotz?


I don't know, maybe it's a coincidence. That's just hope though. I also hope I don't starve to death in this house after all the food runs out.


No. They want me for some reason. They very likely have back up. If it turns out they do, hopefully they'll lose and fail to make it to where I am. I'm currently hiding somewhere with my other self in case that happens. I'm not going to follow their cult. They brought a dark squirmy sphere here I got a sinking feeling thinking about just now, and they might be worshiping a giant jellyfish-like creature they want to bring closer to here? I just can't anymore. I'm cold. I hope the cultists don't find us.


It's weird how that was the first page, but it read like it should've been the second. At least, the bit at the end. Unfortunately, I don't have time to translate the second page to see what's up, as there's a banging coming from downstairs now.
