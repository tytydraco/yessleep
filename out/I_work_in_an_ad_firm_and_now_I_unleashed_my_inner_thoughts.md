I work in visual communications at a small company that’s aggressively expanding its footprint throughout the High Desert.


Stripped down to the bones, we’re no more than an ad firm. Up until the late 2000s, the High Desert was just a place you passed through. Before it burned down, the Summit Inn was the only place worth stopping, an oasis of burgers and shakes for sore eyed travelers climbing the Cajon Pass, heading to Barstow and Vegas.


One day, as I was finishing an ostrich burger, yes, an ostrich burger, I looked out the window of the restaurant and realized there was so much potential out here.


A modern day frontier.


There’s an air base a few miles down the road.
Another in the opposite direction used by U.S. Customs.


A couple of local burger joints.

A family pizza arcade.

A small mall.

I could really make a killing with the right marketing plan.


My biggest idea?


Using what some locals call the Morphic Field.
The Morphic Field was an idea cooked up in the 1980s. In short, it means no idea is truly original. Once one person comes up with something, that thought becomes accessible to everyone. That’s why you see pyramids in completely different regions of the world.


At least, that’s what the eggheads say.


Most folks in Hesperia blame the heat, the dust, or a bad batch of desert meth for the weird stuff that goes down.


But the truth is, this town’s got a demon problem.
Not the flashy hellfire types with horns and pitchforks. These guys are whisperers, freelancers in the Morphic Field Network. A kind of demonic Wi Fi that spreads ideas like a rash at a clown convention.


According to the woo woo types, the Morphic Field is where thoughts hang out and wait to be picked up by open minds. They say it’s about cosmic connection and spiritual synchronicity.


Bullshit.


It’s demon Yelp.


You think you came up with that brilliant idea for a taco truck that only serves bacon wrapped pickles?


Nah.


That was Frathonthoon.


Frathonthoon is a local desert demon.


About the size of a large possum.


Smells like burnt hair and Drakkar Noir.
Has a voice like someone gargling battery acid.


He latched onto me after I accidentally channeled him during a late night ritual, fueled by 5 Hour Energy and Rockstar, in my cousin’s garage. I was trying to manifest a promotion at work.
I got Frathonthoon instead.


I thought if I paid one of the local weirdos, they could teach me how to access the Morphic Field. But instead of tapping into some mystic collective consciousness, I became obsessed with the chaos they called magic.


I was convinced it could give me a professional edge.


Like Parker taking snapshots of Spider Dude for the paper.


Weeks passed. Frathonthoon didn’t say anything. Didn’t blink. Just stared.


But once I started noticing him, I saw others.
Certain shops had their own demons camped out front, chain smoking, eating bugs like popcorn, or in one case, screaming at a mango on Bear Valley Road.


I started talking to the shops that didn’t have a demon posted out front.


That’s how I built the foundation of my High Desert advertising empire.


I even pitched a slogan to Hesperia City Hall:
“Stay local. Shop Hesperia.”


So simple.


So effective.


One night, as I was fueling up at the Circle K on Main, Frathonthoon finally spoke.


“You know the Morphic Field is just us, right?” he said, his voice like sandpaper soaked in battery acid.


“You humans defecate out ideas, and if it tickles one of us the right way, we upload it to the Field. Then other demons download it and whisper it into other skulls.”


I blinked.


“So all those people who think they’re inventing the same thing at the same time…”


“Getting demon blasted, yeah.”


Apparently, demons work like shitty influencers. If an idea gets traction, avocado toast, crypto scams, spiritual essential oils for pets, it levels up the demon who spread it. The more humans latch on, the more power that demon gets.


It’s MLM meets Constantine.


In Hesperia, where dreams go to die next to broken Jet Skis and sun bleached trampolines, the Morphic Field is especially strong. Too many lonely, bored brains ripe for infestation.


One dude on Topaz tried to open a gun themed vegan bakery.


Another guy on Cottonwood invented a tire shop just for people who’ve seen UFOs.


Both ideas tanked.


Their demons got promoted.


Frathonthoon was desperate for a win.


“We need something viral,” he hissed.
“Something tasty.”


So I gave him an idea I’d been chewing on for a while.


“What if we started a conspiracy theory that pigeons are actually demon surveillance drones, and Hesperia is the testing ground?”


He paused, then grinned, his gums full of twitching centipedes.


“Uploading now.”


Three days later, some guy in Apple Valley made a vlog about it.


Then a lady in Hesperia started a pigeon awareness group and patrolled Ranchero Road with a butterfly net.


Within a week, it hit national news.


Hashtags.


Memes.


QAnon crossover.


Total chaos.


Frathonthoon bulked up like a gym rat on protein shakes. Grew wings. Started wearing leather pants. Said he got a corner office downstairs.
A week later, he vanished.


Business was booming.


My firm opened a Hesperia branch off Main, on a lettered street over the bridge, not one of the numbered ones.


I thought I was done with Frathonthoon.


I wasn’t.


One of my old doodles, a flaming hot dog with legs and sunglasses, became the mascot for a crypto funded NFT line called DemonDogz.
The whole thing went viral in Ireland.


I rushed home and redid the summoning ritual. It took longer this time. I chanted the same esoteric phrases, lit the same candles.


Nothing happened.


Then a gust of wind.


The power went out.


Only light was the moon.


Great. Power outage.


I lit a candle.


That’s when I saw him, sitting at my kitchen table, sipping my tea.


“You’ve been sharing my old notebooks!?” I shouted.


He looked sheepish.


“I may have synced your brain to the main server. You’re a content fountain, baby.”


“You made a contract with me. Your thoughts are mine now, kid.”


Now every weird dream I have gets turned into a Buzzfeed article or a novelty product on Amazon.
I can’t stop it.


They’ve got me on auto post.


Every time a crackpot idea goes mainstream, moon water enemas, AI powered ghost hunters, meatless carnivore diets, I hear Frathonthoon laughing from the shadows.


So yeah.


The Morphic Field?


Just Hell’s group chat.


And Hesperia?


We’re the goddamn beta testers.


Before he poofed away, he grinned at me one last time.


“Hey kid, keep it up. All your messed up ideas? They earned me a new name. Bye!”


“Wait! New name?”


He flipped me off and walked straight into the mirror.


It’s been months since I’ve seen Frathonthoon, or whatever he goes by now. I feel uneasy knowing all my thoughts are being broadcast to demons, and those same demons are sharing them with other people.


If I’m being honest with myself, though, all the extra cash flow has been nice. I’ve gotten ad contracts with Apple Valley and Victorville now.
What’s strange is, last week I got an email from an investment group called Kual Liun Financials. Said I was owed money for my inspiration on, can you fucking believe it,


Paranormal AM FM Radio Booster
Looks like a classic 90s antenna booster, but randomly splices in Hell’s hold music or arguments between minor demons about bagel flavors.


Sold exclusively at a 24 hour smoke shop on Bear Valley.


At least I’m getting kickbacks for my ideas.
I swear I’m so close to wearing a tinfoil hat to see if that actually works. Knowing how the Morphic Field works now, I bet it just amplifies the thoughts.


I’m losing sleep trying to keep my thoughts to myself.


I swear I’m starting to see ads in my dreams, like a think tank is using me as a live test audience.
I shudder at the words Frathonthoon told me at the table.


“Your thoughts are mine.”


What does he mean by that? To what extent do my thoughts become his? What does he do with them? And what is his name now?


I can’t truly summon him without his actual name. At least that’s what Bong Water Bill told me.


His name isn’t actually Bill.


I don’t know his name. He never gave it to me. Said names have power and nobody will have power over him again.


If you ask me, the bong has a shit ton of power over him.


Every time I visit his shop, the guy reeks of indoor grown bud. The only thing that keeps the law out is his demon screaming at the mango outside.
Such an odd sight.


So odd, regular people are affected by it. Once they walk in, they forget why they’re there, take a look at all the oddities in the shop, and leave.


No one ever buys anything.


Well. Anything physical.


Bill deals in information. Whatever he doesn’t know, he’ll go and find out for you, while jacking up the price.


He’s been very helpful getting my empire off the ground. He doesn’t even charge me for information. Says he enjoys all the new business I keep bringing into the desert.


To any normal person eavesdropping, they might think we’re talking about my ad firm.


What Bill is referring to is all the ideas I flood the Morphic Network with.


He’s the only one brave enough, crazy enough, or plain stupid to admit that he knows it’s my ideas causing all the chaos in the world.


A new trend comes out every two weeks basically.


And it never truly phases out the old trend. It’s different enough to supplement the previous one.
Almost like demonic DLC patches.


The bell above the door didn’t ring so much as wheeze.


I stepped into the haze of incense, burnt plastic, and whatever strain of indoor Bill was testing that day.


Bill sat behind the glass counter, barefoot, wearing a faded Baja hoodie and aviators.
At his feet, a goat with no eyes chewed on a bootleg Blu ray copy of Angels & Demons 2: Vatican Drift.


“Back again, Thoughtcaster,” he said, exhaling a long cloud shaped suspiciously like a middle finger.


I winced.


“Don’t call me that.”


“Too late. You’re a node now. An antenna for the Sublimed Noise.”


He leaned forward. “You’re trending, my dude.”
I leaned on the counter.


“I need to talk about Frathonthoon.”


He smiled, teeth like broken corn kernels.
“He finally leveled up?”


“Disappeared. Left me on auto post.”


“Classic Field behavior. Once they ascend, they outsource everything to the hive.”


Bill reached under the counter and pulled out a thick, leather bound notebook covered in duct tape and faded Lisa Frank stickers.


“You want to find him, you need a True Name.”
“I know. That’s why I’m here.”


He flipped through the book.


“Let me guess… Dreambaiting. Audio looping. Mugwort tea?”


I nodded.


“I even tried streaming my nightmares on Twitch."


Bill whistled. “Bold.”


“I don’t want him back. I want control.”


He paused, then looked at me over his glasses.
“There’s no control in the Field. Only current. You either ride it, or it drowns you in psychic pyramid schemes and scented soap startups.”


“I’m losing sleep, Bill. I can’t tell what’s mine anymore.”


He nodded solemnly.


“Yeah. That happens when you’re branded.”


“Branded?”


“You made a deal. You didn’t read the fine print.”
“There wasn’t fine print.”


He held up a finger.


“Exactly.”


The goat bleated.


“Look,” Bill said, suddenly serious.


“There’s a ritual I can show you. Not summoning, this is more like… pinging the Network. Like leaving a voicemail in Hell’s suggestion box.”


I raised an eyebrow.


“What do I need?”


He smiled.


“Just three things. A half charged vape, a screenshot of your worst tweet, and something you regret selling on Marketplace.”


I stared at him.


“And fifty bucks,” he added.


“Rituals ain’t free, baby.”


I slid him a crumpled bill from my pocket.


“This better not be another TikTok spell.”


“No,” he said, lighting a joint with a candle made of black wax and what smelled like bad decisions.


“This one’s strictly analog.”
