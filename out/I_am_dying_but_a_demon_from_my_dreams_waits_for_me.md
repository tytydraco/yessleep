I am writing this to explain to whoever finds my body that what I did, what I have done, was all because I had no other choice. The thing haunts me still, and death appears to be the only escape. The mind and its unique properties continues to perplex and pose questions asked by many. However, there are certain influences, entities that the human psyche shall not bear to comprehend, that threatens the weak and malleable mind. The safety of ignorance appears tolerable as opposed to the horror of the truth. What that truth may be, I hope to never fully know. But I am distraught at the fact that I caught a glimpse of it, and I fear that I may never unsee that unfathomable truth; that of which now leaves me restless. Fortunate for me that I will not be alive to endure any more...

The highlands that loom ominously over the west, are contrasted only by the endless blue abyss from the east. There lay densely packed regions of bushland and forest that co-exists with both modern and antiquated buildings. I myself live in a house passed down from generation to generation, which still stands after over a century on the decaying, red earth. These old walls hold within them timeless secrets and ancient whispers that come only after the sun sleeps beneath the mountains. I am now the last of my kind, with no children to inherit this place. Though I once regarded this a curse, I now find it a blessing, as I alone will pass and take these unknowable horrors with me as I die in these hallowed halls.

I alone foolishly walked home late one night; I remember the air was cool and whistled through the leafless branches above. The new moon hung low in the sky as silence strangled the leaf-speckled roads and buzzing streetlamps. A solemn stream stirred quietly beneath me as I crossed an aging timber bridge that groaned amidst the deep-rooted trees. This place has seen little change in the near two centuries since it was raised from calloused hands, and evokes the fleeting sense of familiarity to a time long since passed. It was there in the dead of night that I saw something amidst the grass on the other side. It was large, stone-like, as if a sculpture of some abstract, abominable artwork. It was only then, when the thing rose tall; rivalling the trees that stood stoically alongside it that it proved itself to possess life. I remember standing still,  my eyes gored by the menacing presence. I was paralysed, shivering and trembling while fixated on the eyes… those damnable eyes… bright, bestial and bewitching.

It lumbered into the dense trees, lurking in the woods as I began to quickly run back to my abode. I cared not of the loose possessions that slipped from my pockets, littering the neighbouring lawns. Nor the pain I felt in my decaying body as I got back home and locked the doors. I had seen something that I knew was not privy to, that figure pierced my mind, bringing with it suppressed memories of an experience I had from months prior, amidst the moss laden alleys of the main street, the damp walls of the towering buildings coated in graffiti. It was there that I met an estranged and excommunicated family member named Edmond Pierce, who was now a homeless man that slumbered and shuffled aimlessly outside a tall, abandoned building. I met him previously as he begged for change along the streets, his limbs weakened from years of exposure and his dated suit tattered and teared. He would bestow upon me his gratitude from stained teeth whenever I spared him loose change from my pockets. I knew that his struggle was genuine, despite what locals commented. He did not smoke or drink, nor went anywhere else after he ate, except the lingering remains of the derelict unit that he refused to stay in.

I remember distinctly it was a late afternoon on a rainy weekend when I asked him…

“Why do you not stay in that vacant building?”

His eyes would flash with something that could not be easily conveyed through human tongue. His consciousness and speech wandered aimlessly as he motioned me to follow him to the alley, which lay in ruin due to isolation. To say I was hesitant was an understatement. Despite our acquaintance, I did not fully trust him. I gave in to morbid curiosity, as the faint skittering of rats could be heard from beyond the rotting, boarded doors. He sat me by a stack of faintly weathered newspapers utilised as a makeshift stool, It was there and then that he recounted to me his story as rain hit the weathered roof above us, and why he dared not enter that abode, for he knows there remains nothing for him in there now.

It was with the knowledge he granted to me that caused confusion and bewilderment in me, as what he spoke about could only be compared to the ramblings of a mad man. But I knew Edmond too well, and I knew that he rarely joked. He carried with him a slick of hopelessness and despair, as though all the youthfulness and bliss was extracted from his very being.

“You wish to know of my tragedy, boy…?” he uttered. “Of how I became this? How it all went wrong? I’ll tell you, only because it doesn’t matter now… we’re all dead men walking anyway!”

I should have left; I should have ran, I should have done something. But my prying nature got the best of me. I sat on the damp stack as he detailed an eerie, fevered dream that he encountered years ago. He spoke extensively about the medication that failed him in his pursuit of normalcy amidst an onslaught of maledictions. It had started when he contracted a terrible illness. An illness that could still be seen bubbling from his skin in a grotesque manner. He stated that his body was debilitated and weakened, while his mind strode through cascading dreams that echoed night after night from his medication. One night in particular, lying dormant in his divan, after ingesting sleeping pills to remedy the worsening pain did these dreams drew forth a macabre and unsettling absurdity

“I would find myself in a peculiar labyrinthian warren… flooded with this… reflective liquid that did not follow the logic of reality. Makes sense since it’s a dream right? But I swear I could actually feel it!” He muttered, “It would shift and distort the surrounding walls and falling darkness, and after wading through them, I saw it…” His breathing became laboured and fearful as I pressed him for more.

“What did you see…?” I asked cautiously. To which he coughed and gagged, spitting into a nearby drain before continuing.

“A night terror, a lumbering beast, dark, depraved…” He stopped, and cowered with his face covered in his dirtied, bandaged hands. His reaction seemed excessive to me at the time.

“I don’t understand, how did it ruin your life?” I asked. To which he snapped at me.

“Because it followed me! It followed me outside of the dream! Now it prowls in that building, I’ve managed to trap it there by some miracle. It is bound to me, bound to our family!…” I wished to hear no more of the matter, It was now I undoubtedly understood why he was casted out from my bloodline. The man was clearly mentally unwell and couldn’t take care of himself. That was what I told myself, though now I realise how right he truly was. I paid him no mind after that strange visit, that was until I heard of his passing not long after.

Exposure to the elements and his debilitating disease got the best of him, in the end. They found him outside the building that he refused to dwell in, his body lying in front of a once boarded up door that was now open. I was told that it was likely adolescents that carelessly pushed his body away from the entrance to explore it’s dilapidated remains. They were wrong however, as I began to witness the same horrors he had when an all too similar illness stifled me, and brought my life to a halt.

I was faced with the threat of death, her presence ever looming as each day slipped through my thinning fingers like sand in an hourglass. I sought out many doctors, all of whom relayed to me the same morbid message. I, the last of my kind was dying, and I had not long left in this world. Illness was a blight upon our bloodline, it had taken my mother by her bosom, my father by his lungs, my grandfather by his heart and my grandmother by her brain. On and on this had gone on for, until our names were a most common sight in the old cemetery up north. Most recently, it had taken my estranged uncle by his skin, and now it was I who was next of death’s list.

Work relinquished me from my duties to spend my last days at home ‘with family’. A rather cruel though unintentional joke, as I spent the rest of my days wallowing alone in this antiquated house, on the barren outskirts of a cold coastal town. It stands tall, albeit crooked, as white paint yellowed with age peels off the dark brick hidden below. The greying floorboards creek loudly in the dark, often windowless rooms. Many of which remain empty, or in disrepair, almost frozen in time as my father’s tools still sits in the rooms he planned to refurbish during the last of his days.

I laid in my bed, my head throbbing with pain as I swallowed numerous pills. I was stuck in a state between consciousness and inexplainable, restless slumber. Hours passed by what seemed like seconds every time I closed my eyes. When it started, I do not know, but I found myself in a dark tunnel. Formed with huge, stone bricks that brought with them the imagery of great European castles of old. There was a dim, blue hue that accompanied me inside, despite the fact the tunnels were completely enclosed. As I walked, I felt dizzy as though my being was split in two, my body slow and lumbering behind as my mind quickly moved ahead.  This outer-body experience made my surroundings curl and fold in revolting patterns.

It was then I had a terrifying realisation, as I recalled that instance with my estranged uncle in the rain-ridden alleyway. Was this the labyrinthine warren of his half-remembered dream? The tunnels themselves were archaic, and although I’m not certain, I swore I could faintly hear the cries and pleas of others in those darkened halls of ambiguity. Their voices distant and noticeably dissimilar to any that I’ve had the opportunity of hearing prior. I thought I would wake up any moment, but no matter how hard I tried, I seemed to be stuck in those haunting passageways. I ventured forth, wading through flooded hallways that only convinced me further that I was in a dream.

I’ll attempt not to delve into great detail of the properties of this dream substance. Though I did spend  an inordinate amount of time observing the qualities of this ooze, how it maintained a viscosity alike to water, yet the physical, and perhaps, chemical qualities differ significantly. The liquid did not follow the rules of gravity, as it would drip upwards, leaving puddles on the ceiling that created infinite, cascading tunnels through the reflections. Not only that, but the liquid would also accumulate and amass around the body. At this point, I was sweating extensively, and too my misfortune I would observe how this enigmatic liquid would react with regular, if not tainted, water excreted from wiped brow. I found this all hard to believe, but the memory of this dream were so visceral. The reflective ooze sunk under the pooled sweat in the palm of my hand, indicating an insoluble, heterogenous mixture.  

In my mind, I thought that messing about with the strange liquid would wake me up. I spent so long toying with it that surely I would awaken in my bed, unfortunately not though. In fact, as I walked through those dark halls, I inevitably cut myself on the jagged stone that surrounded me, and observed the blood interact with the unfamiliar liquid. It would fizzle when in contact with the blood, before erupting violently afterwards in a threatening explosion. I escaped this mostly unscathed, though I suffered a severe burn that still didn’t wake me. I seemed to cause a change in the tunnels around me, as the surrounding environment began to alter and slant, as if the ripples of the ooze continued across the darkened pools of reality.

It was then that I stumbled upon the thing; the creature that invoked an uncanny familiarity within me. I found it within the stygian chambers of my dream, where idiosyncratic celestial patterns plagued the surrounding walls. Constellations and galactic formations painstakingly engraved in the old stone, as muted light revealed a strange monolith standing stoically at the base of the chamber. Perched atop the apex was the silhouette of that eerie monstrosity, it’s perplexing appearance instilling a chilling fear that ceased my movements. The chamber thrummed lowly, as the thing seemingly scrutinized my very existence within *its* unearthly plain.

Though I falter in recalling much of my interactions with that distant yet indistinguishable entity; such is the condition of dreaming after all, I do recall the thing maintaining a humanoid form, staggering and maintaining an eerie height. Much taller than the average man, and twice as gangly as well; it’s limbs wrapped with what appeared to be a thin layer of epidermis, with sparse, wispy hair and overwrought muscles clinging stringently to its bubbling, diseased carcass. That face on the other hand I can never recall, perhaps for my best interest as I often fret to lay my head on cushion now. Though, one feature of that near-indefinable creature, that of now is burned deep into my mind, is that creatures eyes. Those bright, antediluvian eyes that shone and radiated with an ancient and animalistic vehemence.

It was after that encounter that I was awoken from my drowse. Cold sweat, dripping silently from my temple, my cuts and burns carrying over to the waking world as the rhythms of the pulse reverberated from the floorboards. Despite having that horrid thing burnt into the mind, Its physical qualities I  still struggle to describe. Mercifully, the following nights were ridden only with an unsettling silence. At first, I dismissed them as regular nights, however, an unhealthy pattern continued for a frightful duration. I soon discovered that no matter what measures I partook in; the gift of sleep was fleeced from me. Leading to that night, walking home alone to have that thing follow me into the waking world! Those eyes have slowly begun to integrate themselves into my daily life, as my routine slumber is now interrupted by them. Fear has now infested the deepened reaches of my mind; vying with repetitious, perturbing and terrifying delusions. I am now plagued with reoccurring nightmares of that particular creature, stalking and watching my every move. Even when I am not asleep.

Besides that singular and most unsettling interaction with Edmond before his passing, there had been no instigators for these nightmarish visions. Yet, these revulsion filled reveries continue to plague me, as being stuck in the crumbling lineage of my ancestors only worsened this. Somehow, between my uncles passing and the inner machinations of my mind has brought forth this entity of unknown origin; a daemon forged from the darkest nightmares that only a diseased fancy such as myself could conjure. Though was it I who truly brought this lowly dream dweller into reality? Or was it passed onto me like a curse from my estranged uncle? How many others in my family saw this wretched thing on their deathbeds? The implication stirred within me before I made a decision. With my limited inheritance, I organised a trip to the local doctor to ease my suffering as I stumble upon death’s door.

Dr Richmond de-Lange was a chiselled man, a strong jaw and stubble in addition to his urbane glasses gave him this signature superiority that followed him. I felt that he was a good fit to aid me during this spontaneous condition, which he would prove by handing over well-worn medical documents and a prescription. He described the causes to similar infirmities may be associated with psychological disorders, or may happen with no evidence of comorbid psychopathology. He explained that nightmares are contributed with disease and that the resulting isolation affects an individual either socially or psychologically, causing a feed-back loop that degrades the person mentally and physically. All of which was indeed proven by my own personal experience.

Those words that he said, at the time provided some solemnity, yet it would not last. Dr de-Lange would request a self-report of nightmares and a prospective log of current dreams. As I provided these, his professional demeanour changed to of obsession, objective horror, and intrigue. With detailed descriptions of this specific being haunting me, I can swear on the crumbling grave of my mother that he de-Lange sensed second-hand dread through my eyes, and his gaze seemed to linger not on myself, but at something behind me. I was prescribed with Valium, and ordered to ingest it daily, he asked me to come back in a month’s time for an assessment on the drugs’ effectiveness.

Hoping that the medication would eliminate, if not subdue the occurrence of these distressing conceptions. I would attempt to sleep that night, only to succumb to sleep paralysis at a worsened state of terror and anxiety, after such hopeful optimism a few moments prior would jaunt to anguish and affliction. That accursed entity that was once locked, confined to the subconscious dreamscape, entered this plain of reality through the fractures of obscurity and darkness of my home.

I was hopelessly exposed, my mind constrained to the motionless, inert cadaver that was my body.  It was soon inevitable that I was faced with the horror that slowly lumbered through the door. Its elongated, waned limbs crept silently forth, its brightened, monstrous eyes piercing the suffocating darkness that shone vaguely of moonlight. That entity stood hunched beside my bed, curling its prolonged spine in an uncomfortably grotesque fashion. The thing set its unfathomable sight upon me as I stared back helplessly, the encircling abyss that ensued after waking returning an even bolder gaze.

A brief relief would present itself as consciousness returned. Still shambling and trembling in an austere pit. It would take dawns’ benign and radiant glow before I dared to move a twitch from the safety of my covers. The abundance of fatigue and lethargy contributing to a poor reappointment with de-Lang as I described to him in detail how the condition has worsened, and how horror incarnate plagued my slumber. Dr de-Lang suggested that ‘a short-term, goal-orientated treatment should be sufficient in the treatment of an idiopathic ailment’. He would spit to his side inches away from me, before muttering to himself. He suggested for me to participate in ‘Lucid Dreaming Therapy’. Dr de-Lang proposed that-

“If you could take control of the thing, it is highly likely that your mental and physical health will increase as rule is regained over the mind.”

Later that very night, I would be confronted with that persistent, monstrous entity. As the creature slouched, sprawled limply in the dimmed corner of my inner sanctum. Those acquainted, moonlit eyes of bestial origins converging onto mine. An attempt was made to move from the confines of my divan, sedated by hues of delusion. As I slowly, sturdily arose from quilt and cushion, grasping at the rusty firearm from bygone eras beneath the bed, the thing suddenly lumbered over me and my coverlets. I grabbed at the weapon, aimed at the entity from my fortress of fluffed pillows; as an ineffable, overwhelming force prevented me from pulling the trigger.

Those decayed, primordial eyes would be all I would see before waking blearily the following morning. The stare of the thing began emanating from the concealed corners of the family house after that traumatic occurrence. Apprehension would tenderly run down the roots of my spine as this unearthly presence followed me from within the halls of my ancestry. I feared so long for my safety, as the thing taunt me still as it prowls in the shadows.

Ancient gazes now flooded the dimmed, decaying halls, soaking the very timber that once held the stagnant, yet safe abode together. The sillage of secular spirits ran pungent throughout the now accursed home that I dwelled in. The floorboards groaned on their own, and estranged, ancestral sounds emanated from the blackened burrows in the walls. My mind dreadful now, as I now endured the horrors of this dream daemon that brought with it a persistent pestilence that catalysed my condition. I was worse off now, and nothing I could do seemed to save me from this septic suffering.  

A couple nights ago, I bore witness to that creature yet again, and is the reason why I am writing this now. After reading one of the many dusty journals in my private library, I drearily stepped into the kitchen only to find the creature hanging limply from outside my window. It’s bulky, bright, bestial eyes looked down at me from beyond. I stared back hopelessly, as any semblance of will seeped from within. I noticed that the creatures appearance differed from previous nights, its limbs lengthier and stringent. The ‘hair’ that was cultivated among the gristly muscles receded, revealing greyed skin that retained the colour of stilted, stagnated still-water. I could see now its body, ribs exposed by shrunken skin that evinced strange and peculiar patterns. The thing simply stared, gnawing at something hidden deep inside. Its gaze unrelenting, obstinate and callous.

However, instead of dissipating alike other nights. The thing stayed, and stared as I awoke on the hardened floor. I must have passed out from dread, exhaustion or a combination of the two factors. That thing was in the kitchen with me, looking down at me with those eclipsed eyes, as my own watered from the pain of consistent sleep deprivation. I laid dishevelled and collapsed; my grip loosening ever more, my eyes flickering as the thing began to undulate. Releasing an utterly horrid and disgusting sound as it rooted itself to the hard-bitten floor. I instinctively began crawling meagrely away from it, the walls twitched and creaked with malevolent verve, as I used the last of my dwindling strength to pull myself together. The floor steepened, as grit and might succumbed to the horrors beyond comprehension. I fell, deep into darkness as a hole was wrought in my home.

As I fell, I could faintly make out these ghastly silhouettes gazing from stone ledges as I fell into a cold, natural pool, filled with that same strange liquid from those visceral stone tunnels. However, I knew this time I was dreaming once more, though again I could not seem to free myself from the confines of my mind. The strangeness of it all became merely an afterthought to me, as I realised far too late that my own laughter and wailing echoed amongst that well of antiquity. I remember so viscerally of something from the darkness rising, only to extend a familiar, fragile hand towards my own.

It watched silently, emitting the strong odour of contempt. I figured not to give into that dark temptation just yet, that I would find my own way out of this place, like I had before. I have found myself somewhere foreign; somewhere dried, dusty yet damp. Layers of filth and sift, accumulating over eons beleaguered me as it amassed in dunes. The air very difficult to inhale, as there was an intense mugginess that took hold of the pitched sky that shone vaguely of blackened stars, that of which held naught but vast emptiness. Despite that I could see that stony cliff leading to the hole of my home above me. The air was rife with sodden ash, falling like snow as clumps formed inside my mouth and throat. The ground reverberated eerily, thrumming and pulsing with eldritch iniquity. Darkness took hold of that barren hell, as I huddled into a ball on the filthen ground. The safety and comfort of my home was fleeced from me, as I still felt those bright, antediluvian eyes glaring from beyond.

Within that weighty gloom, a spark ignited within me, I told myself that I did not wish to fall in such a place. Although the will to keep going faltered, I continued still. I began grasping at the few exposed spots of hardened floor amidst the dusted dunes and sodden clumps.

I could not see well, yet how could one forget the feeling of estranged objects within those dusted piles? That of which felt like forgotten relics and artefacts of ancestors before me who failed at such an endeavour. After what seemed like an eternity of digging, I would be granted a tight passageway that led through a cramped, cavernous tunnel. The walls throbbed and pulsed monstrously, as a pungent waft was huffed from end-to-end. I would crawl through, the sharpened stone barbing my flesh as I proceeded. Continuing on perpetually, I would climb in that claustrophobic nightmare, as howling turned to maddened whines and giggles that either came from my surroundings, or from myself. I found a source of luminosity, which I would proceed to climb towards. My body numbing as I pushed beyond my limits, my consciousness wilting under the strain before pulling myself out.

I awoke after countless hours later, freed from that darkened, sharpened prison. As daylight’s glow gleamed from my dusty windows. I awoke dirty and dishevelled, dumping dust as I deliriously dragged myself to the kitchen. A gnawing hunger took hold of me as I felt emaciated and gaunt. That hole that was wrought the night before mysteriously missing that morning. If I passed out in the kitchen, how did I end up back in my bed? That dust that accompanied me, it was the same as in that dismal dream I had prior. I tried to make sense of it all, I tried for so, so long… to no avail in the end.

The thing haunts me still, and it will not let go of me as I drift into my last days on this realm. I feel myself weaking even more. I struggle to get out of bed, to move, to eat. My limbs feel heavy, my muscles stringent. I now follow the same steps that many in my family have taken before me. How many times has life been taken in these old hallways? The fading wood and timber creaking wearily with each step I take, as things glare at me from the gaps in the walls.

I suppose there is hope in the face of the inevitable. This cursed affliction, one that has been carried for generations, now ends with me. I can take some solace in that small victory, though victory in this case is but a hallow reminder of mortality. I do not know what fully awaits me in the great beyond, but I hope that my suffering ends peacefully. I fully intend to die as happy as one such as myself can manage, I write this in my private library, the only place in this old abode that my father refused to touch in his final days. I brought with me everything I need to survive, spring water, an assortment of alcohol and tonics, fresh food and my father’s firearm.

I know I will see it again, but this time, I wish to end this torment tonight by any means necessary. There are two outcomes that will conclude my life tonight, both are equally likely to occur. That thing that has haunted not just me, but my estranged uncle as well. What did he not tell me about that damnable dream daemon? Who else had fallen ill to its inescapable grasp? These are questions that he took to his grave, and with my passing, they will be taken with me as well. This accursed affliction ends with me, and while that may be crushing for others, it is an honour to take the Pierce name to the grave.
