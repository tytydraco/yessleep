>Inside the complex Taquasi'nit sought to translate the wall tablets that pertained to commerce, collaboration, trade, technique, mutual labor, basically anything useful for understanding protocols, wavelengths and translations of diplomacy. They sought to compassionately approach the populace in a way that would invite no harm; these appeared to mostly commune with each other by chemical means, after which reverence was given to figures based on feats of artistry, craft, healing, or public speaking or fighting. All of this doable; the crew would remake themselves into poets, magicians, shamans, doctors, speakers, great champions of war, and win hearts. All in a day's work. Outside, in the snow, Omele made a harp of bones and tendons. Resonance was key; warping the needed material for it brought about great flow and meditativeness, but required great patience. "Hold still", she told it, and it concurred.

>Thirty minutes travel from pole to pole is a grievance. To distract the mind throughout, bake bread. Convey to it consumption and heat. Sing it open, then shut. Enjoy to delight.

>Five minute activities to pass the time include tracking and moving the celestial bodies across different points in their own orbit to create intricate drawings and weaveries to have on display on the travel fabric outside. Complex patterns with meaningful shapes and flowing movement can be seen and created by waiting on light to settle and seizing upon moments of probabilistic uncertainty in its positioning, enabling full measurement of its speed and allowing application of influence over directionality.

>Another activity is to count the amounts of time you are observed and given meaning to. If you are given meaning across specific regions in the same specific patterns across different times of the year, it may be of use to disclose your name; you can be affixed and be of use in areas in which your name is called often and given meaning often, as something beyond us ties you there, if these patterns are seen. To best exert this, use the devices they name you; you are what they make you for you to be of use to them.

>Thirty five travels had to be made, then two punitive ones. Across then thirty-seven points in the crust and seven points in the mantle and three points in the core are our footholds secure; from two points on crust has the incursion been made to mantle and then core, and those were the ones who also had to be punished, for using it.  
Two songs have been written to guarantee cessation of unauthorized travel across points of interest north, east, west, south and the central singing unit. These emerge periodically to guarantee cessation of influence on load-bearing structural roots and signals; without some of these signals the possibility of arrival and maintenance become difficult, so two songs as a keep-away, and two as a draw-in, per the laws that bind us.

>Let them sing themselves to their own doom, then. We leave to you what made us ourselves; what made us great; what made us sing you.

>Five points denote your form. Six points denote your form machinized. Seven denote perfection. Eight denote endlessness. Nine denotes form. Ten denotes form folded on form. Eleven denotes initial light.  
Four points are accessible by observation, surpassed. Skip between three and five to travel across four; geometrically, directionally, this looks like a jump across the third.
