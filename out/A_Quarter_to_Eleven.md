I pulled it down further over my ears, shaking my hair out of the way. Shimmering rays of moonlight danced through the trees, lighting up patches of frosty mud. This always gave me comfort, a silent walk through the forest after sundown. Even the birds were asleep, not a whistle to be heard. The bustle of the day was slipping out of my head, thoughts calming, mind slowing.

A sudden glint on the ground caught my eye. There, by that tree. The grass crumbled beneath my feet as I walked over to it. The brambles had left deep scratches. Moonlight reflected wildly off the shards as I turned it gently between my fingers. A small, sharp splinter cut into my middle finger. It didn’t hurt, but it drew a little blood. I stood up, the frost crunching beneath my feet. It had been left here a few years at least. Maybe longer. I could just make out an inscription on the back reading Olympus - but this was an ancient camera. OM-1n, in carved in gold. At least twenty years old. The dull silver chrome finish was wrapped with dark brown leather, with deep gashes lining the side, and the strap nowhere to be seen.

There was a torn up leather label attached, with the words ‘belongs to’ written on in elegant red cursive, and a completely unreadable name. The camera was light in my hand. A smaller model. I wondered if the film inside was still salvageable.

At home, the microwave clock read 22:45. I’d never cut my walk short before. My mind had been preoccupied, I suppose.

I placed the camera onto my desk, brushing aside a pile of papers I’d been working on earlier. I dropped my coat on the floor by the chair, and went to fetch my equipment. A developing tank, my thermometer, some reel, and of course, my old wooden timer. I’d done it all a thousand times. Usually, of course, it was my own. Not this time, though. I had no idea what could be on this roll.

The whole process was muscle memory. Rinse, dip, rinse, and repeat. There were only a couple of photos. I counted eleven in total. It would be several hours before they developed. I wanted to go to sleep and just look at them in the morning, but for some reason I felt like I should stay awake and wait. My eyes kept closing, my body sinking into the soft armchair I’d placed myself in. For some reason, I was resisting sleep. But soon, my thoughts swirled into dreams and the dim light from my desk lamp faded into darkness.

  


I jolted awake. My eyes blinking, the light slowly coming back into focus. I looked at the clock. 22:45. I rubbed my eyes. 22:45. It must have stopped. The light slowly blinked at me, teasing me. I hauled myself out of my armchair, stretching my legs as I did so. My lamp flickered on my desk across the room. I don’t remember leaving the lamp on. There must have been a power cut during the night. Blinking, I rubbed my eyes again. They hurt, a dull ache sort of feeling. I walked towards the door, where I kept a clock by my desk. I peered around the corner, and in the dim light my desk lamp still gave, I saw the clock hanging above the bookshelf. Reading a quarter to eleven. I rubbed my temple with my index finger. I must have been dreaming. Maybe I didn’t sleep well, and I was seeing things. I peered through the curtains on the window to my left. The moon was still up.

I went back into the room and walked towards the desk I'd put the camera on. The photos were lying there, scattered all over the desk. I hadn't left them like that. I definitely hadn't left them like that. I rushed over to the desk.

They were everywhere.

I could swear there had only been eleven photos, no, I was sure of it. But there were at least fifty photos here, stacked around in haphazard piles across the desk. I grabbed one off the top at random, and looked closer at it. At first I thought it was pitch black, but as I looked closer and closer, I saw that it wasn't quite empty. It had just been taken in very low light, or very low exposure, extremely quickly. There was a figure that I could just make out, in a dark blue jacket, almost black.

I couldn't see anything else, the whole picture was covered with a sort of dark grainy fog. I put this photo to the side, and hurriedly took another one. It looked the exact same, from a slightly different angle. The same figure, a little closer this time. I picked up another. This one was different, at least it wasn't pitch black this time. The bottom half was covered by some sort of grass, maybe a bush. The top half was framed by a window looking into a room full of people. The photo was blurry, as if it had been taken hastily.

I couldn't make out any faces of the people inside, but there were maybe about ten of them, sitting on chairs around the edge of a white room. I shook my eyes away from the photo for a second to glance again at the microwave clock. 22:45. I willed it to change, just one minute, but nothing came.

I quickly put the photo down to the side, onto the pile I'd started making, and picked up another. This one looked like it was taken from a security camera. The angle was high and tilted, as if taken from the upper corner of a room. Though it was grainy, I could see a queue of people, in what looked like the bank on the high street. I couldn't make out any details, it was too faint.

I put it down, took another. It was blurrier than any of the others, but I could just make out a light in the background, illuminating a dark room. I blinked, squinting, trying to make out more details. I felt my breath pick up, my ears begin ringing. There was something off about this photo, something I couldn't quite place. I felt like I recognised it.

I picked another. This one made my breath quiver a little. It was a photo of a house from the front, a red brick, detached house. But I recognised this one too. This wasn't a picture from my town, but I'd been there more times than I could count. It was my parents’ house. It had the green wooden door with the frosted window pane, the line of dahlias by the front porch, everything, down to the last detail, I couldn't be mistaken. As I peered closer, the ringing intensified, and I began to hear a faint whispering in my ears, getting louder and louder. I dropped it into the pile, hastily reaching for another.

“Explain this to me.”

My heart practically jumped onto the table in shock. I span around, but there was nobody in sight.

“You go for a walk in a forest, late at night.”

The whisper had become a voice, strangely calm but forceful. I had no idea where it was coming from.

“And you find a camera.”

I stepped back and watched in half awe, half terror as the camera on my desk slowly twisted and turned, and began to make a terrible screeching sound.

“That isn't yours.”

The voice began to shout, louder and louder, as if raising its voice to be heard over the screeching. The camera began to lift off the desk, still spinning faster and faster, blowing a gust of wind into my face.

“And you think,” the voice boomed, as I saw, with my breath held and my chest tight, the pile of photos begin to ripple in the wind, one by one being picked up and spun around the camera, “that you can just take it?”

My head had started to hurt badly, with a sort of sharp, disorienting pain. The shrill ringing sound in my ears only got louder, on top of the screeching of the camera and the shouting of the voice.

All the photos were in the air now, my vision was getting blurred but I saw hundreds and hundreds of little squares flying around the room, the metal camera in the middle of them all barely visible with how fast it was spinning.

“What if it wasn't to take?” the voice screeched.

I didn't even realise I'd put my hands over my ears, but I saw that I had when they got ripped off my ears by a strong gust of wind, and I got blown to the floor.

“Did you even consider that?”

I tried to get up onto my knees, but something was pushing down on me, like I was trapped under a heavy weight.

“Stay. There,” the voice screamed, barely audible over the screeching of the spinning camera.

I didn't have much choice.

Tears were streaming down my face, whether from fear or pain, I wasn't sure.

“And now”, the voice screamed once more.

“Put my camera back.”

I was back in the forest. I glanced upwards in panic. The moon was up, brighter than ever. My heart was beating through my chest, did I just imagine the whole night?

I heard a faint whisper, the leaves rustling behind me.

“Put my camera back”, they were saying.

I looked back down. I was holding the camera in left hand. My right hand was still shaking, but at least I could move it around fine. Okay, it wasn't a dream. I took a deep breath. Finally, it was quiet.

Not wanting to think too hard about what was happening, I placed the camera down into the leaves gently.

As I did so, a rustle came from my right. I looked. There was a woman walking on the path, just visible through the trees. Long black hair, a dark blue coat, I think. The light made it hard to make out details. I called out to her. 

“Miss!”

I heard the crunching of her footsteps stop and saw her body twist and turn towards me.

“Miss?”, the doctor said. He had a warm smile, and some sparse black stubble. He wasn't talking to me, but a woman sitting three seats down from me. I took a look around the room. A clock hung over the old man with a cane sitting opposite me. It showed a quarter to eleven. I looked down in panic. I had a newspaper in my hand, today's print. Was it today? I read the date in the top left. The 18th of December. Three weeks ago.

“Your scans are ready, Miss.”

I turned to look over at the doctor again. The woman was wearing blue jeans and a light green cardigan, the type with pearl buttons. She had my fashion sense. I think she sensed me staring at her, because she turned and looked right at me.

“Can I help you with anything?” asked the man. I blinked, shook my head.

“Could you step out of line, please? There's a queue.”

Dizzy, I stepped to my side. I stared at the marble floor. Looked around. There were two queues either side of me, snaking all the way from the door. Large, double oak doors. A chandelier hung on the ceiling. Large, ivory clocks around the walls, all reading a quarter to eleven.

“I'd like to make a withdrawal, please,” the woman said.

Blue jeans. A fur lined coat, black with white lining, stylish but not expensive. Bought second hand from the charity shop around the corner from my house. I stood, in between the two queues.

I heard a yell. As I looked to my left in panic, there was the woman, right in front of me. Just before I saw her face, everything went black. I opened my eyes. I was standing in front of a mirror, a floor to ceiling mirror. I saw a woman standing there, wearing blue jeans and a light green cardigan. It was me. I blinked, and I was wearing a fur lined coat. I blinked again, and I was back in the forest, the moon shone bright into my eyes and then I was at my parents’ house.

I'd knocked on the door, my hand fell by my side. The frosted glass window in the door stared back at me, teasing me. I heard footsteps inside, coming towards the door.

“Hello?” came a call from inside the house. I’d knocked again. My hand was up in the air, against the wood, why was I knocking? And again. Louder, this time. The knocking got louder and louder.

The ground felt soft underneath my feet. I closed my eyes. The door opened towards me with a bang and I fell backwards into my armchair.

The ringing was gone, the house was gone. I breathed heavily, feeling my room fall back into place around me. The kitchen, then the desk, then the soft light from my desk light, fell gently and filled the room.

No screeching this time. Just the soft hum of the microwave to keep me company. I looked over the desk. It was as I had left it, nothing but my lamp and a pile of papers. No camera to be seen.

The clock on the microwave blinked at me. It read 22:46.
