I used to enjoy camping. Going outside and being amongst nature was a true pleasure, something that I would do most weekends, come rain or shine. I no longer want to do this. Not anymore. I've tried to think, theorise even, about what I have been through. Something rational, something real to this experience. I just can't. I'm hoping that writing this down might help? Help me process this shit, or at least try to.

It happened on Saturday, which was two days ago. I had gotten up early, hoping to make a quick head start so I would have the rest of the day to do what I wanted. I had planned this weekend for a couple of weeks now, and finally I had a long weekend to enjoy myself. I wasn't needed at work on Monday, so it allowed me to spend the next couple of days camping in my local woodland, Tingrass Woods. Tingrass is relatively small, being only about 15 hectares, but its beauty is unlimited. Shimmering streams and endless oak trees are some of the more dazzling features in there, however, I personally believed that the old mines surrounding the woods were the spotlights.

Tingrass, like its namesake, used to have tin mining in the area. Tin was the town's livelyhood, and was used often for "revolutionary" tin cans. The majority of men worked down there in those caverns, and nearly everyone who lives in the town today had at least one person in their family tree who mined tin. 

However, on the 4th of December 1966, the Shear shaft collapsed and around 20 men were trapped under the roof of the cave that day. The Shear mineshaft was well-known as the cave with the most amount of tin hiding within it, and so, they mined there the most. It was thought they hit a supporter beam, and because of the cavern's weakened state, the entire ceiling fell. The state spent a month trying to get them out, but it was no use. The boulders were too big, and there wasn't much to do anything about it. At least not in those days. My grandfather was caught in the devestation, and in the end, my father was left with his mother and his two younger sisters.

They're mostly blocked off nowadays, and it's extremely difficult to even reach the entrances due to the rangers patrolling the area all day and night, looking for rambunctious kids wanting somewhere to get wasted or already-tipsy adults hoping to get even more wasted. 

However, most people just watch them from afar, creeped out by the things. I mean, the black voids of the openings were definitely unnerving, to say the least. But, I found an eerie curiosity with them. My grandfather worked in those mines all his life, quite literally. My dad used to take my brother Tommy and I there when we went camping as kids and told us how, "our grandaddy used to work day and night in those caves." It’s part of my family history, and somewhere in that deep dark, my grandfather is lying there. Dad had never wanted to go down there, though. He stayed far away from them when camping and if he ever came close to mines, he'd come back home all jumpy, checking every room in the house and hugging my mom, Tommy and I when he saw us.

I suppose that strange anxiety is why he taught my brother and I how to get around those woods and to never go in those mines. I've been tempted, of course, but I've always stopped myself before I ever tried to sneak in. I didn't want to end up like my grandfather, and so, I avoided going near them for most of my life. Still, we continued to hike and camp with them in sight, which slightly desensitised my brother and I to their prescence.

I don't feel that way much anymore.

I packed enough food and drinks for the next couple of days, organising them in my rucksack. Beans and noodles would do me fine, and I even brought my portable kettle for coffee. This was a routine packing that I had done many times before. My tent would be in the left-hand side of my rucksack, with the sleeping bag resting in the middle, on top of the food and water. On the right would be my GPS, maps, and essentials, like first aid supplies, portable chargers, etcetera. Easy enough to remember, even with my terrible memory.                       

I set off at eight-thirty in the morning. Riding in my beloved Toyota Tacoma, the roads were thankfully clear. The bright sun shone beautifully over the Montana fields that day. I took a couple of pictures along the way to send to Tommy, who had moved out of state last year. He was living the high life at Stanford, lucky bastard.

I finally reached Tingrass at around nine-ish. The wind was low, and the late summer sun warmed my body. There were a couple of cars in front of the woodland. At least I wasn't the only one to take advantage of the glorious day.

With my rucksack on my back, I began my trek into the expansive treeline and took a quick look over to the abandoned mines. There were a pair of rangers trucks parked outside the two quaint log cabins, which were about 150 meters away from the mineshafts. I recognised one of the trucks parked next the other, the chipped sticker of the Wood Rangers emblem plastered on the door, "WUTHERS CREEK RANGERS - GUIDE AND PROTECT" written. His red dice dangled on the front mirror. Robbie was on patrol that day, usually doing the night shift as well as the day shift. He's my best friend and the only other person apart from myself who knows about what happened. Apart from you guys reading this actually.

I walked through the trees, and followed the Chessock Trail with ease. This trail headed to the middle of the woodland, although I didn't go that far. I waved hello to the odd traveler and showed a young couple where to go to reach the centre.

I continued wandering along the path, aiming to reach Babbler's Brook before ten. Or Brucie's Brook, as my friends and I called it. My old college buddy Bruce had one too many vodka lime sodas and ended up throwing up in the once-clear water, before quickly falling in and squealing like a little girl at the below-freezing temperature. I still have the video.

My timing was somewhat acccurate and I reached the brook at around ten. I slung my rucksack to the large oak tree next to the rushing water. I stretched and took a deep breath of that fresh air, crisp enough to cut silence itself. The bubbling of the water, the cheery sing-song of the birds above and the scurrying of squirrels and other little animals along the grassy floor. My bliss. My paradise. The sun was shining through the bushy leaves of the oaks, providing a large amount of sunlight for the rest of the day.

I spent most of the day there, taking pictures, doodling in my sketchbook and texting Robbie to let him know to drop by whenever he got a break. I also had to send some emails for work; being an intern has its perks, as well as its major downsides.

It was just around four when I headed back to camp. The sun was still high in the sky, but the shadows told me that darkness would be on its way soon. I chucked my rucksack onto my back and trudged back down the Chessock Trial. I let out a yawn and rubbed my eyes. It was an early start for me after all. I just let my feet take me where they knew to go. I was so away with the fairies that I didn't see the damned black book in my way. Why didn't I move slightly left? Or right for that matter. I could've missed it and avoided all this shit.

Instead, I clumsily tripped over it, and caught myself from falling face-first.

I spun around and furrowed my brow. I didn't realise what I'd stumbled on until I squinted at the obstruction in the path. As if it was placed there, a book was sat on the path, closed and waiting. I picked it up and dusted off any dirt that laid on the dark cover. It weighed heavily in my hand, which caused me to clutch the thing with two hands. There was no writing on the front, just a plain leather-bound outer cover. A silky string ran down the side of the pin-straight spine, untattered and a contrasting cream colour. The pages were a slight yellow, colouring the once-ivory edges.

I pouted. This wasn't here when I walked this way earlier.

Maybe someone dropped it whilst they were walking. It was certainly the most obvious and logical reason. Right?

I blinked, then tucked the tome under my arm, the heaviness made my arm ache as I carried it back to camp. I had to swap it between each arm to stop them from paralysing from the constant dull pain.

Finally, I reached camp. It was a place I knew well. Here, I knew the way out and the way to the centre, which would take less than twenty minutes for me to reach the entrance if need be. The sun still hovered above the endless treeline, and showed me how long I had before I was gripped by dark. Setting up the tent was always a pain in my ass, but I suppose everyone feels that way when putting up the damn things. I was zipping up the doorway to my home for the next couple of days when I first felt sick. It was a sudden rush of nausea, bile speedily crawling up my throat and the acid sorching the way. I fell onto my hands, knees already crouched. The sickness reached my mouth before I held it there, and then forcefully swallowed the vile, chunky liquid back down. What the hell was that?

I squatted there a good ten minutes, head pounding like I had smashed my head repeatedly on an iron pole. By the time my migrane subsided, the sun had dropped, sneaking behind the branches of the mighty oaks. I needed the fire made, and quick. Last time I tried to set a fire in the dark I nearly ended up destroying the whole woods. "Don't light a damn fire if you don't know where you're keeping it." My father's scolding voice rang in my already pulsing head. I was drunk and I was also trying to impress a girl I was camping with by showing her my "survival skills". Safe to say, she didn't text me back after that.

Fumbling for my lighter, I tried to catch a flame. I had already set a little bundle of dry branches and leaves earlier whilst I set up camp, so I didn't have to forage for kindling in the twilight. Luckily, the light caught and a small, popping ember began to rise, before it spread onto each dead twig and mossy green leaf. I'd need the heat to be warm for the rest of the night anyway.

Finally, I took a seat on my camping chair. I had left the book on my bag and I was going to read it after I had my dinner of beans. What a banquet. However, I had a call from Robbie whilst I was cleaning up and stayed on the phone for the next couple of hours. I told him to drop by, which he agreed and would arrive later, where he would bring some snacks and beer for us to share. Yes, I know it wasn't great for either of us to be drinking in this sort of situation, with me being in the woods on my own, and Robbie "technically" on patrol. However, Robbie's dad was the sargent of the rangers, so it wasn't really a fear that he would be fired, and I never drank so much that I wasn't in control of my own actions. Bruce's late-night bender put me off doing that anymore.

The sun's orange and crimson rays bled through the treeline, blackness oozed from the shadows. I took my last picture for Tommy. He kept texting me about how home was, how mom and dad were, and what his semester at Stanford was like. He'd met a girl called Martina and they'd hit it off. He was living his life, and I was proud of him. Leaving home and looking to make your name in the big, wide world was a lot for anyone, let alone a dweeby 18 year old like him. So yeah, I'm pretty damn proud of Tommy. He asked me, "*you seen anything cool out there?*", before adding, "*apart from those lame-ass landscapes?*"

I was about to retort, saying something like, "*Yeah this!*" and send a crude photo, but my eyes fell on my right side. It was then that I remembered the book. It was laid on my rucksack, ebony leather became inky in the sunset light. It would be a while before Robbie made his way over, so I thought "why not?"

I picked it up for a reason. I sent a photo to Tommy, and I put "*Found this thing on my way back from Brucie's Brook.*"

He came back to me, "*What is that? Is it the Death Note or some shit?*"

"*No idea, just found it in my path coming back, it wasn't there before tho?*"

The little bubble popped up, then dropped, then came back again.

"*Holy shit it IS! Bro who you killing first? I know you want to, you psycho.*"

I rolled my eyes. I took Tommy out for a drive when he was a kid, just after I passed my test, and a squirrel was hiding behind the car's back left wheel and when I had to reverse out the driveway I squashed the poor thing. Unfortunately, Tommy and I went out to check and the dumbass screamed so loud it rattled all the windows in the neighborhood. A little pool of blood surrounded the flattened mammal, its splayed out position and crushed head made its eyes pop. Poor fella. I felt terrible, but Tommy was distraught. The only way I could get him into the car was to promise to take him to McDonald's after our drive. He was 12 at the time, and he still goes on about it now. "Caused him trauma" apparantly.

I texted back that he needed to get a life apart from consuming anime in his every waking moment, and looked over at the book once more. Tommy sparked my imagination. Someone dropped it. Surely.

"*Well? What's in it?*"

I read the message before I placed my phone on the seat next to me and reached over to pick the book up from my bag. Whilst I ran my fingers along the smooth spine, my phone buzzed again. I took no notice. I just stared at the black tome weighing down my hands.

Lifting up the hard cover, I took a peek at the first crispy yellowed page. It was blank, except for a date written in scratchy handwriting. 30th November 1966. 1966? What? This was a joke, I thought. It had to be. It must have been some kids scaring people. Something black covered a large area in the middle, like how a government organisation removed names and used black blocks on hidden files. It was more accidental though? It reminded me of spilt ink.

I flipped to the next page. This showed a diary entry, written on the next date. This isn't the entire entry, rather a summarized version, as this would be easier to read.

*1st December 1966.*

*Lewisham has been speaking to everyone about the mine's infrastructure. He's jabbering on about the creaking, the creaking from above. Management's been to have a look and they've found nothing. So what the hell is he going on about?*

*I spoke to Tim and he doesn't hear nothing. I don't think Lewisham is made for this, after all if he's worried about the sounds these caves make, what is he even doing here? It's a mineshaft. Honestly, the kids they get these days. Mind you, it's better than the new machines they're looking about bringing in. They're taking our damn jobs.*

*How will I pay the taxes, hell, even for the presents this year if they cut me? Peggy will have to try and pull the weight too, bless her. I cannot put this pressure on her. I will be the indispendable tool for them, so they can survive. I must be valuable. For them.*

I flip over the page to the next entry.

*2nd December 1966.*

*The rest of the boys are starting to hear something from above. I strain to hear things, although I do hear something.*

*Extremely quiet squeaks come from the ceiling. I can't let it detatch me from my work, unlike Lewisham. The man's going mad. He grabbed me today whilst I was pushing the trolley. His eyes were red and dry, very wild and twitching.*

*He says, "Do you hear it, my friend?"*

*I squinted at him and asked what he meant.*

*He replied, "The - (this bit was scratched out and I was unable to read it) - can't you hear it?"*

*I stared at him for a while and shook my head. Something wasn't right with that boy. However, I now worry, he may be right. Whether the sound is what he says it is, I sincerley hope it is a wild fantasy of his, rather than one of fact. He warned me of the terror to come, lest we leave this cavern. I didn't see him for the rest of the day after that. He knows something, and I'm afraid I know it too.*

Entry three changed the format slightly. More snappy and direct, almost rushed.

*3rd December 1966.*

*I feel the shakes. I feel the aches. It is creaking, and the boys know it. We have appealed to management to have a simple review of the shafts above. Denied. They make us think we are stupid. We are imagining things. Fools.*

*Lewisham has since handed in his resignation. He cannot go near the shaft without shaking like a leaf or turning white. Management call him a coward. To make us stay here. They care not for any of us, just tin. The damned tin.*

*The darkness groans and it moans. It wants us gone. We all know what Lewisham meant.*

*A source within the Earth has controlled them. Money shall enslave them to enslave us. Always.*

The final entry reads as follows.

*4th December 1966.*

*The men have bolted from the place. Many have lost jobs. I have stayed. Not for my own greed, but for my wife and children. Peggy's boss will not pay her more. They will not grant her the money she deserves, and so, she is forced to work twice as hard for half the pay. My darling Peggy. She should not have to endure this.*

*I am at work, not of my own violition. The mouth of the mine is darker today, and it churns my stomach. It was deep black, welcoming me. Begging and coaxing me to take the plunge.*

*I must. I must.*

*The aches and groans are almost ridiculously loud now.*

*It is in pain, we have taken too much.*

An icy hand brushed the back of my neck, long fingers raked the skin. My eyes widened and I stopped breathing.

It was barely noticable but it was too cold to ignore. As soon as it stroked my skin, it disappeared. I held my breath until I could no longer, wheezing and spinning my head around to see who, or what, that was.

Nothing. Just my tent and the vastness of the woodland.

Even though I've had time to think about this, I couldn't explain what that was. At all.

It was silent and chilly. The sun was long gone and the fire had nearly finished dying. My phone was dead. I don't know how long I was there for. I don't even know how I read anything in that light.

It hurt to blink. It took around twenty blinks before they began to lubricate with tears again. Then, I realised something.

I didn't know where I was.

I am being fully serious here, I had no idea where I was or why I was there. What brought on this random amnesia? Only God knows. Looking back, it had to have been because of that diary. I mean, how else would I forget a place that I had been going to for over a decade?

All I had was my tent, so I switched on my lamp and reached for my equipment. I was not spending my time outside, not any longer. Before I put out the fire I made sure to have a long look at the abyss, and found nothing. Still, whilst I chucked my bag into the tent, I kept taking quick glances, checking for anything skulking around in the treeline. Nothing came like before, thank God. I wouldn't know anyway. The light made it impossible to see anything.

I zipped up the door and huddled in the corner on my sleeping bag, then rubbed my neck. It was still bitterly cold to the touch. It was so cold I swear it burnt my hand. I dipped into my bag and retrieved my portable charger, before I quickly plugged the wire into my powerless phone. I had a while to wait before I could use it with good charge, and I knew that. I think that's why my eyes stared at the diary.

Dazed, I watched as my hands picked up the book again, and they slowly opened to the diary entry I left off from.

It was covered in ink. The rest of the passage was blotted out. I swear there was writing there. There was writing there before. I stared at the black puddle in disbelief. This wasn't right.

I flipped to another page. Then another. Then another. All were a dried black mess.

All apart from the second to last page. Thinking about this even now makes my neck hairs prick up and my stomach drop.

It was completely plain, no ink was on the page, except for the scrawled words:

"*It no longer whispers. It screams.*"

The world went blurry after that, and a growing ringing, no, rumbling climbed in volume. It rang loudly in my ears, so much so, I dropped the diary and clasped my hands over my ears. It didn't stop it, and instead made it louder by adding distant male screams to the caucophony. That hideous din, the fear, the destruction. I felt it all, bones rattled under my muscles, almost trying to escape the sounds by jumping straight out of my skin. I squeezed my eyes shut, tears streamed down my cheeks and my body vibrated, as I know believe I was screaming and sucking in ragged breaths when my lungs ran out of air.

I could hear things wiping their hands against the fabric of the tent, like they were trying to claw their way in. They were slow at first, and then they became more insistant, more furious. Feet began to join the constant racket, stomping and running around me, all were frantic and disjointed. It was like hundreds of men were fleeing from some sort of monumental force.

My eyes, although closed, saw things. Flashes of men running for their lives in the dark, their dirty faces had stretched their eyes and mouths wide, illuminated by the weak parafin lanterns dotted around the cracked walls. These visions would happen for such a short amount of time, I couldn't even remember how many went past my quivering eyelids, and soon it became a frenzied nightmare. They were all from different perspectives, some of the later ones would even be from a third person perspective; a fly on the wall in this horrific desolation. Men had their strong bodies contorted into malformed postions, with their limbs crooked and bent at aggressive angles. Pops and cracks were often heard along with squishing sounds like raw meat hitting a hard surface. Eyes bulged and stared at the midnight sky, as they gawped at the giant chunks of charcoal stone which plummeted towards them, and entrapped them in the perpetual blackness.

These unlucky men cried for their families. They howled for their brothers and sisters. They wailed for their mothers and fathers. God it didn't stop. The things begged for their wives and mothers to help them. Help which would never come. They were abandoned. They were dead, and they knew this. They knew they were bound to their torment. They could not accept it. The shouting grew, and broke into a swirling clamour, whines and moans of pain added to the horrid collection of voices. It was ear-splitting.

Pure inexplicable dread filled my stomach and spread to my mind, as I felt my lungs squeeze inwards and forcibly push the clean air out of them. All I could do was cough. All I could do was shake. All I could do was scream. There was no running, there was no hiding, just death. I could smell it in the air, as rot and decay were now in every breath I took. I can't even describe what it tasted like. It was heavy and putrid, with hints of a chalky aftertaste.

The best way I could describe it would be when Robbie and I went on a walk together in Tingrass when we were young. There was a horrible smell in the air and we both immediately inhaled it. We walked towards the smell by following our noses. I can remember how Robbie vomited his mom's lunch onto the floor when we found out what it was. It was a deer carcass. A huge stag was laid on its side, and its crimson ribs were exposed to the sky. The guts of the animal had been removed, as well as the lungs and diaphragm. The same applied for the kidneys and the liver. The most vile thing about it all was its head. It's eyes were rolled back into its skull and left the jellied sockets wet with dark blood. I could see a couple of white maggots crawling around, eager for sustinance. There was also an attempt to break into its head and squeeze out the brain. Whatever had scratched off the outer skin had failed, and the cracked pink bone was shown. Mountain lions weren't often seen around these parts, which is ironic because Mount Wuthers was literally right next to our town, so it was odd to see an animal this brutally attacked. Rather stripped for parts. The stench was scarily close to what I had smelt in the tent, like I was sat in the corpse of that deer.

Suddenly, scratches cut through the hellish sounds. They stopped in an instant and I felt something warm drip down my nostrils and eyes. The men, I thought, wanted me. They were going to punish me for reading that evil tome. I forced my eyes open and I stared at the crouched figure which prodded at my flimsy tent door. I shoved my hand into my bag and pulled out my hunting knife. I brandished the blade and held it close to my chest. Then, with trembling hands, I reached for the zipper, knife prepared to plunge into the foul creature that groped at my door.

"Matt, it's Robbie! Let me in!"

Robbie. He wasn't supposed to be there until ten. It could've been anything out there. For all I knew, that could've been one of those perished men who wanted to use me to bring their decimated corpses back to life. I blame my knowledge on local folk tales and also the fact I just had a horrific experience that I felt the need to ask him:

"If you're really Robbie, what did you buy me for my eighth birthday?"

Silence.

"What?"

"You heard me, what did you buy me for my eighth birthday?" I asked him again.

Silence once more.

"I got you a Lego Batman building set? The Arkham Asylum one."

Shakily, I opened the flap, my hands shook whilst pulling up the zipper.

Surely enough, there Robbie was squat, dressed up in his ranger's uniform and holding a shotgun in one hand, with a lit flashlight in the other. I genuinely thought he was one of the dead men in the mineshaft. My mind grew dull and my ears heard a high-pitch squeal, something like tinnitus.

His look of concern grew into one of shock and horror, "Matty, what the fuck happened to you?"

I just sat there dumbly, and so, he slowly began to reach his hand out to touch my shoulder. He was warm. I was not.

He pulled me out the tent gingerly as if I was a wild animal. I don't remember much, only that Robbie had picked up my phone and we had made it to the cabins that the rangers use for their night rounds. He spoke to me, asked me questions. I couldn't answer him. My throat was torn and when I finally came to, the pain made it impossible to even breathe.

I sat on Robbie's bed, a quilt wrapped around my shoulders. He stayed with me for a while and told Tina, the other ranger on watch that night, that I had came down with a cold and I was going to spend the night in the warmth and head home in the morning. She brought me a cup of lemon tea for my throat and gave me a pitiful smile before she left to keep watch. Robbie wiped my nose with a tissue, and when he pulled it away to get a fresh one, I saw the blood soaked into the crumpled paper.

Robbie gave me two twisted up corners of a tissue and instructed me to put it up my nose, as it was still bleeding. He then handed me my phone with a grimace and told me, "You should probably text Tommy."

When I looked at my plugged in phone, I had 15 texts and 3 missed calls from Tommy, as well as 9 texts and 11 missed calls from Robbie. How long was I out? Who knows.

Tommy kept on texting me, "*Hello?*"  and "*This is a shitty joke Matt*" and most disturbingly, "*Stop it!*"

I had sent him pictures, about fifty, all of the diary. They were of the front cover, the pages, the back cover, all of it. I had even taken pictures of the woodland, although you couldn't see much, as they were either blurry or pitch-black.

I had done the same to Robbie. He was obviously worried and confused, and had set off to come and help me.

I then registered that I didn't know where the diary was. I prayed and hoped that Robbie left it behind, and didn't bring that wretched thing with us. I quietly murmured, "Did you bring the book here?"

Robbie pulled a face. "Dude, what are you talking about?"

"The black book! It should've been on my right side, or my left?" My voice was nervous and, even worse, desperate.

He looked me dead in my eyes and told me:

"Matt, I didn't see a book there."

What the hell did that mean? How? I still don't know the answer to that even now. My eyes stung. The damn thing evaporated into thin air.

Robbie noticed my distress and asked softly, "What happened to you?"

I told Robbie everything, all with a raspy voice and taking sips of the scalding hot lemon tea. I showed him the pictures and my texts from Tommy. After I had finished, Robbie stared intently at the floor for about two minutes, eyes flickered from one side of the wood to the other. The air was tense and I felt like we had been sat like that for an eternity. Eventually, he took a deep breath in, and faced me. He believed my story, he just couldn't fully process everything yet, which I fully accepted. I couldn't even wholly remember this situation myself, so I can't even comprehend what he thought of all this.

Robbie took the couch that night and gave me the bed. I would occasionaly hear him get up and leave to check on Tina and actually do his job. When Tina was done on her shift, she came into the cabin and got some shut-eye herself. She was probably told by Robbie to stay there for the night. The reason was most likely in case something happened to me again, and that he was spooked by the whole incident so he kept Tina close.

I came home yesterday morning when Robbie finished his shift. He let Tina go home first, we both bid her farewell and saw her drive away in her truck. I certainly felt better than the night before and I told Robbie that I would be fine driving home on my own. He reluctantly agreed, but he wanted to come with me to get my stuff and my truck. He watched me like a hawk the entire way there and walked just behind me for the whole trek. We packed up my tent, kicked away my old fire kindling and sorted out my bag that I had left overnight. Thankfully, nothing was stolen. It was just like how it was last night. The only thing missing was the diary, which I hoped stayed gone forever.

There was no birdsong or any squirrels that chased each other in the trees. There weren't any people who walked by or distant chatter either. It was just dense silence. It hung so heavily in the air, almost like a bomb had gone off and erased all life from the area. I was stunned by how unusually still the woods was that morning, and I could tell it unsettled Robbie. He just stifly put things away and stayed quiet, much like me. We wanted to get out of there.

Strangely enough, the further we left the camping spot, the more alive the woods became. Sparrow chirps and fellow travellers returned, which eased us both. We reached the entrance and hauled my stuff into the back of the Tacoma. I thanked Robbie for all his help and opened the door to my truck, before I hopped in. As I was about to say goodbye to Robbie, he held the door window and his dark eyes stared straight into my soul.

"Call me if anything else happens, m'kay?" It was more of an order than a request.

I nodded, started up my truck and drove home.  Yesterday, nothing really happened. Robbie came over to check up on me anyway just to see how I was doing. I kept all the lights on upstairs when I went to bed though, I didn't want to be left in the dark again. I slept like a log for most of the night. I only got up once. It must've been some sort of primal instinct because when I opened my eyes I felt as though I was being watched. It was like all the hair on my neck shot up and a hard lump weighed in my throat. I sat up slowly and observed the room. Everything still looked the same - all the lights were on and my door had remained closed. I grabbed my hunting knife and checked the house to ease my racing mind. I found the house identical to how I left it, not thing out of place. The feeling then drifted away and I dragged my weary body back to bed.

I can't tell you what happened that night. I seriously don't know. Part of me feels like it was some kind of bizarre hallucigenic seizure, or just an odd dream. But, part of me knows that was real. It was fucking real. More real than reality.

Something happened to me that night and it wasn't normal. Hell, even Robbie knows that and he's not the biggest believer in the supernatural.

And you know what, neither was I. Not until that night or until today.

You see, at around noon I made myself a coffee and looked through some emails to prepare myself for the meeting I have tomorrow. I left the living room for five minutes. Five fucking minutes.

Nothing could've happened in that time. No one, even if they squatted in that room for days, could've done anything. It simply wasn't possible. I would have heard them.

So you can imagine the absolute scare I had when I saw that diary laid on my coffee table in front of my laptop, wide open with the string running down the crack in the book. It was acting as a mocking bookmark, almost like it was doing me a sick favour.

It reads:

"*5th December 1966.*"

That is why I have decided to write this down. I need to prove to myself that I'm not crazy and I need assistance.

Someone, anyone, can you help me? I don't know what this thing is and I want, no, need this thing gone.

Please, I need knowledge on this thing. As I write this I keep looking over to it. Writing keeps appearing on the page everytime I look back. It's filled one page now and looks like it's going to start the other.

It presses me to read the next entry, and I'm scared that I feel a sense of eagerness to comply.
