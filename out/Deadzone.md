Me and 3 of my friends were going out playing hoop in our local park. We planned to do it after we ate and for a while everything seemed normal. When we got to the court, there was this rumor among the people here that things kept getting lost and whenever CCTV cameras try to capture footage, nothing can be made up. They even lost a ball, a toy, even a phone, and sunglasses. We didn't think much about it though and played ball. Check up.

"..the hell..?"

As i thought to myself after my fully pumped ball just bounced a foot off the ground.

"why is there a deadzone in our court?"

My other friend asked.  But I just told him to shake it off and bounce it harder. Game point 21 win by 2. I'm an SG but my always go-to spot was always.. ALWAYS the top. Right where the deadzone was. And there we began playing for about 7 hours I might say. I dunno how many times we walked or bounced the ball on the deadzone. Can't help it, game rules y'know? As a joke, 2 of my friends stomped on the spot for what I'd say about 30 minutes straight. They said I should try it. I wish I didn't.  I jumped into the zone and it felt... soft? Like jumping on a bed. I was spooked thinking I was gonna rip through the zone and end up paying for it. But.... there's no way concrete is like that right? But I didn't wanna take the risk, so let the ball do the work.

.....

BANG!!

"WHAT THE FUCK"

The ball... disappeared.  Just went through the material like how it would in a game. It was like nothing I've ever seen before. We were all mortified. Where did it go? I panicked and almost fainted right where the zone is but  my friend pushed me out just in time. He couldn't save himself. He tripped and fell in.

Boom.

He disappeared as well. The 3 of us didn't know what to do. Until we felt something suck us into the hole like a vacuum. We were too weak to repel it. My other friend fell in.

Bang.

A light kept flashing when something fell in this zone.

BÃ¦NGgg.*

My other friend went in. It was only me left, I had no choice but to fall in and see where it might take me.

It felt like eternity tumbling through what felt like a dark downwards tunnel.  But then I fell to the ground. No damage to my body whatsoever, and my friends were right there with me, waiting for me.  But something else sparked my vision, a phone, a pair of sunglasses, a basketball. Did all of the missing items go here? Where are we?
It looked like an office space. Lights didn't work, but a mysterious big glow from the windows lit up the space like day. Nobody is here, computers look like something from the Stone age. I tried to see anything other than white light from the windows, tried to break it even. But I just can't.  Something about this place makes me feel glad that I have my friends here. We decided to grab the missing things and explore the place. Walls are moldy and wet. The computers still aren't working. Some of the doors were unlocked, so we decided to rummage the place for food and lucky enough, we found a somehow working vending machine. The fuck? I thought there were no electricity here. Or maybe they just switched the lights and computers off. But they didn't turn the vending machines off as well??

....

For what felt like 30 minutes, there was a faint sound of a telephone going off.  Should we go over there? We both ran there as fast as we could, hoping to get the fuck out of here.
