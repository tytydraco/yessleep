I woke up with a start. Few sounds immediately instill a feeling of dread like the sound of glass shattering, especially at night. I froze for a moment, waiting to hear someone stomping down the hall, tearing through cupboards, or anything that would hint to the intruder's actions. But there was nothing. Shakily, I got up out of bed, and reached over to turn on the lights.  
  
To my surprise, nothing happened. The power was out, meaning either this was the most inconvenient blackout in human history, or the burglar had planned ahead. Tonight was going to be interesting. I cursed under my breath, and grabbed my cellphone.  
  
*Who the hell are you gonna call?*  
  
I wasn't keen on talking to the police, and I didn't have any friends to call, considering I just moved to this town a few months ago.  
  
*Not that you've ever made many friends.*  
  
No, I had to handle this alone. I flicked on the phone's flashlight, and grabbed the wickedly sharp knife from my nightstand. Before I exited into the hall, I stopped to listen. Still no footsteps, or any other indications that the invasion was proceeding.  
  
*What is this? A burglary or something else? Maybe he's even waiting around the corner to ambush me.*  
  
No, this whole thing seemed strange. Breaking in through the window seemed like an amateurish move, but why the stealth all the sudden? Not to mention the power. I sighed, and quickly kicked through my bedroom door. The apartment is small, with only one bedroom, and the main living room with a kitchen, so clearing it shouldn't be a problem. Before me lay the kitchenette and dining room, to the left of that was the small loveseat and TV next to the entrance, silent as a grave.  
  
I checked the corners quickly, light held out far to the side of my body just in case the attacker had brought a gun. In the living room, I saw on my couch a small rock lying on the couch, broken glass strewn around it.  
  
*No one entered through the window. Maybe this is a professional after all.*  
  
At that moment I heard the rustle of something moving behind me. I shone the light back towards my bedroom, and saw the shower curtains softly moving, as if in a breeze. I swore to myself, I hadn't thought to check the bathroom attached to my room.  
  
"Come on out," I yelled with over-exaggerated confidence, "I have a gun and I will shoot."  
  
My challenge was met by unbroken silence. I weighed my options carefully. Either I make a break for the front door, and get stabbed in the back, or I confront him head on and get stabbed in the face. I turned off the light, and started towards the front door, making sure to step loudly. I stood at the door, pretending to fumble with the key.  
  
*Come on, I'm wide open here.*  
  
I could hear the attacker rushing towards me as quickly and quietly as he could, but the instant before he reached me, I dropped into a well practiced crouch, and swept a leg out, tripping the attacker over in a bundle of limbs. It was a risky move, but it had paid off. I straightened up, knife raised for a brutal fight, but was surprised when he stayed unmoving on the floor.  
  
I bent over and saw that the man had managed to fall right onto the knife that now protruded awkwardly from his abdomen.  
  
*Right into the heart? Lucky bastard.*  
  
Still clenched in the man's left hand was a rag, soaked with the unmistakable smell of chloroform. Upon a quick search, he had a collection of matches, lighter fluid, and even a skeleton key. I took the kerosene and started to douse the carpeted floor. I shook my head, here I was hoping this would be a fun night.  
  
*What a pain, and I just got settled in here.*  
  
By the time the fire department arrived to combat the blazing condominium, I was 35 miles away on the open highway.  
  
"A real shame," I chuckled under my breath, "It's always nice to meet a fan of your work."
