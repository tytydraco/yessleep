How have you folks been? Man it’s been a bit hasn’t it. 2 whole weeks, did ya miss me? Of course you did. You’ll be happy to know I’ve cleared the corpses off my lawn, the lake creature’s belly is nice and full, I’ve started fixing my lawn, and I got a new friend. 

Allow me to regale you. Regale? What am I? A dirty brit? Anyways.

My land allowed me a week of peace. A week of being able to enjoy my land. “Come on, eat up.” I whipped the sweat off my forehead as I hurled the final Mockingbird corpse into the lake. The water frothed as the lake monster– I named her Dory– consumed the carcases. It took me two days to haul down every chunk of Mockingbird and I was craving a swim. “Alright, it's me, be nice… I have a gun.” I warned as I cautiously entered the lake. It was unnaturally warm, not uncomfortable, but impossible with the limited sunlight the water received. The ground under the water was sandy, and dense like lead dust. 

Something ran past my foot, it curled around my foot and tugged. “Shit.” Water drove up my nose as I was pulled to impossible depths. Light was drowned out and was reintroduced as a titan eye opened and examined me. Bubbles ran up over me, it was smelling me. Casting a shadow over my face, a claw ruffled the hair on my head. I nodded in recognition as the claw tapped my face. I was gently returned to the surface, set on the dock from where I tossed its food. “Nice to meet ya.” Dory likes me I guess, which is fun, maybe I can teach her some tricks.

In my peacetime I managed to get a majority of my lawn patched up and restocked my munitions along with a few extra surprises– Thank you Uncle Jacob, the only man that can get you 100 pounds of grass seed for a reasonable price and a top of the line artillery cannon. After that… Well, I was struck with untameable boredom. I realized that for the first time in a good few years, I had nothing to do. 


I bought a dog. Tony.


A Kangal Shepherd to be specific. A rescue. What better to fill my time with than with something I’ve never done before. She is a beautiful little– she fucking giant– pooch and as my first dog ever, she’s pretty much perfect. She took to liking me quickly, I blame the milkbones, and showed this liking by laying down and pinning me to the bed until she decided to wake up. 

Saturday, 6 days after I learned I can’t die– a fact I chose to ignore since I had no reason to investigate– I noticed something strange. As I set down Tony’s bowl, some stupidly expensive shit I got shipped as part of an annual subscription that she simply refused to eat no matter what, I caught sight of something in the tree line. A person stood on the edge of the shade, his gaze set on my home. 

“Ay, It’s private property, leave, dejar, partir, verlassen, lasciare, sair, vertrekken, уйти , 离开 , 立ち去る, 떠나다, غادر, gitmek, छोड़ना, ondoka, φύγω, lämna, forlade, lähteä, odejść, discedere.” The Latin is all he understood, not a good sign. “Tony… Say a quick prayer. Lord, please let there be a cult in my woods.” 

I guess he answered my prayer. 

Late into Monday night Tony followed close behind me. A bag slung over my shoulder, rattled with trail cameras. I slunk through the woods, setting up the cameras all throughout the forest. “Heel.” Tony snout bumped against my heel as she braked to a halt. She shook her head and followed my gaze. 

13 people of similar build stood around a fire. The bones of a dog charred. Tied to a gory effigy, was a collar. “Tony.” It read. On a tree, stripped of bark, a man sat crucified, his skull pierced with a rock. The fire roared and billowed, lashing and raving about in coils of molten air. I felt my heart beat pick up in my chest as I realized, though the robe figures feet pointed towards the flame, their eyes stared out from the hood. I was being watched, monitored. I brushed Tony’s head and began slowly stepping away.

The fire whipped and crackled then died with a gentle gust, stealing the lights from the area around me. I reached for Tony’s back and ruffled her soft fur as she and I slowly retreated. A branch cracked and the warmth of breath hit my face. I wheeled around and ran. Tony’s collar rattled close behind as I rushed. Beams of moonlight trickled in and soon the tree line broke. 

Uncle Jacob was pouring seed along the patched areas of the lawn, raising an eyebrow as I flew past him flanked by a whimpering Tony. He shrugged his shoulders and continued pouring seed while humming Shoot to Thrill. Tony dove through the doggy door and I engaged all 21 of my door’s locks. 

“Tony, let me see girl.” I cautiously knelt down and looked at her injured paw. A piece of jagged metal, a crummy shiv, was jammed into her paw. I threw open my medkit and rummaged through it. Tony hobbled over to her food bowl and nibbled at the food in her bowl. 


From the corner of my dining room I noticed something off. The shadow itself was fine but it looked too dark, like the entrance to a cave that ate and spat out light with profound revulsion. I took in the rest of the room, freezing as I heard something riggled from the shadow. A mass skittered past my line of sight. I followed it, pulling the gun off my hip. 

The wet click of its legs gently rushing across my floor multiplied. The clicking grew overwhelming and the feeling of bugs seeking shelter in my clothes made me begin wailing. They lurched and burrowed into my skin. I went to dig them out but the damn immortality healed over the wounds, trapping the squirming insects under my skin and muscle tissue. 

It’s there where I was fed up. I stopped my performance and turned to Tony. I blew open her skull with two bullets, nearly emptying my clip into her belly. “Tony would never eat that food. Damn waste of money for me, but a fact you wouldn’t know.” I pressed the barrel to my head and pulled the trigger. My balance slipped but I caught myself as the illusion burned away. I had never escaped the woods. 

Blood ran down my cheek as I shook my head. The hole patched. “The bugs were a nice touch, but that’s not how it feels to have insects burrow into you. Close but no cigar.” I was at the mouth of a cave, behind me was the lone cultist they put in charge of ensnaring me in the illusion. He went to scream but I spun around and punched through his skull, temporarily shattering my knuckles. “Where is my puppy— why the fuck am I asking a corpse?” I pulled my fist out. I looked around, trying to catch sight of any raging bonfires, instead I spotted the deer.

Its wet nose brushed my cheek and its head tilted as it looked into my eyes. This was the deer. I knew it was, it was the same down to the follicle, only now it moved. It trotted past me and stomped its hoof. I was standing, my gun reloaded, and my clothes were steamed wrinkleless. It huffed and kicked its foot, pointing deeper into the woods. 

“What are you?” I asked. It was silent, kicking its hoof again. “Thank you.” I followed the direction it pointed. The woods seemed endless, like the belly of an insatiable behemoth. I ran and ran. The bones of my feet broke from the force of running and healed by the next step. 

The peak of a red flame spilled over in the distance. My muscles fibers tore and rebuilt as I picked up the pace even further. Bouncing off the trees, flowing through the bushes, was the muffled bark of Tony. The firelight grew closer and closer then was wrenched away. The ground rushed under my feet and the forest stretched, dragging the light further. I refused this. I refused to lose my dog. I don’t care what devil or god this cult had backing them I would not lose Tony. Over on a small foothill, the deer walked to the top, its head followed me and then panned over to the distant fire. I bent down and licked the grass, eating a single blade of it. As quickly as the land had stretched away, it was dragged screaming back. Something bellowed in agony as the land overpower its will and returned to its God-made form. 

The flame and the figures that he surrounded it were only a few feet away. 

I dove into their ritual. Tony was chained to the stone monolith, fighting and weeping against the leash. I ignored the cultists and grabbed the chain, snapping it over my knee. I examined Tony. A small thorn was stuck into her side from them dragging her through the woods. It hadn’t drawn blood, but it didn’t need to. “You hurt Tony.” I held back tears and prayed for them silently. “You don’t hurt tony.” 

My gun flew into my hand, and emptied in seconds. There was a small army of them, but they weren’t the finest specimens of the human race. I ditched my gun and shattered one of their rib cages with a glancing blow. “Jug!” I shouted as I wailed on another while one ran up behind me with a knife. Tony’s ears twitched and she dove at the man’s throat, tearing out his jugular. Tony grabbed the knife with her mouth and threw it to me. I snatched it out of the air and slit a man tit to taint. 

Tony leapt onto the boulder at the center of their congregation and tackled one to the ground. I crushed his skull under my heel and sent Tony to wrangle the one’s fleeing. 

Knives stuck into my body and torches lit me ablaze but I tore through their number all the same. Tony stalked through the woods, mauling the cultists who tried to get away from the consequences. The final cultist around the ritual was in finer robes with a ram’s skull on his head. I presumed he was the leader. I held him by his throat against the monolith they had Tony chained to.

“Who are you?” He wheezed, but didn’t respond. I grabbed his wrist and twisted his hand off, sending him into a screaming fit. “Who. Are. You?”

“You don’t know what you’ve done.” He choked out.

“I don’t much care. You hurt my dog.”

“That dog's life, its soul, was set to be feed for The Great Hunger. But you stole his meal. Abandon all hope. He dawneth–” I crushed his throat in my hand and left him to suffocate on the ground. 

“Tony girl, heel!” Tony ran from the woods, muzzle blood soaked and returned to my side. “Hey girly. Let’s get home, get you a bath.” 

I trudged through the woods, rejoicing at the sight of my home. Uncle Jacob cursed about as he dumped seed out along the lawn. “This is the nicest fucking soil I’ve ever fucking seen, fuck me, fuck! I want a lawn this fucking nice, fuck you God, give me this fucking nice of a fucking lawn motherfucker.” Uncle Jacob made sailors’ mouths look like church boys’. “What the fuck happened to you Melon head?”

“Cult.”

“Ah fuck… did they fuck with the lawn?”

“Nope.”

“GOOD.” He continued to mumble curses as he poured more seed.  

I washed Tony off, gave her the full spa treatment and crashed onto the couch to rest. Checking my phone made clear that I had been in those woods for 6 days. How exactly I don’t know, but I don’t need to. I have my dog.

Tony flopped across my lap and I clicked on the TV. the news was on. “A gigantic sinkhole has mysteriously opened up in rural Vermont, geologists are baffled at the disaster and even stranger, a supermassive heat signature was tracked insid-”

“Ugh, they never have anything good on these days.” I flicked through the channels, happily stumbling on a channel airing reruns of the Golden Girls. I was out in less than an episode. Tony and I filling the house with obnoxious snoring.

As of now. Nothing new has happened. Tony is still asleep on my lap and I recently woke up from one of my recurring nightmares. A blazing angel, its wings broken and charred standing over a house. A cabin, surrounded by trees with a man and his dog inside, and a temperamental man seeding the lawn. 

It’s one of the oldest nightmares in rotation. A rotation that’s shrunk apparently. I no longer dream of a towering gangly beast swallowing me whole while I sleep in bed, or dream of being rent apart by rotten monstrosities. Who knows, who cares? I’m gonna go back to sleep now. 

Have a good one folks, till next time.

The deer is on my porch.
