“Hello?” I answered the phone. “I saw this number on an ad online” she responded. “you're correct, what do you need?” I asked, holding back laughter. I was still in disbelief that the ads had worked. “I'm not sure, things keep moving in my house, they're never where I left them when I leave.” she gave us her address, agreed on a price of 120 dollars, and we told her to stay away from the house for the day. 



We set off for the house with nothing but some salt, an old crucifix and some walkie talkies that didn't reach very far. It wasn't too far, about a 20 minute drive. When we arrived she was already gone, though she said she'd leave a key under the doormat. We messed around inside the house for a while, recorded some footage for the website and left. It was that simple. We did this about 3 more times that day, all callers from a neighboring town. We figured that since we had more callers from there we'd do those today and schedule the Hillkit callers for tomorrow. By the end of the day we had 400 dollars. It was too easy.



The next day we met up at the Holly tree. That was sort of our base of operations. Sam took the first call. It was for “66 Holly Hedge Drive”, the abandoned house on Sams road. “That's weird.” wrote aidan. “Yeah..” I agreed, “Nobodys lived there for years.”. Sam thought it must be a prank call, so we didn't waste our time with it, and went to “help” someone else. It didn't take long for us to get another call asking for the same address. 

“Hello?” 

“Hi, this is Hillkit Paranormal Society, what do you need?.” 

Silence

“Hello?” I asked, unsure if I had been hung up on.

“66 Holly Hedge Drive”

 It wasn't the same person as before. I panicked and hung up. “That was weird..” I said, concerned. Sam responded: “Lot of people prank calling I guess. Must be a friend of the first kid.” “Hopefully..” I responded. Nobody wanted to admit it, for fear of being made fun of, but I could tell everyone had the same thought.



We moved on to the next house, an old woman called about her dead cats meows still being heard in her house. I felt bad about some of our “clients” because it was mostly paranoid, hyper-religious people dealing with mental illness. But the ethics of it didn't matter, not with May's life on the line. We arrived and the old lady was still there, and refused to leave until we had exorcised her dead cat. She handed us the keys and we let ourselves in, everything seemed normal at first. We pretended to search the house for where the sound was coming from, but couldn't hear anything. I called for a debrief in the van. “We need to fake hearing it.” I proposed. “Imagine how much extra she'd pay us if we actually did something.” Aidan nodded and smiled. We devised a plan to meet up in her kitchen and pretend to hear the cats meows, lay the salt down, say a few prayers and make it look as real as possible. 



We headed in, straight toward the kitchen. We walked around a little, inspecting things, making ourselves look busy. Me and Sam kept glancing at each other, waiting nervously for one to make the first move. At that moment I realized how jealous I was of Aidan. Lying must be easy without having to talk. “Did you hear that?” I asked suddenly. “It's here”

Aidan nodded. Him and Sam walked over to the counter. We laid the salt out, and tried not to laugh as I said some prayers I learned at church camp when I was younger. The old lady came inside the house to check on us and saw what we were doing. She smiled and wished us luck, but as she turned to leave the house, she stopped. We all stopped. We all heard it. And this time we knew where it came from. The old lady hurried out of the house and told us to go down to the basement to investigate, otherwise we wouldn't get paid. I looked at Aidan, nervous. We exchanged looks that gave the impression that neither of us wanted to be here. As we stepped toward the exit, we heard a door open from behind us. I spun around, it was sam. He was heading for the basement. “What are you doing?!” I asked, annoyed. “Curing my fucking sister.” He ran down the stairs, stomping, I felt bad for whatever creature was down there. The sound grew louder, as there was a loud snap, the power went out. 



Me and Aidan hurried after Sam in the dark. Halfway down the stairs we heard him muttering something under his breath. The meowing had stopped, and in its place, white noise began. Tv static. Loud and oppressive. As I reached the bottom of the stairs and turned around to look at Sam, he was crying, on his knees with his pocket knife in his hand. In front of him a tv. “Impossible” I thought as the power was off. Then I read what was on the Tv.



66
