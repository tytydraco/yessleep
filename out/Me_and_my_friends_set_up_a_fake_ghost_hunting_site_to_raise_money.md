"Hello?”

 I answered the phone. 

“I saw this number on an ad online”

 “you're correct, what do you need?”

 I asked, holding back laughter. I was still in disbelief that the ads had worked. 

“I'm not sure, things keep- keep moving in my house, they're never where I left them when I leave.”

 Her voice was shaking, assumingly with fear. She gave us her address, agreed on a price of 120 dollars, and we told her to stay away from the house for the day. 

We set off for the house with nothing but some salt, an old crucifix and some walkie talkies that didn't reach very far. The house wasn't too far away, about a 20 minute drive. When we arrived she was already gone, though she said she'd leave a key under the doormat. We messed around inside the house for a while, recorded some footage for the website and left. It was that simple. We did this about 3 more times that day, all callers from a neighboring town. We figured that since we had more callers from there we'd do those today and schedule the Hillkit callers for tomorrow. By the end of the day we had 400 dollars. It was too easy.

The next day we met up at the Holly tree. That was sort of our base of operations. Sam took the first call. It was for “66 Holly Hedge Drive”, the abandoned house on Sam's road. 

“That's weird.”

 wrote Aidan. 

“Yeah..”

 I agreed,

 “Nobody's lived there for years.”

Sam thought it must be a prank call, so we didn't waste our time with it and went to “help” someone else. It didn't take long for us to get another call asking for the same address. 

“Hello?” 

“Hi, this is Hillkit Paranormal Society, what do you need?.” 

Silence

“Hello?” I asked, unsure if I had been hung up on.

“66 Holly Hedge Drive”

 It wasn't the same person as before. I panicked and hung up. 

“That was weird..”

 I said, concerned. Sam responded:

 “Lot of people prank calling I guess. Must be a friend of the first kid.”

 “Hopefully..”

 I said. Nobody wanted to admit it, for fear of being made fun of, but I could tell everyone had the same thought. Something was wrong with that house.

We moved on to the next house, an old woman called about her dead cats meows still being heard in her house. I felt bad about some of our “clients” because it was mostly paranoid, hyper-religious people dealing with mental illness. But the ethics of it didn't matter, not with May's life on the line. When we arrived, the old lady was still there, and refused to leave until we had exorcised her dead cat. She handed us the keys and we let ourselves in, everything seemed normal at first. We pretended to search the house for where the sound was coming from, but couldn't hear anything. I called for a debrief in Sam's car. “We need to fake hearing it.” I proposed. “Imagine how much extra she'd pay us if we actually did something.” Aidan nodded and smiled. We devised a plan to meet up in her kitchen and pretend to hear the cats meows, lay the salt down, say a few prayers and make it look as real as possible. 

We headed in, straight toward the kitchen. We walked around a little, inspecting things, making ourselves look busy. Me and Sam kept glancing at each other, waiting nervously for one to make the first move. At that moment I realized how jealous I was of Aidan. Lying must be easy without having to talk. 

“Did you hear that?”

 I asked suddenly. 

“It's here”

Aidan nodded. Him and Sam walked over to the counter. We laid the salt out, and tried not to laugh as I said some prayers I learned at church camp when I was younger. The old lady came inside the house to check on us and saw what we were doing. She smiled and wished us luck, but as she turned to leave the house, she stopped. We all stopped. We all heard it. A low, distorted meow, coming from the basement door to my right. All of a sudden the old woman didn't seem so crazy anymore. She hurried out of the house and told us to go down to the basement to investigate, otherwise we wouldn't get paid. I looked at Aidan, nervously. We exchanged looks that gave the impression that neither of us wanted to be here. As we stepped toward the exit, we heard a door open from behind us. I spun around. It was Sam. He was headed down the basement stairs. 

“What are you doing?!”

 I asked, annoyed. 

“Curing my fucking sister.”

He ran down the stairs, stomping, I felt bad for whatever creature was down there. The sound grew louder, as there was a loud snap, the power went out, but the sound kept going, piercing through the dark emptiness of the house. 

Me and Aidan hurried after Sam. Halfway down the stairs we heard him muttering something under his breath. The meowing had stopped, and in its place, white noise began. Tv static. Loud and oppressive. As I reached the bottom of the stairs and turned to look at Sam, he was crying, on his knees with his pocket knife drawn, in his hand. In front of him, a tv. “Impossible” I thought, as the power was still off. Then I read what was on the Tv.

“66”

We ended up getting our money, and only a few days later the old woman had moved away. We had gained quite a reputation around our area. More and more calls came in by the day, we were only a few cases off paying for her surgery. With the rise of clients came the rise of the “66” calls. We were all concerned, and though nobody said anything, I could tell. It was only a matter of time before we got too curious and visited the house. The thought made me sick to my stomach with a sort of excitement. It was a confusing feeling. I knew I shouldn't go, but I yearned for it. Deep down it was what I wanted, but I couldn't tell why. Laying in bed that night, my phone lit up on my nightstand. The low hum breaking the dead silence of my room. I was glad to take my mind off of what happened that day, the thoughts still circling my mind, keeping me up. It was May. 

This was the first contact she made since her diagnosis. The text simply said 

“come outside.” 

I did as i was told, got dressed and snuck outside, i found her leaned up against the fence outside my house. She looked frail, weak, almost cold. We walked and talked for hours, just like we used to, doing anything to take our minds off both our situations. Eventually we made it to the tree, and May broke what she thought to be news to me.

“My parents can't pay for my surgery.”

 she said, clearly holding back tears. I told her I knew Sam had overheard them talking about it. I said that we were making money to pay for it, and she was over the moon. i decided not to tell her how, its either “we’re ghost hunting” or “we’re scamming religious people out of hundreds of dollars”, and I'm not sure she'd take too kindly to either of them. I walked her home and before we got inside, she started to cough. I noticed the hand she coughed into was covered in blood. She looked up at me weakly, her soft green eyes tearing up. 

“I'm dying, Cal.”

 She said, her voice trembling as she began to cry. I knew it was true. I didn't want to believe it.

The calls seemed to be getting worse. More and more “66” calls came in, until there were more of them than the real clients. They just kept coming. We had 2 calls scheduled for tomorrow, they were supposed to be the last. We made it to the first house and couldn't find anything, the man refused to pay us until he had seen something. Clearly, he saw the videos online and just wanted to see something cool. We left without the money. The next case was even worse. On the way there I felt a sense of unexplainable dread. I couldn't stop thinking about yesterday. The Tv, Amy, the blood on her hand. We needed to help her. We arrived at the house, although something felt off. The grass was overgrown, the walls had weeds sprouting from the cracks in the concrete, the car in the driveway had flat tires and grimy windows. It looked almost abandoned. I reached for the rusted brass handle of the front door. It was unlocked. 

I stepped forward into the house and my shoe was soaked. I recoiled and stepped back in disgust. The entire floor was covered in a dark, muddy liquid. The walls were stripped open, revealing burst pipes and sparking wires, which seemed to be twisted to the number 6. A horrible chill shot through my spine. I tossed it up to me being tired, io hadn't slept much the night before, and my mind was just playing tricks on me. Not wanting to deal with this situation, we figured it was just a prank call to another abandoned house. But that was it. The last of the cases we had scheduled. We figured we'd have made enough money by the time these clients were dealt with, so we shut down the website. Sam proposed something like this might happen, but I was too focused on the thought of May being cured, and wanting it to happen as soon as possible, so we could finally be done with the 66 bullshit that I shut it down anyway. When we made it back to the tree I was stressed out. I couldn't take it anymore, I had to see what was in that house. It was as if I was being called to it. As I was about to tell Aidan and Sam about my desire to explore the abandoned house, my phone rang. I hoped it was May, but the number wasn't saved to my phone. I knew it wasn't another client, as the site had been down for hours at this point. I answered it, to static, just like the tv in the house. As I was about to hang up, a voice spoke. It sounded strained, almost like it was painful to talk. Like a parched throat, cutting with each word. 

“66” 

I threw the phone. I couldn't take it anymore. My hands clasped the side of my head, the feeling returned, the feeling I was being called, drawn to it. The house. I had to go. I wasn't even thinking about May, I just needed to see what was in that house. 

“Cal what was it? Is May alright?”

 Sam asked me. I felt Aidan’s hand rest on my shoulder. I pushed it off out of frustration, I couldn't think. 

“We need to go.”

Sam asked “Where? What's going on?”

“The house, 66, we need to go. I can't fucking take it anymore.”

Sam didn't think it was a good idea but I didn't care, I felt like I was about to burst. Sam was trying to lecture me on how we need to at least take care of May before going, and that he had a bad feeling about going, then Aidan began to write. 

“We’re only a few hundred dollars off, they should let us pay the rest in instalments right?” 

I agreed and urged them to go with me, Sam was reluctant. He said we should go to the hospital and talk to the doctors first, but we teased him for being too scared to go to the house, and God forbid Sam feel a human emotion like fear. He reluctantly agreed to come. We began to walk. I felt.. nervous? Or maybe excited? It was hard to tell. There was a pressure in my chest, butterflies in my stomach, that only worsened as we got closer. I don't know why I felt this way, I know I shouldn't have. I felt like I was drawn to it, like a guilty pleasure or a bad habit. 

We walked for about a half an hour, eventually passing Sam's house. I looked through May's window, foolishly hoping she'd look back. We hadn't spoken since the other night, when she told me she was dying. Soon enough she'd have to be fully hospitalized, as her condition kept getting worse. I couldn't shake the feeling that it was my fault, like I was guilty. We were getting closer. I could almost see it now. The mossy, filthy roof, the broken windows, the graffiti on the wall. I couldn't contain my excitement, my nerves. One part of me wanted to turn back and never set foot near the house again, the other part needed to know what was in there. We arrived, and stood in front of the 2 broken down, beat up cars. Shattered glass littered the driveway. 

Aidan reached for the door, but I already knew it'd be locked. I made my way around the side as I heard him fiddling with the door handle, and gestured to them to follow me. The side door was unlocked, just as it had been when I went there with May all those years ago. We walked down the side of the house, the walls were littered with cracks sprouting with moss and weeds. The backyard wasn't much better than the front, with overgrown grass and rusted lawn chairs. The glass sliding door to the back was smashed open, so we went inside.
